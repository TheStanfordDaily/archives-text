# Farm Air Raid, Disaster Drill To Go on from 7 to 8 Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's first full-scale air raid blackout and disaster drill will lake
place from 7 to 8 o'clock tonight.
Because the drill will be held during daylight hours, the "blackout"
will have to be simulated. Campus residents are asked to turn their lights
out promptly at 7p.m. as no air raid warning siren will be sounded.

Air raid wardens, under the di
rection of Professor Dodds, will en
force the blackout. Students will be
evacuated from all University
buildings, such as the library, and
sent to their living groups.
Originally scheduled for last Wed
nesday night, the drill was post
poned until today and scheduled for
the daylight to conform to new reg
ulations issued by the Western De
fense Command of the Fourth Army.
DAYLIGHT DRILLS
These regulations specify that dis
aster drills must be held during the
daylight.
As soon as the drill begins, all
campus traffic will be stopped and
no automobiles will be allowed to
move until the "all clear" at 8 p.m.
About 7:20 p.m., several disasters
will be simulated at various parts
of the campus. These disasters will
be reported through an emergency
telephone system to the Control
Center in the Corporation Yard.
COTTRELL IN CHARGE
Professor Cottrell, in charge of
disaster squads, will be in charge in
the Control Center. As soon as the
disasters are reported, he will dis
patch disaster squads to the scene
of the disaster.
During the drill, officials of the
Civilian Defense Committee will tour
the campus inspecting the blackout
and disaster drill.
