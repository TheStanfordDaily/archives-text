# Farm To Aid Red Cross 'Blood Bank'
## 
### 
A compact white truck marked
with crosses of red will roll into
Palo Alto May 7, and when it leaves
it will carry a cargo of blood des
tined to save the lives of America's
wounded fighting men.
The truck will be a mobile unit of
the American Red Cross blood donor
service. And the blood it takes away
with it will include that of Stanford
men and women.
Twice a month for the next 18
months, Stanford students will have
a chance to make blood donations.
A quota will be assigned the cam
pus Red Cross committee, which will
attend to the sign-up formalities,
make appointments, and provide
transportation.
Stanford's quota for the first day,
a week from Thursday, is only ten,
and the quota is already nearly full,
but students anxious to give blood
should sign up in advance.
Any person over 18 may donate,
but those under 21 must have re
leases from their parents. Blanks
will be circulated among the var
ious eating and living groups, and
may also be obtained in Room 13 in
the Old Union, any afternoon.
Causing no ill effects, blood is
drawn from the donor's arm into a
sterile bottle. The blood will be
taken to a laboratory, centrifuged to
remove the cells from the plasma,
frozen, dried, and powdered.
Pearl Harbor proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt that dried blood
plasma is one of the outstanding
"If you don't have plasma, it's
death; if you do have plasma, it's
mediopl advances of the war,
life."
The 50 pints of blood to be given
in Palo Alto a week from Thursday
will make up part of a national quota
of a million pints the government
has asked the Red Cross to obtain
for it. On subsequent visits of the
truck, 100 to 120 pints will be col
lected here, and the quota of Stan
ford students will probably be 20 or
30 pints.

A compact white truck marked
with crosses of red will roll into
Palo Alto May 7, and when it leaves
it will carry a cargo of blood des
tined to save the lives of America's
wounded fighting men.
The truck will be a mobile unit of
the American Red Cross blood donor
service. And the blood it takes away
with it will include that of Stanford
men and women.
Twice a month for the next 18
months, Stanford students will have
a chance to make blood donations.
A quota will be assigned the cam
pus Red Cross committee, which will
attend to the sign-up formalities,
make appointments, and provide
transportation.
Stanford's quota for the first day,
a week from Thursday, is only ten,
and the quota is already nearly full,
but students anxious to give blood
should sign up in advance.
Any person over 18 may donate,
but those under 21 must have re
leases from their parents. Blanks
will be circulated among the var
ious eating and living groups, and
may also be obtained in Room 13 in
the Old Union, any afternoon.
Causing no ill effects, blood is
drawn from the donor's arm into a
sterile bottle. The blood will be
taken to a laboratory, centrifuged to
remove the cells from the plasma,
frozen, dried, and powdered.
Pearl Harbor proved beyond the
shadow of a doubt that dried blood
plasma is one of the outstanding
"If you don't have plasma, it's
death; if you do have plasma, it's
mediopl advances of the war,
life."
The 50 pints of blood to be given
in Palo Alto a week from Thursday
will make up part of a national quota
of a million pints the government
has asked the Red Cross to obtain
for it. On subsequent visits of the
truck, 100 to 120 pints will be col
lected here, and the quota of Stan
ford students will probably be 20 or
30 pints.
