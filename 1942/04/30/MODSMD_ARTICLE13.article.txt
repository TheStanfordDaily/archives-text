# Japs Take Burma Post; Corregidor Fights Back
## Guns Boom In Biggest Kill of War 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 2!) (UP).—
The yuns of embattled Corrcgidor
achieved perhaps their biggest "kill"
of the war today—blasting Jap troop
: concentrations, siege guns, planes
I and an armed ship.
The rock-girt guardian of Manila
1 Bay, hammered the past two days
by heavy artillery and dive bombers,
! unlcased savage retaliatory blows
which:
I—Silenced some Jap batteries em
placed on the Cavite and Bataan
shores.
2—Sank a medium-size armed
, vessel in Manila Bay.
3—Broke up troop concentrations.
HIT BIG BOMBERS
! 4—Shot down two high-altitude
; bombers—running to at least 40 the
j number of enemy aircraft downed by
; Corrcgidor's sharp - shooting anti
i aircraft gunners since the start of
| the war.
These successes were revealed by
i the War Department in a communi
| que based on reports from General
Douglas Mac Arthur's Australian
! headquarters. A separate communi-
I que issued by Mac Arthur earlier
j told of the destruction of the two
j Jap bombers.
; ATTACKS LESSEN
The reports indicate the Jap air
raids on Corregidor and neighbor
ing forts are "lessening in intensity."
Corregidor alone has been subjected
to more than 250 air raids since De-

cember.
Gun-shy Jap pilots have been
forced to keep at such high alti
tudes that in a majority of raids
their bombs have done a minimum
of damage. Now the enemy appar
ently is depending more and more
upon its heavy artillery to soften
up the fortress which, so long as it
flies the Stars and Stripes, denies
the Japs use of the finest harbor in
the Far East.
