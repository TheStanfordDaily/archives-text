## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 29 (UP).—
The War Labor Board will not freeze
wages under President Roosevelt's
far-reaching anti-inflation program
but it will not permit them to get out
of line with other factors in the na
tional economy. Chairman William
H. Davis said tonight.
He interpreted the President's di
rective to the board to "stabilize the
remuneration of wage earners" to
mean that the agency should pur
sue a "flexible" rather than an ar
bitrary policy in "balancing" the
wage structure.
