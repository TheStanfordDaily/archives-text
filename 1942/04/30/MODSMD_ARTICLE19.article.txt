LONDON, April 2!> (UP).—More
than 4,000 persons — 000 of them
soldiers trapped in barracks—were
killed and thousands of others
maimed in the RAF bombing raids
on Rostock, German Baltic port,
(he Evening Standard said tonight,
quoting a Swedish survivor.

LONDON, April 29 (UP). —RAF
bombers dealt smashing blows at
the German naval bases of Kiel and
Trondheim early today, rounding
out a week's offensive that saw the
German port of Rostok all but oblit
erated from the map and a trail of
devastation spread from the French
coast, through the industrial Ruhr
Valley to the great Skoda munitions
work in Czechoslovakia.
Details of the raids on Germany's
two most important naval bases
were meager, but latest dispatches
from Sweden described the scene at
Rostok, after four successive ni«ht
assaults, as one of "indescribable
horror," from which all but 15,000
emergency workers and wounded ol
the 115,000 population have fled. The
city, site of the Heinkol airplane
factory and supply port for German
armies in Finland, north Russia and
Norway, was leveled.
Luebeck, another German Baltic
port 40 miles west of Rostok, got a
similar blasting in a single RAF
night raid March 28 and recent re
connaissance photographs showed
such devastation there that John
Davies was prompted to arise in the
House of Commons today and de
plore the damage done to non-mili
! tary objectives.
