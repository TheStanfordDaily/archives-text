# 'Car-less' Day Is Big Success
## 
### 
Characterized as a "great success"
by the consumer committee, "Car
less Wednesday" came to the Farm
yesterday as the campus walked to
class to aid the war effort.
According to George Hellyer, co
chairman, the number of cars in the
libe lot was more than cut in half
and most of those there belonged to
people coming from off-campus. He
asked for everyone's co-operation in
future car-less days, which will be
held regularly.
Meanwhile, Dodie Crile, other
head of the committee, reported that
it will open an office tomorrow in
Room 13 of the Old Union. Every
one interested in consumer educa
tion is asked to drop by there or
call L 513.
As part of its campaign to keep
the students informed on ways they
can aid the war effort, the committee
is planning an exhibit in the library
and has informative literature avail
able at the office. Weekly discus
sions by professors like the talks
Tuesday by Dr. Kreps and Dr. Haley
will be continued.
