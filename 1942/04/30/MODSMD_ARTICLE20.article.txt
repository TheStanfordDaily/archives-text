# Army Interviews Students Tonight
## 
### 
Major Jay K. Montgomery of
Stockton Field will head a board of
army officers interviewing students
interested in Air Cadet Training in
Room 100 on the Inner Quad tonight
at 7:30. Major Montgomery will re
turn to the campus the second week
in May to secure enlistments.
The Army Air Corps is instituting
a plan similar to the Navy's "V"
classifications, by which college stu
dents and high school seniors are
deferred until they have completed
an additional year of school, or un
til such time as the Secretary of
War deems it necessary to call them
to active duty.
