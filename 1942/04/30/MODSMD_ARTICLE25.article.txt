LOS ANGELES, April 21) (UP).
— Southern California radio sta
tions were ordered silenced to
night at 10:21 and San Diego wan

CHUNGKING, April 20 (UP).—
Japanese troops have smashed into
the south suburbs of Lashio and
Chinese defenders are battling them
from behind hastily erected barri
cades in a last stand to save the
Burma Road, the lifeline between
Burma and China, it was reported
unofficially tonight.
(A Chinese communique broadcast
by the Chungking radio and heard
in London substantiated this re
port and said that the Japanese had
also reached Hsipaw, west of Lashio,
cutting the rail spur from the Burma
Road terminus to Mandalay.)
ANOTHER JAP COLUMN
Another Japanese column was re
ported storming the approaches of
the railway town of Hsipaw, 40
miles west of Lashio, and the whole
Burma campaign appeared to rest
with a Chinese force racing east
from the central front in a desperate
attempt to sever the communications
of the invader spearheads.
With the enemy virtually in La
shio and Hsipaw, Allied sources held
out little hope that this gamble
would succeed. Its failure would
mean loss of the Burma Road ter
minus at Lashio, isolation of Manda
law and the Burma armies, and leave
as the United Nations' only access to
China the tortuous mountain trail
running across northern India and
Burma through Bhamo, 100 miles
north of Lashio, and eventually to
the Burma Road.
FOLLOWS HOPEFUL REPORTS
The reports of new Japanese gains
came just after Allied military
sources had expressed hope that the
desperate Burma situation might be
relieved.
They said this situation had "defi
nitely improved" since Saturday by
arrival of reinforcements, although
the Japanese were reported contin
uing their advance and had reached
within 30 to 40 miles of the railroad
at Hsipaw and within 50 to GO miles
of Lashio itself.

nitely improved" since Saturday by
arrival of reinforcements, although
the Japanese were reported contin
uing their advance and had reached
within 30 to 40 miles of the railroad

of Lashio itself.

CHUNGKING, April 20 (UP).—
Japanese troops have smashed into
the south suburbs of Lashio and
Chinese defenders are battling them
from behind hastily erected barri
cades in a last stand to save the
Burma Road, the lifeline between
Burma and China, it was reported
unofficially tonight.
(A Chinese communique broadcast
by the Chungking radio and heard
in London substantiated this re
port and said that the Japanese had
also reached Hsipaw, west of Lashio,
cutting the rail spur from the Burma
Road terminus to Mandalay.)
ANOTHER JAP COLUMN
Another Japanese column was re
ported storming the approaches of
the railway town of Hsipaw, 40
miles west of Lashio, and the whole
Burma campaign appeared to rest
with a Chinese force racing east
from the central front in a desperate
attempt to sever the communications
of the invader spearheads.
With the enemy virtually in La
shio and Hsipaw, Allied sources held
out little hope that this gamble
would succeed. Its failure would
mean loss of the Burma Road ter
minus at Lashio, isolation of Manda
law and the Burma armies, and leave
as the United Nations' only access to
China the tortuous mountain trail
running across northern India and
Burma through Bhamo, 100 miles
north of Lashio, and eventually to
the Burma Road.
FOLLOWS HOPEFUL REPORTS
The reports of new Japanese gains
came just after Allied military
sources had expressed hope that the
desperate Burma situation might be
relieved.
They said this situation had "defi
nitely improved" since Saturday by
arrival of reinforcements, although
the Japanese were reported contin
uing their advance and had reached
within 30 to 40 miles of the railroad
at Hsipaw and within 50 to GO miles
