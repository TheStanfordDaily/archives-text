# JANITRESSES TAKE OVER
## 
### NEWT WISE 
i There was a yell and an amazed
( Toyon resident, wearing his bathrobe
for the first time this year, rushed
down the hail and into his neigh
i bur's room.
.."There's a woman in my room!"..
"Well, then what are you doing in
here?" his neighbor replied.
With an equal mixture of surprise
and objection residents of men's
| dorms were last week confronted
! with women janitors for the first
j time in the Stanford-rough history, i
CAUTION
Mothballs were shaken out of bath- i
! robes and cautious glances preceded
-t hallway. But by the
â€¢ ?ck. however, hall men
-ad to admit their rooms were
cleaner, and that color had returned
to the rugs replacing a layer ol
dust.
The introduction of women as |
| University janitors became necessary
I last week because of the shortage of
I the caliber of men that have been
| employed in the past, according to
J John M. Brown, branch manager of
j the American Building and Mainte
nance Company. "There are about
nine women working at present," he
said.
MEN NOT AVAILABLE
Mr. Brown emphasized that it is
not necessary to have women and i
that he could probably use men dur- j
ing the war, but they would not be
as dependable as the men have been
in past, years.
Most of the janitors have been
working for the University for 15 to
20 years. Out of the staff of 50 men, |
12 thus far have volunteered or have
been drafted into the army. Three
were inducted during the past week,
and two more will go into the army

this week.
Women as janitors were first pro
posed by Dean John Bunn over a
year ago. With the increasing turn
over in men, it was decided to use
married women who could be relied
on to stay with the job fof years.
Mr. Brown hopes to add a wing to
the janitors' quarters to house mar
ried couples who will work for the
University. Three married couples
will start work next week.
When Mr. Brown came to Stan-

lord 20 years ago Japs were em
ployed as janitors. "War will change
the whole picture of the janitor set
up," he said. In the past changes
were made during the war which
continued after the war, and this will
be the case this time," he predicted.
The A.B.M.C. has put on 250 wom
en in the past week.
Eastern colleges have had jani
toresses for several years, the most
notable being Columbia and Har
vard.
