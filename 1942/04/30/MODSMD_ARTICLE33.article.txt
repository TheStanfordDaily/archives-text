## 
### 
With their sugar allotment cut to
50 per cent of last year's consump
tion, the Union Cellar began yester
day to serve sugar in individual,
one-teaspoon packages.
Only those who are entitled to
sugar with their orders will be given
the packages, according to Miss
Ricker, director of dining halls.
"Students must learn to co-operate
and not ask for sugar if they don't
need it," stated Miss Ricker. "The
less sugar individuals use, the more
we will have to use in desserts and
other sugar-containing foods for the
larger dining units," she stressed.
Coca-Cola supplies in the Union
Cellar and Encina Store are getting
low, but cokes are still purchasable
on campus. There will, however, be
no more tuna fish sandwiches, for
the cost of tuna would force the
sandwiches to sell for 40 or 50 cents
apiece.
