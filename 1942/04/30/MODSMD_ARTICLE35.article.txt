This year, under the leadership of j
Class President Don Dillon, all ac- j

The first function is also something j

Executive Committee had to get a ;
new word for it: SCRUNCH.
Scrunch will start in the late
afternoon on Friday. Saturday after- :
noon is the Junior Water Carnival, ;
and at night, the Junior Prom, fea
turing the peerless rhythms of Ernie i
Lewis. A Sadler Series movie will j
conclude the activities on Sunday
night.
Tickets for the Prom went on sale
yesterday at the A.S.S.U. offices, the i
tariff being $2.20.

bronzed brawn of the Farm will be
on display for feminine approval.
Saturday night, May 10, Stanford
