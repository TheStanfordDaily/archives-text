# Betas Bow To Dailymen By 7-5 Count
## 
### 
Five lopsided wins and one fairly
tight fracas featured yesterday after
noon's second round intramural
soft hall games.
George Kaufman, pitching for The
Daily ten, held the slugging Betas
down to a mere 5 runs in 7 innings
despite some fielding gems hy the
rest of the outfit.
Although doubles by Kaufman, A1
liampson, and "Salty" Sontag were :
the Daily s extra base blows, they
were bunehed so that all counted, j
'Bulge" Allen's single with the

bases bulging knocked in two more !
counters. The final Daily tally of 7
runs was more than adequate to sub
merge the Beta Thetes.
BKIiCKNEK AGAIN
In the same league the Alpha !
Delts chalked up their second run
away while Bob Breckner
chalked up his second impressive
hurling win, and while Pete Gadd
chalked up his second four-bagger
of the season. Their victims were
the El Campo team, the final score I
being 12-3.
The Theta Delts bunched five runs i
in the first inning to lead the El I
Capitans all the way. Harry Bacon
pitched the 6-2 win for the Theta
Delts.
PHI DELTS WIN. 14-1
The Phi Delts behind the chucking
of Barney Olson had an easy time j
with the Alpha Sigs, winning 14-1.
The afternoon's other two games
were both highlighted by two-hit
hurling performances by the win
ning pitchers.
Hinzie turned the trick for the
Kappa Sig II team in their 11-1 win
over the Phi Sigs, while Harry
Boothe led the Theta Chis to victory
over the Sig Alphs, 7-2.-
