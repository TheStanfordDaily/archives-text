| >ILEI) into the Excom meeting Tuesday night was an overflow crowd.
Most of them were there to lobby one way or the other on the rugby
situation.
To run through a cross-section of the crowd—George Jackson, Pat
Adams, Coach Harry Maloney, Nancy Burkett, Chuck Taylor. Patty Bou
chard. Bob Collins, Peggy Boothe, Roger Laverty, Larry Dee, Betty Gunn.
Ted Schroeder, Duke Hammett, Bob Morton, Ralph Clark, "Shaf" Shafer!
Ted Cole, George Jedenoff, Don Dillon, "Eggs" Stone, Howard Council Hap
Everett, Jerry Mayer, Dick Driscoll, Tiff Denton, Leslie Langnecker
Ed Stamm.
' Out of this milling maze came a decision to shelve the whole question.
I Hap Everett, Daily associate editor, was there and took copious notes So
j here he is.
Take it, Hap.
I've got it. Davy.
Ex Committee staged the longest argument of the year Tuesday night
and the discussion included so many intresting viewpoints that we're pass
ing them on to you. The following conversation is not verbatim:
lIARRY MALONEY: I've always left things like this to the student
it is entirely your matter . . . about 1915 we broke with Cal because
they wouldn't play if we used frosh on the rugby team . . . I've taken
teams composed mainly of Stanford men to Europe and won the world
championship at Brussels in 1920 and Paris in 1924 . . . look through your
old Quads and you'll see that we've had as many as 225 men out for
rugby in one season . . . we even used to have a faculty team; the faculty
was young then . . . I've started rugby teams playing at 10 in the morn
ing and still been refereeing when the sun went down . . . there haw been
days when six outside clubs have taken on Stanford teams in a single
day . . . last season we had two sprained ankles out of 107 men ... Jim
Wylie on several occasions has driven down here from Sacramento at
his own expense to coach the team . . . $1300 covered all expenses last
year . . . the chief surgeon on the H.M.S. Orion, one of the British rugby
players here this winter, said that after playing all over the Empire he had
never seen better sportsmanship than that exhibited by Stanford.
CHUCK TAYLOR: Making rugby a major sport will take the interest
out of it ... if conducted as such, the men would have to train and you
wouldn't get football players out who have already gotten their glory and
are just out to relax and for the fun of the game . . . it's the love of the
game now and you might make the Block S award the sole object of
going out ... if anything, golf has earned the right to major sport status
... it v/ill take more funds because you must dress like a major sport,
etc. ... it would lower prestige of Stanford for the guys to buy .their
own Blocks . . . rugby doesn't develop football players as you claim, but
football makes rugby.
DEE: Football may be on the way out . . . rugby is similar to football
and is coming up ... no action should be taken this year . . . wait and
see how important rugby becomes.
JEDENOFF: Let's make this thing flexible ... in the future circum
stances may warrant a paid coach.
ADAMS: We wouldn't want a major sport team from Stanford to
appear on the field in cast-off uniforms, etc.
JEDENOFF: We look respectable enough on the field if that's what you
mean.
lIAMMETT: You don't really have to work as regularly or as hard
in rugby as in football . . . there is a shortage of athletic manpower here
now and adding another sport would detract from supply of athletes.
DEE: Stanford will look silly, going against the trend.
COLE: In rugby you go all the time, while in football you have signal
drill with half the men sitting around.
lIAMMETT: If anyone can go out, as you say, rugby isn't a major
sport...it will cheapen the Block S.
STAMM: There are two groups...the hard workers like Jedenoff
and the relaxers like Kmetovic who have worked hard at football in the
fall and want to have a good time in the winter...if rugby is put on a
"must win" basis, you \yon't have such a large turnout. . .successful
coaches have to cut squads for efficiency.
A few more times around the horn and the thing was voted on. Despite
cheering under Jackson's window and the last ditch stand of "Paddy"
Driscoll, rugby was beaten 7-2.

Ex Committee staged the longest argument of the year Tuesday night
and the discussion included so many intresting viewpoints that we're pass
ing them on to you. The following conversation is not verbatim:
lIARRY MALONEY: I've always left things like this to the student
it is entirely your matter . . . about 1915 we broke with Cal because
they wouldn't play if we used frosh on the rugby team . . . I've taken
teams composed mainly of Stanford men to Europe and won the world
championship at Brussels in 1920 and Paris in 1924 . . . look through your
old Quads and you'll see that we've had as many as 225 men out for
rugby in one season . . . we even used to have a faculty team; the faculty
was young then . . . I've started rugby teams playing at 10 in the morn
ing and still been refereeing when the sun went down . . . there haw been
days when six outside clubs have taken on Stanford teams in a single
day . . . last season we had two sprained ankles out of 107 men ... Jim
Wylie on several occasions has driven down here from Sacramento at
his own expense to coach the team . . . $1300 covered all expenses last
year . . . the chief surgeon on the H.M.S. Orion, one of the British rugby
players here this winter, said that after playing all over the Empire he had
never seen better sportsmanship than that exhibited by Stanford.
CHUCK TAYLOR: Making rugby a major sport will take the interest
out of it ... if conducted as such, the men would have to train and you
wouldn't get football players out who have already gotten their glory and
are just out to relax and for the fun of the game . . . it's the love of the
game now and you might make the Block S award the sole object of
going out ... if anything, golf has earned the right to major sport status
... it v/ill take more funds because you must dress like a major sport,
etc. ... it would lower prestige of Stanford for the guys to buy .their
own Blocks . . . rugby doesn't develop football players as you claim, but
football makes rugby.
DEE: Football may be on the way out . . . rugby is similar to football
and is coming up ... no action should be taken this year . . . wait and
see how important rugby becomes.
JEDENOFF: Let's make this thing flexible ... in the future circum
stances may warrant a paid coach.
ADAMS: We wouldn't want a major sport team from Stanford to
appear on the field in cast-off uniforms, etc.
JEDENOFF: We look respectable enough on the field if that's what you
mean.
lIAMMETT: You don't really have to work as regularly or as hard
in rugby as in football . . . there is a shortage of athletic manpower here
now and adding another sport would detract from supply of athletes.
DEE: Stanford will look silly, going against the trend.
COLE: In rugby you go all the time, while in football you have signal
drill with half the men sitting around.
lIAMMETT: If anyone can go out, as you say, rugby isn't a major
sport...it will cheapen the Block S.
STAMM: There are two groups...the hard workers like Jedenoff
and the relaxers like Kmetovic who have worked hard at football in the
fall and want to have a good time in the winter...if rugby is put on a
"must win" basis, you \yon't have such a large turnout. . .successful
coaches have to cut squads for efficiency.
A few more times around the horn and the thing was voted on. Despite
cheering under Jackson's window and the last ditch stand of "Paddy"
Driscoll, rugby was beaten 7-2.

days when six outside clubs have taken on Stanford teams in a single
day . . . last season we had two sprained ankles out of 107 men ... Jim
Wylie on several occasions has driven down here from Sacramento at
his own expense to coach the team . . . $1300 covered all expenses last
year . . . the chief surgeon on the H.M.S. Orion, one of the British rugby
players here this winter, said that after playing all over the Empire he had
never seen better sportsmanship than that exhibited by Stanford.
CHUCK TAYLOR: Making rugby a major sport will take the interest
out of it ... if conducted as such, the men would have to train and you
wouldn't get football players out who have already gotten their glory and
are just out to relax and for the fun of the game . . . it's the love of the
game now and you might make the Block S award the sole object of
going out ... if anything, golf has earned the right to major sport status
... it v/ill take more funds because you must dress like a major sport,
etc. ... it would lower prestige of Stanford for the guys to buy .their
own Blocks . . . rugby doesn't develop football players as you claim, but
football makes rugby.
DEE: Football may be on the way out . . . rugby is similar to football
and is coming up ... no action should be taken this year . . . wait and
see how important rugby becomes.
JEDENOFF: Let's make this thing flexible ... in the future circum
stances may warrant a paid coach.
ADAMS: We wouldn't want a major sport team from Stanford to
appear on the field in cast-off uniforms, etc.
JEDENOFF: We look respectable enough on the field if that's what you
mean.
lIAMMETT: You don't really have to work as regularly or as hard
in rugby as in football . . . there is a shortage of athletic manpower here
now and adding another sport would detract from supply of athletes.
DEE: Stanford will look silly, going against the trend.
COLE: In rugby you go all the time, while in football you have signal
drill with half the men sitting around.
lIAMMETT: If anyone can go out, as you say, rugby isn't a major
sport...it will cheapen the Block S.
STAMM: There are two groups...the hard workers like Jedenoff
and the relaxers like Kmetovic who have worked hard at football in the
fall and want to have a good time in the winter...if rugby is put on a
"must win" basis, you \yon't have such a large turnout. . .successful
coaches have to cut squads for efficiency.
A few more times around the horn and the thing was voted on. Despite
cheering under Jackson's window and the last ditch stand of "Paddy"
Driscoll, rugby was beaten 7-2.

Most of them were there to lobby one way or the other on the rugby
situation.

lIARRY MALONEY: I've always left things like this to the student
it is entirely your matter . . . about 1915 we broke with Cal because
they wouldn't play if we used frosh on the rugby team . . . I've taken
teams composed mainly of Stanford men to Europe and won the world
championship at Brussels in 1920 and Paris in 1924 . . . look through your
old Quads and you'll see that we've had as many as 225 men out for
rugby in one season . . . we even used to have a faculty team; the faculty
