# Papoose Nine Takes 8 of 15
## 
### 
Suffering from coaching changes
in mid-season, weak hitting power,
£'nd maybe a general cases of the
blues while watching their varsity
brethren eased out of the C.1.8.A.
race, the Stanford frosh nine has
come through the 1942 season with
an eight out of 15 average.
At the start of the season it looked
as if Harry Shipkey was saddled with
j the joyous job of coaching a win
: ner. In four straight, the yearlings
crushed top high school nines—
Commerce, Mission, Galileo, and
Washington.
The Ides of February 26 and Bal
boa put the first puncture in the
balloon with a 2 to 0 defeat. San
Mateo J.C., San Jose High (a dis
reputable outfit if the angry doodles
! in the score book njean anything),
and St. Ignatius' sank Shipkey's
i ship in one-two-three order.
CAL SMASHED
April 2 and victory over Berkeley,
5 to 4, initiated a new era which
included a smashing 7 to 4 win over
Cal in the first of the annual two
out-of-three with the Berkeley gang.
Moffelt Field and Treasure Island
; Naval Base were beaten between
April 2 and 7.
Cal came back with a vengeance,
10 runs worth. Gaining six coun
ters in the first and four in the fifth,
the Cubs broke through and all over
the Card defense, 10 to 3.

The locals bounced back in the
; win column with an absolute slaugh
! ter of Menlo, 18 to 2, polling 11 runs
I in the first two frames.
The finale added up to the same
: equations that the football and hoop
; acts used—a win over Cal equals a
| good season. A loss equals that kind
j of a season which you can call what
j ever you please, only stay away from
j the players when you call it.
! CAL SMASHES
Cal showed up, led 4 to 1 in the
fifth. They jinxed a Stanford rally,
got one in the sixth, two in the
seventh, and capped it with a run in
the eighth to make the final count
8 to 1.

Extra pressure in the tires this
year may mean extra miles next
year.
