# Chances Slight For Track Win
## 
### 
I Stanford's chances of winning
| many points in the weight events in
( Saturday's Pacific Association meet
J at Berkeley left yesterday aboard the
S.P. when Ed Stamm headed for
Montana to attend a student body
i presidents' meeting.
Although Hank Norberg is still
entered in the discus and A1 Pande
| and Ernie Peninou are going to throw
! the javelin, the competition in these
events should be more than they
can handle.
Pande, however, might get in the
money if he maintains his rapid
improvement. His 185-foot throw in
the Big Meet was better than five
feet better than he had ever done
before. His competition includes
Cal's Bob Biles and Johnny Mottram
of the Olympic Club.
