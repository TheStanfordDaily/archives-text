dom, will play the 107<h United
States Cavalary polo team from Fort
Ord tomorrow at 4 p.m. The game
will be played on the Highway Polo
Field.
The 107 th Cavalry team is one of
I the most powerful outfits i.. the
! country. They have record wins over
; Culver, Harvard, West Point, Cor
| nell, Princeton, and Yale. Their
game with Yale was one of the best
of the season as Yale is the eastern
| intercollegiate champion this year.
TEAMWORK
The 107 th is the old Ohio National
Guard outfit. The members of the
team have been playing polo to
gether for a good many years and
j show excellent teamwork. Perhaps
| the only thing that might keep the
cavalry four from trouncing the
Stanfords is the fact that they have
not had much practice since they
have been stationed at Fort Ord.
Lieutenant Charles Undercoffer,
who plays number 3 for the visitors
and captains the team, announces a
starting lineup of Lieutenant Elmer
Peters at 1, Lieutenant Rieder
Schell at 2, and Colonel Woods King
at number 4.

j week, is trying a line-up for the
Cards of Bill Dirker at 1, Ben Snure
lat 2, Mike Gates at 3, and Bob
Grainger at the number 4 spot.
Both teams are scheduling another
game to be played here on May 9.
