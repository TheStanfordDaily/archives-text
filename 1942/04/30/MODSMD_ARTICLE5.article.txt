# Pan-Hell Dance Aids Red Cross
## Music and Dancing On Row Friday Night 
### 
Full moon . . . soft music . . .
dancing under the stars . . .
It's the May Day street dance Fri
day night on the upper Row from 8
to 11:30, where dates are accepted
and stags welcomed.
Sponsored by Pan-Hellenic Coun
cil for the American Red Cross, this
dance is one of Stanford's first bene
fits for that organization at which
they have permitted the Red Cross
name to be used, according to
sorority officials.
ON THE ROW
The dance will be held on the up
per Row in front of the Alpha Phi
and Alpha Delt houses and that
portion of the street will be blocked
off for the evening.
Records will provide the music
for the dancing and several old
fashioned group dances have been
planned, including a schottische, ac
cording to Janet Atkinson, decora
tions chairman.
Several outdoor concessions are
being constructed along the Row at
which sorority women will sell coca
cola, ice cream, and hot dogs for the
hungry and the charity-minded. All
the money taken in on these con
cessions will be donated in full to
the Red Cross.
DATES NOT NECESSARY
Dates are not necessary to attend
the street dance, according to Pan
Hellenic Council. Stags are wel
comed and may buy tickets at the
dance at 25 cents a person. "This
dance is strictly informal and the
more cutting-in the better," said
Leslie Langnecker, general chair
man of the dance.
Tickets will be on sale all this
week at the A.S.S.U. office for the
j dance at 50 cents a couple.
