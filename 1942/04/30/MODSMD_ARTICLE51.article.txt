# Boch Caruso Out In Bronco Tilt
## 
### 
When the Stanford baseball team i
meets Santa Clara Saturday on the i
Sunken Diamond in the last game of
the season, they will be playing with
out the services of their captain,
Boeh Caruso.
Two weeks ago Caruso hurt his
ankle in a practice slide into third
base, and was kept out of several
games. He returned to the line-up
against Cal last week in the fifth
inning. In his first time at bat he !
sent a hard single to right field, but
pulled up lame at first base. He
was replaced by Dick Middleton.
Coach Harry Wolter will probably J
send his star hurlrr, Harry Dyck,
against the Broncos, coached by
Leonard Casanova.
