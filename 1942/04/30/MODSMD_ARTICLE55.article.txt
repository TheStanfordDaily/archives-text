# Blackout and Black Marks
## 
### 
WHILE there may have been weak spots
in last night's blackout-disaster rehearsal,
the hour-long drill can be chalked up as an
other Stanford contribution toward ultimate vic
tory.
One criticism, however, which recurred last
night during the simulated disaster was of the
fraternity men playing ball in front of their
houses on and off the Row. While it might be
asserted that it is good training for the first aid
crews to work "under fire," it seemed incon
gruous to see the antics of a few fraternity men
who like to be seen in front of their houses
overshadow the sober contributions of first aid
ers and civilian defense officials.
The Sigma Nu's, the Theta Chi's and Encina
earned themselves a black mark on the report
of rehearsal authorities by gleefully heaving
waterbags at "casualties" stretched out on the
ground. Stanford progresses no faster than its
slowest thinkers.
But on the whole, the rehearsal was termed
a success by civilian defense officials. As many
additional drills as are deemed necessary
should be planned, however, because work
which has become routine means cool heads
and high morale.
