# Looking Ahead
## 
### 
STANFORD'S present student government of
ficials are planning a series of interviews
with incoming leaders to acguaint the new
comers with some of the problems they may
face in office.
In view of the fact that many of the new
student body officers will serve this summer
quarter in addition to the regular term, and
that this coming term will be very important
from national and international angles, these
conferences, arranged by Pat Adams, A.S.S.U.
vice-president, should prove valuable. â€” Hap
