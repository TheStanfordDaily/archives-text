# And It Will Do Good
## 
### 
TOMORROW night Pan-Hell is giving a street
dance on upper Lasuen. At first glance this
sounds like another big publicity stunt dreamed
up by the sororities to entertain their guests on
the streets of the Farm.
But there is a real significance to the dance.
All of the proceeds from the bids and from the
ice cream, coke, and hot dog concessions will
go to the Red Cross. But still the thought of
helping the Red Cross does not particularly
arouse those who say "We are always giving
for the Red Cross."
Possibly a review of the headlines of the
week will refresh the minds of those who are
dubious about the work of this great national
organization. To bring cases close to home, one
needs only to mention the tragic tornado which
struck Oklahoma and surrounding territory the
first part of the week.
The Red Cross is in that area now helping to
care for the injured, locating relatives of the
dead, and providing shelter for the homeless.
With such a tremendous task to perform, the
element of financial aid is always a big factor.
No matter how much we have already con
tributed for the Red Cross, it can always use
as much as we can possibly afford.
Then on the battlefronts where the horrors
are more brutal, the Red Cross circulates among
the men to comfort and assist them and give
them cigarettes and other luxuries which make
them feel that they are not forgotten by those
at home.
Besides helping the Red Cross, tomorrow's
dance falls right in line with the Stanford policy
of on-campus entertainment. Those smooth
tires and empty gas tanks will be spared for an
evening.
Although girls do the inviting, stags are en
couraged to attend the affair, which lasts from
8 to 11:30 p.m. Why not enjoy yourself and at
the same time help a worthy cause?— John Hor
