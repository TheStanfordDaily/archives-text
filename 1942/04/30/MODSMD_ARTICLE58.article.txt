# Not Flattened
## 
### 
LAST week's Big Meet showed that Stanford
is not flattened by a poor season.
Not only did a bunch of Pitch Johnson's men
come through in fine style, showing much im
provement, but the crowd really outdid itself
in booting home those important second place
men.
Apparently local fans realized that for a while
the record for Big Meet point total was in dan
ger, and, although there was no chance to win
the meet, there was something to fight for. —
