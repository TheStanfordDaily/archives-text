### AMIE REICHERT 
AMERICANS are a funny people, all right. Per
haps some day some eminent anthropologist will
find that the missing link between the anthropoids and
the American people is some variety of the ostrich
species and if Lindbergh is President, the scientist will
undoubtedly receive the Congressional medal.
It might prove a very handy theory, it might ex
plain a lot of things. I think I shall propose this theory
and you can all write it in on the last pages of your
biology books. One paragraph after Darwin. Let it be
known as the Ostrich Theory of Evolution, or, for
short, the OTE.
I'll tell you how I came to make this discovery.
I'll tell you the evidence that supports it: The circula
tion figures for the San Francisco newspapers show
an alarming drop on the day Singapore fell—a drop far
below usual. Again on the day Bataan fell the circu
lation figures were a way down. But, on the day
Tokyo was bombed the circulation soared and broke
a couple of records.

might take a look at some of the publications
of the third French Republic (1875-1941). Take a
look at some of the newspapers during the years when
Hitler was rattling his saber at the gates of Paris. You
will find a mountain of evidence for Ostrich Theory of
Evolution with reference to the French people.
Robert Benchley once wrote a short piece about
French newspapers which used to be funny in the
days before Hitler came, but which now is no longer
funny but sad. Benchley exaggerated, to be sure, when
he said that the front page stories were (1) Report
of a fishing trip to Newfoundland, complete with
pictures; (2) Third installment in the life of Rousseau;
(3) Twt) murders and one blackmail case. Then on
the inside, page three or thereabouts, Benchley says
there was a small item at the bottom which reported
that the British had dug a tunnel under the English
Channel; another that Germany had declared war.
Of course that is exaggeration. But it is well
founded exaggeration. The French newspapers were
the most corrupt institution — possibly excepting the
government—in pre-Hitler France and everyone knew
it. Their editorial columns could be bought by any
foreign power for a hundred francs. And nobody ever
did anything about this terrible state of things until
Adolf Hitler decided the situation needed cleaning up
so he sent Joe Goebbels with a couple of» panzer divi
sions and they fixed up the French press permanently.

¥N AMERICA we are blessed with the greatest free
press in the world, excepting Great Britain, and we
should therefore have one of the most alert, best-in
formed, most intelligent people in the world. We have
a press that gives us the bad news along wtih the
good. In Germany the press simply gives the good
news, and, these days, turns defeats into victories, by
the simple process of pure fabrication and wish
thinking. German morale is cracking these days, but
that is because the people are just finding out that
they have been lied to and tricked. As long as Hitler
was able to keep the veils over their eyes and the
press muzzled, however, everything was all right.
But aren't the peoples of democracy strong enough,
intelligent enough to take defeats, to try to understand
them, to face them and prepare to reverse them? It
looks as though we don't even want to hear about
them. It looks as though we are imposing a voluntary
censorship upon our minds. It looks as though we are
tricking ourselves into a state of complacency.
Some day a bigger shock than Singapore, a greater
defeat than Bataan may force the American ostriches
to withdraw their heads from the sand, and if that day
should come, we will not be able to stand the shock
any more than the German people are standing it now.
We will not be able to sustain our morale because we
will have deliberately nourished it on a false diet of
sugar-coated pills and rose-tinted communiques.

Channel; another that Germany had declared war.
Of course that is exaggeration. But it is well
founded exaggeration. The French newspapers were
the most corrupt institution — possibly excepting the
government—in pre-Hitler France and everyone knew
it. Their editorial columns could be bought by any
foreign power for a hundred francs. And nobody ever
did anything about this terrible state of things until
Adolf Hitler decided the situation needed cleaning up
so he sent Joe Goebbels with a couple of» panzer divi
sions and they fixed up the French press permanently.

¥N AMERICA we are blessed with the greatest free
press in the world, excepting Great Britain, and we
should therefore have one of the most alert, best-in
formed, most intelligent people in the world. We have
a press that gives us the bad news along wtih the
good. In Germany the press simply gives the good
news, and, these days, turns defeats into victories, by
the simple process of pure fabrication and wish
thinking. German morale is cracking these days, but
that is because the people are just finding out that
they have been lied to and tricked. As long as Hitler
was able to keep the veils over their eyes and the
press muzzled, however, everything was all right.
But aren't the peoples of democracy strong enough,
intelligent enough to take defeats, to try to understand
them, to face them and prepare to reverse them? It
looks as though we don't even want to hear about
them. It looks as though we are imposing a voluntary
censorship upon our minds. It looks as though we are
tricking ourselves into a state of complacency.
Some day a bigger shock than Singapore, a greater
defeat than Bataan may force the American ostriches
to withdraw their heads from the sand, and if that day
should come, we will not be able to stand the shock
any more than the German people are standing it now.
We will not be able to sustain our morale because we
will have deliberately nourished it on a false diet of
sugar-coated pills and rose-tinted communiques.
AMERICANS are a funny people, all right. Per
haps some day some eminent anthropologist will
find that the missing link between the anthropoids and
the American people is some variety of the ostrich
species and if Lindbergh is President, the scientist will
undoubtedly receive the Congressional medal.
It might prove a very handy theory, it might ex
plain a lot of things. I think I shall propose this theory
and you can all write it in on the last pages of your
biology books. One paragraph after Darwin. Let it be
known as the Ostrich Theory of Evolution, or, for
short, the OTE.
I'll tell you how I came to make this discovery.
I'll tell you the evidence that supports it: The circula
tion figures for the San Francisco newspapers show
an alarming drop on the day Singapore fell—a drop far
below usual. Again on the day Bataan fell the circu
lation figures were a way down. But, on the day
Tokyo was bombed the circulation soared and broke
a couple of records.

might take a look at some of the publications
of the third French Republic (1875-1941). Take a
look at some of the newspapers during the years when
Hitler was rattling his saber at the gates of Paris. You

Evolution with reference to the French people.
Robert Benchley once wrote a short piece about
French newspapers which used to be funny in the
days before Hitler came, but which now is no longer
funny but sad. Benchley exaggerated, to be sure, when
he said that the front page stories were (1) Report
of a fishing trip to Newfoundland, complete with
pictures; (2) Third installment in the life of Rousseau;
(3) Twt) murders and one blackmail case. Then on
the inside, page three or thereabouts, Benchley says
there was a small item at the bottom which reported
that the British had dug a tunnel under the English
Channel; another that Germany had declared war.

AMERICANS are a funny people, all right. Per
haps some day some eminent anthropologist will
find that the missing link between the anthropoids and
the American people is some variety of the ostrich
species and if Lindbergh is President, the scientist will
undoubtedly receive the Congressional medal.
It might prove a very handy theory, it might ex
plain a lot of things. I think I shall propose this theory
and you can all write it in on the last pages of your
biology books. One paragraph after Darwin. Let it be
known as the Ostrich Theory of Evolution, or, for
short, the OTE.
I'll tell you how I came to make this discovery.
I'll tell you the evidence that supports it: The circula
tion figures for the San Francisco newspapers show
an alarming drop on the day Singapore fell—a drop far
below usual. Again on the day Bataan fell the circu
lation figures were a way down. But, on the day
Tokyo was bombed the circulation soared and broke
a couple of records.

might take a look at some of the publications
of the third French Republic (1875-1941). Take a
look at some of the newspapers during the years when
Hitler was rattling his saber at the gates of Paris. You
will find a mountain of evidence for Ostrich Theory of
Evolution with reference to the French people.
Robert Benchley once wrote a short piece about
French newspapers which used to be funny in the
days before Hitler came, but which now is no longer
funny but sad. Benchley exaggerated, to be sure, when
he said that the front page stories were (1) Report
of a fishing trip to Newfoundland, complete with
pictures; (2) Third installment in the life of Rousseau;
(3) Twt) murders and one blackmail case. Then on
the inside, page three or thereabouts, Benchley says
there was a small item at the bottom which reported
that the British had dug a tunnel under the English
Channel; another that Germany had declared war.
Of course that is exaggeration. But it is well
founded exaggeration. The French newspapers were
the most corrupt institution — possibly excepting the
government—in pre-Hitler France and everyone knew
it. Their editorial columns could be bought by any
foreign power for a hundred francs. And nobody ever
did anything about this terrible state of things until
Adolf Hitler decided the situation needed cleaning up
so he sent Joe Goebbels with a couple of» panzer divi
sions and they fixed up the French press permanently.

¥N AMERICA we are blessed with the greatest free
press in the world, excepting Great Britain, and we
should therefore have one of the most alert, best-in
formed, most intelligent people in the world. We have
a press that gives us the bad news along wtih the
good. In Germany the press simply gives the good
news, and, these days, turns defeats into victories, by
the simple process of pure fabrication and wish
thinking. German morale is cracking these days, but
that is because the people are just finding out that
they have been lied to and tricked. As long as Hitler
was able to keep the veils over their eyes and the
press muzzled, however, everything was all right.
But aren't the peoples of democracy strong enough,
intelligent enough to take defeats, to try to understand
them, to face them and prepare to reverse them? It
looks as though we don't even want to hear about
them. It looks as though we are imposing a voluntary
censorship upon our minds. It looks as though we are
tricking ourselves into a state of complacency.
Some day a bigger shock than Singapore, a greater
defeat than Bataan may force the American ostriches
to withdraw their heads from the sand, and if that day
should come, we will not be able to stand the shock
any more than the German people are standing it now.
We will not be able to sustain our morale because we
will have deliberately nourished it on a false diet of
sugar-coated pills and rose-tinted communiques.
