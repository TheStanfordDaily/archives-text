# Co-op Exchange Schedules Dance
## 
### 
An informal dance open to all the
campus will be given by the Co-op
Book Exchange on Friday, May 8,
according to Jim Anderson, man
ager. All Stanfordites are invited to
the off-the-record dance, which will
be held in the Women's Clubhouse
from 9 to 1.
"The purpose of the affair is to
help keep students entertained with
out leaving the campus," Anderson
stated. He emphasized that there
will be no admission charge of any
sort.
Meanwhile at a special executive
meeting Monday Tom Trent, '43. was
elected president to serve for the
remainder of the quarter. His elec
tion followed the resignation of Jim
O'Donnell, '42.
