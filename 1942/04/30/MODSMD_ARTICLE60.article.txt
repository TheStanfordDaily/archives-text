### MIKE CHURCHILL 
YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL
OOY! Did I get told ofT! I suppose it serves me
right. They told me not to go to the library last
Friday night. "Come to a show," they said, but I didn't
listen.
I was slowly walking up the broad stairs to the
Reading Room when a girl came rather quickly up
behind me and said, a little breathlessly, "There is
something I want to say to you."
This is the first time that a Stanford girl has ever
spoken to me without my having to organize an intro
duction.
My dreams were shattered by her next sentence.
"Have you ever," she went on, a little nervously, "said
a nice thing about anybody?"
I clutched hastily at my books and they slipped
from my hand, my jaw dropped, my composure was
shattered.
"You don't know who I am, you have never said
anything about me," she continued, "but I have often
wondered if a pleasant thought ever enters your
mind."
What a wallop that was! What could I say? I
murmured something about being naturally that way
ever since I was a forceps delivery, about having been
ruthlessly bullied as a child, about never yet having
had anyone answer the Pi Phi phone when I called,
but all was an incoherent stammer.
"I just wonder," she said, turning on her heel,
"if you've ever had a friend."

I ISTEN, lady, I got a friend. He likes me too. He's
a fine fellow. Maybe he does steal the rubber
tires off baby carriages, but times is hard. He's not
averse to pushing old ladies down, because one of
them dropped some change the first time he did it.
Some people call him mean, too, but he can't help
it either. In at least half his courses he has been re
ferred to some periodical always to find that it was
sent to the bindery the day before he asked for it.
Have mercy on us, lady. Life may be roses for you,
but it is just neuroses for us.

YOU CAN'T WIN 'EM ALL
OOY! Did I get told ofT! I suppose it serves me
right. They told me not to go to the library last
Friday night. "Come to a show," they said, but I didn't
listen.
I was slowly walking up the broad stairs to the
Reading Room when a girl came rather quickly up
behind me and said, a little breathlessly, "There is
something I want to say to you."
This is the first time that a Stanford girl has ever
spoken to me without my having to organize an intro
duction.
My dreams were shattered by her next sentence.
"Have you ever," she went on, a little nervously, "said
a nice thing about anybody?"
I clutched hastily at my books and they slipped
from my hand, my jaw dropped, my composure was
shattered.
"You don't know who I am, you have never said
anything about me," she continued, "but I have often
wondered if a pleasant thought ever enters your
mind."
What a wallop that was! What could I say? I
murmured something about being naturally that way
ever since I was a forceps delivery, about having been
ruthlessly bullied as a child, about never yet having
had anyone answer the Pi Phi phone when I called,
but all was an incoherent stammer.
"I just wonder," she said, turning on her heel,
"if you've ever had a friend."

I ISTEN, lady, I got a friend. He likes me too. He's
a fine fellow. Maybe he does steal the rubber
tires off baby carriages, but times is hard. He's not
averse to pushing old ladies down, because one of
them dropped some change the first time he did it.
Some people call him mean, too, but he can't help
it either. In at least half his courses he has been re
ferred to some periodical always to find that it was
sent to the bindery the day before he asked for it.
Have mercy on us, lady. Life may be roses for you,
but it is just neuroses for us.
