r jMIE EDITOR, SIR:
I am grateful to Hap Everett for his defense of
the swallows. Particularly insidious is the patient
watchful waiting of the University, up till the nests are
completed with painful effort, and then the insane
washing down bewildering the birds and causing end
less indignation among the students. The swallows
feed in flight, keep down bugs, add color and interest
to the Quad â€”and after all, it is supposedly a game
preserve! Wouldn't it be just as neat a trick to wash
up after swallows are gone? They're trying it
again, now, so let's have at least one paltry act of
human kindness and give them a break. If they're
washed out again, it is my fervent hope that the lady
whose pretty bonnet might have been soiled gets a
nice big mosquito bite instead!
