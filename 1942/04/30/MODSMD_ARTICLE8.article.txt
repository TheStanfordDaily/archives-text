# Blackout Drill Is Successful; Need for Improvement Cited
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Stanford's first full-scale practicc j
i blackout and disaster drill, held
I from 7 to S p.m. yesterday, was suc
| cessful although it uncovered sev
! oral weaknesses, Civilian Defense
leaders said last night.
In a two-hour discussion follow
ing the drill last night, all phases of
the practice were criticized and rem- j
edies for defects were suggested.
WELL DONE DRILL
"The whole drill was very well
done, with the . exception of two
main flaws," said Professor E. A.
Cottrell, chairman of the discussion.
"The firemen need more drills, and
the truck squads didn't know they
were to remain and act as ambu
lances," he added.
The main criticisms of the 26 j
Civilian Defense leaders were di
rected against student interference
with the work of the disaster squads.
Professor Edgar E. Robinson, co
chairman of the Civilian Defense
Committee, said:
"The disaster squads were ham
pered by the derisive remarks from
the upper windows of the Sigma Nu
fraternity house. And there was
some water thrown from these win
dows on one of the casualties on the
front lawn."
TRAIN SERIOUSLY
Professor Cottrell, who was in
charge of the disaster drill, said the
j practice demonstrated "that we must
j begin training seriously."
"The drill was a definite improve
ment over the previous practice held
during January," said Dr. Robinson.
"It shows we have gone a great dis
tance, as we attempted much more
tonight than before," he concluded.
Defense leaders suggested that an
\ other drill would be scheduled for
! the end of this quarter.
YOST SUGGESTION
Dean Yost suggested that students
i be asked to remain in their living
groups during blackout tests.
"Except for those members of the
, faculty and students actively as
signed to duties, the student body
should get off the street and get out
of the way of the defense workers,"
she said.
Disasters were simulated on vari
ous parts of the campus and these
disasters were treated by emergency
j first-aid squads and removed to one
j of'the six campus casualty centers in
ambulances.
