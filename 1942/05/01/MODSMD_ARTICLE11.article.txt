## 
### 
Stanford students under 18 years |
of aye were last night requested 1o j
immediately send notice to their par- j
ents or legal guardians to apply in j
their home towns for sugar ration- (
ing books. Rationing books will not !
be issued here to students under 18,
according to E. S. Erwin, assistant
business manager of the University, j
who issued the instructions.
All persons over 18 will apply for J
their rationing books at the elemen- J
tary school, May 4 to 7, inclusive. ]
Mr. Irwin said the government has j
warned everyone to register, whether j
they want sugar or not, since it is an- [
ticipated that at a later date other i
products may be rationed and the
rationing book will be needed.
Parents or iegal guardians of stu
dents over 18 should not register for
them, Mr. Erwin advised. A student,
who regularly cats 12 meals a week
at any one place must deposit hi.-,
book with the manager, he stated, j
and, when the student leaves, cou
pons will be detached by the Uni- I
versity and given to the rationing i
board. This means members of fra- j
ternities and sororities should give
their books to their house managers, ;
although the wholesale commissary j
may take charge of the books, Mr. '
Erwin stated.
