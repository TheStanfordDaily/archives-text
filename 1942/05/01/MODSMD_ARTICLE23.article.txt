# Dr. Farnsworth Tells European Food Situation
## 
### LUCIE THOMPSON 
In both Germany and Britain the
average diet is "filling hut not
pleasant," according to Dr. Helen C.
Farnsworth, associate economist in
the Food Research Institute.
Although, according to Dr. Farns
worth, Germany, faces a scarcity of
certain kinds of foods, especially
fats, she has adequate supplies of
the major carbohydrate foods.
BREAD RATIONS
"In April, however, Germany re
duced both the quantity and qual
ity of her bread rations at the same
time that she reduced her fat ra
tions."
"Since no immediate shortage of
wheat and rye threatens," said Dr.
Farnsworth, "this means that Ger
man officials expect a longer war or
they think larger stocks of bread
grain should be maintained for some
other reason."
POLAND SITUATION
The food situations in Poland and
Greece are "serious," she continued,
with thousands of people dying
monthly from starvation in Warsaw
and Athens-Piraeus. The highest
death figures should not be cred
ited, however, for conditions are not
that bad even in the cities.
"In the country districts, most
farmers have enough food left for
their own use," she said, "in spite of
heavy German requisitions."
RELIEF SHIPMENTS
In Athens-Piraeus, the situation
has recently been relieved somewhat
by shipments from the United States
and England, and Germany and Italy
claim that they have also sent in
food.
"In contrast, Denmark has fared
reasonably well," declared Dr. Farns
worth, "mainly because of the struc
ture of her agriculture, which is an
important asset to Germany. Hitler,
however, also likes to point to Den
mark as an illustration of the bene
fits of co-operation with the Reich."
NO CRITICAL SHORTAGE
Except in parts of Yugoslavia,
however, critical food shortages have
not developed, though in the larger
Rumanian and Hungarian cities
many foods are, rationed or reduced
in distribution.
"Most of the occupied countries
export more than they should to
Germany," she declared, "but the
amounts of food that Germany can
extract from these countries is lim
ited both by the possibility of up
risings of the deprived peoples and
by the serious bottleneck in trans
portation."
"Many in Spain live on very short
I rations," Dr. Farnsworth concluded,
"but the food available in Switzer
land and Portugal is much like that
I in England and Germany—filling but
| not pleasant."

export more than they should to
Germany," she declared, "but the
amounts of food that Germany can
extract from these countries is lim
ited both by the possibility of up
risings of the deprived peoples and
by the serious bottleneck in trans
portation."
"Many in Spain live on very short
I rations," Dr. Farnsworth concluded,
"but the food available in Switzer
land and Portugal is much like that
I in England and Germany—filling but
| not pleasant."

In both Germany and Britain the
average diet is "filling hut not
pleasant," according to Dr. Helen C.
Farnsworth, associate economist in
the Food Research Institute.
Although, according to Dr. Farns
worth, Germany, faces a scarcity of
certain kinds of foods, especially
fats, she has adequate supplies of
the major carbohydrate foods.
BREAD RATIONS
"In April, however, Germany re
duced both the quantity and qual
ity of her bread rations at the same
time that she reduced her fat ra
tions."
"Since no immediate shortage of
wheat and rye threatens," said Dr.
Farnsworth, "this means that Ger
man officials expect a longer war or
they think larger stocks of bread
grain should be maintained for some
other reason."
POLAND SITUATION
The food situations in Poland and
Greece are "serious," she continued,
with thousands of people dying
monthly from starvation in Warsaw
and Athens-Piraeus. The highest
death figures should not be cred
ited, however, for conditions are not
that bad even in the cities.
"In the country districts, most
farmers have enough food left for
their own use," she said, "in spite of
heavy German requisitions."
RELIEF SHIPMENTS
In Athens-Piraeus, the situation
has recently been relieved somewhat
by shipments from the United States
and England, and Germany and Italy
claim that they have also sent in
food.
"In contrast, Denmark has fared
reasonably well," declared Dr. Farns
worth, "mainly because of the struc
ture of her agriculture, which is an
important asset to Germany. Hitler,
however, also likes to point to Den
mark as an illustration of the bene
fits of co-operation with the Reich."
NO CRITICAL SHORTAGE
Except in parts of Yugoslavia,
however, critical food shortages have
not developed, though in the larger
Rumanian and Hungarian cities
many foods are, rationed or reduced
in distribution.
"Most of the occupied countries
export more than they should to
Germany," she declared, "but the
amounts of food that Germany can
extract from these countries is lim
ited both by the possibility of up
risings of the deprived peoples and
