## Dyck to Hurl Against Santa Clara Tomorrow in Duel with Pillette 
### ZIP WALT 
Tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond Stanford's baseball
team will close its C.1.8A. season against the Santa Clara Broncos. Ilarry
Dyck will Ik- on (he mound against Santa Clara's ace hurlcr, l)uane
I'illette.
Although this is the last game of the pennant race. Coach Ilarry Wol
ter has scheduled several games with service teams throughout the stale.

Stanford finds itself entrenched in
the cellar position in the league
standings below St. Mary's. The
Cards have won but two games in
thirteen. The Phoenix, coached by
Earl Shelley, have won four out of
fourteen. The Broncos are in third
place behind the powerful Trojans
of U.S.C. and the Bears of California.
In the first game of the present
series, the boys of Leonard Casa
nova held off an eighth-inning In
dian rally to win 4-2. On Tuesday
they found the slants of "Wild" Bill
Wilson to win 6-1.
MOST CONSISTENT
Dyck has been the most consist
ent of the Card chuckers, and if the
team hits in the pinches tomorrow,
as they have failed to do in the past,
he should come up with a win. Ray
"Duke" Hammett is leading the
sluggers with a nice .320 average. He
is followed by Ward Walkup, who
is belting the ball for .312.
Besides excelling in hitting, Ham
mett and Walkup have been out
standing on the field. At first base
Hammet has committed but one er
ror in league play, and is rated with
Rudy Konopka of U.S.C. as the best
in college baseball circles. Walkup
was an unknown quantity when the
season started, but has filled in the
spot vacated by Ace Han lon very
well, and has the knack of directing
the pitchers and the infield.
HARMS AND WILSON
Backing up Dyck in the bullpen
are Bill Harms and Wilson. Harms
has the first Stanford league win to
his credit — a 10-4 victory over
U.C.L.A. Don Pendergrass is still
ailing from a sore arm, and leaves
the squad without a lefthander.
The infield will have Hammett,
first base; Harry Parsons, second
base; Ted Nell, third base; and Le
land Scott, shortstop. In the out
field, Howie Dallmar will be in left,
Carl Kellenberger, center, and Ed
Washburn in right field. Washburn
has been the big hitter in the last
few games after a dismal early sea
son average.
CARUSO OUT
Captain Boch Caruso will be out
of the game, still ailing from an
ankle injury.
The Bronco line-up will have
Crawford at first base, Mullins at
second, Reese at third, and Briganti
at shortstop. In the outfield will be
Graham, Freitas, and Crowley. Fis
calini will catch.

Tomorrow at 2:15 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond Stanford's baseball
team will close its C.1.8A. season against the Santa Clara Broncos. Ilarry
Dyck will Ik- on (he mound against Santa Clara's ace hurlcr, l)uane
I'illette.
Although this is the last game of the pennant race. Coach Ilarry Wol

Stanford finds itself entrenched in
the cellar position in the league
standings below St. Mary's. The
Cards have won but two games in
thirteen. The Phoenix, coached by
Earl Shelley, have won four out of
fourteen. The Broncos are in third
place behind the powerful Trojans
of U.S.C. and the Bears of California.
In the first game of the present
series, the boys of Leonard Casa
nova held off an eighth-inning In
dian rally to win 4-2. On Tuesday
they found the slants of "Wild" Bill
Wilson to win 6-1.
MOST CONSISTENT
Dyck has been the most consist
ent of the Card chuckers, and if the
team hits in the pinches tomorrow,
as they have failed to do in the past,
he should come up with a win. Ray
"Duke" Hammett is leading the
sluggers with a nice .320 average. He
is followed by Ward Walkup, who
is belting the ball for .312.
Besides excelling in hitting, Ham
mett and Walkup have been out
standing on the field. At first base
Hammet has committed but one er
ror in league play, and is rated with
Rudy Konopka of U.S.C. as the best
in college baseball circles. Walkup
was an unknown quantity when the
season started, but has filled in the
spot vacated by Ace Han lon very
well, and has the knack of directing
the pitchers and the infield.
HARMS AND WILSON
Backing up Dyck in the bullpen
are Bill Harms and Wilson. Harms
has the first Stanford league win to
his credit — a 10-4 victory over
U.C.L.A. Don Pendergrass is still
ailing from a sore arm, and leaves
the squad without a lefthander.
The infield will have Hammett,
first base; Harry Parsons, second
base; Ted Nell, third base; and Le
land Scott, shortstop. In the out
field, Howie Dallmar will be in left,
Carl Kellenberger, center, and Ed
Washburn in right field. Washburn
has been the big hitter in the last
few games after a dismal early sea
son average.
CARUSO OUT
Captain Boch Caruso will be out
of the game, still ailing from an
ankle injury.
The Bronco line-up will have
Crawford at first base, Mullins at
second, Reese at third, and Briganti
at shortstop. In the outfield will be
Graham, Freitas, and Crowley. Fis
calini will catch.
