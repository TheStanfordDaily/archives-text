HlGHLlGHTS—Cleveland's in
spired Indians boosted their Amer
ican League lead to two games and
the Brooklyn Dodgers jumped,
their National League margin to
four games yesterday as the sen
ior circuit made the power-hitting
American Leaguers look anemic by
belting a total of II home runs.
The four-bagger hitters were
Brooklyn's Dolph Camilli with two;
Ray Lamanno and Frank McCor
mick of the Reds; Ben Warren,
Nick Ktten. Ron Northey, and
Danny Litwhiler of the Phils; Er
nie Lombard! and Buddy Gremp
of the Boston Braves, and Sam
Dallesandro of the Cubs.

Crude weighing machines, based
on the balance, were used in Egypt
at least 5000 years before the Chris
tian era.
