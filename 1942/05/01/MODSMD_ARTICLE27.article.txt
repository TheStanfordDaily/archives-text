# Whitney Entry Picked To Cop Kentucky Race
## 
### THE TURFMAN 
For those who try to beat the pccpul's choice, this boss dept. adds its
annual "stabher in the darker" for tomorrow's 68th renewal of the
$75,000 added Kentucky Derby at Churchill Downsâ€”it's Mrs. Payne
Whitney's entry of Devil Diver and Shut Out.
It's been 11 years since the Greentree stable has saddled a Derby win
ner, and tomorrow its hopes rest with Devil Diver, a big bay colt and
half-brother to Twenty Grand, and Shut Out, one of the last sons sired
by mighty Equipoise before he died so suddenly in 1938.
Aboard the Diver will be slim Eddie Arcaro, who rode Lawrin in
1938 and Whirlaway last year to Derby victories. It was Arcaro who
scored one of racing's biggest upsets when he brought The Rhymer home
in front of a star-studded Widener Cup field several weeks ago.
Shut Out, the Diver's stablemate, is a stretch running fool and gave
notice of his late charge when he came from behind to whip Requested,
one of tomorrow's co-choices, by three lengths in the Grand Union
Stages at Saratoga last summer.
Greentree will have a speed horse in Devil Diver and a router in Shut
Out. It might be the winning combination.
There is no logical favorite on the eve of America's most colorful
horse race.
Alsab, sensation as a two-year-old, was a bust in Florida this year and
has failed to win in eight starts this season as a three-year-old. Alsab
came from last place Tuesday to gain a good third to Valdina Orphan in
the Derby Trial, and will be heavily backed despite his mediocre showings.
Today's added distance of a mile and a quarter may he the key to
Alsab's worries. Unable to quite get up in time the extra distance will
be very much to his liking.
Requested should go out on top at the start, and it will be just a ques-.
tion of whether the' Wood Memorial winner can hang on when the field
turns for home and the real running begins.
The old saying of "you never know what's going to happen in a horse
race" will be as evident as ever tomorrow, for this Derby field is one of
the most wide-open ever to face the Bluegrass Barrier.
Of those that will pay off in telephone number prices if they win there
are plenty.
There's With Regards, the coast hope, with Johnny Longden aboard.
With Regards has never gone the distance, but who can tell? There's
Sun Again, bang-up second in the Derby Trial and hope of the Calumet
stable, whose Whirlaway captured the roses last year.
The powerful entry of Valdina Orphan and Hollywood, the Irish im
port, will get a good play from the estimated crowd of 100,000. Valdina
Orphan won the Derby Trial and Hollywood followed in fourth place.
Look out for this pair.
Following is the probable field of 16, jockeys, and probable odds. Horses
