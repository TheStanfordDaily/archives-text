# Squad of 18, Including Freshmen, Enter Star-Studded P.A. Carnival
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Local fans will get their last chance to see the 1!)42 Stanford team in
action wtihout traveling 200 miles or more when an 18-man Indian team
goes to Berkeley tomorrow for the annual P.A. meet.
With the close of this A.A.U.-sponsored carnival tomorrow, the Card
cinder squad will spend the rest of the season in a triumphal tour around
the country — Los Angeles, Fresno, Los Angeles. Seattle, Compton, Ev-

anston. Omaha, and New York.
Although this team will not take
all the honors tomorrow, or even
the lion's share, it should make a
creditable showing due to the re
markable improvement shown by
many of the men in the past few
weeks.
SEVEN FROSII
Seven of this year's excellent
frosh team will accompany 11 var
sity performers to the meet. Quar
ter-miler Johnny Fulton, sprinter
Jim Pettit, and broad jumper Al
Hoisch of the yearlings should show
well in their first times in open
competition.
Pettit, Hoisch, Dick Hambleton,
John Silva, and Bill Quackenbush
will run both dashes for the Farm.
Their competition will include Hal
Davis, Cal's ace, Hubie Kerns of
U.S.C., and Bill Smith of San Jose.
STIFF COMPETITION
Fulton and his frosh teammates
Bruce Meyer and Bob Sears, will
find stiff competition in Trojan Cliff
Bourland. Wy Cripe and George
Grimes will handle the 880 chore for
Pitch Johnson. Another Trojan,
Warren Smith, and San Jose's Thel
mo Knowles should finish one and
two in this.
Bob Compton will have to im
prove his 4:24 of last week-end to
outfinish Bear George Richard and
Bobby Madrid of Fresno.
lIERTEL OUT
Ed Hertel, top Card hurdler, will
not run tomorrow, due to an in
jured muscle which has been both
ering him for several weeks. How
ever, Stanford will be represented
in the barrier events by Don Reiss
and Glenn Nielsen.
Two pole vaulters, two high
jumpers, and two broad jumpers
will compete for the Farm in their
events. Ed Tomaso and Russ Peck
will try to keep up with Cornelius
Warmerdam in the pole vault.
CHANCE TO WIN
Willard Smith and Vern Hart, a
6-4 sophomore and a 6-4 veteran,
stand an even chance of winning
their event, since no one in the Bay
Area can boast of a better jump.
Papoose Hoisch will team with
varsity Captain Gene Kern in an
attempt to land two places in the
broad jump competition. Bill Smith
and Ben Steele of San Jose and Jim
Jurkovich of Cal, however, have
made better records this season.
Hank Norberg, Al Pande, and Er
nie Peninou round out the Card
team. Norberg will throw the dis
cus with the latter two in the
javelin.

all goods and services, always equals

Bob Compton will have to im
prove his 4:24 of last week-end to
outfinish Bear George Richard and
Bobby Madrid of Fresno.
lIERTEL OUT
Ed Hertel, top Card hurdler, will
not run tomorrow, due to an in
jured muscle which has been both
ering him for several weeks. How
ever, Stanford will be represented
in the barrier events by Don Reiss
and Glenn Nielsen.
Two pole vaulters, two high
jumpers, and two broad jumpers
will compete for the Farm in their
events. Ed Tomaso and Russ Peck
will try to keep up with Cornelius
Warmerdam in the pole vault.
CHANCE TO WIN
Willard Smith and Vern Hart, a
6-4 sophomore and a 6-4 veteran,
stand an even chance of winning
their event, since no one in the Bay
Area can boast of a better jump.
Papoose Hoisch will team with
varsity Captain Gene Kern in an
attempt to land two places in the
broad jump competition. Bill Smith
and Ben Steele of San Jose and Jim
Jurkovich of Cal, however, have
made better records this season.
Hank Norberg, Al Pande, and Er
nie Peninou round out the Card
team. Norberg will throw the dis
cus with the latter two in the
javelin.

The volume of imports, including
all goods and services, always equals
the volume of exports.
Local fans will get their last chance to see the 1!)42 Stanford team in
action wtihout traveling 200 miles or more when an 18-man Indian team
goes to Berkeley tomorrow for the annual P.A. meet.
With the close of this A.A.U.-sponsored carnival tomorrow, the Card
cinder squad will spend the rest of the season in a triumphal tour around
the country — Los Angeles, Fresno, Los Angeles. Seattle, Compton, Ev-

anston. Omaha, and New York.
Although this team will not take
all the honors tomorrow, or even
the lion's share, it should make a
creditable showing due to the re
markable improvement shown by
many of the men in the past few
weeks.
SEVEN FROSII
Seven of this year's excellent
frosh team will accompany 11 var
sity performers to the meet. Quar
ter-miler Johnny Fulton, sprinter
Jim Pettit, and broad jumper Al
Hoisch of the yearlings should show
well in their first times in open
competition.
Pettit, Hoisch, Dick Hambleton,
John Silva, and Bill Quackenbush
will run both dashes for the Farm.
Their competition will include Hal
Davis, Cal's ace, Hubie Kerns of
U.S.C., and Bill Smith of San Jose.
STIFF COMPETITION
Fulton and his frosh teammates
Bruce Meyer and Bob Sears, will
find stiff competition in Trojan Cliff
Bourland. Wy Cripe and George
Grimes will handle the 880 chore for
Pitch Johnson. Another Trojan,
Warren Smith, and San Jose's Thel
mo Knowles should finish one and
two in this.
Bob Compton will have to im
prove his 4:24 of last week-end to
outfinish Bear George Richard and
Bobby Madrid of Fresno.
