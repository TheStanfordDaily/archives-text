yV lIILE dust is rising from the awful beatings llie baseball and track
teams have taken this season, and while the Farm sports enthusiasts '
are sitting back bemoaning the state of Stanford athletics, let's run through
the past school year and see iust how disastrous it has been.
Making a comparison with California, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C. is about the
only fair way since they are the only teams we play consistently.

Stanford has been the leading,
school in basketball, tennis, and golf,
; U.S.C. has led in track, baseball,
| and swimming, Cal has taken foot
j ball, and U.C.L.A. comes up with
j the usual goose-egg.
Of the Indians' championship
teams, two out of three—basket
ball and tennis—are definitely na
tional champions also, and the
third — golf — has an excellent
chance of repeating its N.C.A.A.
I victory of last year.
California can, hardly say that
their football team was of national
championship caliber. They didn't
even win the P.CC. title—they just
happened to edge out their three
state rivals.
We admit that S.C.'s track team is
second to none, but we can't say the
same for their baseball and swim
ming outfits.
The Bruin backgammon squad
I is dangerous, but got nosed out in
the quarterfinals of the N.C.A.A.
tourney last month by Bowdoin.
Scanning the last four para
graphs of actual factual material,
i I would not say that Farm athletics
| have slipped so considerably.

| OOK for plenty of speed in the
J Card backfield next fall. Men
like Al Cole, Buck Fawcett, Jim
Pettit, and Al Hoisch don't loiter
when skirting the ends and running
back kicks. Yes, definitely speed is
essential to be able to hold a posi
tion on that backfield.
Witness, Milt Vucinieh. Voos was
good enough to play plenty of full
back last fall, and even at times
make the kiddies forget Norm
Standlee. But this spring, he just
wasnt' fast enough to hold down the
spot, so he has been moved into the
center slot, where he is doing a hell
uva good job.

jpOR those of you who are itching
to get back into the stadium and
see the T formation functioning
again, and at the same time maybe
pick up a few splinters, don't plan
to take your girl friend to Half
Moon Bay on the afternoon of May
23, because that is the day of the
Big Spring Grid Game. The officiat
ing alone is worth the price of ad
mission, which is nothing.

wasnt' fast enough to hold down the
spot, so he has been moved into the
center slot, where he is doing a hell

jpOR those of you who are itching
to get back into the stadium and
see the T formation functioning
again, and at the same time maybe
pick up a few splinters, don't plan
to take your girl friend to Half
Moon Bay on the afternoon of May
23, because that is the day of the
Big Spring Grid Game. The officiat
ing alone is worth the price of ad
mission, which is nothing.
yV lIILE dust is rising from the awful beatings llie baseball and track
teams have taken this season, and while the Farm sports enthusiasts '
are sitting back bemoaning the state of Stanford athletics, let's run through
the past school year and see iust how disastrous it has been.
Making a comparison with California, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C. is about the
only fair way since they are the only teams we play consistently.

Stanford has been the leading,
school in basketball, tennis, and golf,
; U.S.C. has led in track, baseball,
| and swimming, Cal has taken foot
j ball, and U.C.L.A. comes up with
j the usual goose-egg.
Of the Indians' championship
teams, two out of three—basket
ball and tennis—are definitely na
tional champions also, and the
third — golf — has an excellent
chance of repeating its N.C.A.A.
I victory of last year.
California can, hardly say that
their football team was of national
championship caliber. They didn't
even win the P.CC. title—they just
happened to edge out their three
state rivals.
We admit that S.C.'s track team is
second to none, but we can't say the
same for their baseball and swim
ming outfits.
The Bruin backgammon squad
I is dangerous, but got nosed out in
the quarterfinals of the N.C.A.A.
tourney last month by Bowdoin.
Scanning the last four para
graphs of actual factual material,
i I would not say that Farm athletics
| have slipped so considerably.

| OOK for plenty of speed in the
J Card backfield next fall. Men
like Al Cole, Buck Fawcett, Jim
Pettit, and Al Hoisch don't loiter
when skirting the ends and running
back kicks. Yes, definitely speed is
essential to be able to hold a posi
tion on that backfield.
Witness, Milt Vucinieh. Voos was
good enough to play plenty of full
back last fall, and even at times
make the kiddies forget Norm
Standlee. But this spring, he just
wasnt' fast enough to hold down the
spot, so he has been moved into the
center slot, where he is doing a hell
