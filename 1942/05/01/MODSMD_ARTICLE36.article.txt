There is a plague in Memorial Court which
bears the names of those heroic Stanford men

There will be a plaque for the Stanford men
who have given and v/ho will give their lives

name of Mel Jacoby on this plaque will always
represent, to his many friends and admirers,
brilliant success in his life work.
No higher tribute could be paid Mel than
that by Dr. Chilton R. Bush, executive head of
the Division of Journalism:
"He had a personal courage that made him an
invaluable newspaper correspondent."
