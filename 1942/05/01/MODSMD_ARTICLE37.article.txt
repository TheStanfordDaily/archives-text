# Worth Considering

ALTHOUGH "big name" bands have been
officially banned from Stanford campus
dances for the duration, it would be well to note
the success of the annual junior prom given
at U.C.L.A. last week-end.
The junior class down there didn't stop at hav
ing one band, they had three, Harry James,
Sterling Young, and Eddie Aguilar's rumba
band. The expenses for the dance were obvi
ously tremendous, but they worked out such a
well-rounded program for the week-end that
the students were able to stay on campus and
still have a better lime than they possibly could
have if they had raced down Wilshire Boule
vard heading for some night spot.
The first event of the week-end was their
annual Jubilee, which could be compared with
our Spring Show. Then ten sororities and fra
ternities gave house parties. From there the
students moved to the big hall on campus for
the prom. The cost to each student for such
an eventful week-end was very little. In fact
each student actually contributed to the nation's
war effort, for out of the budget allowance and
profits, the class bought a SlOOO war bond.
Tonight U.S.C. is having Glenn Miller at the
Ambassador for S4 a bid. No mention in the
publicity was made of where the money was
to go. No mention was made of the fact that
tires and gas would have to be used to get to
the dance, for although the Ambassador is
officially in Los Angeles, everyone knows that
no matter where an affair is held there, it would
still be farther than the distance from Palo Alto
to New York.
Contrast the results of these two "down
south" functions. The Uclans have gone a long
way toward helping our country. On the other
hand the U.S.C. students are really tearing down
some of the points which we at Stanford are
already beginning to realize. They are wasting
time, gas, and money; they have not begun to
realize that things can't go on as before; in other
words their entire mental attitude needs a little
revamping.
Maybe Excom was a litlle hasty when it
banned big name bands on campus. We could
still have them if we used them for publicity for
such a fine job as that done at U.C.L.A.â€”John
