### AMIE REICHERT 
r | I IIE boys in the Axis fraternity club are having a
meeting today to discuss rushing. The rush com
mittee consists of Adolf Hitler, class of '33; Benito Mus
solini, class of '22; and Hiroishi Oshima, class of '31.
What the boys want to figure out today is whom to
rush next.
There doesnt' seem to be hardly any place left for
the boys to go. The rest of the world just won't be
rushed, because it hears that the new pledges aren't
very*happy in the club.
Today these men, Hitler, Mussolini, and Oshima,
will meet at Munich, the grave of democracy's col
lective security, and the birthplace of World War 11.
The Italian press says that they will discuss plans to
merge all the battlefronts of this great war into "one
gigantic front."
Something big should undoubtedly come out of the
meeting despite the fact that the Italian press says so.
It is significant that the meeting comes at this time in
he war, a time when Hitler is desperately looking for
a spot at which to hurl his massive strength for one
last desperate push, it comes at the end of a week
highlighted by strange political maneuvers on the
home fronts of Italy and Germany.
In Germany Hitler made his Reichstag speech, ask
ing the German people for absolute judicial power,
and thereby intimating a coming purge. Also within
the past week a shattering R.A.F. offensive against
German ports and industrial centers has dealt telling
blows to Hitler's war effort. Add to that the growing
reports of unrest and dissatisfaction in Germany and
persistent rumors of an Allied offensive to open a sec
ond front, President Roosevelt's statement that U.S.
warships are operating in the Mediterranean and U.S.
troops are in Africa, the hints of several peace offers
last week from Berlin to London and the increased re
sistance of the Red Army—add all this together and
you can see that Der Fuehrer must have a lot on his
mind to talk over with the brothers. And you can see
why he is getting anxious to make a rush —somewhere.

JTALY had its share of political maneuvering during
the past week, too. Yesterday there were hints
that the little Italian king had had just about enough
of Benito and was getting ready to kick him out, but
since nobody can imagine exactly how this is going to
be done since Mussolini is a good three feet taller than
the king, the rumors have died down. Nevertheless
there have been reports all week that Mussolini has
been conferring with prefects from all over the Ital
ian kingdom on the food situation, and also reports
that Italy was sending large forces to the Russian
front in exchange for German troops and plane re
inforcements in the Mediterranean.
All this points to a show-down within the very near
future, and the presence of the Japanese representa
tive, while it might just be a gesture of courtesy, could
also possibly mean the first anvil blow in the forging
of that giant pincer we have heard so much about which
will merge the German and Japanese fronts and hold
half the earth in its vise.

every time Hitler and Mussolini meets
something big happens. Last time they had a five
day session on the Russo-German front which culmi
nated in the great German drive on Moscow. The
time before that,they met at Brenner Pass and imme
diately afterward Hitler decided to rush Russia.
The question now is, which way? Will it be
through the Middle East to join hands with the Japa
nese? Will it be a renewed drive against Russia? Will
it be a smash through Turkey or around Turkey? A
big push in North Africa? One of these? Or perhaps
several of these?
We shall probably know within a few days. Mean
while the R.A.F. might do a little target practice over
Munich, scene of the conference. One well-placed
bomb might mean the end of World War 11.

that the little Italian king had had just about enough
of Benito and was getting ready to kick him out, but
since nobody can imagine exactly how this is going to
be done since Mussolini is a good three feet taller than
the king, the rumors have died down. Nevertheless
there have been reports all week that Mussolini has
been conferring with prefects from all over the Ital
ian kingdom on the food situation, and also reports
that Italy was sending large forces to the Russian
front in exchange for German troops and plane re
inforcements in the Mediterranean.
All this points to a show-down within the very near
future, and the presence of the Japanese representa
tive, while it might just be a gesture of courtesy, could
also possibly mean the first anvil blow in the forging
of that giant pincer we have heard so much about which
will merge the German and Japanese fronts and hold
half the earth in its vise.

every time Hitler and Mussolini meets
something big happens. Last time they had a five
day session on the Russo-German front which culmi
nated in the great German drive on Moscow. The
time before that,they met at Brenner Pass and imme
diately afterward Hitler decided to rush Russia.
The question now is, which way? Will it be
through the Middle East to join hands with the Japa
nese? Will it be a renewed drive against Russia? Will
it be a smash through Turkey or around Turkey? A
big push in North Africa? One of these? Or perhaps
several of these?
We shall probably know within a few days. Mean
while the R.A.F. might do a little target practice over
Munich, scene of the conference. One well-placed
bomb might mean the end of World War 11.
r | I IIE boys in the Axis fraternity club are having a
meeting today to discuss rushing. The rush com
mittee consists of Adolf Hitler, class of '33; Benito Mus
solini, class of '22; and Hiroishi Oshima, class of '31.
What the boys want to figure out today is whom to
rush next.
There doesnt' seem to be hardly any place left for
the boys to go. The rest of the world just won't be
rushed, because it hears that the new pledges aren't
very*happy in the club.
Today these men, Hitler, Mussolini, and Oshima,
will meet at Munich, the grave of democracy's col
lective security, and the birthplace of World War 11.
The Italian press says that they will discuss plans to
merge all the battlefronts of this great war into "one
gigantic front."
Something big should undoubtedly come out of the
meeting despite the fact that the Italian press says so.
It is significant that the meeting comes at this time in
he war, a time when Hitler is desperately looking for
a spot at which to hurl his massive strength for one
last desperate push, it comes at the end of a week
highlighted by strange political maneuvers on the
home fronts of Italy and Germany.
In Germany Hitler made his Reichstag speech, ask
ing the German people for absolute judicial power,
and thereby intimating a coming purge. Also within
the past week a shattering R.A.F. offensive against
German ports and industrial centers has dealt telling
blows to Hitler's war effort. Add to that the growing
reports of unrest and dissatisfaction in Germany and
persistent rumors of an Allied offensive to open a sec
ond front, President Roosevelt's statement that U.S.
warships are operating in the Mediterranean and U.S.
troops are in Africa, the hints of several peace offers
last week from Berlin to London and the increased re
sistance of the Red Army—add all this together and
you can see that Der Fuehrer must have a lot on his
mind to talk over with the brothers. And you can see
why he is getting anxious to make a rush —somewhere.

rushed, because it hears that the new pledges aren't
very*happy in the club.
Today these men, Hitler, Mussolini, and Oshima,
will meet at Munich, the grave of democracy's col
lective security, and the birthplace of World War 11.
The Italian press says that they will discuss plans to
merge all the battlefronts of this great war into "one
gigantic front."
Something big should undoubtedly come out of the
meeting despite the fact that the Italian press says so.
It is significant that the meeting comes at this time in
he war, a time when Hitler is desperately looking for
a spot at which to hurl his massive strength for one
last desperate push, it comes at the end of a week
highlighted by strange political maneuvers on the
home fronts of Italy and Germany.
In Germany Hitler made his Reichstag speech, ask
ing the German people for absolute judicial power,
and thereby intimating a coming purge. Also within
the past week a shattering R.A.F. offensive against
German ports and industrial centers has dealt telling
blows to Hitler's war effort. Add to that the growing
reports of unrest and dissatisfaction in Germany and
persistent rumors of an Allied offensive to open a sec
ond front, President Roosevelt's statement that U.S.
warships are operating in the Mediterranean and U.S.
troops are in Africa, the hints of several peace offers
last week from Berlin to London and the increased re
sistance of the Red Army—add all this together and
you can see that Der Fuehrer must have a lot on his
mind to talk over with the brothers. And you can see
why he is getting anxious to make a rush —somewhere.

JTALY had its share of political maneuvering during
the past week, too. Yesterday there were hints
that the little Italian king had had just about enough
of Benito and was getting ready to kick him out, but
since nobody can imagine exactly how this is going to
be done since Mussolini is a good three feet taller than
the king, the rumors have died down. Nevertheless
there have been reports all week that Mussolini has
been conferring with prefects from all over the Ital
ian kingdom on the food situation, and also reports
that Italy was sending large forces to the Russian
front in exchange for German troops and plane re
inforcements in the Mediterranean.
All this points to a show-down within the very near
future, and the presence of the Japanese representa
tive, while it might just be a gesture of courtesy, could
also possibly mean the first anvil blow in the forging
of that giant pincer we have heard so much about which
will merge the German and Japanese fronts and hold
half the earth in its vise.

every time Hitler and Mussolini meets
something big happens. Last time they had a five
day session on the Russo-German front which culmi
nated in the great German drive on Moscow. The
time before that,they met at Brenner Pass and imme
diately afterward Hitler decided to rush Russia.
The question now is, which way? Will it be
through the Middle East to join hands with the Japa
nese? Will it be a renewed drive against Russia? Will
it be a smash through Turkey or around Turkey? A
big push in North Africa? One of these? Or perhaps
several of these?
We shall probably know within a few days. Mean
while the R.A.F. might do a little target practice over
Munich, scene of the conference. One well-placed
bomb might mean the end of World War 11.
