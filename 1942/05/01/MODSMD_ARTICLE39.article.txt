### MIKE CHURCHILL 
A PAT IN A PEEP, OK
MY STAMP DAY
W/ITH a crash of glass, and cries of "Ouch," "I'm
soaked," and "I christen thee Victor E. Peep,"
Sylvia Berry shattered a champagne bottle (through
the courtesy of the Cellar) filled with ginger ale
(through the courtesy of Shorty Grannis) over the bow
of a Page Mill Peep.
The two soldiers, drivers of the peep, were over
heard afterwards to say that they had never seen
such a strong right swing, even on a sergeant.
I had gone to watch this ceremony with Vice-
President Pat Adams, and I can say for both of us
that we were impressed. We tried to get a ride, but
it was taxed to capacity by Shorty Grannis and the
Alpha Phis.
We stopped to chat with Wesley Nowell, frosh
from Hawaii, and Leslie Langnecker, vice-president
apparent, about the merits of going barefoot but
reached no definite conclusions.
On our way up the Row, Pat and I again came
across the peep in front of the Alpha Phi house, and
this time we were more successful, not only getting in
a picture, but in getting a ride as well.
With two soldiers, Sylvia, Pat, Betty Boardman,
Mavis Moore, and two other girls I didn't get a chance
to meet, in a peep designed for three, we started ofT.
We went round behind the Lake, down past La
gunita, through Roble, Kingseote, and then across the
field behind the Row. This was pretty tame stuff so
it was decided to climb a bank, and climb a bank we
did.
There is a certain thrill to being tightly packed in a
peep with six scared girls, going up a 45-degree bank,
as either the soldiers or I will testify.
It was a lot of fun to go riding around in one of
these peeps, but what was even better was being able
to see and feel just what the War Savings of Stan
fordites would buy and give to the Allied Armies.

We stopped to chat with Wesley Nowell, frosh
from Hawaii, and Leslie Langnecker, vice-president
apparent, about the merits of going barefoot but
reached no definite conclusions.
On our way up the Row, Pat and I again came
across the peep in front of the Alpha Phi house, and
this time we were more successful, not only getting in
a picture, but in getting a ride as well.
With two soldiers, Sylvia, Pat, Betty Boardman,
Mavis Moore, and two other girls I didn't get a chance
to meet, in a peep designed for three, we started ofT.
We went round behind the Lake, down past La
gunita, through Roble, Kingseote, and then across the
field behind the Row. This was pretty tame stuff so
it was decided to climb a bank, and climb a bank we
did.
There is a certain thrill to being tightly packed in a
peep with six scared girls, going up a 45-degree bank,
as either the soldiers or I will testify.
It was a lot of fun to go riding around in one of
these peeps, but what was even better was being able
to see and feel just what the War Savings of Stan
fordites would buy and give to the Allied Armies.
A PAT IN A PEEP, OK
MY STAMP DAY
W/ITH a crash of glass, and cries of "Ouch," "I'm
soaked," and "I christen thee Victor E. Peep,"
Sylvia Berry shattered a champagne bottle (through
the courtesy of the Cellar) filled with ginger ale
(through the courtesy of Shorty Grannis) over the bow
of a Page Mill Peep.
The two soldiers, drivers of the peep, were over
heard afterwards to say that they had never seen
such a strong right swing, even on a sergeant.
I had gone to watch this ceremony with Vice-
President Pat Adams, and I can say for both of us
that we were impressed. We tried to get a ride, but
it was taxed to capacity by Shorty Grannis and the
Alpha Phis.
