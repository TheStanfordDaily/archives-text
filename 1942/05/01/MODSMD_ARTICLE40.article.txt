# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
Reading this morning's Daily made me disgusted
with the way the rugby proposal was brushed off by
the Ex Committee.
There is absolutely no reason for a remark like
that of Hammett's which states that giving Block S's
to rugby men would cheapen the Block S. Just what
sort of a token of perfection does he think the Block S
is, anyway? The men out there for rugby deserve the j
Block S just as much as any other athletes. The fine j
record and splendid sportsmanship of the rugby men ;
has certainly brought credit to the University. The
remark by the chief surgeon of the 11.M.5. Orion is
a fine illustration of this statement.
On the other hand, does Hammett think that his !
own crew of baseball players (about 16 of whom will \
receive Block S awards) brings glory or good will to ,
the University? When that ball club gets slaughtered j
in every game (record: won 2 out of about 14 games)
does Hammett think his lads worthy of a Block S? If
Hammett were really sincere in his remark he would
decline a Block S for baseball this year because he
does not deserve it any more than the rugby players â– 
do! j
