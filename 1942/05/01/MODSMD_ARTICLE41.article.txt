# 'Song of the Islands' Stars Gable, Mature

"SONG OF '111E ISLANDS," now playing at (.lie Stanford in Palo Alto.
"Song of the Islands" opens with Hawaiian harmonizing by a silvery
waterfall on the isle of Ahmie Ohni. First Betty Graldc (in technicolor)
comes gliding over the blue Pacific sliding into the notes of her song in a
ghastly fashion. Then Victor Mature comes gliding along in a sailboat.
And there you have it. *

The end of the picture, by the
same Hawaiian waterfall, features
the hula girls in a jitterbug version
of an Irish jig celebrating St. Pat
rick's Day.
Recent rumors that the Grable
figure is gravitating, let it be inter
jected. arc pure propaganda.
In the other picture, Jane With
ers joins a 4H club and raises a
bull. The best performance in this
classic is by a black lamb.â€”Covey
