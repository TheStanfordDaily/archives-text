tion the students who elected them
expect in the administration of the
Honor Code.
' This is probably one of the most
important polls taken among Stan
ford students for some time," said
Miss Kimball.
"If a student jots down the first
thing that comes into his mind so
that he can dash off to the Libe, the
poll will be a complete failure," she
continued.

or ask the suspected person to re
port himself to Council if guijty.
4. Do you consider cheating in
short quiz7.es as serious as cheating
in midquarters and finals?
The Councils want to know if the
student body believes that offenders
in quizzes should be dealt with in
the same manner as persons guilty
of cheating in important tests.
5. Do you think that all viola
tors should be punished by ex

not?
The question here is whether or
not there should be any exceptions
