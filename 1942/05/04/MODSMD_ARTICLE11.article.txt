# Junior Scrunch Set for Friday
## 
### 
Junior Scrunch, a highlight of
Junior Week-end, will be initiated
on the Farm Friday, May 8, at 6 p.m.
The location has not been definitely
decided.
Every junior is urged to buy a
ticket in order to make the affair
a howling success. Tickets may be
purchased from junior council mem
bers for 55 cents.
Under co-chairmen Chris Moody
and Jack Pugh, a varied program
has been planned. After the barbe
cue, there will be informal dancing,
a song-fest, and other features in
cluding old-time movies with the
bouncing ball.
"This is one occasion of the year
which brings the class together,"
said Don Dillon, junior president.
