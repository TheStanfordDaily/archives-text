The program was planned at the
request of the students as a follow

Kreps and Dr. Bernard Haley spon
sored by the Consumer Education
Committee, according to Collins.
Collins further declared, "Student
participation must consist of more
than signing up for committees.
Committees can be successful super

co-operation from every student.
Each individual must know and ac
cept his responsibility."
