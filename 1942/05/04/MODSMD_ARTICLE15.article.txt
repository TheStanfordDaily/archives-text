# R.O.T.C. Plans Military Ball
## 
### 
On Saturday night, May 22, Stan
ford students will honor the men who
are leaving the campus in June to
join the armed forces. The occasion
will be the annual military dance
which emerges this year as the high
light of Stanford's social events for
'41 and '42. The dance will be held
in the Pavilion, and anyone on cam
pus may attend.
Since the war is daily becoming
j more of a reality at Stanford, the
j military theme of the dance prom
j ises more unusual and interesting
| decorations than any other dance
j could offer. French 75-mm. light
cannon will guard the entrance to
i the Pavilion which will be decorated
with a variety of appropriate mili
tary equipment. Dancers will en
ter the Pavilion to the theme song
of the dance, the popular Field Ar
tillery Song.
According to Bill Smith, Scab
bard and Blade publicity chairman
for tbe dance, "The military dance
this year will be on a much larger
scale than in past years. We arc
still making arrangements for an
orchestra, but 1 know that any of
the ones that we are considering
will be well received by the stu
dents. The colorful military setting
of the dance should add to its suc
cess and provide something to re
member for those who attend."
The proceeds of the dance will go
to the Army Relief charity. Army
j Relief provides money for the wid
ows and orphans of men killed in
action.
