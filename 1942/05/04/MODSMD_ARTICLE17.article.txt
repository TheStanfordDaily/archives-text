# Angna Enters Mixes Careers
## Concert Series Star Dances, Acts, Writes 
### 
Angna Enters, who will be pre
sented by the Concert Series in the
Memorial Theater Wednesday eve
ning at 8:15, is not only a dancer
and actress but. an author as well.
Miss Enters made her debut in
New York in 1926, which was fol
lowed two years later by her Lon
don debut. She has made numer
ous transcontinental tours since and
has written two successful books en
route.
An accomplished painter, she car
ries her sketchbooks with her on
her tours and has given exhibits of
her work in 22 art centers in the
United States and England. The
Metropolitan Museum of Art has
recently purchased one of her paint
ings.
The result of her travels and study
of culture of ancient civilizations
in Greece, Egypt, and the Near East
is something new in the theater. She
uses the dance to portray not only
the grace of movement, but the more
subtle emotions of tragedy, comedy,
and the rapier-edged quality of her
satire.
Season ticket holders will be ad
mitted on presentation of their Cor
nelia Otis Skinner tickets. A few
single tickets at $1.65 and $2.20 are
available at the Concert Series office
in the Union.
