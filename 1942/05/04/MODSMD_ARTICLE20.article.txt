# LOUIS FISCHER BLASTS RACE HATRED AS PEACE BARRIER
## 
### LOUIS FISCHER 
(Editor's Note: Beginning to
day, The Daily will print a series
of five articles on the next peace
from "Dawn of Victory" by Louis
Fischer.

There could be a third world war.
The war of 1914-1918 was sup
posed to be a "war to end wars." We
won it, but it failed to end wars. A
war may be won and then lost in
the peace that follows it. A war may
also be lost while it is being won.
Realistically, the chief element in
the next peace will be the attitude
of the victorious nations toward the
defeated nations. In England I there
fore tried to find out what the Brit
ish were thinking and feeling about
Germans. There is much less hate
for Germany in this war than in the
last war. The hate is directed
against "him." against Hitler. When
there is an air raid, the English say,
" 'He' was over last night." Hitler
and the Nazi "gangs of bandits." as

Winston Churchill has called them,
are blamed for Germany's crimes,
not the German people. There
would, accordingly, be no emotional
barrier in Britain toward a sensible,
liberal |>eacc with the German
people.
This is important, for if you
erect such a barrier in war you
may ruin the peace. The senti
ments created and aroused during
the present war will shape the
peace. In a very exact sense,
therefore, the peace is being made
every day of the war. . . .
While only a very small minority
of British people are emotionally
j anti-German — and I think this is
equally true today of America—
Englishmen are being subjected to
propaganda which aims to make
them intellectually anti-German.
Lord Vansittart, former permanent
chief of the British Foreign Office, is
the leader of the school of thought
which blames the German race, not
the Nazis, for this war, for the last

j war, in fact, for most of the Euro
j pcan wars of modern times. Van
sittartism is a growing trend.
In his book, "Black Record,"
and regularly in the Conservative
"London Sunday Times," Vansit- ]
tart dissects German history and |
concludes that Frederick the Great
and the Kaiser were only earlier
Hitlers and thai the Germans are
a "race of hooligans" and willing
dupes of rapacious, militaristic
conqucrors. "Generations of us j
have never tasted real peace," he
writes, "and we never will taste it
until the incubus is removed."
A "drastic" cure must therefore
be administered to the German peo
ple which "will take at least a gen- ;
eration." "The soul" of Germany i
must be changed. Vansittart asserts,
j The victors must bring about the "re
generation of the Brazen Horde"—
j the German people.
In thus placing on Germany the
sole guilt for many decades of Eu
i ropean wws, Vansittart seems to .

be looking ahead to his kind of
vindictive peace. But actually he
is looking backward. Whatever
Vansittart's personal motive, the
Implication of Germany's "black
record" is that Britain's record is
white.
If Germany made all the wars,
then the rest of us are innocent;
nothing was wrong in England or
France or America or Russia be
fore this war; it was not Neville
Chamberlain and the Conservative
appeasers; it was not social evils—
it was Germany. And so, after this
war, all we have to do is to deal
properly with Germany and we
will have peace. By burdening Ger
many with all the blame for the
world's ills the British Tories seek
to absolve themselves and to coun
teract the tendency toward post-war
reform in British domestic affairs
and in international organization.
The thesis would be: Oidy Germany
is respons&le for the war; Britain
is not at fault; so why alter any

thing in the British economic, social
or political systems?
i Vansittartism is Conservative
propaganda for the status quo
which existed before the war.
Neville Chamberlain was an ap
peaser largely because he feared
that in a war the old England lie
loved would die and be succeeded
by a new progressive England.
But Churchill believes that the old
English order can fight the war
and win it and thereby win for
itself the right to go on living.
Churchill has repeatedly discour
aged discussion of peace.
When optimists plan for world
! reconstruction and world federation
their schemes are branded on "Es
cape to Utopia," and they are ad
i vised to win the war first. Mean
while. however, the Tories are
j erecting bulwarks against a better
kind of solidly organized pe.ice by
implying that all this is not neces
sary. "You merely have to put Ger
! many in her place."
