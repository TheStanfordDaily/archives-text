BULLETIN
SAN FRANCISCO, May 1 (Monday).—San Francisco underwent its
eighth blackout of the war for 15 minutes last night when an unidenti
fied target was detected approaching the coast. It later was found to
he friendly.
The 4th Interceptor Command, which ordered the blackout at
11:15 p.m., said cities of the San Francisco Bay Area were affected.
The blackout was lifted at midnight.
"After a preliminary 'yellow' warning at 11:02 p.m., a 'blue' alert
was sounded at ll:o3Vii p.m., when radio stations left the air," the
interceptor command announced.

Stanford's eighth blackout went off "very well" with (he wardens
"functioning beautifully," according to John YV. Dodds, chief warden.
Fifteen minutes after the blue and yellow alerts, called through
simultaneously in this district, every warden was at his post, Dodds
said. Just how complete the blackout was here could not be deter
mined last night, since the various wardens do not give their reports
until the following day.

CHUNGKING, iVlay '•> (UP). —Chinese bombers, plunging into action
fcr the lirst time under American fighter escort, made a ravaging attack
on the Japanese-occupied airport at Lashio this afternoon, reviving hopes
over the losing battle of Burma despite an official announcement that
Mandaiay, the provisional capital, has fallen.

Parked Japanese planes, runways,
I hangars, barracks and a large fuel
storage dump were blown up by
| bombs or riddled with gunfire from
j low-flying American volunteer
group fighter planes, an AVG head-
I quarters communique announced. It
was the first appearance of the "Chi
nese bombardment group" since the
Changsha (South China) campaign
' i in December and January and, al
though it was not revealed imme
diately whether the Chinese were
now in position to launch a sus
tained bombing campaign in Burma,
there has been a noticeable rise in
spirit in Chungking for the past two
days.
In addition to capturing the
> charred ruins of Mandaiay on Fri
day, the Japanese have driven 58
. miles north from captured Lashio,
the old Burma Road terminus, to
the town of Kweichieh, only 52
miles from Bhavo.
The drive seems to be shaping into
a broad encircling pincers movement
which may possibly sever communi
cations lines between China and
Burma completely.
There was little semblance of a
continuous land front left, but vio
lent tank, artillery and infantry
battles were reported raging in sev
eral sectors held by Chinese and
British Imperials north and west of
Mandaiay and northeast of Lashio,
along the Burma Road, where the
Japanese were within 50 miles of
China's frontier.
A British communique from New
Delhi said an Indian Ghurka brigade
equipped with tanks and artillery
completed a "very successful action"
along the Irrawaddy River, near
Mandaiay, pouring more than 700
rounds of shells into one enemy po
sition that could be seen suffering
"very heavy casualties."

"functioning beautifully," according to John YV. Dodds, chief warden.
Fifteen minutes after the blue and yellow alerts, called through
simultaneously in this district, every warden was at his post, Dodds
said. Just how complete the blackout was here could not be deter
mined last night, since the various wardens do not give their reports
until the following day.
