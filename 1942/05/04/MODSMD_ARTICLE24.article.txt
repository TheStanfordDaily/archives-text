# British Hit Three Nazi Men of War
## Scharnhorst Crippled By. R.A.F. Bombers; Eugen Is Torpedoed 
### 
LONDON, May 3 (UP).- Three of
Germany's finest men of war, the
2ii.oUo-ton battleships Schurnhorst
and Gncisenau, and the 10,000-ton
cruiser Prinz Eugen are so badly
damaged they will be out of action
lor many weeks, and Hitler's hopes
of massing a fleet to blockade ihc
Allied Arctic supply route to Russia
this spring have been dashed, it was
revealed tonight.
The Eugen has been knocked out
by British submarine torpedoes and
Ihe two battleships by RAF bombs
;nd "probably" by British mines,
the Admiralty and Air Ministry an
nounced in a joint communique,
adding that serious damage to all
three ships now have been proved
by RAF reconnaissance.
With the flow of American and
British supplies over the Murmansk
route now at its peak, bolstering the
Russians for their supreme test
against German invaders, Hitler now
lias available for surface raiding in
that area only the new, 35,000-ton
battleship Tirpitz, the 10,000-ton
pocket battleship Admiral Scheer,
the heavy cruiser Hipper, and some
s nailer cruisers and destroyers, ac
cording to information available here.
"J h it whole fleet is practically bottled
i p in a fjord near Trondheim, Nor
way, under constant scrutiny of RAF
fiiers and subject to battle challenge
by the British home fleet the moment
it puts to sea.
Hitler risked all three of the dam
aged ships Feb. 12 in a run from the
French port of Brest, through the
English Channel to north German
ports. He apparently wanted them
in action in time to prey on the
United Nations' Murmansk route
when the heavy spring shipments of
Russian war supplies got moving.
British air, coastal and sea forces
contested their passage through the
channel and came out second best in
the skirmish, but they delivered tell
ing blows on the three big Nazi
ships at the time and have kept
them in constant trouble ever since.
Though more than two months have
elapsed, the British communique
said, RAF reconnaissance has estab
lished that all of these powerful
warships still are undergoing re
pairs.

Hint for drivers: Forty less winks
in bed in the morning may mean
forty less stitches for the doctor to
take after the crack-up!
