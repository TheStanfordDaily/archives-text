What about the '•port situation next quarter? Will the fields turn green
or will there he a few of (he hoys kicking up the dust out there .just to
keep filings going?
At present, prospects seem pretty bright for competitive sports this
summer—better than any previous year. The B.A.C. is ready to go all the

way in promoting the idea, for
they've heard the Washington slo
gan, "Health and vigor are a pri
mary consideration in winning the
war."
Dr. O. N. Anderson and Don
I.iehendorfcr are all for the idea
of a full summer program. They
say if Dr. J. P. Mitchell is correct
in surmizing that there will be
from a 2,000 (o 2,500 enrollment
summer quarter there are greater
possibilities fcr kicking up that
dust than ever before. Anyway,
the department is keeping the en
tin 1 personnel to teach all of the
physical education courses.
Dr. Anderson said that it certainly
looks as though there will be intra
mural and other competition in any
sport in which teams are formed.
There can be nothing definite, how
ever, until after actual enrollment
is counted.
Even though the B.A.C. is fix
ing firm week to week, month to
month as far as its schedule is con
cerned. competitive games are be
ing planned with teams around
the bay area and with service
teams like Camp Roberts. There
will be softball. tennis, soccer,
horseshoes, and maybe rugby.
They are even going to have a
course in football methods and ath
letic instruction if there is enough
interest. And. this is a course for
both men and women. Why women?
because through a recent survey it
was found that there is a great
shortage of physical education in
structors in juni >r colleges and high
: eliools. One-half of the instructors
are now in the service.
This new summer quarter
course provides concentrated in
struction in athletic directorship
so (hat the vacancies may be filled.
According to Dr. Anderson, wom
en will soon be athletic instructors
—teaching the hoys how to play
football. I can't quite see it my
self—but times have changed.
Tenni season is coming up. This
year the Wrongest group of four that
has ever reprt < nted one university
heads back for the National Inter
eollegiales at Tulane University,
June 22. Ted Schroeder, Larry Dee,
Emery Neale and Jimmy Wade will
be there for Stanford.
According to Johnny Lamb,
their coach. Schroeder should win
the singles and the doubles with
Dee. . . . Dee is a "grca( player"
and i! he comes through will place

high in singles. . . . Neale is best
011 clay and could he a tourna
ment dark horse. . . . Wade should
get at least to the semi-finals of
doubles with Neale plus the quar
ters in singles.
