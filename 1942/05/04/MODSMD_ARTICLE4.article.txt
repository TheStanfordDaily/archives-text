# Stanford Without Honor?
## 
### 
(Editorial)
EACH time Stanford's Honor Code is broken, the national aca
demic status of Stanford University is lowered.
Why?
Because each student who cheats has received his degree
without doing the amount of work required by Stanford for grad
uation.
Each time Stanford's Honor Code is broken, men and women
of Stanford lose a part of the esteem with which a Stanford
student is regarded.
Why?
Because the Honor Code is administered by the students of
Stanford.
Tonight, in the various living groups, Stanford will poll itself
on the Honor Code. It will attempt to decide, in the long run,
whether the 20-year-old Code is fit to live. Not, of course, that
the tally of tonight's questionnaire will establish the Code as In
or Out. But it will determine the two Councils' approach to the
question of violations in the future. .
Men's and Women's Councils want to know just how the
students, whom they represent, feel about the Code. Lately they
haven't been able to judge. This year no student has reported
a violation. But the faculty has—plenty of them.
Take your time on that questionnaire tonight. Answer it care
fully and honestly—for the sake of your University. And for the
sake of yourself.
