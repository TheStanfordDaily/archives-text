# Broncs Dump Card Nine, 17-7
## 
### 
The only gleam of light in the
gloom of the Cardinal baseball rec
ord was the .400 batting average
rung up for the season by first base
man Ray Hammett, as a 17-7 de
feat by Santa Clara's Broncs put the
Stanfcrds deep in the C.1.8.A. cel
lar.
Tragedy struck in the first inning
as the Broncos opened with two
walks, two singles, and a double by
the first six men at bat. Bill Wilson
took command but the inning kept
on until the Broncs had pushed a
'I'-al of eight runs over the plate.
The Santa Clarans were never
headed after this. Brone pitcher Dick
Smith kept the 10 Indian hits spread
out over all nine innings.
Louis Briganti took top Bronc
scoring honors with a triple, a
double, and a brace of singles. On
the Indian side, Hammett hit
four for live to bring in four runs
and make two himself.

WASHINGTON. May 3 (UP). A

former citizens from the Canadian
to the United States armed forces.
