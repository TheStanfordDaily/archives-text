# Come Down to Earth

IN days gone by, there has been no innuendo
which aroused the ire of a loyal Stanfordite
more than the insinuation that he dwells happily
and obliviously in an Ivory Tower. Although
heretofore, such an indignation may have been
justified, today the innuendo has an unpleas
antly sound basis to it.
The battlements of the Ivory Tower are being
built higher and reinforced when they should
be torn down. There are beautiful examples
of head-hiding-in-sand on all sides.
Of course, we are not the only ones who are
playing madly at the game of ostrich. It has
already been mentioned that the managing edi
tor of a San Francisco paper remarked the other
day that the edition with the headline "Bataan
Falls" barely sold the normal number of copies
while it was hard to print enough papers carry
ing the banner "Tokyo Bombed."
People just don't want to read the bad news.
And neither do we. But it's there, and it's a
part of this war.
We lightly pass over the disasters as some
thing that would be better if never mentioned.
We drive our cars to the city at the usual rate
of speed, forgetting that gasoline and rubber are
two of the prime necessities for our war effort.
Some of us should still consider what this war
is all about and what we are fighting for—
freedom of speech, press, assembly, worship.
The Germans listen only to radio programs pre
scribed by the propaganda ministry. The Japa
nese can read only what is printed in govern
ment-controlled newspapers.
We are ignorant of such restrictions but it is
going to take a lot of concentrated effort on
the part of everyone within the borders of the
United States to remain in such blissful igno
rance.
Although some of us seem to be afraid to
wake up to the full significance, Stanford is a
part of the United States. This concentrated
effort involves us too.
Buying War Savings Stamps is a part of it.
So is taking a bus to San Francisco and observ
ing Carless Wednesdays. It all adds up to "do
ing our part." And is there any question that
it is worth it?
The plus sign in the equation that has victory
and our way of life as the end product is
summed up in Franklin Roosevelt's speech of
Dec. 8, 1941.
". . . With confidence in our armed forces—
with the unbounded determination of our peo
ple—we will gain the inevitable triumph—so
help us God. . . ."—Martha Deane
