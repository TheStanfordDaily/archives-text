ANOTHER force is bringing up its siege guns
in preparation for the attack on Stanford's
"ivory" bastions. It is the 12:10 Club, a revised
and reorganized version of the old Luncheon
Club. With a policy of "an interesting speaker,
or none at all," and a new group of backers, the
club bows in at 12:10 p.m. Wednesday in the
Nitery.
Certainly this week's speaker is an excellent
choice. Scott Newhall, as editor of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle's "This World" since 1938, has
watched the news with an editor's all-inclusive
eye since Munich pushed off the world's snow
balling path into Hell.
No day-by-day commentator, Scott Newhall
must look at the news in perspective; and "This
World" is one of the finest newspaper maga
zines of its type. He will have something worth
while to say.
Scheduled for a week from Wednesday is
Colonel William Boekel, head of Japanese evac
uation for the whole Pacific Coast. Clearly lie
y/ill have something worth while to say, too.
And the list of future prospects is a formi
dable one—James Stewart, John Steinbeck, and
William Saroyan, among others.
All this and lunch—for 35 cents. It wouldn't
be possible, if the Mothers' Club weren't back
ing the club. They're giving their support be
cause they feel the new organization is worth
while. We all know that the "worth while" is
sometimes dull. But we have Isabel Fawcett's
word that this won't be dull; and the list of
speakers certainly backs up Miss Fawcett's
contention.
Clearly, speakers at the 12:10 Club will have
something to say. It might be well if Stanford
listened.
