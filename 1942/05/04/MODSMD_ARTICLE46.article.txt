r jpIREE Congressional fighting points have sprouted
from the President s anti-inflation program: the
personal income, farm parity prices, and wage stabili
zation.
Defiant words came from members'of the House
Ways and Means Committee in resistance to the drastic
$25,000 personal income limit. No Congressman had
the courage to state to the press his reasons for oppo
sition.
Whatever frankness Congressmen may lack on this
subject, Westbrook Pegler has supplied:
"I think the country may thank the United Auto
mobile Workers of the CIO for the revolutionary sug
gestion of a top limit on the price of every Ameri
can's ability and ingenuity," he writes.
Mr. Pegler was referring to the UAW's demand that
war manufacturers be compelled to make equal sacri
fices to those accepted by the auto workers when they
waived all overtime pay for week-end and holiday
work which comes within the limits of the 40-hour
week.
So it's revolutionary for Americans to give their
ability to a cause greater than money! In that ease
Mr. Pegler's "revolution" has infested our armed
forceÂ§. Let's hope it penetrates the higher income
brackets with equal success.
The Farm Bloc is still holding out for the farmers'
"social gains" that it log-rolled through both houses
in the 110 per cent parity price legislation on farm
products. Public opinion has condemned this minority
favoritism too strongly for the Farm Bloc to carry
much weight in coming Congressional debates.
The fact that the President's wage stabilization plan
does not require legislation has not quieted the con
troversy on this issue. Although the House naval af
fairs committee tabled the Smith-Vinson bill, both
Congress and the public are still upset about the fail
ure to freeze wages.
Such a measure would result in severe inequali
ties between the wages of defense and non-defense
workers. Latest available figures show that the cost of
living from February, 1941, to February, 1942, has
risen 11.7 per cent. During that period defense in
dustry wages, including base rates plus overtime, have
increased about 25 per cent. Wages in the retail trades,
telephone and telegraph, hotel, street railway, and
laundry industries have risen only 6 to 9 per cent for
the same period.
Wage freezing would make it practically impossible
for these necessary consumer industries to obtain
labor. Wage raises are a product of competitive em
ployer demand as well as union pressure. Wage
freezing would not stop the current employer prac
tice of increasing wages by large-scale promotion to
higher paid positions in order to lure the scarce supply
of skilled and semi-skilled labor.
Since Pearl Harbor, time lost by strikes has been
less than 1 per cent of total working hours. That fig
ure is now reduced to almost zero. Creation of the
War Labor Board, accompanied by the voluntary
AFL-CIO promise to abandon the right to strike dur
ing the war has apparently insured labor-employer
peace for the duration.
Now the problem seems to have resolved itself down
to a program of upper-class education, through which
men of the Pegler turn of mind could be informed
in easy one-syllable words about The War and What
Losing It Will Mean.
