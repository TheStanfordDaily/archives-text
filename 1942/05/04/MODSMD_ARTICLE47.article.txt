... SO I'M AT STANFORD
terrible has happened to the ratio. A
k terrible thing has happened, all right. There are
too many women. War has struck the campus with
a vengeance. You can't say we are isolated. You
can't say we're immune. You can't even say we're
ivory tower any more. Good God, man, do you realize
that the ratio is one point nine!
This is an alarming thing. For years Stanford men
suffered under the inequalities of a three-to-one set
up and Stanford women gloried in it. But now the
tables are turned and the chances are this will have
devastating repercussions on every aspect of University
life.
The first thing we had better do is keep it a secret.
The University is having a hard enough time paying
its bills already and if this awful thing ever got out,
the Ad Building could simply lock up and close shop.
I can't imagine who would want to come to Stanford
under these new conditions. I can't picture anyone
wanting to come, knowing that there is a male short
age here.
Myself, when I was choosing a college, I found it a
toss-up between Harvard and Stanford. I looked at
the registrar's statistics for Harvard and found that
they had a pretty good ratio, a little belter than Stan
ford's in fact. It was a difficult decision, all right.
Finally the Hoover War Libe decided me. I chose
Stanford. Now they tell me I can't get in the Hoover
Libe until I graduate.
I think that is a lousy trick. If the Administration
thinks it is going to trick me into staying a fifth year
by playing hard to get with its public buildings, I
won't be tricked. When I think of all the people that
came to Stanford on account of the ratio, and I came
for the Hoover War Libe, well, it just isn't fair. All
I want to do is spit down from the top floor . . .

HPHE Hoover Library may be hard to get into, but
it is even harder to get out of. I went there one
day to see for myself.
I walked up the steps and into the cold silent halls
and stood there, my chubby face pressed between two
bronze doors, peeking into the inner sanctum. There
was nothing inside the library. Sure, there were a lot
of fat books and musty looking documents and two or
three pallid librarians, but it didn't look like there
were any likely prospects for a coke date in there; in
fact, the only people I saw were two old ladies who
were sitting by the window and knitting and they
looked as though they had been left by accident dur
ing Back to the Farm week.
I think those ladies have been there ever since the
library was built. They might have even been part of
the architect's plan. They might have even been
there before the Library, just sitting pleasantly on a
bench and knitting, and suddenly this gargantuan
structure w;is reared around them and they were trap
ped. Trapped with a lot of documents on war, revo
lution, and peace, and no Lucky Strikes.
Here is the ratio. Here is the fact that we are too
many women at Stanford. And over here is the Hoover
War Libe. Over here is the library which is difficult
to get in, yes, but impossible to get out of. Doesn't
that suggest anything to your imagination?
It does to mine. I can see it all. I can see it all
very clearly. Stanford women could organize into
two rival factions and we would have perpetual civil
war. The object would be to dump as many of the
women on the other side as possible into the Hoover
Libe. get them in some way, any way, and then we
would never have to worry about their getting out.
This would have a two-fold advantage. It would
decrease the surplus femajb population on the Farm
and at the same time liveit things up considerably over
the library. I think someone should ask Mr, Hoover
if please we can't use his library this way. Part of
civilian defense, y'know.
