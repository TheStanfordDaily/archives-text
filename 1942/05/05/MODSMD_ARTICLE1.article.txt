which will conform to the dictates
of Harold Stanley Marcus, clothes
boss of the WPB.
PROLONGING CLOTHES LIFE
The differences in material, the
ways that the "current silhouette"
has been frozen by Marcus' order of
April 15, and the methods which can
be used in care of clothes to pro
long their life will be illustrated by
the models during the show from 4
to 5 p.m.

models in the Nitery Thursday, May
