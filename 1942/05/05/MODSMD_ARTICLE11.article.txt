# Students Rush Ration Board
## 
### 
Stanford's branch of the Sugar
Rationing Board yesterday reported
an unexpected first-day rush among
students to secure their ration books.
Non-student campus residents, how
ever, are showing much less co
operation, officials said.

estimate — exact figures concerning
the number of books issued are not
yet available—the majority of per
sons at Stanford have yet to apply
for their books. Applications must
be made at the campus school on
Santa Ynez Way by Thursday at 9
p.m. The Board will be registering
Stanfordites from 1 to 9 p.m. today,
tomorrow, and Thursday.
Members of fraternities, sorori
ties, dormitories, and eating clubs
must take out individual ration
books and turn them over to their
house managers. Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls, stated
that no plan has yet been made for
handling books in the halls.
The Ration Board warns every
one to register, whether he uses
sugar or not, for it is probable that
the books will be used in rationing
other commodities in the near fu
ture.
All persons over 18 years old must
register on campus, according to the
Board. Parents of those under 18
will have to apply for their books at
{ their home residences. Students
