# Law School Plans Summer Program
## 
### 
Announcing that first-year law
courses will this year be taught
summer quarter as well as fall, the
Stanford law school has asked that
all students planning to enter the
school apply for admission as soon
as possible. Application blanks may
be secured from the Secretary of
the School of Law, Room 1.
The law school, in adapting itself
to the speed-up in education caused
by the war, has modified its program
so that students with junior stand
ing may be admitted.
