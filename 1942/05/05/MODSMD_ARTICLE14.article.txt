# 'THE WORLD IS SICK'-FISCHER

### LOUIS FISCHER 
(Editor's Note: This is the sec
j ond of a series of artieles on peace
from "Dawn of Victory" by Louis
Fischer, Nation foreign corre
| spondent and author of the best
seller, "Men and Politics.")

A peace with retribution would
make millions of innocents suffer
with the guilty. It would also ig
nore the truth that Hitler, Mussolini,
Stalin, the Tokio militarists, Franco,
and other lesser totalitarians are not
merely personal devils or expres
sions of national peculiarities but
the products of vast world changes.
I The world has been sick. It was sick
| before Hitler. In fact. Hitler and the
' other dictators are symptoms of the
: disease. The dictatorships are a
misconceived attempt to cure the
I disease.
Hitler is a hurricane tearing at
j the foundations of modern society.

If the structure had not been rot
ten he would not have succeeded in
destroying so much of it. If democ
racy in Europe had been real, it
would not have succumbed to Hitler
and Mussolini. The defeat of Hitler.
I Mussolini, and Japan, therefore, is
not enough. Having defeated them
I he world must defeat the conditions
j that made them.
President Roosevelt, referring to
j the future peace, said in a fireside
chat ill June. 1941, "We will not
accept a world like (he post-war
world of the 1920'5, in which the
seeds of Ilitlerism can again he
planted and allowed to grow." Our
job is thus not the annihilation of
Germans. We must build a new
world with a climate which would
not permit Hitlers to be horn.
Hitler's New Order, though he
seeks to fashion it with the tank,
bayonet, and lash, is nevertheless
based on the healthy idea that there

must be a unified Europe without
high national barriers obstructing
sensible economic co-operation. The
Roosevelt-Churchill Atlantic Char
ter, dated August 14. 1941, and ad
hered to by 24 additional govern
ments on January 1, 1942, pledges
the signatory powers "to endeavor,
with due respect for their existing
obligations, to further the enjoyment
by all states, great and small, victor
and vanquished, of access, on equal
I terms, to the trade and to Ihe raw
I materials of the world which are
j needed for their economic prosper-
I ity '
This describes something which
has not been done before in the
world; it has not even been at
tempted. World trade and the
world's raw materials have not
been equitably distributed. That
is the cause of many of our trou
bles. The fascist states proposed
to redistribute raw materials by

seizing the wealth of (heir neigh
bors. But the problem is not solved
by grabbing what others had pre
viously grabbed. Such an attempt
led to this war and would lead to
endless wars. The redistribution
should be by just and fair agree
ment; but redistribution there
must be.
When the Atlantic Charter pledges
that "victor or vanquished" will be
included in this economic reform it
recognizes that the defeated nations
mult be part of the peace and not
only its victims. I cannot imagine
how the victors could proceed if they
decided to omit Germany, Italy, and
Japan from future economic cures.
The omission would vitiate the cure.
As Foreign Secretary Eden declared
on July 29. 1941. "A starving and
bankrupt Germany in the midst of
Europe would poison all of us who
are her neighbors. That is not sen
timent. It is common sense."
