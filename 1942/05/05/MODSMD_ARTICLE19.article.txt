that ocupation of militarily im
portant parts of the colony was in

threat of an Axis, and especially
Japanese, occupation of the island —
was announced by the State Depart
ment after the news was received by
President Roosevelt.
Emphasizing that Madagascar will
be held in "trust" for France until
the war ends, the department bluntly

her own interest—hangs the fate of
already tottering Franco-American
diplomatic relations.
The department notified French
Ambassador Gaston Henry-Haye c,f
