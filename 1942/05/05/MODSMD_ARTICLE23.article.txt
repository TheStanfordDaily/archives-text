# Thousands of Products Affected by New Order
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 4 (UP).â€”The
War Production Board tonight or
dered thousands of factories to halt,
within 90 days, the use of iron and
steel in the manufacture of more
than 400 every day civilian products
ranging from fountain pens to bath
tubs.
In one of the most-sweeping con
servation orders yet issued, the
WPB thus advised these civilian in
dustries that they have the alterna
tive of obtaining war orders, finding
substitute metals not on the critical
list, or going out of business for the
duration.
The order will affect the lives
of every American by choking off
further production of such com
modities as pie plates, mail boxes,
compacts, cigarette lighters, ice
cube trays, hat frames, hedge
shears, door knockers, snow shov
els, cocktail shakers, and stainless
steel kitchen ware.
