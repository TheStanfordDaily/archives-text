# Medical School Hears Newman Liquor Report
## One Ounce of Alcohol Shows No Effect On Muscular Control 
### 
A person of "average size" can
ordinarily consume a little more than
an ounce of pure alcohol, the amount
in a couple of bar drinks, without
a significant breakdown in neuro
muscular co-ordination.
This is the opinion of Dr. Ilenpy
W. Newman, neuropsychiatrist and
associate professor of medicine in
the Stanford School of Medicine,
who reported last night on two years
of medical research on the effect of
alcohol on individual performance.
BEER TAKES LONGER
If the alcohol is taken as beer or
wine, about 50 per cent more may
be imbibed because the slow absorp
tion of these beverages reduces the
maximum concentration in the blood,
the Stanford medical researcher said.
"However, whether such a dose
produces deterioration of judgment
which would render the l person
reckless on the highway we cannot
say," Dr. Newman declared in his
talk in Lane Hall at the Stanford
Medical School on "Alcohol in Re
lation to Driving Hazards."
WOMEN DRIVERS?
"There are too many drivers who
show a lack of proper judgment
when cold sober for me to want to
guarantee their performance when
given even a little alcohol," he added.
The effect on individuals of a given
amount of alcohol varies widely, de
pending on a number of factors, the
Stanford researchers found early
in their study. Among these fac
tors are the type of beverage, the
presence of food in the stomach, the
period over which the drinking was
done, and the emotional state of
the individual. The "body build"
also affects the concentration of al
cohol which may be absorbed into
the blood.
"Alcohol is one of the few sub
stances that may be absorbed di
rectly from the stomach; thus the ab
sorption of alcohol taken with a meal
is much slower than when it is taken
on an empty stomach," Dr. Newman
said.
