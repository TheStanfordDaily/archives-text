# SCRIMMAGES SPARK SPRING GRIDDERS

### DON SELBY 
Things aren't what they used to he in Stanford's football picture.
Of course, you know Jim Lawson has replaced Clark I). Shaugh
nessy. That's old stulT. hut it's the reason things have changed.
Anyone who witnessed Stanford football practice sessions while
Shaughnessy cracked the whip can tell the difference.
There is more informality now. The gates are open, although they'll
probably close as soon as too many spectators start coming through them.
And the Indian football players aren't getting their football in such con
centrated doses. But there is no doubt but what real football is being
taught.
As he stated before practice even started, Lawson isn't making this
spring drill a do-or-die proposition. His main idea is to get a line on
the players he didn't see in action a lot last season, which includes not
only the boys who will be sophomores next fall and the transfers but
also some of the fellows who were on the varsity last year.
And he's trying to get all the men thoroughly oriented with the T
formation so that when fall practice rolls around, the team will really
be able to go to work in earnest, not having to worry about the funda
mentals of the system.
The general practice scheduled for the last couple of weeks has
called for a half hour of scrimmage to wind up the hour and a half
session, with the first hour being used for various phases ol workâ€”
plays, passing, kicking, blocking, tackling, etc.
And the boys certainly go for this scrimmage. One of the boys at
practice last Friday said:

'"It's really keen this spring. We work for an hour, scrimmage for
half an hour, and then we go in. Last year we worked all the time and
hardly scrimmaged at all."
CoumNng the several veteran gridders who haven't turned out regu
larly to date, Stanford's material for next year's football team appears
to lie good. For with a line that boasts Chuck Taylor, Bruno Banducci,
Loren LaPrade, Hank Norberg, Ed McCain. Ed Stamm, Lawson could
hardly moan. And he isn't.
"There are a lot of these new boys who are coming along well," said
Lawson. There are so many new men among the 77 boys out this spring
that the coaches can hardly remember all their names.
If Stanford's football isn't fast next year, it won't be because Law
son hasn't tried his darnedest to make it that way. In line with his
drive for speed, the new head coach has shifted Milt Yucinich, No. 1
fullback last year, to center, leaving Buck Fawcett, Al Cole, Hoot
Armstrong, and Bill Sheller as the main veteran backs.
And new boys like Jim Pettit and Al Hoisch, who have speed to
burn, are likely to play a lot of ball, what with the way Lawson craves
swiftness.
Cole and Ray Hammett will probably stage quite a battle for Frankie
Albert's old quarterback spot. Cole has speed, running ability, and a lot
of football sense. In fact, Lawson is looking for him to be just as good
a play-caller as Albert was.
Hammett, on the other hand, is a great student of football, studying
every phase of the game so that he knows it forward and backward.
His passing is a little more deliberate.
