# Trackmen Face Trojan Tussle
## 
### 
With some top-notch performances I
turned in at the Pacific Association's j
track carnival at Berkeley last Sat- j
urday, the cindermen of Coach Pitch
Johnson are eyeing the U.S.C. tussle
this week-end at Los Angeles.
One of the big surprises in the
meet was when Wyland Cripe ran a
good second to Bobby Madrid, the
Fresno State dynamo, in the unoffi
cial time of 4:27.2. This was but six
seconds behind the mark set up by
Madrid.
COM Pi ON SUBSTITUTES
Bob Compton left his favorite
race, the mile run, to substitute for
Cripe in the 880, and came in fifth,
the time being 1:57.2. This l'ace was
won by Johnny Fulton of the frosh,
whose terrific sprint in the last two
hundred yards was too much for
Thelmo Knowles of San Jose State.
At the present it is undecided who
will run the mile and the 880 for
Stanford this Saturday.
Don Reiss, after having trouble
clearing the barriers in the 120 high
hurdles, came back to take a second
in 24.7 in the 220 low hurdles, behind
Trojan Les Browning. Reiss was the
PA. official winner, because U.S.C.
athletes were invited to compete,
and their points did not count in the
tabulation.
NEILSEN IMPROVES
Right behind Reiss, and beating
out the old Olympic Club veteran
was Glenn Nielsen in fourth place.
Nielsen has been improving with
great strides, and each week he
comes through with a surprisingly
well-run race. He is capable of 24.4
in the lows, the time he ran for a
third in the Big Meet.
Two ineligible Stanford runners
competed, and turned in very good
times, considering that it was their
first taste of competition this year.
Bills finished third, a yard behind
Cripe in the mile, his time being
4:27.9. Wayne Girdner took fifth in
the 880, turning in the good time of
1:57.7.
Hank Norberg was unable to qual
ify for the finals in the Big Meet, but
flipped out the discus 141 feet 2
inches, and was third behind Fox
and Montgomery of the Olympic
Club. If he can come back to this
mark Saturday he will press both
Thompson and Merritt of U.S.C, Ed
Stamm, missing from the P.A. meet,
will give the Trojan trio lots of
trouble in the shot put, and may
emerge the victor.

Thelmo Knowles of San Jose State.
At the present it is undecided who
will run the mile and the 880 for
Stanford this Saturday.
Don Reiss, after having trouble
clearing the barriers in the 120 high
hurdles, came back to take a second
in 24.7 in the 220 low hurdles, behind
Trojan Les Browning. Reiss was the
PA. official winner, because U.S.C.
athletes were invited to compete,
and their points did not count in the
tabulation.
NEILSEN IMPROVES
Right behind Reiss, and beating
out the old Olympic Club veteran
was Glenn Nielsen in fourth place.
Nielsen has been improving with
great strides, and each week he
comes through with a surprisingly
well-run race. He is capable of 24.4
in the lows, the time he ran for a
third in the Big Meet.
Two ineligible Stanford runners
competed, and turned in very good
times, considering that it was their
first taste of competition this year.
Bills finished third, a yard behind
Cripe in the mile, his time being
4:27.9. Wayne Girdner took fifth in
the 880, turning in the good time of
1:57.7.
Hank Norberg was unable to qual
ify for the finals in the Big Meet, but
flipped out the discus 141 feet 2
inches, and was third behind Fox
and Montgomery of the Olympic
Club. If he can come back to this
mark Saturday he will press both
Thompson and Merritt of U.S.C, Ed
Stamm, missing from the P.A. meet,
will give the Trojan trio lots of
trouble in the shot put, and may
emerge the victor.
With some top-notch performances I
turned in at the Pacific Association's j
track carnival at Berkeley last Sat- j
urday, the cindermen of Coach Pitch
Johnson are eyeing the U.S.C. tussle
this week-end at Los Angeles.
One of the big surprises in the
meet was when Wyland Cripe ran a
good second to Bobby Madrid, the
Fresno State dynamo, in the unoffi
cial time of 4:27.2. This was but six
seconds behind the mark set up by
Madrid.
COM Pi ON SUBSTITUTES
Bob Compton left his favorite
race, the mile run, to substitute for
Cripe in the 880, and came in fifth,
the time being 1:57.2. This l'ace was
won by Johnny Fulton of the frosh,
whose terrific sprint in the last two
hundred yards was too much for
Thelmo Knowles of San Jose State.
At the present it is undecided who
will run the mile and the 880 for
