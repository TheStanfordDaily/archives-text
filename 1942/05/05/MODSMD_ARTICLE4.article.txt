# Defense Students Like Farm Food, Traditions

(Editor's Note: This is the second of two articles describing the
School of Civilian Defense, functioning on the Stanford campus under
War Department direction.)

The two middle-aged men, wearing the same kind of gray tweeds
that your Dad wears to work, sat on their suitcases waiting for the Paly
bus.

Two of 68 men who completed 111
days on Wednesday, April 29, they li
quoia, studying in Jordan Hall,
walking on the Quad, watching
wartime Stanford at work.
I asked them if they thought that
the Farm was doing the right sort of
job in preparing college men and
women, if the school had been sym
pathetic toward their efforts to learn
defense protection in time.
15 YEARS A STEELMAN
One was an industrial expert —
hometown a "military secret"—who
was quiet. He had never been to
college but for some 15 years had
been working in the nation's steel
mills. The way he answered my
question didn't sound similar to the
ordinary, brush-oIT answer to a
chamber of commerce query.
"You were nice to us here. We
had a job to do and not much time
to do it in. Ten days isn't long to
get ready for civilian war protec
tion, but Stanford made our spare
hours really pleasant ones."
The other man had more to say.
He was from northern Washington,
and he was looking forward to the
classes which he would teach cover
ing the same material he gathered
here.
STANFORD'S TRADITION
"I have seen a lot of campuses,
and have studied at some of them.
I don't think I've ever been on a
campus where tradition meant more
to students and more to a school."
They described Sunday morning
visits to the Memorial Chapel, bowl
ing matches with Sequoia teams, and
the food—they liked it, almost
unanimously.
I had intended to get some hu
morous slants, but. almost inevitably
we talked of the war. These men had
learned some new angles to modern
war — incendiaries, gas mask meth
ods, fire prevention, army organiza
tion, etc.—but they were looking
ahead, too.
IN PEACE TIME
The Washingtonian spoke of the
times after the war. "We are going
to need sociologists and economists
as much as first-aiders then—much
more so." I laughed and told him
that the army wasn't so interested
in that now. "O.K. That's no reason
that you kids on the campus should
n't keep plenty interested in it, and
get ready for it," he replied.
I found out that there are four
ways to answer difficult army prob
lems, especially to civilians. Pass it
off as secret information which can
not be revealed, say that it is in army
formula, say that time is too press
ing to go into it now or, as a last
resort, state that you don't know.
SOME LEAVE IN PACKARDS
The other 60 of the departing
trainees kept departing from the
driveway where we sat. Everything
from model Ts to a new Packard
carried these fellows back to their
home communities. Army officers
were cleaning out the files, ready for
the new students who will arrive
next Sunday.
The plan is to continue the train
ing here and elsewhere until an
efficient personnel is trained.
Finally the bus came around the
corner and the industrial expert and
Washingtonian took a last look at
the Hoover Tower and started to get
on.
The last one turned and said, "You
can tell them this. Stanford is sort
of a monument to the kind of col
lege that I wish that I could have
gone to. It's a sort of a monument
to the future, too."

visits to the Memorial Chapel, bowl

I had intended to get some hu

we talked of the war. These men had
learned some new angles to modern

ahead, too.
IN PEACE TIME
The Washingtonian spoke of the
times after the war. "We are going
to need sociologists and economists
as much as first-aiders then—much
more so." I laughed and told him
that the army wasn't so interested
in that now. "O.K. That's no reason
that you kids on the campus should
n't keep plenty interested in it, and
get ready for it," he replied.
I found out that there are four
ways to answer difficult army prob
lems, especially to civilians. Pass it
off as secret information which can
not be revealed, say that it is in army
formula, say that time is too press
ing to go into it now or, as a last
resort, state that you don't know.
SOME LEAVE IN PACKARDS
The other 60 of the departing
trainees kept departing from the
driveway where we sat. Everything
from model Ts to a new Packard
carried these fellows back to their
home communities. Army officers
were cleaning out the files, ready for
the new students who will arrive
next Sunday.
The plan is to continue the train
ing here and elsewhere until an
efficient personnel is trained.
Finally the bus came around the
corner and the industrial expert and
Washingtonian took a last look at
the Hoover Tower and started to get

I asked them if they thought that

pathetic toward their efforts to learn
defense protection in time.
15 YEARS A STEELMAN
One was an industrial expert —
hometown a "military secret"—who
was quiet. He had never been to
college but for some 15 years had
been working in the nation's steel
mills. The way he answered my
question didn't sound similar to the
ordinary, brush-oIT answer to a
chamber of commerce query.
"You were nice to us here. We
had a job to do and not much time
to do it in. Ten days isn't long to
get ready for civilian war protec
tion, but Stanford made our spare
hours really pleasant ones."
The other man had more to say.
He was from northern Washington,
and he was looking forward to the

here.

corner and the industrial expert and
Washingtonian took a last look at
the Hoover Tower and started to get
on.
The last one turned and said, "You
can tell them this. Stanford is sort
of a monument to the kind of col
lege that I wish that I could have
gone to. It's a sort of a monument
to the future, too."

(Editor's Note: This is the second of two articles describing the
School of Civilian Defense, functioning on the Stanford campus under
War Department direction.)

The two middle-aged men, wearing the same kind of gray tweeds
that your Dad wears to work, sat on their suitcases waiting for the Paly
bus.

Two of 68 men who completed 111
days on Wednesday, April 29, they li
quoia, studying in Jordan Hall,
walking on the Quad, watching
wartime Stanford at work.
I asked them if they thought that
the Farm was doing the right sort of
job in preparing college men and
women, if the school had been sym
pathetic toward their efforts to learn
defense protection in time.
15 YEARS A STEELMAN
One was an industrial expert —
hometown a "military secret"—who
was quiet. He had never been to
college but for some 15 years had
been working in the nation's steel
mills. The way he answered my
question didn't sound similar to the
ordinary, brush-oIT answer to a
chamber of commerce query.
"You were nice to us here. We
had a job to do and not much time
to do it in. Ten days isn't long to
get ready for civilian war protec
tion, but Stanford made our spare
hours really pleasant ones."
The other man had more to say.
He was from northern Washington,
and he was looking forward to the
classes which he would teach cover
ing the same material he gathered
here.
STANFORD'S TRADITION
"I have seen a lot of campuses,
and have studied at some of them.
I don't think I've ever been on a
campus where tradition meant more
to students and more to a school."
They described Sunday morning
visits to the Memorial Chapel, bowl
ing matches with Sequoia teams, and
the food—they liked it, almost
unanimously.
I had intended to get some hu
morous slants, but. almost inevitably
we talked of the war. These men had
learned some new angles to modern
war — incendiaries, gas mask meth
ods, fire prevention, army organiza
tion, etc.—but they were looking
ahead, too.
IN PEACE TIME
The Washingtonian spoke of the
times after the war. "We are going
to need sociologists and economists
as much as first-aiders then—much
more so." I laughed and told him
that the army wasn't so interested
in that now. "O.K. That's no reason
that you kids on the campus should
n't keep plenty interested in it, and
get ready for it," he replied.
I found out that there are four
ways to answer difficult army prob
lems, especially to civilians. Pass it
off as secret information which can
not be revealed, say that it is in army
formula, say that time is too press
ing to go into it now or, as a last
resort, state that you don't know.
SOME LEAVE IN PACKARDS
The other 60 of the departing
trainees kept departing from the
driveway where we sat. Everything
from model Ts to a new Packard
carried these fellows back to their
home communities. Army officers
were cleaning out the files, ready for
the new students who will arrive
next Sunday.
The plan is to continue the train
ing here and elsewhere until an
efficient personnel is trained.
Finally the bus came around the
corner and the industrial expert and
Washingtonian took a last look at
the Hoover Tower and started to get
on.
The last one turned and said, "You
can tell them this. Stanford is sort
of a monument to the kind of col
lege that I wish that I could have
gone to. It's a sort of a monument
to the future, too."
