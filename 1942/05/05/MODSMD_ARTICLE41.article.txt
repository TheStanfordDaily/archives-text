## 
### 
With the playing of the last league
game, Coach Harry Wolter's base
ball team will rest until a week from
Saturday, when they begin a series
of games with the various service
teams in the state.
In these games Wolter will prob
ably use only the men who will be
back next year, experimenting with
various combinations. The infield
will, however, be intact, save the
second base position, vacated by
Harry Parsons and Captain Botch
Caruso. Ray Hammett, first base;
Ted Nell, third base; and Leland
Scott, shortstop, will all be back for
the 1943 season.
In the last California game, Dick
Middleton went in to replace Caruso
who pulled up at first base with an
injured ankle after singling to right
field. Caruso had replaced Parsons,
and Middleton did a good job in the
emergency. He walked in his two
trips to the plate, and handled sev
eral fielding chances cleanly, look
ing especially good covering an error
by the right-fielder.
Ward Walkup will be back to catch
another season.
Records show that drivers who
have to stop to think usually are too
slow to think to stop.
