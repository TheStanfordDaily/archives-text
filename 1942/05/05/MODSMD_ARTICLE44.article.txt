THE Stanford student today can view with
some satisfaction the intricate and apparently
functional local defense organization. A laby
rinth of high-sounding committees has ap
peared within the last month. These groups
urge each student to buy defense stamps, to
entertain service men, to knit, to conserve gaso
line and tires, and to "co-operate with the na
tional defense effort."
This is all great. Under the leadership of
Bob Collins, a sincere and enthusiastic young
man, the objects of these committees are com
ing to fulfillment. Stamp sales are booming,
service men are in a mad social whirl, the "Y"
periodically runs out of yarn, Wednesdays are
car-less—in other words the mechanics of Stan
ford's defense effort are well-ordered and ef
ficient.
Organization theoretically comes about to di
rect efficiently the aims and energies of a group
of people which has some end in mind. Often
at Stanford the situation is reversed. The aims
and energies of students are directed toward
some end by the setting up of an organization.
A few student leaders view a certain end favor
ably and feel that their fellows should work
toward it. Result, an organization, a committee.
To an undetermined degree, this was the
case at Stanford, as elsewhere, with regard to
national defense.
Now, the committees are functioning, doing
their part and more, for in many guarters their
existence has brought home to students the
significance and necessity of layman's warfare.
This is true in many, but not all, guarters.
At this stage of the game no one doubts the
value of all-out civilian warfare, both in letter
and spirit. So, the committee will continue,
rightly so.
But before they become any more intricate
(and if the local defense situation seems com
plicate, reflect, oh citizen, on defense adminis
tration in the nation's capital), let each student
pause to ponder the significance of the stamp
Sylvia Berry "sold" him, of the days he goes
without his car, of the entertainment his living
group puts on for service men, of the clicking
knitting needles he so freguently hears. Let
him relate, as directly as possible, these local
activities to events in Burma, in Madagascar,
Moscow, and London. Without the perspective,
the local committees will eventually seem as
significant as the Eeta Beta Pie Dance clean-up
committee.
When pointing a moral in America, it is the
custom to toss out what we lovingly call an
"old saw."

activities to events in Burma, in Madagascar,

the local committees will eventually seem as

Old saw for today: "Don't miss the forest on
account of the trees."—Rosemarie Mullany
THE Stanford student today can view with
some satisfaction the intricate and apparently
functional local defense organization. A laby
rinth of high-sounding committees has ap
peared within the last month. These groups
urge each student to buy defense stamps, to
entertain service men, to knit, to conserve gaso
line and tires, and to "co-operate with the na
tional defense effort."
This is all great. Under the leadership of
Bob Collins, a sincere and enthusiastic young
man, the objects of these committees are com
ing to fulfillment. Stamp sales are booming,
service men are in a mad social whirl, the "Y"
periodically runs out of yarn, Wednesdays are
car-less—in other words the mechanics of Stan
ford's defense effort are well-ordered and ef
ficient.
Organization theoretically comes about to di
rect efficiently the aims and energies of a group
of people which has some end in mind. Often
at Stanford the situation is reversed. The aims
and energies of students are directed toward
some end by the setting up of an organization.
A few student leaders view a certain end favor
ably and feel that their fellows should work
toward it. Result, an organization, a committee.
To an undetermined degree, this was the
case at Stanford, as elsewhere, with regard to
national defense.
Now, the committees are functioning, doing
their part and more, for in many guarters their
existence has brought home to students the
significance and necessity of layman's warfare.
This is true in many, but not all, guarters.
At this stage of the game no one doubts the
value of all-out civilian warfare, both in letter
and spirit. So, the committee will continue,
rightly so.
But before they become any more intricate
(and if the local defense situation seems com
plicate, reflect, oh citizen, on defense adminis
tration in the nation's capital), let each student
pause to ponder the significance of the stamp
Sylvia Berry "sold" him, of the days he goes
