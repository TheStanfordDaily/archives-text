# Volunteer for Victory
## 
### 
IN this war it has become the duty of all able
bodied college men to do one of two things.
First, if they are engaged in some work, study
or research vital to the war effort it behooves
them to remain in college and contribute all
they can through these media. Second, if they
are not immediately engaged in work of this
type and are not members of the R.0.T.C., it
is their choice either to leave college and vol
unteer for some branch of the service, or to
enlist in some officer training program which
guarantees deferment.
There are also college men who prefer to
continue in college training until the time they
are called by the draft, and to serve their coun
try accordingly.
There has been much publicity and pressure
exerted upon university men to join the Army
Air Corps, the Navy Air Corps, the Navy V-7,
the V-l, the AV-S, and the many other service
branches open to them.
Perhaps it would be well, for college men
as yet indefinite about their service futures, to
consider their obligation to the country and
the advantages of the service deferment plans.
Officer material abounds in the nation's col
leges, for in these institutions men are trained
in mathematics, physics, navigation, technigues
of warfare, leadership and in mature thinking.
Since the families of these men have invested
in their future and in the future of the country
by sending them to college, it seems only rea
sonable the men should take advantage of
their advanced training and apply it in the
manner most beneficial to America.
One of the most practical means of doing this
is to volunteer for one of the Army, Navy, or
Marine programs which offer officer candidate
training and deferment until graduation.
