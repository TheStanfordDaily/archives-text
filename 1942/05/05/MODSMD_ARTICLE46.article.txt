### AMIE REICHERT 
YESTERDAY the United Nations got the jump on the
Axis and seized the strategic island of Madagascar
off the coast of South Africa. British forces made the
landing.
The events of the last ten days have lead steadily
to this development, and it was no surprise. Ever
since Laval took over the Vichyfrench government
senators and columnists and just plain people in Brit
ain and in the United States have been demanding that
the United Nations take swift, decisive action to pre
vent the loss of this vital base.
You will remember that last week the Union of
South Africa broke of! relations with the new French
government. At that time speculation was rife about
the chances for an Allied attack on the island.
The chances looked pretty good. The Japanese
naval force which had bedn threatening the British in
the Bay of Bengal had apparently broken up and the
speculation was that some of the ships had returned
to home waters after the Tokyo bombing scare.
Churchill announced last week that a pretty strong
unit of the British navy was in those waters.
The British moved first and with comparative ease.
Whether they will be able to hold Madagascar, or
even become firmly established on the island, without
a fight, is another question.
There were rumors last week that the French fleet
was moving toward Madagascar but this was not con
firmed. However, over the week-end the Japanese
and French naval representatives met and conferred.
* * ♦ *
possession of Madagascar is especially vital to
the winning of this war since the war has become
a battle of supply lines and since it seems fairly cer
tain that the Middle East is going to be the decisive
theater of activity. Madagascar sits astride the precious
Allied supply lines which feed the Middle East. The
routes it guards run from the British Isles around
South Africa and past the island itself to the Red Sea
and the Persian Gulf, and from the West Coast of the
United States around Australia and across the Indian
Ocean to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
In Axis hands Madagascar would be a perfect base
for a roving Japanese air force and navy to run hog
wild over the entire sea area, to dominate the Indian
ocean as well, and isolate India from British and U.S.
aid.
The Japanese are at the moment fighting on a 10.000
mile supply line. It would be extremely dangerous
for them to attempt to wrest Madagascar from the Brit
ish, but it is also dangerous for them to allow the island
to remain in Allied hands. Whether they consider it
worth the chance, we shall see, probably, within the
very near future.

South Africa broke of! relations with the new French
government. At that time speculation was rife about
the chances for an Allied attack on the island.
The chances looked pretty good. The Japanese
naval force which had bedn threatening the British in
the Bay of Bengal had apparently broken up and the
speculation was that some of the ships had returned
to home waters after the Tokyo bombing scare.
Churchill announced last week that a pretty strong
unit of the British navy was in those waters.
The British moved first and with comparative ease.
Whether they will be able to hold Madagascar, or
even become firmly established on the island, without
a fight, is another question.
There were rumors last week that the French fleet
was moving toward Madagascar but this was not con
firmed. However, over the week-end the Japanese
and French naval representatives met and conferred.

possession of Madagascar is especially vital to
the winning of this war since the war has become
a battle of supply lines and since it seems fairly cer
tain that the Middle East is going to be the decisive
theater of activity. Madagascar sits astride the precious
Allied supply lines which feed the Middle East. The
routes it guards run from the British Isles around
South Africa and past the island itself to the Red Sea
and the Persian Gulf, and from the West Coast of the
United States around Australia and across the Indian
Ocean to the Red Sea and the Persian Gulf.
In Axis hands Madagascar would be a perfect base
for a roving Japanese air force and navy to run hog
wild over the entire sea area, to dominate the Indian
ocean as well, and isolate India from British and U.S.
aid.
The Japanese are at the moment fighting on a 10.000
mile supply line. It would be extremely dangerous
for them to attempt to wrest Madagascar from the Brit
ish, but it is also dangerous for them to allow the island
to remain in Allied hands. Whether they consider it
worth the chance, we shall see, probably, within the
very near future.
YESTERDAY the United Nations got the jump on the
Axis and seized the strategic island of Madagascar
off the coast of South Africa. British forces made the
landing.
The events of the last ten days have lead steadily
to this development, and it was no surprise. Ever
since Laval took over the Vichyfrench government
senators and columnists and just plain people in Brit
ain and in the United States have been demanding that
the United Nations take swift, decisive action to pre
vent the loss of this vital base.
You will remember that last week the Union of
South Africa broke of! relations with the new French
government. At that time speculation was rife about
the chances for an Allied attack on the island.
