### MIKE CHURCHILL 
REFLECTING BITTERLY
l^ T OW THAT we are half way through spring quar
ter, now that the traditional weather has stabilized
itself, it is opportune to look baek and consider what
accomplishments one has netted.
It is open to question whether this column has ac
complished anything or not, but the writer cannot
help but feel that in a personal sense, if not in a
journalistic one, he has at least gained recognition.
The first recognition came from the "Three Female
Fritters" who, in brief, accused me of being frus
trated.
This is not exactly the recognition I thought I de
served, but I stuck to it.
Then came Cristobel Pankhurst, via Campus Opin
ion, with an uncomplimentary letter, saying in the
main that if I had nothing better to talk about than
Stanford women, I should give up.
Sylvia Berry next berated me in print for a criti
cism of the Stamp Day prograirl, which I never in
tended. Desirous of making amends, I got a date
with Sylvia, and am happy to report that what was
once an unfortunate misunderstanding has blossomed
into a beautiful friendship. Sylvia and I are now like
that.
Then came a letter from far off Norfolk. At last I
thought I had the recognition I wanted. It was Kmeto
vic, Robesky, Bickenbach, and Rose, on B-B Eyes.
Yesterday I got what will probably be my highest
tribute. Buzz Sherwood, a Theta who graduated
last year, phoned me long distance and asked me to
insert a want ad in the paper for her. She took the
wrong blue coat from the Dclt dance.
♦ ♦ ♦ ♦
TUST a few minutes ago the telephone rang, and
some wanted to know the area of Sunday's black
out.
Ever on the alert, The Daily refused to give out.
military information without knowing where it. was
going. It turned out to be Women's Council who were
just checking some girl who gave the blackout as her
alibi for being late back to school.
* * * *
CAN'T accuse us of being extravagant. The
blackout occurred just half an hour before the
paper's deadline, and the business manager, who had
been temporarily driven out because of the women's
edition, frantically phoned to say that under no
circumstances short of an invasion should The Daily
go past its deadline (time and a half overtime for the
backshop after that).
And, he added, in the event of invasion don't bother
to print at all, for it won't be needed. There may be
news and bombs all over the peninsula to the editorial
staff, but to the business staff it's deadlines and dollars
and cents.
