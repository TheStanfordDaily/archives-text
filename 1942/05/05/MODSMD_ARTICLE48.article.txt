r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
Congratulations to the Junior Prom Committee for
signing such a wonderful band. Finally we've broken
that stupid tradition of having sweet and smooth music
at the Junior Prom. Just imagine—this band has a
quintet that "broke all attendance records for five
straight weeks at the San Francisco Hot Music So
ciety last year"! And we're having it right here on
our own little campus! That is something to tell our
grandchildren about! We juniors were just praying
that we could get cither Ernie Lewis or Lu Watters'
Jazz Band, and now our dreams have come true.
Let's put an end to that other outmoded tradition
of formal dress for the Prom, too. My date and I plan
to wear jeans and old shirts so we can really get in
the groove. If we all co-operate we can make Stan
ford the jitterbug center of the nation!
Overwhelmed. '43
P.S.: Stanford was certainly lucky not to get Harry
James or Glen Miller for its Prom, like U.C.L.A. and
U.S.C. did.

They seek it here,
They seek it there.
The Campos seek it everywhere.
It is in Heaven?
Is it in Hell?
That damned elusive Campo bell.
