### 

ARTHUR KALMAR, research scientist, demonstrates a new machine
at Riverside, Calif., which hermetically "seals" fresh fruits and vege
tables for shipment to America's armed forces abroad. A natural wax
solution is sprayed over these oranges from the circular vent at left.
Compressed air is forced through lower vents, spreading waxy solu
tion over entire surface of the fruit.
