# '43 to 'Shuffle' In Dixie Setting
## Ernie Lewis to Play At Show Boat Prom 
### 
With the smooth, lilting melodies
of Ernie Lewis in a setting of an old
time river palace plying the Missis
sippi, the campus will dance at the
Junior Prom's Show Boat Shuffle
Saturday night in the pavilion.
Lewis, the new find of the Bay
Area musical world, has made sev
eral new arrangements of the latest
popular sweet ballads for his com
ing Stanford engagement. These
will be ably backed up by such
pieces as "I'm Confessing" and
"Stardust," which have won the
plaudits of San Francisco and Oak
land fans.
SAXOPHONE SECTION
Critics have gone overboard in
acclaiming the Lewis saxophone
section, which boasts of Curtis Lowe
on alto sax and Stompy Jones on
tenor.
Vera Keys has just recently joined
the band, and her vocal rendition
of old favorites and new ballads is
exceptionally well done.
During the intermissions the band
will put on a show that will feature
swing, gut-bucket, and improvisa
tions on various themes. The band
is essentially sweet, but the "Kat
zcnjammers" is a quintet within the
band that specializes in jam-session
entertainment. This combination
consists of piano, drums, guitar, sax,
and bass. Be sure to request their
rendition of "One O'clock Jump" if
you want to start your toes to tap
ping.

tenor.
Vera Keys has just recently joined
the band, and her vocal rendition
of old favorites and new ballads is
exceptionally well done.
During the intermissions the band
will put on a show that will feature
swing, gut-bucket, and improvisa
tions on various themes. The band
is essentially sweet, but the "Kat
zcnjammers" is a quintet within the
band that specializes in jam-session
entertainment. This combination
consists of piano, drums, guitar, sax,
and bass. Be sure to request their
rendition of "One O'clock Jump" if
you want to start your toes to tap
ping.

With the smooth, lilting melodies
of Ernie Lewis in a setting of an old
time river palace plying the Missis

eral new arrangements of the latest
popular sweet ballads for his com

will be ably backed up by such
pieces as "I'm Confessing" and
"Stardust," which have won the
plaudits of San Francisco and Oak
land fans.
