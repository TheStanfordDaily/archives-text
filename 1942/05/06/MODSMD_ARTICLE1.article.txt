# Farm Stars To Go East Despite War
## Dee and Schroeder May Pay Own Way To Intercollegiates 
### H.D. THOREAU 
Several of Stanford's top athletes
will go East this spring, despite the
Board of Athletic Control's move
Monday night canceling the sched
uled trips for the tennis, track, and
golf teams, according to the athletes
themselves.
"Ted (Schroeder) says he'll go if
I go, and I think I'll go because I
think Ted can win the singles and
he and I together can win the
doubles. So by hook or crook we'll
get there," stated Larry Dee, ace
Indian netter, referring to the In
tercollegiate tennis championships
at New Orleans in the latter part
of June.
Indications are that campaigns will
be started soon to raise funds with
which to send the teams back. Grad
uate Manager A1 Masters declared
that "Any campaign at Stanford to
raise funds would be okay, it seems
to me, if it's properly handled."
B.A.C. WANTED TO
"The board desired to send the
teams back, but felt we just couldn't
do it in the face of the present cir
cumstances," Masters went on to
say.
Although Track Coach Pitch John
son stated, when approached on the
subject, that "Officially ... it (the
trip to the N.C.A.A. championhhip
meet at Lincoln, Neb., in June) is
entirely ofT," there is still hope of
sending several members of the
team East. In the past few years
those men who have placed high in
the Pacific Coast Conference meet
have been sent, with all expenses
paid, to the Big Ten-P.C.C. dual
meet. This meet is going to be held
in Chicago, only 500 miles from
Lincoln.
This, however, does not assure that
the track men will be able to go
East, since there would be additional
expenses incurred, and the P.C.C. has
not yet heard definitely from the
Big Ten as to whether the meet
will be held.
TWIGGS' OPINION
In regard to the B.A.C.'s action,
Eddie Twiggs, golf coach, said, "I
think the kids are really entitled to
the trip, because they are not only
the defending champions, but have
made a marvelous record in compe
tition this year as well." Previously
plans had been made to send six
men to the N.C.A.A. tournament to
be held during the last week of June
at South Bend, Ind.
Tennis Coach Johnny Lamb ex
pressed the hope that some way
could be found to send a four-man
team to the tennis tourney in New
Orleans. A series of exhibition
matches has been suggested to raise
money.
