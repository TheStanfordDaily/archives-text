# All-U Assembly To Hear Kreps, Wilbur Speak
## Position of Students In War to Be Topic Of Talk Tomorrow 
### 
When Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur last addressed an all-University
assembly it was immediately after
tho. declaration of war. Tomorrow
he will again speak to students and
faculty at a meeting the War Activ
ities Board believes to be equally
important.
Dr. Wilbur will speak on the stu
dent's place, as an American citizen,
in the war situation. His talk will
provide the background for the
other speakers, whom he will intro
duce in his capacity as chairman of
the meeting.
War-time economy and the stu
dent's function in conservation by
consumers will be the topic of Dr.
Theodore Kreps, professor of busi
ness economics. Four student speak
ers, Pat Adams, Ralph Shafferzick,
Irving Hellman, and George Jackson,
will cover other phases of campus
participation in the war effort.
"Classes will be dismissed and the
libraries and Cellar will be closed
between 9 and 10 a.m. tomorrow so
that everyone will be free to hear
these talks," Dr. Edgar Eugene Rob
inson, head of the Committee on
Public Exercises, has announced.
