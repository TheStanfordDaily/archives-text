# Stanford Goes Carless Today
## 
### 
Today is the second Wednesday
that Farm students will leave their
cars at home and walk to classes in
co-operation with earless Wednes
day, weekly occurrence on campus.
The Stanford War Activities Board
hopes to sec parking lots as empty
as they were on Stanford's first
earless Wednesday last week. Rea
sons for having earless Wednesday
are to save ga.s and rubber, reduce
wear and tear of cars, and to increase
sociability.
Students arc asked to remember
Dr. Theodore Kreps' speech:
"Too many students operate on
the theory that if they aren't going
to have their cars eventually any
way they might as well use them
like mad until they are complete
wrecks. That is the action of a fol
lower of Hitler, for lie is destroying
part of the capital of the United
Sta tcs."
