### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP).—A
stirring new chapter in the story of
American fighting men a chapter
this time of men armed chiefly with
courage and devotion to duty—was
unfolded tonight as the War Depart
ment cited units of the U.S.-Philip
pine forces on Luzon for their "mag
nificent defense of the island against
overwhelming odds."
The citations, issued in the name
of President. Roosevelt, were based
on operational reports from the
Philippines, and on recommendations
submitted by Gen. Douglas Mac-
Arthur. They were made public in
a special War Department commu
nique.
No individuals were singled out for
special citation. Instead, the praise
was bestowed on entire units—their
enlisted men and officers and nurses
and chaplains whose heroism will
live in history.
