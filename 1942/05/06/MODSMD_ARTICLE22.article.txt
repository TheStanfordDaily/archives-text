# Enemy Expands Drive To Take Island Fortress

### 
WASHINGTON, May 5 (UP). —Japanese landing par
tics are storming Corregidor fortress in a supreme bid
to capture the rock-hewn citadel which hars them
from Manila Bay, the War Department revealed late
today.
Lieut, (ien. Jonathan M. Wain wight, who succeeded
(ien. Douglas Mac Arthur in command of the valiant

► American-Filipino legions in the
Philippines, reported the enemy be
gan moving against Corregidor at
midnight and that a "landing attack
was in progress."
Military observers here interpret
ed this to mean that the Japanese
had crossed from the mainland at
night in barges or other small boats
and that fighting was in progress orv
Corregidor or its beaches when
Wainwright reported.
BEACHES PRESENT PROBLEMS
Experts said that under proper
conditions, a landing could be ef
fected on the northern or "tail end"
of the tadpole-shaped island. The
southern end presents a formidable
rock barrier to landing by water, but

there are beaches along the northern
end.
It was presumed the Japs came
from the Bataan peninsula side of
Manila Bay which is scarcely two
miles distant.
Experts agreed, however, that the
attempt will cost the Japanese
heavily in manpower.
CONCENTRATE ALL FURY
The Japanese concentrated all
their fury on Corregidor after Ba
taan fell April 9. Against the rugged
fortress and sister bastions they
turned loose wave after wave of
high level and dive bombers and
tremendous bursts of heavy artillery
fire.
Corregidor underwent its worst
pounding of the war only yesterday
—13 separate air attacks and a five
hour bombardment from nine-inch
shore guns. The War Department, in
reporting that assault, failed to
mention whether Corregidor's guns
had replied.
How many fighting men and civil
ians arc within Corregidor's walls is
a military secret. It is known that
most of the estimated 3,000 Marines
and Bluejackets on Bataan reached
the fortress safely just before Ba
taan fell. An unrevealed number of
soldiers, nurses and civilians also
reached the fortress which already
housed its regular garrison and
civilian refugees from Manila.
