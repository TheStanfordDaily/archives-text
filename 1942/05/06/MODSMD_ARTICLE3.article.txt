# JACKSON REPORTS ON MEET
## 
### 
"One of my main observations is
the validity of our own campus war
program. It's well planned," said
Student Body President George
Jackson, who, with President-elect
Ed Stiimin, flew hack to Sun Valley
last week to attend a three-day Con
vention of the Pacific States Presi
dent's Association and returned to
campus yesterday.
The keynote of the convention's
four main forum discussions was the
responsibilities of student govern
ment in the university at war. There
were also the usual discussions of
general student government prob
lems
LIMITED ACTIVITIES
"Activities should be limited to
those which are vital to keeping
morale up in the social and athletic
fields," was the convention's verdict.
A three-point program was out
lined for the regulation of social
activities: first, to fit the school's
and students' needs; second, to keep
students on the campus; third, to
avoid planning too wide a program.
Despite the general cutting down on
large-scale social activities professed
by most schools, some told of on
gaging big-name bands for dances,
grossing sometimes as much as
$1500, $500 or $600 being contributed
to the Red Cross.
CONTACT SPORTS
"Athletics," the convention decid
ed, "should be made compulsory for
every undergraduate." Body contact
sports were especially recommended,
courses to those students who wish
The group heartily endorsed intra

mural sports and local area inter
collegiate and service team games.
Stanford's Stamp Day program
was among a number of War Activi
ties outlined to convention delegates.
A number of colleges hold dances,
with 25-cent War Stamps as tickets.
The Cal representatives told of the
Bears' schcmc of posting the number
of Axis pilots shot down each day
in the Daily Cal, asking students to
contribute one cent for each pilot
shot down to a War Fund collection.
CAL ONE BETTER
Although Stanford offers defense
to take them, the University of

California goes the Farm one better,
according to Stanford's delegates, re
quiring each student to take one unit
in a Home Defense Class each semes
ter.
The Farm delegates, meeting with
the presidents of other Pacific
Coast schools, planned get-togeth
ers for later in the year, at which
student body leaders of U.S.C.,
U.C.L.A., Cal, and Stanford might
meet informally to discuss problems
affecting them collectively.
In all, it was, according to Ed
Stamm, "a very successful confer
ence."
