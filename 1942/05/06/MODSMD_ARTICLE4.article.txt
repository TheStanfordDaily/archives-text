# All Campus Groups Urged To Enter Water Carnival
## 
### 
The placid waters of Lake Lagunita will be the scene of the renewal of
the Junior Water Carnival this Saturday afternoon, when all campus or
ganizations will engage in marine events.
Entry lists have been distributed to all groups by Co-chairmen Leslie
Langnecker and Tom Ohliger. Prizes will be awarded to winners of the

various events, and the group having
the highest aggregate point score
will win a sweepstakes trophy.
Sweepstake awards will be given to
both men and women groups. The
floats count most in the point score,
so the committee urged all organiza
tions to have at least a float entered.
EVENTS LISTED
The list of events are: floats, canoe
jousting, log rolling (men), canoe
filling (women), men's canoe race
(two man teams), women's sack race,
men's swimming race, women's canoe
race (team of two), five-man canoe
race, egg and spoon race (women),
and women's swimming race.
The last feature on the program
is the new "Aquapollo" contest. All
men's groups will submit their best
specimens of masculine brawn—on
the hoof. The Barbara Quartet —
Gastel, Bassett, Slaughter, and Sad
ler—have been imported to judge the
Stanford man most worthy of the
distinguished title.
FLOATS LABELED
All floats must be labeled so that
when they pass the reviewing stand
the judges can tell to what organi
zation they belong.
No carnival was held last year due
to the Fiftieth Year Aquacade, cele
brating fifty years on the lake.
The all-campus Water Carnival
is part of the Junior Week-end.
After the Carnival will be the
Junior Prom, with the music of
Ernie Lewis. Tickets for the Prom,
selling at $2.20, arc on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices.

sions, Clarke Van Fleet; events,

The placid waters of Lake Lagunita will be the scene of the renewal of
the Junior Water Carnival this Saturday afternoon, when all campus or
ganizations will engage in marine events.
Entry lists have been distributed to all groups by Co-chairmen Leslie
Langnecker and Tom Ohliger. Prizes will be awarded to winners of the

various events, and the group having
the highest aggregate point score
will win a sweepstakes trophy.
Sweepstake awards will be given to
both men and women groups. The
floats count most in the point score,
so the committee urged all organiza
tions to have at least a float entered.
EVENTS LISTED
The list of events are: floats, canoe
jousting, log rolling (men), canoe
filling (women), men's canoe race
(two man teams), women's sack race,
men's swimming race, women's canoe
race (team of two), five-man canoe
race, egg and spoon race (women),
and women's swimming race.
The last feature on the program
is the new "Aquapollo" contest. All
men's groups will submit their best
specimens of masculine brawn—on
the hoof. The Barbara Quartet —
Gastel, Bassett, Slaughter, and Sad
ler—have been imported to judge the
Stanford man most worthy of the
distinguished title.
FLOATS LABELED
All floats must be labeled so that
when they pass the reviewing stand
the judges can tell to what organi
zation they belong.
No carnival was held last year due
to the Fiftieth Year Aquacade, cele
brating fifty years on the lake.
The all-campus Water Carnival
is part of the Junior Week-end.
After the Carnival will be the
Junior Prom, with the music of
Ernie Lewis. Tickets for the Prom,
selling at $2.20, arc on sale at the
A.S.S.U. offices.
Heading committees are: conces
sions, Clarke Van Fleet; events,
Dave Doud and Sheldon Parker;
floats, Zip Walt and Connie Law
yer; programs, Lucille Terrell; en
tertainment, Joan Hill and Doc Col
yer; master of ceremonies, Bob Rock
