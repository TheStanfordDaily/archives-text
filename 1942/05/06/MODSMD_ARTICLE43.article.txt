### H.D. THOREAU 
it happened again. The
Daily softball ten took the field
again yesterday afternoon and one
hour and three minutes later had !
literally wiped another strong team
out of the intramural race.
It wasn't that the EI Capitan
team was weak. They had a very
powerful outfit, but were simply
outclassed by the gentlemen from
the fourth estate. DUe to several
mishaps, the final outcome of the
game was in the fire until the last
minute when Hap Everett's long
infield out knocked across the win
ning run.
From now on watch for the Daily
boys. They practice for several
hours every afternoon in the Shack,
using coke bottles in place of the
regulation pelota and really handle
themselves like ball players.

( I OOKIE LAVAGETTO, former
A Oakland and Brooklyn third
sacker, will show his talents to a
Stanford audience this afternoon in
a Mare Island Naval Base uniform
against the varsity nine.
Starting on the mound for the
visiting sailors will be Quentin Q.
"Cootie" Thompson, former In
dian fireballer. Cootie graduated
from here last June and has since
played for the Hollywood Twin
kle's.
He holds the world's record for
having lost more baseball games to
Mike Koll of California than any
other man alive, but despite this
dubious distinction, he was one of
the best chuckers seen in a Cardinal
uniform since" the halcyon days
when Ernie Nevers used to devise
football plays while pitching a
shutout.

IN A POLL taken to determine the
outstanding Stanford undergrad
uate athlete of the year, who would
receive top mention?
Frankie Albert? Don Burness?
Jim Pollard? Ed Stamm? Ted
Schroeder? Emmett Cashin? Bud
Brownell? Ray Hammett? All of
these men would poll plenty of
votes, along with many others, but
who would win?
Think it over.

army officers timing (he
100-yard dash in an intracamp
(rack meet in Texas all came up with
a 9.2-second clocking for Kjell
Qvale's century.
Showing the novice's usual
temerity, they agreed that they
must have had a slight error so
they called it 9.4, which equals
the world's record.
When the news of this was son I
cut across the country, even with
the conservative timing given, no
one believed that this Norwegian
lad could run so fast, "The track
must have been short; there must
have been a big gale blowing;
maybe he ran downhill"â€”so said
the populace.
However, this lad who had been
elected captain of the 1942 Wash
ington track team until he went
into the Air Corps, was one of the
| coast's best dashmen last year, and
maybe he's learned enough about air
, currents since he's been in training
1 to get that much extra speed.
