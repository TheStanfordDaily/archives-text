# Card Runners Hopes High
## 
### 
The early-season supposition that
the Southern California Trojans
would walk over the Stanford track
team without giving the latter a
first place has been blown up by the
recent improvement of several Card
stars.
Ed Hertel in the high hurdles and
Ed Stamm in the shot-put nf)w l'ate
as favorites in those events, while
Vern Hart. Farm high-jumper, A!
Pande, javelin thrower, Ed Tomaso
and Russ Peck, pole vaulters, and
Gene Kern, captain and broad
jumper, are all given good chances
of winning.
Although Hertel has not been in
top shape for three weeks because
of muscle injury, his early season
mark of 14.5 in the 120 highs is bet
ter than anything John Beiwener,
S.C. hurdler, has done this year.
