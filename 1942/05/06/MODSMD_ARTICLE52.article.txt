IT is not The Daily's function to stick its nose
into the business of Men's and Women's
Councils, charged with administering the Honor
Code. But since the Councils are this week busy
with a revitalization of the Code and with poll
ing the students to determine its effectiveness,
we feel the need to elucidate upon the sugges
tion in this morning's Campus Opinion by a
Stanford professor, which we feel may be a
simple, direct solution to the Honor Code prob
lem.
He writes:
"Cure implies such faith in the Code that
students will be willing to . . . penalize brazen
offenders by personal censure and open ostra
cism—the deadliest of weapons, one against
which there is absolutely no defense."
And here, in a nutshell, lies the possible so
lution. It has been the historic practice for
Men s and Women's Councils to seek publicity
concerning Honor Code violations, through The
Daily, in the hope of discouraging students from
abandoning principles of the Code. It has been
the opinion that notice of penalties imposed
would be sufficient warning.
But it has never been the custom for either
Men s or Women s Council to release the names
of students convicted and penalized for an in
fraction of the Code. This was probably done
in the interest of good taste,'' and the custom
could probably be defended on such a basis.
What we suggest is that from here on the
Councils release to The Daily the names of stu
dents found guilty on Honor Code charges, to
gether with punitive action taken in each in
stance. This will be a tough blow to some of
our "respected citizens," but it seems a sure
way to discourage sub rosa flirtation with Stan
ford's Honor Code.
If a student knows full well he will be pub
licly exposed as a cheat through the columns
of his campus newspaper, in the event he is
convicted of a violation, he will think and think
soberly before he leaves himself wide open to
ostracism.
We sincerely believe the person who cheats
on an examination, and this is probably the most
flagrant type of violation of the Code, has no
place at Stanford. The Honor Code is not only
a tradition and a privilege of which to be proud,
but it is another of those many characteristics
which gives the Stanford degree the dignity
it has always carried.
In the event Men's and Women's Councils
adopt the above suggestion, The Daily stands
ready to co-operate in the administration of the
plan.

could probably be defended on such a basis.
What we suggest is that from here on the
Councils release to The Daily the names of stu
dents found guilty on Honor Code charges, to
gether with punitive action taken in each in
stance. This will be a tough blow to some of
our "respected citizens," but it seems a sure
way to discourage sub rosa flirtation with Stan
ford's Honor Code.
If a student knows full well he will be pub
licly exposed as a cheat through the columns
of his campus newspaper, in the event he is
convicted of a violation, he will think and think
soberly before he leaves himself wide open to
ostracism.
We sincerely believe the person who cheats
on an examination, and this is probably the most
flagrant type of violation of the Code, has no
place at Stanford. The Honor Code is not only
a tradition and a privilege of which to be proud,
but it is another of those many characteristics
which gives the Stanford degree the dignity
it has always carried.
In the event Men's and Women's Councils
adopt the above suggestion, The Daily stands
ready to co-operate in the administration of the
plan.
IT is not The Daily's function to stick its nose
into the business of Men's and Women's
Councils, charged with administering the Honor
Code. But since the Councils are this week busy
with a revitalization of the Code and with poll
ing the students to determine its effectiveness,
we feel the need to elucidate upon the sugges
tion in this morning's Campus Opinion by a
Stanford professor, which we feel may be a
simple, direct solution to the Honor Code prob
lem.
He writes:
"Cure implies such faith in the Code that
students will be willing to . . . penalize brazen
offenders by personal censure and open ostra
cism—the deadliest of weapons, one against
which there is absolutely no defense."
And here, in a nutshell, lies the possible so
lution. It has been the historic practice for
Men s and Women's Councils to seek publicity
concerning Honor Code violations, through The
Daily, in the hope of discouraging students from
abandoning principles of the Code. It has been
the opinion that notice of penalties imposed
would be sufficient warning.
But it has never been the custom for either
Men s or Women s Council to release the names
of students convicted and penalized for an in
fraction of the Code. This was probably done
in the interest of good taste,'' and the custom
could probably be defended on such a basis.
