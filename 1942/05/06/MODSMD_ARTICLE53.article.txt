CONGRATULATIONS to the new 12:10 Club,
Stanford's reorganized Luncheon Club, on
its initial meeting today noon!
The organization, open to all, will hear class
A-l speakers on vital subjects for the rest of
the current quarter and on through Summer
Quarter.
Certainly their excellent program deserves
hearty support from students, faculty and local
residents.
No water bags were thrown from the Theta
Chi house at "casualties" stretched out on the
lawn the night of Stanford's recent blackout
disaster rehearsal, according to information
from Charles Sciaroni, Theta Chi president.
He adds there are 15 Theta Chi's serving as
campus civilian defense personnel.
