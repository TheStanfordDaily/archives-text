### AMIE REICHERT 
JpOR WEEKS the Japanese have rained death upon
the stout island fortress of Corregidor. It now
looks as though they are closing in for the kill.
No one seriously thought that we could hold onto
the fortress once Bataan fell. It was only a matter of
time. Militarily, Corregidor was written off as a loss
on April 9 when Wainwright's men were forced to
surrender.
The situation there has been, for many weeks, a
desperate, a hopeless one. We have been fighting on a
great many fronts at once ever since Pearl Harbor.
We have had relatively little to send to a great many
places. Consequently we have had to put first things
first—we have had to send our men and our guns and
tanks and planes to the areas which are most vital to
the waging and winning of this war.
Unfortunately for the many brave men who died
and will die there, Corregidor was not first. Just as
the Philippines were lost when most of Luzon was
lost, so was Corregidor lost when Bataan fell, though
it has fought on and bravely.
The value of the long and valiant resistance of the
men of Bataan was primarily that they were deploying
a great many of the enemy and a great many of his
planes and munitions from action on the other fronts
of the Pacific battle area. With Corregidor it is not
quite the same
The loss of this fortress means a great deal more
than the releasing of a substantial portion of the Japa
nese striking power for business in India, Burma,
Australia—wherever they may turn. It means the loss
of a naval base in Manila Bay which will shorten the
Japanese supply line, now stretched to a dangerous
tautness.

base is not enough for what the Japanese have
in mind, however, and that at least is a comfort.
The plans they have been brewing in the past few
years with their German friends call for Axis control
of Madagascar—that is the base they really want and
need.
As the Japanese web spins itself outward and round
about ever increasing in its circumference, the threads
become thinner and thinner. They have several val
uable stop-gaps, to be sure. There is Singapore and
now Manila Bay. But the Japs want to go farther
afield.
They will have lo have Madagascar. Eventually
they will have to seize this island if they expect to
complete their conquest of the Pacific, to dominate
those seaways, and ultimately join hands with the
Germans somewhere in the Middle East.
It may be that they will attempt to wrest Mada
gascar from the British soon—before they get too
firmly entrenched there. It may be that first they will
try to seize the little island of Ceylon off the southern
tip of India to use it as a base for operations, another
link in the chain they are forging across the Pacific.
The success of the Japanese armies in Burma and
in China seems an auspicious prelude to an attack on
India and Ceylon. Madagascar may prove to be the
keystone to this entire area.
