# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
JJY ELEVEN o'clock yesterday morning the Cellar
was without cokes. This was not, of course, the
Cellar's fault, and they were as dismayed as the
patrons.
According to Bob Collins, more confusion arises
from the students' bewilderment as to a substitute
than anything else. So long have we been conditioned
by habit and advertising to ask for a coke when
thirsty, that to many there is just no alternative.
Bob Collins is now heading a group which is car
rying on research to try and discover a new drink
sensation that will replace coke in the Cellar.
When I was asked for suggestions I made what I
thought were the obvious ones, but they were quickly
vetoed.
The students have been assured that there is still
as much coffee as ever. There was fear for a while
that this office might become another secret weapon,
but the Allied Nations intend, for the present at least,
to abide by The Hague Convention, which outlaws all
psychologically deteriorating methods along with poi
son gas and dum-dum bullets.
There is a movement afoot to brighten up the
Cellar. Spring dresses and summer blouses have done
much in this direction, but further steps may be
taken to liven up the walls with pictures, murals,
pennants, or the like.
Those nice iron gates, which give a prison-like ap
pearance, will probably <go into discard. If it is pos
sible, they will be replaced by trophy cases, where
some of the now inaccessible emblems of Stanford
victories will be housed.

PECULIAR situation has arisen in Student Govern
ment circles. It has been the practice in the past
for the vice-president and president to share an office.
The announcement last Saturday of Pat Adams' en
gagement complicates this formerly simple arrange
ment. It is expected that the matter will be straight
ened out in a joint meeting of Excom, men's and wom
en's councils, and the Board of Athletic Control.

The students have been assured that there is still
as much coffee as ever. There was fear for a while
that this office might become another secret weapon,

There is a movement afoot to brighten up the
Cellar. Spring dresses and summer blouses have done

Bob Collins is now heading a group which is car
rying on research to try and discover a new drink
sensation that will replace coke in the Cellar.
