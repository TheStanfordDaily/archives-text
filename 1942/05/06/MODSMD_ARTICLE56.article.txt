EDITOR. SIR:
If Stanford students could realize what it would
mean to forfeit the privileges they enjoy under the
Honor Code, they would fight for it like wild Indians,
instead of offering merely passive resistance to its vio
lators. When I came to Stanford, after many years of
teaching under the police system called proctoring, it
was like stepping from an underground prison into
fresh air; to be re-condemned would be the greatest
grief I as a teacher could experience.
I cannot understand why students will allow foul
play in the classroom which they would not tolerate
for one moment on the athletic field; why they will
protect a thief of the mind who is far more repre
hensible and dangerous lhan a robber of their pockets.
Remedies for the situation, which is admittedly
worsening, lie in the students' hands; they fall into
two categories, prevention and cure.
Prevention means educating all new students in the
understanding and appreciation of the Honor Code;
this education should take place in the living groups,
and it should enlist the best brains in the student
! body.
Cure implies such faith in the Code that students
| will be willing to (a) report observed violations to the
' proper authorities and (b) penalize brazen offenders by
| personal censure and open ostracismâ€”the deadliest of
| yeapons, one against which there is absolutely no de
fense.
If our students permit the Honor Code to be sabo
i taged, they will have dealt Stanford the worst blow it
J has ever received. B. Q. Morgan j
