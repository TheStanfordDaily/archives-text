# Orchestra's Performance Rated High
## 
### 
That Ferenc Molnar has developed
the Stanford Orchestra into a com
petent symphonic organization be
came apparent last night at the
Tuesday evening concert, when com
positions of three romanticists re
ceived renderings that the compos
ers themselves vex - y probably would
have appreciated.
Except when the trombone forgot
that the Rosamunde Overture was
not a gridiron pep march, the or
chestra achieved excellent ensemble
and rich texture, with much credit
due the woodwinds, the first flute in
particular.
Even the technical ramifications in
the Saltarello of the Mendelssohn
symphony received a performance of
no inconsiderable skill and vitality.
The French horn was in rare form;
although the sparse orchestral back
ground of the Chopin concerto was
often too soft, it was with few im
perfections.
Eda Bodanzky-Reik, at the piano,
rendered Chopin with spirit and ex
pression, as Chopin should be ren
dered. It was not difficult to under
stand why Mr. Molnar commented,
"It is easy to conduct when she is
nlavinp." â€”Clnvov
