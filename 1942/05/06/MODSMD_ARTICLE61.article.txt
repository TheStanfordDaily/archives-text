# Sweet, Hot Tunes Pep Spring Show
## 
### 
Music for this year's Spring Show,
"A Sale of Two Cities," is "pretty
good" at this point, but will be
"much better," according to Marion
Scott, musical director.
"We've got two good hot tunes,"
he said. These are "Look Out for
Love," sung by Dori Redmon and
Bob Breckner, and "Hottest Goddess
in Town," sung by Marcy Baum.
Both sweet songs are sung by the j

Redmon-Breckner team. "Love, I
Need You" is by Scott and Jim
Cooper, and "First Day of Spring" is
by Scott and Bob O'Neill.
Both big chorus numbers are
"shaping up well," Scott said. Open
ing number is "We're the Tourists
of the U.S.A.'' and "Hoorah for
Biddle." "A Sale of Two Cities" will
take the stage of Memorial Hall May
15 and 16 at 8:15 p.m.
