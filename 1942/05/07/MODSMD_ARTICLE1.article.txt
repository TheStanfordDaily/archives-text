Doors to Memorial Hall will be
opened at 8:55, and the band will
play until the program begins. All
classes are to be dismissed and the
libraries and the Cellar will be
closed from 9 to 10 so that everyone
will be free to attend.
''The University has made all these
arrangements because we feel that
every student and faculty member
should hear the speeches. The Little
Theater will be open for the over
flow, and loudspeakers are being set
up out in front so that all may hear,"
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson of the
Public Exercises Committee de
clared yesterday.
BACKGROUND OF WAR
Dr. Wilbur will open the assem
bly with a talk giving the general
background of the war situation and
showing the student's place in it as
an American citizen. As chairman
of the meeting, he will introduce the
other speakers and summarize their
remarks at the conclusion.
Explaining specifically what stu
dents can do as consumers in aiding
the war effort will be Dr. Kreps,
professor of business economics.
Students who heard his talk last
week on war-time economy sug
gested that he speak to the entire
student body.
Four student speakers will give a
general picture of war activities on
the campus. Pat Adams is to discuss
war-time changes in campus social
life, while Ralph Shafferzick will
explain the civilian defense organi
zation on the Farm.
JACKSON TO SPEAK
Student projects, new courses, and
the outlook for athletics will be
covered by George Jackson, A.S.S.U.
president. Irving Hellman is to be
the concluding speaker with an ex
planation of the general war organi
zation on campus.
Sponsored by the War Activities
Council, the assembly is intended to
bring the students closer to the war,
to give them a concrete idea of what
they can do to win"the war while at
Stanford.
"It is indeed an unusual oppor
tunity when the students can hear
Chancellor Wilbur discuss the war,
for he only rarely addresses the en
tire student body," the sponsoring
committee stated in urging everyone
to attend. "And the other speakers
have equally important messages to
present."
