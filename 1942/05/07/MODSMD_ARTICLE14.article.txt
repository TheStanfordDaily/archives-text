# 'Lady Vanishes' To Play Sunday
## 
### 
"The Lady Vanishes," Alfred
Hitchcock's great English mystery
movie, will play on the Sadler Series
Sunday at 7:15 in Memorial Hall.
It is the picture which preceded
Hitchcock's two American triumphs,
"Rebecca" and "Suspicion." As in
those pictures, and others like
"Night Train" which made Hitch
cock famous, "The Lady Vanishes"
employs the elements of fine drama
and fine melodrama as they are sel
dom equalled on the screen.
The plot of the story resembles the
classic story by Alexander Woollcott,
in which a girl visiting Paris during
the bubonic plague returns to her
hotel to find her mother unaccount
ably missing and the room com
pletely changed. The girl in the
movie is Margaret Lockwood, and
instead of the plague an interna
tional intrigue is substituted.
Also on the program will be a car
toon, news, and chapter eight of
"Buck Rogers." Admission is 20
cents.
