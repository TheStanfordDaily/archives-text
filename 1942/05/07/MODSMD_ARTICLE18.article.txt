# Foe Not Licked, Says Newhall

### 
"Don't think the Axis is licked,"
exclaimed Scott Newhall, young
editor of This World, at the first
meeting of the new 12:10 club in
the Nitery yesterday noon. "Most of
the stories of German internal dis
sent and collapse come directly from
Berlin!"
Speaking before a capacity crowd,
Editor Newhall declared that due to
allied loss of face in the Far East in
this war, the British and Americans
will never achieve the position in
Asia which they had before Decem
ber 7. "There will be no more Brit
ish Hong Kong nor International set
tlement in Shanghai as there was
before," he continued.
He said further that except in the
Philippines the native populations
have been fighting on the side of
the Japanese. "The courageous
stand of the Americans on Bataan
Peninsula was of little strategic but
great political value," Newhall went
on, "because of the 'saving of face'
by reason of stopping the Japanese
there."
Mr. Newhall declared that we
must make an all-out effort in fight
ing this war, because the Axis is
still outproducing us in many war
materials. By next year we will be
producing more than Germany and
Japan, and that will win the war.
Our principal job now is going for
ward with a full force production
effort so wc can start a real offensive
which will knock out the Axis. He
concluded with a warning that we
must be sure of what we are fight
ing for and not make a peace like
the last one.
