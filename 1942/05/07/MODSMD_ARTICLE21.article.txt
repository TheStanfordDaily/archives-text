# British Attack Key Naval Base From the Rear
## 
### United Press 
Britain put its new form of light
ning war to the first major test
Wednesday in a combined air, land,
and sea bombardment of France's
Diego Suarez naval base on Mada
gascar and the results, despite stub
• born French resistance, were en
couraging to the United Nations
cause.
With a force estimated at 25,000
regulars, parachutists and comman
dos in the field, covered by carrier
! borne planes and supplied by a fleet
of 23 fighting and transport ships,
j the newest BEF drove 20 miles
! across the narrow northern tip of
| the great Indian Ocean island, fought
its way into Diego Suarez streets
and threatened momentarily, after a
two-day campaign, to seize the naval
base from the rear.
ADMIT LOSSES
The French acknowledged the loss
of four warships, a submarine and a
mine-laying sloop sunk when they
attacked British transports, and two
cruisers "missing," which might
either have fled or gone over to the
British. Fighting raged in the streets
of Diego Suarez.
The naval base is Madagascar's big
prize. Allied warships operating
from there are expected eventually
to battle the Japanese for control of
the Indian Ocean.
French dispatches insisted that
Madagascar's defenders were bat
tling for all their worth, and that
they have shot down three British
planes, destroyed seven tanks and
taken some prisoners.
GERMANS WORRIED
Germany, however, apparently
was not convinced of Vichy's sin
cerity, and Madrid dispatches re
ported that Hitler was demanding
some convincing proof that the Brit
ish would not be able to duplicate
their Madagascar invasion in French
West Africa.
Madrid said Pierre Laval was try
ing to pacify Germany by promising
more "volunteers" for the Russian
front and more workers for German
factories, and that Admiral Jean
Darlan had ordered the French Med
iterranean fleet on the alert.
On the French home front, tur
moil continued. The Germans shot
40 more hostages yesterday.
RAF POUNDING
The RAF continued its offensive
with the second successive night at
tack on Stuttgart, a South German
factory town which produces tanks
and planes for Hitler's armies. Ger
man defenses in France and the Low
Countries were pounded again
Tuesday night and in four sweeps
in daylight Wednesday.
Russia's government newspaper
Izvestia declared that the eastern
front war had entered a new phase,
"that of final liberation of occupied
Soviet territory," and that the war
would be won in 1942, partly because
of an increasing flow of American
and British war supplies.

two-day campaign, to seize the naval
base from the rear.
ADMIT LOSSES
The French acknowledged the loss
of four warships, a submarine and a
mine-laying sloop sunk when they
attacked British transports, and two
cruisers "missing," which might
either have fled or gone over to the
British. Fighting raged in the streets
of Diego Suarez.
The naval base is Madagascar's big
prize. Allied warships operating
from there are expected eventually
to battle the Japanese for control of
the Indian Ocean.
French dispatches insisted that
Madagascar's defenders were bat
tling for all their worth, and that
they have shot down three British
planes, destroyed seven tanks and
taken some prisoners.
GERMANS WORRIED
Germany, however, apparently
was not convinced of Vichy's sin
cerity, and Madrid dispatches re
ported that Hitler was demanding
some convincing proof that the Brit
ish would not be able to duplicate
their Madagascar invasion in French
West Africa.
Madrid said Pierre Laval was try
ing to pacify Germany by promising
more "volunteers" for the Russian
front and more workers for German
factories, and that Admiral Jean
Darlan had ordered the French Med
iterranean fleet on the alert.
On the French home front, tur
moil continued. The Germans shot
40 more hostages yesterday.
RAF POUNDING
The RAF continued its offensive
with the second successive night at
tack on Stuttgart, a South German
factory town which produces tanks
and planes for Hitler's armies. Ger
man defenses in France and the Low
Countries were pounded again
Tuesday night and in four sweeps
in daylight Wednesday.
Russia's government newspaper
Izvestia declared that the eastern
front war had entered a new phase,
"that of final liberation of occupied
Soviet territory," and that the war
would be won in 1942, partly because
of an increasing flow of American
and British war supplies.
Britain put its new form of light
ning war to the first major test
Wednesday in a combined air, land,
and sea bombardment of France's
Diego Suarez naval base on Mada
gascar and the results, despite stub
• born French resistance, were en
couraging to the United Nations
cause.
With a force estimated at 25,000

dos in the field, covered by carrier
