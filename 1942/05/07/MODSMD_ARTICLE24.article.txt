# New Religion Class Planned
## 
### 
"There is no justification for play
ing on the beach this summer," Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood, Stanford chap
lain, said yesterday. "Students
should either return to school or
work to support themselves," he
added.
Courses in religion will be offered
as they have been in past quarters,
with the addition of a course, Re
ligion 1, which Mr. Tanner will
teach. The text for this course is a
new book by Dr. Trueblood, "The
Logic of Belief." There will also be
a seminar, Religious Education, for
secondary school teachers.
Dr. Trueblood will be at Stanford
during most of the summer quarter,
at which he will give a series of lec
tures, now under preparation, called
"Spiritual Religion in a Time of
Crisis." He will publish the series at
the end of summer quarter.
It is hoped, Dr. Trueblood said,
that it will be possible to have sev
eral vesper services in the Frost
Amphitheater. Because of uncer
tain weather it is impossible to have
them outdoors during the winter
months.
Dr. Trueblood plans to travel
through the East in autumn quarter
delivering lectures at Dartmouth,
Chicago, and other universities.
