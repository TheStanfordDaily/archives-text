# Economic Destruction of Axis After War Will Ruin Victors
## Fischer Emphasizes Reparations Danger 
### LOUIS FISCHER 
(Editor's Note: This is the third
of a series of articles on the next
j peace from the hook, "Dawn of
: Victory," hy Louis Fischer.)

The economic destruction of Ger
many, Italy, ami Japan would de
stroy the destroyers, too. The ruin
of such big countries or even the re
tarding of their recovery would he
a disaster to the victors. The expe
rience of England and France after
191!) showed that it was not possible
to collect reparations from Germany
without first making Germany pros
perous.
Later, the world realized that Ger
man reparations payments were an
embarrassment to those who re
ceived the money. It was America
which really paid reparations for
Germany. The large sums involved
in reparations or in the war debts
could simply not have been trans
ferred without upsetting interna
tional finance. That is why almost
all good British economists are now
saying, No reparations. In other
words, the retribution after this war
cannot be economic. Therefore dis
armament would be unreal, for the
moment the victors stopped polic
ing, the defeated countries could re
build the industrial facilities for re
armament.
MAP-CARVING NO HELP
Nor is there a guarantee of peace
in geographic adjustments. European
security will not be achieved by
snatching a piece of territory from
one country and patching it onto an
other. Versailles did that in 1919.
Shortly after the second world war
started, Leslie Hore-Belisha, then
British Secretary of State for War,
said very aptly, "This is not a war
about a map." Some shifting of
boundaries will probably be un
avoidable. Mere map-carving, how
ever, cannot create the new Europe.
Nor will the vivisection of Germany
do it . . .
Europe is such a jumble of races,
and the economic systems of its nu
merous countries are so interlaced
and interdependent, that it would
seem to be the ideal place for a
peace which lays far less emphasis
on the things that divide and much
more on the necessity of union.
There are few perfect racial fron
tiers on the European continent, and
every national frontier separates iron
from coal, or factories from markets,
or agricultural regions from their
customers, or land-locked areas from
the sea. In addition every frontier
is a tariff barrier. . . .
ATLANTIC CHARTER
When the united anti-Axis nations
win this war they will have to re
ject Hitler's method in Yugoslavia.
Hitler compensated the victors and
exterminated the vanquished. The
Atlantic Charter promises something
else. Implicit in the Charter is a
peace which improves on Versailles
because it deals not only with ter
ritorial changes and financial trib
ute but with social and economic
questions. The peace of 1919 includ
ed errors of commission. Its chief
fault, however, lay in its sins of
omission; it failed to eliminate social
injustice, economic friction, and in
ternational disunity.
The doctrines already promulgat
ed by Churchill and Roosevelt and
adopted by the anti-Axis coalition
are a pledge that the next peace
will be better than the last. Ger
many, Italy, and Japan have visited
untold suffering upon mankind. Yet
they may have to be given a better
peace than they deserve simply be
cause the peace they deserve might
ruin the victorious peace-makers. We
all live tightly together on a little
island called the earth, and infections
spread quickly from one continent,
to another. If we punish the defeated
we punish ourselves.

Coal supplies the essential ingre
dients for many of the plastics used
today in aircraft construction.
