# POLL RESULTS TO CAUSE HONOR CODE CHANGES
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Results of the Honor Code poll taken at Stanford Monday night were
conclusive enough to insure some definite changes in the administration
of the Code, Helen Kimhall and Bob Morton, chairmen of the Councils,
said last night after the 1,274 questionnaires returned had been tabulated.
These changes will be officially considered within the week by the
Councils acting in a joint meeting. The chairmen said that revisions will
probably be made in the current method of reporting Honor Code viola
tions and that the Councils will enunciate a definite policy on expelling
students for violations.
Complete tabulations of the 1,274 questionnaires returned follow:
1. Do you think the Honor Code is working successfully?
Yes 796
No 123
Indefinite .155
2. Have you noticed any violations of it in the last three quarters?
Yes 801
No 471
Indefinite 2
The second part of Question 2 asked, if an affirmative answer was given
to the first part, how many violations had been noticed. The second part
of the question was not completely tabulated, but partial results revealed
that an overwhelming number had seen more than one violation.
The Chairmen declared, in commenting on this question, that the Coun
cils had dealt with less than two dozen cases in the last three quarters.
3. What steps would you take if you observed a violations?
Would simply speak to violator 470
Would report cither to Council or professor. .. . 26!)
Indefinite 78
This question was tabulated on the basis of what ultimate action the
student would take. The 470 who are listed as indicating that they would
speak to the violator implied or specifically said that this would be the
limit of their action. Of the 269 who are listed as indicating that they
would report a violation cither to Council or the professor, many said that
their first step would be to speak to the violator. If this step did not pro
duce results, the 269 indicated their ultimate action would be an official
report.
The 457 students who said they would take no action at all suggested
the following question to Chairman Kimball: "How many of these students
are the same ones who said they
thought the Honor Code is working
successfully? The Code cannot work
successfully, even allowing for the
hopeless 1 per cent, if the student
does not undertake some responsi
bility for preventing or punishing
violations."
4. Do you consider cheating in
short quizzes as serious as cheating
in mid-quarters or finals?
Yes 1,081
No 165
Indefinite 28
5. Do you think that all violators
should be punished by expulsion?
No JI9B
Yes 23?)
Indefinite 17
The point brought out on many
of the questionnaires was that there
would be considerably less willing
ness on the part of students to turn
in someone if the penalty of ex
pulsion were to come in all cases,
regardless of circumstances. Both
Chairmen Kimball and Morton were
impressed by the conclusive answer
to this question.
G. Do you know of any specific
courses or class situations where
Honor Code violations are prevalent?
The answers to this question were
not, on the whole, conclusive, ac
cording to the chairmen. A tabula
tion revealed that chemistry, biol
ogy, lab courses in general, lan
guages (Spanish topped the list)
military science courses, English
and economics were the fields which
were mentioned most frequently.
7. Do you consider walking out of
the Cellar without paying your check
an Honor Code violation?
Yes 814
No 421

Results of the Honor Code poll taken at Stanford Monday night were
conclusive enough to insure some definite changes in the administration
of the Code, Helen Kimhall and Bob Morton, chairmen of the Councils,
said last night after the 1,274 questionnaires returned had been tabulated.
These changes will be officially considered within the week by the
Councils acting in a joint meeting. The chairmen said that revisions will
probably be made in the current method of reporting Honor Code viola
tions and that the Councils will enunciate a definite policy on expelling
students for violations.

The second part of Question 2 asked, if an affirmative answer was given
to the first part, how many violations had been noticed. The second part
of the question was not completely tabulated, but partial results revealed
that an overwhelming number had seen more than one violation.
The Chairmen declared, in commenting on this question, that the Coun

This question was tabulated on the basis of what ultimate action the
student would take. The 470 who are listed as indicating that they would
speak to the violator implied or specifically said that this would be the
limit of their action. Of the 269 who are listed as indicating that they
would report a violation cither to Council or the professor, many said that
their first step would be to speak to the violator. If this step did not pro

The 457 students who said they would take no action at all suggested
the following question to Chairman Kimball: "How many of these students
are the same ones who said they

successfully, even allowing for the
