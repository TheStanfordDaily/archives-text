# POLL RESULTS TO CAUSE HONOR CODE CHANGES
## 
### ROSEMARIE MULLANY 
Results of the Honor Code poll taken at Stanford Monday night were
conclusive enough to insure some definite changes in the administration
of the Code, Helen Kimhall and Bob Morton, chairmen of the Councils,
said last night after the 1,274 questionnaires returned had been tabulated.
These changes will be officially considered within the week by the
Councils acting in a joint meeting. The chairmen said that revisions will
probably be made in the current method of reporting Honor Code viola
tions and that the Councils will enunciate a definite policy on expelling
students for violations.
Complete tabulations of the 1,274 questionnaires returned follow:
1. Do you think the Honor Code is working successfully?
Yes 796
No 123

2. Have you noticed any violations of it in the last three quarters?
Yes 801

This question was tabulated on the basis of what ultimate action the
student would take. The 470 who are listed as indicating that they would
speak to the violator implied or specifically said that this would be the
limit of their action. Of the 269 who are listed as indicating that they
would report a violation cither to Council or the professor, many said that
their first step would be to speak to the violator. If this step did not pro
duce results, the 269 indicated their ultimate action would be an official
report.
The 457 students who said they would take no action at all suggested
the following question to Chairman Kimball: "How many of these students
