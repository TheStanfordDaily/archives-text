### 
Today the mobile unit of the Red J
Cross Blood Donor Service will pay |
its first visit to Palo Alto, and when '
1 it leaves it will take with it blood j
donations from 14 Stanford students.
The first group of Stanford blood |
donors includes George Jackson, I
Bill Cowden, Frank Albert, Pat Ad
ams, Alastair Mac Donald, Mary Ann I
Walker, Jim Lawson, Mike Church- j
ill, Helen Kimball, Peggy Mayer, i
Barbara Sadler, Robert Murphy, and i
Rosemary Goodwin, the campus Red j
I Cross Committee announced.
At the Palo Alto Community Cen- !
ter, a pint of blood will be taken
from each donor. The blood will be j
taken to the laboratories, and cen- j
trifuged to separate the plasma.
Dried and powdered, the plasma is !
available for instant transfusions for !
the wounded.
Stanford's Red Cross Motor Corps !
unit will provide transportation for j
the blood donors, and refreshments 1
will be served them afterward. The
j whole operation, according to the
; Red Cross, is painless, and there are
j no after-effects.
The mobile unit will return every
two weeks hereafter for at least
eighteen months. Students may reg
j ister as donors through their living
i groups or at the Student War Of
i fice, Room 13 in the Old Union.
