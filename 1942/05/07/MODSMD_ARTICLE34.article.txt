CPRING football always has been
k a haphazard proposition, since
most of the boys are just taking it
as an occasional conditioner, and
this year is no exception.
Augmented l>y the recent influx
of trackmen Jim Pettit and Al
Hoisch. and baseballcrs Kay Ham
mett and Bill Wilson, the squad
should be at full strength, but in
stead the hoys with the big names
come out when they feel up to it,
and (he rest of the time sit on
their posterieurs at home.
When the season opens next fall
there are going to be a lot of faces
strange to stadium crowds, who are
really going to play good ball, or
am I saying the obyious again.

/ 'OOTIE and Cookie didn't show
* with the Naval Reserve Air
Base of Oakland ball team yester
day, since the former is back at
Lakehurst now and the latter is evi
dently elsewhere also.
However, the boy who did show
was Harry "Doc" Mason, frosh
ohucker, who, while pitching for
the varsity yesterday against the
sailors, struck ont seven men in
lour innings, while walking only
two and letting out only two drib
bling singles.
In one inning he gave the "k" to
three men in a row. To make the
story really good he got a big bingle
in his only trip to the plate.

/ |N THE cover of the June issue
of the United tates Lawn Ten
nis Association Magazine appears a
group picture of the Stanford tennis
team all decked out in maroon
jackets.
This is an even more important
event than it seems, because F.
Wallis Merrihew, editor of the
mag, is one of those original east
erners who weren's aware until a
few years ago that anything other
than bison and Navajos lived on
(his side of the Alleghenies.

OVERLOOKED in yesterday's
possible list of Stanford's out
standing athletes for the 1941-42
school year was George Kaufman,
pitcher extraordinary for the Daily
softball ten.
In preparation for the Daily's
tilt with the Theta Delts, defend
ing champs, next week, George has
been eating raw meat at the Shack
while pounding out story after
story.

strange to stadium crowds, who are
really going to play good ball, or
am I saying the obyious again.

/ 'OOTIE and Cookie didn't show
* with the Naval Reserve Air
Base of Oakland ball team yester
day, since the former is back at
Lakehurst now and the latter is evi
dently elsewhere also.
However, the boy who did show
was Harry "Doc" Mason, frosh
ohucker, who, while pitching for
the varsity yesterday against the
sailors, struck ont seven men in
lour innings, while walking only
two and letting out only two drib
bling singles.
In one inning he gave the "k" to
three men in a row. To make the
story really good he got a big bingle
in his only trip to the plate.

/ |N THE cover of the June issue
of the United tates Lawn Ten
nis Association Magazine appears a
group picture of the Stanford tennis
team all decked out in maroon
jackets.
This is an even more important
event than it seems, because F.
Wallis Merrihew, editor of the
mag, is one of those original east
erners who weren's aware until a
few years ago that anything other
than bison and Navajos lived on
(his side of the Alleghenies.

OVERLOOKED in yesterday's
possible list of Stanford's out
standing athletes for the 1941-42
school year was George Kaufman,
pitcher extraordinary for the Daily
softball ten.
In preparation for the Daily's
tilt with the Theta Delts, defend
ing champs, next week, George has
been eating raw meat at the Shack
while pounding out story after
story.
CPRING football always has been
k a haphazard proposition, since
most of the boys are just taking it
as an occasional conditioner, and
this year is no exception.
Augmented l>y the recent influx
of trackmen Jim Pettit and Al
Hoisch. and baseballcrs Kay Ham
mett and Bill Wilson, the squad
should be at full strength, but in
stead the hoys with the big names
come out when they feel up to it,
and (he rest of the time sit on
their posterieurs at home.
When the season opens next fall
there are going to be a lot of faces
strange to stadium crowds, who are
really going to play good ball, or
am I saying the obyious again.
