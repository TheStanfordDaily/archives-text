HlGHLlGHTSâ€”Cleveland's hold
on the American League finally
tumbled yesterday when depend
able Ernie Bonham pitched his
third shutout in four starts as the
Yankees handed Lou Bodreau's
faltering Indians their fourth
straight defeat, 3-0. Cleveland is
now deadlocked with the Boston
Red Sox for second place.
New York's halting of the In
juns also stopped hurlcr Jim Bag
by's streak of five wins in a row.
Bonham handcuffed Cleveland
with live hits. Bagby gave up
seven blows in as many innings
until lifted for a pinch-hitter in
the eighth.
Bobby Docrr clouted two hom
ers to hoist the Red Sox into a
second-place tie as they trounced
the Chicago White Sox, 3-1, in 10
innings. Doerr's second four-bag
ger came in the tenth frame off Ted
Lyons.
Buck Ncwsom's one-hit mas
terpiece gave the Washington Sen
ators a brilliant 7-0 victory. Only
Roger Cramer's triple in the third
inning kept Ncwsorn from a hall
of fame no-hitter. It was his first
appearance against the Tigers
since he was sold to the Senators.
