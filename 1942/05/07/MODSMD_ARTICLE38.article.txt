# Runners Reach Top Strength
## 
### 
Stanford's track team is at top
strength this week for the first time
since the opening of the season, with
Ed Hertel, Ed Stamm, and John Sil
va back in the fold.
Although neither Hertel nor Silva
can possibly be in their best condi
tion after not working out for sev
eral weeks, Coach Pitch Johnson
assures that they will be able to
compete against the Mighty Trojans
in Los Angeles Saturday.
Stamm will have his hands full
with U.S.C.'s three 50-foot shot-put
ters, Carl Merritt, Ron Thomas, and
"Moose" Thompson.
The rapid improvement of Hank
Norberg places him as a definite
threat to Merritt and Thompson in
the discus.
The amount of points Stanford can
win the running events all depends
on how Johnson and Dean Crom
well, Trojan coach, run their men
in the 880, mile, and 2-mile. Cards
Wy Cripe and Bob Compton can run
well at any of the three distances
and may figure high in their fin
ishes, if Cromwell does not enter
his men in iron-man stints.
