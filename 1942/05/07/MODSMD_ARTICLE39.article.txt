# Mason Hurls Indian Nine To Victory
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Cootie Thompson was transferred
to Lakehurst, N.J., training base and
Cookie Lavagetto didn't put in an
appearance, hut the handful of fans
who braved spring fever to come out
saw a new pitching possibility fÂ«f
Stanford's varsity when Harry
"Doc" Mason struck out seven and
gave up but two hits to the 17 men
that faced him in the four innings
he threw.
The Redskins won, 6-5, over the
Naval Reserve Air Base of Oakland,
the deciding runs coming home off
the bat of second-sacker Harry
Parsons, who doubled and singled in
two trips for a perfect day at the
plate.
Freshman Bill Brokaw started on
the mound and did a creditable job
in the five innings he worked, al
lowing three hits, one of them a
triple by Al Steele, formerly of the
not-so-sassy San Francisco Seals.
SCOTT TRIPLES
Stanford picked up a run in the
second frame when Ed Washburn
walked, took second on an infield
out. third on an error, and scored
on a fielder's choice. Another run
came in the third when Ted Nell
doubled and came home on Lee
Scott's long fly that went for a
triple.
Two more Indian runs boomed in
when Frank Tibbett's bloody Texas
Leaguer drove in Harry Parsons,
who had doubled home Washburn.
Mason in the meantime wild-pitched
Steele home in the sixth, and the
Oakland boys scored their final
three tallies in the eighth inning on
two hits and some loose fielding with
the bases loaded.
PARSONS BIG MAN
Stanford hit the bell in the eighth
like this: Howie Dallmar, playing
first base in place of Ray Hammett,
singled, stole second, and went to
third when Ward Walkup was safe
on shortstop Lou Barclay's error.
Washburn was hit by Pitcher Brill
Heckenham, filling the bases.
Parsons was the golden boy then,
singling to center field to drive in
Dallmar. Tibbetts hit a slow roller
down the third-base line and Pat
Ambrose forced Dallmar at the
plate. Catcher Jimmy Gladden tried
for a double play at first but
smacked Tibbetts in the back with
his heave and Washburn scored.
