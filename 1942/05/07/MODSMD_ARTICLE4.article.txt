# Juniors' Show Boat Shuffle Promises Creole Atmosphere
## 
### 
According to the authoritative Stanford Junior Prom dance commit
tees, no person has been found who is allergic to the old Mississippi
Creole atmosphere of cotton bales and the smooth sepia music of Ernie
Lewis—no other dance committee can make that statement.
Tickets for the annual Prom arc now on sale at the A.S.S.U. offices

for $2.20.
Something new has been added in
that Vera Keys has been signed to
sing with the band at the Show Boat
Shuffle. Miss Keys sings in a style
that is reminiscent of the late Chick
Webb-Ella Fitzgerald "A-tisket a
tasket" days.
12-PIECE BAND
Modern design makes the big dif
ference these days, so Lewis has
streamlined his band to twelve
pieces. He has, however, retained
the original members of the Katzen
jammer Quintet which will give a
gutbucket concert during the inter
missions. Lewis, who spent his no
vitiate period at Jack's in San Fran
cisco, is an expert on barrel-house
rhythms, and will demonstrate his
technique in the intermissions.
In keeping with the Show Boat
theme, Lewis will play pieces from
Jerome Kern's great operetta, "Show
Boat," and will include such tunes
as "Can't Help Lovin' Dat Man o'
Mine," "Old Man River," "My Bill,"
"Make Believe," "Why Do I Love
You," "You Are Love," and "I Still
Suits Me."
SHOW BOAT SETTING
Allyn Scarborough, head of the
decorations committee, has planned
a setting complete in Show Boat
style. Two little pickaninnies will
be at the gangplank to welcome the
many guests of the junior class.
The prom is the culmination of a
week-end of activities sponsored by
the Class of '43. First is the Junior
Scrunch on Friday, Junior Water
Carnival on Saturday afternoon, the
Prom, and on Sunday evening the
Sadler Scries movie, "The Lady Van
ishes," starring Margaret Lock
wood.
"Homer, get your bid to the Junior
Prom instead — it's the best for
dancin'."
