## Alpha Delts Fold, 8-2, Before Theta Delt 4-Hit Hurling 
### 
Alpha Delta Phi did a nifty el foldo yesterday as Theta Delta Chi, de
fending champions, pounded Bob Breckner and his lads for an 8-2 victory
behind the four-hit hurling of Had Bacon. In the only other game played,
Legal Eagles bounced Delta (Jpsihm, 7-3. Five other softball tilts and one
regulation baseball game were unplayed via the forfeit route.

In upsetting the Alpha Delts,
Theta Delts parlayed eight hits into ,
nine runs by clutch hitting, heads !
up base running, and lots of the !
much - needed "hubba - hubba"
around the infield.
Warren Woods banged out two
singles in three times at bat, while |
Tom Boyle and Bill Holm doubled
for the winners.
Neither club made any errors,
while Bacon bested Breckner in the
mound duel, striking out six men in
all and once whiffing three in a row.
The last year's mural champs took
advantage of their opportunities and

picked up two runs in the second,
one in the third, fourth, and fifth,
and finished with a three-run burst
in the final frame.
Amazingly enough, the Daily ag- '
gregation is the only club that still
has a chance to cop the duke in 1
League 3. The dallying Dailymen
have won two, lost one in the mural |
gonfalon chase.
The Stanford scribes climbed into
the league picture Tuesday with a
heated 4-3 victory over El Capitan.
