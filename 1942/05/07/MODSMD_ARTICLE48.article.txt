WANT to go to a University assembly today?
Probably not. The only kind of assem
blies we ever have here are dogmatic talks by
professors, or the introduction of election can
didates—two of the duller types of assemblies.
But possibly you will want to go today. We're
not saying that by all means you should go, but
that if you do go you have a chance to better
understand why you had to get a rationing book
this week. And you'll get the answers to a
lot of other guestions that are mighty important
factors in your wartime life.
The assembly will be different — short
speeches by two professors and four student
leaders, together with a double-header band
concert before and after the talks.
Incidentally, don't bother to go to the Cellar,
because it's going to be closed. But that's okay,
so's the Libe.
