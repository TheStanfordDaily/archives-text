# Of Scrunches and Proms
## 
### 
TOMORROW and Saturday something differ
ent in entertainment will be offered for the
members of the Junior Class, for these two days
mark the long-awaited Junior Week-end. Besides
the annual Water Carnival, President Don Dil
lon and his committees have arranged for the
Scrunch and the Prom.

With such an action-packed two days right
here on the campus, the class has done an ex
cellent job in helping co-operate with the on
campus entertainment drive for the duration.
The Scrunch, which will be in the form of a
barbecue with movies and community singing,
shows that all of the ideas for ways of keeping
ourselves amused have not been exhausted.

It's getting to be an old story now, but a pretty
important one, that we can't go running up to
San Francisco every time we get the urge and
still win this war. If every campus organization
which has the responsibility of providing en
tertainment for certain dates in the future could
do the job which is being done by the Class
of 43, we would find ourselves having a lot
more fun—inexpensively.
Tuesday morning's Daily ran a Campus Opin
ion from a member of the class who objected
to the choice in bands for the Prom. It referred
to an editorial which last week mentioned the
fact that U.S.C. and U.C.L.A. had Glenn Miller
and Harry James for their big campus dances.
After careful consideration with Pat Adams,
who has charge of granting dates for campus
affairs, it was found that we couldn't possibly
have a big-name band here and still make
money because of our lack of facilities. Our
Pavilion is much smaller than the halls in the
southern universities, which can pack in two
or three times more couples than we can, and
still dance.
The point is that we could have these bands,
but we wouldn't be able to make money to give
to worthy causes.
With such a situation to cope with, the Prom
committee has auditioned most of the promi
nent inexpensive" bands in this area and found
that the band chosen, Ernie Lewis', is the best
available.—John Horrall
