# A 						False Claim
## 
### 
EARLIER this week the San Francisco Chron
icle reprinted an editorial from the Provi
dence Bulletin joshing several universities
about giving honorary degrees, the occasion
being an announcement that the University of
Wisconsin would confer a degree on General
Mac Arthur. Stanford was among those joshed
because the writer assumed that Stanford also
gives honorary degrees.
This editorial was entirely unfair for the
simple reason that Stanford has never conferred
an honorary degree. We did not do so even on
the occasion of our Fiftieth Anniversary last
year when a score of the country's most dis
tinguished scholars were invited to address j
groups at the various celebrations.
Though we never give degrees, our faculty
members, however, have been the recipients of
such honors. Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
ranked third or fourth in number of honorary i
degrees received in this country a few years
ago and our most distinguished alumnus, Her
bert Hoover, ranked first.
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, along with Mac-
Arthur, Dr. Hu Shih, the Chinese ambassador,
and Georgia O'Keefe, the artist, will receive
an honorary degree from Wisconsin next month.
