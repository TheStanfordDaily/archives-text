### AMIE REICHERT 
(Charlie Bulotti pinch-hits for Miss Reichert
today.—Editor)
JF I AM not the envy of a good portion of the cam
pus, I figure I should be, because I am trying to
do what I think a lot of people want to do—write a
column.
I expect to incur the wrath of at least three people
through this journalistic butchery. First, Amie Reich
ert, because this should decrease her reading public;
second, Mike Churchill, because my frequent use of the
first person singular in this tone is really encroaching
upon his current art-form, Bull Session; and last, Cyc
Covey, because I am going to review a movie.
The name of this movie is "The Invaders." I saw
it the other night and I can't forget it, so I figure I
might as well try to persuade someone else to see it
so that I can rave to an understanding public.

HPHE TERRIFIC and unique thing about this show
is that it manages to hit a certain nail on the
head, which is an occurrence all too infrequent in the
cinema world. If any of you have been wondering
what in the hell this war is about, you ought to find
out from this masterful Canadian production.
In it you'll find what makes the Nazi and anti-Nazi
minds tick. You'll discover yourself, probably, some
where in the characters as portrayed by some of
the world's finest actors. None of these Canadians
started out by thinking that this war was his war. One
was a French-Canadian woodsman; one was a live
and let live artist; one was a soldier who didn't par
ticularly like the way the war was being run. All of
them ended up by realizing what we all must realize
—that we are fighting this whole thing for the right
to feel just as unco-operative as they if we want to.
But if we don't pitch in and win, we'll co-operate
later by request.
Well, the above is one man's plug for a good show.
This isn't a "Hate picture." You'll probably come out
without hating anyone very much.
But you should come out a little limp from the
chase, but a lot surer of what's going on in this world.

Well, the above is one man's plug for a good show.
This isn't a "Hate picture." You'll probably come out
without hating anyone very much.
But you should come out a little limp from the
chase, but a lot surer of what's going on in this world.
(Charlie Bulotti pinch-hits for Miss Reichert

JF I AM not the envy of a good portion of the cam
pus, I figure I should be, because I am trying to
do what I think a lot of people want to do—write a
column.
I expect to incur the wrath of at least three people
through this journalistic butchery. First, Amie Reich
ert, because this should decrease her reading public;
second, Mike Churchill, because my frequent use of the
first person singular in this tone is really encroaching
upon his current art-form, Bull Session; and last, Cyc
Covey, because I am going to review a movie.
The name of this movie is "The Invaders." I saw
it the other night and I can't forget it, so I figure I
might as well try to persuade someone else to see it
so that I can rave to an understanding public.

HPHE TERRIFIC and unique thing about this show
is that it manages to hit a certain nail on the
head, which is an occurrence all too infrequent in the
cinema world. If any of you have been wondering
what in the hell this war is about, you ought to find
out from this masterful Canadian production.
In it you'll find what makes the Nazi and anti-Nazi
minds tick. You'll discover yourself, probably, some
where in the characters as portrayed by some of
the world's finest actors. None of these Canadians
started out by thinking that this war was his war. One
was a French-Canadian woodsman; one was a live
and let live artist; one was a soldier who didn't par
ticularly like the way the war was being run. All of
them ended up by realizing what we all must realize
—that we are fighting this whole thing for the right
to feel just as unco-operative as they if we want to.
But if we don't pitch in and win, we'll co-operate
later by request.
