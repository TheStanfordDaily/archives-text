### MIKE CHURCHILL 
BLOOD, SWEAT, SHAKES AND FEARS
r MAY possibly be my last column. I am taking
the fatalistic attitude, it is true, but then I know
my limitations if anybody does.
A publicity conscious chairman with a vampirish
twist of mind roped me into joining the first contin
gent of Stanfordites to contribute their precious life
fluid to the Red Cross Blood Bank.
Never having been classified as exactly robust, I
am to go down there with such physical specimens as
Don Burness and George Jackson.
If you have ever listened to the Bob Hope-Skinnay
Ennis repartee you will have some idea of what I
have been subjected to during the past few days.
One sardonic associate editor was unkind enough
to suggest that I would be better off to buy a quart
or two rather than hope to contribute.
Speaking of Skinnay Ennis, the Junior Prom Show
Boat Shuffle comes on Friday. Why I am concerned I
don't know, for it is unlikely that I will be able to be
even carried there.
But it does seem a little stupid for people to criti
cize the music. This isn't a hot-shot college from the
Los Angeles area. It was decided here some time ago
to forego Big Name Bands. The war, y'know. I swear
that you people physically fit enough to dance can
have just as good a time with Ernie Lewis as with
Kay Kyser.

I have heard that Ernie is pretty d*** good. The
street dance last Friday was a lot of fun with hardly
any music and the Delts bowled them over with just
three pieces Saturday. It's the party and the crowd
that counts. Some are just acting stupid in turning
up their noses at the music and turning down the
chance for a good party.
But to get back to the Blood Bank, in fact, I'll
probably never leave it alive, it is recognized by all
and sundry as a worthy cause. I fully intended offer
ing to contribute, but I was going to do so under an
assumed name. While it may kill me to give up some
of my precious corpuscles, that fate is as nothing com
pared to what I will have to endure if I am rejected
as a donor.

JF WHAT I heard is true, you can now pick up a
white cable stitch sweater with a red and blue
neck band for practically nothing down at Mose's.
