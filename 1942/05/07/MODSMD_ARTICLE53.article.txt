# CAMPUS OPINION

EDITOR, SIR:
One of the changes—and there are few—that the
war has made in life at Stanford has been a consid
erable toning down of our social activities. It was
clearly understood as far back as last quarter that for
the duration, Stanford would refrain from having big
name bands for Farm dances. The question was fully
discussed and settled with an air of finality that
should have made some kind of impression on the
campus.
Apparently the impression was not a deep or lasting
one. "Overwhelmed. '43" writing to The Daily, be
wails the fact that the Junior Prom has not secured a
big name band such as Glen Miller or Harry James
like U.S.C. or U.C.L.A. did. The reasons for this deci
sion were hashed and rehashed last quarter. The ques
tion narrows down to one of good taste as well as one
of economy.
Ernie Lewis' band was chosen because he was by
far the best band the Prom Committee could find in
the Bay Area, and we considered a good many. His
music is not Glen Miller, to be sure, but neither is it
Lu Watters. It will not violate "the sweet and smooth
music" tradition as "Overwhelmed '43" complained.
The Committee which made the choice was not short
sighted enough to assume that Stanford students want
to jitterbug their way through four hours of a Jun
ior Prom in tuxedoes and evening dresses.
The music will be appropriate to the occasion. The
only difference is that there is no big name to glorify
and publicize.

r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
Comes a time for playing and comes a time for
working. It is harder than h—l to study on these
swell, balmy nights of the spring quarter.
Why must some people always try to ruin things?
About 8 p.m. for the past few nights, some comics
drive by Encina and Toyon halls blowing their horns
and yelling like bats out of hell.
Something ought to be done about such goings-on.
The fact that they have time to take it easy doesn't
mean that they should prevent others from getting
something done.
A tired student
