# Angna Enters Fills Recital With Hilarity
## 
### 
Sometimes risque but always so
phisticated, sometimes pious but
with her tongue in her cheek, Angna
Entei's, the mime, from a French
cocotte to a cardinal with castanets,
was just short of hilarious in her
Memorial Hall recital last night.
She uttered not a word in two full
hours of pantomime, but her un
merciful satire, varied, zestful, and
thoroughly feminine, conveyed its
design most lucidly.
The recital consisted of eleven
dance skits, each complete with spe
cial wardrobe and appropriate ac
companiment. Among the scenes,
none of which repeated the parody
elements of the others, she played
her commencement piece in pigtails,
got into the corset of Madame
Pompadour, and slashingly derided
modern ballet.â€”Covey
