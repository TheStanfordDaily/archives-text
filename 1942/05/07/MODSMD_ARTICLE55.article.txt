# Isolationist Bulow Out in Primaries
## 
### United Press 
South Dakota's rejection of U.S.
Senator William J. Bulow, veteran
Democrat and pre-war isolationist,
remained the biggest upset recorded
in primary elections in four states
as late returns trickled in tonight.
Bulow and Representative William
T. Schulte of Indiana were excep
tions to the trend as voters returned
most incumbents to office in light
balloting yesterday in South Dakota,
Indiana, Alabama and Florida. Bu
low, who has served three terms in
the Senate, trailed former Governor
Tom Berry by 22,925 votes to 9,200
on the basis of nearly complete re
turns. Berry is a staunch adminis
tration supporter.'
