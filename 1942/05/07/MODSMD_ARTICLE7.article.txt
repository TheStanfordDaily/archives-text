# Agency to Run Salvage Drive
## 
### 
Collections for Stanford's "Salvage
for Victory'' campaign will be made
by students this week-end for the
last time, Ed Porter, drive chairman,
announced yesterday.
"Our purpose is to get salvageable
material back into production," he
said. "Because collection equipment
has become such a problem, we feel
a private agency can do a more effi
cient job. The campus collection
agency has volunteered men and
trucks to do this."
Dick Barger and his assistants,
Jack Drach and AI Miossi, will make
his regular collection tour this
week-endâ€”visiting Roble and all so
rorities today and fraternities and
halls tomorrow.
Paper should be segregated from
rags, metal, and rubber for collec
tion, Barger said. Paper boxes in
side houses will be discontinued af
ter this week because of the fire
hazard.
