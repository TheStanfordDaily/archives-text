# Commandos Fight Way Into Diego Suarez Streets
## Japanese Drive Up Burma Road Into Yunan 
### 
CHUNGKING, May 6 (UP)—Jap
anese spearheads, driving ahead in
spite of U.S. Army air attacks that
have knocked out 74 of their sup
porting planes, have pushed 50 miles
into China's Yunan Province along
the Burma Road, where a major
battle now looms before the 3,000-
foot banks of the upper Salwecn
River, war dispatches said tonight.
(The London radio reported that
Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek has arrived at a town in Yun
nan Province on the Burmese fron
tier.)
Even as the invaders of China's
back door extended their advance
to the vicinity of Mangshih, where
heavy fighting raged, big American
bombers from India smashed again
at the Mingaladon airdrome north of
Rangoon.
NINE MORE JAPS
Another nine Japanese planes were
shot down by the American volun
teer group in two days of fighting
over their base at Paoshan on the
Burma Road 100 miles north of
Mingshih, which the Japanese have
been raiding with as many as 27
bombers at a time.
Paoshan is the primary defense
objective of Chinese reinforce
ments, including mechanized units,
which are streaming down the
Burma Road from inner China and
throwing up positions on the banks
of the Salween, 25 miles northeast
of Mingshih.
By capturing Paoshan, only 100
miles beyond their point of farthest
advance, the Japanese could cut
communications between Burma and
China completely and trap the Chi
nese and British troops left in cen
tral and eastern Burma.
BRITISH WITHDRAW
The Chinese and some of the Brit
ish forces in Burma are withdrawing
up the Irrawaddy toward Bhamo,
hoping to take the road to Paoshan.
The other line of retreat from
Burma, followed by the main Brit
ish forces, leads up the Chidwin
River to India.
A Chinese communique said the
Japanese have not consolidated
their advance to Mangshih, and that
fighting was still in progress 40 miles
south of there, at Chefang, as well
as in the vicinity of wanting, on
the China-Burma border.

bombers at a time.
Paoshan is the primary defense
objective of Chinese reinforce
ments, including mechanized units,
which are streaming down the
Burma Road from inner China and
throwing up positions on the banks
of the Salween, 25 miles northeast
of Mingshih.
By capturing Paoshan, only 100
miles beyond their point of farthest
advance, the Japanese could cut
communications between Burma and
China completely and trap the Chi
nese and British troops left in cen
tral and eastern Burma.
BRITISH WITHDRAW
The Chinese and some of the Brit
ish forces in Burma are withdrawing
up the Irrawaddy toward Bhamo,
hoping to take the road to Paoshan.
The other line of retreat from
Burma, followed by the main Brit
ish forces, leads up the Chidwin
River to India.
A Chinese communique said the
Japanese have not consolidated
their advance to Mangshih, and that
fighting was still in progress 40 miles
south of there, at Chefang, as well
as in the vicinity of wanting, on
the China-Burma border.
CHUNGKING, May 6 (UP)—Jap
anese spearheads, driving ahead in
spite of U.S. Army air attacks that
have knocked out 74 of their sup
porting planes, have pushed 50 miles
into China's Yunan Province along
the Burma Road, where a major
battle now looms before the 3,000-
foot banks of the upper Salwecn
River, war dispatches said tonight.
(The London radio reported that
Chinese Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek has arrived at a town in Yun
nan Province on the Burmese fron
tier.)
Even as the invaders of China's
back door extended their advance
to the vicinity of Mangshih, where
heavy fighting raged, big American
bombers from India smashed again
at the Mingaladon airdrome north of
Rangoon.
NINE MORE JAPS
Another nine Japanese planes were
shot down by the American volun
teer group in two days of fighting
over their base at Paoshan on the
Burma Road 100 miles north of
Mingshih, which the Japanese have
