# Junior Week-end Will Start Today
## Scrunch Promises Barbecue, Dance 
### 
It has arrived — Stanford's first
Junior Week-end gets under way
today with the Junior Scrunch; ac
tivities for tomorrow arc the all
campus Junior Water Carnival, and
then the Junior Prom, with dancing
in the Pavilion from 9 to 1. The
Sadler Series movie, "The Lady
Vanishes," closes the week-end on
Sunday evening.
Tho Scrunch will begin at G: 15 on
the Women's Archery field adjoin
ing the Women's Gym, and will last
until 11:30. Only juniors are ad-

mitted to the Scrunch, and tickets
are being sold in the various campus
organizations by class members for
55 cents.
After the .barbecue an informal
get-together will be held the Wom
en's Gym, under the direction of
Jack Pugh and Chris Moody. The
program will include informal
dancing to records, community sing
ing, an old-time movie of the flicker
days, and skits. This is the first
all-junior activity since the Class of
'43 left the confines of Roble and
Encina.
FLOAT PARADE
The parade of floats will start off
the Water Carnival at 2 p.m. at Lake
Lagunita. Prizes will be given to
winners of the various events —11 in
all—and a point score kept. To the
men's and women's group having
the largest aggregate score will go a
sweepstakes trophy. These awards
have been purchased by the junior,
sophomore, and freshman classes.
One of the highlights of the Car
nival will be the crowning of the
"Aquapollo." Some of Stanford's
best beef and brawn—some brown,
some lily white—will be on display.
The judges haven't said if they will
count most on a streamlined Bill
Cowden physique or the solid torso
type of Ed Stamm. Others claim that
the Vic Caglieri type is what will
sway the four Barbara judges: Gas
tcl, Slaughter, Sadler, and Bassett.
Carnival Co - Chairmen Leslie
Langneckcr and Tom Ohliger have
requested that all organizations have
their floats on the lake at 1:30.
