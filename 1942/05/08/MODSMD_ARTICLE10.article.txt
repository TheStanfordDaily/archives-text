# Navy Sinks 12 Japanese Ships In Battle Off Solomon Islands; Madagascar Capture Completed
## Lightning-like Offensive Costs British 1000 Soldiers as French Resistance 'Folds Like Balloon' 
### 
LONDON, May 7 (UP). —Britain's lightning occupation of northernmost j
Madagascar ended in decisive victory today when French defenders, ■
swamped by a 18-hour assault which cost the Brit'J.h mure than 1.000
men, surrendered the Diego Suarez naval base, dominating stronghold of
the entire island. 1

Vichy French resistance collapsed (
like a puncturcd balloon under the
final British land attack during the
night on Antsirane, chief town of
the great land-locked harbor, after
Diego Suarez had fallen yesterday.
Climaxing a synchronized assault
j by British land, sea and air forces
which had been three months in the
j planning, the commanders of the vic
! tors and vanquished drew up the
i agreement for French capitulation,
j giving the United Nations a formi
} dable base in the Japanese-menaced
j Indian Ocean.
SURRENDER CONFIRMED
(Official Vichy announcement con
| firmed the surrender of Diego Sua
| rez, and the capture of Colonel
i Edouard Claerecout, commander of
j the fortress, and the commander of
i the French naval forces along with
j the troops. Governor General Ar
rnand Annet notified Vichy that "all
; other parts of the island will'be de
fended with the same determina-
I tion." Jules Brevie, Secretary of
I Colonies, messaged Annet that "the
I fight must continue in Madagascar
j despite the loss of Diego Suarez.")
The British naval force off Mada
gascar, reported unofficially to num
ber more than a score of ships, was
cleaning out the mined approach to
Diego Suarez Bay preparatory to
steaming in and putting the final
seal on the conquest.
CONQUEST EXTENT UNKNOWN
How much of Madagascar Britain
j planned to occupy was not known.
I Informants noted the potential con
sequences of a Japanese attempt to
J land elsewhere on the 1,000-mile
| long island, but at the same time
t said that Majungo on the northwest
1 coast was the only other base of any
j real naval value.
Free French sources here, com
menting on unsubstantiated rumors
i that Vichy might now turn over the
| Ficnch fleet to the Axis, said it was
i "absurd" to suggest that Pierre La
j val would take any such action, add
i ing that "that is the only thing
' France has left."
