# One Light Cruiser, Four Gunboats, Two Destroyers, One Supply Ship Go Down in 'Great Sea Victory'
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 7 (UP). —The United States Navy lias won one
of the greatest sea battles of the war by sinking or damaging 12 Japanese
ships, nine of them warships, in a great action on May \ on the northeast
Australian front oIT the Solomon Islands.
News of the great victory came a little more than 24 hours after

announcement of the fall of Corre
gidor, last strong American position
in the Philippines, and was consid
ered ample revenge for that defeat
plus the loss of a number of U.S.
warships in the battle of the Java
Sea during February.
Destruction of the Japanese fleet,
it was felt, had removed an imme
diate menace to the vital supply line
from the United States to General
Douglas A. MaeArthur's forces in
Australia.
EIGHT DEFINITELY SUNK
Eight of the ships were definitely
sunk and four were badly damaged
In addition, six Japanese planes were
destroyed. The action was carried
out with the loss of but three United
States planes.
The Japanese fleet presumably was
part of a Japanese invasion force
that had been reported moving to
ward the Solomon Islands.
The Navy listed as sunk: one light
cruiser, two destroyers, four gun
boats and one supply vessel.
The Navy also revealed that U.S.
submarines in the Far East in sepa
rate actions had sunk three enemy
vessels—a medium-sized cargo ship,
a medium-sized tanker and a small
cargo ship.
STATES LOCATION OF FIGHT
The communique said merely that
the battle took place "in the vi
cinity of the Solomon Islands," which
are northeast of Australia, slightly
to the east of Japan's strong land,
sea and air bases on New Britain and
New Guinea islands and north of
the new American base on Free
French New Caledonia Island.
The area is one in which the Japa
nese navy nominally has been con
sidered dominant and would indi
cate that a powerful American force,
probably a task force based on Ha
waii, was involved.
The fact that a number of planes
were involved would indicate that,
the American force included at least
one aircraft carrier.
Japan has many land-based planes
in the vicinity, at Rabaul, on New
Britain, and on the Japanese man
date island bases to the northward.
The battle, however, probably took
place outside the range of Nipponese
! fighter craft.

cargo ship.
STATES LOCATION OF FIGHT
The communique said merely that
the battle took place "in the vi
cinity of the Solomon Islands," which
are northeast of Australia, slightly
to the east of Japan's strong land,
sea and air bases on New Britain and
New Guinea islands and north of
the new American base on Free
French New Caledonia Island.
The area is one in which the Japa
nese navy nominally has been con
sidered dominant and would indi
cate that a powerful American force,
probably a task force based on Ha
waii, was involved.
The fact that a number of planes
were involved would indicate that,
the American force included at least
one aircraft carrier.
Japan has many land-based planes
in the vicinity, at Rabaul, on New
Britain, and on the Japanese man
date island bases to the northward.
The battle, however, probably took
place outside the range of Nipponese
! fighter craft.
WASHINGTON, May 7 (UP). —The United States Navy lias won one
of the greatest sea battles of the war by sinking or damaging 12 Japanese
ships, nine of them warships, in a great action on May \ on the northeast
Australian front oIT the Solomon Islands.
News of the great victory came a little more than 24 hours after

announcement of the fall of Corre
gidor, last strong American position
in the Philippines, and was consid
ered ample revenge for that defeat
plus the loss of a number of U.S.
warships in the battle of the Java
Sea during February.
Destruction of the Japanese fleet,
it was felt, had removed an imme
diate menace to the vital supply line
from the United States to General
Douglas A. MaeArthur's forces in
Australia.
EIGHT DEFINITELY SUNK
Eight of the ships were definitely
sunk and four were badly damaged
In addition, six Japanese planes were
destroyed. The action was carried
out with the loss of but three United
States planes.
The Japanese fleet presumably was
part of a Japanese invasion force
that had been reported moving to
ward the Solomon Islands.
The Navy listed as sunk: one light
cruiser, two destroyers, four gun
boats and one supply vessel.
The Navy also revealed that U.S.
submarines in the Far East in sepa
rate actions had sunk three enemy
vessels—a medium-sized cargo ship,
a medium-sized tanker and a small
cargo ship.
