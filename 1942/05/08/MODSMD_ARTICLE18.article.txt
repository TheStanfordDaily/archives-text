# Daily Omits Portion Of Code Poll Results
## 
### 
In publishing results of the
Honor Code poll in yesterday's
paper, The Daily inadvertently de
leted a part of the tabulation on
Question 15 which read, "What
steps would you take if you ob
served a violation? The reply of
â– 157 students that they would take
no steps was omitted. The omis
sion was called to the attention of
The Daily by Council Chairman
Helen Kimball, who regards this
answer from one-third of those
students polled as highly signifi
cant.
