CHUNKING, M:iy 7 (Cl*). —Generalissimo Chiang Kai-shek's Yunnan
Province fortes have checked a Japanese Burma army with heavy losses
21 miles inside China, it was announced tonight, hut unofficial reports
said another Japanese offshoot from Burma was moving against India and
threatening the Indian port of Chittagong, Bft miles beyond the Burma
border. a

The report of the move on India
came as the Japanese appeared defi
nitoly to have lost their momentum
in Yunnan Province in a three-day
battle before Chefang, and Chinese
sources confirmed thai U.S. Lieut.
Gen. Joseph W. Stilwell continued
1o direct Chinos'* forces in Burma

I.AND NEAR AKYAB
Chinese spokesmen recalled that
Japanese troops were reported to
have landed near Akyab, Burmese
[tort HiO miles south of Chittagong,
last month a report denied subse
quently in Allied quarters but re
|,(-a;ed persistently by Axis sources.
A landing at Akyab, they said,
t aturally would precede a drive on
Chittagong because the only feas
ible communications through north
western Burma and eastern India
follow the passes in the Arakan
mountains along the coast between
the two ports.
DRIVE ON CHITTAGONG
When the landing at Akyab was
Mi't.l reported Allied forces feared
that the Japanese might drive on to
Chittagong, a potentially valuable
base for raids and possible invasion
a"ain;t industrial southeast India.
Chinese spokesmen said that Stil
well's forces were effectively pre
venting Japanese attempts to drive
I: rther north in Burma but a British
communique said that the invaders
had slipped spearheads through on
either hide of Mandalay threatening
t'i envelop the British and Chinese
immediately north of there.
(l t. FRILLA WARFARE
To the southeast, in virtually
conquered Burma, Chinese troops are
still conducting "mobile" (guerilla)
warfare against Japanese overrun
ning the British colony, a Chinese
spokesman said, "and they will not
withdraw from Burma so long as
the Japanese are there."
