# 'War Idealism Should Carry Into Peacetime'
## 
### LOUIS FISCHER 
(Editor's Note: This is the fourth
of a series of articles on (lie next
peace from the hook "Dawn of
V ictory" hy Louis Fischer.)

War inspires men and women to
the nohlest deeds. People are ready
to die for an idea. Nations co-oper- ]
ate and forget what divides them. (
If only the idealism of wartime car- i
lied over into the peace we might
have a real peace and a cleaner, bet
ter, happier world.
Two things can be done immedi
ately: The public can voice its deter
mination to have a peace which goes
deep, which goes beyond map-carv
ing, which tackles the social, eco
nomic, and political causes of wars.
The public can put into office and
into positions of responsibility men
and women to whom principles are
dearer than privilege, and decency
dearer than dollars, to whom the
welfare of the common people is
more important than the advance
ment of special interests, whose first
allegiance is to human rights and
not to property rights, who have a
social consciousness and not merely
a strong party - machine backing,
who are not stick-in-the-mud old
fogies with sclerotic brains and a j
devotion to everything that was,
who are forward-looking and imagi- j
native. There are such.
DIPLOMATIC SERVICES
The diplomatic services of the
democracies should immediately be
cleansed of the numerous snobs and
appeasers whose pro-fascist attitude
toward Abyssinia, Spain, and Czech- j
oslovakia helped make this war.
All servants of democracy should j
be persons who automatically trans- j
late democracy into the elimination !
of slums, equal opportunities for
Negroes, social security, a minimum
wage, no. speculation in land values,
development of economically back
ward areas, honest business prac- |
tices, collective bargaining between j
employer and labor, free speech, free
medical aid to the underprivileged,
free higher education for the poor,
freedom from racial discrimination,
and freedom from worry over un- J
employment and old age. True
democracy within countries would
be conducive to peace between j
countries.
ASSIST WITH PEACE
We might as well make up our i
minds that if America does not par
ticipate in an enlightened peace {
which improves the world there will j
be no peace. There will be another i
major war and we will be drawn I
into it as we were twice in 24 years.
The United States may be in a
; mood of self-centered isolation and
disgust with Europe when the hos- i
tilities cease. If that induces Amer
ica to remain aloof from post-war
I reconstruction we will have wasted
; half our war effort. Moreover, the
| economy of the United States wou'd
I suffer.

DIPLOMATIC SERVICES
The diplomatic services of the
democracies should immediately be
cleansed of the numerous snobs and
appeasers whose pro-fascist attitude
toward Abyssinia, Spain, and Czech- j
oslovakia helped make this war.
All servants of democracy should j
be persons who automatically trans- j
late democracy into the elimination !
of slums, equal opportunities for
Negroes, social security, a minimum
wage, no. speculation in land values,
development of economically back
ward areas, honest business prac- |
tices, collective bargaining between j
employer and labor, free speech, free
medical aid to the underprivileged,
free higher education for the poor,
freedom from racial discrimination,
and freedom from worry over un- J
employment and old age. True
democracy within countries would
be conducive to peace between j
countries.
ASSIST WITH PEACE
We might as well make up our i
minds that if America does not par
ticipate in an enlightened peace {
which improves the world there will j
be no peace. There will be another i
major war and we will be drawn I
into it as we were twice in 24 years.
The United States may be in a
; mood of self-centered isolation and
disgust with Europe when the hos- i
tilities cease. If that induces Amer
ica to remain aloof from post-war
I reconstruction we will have wasted
; half our war effort. Moreover, the
| economy of the United States wou'd
I suffer.

peace from the hook "Dawn of
V ictory" hy Louis Fischer.)

War inspires men and women to
the nohlest deeds. People are ready
to die for an idea. Nations co-oper- ]
ate and forget what divides them. (
If only the idealism of wartime car- i
lied over into the peace we might
have a real peace and a cleaner, bet
ter, happier world.
Two things can be done immedi
ately: The public can voice its deter
mination to have a peace which goes
deep, which goes beyond map-carv
ing, which tackles the social, eco
nomic, and political causes of wars.
The public can put into office and
into positions of responsibility men
and women to whom principles are
dearer than privilege, and decency
dearer than dollars, to whom the
welfare of the common people is
more important than the advance
ment of special interests, whose first
allegiance is to human rights and
not to property rights, who have a
social consciousness and not merely
a strong party - machine backing,
who are not stick-in-the-mud old
fogies with sclerotic brains and a j
devotion to everything that was,
who are forward-looking and imagi- j
native. There are such.
