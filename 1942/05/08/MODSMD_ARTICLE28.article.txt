### H. D. THOREAU 
r PONJGHT in San Francisco on the
occasion of the opening of a
couple of new swimming pools at
the Central Y.MC.A. Emmett Cash
in, Stanford's modest, handsome, un
sung, ineligible swimming sensation,
will compete in the 100-yard and
500-yard freestyle Pacific Association
championship races.
Emmett, holder of several Ameri
can records and holder of more jun
ior national titles, wasn't able to en
ter in his specialty, the breast stroke,
since they aren't holding it tonight,
so he just signed up for two of
three events on the program —he re
frained from entering the 200-yard
freestyle event in order to give the
other boys a chance to grab a blue
ribbon.
Not that his competition are
(I(ids. Don Beanston, Bear frosh
slar, and Bill Lucas of the Olym
pic Club are two of the best dis
tance swimmers on the coast. The
host team from the Y.M.C.A. has a
man who has broken 54 seconds in
the 100, which they will put into
the race.
The events, one of which would
be enough to make most competi
tors lose interest for a while, will be
spaced a few minutes apart, so that
Cashin will be able to dry off be
fore diving in again.
Despite all of these slight obstacles,
don't be surprised if Emmett comes
back to the Farm tomorrow morn
ing with the jewelry.
At present one of Cashin's ad
mirers is writing an article about
him fer publication in one of the
national boys' magazines. Em
mett would be glad to oblige his
Boswell by breaking the world's
records in the 440 and 500-yard
brcaststroke—or something like
that—in the Eneina pools sonic
afternoon in the immediate fu
ture, in fact he would have done
il some time ago, if they could as
semble six stop watches at one
time, the required .number in or
der to make a record official.

After his arduous labor tonight
! one would think that Emmett could
1 stay over the week-end with his
j parents in the city, but no—he must
j come back tomorrow morning to
compete in the junior water carnival
i in the afternoon.

QVER the week-end three of the
Farm's premier netters, Jimmy
Wade, Larry Dee, and Ted Schroe
der, will be up at Berkeley along
with Helen "Poker-Puss" Wills
Moody Roark, Lou Abbott, of Ab
bott and Costello fame. Bud Costello
of Abbott and Costello fame, and
several other celebrities, all of them
giving their "all" for Navy relief.
I think the boys deserve a ripple
i of applause for devoting their time
I and energy to such a worthy cause.
! Ripple.

SECOND thought it occurred
to me that if Abbott and Cos
tello's tennis game in any way re
sembled that shown by Mickey
j Rooney in some relief matches dur
ing the Pacific Southwest Tourney
in L.A. last fall, maybe the Berke
! ley audience will need the relief
[ more than the Navy.
In line with these exhibitions,
j Coach Johnny Lamb is trying to line
[ up some matches for the Farm courts
[ in a few weeks, which will also be
for a worthy cause also—sending the
1 Card netters to the national matches
in New Orleans.
