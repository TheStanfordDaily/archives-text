The Duke Ellington of the West,
Ernie Lewis, will be presented for
the approval of the Stanford cam
pus in the annual Junior Prom to
morrow night in the Pavilion from
9 to 1. The theme is The Show Boat |
Shuffle. Tickets may still be pur- \
chased at the A.S.S.U. offices for
$2.20.
Lewis' 12-picce band is highly re
garded in the Bay Area as one of
the rising bands in this area. He
has added Vera Keys to the organi
zation to supply the vocals.
The Lewis arrangements are pre
dominantly sweet, featuring his two
saxophone players, Curtis Lowe and
Stompy Jones. "We'll play anything
the dancers want—even waltzes,"
said Lewis, who is a master of the
keyboard.
GUT BUCKET TIME
During the intermissions the crew
will show ofT its versatility by a gut
bucket session with the Katzenjam
mers, which consists of Lewis on
piano, a bass, guitar, sax, trumpet,
and drums. This is the only time
that real swing music will be
played.
The decorations will create the
atmosphere of dancing on a wharf.
The band will play from a pier,
erected on pilings, with the railings
of the Pavilion representing the rail
ings of a Show Boat. Even the
lighting theme will be carried out
into the lobby, according to Allyn
Scarborough, in charge of decora
tions.
SWEET ANI) HOT
Some of Lewis' best arrangements
are "I'm Confessing" and "Stardust."
In his "Blues in the Night" arrange
ment, the saxes groan in typical ne
gro blues style, fading into smooth
rhythm from the trumpet section.

Amie Reichert and Ray Hammctt.

tions, Ralph Shafferzick, Allyn
Scarborough, Bob Griswold, and
