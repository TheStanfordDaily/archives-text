# Indian Track Men Battle U.S.C. Power
## 
### 
Tonight S.P. iron horse No. 57 will
take on the form of a giant wooden
horse since it will be carrying IS
Stanford trackmen determined to
undermine the mighty Trojans when
the two meet tomorrow afternoon on
the Los Angeles Coliseum track.
Whether or not the modern men
of Troy, otherwise known as stu
dents of the University of Southern
California, will be fooled by the In
dians in their iron horse, is a matter
that most pseudo-experts have al
ready definitely decided on, but
there still is a chance that the en
tire S.C. team will be stricken in
the next 24 hours.
Nevertheless, several Stanford
men are favored to win their partic
ular events from the title-holding
Trojans. Indians Ed Stamm and Ed
Hertel boast the most marks on the
coast in the shot put and high hur
dles, respectively.
INDIAN COMPETITION
Stamm will have as competition
three men who have put. the shot
over 50 feet, a distance he reached
only two weeks ago.
Hertel's competition in the highs
stems from John Biewener, angu
lar Trojan senior. In the lows Dick
Browning i.nd Walt Smith should be
too much for Hertel, who has run
only two complete flights of hurdles
in the last three weeks due to a
pulled muscle.
John Silva, only recently released
from a sick bed. and Bil Quacken
bush will represent Stanford in the
sprints against a half-dozen top
flight Southerners. Mort Orme and
Bob Smith of the Farm will face
even more overwhelming competi
tion in the quarter-mile, since Tro
jans Hudie Kerns and Cliff Bour
land are rated as the two best 440
men in the world.
CRIPE, COMPTON, DISIIER
Three men Wyland Cripe, Bob
Compton, and Jim Disher will share
the distance assignments for Coach
Pitch Johnson. Cripe will probably
run the 880, with Compton running
both the mile and two-mile, the
latter with Disher. Leroy Weed,
outstanding distance man on the
coast, should be sufficient represen
tation for the Trojans in the dis
tances.
Don Reiss, sophomore, will be
running both hurdle races with
Hertel. and should finish well up in
both. He finished second to Brown
ing last week-end in the P.A. meet
lows.
Javelin throwers A1 Pande and
Ernie Peninou will be fairly evenly
matched with Trojans Dick Petti
grew and Jules Johnson when the
spear tossing commences.
DISCUS OPPONENTS
Stamm's main competition in the
shot, Carl Merritt and Wilbur
Thompson, both of Modesto, will
also heckle him and Hank Norberg
in the discus. However, if the two
Esceemen can keep within the
throwing circle they should win
handily.
Captain Gene Kern, Stanford ace
broadjumper. who has been com
peting in excellent fields all season,
will find tomorrow's meet no excep
tion. Mel Blocker and Ken Wren
both have surpassed 24 feet.
IF SCHAEFEK SLUMPS
Vern Hart on his favorite pit and
the fast-improving Willard Smith
should be good enough high jump
ers to take most any meet in the
country, but no—they must face two
6-8 jumpers from Troy.
If Trojan Bill Schaefer remains in
his recent slump either Ed Tomaso
or Russ Peck stands a good chance
of winning the pole vault.

Browning i.nd Walt Smith should be
too much for Hertel, who has run
only two complete flights of hurdles
in the last three weeks due to a
pulled muscle.
John Silva, only recently released
from a sick bed. and Bil Quacken
bush will represent Stanford in the
sprints against a half-dozen top
flight Southerners. Mort Orme and
Bob Smith of the Farm will face
even more overwhelming competi
tion in the quarter-mile, since Tro
jans Hudie Kerns and Cliff Bour
land are rated as the two best 440
men in the world.
CRIPE, COMPTON, DISIIER
Three men Wyland Cripe, Bob
Compton, and Jim Disher will share
the distance assignments for Coach
Pitch Johnson. Cripe will probably
run the 880, with Compton running
both the mile and two-mile, the
latter with Disher. Leroy Weed,
outstanding distance man on the
coast, should be sufficient represen
tation for the Trojans in the dis
tances.
Don Reiss, sophomore, will be
running both hurdle races with
Hertel. and should finish well up in
both. He finished second to Brown
ing last week-end in the P.A. meet
lows.
Javelin throwers A1 Pande and
Ernie Peninou will be fairly evenly
matched with Trojans Dick Petti
grew and Jules Johnson when the
spear tossing commences.
DISCUS OPPONENTS
Stamm's main competition in the
shot, Carl Merritt and Wilbur
Thompson, both of Modesto, will
also heckle him and Hank Norberg
in the discus. However, if the two
Esceemen can keep within the
throwing circle they should win
handily.
Captain Gene Kern, Stanford ace
broadjumper. who has been com
peting in excellent fields all season,
will find tomorrow's meet no excep
tion. Mel Blocker and Ken Wren
both have surpassed 24 feet.
IF SCHAEFEK SLUMPS
Vern Hart on his favorite pit and
the fast-improving Willard Smith
should be good enough high jump
ers to take most any meet in the
country, but no—they must face two
6-8 jumpers from Troy.
If Trojan Bill Schaefer remains in
his recent slump either Ed Tomaso
or Russ Peck stands a good chance
of winning the pole vault.
Tonight S.P. iron horse No. 57 will
take on the form of a giant wooden
horse since it will be carrying IS
Stanford trackmen determined to
undermine the mighty Trojans when
the two meet tomorrow afternoon on
the Los Angeles Coliseum track.
Whether or not the modern men
of Troy, otherwise known as stu
dents of the University of Southern
California, will be fooled by the In
dians in their iron horse, is a matter
that most pseudo-experts have al
ready definitely decided on, but
there still is a chance that the en
tire S.C. team will be stricken in
the next 24 hours.
Nevertheless, several Stanford
men are favored to win their partic
ular events from the title-holding
Trojans. Indians Ed Stamm and Ed
Hertel boast the most marks on the
coast in the shot put and high hur
dles, respectively.
INDIAN COMPETITION
Stamm will have as competition
three men who have put. the shot
over 50 feet, a distance he reached
only two weeks ago.
Hertel's competition in the highs
stems from John Biewener, angu

Browning i.nd Walt Smith should be
too much for Hertel, who has run
only two complete flights of hurdles
in the last three weeks due to a
