# Hayes Pitches Zetes to Win
## 
### 
One of the rareties of baseball
happened out on Intramural Dia
mond Number Two when Sid Hayes
pitched a no-hit-no-run game, while
his Zeta Psi teammates gathered five
runs to down the Delta Chi's, 5-0.
Hayes faced but 21 men.
The Zetes got one run in the sec
ond and two each in the fourth and
fifth innings.
In the first hard ball game of the
season, the Kappa Sigs edged out
Toyon Hall, 1-0.
Chuck Hopper, Eill Joslyn, and
John Quinlin each scored three runs
to down the bulls from El Toro, 10-4.
In the fourth inning, hits by Bob
Montgomery, Tex Cull, and George
Tolman accounted for the Toro rally.
Wayne Price had little trouble in
keeping the A.T.O. ten in hand, while
the Kappa Alphas scored four runs.
In the seventh Price let down, with
his opponents pushing over two runs.
The Breakers, behind the pitching
of Sherman Selix, staged an eight
run third inning to easily bowl over
the A.K.L. 10-2.
El Capitan fell before the Beta
team, 8-4.
