# Requested Is One to Beat In Preakness
## 
### THE TURFMAN 
With a 1.000 batting average after
i naming the Kentucky Derby win
ner, the hoss dept. puts out its
! Peerless Pimlico Preakness Picks in
! this order: Requested, Alsab, and
Shutout.
After his sparkling win, Shutout
and his running mate, Devil Diver,
will go to the post favorites in a
relatively small but very select field
at Maryland tomorrow. The chest
nut son of Equipoise will be out to
prove that his Derby win was no
fluke and that he can hurdle the sec
ond step toward the three-year-old
triple crown.
Alsab, off his tremendous stretch
run Saturday, appears the second
choice, with Valdina Orphan also a
solid contender.
But we're sticking with Ben Whit
aker's Requested, an in-and-outer
at best, but a nag who didn't get a
j chance to show his stuff in the
bulky Derby field of 15. This time
is Requested's "in" race, and with a
good break could Cakewalk it wire
j to wii'e.
Sun Again, scratched from the
Derby, will be entered tomorrow,
but whether he will start or not is
a question that can only be answered
by his trainer, Ben Jones —and that
' not until shortly before post time.

With a 1.000 batting average after
i naming the Kentucky Derby win
ner, the hoss dept. puts out its
! Peerless Pimlico Preakness Picks in
! this order: Requested, Alsab, and
Shutout.
After his sparkling win, Shutout
and his running mate, Devil Diver,
will go to the post favorites in a
relatively small but very select field
at Maryland tomorrow. The chest
nut son of Equipoise will be out to
prove that his Derby win was no
fluke and that he can hurdle the sec
ond step toward the three-year-old
triple crown.
Alsab, off his tremendous stretch
run Saturday, appears the second
choice, with Valdina Orphan also a
solid contender.
But we're sticking with Ben Whit
aker's Requested, an in-and-outer
at best, but a nag who didn't get a
j chance to show his stuff in the
bulky Derby field of 15. This time
is Requested's "in" race, and with a
good break could Cakewalk it wire
j to wii'e.
Sun Again, scratched from the
Derby, will be entered tomorrow,
but whether he will start or not is
a question that can only be answered
by his trainer, Ben Jones —and that
' not until shortly before post time.
