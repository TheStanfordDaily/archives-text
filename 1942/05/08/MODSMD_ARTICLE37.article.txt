Stanford's varsity polo team will
meet the 107 th Cavalry four in the
l sceond game of the series this Sat
urday at .*5:15 p.m. on the highway
polo field. The Card poloists may
well consider themselves Western
intercollegiate champions after they
heat the 107 th 7-3 at their last meet
ing.
, Wednesday afternoon the Redskins
| met the "Linfoot & Company" polo
club and barely worked out a 9-8
victory. The Linfoot bunch is one of
| the toughest polo clubs in the Bay
Region and last Wednesday's game
1 was one of the best ever seen on the
! home field.
JBob Kumler at the number one
I spot for the Redskins has made eight
! goals in the last two games to lead
j the scoring. Against the Linfoot
Brothers team, Kumler, although a
newcomer to polo, was the most con-
I sistent player on the squad.
Against the 107 th U.S. Cavalry
j team, the Ranzoni-men played one
|of the best games of the season.
| Used to playing indoor polo, the
; 107 th couldn't get the swing on the
j ball hard enough and consequently
i didn't do much scoring. Tomorrow's
i game will be about the last home
I game of the season for the Redskins.
| The Farm poloists leave for Utah
i the week after next to meet the Utah
| team on their home field.
Lineups for Saturday:
Kulmer 1 Peters
Dirker 2 Schell
Gales 3 Undercofter
i Snure 4 lvinir
