### 
A PROBLEM that has existed right along is
now pushed into the limelight by the
emergency situation in this state.
California's watershed and timber stand com
bine to make the most vital factor in the eco
nomic welfare of the state. Deliberate man
caused fires are our worst enemies, and now
that the element of sabotage has entered the
picture, the problem of defeating the forest fire
reaches tremendous proportions.
The man power with which to fight these
fires is seriously depleted; but more important
than the mass of volunteers is the group of
trained leaders in fire-fighting. To operate effi
ciently a tank truck or water pumper or bull
dozer demands as great a technical skill as to
operate a machine gun or a 155-mm.
Some institutions must undertake to develop
leaders in the conservation field. There is no
tremendous difficulty that might prevent Stan
ford from acepting the challenge presented by
the coming crisis in forest defense.
At the present time there is a move under
way to promote Stanford's participation in this
field. Although the details are not completely
ironed out, a possible Summer Quarter program
in the mountains of eastern central California
is in the offing.
The plan is entirely unofficial as yet; whether
or not the University goes into this new field
will depend on the popular support given the
plan.
If you want to know more about this new
development contact Mr. Williams of the His
tory Department or Dr. Haan in the Education
Building.—Hap Everett
