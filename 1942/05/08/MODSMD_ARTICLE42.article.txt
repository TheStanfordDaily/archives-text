MAYBE the student body is finally waking
up to the fact that we are at war, for in
the first few weeks of this guarter the Delts, Chi
O's, Theta Chi's, Theta Xi's, Gamma Phi's, Tri
Delts, Alpha Phi's, Toyon, Roble, Lagunita, the
Junior Class, and Encina have given dances on
campus or are planning them for this week-end.
Besides these affairs, most of the sororities
and fraternities have held the ever-popular
Sunday night suppers for their dates; parties
have been given for the men from Moffett Field
and Page Mill Road; and there have been con
certs, Tuesday Evening Series, Sunday movies,
and other programs.
And after a glance at the University social
calendar for the rest of the quarter, it looks like
things will continue in the same vein.— John
