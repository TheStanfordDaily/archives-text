# No Great Tragedy

â€¢"PHERE was no disgrace in the defeat of Cor-
JL regidor. The forces there served their pur
pose admirably. They were fighting a delaying
action to prevent the thousands of Japanese in
the islands from attacking Australia.
The holding of the Philippines did not even
figure in the grand plan of the United Nations.
The great defense that was staged there was of
great value; but the surrender of Bataan and
Corregidor does not represent any great trag
edy. Had the islands been overrun as fast as
Malaya or Java, we would not have had time
to set up Australia's defenses and plan our own
offensive. Hap Everett
