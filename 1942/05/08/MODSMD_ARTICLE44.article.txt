was unquestionably a good clay for the
United Nations. Last night's U.P. dispatches elicited
a smile from even this gloomy columnist, for the
Allies chalked up two great victories against the Axis.
First was the news of the great naval battle near
the Solomon Islands which was a decisive triumph
for the U.S. Navy. A task force of our ships caught
a strong Japanese sea force napping in those waters,
which have heretofore been recognized as "Nippon
dominated and virtually destroyed the entire unit.
The score was eight ships sunk and four badly
damaged. This is one of the greatest sea victories of
the Battle of the Pacific. It brings the Allied box
score up to a total of 41 Japanese warships definitely
sunk, 14 probably sunk, and another 44 damaged.
And the grand total of Nipponese naval losses
(sunk, probably sunk, damaged) since Pearl Harbor
now is 238.
These are fat enough figures to give even crusty
old Yamamoto a migraine.
The victory means more than the figures tell. It
means that any attack on the new American base on
Free French Caledonia Island must be stillborn. It
adds a tremendous amount of security and stability to
Douglas Mac Arthur's Southwestern Pacific battle zone.
It means that our supply ships and transports have just
that much less to worry about. It increases their
chances of getting through immeasurably.

I/QUALLY good was the news from Madagascar
where an overwhelmingly strong British force se
cured their occupation of the island from the Vichy -
french.
London reported the capture of Diego Suarez, which
dominates the waters plied by U.S. convoys bound for
Suez. Now the Japanese will have to send what is
left of their fleet 3,500 miles—the distance from Tokyo
to Honolulu—if they want to disrupt the United Na
tions Middle East supply line which runs from Cape
town to the Gulf of Aden.
Vichy was very angry and said that the rest of
Madagascar would be defended "with the same deter
mination"—which apparently will not do them much
good.
