# BULL SESSION
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
WE'D DO IT!
YV/TIEN the Blood Bank doctor saw Helen Kimball,
Women's Council chairman, and Prexy George
Jackson lying side by side on the donor beds he ex
claimed, "My gad, we ought to have bundling boards."
With its patriotic value realized, and its painless
ness proved, there is no doubt that blood is going to
be the social thing to do.
Everyone that went down yesterday swears that
they will be back again in two months, the minimum
period that may elapse between donations.
There are lots of good looking Red Cross aides
running about, and according to Bobbie Sadler, Tri
Delt, the doctors aren't unattractive.
When it is all through they give you coffee that is
really good with no restrictions on sugar, wonderful
doughnuts and cake. As you walk out the door a
smiling girl plants a nice round donor pin on you.
Three bronze pins, I believe, and you get a silver one.
There is some talk that it is now quite the thing
for a girl to wear a fellow's Blood Donor pin rather
than the old style jewelry handouts.
After the first contingent were released and had
their strength restored, they all trouped back in to
watch Frank Albert and Jim Lawson pump from vein
to jar and perhaps get in the way of a photographer.
We probably broke all rules of the Blood Bank
but there is little doubt that they enjoyed having the
Stanford students. After all had left, a commissariat
worker said distractedly but good naturedly, "Well,
we had plenty of doughnuts, until the Stanford gang
cleaned us out."

WOMEBODY left the door open Wednesday and
k Charlie Bulotti wandered in. He ended up by
writing History, 1942. Instead of being overcome by
gratitude at being admitted to the select company of
backpage Daily writers, he took a nasty jab at my
"current art-form, Bull Session."
He takes exception to my "frequent use of the
first person singular. I. or perhaps I should use the
journalistic "we," can't help it if Eleanor Roosevelt
uses the same style.
You have no idea of the difficulty of writing this
column with three ex-Bull Sessioners still at large
on campus. And there is no need to raise the question
of why get a new one with so much latent talent still
at large.
I, or we (curse you, Bulotti), get so despondent
at times. No one ever says anything nice about us,
or I (see what you are doing, Bulotti). We, or (this
can't go on, Bulotti) have never meant to harm anyone,
but people come up to us (me) in the library, and
send us (me) letters, just as though there was never a
priority on acid.
Please pass the kleenex.
WE'D DO IT!

of why get a new one with so much latent talent still
at large.
I, or we (curse you, Bulotti), get so despondent
at times. No one ever says anything nice about us,
or I (see what you are doing, Bulotti). We, or (this
can't go on, Bulotti) have never meant to harm anyone,
but people come up to us (me) in the library, and
send us (me) letters, just as though there was never a
priority on acid.
Please pass the kleenex.
WE'D DO IT!
YV/TIEN the Blood Bank doctor saw Helen Kimball,
Women's Council chairman, and Prexy George
Jackson lying side by side on the donor beds he ex
claimed, "My gad, we ought to have bundling boards."
With its patriotic value realized, and its painless
ness proved, there is no doubt that blood is going to
be the social thing to do.
Everyone that went down yesterday swears that
they will be back again in two months, the minimum
period that may elapse between donations.
There are lots of good looking Red Cross aides
running about, and according to Bobbie Sadler, Tri
Delt, the doctors aren't unattractive.
When it is all through they give you coffee that is
really good with no restrictions on sugar, wonderful
doughnuts and cake. As you walk out the door a
smiling girl plants a nice round donor pin on you.
Three bronze pins, I believe, and you get a silver one.
There is some talk that it is now quite the thing
for a girl to wear a fellow's Blood Donor pin rather
than the old style jewelry handouts.
After the first contingent were released and had
their strength restored, they all trouped back in to
watch Frank Albert and Jim Lawson pump from vein
to jar and perhaps get in the way of a photographer.
We probably broke all rules of the Blood Bank
but there is little doubt that they enjoyed having the
Stanford students. After all had left, a commissariat
worker said distractedly but good naturedly, "Well,
we had plenty of doughnuts, until the Stanford gang
cleaned us out."

WOMEBODY left the door open Wednesday and
k Charlie Bulotti wandered in. He ended up by
writing History, 1942. Instead of being overcome by
gratitude at being admitted to the select company of
backpage Daily writers, he took a nasty jab at my
"current art-form, Bull Session."
He takes exception to my "frequent use of the
first person singular. I. or perhaps I should use the
journalistic "we," can't help it if Eleanor Roosevelt
uses the same style.
You have no idea of the difficulty of writing this
column with three ex-Bull Sessioners still at large
on campus. And there is no need to raise the question

at large.
