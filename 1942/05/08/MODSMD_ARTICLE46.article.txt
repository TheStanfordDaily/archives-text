COUNCILS REPLY
! r |MIE EDITOR, SIR:
A recent editorial in The Stanford Daily suggested
that Men's and Women's Councils release for publica
tion the names of students convicted of an Honor Code
violation. According to the questionnaires 457 stu
dents said they would take no action at all if they saw
a violation. Many stated their reason as being because
they did not want a fellow student to be expelled.
Now let us consider one of the basic reasons for
the Honor Code's present status. It is weak because
students refuse to consider it as a collective under
taking. which means each individual must accept the
responsibility for making it work. Would those who
refuse to turn violators in because they do not want
them to be expelled turn them in if we made a prac
tice of publishing the names of those convicted in The
Daily? It seems to be a general opinion that expul
sion is too severe for a first violation, that there is no
point in blackening an individual's future if he slips
just once. Would not printing names in The Daily be
an added impetus to this attitude?
It is evident that Stanford wants to keep is Honor
Code, but we cannot keep it jus because it is one of
our cherished traditions. If we keep it we must make
it work. To make the Honor Code work we must aim
at perfection, and this will not be possible until each
individual realizes he has an integral part in making
it so. The object of the councils at present is to de
vise some means of bringing this about.
We want tÂ«> thank all of those who co-operated in
j filling out queestionnaires in the recent poll. Many of
1 them showed serious thinking, and the ideas presented
will help us. We know Stanford wants the Honor
Code, but remember Men's and Women's Councils
alone cannot make it successful.
