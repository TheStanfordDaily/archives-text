# Last Lombard Film Scores Comedy Hit
## 
### 
TO BE OR NOT TO I lE." now
; playing at the Stanford in Palo
; Alto.
Laying an incredible comedy
I against the tragedy of Warsaw, and
giving Jack Benny and Carole Lom
bard semi-serious roles, might have
made "To Be or Not to Be" a fiasco.
But in the hands of Alexander Korda
it turns out a very original mixture
of satire and suspense, without the
bitterness or sentimentality of pic
tures like "The Great Dictator."
Benny, in his usual Jello program
form, teams up with Lombard and
the rest of the Lubinski troupe to
play fantastic pranks on the Gestapo
j in Poland. This provides some of
the subtlest jibes at Naziism and
some of the richest laugh material
I of the current cinema season. Covey
