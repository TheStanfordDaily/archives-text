## Students May Sign Up To Give Blood May 21 
### 
Nearly a gallon and a half of
Stanford blood left Palo Alto yes
terday nn the first lap of a long trip
that will bring it at last to wounded
men in ships' sick-bays and front
line dressing stations.

The occasion was the first visit of
the mobile unit of the Red Cross
Blood Donor Service to the Stanford
area. The Stanford men and women,
who each contributed a pint of blood,
were Football Coach Jim Lawson,
Assistant Coach Frankie Albert, Bas
ketball Co-Captains Bill Cowden
and Don Burness, A.S.S.U. President
George Jackson and Vice-President
Pat Adams, Robert Murphy, Helen
Kimball, Mike Churchill, and Bar
bara Sadler.
Reaching the Palo Alto Community
Center, the girls and fellows regis
tered and. after a somewhat nervous
wait, were led into the next room to
have their blood pressure, pulse,
temperature, and hemoglobin count
taken. Then they were escorted
into still another room.
DONORS NEEDLED
There was a long row of beds and
a cluster of doctors and nurses. The
donors, with some slight giggling
and cracking wise, were stretched
out, a needle inserted connecting
the subject to a bottle, and that's all
there was to it.
In about 20 minutes it was all
over, and the boys and girls streamed


Itll.l, COWDEN mihl Don Tlurness con tribute lo the lied Cross blood hank
into the next room and proceeded to
resuscitate themselves with dough
nuts and coffee. They signed the
record book, received their pins, and
were taken home.
The blood was taken to laborato
ries in Berkeley, where it will be
centrifuged to separate the plasma.
The plasma, dried and powdered, is
put up in kits with distilled water
and needle, and sent to the front.
It is then immediately available for
transfusion.
The plasma injections are of par
ticular value in cases of burn and
shell-shock. The American Red
Cross has set a goal of one million
pints of blood for the use of the
armed forces.
The mobile unit will visit Palo
Alto again on Thursday, May 21, and
every other week thereafter for 18
months. Between 20 and 30 Stanford
students will be able to donate blood
at each visit. Anyone over 18 may
sign up as a donor, but those under
21 must have a release from their
parents or guardians.
Students may sign up now for the
next visit of the Blood Donor Serv
ice in Room 13 in the Old Union.
Release blanks for those under 21
are available there.
The campus will be expected to
keep its quota filled in summer
quarter, according to the campus
Red Cross committee, and anyone
who will be here summer quarter
and wishes to donate blood should
call at Room 13, the Student War
Office.
