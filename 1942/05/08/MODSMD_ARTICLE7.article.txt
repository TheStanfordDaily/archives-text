SAN FRANCISCO, May 7 (UP).
â€”Representatives of two major rail
roads told an advisory committee of
the State Defense Council today that
State Guard troops were needed
urgently to protect their lines.
Both the Santa Fe and the West
ern Pacific Lines voices objections
to the raising of a private guard
force. Leo G. Sievert said the
Santa Fe road now employs 175
guards at an annual cost of $300,000.
