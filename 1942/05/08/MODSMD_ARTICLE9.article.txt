# Wilbur Tells Student's Part In War Effort
## 
### PEGGY BOOTHE 
"Intestinal fortitude" is the qual
ity that Stanford must demonstrate
in all its war-time activities," Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur declared
yesterday in concluding the war as
j scrnbly in the Memorial Hall at
i which Dr. Theodore Kreps and four
students also spoke.
"We must stand up as Stanford
| men and women for what is right
j and make others do the same," he
declared. "In any infraction of the
| Honor Code or any other fundamen
tal standard, we must tell violators
to cut it out."
Characterizing the University as a
receiving station for talented young
people, Dr. Wilbur stressed its re
sponsibility in training people
quickly for the job they are best fit
ted to do. He said that the Univer
sity has a peculiar responsibility in
this period of confusion and unpre
pa redness.
"Rather than leaping into a uni
form, young men would make a self
assay to determine where they can
Ido the most in the war effort.
Women are also essential, but they
do not seem to realize it as few have
indicated (hey are coming to school
this summer," he commented.
Dr. Wilbur said that the govern
ment is already using campus facili
ties and personnel for important war
projects. More than 80 members of
the faculty are now doing war
work, and it is a "battle" to keep
them here, according to the chan
cellor.
"We are used to hearing the word
'sacrifice,' but we'll have to make
many more of them, for this is a
long, long war with long, long prob
lems. The past policy of to little, too
late and talk too much, and too
early will have to be reversed," Dr.
Wilbur asserted.
WAR AT HOME
With the keynote that "those of
us at home can play as vital a part in
winning the war as the men at the
front," Dr. Kreps described exactly
how the studnt can lead the battle
against inflation and promote con
servation.
"There can be slackers at home afe
much as in the service; a hoarder is
one, for he tries to escape making a
sacrifice with everyone else," main
tained the professor of business
economics. "We deserve fascism if
we need a policeman for every
thing."
DEMOCRACY AS WEAPON
To be informed, to educate oth
ers, and to be active are the three
functions students can perform in
the war effort, he stated. The partici
pation of young people in community
war work is particularly needed, for
they have energy and a new out
look.
"Democracy is not defensive like
the Maginot Line; it is a weapon to
be used. By extending it upward,
downward and outward, we can as
sure a better post-war world,'

them here, according to the chan
cellor.
"We are used to hearing the word
'sacrifice,' but we'll have to make
many more of them, for this is a
long, long war with long, long prob
lems. The past policy of to little, too
late and talk too much, and too
early will have to be reversed," Dr.
Wilbur asserted.
WAR AT HOME
With the keynote that "those of
us at home can play as vital a part in
winning the war as the men at the
front," Dr. Kreps described exactly
how the studnt can lead the battle
against inflation and promote con
servation.
"There can be slackers at home afe
much as in the service; a hoarder is
one, for he tries to escape making a
sacrifice with everyone else," main
tained the professor of business
economics. "We deserve fascism if
we need a policeman for every
thing."
DEMOCRACY AS WEAPON
To be informed, to educate oth
ers, and to be active are the three
functions students can perform in
the war effort, he stated. The partici
pation of young people in community
war work is particularly needed, for
they have energy and a new out
look.
"Democracy is not defensive like
the Maginot Line; it is a weapon to
be used. By extending it upward,
downward and outward, we can as
sure a better post-war world,'
"Intestinal fortitude" is the qual
ity that Stanford must demonstrate
in all its war-time activities," Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur declared
yesterday in concluding the war as
j scrnbly in the Memorial Hall at
i which Dr. Theodore Kreps and four
students also spoke.
"We must stand up as Stanford
| men and women for what is right
j and make others do the same," he
declared. "In any infraction of the
| Honor Code or any other fundamen
tal standard, we must tell violators
to cut it out."
Characterizing the University as a
receiving station for talented young
people, Dr. Wilbur stressed its re
sponsibility in training people
quickly for the job they are best fit
ted to do. He said that the Univer
sity has a peculiar responsibility in
this period of confusion and unpre
pa redness.
"Rather than leaping into a uni
form, young men would make a self
assay to determine where they can
Ido the most in the war effort.
Women are also essential, but they
do not seem to realize it as few have
indicated (hey are coming to school
this summer," he commented.
Dr. Wilbur said that the govern
ment is already using campus facili
ties and personnel for important war
projects. More than 80 members of
the faculty are now doing war
work, and it is a "battle" to keep
them here, according to the chan
cellor.
