### PEGGY BOOTHE 
"Intestinal fortitude" is the qual
ity that Stanford must demonstrate
in all its war-time activities," Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur declared
yesterday in concluding the war as
j scrnbly in the Memorial Hall at
i which Dr. Theodore Kreps and four
students also spoke.
"We must stand up as Stanford
| men and women for what is right
j and make others do the same," he
declared. "In any infraction of the
| Honor Code or any other fundamen
tal standard, we must tell violators
to cut it out."
Characterizing the University as a
receiving station for talented young
people, Dr. Wilbur stressed its re
sponsibility in training people
quickly for the job they are best fit
ted to do. He said that the Univer
sity has a peculiar responsibility in
this period of confusion and unpre
pa redness.
"Rather than leaping into a uni
form, young men would make a self
assay to determine where they can
Ido the most in the war effort.
