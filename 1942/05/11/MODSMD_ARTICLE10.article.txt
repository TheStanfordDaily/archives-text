"The whole Junior Week-end was
a successâ€”a winner. I hope that ev

them, and that everyone was pleased.
It was lots of fun planning and ar

were satisfactory," declared Don Dil

With the Sunday Evening Sadler
movie, "The Lady Vanishes," the
first Junior Week-end came to a

the Junior Scrunch, Junior Water
Carnival, and the Junior Prom, with
the Show Boat Shuffle theme.

houses. These trophies, donated by
the junior, sophomore, and fresh
man classes, went to the organiza

score of the eleven events.

Approximately 250 couples at
tended the Junior Prom, and ac
claimed the rhythms of Ernie Lewis.
In a special program featuring his
quintet, Lewis dedicated a piece to
the dancers, calling it "Jumping at
the Junior Prom," which actually
did make the floors jump from the
tapping feet.
SCRUNCH ATTRACTS 175
George Flemming displayed his
trumpet skill when he played "I'm
Confessin'" and Curtis Lowe, on
saxophone, won acclaim with his nu
merous solos, especially his rendition
of "Body and Soul."
Aside from the hot numbers, the
band turned out plenty of what
Stanford calls music for dancing,
and did it well.
The Junior Scrunch, open only to
members of the Class of '43, started
the activities on Friday, and was at
tended by 175 persons. Dorothy
Paulman, Lagunita, and Ted Peder
son, Phi Psi, won free bids to the

games on the archery greens, movies
were shown in the Women's Gym.
