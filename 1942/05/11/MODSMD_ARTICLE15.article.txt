## Nippon Mechanized Force In Burma Drawn into Trap By Chinese, Yank Fliers 
### 
CHUNGKING, May 10 (UP). â€”A Japanese mech
anized force which stormed into China on the Burma
Road last Monday has been drawn into a trap and
destroyed by Chinese troops and American fliers in
a battle that left 4,50(1 Japanese dead and a scattered
remnant fleeing back toward the Burma border for
life, a military spokesman announced tonight.
The whole invading column "may now be consid
ered completely liquidated," the spokesman said.

The battle occurred near Chefang,
24 miles inside China. The Japa
nese were ambushed by Chinese ar
tillery set up alongside the Burma
Road at points where the invaders
were caught in deep gorges and on
difficult mountainsides. American
volunteer group fliers joined in the
kill, swooping down to within 50 feet
of the Jap motorized columns to
blast them with machine guns.
MAIN PART KILLED
The main part of the invading
force was killed. Those fleeing back
to Burma were threatened by an
other Chinese army moving north
east from Mandalay, which was re
ported to have been recaptured from
the Japanese along with Maymyo, 30
miles to the east. This army had
struck up from the Taunggyi sector,
100 miles southeast of Mandalay, in
forced marches and was driving
through Japanese communications
lines that had been too thinly ex
tended, front dispatches said.
The Japanese who drove into
Yunnan Province lacked reinforce
ments to hold their supply lines
open and after letting their spear
heads proceed some GO miles into
China, the Chinese closed in on them
from the sides and rear, according
to front dispatches.
Meanwhile, the Chinese force
moving up from Taunggyi, through
the ruins of Mandalay, where street
fighting was reported in progress
Sunday, raised a new threat to the
whole Japanese position in north
Burma. An offshoot of this force was
moving up from the Mandalay sec
tor toward the Burma border, 200
miles away, to intercept the Japa
nese fleeing back from Yunnan.
SO JAP TRUCKS WRECKED
American volunteer group fliers,
joining the battle in full force, blast
ed a column of 80 Japanese trucks
near the Salween River in Yunnan,
destroyed a grounded reconnaissance
plane, and poured withering bursts
of machine-gun and cannon fire
into the Japanese ranks.
In western Burma, British fliers,
according to a communique issued
in New Delhi, spread destruction
in the Japanese-held oil field area
yesterday. They struck at an air
drome where 18 bombers were
grounded, and two were destroyed,
two probably destroyed and five
damaged.
The communique said the air
drome was at Magwc, 150 miles
southwest of Mandalay. The RAF
airmen set fire to a large gasoline
dump and despite fierce anti-aircraft
fire, all returned safely to their
bases.
