GEN. MacARTHUR'S HEAD
QUARTERS, MELBOURNE, May 10
(UP). â€”Battered remnants of a Jap
anese fleet, turned back at the gates
of Australia, limped northward to
night to the uneasy shelter of Bis
marck Island bases, seeking escape
from the fury of American sea and
air forces which exacted a toll of
at least 19 enemy ships in the battle
of the Coral Sea.
Gen. Douglas Mac-Arthur's head
quarters announced that the battle,
which appeared on the basis of pre
liminary reports to have been the
most successful in United States na
val history, now was completely
ended.
Reports from advanced Allied
bases said that at least 500 planes
took part in the five-day aero-naval
battle, the crucial phase of which
was fought 450 miles off the coast
of northeast Australia.
