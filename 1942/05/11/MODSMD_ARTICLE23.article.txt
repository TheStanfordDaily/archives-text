# Army Bombers Carry Out Daring Daylight Attack On Japan, Report Reveals
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP).—Lifting a hitherto
impenetrable wall of official secrecy, the War Depart
ment disclosed tonight (hat last month's history-shat
tering raids on Tokyo and other Jap cities were car
ried out hy U.S Army bombers which struck out of
a clear, noon sky to start great fires among vital
military objectives.
It was the first official confirmation by this govern
ment of the raids which occurred April 18 and which

f heretofore had been described in
detail only by the Japanese them
selves —mostly in frantic attempts to
learn from whence the planes
struck.
! "The selected targets were unmis
j takable and were accurately at
i tacked," the communique said.
"Military, naval and industrial
plants were the objectives in the
vicinity of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nago
ya and other localities. Large fires
■ were started which continued to
burn in some instances for at least
I two days."
BASKS UNKNOWN
The communique .still left unan
! swered the question the Japanese
i would most like to have answered,
■ since it carefully avoided any ref
i erence as to bases from which the
attacks were carried out.
Likewise, it gave no indication as
! to the number of planes taking part,
or the U.S. losses, if any.
But the daring nature of the raids
and the war department's quiet sat
isfaction over its success—not only
for the military damage inflicted but
for the blow to Japanese morale as
well — were clearly evident in the
communique's description of the at
tack.
"The attack was made in clear
weather in the middle of the day,
the planes flying at low altitudes—so
I low that it was necessary to avoid
| barrage balloons," it said.
DESCRIBES JAP REACTION
The greatest portion of the com
munique was given over to a de
scription of the Japanese own re
action to the attack.
It told how, even as the U.S.
bombers were roaring toward their
objectives the Tokyo radio announc
er was detailing the pleasures of
life in Japan and the freedom from
the fear of bombing.
Suddenly the broadcast, which had
been in the English language, was
cut off and an announcement came
in Japanese that Tokyo was being
bombed.
The announcer said that a great
number of planes were flying low at
terrific speed over the city and
added that they were flying too fast
to be overtaken.
DETAILS OMITTED
While the War Department com
munique omitted many details of
the attack, it appeared that the
bombers had struck their heaviest
blows over an area of some 400
miles, ranging from Tokyo and Yo
kohama in the north to Kobe some
375 miles to the south. In between
Tokyo and Kobe, the great, airplane
center of Jagoya also was struck.
Observers believed that the great -
| est. opportunity for fires existed
among the flimsy, wood-and-paper
! constructed residences of Nagoya
and Kobe. Great fires also were pos
sible in Tokyo and Yokohama but
these cities have been modernized
| and many of their streets widened so
the flames would not be so hard to
control. #
These were among the possible
j objectives of the raiders:
Tokyo—General staff headquar
tors, staff college, numerous bar
racks, large powder plants, steel
works, engineering works, a few air
plane factories (especially in the
northwest suburbs), railway-junc
tions (especially for lines connecting
northeast Japan with the southwest),
water works, power stations.
Nagoya—Mitsubishi and Aichi air
plane works, the largest in Japan.
Yokohama — Mitsubishi shipyards,
gasoline refineries, Ford plant, elec
trical equipment factories, ware
houses and the Yokusuka naval base
about 12 miles to the south of the
city proper.
Kobe- Kawasaki shipyards (turn
ing out warships), rubber plants,
docks, warehouses, railway line
linking Osaka-Kobe industrial area
with Inland Sea naval base of Kure.

DESCRIBES JAP REACTION
The greatest portion of the com
munique was given over to a de
scription of the Japanese own re
action to the attack.
It told how, even as the U.S.
bombers were roaring toward their
objectives the Tokyo radio announc
er was detailing the pleasures of
life in Japan and the freedom from
the fear of bombing.
Suddenly the broadcast, which had
been in the English language, was
cut off and an announcement came
in Japanese that Tokyo was being
bombed.
The announcer said that a great
number of planes were flying low at
terrific speed over the city and
added that they were flying too fast
to be overtaken.
DETAILS OMITTED
While the War Department com
munique omitted many details of
the attack, it appeared that the
bombers had struck their heaviest
blows over an area of some 400
miles, ranging from Tokyo and Yo
kohama in the north to Kobe some
375 miles to the south. In between
Tokyo and Kobe, the great, airplane
center of Jagoya also was struck.
Observers believed that the great -

among the flimsy, wood-and-paper
! constructed residences of Nagoya
and Kobe. Great fires also were pos
sible in Tokyo and Yokohama but
these cities have been modernized
| and many of their streets widened so
the flames would not be so hard to
control. #
These were among the possible
j objectives of the raiders:
Tokyo—General staff headquar
tors, staff college, numerous bar
racks, large powder plants, steel
works, engineering works, a few air
plane factories (especially in the
northwest suburbs), railway-junc
tions (especially for lines connecting
northeast Japan with the southwest),
water works, power stations.
Nagoya—Mitsubishi and Aichi air
plane works, the largest in Japan.
Yokohama — Mitsubishi shipyards,
gasoline refineries, Ford plant, elec
trical equipment factories, ware
houses and the Yokusuka naval base
about 12 miles to the south of the
city proper.
Kobe- Kawasaki shipyards (turn
ing out warships), rubber plants,
docks, warehouses, railway line
linking Osaka-Kobe industrial area
with Inland Sea naval base of Kure.
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP).—Lifting a hitherto
impenetrable wall of official secrecy, the War Depart
ment disclosed tonight (hat last month's history-shat
tering raids on Tokyo and other Jap cities were car
ried out hy U.S Army bombers which struck out of
a clear, noon sky to start great fires among vital
military objectives.
It was the first official confirmation by this govern
ment of the raids which occurred April 18 and which

f heretofore had been described in
detail only by the Japanese them
selves —mostly in frantic attempts to
learn from whence the planes
struck.
! "The selected targets were unmis
j takable and were accurately at
i tacked," the communique said.
"Military, naval and industrial
plants were the objectives in the
vicinity of Tokyo, Yokohama, Nago
ya and other localities. Large fires
■ were started which continued to
burn in some instances for at least
I two days."
