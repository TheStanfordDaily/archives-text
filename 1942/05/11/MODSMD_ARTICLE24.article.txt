## Churchill Threatens R.A.F. Retaliation; Praises Allied Spirit 
### 
LONDON, May 10 (UP).—Prime
Minister Churchill warned in a radio
speech tonight that if Germany uses
poison gas against Russia the R.A.F.
will use its "great and growing air
superiority in the west to carry gas
warfare on the largest possible scale
far and wide against military objec
tives in Germany."
Less than 24 hours after llie ofti
cial Soviet news agency, Tass, had
charged in a dispatch from Krasno
dar, in the northern Caucasus, that
the Germans were using poison gas
mines in the Crimea, Churchill
warned that Britain was ready to
wage gas war on a formidable scale,
lie said Britain would consider any
use of gas against ils Russian ally
"exactly as if it were used against
ourselves."
HITLER MUST CHOOSE
While declaring that Britain will
not initiate gas warfare, and that it
is thus for Hitler to choose, he an
nounced that Russia has notified
Britain it fears the Germans will
turn to use of gas in desperation.
Reviewing the war on the second
anniversary of his rise to the pre
miership, Churchill said that it was
now certain that more Germans have
been killed on the Russian front than
were killed on all fronts throughout
the entire World War.
(German World War fatalities to
taled 1,773,000, and total German
casualties, including wounded and
missing, were 7,142,558.)
BOMBINGS TO INCREASE
lie threatened Germany in any
event with a ceaseless, ever-growing
assault from the air, which he said
would presently be joined by United
States bombers. He said the R.A.F.
has a list of German industrial cities
and "we will continue to bomb
them." Civilians, he said, have an
easy escape. They must leave, and
watch their homes and cities burn
from a distance.
He brought up the subject of a
second front, as a means of aiding
Russia, but he said, "Naturally I
shall not disclose what our inten
tions are." However, he praised the
fighting spirit of persons arguing for
a second front.

HITLER MUST CHOOSE
While declaring that Britain will
not initiate gas warfare, and that it
is thus for Hitler to choose, he an
nounced that Russia has notified
Britain it fears the Germans will
turn to use of gas in desperation.
Reviewing the war on the second
anniversary of his rise to the pre
miership, Churchill said that it was
now certain that more Germans have
been killed on the Russian front than
were killed on all fronts throughout
the entire World War.
(German World War fatalities to
taled 1,773,000, and total German
casualties, including wounded and
missing, were 7,142,558.)
BOMBINGS TO INCREASE
lie threatened Germany in any
event with a ceaseless, ever-growing
assault from the air, which he said
would presently be joined by United
States bombers. He said the R.A.F.
has a list of German industrial cities
and "we will continue to bomb
them." Civilians, he said, have an
easy escape. They must leave, and
watch their homes and cities burn
from a distance.
He brought up the subject of a
second front, as a means of aiding
Russia, but he said, "Naturally I
shall not disclose what our inten
tions are." However, he praised the
fighting spirit of persons arguing for
a second front.
LONDON, May 10 (UP).—Prime
Minister Churchill warned in a radio
speech tonight that if Germany uses
poison gas against Russia the R.A.F.
will use its "great and growing air
superiority in the west to carry gas
warfare on the largest possible scale
far and wide against military objec
tives in Germany."
Less than 24 hours after llie ofti
cial Soviet news agency, Tass, had
charged in a dispatch from Krasno
dar, in the northern Caucasus, that
the Germans were using poison gas
mines in the Crimea, Churchill
warned that Britain was ready to
wage gas war on a formidable scale,
lie said Britain would consider any
use of gas against ils Russian ally
"exactly as if it were used against
ourselves."
