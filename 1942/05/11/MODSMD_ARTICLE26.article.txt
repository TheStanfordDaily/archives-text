# Fischer Asks Post-War International Economic Planning, Customs Union
## America Must Not Erect Tariff Walls and Thus Repeat the Mistake Which Helped Raise Hitler to Power 
### LOUIS FISCHER 
(Editor's Note: This is the last of a series of articles on the next
peace from the hook "Dawn of Victory" hy Louis Fischer.)

Peace will find Europe and Asia flat on their backs. This is a very de
structive war. When the guns are silenced, foreign nations will lack the
raw materials, capital, machinery, the faith, and perhaps even the engi
neering skill and manpower to reconstruct their territories.

America will have to make a ma
jor contribution towards rebuilding
them. Who will pay America? For
a long time—nobody. But it will
cost America less to rebuild Europe
for nothing than to finance our worst
business depression if we did not
rebuild Europe and instead closed
our factories and sent home our
workingmen.
This war need not be followed by
the slump which usually follows a
war. On the contrary, the war
could be succeeded by an era of
great prosperity in America. We
could quickly reconvert our industry
to civilian purposes, and after satis
fying real domestic needs, export the
large quantities of goods which the
devastated countries will require
for their restoration.
OUR TARIFF
Inevitably, the Europeans must
say to America—What about your
own tariff? "Our high tariff," said
Sumner Welles, Under-Secretary of
Slate of the United States, on Octo
ber 8, 1941, "reached out to virtually
every corner of the earth and
brought poverty and despair to in
numerable communities. . . . The re
sultant misery, bewilderment and
resentment, together with equally
pernicious contributing causes, pav
ed the way for the rise of the very
dictatorships which have plunged
the entire world into war." No in
formed person will dispute this state
ment. The American high tariff and
America's business depression which
began in 1929 had more to do with
Ihe coming of Hitler than the Ver
sailles Treaty or any innate perver
sion of German character. America
is so powerful and wealthy that
what happens in Washington, New
York, and Chicago reverberates in
every distant land.
DO WE PARTICIPATE?
Is the United States prepared to
drastically lower or entirely cancel
its tariff? If not, our participation in
world peace will be abortive. This is
no longer only a question of domes
tic politics. The fate of the earlh
and the to be or not to be of the
third world war depend on it.
Real democracies would find a way
of preventing wars. Real democra
cies would be immune to the pres
sure of special interests and special
lobbies. This war was made by
open-eyed brown, black and red dic
tatorships and by blind colorless
conservatives. There is just one
peaceway that has not been tried:
democracy.
DEMOCRACY
The United Stales, Great Britain,
France and other countries have had
a considerable measure of democ
racy. But French Foreign Minister
Bonnet was much closer to the Two
Hundred Families than to the mil
lions of peasants and workers. Ne
ville Chamberlain was first of all a
Birmingham business man. French
big business and French banks were
able to kill the reforms of the Popu

lar Front which was a mild New
Deal and, too, to retard rearmament.
Even such incomplete democracy is
better far than any dictatorship.
But that kind of democracy is not
good enough and not effective
enough in stopping wars. In the
last analysis, an international free
trade customs union, international
economic planning and world organ
ization for peace depend on how
much direct influence the people ex
ercise over governments and how
much direct and indirect influence
the conservative business interests
exercise over governments.
Many forces will resist customs
unions and planning and the do
mestic changes they will make nec
essary. We must see to it that be
fore the war is over every person
who may have a hand in shaping the
peace and thus shaping our future
life will be a convinced, enthusiastic
democrat, free from any mental res
ervations about real democracy and
free from any ties except those that
bind him to the welfare of the na
tion as a whole. We must see to
that now. In time of war prepare
for peace.
