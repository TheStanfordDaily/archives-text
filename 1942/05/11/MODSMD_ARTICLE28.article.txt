The Army has announced that it
hopes to defer these men as long as
possible, but, if they are called to
service before graduation, they will
be appointed Aviation Cadets and
given the opportunity to compete
for commissions in the Air Force
Reserve.
Students whose courses of study
give them the special instruction nec

to qualify as officers.
Meanwhile, the Navy has an
nounced the reopening of the Naval
Reserve V-7 class. College juniors
and seniors may enlist in V-7 and
will be allowed to complete college.
After college, they will receive four
months training and then will be
commissioned as ensigns and as
signed to active duty.
