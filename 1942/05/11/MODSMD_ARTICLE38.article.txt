|F THE DAILY HANDICAPPER doesn't quit missing his track calcula
tions by two-thirds of a point we'll have to remove him from office.
This inefficiency is unexcusable, but we'll give him one more chance
in the Fresno Relays. Along the same line The Turfman, another Daily
prognosticator, picked Requested to win the Preakness. Requested, at 13-1,
was doin;< that self-same "cakewalk to the wire" when Alsab, the Turf
man's second choice, nipped him at the finish. Picking the first two nags
in reverse order is better than no picking at all.

TMiE RECENT addition of Dr. Craig Taylor's physical fitness tests to the
intramural program means that all of the men's living groups will
have to start building up their whole personnel, since those chosen to rep
resent them in competition will be picked at random and therefore won't
necessarily be the few picked Charles Atlases of the club.
Although all of the details of the tests are not yet released, that tread-

mill over in the physiology depart
ment will play no small part in the
tests.
Undoubtedly the Daily, if they
can find time, will enter a strong
team. Speaking of the Daily's in
tramural efforts, the last soft ball
game with El Campo would have
been in the bag had it not been for
three sensational running catches by
Warren "Davy" Berl in the expanses
behind second base.
RUMOR that Hirohito will
play intramural ball for the
Daily next year is absolutely out
of the question due to transportation
difficulties. Anyway, even though he
can field pretty well, due to his bad
eyes he's a weak sticker. I hear
that Goering is a slugger.
Printed adjacent to this is a
mug of Hirohito. If you. like me,
got up this mornig feeling no-so
sharp, it might do you a world of
good to give Hi to the bronx cheer.
Go ahead, but don't get the paper
wet.

/ *APTAIN R. R. Ranzoni's Indian
4 poloists are chalking up a very

enviable record in competition this spring. Their second victory over the
107 th Cavalry from Fort Ord over the week-end definitely establishes them
as the best team in this region.
Washington Husky Johnny Long recently set a world record for the
281-yard dash in practice. Long, usually a quarter-miler, ran the dis
tance in 29.2 seconds. This is the first time the distance has ever been
run. fie may try for the 326 next week.
Swimming Coach Ernie Brandsten should take notice of this boy Em
mett Cashin who took the men's free in Saturday's Water Carnival.
He looks like a comer.
