# Wise Up, Frosh!
## 
### 
YOU'D think that by the time a man gets to
college he would have a little common
sense and think of the other fellow before
making him the victim of a malicious prank.
But it seems that several men of the Class
of '45 have not yet matured to the realization that
before long they will have to assume responsi
bilities and take care of themselves. When a
person throws bottles out of a window onto one
of the streets on the campus, he
shows a certain sign of lack of adjustment.
Even though those who are guilty of throwing
the bottles probably didn't realize it, they
were actually endangering lives. There might
have been someone walking along the sidewalk
when one of those objects came crashing
through the air, or a bottle might have hit the
windshield of a moving car and caused the
driver to crash.
So far, nothing so drastic as this has hap
pened, but it is not beyond the realm of possi
bility. And whether or not any visible imme
diate damage was caused, certainly many car
owners are wondering today why they have
flat tires.
Think twice next time, frosh, before you
throw breakables out of your windows. It
wouldn't be a bad idea to put yourself in the
place of the person whose tires you ruined the
other day. Give the bottles to your salvage
collector, and if you don't know who he is,
find out.â€”John Horrall
