# Those Were the Days
## 
### 
WHEN the sun comes blazing over the east
ern foothills early in the morning, when
the swallows dive-bomb unsuspecting strollers
in the Quad, when the sound of happy swim
mers echoes from Lake Lagunita in the after
noons, when the moon sneaks up in the early
twilight to cast eerie shadows through the
palms, that's Stanford in the spring!
When everyone adorns "hick" costumes for
the Back to the Farm Day, when strains of soft
music resound up and down the Row, when
everyone goes for a ride in the country, when
nobody cares about the Libe or books, when
men discard heavy sweaters for light T-shirts,
that was Stanford last spring.
But, when the sun makes a feeble attempt to
pierce the clouds about 10 a.m., when the
swallows fly to cover in their nests on the
Quad, when goose-pimpled swimmers shun the
icy waters of our own Lake Louise, when no
one is quite sure whether or not there's a full
moon, that hits home this quarter.
When the rain chases people to cover in May,
when the cold blasts of wind discourage shirt
sleeves, when everyone runs to the Libe to get
in an hour's studying, when bicycle rides to
Paly are big events, when the Sunday evening
movies are better attended than Sunday dates
in the City, that's Stanford this spring!â€” John
