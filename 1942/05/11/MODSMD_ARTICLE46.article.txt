### AMIE REICHERT 
r PIIE last few weeks have witnessed the complete
abandonment of appeasement by the U.S. State
Department, and it is about time. There have been
all sorts of appeasers and appeasement policies in the
course of the second World War. The appeasement
of Britain and France is of one kind, and the appease
ment of Russia is another kind, and the appeasement
of the U.S. is still another kind. I am not sure exactly
what kind ours has been. Certainly its final outcome
is the same as the other two—the abandonment of
compromise and the adoption of force.
Britain and France appeased Hitler because they
had nourished him for years as the potential scourge
of Bolshevism and up until the attack on Poland they
did not realize that he was the enemy of democi'acy
as well-as of Communism. Then it was too late. They
had appeased and appeased and they were not pre
pared to fight but they had to. The fall of France and
the defeat at Dunkirk, Greece and Crete were the re
sults. With Russia it was a different story. Russia
appeased only when it became apparent to her that the
western democracies were shilly-shallying, that they
did not intend to fight if they could possibly use Rus
sia for their cat's paw. Russia's appeasement meant
time, precious time in which to arm and prepare for
the great struggle with Hitler which Stalin knew must
inevitably come. The result was the magnificent re
sistance of the Red Army.

r I" , HE appeasement of the U.S. is another matter. We
have appeased Vichyfrance for two years now,
and until the history of World War II is written at
some later date, until the whole story is told, it will
be very hard to understand why. Why this appease
ment? Why did we not break off relations with Pe
tain the moment it became obvious that his regime was
a puppet government to Hitler? Why did we not seize
Dakar and Martinique and the other strategic French
possessions?
To be sure, to have done these things before Pearl
Harbor would have raised a tremendous furor through
out the U.S. from the isolationist camp—but then the
Atnerica First and Hearst and Patterson and McCor
mick and the rest of them didn't exactly simmer in
silence when we occupied Iceland and passed the
conscription bill and amended the Neutrality Act and
started shooting back at German U-boats in the At
lantic—and that was all before Pearl Harbor.
Nevertheless our State Department hesitated before
war actually came to do anything to break the peace
that was not a peace we held with Hitlex - 's Vichyfrance.
And after Pearl Harbor there was no apparent
change in our policies though statesment and com
mentators howled for the occupation of Dakar and
Madagascar. Still we did not move. Not until the
elventh hour did we move in conjunction with our
allies. Not until Laval became dictator of Fascist
France did we make the break.

Surely it cannot be that the State Depart
ment did not realize which way the wind was
blowing long before Pierre Laval was actually named
head of Hitler's France. The whole story is, of course,
not known, we are still too close to it. But it would
appear that the State Department played the appease
ment game up until the last hour in order to prevent
the French fleet from falling into the hands of the
Nazis. It would appear that Hull played the appease
ment game up until the last minute, up until the min
ute he became sure that Vichyfrance could not remain
neutral in this conflict. Many people were sure of this
long, long ago.
Perhaps we have not lost too much by the bargain.
Perhaps we have. It is too soon to tell. It does not look
as though our appeasement policy gained us a thing in
point of actual military accomplishment. France is in
the war and it looks as though the French fleet will
be in it too. We are now beginning to make up for
lost time. We have abandoned appeasement, sanc
tioned and probably aided the British seizure of Mada
gascar, and yesterday we sent what amounts to an
ultimatum to Martinique. There is still the matter of
Dakar to be settled. Whether we will have to fight
for Martinique—which is doubtful—and how much we
will have to fight for Dakar—for it is almost certain
that we will have to fight for it—will write the closing
chapters to U.S. appeasement of Vichyfrance.
