PROPAGANDA
T>ROPAGANDA is a fine word these days. It can
mean everything from the blackest lies to the pur
est truths.
Saturday night I listened to the last of a series of
13 "propaganda programs" sponsored by the major net
works. For the past 13 weeks these broadcasts have
presented the true and ugly facts about the present
conflict.
They called the series "This Is War" and pulled no
punches, glossed no facts.
These were not always pleasant programs to listen
to. Realism has heretofore never been closely asso
ciated with Saturday night. That has always been the
night to go out and enjoy oneself.
Unfortunately war does not stop for Saturday night.
That is one of the points that these programs wanted
to get across.
People have accused these broadcasts of stirring
up hate. If somebody is at your throat anxious to
kill you, and if you can fight better with hate in your
mind, then you are a fool not to stir up all the hatred
you can muster.
Know your enemy is another of their themes. May
be there are some Japs that will turn and run if you
look them in the eye and say boo; maybe there are
some Germans who hate to fight and would rather
drink beer all day; if so, they are not fighting in this
war.
Yes, they were good programs. True, unadorned
facts, that it would hurt no one to know, made them fit
for Phi Bete and pool-room tender alike.
* * * *
I^VERY so often the students here come up for criti
cism of their administration of the honor code. It
is said time and again that if they will not report vio
lators then the system must fail.
I hope this is not the case. Bear in mind that dur
ing grammar and high school pupils are subject to a
most effective propaganda directed against the
"squealer."
I do not mean that anyone who reports on an honor
code violation is a squealer. What I do mean is that
in everyone's mind is this long conditioning against
squealing, to such an extent that it is difficult and
impossible to overcome it.
No matter how much you tell a student that he is
not being a squealer, no matter how much you ask
him to report violations, you will always be up against
years of conditioning in his most formative period of
life which have taught him to keep it to himself.
If the honor code is not a success, and I for one
believe it is a success, the remedy must be looked for
elsewhere than in the individual's action.
others, though not financial masterpieces,
were good stunts for other organizations to
take into consideration as examples tor simi
lar "home" entertainment.

People have accused these broadcasts of stirring
up hate. If somebody is at your throat anxious to
kill you, and if you can fight better with hate in your
mind, then you are a fool not to stir up all the hatred
you can muster.
Know your enemy is another of their themes. May
be there are some Japs that will turn and run if you
look them in the eye and say boo; maybe there are
some Germans who hate to fight and would rather
drink beer all day; if so, they are not fighting in this
war.
Yes, they were good programs. True, unadorned
facts, that it would hurt no one to know, made them fit
for Phi Bete and pool-room tender alike.

I^VERY so often the students here come up for criti
cism of their administration of the honor code. It
is said time and again that if they will not report vio
lators then the system must fail.
I hope this is not the case. Bear in mind that dur
ing grammar and high school pupils are subject to a
most effective propaganda directed against the
"squealer."
I do not mean that anyone who reports on an honor
code violation is a squealer. What I do mean is that
in everyone's mind is this long conditioning against
squealing, to such an extent that it is difficult and
impossible to overcome it.
No matter how much you tell a student that he is
not being a squealer, no matter how much you ask
him to report violations, you will always be up against
years of conditioning in his most formative period of
life which have taught him to keep it to himself.
If the honor code is not a success, and I for one
believe it is a success, the remedy must be looked for
elsewhere than in the individual's action.

Saturday night I listened to the last of a series of
13 "propaganda programs" sponsored by the major net
works. For the past 13 weeks these broadcasts have
presented the true and ugly facts about the present
conflict.
They called the series "This Is War" and pulled no
punches, glossed no facts.
These were not always pleasant programs to listen
to. Realism has heretofore never been closely asso
ciated with Saturday night. That has always been the
night to go out and enjoy oneself.
Unfortunately war does not stop for Saturday night.
That is one of the points that these programs wanted
to get across.
