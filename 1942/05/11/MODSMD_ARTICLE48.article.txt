# 'Stevie' Tells Of A.S.S.U. Office of '24

The good old days . . . when the
A.S.S.U. office was a pool room, when
the Union Club was for men only,
when three was a crowd in the Cel
lar (same coffee).
That was Stanford 17 years ago
when Miss Inez Stevens, better
known as "Stevie" joined the office
staff of the Students' Organizations
Fund, also better known as the
A.S.S.U. office.
"When I started working for Stan
ford in 1924, the A.S.S.U. office was
hidden away on the second floor of
the Administration Building and its
organization was pretty small com
pared to what we have today,"
Stevie remarked with a knowing
smile.
HUGE NOW
"Sot i;:l activities in those days
weren't the super-productions they
are now. It wasn't often that we
cleared through a $1500 check for a
big-name orchestra for a Stanford
dance. Maybe the ratio had some
thing to do with it," she added.
The A.S.S.U. office today is a huge
clearing house for the accounts car
ried by the various student organi
zations, according to Miss Stevens.
Each university dormitory and cam
pus organization, with the exception
of Sequoia, has a fund which is held
by this office. When a group wishes
to expend some money for a social
activity or improvement, it peti
tions to the A.S.S.U. office and the
amount (if approved) is paid from
the group's fund.
"Each class also has a fund which
is started when it enters. Only dur
ing the freshman year are students
obliged to contribute to it and what
is collected is carried through for
the rest of the three years," Miss
Stevens related.
FUND INCREASES
"Every year that fund is increased
by the various class functions such
as the Sophomore Carnival, the
Junior Prom, and the Senior pro
grams and announcements sale.
What is left of each class fund at
the end of four years is either do
nated to the school or used to pur
chase some addition to the campus,"
she continued.
Last year the senior class donated
$1,905 to the university's scholar
ship fund according to reports issued
from the office.
The A.S.S.U. office today is a far
cry from the little place that handled
the student organizations' funds in
1919 when it was started, agreed the
office staff.
A hundred and sixty thousand
dollars is big business, and that was
the amount deposited in the fund
last year and handled through the
A.S.S.U. under the supervision of
Dr. J. P. Mitchell, general manager,
and Dick Stepp, student manager.
