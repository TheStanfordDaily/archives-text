### 
LONDON, May 10 (UP).â€”R.A.F.
formations 15 miles wide pounded
and seared German objectives in
land from the Boulogne area of the
French coast this afternoon in one
of the war's heaviest daylight raids.
German planes appeared about the
same time over Northern Ireland,
where United States forces arc sta
tioned.
Ground defenses went into action,
but no incidents were reported, the
R.A.F. headquarters in Northern
Ireland said in a communique.
(Reports reaching Vichy said that
the R.A.F. heavily bombed objec
tives in northern France Sunday
morning and that more British
bombers were used in these raids
than in any previous attack.)
