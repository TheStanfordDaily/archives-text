### 
WASHINGTON, May 10 (UP). â€”
The gigantic task of clamping a roof
on the cost of living begins at mid
night tonight with the pegging for
the duration of prices which may be
charged by wholesalers and manu
facturers.
Beginning at 12:01 a.m. Monday
and until normal conditions return,
none of thousands of commodities
and services offered by any pro
ducer, wholesaler or manufacturer
may be sold at prices exceeding the
highest charged during March,
1942.
The price ceilings will be extended
to the retail field on the following
Monday, May 18.
