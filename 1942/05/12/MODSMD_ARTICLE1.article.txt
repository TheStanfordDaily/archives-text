# Stanford Women Reject Blanket 1:30 Late Leaves, May Favor Modification
## Women's Conference Plan to Allow 1:30's for 2:30's Rejected by 3 to 1 Vote; 11 Living Groups Favor Change 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Stanford women last night categorically rejected a Women's Confer
ence plan that all 2:30 late leaves he changed to l:3o's, but at the same
time indicated a strong willingness to see the present late-leave set-up
considerably modified at least for the duration of the war.
Actual count disclosed that 601 women were against the plan as pre-

sented to them last night at house
meetings, and 206 were for it.
11 OUT OF 2.1
However, according to Irma Jean
Hannibal, president of Women's
Conference, 11 of the 23 women's
living groups would be willing to
see l:3o's take the place of most
2:3o's, "if some provision were
made for a few floating 2:3o's during
each quarter."
"I think the whole subject was
brought up prematurely," Miss Han
nibal said last night. "They haven't
had time to see the situation in its
whole scope."
CONFERENCE CO MM ITTEE
Miss Hannibal explained that Con
ference will probably set up a com
mittee to study and report upon the
compromise suggestions made last
night.
"The fact that so many were for
the suggestion makes the detailed
study necessary," she declared. "If
the vote had been overwhelmingly
negative without the compromise
suggestions, we should of course
have dropped the whole matter.
A break-down of the vote by liv
ing groups follows:
For Against
Casa Adelplia 6 27
Casa Eucalypto 24 20
Casa Granada 13 12
Casa Magnolia 0 53
Casa Naranja 5 25

Casa Ventura 4 42
Union 1 40

Tri-Delt IS (i
Delta Gamma 20 0
Gamma Phi 2 22
Thcta 27 0
Kappa 1 27
Pi Phi 3 10
Koblc 30 147
Among the groups which indicated
either by vote or statement that their
opinion on the subject would be
"radically different" if some provision
were made for floating 2:3o's or 2:3o's
on Saturday night were: Roble, Na
ranja, Hawthorne, The Oaks, Kappa,
and Manzanita.
Two groups suggested that the
new system be limited to the lower
division women . They were Casa
Eucalypto and Gamma Phi.
TELEPHONE INTERVIEWS
In telephone interviews last night
the opinion of both the pro and con
voters was revealed.
Ma reel la Mahoney. Kappa: "I
think the house felt the plan indi
cated the women are not old enough
to make their own decisions."
Mary Lou Linsley, Lagunita: "I
think it's silly at this point. I don't
think l:3o's will help our health, and
I think the boys will stay out any
way by themselves."
TIIETAS FOR IT
Joan Litchfield, Thcta: "There
wasn't any dissension at all here.
We were all for it."
Sylvia Berry, Alpha Phi: "I voted
for it from the health standpoint. I
think the 2:3o's ask too much of
human nature. I agree with Dr.
Wilbur that the "norm in wartime
is a different norm."
