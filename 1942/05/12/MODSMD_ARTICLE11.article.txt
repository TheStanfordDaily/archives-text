# Spring Show Goes Moderne
## Levitt Recreates Movie Atmosphere 
### 
Stylization and general fun-poking
at Hollywood and Los Angeles will
keynote the sets for this Friday and
Saturday nights' Spring Show, "A
Sale of Two Cities," according to Hal
Levitt, one of the three technical
directors.
"The only thing I can say about
the set showing the entrance to
Grauman's Caucasian Theater," Lev
itt said yesterday, "is that it's Cau
casianâ€”whatever that is."
Sets for the show are predomi
nately painted backdrops and in
clude the entrance to the Ambassa
dor Hotel, a map of the United
States, and the Los Angeles City
Hall, inside and out.
Easiest and biggest set, Levitt said,
is the M.G.M. sound stage, which
will simply be the Memorial Hall
stage cluttered with every piece of
equipment the theater has lying
around.
Working with Levitt on the tech
nical direction of the show are Paul
Hostetler and Art Hansen.
Tickets for both performances will
be on sale this afternoon and to
morrow in the Cellar, and Thursday
and Friday from 9 to 5 in the
A.SS.U. office. Prices range from 35
cents to $1.10.
