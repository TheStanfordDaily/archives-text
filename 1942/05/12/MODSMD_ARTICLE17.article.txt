# Thousands of Japanese Invasion Troops Lost; Battle May Be Renewed
## Little Malta Smashes Huge Nazi Attack 
### United Press 
MALTA, Britain's tiny island
stronghold 60 miles off the Italian
coast, reported the greatest victory
of its long and hitter air siege Mon
dayâ€”lol German and Italian planes
destroyed or damaged in three days,
including 63 on Sunday when newly
arrived Spitfire fighter planes caught
the raiders by surprise.
The Spitfire reinforcements, back
ing up the world's greatest concen
tration of anti-aircraft, guns, turned
the tide of battle, at least momen
tarily, as the 270,000 soldiers and
civilians who have held out on a 95-
square-mile island, under incessant
air attack since December, saw the
raiders met on even terms for the
first time.
Dispatches from Valletta said
there was a Spitfire on the tail of
every Axis plane during 72 hours of
bedlam and that they strewed the
Mediterranean with enemy wrecks.
NAZIS ON MARCH
Meanwhile, the first units of an
impending major German offensive
in Russia began cropping out in So
viet war dispatches. A communique
broadcast from Moscow said the Ger
mans have begun an offensive at the
eastern end of Crimea, lying across
the narrow Kerchenski Strait from
the Caucasus, whose oil lands are
believed to be Hitler's next big goal.
Russian troops were said to be fight
ing stubbornly there.
Intensified German activity also
was reported around Leningrad, the
old Czarist capital, where campfires
from the German siege lines can be
seen from the streets. Russian com
mentators believed the Germans
were preparing a "final assault" on
the city after having been held in
the suburbs since September.
RA F. INTERRUPTED
The R.A.F.'s long-range bombing
offensive was interrupted Monday
by bad weather but fighter planes
swept the French coast south of
Boulogne again, and Monday night
there was heavy gunfire along the
French coast, where the Germans
are reported to have installed new
batteries as a precaution against Al
lied invasion. London dispatches
said English coast watchers could
sec the shells explode but their tar
get was not disclosed.
