### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP). — I
The United States will pursue its '
own aims to make certain the stra- |
tegic French Caribbean island of j
Martinique does not fall afoul of the j
Axis — whether French Chief of
Government Pierre Laval likes it or
not, observers believed tonight.
This view was put forth after
French Ambassador Gaston Henry- j
Haye, at Laval's orders, asked Sec- 1
j retary of State Cordell Hull for in- j
| formation about negotiations be- j
j tween this country and Admiral
| Georges Robert, Vichy-appointed
overseer of French western hemi
sphere possessions.
