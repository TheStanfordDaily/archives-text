# Entry Deadline For All-U Sing Falls on May 19
## Graduate Division Added to Competition For Vocal Awards 
### 
Next Tuesday is the final day on
which groups may enter the All-
University Sing scheduled for May
21 in the Frost Amphitheater, ac
cording to Pi Thornton, Rally Com
mittee chairman. The first sing was
held last year before a crowd of
thousands.
A graduate division has been
added to the competition, so that
entries can be made either in the
graduate or undergraduate contests.
Entries are to be made at the
A.S.S.U. office upon payment of a $1
fee.
To avoid any repetition, repre
sentatives must give the name of the
selection their group plans to sing,
and the first one to sign up will pre
sent that piece exclusively. Only
one verse and one chorus may be
sung.
Each singing group is to have a
minimum of 15 members. While
freshmen are required to sing with
their living groups, transfers not
living in their houses may compete
for them.
The trophies, won last year by the
Medical School and the Chi Omegas,
will be awarded to the groups dis
playing the best musicality and in
terpretation in their vocal selections.
A master of ceremonies, yet unse
lected, will lead the crowd in com
munity singing in addition to the
regular competition.
