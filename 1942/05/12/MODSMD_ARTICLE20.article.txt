# African Film Will Depict Tribal Life
## 
### 
"Dawn Over Africa," a colored
motion picture by Mrs. Hamilton
Singer to be presented tonight at
7:30 in the auditorium of the Me
morial Hall, will feature close-ups of
lions, elephants, rhinos, giraffes, and
African natives.
The picture, a part of the weekly
Tuesday Evening Series, is of vital
interest, being the only document to
show the true color, mystery, and
beauty of the Dark Continent from
Capetown to the Mediterranean
shore.
FOUR-YEAR EXPEDITION
Mrs. Singer, a member of the So
ciety of Women Geographers, left
Capetown in 1936, when the only
news of war came out of Ethiopia,
and traveled alone for four years
throughout the African tribes.
She succeeded in covering 110,000
miles and brought back hundreds of
colored photographs and 60,000 feet
of motion picture film made during
her journey. Almost all of the pic
tures were made at tremendous per
sonal risk.
The American Geographical So
j ciety of Boston awarded her a gold
j medal for hor spectacular pictures
of the eruption of Mt. Nyamlagira.
To get these picturs it was neces
! sary for Mrs. Singer to climb to the
| summit and photograph in the
j seething crater the red-hot laval
| flow from a dangerously close posi
| tion.
WIDE EXPERIENCE
Mrs. Hamilton Singer's wide ex
perience among indigenous races in
many parts of the world and wide
knowledge of native dialects have
enabled her to depict the tribal life
and weird dance customs of primi
tive savage Africa with under
standing and interest. Members of a
tribe can be seen following their daily
occupations of work and play with
out any consciousness of being pho
tographed.
In addition to the general interest
of the picture presented, "Dawn Over
Africa" is of particular significance
to students studying biology, zool
ogy, anthropology, and ethnology.
