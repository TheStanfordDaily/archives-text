### 
WASHINGTON, May, 11 (UP). â€¢
Freezing of all wages and salaries is
advisable and reductions in indi
vidual income tax exemptions should
be "even more drastic" than those
proposed by the treasury, Price
Administrator Leon Henderson re
portedly told the House Ways and
Means Committee today.
He opposed a general sales tax but
favored a stiff income withholding
tax or compulsory savings, or both.
