## 
### 

IN A KNOCKOUT BATTLE that may have settled the supremacy of the South Pacific, U.S. battleships
(upper) brought their mightiest guns into play against the enemy fleet (lower) in the greatest naval battle
of the war and what appears from preliminary reports to have been the most successful in U.S. naval
history.
