## 
### 
LONDON, May 11 (UP). —Specific reports that Germany has hauled
large stores of poison gas to the Russian front and is building gas shelters
throughout the Reich inspired Prime Minister Churchill's Sunday night
warning, diplomatic quarters said today.
Churchill's speech, reviving a dread that has lurked in (lie back of Brit-

ish minds since the war
brought out new crops of gas masks
into the London streets today.
The Berlin radio, obviously taking
a sober view of Churchill's threat to
have the RAF strew poison gas all
over Germany if the Germans used
it in Russia, was heard broadcasting
that "Adolf Hitler as well as other
official German sources repeatedly
have made solemn assurances since
the start of the war that in con
formity with international law poi
son gas would not be used by Ger
many as long as Germany's enemies
. . . refrained from using poison
gas."
Nevertheless, the following reports
of Germany's gas preparations
against Russia were revealed:
1. Early in February large German
shipments of carboys filled with
mustard gas passed through one dis
trict that serves a section of the Rus
sian front. These shipments were
followed at the middle of the month
by more trainloads of mustard gas,
all under heavy guard.
2. From Feb. .1 to mid-March fre
quent shipments of large earthen
ware and glass containers of gas
moved toward the east. There also
were shipments of crate after crate
of gas ammunition of various cali
ber. Some of these crates were
marked "not to be opened except by
special order."
3. Large concrete gas reservoirs
have been constructed in an area
handy to the eastern front.
4. A six-barrelled gun called a
"Do Kanone" which throws gre
nades and shells loaded with liquid
gas of terrible corrosive effect re
portedly has been perfected.
5. Glass spheres filled with gas
are intended for attacks by planes.
The gas reportedly disperses over a
wide area when the container crashes

from a great height.
6. Instructions were issued to
German officials in eastern Europe
to keep their masks handy at all
times, and in the Reich gas shelters
are under construction even in vil
lages.
The Berlin radio specifically de
nied Russian charges that poison gas
mines have been used by the Ger
mans in the Crimean front, rind it
said Churchill's warning was "a sig
nificant symptom of the extreme
nervousness felt in the British
| Cabinet."

LONDON, May 11 (UP). —Specific reports that Germany has hauled
large stores of poison gas to the Russian front and is building gas shelters
throughout the Reich inspired Prime Minister Churchill's Sunday night
warning, diplomatic quarters said today.
Churchill's speech, reviving a dread that has lurked in (lie back of Brit-

ish minds since the war
brought out new crops of gas masks
into the London streets today.
The Berlin radio, obviously taking
a sober view of Churchill's threat to
have the RAF strew poison gas all
over Germany if the Germans used
it in Russia, was heard broadcasting
that "Adolf Hitler as well as other
official German sources repeatedly
have made solemn assurances since
the start of the war that in con
formity with international law poi
son gas would not be used by Ger
many as long as Germany's enemies
. . . refrained from using poison
gas."
Nevertheless, the following reports
of Germany's gas preparations
against Russia were revealed:
1. Early in February large German
shipments of carboys filled with
mustard gas passed through one dis
trict that serves a section of the Rus
sian front. These shipments were
followed at the middle of the month
by more trainloads of mustard gas,
all under heavy guard.
2. From Feb. .1 to mid-March fre
quent shipments of large earthen
ware and glass containers of gas
moved toward the east. There also
were shipments of crate after crate
of gas ammunition of various cali
ber. Some of these crates were
marked "not to be opened except by
special order."
3. Large concrete gas reservoirs
have been constructed in an area
handy to the eastern front.
4. A six-barrelled gun called a
"Do Kanone" which throws gre
nades and shells loaded with liquid
gas of terrible corrosive effect re
portedly has been perfected.
5. Glass spheres filled with gas
are intended for attacks by planes.
The gas reportedly disperses over a
wide area when the container crashes

from a great height.
6. Instructions were issued to
German officials in eastern Europe
to keep their masks handy at all
times, and in the Reich gas shelters
are under construction even in vil
lages.
The Berlin radio specifically de
nied Russian charges that poison gas
mines have been used by the Ger
mans in the Crimean front, rind it
said Churchill's warning was "a sig
nificant symptom of the extreme
nervousness felt in the British
| Cabinet."
