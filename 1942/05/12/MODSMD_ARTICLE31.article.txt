# GAS SCARE SPEEDS U.S. MASK DRIVE
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 11 (UP). â€”
British Prime Minister Winston
Churchill's warning that the Axis
may open poison gas warfare was
expected to give impetus tonight to
the drive to supply gas masks to
civilians in Atlantic and Pacific
coastal areas. Most officials here
agreed that if Germany resorts to
use of gas, the United States should
not hesitate to retaliate in kind.
