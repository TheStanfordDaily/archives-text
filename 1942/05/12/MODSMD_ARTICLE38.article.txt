### 
Discussing means of conserving
and economizing in wartime, Miss
Christine Ricker, director of dining
halls, yesterday spoke to a meeting
of students and house managers at
the Women's Clubhouse. It was
sponsored by the Y.W.C.A. and the
consumer committee.
"Although our object is still to
make people want to eat their food,
scarcity and expense may force
Americans to modify their old prac
tice of always eating just what they
like," Miss Ricker declared.
Pointing out that the dessert
problem may become even greater,
she said that canned fruit will un
doubtedly rise in price and be less
plentiful as will sugar substitutes
like corn sugar and honey. Since
there are no price ceilings on meat,
fruit, and vegetables, and dairy
products, budgets will remain of
foremost importance, she added.
After Miss Ricker's talk, those at
tending the meeting exchanged fa
vorite plans and recipes for elimi
nating waste and expense.
