# Frosh Press All-U Golf Competition
## 
### 
Stanford's 1942 all-University
golf tournament, reaching the third
round of play over the local course
1 his week, is definitely unique on
two counts: (1) the final meeting
will probably combine the two top
college linksmen on the coast, Bud
Brownell, 1941 champ, and Frank
McCann, 1942 king; (2) the fresh
men are spilling varsity blood.
None other than Bob Barber, run
ner-up to Brownell in last year's
contest, was dropped from the run
ning last week by Bob Cardinal of
the freshmen. Â«
And Jack Shuler, supposedly
number one freshie, meets the var
sity's Pete Jones in a match today
that might send one more topflight
yearling into further competition.
The froth have been flirting with
par all year. Th sage eye of Eddie
Twiggs sees another national cham
pionship next year for a Farm squad
which can draw on the Encina tal
ent. Simple: Brownell had to shoot
a sub-par 70 to stop the freshie's
Rosecrance last week.
Cardinal will follow up his Bar
ber win against teammate Bill Lowe
today. Either winner has the stuff
to drop varsity men in future play.
George Traphagen defeated Frick
son to advance to the third round,
and he awaits the winner of the
McC;in n-Ha 11 man match for his next
round. Dave Doud dropped Jackie
Wilson to hit the third round in play
last week.
With luck in rain, play-offs, and
in general, Twiggs hopes that the
golf king of '42 will be crowned a
week from Saturday, expecting some
of the top matches to come this
week-end as the frosh make their
bid to stay in the running.
