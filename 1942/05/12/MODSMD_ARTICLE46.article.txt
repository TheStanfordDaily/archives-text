crying about our poor track
team.
The Daily's track expert, and I
can use expert without any qualms,
figures that in dual meet competi
tion U.S.C., California, and San Jose
are the only teams in the country
that could beat us.
Go aheadâ€”scoff. You think that
because there are three teams in our
own state that can beat us, there are
three teams in every other state also.
The fact, however, remains that no
Eastern, Midwestern, Southern, or
Southwestern team could outscore
us in a dual meet, and don't forget
that the man who makes this bald
statement was only 3 points off of
the Big Meet score and 2/3 of a
point off of the Trojan meet score,
out of 131 poirvts.
Let's site a few examples: Nebras
ka, class of the Big Six and one of
the best teams in the nation, would
fall 70-61 before the mighty In
dians; Michigan, perennial power of
the Big Ten, would bow even lower
in defeat; Rice, the Southwest's
strongest entrant, would be lucky to
score 55 points against us; Ohio
State, new Big Ten champ, would
fare about the same; and finally
Penn State, Icey-foray winner, could
get 50 digits to 81 for us.
Put that in your pipe and smoke
it, to use the vernacular.
Don't be too surprised too if Stan
| ford comes within an ace, to use
j another colloquial phrase, of out
i scoring California's mighty Golden
Bears in the Pacific Coast Confer
ence championships at Seattle with
| in a few weeks.

W/ELL, today is the day of days in
, Stanford Softball Circles.
Daily vs. Theta Delts.
If your lab lets out early and there
isn't time for a flicker before din-
I ner, come out to the intramural field

and see the World Series of Farm
softball.
Although the Daily team is mathe
matically out of the championship
race most of the boys don't know
much math anyway so it promises to
be a thrill-packed game from the
word. "Let's get this damn thing
going."
If we do not win this game there
is a possibility lhat the team as a
unit will join the Coast Guard in
telligence.
Approximately eighty million per
