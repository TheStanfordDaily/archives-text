Stanford will be able to put the
speediest backfield on the coast into
play next fall with all the mercuried
material present in the regular
spring workouts. If he wanted to,
Coach Jim Lawson could insert a
quartet composed of A1 Cole, Jim
Pettit. AI Hoisch, and Buck Fawcett.
which could burn up the turfâ€”all of
the four can turn the hundred
around the 10-flat mark.
Although the four may never be
in the game all at the same time,
top speed could be attained if nec
essary.
Cole dislocated a shoulder last
week and Ray Hammett is quarter
backing along with Neale Johnston,
Bobby Andrew, and Jack Clark.
A cold wind kept the boys very
busy yesterday with Pettit ripping
off some nice gains behind very
astute blocking by Messrs. Jack
Cox, Lonen LaPrade, Dave Patter
son, and Ed McCain.
One pass play looked so good it
won't be given away here. The re
ceiver comes up with a flock of
blockers.
