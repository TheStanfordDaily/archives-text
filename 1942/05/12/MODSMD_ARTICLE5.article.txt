# Men's Council Hits Tardy Payments
## 
### 
Students who have neglected park
ing and speeding tickets and fines
will have their grades held up, and
an additional fine imposed, accord
ing to Bob Morton, chairman of
Men's Council, said last night.
In announcing today's council
meeting at 1:15 p.m., Morton urged
students to act on neglected viola
tions immediately as the additional
fine will depend on the length of
time the initial fine is ignored.
