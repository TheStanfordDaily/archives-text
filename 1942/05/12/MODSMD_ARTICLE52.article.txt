# Pitch Lauds Hertel, Reiss On Hurdling
## 
### 
Coach I'itch Johnson arrived hack
! on the Farm yesterday morning sat
isfied for the most part with his
charges' perormances in their dual
meet with C.S.C. last Saturday.
Not only did Ed Hertel surpass
himself in winning both hurdles in
i near-record time, but Don Reiss, in
taking two thirds, ran 14.9 and 23.9,
which approach the best he's ever
done.
MISJUDGED DISTANCES
Both Bob Compton in the mile and
! Wy Cripe in the 880 did not run the
race they were capable of because
of misjudging their pace. Compton
did the first quarter of his mile in
til seconds, which is 4 seconds faster
than he usually takes it. Therefore,
around about the third lap he didn't
have enough left to make a race of
it. His time of 4:29.9 was only me
diocre.
Cripe, after seeing Compton's mis
take, hung back on his first lap, but
he too overdid it. His first lap time
of 59 seconds was far too slow, and
consequenlty he could do no better
than 1:59.4 for the whole route.
STAMM, NORBERG UP TO PAR
Ed Stamm and Hank Norberg
threw the shot and discus as far as
was expected, but superior per
formances by Trojan Carl Merritt
left them with seconds. A1 Pande
threw the javelin farther than he
ever had previously, but it only
landed him in second.
Both Vein Hart and Ed Tomaso
j came very close to making the win
ning heights of 6 feet 5 V<i inches in
j the high jump and 14 feet even in
| the pole vault, but both men barely
j ticked the bar off on their way down.
They finished tied for second with
teammates Willard Smith and Russ
Peck.
SMITH IS SURPRISE
One of Johnson's biggest surprises
was the 50.4 quarter turned in by
Bob Smith. The 440, Stanford's
weakest event, was swept by the
Trojans, but Smith was a close fourth
in a time better than his previous
best. Mort Orme also improved to
| 51.2.
John Silva, only recently rid of
the measles, came through with 10.0
and 22.1 races in the dashes, but
they were only good enough for
! fourth places against the many good
| Troy dashmen.

SMITH IS SURPRISE
One of Johnson's biggest surprises
was the 50.4 quarter turned in by
Bob Smith. The 440, Stanford's
weakest event, was swept by the
Trojans, but Smith was a close fourth
in a time better than his previous
best. Mort Orme also improved to
| 51.2.
John Silva, only recently rid of
the measles, came through with 10.0
and 22.1 races in the dashes, but
they were only good enough for
! fourth places against the many good
| Troy dashmen.
LOS ANGELES, May 10 (UP).—
j The Chicago Cubs announced today
that pitcher Jesse Flores is being re
turned immediately to the Coast
League Los Angeles club. Flores
won 12, lost 15 games for Los An-
I geles last year.
Coach I'itch Johnson arrived hack
! on the Farm yesterday morning sat
isfied for the most part with his
charges' perormances in their dual
meet with C.S.C. last Saturday.
Not only did Ed Hertel surpass
himself in winning both hurdles in
i near-record time, but Don Reiss, in
taking two thirds, ran 14.9 and 23.9,
which approach the best he's ever
done.
MISJUDGED DISTANCES
Both Bob Compton in the mile and
! Wy Cripe in the 880 did not run the
race they were capable of because
of misjudging their pace. Compton
did the first quarter of his mile in
til seconds, which is 4 seconds faster
than he usually takes it. Therefore,
around about the third lap he didn't
have enough left to make a race of
it. His time of 4:29.9 was only me
diocre.
Cripe, after seeing Compton's mis
take, hung back on his first lap, but
he too overdid it. His first lap time
of 59 seconds was far too slow, and
consequenlty he could do no better
than 1:59.4 for the whole route.
STAMM, NORBERG UP TO PAR
Ed Stamm and Hank Norberg
threw the shot and discus as far as
was expected, but superior per
formances by Trojan Carl Merritt
left them with seconds. A1 Pande
threw the javelin farther than he
ever had previously, but it only
landed him in second.
Both Vein Hart and Ed Tomaso
j came very close to making the win
ning heights of 6 feet 5 V<i inches in
j the high jump and 14 feet even in
| the pole vault, but both men barely
j ticked the bar off on their way down.
They finished tied for second with
teammates Willard Smith and Russ
Peck.
