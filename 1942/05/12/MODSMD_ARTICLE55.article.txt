# War and Student Government
## 
### 
STANFORD has been operating on a four
quarter system—with a summer quarter—
for over 20 years. War has necessitated no
more than slipping the academic gears into
high for an expanded summer quarter. Thus,
with a minimum of effort, Stanford is operating
on a three-year basis.
To student government this three-year edu
cation can very possibly mean the end of the
class system — freshman, sophomore, junior
and senior—and consequently the end of class
representation on Ex Committee. - This is only
one of the many wartime problems with which
Ex Committee is faced in considering a reor
ganization of student government.
What new type of student government, suited
to streamlined wartime requirements, Ex Com
mittee will recommend to the students is to
date undecided. Certainly the sub-committee
on reorganization should present its findings
and investigations before the end of the present
quarter, or as soon as a careful study will allow.
In reorganizing student government posi
tions, too much emphasis cannot be placed upon
the post of War Activities Co-ordinator. At
Stanford in wartime, this recently created office
is ultimately of just as great importance as the
student body presidency. There is nothing
more vital for the duration than capable lead
ership of the student war effort.
The position of War Activities Co-ordinator
should not be a political job, which can too
easily be filled by an incompetent, uninterested
student who merely wishes "glory." It should
be an appointive position, and the co-ordinator
should be appointed by Ex Committee upon
the recommendation of his predecessor, who
has worked with him and trained him.
The War Activities Co-ordinator should be an
ex-officio member of Ex Committee, entitled to
attend all meetings and voice opinions as a
member, without vote.
He should be an intelligent, personable and
fast-thinking worker who has evidenced per
sonal interest in the job by the work he has
done previously.
The importance of this position is evidenced
by the fact that it will be his efforts which ulti
mately determine the character of the Stanford
student body's contribution to victory.

He should be an intelligent, personable and
fast-thinking worker who has evidenced per
sonal interest in the job by the work he has
done previously.
The importance of this position is evidenced
by the fact that it will be his efforts which ulti
mately determine the character of the Stanford
student body's contribution to victory.
STANFORD has been operating on a four
quarter system—with a summer quarter—
for over 20 years. War has necessitated no
more than slipping the academic gears into
high for an expanded summer quarter. Thus,
with a minimum of effort, Stanford is operating
on a three-year basis.
To student government this three-year edu
cation can very possibly mean the end of the
class system — freshman, sophomore, junior
and senior—and consequently the end of class
representation on Ex Committee. - This is only
one of the many wartime problems with which
Ex Committee is faced in considering a reor
ganization of student government.
What new type of student government, suited
to streamlined wartime requirements, Ex Com
mittee will recommend to the students is to
date undecided. Certainly the sub-committee
on reorganization should present its findings
and investigations before the end of the present
quarter, or as soon as a careful study will allow.
In reorganizing student government posi
tions, too much emphasis cannot be placed upon
the post of War Activities Co-ordinator. At
Stanford in wartime, this recently created office
is ultimately of just as great importance as the
student body presidency. There is nothing
more vital for the duration than capable lead
ership of the student war effort.
The position of War Activities Co-ordinator
should not be a political job, which can too
easily be filled by an incompetent, uninterested
student who merely wishes "glory." It should
be an appointive position, and the co-ordinator
should be appointed by Ex Committee upon
the recommendation of his predecessor, who
has worked with him and trained him.
The War Activities Co-ordinator should be an
ex-officio member of Ex Committee, entitled to
attend all meetings and voice opinions as a
member, without vote.
He should be an intelligent, personable and
fast-thinking worker who has evidenced per
sonal interest in the job by the work he has
done previously.
