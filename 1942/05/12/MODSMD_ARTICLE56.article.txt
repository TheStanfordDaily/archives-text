# 'You'll Have to Coax Me'
## 
### 
WE hesitated at great length before finally
consenting to sell the soul of the editorial
column to the Spring Show, but after a personal
phone call from Charlie Bulotti, who is "inter
ested" in the show, we just couldn't resist.
After considerable wheedling on our part,
Bulotti broke down and gave us permission to
say the annual production will be thrown open
to public view Friday and Saturday evenings
at 8:15.
Near the end of the conversation he lost his
head and let slip the surprise secret that there
will be "two movies right smack in the middle
of the show." Additional coaxing on our part
brought forth the confession that this year's
on-campus presentation is "different" and
"pretty tremendous."
That's the nice thing about Charlieâ€”non
committal as a Hollywood press agent.
