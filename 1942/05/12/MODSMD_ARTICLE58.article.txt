### AMIE REICHERT 
(Editor's Note: Miss Reichert's column is writ
ten today by Hap Everett, associate editor.)
Vfc/E HAVE finally adopted one of our enemies' most
effective war methods. Remember the way the
Japanese took Hainan without batting an eye? That
clever little piece of international banditry was the
first step toward complete control of the South China
Sea.
In the past several weeks we've used this type of
strategic seizure to great advantage. The United States
recently took over New Caledonia, Free French island
occupying an important position in relation to the
South Pacific supply lines. The Battle of the Coral
Sea proves the value of this move. In fact, the battle
may have been decided by the sea and air forces sta
tioned on this new base.
After France made it pretty clear that a rapproche
ment with the United Nations is out for a while, the
British moved into the northern tip of Madagascar to
make sure no one else controls the Indian supply
lines.
As has been the case with our enemies, this policy
is proving successful, and it should be extended. Just
where the next strategic occupation may best be made,
is hard to say; but it seems logical to urge the seizure
of Martinique.
Martinique does not have the immediate importance
of a Madagascar; but it could easily prove a thorn in
our side. The aircraft carrier Bearn and the cruisers
Emile Bertin and Jeanne D'Arc are down there. They
are very close to the Virgin Islands and not so far
from continental America. With some pressure by the
Gestapo on the families of the crews, these three pow
erful neutral ships might suddenly be arrayed against
us. The German submarine force in the Carribbean is
doing tremendous damage right up to the shores of
the Mexican Gulf; we can't afford to have anything
else turned loose in the vicinity.

LAUZANNE, veteran editor of the Paris
w Matin broke out in a rash in his editorial column
yesterday and flayed "America's cynical hypocrisy" in
seeking to change the status in Martinique. Vichy is
mad because our State Department went over the
head of the Europeans and dealt directy with the local
government of Martinique. Laval himself conferred
with Admiral Darlan, Takanobu Mitani, Japanese am
bassador, and later with German officials at Moulins
and, according to Vichy dispatches he has warned
the United States that his government will outlaw any
arrangements made between American officials and
French colonies in the Caribbean unless they have been
expressly authorized by Vichy.
Then there's about $200,000,000 of gold reserve from
the Bank of France sitting on Martinique. As things
stand, gold is about the least sought-after metal; but
it seems logical to assume we could use that gold
for something. Why not invest it wisely for poor
Franceâ€”say in some United Nations common.
