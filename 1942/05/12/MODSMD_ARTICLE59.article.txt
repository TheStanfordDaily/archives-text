# BULL SESSION

### MIKE CHURCHILL 
SING-110
W/ITH LAVORIS sales booming, the campus is rap
idly becoming sing conscious. Groups of 15 and
more are rehearsing scales, making arrangements, and
practicing harmony.
This column recently conducted a poll of a not-too
accurate nature to determine what songs will be
sung at the coming Singfest.
Axe Society is vigorously rehearsing their own
arrangement of "Lost in a Fog." This is the first action
to come from that body in some time.
George Jackson is putting a combination of his old
and new Excoms through its paces in a new rendition
of the old favorite, "There'll Be Some Changes Made."
This is being done in a frantic effort to publicize their
efforts to reorganize student government.
The Pi Phis will be heard in their own creation,
"I Said Maybe," sung to the tune of "I Said No."
While the Tri Delts, dressed in nifty U.S.O. costumes,
are to sing "We're in the Army Nowâ€”And Is It Fun!"
El Toro will probably sing "Ferdinand the Bull" to
bring out their new character of sweetness and light
brought about by their president and ex-Daily Editor,
Charles the Bull.
El Campo, on the other hand, will sing "Ring Dat
Bell," an old Negro spiritual, reminiscent of the days
when El Campo had a bell to ring.
Women's Council has a number they intend to
sing entitled, "Don't Sit Under the Apple Tree with
Anybody at All Because There Is No Use Taking
Chances Is There?"
Another spiritual, "Nobody Knows the Troubles I've
Been Through Trying to Get Dates What with the
Ratio What It Is and the Alpha Phis Dating Like
They Do," is to be chanted out by a full group of
Robleites.
The attractive group recently pictured in the Chap
pic in a V for Victimized pose will sing several verses
of "I've Got a Zoot Suit Which Makes Me Just That
Much More Photogenic, Really It Docs."
Now that you know what a representative cross
section of the campus is singing, get out your verse
books, dust off the piano, and get to singing.
