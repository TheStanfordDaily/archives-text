TIIK CODE ANI) FREEDOM

'JMIE EDITOR, SIR:
Though no member of the Stanford faculty and
no student but only a private research worker and
lecturer, may I express my deep interest in the way
The Stanford Daily reports on the Stanford honor
code problem?
I was a president of a junior college in the city of
Berlin before the Nazis came into power and tried to
introduce both self-government and the honor code
into my college. I failed, not because there were not
students eager and willing to adopt these methods of
self-education, but because the whole atmosphere of a
republic that was not yet based on democracy was
unfavorable to the experiment.
This is not so at Stanford, and it seems to me of
very great importance that the students of a univer
sity in a free nation at war should jealously protect
their precious freedom guaranteed by the honor code,
and act accordingly.
Very sincerely yours,
Susanne C. Englemann

CAKLKSS WEDNESDAY

HP HE EDITOR, SIR:
Despite good Daily publicity, "Carless Wednesday"
turned out to be something of a flop. The parking lots
(especially the faculty ones) were about as crowded as
ever, and cars were parked thickly around the Quad.
Granted, one day a week doesn't save much rubber
in tires; but it is a step in the right direction. Some
guys are for the war only so long as it doesn't pinch !
their feet! The Stanford War Activities Council should
stick stickers on all the cars in parking lots on Wed- l
nesdays. I leave the text of the stickers up to the
board.
Yours,
Horatio Snaffle '
