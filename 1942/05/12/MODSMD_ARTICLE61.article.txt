# Brandt Tells Of Nazi Supply

### 
"In the battle of food the Nazis
stop at nothing. It will be a good
five years before the German army
and its great home army of supply
producing labor become pinched for
food," declared Dr. Karl Brandt,
economist in the Food Research In
stitute, in an article, "Hunger Won't
Beat the Axis," carried in the last
issue of the Saturday Evening Post.
"For," he continues, "if the Nazis'
present reorganization of Europe's
agriculture proves inadequate for
full rations, thfy will cold-bloodedly
starve all the rest of Europe to feed
themselves."
What the Reich wants, according
to Dr. Brandt, is a contented, or, at
worst, non-turbulent ring of vassal
states, working hard without fuss.
In Poland, France, and probably
the Ukraine, the Ostland Corpora
tion, state-farming branch of the
Reich Food Estate, has appeared and
is turning country formerly composed
of small farms into "huge field food
factories like the Russian collective
farms."
"The Ostmark," he says, "is as ef
ficient as an assembly line and as
carefully scheduled as a divisional
review."
