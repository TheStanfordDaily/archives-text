# Chi O's Find Giant Birds Sleeping Soundly in Tree
## 
### 
"Hey," screamed a Chi O early
yesterday morning, "there are two
St. Bernards in the tree outside my
window."
"Sure, sure," soothed a second
Chi O. "and there are six pink ele
phants playing billiards downstairs
on our dining room table."
Then, Chi O No. 2 looked out the
window. Two St. Bernards in a
tree!
When Chi O No. 3 brought Chi O's
No. 1 and 2, they hung out the win
dow and inspected the St. Ber
nards, which weren't. That is. they
weren't St. Bernards. They were
birds. Great big, black and white
birds, sleeping soundly in a tree
outside an upstairs window of the
sorority.
Tousled, sleepy Chi's aroused
themselves to look at the creatures
and then went back to bed to sleep
it off.
But other people saw the crea-

turns (the birds, nol the Chi O's)
find word spread. Soon, Dr. Bailey
Willis, ornithologist from the geol
ogy department, came to look at the
huge specimens. He climbed the
tree, and established the reality of
the rare birds. Chi O's heaved sighs
of relief and got up ot go to classes.
The birds, Dr. Willis said, were
night-flying herons from South
America, very rare in this region.
They usually stay near water, but
these apparently wandered. They
sleep all during the day, and are
active only at night. There is no
connection between this fact and the
fact that they chose the Chi O house
as a roost, state the Chi O's.
"These birds are on their way to
Canada," announce the worldly-wise
sorority women. How they obtained
this information they will not re
veal.
Meanwhile, the birds slop) soundly
on. resting, undoubtedly, for their
long journey to Canada.
