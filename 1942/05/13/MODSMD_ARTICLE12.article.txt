# Stanford to Save Tin Cans; Collections Begin Next Week
## 
### 
Adding Jo Stanford's wartime activities, a campus-wide tin collection
will be made May 2,' i at the end of a Tin Can Drive sponsored by the
"Salvage for Victory" division of Farm war activities.
Beginning today, members of all campus living groups, as well as pri
vate residences <;n campus, are asked to save their tin cans, smash them,

and place them in a box to be col
lected a week from Friday.
"Our main purpose is to get the
tin back into production," said Ed
Porter, drive chairman. "All tin col
lected will be sent to San Francisco
to the detinning plant and put back
â€¢nio production."
SHOULD BE WASHED
Tin to be collected should be
washed, broken at both ends, and the
labels removed. Although this takes
a little time, it is the only way tin
can be salvaged.
Collections will be made early in
the morning by the Peninsula Sani
tary Company, which has volun
teered men and trucks for the job.
All members of campus living
groups will place their tin boxes in
back alleys near their garbage cans,
while private residences will place
their tin boxes in front of the
houses on the curb.
MORNING COLLECTION
As collections will be made early
in the morning, tin boxes should be
put out the night before.
"Let's start saving tin now for this
collection. It doesn't take a great
many cans to supply enough tin for
an airplane's need," Porter said.
The campaign will be under the
direction of the.new salvage execu
tive committee appointed recently
by Porter. Members include Peggy
Mayers, women's halls; Howard
Nicholson, men's halls; Dinny Sick,
sororities; Jack Pugh, fraternities;
Bill Hutchison, head of all collec
tions; and Ferris Boothc, publicity.
