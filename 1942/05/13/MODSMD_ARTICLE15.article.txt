# Excom Hears Plan for ASSU Reorganization
## Harry Horton Presents Proposal to Eliminate Class Representation 
### 
Hurry Horton, graduate man, last
night presented Ex Committee with
a plan for student government re
organization.
The plan calls for a provisional
government which docs away with
class representation. The executive
council of the new government
would include the president of the
student body, the vice-president,
four members-at-largc, Ihe presi
dent of the Associated Men, and the
president of the Associated Women.
These officers would constitute the
voting members of the council.
Having a scat on the council, but
no vote, would be the Stanford War
Activities Co-ordinator, the Daily
editor, a representative of Speech
and Drama, an athletic commis
sioner, and the presidents of Men's
and Women's Councils.
OTHER MEMBERS
Other ex-officio members would
be the student manager and the stu
dent colonel of R.O.T.C.
The new government calls for a
division of the student body accord
ing to sex. The Associated Men of
Stanford University would be made
up of the following groups: Inter
fraternity Council, Inter-club Coun
cil, Encina, Branner, Toyon, Sequoia,
! graduate men, and off-campus men.
j The Associated Women of Stan
| ford University would do away with
Women's Conference and include
I these groups: Panhellenic, Lagunita,
Roblc, Union, Casa Ventura, Elm,
Hawthorne, Madrono, Manzanita,
Mariposa, The Oaks, graduate wom
en, and off-campus women.
NOT PRACTICAL
Horton's committee investigating
the re-organization possibilities
found that the divisions according
to classes would not be practical
during the war. The committee con
cluded that the present form of gov
i crnmcnt would become unworkable
| in the near future.
Of the four mcmbcrs-at-large,
presumably two would represent the
lower division. Seven members
would ordinarily vote on the coun
cil, with the president of the student
body voting only in certain special
cases.
Ex Committee discussed the plan
last night for almost two hours.
President George Jackson said the
Committee would take final action
on the plan next week.

cases.
Ex Committee discussed the plan
last night for almost two hours.
President George Jackson said the
Committee would take final action
on the plan next week.
Hurry Horton, graduate man, last
night presented Ex Committee with
a plan for student government re
organization.
The plan calls for a provisional
government which docs away with
class representation. The executive
council of the new government
would include the president of the
student body, the vice-president,
four members-at-largc, Ihe presi
dent of the Associated Men, and the
president of the Associated Women.
These officers would constitute the
voting members of the council.
Having a scat on the council, but
no vote, would be the Stanford War
Activities Co-ordinator, the Daily
editor, a representative of Speech
and Drama, an athletic commis
sioner, and the presidents of Men's
and Women's Councils.
OTHER MEMBERS
Other ex-officio members would
be the student manager and the stu
dent colonel of R.O.T.C.
The new government calls for a
division of the student body accord
ing to sex. The Associated Men of
Stanford University would be made
up of the following groups: Inter
fraternity Council, Inter-club Coun
cil, Encina, Branner, Toyon, Sequoia,
! graduate men, and off-campus men.
j The Associated Women of Stan
| ford University would do away with
Women's Conference and include
I these groups: Panhellenic, Lagunita,
Roblc, Union, Casa Ventura, Elm,
Hawthorne, Madrono, Manzanita,
Mariposa, The Oaks, graduate wom
en, and off-campus women.
NOT PRACTICAL
Horton's committee investigating
the re-organization possibilities
found that the divisions according
to classes would not be practical
during the war. The committee con
cluded that the present form of gov
i crnmcnt would become unworkable
| in the near future.
Of the four mcmbcrs-at-large,
presumably two would represent the
lower division. Seven members
would ordinarily vote on the coun
cil, with the president of the student
body voting only in certain special
cases.
