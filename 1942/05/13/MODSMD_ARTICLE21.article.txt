The merry Oldsmobilc gets an
other rest today.
For the third time, Stanforditcs
will leave their cars at home to con
serve tires and gasoline for the na
tional war effort and make "Car-less
Wednesday" what the name de
scribes.
"We aren't going to follow the
suggestion in Campus Opinion that
we put stickers on the windshields
of non-conformists because we
want to save paper, but you know
what we're thinking when we see
the parking lot nearly filled," states
Burt Berry, newly appointed chair
man of "Car-less Wednesday."
While Wednesday has been desig
nated as earless in order to concen
trate the conservation efforts of
campus residents, the consumer
committee urges everyone to cut
down on unnecessary driving every
day. Through co-operative driving,
expense and waste can be reduced,
they declare.
Posted in the Cellar now are lists
on which persons may sign who
want or can offer rides 1o San Jose
or San Francisco. For shorter trips,
the committee suggests that students
make arrangements for co-operative
driving within their living groups.
