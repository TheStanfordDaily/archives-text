FAWCETT SPEAKS
"This is not just another fashion
show." says Isabelle Fawcett, who
has taken Jane Ellen Cooper's place i
as chairman of the event, "but will
be very quick and very informal."
A movie on clothes designing in
Quebec will be incorporated into the
theme of the show. Says Margaret
Elliott, "I think everyone will be
intex'ested to see how styles have I
changed in accordance with the
war."
The models will demonstrate the J
new clothes regulations specified in i
the freezing order issued in April. |
Co-eds will find that today's latest !
styles are going to be worn tomor- |
row and probably the day after.
