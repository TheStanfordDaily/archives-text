# Soldier Life To Be Topic At 12:10 Club
## 
### 
Even though the sororities and
fraternities will have no guests at
the 12:10 Club, there will still be
soldier speakers, according to offi
cers of nearby camps.
It was learned today that 18 sol
diers who were to be guests of liv
ing groups at lunch today could not
get away from the camp. Only the
speakers can come. They will talk
about army life in .general and mor
ale of soldiers in camp.
The 12:10 Club meeting this noon
in the Nitery will be the second in
the spring quarter series for which
season tickets will be on sale at the
door for 80 cents. This is a saving
over the regular price of 35 cents
for each lunch. The 12:10 Club is a
revamped luncheon club which
started last Wednesday under the di
rection of a student-faculty execu
tive committee working with Dr. D.
Elton Trueblood, Stanford chaplain.
The meeting this noon has been
designated Army Day in order to
bring more co-operation between
students and the soldiers in army
camps near the campus. The speak
ers have indicated that they will be
ready to answer all questions they
can without giving away trade se
crets.
Discussion will be led by the pro
gram chairman of the 12:10 Club,
Norman Ross; the meeting will be
conducted by the president, Bob
Potter.
