# Dreams Called Hallucinatory Dissociations
## Dr. Cutting States Much of Man's Life Spent Near Insanity 
### 
Dreams are the hallucinatory
thoughts of a dissociated mind which
has shut out impressions of siÂ»ht.
hearing, and equilibrium, according
to Dr. James A. Cutting of Agnew
State- Hospital and the Stanford
Medical School.
Dr. Cutting, in presenting a paper
to a recent meeting of the California
Medical Association at Del Monte. I
further stated that since we all
dream, much of our life is spent as
a bedfellow of the insane.
An hallucination differs from an '
ordinary thought or a recalled mem
ory chiefly by its vividness and its
"telling tone," Dr. Cutting ex
plained. lie went on to say that "In
the process of going to sleep, as one
snuggles down into bed he auto- '
matically shuts out a stream of sens- !
ory impressions . . ."
In this way, the doctor continued, ;
the individual's inhibitory control is !
impaired and the individual falls '
back into a more primitive, vivid, |
emotional way ol thinking in which
the images pass before the individual
in motion-picture form.
Dr. Cutting further explained that
illusions are mild forms of halluci- j
nations and that the same mech- |
an ism experienced in normal dream- !
ing is found in the dissociated mind j
of the epileptic. Dr. Cutting has re- j
eently finished a study of a hun- j
dred consecutive psychotic patients j
admitted to Agnew State Hospital in j
which he has found that 75 per cent
have hallucinations.
Freud had something to say about '
tli is too.
