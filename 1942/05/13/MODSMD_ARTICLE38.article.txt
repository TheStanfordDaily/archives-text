### 
VICHY, May 12 (UP).â€”German
and French police have isolated
large sections of downtown Paris
and blocked subway traffic in a
hunt for terrorists who bombed six
hotels and restaurants requisitioned
by the German army, dispatches
from the city said today.
The scale of this fresh outburst of
terrorism was believed to show that
a well-organized band of perhaps
many members was at work in the
city.
Ihe latest display of violent re
sistance to the German army of oc
cupation came only a few hours after
saboteurs dynamited the Bourges
radio transmitting station. 130 miles
south of Paris, disrupting the Ger
man-used Paris radio, and derailed
a freight train near Parthenay, 180
miles southwest of Paris.
In the 15th century Scotland, golf
was officially discouraged because it
was displacing the practice of the
war sport, archery.
