# Theta Delt Rally Beats Daily Nine
## 
### 
I beta moved in to a leading
league spot yesterday by downing
tlie Daily softhall s<|iia«l 7-0 in an
end-game rally which brought in
■i runs in (he sixth inning and 4 in
the last.
Outstanding for the winners were
Itoss Hughes and Tom Boyle who
both hit home runs. Boyle pitched
a fast game. George Kaufman, Daily
pitcher, hurled a tight ball game
until the last two innings when his
outfield support crumbled. The
Daily's only threat was in the second
inning when bases were loaded, but
the newsmen were unable to bring
in any runs.
Sid Hayes re-established his cam
pus pitching standing by holding the
Chi Psi's to only 1 hit in a Zete win
5-0. Lust week Hayes pitched a no
hit game. His pitching during the
last two weeks ties him with Sherm
Seelix of Breakers for the lending
pitcher s spot. As present standings
are, there is a possibility that Seelix
and Hayes may go a pitching duel
in league play-offs next week. While
league standings will not be definite
until after this week's games are
over, Breakers and Zetas will prob
ably take their leagues.
