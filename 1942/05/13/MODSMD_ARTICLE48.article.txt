Kumler, in his first year at Stan

best goal maker on the team. In the
last three polo games Kumler has
scored a total of 13 points for the
j Cards. This game ought to see Kum
; ler at his best. Captain Ranzoni has
put the Indian poloists through the
' paces in practice this last week, and
Kumler showed up exceptionally
■ well.
DIRKER, GREEN
Bill Dirker and Donny Green,
| who pair oil at the number two spot,
j are another pair of fine poloists.
j Dirker hasn't played much this last
| quarter because of an arm injury
received in a polo game winter quar
ter. His place has been admirably
I filled in by Green. Neither Green
| nor Dirker are hard hitters but they
| do their share of playing.
Mike Gates is the hardest hitter
on the team. At the three position
Gates hasn't much opportunity to
score, but he bats the ball down the
I field where his teammates can hit in.
