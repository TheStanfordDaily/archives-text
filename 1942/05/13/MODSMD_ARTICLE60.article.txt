# 'Dimes for Diplomas'
## 
### 
IT seems that every day is a "Dimes for
Something" or a "Quarter for Something
Else" day on the campus, but it also seems
that everyone one of these days has an impor
tant significance for the future of the men and
women of Stanford and the nation as a whole.
Tomorrow and every Thursday, along with
the regular War Stamp and Bond day, Stanford
students are asked to contribute to the "Dimes
for Diplomas" fund.
A goal has been set for each week—s49o—
enough money to give scholarships to two men
for a guarter after they return from serving our
country in the armed forces. This means a lot to
men today who can't really plan from one day
to the next.
It is too bad that a man, after preparing him
self for his life work at college, has to stop just
before the conclusion of his college education
to fight men that he and his friends may con
tinue their work. But that is the way things
have to be now.
Much has been said about giving up cokes,
cigarettes, and candy to contribute to these
worthy causes, and there will have to be an
awful lot more said before we ever reach per
fection.
There is one small way, however, that the
fraternities and sororities can help. Most of
them impose fines for violations of house rules.
Why couldn't this money be turned over to the
"Dimes for Diplomas" fund? There are prob
ably dozens of other ways of securing revenue
for this drive.
Let's all work together and think of our future
and the futures of those men who are and will
be fighting this war.—John Horrall
