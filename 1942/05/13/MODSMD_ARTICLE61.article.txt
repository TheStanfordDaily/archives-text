# The
						General View

### 
DON'T worry if you are not specializing in
some very practical, technical field.
The nation certainly can do with plenty of
specialized skill; to a great extent, wars are won
by the measure of ability in research work,
technical design, scientific skill. But there is
going to be a place in the world for the man
with the general cultural background, particu
larly after this war, when the large-scale view
must be taken to reconstruct society.
Ortega y Gasset has told us of the paradox
of the educated man in the age of specializa
tion.
The man who knows everything there is to
know about some particular technical field is in
one sense educated,* in another ignorant. In
order to keep civilization on the march, the
Spanish philosopher tells us, we must have men
vitally interested in the general aspects of that
civilization.—Hap Everett
