•'"PHE American press has recently been con-
JL fronted with the thorny problem of whether
it shall accept paid advertisements from the
United States government during the war.
At first the project seems innocent enough,
and the claim of many newspapermen, that the
war of words and ideas could be won much
easier if the profession's crack ad-writing men
were called in, is impressive.
Violent objections to the plan, however, have
come from many, far-sighted editors who claim
that the government could then influence the
press in a way harmful to our principle of the
free press, and could by playing favorites and
threatening withdrawal of patronage force many
editors to back it editorially.
A couple of years ago a Mr. Harold Ickes,
whose name has from time to time been con
nected with the present Administration, had
quite a bit to say on the power of advertisers
over the editorial policies of the American
newspapers. So far Mr. Ickes has been silent
over the question of whether a large govern
ment-sponsored advertising program would in
crease the government's power over the news
papers. It will be interesting to note how Mr.
Ickes gets out of this one. Vic Minahan
