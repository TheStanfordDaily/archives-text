### AMIE REICHERT 
| )EAR MR. HEARST:
You are a rich old man and a powerful old man
and an old man who is full of bitterness and venom
and hatreds and nobody can tell you anything. Just
the same I am going to try.
Mr. Hearst, I have been reading your column in
the Examiner for several months now and I have been
reading the editorials in your paper as well. The first
thing I noticed about this paper of yours was the
motto on the front page over the name plate. It says
"America First." When I read that I remembered.
You are a patriotic man, Mr. Hearst. You wave
the flag each day and holler, "America First." But
you are not fooling a lot of us, Mr. Hearst. We know
better. We remember that Laval waved the flag and
hollered, "France First"; that Quisling waved the flag
and hollered, "Norway First." We remember that and
then we come to realize what those slogans mean.
Then we know what you mean, Mr. Hearst. We
know what you mean when you say, "America First."
You mean Your kind of America. Your kind of America
would be this kind of America:
a * * *
THIRST of all, we would make a negotiated peace with
Hitler. This would mean allowing him to keep
everything he has already conquered. Then we would
take over the British dominions and reduce the Brit
ish empire to the islands of England. This would make
Germany and the U.S. the dominant powers of the
world. Between us, we would then engage in a holy
crusade to wipe Bolshevism from the earth.
At home in your America, Mr. Hearst, we would
embark on a nationwide drive to line all Communists
up before a firing squad. We would pass enormous
appropriations for Martin Dies, and even create a
dozen or so more Dies committees. We would im
peach the President and throw out the New Deal. We
would abolish the 40-hour week, of course, and maybe
we could even throw out the labor unions. Lindbergh
would be President and the Cabinet would consist of
Patterson, McCormick, Pelley, and Coughlin.
Stop me if I am wrong, Mr. Hearst. But I have
been reading you pretty carefully, and I think I have
read you aright.
The Department of Justice has seen to it that your
friends, Pelley and Coughlin, can not diffuse their
poison through the U.S. mail. But you are smarter
than these two, and perhaps you will not be trapi:>ed
like they were. The slow drip of your poison works
more subtly.
You will go to your grave waving a fiag and shout
ing, "America First," I have no doubt of that, Mr,
Hearst. But you won't be fooling all of us. We know
what you mean.
