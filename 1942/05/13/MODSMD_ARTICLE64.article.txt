DENY US NOT
(Note: Juniors and seniors may recall Hortensc
Figgins. She was the bulwark between former Bull
Scssioner Sherman MellinkolT and Women's Rights.)
pjULL SESSIONER, SIR:
Women's Rights have been vindicated. The stupid
suggestion that women be closeted up in their rooms
as soon as 1:30 a.m. rolls around has been squashed.
What do some pople think they are doing? First they
deprive us of hundreds of gorgeous sailors and then
they want to stifle us by compulsory curfews. The
whole thing is ridiculous.
At last Stanford women have found in inexhaustible
fountain of men, via the U. 5.0., and immediately up
crops a suggestion that we be denied the privilege of
free association with these brave souls. The whole
thing makes my blood boil.
Mary Lou Linsley, Lagunita, in her statement to
the press, brought forth a pertinent fact. "I think,"
she said, "the boys will stay out anyway by them
selves." And with whom do you think they will stay
out? I for one shudder to think. Stanford women will
not hand their men over to the girls of Mayfield and
Redwood City without a struggle, you may be sure.
Sylvia Berry says that "Norm in wartime is a
different Norm." I don't know who this Norm is that
she goes around with, but if he is anything like my
Bill, then we want more late leaves, not fewer. Just
remember, the girls in Australia and Ireland, and
Egypt aren't going to be restrained by any 1:30 lock
ups, no sir.
I just hope that the fellows clip out the results of
Monday's poll and paste it on the wall near their tele
phone. If they do then those girls that voted for the
silly plan will be sorry. It will jolly well serve the
Dee Gees and Thetas right if those phone calls be
come fewer and farther apart.
Another thing. There are going to be a lot fewer
cars here next year. That means more walking and
less driving. Have those girls that voted for this
ridiculous measure stopped to consider that while you
can drive down from the golf course in less than five
minutes, it takes a good deal longer to walk it?
Stanford women have again proven that they will
not be regimented. The war will soon make make- men
harder to get so why should Women's Conference add
to the difficulties?
Steadfastly yours,
Hortense F ggins
