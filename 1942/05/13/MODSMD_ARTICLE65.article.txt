## J'ACCUSE 
### 
r rHE EDITOR. SIR:
We object to the action of a committee, not rep
resentative of Stanford women, as is evident by the
result of the poll, to reconsider or modify the late
leave system. Such a proposal should, in the first
place, have found its origin with the students them
selves, instead of with the administration. But since
it has now been decisively voted down, there should
be no further discussion of the matter, unless this
committee will openly admit that they d< not choose
to act in accordance with the democratic process of
student self-government.
We object further to the way in which this commit
tee was instructed to propagandize the vomen students
into supporting this proposition, instead of permitting
them to vote without coercion. It his come to our
attention that those living groups th it voted in favor
of this proposition did so because they were strongly
influenced by some member of the original committee.
As an illustration of the dictatorial attitude of this
committee, we cite the fact that this group refused to
admit one of their members to the Women's Confer
ence meeting, because she was s'.rongly opposed to the
measure.
Further attempts will undoubtedly be made to rail
road this proposal through. V/e women students should
refuse to reconsider it, if for no other reason than the
principles involved.
Sincerely yours.
