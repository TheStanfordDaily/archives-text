### DEFENSE OF 2:30'S 
HTHE EDITOR, SIR:
Regarding the proposed change
of 2:30 late leaves to l:3o's, although
it will not affect us, we have this to
say:
1. The decision of using tires for
driving to the city should be an en
tirely personal matter and seems to
need no enforcement by authorities.
2. We realize that the lack of tires
will regulate the number of trips
made to the city, but undoubtedly
groups will want to use the train for
the purpose. The obvious train to
catch back leaves the city at 12:15
and arrives in Paly at I:4o—a little
late to make a 1:30.
3. Regarding the health and study
angle there will certainly be less
men on campus next year; and there
fore, fewer dates so that, though
2:3o's are kept, there will be fewer
late leaves used.
4. If the petting and necking angle
is involved, may we say that the re
duced time will not eliminate it be
cause such pursuits do not depend
on the hour.
5. The proposed change gives the
advantage to people with homes in
the city, for they will be able to
spend th% extra time in recreation
that others will spend getting back
to campus.
6. They say this is a war-time
measure, but—
7. The few times that people will
get to go to the city next year seem
to make it all the more desirable to
have fun and do it up brown while
they are there.
8. Surely (he ones who brought
this matter up should have enough
faith in the student's common sense
and ability to handle their own so
cial life. The administration seems
to have this faith, as evinced by the
fact that the proposal did not come
from them.
Yours for the defense of
civil liberties,
