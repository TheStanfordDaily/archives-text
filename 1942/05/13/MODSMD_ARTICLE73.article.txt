# Choir to Perform On Mutual Hookup
## 
### 
The University Choir will sing
over the Mutural Broadcasting Sys
tem, Sunday at 2 p.m., on the pro
gram "1 Hear America Singing."
The program will not be heard on
the West Coast, however, as the sta
tion has a commercial feature at
that hour.
The program will include Negro
spirituals, an anthem composed by
Dr. Allen for the fiftieth anniversary
celebration, and Stanford songs. Be
cause the choir is leaving early for
San Francisco, it will not participate
in the 11 o'clock service. Joseph
Running, assistant organist, will lead
a smaller group who will sing at
that time.
Don't discuss naval shore con
struction projects.
