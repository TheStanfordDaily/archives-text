One Thing
Americans
Can't Do
Without
We can get along without
rubber . . . without sugar
. . . without scores of
other so-called "necessi
ties"
But Americans can't do
without health
health is the priceless as
set of victory. Priceless to
our fighting men . . .
priceless to our wartime
producers and home mak
ers .. . priceless to all
our citizens.
