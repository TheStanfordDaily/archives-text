# Fashion Show, Taxi Dance To Highlight 'War Fair' Today, 3-6, in Union Patio
## Ten-Cent Defense Stamps Serve As Price of Admission; Proceeds To Go to Dimes-for-Diplomas Fund 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
A ten-cent defense stamp will give the purchaser an unprecedented
amount of return on this Stamp Day, if students buy the stamps which are
serving as script for the War Fair being sponsored by Women's Confer
ence in Union Patio this afternoon from 3 to 6.
Svelte co-eds and Farm men will model war clothes in the style show

at the Clubhouse from 4 to 5. Roble,
queens will reign at a taxi dance
from 3 to 4 and from 5 to G in the
Nitery. Victory punch and cakes
made with sugar substitutes will be
sold. And anyone can have a chance
to give Hitler a black eye.
DIME DEFENSE STAMPS
Here is a chance to contribute
Dimes for Diplomas, since the
stamps will go into the Diplomas'
fund. Just put a ten-cent defense
stamp across the counter, say the
sponsors.
Brownlee Corrin of Gaieties fame
is the style show barker and Isa
belle Fawcett is the commentator for
the different styles. A movie of
clothes designing in Quebec will be
added to the program. Men's styles
won't be neglected.
The purpose of the show is to give
Stanford men and women an idea of
the type of clothes they will be
wearing for the duration. Styles are
already changing to conform to war
regulations with narrower skirts,
narrowed belts, narrower hems, and
no more full sleeves.
INTERIOR MATERIALS
"In the future," says Eleanor
Judell, "clothes will cost as much
but the material will be far infe
rior to what we have become used
to." Information on determining the
quality of material will be given in
the show.
A six-by-six portrait of Hitler
marked off in squares has been pre
pared by Sylvia Berry's stamp com
mittee for the Fair. The privilege of
painting in one of these squares can
be had for a ten-cent stamp until
der Fuehrer has met with a com
plete blackout.
MEN TO MODEL
Models for the fashion show are:
Jack Dana and John Eikleman,
who will show what the rough will
wear in wartime; Betty Boardman,
Janice Bradbury, Lyn Croft, Char
lotte Drea, Barbara Gastil, Peggy
Ingham, Molly Malone, Barbara
Moore, Peggy Perring, Martha Mc-
Comb, and Francis Lengfeld, who
will model the styles to replace full
skirts and big sleeves.
If nothing else strikes the inter
est of the Stanford man—the chance
to be patriotic and dance with a
Roble woman at the same time
should have the appeal that will
bring in an all-time high in defense
.stamps for the Dimes for Diplomas
Fund.

ence in Union Patio this afternoon from 3 to 6.
Svelte co-eds and Farm men will model war clothes in the style show

at the Clubhouse from 4 to 5. Roble,
queens will reign at a taxi dance
from 3 to 4 and from 5 to G in the
Nitery. Victory punch and cakes
made with sugar substitutes will be
sold. And anyone can have a chance
to give Hitler a black eye.
DIME DEFENSE STAMPS
Here is a chance to contribute
Dimes for Diplomas, since the
stamps will go into the Diplomas'
fund. Just put a ten-cent defense
stamp across the counter, say the
sponsors.
Brownlee Corrin of Gaieties fame
is the style show barker and Isa
belle Fawcett is the commentator for
the different styles. A movie of
clothes designing in Quebec will be
added to the program. Men's styles
won't be neglected.
The purpose of the show is to give
Stanford men and women an idea of
the type of clothes they will be
wearing for the duration. Styles are
already changing to conform to war
regulations with narrower skirts,
narrowed belts, narrower hems, and
no more full sleeves.
INTERIOR MATERIALS
"In the future," says Eleanor
Judell, "clothes will cost as much
but the material will be far infe
rior to what we have become used
to." Information on determining the
quality of material will be given in
the show.
A six-by-six portrait of Hitler
marked off in squares has been pre
pared by Sylvia Berry's stamp com
mittee for the Fair. The privilege of
painting in one of these squares can
be had for a ten-cent stamp until
der Fuehrer has met with a com
plete blackout.
MEN TO MODEL
Models for the fashion show are:
Jack Dana and John Eikleman,
who will show what the rough will
wear in wartime; Betty Boardman,
Janice Bradbury, Lyn Croft, Char
lotte Drea, Barbara Gastil, Peggy
Ingham, Molly Malone, Barbara
Moore, Peggy Perring, Martha Mc-
Comb, and Francis Lengfeld, who
will model the styles to replace full
skirts and big sleeves.
If nothing else strikes the inter
est of the Stanford man—the chance
to be patriotic and dance with a
Roble woman at the same time
should have the appeal that will
bring in an all-time high in defense
.stamps for the Dimes for Diplomas
Fund.
A ten-cent defense stamp will give the purchaser an unprecedented
amount of return on this Stamp Day, if students buy the stamps which are
serving as script for the War Fair being sponsored by Women's Confer
ence in Union Patio this afternoon from 3 to 6.
