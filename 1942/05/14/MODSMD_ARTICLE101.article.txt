# P.C. Schools Lead In War Activities
## 
### 
Proximity to bomb - shattered
Pearl Harbor of last December is
probably the reason why the war
programs of Pacific Coast colleges
are much farther advanced than of
other schools in the nation.
Both in organization and gen
eral scope of activities Stanford is
head and shoulders above almost
anyone else," reports Shorty Gran
nis, senior debater who recently
returned from a forensic tour dur
ing which universities all over the
United States were visited. Also
leading on the Coast are the Uni
versity of Washington and the Uni
versity of California.
DIFFERENT PROBLEMS
Several of the problems faced br
other schools are different from
those at Stanford. Many colleges,
suchn as California and U.S.C., are
located within cities, and the city
takes care of the defense organiza
tion. The part of the college is very
small.
Except in the Coast cities, there
is no fear of bombing, and disas
ter preparations have not been
made. In the Middle West, par
ticularly, there have been no black
outs or practice drills of any kind.
An exception is the University of
Chicago, where one blackout has
been held. Even on the East Coast,
where the danger is recognized,
the organization is not as efficient
as ours, according to Grannis.
Most colleges have not had the
same problem Stanford has in re
gard to the curtailment of off-cam
pus social activities, since many of
them possess excellent Student Un
ion buildings which provide ade
quate facilities for on-campus ac
tivities. While use of these has in
creased, the change has not been
so great.
STAMPS AND BONDS
One of the most widespread ac
tivities is the encouragement of
sales of war stamps and bonds.
Most Coast colleges have organ
ized drivesâ€”Los Angeles City Col
lege, for instance, has a "Victory
Shack*' on campus where student
council members sell stamps ev
ery day. The University of Oregon
and the University of San Fran
cisco have both done outstanding
work in this field.
One of the most unique methods
of promoting sales has been devised
1 >y the University of California.
Etch day the number of enemy
planes shot down is posted, and
smdents are asked to contribute
pennies equal to the number of
planes. The money collected this
way is put into a Liberty Scholar

ship Fund, similar to Stanford's
Dimes for Diplomas.
SUMMER FARM WORK
Also at Cal. a student committee
is co-operating with the Slate De
partment of Agriculture in spon
soring summer work groups to
help in the harvesting of farm
crops.
A great many schools have
adopted some form of physical fit
ness program. At the University
of Illinois, for instance, all men
are required to spend five hours a
week in some physical activity,
with body-contact sports empha
sized. At several schools, includ
ing U.C.L.A. and U.S.C., the physi
cal education requirement has been

raised, and there has been some
discussion of the problem of bring
ing non-athletic instruction into
the physical fitness program by
minimizing competitive events and
stressing such activities as hiking
and informal recreational pro
grams.
Almost all colleges are offering
courses similar to Stanford's "Prob
lems of War and Peace."
In the field of consumer educa
tion, most schools are just begin
ning to realize its importance and
to organize work along this line.
Almost every college is on a 12-
month schedule, and is urging its
students to take full advantage of
summer sessions.
