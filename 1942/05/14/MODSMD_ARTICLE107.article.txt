# Stanford of 1918 Sacrificed For War; Marched and Fought
## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Stanford, getting into the swing
of war economy, has given up big
name bands for campus dances. ...
but not without a certain lack of
enthusiasm and argument. In the
first World War, the Farm gave up
the Senior Week balls and banquets
altogether, to symbolize the war
spirit of the University.
Though there was no fear of an
enemy invasion in the last war,
more dramatic displays of rah, rah
patriotism were evident on the
campus. Military paradec stirred
up the fighting spirit of the stu
dents. Roughs and the Five Hun
dred joined together at mass rallies
to wave flags and listen to the mili
tary band music.
Madame Schumann-Heink and a
soldier chorus of 10,000 voices gath
ered together on Sunday, June 9,
1918, to sing popular and patriotic
songs in the world's largest mu
sical event. Proceeds of the affair
went to finance the Stanford Wo
men's Unit in France.
LOCAL ARMY MARCHES
OVER HILL AND DALE
Under Major Bugge, professor of
military training and tactics, stu-

dent soldiers
inarched in uni
form, some
times in double
time, all over
the roads and
hills around
French m a n' s
Lake and May
field country
.... taking
their lunch and

spending the entire day.
Talk of summer quarter work
was prevalent on campus in the
last war as it is now. The first

summer quarter of campus his
tory in 1918 saw 388 stu
dents enrolled.
Measles were the least of the
University troubles then .... an
epidemic of Spanish flu had reached
such major proportions that im
promptu hospitals had to be ar
ranged for at the A.T.0., Delt, Fiji,
and Theta Chi fraternities. Stu
dents couldn't leave campus, social
gatherings were banned, and in Oc
tober influenza masks were ordered
to be worn in all classes.
Every student was a committee
man by choice, and every one
turned out his best on campus
drives, such as $56,000 contributed
toward Belgian Relief by March
1919.
FUND DRIVES NET
SIZEABLE SUMS
Students, faculty, and alumni
contributed $30,000 to send the
Stanford Women's Unit for Civilian
Relief in France overseas.
Every day was Stamp Day and
by February, 1919. the Farm's stu
dents had purchased $12,601.20 in
War Savings Stamps. For awhile
the postoffice averaged a thousand
dollars a month in War Stamps.
Five ambulance units were sent
ovci'seas, one of them the Stanford-
Italian Ambulance Unit. In 1917
the Oaily Palo Alto announced —
"Stanford's second unit of ambu
lance drivers for the French front
is busy in preparing for service.
The men are taking up an intensive
study of French and Fords in spe
cial classes to be as fit as possible
to meet demands in France."
Stanford women did their part
by working for national service
committees and at the outbreak of
the war the Five Hundred peti
tioned for Red Cross classes and

for instruction in auto mechanics,
but in both cases were turned
down.
TWO-BY-FOUR FIELD
FOR AIRPLANES
An airdrome was built in con
nection with aeronautic work on
campus. It was located just behind
the Union and was about the same
size as Ihe Engineering Building.
At the beginning of the United
States' entrance into the war, cam
pus fraternities decided to disband
for the duration. They planned to
maintain one house for joint usage.

The Students
Army Training
Corps, made up
of men who were
either too young
for the draft or
who had been
unable to make

the physical requirements, blos
somed out in full uniform and gave
the campus a military air. One
hundred naval men, incorporated
in the large group, added variety.
To accommodate the men, Se
quoia Hall and the fraternity
houses on the lower end of the
Row were turned into dorms with
student proctors in charge. Mess
tents were erected back of Encina,
which had been taken over by the
army.
Palo Alto was with Stanford 100
per cent in its war effort. In the
April 23, 1917. edition of the Daily
Palo Alto a dark-type notice read:
"At the first meeling of the Palo
Alto Garden Club it was officially
decided that the organization would
further production of the bean plant
to the exclusion of all others.
"Though the bean be homely it
is a beautiful plant especially in
times of war .... they can be

grown in flower pots, hedges, along
curbs, in front yard, everywhere
curbs, in front yard.
The only war sirens on campus
during the last war didn't usher in
a blackout they sounded near
midnight on November 11, 1918. and
a parade with military band and
shouts of pure joy heralded the
news of international peace
the war to end all wars was over.

SIZEABLE SUMS
Students, faculty, and alumni
contributed $30,000 to send the
Stanford Women's Unit for Civilian
Relief in France overseas.
Every day was Stamp Day and
by February, 1919. the Farm's stu
dents had purchased $12,601.20 in
War Savings Stamps. For awhile
the postoffice averaged a thousand
dollars a month in War Stamps.
Five ambulance units were sent
ovci'seas, one of them the Stanford-
Italian Ambulance Unit. In 1917
the Oaily Palo Alto announced —
"Stanford's second unit of ambu
lance drivers for the French front
is busy in preparing for service.
The men are taking up an intensive
study of French and Fords in spe
cial classes to be as fit as possible
to meet demands in France."
Stanford women did their part
by working for national service
committees and at the outbreak of
the war the Five Hundred peti
tioned for Red Cross classes and

for instruction in auto mechanics,
but in both cases were turned
down.
TWO-BY-FOUR FIELD
FOR AIRPLANES
An airdrome was built in con
nection with aeronautic work on
campus. It was located just behind
the Union and was about the same
size as Ihe Engineering Building.
At the beginning of the United
States' entrance into the war, cam
pus fraternities decided to disband
for the duration. They planned to
maintain one house for joint usage.

The Students
Army Training
Corps, made up
of men who were
either too young
for the draft or
who had been
unable to make

the physical requirements, blos
somed out in full uniform and gave
the campus a military air. One
hundred naval men, incorporated
in the large group, added variety.
To accommodate the men, Se
quoia Hall and the fraternity
houses on the lower end of the
Row were turned into dorms with
student proctors in charge. Mess
tents were erected back of Encina,
which had been taken over by the
army.
Palo Alto was with Stanford 100
per cent in its war effort. In the
April 23, 1917. edition of the Daily
Palo Alto a dark-type notice read:
"At the first meeling of the Palo
Alto Garden Club it was officially
decided that the organization would
further production of the bean plant
to the exclusion of all others.
"Though the bean be homely it
is a beautiful plant especially in
times of war .... they can be

grown in flower pots, hedges, along
curbs, in front yard, everywhere
curbs, in front yard.
The only war sirens on campus
during the last war didn't usher in
a blackout they sounded near
midnight on November 11, 1918. and
a parade with military band and
shouts of pure joy heralded the
news of international peace
the war to end all wars was over.


Stanford, getting into the swing
of war economy, has given up big
name bands for campus dances. ...
but not without a certain lack of
enthusiasm and argument. In the
first World War, the Farm gave up
the Senior Week balls and banquets
altogether, to symbolize the war
spirit of the University.
Though there was no fear of an
enemy invasion in the last war,
more dramatic displays of rah, rah
patriotism were evident on the
campus. Military paradec stirred
up the fighting spirit of the stu
dents. Roughs and the Five Hun
dred joined together at mass rallies
to wave flags and listen to the mili
tary band music.
Madame Schumann-Heink and a
soldier chorus of 10,000 voices gath
ered together on Sunday, June 9,
1918, to sing popular and patriotic
songs in the world's largest mu
sical event. Proceeds of the affair
went to finance the Stanford Wo
men's Unit in France.
