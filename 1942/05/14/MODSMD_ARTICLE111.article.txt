# Farm Contributes Blood To Save Soldiers' Lives
## 
### 
Participating in the all-out war
effort. Stanford students are giving
their blood as well as their work
and money.
The organization of a mobile unit
of the American Red Ci'oss Blood
Donor Service has made it possible
for men and women from the Farm
to donate blood to the Red Cross
blood bank regularly. In the vis
its of the mobile unit to Palo Alto
every two weeks, a regular quota
of donors is assigned the campus,
usually between 20 and 30.
Any student may be a donor.
The campus Red Cross Committee
signs them up and makes their ap
pointments for the next visit of the
blood bank unit. Students under
21 must have their parents' con
sent, and all donors should be in
good health. There are no other
restrictions.
'MORAL SUPPORT'
Appointments for students are
made for the same times, so that
donors may have each other's
moral support. The Red Cross
Motor Corps provides transpor
tation for each group to and from
the Palo Alto Community Center,
where the blood bank is based.
The process of donating blood is
neither dangerous nor painful, ac
cording to Stanford's first group of
donors. Temperature, blood pres
sure, hemoglobin count, and pulse
of donors is taken. They lie down,
arms are anaesthetized with a drop
of novocaine, and a hollow needle
introduced into the vein. Through
the attached tube the blood flows
into a bottle.
No more than a pint of blood is
taken at one time. The process
takes about 30 minutes. After a
short rest, refreshments are served
and the donors are taken home.
Each donor is awarded a bronze
button of honor.
The blood is taken to central

laboratories. There the plasma is
separated by centrifuging,and then
dried and powdered. In this form
it will keep for years and can be
sent anywhere. It is packed in units
with the necessary distilled water
and needle and it's instantly avail
able for transfusions. '" ■
IT'S NEEDED
The plasma is as gCtbcF as, and
in many cases bettei* than, the
usual type of transfusion. No
blood-typing is necessary. The
government has asked the Red
Cross to obtain at leafet a million
pints for the use of both service
and civilian casualties. -•
Students wishing to donate blood
should sign up at the Student War
Office, Room 13 in the Old Union.
Blanks to be signed by the parents
or guardians of donors under 21
may be obtained there. The mobile
blood unit will visit Palo Alto ev
ery other Thursday for at. least 18
months, and Stanford will be ex
pected to have its quota, present
each time. Donations by the same
person should not be made more
than every two months.—-
