# Stanford Preparesâ€”For Those Bombs
## 
### 
Since December 7, precautions
against air raids have progressed
steadily on campus, with construc
tion of shelters and blackout rooms
as well as equipping all campus
buildings with cans of sand.
Recreation rooms at Roble have
been converted to serve as air
raid shelters from almost anything
but a direct bomb hit or gas. The
shelters are in the basement, and
the windows are protected by foot
thick brick walls. All of the living
halls have facilities for study dur

ing blackouts.
Windows in the Education Build
ing have been blacked out. These
and the radio laboratory, Room
300, are (he only school rooms that
are blocked out now. At Encina
the dining rooms are blacked out
and fitted with light locks. That
is, they have baffle entrances so
the doors may be opened during a
blackout without letting out light.
Other precautions are warnings
to turn out the lights when leaving
rooms on the Quad and the now

familiar buckets of sand and shiny
new shovels which are strategi
cally located around the Univer
sity.
