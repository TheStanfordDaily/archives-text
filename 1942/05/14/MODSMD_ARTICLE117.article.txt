# Double Duty
## 
### 
(An Editorial)
On every side of us today we hear the cry that it takes money
to win a war. This no one will deny. Already this war has
cost our nation far more than the total expenditure of the first
World War. And as one man we must get behind the movement
to furnish our government with every single dollar it needs to
fight this war to the finish. We must buy more and more and
more war stamps and bonds.
BUT, let us not lose sight of the fact that it also takes money
to carry on the vital work Stanford is doing in the national war
program. For Stanford is fighting this war just as much as the
men on the front. And it takes money to keep war research
humming in our laboratories; it takes money to train the engi
neers. the doctors, the technicians, and the leaders needed to
win the war.
Eighteen thousand donors in the past have made possible
the impressive war record being made by Stanford today. But
it will take a constant flow of gifts to carry on the job Stanford
must continue to do in this crisis. Such gifts are the very life
blood of an endowed university, more so today than ever before.
You can help your nation and your university at the same
time. Make your money do double duty—invest in war bonds
and give them to Stanford.
