# BLOOD ... TO SAVE LIVES
## 
### 
The government is asking for
thousands of units of human blood
a month to be used in transfusions
to save the lives of men in our
armed forces suffering from shock,
hemorrhage, or bums.

An $18.75 bond buys one Marine
field telephone, one Navy flying
jacket, or three anti-tank shells.

A pledge: "I will buy carefully,
I will take good care of the things
I have, I will waste nothing."
