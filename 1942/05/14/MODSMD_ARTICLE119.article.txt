# Dean Mary Foresees New Design For Living
## 
### DEAN MARY YOST 
When you, individual student of
Stanford, man or woman, consider
what contribution you can make to
the war effort, realize first that you
are not a member of a special group
V/hich has little or no relationship
to the war, but that in very truth
you belong to a nationwide com
munity, vitally concerned with the
war and taking a vital part in it.
Then, as an actor in, not a spec
tator of, this total effort of your
country, do your job as a student
with the same seriousness of pur
pose, the same determination to do
your best which you expect mem
bers of our armed forces, nurses on
duty, men and women workers in
our defense industries to show.
URAIN POWER NEEDED
Your country has said it has need
for men and women trained in spe
cial fields and trained also through
the development of their mental
powers and of those talents which
will contribute to the common good
in the years ahead. You are the
men and women in a position to
meet this need and Stanford Uni
versity is where you can get your
training.
Work, then, as you have never
worked before—longer hours, heav
ier schedules, four quarters a year
instead of three if possible. If fac
tory workers under the conditions
many have to work, can stand 40
or 48 hours a week, you can stand
this speeded-up program. The fac
ility and staff here are carrying
heavier loads than ever before.
Many students are. Be one of
them.
BE OF SERVICE
Now, as never before, you have
he chance to take your place as a
member of a community; not one
which is of your age and interests
only, but of all ages and wide in
terests. Find a place where you
can be of service to this commun
ity.
Take part in one or more of the
Various branches of Red Cross
work. Volunteer for special duty
.Mich as fire, police, messenger
.service. Be an intelligent consumer
and an intelligent conserver not
only of your own possessions but
ci those of the community.
if the labor shortage continues to
increase, see where volunteer serv

ice in your dormitory, houses, or
on our grounds can be used and
offer help.
FACE THE FACTS
Recognize the great problems
facing those in charge of your liv
ing groups and of the physical plant
here and by your cheerful co-op
eration and lack of an under
standing criticism assist in their
solution. Find that good fun in a
place like this can be had without
reducing your bank account or
that of your parents, and spend
your savings on war bonds and war
stamps.
To make a real contribution to
the war effort along the lines sug
gested above, you must keep phys
ically and mentally fit. Exercise,
sleep and recreation which builds
up physical reserves and does not
sap them, you must have. Laugh
ter, comradeship, and enjoyment of
our beautiful campus should be a
part of your program.
'CUT THE DEAD WOOD'
You can't follow these sugges
tions by adding to your already
full days. You and your fellow
students must look carefully at the
whole design of living here and cut
out what may have been very use
ful at one time, but may be dead
wood now.
Student government has already
recognized this fact and is working
to make necessary changes. Help
with clear thinking. Don't hinder
with futile bewailings of what has
been.
A new pattern for your individ
ual life and for the community life
of the students must inevitably be
made. Make it with high courage,
a sense of adventure, and a deter
mination to preserve in it real
democracy, integrity and a respect
for the contributions which trained
and intelligent men and women
can make to the community.

recognized this fact and is working
to make necessary changes. Help
with clear thinking. Don't hinder
with futile bewailings of what has
been.
A new pattern for your individ
ual life and for the community life
of the students must inevitably be
made. Make it with high courage,
a sense of adventure, and a deter
mination to preserve in it real
democracy, integrity and a respect
for the contributions which trained
and intelligent men and women
can make to the community.
When you, individual student of
Stanford, man or woman, consider
what contribution you can make to
the war effort, realize first that you
are not a member of a special group
V/hich has little or no relationship
to the war, but that in very truth
you belong to a nationwide com
munity, vitally concerned with the
war and taking a vital part in it.
Then, as an actor in, not a spec
tator of, this total effort of your
country, do your job as a student
with the same seriousness of pur
pose, the same determination to do
your best which you expect mem
bers of our armed forces, nurses on
duty, men and women workers in
our defense industries to show.
URAIN POWER NEEDED
Your country has said it has need
for men and women trained in spe
cial fields and trained also through
the development of their mental
powers and of those talents which
will contribute to the common good
in the years ahead. You are the
men and women in a position to
meet this need and Stanford Uni
versity is where you can get your
training.
Work, then, as you have never
worked before—longer hours, heav
ier schedules, four quarters a year
instead of three if possible. If fac
tory workers under the conditions
many have to work, can stand 40
or 48 hours a week, you can stand
this speeded-up program. The fac
ility and staff here are carrying
heavier loads than ever before.
Many students are. Be one of
them.
BE OF SERVICE
Now, as never before, you have
he chance to take your place as a
member of a community; not one
which is of your age and interests
only, but of all ages and wide in
terests. Find a place where you
can be of service to this commun
ity.
Take part in one or more of the
Various branches of Red Cross
work. Volunteer for special duty
.Mich as fire, police, messenger
.service. Be an intelligent consumer
and an intelligent conserver not
only of your own possessions but
ci those of the community.
if the labor shortage continues to
increase, see where volunteer serv

ice in your dormitory, houses, or
on our grounds can be used and
offer help.
FACE THE FACTS
Recognize the great problems
facing those in charge of your liv
ing groups and of the physical plant
here and by your cheerful co-op
eration and lack of an under
standing criticism assist in their
solution. Find that good fun in a
place like this can be had without
reducing your bank account or
that of your parents, and spend
your savings on war bonds and war
stamps.
To make a real contribution to
the war effort along the lines sug
gested above, you must keep phys
ically and mentally fit. Exercise,
sleep and recreation which builds
up physical reserves and does not
sap them, you must have. Laugh
ter, comradeship, and enjoyment of
our beautiful campus should be a
part of your program.
'CUT THE DEAD WOOD'
You can't follow these sugges
tions by adding to your already
full days. You and your fellow
students must look carefully at the
whole design of living here and cut
out what may have been very use
ful at one time, but may be dead
wood now.
Student government has already
recognized this fact and is working
to make necessary changes. Help
with clear thinking. Don't hinder
with futile bewailings of what has
been.
A new pattern for your individ
ual life and for the community life
of the students must inevitably be
made. Make it with high courage,
a sense of adventure, and a deter

and intelligent men and women
can make to the community.
