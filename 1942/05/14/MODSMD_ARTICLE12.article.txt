# HONOR CODE PLANS STATED
## 
### 
With student opinion against the
flat penalty of expulsion for Honor
Code violations, three alternatives
for handling violations by students
were recommended to the student
body yesterday by Women's and
Men's Councils after a joint mect
| ing.
Conclusion announced by the
, Councils were based on the Honor
Code poll conducted a week ago
| among campus organizations. In
announcing the decisions, Council
Chairmen Helen Kimball and Bob
i Morton urged students not to take
examinations from the classrooms
unless the facilities provided arc
! inadequate.
SUGGESTED IMPROVEMENTS
Improvements are being suggested
; by the Councils in classes which
i they know to be overcrowded. How
ever, the chairmen said, a great part
I of the responsibility of the student is
to see that the Honor Code is up
held.
Conclusions of t.he Councils are:
"From the poll we concluded that
student opinion is against the flat
penalty of expulsion, and we will
; consider this in judging Honor Code

| violations.
I "In the poll, people wondered
what, they should do if they see a
violation. It is recommended they
contact the head of Men's or Wom
en's Council and if thus is not feas
ible they may do it by letter. All
names involved in Honor Code vio
lations arc kept in strict confidencc.
If a person hesitates to go to council
it is suggested he discuss the vio
lation with the professor. If the stu
dent thinks he will do more good by
going to the individual that is an
other alternative.
STUDENTS PART
i "Since in the definition of the
I Honor Code it states that part of
the responsibility of the student is to
see that it is upheld, we encourage
students not to take examinations
I from the classrooms unless the fa
cilities provided are inadequate. In
reference to this we arc suggesting
I improvement in classes which wc
| know to be over-crowded. Further
more we would appreciate any in-
I formation or suggestions concerning
! such classes.
"It is also suggested that profes
' sors should make clear the applica

tion of the Honor Code in their indi
vidual courses."
The section of the constitution
applying to the Honor Code states
"that students will not give or re
ceive aid in examinations; that they
will not pive or receive unpermit
ted aid in class work, in the prepa
ration of reports, or in any other
work that is to be used as the basis
of grading; that they will not vio
late the rules of the library by tak
ing without permission from the
library, or by injuring any book,
pamphlet or other document bo
longing to its collection; and that
they will do their share and take an
active part, in seeing to it that others
as well as themselves obey the
spirit and the letter of the Honor
Code. The University on its part
manifests its confidence in the honor
of its students by refraining from
proctoring examinations, or other
wise taking special steps to prevent
the forms of dishonesty mentioned
above."
Two thousand questionnaires were
distributed to students during the
poll, which was "very successful,"
according to the chairmen.
