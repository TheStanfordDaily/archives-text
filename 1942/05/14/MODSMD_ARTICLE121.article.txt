# Peace-time Responsibilities Emphasized During War
## 
### DEAN JOHN BUNN 
It was my firm conviction as a
coach of athletic teams that the
standards and training practices
for competition should be contin
ued for everyday life. If the ath
lete is stronger, healthier, and
more efficient as a result of his
training, then certainly as a citi
zen he would profit by following
these same principles.
These statements can be applied
for the purpose at hand. Our ac
tivities in war should be no differ
ent from those in peace. We should
have been doing in peacetime all
the things that now seem to be

self-evident.
INVEST OUR ABILITIES
Specifically, we should be sure
that we inventory our abilities in
telligently, and then proceed to
invest and manage our time to
ward the most efficient develop
ment of these abilities. We should
keep ourselves physically fit.
We should conserve money, ma
terials, energy, and contribute ev
ery possible bit of it to the job at
hand.
LOOKING TO THE PEACE
We must keep our minds open
and our eyes toward the future,
so that we can work out the post

war adjustment period intelli
gently/
Lastly we should be more con
scious than ever of our moral and
spiritual well-being. How else can
we withstand successfully the de
bilitating impact of hatred, suffer
ing, sorrow, and the feeling of
hopelessness in the future.
The University at all times car
ries a tremendous responsibility.
Now it must develop the leader
ship and the brain power in order
that this present task can be suc
cessfully concluded and progress
of mankind may go on. I have
faith that, our Stanford student
body will meet and continue to
meet this challenge.
It must not happen here. What
ever the cost, the Axis must be
smashed. No price for freedom is
too much. Buy U.S. War Stamps
and Bonds; buy them regularly.
