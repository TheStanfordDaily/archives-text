# Motor Club Tells How To Keep Car Running
## 
### 
Careful and complete servicing
Of personal automobiles is being
urged by the American Automobile
Association in an effort to awaken
Americans to the drastic need for
car economy.
Often the privately-owned pas
senger car is the only means of
transportation available to the
army of American workers in the
widespread war industries, accord
ing to the Association, and since
the production of new automobiles
has been restricted because of war
needs, it is necessary to take par
ticular care of cars now on the
road.
Suggestions for automobile care
follow:
TIRE PROTECTION
1. Don't drive fast! Speed in
creases friction heat in tires; cords
grow weaker, treads wear faster,
tire life is shortened. At 50 MPH,
tires may be expected to last only
40 per cent as long as at 25 MPH.
Check and inflate tires to proper
pressure once a week. Five pounds
under-inflation cuts tire life 20
per cent.
2. Don't slam wheels against
curbs, over car tracks, or jam on
your brakes. Use brakes intermit
tently, instead of continuously.
Heavy use of brakes without re
leasing pressure may cause a wheel
to lock and slide, thereby grinding
rubber from the tire.
3. Don't permit oil drippings to
remain on garage floor. Oil de
teriorates rubber.
4. Tighten wheel lug nuts occa
sionally. Loose wheels are dan
gerous and cause tires to wear un
evenly.
5. Valve caps are the only posi
tive protection against air leaking
out through the valves. The deli
cate "insides" are only check
valves, whereas the valve caps will
hold air pressure up to 260 pounds.
Never drive without them and do
not tighten with pliers!
6. "Criss-cross" wheels at inter
vals of 5,000 miles, rotating with the
spare to get maximum tire life. Do
not let the spare remain idle as a
spare until the other tires are worn
out because it will deteriorate from
disuse.
7. Wheel alignment is a necessity
for long tire life. When a wheel is
out of alignment the tire tends to
drag sideways.
8. Keep brakes adjusted prop
erly at all times. Uneven braking
causes uneven tire wear.
ENGINE CARE
1. Spark plugs should be kept
free from carbon deposits to insure
efficiency, but they are subject to
damage if carelessly cleaned. The

porcelain should never be scraped
with a knife or other sharp instru
ment. Instead, they should be
wiped clean with a rag saturated
in kerosene or gasoline.
2. An extra pull on the gearshift
lever before the clytch is engaged
is a trick of most good drivers. It
is an assurance that the gears are
fully meshed. The most important
gear combination in which to make
certain of this is second. Engage
ment there is often incomplete.
3. Make sure of engine lubrica
tion because a poorly lubricated
engine uses up too much of its own
power.
4. Keep the carburetor clean.
Dirt in the carburetor prevents
proper mixture of fuel and air for
efficient combustion, resulting in
fewer miles per gallon.
CARE OF BATTERY

1. Radio or
other electrical
equipment, de
pendent upon
the battery,
should not be
operated when
the motor is
not runing.
2. Internal
action causes

an idle battery to slowly discharge
its chemical energy. If the car is
to be placed in storage for any
length of time, the battery should
be delivered to a service agency
for proper care. Ordinarily a fully
charged battery will remain ser
viceable for 30 days without use.

ENGINE CARE
1. Spark plugs should be kept
free from carbon deposits to insure
efficiency, but they are subject to
damage if carelessly cleaned. The

porcelain should never be scraped
with a knife or other sharp instru
ment. Instead, they should be
wiped clean with a rag saturated
in kerosene or gasoline.
2. An extra pull on the gearshift
lever before the clytch is engaged
is a trick of most good drivers. It
is an assurance that the gears are
fully meshed. The most important
gear combination in which to make
certain of this is second. Engage
ment there is often incomplete.
3. Make sure of engine lubrica
tion because a poorly lubricated
engine uses up too much of its own
power.
4. Keep the carburetor clean.
Dirt in the carburetor prevents
proper mixture of fuel and air for
efficient combustion, resulting in
fewer miles per gallon.
CARE OF BATTERY

1. Radio or
other electrical
equipment, de
pendent upon
the battery,
should not be
operated when
the motor is
not runing.
2. Internal
action causes

an idle battery to slowly discharge
its chemical energy. If the car is
to be placed in storage for any
length of time, the battery should
be delivered to a service agency
for proper care. Ordinarily a fully
charged battery will remain ser
viceable for 30 days without use.

Careful and complete servicing
Of personal automobiles is being
urged by the American Automobile
Association in an effort to awaken
Americans to the drastic need for
car economy.
Often the privately-owned pas
senger car is the only means of
transportation available to the
army of American workers in the
widespread war industries, accord
ing to the Association, and since
the production of new automobiles
has been restricted because of war
needs, it is necessary to take par
ticular care of cars now on the
road.
Suggestions for automobile care
follow:
TIRE PROTECTION
1. Don't drive fast! Speed in
creases friction heat in tires; cords
grow weaker, treads wear faster,
tire life is shortened. At 50 MPH,
tires may be expected to last only
40 per cent as long as at 25 MPH.
Check and inflate tires to proper
pressure once a week. Five pounds
under-inflation cuts tire life 20
per cent.
2. Don't slam wheels against
curbs, over car tracks, or jam on
your brakes. Use brakes intermit
tently, instead of continuously.
Heavy use of brakes without re
leasing pressure may cause a wheel
to lock and slide, thereby grinding
rubber from the tire.
3. Don't permit oil drippings to
remain on garage floor. Oil de
teriorates rubber.
4. Tighten wheel lug nuts occa
sionally. Loose wheels are dan
gerous and cause tires to wear un
evenly.
5. Valve caps are the only posi
tive protection against air leaking
out through the valves. The deli
cate "insides" are only check
valves, whereas the valve caps will
hold air pressure up to 260 pounds.
Never drive without them and do
not tighten with pliers!
6. "Criss-cross" wheels at inter
vals of 5,000 miles, rotating with the
spare to get maximum tire life. Do
not let the spare remain idle as a
spare until the other tires are worn
out because it will deteriorate from
disuse.
7. Wheel alignment is a necessity
for long tire life. When a wheel is
out of alignment the tire tends to
drag sideways.
8. Keep brakes adjusted prop
erly at all times. Uneven braking
causes uneven tire wear.

pressure once a week. Five pounds
under-inflation cuts tire life 20
per cent.
2. Don't slam wheels against
curbs, over car tracks, or jam on
your brakes. Use brakes intermit
tently, instead of continuously.
Heavy use of brakes without re
leasing pressure may cause a wheel
to lock and slide, thereby grinding
rubber from the tire.
3. Don't permit oil drippings to
remain on garage floor. Oil de
teriorates rubber.
4. Tighten wheel lug nuts occa
sionally. Loose wheels are dan
gerous and cause tires to wear un
evenly.
5. Valve caps are the only posi
tive protection against air leaking
out through the valves. The deli
cate "insides" are only check
valves, whereas the valve caps will
hold air pressure up to 260 pounds.
Never drive without them and do
not tighten with pliers!
6. "Criss-cross" wheels at inter
vals of 5,000 miles, rotating with the
spare to get maximum tire life. Do
not let the spare remain idle as a
spare until the other tires are worn
out because it will deteriorate from
disuse.
7. Wheel alignment is a necessity
for long tire life. When a wheel is
out of alignment the tire tends to
drag sideways.
8. Keep brakes adjusted prop
erly at all times. Uneven braking
causes uneven tire wear.
ENGINE CARE
1. Spark plugs should be kept
free from carbon deposits to insure
efficiency, but they are subject to
damage if carelessly cleaned. The

porcelain should never be scraped
with a knife or other sharp instru
ment. Instead, they should be
wiped clean with a rag saturated
in kerosene or gasoline.
2. An extra pull on the gearshift
lever before the clytch is engaged
is a trick of most good drivers. It
is an assurance that the gears are
fully meshed. The most important
gear combination in which to make
certain of this is second. Engage
ment there is often incomplete.
3. Make sure of engine lubrica
tion because a poorly lubricated
engine uses up too much of its own
power.
4. Keep the carburetor clean.
Dirt in the carburetor prevents
proper mixture of fuel and air for
efficient combustion, resulting in
fewer miles per gallon.
CARE OF BATTERY

1. Radio or
other electrical
equipment, de
pendent upon
the battery,
should not be
operated when
the motor is
not runing.
2. Internal
action causes

an idle battery to slowly discharge
its chemical energy. If the car is
to be placed in storage for any
length of time, the battery should
be delivered to a service agency
for proper care. Ordinarily a fully
charged battery will remain ser
viceable for 30 days without use.
