# Invest in War Bonds, Stamps for Victory
## 
### 
The President has stated our ob
jectives. Industry has promised to
fulfill them. The undertaking is so
vast —unparalleled in the history of
the world—that no single life can
remain untouched by it. There is
no section of the land into which it
does not reach.
To wipe the Axis off the face of
the earth, your country must have
money in ever-increasing quanti
ties. The government is asking ev
ery citizen to invest in Bonds and
Stamps now; to sign up for his
share in the freedom which has
made his country great.
