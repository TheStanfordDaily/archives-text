"Voluntary budgeting and con
servation on the part of the mo
torist can contribute much toward
the war effort because the auto
mobile is a vital element of our
national efficiency," the California
State Automobile Association de
clared last week. Civilians should
realize that their automobiles are
no longer their own, but a part of
the nation's transportation system
for the increasing army of defense
workers.
Budget your mileage, the Asso
ciation urges. "Figure out how
many miles were driven last year
for all purposes. Get an estimate
of how many miles the present tire

equipment may be expected to de
liver, and decide how much you

can afford to
drive in the
year ahead.
Then distrib
ute that mile
age over tha

different uses for the car.
"By so doing, tires which might
well be worn out in six months ci
reckless use can be made to serve
for a year or longer without unduo
hardship. In most cases drastic
curtailments in necessary or recre -
ational driving may not be re
quired, but purposeless driving
would be eliminated."
