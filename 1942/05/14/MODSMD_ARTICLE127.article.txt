# Alien Students Not In Draft
## 
### 
Alien students in American col
leges "absolutely do not"' have to
register for selective service. All
they must do is prove to local draft
boards that their non-resident sta
tus is bona fide.
Selective Service officials have
been compelled to reiterate the ex
emption of "non-resident aliens"
because of rumors floating about
that alien students are subject to
military service.
