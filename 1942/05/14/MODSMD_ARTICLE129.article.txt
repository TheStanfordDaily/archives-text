# Conserve' Is Clothing Keynote
## Army Limits Male Styles 
### 
The zoot suits of Hollywood may
be quite the fashion these days, but
there is no question that the cloth
ing industry will go out on a limb
for this latest fad.
The reason, of course, is that the
United States is gripped in the de
manding throes of a bitter war and
the nearest that the clothing manu
facturers are coming toward the
"drape shape" is in uniforms of
navy blue and khaki.
This dots not mean that there is
any particular shortage of neces
sary clothing or that there will be,
but it does mean that today's Stan
ford men cannot afford to buy
sweaters, shoes, pants, shirts and
other clothing which they do not
need. And it means that Farm men
must more and more take better
care of the clothing which they al
ready own.
MILITARY NEEDS FIRST
The amount of new goods put
on the market "for the duration"
will, according to government
reports, depend entirely on the
available supply of textile mate
rial. War contracts will keep a
large majority of the looms busy
making uniforms, parachutes, and
other essential fabrics.
New materials, the government
reports, will be used by the gov
ernment to make uniforms particu
larly. This indicates that the fash
ion trend will be toward tweeds,
since the long-fibered virgin wools
from which worsteds are made will
go to the government for the most
part. Tweeds, however, can easily
be manufactured from short-fibred
used wools.
LIGHTER CLOTHES
Indications also are that men's
clothes will be lighter in weight.
The regulations requiring cuffless
pants and shortening the pant
lengths have already been put into
effect.
But the prime necessity in hav
ing enough to wear in the future
is to take care of the clothes now
owned. This includes brushing and
cleaning clothes whenever neces
sary. hanging up clothes not being
used, and frequent shoe-shining.
