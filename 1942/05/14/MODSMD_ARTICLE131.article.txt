Stanford men and women will
be able to buy only necessities
ill clothing for the duration, ac
cording to co-chairmen of the
Stanford cousumers' committee,
Dodic Crile and George Hellyer.
Instead of the usual smooth
new outfits which Stanfordites in
the past have sported, it will now
be a question of saving all old
clothing. This necessitates Farm
men and women taking particu
larly good care of the clothing
that they now own. While there
will be no immediate shortage of
clothing, every sweater or pair
of pants a Stanfordite buys and
does not need may leave someone
else ill-clothed.
