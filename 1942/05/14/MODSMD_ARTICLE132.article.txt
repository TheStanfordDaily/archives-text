# Wear '42 Styles --And Like It
## 
### 
When America's clothes boss
Harold Stanley Marcus issued his
order last month to freeze the cur
rent styles of women's clothes, pan
ic-stricken females protested that
they wouldn't have attractive styles
to wear next season.
The freezing order, however, is
not so drastic as it seems. Accord
ing to the order, all the frills, the
full dolman sleeves, deep hems,
and two-inch belts will be eliminat
ed in next season's fashions. Skirt
levels were also frozen.
Redingotes will no longer be sold,
but dresses and coats will have to
be bought separately. Three-piece
suits will be sold separately as will
skirts and jackets. This plan, ac
cording to Marcus should save
100,000.000 yards of cloth.
With this plan to prevent radical
style changes, women of the nation
will be able to wear* this year's
clothes for several seasons and to
cut down on their purchases of
new clothes, according to Marcus.
