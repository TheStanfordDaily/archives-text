# Care for Wool, Silk, Says Crile
## 
### 
Unless new clothes are a neces
sity, don't buy them, emphasized
Dodie Crile, co-chairman of the
Stanford consumers committee,
when questioned as to the part
Stanford women must play in the
national war effort.
"When a Stanford woman goes
into Palo Alto and buys a wool
sweater to match her skirt, not for
warmth, she is taking a sweater off
the market which might have been
needed by someone else," said Miss
Crile concerning the vital problem
of conserving silks and wools.
Pointing out that as long as Farm
women with high purchasing power
will pay higher prices for sweaters
and other women's clothes, Miss
Crile said producers will continue
to produce above the necessary
supplies—and thus deter victory.
Miss Crile further stated that the
clothes conservation hints in the
bulletins of the Consumer division
of the OPA are particularly helpful.
These bulletins point out that in
washing woolens lukewarm water
and a mild soap should always be
used, that the rinse water should
be the same temperature as the
washing water, and that the clothes
should be dried out at room tem
perature because excess heat or
sunlight weakens the wool fiber.
One item of special interest in these
bulletins is that thermoplastic resin,
a new and inexpensive mending
material, makes an almost invisible
patch that withstands much laun
dering. In addition, various other
aids to clothing conservation are
given in the bulletins, according to
Miss Crile.
