# War Rations May Affect Campus Diet
## 
### 
Stanfordites may have to go with
out their lunch-time desserts soon,
according to George Hellyer, co
chairman with Dodie Crile of the
Stanford Consumer Education
Committee.
Desserts, in addition to using up
sugar, are non-essentials in the
basic war diet drawn up by the
committee with the aid of Miss
Christine Ricker, directw of dining
halls. r:
According to the committee, an
adequate daily diet, from a nutri
tive standpoint, should consist of:
One pint of milk, three pats of
butter, one egg, one serving of
meat (or fish), one potato, two
servings of fruit, one-third head of
lettuce, three slices of bread, and
cereal.
In addition to proposing the diet,
the committee is also urging the
cooks and managers of all campus
eating groups to get together to
exchange recipes and plans for
economizing on food.
The Consumer Education group
is now trying to enlist the aid of
Pan-Hell and Interfraternity Coun
cils in creating an organization to
foster this "inter-kitchen co-opera
tion."
With the idea of interesting the
individual student in food conserv
ation, the committee is this week
setting up a "Consumer Table" in
the library. On the table will be
placed consumer education maga
zines, and information on war diets,
food rationing, and price ceiling
proposals. A list of radio programs
of interest to consumers will also
be posted from time to time.
