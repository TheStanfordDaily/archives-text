# Houses Hit By Shortage Of Sugar
## 
### 
As a result of difficulties in the
classification of college eating
groups under the sugar rationing
program, some Farm fraternities
and sororities are forced to get
along on as little as three ounces of
sugar per person per week, accord
ing to Elliott Ayres, manager of the
Stanford Commissary.
Most of the Stanford dining
groups have been classified as res
taurants, and are therefore allowed
only fifty per cent of their pro
ration consumption. However, the
two periods upon which the ration
board makes its classifications are
May and June of last year or March
of this year, both periods in which
students were on vacations for part
of the time.
Mr. Ayres, head of the Stanford
Commissary, which buys the food
for all but three of the Farm's fra
ternities, sororities, and eating
clubs, is appealing to the Ration
ing Boai'd at San Jose for a recon
sideration on the basis of undue
hardship, and anticipates straight
ening out of the problem "by the
time school opens."'
He is recommending two plans:
either that the Board take the
groups' previous annual purchases
and divide by 9 to arrive at a just
monthly figure, or that they allow
the groups to purchase an amount
of sugar equal to the combined in
dividual rations of all the persons
eating with the group.
Stating flatly, "there just isn't go
ing to be as much sugar," Mr.
Ayres suggested that Farm caters
learn to use sugar substitutes, such
as honey and corn syrup. Ironical
ly, although there is no restriction
on the purchase of com syrup, it
is not obtainable at present, accord
ing to Mr. Ayres.
