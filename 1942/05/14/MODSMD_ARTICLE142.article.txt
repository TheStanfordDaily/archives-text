# Construction of Chem Annex Held Up By War Priorities
## 
### 
Restrictions on the use of pri
ority materials have held up plans
for the construction of a new an
nex to the Chemistry Building.
At the present time, contractors
are unable to get certain materials
for use in the building.
Specifications have been sent to
the War Board and construction

of the new annex is now a matter
of getting the materials through
priority. As the Chemistry Depart
ment is doing work of direct value
to the war effort, it is believed
that Stanford will be given prior
ity ratings on materials which are
needed to complete construction
on the building.

Another new improvement on
the campus is the proposed new
Row road. It is planned to widen
and pave Lane W, the road that
runs directly in back of the Kappa
house, parallel to the Row. At
present definite plans are being
made to widen the x*oad, but
whether or not one-way traffic and
no-parking regulations will be in
stituted has not yet been decided.
