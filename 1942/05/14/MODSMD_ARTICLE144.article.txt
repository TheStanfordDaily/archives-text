# Women Offered Training For Industrial War Work
## 
### 
Wanted: 6.550.000 women!
A draft may be the government's
solution to the problem of declin
ing manpower in industry. Gov
ernment statistics show that the
need now is for 5.000.000 women in
industry by January, 1943.
Where will the college woman be
placed by the draft?
Stanford has already offered
courses to help Stanford women
find their proper place in the war
effort. The focus until now has
been on the more feminine occu
pations. This summer women in
more technical occupations will be
the trend.
WOMEN ENGINEERS!
Stanford will begin training
_women for engineers' jobs this
summer.
The first course in drafting for
women is being offered under the
Engineering. Science, and Manage
ment Defense Training Program.
This means the gove.iiment pays

Stanford senior women will have
the first chance at the fifty positions
open in the class. The only pre
requisites are two years of high
school mathematics and the will
ingness to go into a job when the
10 weeks training period is com
pleted.
The same course was given at

the University of California this
year for five weeks, and all of the
thirty-eight women who took it,
are now working in war industries,
at not less than 81,440 a year.
Professor Lydik Jacobsen, of the
Mechanical Engineering Depart
ment, will teach the course, and tui
tion is paid by the government.
Again in the engineering field,
the Naval Ordnance Laboratory of
