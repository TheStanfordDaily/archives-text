## 
### 
Preparing stockings and wool for
use in making stretcher blankets
will for the most part be the work
of tl)e War Work Shop which will
be begun by a selected number of
women on campus this summer.
Although the work shop in the
beginning, is being planned on a
modest scale., by the end of the
summer, expansion is expected to
add a loom for weaving the stretch
er blankets, and the new projects
for the enlarged staff of Stanford
meii and women.
Since the beginning of spring
quarter, the Stanford War Com
mittee has had visions of 3.000 per
sonst doing 2 hours of work a week
making a grand total of 6,000 hours
of aid to the war effort.
This sort of a draft has been util
ized on other campuses throughout
the United States, both during this
war and the last.
Manufacturing splints, cutting,
folding, and swing bandages, arm
bands, making model airplanes,
games aud puzzles, posters, and
weaving baskets are just a few of
the activities planned for the work
shop.
Rosamond Fuller and Barbara
Boorman head the planning com
mittee foe the work shop.
