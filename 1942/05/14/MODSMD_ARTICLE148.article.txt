# America to Replace British Shortages
## 
### 
If further deficiencies in produc
tion and raw materials occasioned
by war losses develop in England,
the British may have to depend
more and more on American sup
plies to hold up their end of the
war effort. In this regard. America
is already sending a stream of
much heeded products to England.
Beginnmg : with lend-lease action.
America has shipped hundreds of
war machines and many tons of
necessary raw materials.
With sugar rationing already in
effect af : Stanford and the ration
ing of other commodities imminent
but unpredictable, Stanford may
welt look at England's program for
a picture of what rationing can be
like.
