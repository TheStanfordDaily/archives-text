### 
Keep out! No admittance! Fac
ulty engaged in secret work!
From the Chemistry Building to
the Engineering Corner, signs such
as this indicate the tremendous ex
pansion of wartime experiments on
the Stanford campus. The type of
work being done is a military
secret, but the time and energy
being donated by our professors is
a matter for public recognition.
Donating one-third of their time
to war research, Stanford chem
istry professors are working in
their laboratories on scores of gov
ernment and war industry projects.
Aeronautics, physics, and biology
are just a few of the fields in which
new discoveries are being made, all
very confidential.
WORK WITHOUT PAY
Since Dec. 7, the government has
lured many faculty members into
administrative work, but there is
no flag waving for the Stanford
faculty when they are working for
the war effort. ITiey are devoting
their time and are working with
out salary on many important de
fense projects.
Night classes for adults are one
of the newest efforts with which
the faculty are co-operating, ac
cording to the administration.
These classes, given in San Fran
cisco, San Mateo, and South San
Francisco, as well as on the cam
pus, are held for the purpose of
better training men for the war
jobs they are doing.
WORKERS' NIGHT SCHOOL
Top-ranking professors in sci
ence and engineering are teaching
men engaged in war industries at
these night classes under a program
sponsored by the U.S. Office of
Education.
The new four-quarter plan has
also added to the responsibilities
of the faculty. Many professors
will teach this summer without ex
tra salary, giving up their regular
vacation quarter.
WAR BOND PURCHASES
Voluntarily deducting a portion
of their salaries for the purchase
of War Savings Bonds, the faculty
members are co-operating with the
Treasury Department in buying
their bonds regularly.
Ranging from Stanford to Wash
ington, from Boston to Guatemala,
the war work of the Stanford fac
ulty covers a wide field. There arc
Stanford professors with the OPM,
the WLB, the War Department, the
WSA and many other government
agencies. They are advising, in
vestigating, and experimenting.

Invest 10 cents weekly in "Dimes
for Diplomas."

Stanford professors with the OPM,
the WLB, the War Department, the

From the Chemistry Building to
the Engineering Corner, signs such
as this indicate the tremendous ex
pansion of wartime experiments on
the Stanford campus. The type of
work being done is a military
secret, but the time and energy
being donated by our professors is
a matter for public recognition.
Donating one-third of their time
to war research, Stanford chem
istry professors are working in
their laboratories on scores of gov
ernment and war industry projects.
Aeronautics, physics, and biology
are just a few of the fields in which
new discoveries are being made, all
very confidential.
WORK WITHOUT PAY
Since Dec. 7, the government has
lured many faculty members into
administrative work, but there is
no flag waving for the Stanford
faculty when they are working for
the war effort. ITiey are devoting
their time and are working with
out salary on many important de
fense projects.
Night classes for adults are one
of the newest efforts with which
the faculty are co-operating, ac
cording to the administration.
These classes, given in San Fran
cisco, San Mateo, and South San
Francisco, as well as on the cam
pus, are held for the purpose of
better training men for the war
jobs they are doing.
WORKERS' NIGHT SCHOOL
Top-ranking professors in sci
ence and engineering are teaching
men engaged in war industries at
these night classes under a program
sponsored by the U.S. Office of
Education.
The new four-quarter plan has
also added to the responsibilities
of the faculty. Many professors
will teach this summer without ex
tra salary, giving up their regular
vacation quarter.
WAR BOND PURCHASES
Voluntarily deducting a portion
of their salaries for the purchase
of War Savings Bonds, the faculty
members are co-operating with the
Treasury Department in buying
their bonds regularly.
