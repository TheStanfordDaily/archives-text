# Students, Alumni, Faculty Serve With Brains, Brawn
## 
### 
On land, on sea, and in the air
in myriad capacities, members of
the Stanford Family are serving
the United States in the war effort.
Students, alumni, and faculty are
active in the armed services, in
scientific work, in construction, in
administration, in reporting and
in medicine.
Although an accurate report on
the exact number of Farm men in
the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps
is not available, it is estimated that
several thousand are serving all
over the world. Stanford gradu
ates have won the Congressional
Medal of Honor, the Distinguished
Flying Cross, and numerous other
decorations.
TRAINING AT FARM
Through the expanded Reserve
Officers Training Corps, hundreds
of men are being trained on the
campus for Army commissions,
while other students are continu
ing college under deferred classi
fications such as the Navy's V-7
program. A Flying Indian Unit
of more than 20 Stanford men has
been organized as part of the Naval
Air Corps.
Even before the United States
entered the war, Stanford men
were fighting for the Allies in the
Royal Air Force and the Canadian
army. An ambulance unit was or
ganized to serve overseas last year,
carrying on the tradition of the
World War when the first Ameri
can flag in France was carried by
the Stanford Ambulance Corps.
STANFORD DIPLOMATS
On the diplomatic front, Stanford
men are representing the United
States in strategic parts of the
world. The first American consul
in Greenland was a Stanford grad
uate, as are several members of
the consulates in Chile and Fin
land.
More than 80 members of the
faculty are doing war work in de
signing, testing, research, person
nel selection, surgery and medi
cine, intelligence, production, lo
cation of strategic minerals, aero
nautics, communication, mediation,
translation and interpretation. Ac
cording to Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur, it is a "battle" to keep men
at the University.
AND AT WASHINGTON
Professors and graduates have
been called to Washington to ad
vise on the war program and legis
lation. Stanford men are promi
nent in administering selective
service, lend-lease, price control,
war shipping, censorship and other
government agencies.
On the campus, the Carnegie,
Ryan, and Guggenheim laborato
ries arc the scenes of war activity
described as being of vital impor

tance to the war effort. The chem
istry building is to be enlarged im
mediately to expand its war re
search and training facilities.
TECHNICAL MEN
Helping to turn out more and
better-designed airplanes and ships
are the many Stanfordites doing
technical and administrative work
in aircraft plants and shipyards.
Vitally needed materials for such
production were provided when a
Stanford graduate aided in the
discovery of a ten-million-dollar
tungsten deposit recently.
Contributions to the physical and
mental training of service men
have been made by Farm gradu
ates and faculty. Several psychol
ogy professors are studying pilot
training and morale, while 11
alumni are serving under Com
mander Gene Tunney in the Navy's
physical training service.

of more than 20 Stanford men has
been organized as part of the Naval
Air Corps.
Even before the United States
entered the war, Stanford men
were fighting for the Allies in the
Royal Air Force and the Canadian
army. An ambulance unit was or
ganized to serve overseas last year,
carrying on the tradition of the
World War when the first Ameri
can flag in France was carried by
the Stanford Ambulance Corps.
STANFORD DIPLOMATS
On the diplomatic front, Stanford
men are representing the United
States in strategic parts of the
world. The first American consul
in Greenland was a Stanford grad
uate, as are several members of
the consulates in Chile and Fin
land.
More than 80 members of the
faculty are doing war work in de
signing, testing, research, person
nel selection, surgery and medi
cine, intelligence, production, lo
cation of strategic minerals, aero
nautics, communication, mediation,
translation and interpretation. Ac
cording to Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur, it is a "battle" to keep men
at the University.
AND AT WASHINGTON
Professors and graduates have
been called to Washington to ad
vise on the war program and legis
lation. Stanford men are promi
nent in administering selective
service, lend-lease, price control,
war shipping, censorship and other
government agencies.
On the campus, the Carnegie,
Ryan, and Guggenheim laborato
ries arc the scenes of war activity
described as being of vital impor

tance to the war effort. The chem
istry building is to be enlarged im
mediately to expand its war re
search and training facilities.
TECHNICAL MEN
Helping to turn out more and
better-designed airplanes and ships
are the many Stanfordites doing
technical and administrative work
in aircraft plants and shipyards.
Vitally needed materials for such
production were provided when a
Stanford graduate aided in the
discovery of a ten-million-dollar
tungsten deposit recently.
Contributions to the physical and
mental training of service men
have been made by Farm gradu
ates and faculty. Several psychol
ogy professors are studying pilot
training and morale, while 11
alumni are serving under Com
mander Gene Tunney in the Navy's
physical training service.
On land, on sea, and in the air
in myriad capacities, members of
the Stanford Family are serving
the United States in the war effort.
Students, alumni, and faculty are
active in the armed services, in
scientific work, in construction, in
administration, in reporting and
in medicine.
Although an accurate report on
the exact number of Farm men in
the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps
is not available, it is estimated that
several thousand are serving all
over the world. Stanford gradu
ates have won the Congressional
Medal of Honor, the Distinguished
Flying Cross, and numerous other
decorations.
TRAINING AT FARM
Through the expanded Reserve
Officers Training Corps, hundreds
of men are being trained on the
campus for Army commissions,
while other students are continu
ing college under deferred classi
fications such as the Navy's V-7
program. A Flying Indian Unit
of more than 20 Stanford men has
been organized as part of the Naval
Air Corps.
