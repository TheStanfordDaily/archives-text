# Stanford Trains 2500 Men For Vital War Industries
## 
### 
Over 2500 war workers have been
graduated from Stanford's War In
dustry Training Program since its
instigation here in January.
The courses, sponsored and fi
nanced by the Engineering, Sci
ence, and Management Defense
Training Division of the U.S. Office
of Education, are offered to persons
whose educational backgrounds
vary from possession of a high
school diploma to graduate work in
engineering.
Stanford students who are inter
ested in immediate employment in
war industries or in technical
branches of the armed forces are
urged to take the courses. They
must agree to accept a job imme
diately after completion of training,
however. They will not be al
lowed to continue in college.
VARIOUS CAMPUSES
The courses are being taught on
the campus, at San Mateo, South
San Francisco, San Francisco, and
various other points in the state.
About half the instructors are
Stanford professors; the others are
specialized technicians in their
respective fields.
High school graduates, having
had at least two years of mathe
matics and one of physics, are eli
gible for a course in radio funda
mentals being taught at San Fran
cisco and in a newly constructed
laboratory on the Stanford cam
pus. Intended to produce workers
with a basic technical knowledge
of radio who may be further
trained in specialized jobs by the
industry itself, the course will re
quire nine hours' work a week for
two periods of 15 weeks each.
TYPES OF INSTRUCTION
Courses in industrial manage
ment, accounting, and production
control are being offered for those
interested and qualified for super
visory work, while those inter
ested in the technical side may
enroll in physics, electricity, and
mathematics. A number of courses
in industrial safety engineering are
also offered. Those with a de
gree in Civil Engineering may take
a course in the "Structural As
pects of Civilian Air Raid Protec
tion," dealing with the construc
tion of air raid shelters.
Full-time courses in surveying

the progress of the war, Stanford
men are stationed throughout the
world as reporters, photographers
and broadcasters. The first Amer
ican correspondent killed in the
war was a Stanford alumnus, Mel
Jacoby, '38, and the first radio
report of the attack on Pearl Har
bor was given by a former student,
To list all the civilian defense
activities in which Stanford people
are participating is impossible, but
they have taken a particularly ac
tive part in the development of the
blood bank in San Francisco and
the Civil Air Patrol in the Bay
Area. Stanford alumnae are en
gaged in nursing and conservation
work through the Stanford Vol
unteer Corps.

High school graduates, having
had at least two years of mathe
matics and one of physics, are eli
gible for a course in radio funda
mentals being taught at San Fran

pus. Intended to produce workers
with a basic technical knowledge
of radio who may be further

two periods of 15 weeks each.
TYPES OF INSTRUCTION
Courses in industrial manage
ment, accounting, and production
control are being offered for those
