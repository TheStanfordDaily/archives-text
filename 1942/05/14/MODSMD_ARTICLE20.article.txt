## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP). -
The "x" which stands for unlimited
gasoline privileges in the eastern ra
tioning area tonight also marked the
spot on which Congressmen found
themselves.
The legislators became targets for
a barrage of printed and spoken
criticism after more than 200 of them
obtained "x" ration cards. Holders of
such cards are permitted to "fill 'er
up" anytime in the 17 fuel-fam
ished eastern states and the District
of Columbia where gasoline will be
doled out in thtee-gallon-a-week
units to less fortunate motorists be
ginning Friday.
