## German Naval Units Steaming Into Black Sea 
### 
MOSCOW. Thursday, May 14 (UP)
—Russian defenders of the Kerch
Peninsula have fallen hack to new
positions under a terrific onslaught
by German land, sea, and air forces,
retreating in good order and inflict
ing "enormous" losses on the ad
vancing enemy, the R<>d Army re
ported today.
Other Soviet planes blasting at
German communications lines were
credited with destroying 100 more
trucks moving men and material up
to the front, 105 loaded carts, 40
field and anti-aircraft guns, and 10
trench mortars.
The late communique said a Soviet
warship operating in the Barents
Sea on the arctic supply route from
the United States and Great Brit
ain sank an enemy transport of
12,000 tons.
JUNKERS DOWNED
"Elsewhere on the front nothing of
significance was reported," it said.
Unofficial Soviet reports, how
ever, told of formidable hostilities
in virtually every main sector of the
front, particularly in the Ukraine
where invasion and defense armies
struggled for positions vital to the
big-scale campaigning which ap
peared to be gathering momentum
already.
The Soviet l'adio said that on the
northwestern front in the Lake ll
men region, where the 11th German
Army has been trapped for months,
Russian airmen in the last few days
shot down 39 big Junkers 52 trans
port planes evidently seeking to re
inforce the encircled forces.

The same source reported that in
the Bransk sector southwest of Mos
cow a band of 250 Germans trying
to force a crossing of a strategic
river under the fire of Soviet ar
tillery, were driven back in dis
order.
For the first time it was revealed
that German naval units—presum
ably submarines and gunboats steal
ing eastward through the Black Sea
—were supporting the Axis aero
land offensive. Pitted against them
was the powerful Russian Black Sea
fleet.
The Russians, armed with the
deadliest weapons of modern war
fare, including triple-turret Ameri
can tanks, were inflicting terrific
J German casualties, according to So
viet dispatches.
(The German High Command
claimed that, "the battle to break
through on the isthmus of Kerch has
been decided. It was concluded with
the annihilation of enemy forces
overrun and encircled there."
