# Provisional Student Body Government for Wartime Considered by Ex Com
## Proposed Reorganization Plan Will Substitute New Members-at-Large For Present Class Representation 
### 
A provisional government for the wartime student body is being
worked out by a committee beaded by Harry llorton.
Hcrton outlined the plan for Ex Committee Tuesday night. After two
hours of discussion, the plan was referred back tu Horton for final touches.
Ex Committee will take action on the proposal next week.

Biggest innovation in the reorgani
zation is the new basis of repre
sentation. Because the war has wip
ed out most definite class divisions,
the student government will no
longer be made up of officers se
lected from each class. In place of
"sophomore man on Excom," etc.,
there will he four members-at
laf-.e. The voting council at the head
of the student body government
would include the president of
A sociated Men and Associated
Women. These two bodies would be
e. i ved out of the student body as a
whole. Horton explained this inno
vation by listing some of the advan
tages to the men in having their own
organization.
PRACTICAL DIVISION
The committee concluded that di
viding the school according to sex is
more practical in wartime than class
division.
The president of the Associated
Men would be elected by all the
men in school. In case the war
forced him to leave his post, his
successor would be elected by rep
resentatives of Interfraternirty Coun
cil, Interclub Council, Encina, Bran
ner, Toy on, Sequoia, graduate men,
and off-campus men. This would
do away with the necessity of hold
ing a general election to fill just this
one post. ,
Having a seat on the council, but
no vote, are the War Activities Co
ordinator, Daily editor, a represen
tative of speech and drama, and an
athletic commissioner. Other ex
officio members would be the stu
dent manager and the colonel of
R.O.T.C.

organization.
PRACTICAL DIVISION
The committee concluded that di
viding the school according to sex is
more practical in wartime than class
division.
The president of the Associated
Men would be elected by all the
men in school. In case the war
forced him to leave his post, his
successor would be elected by rep
resentatives of Interfraternirty Coun
cil, Interclub Council, Encina, Bran
ner, Toy on, Sequoia, graduate men,
and off-campus men. This would
do away with the necessity of hold
ing a general election to fill just this
one post. ,
Having a seat on the council, but
no vote, are the War Activities Co
ordinator, Daily editor, a represen
tative of speech and drama, and an
athletic commissioner. Other ex
officio members would be the stu
dent manager and the colonel of
R.O.T.C.
