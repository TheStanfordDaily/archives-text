# House Passes Army Pay Hike
## Senate Gets Bill Giving Private $50 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 13 (UP). â€”
The House, with only one dissenting
vote, today passed and returned to
the Senate a bill raising the base
pay of Army privates and appren
tice seamen to $50 a month and re
vising upward compensation of non
commissioned officers.
The base pay of Army second
lieutenants and Navy ensigns also
would be raised from $1,500 to $1,800
annually and they and other com
missioned officers would receive
higher allowances for rent and ra
tions.
The measure was whipped through
by a roll call vote of 356 to 1. Rep.
Wesley Disney, D., Okla., dissented.
The little band of dissidents was
smothered by 331 of their colleagues
who, in an atmosphere reminiscent
of the historic soldier bonus fights,
insisted on retaining the Rankin
proposal.
The House action does not clinch
the increase. The Senate passed a
carefully drawn bill which raised
the $21 base pay of buck private and
the $30 pay of apprentice seaman to
$42 monthly and made other up
ward revisions in army and navy
pay schedules.
