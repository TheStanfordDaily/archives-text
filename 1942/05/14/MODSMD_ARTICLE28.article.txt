# Encina Schedules Jolly-up Saturday
## 
### 
Encina will hold its third jolly-up
in four weeks Saturday night when
several carloads of Robleites are ex
pected to join the first-year men in
a "record dance" in Encina Lobby.
The dance, part of Encina's pro
gram to keep students on campus
over week-ends, will be, according
to an Encina Council member,
"highly informal."
The last jolly-up, held two weeks
ago, attracted about 30 or 40 couples,
with a stag line twice as big. This,
according to the dance committee,
should prove of interest to ratio
conscious Robleites.
