# Goal for Diploma Drive Advanced
## 
### 
"Students today will indicate the
value placed on a Stanford educa
tion by the amount they contribute
to the Dimes for Diplomas fund,"
suggests Dale Hosman, chairman of
the drive.
It is hoped that $490 will lie col
lected which will pay the tuition
expenses of the two former Stan
ford students in the service for one
quarter.
"Contribute the dimes you would
be paying for cokes you won't be
able to get at the Cellar," Hosman
said.
