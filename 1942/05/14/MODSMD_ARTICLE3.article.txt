One of two bands, either Jimmy
Grier or Bob Saunders, will be
chosen to play for the annual Mili
tary Ball, which will definitely be
held on Friday night, May 22, an
exclusive date granted to this func
tion. The entire student body is
urged to attend, since the proceeds
of the dance will go to Army Relief.
Anyone on campus can purchase
bids for the Military Ball, at the
A.S.S.U. .office or from a machine
gun emplacement which will be lo
cated on the English corner begin
ning Monday. According to Brown
lee Corrin, dancc chairman, a large
number of students are expected to
buy their bids immediately and of
their own volition, in which case,
he promises, the gun emplacement
will be used merely as a decoration.
The decorations for the dance will
be appropriately military in keeping
with the war theme. Those who
attend the dance v/ill find the pavil
ion decorated with various types of
military equipment such as cannon,
caissons, guns, and other war articles
which are of interest to everyone
