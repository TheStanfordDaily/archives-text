# The 						Martinique Immobilization

### 
VICHY, May 13 (UP).—France is
ready to renew her pledge that no
French warship will be used by the
Axis against the Allies, and to im
mobilize the three warships at Mar
tinique, but she refuses to hand over
the tankers and merchant ships
there to the United States, the Vichy
government informed Washington in
a formal note today.
Delivery of merchant shipping tied
up at the French Caribbean island
—estimated at 140,000 tons—would
violate French commitments under
the 1940 Armistice Convention not to
surrender shipping to enemies of the
Axis, the note said.
The German - controlled Paris
newspaper Matin predicted today
that the ships would be scuttled if
the United SLates tried to take them

over by force.
Before the contents of the note
were learned, the foreign office had
announced in a communique that a
message had been sent to Washing
ton and commented that the United
States "demands" concerning Mar
tinique had raised "grave questions."
The note, which took up three
pages, referred to the American ap
proach to Admiral Robert for a new
arrangement as 'an extra-diplo
matic offensive.'
ft insisted that modification of
the satisfactory accord regarding
Martinique already in force was not
justified simply because of the Cabi
net change in Vichy.
It offered, however, to negotiate a
new agreement concerning the war
status of the island through normal
diplomatic channels.
