# New Japanese Invasion Seen
## Allied Air Pressure May Bring New Move 
### 
MELBOURNE, May 13 (UP).â€”A
new Japanese invasion fleet was
believed tonight to be assembling
northeast of Australia for another
southward drive, which military ex
perts said must be attempted soon to
reduce Allied air assaults on pres
ent enemy island bases.
Activities of Japanese ships and
war planes at Rabaul, on New Brit
ain Island, and at Lae, on the north
New Guinea coast, as reported by
American and Australian reconnais
sance fliers, indicated that enemy re
inforcements were arriving in the
area steadily, according to war dis
patches.
The belief here was that the Japa
nese could not long stand the heavy
blows of the Allied air force and
must strike soon or get out of the
northeastern invasion area.
Two Jap submarines, bombed and
possibly sunk by American and
Australian fliers in the northeast
area on Sunday, may have been
on a scouting mission preparatory to
a new offensive, military experts
said.
