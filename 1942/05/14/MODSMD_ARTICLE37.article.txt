HIGHLIGHTS—Big Jim Tobin
wrote a "Home Run in Triplicate"
saga into National League records
yesterday when he connected for
three circuit clouts in one game
to lead the Boston Braves to a <i-5
win over the Chicago Cubs.
Tohin hit four-baggers on suc
cessive times at bat in the fifth,
seventh, and eighth innings to
drive in four runs—and each time
the hall sailed out of the Boston
park. Tobin is the first major
league pitcher ever to perforin
this three-homer feat. He held
the Cubs to five hits, two of which
were unearned.
In the American League Cleve
land grabbed the spotlight by
shattering New York's winning
streak with a 7-2 victory to cut the
world champions' lead to one-half
game.
Curt Davis allowed the Reds
only two hits to give Brooklyn a
4-0 shutout triumph over Cincin
nati. His sinker ball permitted
only three fly ball chances for the
Flathush outfields as the last 19
Redmen went down in order. The
Dodgers meanwhile blasted John
ny Vander Meer from the mound
in the fourth and continued on
Paul Derringer and Clyde Shoun
for nine safeties.
Pittsburgh garnered all its three
runs in the lucky seventh which
knocked Dave Koslo out of the box
after he yielded seven hits. Max
Butcher, who defeated the Giants
six times last season, rationed six
hits sparingly to allow but one
run in the fifth. Frankie Frisch
was chased in the seventh for dis
agreeing with a decision at the
plate.
The St. Louis Cardinals pound
ed four Phil pitchers for 15 hits
to take an easy 9-1 verdict.
