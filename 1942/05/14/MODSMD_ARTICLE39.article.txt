HERRON'S RECORDS
Paul Herron, back stroke and
i free style swimmer extraordinary, in

i records individually and two others
i in part, in addition to six of the
nine freshman records.

his times in the 50 and 100-yard free

record, while his 100 time of 54.9
j is very close.
Brandsten's tabulation gives the

tory over the 1939 squad.
Was Stanford's 1912 freshman swimming team the best in Farm history, J
I or was it merely one of the better yearling outfits?
, An answer is furnished by Coach Ernie Brandsten, who says, "This
year's freshman swimming team could have beaten any other Stanford
freshman team in dual meet competition."

And Brandsten, who has coached
i at Stanford sincc 1914 and who is an
I outstanding figure in swimming cir-
I cles throughout the nation, knows of
I what he speaks.
INDIVIDUAL STARS
The 1929 team with Austin Clapp,
1 Frank Booth, and Ted Wiget and
] the 1939 squad with Paul Herron,
Scott Dudley, and Howie Adams had
perhaps greater individual stars, but
for all-around strength, this season's
squad is tops.
Boasting four individual stars in
Jim Gamble, Captain Alan Weeden,
| Hank Saltonstall, and Dick Narver,
j the 1942 Encinamen had strength to
spare in every event.
Reserve strength supplied by Jack
I Rainalter. Doug Goodin, Bob Mapel,
Carter Schriber, Bud Carpenter,
Dick Williams, Willard Bell, and
Pete Hatch behind the big four al
j most doublec} their opponents' points
| in six meets this season.
HERRON'S RECORDS
Paul Herron, back stroke and
i free style swimmer extraordinary, in
! 1939 held four national freshman
i records individually and two others
i in part, in addition to six of the
nine freshman records.
Jim Gamble consistently bettered
his times in the 50 and 100-yard free
styles this year, while Dick Narver
could give Herron plenty of trouble
in the 100 and 220 free styles, Her
ron's specialty. Gamble's 50-yard
time of 23.9 tied the national frosh
record, while his 100 time of 54.9
j is very close.
