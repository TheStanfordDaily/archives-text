# Kinzle, Hertel to Battle For Coast Hurdle Crown
## 
### 
Formidable and unexpected competition has been thrown in the path
of Ed Hertel, Stanford's premier hurdler, in his quest for the West Coast
Relays high hurdles title Saturday evening at Fresno.
Dunn Kinzle of Arizona State is the new entrant who is expected to
furnish Hertel with the added competition. Kinzle has gone undefeated

this year and already holds one
cision over the Card flyer, but that
race, in the Long Beach Relays, was
before Hertel reached his present
high standard of performances.
EXPERIENCED HURDLER
The Arizona timber-topper is one
of the most experienced hurdlers
still in college today. He attended
Duke University during his first
three years of college, and won the
Penn Relays and Southern Confer
ence titles while he was there. His
mark of 14 .4 seconds in 1939 made
him one of the best hurdlers in the
country that year.
Now after two years of absence
from college track circles he has
come back to win not only the Bor
der Conference crown, but also the
Long Beach and Colorado Relays
titles. Hertel and John Beiwener of
U.S.C. are the two men expected to
give him an argument in Satur
day's Fresno Relays.
Five world records will be in se
rious danger of being bettered when
the 200 athletes gather for the 16th
renewal of this annual classic.
AIMS FOR VAULT RECORD
Cornelius Warmerdam, pole vault
ing sensation and former Stanford
grad student who has broken the ex
isting mark 20 times, will attempt to
push his best effort of 15 feet 7*4
inches out of the books. Since it was
at Fresno while he was attending
the State College there that Warmer
dam first gained his fame, the home
town folks may give him added in
centive.
The sprinting of California's Hal
Davis and the Southern California
relay teams in the 440. 880, and mile
events, should also give the fans the
possibility of seeing a record broken.

Five world records will be in se
rious danger of being bettered when
the 200 athletes gather for the 16th
renewal of this annual classic.
AIMS FOR VAULT RECORD
Cornelius Warmerdam, pole vault
ing sensation and former Stanford
grad student who has broken the ex
isting mark 20 times, will attempt to
push his best effort of 15 feet 7*4
inches out of the books. Since it was
at Fresno while he was attending
the State College there that Warmer
dam first gained his fame, the home
town folks may give him added in
centive.
The sprinting of California's Hal
Davis and the Southern California
relay teams in the 440. 880, and mile
events, should also give the fans the
possibility of seeing a record broken.
Formidable and unexpected competition has been thrown in the path
of Ed Hertel, Stanford's premier hurdler, in his quest for the West Coast
Relays high hurdles title Saturday evening at Fresno.
Dunn Kinzle of Arizona State is the new entrant who is expected to
furnish Hertel with the added competition. Kinzle has gone undefeated

this year and already holds one
cision over the Card flyer, but that
race, in the Long Beach Relays, was
before Hertel reached his present
high standard of performances.
EXPERIENCED HURDLER
The Arizona timber-topper is one
of the most experienced hurdlers
still in college today. He attended
Duke University during his first
three years of college, and won the
Penn Relays and Southern Confer
ence titles while he was there. His
mark of 14 .4 seconds in 1939 made
him one of the best hurdlers in the
country that year.
Now after two years of absence
from college track circles he has
come back to win not only the Bor
der Conference crown, but also the
Long Beach and Colorado Relays
titles. Hertel and John Beiwener of
U.S.C. are the two men expected to
give him an argument in Satur
day's Fresno Relays.
