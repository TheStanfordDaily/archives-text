### DON SELBY 
A NUMBER of football-minded
persons have asked if the set-up
on the Stanford practice field this
spring is the same as it was during
Tiny Thornhill's regime.
We're very happy to report that it
is not.
True, Lawson isn't the task-maker
that Shaughnessy was. Nor is there
any "mister" business out there. But,
at the same time, neither is there
the wholesale fooling around that
there was when the happy-go-lucky,
jolly - good - fellow Thornhill was
coach.
Lawson is giving his boys a lot of
football. He is using his spring
practice session a little bit differ
ently than it has been used in the
past, in that he is teaching most of
the new players the system, and
letting the veterans take it a little
easy.
But come fall and the regular
football season, things will take on
a different aspect on the Stanford
practice field. At least that's our
contention.
We believe that Lawson will
tighten things up a little more next
fall.
It's hard to get much of an idea
of Stanford's potentialities for in
tercollegiate competition next fall,
when everything is so uncertain.
But IF the players who are here
now return and IF football is played
on the coast in any manner re
sembling the way it has been played
in the last several years, Stanford
should turn out a better-than
mediocre team.
Well qualified, isn't it?
