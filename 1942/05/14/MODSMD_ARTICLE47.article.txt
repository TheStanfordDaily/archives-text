Hanging onto the pace is that good
old Buccaneer gang from the Smoky
City which The Daily picked to come
out of nowhere this year and forsake
their usual fourth spot. Stu Martin
came through with some good days
recently and Vince DiMaggio still
hits a long ball when they count.
Pittsburgh still seems to operate on
luck a great deal and Frisch has
taught his boys to take advantage
of the.breaks. They really use the
other side's errors.
