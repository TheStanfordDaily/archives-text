## 
### 
William G. Foster, soph transfer,
and William B. Dcwcy, freshman,
were sentenced to work 100 hours
on the municipal woodpile and to
pay damages of $107.35 on charges
of malicious mischief yesterday
morning in a Palo Alto court.
The two students, who were ar
rested early Tuesday morning after
Officer E. A. Parr saw them spitting
on windows and throwing missiles at
electrolier lights on the Circle, plead
guilty before Judge John E. Springer.
The youths must pay the bill for
breakage before noon next Monday
and must immediately start working
five consecutive hours a day at the
woodpile until the 100 hours have
been put in. Failure to do cither
will automatically revoke the proba
tion granted by Judge Springer and
they will go to jail for 30 days.
