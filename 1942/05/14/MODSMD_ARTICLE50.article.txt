# "L' Affaire 1:30"

### 
\\T 'AFFAIRE 1:30" has raised as much fuss
J_j among the women of Stanford as did
Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court
back in 1936. The women are hurling charges
of "dictatorship" at Conference, crying out in
defense of their "civil liberties," and, in general,
acting the part of outraged democrats—as is
their privilege.
When you read the letters to The Editor and
listen to the conversations buzzing in the wom
en's living groups, you'd think that the Wom
en's Auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan had met in
the dead of night and plotted long and fiend
ishly to bilk the innocent women of Stanford
out of their late leaves. Then these were-wolves
skulked back to house meetings to fifth-column
their sisters into acceptance of the dastardly act.
It didn't happen like that. Conference, the
elected representatives of the women of Stan
ford, did not have to take the proposal before
the women at all. All they are required to do
constitutionally is pass a ruling and get it
okayed by Excom.
But this is beside the point in question. The
voting indicated there are many women who
favor a change. Else why did 13 out of 17
living groups state they would be willing to
go under a system which permitted a few float
ing 2:3o's and a majority of l:3o's.
And, as a matter of fact, the plan outlined at
the Conference meeting Monday did include
some provision tor 2:30 floaters or specials. Liv
ing group representatives were told to empha
size this point when they reported back to their
houses. Clearly, many of the house representa
tives misunderstood.
All of which brings up the Campus Opinion
titled "Defense of 2:3o's" which appeared in
yesterday's Daily.
1. It was pointed out that the use of tires is
the individual's own affair. This opinion would
seem to differ radically from that of Secretary
of the Treasury Morgenthau, who said last week
that pre-war spending and waste by the indi
vidual was in direct opposition to the nation's
war effort. Conference, however, is not trying
to bludgeon Stanford into co-operation by cut
ting 2:3o's—that is the individual's business.
2. Use of the train is the logical way to save
tires. But, if the railroad companies carry out
their announced intention of rationing tickets to
non-commuters, no one here at Stanford will be
able to go dancing in the city 25 times each
quarter. Under the present system any junior
or senior woman with a C average can do just
that. Three or four floaters should certainly
take care of the San Francisco situation.
3. This matter of health, dismissed so blandly
by the Five Senior Women, is the crux of the
whole affair. (Conference never evinced any
interest in cutting down the love-live of the
campus by changing the late-leave system. It
is assumed that love, as an institution, is here to
stay.)
But to get back to the health angle. Appar
ently the Five Senior Women want the 2:30 to
remain on the books as did the New England
Blue Laws; although they firmly believe that
each and every woman at Stanford is a sensible,
adult individual who automatically started com
ing in at 1:30 a.m. or thereabouts on the night
of December 8, and who will continue to do so
for the duration. Well, she hasn't, and the indi
cations are that she won't. The "2:29 Dash" is
as much of an institution around here as the
Cactus Gardens.
Social Custom—an autocratic ruler—creates
this situation. An informal poll of men students
shows that they seldom bring a girl whom they
like home before 2:30 because they fear that
she may be displeased. A girl seldom suggests
that she be brought home early, because she in
turn is afraid her date will think she isn't having
a good time. One man put it very succinctly:
"By 1 o'clock," he said, "I'm either dam'
bored or dam' tired."
So what? So there is a good reason why the
Stanford Woman should get more sleep. There
will be less men, the Five Senior Women say.
Yes, there will be, and it follows from that state
ment that the Stanford Woman must be pre
pared at graduation—whether she is married or
not to hold a job which normally is held by a
man. Stanford has reorganized to a four-quarter,
six day-a-week curriculum so that the men may
join the armed forces as soon as possible—
and so that the women can take the jobs for
which they are desperately needed.
Stanford is prepared to help you help your
country to win the war. You and Stanford both
have a big job. And, if you can name a job
in the business world which you could hold at
top efficiency and still stay out until 2:30 three
nights a week, then vote down the amended
proposal which will come your way in a couple
of weeks.
That is your democratic right.- Jean Nowell

some provision tor 2:30 floaters or specials. Liv
ing group representatives were told to empha
size this point when they reported back to their
houses. Clearly, many of the house representa
tives misunderstood.
All of which brings up the Campus Opinion
titled "Defense of 2:3o's" which appeared in
yesterday's Daily.
1. It was pointed out that the use of tires is
the individual's own affair. This opinion would
seem to differ radically from that of Secretary
of the Treasury Morgenthau, who said last week
that pre-war spending and waste by the indi
vidual was in direct opposition to the nation's
war effort. Conference, however, is not trying
to bludgeon Stanford into co-operation by cut
ting 2:3o's—that is the individual's business.
2. Use of the train is the logical way to save
tires. But, if the railroad companies carry out
their announced intention of rationing tickets to
non-commuters, no one here at Stanford will be
able to go dancing in the city 25 times each
quarter. Under the present system any junior
or senior woman with a C average can do just
that. Three or four floaters should certainly
take care of the San Francisco situation.
3. This matter of health, dismissed so blandly
by the Five Senior Women, is the crux of the
whole affair. (Conference never evinced any
interest in cutting down the love-live of the
campus by changing the late-leave system. It
is assumed that love, as an institution, is here to
stay.)
But to get back to the health angle. Appar
ently the Five Senior Women want the 2:30 to
remain on the books as did the New England
Blue Laws; although they firmly believe that
each and every woman at Stanford is a sensible,
adult individual who automatically started com
ing in at 1:30 a.m. or thereabouts on the night
of December 8, and who will continue to do so
for the duration. Well, she hasn't, and the indi
cations are that she won't. The "2:29 Dash" is
as much of an institution around here as the
Cactus Gardens.
Social Custom—an autocratic ruler—creates
this situation. An informal poll of men students
shows that they seldom bring a girl whom they
like home before 2:30 because they fear that
she may be displeased. A girl seldom suggests
that she be brought home early, because she in
turn is afraid her date will think she isn't having
a good time. One man put it very succinctly:
"By 1 o'clock," he said, "I'm either dam'
bored or dam' tired."
So what? So there is a good reason why the
Stanford Woman should get more sleep. There
will be less men, the Five Senior Women say.
Yes, there will be, and it follows from that state
ment that the Stanford Woman must be pre
pared at graduation—whether she is married or
not to hold a job which normally is held by a
man. Stanford has reorganized to a four-quarter,
six day-a-week curriculum so that the men may
join the armed forces as soon as possible—
and so that the women can take the jobs for
which they are desperately needed.
Stanford is prepared to help you help your
country to win the war. You and Stanford both
have a big job. And, if you can name a job
in the business world which you could hold at
top efficiency and still stay out until 2:30 three
nights a week, then vote down the amended
proposal which will come your way in a couple
of weeks.
That is your democratic right.- Jean Nowell
\\T 'AFFAIRE 1:30" has raised as much fuss
J_j among the women of Stanford as did
Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court
back in 1936. The women are hurling charges
of "dictatorship" at Conference, crying out in
defense of their "civil liberties," and, in general,
acting the part of outraged democrats—as is
their privilege.
When you read the letters to The Editor and
listen to the conversations buzzing in the wom
en's living groups, you'd think that the Wom
en's Auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan had met in
the dead of night and plotted long and fiend
ishly to bilk the innocent women of Stanford
out of their late leaves. Then these were-wolves
skulked back to house meetings to fifth-column
their sisters into acceptance of the dastardly act.
It didn't happen like that. Conference, the
elected representatives of the women of Stan
ford, did not have to take the proposal before
the women at all. All they are required to do
constitutionally is pass a ruling and get it
okayed by Excom.
But this is beside the point in question. The
voting indicated there are many women who
favor a change. Else why did 13 out of 17
living groups state they would be willing to
go under a system which permitted a few float
ing 2:3o's and a majority of l:3o's.

is assumed that love, as an institution, is here to
stay.)
But to get back to the health angle. Appar
ently the Five Senior Women want the 2:30 to
remain on the books as did the New England
Blue Laws; although they firmly believe that
each and every woman at Stanford is a sensible,
adult individual who automatically started com
ing in at 1:30 a.m. or thereabouts on the night
of December 8, and who will continue to do so
for the duration. Well, she hasn't, and the indi
cations are that she won't. The "2:29 Dash" is
as much of an institution around here as the
Cactus Gardens.
Social Custom—an autocratic ruler—creates
this situation. An informal poll of men students
shows that they seldom bring a girl whom they
like home before 2:30 because they fear that
she may be displeased. A girl seldom suggests
that she be brought home early, because she in
turn is afraid her date will think she isn't having
a good time. One man put it very succinctly:
"By 1 o'clock," he said, "I'm either dam'
bored or dam' tired."
So what? So there is a good reason why the
Stanford Woman should get more sleep. There
will be less men, the Five Senior Women say.
Yes, there will be, and it follows from that state
ment that the Stanford Woman must be pre
pared at graduation—whether she is married or
not to hold a job which normally is held by a
man. Stanford has reorganized to a four-quarter,
six day-a-week curriculum so that the men may
join the armed forces as soon as possible—
and so that the women can take the jobs for
which they are desperately needed.
Stanford is prepared to help you help your
country to win the war. You and Stanford both
have a big job. And, if you can name a job
in the business world which you could hold at
top efficiency and still stay out until 2:30 three
nights a week, then vote down the amended
proposal which will come your way in a couple
of weeks.

\\T 'AFFAIRE 1:30" has raised as much fuss
J_j among the women of Stanford as did
Roosevelt's attempt to pack the Supreme Court
back in 1936. The women are hurling charges
of "dictatorship" at Conference, crying out in
defense of their "civil liberties," and, in general,
acting the part of outraged democrats—as is
their privilege.
When you read the letters to The Editor and
listen to the conversations buzzing in the wom
en's living groups, you'd think that the Wom
en's Auxiliary of the Ku Klux Klan had met in
the dead of night and plotted long and fiend
ishly to bilk the innocent women of Stanford
out of their late leaves. Then these were-wolves
skulked back to house meetings to fifth-column
their sisters into acceptance of the dastardly act.
It didn't happen like that. Conference, the
elected representatives of the women of Stan
ford, did not have to take the proposal before
the women at all. All they are required to do
constitutionally is pass a ruling and get it
okayed by Excom.
But this is beside the point in question. The
voting indicated there are many women who
favor a change. Else why did 13 out of 17
living groups state they would be willing to
go under a system which permitted a few float
ing 2:3o's and a majority of l:3o's.
And, as a matter of fact, the plan outlined at
the Conference meeting Monday did include
some provision tor 2:30 floaters or specials. Liv
ing group representatives were told to empha
size this point when they reported back to their
houses. Clearly, many of the house representa
tives misunderstood.
All of which brings up the Campus Opinion
titled "Defense of 2:3o's" which appeared in
yesterday's Daily.
1. It was pointed out that the use of tires is
the individual's own affair. This opinion would
seem to differ radically from that of Secretary
of the Treasury Morgenthau, who said last week
that pre-war spending and waste by the indi
vidual was in direct opposition to the nation's
war effort. Conference, however, is not trying
to bludgeon Stanford into co-operation by cut
ting 2:3o's—that is the individual's business.
2. Use of the train is the logical way to save
tires. But, if the railroad companies carry out
their announced intention of rationing tickets to
non-commuters, no one here at Stanford will be
able to go dancing in the city 25 times each
quarter. Under the present system any junior
or senior woman with a C average can do just
that. Three or four floaters should certainly
take care of the San Francisco situation.
3. This matter of health, dismissed so blandly
by the Five Senior Women, is the crux of the
whole affair. (Conference never evinced any
interest in cutting down the love-live of the
campus by changing the late-leave system. It
is assumed that love, as an institution, is here to
