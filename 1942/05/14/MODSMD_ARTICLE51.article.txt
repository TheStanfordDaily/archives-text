### AMIE REICHERT 
r JPHE battle in the Kerch Peninsula is probably the
prelude to Hitler's great offensive. The world has
waited a long time for this. Waited through the cold
bitter winter months which saw one Nazi defeat after
another. Waited through the breathless tense spring
months which saw the German war machine girding
itself once more for battle. Waited and felt the tension.
This has been a time of waiting without fear, how
ever. There is more hope and confidence on the part
of the Allies now than at any moment of the war. It
is because of the Red Army, which has taken it and
handed it back, with interest, to the Nazis. We have
been waiting for the Russians as well as the Germans
this time. Waiting expectantly and eagerly to see what
they will do to the blustering German war machine
when it goes back for a second helping.
Hitler's people have been waiting for this too, and
they are growing restive. His army has not been
fully occupied since last fall. They have waited, too,
for the big spring offensive that never came.
The time table had to be adjusted. It is a summer
offensive now. The first blow was struck at the Kerch
Peninsula several days ago for several reasons. In the
first place the weather is good there now. Up around
Leningrad and Moscow it is snowy and muddy still,
and in the northern Ukraine the rivers are still high.
But down in the Crimea and the Kerch Peninsula it
is dry and will be dry all this month.

FURTHERMORE, the Crimea and the Kerch Penin
sula are gateways to the Caucasian oilâ€”and this is
what Hitler is after. This is his main objective in
Russia, this, along with annihilating the Red Army.
These two factors are interrelated and inseparable.
Der Fuehrer must have oil to keep going and he
must have the Red Army out of his way to get it.
That is perhaps oversimplification, but it is neverthe
less true.
If you will look at a map you will see that the
Kerch Peninsula is a fat little lump of land which nar
rows down at its eastern tip and stretches like a
finger across the Sea of Azov to the Caucasus. Once
across, the Nazis would be on the highway to the
precious oil fields.
This is a desperate push. It will increase in fury,
you may be sure, for the Russians are well prepared.
It is fairly safe to say that Hitler has to destroy the
Red Army and get the oil he so sorely needs or lose
the war this year. The next few months will tell the
story.
