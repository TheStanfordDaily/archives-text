### MIKE CHURCHILL 
LET EXCOM LIE
SUBCOMMITTEE of Excom has prepared and pre
sented a plan to reorganize Stanford's student gov
ernment in order better to adjust it to war conditions.
It is the opinion of this column that Excom has gone
off the deep end in their reorganization. The president
and vice-president will remain as they stand. All
other voting members will change.
In place of the present nine elected members from
the student body will be four elected members-at
large, two each from upper and lower division. Why
this change? Because with the four-quarter system
the class divisions will disappear.
But what difference does it make if they do dis
appear? The members of Excom are elected by the
whole student body, not by,a class. The present sys
tem has all the advantages of members-at-large to
gether with the assurance that the officers will be
spread evenly over the three or four years of college
life.
This reduction from nine to four elected members
stands to seriously lessen the chances of getting a rep
resentative cross section of students on Excom. The
present system doesn't always achieve this but the
suggested plan has even less chance.

PART to compensate for this reduction two new
offices are suggested. They are the presidents of
the Associated Men and Women. These organizations
correspond roughly to the present Women's Confer
ence.
These have a rather strained representation down
through various assemblies and councils until they
reach the living groups. Women's Conference serves
some purpose, but a similar organization for men would
fall far short of being of value. The chairman of Wom
en's Conference is a member of Excom without a
vote, and rightly so. Why then duplicate this office for
men and hand them votes, they are not representative.
If they are elected at large by the students what
difference if they are from the present elected mem
bers? It is foolish to make a new office that has noth
ing to offer over the old one.
Several non-voting ex-officio members are thrown
in for good measure. They include a representative of
Speech and Drama, the War Activities Co-ordinator,
an Athletic Commissioner, and the Student Colonel of
R.O.T.C. these together with the non-voting Daily
Editor, Student Manager, and chairman of Men's and
Women's Councils give you an unwieldy organization
of seven voting members, seven non-voting members,
and a president. It is not an Excom, it is a discussion
group.

r |' , HERE is probably some need of readjustment of
student life, and consequently student organiza
tion, to meet the contingencies of war, but why rush
into a wild reorganization of Excom?
It would be a lot better to forget about Excom.
It's not being undermined. It accomplishes every pur
pose now that the suggested one could achieve.
If there is a need and a desire to have a co-ordina
tion of war and social activities, why not revitalize
or reorganize Cardinals to handle this job.
The best people to handle activities, committees,
and campaigns are not as a rule those that get elected
in student votings, they are appointed. Appointed
people should not vote on Excom, for they are not
representative. The solution appears to make them a
council or sub-committee on their own. a Cardinals.
Give the chairman of this group a seat on Excom, but
apart from this leave it alone.
