# CAMPUS OPINION
## RE LATE LEAVES 
### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
The vote taken in the women's living groups on
the question of changing 2:3o's to l:3o's indicated that
the women students were three-to-one against chang
ing all 2:30 s to l:3o's. But the comments made by
13 of the 17 living groups who opposed the recom
mendation indicated that the voting would have been
radically different if floating 2:3o's were permitted.
These comments will not be ignored, but will be
considered in Women's Conference, the representative
b<*ly of the women students, and taken back to the
women students for vote in accordance with our tra
dition of democratic student self-government.
Irma Jean Hannibal,
President, Women's Conference
