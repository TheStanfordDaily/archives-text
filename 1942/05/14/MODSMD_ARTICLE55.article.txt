# Japs Reinforce Spearheads Driving into Southwest China
## 
### United Press 
Japanese spearheads driving into southwest China and toward the
mountain borderline between Burma and eastern India appeared today to
have been reinforced, increasing the threats to Paoshan, important Ameri
can-operated air base on China's Burma Road, and Imphal, on the newly
built Burma-India mountain highway.

The remnants of a British Imperial,
Army which fled up the Chindwin
River valley of west Burma, after its
defeat in the Mandalay area last
month, seemed, however, to have es
caped entrapment and it was pre
sumed a majority of the British
troops now were near the Indian
border whence they can be moved to
railheads in India proper, north of
Chittagong.

There was no indication, however,
that the Nipponese planned any
land drive through the mountains
into western India and it was be
lieved they would stop at Imphal, or
a general mountain line in that area,
since their purpose is to prevent
military supplies from reaching Free
China from India by overland
routes.
Equally, it was believed, the Japa
nese drive into southwest China
probably would stop at Paoshan,
although there was a possibility they
might try to reach Kunming, capital
of Yunnan Province and an im
portant communications center,
BIG MOVE
An occupation of Kunming would
be a military operation of major
magnitude and would enable the
Japanese to restore the old railway
line from that city into French Indo-
China, which the Nipponese now
control.
New Delhi reported that heavy
American and British bombers
raided two of the main Japanese
air fields in Burma, at Myitkyina in
the northeast — whence Japanese
planes have been bombing both
China and India—and at Akqab, on
the Bay of Bengal.
