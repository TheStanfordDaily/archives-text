# Soldiers Tell Of Army Life At 12:10 Club
## 
### 
A sergeant, a corporal, and a pri
vate from the Page Mill Road camp
gave the lowdown on army life at
j the meeting of the new 12:10 Club
j in the Nitery yesterday noon. Ac
cording to them the post on the
! campus is above the average of
j camps throughout the country,
The meeting consisted of an in
formal discussion with the men led
by the program chairman, Norman
Ross. The men were asked ques
tions by members of the audience on
all phases of army lifeâ€”what they
j did with their spare time; their
morale; what happened if they went
; A.W.0.L.; and what their typical day
was like. The corporal remarked
that before the war none of them
wanted to stay in over a year, but
now morale was high and there was
more purpose to their work.
Many prospective draftees in the
! audience groaned when they heard
; that a soldier's day begins at 5:45 in
j the morning with drill starting at
; 7:30. The men from the Page Mill
Camp said that since December 7
the soldiers have been treated bet
ter by the civilians. They continued
that many of the campus organiza
tions have entertained the men at
| dances and activities. When asked
whether they preferred small house
dances or big all-campus affairs,
they said it didn't make any differ
ence as long as there were enough
girls.
