The photomontage cover of The

graphically the spirit of 1942 War
time Stanford.
Portrayed walking on the Quad

Stanford students, who are at pres
ent training for intelligent, whole
hearted contribution to victory.
In surrounding photos, they are
in the specialized work
which each will do after leaving
Stanford. In upper left, Betty Jane

fornia, who is at present a student
officer in the Stanford R.0.T.C., and
who wil begin flight instruction
as Cadet Officer with the U.S. Army
Air Corps immediately after grad
uating this June. Bill is here shown
climbing into a Vultee B-T-13. In
lower right is Robert Lewis, Zeta
Psi from Sacramento, who is now
a graduate student in the Stanford
Medical School, obtaining the fin

to fill better the urgent wartime
need for trained physicians.
