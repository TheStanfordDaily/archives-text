# Crary Tells Farm Alumni Of Student War Effort
## 
### 
May 14. 1942
TO STANFORD ALUMNI:
This special edition of The Stan
ford Daily brings you a student's
or Quad's eyeview of Stanford in
the war—of wartime laboratory
projects, of faculty war services, of
student war training.
The story of faculty war service
and war work in the laboratories is
most impressive but even this issue
of the DAILY cannot tell the full
story because the importance of
many projects necessitates their be
ing known only to those who are
working directly on them.
Student war training is both easy
and difficult to write about. Ap
parent to everyone are the advan
tages to be derived from a four
quarter, full-time, continuous
schedule and from a streamlined,
wartime curriculum. Apparent,
also, are the student activities in
behalf of the war. "Car-less Days,"
"Dimes for Diplomas." and the like.
But one of the important phases
of student war training is not at

all apparent And that is the num
ber of men who now are actually
enlisted in one of the military
services and who. at the suggestion
of these very services, are remain
ing in school to complete their
training.
Doesn't that tell more clearly
than anything else the govern
ment's view of the importance of
universities to the war program?
And. doesn't it demonstrate most
convincingly that gifts in support
of Stanford do a real job as well
for the nation at war?
We think it does, and when 150
of us told this story a couple of
months ago to friends and alumni
here on the peninsula, they thought
so, too, by responding with twice
as much in gifts as they had ever
sent in before.
Won't you join them by sending
a contribution to Stanford? Your
gift will do a double job if made in
War Stamps or Konds.

training.
Doesn't that tell more clearly
than anything else the govern
ment's view of the importance of
universities to the war program?
And. doesn't it demonstrate most
convincingly that gifts in support
of Stanford do a real job as well
for the nation at war?
We think it does, and when 150
of us told this story a couple of
months ago to friends and alumni
here on the peninsula, they thought
so, too, by responding with twice
as much in gifts as they had ever
sent in before.
Won't you join them by sending
a contribution to Stanford? Your
gift will do a double job if made in
War Stamps or Konds.

TO STANFORD ALUMNI:
This special edition of The Stan
ford Daily brings you a student's
or Quad's eyeview of Stanford in
the war—of wartime laboratory
projects, of faculty war services, of
student war training.
The story of faculty war service
and war work in the laboratories is
most impressive but even this issue
of the DAILY cannot tell the full
story because the importance of
many projects necessitates their be
ing known only to those who are
working directly on them.
Student war training is both easy
and difficult to write about. Ap
parent to everyone are the advan
tages to be derived from a four
quarter, full-time, continuous
schedule and from a streamlined,
wartime curriculum. Apparent,
also, are the student activities in
behalf of the war. "Car-less Days,"
"Dimes for Diplomas." and the like.
But one of the important phases
of student war training is not at

all apparent And that is the num
ber of men who now are actually
enlisted in one of the military
services and who. at the suggestion
of these very services, are remain
ing in school to complete their
training.
Doesn't that tell more clearly
than anything else the govern
ment's view of the importance of
universities to the war program?
And. doesn't it demonstrate most
convincingly that gifts in support
of Stanford do a real job as well
for the nation at war?
We think it does, and when 150
of us told this story a couple of
months ago to friends and alumni
here on the peninsula, they thought
so, too, by responding with twice
as much in gifts as they had ever
sent in before.
Won't you join them by sending
a contribution to Stanford? Your
gift will do a double job if made in
War Stamps or Konds.
