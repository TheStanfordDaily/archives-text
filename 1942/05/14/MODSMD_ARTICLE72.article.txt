# Victory in the Offing?

//r'phis is reality. We are right up against the guns."
jl Since Stanford students heard Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur make this statement immediately after Pearl Harbor,
Stanford has expanded into a vast wartime program aimed
squarely at the goal of the United Nations —bringing to justice
the world's criminals, and founding an intelligent peace.
Every important contribution of the University, from its re
search laboratories, by its professors in government wartime
administration, through its four-quarter-a-year academic pro
gram, and through its student War Activities Committee, is de
scribed in this special Victory Edition. The University's record,
chronicled herewith, speaks for itself.
No other metropolitan or college daily newspaper in the
'country has presented an edition of this kind, to our information.
Besides distribution to Stanford students and regular subscrib
ers, this edition goes to over 5,000 alumni in the San Francisco
Bay area, to every newspaper of major circulation in the United
States, and to the Treasury Department. Total gross circulation
is over 11,000.
* * ★
The United States is now waging offensive warfare. It has
carried destruction to Tokyo and imposed humiliating defeat
upon the Japanese navy. At last we can believe we are not only
out-producing the enemy, but we are out-murdering the enemy.
In doing this, no single life remains untouched. At Stanford
and in all universities, students must complete their college
training as soon as possible. It is not in the cards to spend the
summer sunning on a beach—not when the country is at war.
Saving toothpaste tubes and buying war stamps weekly is
not enough at Stanford. Men who are enlisted in some branch
of the service and deferred from training until graduation should
not stop there; conseravtion of tires, automobiles and food should
be as conscientious and habitual as that of any person trained
for all-out work on the home front. They must spend money
wisely and keep themselves in top physical shape.
There is no room in the University's war factory for nitwits
who drive their cars in blackouts, or who drench with waterbags
prostrate "casualties" awaiting "treatment" during disaster re
hearsals.
Each individual must direct his life into intelligent contribu
tion toward victory.
Only in this way can our fighting men hope to "hit the enemy
and hit him again, wherever they find him."

chronicled herewith, speaks for itself.
No other metropolitan or college daily newspaper in the
'country has presented an edition of this kind, to our information.
Besides distribution to Stanford students and regular subscrib

Bay area, to every newspaper of major circulation in the United
States, and to the Treasury Department. Total gross circulation
is over 11,000.

The United States is now waging offensive warfare. It has
carried destruction to Tokyo and imposed humiliating defeat
upon the Japanese navy. At last we can believe we are not only
out-producing the enemy, but we are out-murdering the enemy.
In doing this, no single life remains untouched. At Stanford
and in all universities, students must complete their college
training as soon as possible. It is not in the cards to spend the
summer sunning on a beach—not when the country is at war.
Saving toothpaste tubes and buying war stamps weekly is
not enough at Stanford. Men who are enlisted in some branch
of the service and deferred from training until graduation should
not stop there; conseravtion of tires, automobiles and food should
be as conscientious and habitual as that of any person trained
for all-out work on the home front. They must spend money
wisely and keep themselves in top physical shape.
There is no room in the University's war factory for nitwits
who drive their cars in blackouts, or who drench with waterbags
prostrate "casualties" awaiting "treatment" during disaster re
hearsals.
Each individual must direct his life into intelligent contribu
tion toward victory.
Only in this way can our fighting men hope to "hit the enemy
and hit him again, wherever they find him."

//r'phis is reality. We are right up against the guns."
jl Since Stanford students heard Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur make this statement immediately after Pearl Harbor,
Stanford has expanded into a vast wartime program aimed
squarely at the goal of the United Nations —bringing to justice
the world's criminals, and founding an intelligent peace.
Every important contribution of the University, from its re
search laboratories, by its professors in government wartime
administration, through its four-quarter-a-year academic pro
gram, and through its student War Activities Committee, is de
scribed in this special Victory Edition. The University's record,
