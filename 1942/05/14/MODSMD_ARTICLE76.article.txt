# COMPULSORY P.E. URGED
## Faculty Plan Submitted To Wilbur 
### 
Compulsory physical education
for all Stanford undergraduate men
and women, involving a far-reach
ing proposal to enlarge the School
of Health, was recommended by
the school's faculty in a meeting
this week, according to Dr. O. N.
Andersen, general director.
Purpose of the plan is to attain
student wartime physical fitness,
and the recommendation is now in
the hands of Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur and the Faculty Ath
letic Committee.
The proposal:
"A Recommendation: That all
regularly enrolled undergraduate
students be required to complete
successfully one unit of credit in
physical education for each quar
ter in registration at Stanford.
"Any adjustment in this require
ment is subject to the approval of
the Directors of the School of
Health (for men and women)."
ACTION PENDS
Dr. Oswald N. Andersen, general,
director of the School of Health,
emphasized the fact that the plan is
only a recommendation, and final
action is entirely up to the execu
tive committee and the Chancellor.
Junior transfers and Lower Divi
sion advanced students would be
held for the requirement only for
the time that they are registered in
the University.
The program is divided into five
categories, and each student would
have to complete at least one quar
ter in each group. These divisions
are aquatic sports, body contact
sports, gymnastics, individual
sports, and team sports.
EXPANSION SEEN
Students would be required to
meet certain requirements of each
group. For example, if a student is
unable to swim, he would not be
permitted to leave that group until
he could swim at least 50 yards.
If the plan is adopted, it is esti
mated that the School of Health
would have to provide for 1.500
more students. Dr. Andersen said
the physical plant is more than
adequate to meet the needs.
Upon entrance into the Univer
sity, each student would be given
a physical fitness test, which would
aid the department to suggest what
activities should be taken to build
up the body. This test measures
the strength, agility, and co-ordi
nation of the student.
YALE LEADS
The women's program would be
expanded to include new activities.
At the present all women's courses
are elective, except for dancing.
Yale has already started a com
pulsory program. U.S.C. has
scrapped its minor sport program
and requires that each student
have at least fiv* hours a week of
physical education. The plan as
adopted by the University of Ore
gon includes graduate students as
well as undergraduates. They
have always made it compulsory
to have at least two years of physi
cal education in addition to the
K.O.T.C.
JACKSON SPEAKS
George Jackson, student body
president, told the meeting of the
proposal reached at the Pacific
States Presidents' Association at
Sun Valley two weeks ago, which
included essentially what the fac
ulty acted upon.
Dr. Andersen and Dean of Men
John Bunn emphasized that thus
program will not curtail intercol
legiate competition, for one of the
groups includes team sports. But
all men who participate in com
petitive sports will have to fulfill
the requirements of the other four
group®.

Compulsory physical education
for all Stanford undergraduate men
and women, involving a far-reach
ing proposal to enlarge the School
of Health, was recommended by
the school's faculty in a meeting
this week, according to Dr. O. N.
Andersen, general director.
Purpose of the plan is to attain
student wartime physical fitness,
and the recommendation is now in
the hands of Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur and the Faculty Ath
letic Committee.
The proposal:
"A Recommendation: That all
regularly enrolled undergraduate
students be required to complete
successfully one unit of credit in
physical education for each quar
ter in registration at Stanford.
"Any adjustment in this require
ment is subject to the approval of
the Directors of the School of
Health (for men and women)."
ACTION PENDS
Dr. Oswald N. Andersen, general,
director of the School of Health,
emphasized the fact that the plan is
only a recommendation, and final
action is entirely up to the execu
tive committee and the Chancellor.
Junior transfers and Lower Divi
sion advanced students would be
held for the requirement only for
the time that they are registered in
the University.
The program is divided into five
categories, and each student would
have to complete at least one quar
ter in each group. These divisions
are aquatic sports, body contact
sports, gymnastics, individual
sports, and team sports.
EXPANSION SEEN
Students would be required to
meet certain requirements of each
group. For example, if a student is
unable to swim, he would not be
permitted to leave that group until
he could swim at least 50 yards.
If the plan is adopted, it is esti
mated that the School of Health
would have to provide for 1.500
more students. Dr. Andersen said
the physical plant is more than
adequate to meet the needs.
Upon entrance into the Univer
sity, each student would be given
a physical fitness test, which would
aid the department to suggest what
activities should be taken to build
up the body. This test measures
the strength, agility, and co-ordi
nation of the student.
YALE LEADS
The women's program would be
expanded to include new activities.
At the present all women's courses
are elective, except for dancing.
Yale has already started a com
pulsory program. U.S.C. has
scrapped its minor sport program
and requires that each student
have at least fiv* hours a week of
physical education. The plan as
adopted by the University of Ore
gon includes graduate students as
well as undergraduates. They
have always made it compulsory
to have at least two years of physi
cal education in addition to the
K.O.T.C.
JACKSON SPEAKS
George Jackson, student body
president, told the meeting of the
proposal reached at the Pacific
States Presidents' Association at
Sun Valley two weeks ago, which
included essentially what the fac
ulty acted upon.
Dr. Andersen and Dean of Men
John Bunn emphasized that thus
program will not curtail intercol
legiate competition, for one of the
groups includes team sports. But
all men who participate in com
petitive sports will have to fulfill
the requirements of the other four
