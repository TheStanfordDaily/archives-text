### 
Far from being a "military objective," Stanford is, nevertheless, ready for
any eventuality. If and when bombs fall on the Quad, students and faculty
will be at their disaster posts as air raid wardens, first aid dispensers, R.O.T.C.
guards, and in the mobile unit. Since December 7, all campus buildings have
been furnished with large cans of sand for incendiaries; bright lights burn
all night on the Quad to protect research laboratories from sabotage; air raid
shelters have been constructed in the women's dormitories, others are nov/
being prepared; crews of disaster workers attend classes each week for ad
vanced training; disaster drills are occasionally held. Pictured below are a
part of Stanford's emergency control centers and first aid crews at work.
