# When the Real Thing Comes, Stanford Will Be Well Prepared

### BILL HORNBY 
Some night, while the campus
sleeps, an enemy bomber may bring
World War II down to the Farm,
and then Stanford will learn the
: eal story of more than GOO campus
residents who have trained pa
"< iently since Pearl Harbor, just to
be ready.
They will be ready to give first
aid, to drive ambulances, to per
' <<m rescue work, to fight regular
fires, to put out incendiary fires, to
carry messages, to enforce blackout
regulations under actual bombing.
' r hey are ready to do these things
i might, just as they were ready to
Ho them last night and the night
before.
.Stanford will fight its war from

FARM DEFENSE LEADERS
KNOW WHAT IS COMING
While faculty members pour into
this defense brain, the other cam
pus defense leaders know what is
coming and are ready to mobilize
their units on a further signal.
"Fourth Interceptor Command—
SIGNAL BLUE." The secondary
blue signal is a sign that the RED
is on the way. and the guard is
ready to pull the light switches for
all of Stanford's streets, the Inner
Quad, and the arcades. At the
same time he prepares to give the
siren alarm.
At strategic spots 011 the campus
phone boxes have been located
which have direct connection with
a bank of eight phones in the
control center. Waiting for the
RED signal, center officials are
ready to check the arrival of sector
wardens and crews at these spots
as soon as the siren announces the
general alert.
HOOVER LIRE SIREN
WAILS AT RED SIGNAL
"Interceptor signal RED—RED—
I>ED—" The Hoover Libe wails,
the lights go off, and Joe Smith in
Toyon knows that he might as well
forget about his big "study night "
In case of a surprise attack, only
the RED signal would be sounded.
The operations that would pull the
switches and sound the raid sirens
can be done by a single guard in
about two seconds.
Now all of Stanford is "off the
dime." Your roommate in Enema
has his trousers half on and soon
will be at his post as a member of
one of the six R.O.T.C. batteries
that mobilize immediately at the
sound of the siren. Dorm and
sorority girls arrive at the B.A.C.
first-aid station, cold cream, hair
up, etc. At each of the sector

phones, small groups collect, wait
ing for orders from the control
room.
Fire engines and the police.

fied, are function
ing at strategic
spots on the cam
pus's air raid war
dens calm their
assorted broods, A
and Encina sticks
its collective head

out of the windows to see what's
up.
In the nerve center, the siren
signal starts a steady stream of
phoning which doesn't cease until
the all-clear. "Center calling Post
. Staff present?—Check—Mes
sengers present?— Check. Report?
—Check." Seven phones are go
ing at once, and fire and medical
crews are made up and dispatched
to the disaster spots.
POST REPORTS FIRE.
SENDS CREW TO SCENE
That isn't any fake raid this time.
"Post 2 reports incendiary fire
300 yards north Toyon—prelimi
nary steps taken." The nerve cen
ter snds a messenger out, and a
fire crew is on the way.
Every man, piece of equipment,
and their location are known at
the center at any time. On a huge
map, an attendant checks off the
location of any disaster reports.
The hospital checks in to ask for
more stretchers. Repair crews for
water mains and gas mains receive
their orders. Meanwhile, the radio
drones the activities of police in
neighboring towns, enabling Stan
ford to keep tab on Bay Area ac
tivity.
All of this is taking place in a
few minutes' time, but the sys
tem works almost from second na
ture. In the darkened rooms, the
students sit and tell the latest; in
the nerve center the officials know
the latest, and they can take care
of it.
The watch boxes are primarily
a vast reporting network. The
blackout is hardly distinguishable,
but thcv know everything that is

happening in their sector. Private
cars and station wagons desig
nated as ambulances bring disaster
victims to the receiving center, al
ready given first aid.
The control room is under ter
rific strain. At any moment news
may come of a major disaster. All
of the nerve center lines are un
derground. but a hit near them
might disrupt Stanford's entire de
fense.
Six hundred people are located
around the Quad, by the Art Gal
lery, out at the Museum, on the
Row. The nerve center knows
where every one of them is, and it
is responsible for seeing" that they
yet their orders, straight and on

time.
"Fourth Interceptor Signal —
WHITE — WHITE." ' The center
guard checks off each watch box
group, then pulls the siren switch
for the all-clear. The lights go on.
But the job isn't done.
Under artificial conditions, a
check-up of equipment and meet
ings of defense officials carries the
activity several hours more after
the Farm goes back to bed. And
then, after they are gone, the guard
pulls out his Poli Sci book. It's 2:30
a.m., and all he hears is the story
of an Alameda grass fire—no jive!
He is sitting there now, waiting
for next time.

FARM DEFENSE LEADERS

While faculty members pour into

coming and are ready to mobilize
their units on a further signal.
"Fourth Interceptor Command—

ready to pull the light switches for
all of Stanford's streets, the Inner
Quad, and the arcades. At the

At strategic spots 011 the campus
phone boxes have been located
which have direct connection with
a bank of eight phones in the
