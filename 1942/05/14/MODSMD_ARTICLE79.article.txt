# Farm's USO Goes All Out For Morale
## 
### 
All out for morale, Stanford has
been doing its part for the service
men in this vicinity through a se
ries of dances, dinners and picnics.
Initiated first as individual ven
tures, the whole program has now
been co-ordinated under the Stan
ford War Activities Committee.
During the Winter Quarter, nu
merous individual women's living
groups gave parties for the sol
diers who are stationed around
the campus, particularly Page Mill
road. Camp Alto, Moffett Field,
Sunnyvale, and Belmont.
These parties like those which
were given under the more com
pletely organized co-ordination of
the Stanford U.S.O. bureau, in
cluded dancing, refreshments, and
games.
CLEARING HOUSE
With the setting up of this Stan
ford U.S.O. committee, all dates to
entertain the soldiers are cleared
through it. If any living group
wants to invite some service men
to dinner, it has only to call the
bureau, which in turn will contact
the camp, arrange for transporta
tion, and the number of men which
can be accomodated.
Entertainment for soldiers and
sailors is not only popular among
the more highly organized women's
groups, but also has been provided
by a few of the men's groups.
WOMEN'S ACTIVITIES
All of the nine sororities on the
Row and the other women's or
ganizations, such as the Lagunita
Casas, Manzanita, the Oaks, Ma
drono and Ventura have enter
tained men and have contributed
phonograph records, cigarettes,
new magazines, and magazine sub
scriptions to the soldiers near here
as well as those stationed in San
Francisco awaiting ships to carx-y
tliem overseas.
Some fraternities have had serv
ice men to dinner, but they, as a
rule, have more informal enter
tainments such as picnics.
CAVALRY DANCE
The largest entertainment under
taking for soldiers was the dance
given for the 107 th Cavalry unit in
the women's gym, April 29.
The soldiers provided their own
band and intermission entertain
ment, and ten women from each
women's living group volunteered
to date the soldiers.
"All the entertaining has been
by invitation," Ann Bossmger said
in reference to the co-operative
spirit of the different groups.
She further commented that
Stanford is becoming more and
more conscious of the war and the
ways it can help military morale.
TURN-ABOUT
The entertaining has not been all
one-sided. Not only have the Stan
ford women been entertaining for
the Army but now the Army has
entertained Stanford women.
The soldiers stationed at Belmont
Country Club recently entertained
at the Farm were so appreciative
that they invited 15 Stanford wom
en to one of their dances last Satur
day night. They provided chaper
ones and also transportationâ€”a ton
and a half truck for the girls and a
jeep for the chaperone.
