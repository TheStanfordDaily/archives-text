Senator Stanford had endowed the
University in 1885, and by 1887
enough preliminary work had been
done on the University's future site
to begin the construction of the
Farm's buildings. There was some
argument as to the date on which
the University's cornerstone should
be laid, but Senator Stanford, backed
by Mrs. Stanford, finally won out,
selecting May 14.
May 14 was a date which was par
ticularly significant for the Stan
fords. On that day in 1866 the Stan
fords' only son, Leland Junior, was
born, and since the Senator and Mrs.
Stanford had named the University
after their son, they determined to
have the school's cornerstone laid
on Leland Junior's birthday.
The ceremony of the cornerstone
laying was simple. The Rev. Horatio
Stebbins, one of the University's
original trustees, read the prayer of
dedication. Judge Lorenzo Sawyer,
another member of the first Board
of Trustees, spoke. A hymn was
sung 11' the First Presbyterian
Church of Mcnlo Park, which was
followed by a reading.
It was Senator and Mrs. Stanford's
ardent hope that the University they
had founded for their son would
live and turn out men and women
such as they had hoped their son
would be.
