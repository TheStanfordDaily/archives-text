# British Renovate Old Rags, Bones, Metals
## 
### 
Used articles are re-used for war
conservation in Great Britain.
Milk-bottle caps go back to the
milkman, left-over food is col
lected. scraps of paper, rags, bones
and metal end up in factories.
Worn-out batteries yield brass for
uniform buttons, copper for shells,
zinc for camp utensils and graph
ite for machine grease.
Wrecked ships and cars provide
1.000 tons of scrap a week. Four
million dollars' worth of metal came
from bombed sites last year. Chil
dren are even collecting wisps of
sheep wool that get snagged on
hedges and fences and turning
them in.
