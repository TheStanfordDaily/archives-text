# Mrs. Rollins Does More Than Her Part
## 
### BILL STEIF 
Mrs. E. W. Rollins does the
cleaning at the Alpha Phi house.
Plump, rosy-cheeked, and with
a sweet smile for everyone, she
leaves the house pin-neat at the
end of each day. Then she goes
home to her husband and her house
on Pope street in Palo Alto. The
pair live alone and Mr. Rollins
works in Palo Alto while his wife
cleans the Alpha Phi house.
When the war broke out last De
cember 7, Mrs. Rollins, or Viola—
to her friends—thought it was too
bad that she did not have a son to
help win the war. So she and Mr.
Rollins decided to do the next best
thing they could think of to aid
the United States.
They decided to buy a $25 War
Bond each month. They decided to
have several soldiers home every
so often for a meal. They decided
to send several little presents to
the men at camps around Palo Alto.
Now the Rollins have five bonds.
Two or three soldiers eat and re
lax at the Rollins home every two
weeks. Mrs. Rollins bakes cakes
for the service men around Palo
Alto.
Mrs. Rollins says, "We had no
sons to give, so we thought we
ought to sacrifice the little we can
. . . . it's just a little, not very
much."
And, sweetly smiling as she goes
back to her vacuum cleaner, she
adds, "We've got to win the war."
There seems to be a good deal of
truth in that smile.
