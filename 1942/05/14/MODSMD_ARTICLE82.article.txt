# Chaplain Tells War Credos

### 
''The Christian Church is divided
between those who are convinced
that the teachings of Christ are
against war and those who believe
that the teachings necessitate war,"
said Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Uni
versity chaplain, in a recent in
terview.
Both of these factions have in
common the fact that they are will
ing to undertake courageously the
sacrifices which their position en
tails, the chaplain explained.
This mood is sharply distinct
from that of those who desire to
save their own skin. He said that
the Christian pacifist is closer m
spirit to the soldier than to the iso
lationist.
"The church in America is try
ing to arouse the people to the se
riousness of the situation and to
lay the ground work for a just and
durable peace. The church is con
cerned with a new world without
recurrent thi-eats to the freedom of
man to live as he thinks best," said
Dr. Trueblood.
The war will be a denial of what
the United States stands for, if the
peace is based on hatred and re
revenge, the chaplain declared. The
motives for the peace must be
"wonderful, positive and an or
dered world must be built" in
which the causes of war are re
moved, he added.
"One of the most important
causes of war is the snobbishness
of the whites to colored peoples
and to other races," he said. "The
sacrifice of the war will be wasted
if the old status quo of far-flung
imperialism is re-established."
Dr. Trueblood has met refugees
both abroad and in America, and
has seen how the Nazi system of
life affects its victims.
'A world must be produced in
which the wanton cruelty of the
last decade is made impossible be
cause of some kind of world gov
ernment, under human impulses,"
he concluded.
