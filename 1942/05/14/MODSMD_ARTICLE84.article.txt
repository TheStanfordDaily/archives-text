# Junk Shows Golden Hue In Farm Salvage Drive
## 
### 
Three tons of paper. 400 pounds
of cardboard, 650 old books, 90
pounds of tinfoil, 8 large boxes of
clothes, and other articles too nu
merous to mention stand in testi
mony of eight weeks of work by
Stanford's "Salvage for Victory"
workers.
"Our purpose is to get salvage
able goods back into wartime pro
duction," states Ed Porter, chair
man for the drive, which is one of
the major divisions of Stanford's
wartime activities.
GARAGE-FULL OF JUNK
And judging by the garage-full
of material in the backyard next
to the A.K.L. house, the collection
committee consisting of Dick Bar
ger and his assistants, A1 Miossi,
Jack Drach, and Bill Hays, has suc
ceeded.
The paper will be processed by a
San Jose firm into fiber-board to
be used to pack shells, the silk
stockings will be used to make
parachutes, readable magazines are
given to army camps, shoes are
given to charity organizations, and
clothes unable to be used as such
are cut up and used in paper pro
duction.
COLLECT SCRAP IRON
In addition to these goods, Bar
ger and his helpers, using Bell
and Tomaso's old coke truck, have

collected mounds of iron and alu
minum articles, 250 pounds of old
addressograph plates from the li
brary, and miscellaneous articles
such as old chandeliers, tennis
rackets, doors and windows, and
auto parts.
"All sororities, Roble, and Lagu
nita have been particularly co
operative since the start of our
work,'* commented Barger, who
has given up his Thursday and
Friday afternoons for the past
eight weeks to do collection work.
Dinny Sick is in charge of all
sororities; Callie Curtis, Roble; and
Susan Wright, Lagunita.
CO-OPERATION NEEDED
"It's been a lot of fun watching
the junk pile, grow," Barger stated.
"But we have been discouraged at
times when nobody had anything
for us and when the truck would
not start, which was plenty often.'*
"Some groups have co-operated
very little, while others, have done
a great deal. It helps us out very
much to have papers segregated
from other materials and placed in
a convenient spot every week for
collection," he added.
"Even though the campus sal
vage agency has taken over our
job, the new collectors would ap
preciate greater co-operation by
the students a great deal," he con
cluded.
