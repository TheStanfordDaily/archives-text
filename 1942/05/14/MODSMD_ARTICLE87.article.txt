# Bond Interest Greater Than Given by Banks
## 
### 
The buyer of war bonds is not
only putting his faith in the United
Nations' victory but, according to
Treasury Department releases, is
also making an investment which
pays approximately one per cent
better than any investment that
could be made in a private concern
or in a national bank.
The series E bond, meeting the
needs of the small investor, pays
2.9 per cent interest a year com
pounded semi-annually. It is, as
the Treasury Department points
out, an appreciation bond issued
on a discount basis.
This means that such bonds in
crease in redemption value at the
end of the first year from their
issue date and gradually become
more valuable during each succes
sive half-year period thereafter un
til their maturity, at which time
the full amount becomes payable.
The bonds mature at the end of
ten years. The prices and maturity
values of series E bonds are as fol
low:
Issued Price Maturity Value
$ 18.75 $ 25.00
37.50 50.00
75.00 100.00
375.00 500.00
750.00 1.000.00

There are no "rookie"' dollars.
