# BAC Plans To Retrench Due to War
## 
### 
Although the war has not yc-i
made a noticeable cut in athletio
crowds, Stanford's B.A.C. expect j
such curtailment next year, par
ticularly in football, main' source
of athletic revenue. In view of tho
expected drop it has initiated a re
trenchment policy in the financing
of the athletic program.
Southern trips for track, base
ball, swimming, and tennis wer.j
approved by the Board of Athleti J
Control by a narrow five to foin*
vote.
In a later meeting, the Board de
cided not to grant funds for send
ing golf and tennis teams east to
the national championships thij
summer,
CLARK BIG LOSS
Biggest loss to Stanford athletics
was Clark Shaughnessy's decision
to accept a position at the Uni
versity of Maryland where iootball
will not be so much hampered by
the emergency situation.
Another change was made when
Nort Thornton, swimming coach,
resigned his post after many suc
cessful seasons. Thornton and sev
eral other coaches were told by tho
B.AC, that due to the emergency
they could not be sure of then
positions next fall. These men wero
given chances to seek jobs else
where, but until this time Thornton
is the only coach to have turned Li
a resignation.
Other new trends in wartime ath
letics include Head Coach Jim Law
son's new attitude on the football
field. In spring he told his squad
he expected the "ruggedest" brand
of football ever played at Stan
ford. Since the accent is now on
physical conditioning many more
men are turning out for bodily con
tact sports. New to Stanford are
the hiking trips on Sundays, spon
sored by the Palo Alto physical
fitness program.
WAR IIITS BLOWS
The war has also made some di
rect hits on Stanford athletics, rob
bing the track squad of its out
standing runner, Francis Olsonâ€”
who turned in a 1:53 half before
the season was even under way,
and then was inducted into the
Army.
Most of the athletes on the Farm
who are eligible for competition
next year have assured their stay
ing on until graduation by enlist
ing in V-7, Marine Candidate Class,
and other branches of service which
allow the men to remain in school
until graduation.
In addition, there is a definite
swing toward enlarging the intra
mural program, and should the
football season be seriously cut into
by crowd bans, intramural compe
tition will be established between
the bay area schools.
