# War Stamp Day Quota Set at $1500
## Committee Arranges Three New Outlets For Stamp Purchases 
### 
With a $1500 quota and three more
outlets for today's War Stamp sales,
Stanford's fourth "War Stamp Day"
is geared for a new record.
Intent on topping last week's rec
ord total of $1154.75, Sylvia Berry
and Irv Hellman, War Stamp heads,
have increased the number of out
lets where stamps may be purchased
from eleven to fourteen.
The three new outlets are the golf
course, Men's Gym Store, and the
B.A.C.
CAMPUS SALES BOOTHS
Stamps may be purchased in any
living group today, and at War
Stamp booths on the Engineering
Corner, English Corner, Main Libra
ry, and Union Cellar. The Union and
Encina Barber Shops, Union Cigar
Counter, Encina Store, Bookstore,
and Campus Service Station will
also sell War Stamps today.
War Stamp sales have steadily
climbed since the first "War Stamp
Day," four weeks ago. The first
week's sales were $505, the second
week's $925.75, and last week's
sales reached $1154.75. Total sales
for the first three weeks arc $2585.50.
If the $1500 goal set for today is
readied, Stanford's total will top
$4000, enough to buy eight army
"peeps."
ALL SALES COUNT
Irv Hellman, co-chairman of the
Stamp program, emphasized that any
War Stamps purchased on campus
will add to Stanford's total. This in
cludes any faculty members who
may buy stamps, Hellman added.
Results of today's total sales and
the percentage of students who
bought War Stamps in each living
group will be published in tomor
row's Daily.
