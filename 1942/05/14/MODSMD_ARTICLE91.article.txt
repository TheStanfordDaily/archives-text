# R.O.T.C. Gives Training To Future Army Officers
## 
### 
With enrollment zooming over
its last year's total, the Stanford
R.O.T.C. unit is today playing an
important part in training officers
for active participation in the
United Nations' victory drive.
Giving students the opportunity
to come out for officer's training
five days a week, the Stanford Field
Artillery and Ordnance units of
the R.O.T.C. are every day fitting
more and more Farm men to be
come officers in one of those two
branches of the Army. Stanford
ites who complete their four-year
training period in the "R. 0." enter
the army as Second Lieutenants
and after completing several
months of active training, find
themselves full-fledged officers.
BASIC TRAINING
Students spend their first two
years in the "R. 0." getting basic
training in gunnery, fire-controL,

communication,
and horsemanship.
From this they
graduate to ad
vanced instruction
in the more tech
nical aspects of
strategy
and administra
tion.

Recently several new training
improvements have been added to
this Stanford R.O.T.C. set-up. The

government has given the Univer
sity a number of new horses
through the remount service and
several new 75-millimeter guns for
instruction purposes.
In addition, work has just been
completed on a miniature "battle
ground" where students can act
ually see the tactical situations in
field artillery strategy. During the
past few weeks, in fact, "R. 0." stu
dents have been instructing and
drilling cannoneers in occupation
of positions and simulated fire of
the new guns.
"R. 0." BLACKOUT WORK
In case of blackouts the R.O.T.C.
has been assigned to guard posts
throughout the campus.
Since Pearl Harbor almost all of
the men in charge of Stanford's
"R. 0." unit have ben promoted.
Harry B. Allen, head of the unit,
has been raised from a Lieutenant
Colonel to a full Colonel; Edward
J. Soares, chief of Stanford's Ord
nance division, has been promoted
from Captain to Major, and almost
all the other officers and non-com
missioned men in the unit have
been promoted at least one grade.
Plans are now being made to
continue regular R.O.T.C. training
throughout summer quarter.
Interest rate on a defense bond
is 2.9 per cent a year.

Plans are now being made to
continue regular R.O.T.C. training
throughout summer quarter.
Interest rate on a defense bond
is 2.9 per cent a year.

With enrollment zooming over
its last year's total, the Stanford
R.O.T.C. unit is today playing an
important part in training officers
for active participation in the
United Nations' victory drive.
Giving students the opportunity
to come out for officer's training
five days a week, the Stanford Field
Artillery and Ordnance units of
the R.O.T.C. are every day fitting
more and more Farm men to be
come officers in one of those two
branches of the Army. Stanford
ites who complete their four-year
training period in the "R. 0." enter
the army as Second Lieutenants
and after completing several
months of active training, find
themselves full-fledged officers.
BASIC TRAINING
Students spend their first two
years in the "R. 0." getting basic
training in gunnery, fire-controL,

communication,
and horsemanship.
From this they
graduate to ad
vanced instruction
in the more tech
nical aspects of
strategy
and administra
tion.

Recently several new training
improvements have been added to
this Stanford R.O.T.C. set-up. The

government has given the Univer
sity a number of new horses
through the remount service and
several new 75-millimeter guns for
instruction purposes.
In addition, work has just been
completed on a miniature "battle
ground" where students can act
ually see the tactical situations in
field artillery strategy. During the
past few weeks, in fact, "R. 0." stu
dents have been instructing and
drilling cannoneers in occupation
of positions and simulated fire of
the new guns.
"R. 0." BLACKOUT WORK
In case of blackouts the R.O.T.C.
has been assigned to guard posts
throughout the campus.
Since Pearl Harbor almost all of
the men in charge of Stanford's
"R. 0." unit have ben promoted.
Harry B. Allen, head of the unit,
has been raised from a Lieutenant
Colonel to a full Colonel; Edward
J. Soares, chief of Stanford's Ord
nance division, has been promoted
from Captain to Major, and almost
all the other officers and non-com
missioned men in the unit have
been promoted at least one grade.
