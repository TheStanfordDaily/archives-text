# Dimes, Quarters Help Pay U. S. War Bill

### 
In the three Stanford Stamp
Days, students and teachers have
bought enough War Stamps and
Bonds to provide the armed forces
with five motor trailers, 260 tents,
or 14 submachine guns or Navy
life floats. If Stanford could main
tain a $1200-per-week average for
stamp and bond sales for one year,
the government would be able to
buy with Farm contributions 133
propellers for training planes, three
pontoon bridges, or 50 reconnais
sance cars.
