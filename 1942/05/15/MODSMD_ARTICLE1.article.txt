# Spring Show To Hit Hall Boards Tonight With Comic Bounce
## Breckner, O'Neill, Redmon Star In Fast-Moving Bulotti Musical 
### 
The Muheiin-Zclver epic, "A Sale of Two Cit'es," opens in the Memo
rial Theater at 8:15 t«nii«lit with what promises to be one of the better
spring shows in recent years.
Directed l»,y John Lawry, the famed, inimitable comic, the show
has conflict (of a sort), satire, comedy, romance, music, and the inevitable

sex. In other words, all the ele
ments of a hit are there.
The' comedy's leads are taken by
Bob O'Neill, Bob Breckner, and
Dori Redmon. As the simple Wichita
multi-millionaire O'Neill comes to
Los Angeles looking for a good in
vestment. With him is his not-so
simple daughter, Dori Redmon. They
immediately are confronted by Los
Angeles' suave and super-forward
publicity agent in the person of
Breckner. This leads into competi
tion with the Miami Beach press
agent, played by Jim Cooper, and
from that point the plot moves into
a series of complicated and extreme
ly funny situations.
MILLIONAIRE'S CASH
Involved in the plot to keep the
millionaire's cash in Los Angeles are
Meyer Metro, staged by John Bou
cher, William Randolph Cain, por
trayed by John High, the personal
movie columnist of Cain's 85 news
papers, Louella Bagaroo, played by
Jeanne Smith, and the tippling
Mayor of Los Angeles, portrayed by
Bill Graham.
The Miami Beach bloc is repre
sented by a bathing-suited chorus of
16 or 18 women which features
Marei Baum.
MUSIC LOWDOWN
The show's music is lowdown and
effective. Particularly good are the
Redmon-Breckner duet which winds
up one scene and a quartet number
sung by Marci Baum, Brownlee
Corrin, Jim Cooper, and Jack Coy.
Further comic relief is provided
by H. D. Thoreau and Don "Were"
Allen, while Art Hansen has done
handsome sets for the show.
Tickets will be on sale at the the
ater before the show tonight and to
morrow night and in the A.S.S.U.
office from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. today.
Prices range from 35 cents to $1.10.
