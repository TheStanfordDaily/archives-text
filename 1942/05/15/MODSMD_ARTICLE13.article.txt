With the theme "The Engineer's Place in the War Effort," Tau Beta Pi,
national engineer's honor society, will sponsor Stanford's fifth annual
Engineer's Dinner next Wednesday, according to Tail Beta Pi President
Frank Tatum.
"The general purpose of the dinner," Tatum said, "is to bring the cngi-

newing school students and faculty
together, to acquaint Lower Division
men with the school and the profes
sional societies, and to form a link
between academic and practical
engineering work."
Supporting the dinner's theme,
there will be speakers from three
fields of the war effort. Represent
ing industry will be R. E. Donovan,
regional representative of the Na
tional Committee for the Conserva
tion of Manpower for War Indus
tries. Mr. Donovan will speak on the
importance of safety work in indus
try as a part of the war effort.
Lieut.-Comm. J. E. Brenner of the
procurement offices of the 12th Naval
District, will speak on the require
ments for commissions in the vari
ous Naval Reserve classifications
open to engineers, and the duties of
engineers in these classes.
Major E. J. Soares, associate pro
fessor of military science and tactics,
will discuss the requirements for
commissions in the fields of engi
neering work in the Army, and the
duties of Army engineers.
"To anyone interested in engineer
ing work in the Army, the Navy, or
in war industries, this dinner should
be not only interesting, but valu
able, Tatum said. "This dinner rep
resents a real opportunity for every
students to find out just what engi
neering at Stanford can offer him
and what part he, as an engineer,
could play in the war effort."

Dinner will be Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur, and Samuel B. Morris,
