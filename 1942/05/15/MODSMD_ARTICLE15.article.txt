# New 'Duration' Clothes Previewed At War Fair
## 
### 
A victory suit contrasted with a zoot suit, dresses made with synthetic
linen and rayon, and commentator Isabel Fawcett told Farm men and
women what the fashion trends for the duration of the war will be, yes
terday at the Women's Conference War Fair.
"Our silhouette lias been frozen, and the styles you see us wear today

you will see next year, with a
modifications," Miss Faweett said, |
as smooth campus queens strolled ]
across the stage of the Women's
Clubhouse modeling summer and
fall classics.
COSTUME CHANGES
Miss Faweett pointed out the
changes on each costume as the co
ed paused for the audience to ob
serve closely. All prints, hereafter,
will put on while background to
save material, dye, and time.
Dresses and suits have no collars
or cuffs, no hems, and no frills. Full-

ness in skirts is faked by tucks and
gathers, she commented.
As a consumer, each person should
learn to mend, to remove stains, to
watch for moths, and to do without
expensive materials, Miss Fawcett
stated as she told the part the indi
vidual may play in the govern
ment's effort to conserve clothes.
COTTON INEXPENSIVE
"Cotton is not only inexpensive,
but it's luxurious. Luxurious be
cause it can be laundered easily,
combined with other materials, and
inexpensive," the commentator add
ed about the material which will
[ be used predominantly.
To add to the success of the fair,
Farm i-oughs danced with Roble
ites of their choice at a taxi dance
and helped to black out the six-by
six picture of Hiler.
WAR STAMP
Admission to the show and con
! cessions was a 10-cent War Sav
j ings Stamp. All war stamps were
pasted in savings books and will be
given to the Dimes for Diplomas
Fund, according to Margaret Elliott,
general chairman.
There will be a clear profit for the
stamp fund as all living groups do
nated the money they had originally
budgeted for the county fair which
the War Fair replaced, Miss Elliott
stated.
"I think everyone had fun and
learned much about consumer edu
cation at the same time," Miss El
liott said.
