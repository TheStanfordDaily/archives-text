# Frosh Open House Dance Called Off
## 
### 
The Encina Dance and Open
House planned for tomorrow night
has been canceled, according to En
cina Council. Conflict of dates with
the Branner Dance, together with
seeming lack of interest in the af
fair, caused the cancellation, ac
cording to Fred Maguirc who was
to have been in charge of arrange
ments.
The Encinamen feel they should
concentrate their energies on mak
ing next Saturday's Encina Formal
a success, and not bother with stag
ing the get-together so close to the
freshmen's big dance of the year,
according to the Council.
