### H.D. THOREAU 
pjEFORE The Daily Handicapper went off to lab, he figured out the
following dope sheet on tomorrow's Fresno Relays.
Since even the team coaches don't know what relays they'll enter until
the night of the meet, our boy has plenty of excuses ready if things don't
pan out the way he expects them to.
With four places counting for points, here's the way he sees things:
100—Davis (Cal), Smith (SJS), Trout (USC), Jackson (FSC).
...120 h.h. —Hertel (Stan.), Kinzle (Ariz. STC), Biewner (USC), Futrell
(FSC).
410 relay—USC (Morris, Callanan, Browning, Trout), San Jose, Califor
nia, Stanford.
SSO relay—USC (Callanan, Trout, Browning. Bourland). California, San
Jose, UCLA.
Mile relay—USC (Kerns, Thomas, Wachtler, Bourland), California, San
Jose, Fresno.
2-mile relay—USC (Weed, LeGar, Lane, Smith), Fresno, San Jose,
California.
Medley relay (440. SSO, 1:520. mile)—USC (Crank, Smith, Lane, Weed),
Fresno, California, UCLA.
Discus—Merritt (USC), Thompson (USC), Jones (Ariz. STC), Nor
berg (Stan.).
Shot put—Merritt (USC), Stamm (Stan.). Thomas (USC), Minini (SJS).
Javelin—Biles (Cal). Pettigrew (USC), Jones (Ariz. STC), Pande (Stan.).
Iligh jump—Greene (USC), Tally (USC), Hart (Stan.), W. Smith
(Stan.).
Broad jump—B. Smith (SJS), Steele (SJS), Bleeker (USC). Kern
(Stan.).
Pole vault—G. Smith (Cal), Schaefer (USC), tie 3rd, Tomaso (Stan.),
Maggard (UCLA), Shields (FSC), Cooley (SJS), Groswird (Cal), Nichols
(Cal), MacConaghy (Cal).
Although no official score is kept, a system of 5-3-2-1 points for indi
vidual events and 10-6-4-2 for relays has been devised by the boys in the
press box. By this method our Daily Handicapper has come up with the
following team totals:
Southern California 85, California 34 2-7. San Jose 30 3-7, Stanford
16 3-7. Fresno 10 3-7. Arizona 7. U.C.L.A. 4 3-7.
As you may have noticed Dean Cromwell's Trojans will pretty well
dominate the meet.
