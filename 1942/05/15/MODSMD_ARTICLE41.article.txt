# Peck Hailed as Farm's Top All-around Athlete
## 
### HAP EVERETT 
Aide successor to Kai Larsen as the school's most all-around person is
Russ Peck, 1). U., Old Schoolhouse, or wherever he hangs his hat.
Remember Kai? He was everything from a brilliant middle distance
runner to a connoisseur of rare wines. Well, Peck is even more of a
dilettante. â™¦

To begin with. Peck constantly
flirts with the 14-foot mark in the
pole vault, broad jumps 23 feet, is
playing first string end on the var
sity football team in spring prac
tice, and is probably the fastest
pitcher in the intramural softball
league. He was once captain of the
Glendale J.C. golf team and shoots
in the high 70's on a good day yet.
NOVICE
Last fall, Russ battled his way to
the novice light-heavyweight crown. j
When he gets a little time off these
days, he likes tumbling and basket
ball.
In between athletic workouts,
Russ plays trumpet, kazoo, and gui
tar. In a pinch he can even study.
SPORTS REPORTER
Kai Larsen, by the way, is work
ing on the San Francisco News as
a sports reporter, where he is col
lecting background for a play.
"Alf" played a terrific game at for
ward for the San Francisco "Y" this
winter and when asked by Tom
Laird to pick an all-conference
team, the smiling Dane included j
three Stanford men in his selection. ;
