# Streamline It
## 
### 
THE committee now working on student gov
ernment reorganization is on the right track,
but may be going the wrong way.
The assumption that classes do not make a
valid basis for representation any more is cor
rect. Summer quarter attendance and other
emergency adjustments will cause many stu
dents to lose track of their class standing. Class
allegiance and division will not be much in
evidence while the emergency lasts.
But after doing away with this basis of rep
resentation, the reorganization committee has
perhaps lost its head a little bit. The plan as it
now stands is unwieldy, cumbersome, top
heavy.
An executive council of the size planned will
lead to haggling and unnecessary discussion.
What is needed in student body government at
this time is streamlining.
The division of the student body into Asso
ciated Men and Associated Women is a good
thing. There are enough problems common to
men here to necessitate the former. The latter
will not be at all useless.
But the actual council which is to replace Ex
Committee would prove more efficient if lim
ited to seven members at the most. The prob
lem of too many big shots plagued the na
tional administration's emergency government
last year. Washington had to learn the hard
way. Their present set-up is a streamlined,
trimmed version of the early OPM, etc.
The supreme council of Stanford's wartime
government should include only the student
body president and vice-president, the presi
dents of Associated Men and Associated Wom
en, and three members-at-large. This makes a
voting body of seven.
The non-voting members of the council
should include only the Student Manager, the
War Activities Co-ordinator, and the editor of
The Daily. This gives us a streamlined body
of ten persons.
We do not believe that the other proposed ex
officio seats deserve a place in this war cabi
net. A representative of speech and drama
would be out of proportion; he and the athletic
commissioner and R.O.T.C. head could be
called in to discuss problems pertinent to their
departments. There is no need for them to
clutter up the other discussions.
One of the members-at-large must be desig
nated as lower division. The situation at Cali
fornia shows that freshmen and sophomores do
not get nearly proportionate representation
when members-at-large make up the executive
committee of the government.
The committee's plan has a sound basis; but
it must remember the easiest way to efficiency
is intelligent streamlining.â€”Hap Everett
