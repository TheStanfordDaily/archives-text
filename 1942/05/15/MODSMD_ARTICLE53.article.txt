# Meeting a Crisis
## 
### 
IT is generally agreed that within a few weeks
the state will face perhaps the gravest crisis
in its history.
Our watersheds, parks, forests, and range
lands may be singled out for sabotage by fire.
It is doubtful if even the most vigilant protection
personnel will prevent the enemy from making
such attempts.
What does this mean to Stanford? It means,
as Dr. Wilbur has said, "more action, less talk."
A small group of persons interested in the
problem have put forth the idea of a Stanford
Emergency Conservation School. The proposed
school offers a fascinating program, but it is not
planned for the ordinary student.
In order to insure the success of the plan,
the organizers have restricted the enrollment
to 100 men, specially selected for earnestness
of purpose, potential leadership ability, willing
ness to work and run risks inherent in the very
nature of the work.
The move is something entirely new. To the
student who has not already committed himself
to some definite work it should offer quite an at
traction. Hap Everett
