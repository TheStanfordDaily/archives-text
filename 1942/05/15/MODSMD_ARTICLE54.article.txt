### AMIE REICHERT 
4NE of the janitors for the University wanted to bet
anyone five dollars that Hitler would be in Mos
cow by the Fourth of July. I took the bet. I think
it s one of the best investments I ever made.
I do not think this is false optimism. It had better
not be, or I will be five dollars poorer for it. Aside
from a question of whether or not Hitler could have
Moscow if he wanted it—which I think is doubtful—l
do not think he will waste any time monkeying
around in that region.
Hitler has two objectives in this campaign. The
first is to get to the oil of the Caucasus, the second to
drive down through the Middle East to effect a junc
ture somewhere with his Japanese allies. To do one
or both of these things he has to annihilate the Red
Army which is already leading him a merry chase.
When Hitler launched his drive against Russia
originally, back in June of last year, his objectives
were not quite the same. Primarily he wanted to con
quer the country, to defeat the Red Army, that is.
He thought the job would be a pushover. He launched
a full-scale drive on every front at once and advanced
steadily with all his fronts almost parallel for a time,
until the Russian defenses started functioning, and
threw his plans into complete confusion.
Last year Hitler wanted Leningrad and he wanted
Moscow and he wanted the Ukraine and he wanted
the Caucasus, ultimately, litis year he would still like
to have them all, but I do not think he will take any
chances. He needs the Caucasus desperately and in
stead of pressing along the entire front at once, the
chances are he will concentrate his greatest forces
in the South.
He will have to keep forces in the North to prevent
encirclement, to be sure. But the greatest battles will
be fought in the south of Russia this year. These will
be the significant battles of the Russian campaign, and,
in fact, of World War 11.
'JpHE opening stages of this offensive give evidence
which supports this theory. In the Kerch penin
sula and the Crimea the Germans have launched their
heavy forces against the outnumbered Russians, and
they appear to be forcing the defenders back, though
not without severe struggles.
But just a little to the north, in the Ukraine, the
Russians have struck a brilliant counterblow and have
crashed through the outer defenses of the great city of
Kharkov which was so dearly bought by the Nazis
last autumn.
Timoshenko, the greatest of all the Russian gen
erals, is leading this assault. The capture of Kharkov
will give the Russians a springboard for a drive 125
miles southwest to the Dnieper River bend, and might
enable them to swing south to the Sea of Azov where
they could cut the throat of the whole German Army
of the Crimea.

or not they are successful in completing
this entire operation, they will still be giving the
Nazis plenty of trouble. They have 2.000 miles of
frontier on which to attack. And each attack presents
the threat of encirclement from the rear to the Ger
mans in the South.
The Russians in this way can force the Germans to
scatter their troops along the frontier until they have
bolstered the defenses of the south.
It looks like that is what they are doing. Yester
day London and Stockholm reported that the Germans
in the Ukraine were in full retreat, that it looked like
a rout. The reports said that the Nazi troops were
fleeing the powerful Red Army advance, leaving be
hind their equipment.
Across the peninsula of Kerch are the stout de
fenses of the western Caucasus. It will take many
Nazi lives to storm them.
Hitler may find himself woefully short-handed be
fore this summer is out.

Across the peninsula of Kerch are the stout de
fenses of the western Caucasus. It will take many
Nazi lives to storm them.
Hitler may find himself woefully short-handed be
fore this summer is out.
4NE of the janitors for the University wanted to bet
anyone five dollars that Hitler would be in Mos
cow by the Fourth of July. I took the bet. I think
it s one of the best investments I ever made.
I do not think this is false optimism. It had better
not be, or I will be five dollars poorer for it. Aside
from a question of whether or not Hitler could have
Moscow if he wanted it—which I think is doubtful—l
do not think he will waste any time monkeying
around in that region.
Hitler has two objectives in this campaign. The
first is to get to the oil of the Caucasus, the second to
drive down through the Middle East to effect a junc
ture somewhere with his Japanese allies. To do one
or both of these things he has to annihilate the Red
Army which is already leading him a merry chase.
When Hitler launched his drive against Russia
originally, back in June of last year, his objectives
were not quite the same. Primarily he wanted to con
quer the country, to defeat the Red Army, that is.
He thought the job would be a pushover. He launched
a full-scale drive on every front at once and advanced
steadily with all his fronts almost parallel for a time,
until the Russian defenses started functioning, and
threw his plans into complete confusion.
Last year Hitler wanted Leningrad and he wanted
Moscow and he wanted the Ukraine and he wanted
the Caucasus, ultimately, litis year he would still like
to have them all, but I do not think he will take any
chances. He needs the Caucasus desperately and in
stead of pressing along the entire front at once, the
chances are he will concentrate his greatest forces
in the South.
He will have to keep forces in the North to prevent
encirclement, to be sure. But the greatest battles will
be fought in the south of Russia this year. These will
be the significant battles of the Russian campaign, and,
in fact, of World War 11.
'JpHE opening stages of this offensive give evidence
which supports this theory. In the Kerch penin
sula and the Crimea the Germans have launched their
heavy forces against the outnumbered Russians, and
they appear to be forcing the defenders back, though
not without severe struggles.
But just a little to the north, in the Ukraine, the
Russians have struck a brilliant counterblow and have
crashed through the outer defenses of the great city of
Kharkov which was so dearly bought by the Nazis
last autumn.
Timoshenko, the greatest of all the Russian gen
erals, is leading this assault. The capture of Kharkov
will give the Russians a springboard for a drive 125
miles southwest to the Dnieper River bend, and might
enable them to swing south to the Sea of Azov where
they could cut the throat of the whole German Army
of the Crimea.

or not they are successful in completing
this entire operation, they will still be giving the
Nazis plenty of trouble. They have 2.000 miles of
frontier on which to attack. And each attack presents
the threat of encirclement from the rear to the Ger
mans in the South.
The Russians in this way can force the Germans to
scatter their troops along the frontier until they have
bolstered the defenses of the south.
It looks like that is what they are doing. Yester
day London and Stockholm reported that the Germans
in the Ukraine were in full retreat, that it looked like
a rout. The reports said that the Nazi troops were
fleeing the powerful Red Army advance, leaving be
