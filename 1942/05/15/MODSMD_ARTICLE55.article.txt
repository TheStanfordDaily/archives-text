ON CAP ANI) GOWN
WE CAST A FROWN
|)OWN at Soquel last week-end a jolly group gath
ered for a party. About 20 girls, members of
Cap and Gown, "enjoyed swimming, bridge, and other
diversions." Believe me, there is nothing more fun
than diversions.
This is the sort of news the campus has been wait
ing for. A lot of hide-bound people have of late taken
the foolish attitude that there shouldn't be off-campus
parties, a ridiculous attitude at best. It is gratifying to
find that the leading women on campus are not cow
towing to this sort of thing.
If there were more women like the Cap and Gown
ers, we wouldn't have the present stupid squabble over
l:30-2:30's. These girls don't go around saying that it
is unhealthy to stay up till 2:30. they get healthy by
sleeping "out of doors under the stars," going to bed
when they choose.
In order to "see how the other half lives" and to
provide a Summer Quarter scholarship, all the gals of
Cap and Gown have to earn $15 on their own hook.
This I will have to admit is commendable.

JF YOU don't happen to have a house party to at
tend this week-end it is suggested that you drop in
and see the Spring Show either tonight or tomorrow.
Anyone who has heard of Los Angeles, the recall
committee, Beverly Hi and its cut-down hop-ups, is
bound to enjoy this show. Anyone who likes girls in
bathing suits is certain to enjoy this show.
Marcie Baum sings a fine song, "I Wanna Be a Hot
Goddess," in a way that leads you to believe that she
wouldn't have much trouble getting her wish.

A STORY going the rounds, which may or may not
be true, is very funny and concerns the Dean of
Men. According to the story, the Dean was to be a
patron at a dance last Saturday, the day one of our
men's groups chose to hold a rather unorthodox party
in their club rooms.
Arriving late to perform his duty, he apologized to
the social chairman, saying, the story has it, "I'm very
sorry that I'm late, but I've just been to a beer-bust."

JF YOU don't happen to have a house party to at

Anyone who has heard of Los Angeles, the recall

sleeping "out of doors under the stars," going to bed
when they choose.
