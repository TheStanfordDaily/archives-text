## SWALLOW QUESTION 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
The swallow question seems to me to be an ex
cellent example of democracy losing ground within a
democracy. It may seem a small matter, but it's a
highly significant one. Two petitions were circulated
among students, asking that the birds, since the sea
son is late and they are bravely continuing their ef
forts, be unmolested. For answers the University
j bluntly continues to wash them down.
One of the most futile angles of all is the fact
I that washing them down provides the birds with
i new mud for building each day, thus encouraging them
to build. One pair has built no less than eleven nests,
and will try again. I doubt if humans would have
that much courage against such ndds. If a plea by
the students has no results, just where are we? Is
the University there for the students or vice versa?
