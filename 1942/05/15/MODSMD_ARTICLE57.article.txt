# 'Tahiti' Film Plot Saved By Laughton
## 
### 
"The TUTTLES OF TAHITI,"
now playing at the Stanford Theater.
When Charles Laughton saves a
picture, he does a top-notch job.
Laughton saved "The Tuttles of
Tahiti, and he made it a thorough
ly enjoyable movie despite a dismal
plot hnd clumsy supporting cast.
R.K.O. didn't give Laughton much
to work with — just an island, an
archaic Ford truck, a couple hun
dred natives, glamorboy Jon Hall,
and a buxom adolescent named
Peggy Drake. But the studio kept
Dorothy Lamour out of the cast, and
they didn't hamper Laughton's man
nerisms—and that makes it a good
show.
Laughton is at his best. The old
rogue patters in and out of debt with
carefree abandon, while his over
sized family alternately starves and
throws all-night parties.
But Laughton's "Tuttles of Ta
hiti" is worth the bad parts of the
bill. It's a good picture to see for
relaxation and a sizeable portion of
genuine Laughton humor.—Allen
