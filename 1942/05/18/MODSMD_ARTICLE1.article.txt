# Co-op Rents Vacated Jap Club House
## Pacific Evacuation Korces Abandonment Of Student Building 
### 
Evacuation of Japanese students
from coast areas gave an impetus
to the co-operative living move
ment on the Stanford campus, last
night, as otTicials of the Walter
Thompson Co - operative House
signed a lease for the former Japa
nese Students' House, effective
summer quarter and lasted "until the
Japanese students wish its return."
Co-op Manager Willard Mitchell
stated, "By snaking the change, we
will be able to offer improved ac
commodations for a larger number
of students at the same inexpensive
rates." Room for 20 students will
be provided in the new quarters.
Meanwhile Japanese students are
continuing studies at Stanford,
awaiting call by the government.
Most of the students hope that they
will be allowed to continue studies
at mid western universities, although,
as one stated, "it will be much hard
er, as our parents won't be in a posi
tion to help us now."
