extra effort, but it is vitally im
portant to get this metal back into

"The Phi Psis and Delta Chis j
cleaned out their basements recently
and found a lot of good salvage.
Other fraternities and sororities,
particularly, could help the drive
out a great deal by cleaning out their
basement or attic this week-end," he
added.
Fifty pounds of tin cans from each j
fraternity and sorority will yield i
enough steel to build a jeep, or aid in j
the building of a destroyer, accord- |
ing to Bill Hutchinson, collection j
chairman, who urges drive reprc- j
sentatives in all living groups to be- j
gin collecting their tin now.

"Tin cans should be broftcn at
both ends, smashed Hat, and, if pos
sible, washed and the labels re
moved," states Ed Porter, salvage
chairman. "This may seem to be
extra effort, but it is vitally im
portant to get this metal back into
production."
Porter also suggests a spring
house-cleaning, or "Clean Out Your
Basement" Day this week-end, so
that (be quantities of old rags, metal,
and other salvageable materials hid
den away in basements may gel
back into production.

"The Phi Psis and Delta Chis j
cleaned out their basements recently
and found a lot of good salvage.
Other fraternities and sororities,
particularly, could help the drive
out a great deal by cleaning out their
basement or attic this week-end," he
added.
Fifty pounds of tin cans from each j
fraternity and sorority will yield i
enough steel to build a jeep, or aid in j
the building of a destroyer, accord- |
