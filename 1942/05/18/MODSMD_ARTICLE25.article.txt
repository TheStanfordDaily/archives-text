# Germany, Torn and Exhausted, Prepares for Do-or-Die Effort
## Nazis Must Win This Year or They Are Doomed—And They Know It 
### JOSEPH W. GRIGG

I.ISBON, May 17 (UP).—Nazi leaders from Ilitler down are convinced
thai this summer will bring the great military crisis of the war and to
merl it they have massed 210 of Germany's .'{oo army divisions for an
attempt to crush Russia, and have sent from ISO lo 300 submarines out to
slush at Allied shipping on the Atlantic.
'I'lie most competent observers with whom I had contact before leav-

in", Berlin a low days ago agreed,
that ;i showdown is near and that
the tide of war will definitely turn
against Germany unless the all-out
campaigns of the next few months
succeed.
German manpower already is
strained beyond the danger point,
with 12.000,000 men absorbed in the
fk'hting services—7,6oo,ooo in the
army, 1,500,000 in the air force and
navy, and 3,000,000 in auxiliary serv
ices, including the labor corps.
St ITERS HIGH CASUALTIES
Though it is impossible to estimate
exact numbers, Germany has suf
fered extremely high casualties.
There were between 12,000 and 20,-
( U0 casualties daily at the height of
the battles in Russia, reliable sources
have admitted, and the total killed
up to mid-winter was anything be
tween 250,000 and 750,000.
There is no shortage of guns or
munitions, but German warplane
production is believed to be slip
j ing. Estimates of the monthly out
put vary from 1,100 to 2,500 planes.
The air force probably has 35,000
planes, but many of them no longer
; re a match for the newest types
developed by the Allies.
Hitler knows he must achieve a
knockout blow against Russia be
lore the growing military might and
industrial power of the United
States is cast fully into the scales.
To thwart or delay that menace, he
will throw all available submarines
into the battle of the Atlantic this
summer in an effort to cripple
American aid for Russia and Britain.
END OF ROPE NEAR
Competent foreign military ob
servers in Berlin believe that if
Russia can withstand this sum
mer's fearful onslaught and retain
enough strength to hit back, the
Germans will reach the end of their
rope.
The German general staff admits
that if the German army cannot
grab the Caucasus and seize control
of the Mediterranean to bring oil
and Ukrainian wheat to hungry
Europe, a long-drawn-out war can
not be fought.
Of Germany's estimated 300 army
divisions, only 21.0 can be spared for
the Russian offensive. There are
about 20 in France, part of them
second-line and over-age regiments,
live in Norway, 12 in Belgium and :
Holland, two in Denmark and three
in Jugoslavia.
