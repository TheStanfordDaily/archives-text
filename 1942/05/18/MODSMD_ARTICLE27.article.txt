LISBON, May 17 (UP). —Hitler's firing squads have killed nearly
400,000 Europeans in the process of looting conquered areas of 30 billions
in cash and goods—equal to the whole cost of Germany's seven years of
rearmament, European official and private sources estimate.
Under the Nazi hostage system, 175,000,000 more persons in the occupied

countries are subject to death tor
anti-German deeds with which they
need not necessarily have the slight
est connection.
The wholesale use of firing squads
alone proves that Hitler's dreamed
of "New Order" for Europe is not
quite functioning as he desired.
PEOPLE NOT CO-OPERATIVE
If Occupied France, through which
we passed on the way to Lisbon last
week, may be taken as typical, the
occupying troops are meeting with
a sudden, non-cooperative attitude.
"Be my brother, or I'll smash your
head!" is the Nazi approach in forc
ing collaboration, and there has had
to be a lot of head-smashing.
Exclusive of Russia, it is esti
mated that 97,600 persons have been
executed—B7,soo in Poland, 5,000 in
Jugoslavia, 3.000 in Czechoslovakia,
1,500 in France and Belgium, 300 in
Holland, 150 in Norway, and 150 in
Greece.
POLES SLAUGHTERED
Eighty thousand were slaughtered
in Poland after the fall of Warsaw in
reprisal for the alleged murder of
56,000 minority Germans by the
Poles.
In Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania,
the killing of Jews amounted to an
open hunt, reliable sources have es
tablished. Upward of 100,000 met
death in these Baltic States alone,
and more than double that many
have been executed in western
Russia.
Appropriation of Jewish prop
erty, carried out systematically by
the Gestapo, has contributed a large
part of the $36,000,000,000 of German
plunder in the occupied countries,
but the exact amount may never be
known.
NAZI SQUEEZE PLAY
The gigantic continent - wide
squeeze is plunging living-standards
down to the level of bare existence.
The Germans are determined that
their country shall be the last to
feel starvation.
France is the fattest prize. The
Bank of France reported recently
that the German occupation cost
France 139,000,000,000 francs in 1941
—the equivalent of $3,160,000,000 or
$79 per capita. The average Paris
factory worker gets $37 a month.
The Germans spend only two
thirds of what they receive from the
French on the actual costs of occu
pation. With the remainder they are
buying into French economy. A
similar policy is being applied in all
the occupied countries.
GERMANS MUSCLE IN
The Vichy government admitted
last year that German interests held
49 per cent of the stocks of principal
French industries, banks and busi
nesses, excluding, of course, those
which had not been taken over en
tirely or smashed.
Hundreds of French factories are
operating at top speed to produce
for the German war machine, no
tably Renault, Citroen, Potez, Mat
ford, Hispano-Suiza and Schneider.
The French meat ration is 180
jjrams—about the size of two large
hamburgers—weekly. In Norway,
the meat ration is only 100 grams for
a whole month.

LISBON, May 17 (UP). —Hitler's firing squads have killed nearly
400,000 Europeans in the process of looting conquered areas of 30 billions
in cash and goods—equal to the whole cost of Germany's seven years of
rearmament, European official and private sources estimate.
Under the Nazi hostage system, 175,000,000 more persons in the occupied

countries are subject to death tor
anti-German deeds with which they
need not necessarily have the slight
est connection.
The wholesale use of firing squads
alone proves that Hitler's dreamed
of "New Order" for Europe is not
quite functioning as he desired.
PEOPLE NOT CO-OPERATIVE
If Occupied France, through which
we passed on the way to Lisbon last
week, may be taken as typical, the
occupying troops are meeting with
a sudden, non-cooperative attitude.
"Be my brother, or I'll smash your
head!" is the Nazi approach in forc
ing collaboration, and there has had
to be a lot of head-smashing.
Exclusive of Russia, it is esti
mated that 97,600 persons have been
executed—B7,soo in Poland, 5,000 in
Jugoslavia, 3.000 in Czechoslovakia,
1,500 in France and Belgium, 300 in
Holland, 150 in Norway, and 150 in
Greece.
POLES SLAUGHTERED
Eighty thousand were slaughtered
in Poland after the fall of Warsaw in
reprisal for the alleged murder of
56,000 minority Germans by the
Poles.
In Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania,
the killing of Jews amounted to an
open hunt, reliable sources have es
tablished. Upward of 100,000 met
death in these Baltic States alone,
and more than double that many
have been executed in western
Russia.
Appropriation of Jewish prop
erty, carried out systematically by
the Gestapo, has contributed a large
part of the $36,000,000,000 of German
plunder in the occupied countries,
but the exact amount may never be
known.
NAZI SQUEEZE PLAY
The gigantic continent - wide
squeeze is plunging living-standards
down to the level of bare existence.
The Germans are determined that
their country shall be the last to
feel starvation.
France is the fattest prize. The
Bank of France reported recently
that the German occupation cost
France 139,000,000,000 francs in 1941
—the equivalent of $3,160,000,000 or
$79 per capita. The average Paris
factory worker gets $37 a month.
The Germans spend only two
thirds of what they receive from the
French on the actual costs of occu
pation. With the remainder they are
buying into French economy. A
similar policy is being applied in all
the occupied countries.

NAZI SQUEEZE PLAY
The gigantic continent - wide
squeeze is plunging living-standards
down to the level of bare existence.
The Germans are determined that
their country shall be the last to
feel starvation.
France is the fattest prize. The
Bank of France reported recently
that the German occupation cost
France 139,000,000,000 francs in 1941
—the equivalent of $3,160,000,000 or
$79 per capita. The average Paris
factory worker gets $37 a month.
The Germans spend only two
thirds of what they receive from the
French on the actual costs of occu
pation. With the remainder they are
buying into French economy. A
similar policy is being applied in all
the occupied countries.
GERMANS MUSCLE IN
The Vichy government admitted
last year that German interests held
49 per cent of the stocks of principal
French industries, banks and busi
nesses, excluding, of course, those
which had not been taken over en
tirely or smashed.
Hundreds of French factories are
operating at top speed to produce
for the German war machine, no
tably Renault, Citroen, Potez, Mat
ford, Hispano-Suiza and Schneider.
The French meat ration is 180
jjrams—about the size of two large
hamburgers—weekly. In Norway,
the meat ration is only 100 grams for
a whole month.
