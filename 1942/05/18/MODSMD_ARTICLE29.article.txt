# Shortages of Raw Materials Hamper Italy

### REYNOLDS PACKARD 
United Press Staff Correspondent
LISBON, May 17 (UP). —Lack
of oil—with supplies believed cut to
15 per cent of the pre-war volume—
is keeping Italy's warships tied up
and greatly handicapping her role as
a major workshop for the German
war machine.
Germany has sent hundreds of ex
perts into Italy to speed up industry
and make it more efficient, but
shortages of many essential materi
als besides oil, including coal, mag
nesium, copper, tin, wool and cotton,
are crippling their efforts.
Scores of German industrial ex
perts passed through Siena, where I
. was interned, on their way to fac
tories to dovetail Axis war produc
! tion. Neutral observers have com
. rnented. however, that Italian indus
try is less in need of German tech
j nical skill than in need of raw ma
terials.
COPPER, TIN SHORTAGES
There are acute copper and tin
| shortages.
Italy has considerable deposits of
! bauxite, from which aluminum is
j extracted, but completely lacks
| magnesium, which is indispensable
I for combining with aluminum to
j make duralumin for airplanes,
j The fundamental cornerstone of
German economic support of Italy is
| the German agreement to ship 1,-
000,000 tons of coal monthly. With
| out it, Italian factories could not
function.
GERMANS SUPPLY COAL
Experts assured me before I was
interned that these shipments were
' maintained until the end of De
j cember. Since then I have been un
! able to check on them, but report
edly they have fallen off.
According to reliable quarters,
j Germany is endeavoring to give
j Italy as much iron and steel as she
I used to import from England,
France, and the United States: Scrap
iron imports, however, have dimin
ished almost to zero.

LISBON, May 17 (UP). —Lack
of oil—with supplies believed cut to
15 per cent of the pre-war volume—
is keeping Italy's warships tied up
and greatly handicapping her role as
a major workshop for the German
war machine.
Germany has sent hundreds of ex
perts into Italy to speed up industry
and make it more efficient, but
shortages of many essential materi
als besides oil, including coal, mag
nesium, copper, tin, wool and cotton,
are crippling their efforts.
Scores of German industrial ex
perts passed through Siena, where I
. was interned, on their way to fac
tories to dovetail Axis war produc
! tion. Neutral observers have com
. rnented. however, that Italian indus
try is less in need of German tech
j nical skill than in need of raw ma
terials.
COPPER, TIN SHORTAGES
There are acute copper and tin
| shortages.
Italy has considerable deposits of
! bauxite, from which aluminum is
j extracted, but completely lacks
| magnesium, which is indispensable
I for combining with aluminum to
j make duralumin for airplanes,
j The fundamental cornerstone of
German economic support of Italy is
| the German agreement to ship 1,-
000,000 tons of coal monthly. With
| out it, Italian factories could not
function.
GERMANS SUPPLY COAL
Experts assured me before I was
interned that these shipments were
' maintained until the end of De
j cember. Since then I have been un
! able to check on them, but report
edly they have fallen off.
According to reliable quarters,
j Germany is endeavoring to give
j Italy as much iron and steel as she

iron imports, however, have dimin
ished almost to zero.
