### 

THIS NIGHT PICTURE made "somewhere in the San Francisco Bay Area" gives you an idea of the way
a lighted city would form a brilliant backdrop to silhouette American ships along the Pacific coastlineâ€”
thus the order for a coastwise "dim-out" of all lights visible at sea to prevent possibility of enemy sub
marines spotting U.S. shipping.
