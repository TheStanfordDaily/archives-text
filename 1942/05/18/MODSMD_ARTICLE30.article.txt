LISBON, May 17 (UP). —Germany, as (irmly in Adolf Hitler's grip as
ever, still is intensifying her war efforts, hut ever stronger propaganda
hypodermics are needed as life daily grows grimmer and more miserable.
Ihe winter on the Russian front was disastrous, as the overflow of
wounded soldiers from all available hospitals and hotels into private homes
bears witness. Deterioration of economic conditions is visible on all

♦•sides. Nerves have been strained by
I the heavy British bombing of Ger
man towns.
Yet the capacity of the average
German citizen to endure hardship
and sacrifice definitely has not yet
| reached the breaking point.
READY TO TAKE OVER
Organization of an effective anti-
Nazi movement still is impossible,
but I have good evidence that there
is a powerful group, reaching very
high up in some quarters, ready to
take over the rule of Germany "if
anything should happen to Hitler."
Though the average German may
hate the war and would rather have
peace today than tomorrow, it must
be remembered and emphasized that
the price which the war has de
manded thus far in German lives
has made continuation of the war
imperative if the sacrifice is not to
be in vain.
Reserve supplies of food and basic
raw materials do not yet show signs
of decisive weakness, but in their
plans for an all-out offensive in
i Russia this summer the Nazis reveal
i that they are racing against worsen -
j ing economic conditions.
iDEATH FOR SABOTEURS
In the almost frantic step-up of
j the industrial tempo in preparation
i for the Russian shutdown, the Ger
! mans have made observers suspect
; that sabotage and general slackness
I in factories and mills are on the in
j crease, for they have found it neces-
I sary to threaten death as punishment
for them.
The death penalty has been de
! creed even for armament manu
i facturers falsely reporting labor and
raw material reserves or needs.
The continued wretched state of
the German transportation system
has led to cutting down the use of
railroads to absolutely indispensable
war needs. Vacation travel is vir
tually eliminated.
STUNNED BY AIR RAIDS
The German public has been
shocked and stunned by the fe
rocity of the British air attacks this
, spring, especially at Rostock and
Lubeek, word of which has spread
far beyond these Baltic ports.
Nor has the high cost of the winter
fighting in Russia been successfully
concealed from the people. Numer
ous notices of soldiers' deaths have
appeared in the newspapers, some
of them of youngsters only 17 years
old.
All hotels which could be freed
from normal civilian use have been
1 converted into hospitals and con
valescent homes for soldiers, but
| toward the end of the winter they
• j were so overcrowded that wounded
; men were sent into private homes.

To avoid danger of contracting any
of the 70 dire diseases, a Moham
medan rule of life requires each of
the faithful to begin each meal with
salt.
