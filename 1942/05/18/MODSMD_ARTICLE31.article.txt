## 
### 
According to Dale Hosman, head
; of the Dimes for Diplomas program,
j the dime collection last Thursday
i again fell short of its $290 goal to
I send two students through one
quarter of schooling after the war.
The amount collected nevertheless
exceeded the record of the preced
ing week, the Kappas subscribing
100 per cent and a majority of the
Alpha Delts contributing.
A number of the fraternities and
living groups neglected to put out
the collection boxes during the noon
hour.
The money donated will be turned
in for government bonds, thus ac
complishing the two-fold purposes
of aiding war production and insur
ing society after the war.
