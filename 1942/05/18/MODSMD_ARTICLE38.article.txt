The Chicago White Sox, who lost
18 out of their first 22 games,
stretched their winning streak to
six in a row Sunday—longest cur
rent unbeaten string in the majors—
by defeating the Washington Sena
tors twice, 7-1 and 4-3.
A pair of sterling pitching per
formances by veteran Ted Lyons
and Johnny Rigney accounted for
the White Sox double win. Lyons
held the Senators to six hits for his
second victory while Rigney rolled
up a three-hitter in the nightcap for
his third victory of the year.
