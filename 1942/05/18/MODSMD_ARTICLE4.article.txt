# Dr. Danforth Is Selected For Academy
## 
### 
Dr. Charles H. Danforth, head of
Stanford's anatomy department, is
one of 15 persons recently elected to
membership in the National Acad
emy of Sciences, one of the highest
honors which can be conferred upon
a scientist.
The Stanford anatomist was the
only scientist chosen in this section

of anatomy and zoology, and was
the only person selected west of the
Mississippi.
Only 15 members are chosen for
membership in the Academy each
year. Among those selected for the
honor this year was Albert Einstein,
noted mathematician, who was pre
viously a foreign associate of the
Academy.
A three-quarter vote of the entire
Academy is necessary for member
ship and the basis for selection is the
person's record of scientific activities
and his principal contributions to
science.
