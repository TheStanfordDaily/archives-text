of the best prospects to fill the position of Queen of the Nation's
Tennis Courts in the years to come is Louise Brough, 19-year-old
U.S.C. Theta. Louise, national junior women's titlist at present, recently
won the Southern California women's championship in impressive fashion.
Incidentally, winner of the men's tourney over Frankie Parker, second
ranking amateur in the country, was Jack Kramer, national doubles cham
pion with our boy Ted Schroeder.
Although Schroeder is seeded first in the state tourney, which is now
in progress at Berkeley, Kramer should beat the Farm flash, since his
game is better suited for the hard-fast Berkeley courts.

who did 6 feet 4 inches, a very creditable mark.
However, there are four guys on the varsity team down there who
can beat that so Boh spends his time on the conference championship
baseball team. They have at least a dozen men down there who can
get under a 10-flat 100-yard dash.
They've won the college championship for the last seven years in
