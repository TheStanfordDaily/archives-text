# Sacramento, Oaks Split Doubleheader
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO. May 17 (UP). -
An 11th inning rally gave Oakland a
7-6 win over Sacramento today in
the nightcap of their doubleheader
after the Solons won a narrow 5-4
decision in the opener.
Vince Dibiasi, Oakland relief
hurler, won his own game in the
overtime contest when his outfield J
fly sent Bill Rignoy in with the win- !
ning run. Rigney had tied up the I
game in the seventh when he sin- j
gled and scored on Bill Raimondi's !
double.
Records show that drivers who j
have to stop to think are too slow j
to think to stop.
