# Hertel's 14.3 Hurdle Mark Rivals Davis for Highlight
## 
### 
To Harold Davis and the world at large the highlight of Saturday's
Fresno Relays was Davis' record-equalling 9.4-seconds 100-yard dash, but
to Ed Hertel and Stanford, the excellent race llertel ran in winning the
120 high hurdles in 14.3 was the meet's climax.
Hertel scon left his main competition, Trojan John Beiwener, in the

rear, and went on to win by three 4
yards in his best race to date. He
might have been able to lower the
14.3, which is the best mark made
in th country this year, even lower
had he been pressed.
Despite the Indian hurdlers' first
and the first place taken by Willard
Smith, Card soph, in the high jump.
Stanford's point total could only get
them fourth behind U.S.C., Califor
nia, and San Jose.
This is the way the Farm athletes
scored their 17 counters:
Ed Stamm, third place in the shot
at 49 feet behind two Trojans, Carl
Merritt and Ronnie Thomas. i
440 relay team, third place behind
Bears and Trojans. Winning time |
40.8 seconds.
Gene Kern, fourth place in the j
broad jump at 23 feet 4 inches. Wil- j
lie Steele of San Jose won at 24-5.
Russ Peck, tie for third in the pole
vault at 13 feet. Trojan Willard
Schaeler won at 14 feet 6 inches.
Cornelius Warmerdam, in an exhi
bition, cleared 15-1, but failed in his
tries for higher heights.
Smiths tie for first in the high !
jump with Trojan Gil Greene. Both
cleared 6 feet 4 inches.
Hertel's high hurdle win.
