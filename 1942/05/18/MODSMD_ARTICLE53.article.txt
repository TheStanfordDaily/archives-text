# Bear Oarsmen to Unload Two Shells for Saturday's Racing
## 
### RILL HORNBY 
Ky Ebright and an assorted collection of University of California crew
men will play Santa Clans Saturday for Bud Clary and his "on our own"
Stanford crew on the Redwood City Yacht Harbor Course.
First among the gifts borne by the Bear oarsmen, and probably the
most important as far as Coach Carl Peterson of the Farm is concerned,

will be a parcel of big time compe
tition. Thus far some 20 Stanford
ites, who are devoting their efforts
towards reviving the shell sport
here, have raced among themselves,
lacking equipment and conditioning
to enter organized college racing.
Secondly, the Bears bring two new
racing shells. The first is a gift made
to Stanford by A1 Ulbrickson's
Washington Huskies last fall. The
Cal crew brought the shell as far as
their Berkeley boathouse on the pre
vious trip. There it has languished
because the locals couldn't get the
transportation between the bay
school and Redwood City.
The Bears will bring the shell plus
another donated by Cal itself. The
new equipment will give the locals a
chance to develop at least a three
crew armada.
