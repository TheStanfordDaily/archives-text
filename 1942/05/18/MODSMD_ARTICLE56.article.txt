# From the Enemy

### 
THE thousands of words in sermons, speeches,
and editorials telling us what we are fighting
for in this war are perhaps less convincing than
the thousands of words issued by the enemy.
The last war made us a little wary of ideals to
be fought "for," but now there is no doubt after
reading the works of the totalitarian writers.
Mein Kampf is perhaps the prime example. And
the Nazis' newest anti-Christian book, God and
Nation, is equally convincing. . .
The following are a few quotations from the
latter book:
"We cannot live two different faiths. In our
heart there is only room for one faith, one creed:
Germany. . . .
The age of international humanitarian
dreams is moving towards its close and with it
the dream of Christian humanity which has
been agitating men for 2,000 years without
bringing anyone one step nearer it. . . .
Now there is the Reich. Germany has cre
ated herself. One leader guides. One will com
mands. One nation springs forward. But we
still have one battle to win, the battle for the
German man, for the German soul. This battle
will be the most difficult, but the most fruitful
and most beautiful of all.
"Where there is a battle there are fronts.
These fronts are evident. One is called Christ,
the other Germany. No third one exists. Like
wise there is no compromise, but a single, clear
decision."
The book continues in the vein of an anti-
Christian manifesto issued last fall by the Ideol
ogy office of Dr. Alfred Rosenberg, outlining
plans for a new national Reich Church in which
Mein Kampt would replace the Bible and the
sword replace the cross.
The quotes from God and Nation tell the
story. Surely no editorial comment is needed.—
