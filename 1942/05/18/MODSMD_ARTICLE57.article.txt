# No Need for This . . .

(From the University of Oregon Daily Emerald,
May 5, 1942)
SO far this war has been fought, in America
at least, with a minimum of the witch-burn
ing and hate-hysteria which typified the "hang
the Kaiser" sentiments of 1917. But in Eugene,
the other day, there was unwelcome evidence
that something of this nature is coming to the
fore.
In letters to President Roosevelt and to Gen
eral John L. DeWitt, members of Military Moth
ers' Service Club cited the residence of a few
Japanese students on the University of Oregon
campus as "serious threats" to the safety of
this area and asked that they be removed.
The statement obviously was made without
studying the actual conditions on the campus.
For each of these Japanese students—all oi them
with high scholastic records—is living in a rec
ognized campus living organization, obeying
regular curfew laws imposed by the military
officials, and is under close supervision at all
times by University officials. There is no place
in Oregon where there is less chance of an
alien doing actual damage to defense than a
college campus where regulation of all students
is the accepted thing.

Students on the campus feel no rancor toward
their Japanese classmates. They know each of
them well, know their outstanding records on
the campus, and until these students indicate
in some manner tendencies other than pro-
American, they feel no sense of being "threat
ened" by their existence on the campus.
When and if military authorities find it expe
dient to ask Japanese students to leave the
campus, then it can be done quietly and easily.
