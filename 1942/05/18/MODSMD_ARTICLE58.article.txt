### AMIE REICHERT 
r day after Earl Browdcr went to prison 14
months ago liberals all over the country began
working for his release, but Adolf Hitler actually
sprung him. They probably would have let Browder
stay put in Atlanta for the rest of his four-year sen
tence if Herr Hitler hadn't had the good grace to
attack Russia, and Comrade Stalin hadn't had the
good grace to fight back. The New Republic and the
rest of the liberal publications in the country which
have been pleading Browder's case all this time would
have been simply wasting their breath because Martin
Dies or somebody else would have seen to it that
Browder finished his stretchâ€”with no time off for good
behavior.
They got Browder the way they got A1 Caponc.
They knew Capone was a thug and a gangster and a
racketeer but they couldn't prove it, so they finally
had to send him up for the lily-livered offense of
income tax evasion. With Browder, they knew he was
a Communist, and though Martin Dies and William
Randolph Hearst think that is enough of a crime to
string any man up for, the men who wrote the Bill
of Rights and the men who defend it today couldn't
quite see it that way. So they got Browder on a
fhor"e of falsifying a passport and they gave him the
inordinately harsh term of four years in Atlanta and
of course everyone knew that it would have been two
years or six months or something like that if it had
been anyone but Earl Browder.
While the President's commutation of Browders
sentence is a good thing and a just thing per se, it is
doubtful whether Mr. Roosevelt was being wholly al
truistic. The President had his eyes toward the Krem
lin when he ordered that commutation. It is one of the
best moves he has made in the game of international
politics.
For although Russia is militarily our ally, she is
not so much with us (and especially with Britain)
as she is against Fascism. I do not think the charge
that Russia is "not to be trusted" has ever been a
completely fair statement. People who say that for
get for a moment that in all the years before Munich
when Russia was willing at a moment's notice to go
to war against the Nazis, it was Britain and France
who were not to be tx-usted. Through the years of
the Spanish Civil War, when Russia was aiding the
Loyalist defenders against Franco and his Fascist
friends, it was the U.S. who could not be trusted.
The democracies say they cannot be sure of Russia
because they know that they have ill-used her. That
is why they say she cannot be trusted.

'T'HE U.S. has done much within the past year to
patch up relations. Principally, we have put Rus
sia on top for Lend-Lease commitments. The reports
of the last few days from the Crimea tell of U.S. tanks
in battle against the Nazis. So we know the stories
of Harriman and Hopkins have not been fairy tales.
The President knows that Russia is the bulwark of
resistance today against the Nazis. We are indebted to
her and, in fact, dependent upon her for victory. When
the time for the Allied offensive against Japan comes,
we shall be even more dependent upon Russia's dis
position. The President said he freed Browder "to
promote national unity." He knows too that it will pro
mote international unity.
