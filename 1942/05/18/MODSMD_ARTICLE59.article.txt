YOU TOO CAN BE
A FIFTH COLUMNIST
IJOW would you like to be a fifth columnist? We
guarantee that if you follow the directions given
below, you will also qualify for the degree of un-
American, anti-democratic, fascist, and personal friend
of Citizen Kane.
You may be sure that such a course of action will
in no way jeopardize your status as a '"good" citizen.
You will lose no friends. You may even find that after
a little practice people will consider you fascinatingly
interesting, or screamingly funny.
You can go on being the perfect Stanford student,
for the Farm is one of the places most suited for your
early training.
Your first duty is to be able to scoff at any and
everything. There is nothing more characteristic of
a good fifth columnist than a good hearty scoff. Prac
tice it once, right now. Ha ha ha ha. See how easy
it is?
Once you have learned the fundamentals, start in
troducing inflections into your scoffs. The first one
is the "sheer ridiculous" one. This is used to laugh
down things as not even worthy of argument.
A place where you can use this is when asked to
forego big name bands and off-campus functions. It
can also be used for Carless Wednesdays very ef
fectively. Choose the situation well and then scoff
loud and long at it and you will be well on the way
to being an effective fifth columnist.
Another scoff is the cynical scoff. This is done with
a sort of aloof sneer. The implication must be got
across that the person or thing being scoffed is in
ferior, simple, childish, and even stupid to those of
intellect.
This can be used effectively when dealing with tire
conservation. Laugh derisively and in an offhand way
sneer, "they're mine and I'd like to see anybody tell
me what to do with them." The same goes for being
asked to save toothpaste tubes, old newspapers, and
the other items of salvage.

CTILL another useful scoff is the "love thine enemy,
k but hate your friend" scoff. This must be thrown
into the conversation when the United Nations are
being discussed or when the activities of Allied forces
are mentioned. Always snort "wishful thinking" or
"sheer propaganda' when Allied successes are men
tioned, but be sure to snarl "military genius" or "un
conquerable might" when Axis moves succeed.
A scoff that should be used with care is that "the
New Deal got us into this and now let's see them get
us out" scoff. There is not much sympathy towards
this one anymore, particularly away from the campus,
so use it cautiously.
There is plenty of room for originality in being a
fifth columnist. The more you personalize your efforts
the better they will be.
To prepare yourself to go out in the world as a
competent fifth columnist, go to work on the local
campus war activities committees. See if you can im
pede their work, undermine their efforts, and set them
up to ridicule. This sort of thing will be invaluable
for the work you will want to do in your own com
munity back home.
There is no reason for hysteria in handling evac
uation, because most of the Japanese are loyal
American citizens and the movement of these
Japanese inland is designed merely as a safety
measure in case there are some few fifth col
umnists in their midst.
America is built on the principles of life, lib
erty, and the pursuit of happiness. Even in
wartime, when these liberties must be con
trolled for the national safety, there is no need
for witch-hunting.
