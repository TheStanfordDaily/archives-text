# Spring Show Is Successful; Improves On Final Night
## 
### 
Since the Spring Show didn't exactly manage to come off with a liaug
until Saturday night, and this reviewer saw it Friday, it is only fair to
comment on the show's intrinsic worth—of which it had plenty. We'll
forget the technical hitches of the Friday performance.
Certainly, as far as performances, plot, and general comedy went, it

was the best show the Class of '42 1
can remember. And all by itself it
was good, too.
It's difficult to choose among the
various comedy leads; however,
there's no question but that Bob
Breckner is the best singing leading
man, the school has seen in some
time. Dori Redmon likewise has a
fine stage presence, but she seems to
be i ,si;ade better singing hot than
sweet.
FOl'l? ITNNY MEN
John Boucher came through, and
since he is new among campus
comics, he is mentioned first, al
though I thought John High's Kane
was superb as was Bob O'Neill's
Biddle and Bill Graham's Pshaw.
The Los Angeles satire made the
plot—but perhaps it might not have
been so funny if the audience hadn't
known the built-over beet field to
the south quite thoroughly. They
did, so this is quibbling.
HOORAY FOR BIDDLE'
In the song class, "Hooray for
Biddle," "My G0,000,000 Readers
Want to Know," and "First Day of
Spring" were outstanding.
Taken all together the Spring
Show has been finally proved a
worth while undertaking, but may it
be suggested that two pianos would
do every bit as well, and very prob
ably better than an orchestra under
the present set-up.—Jean Nowell
