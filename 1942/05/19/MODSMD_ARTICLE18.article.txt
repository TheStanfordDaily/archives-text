WITH A.E.F. IN NORTHERN IRELAND, Tuesday, May 1!) (UP). —
Thousands upon thousands of United States troops, equipped with tanks,
heavy guns and other invasion materiel, have landed in northern Ireland
from the largest convoy of the war, which crossed the Atlantic without
the loss of a ship despite sporadic enemy attacks, it was revealed today.
American and British warships escorted the transports and cargo ships
of the convoy and much of the trip was made through heavy fog, which
restricted enemy submarines and planes. The trip was described as
"uneventful."
The troops were hurried away to start invasion training as fast as
they could be landed.
The landing was the first visible result of the promise by Gen. George C.
Marshall, U.S. Army chief of staff, during a recent visit to Britain (hat a
steady flow of men and supplies would be sent across the ocean to insure
"an early victory." It also lent emphasis to Marshall's statement that
American troops would be operating against the enemy in the very near
future.
WASHINGTON ANNOUNCES ARRIVAL
Washington announced the arrival, saying "the number is substantially
larger than previous contingents and includes tank units."
The new contingent came generally from the same section of the United
States as did earlier arrivals in northern Ireland—South Dakota, lowa,
Minnesota, and other Middle Western states. There were others, how
ever, including Sgt. Edward Collings of New York; Sgt. Charles Burns,
also of New York, who drove the first tank from the docks, and Sgt. Bonnie
Jenkins, of Opelika, Ala., who drove the second tank.
AMERICAN HELMETS HUN-LIKE'
One man came down the gangplank on crutches. lie was Sgt. Galen
Quinn of Sturgis, S.D., who said, "They told me I could have stayed behind
and let this broken ankle heal but I could not pass up the opportunity
to come with my buddies."
The new arrivals will give Britons their first look at the new American
helmets, which are almost embarrassingly "Hun-like."
A shower o. cigarettes and souvenir dimes from the troop ships greeted
British Tommies waiting on the quayside to help the Yanks with their
baggage.
