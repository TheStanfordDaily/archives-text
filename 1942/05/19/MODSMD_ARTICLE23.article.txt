# Women to Take Summer Class In Engineering
## Enrollees Must Agree To Take Jobs in War Industries if Needed 
### 
A tt'ii-week course in engineering
drafting and technical calculations
for women will he given here this
simmicr quarter, starling June '12, as
a part <,f the Engineering, Science,
and Management Defense Training
l*ro;>iam sponsored and financed by
(lii I S. Oilice of Education.
W omen taking the course will not
asked to pay tuition, will receive
no University credit, and will be
ii'.l.od Id accept employment in war
induslrirs upon completion of the
cour t l , if they are needed.
A'- uding to Professor Lydik S.
Jacuhsen, of the mechanical engi
lK-r) hi;' department, who described
t! t: (on so at Women's Conference
y '' ' lii.v, the war has "forced the
• inei'i- to five some of their se
cret' away."
i'.JMIT-lioillt DAY
'I h; course, he said, is scheduled
on an eight-hour-a-day basis, but
only part of this time will be spent
at the dialling board, since trips to
I lie shops and laboratories will take
up a good portion of the women's
time.
"\.Ve want them to know what
they're putting on paper," Mr. Jacob
s'-n said.
In the ten-week course, the
women will receive 70 hours more
d: It in.'.; training than an engineer
i"' Indent receives in three years,
hut. the professor said, while the
co use will be stiff, it will not be
"too stiff."
lie pointed out that Stanford wom
en are being given first choice on
the class, although any women who
ha: graduated from high school and
had two years of mathematics while
in high school will be eligible to
apply,
A similar course, of five weeks'
duration, was given to women at
U.C. during the last semester. Ac
cording to Mr. Jacobsen, 38 women
took the course, and all 38 women
now have jobs. Base pay for these
women, most of whom are now !
working at Mare Island Navy Yard,
is $1440 a year.
JOB OFFERED
1 suggest that only senior women, i
or women who do not intend to fin- |
ish their college training, take the i
course, he said, "since there is a
gentlewoman's agreement between
her and the government about tak
ing a job when she finishes."
Women in the course may live in
University dormitories this summer
if they wish, although there is no
ruling on the matter, and it is prob
able that many will live off campus.
Cost of the course will be between
$l. r > and $25, depending on whether!
a woman must buy all her drafting
tools.
"This is a course in practice—not
theory," the professor explained,
"and incidentally there's no home
work, which makes up for the eight !
hours in class."
Instructors will be Professor Ja- J
cobsen; Ralph T. Challender, pro- |
lessor of general engineering at
Montana State College; and Ralph A.
Seban, instructor in the mechanical
engineering department here.
