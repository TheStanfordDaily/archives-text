# Tin Can Salvage Begins Saturday
## 
### 
Aiding a nationwide campaign to
, f ;et essential materials back into
production, Stanford's "Salvage for
Victory" organization will make a
campus-wide collection of tin cans
early Saturday morning.
Tin cans should be broken at both
ends, smashed flat, washed, and the
labels removed, according to Ed
Porter, drive chairman. They should
then be placed in a box near the
gunny-sack arrangement now exist
ing in tho alleys of most living
groups on campus and on the front
curbs of private residences on
campus.
Steel mills in California are de
pendent on scrap for 85 per cent of
their steel supply, and tin cans hav
ing over 98 per cent steel are a vital
source of scrap. "Start saving tin
cans now," said Porter.
Save old newspapers and maga
zines for the salvage collector.
