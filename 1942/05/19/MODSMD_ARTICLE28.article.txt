# Jap Column Routed In Kunming Drive
## 
### United Press 
Japanese spearheads driving from Burma into China's Yunnan Prov
ince, in an effort to smash Generalissimo Chiang Kai-Shek's government
before embarking on new campaigns, were repulsed by the Chinese again
yesterday and il appeared that the durable men of Cathay again would
prove themselves among the stronger members of the family of the

j United Nations.
Chungking claimed Chinese troops \
I had completely destroyed one Japa- i
! nese mobile column north of the I
Burma Road, along which the Nip- !
ponese were advancing toward the !
j American volunteer group's ad- I
vanced flying base at Paoshan. and ;
j were battling other invader col-
I umns to a standstill.
The general impression, on the
basis of Monday's dispatches, was
that the Chinese were determined to
! fight, on and on, despite their de
! feat in Burma, and that the Japa
' nese would have very hard going to |
i reach their objective — Kunming, j
j capital of Yunnan Province and a
i key communications center for 1
I Chiang's southwest defense zone. j
BURMA "CO-OPERATING"
On the Burma front the last of the
British Imperial Army which made
the long northward retreat from
Rangoon appeared to be moving in
to India and Tokyo claimed that a
majority of the Burmese cabinet,
which remained behind after the
British evacuation of Mandalay, had ;
established contact with the Japa
nese army and was ready to "co
operate." Formation of a Burmese
puppet government, linked with
Japan along lines similar to Man
chukuo, seemed likely.
In Australia, Sir Keith Murdock,
publisher of the Melbourne Herald,
brought into the open the long dis
pute which has been under way in I
1 Washington and London as to i

whether or not Australia is getting
: her share of U.S. Lend-lease muni
i tions, ships, and man-power.
The publisher, a potent force in
! British Imperial politics, implied
: that Australia was not and warned
j President Roosevelt and Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill that "disas
trous consequences" may follow their
policy of attempting merely to hold
Japan in the Pacific while concen
trating their main effort against
Germany.
QUESTION OF POLICY
Crux of this dispute is whether it
is better policy to divert the bulk of
American supplies to Russia, so that
j country can hold out against Ger
many and thus give the United
Plates time to build up overwhelm
ing strength, or to split our forces
between Russia and the European
front on the one hand, and Austra
lia and China on the other.
Despite Australian perturbation
most impartial military experts be
! lieve the policy of Russia first and
Australia second is correct, since a
collapse of Russia might result in
loss of the entire global war while
any temporary Japanese occupation
of Australia presumably would have
no major effect on the eventual out
come of the world conflict.
SATO CONFERS
One danger to Ihc United Nat ions,
some Far Eastern observers feared,
was that the defeat of Germany

would take so long that Japan would
have time to consolidate her posi
tion throughout the western Pacific
and East Asia and thus become so
powerful that her defeat, even with
Germany and Italy out of the pic
ture, would be an extremely costly
undertaking.
The Tokyo Radio reported that the
new Japanese ambassador in Kuiby
shev. Naotake Sato, had a long con
ference on an undisclosed topic with
the Russian Foreign Affairs Commis
sar Sunday. It was possible the
ambassador was pressing for more
Soviet concessions to Japan, in
cluding Tokyo's desire for a demili
tarization of the border areas be
tween Nipponese and Russian
spheres in Asia.

SATO CONFERS
One danger to Ihc United Nat ions,
some Far Eastern observers feared,
was that the defeat of Germany

would take so long that Japan would
have time to consolidate her posi
tion throughout the western Pacific
and East Asia and thus become so
powerful that her defeat, even with
Germany and Italy out of the pic
ture, would be an extremely costly
undertaking.
The Tokyo Radio reported that the
new Japanese ambassador in Kuiby
shev. Naotake Sato, had a long con
ference on an undisclosed topic with
the Russian Foreign Affairs Commis
sar Sunday. It was possible the
ambassador was pressing for more
Soviet concessions to Japan, in
cluding Tokyo's desire for a demili
tarization of the border areas be
tween Nipponese and Russian
spheres in Asia.
Japanese spearheads driving from Burma into China's Yunnan Prov

Burma Road, along which the Nip- !

that the Chinese were determined to

BURMA "CO-OPERATING"
On the Burma front the last of the
British Imperial Army which made
the long northward retreat from
Rangoon appeared to be moving in
to India and Tokyo claimed that a
majority of the Burmese cabinet,
which remained behind after the
British evacuation of Mandalay, had ;
established contact with the Japa
nese army and was ready to "co
operate." Formation of a Burmese
puppet government, linked with
Japan along lines similar to Man
chukuo, seemed likely.
In Australia, Sir Keith Murdock,

brought into the open the long dis

whether or not Australia is getting

The publisher, a potent force in

the long northward retreat from
Rangoon appeared to be moving in
to India and Tokyo claimed that a
majority of the Burmese cabinet,
which remained behind after the
British evacuation of Mandalay, had ;
established contact with the Japa
nese army and was ready to "co
operate." Formation of a Burmese
puppet government, linked with
Japan along lines similar to Man
chukuo, seemed likely.
In Australia, Sir Keith Murdock,
publisher of the Melbourne Herald,
brought into the open the long dis
pute which has been under way in I
1 Washington and London as to i

whether or not Australia is getting
: her share of U.S. Lend-lease muni
i tions, ships, and man-power.
The publisher, a potent force in
! British Imperial politics, implied
: that Australia was not and warned
j President Roosevelt and Prime Min
ister Winston Churchill that "disas
trous consequences" may follow their
policy of attempting merely to hold
Japan in the Pacific while concen
trating their main effort against
Germany.
QUESTION OF POLICY
Crux of this dispute is whether it
is better policy to divert the bulk of
American supplies to Russia, so that
j country can hold out against Ger
many and thus give the United
Plates time to build up overwhelm
ing strength, or to split our forces
between Russia and the European
front on the one hand, and Austra
lia and China on the other.
Despite Australian perturbation
most impartial military experts be
! lieve the policy of Russia first and
Australia second is correct, since a
collapse of Russia might result in
loss of the entire global war while
any temporary Japanese occupation
of Australia presumably would have
no major effect on the eventual out
come of the world conflict.
SATO CONFERS
One danger to Ihc United Nat ions,
some Far Eastern observers feared,
was that the defeat of Germany

would take so long that Japan would
have time to consolidate her posi
tion throughout the western Pacific
and East Asia and thus become so
powerful that her defeat, even with
Germany and Italy out of the pic
ture, would be an extremely costly
undertaking.
The Tokyo Radio reported that the
new Japanese ambassador in Kuiby
shev. Naotake Sato, had a long con
ference on an undisclosed topic with
the Russian Foreign Affairs Commis
sar Sunday. It was possible the
ambassador was pressing for more
Soviet concessions to Japan, in
cluding Tokyo's desire for a demili
tarization of the border areas be
tween Nipponese and Russian
spheres in Asia.
