# Farm Houses Cartoonist's Descendant
## 
### 
Hie Stanforditcs who avidly fid
low the antics of • IVrry and the Pi
rates." "Lit" Abner," "Superman,"
and the rest «f today's super-svelte
stars of She comic strips have in
their midst, whether they know it
or not, a direct descendant of the
man who started tin- now nourish
ing comic strip industry.
The descendant is Dick Outcault,
a freshman at Encina. The man who
started the whole thing was R. F.
Outcault, Dick's grandfather and the
originator of "The Yellow Kid" and
"Buster Brown."
The first of the modern comics
was old R. F.'s "The Yellow Kid."'
R. F. hud been doing an occasional
drawing for the Sunday supplement
of Joseph Pulitzer's World, of New
York. Tii is was called "Hogan's
Alley." Then, as Dick relates, one
day in 1895 the World's pressroom
accidentally ran the comic through
the presses with the main character,
"the kid," dressed in a brilliant yel
low. From that day <111 the draw
ing was known as "The Yellow
Kid" and was a real success.
SINGLE PANEL
Run as a weekly feature, "The
Yellow Kid," Dick tells, was only
one big drawing with all the action
included in the single panel. It
was not until Bud Fisher began
drawing "Mutt and JefT" for the
San Francisco Chronicle in 1907 that
the idea of the comic strip origi
nated.
But meantime, says the Encina
man. William Randolph Hearst came
to New York and in 189(>, in cut
throat competition with the great
Pulitzer, succeeded in "stealing" the
whole staff of the World's Sunday
edition, including R. F. Outcault,
from Pultizer.
GOES TO HEARST
Dick says that his grandfather
wanted to be paid by the drawing
so that so long as he got his draw
ings in on time he could do any
thing he wished instead of having
to come down to his office in the
World building every day. Hearst
apparently allowed this but Pulit
zer wouldn't.
Later R. F. gained even greater
fame with his regular comic strip
"Buster Brown," which, Dick says,
"was drawn from characters in my
grandfather's own family." He also
tells how mothers from all over the
country would write R. F. when
their sons would try—unsuccess
fully—to imitate the antics of Bus
ter Brown, who, according to Dick,
was caricatured from R. F.'s son,
Dick's father.
R. F. later drew several other
strips, including "Little Old Mose,"
and ran an advertising agency in
Chicago in his hist years. He died
in 1928.
DICK PRE-I.EGAL
Good-looking, blond Dick, how
ever, has no ambitions to follow in
the footsteps of his grandfather. He
is taking pre-legal work and even
tually hopes to establish as fine a
reputation as a lawyer as his grand
father established as a cartoonist.
His home is now Palm Springs, to
which his family moved from Chi
cago when he was 12.
And when asked his opinion of
Stanford he said, "1 like it very

"was drawn from characters in my
grandfather's own family." He also
tells how mothers from all over the
country would write R. F. when
their sons would try—unsuccess
fully—to imitate the antics of Bus
ter Brown, who, according to Dick,
was caricatured from R. F.'s son,
Dick's father.
R. F. later drew several other
strips, including "Little Old Mose,"
and ran an advertising agency in
Chicago in his hist years. He died
in 1928.
DICK PRE-I.EGAL
Good-looking, blond Dick, how
ever, has no ambitions to follow in
the footsteps of his grandfather. He
is taking pre-legal work and even
tually hopes to establish as fine a
reputation as a lawyer as his grand
father established as a cartoonist.
His home is now Palm Springs, to
which his family moved from Chi
cago when he was 12.
And when asked his opinion of
Stanford he said, "1 like it very
Hie Stanforditcs who avidly fid
low the antics of • IVrry and the Pi
rates." "Lit" Abner," "Superman,"
and the rest «f today's super-svelte
stars of She comic strips have in
their midst, whether they know it
or not, a direct descendant of the
man who started tin- now nourish
ing comic strip industry.
The descendant is Dick Outcault,
a freshman at Encina. The man who
started the whole thing was R. F.
Outcault, Dick's grandfather and the
originator of "The Yellow Kid" and
"Buster Brown."
The first of the modern comics
was old R. F.'s "The Yellow Kid."'
R. F. hud been doing an occasional
drawing for the Sunday supplement
of Joseph Pulitzer's World, of New
York. Tii is was called "Hogan's
Alley." Then, as Dick relates, one
day in 1895 the World's pressroom
accidentally ran the comic through
the presses with the main character,
"the kid," dressed in a brilliant yel
low. From that day <111 the draw
ing was known as "The Yellow
Kid" and was a real success.
SINGLE PANEL
Run as a weekly feature, "The
Yellow Kid," Dick tells, was only
one big drawing with all the action
included in the single panel. It
was not until Bud Fisher began
drawing "Mutt and JefT" for the
San Francisco Chronicle in 1907 that
the idea of the comic strip origi
nated.
But meantime, says the Encina
man. William Randolph Hearst came
to New York and in 189(>, in cut
throat competition with the great
Pulitzer, succeeded in "stealing" the
whole staff of the World's Sunday
edition, including R. F. Outcault,
from Pultizer.
GOES TO HEARST
Dick says that his grandfather
wanted to be paid by the drawing
so that so long as he got his draw
ings in on time he could do any
thing he wished instead of having
to come down to his office in the
World building every day. Hearst
apparently allowed this but Pulit
zer wouldn't.
Later R. F. gained even greater
fame with his regular comic strip
"Buster Brown," which, Dick says,
"was drawn from characters in my
grandfather's own family." He also
