# Advertise the Honor Code
## 
### 
RECENTLY there has been an increased
amount of perennial concern over the sta
tus of the Honor Codeâ€”whether it is working
satisfactorily, whether wartime pressure on
some men seeking commissions in the service
has relaxed their ethics in order to obtain better
grades.
There has been due amount of study on the
question of whether the faculty or the students
themselves are the ones who actually turn in
violators, and it has been found by Men's and
Women's Councils that it is the faculty which
makes the majority of the reports.
Extent of punishment for those convicted of
infractions has also been debated; a student
body poll revealed the students themselves feel
expulsion would be too severe a penalty.
One of the most amazing results of the poll
was that approximately half the students who
answered question 7 revealed they do not con
sider walking out of the Union Cellar, without
paying their check, an Honor Code violation.
Over 400 students were of this opinion, and
yet the act of purposely not paying a check is
purely one of dishonesty.
To the general question, "Do you think the
Honor Code is working successfully?" the
"Yes" to "No" answers were 796 to 123. Yet
there were 355 students who answered "In
definite to the question, and this figure repre
sents almost half as many students as replied
"Yes."
This would indicate there is considerable
doubt as to the efficiency of the Honor Code.
following the poll, Men's and Women's
Councils went on record as recognizing student
opinion as being against the penalty of expul
sion, recommended that students who see a
violation report it to the head of Men's or
Women's Council or discuss it with the pro
fessor or with the individual concerned, and
further recommended that students not take
examinations from classrooms unless the rooms
are overcrowded.
It appears the councils are doing all they can
to publicize the Honor Code and keep it in the
mind of the student body. Nevertheless, it
seems this job could be undertaken by an
organization which could devote time and tal
ent to publicizing skillfully the Honor Code,
particularly at the beginning of each quarter.
They could go a lot farther with the undertaking
than has been the practice of the councils and
of pre-registration and orientation committees.
Is this not a job which could be handled ca
pably by the Stanford chapter of Alpha Delta
Sigma, national honorary advertising fraternity?
Strengthened student adherence to the Code
could be brought about by a continual campus
advertising campaign, if handled cleverly.
Let's do a real advertising job for the Honor
Code. Let's be proud of it!
