# From the Top of the Libe

STANFORD has the best campus in the world.
Two afternoons in the top of the Hoover
Library with weather like this and you will be
convinced that Duke, Virginia, Michigan, Cor
nell and all the other widely heralded campuses
must take back seats.
Nine thousand acres stretch away on all sides.
Everything is still green and the sun glances
off the lake as a slight wind whistles through
the wires and stays of the carillon bells.
Stanford is not jammed into a city or backed
under a hill; its living guarters are not next to
street-car tracks or over drug stores. There is
plenty of room, yet not too much.
The Farm is marvelous. Hap Everett
