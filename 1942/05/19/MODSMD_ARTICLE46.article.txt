### AMIE REICHERT 
r J , HE correspondents who have recently been re
leased from internment in German concentration
camps have been deluging the nation's press with most
cheering news. They tell us that Germany is exhausted
and desperate, that her people are war-weary. Whether
they actually say so or not, the headlines imply that
Germany is on the skids, that her people are ripe for
revolution.
I hate to be an old soui*puss, but I think the atti
tude such reports are capable of engendering is a dan
gerous one and bad for morale. This is what I mean.
Yesterday in this paper a great headline announced
that "GERMANY, TORN AND EXHAUSTED, PRE
PARES FOR DO-OR-DIE % EFFORT." Nowhere in the
story were the words "torn and exhausted" used de
scribing the state of Grmany's military machine or
her internal conditions. What the writer said was this:
"German manpower is already strained beyond the
danger point. . . . Though it is impossible to estimate
exact numbers, Germany has suffered extremely high
casualties. . . . There is no shortage of guns or muni
tions, but German production is believed to be slip
ping."
Reports about the internal conditions have consist
ently emphasized that although conditions are very
bad, Germany is still caught firmly as ever in the vise
of Hitler's Gestapo.
* * * -■*
is not heresy. The Daily has by no means been
the only offender. All over the country papers
have played up the Lisbon reports and exaggerated or
printed half-truths in the headlines. And the trouble
with this is that most people seldom read beyond the
headlines.
The reports from Germany are of course very en
couraging to the United Nations. But it must be re
membered that no correspondent has predicted a Ger
man revolution at this time, or has hazarded the rash
prediction that this war will be won through internal
collapse. The conquered peoples all over Europe are
enough evidence to convince us that unarmed men can
do little against Gestapo thugs toting submachine guns.
One medium bomber is enough to keep an entire area
in terror.
Germany will be beaten, yes, and the next few
months will tell the story of when that defeat will
come. But Germany will be beaten first, and then she
will revolt, just as she did in the last war. We cannot
count on this weapon except as an added gift to the
Allied victoi-y once that victory has been achieved.

is not heresy. The Daily has by no means been
the only offender. All over the country papers
have played up the Lisbon reports and exaggerated or
printed half-truths in the headlines. And the trouble
with this is that most people seldom read beyond the
headlines.
The reports from Germany are of course very en
couraging to the United Nations. But it must be re
membered that no correspondent has predicted a Ger
man revolution at this time, or has hazarded the rash
prediction that this war will be won through internal
collapse. The conquered peoples all over Europe are
enough evidence to convince us that unarmed men can
do little against Gestapo thugs toting submachine guns.
One medium bomber is enough to keep an entire area
in terror.
Germany will be beaten, yes, and the next few
months will tell the story of when that defeat will
come. But Germany will be beaten first, and then she
will revolt, just as she did in the last war. We cannot
count on this weapon except as an added gift to the
Allied victoi-y once that victory has been achieved.
r J , HE correspondents who have recently been re
leased from internment in German concentration
camps have been deluging the nation's press with most
cheering news. They tell us that Germany is exhausted
and desperate, that her people are war-weary. Whether
they actually say so or not, the headlines imply that
Germany is on the skids, that her people are ripe for
revolution.
I hate to be an old soui*puss, but I think the atti
tude such reports are capable of engendering is a dan
gerous one and bad for morale. This is what I mean.
Yesterday in this paper a great headline announced
that "GERMANY, TORN AND EXHAUSTED, PRE
PARES FOR DO-OR-DIE % EFFORT." Nowhere in the
story were the words "torn and exhausted" used de
scribing the state of Grmany's military machine or
her internal conditions. What the writer said was this:
"German manpower is already strained beyond the
danger point. . . . Though it is impossible to estimate
exact numbers, Germany has suffered extremely high
casualties. . . . There is no shortage of guns or muni
tions, but German production is believed to be slip
ping."
Reports about the internal conditions have consist
ently emphasized that although conditions are very
bad, Germany is still caught firmly as ever in the vise
of Hitler's Gestapo.
