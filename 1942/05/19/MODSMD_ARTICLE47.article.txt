# BULL SESSION
## HAY FEVER 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
J^LASH!
Your Bull Sessioner was just prostrated to the
floor by a body-rending spasm of sneezing.
Since we had a short No. 7 to write on the activi
ties of Stanford's chemistry department in aiding the
war effort, we just sat down at the Bull Sessioner's
favorite little Underwood, and there was the bare be
ginning of one of those inspired and inspiring daily
stints of one D. M. Churchill.
But just then the board of censors dropped in to
tell us there was just nothing we could say about the
activities of Stanford's chemistry department in aiding
the war effort.
By this time (20 minutes later) the Bull Sessioner
was just recovering from his paroxysms, and we threw
some more pepper in his face. This was to keep him
sneezing so we could carry out an idea which just
came to us. Why not tell the campus some things they
might not know about their Bull Sessioner?
Why not?
What most of his readers do not know is that his
"infernal machine" is located at the spot in the Shack
from which it is possible to get a rabbit's-eye-view of
all the beautiful legs of all the beautiful Daily women.
On days when he has nothing else to say he has
told you a good deal about himself, but we'll wager
you didn't know your meek Bull Sessioner was a con
noisseur of legs. He calls them "sets of pins" up in
Canada so that all the home folks won't know what
he has been spending his time and money learning
about down here.
If the people who handle the foreign exchange up
there got wind of this they wouldnt let him have any
more money. And that would be disastrous for Mike.
They still can't figure out why he has already been in
college for six and a half years without getting a degree.
Whoops, he's recovering. Some pollen, copy-boy!
If he keeps this up much longer we'll have almost
enough for a whole Bull Session. He would undoubt
edly start right in again talking about how he was
going to be subjected to all kinds of physical torture
like push-ups and shadow boxing. It is very probable
he would never even notice that we had just about
filled the column.
We would like to take this opportunity to tell Bull
Session readers that we will watch Mike closely every
day while he is turning out his journalistic gems and
the next time his hay fever strikes we will take over
with some more inside dope on "Stanford's best-read
columnist" except for History and Sideline Slants.
