# CAMPUS OPINION

### 
r FHE EDITOR, SIR:
When the changing of 2:.')0 late leaves to l:3o's
was put before the women students for vote, the ap
proval would have been equivalent to giving Confer
ence a blanket ticket to do what they pleased with
late leaves. The advocates told us that "provisions
would be made," which guarantees exactly nothing
at all.
It seems to me there is something the student lead
ers have overlooked, and that is the fact that Stanford
students are as a rule willing to co-operate with sug
gestions they think reasonable. Why not, then, instead
of cutting down the hour on late leaves, start a cam
paign for "getting in early?" With its excellent per
suasive powers, I'm sure Women's Conference could
put over this campaign with a minimum of difficulty.
The prophets of the change themselves inform us
that most girls get in by 1:40. Doesn't this seem to in
dicate that the girls as a rule will come in without
legislation, when they've had enough? If the girls
come in most of the time by 1:40 it would seem to
indicate that they are making full use of the additional
hour when they do take it. Those people who stay out
to the last minute simply because they fee! it to be
an insult to their dates to come in earlier, would cer
tainly be glad of the excuse which a "get-in-early"
campaign would give them. It seems to me that this
would encourage responsibility and co-operativeness
in each girl: it would give each of us a chance to be
patriotic on our own. Furthermore, this would be in
keeping with the University's policy of allowing its
students to grow up and to assume responsibility on
their own. Only when the students prove that they are
incapable of self-limitation should arbitrary orders
from Conference be crammed down their throats.
Yours truly,
Sue Stewart
