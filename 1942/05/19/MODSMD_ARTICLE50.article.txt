# Hope Stars With Quips In Spy Show
## 
### 
"MY FAVORITE BLONDE," now
playing at the Stanford in Palo Alto.
This has been a season of good
comedies, but "My Favorite Blonde"
is very probably the best. In my
opinion it is unqualifiedly the best.
Bob Hope's quips never came
thicker and faster, but they are not
all that give the picture its break
neck momentum. There is a gen
uinely sinister coast-to-coast plot,
involving every known variety of
predicament, with hardly a second's
let-up in laughs all the way from
New York to Los Angeles.
The picture begins like a Hitch
cock horror story, and you wonder
how Hope is going to fit in. He not
only fits in, but keeps proceedings at
a riotous pace throughout.
And then there is Madeleine Car
roll.â€”Covey
