# Women Asked to Discuss Amended 1:30 Proposals
## 
### JEAN NOWELL 
Definite action on the stormy late-
Jeave controversy was postponed by
Women's Conference yesterday
pending further discussion in the
various women's living groups.
At last night's house meetings the
women were asked for discussion of
and suggestions for an amended
version of the present late-leave
system. Because so many women
suggested last Monday that thÂ£
present floaters remain as 2:3o's, with
the regular 2:3o's being changed to
1:30s, Irma Jean Hannibal, president
of Conference, described how such a
system might work out, if adopted.
SUGGESTED PLAN
Freshman women: one 1:30 a
week, to be taken on a week-end
night, and three floating 2:3o's.
Sophomore women with a C av
erage: two l:3o's a week and three
midweek 12 o'clocks; but three of
these l:3o's to be taken as 2:3o's.
Sophomore women with a B aver
age: two l:3o's a week, one mid
week 12 o'clock each week, two
floating l:3o's and three floating
2:3o's during a quarter.

Junior women: same as above.
Senior women with a B average: J
same as above.
Senior women with a C average: j
unlimited l:3o's and three floating i
2:3o's.
AMENDMENTS WELCOME
Miss Hannibal emphasized that
the above program is "only a sug
gestion," worked out by members of
Conference and Council on the basis
of last Monday night's voting, and
that suggestions on or amendments
to this plan will be welcomed.
It was also suggested at yester
day's meeting that some provision
be made for extra 2:3o's to be grant
ed in event of an emergency, on
petition of Women's Council, in the
event that some sort of 1:30 system
is adopted.
Miss Hannibal asked each mem
ber to bring written reports on the
conclusions reached in her living
group to Conference next week. At
that time it will be decided whether
to ask for a vote in next Monday's
house meetings, or to delay action
for further discussion.
