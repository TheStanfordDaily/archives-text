(Editor's Note: This article was
written by Mr. Hoyt for Quill
Magazine, and was delivered to a
Stanford Sigma Delta Chi chapter
dinner at the San Francisco Press
Club recently. It is the first of a
scries of Daily articles pertaining
to freedom of the press during
war time.)

Publisher, Portland Orcgonian
"Someone has said that 'Freedom
of the Press' is nothing more and
nothing less than 'The People's
Right to Know'."
"In a democracy at war, it is pe
culiarly and particularly the people's
right to know. They must know their
weaknesses, no matter how vast, as
well as their strengths. They must
know their losses, no matter how
bitter, as well as their victories.
"On Feb. 27, the aircraft tender
Langley was sunk off Java. On
March 1, the naval tanker Pecos was
torpedoed. Seven hundred Ameri
can lives and much valuable equip
ment were lost.
MAJOR DISASTER
% "It was a major disaster and yet
the news of this debacle was not
released until April 3.
"More than a month elapsed be
tween the sinking of the Langley and
the public's awareness of that dis
aster.
"That month represented a loss of
time in the further national recogni
tion of our serious plight. Who
knows what added impetus might
have been given the sale of defense
bonds or the solution of labor prob
lems by an earlier acknowledge
ment?
PRKSS CRITICISMS
"With most critics of the Press, I
have scant sympathy, but of the fact
that the Press needs criticism as
well as government, there can be
scant doubt, and that criticism
should come from within the Press
itself. I refer specifically to loose

policies of editing and headline
writing.
"Sincc the start of the Russian
campaign in the early winter, I sub
mit that any intelligent person who
had read only the banner lines in
meti*opolitan papers would be en
tirely convinced that every German
had been pushed back through Italy
into the Mediterranean Sea.
"Naturally all the fault in con
nection with superoptimistic head
lines does not lie with newspaper
editors and deskmen.
COMPLETE NEWS
. . help must come from the
government itself so that within the
limits of reason it may be presumed
by newspapers that the news of the
day released in Army and Navy
communiques is accurate and com
plete.
"One of the things that is going
to win this war for America and the
United Nations is a rising conscious


PALMER HOYT
ness among the people that we might
lose it.
"The people want to know why we
are still playing politics when our
very lives are at stake; they want to
know why deeper cuts have not
been made in non-essential spend
ing. They want to know all about
the rubber situation. They want to
know why a ceiling has not already
been set on wages, profits, and
prices. «
