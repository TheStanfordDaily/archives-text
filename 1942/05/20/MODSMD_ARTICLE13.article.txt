Over 40 Stanford men and women

be given the wounded. Stocks of
plasma are also being maintained in
; cities liable to air attack for the use
of possible civilian casualties.
"The process of giving blood is
, absolutely painless," said Rosemary
I Goodwin, head of the Blood Bank di

Committee.
"There is practically no after ef

> avoid any fatty foods, milk, butter,
and so on, for at least four hours be
fore giving blood."
The Red Cross Motor Corps will
provide transportation for donors
from the campus to the Community
Center in Palo Alto, where the mo
