### 
Stanford students will have the
opportunity tomorrow to contrib
ute to the Dimes for Diplomas fund
at their living groups and at booths
around the campus.
"Lets all make a real efTort to
donate a dime this Thursday; that's
little enough we can do for our
friends, our brothers in the service,
and ourselves. With co-operation
and concentrated effort, we can look
forward to winning not only the
war. but an intelligent peace," re
marked Dale Hosman, chairman of
the drive.
I he goal set is $290, which will be
sufficient to send two men through
Stanford for a quarter after the
war.
