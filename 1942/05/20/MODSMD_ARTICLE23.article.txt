# Ex Committee Adopts Horton Reorganization Scheme For Next Year
## Revised Plan Recommended For Emergency 
### HAP EVERETT 
Ex Committee last night adopted a
resolution recommending the Hor
ton reorganization plan to next
years committee for adoption in
event the present system becomes
impractiable due to wartime condi
tions.
The revised plan provides for an
executive council at the head of the
student body government to include:
Eight voting members:
1. President of the student body.
2. Vice-president of the student
body.
3. President of Associated Men
4. President of Associated Women
5. Four members-at-large, includ
ing fine man and one woman from
the lower division, one man and one
woman from upper division.
Five ex-officio members:
1. Stanford War Activities Co
ordinator
2. Editor of The Daily
3. President of Men's Council
4. President of Women's Council
5. Student manager
The revised plan excluded the pro
posed athletic commissioner, repre
sentative of speech and drama, and
the student colonel of R.OTC
ONLY ONE ELECTION
The emergency provisional gov
ernment would include organization
of the men of the student body into
the Associated Men. The women
would similarly organize into the
Associated Women, dissolving Wom
en's Conference.
Harry Horton, head of the com
mittee that introduced the plan, ex
plained that in the new govertiment
there would be only one place for a
special election—in event of the
student body president being called
into the armed service. Replacing
the presidents of Associated Men and
Associated Women would be done
by vote of living group representa
tives, doing away with the necessity
of a general election.
NEW REPRESENTATION
Major change in the provisional
government is the substitution of
four members-at-large for the usual
class representatives. The committee
found class an invalid basis for rep
resentation in wartime because of
summer quarter attendance. The
members-at-large would be so ap
portioned as to give equal represen
tation to men and women, upper
and lower division.
The resolution adopted by Ex
Committee last night culminated
three months of investigation and
preparation by Horton and his
committee of Peggy Booth, Irma
Jean Hannibal, Leslie Langnccker,
and Don Dillon.
Other Ex Committee business will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.

resolution recommending the Hor
ton reorganization plan to next
years committee for adoption in
event the present system becomes
impractiable due to wartime condi
tions.
The revised plan provides for an
executive council at the head of the
student body government to include:
Eight voting members:
1. President of the student body.
2. Vice-president of the student
body.
3. President of Associated Men
4. President of Associated Women
5. Four members-at-large, includ
ing fine man and one woman from
the lower division, one man and one
woman from upper division.
Five ex-officio members:
1. Stanford War Activities Co
ordinator
2. Editor of The Daily
3. President of Men's Council
4. President of Women's Council
5. Student manager
The revised plan excluded the pro
posed athletic commissioner, repre
sentative of speech and drama, and
the student colonel of R.OTC
ONLY ONE ELECTION
The emergency provisional gov
ernment would include organization
of the men of the student body into
the Associated Men. The women
would similarly organize into the
Associated Women, dissolving Wom
en's Conference.
Harry Horton, head of the com
mittee that introduced the plan, ex
plained that in the new govertiment
there would be only one place for a
special election—in event of the
student body president being called
into the armed service. Replacing
the presidents of Associated Men and
Associated Women would be done
by vote of living group representa
tives, doing away with the necessity
of a general election.
NEW REPRESENTATION
Major change in the provisional
government is the substitution of
four members-at-large for the usual
class representatives. The committee
found class an invalid basis for rep
resentation in wartime because of
summer quarter attendance. The
members-at-large would be so ap
portioned as to give equal represen
tation to men and women, upper
and lower division.
The resolution adopted by Ex
Committee last night culminated
three months of investigation and
preparation by Horton and his
committee of Peggy Booth, Irma
Jean Hannibal, Leslie Langnccker,
and Don Dillon.
Other Ex Committee business will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.
