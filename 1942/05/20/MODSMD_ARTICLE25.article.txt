# Gen. 'Jimmie' Doolittle Describes Tokyo Bombing
## Big Jap Warship Left in Flames By Raiders; Details of Attack Given 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 19 (UP). —Brig. Gen. James 11. (Jimmy) Doo
little, famed speed flier who led 79 intrepid American volunteers in a
"highly destructive raid on the Japanese mainland" April IX, revealed to
night that not a single American plane was shot down in the audacious

attack.
Numerous details of the spectacu
lar raid were revealed for the first
time alter Doolittle and his com
rade*.-in-glory were decorated for
the historic achievement that repre
sented a substantial return payment
for Pearl Harbor.
Still zealously guarded, however,
was information as to the number
dI planes that participated in the
a!tacks, where they came from and
where they went after dropping
their lethal loads upon live big
Japanese cities.
This marked the first oflicial dis

closure that Doolittle led the raid
ers.
Then, in an oflicial statement and
later at a press conference, Doo
little gave a graphic account of the
attack in which he and his com
rades were revealed to have:
1. Scored a direct hit on a new
Jap cruiser or battleship which
was left in flames at a navy yard
just south of Tokyo.
2. Set fire to the largest air
plane factory in Japan—the Mit
subishi plant at Nagoya.
Doolittle instructed his men
that the imperial palace in Tokyo
was not to he bombed.
I. The medium bombers were
especially equipped for the task
and their crews practiced the plan
of attack for weeks before it was
carried out.
5. Members of the bomber crews
did not know what their mission
would be until they were ready to
take off.
(». Japanese anti-aircraft fire
was so inelfecitve (hat the Japs
shot down many of their own bar
rage balloons.
7. Doolittle identified the raid
ing planes as North American 15-25
medium bombers.
The Americans caught the Japs
completely off guard, racing in at
house-top altitudes to make sure of
their targets and then zooming to
1500 feet where they unloaded their
lethal "eggs" with such deadly ac
curacy that every bomb hit its tar
get.
Giving the lie to Tokyo claims that
nine of the attacking bombers were
shot down, Doolittle declared:
NO PLANES LOST
"We left no planes in Japan. Some
were damaged, but none were shot
down and none were damaged to an
extent that precluded their proceed
ing to their destination."
(One of the planes was revealed to
have made a forced landing in Si
beria. Its crew was interned by the
Russian government.)
Doolittle, who planned and or
ganized the raid, indicated the planes
flew in on the perplexed Japanese
from several directions. Asked if
such was the case, he said "we en
deavored to cause as much confu
sion as possible."
EXTENT OF TARGET
He disclosed that if he and his men
had chosen to do so, they would
have had "no difficulty" in bombing
the Imperial palace in Tokyo.
"Several bombs were dropped
within sight of the palace," he said,
"but I gave specific instructions not
to bomb it."
The Americans flew so low that
they could see the expression on the
Japanese faces, Doolittle said, and—
"I should say it was an expression
of surprise."
The bronzed and baldish little
hero said the target area was 40
miles long and five to 20 miles
wide, extending from north of Tokyo
south to Kanagawa, Yokohama, and
the navy yard at Yokouuka. Bombs
also were dropped in the indutsrial
towns of Nagoya, Osaka, and Kobe.
DAMAGE HEAVY
"It was difficult to tell what dam
age was done in some cases, but in
others it was easy," he said.
"At one place we hit a dock where
a great crane was clipped as though
some giant had flipped it off with
his forefinger.
