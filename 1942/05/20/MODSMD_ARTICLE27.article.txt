ing's opinion that "it is foolish to
drag out the last war's bogey-man
of Russian Bolshevism when it may
aid future German aggression," an
analysis of the present Russo-Ger
man conflict by three Stanford his
torians was presented to Tuesday
Evening Series-goers in a sympo
sium last night.
Professors Spalding, Harold Fish
er, and Ralph Lutz participated in
the discussion, which produced gen
eral agreement that mutual dis
trust among the Russian people and
their new democratic allies inusl
end if the United Nations are to win
the war and the peace.
USES DISTRUST
Hitler has made wonderful use of
this distrust in his pre-war plans
and now in his propaganda, and un
less such suspicion is ended, "our
war effort and the plans for a future
peace will be seriously impeded,"
Fisher stated.
The actions of the Russian lead
ers, their adherence to the expressed
peace aims of the Allies, the grow

mocracies and the Russians, and fu

overcome.
PRAISES RUSSIANS
Professor Lutz, in analyzing the
military .strategy of the Germans
against Russia, paid high praise to
the Russian counter-offensive of De
cember 7 which halted the Nn/.i
spearheads for the first time in
World War 11. However, Hitler has
any number of moves open to him,
aimed at Russian oil, and they will
bring the crisis.
"On April 2(i, 1942, the political
side of World War II was lost by
Germany," Lutz concluded after he
had analyzed the recent Hitler
speech to the German Reichstag.
ASKED POWER
There for the first time Hitler,
the supreme master of Germany,
felt that he h;id to ask for more
power, Lutz revealed, and he ad
mitted to his people that the Rus
sians had broken through the Ger
man lines at several points and that
his armies had not been ready for
the thrusts.
Spalding, discussing the qualifica
tions for effective Russian resistance,
mentioned the increasingly capable
Soviet military leadership and the
number of well-trained fighters, ci
vilian and professional, ready for
the coming months. But the prob
lem of supply is greatest, Spalding
observed, and it is probable that the
fall of the near-the-front Russian
industrial centers would effectively
reduce Russian opposition.

any number of moves open to him,

ASKED POWER
There for the first time Hitler,
the supreme master of Germany,
felt that he h;id to ask for more
power, Lutz revealed, and he ad
mitted to his people that the Rus
sians had broken through the Ger
man lines at several points and that
his armies had not been ready for
the thrusts.
Spalding, discussing the qualifica
tions for effective Russian resistance,
mentioned the increasingly capable
Soviet military leadership and the
number of well-trained fighters, ci
vilian and professional, ready for
the coming months. But the prob
lem of supply is greatest, Spalding
observed, and it is probable that the
fall of the near-the-front Russian
industrial centers would effectively
reduce Russian opposition.
To build a Navy large enough to

USES DISTRUST
Hitler has made wonderful use of
this distrust in his pre-war plans

war effort and the plans for a future
