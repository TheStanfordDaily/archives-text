## 
### 
At a conference held Monday
night, the sponsors of the Stanford
Emergency Conservation School re
leased the information that the pro
posed site for the school is at Hun
tington Lake in the High Sierras of
Fresno County.
At the present time, because of
stringent Stale Guard regulations,
only property owners are permitted
entry to the lake. Passes to the Stan- j
ford school will presumably be
granted, since the local Forest Serv- j
ice supervisor, M. A. Benedict, has j
assured full and. unqualified co- I
operation.
Miss Bailey, secretary of the His- i
tory Department, who is acting as j
secretary for the school, reports that
volunteers are signing up and bring- i
ing in more recruits to join the ,
conservation school. All informa
tion about the school is available in
Room 215.
