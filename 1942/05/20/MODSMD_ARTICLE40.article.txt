# GRIDIRON ACCENT ON SOPHS
## 
### 
There'll be an accent on sophomores next fall when
Stanford steps onto the gridiron to make a hid for the
championship in wartime football. A host of second
year men permeate the spring squad, and Coaches Jim
Lawsou, Harry Shipkey, and Marchy Schwartz are
putting their confidence in the sophs to turn the trick
along with their more experienced elders, such as
Chuck Taylor, Bruno Banducci, lid Stamm, Loren La-
Pradc, licet Armstrong, Buck Fawcett, Milt Vucinich,

Hank Nor berg,
et al.
The Redskin
line is pretty
well filled with
veterans, but at
the ends, Harry
Shipkey's frosh
are among the
front - runners
for first - string
positions. At left
where Norberg
has the experi
ence edge is
Dave Brown,
one - time Pied
mo nt High-
Schooler, who is
doing an all -
around job in
Stanford Ath
letics.
Graduate from
the frosh foot
ball and basket-

ball ranks, Brown is definitely one of the best flank
prospects on the squad. Tall, weighing around the 180
mark, Brown has shown a great deal of promise dur

ing the first five weeks of spring practice.
Other candidates with playing experience are Roger
Laverty and Hank Hege, both fast and good on the re
ceiving end.
Three sophs are pervading right end: Pete August,
Bob Hall, and Bill Wilson. Russ Peck, the Farm's most \
all-around man, came out for the squad recently, and
also shows good possibilities.
Into the backfield at. left half are three speedy |
freshmen, Clem Woods, Don Zappettinni, and Jim
Pettit. Switching to right half and full you find A1
Hoisch, Ross Dana, Fred Sanderman, and Bob Frisbee. !
Though lettermen are solid tackle to tackle, there |
are younger men hammering away for forward wall j
places. Bill Young, tackle, Johny Sogorka, guard, Jim j
Cox, tackle, and Jack McCurdy, center, are backing |
up the veteran Indians like Stamm, Banducci, Vuci- ,
nich, Mannon, Taylor, and McCain.
Jack Ileahl. one of the best end prospects, badly
injured a knee during recent scrimmage, and may or
may not be in proper shape when the time comes. |
Harvey Bcrnhard, big lineman, hurt an ankle, and
will probably miss the final scrimmage next Satur
day, when the Indians wind up spring season on the
practice field. The final workout is open to the pub
lic and starts at 2:!J0.
Quarterback, key to the T, is a main worry.
Finding the man to replace AU-American Frankie
Albert keeps all three coaches busy. Although he has
only been at practice for two weeks, baseballer Ray
Hammett has already improved over last year. Li'l A1
Cole, who'll be remembered for his brilliant passing
against Washington State last year, rates alongside
Hammett in the signal-calling market.
Says Lawson: "Looks to me like the boys really
like practice. They even ask for that scrimmage
every day. Harry, Marchy, and I feel sure the
younger players are going to do a job like Stanford's
vow ami wow boys have always done."
