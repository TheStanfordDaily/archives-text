### H. D. THOREAU 
< > NLY man in the country with a
better high hurdle mark this
season than Ed Hertel's 14.3 is
Pete Owens of Howard Payne col
lege in Texas.
Owens lias run 14.1, hut don't
let this scare you. Last year early
in the season he ran Hs.fl. hut
pulled an LI Foldo in the bigger
meets later in the year. In other
words, out of the wreck that was
supposed In he Stanford's track
team litis spring, Pitch Johnson
has extracted a possible national
champion, but it doesn't stop there.
With little competition Hertel
dashed off a 23.4 flight of low hur
dles, which puts him second to Bob
Wri«;;ht of Ohio State, who recently
ripped oil 23.2.
Ed Stamm rates as the third best
shot putter in college competition
behind A1 Blozi.s of Georgetown and
Carl Merrii) e f U.S.C.
Wiliard Smith and Vcrn Hart,
with either one of them jumping
G-4 e:»ch week, would be good for
points in any meet. The same goes
for Russ Peck and Ed Tomaso's
1 .*>-(» pole vault marks. Captain
Kern's consistent 23-(> broad jumps
might gt t him some points, and if
his jumping ankle heals, one can't
toll what will happen.
In the twinkling of an eye, we
have piled up an impressive total in
the N.C.A.A. meet, and this is view
ing the situation with a pessimistic
outlook.

AT 3 A.M. Sunday one of the
California state doubles cham
pions arrived back on the Stanford
campus after winning his title at
Santa Barbara over the week-end.
The one that came here was Ted
Schroeder. lie attends school here
and plays on our tennis team. With

our Golden Boy were Larry Dee,
Jimmy Wade, and a couple of
"eherchez le ..."
Dee and Wade, defending champs,
were eliminated in the semis by
George Richards and Chuck Matt
man, the team that our boy and his
partner, Jack Kramer, beat in the
finals. Both of the previously
njentioned matches were contested
through five sets.
Dee and Wade pulled the sensa
tional stunt of the tourney by
winning from Dave Freeman,
world's badminton champion, and
Doug Woodbury, ineligible Trojan,
after the latter tandem had match
point on Freeman's serve.
Incidentally, Wade and Freeman
used to be partners when both were
at Pasadena Jaysee, home of cham
pions. Richards was on the same
team.
