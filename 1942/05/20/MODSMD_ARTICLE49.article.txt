# Reorganization Should Work
## 
### 
EX COMMITTEE last night finally passed a
resolution for student government reorgani
zation on a wartime basis (see page 1), after a
special sub-committee had explored all possible
plans over a period of three months.
There are several aspects which the reorgani
zation involves and which should be under
stood by the student body.
First, why the reorganization? It was necessi
tated because the University is on a four-quar
ter-a-year, three-year basis for the duration. This
means there v/ill be no more "freshman," "soph
omore," "junior" and "senior" classes as such,
by name, and distinction of students by classes
will tend to dissolve. Consequently, there will
be no more class activities, such as the Junior
Prom.
To solve this problem, Ex Committee has rec
ommended the establishment of two groups ac
cording to sex and affiliation, and representa
tives from these classifications will comprise the
Associated Men and the Associated Women.
Further, there will be four members-at-large
elected to Ex Committee.
Ex Committee kept in mind the necessity for
streamlining student government as much as
possible, eliminating the need for so many long
and windy committee meetings. In this con
nection, the legislators cut the size of Ex Com
mittee as much as practicable.
It should be noted that one of the most im
portant steps in the plan is for the inclusion on
Ex Committee of the War Activities Co-ordina
tor, as an ex-officio member. This means he will
be expected to attend all meetings and partici
pate in all discussions, without vote. This is a
wise wartime measure, since the post of co-ordi
nator assumes almost as much importance as
that of the student body president in wartime.
These are the main points, then, in the reor
ganization plan, adopted by Ex Committee after
thorough investigation. The system should sat
isfy the wartime needs of the student body.
It should be further understood the plan was
merely recommended last night by the outgoing
Ex Committee to the incoming Ex Committee,
and that it will only be incorporated in the fu
ture when the four-quarter, three-year schedule
gains full momentum, and when the present
system "begins to crumble," in the words of
Harry Horton, hard-working chairman of the
reorganization committee.
