# Consult the Male
## 
### 
WHY are only the women being consulted
in the proposed change of late leaves?
After all, it takes two people to compose a
couple, and if only half of the combination is
being consulted about the change, a fair ar
rangement cannot possibly be brought about.
Men should have their say in this drastic pro
posal for several reasons:
Men always have to furnish the transporta
tion. If they have to work all Friday or Satur
day afternoon washing their cars, they want to
be sure to get some use out of them and not
have to tear home to get the girls in by 1:30.
Besides, the cars ought to be used to staying
out fairly late after all of these years.
Men always have to furnish the ideas for
dates. If they spend a few minutes dreaming
up a good idea for something to do in the night,
they don't like to have their plans broken into
by "I'll have to go home now; it's 1:14." The
girls can't deny that one hour makes a tot of
difference - sometimes.
Stanford men should like to take out Stanford
women. If this proposal goes through, Stanford
men will be forced to go to San Jose State, San
Mateo J.C., Cal, or even Mills for their dates.
With the scarcity of men—which may hit Stan
ford hard soon—women shouldn't discourage
the males by driving them off-campus.
Men enjoy comradeship. With that extra hour
taken away from them, Stanford men will not
be able to sharpen up their minds with keen,
intelligent conversations with the women of
Stanford.
But, on the other hand, men like sleep. This
is the key to the entire problem. An extra hour's
sleep does make a big difference, especially if
the women spend the last hour of the date
yawning and remarking, "It's not the company,
it's the hour."
So, obviously, there are two sides to the ques
tion, and its solution should be reached by a
mutual agreement of both sides.—John Horrall
