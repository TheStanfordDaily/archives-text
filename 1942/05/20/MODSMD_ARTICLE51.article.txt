### AMIE REICHERT 
£|OW many men we now have stationed in Ireland
is of course a secret that Uncle Sam isn't telling
his children at this time. The dispatches from London
yesterday said "thousands and thousands" of American
soldiers landed in the new contingent, and all reports
agreed that it was the largest section of the A.E.F.
thus far sent abroad.
It looks as though Great Britain is preparing to
open that long-sought second front. It has looked that
way for some time. The evidence is mounting all the
time. The new A.E.F. is more evidence.
Certainly the terrific bombarding which the A.E.F.
has been giving Germany and the French channel
ports for many months now could easily be a prelude
to invasion. It is well established that the British
have mastery of the air over these areas. This is
an absolute essential to invasion, as Herr Hitler well
knows. That was what stopped him in the fall of
1940. He couldn't get complete control of the sky
over the channel and despite London and Coventry,
the R.A.F. came back for more and gave out with
more.
Over the French coast these days and over the in«-
dustrial districts of Germany, the British bombers
range almost at will. They are free enough for day
light bombings. They have destroyed Rostok and many
munitions factories. Not once have the Germans come
over with the strength and the success they had in
1940.

INHERE is much evidence to lead one to expect the
second front quite soon now. True, we have been
saying that and hearing that for a long time. Let us
say it again at this time, however, and maybe we will
be right.
The weather is right for it. The British have had
lime to prepare, to rearm, to make up a good part at
least of what they have lost in the way of tanks and
guns in the Dunkirk, Crete, and Greece fiascoes.
Europe seethes with unrest. Norway is ripe for re
volt and despite the Gestapo guards in Laval's France
sabotage and counter-terrorism continues unabated.
And, the crowning points of all of course are the
aforementioned British air superiority and the pres
ence of the A.E.F. in Ireland.
Rumors last night came from Berne, Switzerland,
and Lisbon that Italy feared that a second front would
be opened at her expense. This is a possibility which
has been considered by the commentators more and
more the past few months.
They say that Italy is weak and war-weary and
ready to join with the Allies against Germany as she
did in the last war. Her greatest fear at the moment is
that the Nazi rapprochement with Laval's France will
push her plans for Tunis, Nice, Djibouti, etc., all out
of shape.
