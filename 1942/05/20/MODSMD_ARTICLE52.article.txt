### MIKE CHURCHILL 
WALK YOU . . .
r JHHAT Spaniard, Carlos Wednesday, is here again.
With him he has brought his first cousin, Hairless
Joe, of Dogpatch. Good old Hairless, always around in
a pinch.
Hairless is going to enforce Carless Wednesday. He
will hit over the head all the Patty Bouchards and
Micky Levys that he sees driving around in convert
ibles.
In the last war they had what amounted to carless
Sundays and it became the popular pastime to go out
and throw bricks at those brave and unpatriotic souls
who drove their autos on Sunday.
This is perhaps a little extreme to be used just yet
on the Farm, but we could lead off by using tomatoes
and eggs. Be careful not to throw things that are of
salvage value, such as lead pipes or wrought iron
gates.
Yell nasty things at people who insist upon driving
today. "Get a horse, you ass," or "I hope Women's
Council catches you, I really do," arc just suggestions.
Glaring stickers might help. "A Friend of the Axis
Is Driving This Car" comes to mind. Something really
sarcastic should be used.

beneath the Quad, a gruesome scene is en
acted daily from 9 to 5. If one takes the steps
leading down beneath the Physiology Building one
will come to a long narrow passage cold and damp and
smelling slightly of decayed flesh. This tunnel twists
and turns past piles of bleached bones and broken
treadmills.
Suddenly one bursts in upon a horrible sight glar
ingly lighted and revealing masked and hooded fig
ures in white scurrying about among treadmills, clocks,
dials, and various paraphernalia terribly reminiscent
of Inquisition days.
This is the Physical Fitness Laboratory. Here the
bodies of our young men are bent and broken. Here
men are made to toil 'til they drop. My word, but it
is grim.

VT'ESTER DAY'S column was written for the most part
by ex-editor Charlie Bull. The day-to-day writer
is seized often and without warning by violent spasms
of hay fever. It was at one of these times that Charlie
stepped in to fill his sneeze-shaken shoes.
