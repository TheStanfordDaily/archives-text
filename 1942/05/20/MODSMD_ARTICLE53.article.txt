A LOCAL WAR
(Editor's Note: The following comcs from the
University janitor recently mentioned in History,
1942.)
r | I HE EDITOR, SIR:
Your feature writer, Amie Reichert, claims to h;ivc
a bet with me on the current battle of the Russian-
German armies. Such is not the case; I have never
met the lady nor spoken to her. Perhaps I have missed
something, but I doubt it.
I am an old time professional soldier and in the
Queen's army. I have shed my blood on the sands of
Africa and have seen my comrades die, their brains
and their guts scattered on the plain.
I come of a race of warriors, the first Blakes enter
ing England with the great Norman leader Strongbow.
Our unbroken family runs back tb 1172 where in Gal
way, Ireland, we have landed gentry ever since. So
much for that. I am not a pro-German or a Nazi
lover; only a silly woman would talk as Amie does.
How all this matter came up was this way:
In a general talk on the war I made the remark
that, on the record of past performance, the German
army would go through the Russians like a dose of
salts. One of the pressmen said, "Want to bet on it?"
Well, I could not back down, but he did.
Then a young 200-pound husky, six feet or over,
who would look just lovely in a uniform, if he had
the guts, but who is more interested in summer school
than he is in his country, took the bet. To all con
cerned the bet is o(T. I was under the impression I
was betting with a gentleman. My mistake. *
Yours for victory which will only be won by blood
and guts. The latter the Stanford student seems to
lack.
