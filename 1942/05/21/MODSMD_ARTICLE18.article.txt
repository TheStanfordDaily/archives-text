# Tin Can Collection Planned Saturday
## 
### 
"Don't forget to have your boxes
of tin cans ready for collection by
Friday night," emphasizes Ed Por
ter, general chairman for this week
end's Tin Can Drive.

Trucks and men furnished by
Manuel Lozano of the Peninsula San
itary Company will make the rounds
of all living groups early Saturday
morning picking up the boxes of tin
cans which supply tin and steel vital
to the war effort.

Tin cans should lie washed, the
label removed, the two ends cut,
and the can smashed flat and placcd
in a box for collection. The boxes of
tin cans should be placed near the
gunny sack arrangement in the al
leys of most campus living groups.
