## Huntington Lake Is Selected for Course 
### HAP EVERETT 
Huntington Lake has definitely
been established as the location for
Stanford's proposed summer conser
vation school.
Edward Steen, originator of the
plan, said yesterday that the pro
posal is gaining momentum.
"Details of the program," Steen
said, "may be worked out by each
individual only through personal
interviews, because each person in
terested in the project has different
problems."
MEN BEHIND THE PLAN
Among the backers of the plan
are Professor Ira Wiggins of the
Natural History Museum, Dr. Law
rence Thomas of the School of Edu
cation, Mr. A. B. Williams of the
history department, Mrs. Inez
Richardson of the Hoover Library,
and Professor Edgar E. Robinson,
head of the history department.
The committee is urging personal
interviews for all those interested in
the proposed summer school. Inter
views may be arranged through Miss
Bailey, acting secretary, in Room
215.
POWER FIRMS INTERESTED
Mr. Steen said yesterday that the
forest service and several power
firms in the area had expressed in
terest in the plan. He said that the
curriculum drawn up for the quar
ter would emphasize natural history
and general outdoor activity.
"There are fine opportunities to
study hydroelectric engineering in
the Huntington Lake area," Steen
said, "and in addition there is a state
fish hatchcry and other opportuni
ties for the student of natural his
tory."
Huntington Lake is located in the
Sierra National Forest cast of
Fresno. The lake is popular with
San Joaquin Valley residents as a
recreation spot.
