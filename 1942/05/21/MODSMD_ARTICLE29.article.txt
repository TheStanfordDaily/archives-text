# Pendery Awarded Frosh Prize in Engineering
## Engineer's Place in War Effort Discussed by Speakers at Dinner 
### BILL DILLINGGER 
Don Pendery was named the
year's outstanding frosh engineer
last night as 150 engineers heard
three speakers outline the "Engi
neers Place in the War Effort," the
theme of the filth annual Engi
neers' Dinner.
Pendery, 31 plus 02 in the Bawl
out, was presented with the Tau
Beta Pi award, a slide rule, by
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur.
This is the first of a series of an
nual freshman awards planned for
the future by the engineers' honor
society.
ENGINEER'S WAR
"This is an engineer's war," was
l In verdict of both Major E. J.
Snares of the army and Lieut. Emil
Atcheson of the navy. The three
requirements for success in war are
Speech, Strength, and Surprise, and
all of them depend on mechaniza
tion, according to Major Soares,
Stanford professor of military sci
ence and tactics.
The easiest way to get an army
commission is through the R.0.T.C.,
according to Major Soares, but any
one in the army for three months
c an request to be sent to an officers'
training school, provided he can
pass an entrance examination. A col
lege graduate should have little
trouble passing this test, the Farm
military man believes.
VOLUNTEER CLASSIFICATION
There is also a Volunteer Officer
Candidate classification for men
with dependents, who are allowed to
try for commissions with the provi
sion that failure to pass will auto
matically return them to civilian
life.
In addition to the various V classi
fications, there is a "Special Com-

mission" which engineers can apply
for, according to tho lieutenant. It
lasts for the duration of the war,
and the commissions, ranging from
Ensign to Lieutenant - Commander,
are allotted on the basis of age, abil
ity, and eminence in civilian life.
These officers, corresponding to the
English "Wavy-Navy," will get the
same pay and have the saine oppor
tunities for advancement as the
regular line officers.
The presidents of Tau Beta Pi,
the Geology and Mining Society,
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, the American Society of
Civil Engineers, and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers
outlined the programs of their or
ganizations.

year's outstanding frosh engineer
last night as 150 engineers heard
three speakers outline the "Engi
neers Place in the War Effort," the
theme of the filth annual Engi
neers' Dinner.
Pendery, 31 plus 02 in the Bawl
out, was presented with the Tau
Beta Pi award, a slide rule, by
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur.
This is the first of a series of an
nual freshman awards planned for
the future by the engineers' honor
society.
ENGINEER'S WAR
"This is an engineer's war," was
l In verdict of both Major E. J.
Snares of the army and Lieut. Emil
Atcheson of the navy. The three
requirements for success in war are
Speech, Strength, and Surprise, and
all of them depend on mechaniza
tion, according to Major Soares,
Stanford professor of military sci
ence and tactics.
The easiest way to get an army
commission is through the R.0.T.C.,
according to Major Soares, but any
one in the army for three months
c an request to be sent to an officers'
training school, provided he can
pass an entrance examination. A col
lege graduate should have little
trouble passing this test, the Farm
military man believes.
VOLUNTEER CLASSIFICATION
There is also a Volunteer Officer
Candidate classification for men
with dependents, who are allowed to
try for commissions with the provi
sion that failure to pass will auto
matically return them to civilian
life.
In addition to the various V classi
fications, there is a "Special Com-

mission" which engineers can apply
for, according to tho lieutenant. It
lasts for the duration of the war,
and the commissions, ranging from
Ensign to Lieutenant - Commander,
are allotted on the basis of age, abil
ity, and eminence in civilian life.
These officers, corresponding to the
English "Wavy-Navy," will get the
same pay and have the saine oppor
tunities for advancement as the
regular line officers.
The presidents of Tau Beta Pi,
the Geology and Mining Society,
the American Institute of Electrical
Engineers, the American Society of
Civil Engineers, and the American
Society of Mechanical Engineers
outlined the programs of their or
ganizations.
