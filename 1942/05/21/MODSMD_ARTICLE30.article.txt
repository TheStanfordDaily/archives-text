WASHINGTON, May 20 (UP).â€”
Increased individual income surtax
es ranging from 12 per cent on the
first $2,000 to 81 per cent on taxable
earnings exceeding $200,000, were
written into the pending $8,700,000,-
000 war revenue bill today by the
House Ways and Means Committee.
The rates were less drastic than
those proposed by the Treasury and
they constituted indirect rejection by
the committee of President Roose
velt's request that it limit net in
comes of individuals to $25,000 an
nually for the duration.

Chairman George Wingfield of the
Nevada Racing Commission has de
clared there would be no horse race
meeting here for the duration.
