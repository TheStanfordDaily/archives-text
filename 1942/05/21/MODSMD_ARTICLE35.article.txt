"The Japanese taught Hitler and
Mussolini till they know about ag
gression," declared Franklin C.
Fettc, for many years a merchant j
and exporter in Peking, before the j
12:10 Club yesterday noon in the \
Nitery.
Speaking before a capacity crowd j
Mr. Fette continued, "We would not !
have had the conquests of Ethiopia, j
Austria, and Czechoslovakia if the
League of Nations had made Japan
hold to the treaties she has made.
She should have been stopped back
in 1931."
Mr. Fette went on to say that
there was much antagonism between
the Japanese army and navy.
Illustrating this, he told of an inci
dent in Shanghai when the Japanese
flagship in the Yellow River was
being bombed by Chinese flyers.
Two Japanese majors in the Ameri
can embassy at the time remarked
that they hoped the ship would be i
sunk.
The army probably would have '
been content with a quick conquest j
of North China as they had when
they conquered Manchuria, but the
navy spread the war down into
South China, which led to the con
tinued resistance of the Chinese.
Mr. Fette concluded that Chank
Kai-shek declared that in two years
the Chinese would be producing j
I enough war materials to be inde- |
) pendent of the Burma Road.
