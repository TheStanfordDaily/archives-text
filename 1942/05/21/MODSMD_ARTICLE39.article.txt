softhall semi-finals, while the Legal Eagles walked over Encina lE, 2K-4.
The Zetes and Legal Eagles will meet Friday at 4 p.m. in the linal game.
The Zete-Breaker game was tight until the fourth inning. Sid Hayes

for the Zetes and Sherm Selix for
Breakers battled all afternoon in a
pitching duel that was slightly in
Hayes' favor. Hayes struck out 7
men and allowed one hit, while
Selix struck out 5 and allowed 4
hils.
The Zetes brought in a man by a
w:ilk in the first inning to take the
loud. It was tight from then until
the fourth when AI Wool for Break
ers (lied out to Ollie Hamlin, and
Selix flied out to Bud Madden to
retire the .side.
FIRST HIT IN 4TII
Then Scott Dudley opened the
second half of the fourth by taking
first in the first hit of the game. Jack
Dilz followed with a hit that de
served first but landed him on sec
ond by way of an error bringing in
Dudley. Sandy Tatum hit a three

ing the score 3-0. Mike Kresge,
Breaker short-stop, caught a fly
over second by Jack Dana to bring
the rally to an end.
The first hit off Hayes came in the
fifth by Irvile Hellman on a tly
which put him on first.
SOLID BLOW
The squarest hit of the day was a
long fly into the center-field by Ham
lin and taken by Wool.
The Zete.s made no errors and gave
Hayes excellent support. While
Hayes was a little slower than Selix,
it was the fine support that made
the difference along with the fact
that three of Breakers' first-string
men were missing.
In the Legal Eagles-Encina IE
game Harris Robinson starred by
hitting a home run, a double, and 3
singles. Rex Shoop, as the lawyers'
pitcher, threw his best ball of the
season, and may give Hayes some
thing of the battle which Selix did
when the two teams meet Friday.
BIG RALLY
The Legal Eagles opened the game
with a rally that swept the Encina
ites off their feet and put them be
hind 8 runs. The frosh held it down
until the fifth when the lawyers
again rolled in 7 runs, and then in
the seventh they rallied again knock
ing in 7 mo.e.
Warren Gardner also starred for
the Eagles with a double play. The
Encina representatives played good
ball for the practice they have had,
but they were definitely outclassed.
Mural managers are urged to turn
in entry lists for the mural relays
which will be held Monday, Tues
day. and Wednesday of next week
on Angel I Field, according to Red
Holman, intramural manager.
