## Tennis Men Receive Gold Balls; Awards Voted Down 
### 
In response to an editorial in The
Daily, Alpha Delta Sigma, national
advertising fraternity, is going ahead
with plans to advertise the honor
code.
Dan Lewis, president of the or
ganization, received Ex Committee's
approval Tuesday night for a long
range drive. Lewis pointed out that
there is a complete turn-over here
every four years and that many peo
ple do not even know what the
honor code is. He said a campaign
in a serious vein would bring re
sults.
Ex Committee also discussed pos
sible successors to Barbara Sadler as
head of the Sunday movie series, but
postponed final action.
MEMORIAL APPROVED
The Committee approved an Alpha
Delt golf trophy to be established in
memory of Bob Rucker, golfer and
skier killed last winter on Mt. Spo
kane. The perpetual trophy will go
to the winner of the school golf tour
nament each year, while a second
cup will be kept in the Alpha Delt
house.
Dick Driscoll's proposal that Block
S sweaters and cards be awarded to
George JedenofT, Al Wool, and Ted
Cole for four years of exceptional
work in rugby was killed by the
committee.
GOLD BALLS OKAYED
The by-law concerning awards for
conference winners was amended so
that this year s tennis team could be
awarded gold tennis balls. There is
no regular coast conference in ten
nis, but the team won the southern
division and Ex Committee made a
special concession in this case.
