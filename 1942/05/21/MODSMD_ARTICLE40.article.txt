# Nova to Fight For Navy Fund
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 20 (UP) â€”
Lou Nova, the reformed Yogi, risks
his fistic future against Lee Savold
of Dos Moines tomorrow night in a
10-round battle expected to en
rich the Navy Relief Fund by about
$20,000.
Tonight the odds were 2 to 1 lhat
Nova, launching a comeback, won't
be sorry ho look the risk.
MUCH AT STAKE
Savold also will have much at
stake in a fight which promises to
bring the winner within reach of a
September crack at Joe Louis'
heavyweight title. Next to Louis
himself, Savold has been just about
the hottest article in the heavy
weight ranks the past year or so.
In that span he has racked up 17
victories.
But the only real stake that counts
in this fight is something that trans
cends the personal ambition of any
boxer. It is the future of the fami
lies of those men who fought and
died on Wake Island, on Bataan and
on Corregidor, of those bluejackets
and Marines who are fighting free
dom's cause upon the seven seas.
CARE FOR WARRIORS
Approximately 50 per cent of gate
receipts will go to the* Navy Relief
Society to help care for the families
of Uncle Sam's sea warriors.
Boomtown Washington, with a
chance to do its bit, is expected to
buy up about 15,000 seats ranging in
price from $2.50 to $10 apiece.

War stamps and bonds arc the
quickest way you can help yourself
and your country.
