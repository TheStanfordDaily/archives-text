# Stanford, Bears Renew Crew Rivalry in 2000-Meter Battle
## 
### 
Stanford and California revive (he thrilling crew sport after a 22-year
interval Saturday when the blue-gold and red-white colors flash over a
2000-meter course at Redwood City.
Eight-man crews will ply their sleek shells over the bay waters off the
Redwood City Yacht Harbor starting at II a.m. The finish line can be

seen from the harbor docks.
The Bears, coached by the veteran
crewman Ky Ebright, will present a
team including several members of
the boat that lost to Washington a
month ago at Seattle. The remain
der of the crew have been gradu
ated, but those wi'io are filling in
give Cal a strong boat, according to
Ebright.
The Redskins will no doubt be
very underdoggish as this is their
first test this season. Looking back
on the form, however, Stanford
holds 10 victories over the Bears as
against five defeats.

As last year, the Indians' '42 shell
has no official backing from the !
University. The oarsmen are strictly |
on their own and will row in a shell j
California brought back from Wash
ington, a gift from the Huskies.
The Red boat will probably in- !
elude most of the remaining men !
from last year: Walt Drake, Lory j
Bailard, Roger Boas, Bob Porter, |
Burl Cobb, and Bud Clary.
The California race is the only one I
arranged at present, but there are j
hope that more will come later.
