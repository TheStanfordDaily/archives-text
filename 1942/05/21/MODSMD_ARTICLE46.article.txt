# '43 Polo Team Best in Years, States Coach
## 
### 
"I've been here five years and
this is the best team I've seen," says
Coach Harvey Rothschild in com
menting on the prospects for next
year's water polo team.
Five first stringers back from last
year, a group of promising freshman,
and a few capable transfers give
Rothschild what he terms "two full
squads, both faster than any team
we've had for several years."
SIX COMING BACK
Although Frank Mitchell, Bob
Breckner, Fred Manwaring, and Ed
Smith will be missed next year,
Rothschild has Hadley Bacon, Grant
Culley, Don Smith, Bill Mapel, Bob
Jones, and Pete Lee from the 1941
outfit, which wound up in a second
place tie in the conference.
Culley was named to an all-confer
ence forward spot, and Jones was
given second team recognition. Lee,
the most under-rated man on the
team, was one of the top goalies on
the coast, while Baeon was a con
sistent top performer all year.
FRESHMAN STARS
Four hotshots from the freshman
team —A1 Weeden, Dick Narver,
Phil Lee, and Bob Mapel—will make
the regular varsity men step next
season, Rothschild added.
In addition, Emmett Cashin. ace
swimmer transfer from University
of San Francisco, will play at sprint.
He is one of the fastest swimmers in
the country today and will be a val
uable addition to the team.
MORE CONTENDERS
Other strong contenders are Paul
Egeler, Pete Hatch, Will Bell, and
Jack Carpenter.
A newer, more individual type of
play will be stressed by Rothschild.
Except for the goal guard, there
will be no set positions, but simply
a backfield and forwards. Each man
will work more on his own initia
tive much as it is in basketball,
Rothschild concluded.
