# Wanted: College Nurses

### 
TODAY the need for responsible, well-quali
fied women in nursing is urgent.
A special appeal to college women interested
in joining the ranks of the many additional
nurses needed to help win the war and to aid in
the reconstruction work following has recently
been made by Surgeon General Thomas Parran
of the U.S. Public Health Service.
His statement, in part, follows:
"Nursing is one of the most challenging pro
fessions open to young women today. In no
other professional school does the student begin
to contribute so early to the national need as
does the student nurse. After a few months of
preclinical training, she begins actually to care
for the sick and thus helps to fill the place of
the graduate nurse who has been called to mili
tary service.
"Experience during the last war and during
the past twenty years has shown that college
women who have entered nursing are capable
of more rapid progress than are other groups
of women in nursing."
College women interested in entering the
nursing profession are asked to write to the
Nursing Information Bureau, 1790 Broadway,
New York City, to the State Nursing Council on
National Defense in California, or to the United
States Public Health Service, Washington, D.C.
