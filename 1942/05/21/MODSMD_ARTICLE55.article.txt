HITLER'S HOT, TOO
JT IS HOT in Hitler's Europe today, too, and Yugo
slavia s General Draja Mikhailovich is making things
hotter for Der Fuehrer all the time.
It is spring in the Bosnian mountains these days.
They say the sky is pure and clear there and the days
are long. And there is much fighting.
The Chetniks whom Mihailovitch commands are
above all the people of the anti-Nazi world who will
not be conquered. Hitler has been telling them all along
that they are through, but apparently they don't un
derstand the language of the New Order.
Hitler's Nazis have occupied their country and ter
rorized their people. 500,000 German, Italian and Hun
garian troops have executed 465,000 Serbs all in the
name of the New Order and Pax Germaniea.
Still the Nazi Gauleiters of Yugoslavia don't sleep
well at night, and even Herr Hitler tears his hair about
it. And the cause of all this trouble is Mihailovitch
and his 200,000 Serbian guerillas. They continue to re
sist.
Last week Hitler sent fresh troops into the Bosnian
mountains to augment the force already there. It ap
pears now that Mihailovitch has organized his loosely
knit outfit to meet the increased strength the Germans
have been forced to throw against them. Already they
were outnumbered two and a half to one, but evi
dently two and a half Nazis isn't enough to down a
good Serb. Now Hitler has increased this ratio, and
still his men have not fared much better.
Within the last five days, the Chetniks have suc
cessfully made five attacks on the Axis forces, and it
begins to look as though Mihailovitch is organizing
his own version of a spring offensive.
The Italian News Agency, Stefani, reports that three
Italian functionaries traveling through Occupied Yugo
slavia have been captured and executed by rebel
bands within the last few days.
The terrorism and counter-terrorism continues. As
long as Hitler is not winning, he is losing. And in
Yugoslavia today he is losing and has been losing all
along.

JYJY APOLOGIES to Mr. Blake for having written so
obscure a column that he could possibly miscon
strue it the way he did. I did not name him nor did I
make the implications he suggestsâ€”that he is a "pro-
German" or a "Nazi-lover." I merely said that "a
janitor in the University wanted to bet that the Ger
mans would be in Moscow by the Fourth of July."
This is not a question of patriotism, merely an ob
jective difference of opinion. Being optimistic about
the length of time it will take to beat the Nazis is not
necessarily patriotic, any more than being pessimistic
is treason.
