HOWS YOUR HEMO, GLOBIN?
6CJT ISN'T the heat, it's the humidity." With this re
assuring statement ringing in my ears I solemnly
sit here and parboil.
It would certainly be timely to tear into Excom for
their reorganization program as announced yesterday.
But it is too sticky to be properly vitriolic. We will
have to let the matter sit for a while, merely stating
that the whole thing has about as much practical value
and is about as timely as a Norman Bel Geddes Fu
turama. Even that outburst has tired me out.

heat-wave comes at the wrong time all the way
round. There are just six more issues of this vol
ume of The Daily. Discounting the last day, which is
more or less stereotyped and concerns itself with the
wishing of fond farewells, I have only five chances to
write my Epic.
Every Bull Sessioner has written an Epic and so it
behooves me to give out with one very soon. Keep your
eyes and ears open, and be on your toes, for the time
draws nigh and as yet there has been no Epic.
The year's people and things are starting their
slide. Daily elections are imminent as this volume
wanes. The last Chappie of the year has gone to press
and next years crowd have been announced.
Axe Society has announced their new roster for
next year as have Cardinals. Debate Council has re
leased its new appointments. Every second news col
umn in The Daily concerns the turnover from this year
to next.
Graduation is all arranged for and this morning the
Phi Bete lists are published. There is only one thing
left to do for the poor seniorsâ€”write finals, and pass
'em.
What a dreadful way to leave Stanford. Last quar
ter finals should be somehow written during the first
week of spring quarter. The rest of the time could
then be spent doing the thousand and one things that
always get postponed.
Of course there is the other alternative of dispens
ing with last quarter examinations altogether. Just the
thought of this makes me intoxicated. Well, I can
dream, can't I?

IN CLOSING let me say that Daily Want Ads always
bring results.
