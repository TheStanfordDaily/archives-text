# CAMPUS OPINION
## LIGHTS IN ThE LIBE 
### 
r pHE EDITOR, SIR:
It occurred to me as I was reading in the Main
Library that the lighting was most appalling, and I
pondered over how the problem could be solved. The
lights in the new Engineering Library are what are
needed or some on that general order.
It has been previously stated that relighting would
cost around $10,000. I noticed in The Daily several
weeks ago that $40,000 is going to be spent on the
Encina lobby. Now I put this query to you. Wouldn't
$150,000 be sufficient? That would leave $10,000 which
could be applied to new lighting in (he Library which
I believe is much more urgent than renovating Encina.
Of course, this is just one man's opinion. Perhaps
the rest of you don't mind the lighting, but I have no
ticed numerous squinters every night, every day of
the week (except Saturday and Sunday).
I don't know if materials would even be available
for such an undertaking or whether the administration
would even consider such a proposal, but I do realize
that proper lighting in such a frequently visited spot as
our Main Library is most necessary. Granted Encina
lobby needs repair, but weighing the two needs care
fully, I cannot help feeling the relighting of the Libe
is more important. This is merely an onlooker's view
point; you can take it or leave it.

Owners of cars must remember that bicycles
are moving at a very slow rate; this fact must be
taken into consideration when approaching a
rider.
After all, the bicycle is the coming mode of
transportation and we must protect our cyclists.
