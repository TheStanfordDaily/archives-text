# Typhoid Bacteria Resist Drug Diet
## 
### 
In a recent study made by Wind
sor C. Cutting and G. B. Robson of
the Stanford School of Medicine,
typhoid bacilli were subjected to a
diet of drugs, which have succeeded
in killing off or warding off other
potentially death - dealing bacteria,
but the typhoid bacteria continued
to thrive.

Testing the alleged efficiency of
medicinal treatment of typhoid car
riers, Drs. Cutting and Robson
found that neither four powerful
sulfa compounds nor four other
drugs usually lethal to bacteria
would cure any of the six typhoid
carriers who took the drug. Some
of these drugs were previously rec
ommended as curing typhoid car
riers, possibly because the cases may
not have been followed long enough
after treatment to discover a late re
lapse, say the doctors.

The successful treatment of ty
phoid carriers is greatly desired, be
cause the carriers are denied occu
pations involving food handling and
the care of children. They are also
kept under surveillance by health
departments and live under the con
stant fear of causing the infection of
others.
