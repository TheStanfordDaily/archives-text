# Stanford Students to Benefit From OPA's Price Ceiling Bill
## 
### 
Stanfordites with relatively "fixed incomes" should benefit more than
the average person from the Oflicc of Price Administration's over-all ceil
ing order on prices. This, at least, is the conclusion reached by Jay
Richter reporting from Washington, D.C., for the Associated College Press.
The inflationary spiral, it seems, has sent prices up 19 per cent from

what they were last year. This
means that, though people are mak
ing more money, and more money is
in circulation, there are fewer goods
for civilian consumption in circula
tion. Which accounts for the rise of
prices in all lines.
COLLEGE INCOMES
OPA's Leon Henderson, Richter
points out, has alleviated this trend
by merely setting price ceilings on a
large number of products for civil
ian use. College men, whose in
comes, unlike wages, do not follow
the rising trend, come in here. The
ceiling on retail goods became ef
fective Monday while the ceiling on
services becomes effective July 1,
thus giving Farm men and women
with not so much purchasing power
as formerly an even "break" on the
open market.
It must be remembered, however,
(hat this applies only to goods and
services which are "commodities."
The few exceptions from price con
trol are perishable foods such as
butter and cheese, poultry and eggs,
flour, mutton, lamb, fresh fruits and
vegetables, dried prunes and dry
beans, nuts, and seafood and game.
CIGARETTES INCLUDED
But included in the controlled cat
egories are room and board in all
war-rental areas, both men's and
women's clothing, laundry, dry
cleaning, shoe repairing, and thou
sands of "processed commodities"
such as cigarettes, cosmetics, tooth
paste, and aspirin. Such ceilings,
however, do not mean that price dif
ferences between stores will be wiped
out. If a merchant undersold his
competitors last March, the time at
which ceiling "highs" were set, he
may still do so.

Merchants must also post signs
informing customers of maximum
legal prices and give purchasers
sales slips if sales slips are asked
for.

Items such as restaurant meals,
movies and entertainment, carfare,
and beauty and barber shop services
are not, however, controlled.

points out, has alleviated this trend
by merely setting price ceilings on a
large number of products for civil
ian use. College men, whose in
comes, unlike wages, do not follow
the rising trend, come in here. The
ceiling on retail goods became ef
fective Monday while the ceiling on
services becomes effective July 1,
thus giving Farm men and women
with not so much purchasing power
as formerly an even "break" on the
open market.
It must be remembered, however,
(hat this applies only to goods and
services which are "commodities."
The few exceptions from price con
trol are perishable foods such as
butter and cheese, poultry and eggs,
flour, mutton, lamb, fresh fruits and
vegetables, dried prunes and dry
beans, nuts, and seafood and game.
CIGARETTES INCLUDED

egories are room and board in all
war-rental areas, both men's and
women's clothing, laundry, dry
cleaning, shoe repairing, and thou
sands of "processed commodities"
such as cigarettes, cosmetics, tooth
paste, and aspirin. Such ceilings,
however, do not mean that price dif
ferences between stores will be wiped
out. If a merchant undersold his
competitors last March, the time at
which ceiling "highs" were set, he
may still do so.

Merchants must also post signs
informing customers of maximum
legal prices and give purchasers
sales slips if sales slips are asked
for.

Items such as restaurant meals,
movies and entertainment, carfare,
and beauty and barber shop services
are not, however, controlled.
Stanfordites with relatively "fixed incomes" should benefit more than
the average person from the Oflicc of Price Administration's over-all ceil
ing order on prices. This, at least, is the conclusion reached by Jay
Richter reporting from Washington, D.C., for the Associated College Press.
The inflationary spiral, it seems, has sent prices up 19 per cent from

what they were last year. This
means that, though people are mak
ing more money, and more money is
in circulation, there are fewer goods
for civilian consumption in circula
tion. Which accounts for the rise of
prices in all lines.
