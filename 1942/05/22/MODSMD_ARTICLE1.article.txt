# Card Crew Faces Bears Tomorrow at Redwood In First Race Since 1920
## Cal Shows Better Practice Times Than Stanford in Pre-Race Trials; Indians Timed at Seven Minutes 
### BILL HORNBY 
Racing shells of Stanford and California meet tomorrow morning at 11
011 bay waters off Redwood City Yacht Harhor in a race that is both a
tribute and a prophesy.
It's a tribute to the efforts of Bud Clary and the group of Stanford
oarsmen whom he has guided "on their own" toward a revival of crew

here. The clash brings Cal and Card
oarsmen together for the first time
since 1920, and it returns Stanford
to "bigtime" status in a sport in
which it was a dominating factor
between 1907 and 1920.
This race may also prophesy that
the Farm will return to the same
crew activity which habitually de
feated Cal in those years. The work
of the Stanford enthusiasts has been
recognized by A1 Ulbrickson of
Washington and Ky Ebright of Cali
fornia as worthy of the full support
of coast crew fans, especially during
wartime when Pacific Coast compe
tition must replace the longer jaunts
to meet eastern crews.

Ky Ebright of California has
picked the best of his available mate
rial to give the Stanford group its
big race. From students living near
Berkeley or those waiting for sum
mer session the Bear mentor has se
lected the line-up.
The group is headlined by regular
Cal Coxswain Dunny Woodbury,
who guided the Blue and Goid
against the Huskies in their northern
match in early April. Backing up
"Woodie" is Put Livermore at stroke,
the only other Cal varsity veteran on
the list. Filling out the shell are
two other varsity-trained rowers,
Nicol in number six spot, and num
ber seven rower, Marsh. Gardipee
at bow, Doyle, number two, Jones,
number three, Greathouse, number
four, and Holyoake, number five, arc
all rowers from Cal's third and
fourth collections.
Although Stanford Coach Nemo
Pederson, former Cal rower who
guides the local squad in daily work
outs, will not announce his official
line-up until the start tomorrow, the
Farm shell should be filled some
thing like this.
LINE-UP
Coxswain Walt Drake, a junior,
will handle the tiller for the second
straight year, and Clary, junior, will
stroke the Cards. Two other Farm
veterans, Bob Porter at number
seven and Rog Boas at number six.
will complete the stern layout, giv
ing the less experienced bow rowers
some human models for timing.
On clown the line, Freshman Orjin
Harter will use his 6 feet 4 inches at
number five, followed by Herb
Goodman, sophomore, at number
four, Laurie Baillard, junior, at
three, Senior Berl Cobb at two, and
another frosh, Cameron Snell, in the
bow.
Jerry Grunewald, formerly of the
Cal frosh crew, is in the running for
the bow spot, and Bill Cham
berlain and Dick Bullis may start at
numbers two and four, respectively.
Wednesday, against a strong head
wind, the Stanfords were just over
seven minutes on the 2,000 meter
(about one and a quarter miles)
course. Cal has reported its best
time to be slightly under the seven
minute mark.

here. The clash brings Cal and Card
oarsmen together for the first time
since 1920, and it returns Stanford
to "bigtime" status in a sport in
which it was a dominating factor
between 1907 and 1920.
This race may also prophesy that
the Farm will return to the same
crew activity which habitually de
feated Cal in those years. The work
of the Stanford enthusiasts has been
recognized by A1 Ulbrickson of
Washington and Ky Ebright of Cali
fornia as worthy of the full support
of coast crew fans, especially during
wartime when Pacific Coast compe
tition must replace the longer jaunts
to meet eastern crews.

Ky Ebright of California has
picked the best of his available mate
rial to give the Stanford group its
big race. From students living near
Berkeley or those waiting for sum
mer session the Bear mentor has se
lected the line-up.
The group is headlined by regular
Cal Coxswain Dunny Woodbury,
who guided the Blue and Goid
against the Huskies in their northern
match in early April. Backing up
"Woodie" is Put Livermore at stroke,
the only other Cal varsity veteran on
the list. Filling out the shell are
two other varsity-trained rowers,
Nicol in number six spot, and num
ber seven rower, Marsh. Gardipee
at bow, Doyle, number two, Jones,
number three, Greathouse, number
four, and Holyoake, number five, arc
all rowers from Cal's third and
fourth collections.
Although Stanford Coach Nemo
Pederson, former Cal rower who
guides the local squad in daily work
outs, will not announce his official
line-up until the start tomorrow, the
Farm shell should be filled some
thing like this.

ing the less experienced bow rowers
some human models for timing.
On clown the line, Freshman Orjin

Jerry Grunewald, formerly of the

Wednesday, against a strong head
