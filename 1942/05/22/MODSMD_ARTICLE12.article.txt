# FITNESS TESTS ADDED TO MURALS

A worn-out figure dragged him
self up the steps from the basement
of the Biology Building after an
hour workout in the Exercise Lab
oratory in the second week of a
physical fitness tests being conducted
by Dr. Craig Taylor in conjunction
with the intramural program. *
Tests developed in the Exercise
Laboratory are to be used by civil
aeronautics and in naval aviation,
and will involve 250 Farm men by
the end of the quarter.
The tests are being conducted
under supervision of Dr. Taylor, as
sisted by Charles Winterburn, phys
ical education graduate, and Bob
Morris, psychology graduate. The
work is considered vital to national
defense, consequently admittance to
the lab itself is restricted to students
who are scheduled for a test.
SIX-MAN TEAMS
The tests were made a part of
the intramural program two weeks
ago. Six names arc being chosen at
random from the roster of each
men's campus organization and these
men will form that organization's
team.
To date 35 men have been put
through the tests, which contrast the
physical ability of each man on a
standard basis.
Winterburn is conducting a short
test, a portable outfit developed by
Dr. Taylor, while Morris is con
ducting treadmill tests. The two
tests will be contrasted to find the
reliability of judging fitness by
means of short tests rather than by
longer, time-consuming tests.
MURAL SCORES TO BENEFIT
The portable equipment, devised
by Dr. Taylor, can be used in meas
uring the effect of certain physical
stresses. Scores made by each con
testant will go to the credit of his
organization's total mural score.
Dr. Taylor said that it is urgent
that these tests be completed by the
end of the quarter, and urges stu
dents scheduled for tests to report
on time.
