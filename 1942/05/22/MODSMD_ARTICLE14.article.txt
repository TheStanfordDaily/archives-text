# Diploma Dime Total Hits $69
## 
### 
Dimes for Diplomas netted a total
yesterday of $69.39 with the Phi
Sigma Kappa house contributing
100 per cent and Delta Chi giving
"all-out" co-operation for the fourth
consecutive week. The Tri-Delts
came in close behind with 859 do
nating.
The money contributed will be
used for scholarships after the war
for Stanford boys in the service
who may wish to complete their edu
cation.
The requirements for receiving a
scholarship arc: The recipient must
have served six months in the serv
ice, must be in need of the help,
and must have previously proved a
satisfactory student.
The money will be held in govern
ment bonds, payable at any time,
with interest. The two-fold purpose
will be accomplished of helping
finance the nation to win the war,
and the students to win the peace.
