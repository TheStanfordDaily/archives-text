# Chi Psis Take All-U Sing Fest
## 
### 
Singing their way to victory in
the All-University Sing last night
were the Chi Psis, Casa Granada,
and the first-year medical students.
An audience of 2.000 heard 2\\
groups perform on the grassy stage
of the Frost Amphitheater.
A sing-off was necessary in the
women's division between Casa Gra
nada, Casa Naranja, and Delta
Gamma before the judges could
elect a winner. Pi Thornton pre
sented trophies to Charlotte Cecil,
representing Granada, Marion Scott,
director of the Chi Psis, and Bob
Keating, of the first-year medical
students.
Charlie Bulotti disproved his
contention that he was not a peren
nial campus funnyman by keeping
the proceedings moving smoothly
and wittily. He had little opportu
nity to lead community singing,
however, as the audience preferred
special numbers by the combined
forces of the medical school.
The Men's Faculty Glee Club
made its first public appearance,
clad in impressive academic robes
and mortar boards and even got
called back for a second recitation
