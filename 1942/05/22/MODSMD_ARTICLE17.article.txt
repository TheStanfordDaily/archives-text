MOSCOW, Friday, May 22 (UP).â€”
Unbroken gains by Hod army forces
storming through the inner ring of
German defenses within gunshot of
Kharkov were announced today in a
communique which said that an en

tanks, infantry and planes, laying
open the outer gates of the strategic
industrial city.

Kharkov under artillery bombard
ment while mop-up battalions en
circled and cleaned out German
pockets in the shattered primary
defense line.
NAZIS DECIMATED

to have carried the Russian shock
troops into the suburban fields and
unfortified villages of the inner de
fenses, through which they chased

"Our troops fighting toward Khar
kov continued offensive battles," the
