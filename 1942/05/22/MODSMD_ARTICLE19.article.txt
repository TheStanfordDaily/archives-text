# Turkish Student Thinks Nazis Have Enough Oil for Duration
## 
### BILL STEIF 
It is merely wishful thinking to
believe that the Nazi war machine
lias not ..iillicierit oil and th;it it will
collapse because of a lack of oil.
Ibis, at least, is the opinion of Tev
fik Sadullah, who should know,
since he is gelling bis master's de
gree in |H'lr<;leum engineering next
month.
lioiTi in Istanbul, Tevfik Sadullali
w; educated in 'lurkish .schools up
to ri I Mid then went to a French
coll- ;c in Istanbul for two years.
At the end of this time he won one
of a number of competitive schol
ars) ii; is to foreign colleges which
the 'lurki.'ih government was offer
ing and thus, in the fall of 19.'5G, ar
rived mi the Stanford campus.

A uy rate, Sadullah came to the
Fai ii! immediately plungwd into his
rn »iiK ( i inu studies and went out
foi Ii old love, soccer. He had, as
ii' ■ .1, . "been playing soccer since
he l.,id been about four years old."

Fa. .ii athletics was a block S after
tin years of varsity competition
and a position as assistant soccer

h it back to the oil question.
S idullah says that "the Germans
havi . in the first place, excellent
synlli' tic gasoline capacity for which
iM. 'h Nazi machinery is geared."

tion despite persistent rumors that
11•» I umanian wells are drying vip,
i: ill far ahead of the oil produc
tion of Iraq, toward which the Na
zi:. supposed to be turning en
vi< eyes. The Rumanian produc
tion, according to Sadullah, is 56
mil I ion barrels a year, while that of
Iraq i. only 31 million barrels a year.
JAl'rj lIAVK OIL
"The Japs," says Sadullah, "have
gotten plenty of oil in their drive
toward Australia." In fact, believes
dark, curly-headed Sadullah, the
Japs could probably stop fighting
right now and be in a very com
fortable spot- The only trouble with
this, it seems, is that they must keep
fighting to hold on to what they
have.
Russia, states Sadullah, is the sec
ond largest oil-producing nation in
the world, but the Russians still are
having technical difficulties in turn
ing crude oil into sufficient amounts
of gasoline. Here Sadullah suggested
that "it. would be a good idea for
the United States to send oil tech
nicians to the USSR in order to up
the percentage of gasoline which the
Soviet gets from its crude oil." He
pointed out that the Russians are

turning only 11 per cent of their
crude oil into gasoline now, while
the Russians, when collaborating
with the Germans in 1939 and 1940.
had planned to import Nazi tech
nicians who would raise this per
centage to 20 per cent in the older
Red factories and 42 to 45 per cent
in the new refineries.
AMERICAN OIL
As for American oil production,
Sadullah says that this hemisphere
is far and away the richest in the
world. Not only does the United
States produce over one million, one
hundred thousand barrels of oil a
year—well over 50 per cent of the
world's oil production — but there
are also, according to Sadullah, rich
and comparatively unexploited oil
deposits in South America. In fact,
he pointed out, Venezuela, producing

185 thousand barrels of oil a year,
is the third largest oil-producer in
the world today.
The only trouble with the Ameri
can situation, says Sadullah, is that
the United States has difllculty in
transporting its oil to distant fronts.
About his native land, Sadullah
states that Turkey will oppose all
nations which attempt to infringe
upon the liberty which the Turks
wrought in the second decade of this
century from the decadent Ottoman
Empire. And Sadullah says the
Turks are tough—which comes from
one who knows.
The average temperature at the
North Pole ranges from minus 1.0 C.
in July to minus 41.0 C. in January
with a yearly average of minus
22.7 C.
