WASHINGTON, May 21 (UP).—
Government officials who want to
run American foreign affairs were
set straight today by President Roo
sevelt, who re-emphasized the au
thority of Secretary of State Cordell
Hull over foreign policy and rela
tions with other nations-
The chief executive made a formal
statement clarifying the relationship
between the State Department and
the Board of Economic Warfare
headed by Vice-President Henry A.
Wallace.
Mr. Roosevelt defined their "pri
mary" responsibilities this way:
Hull—"The formulation and con
duct of our foreign policy and our
relations with foreign nations."
BEW—"Matters of business judg
ment concerned with providing for
the production and procurement of
materials to be imported into this
country for the war effort, including
civilian supply."
The President said that negotia
tions with foreign governments will
be handled by the State Department
and the appropriate chief of the dip
lomatic mission to the country in
volved. American diplomats con
ducting such negotiations, however,
will "respect the position of the
board's representative in matters of
technical and business judgment."
