WASHINGTON, May 21 (UP). â€”
Steve Vasilakos, whose peanut
stand outside President Roosevelt's
official residence is well known to
Washingtonians and capitol visitors,
was one up on the chief executive
today at their draft board. After
shuffling registration cards of men
in the 45-65 age group, the board
assigned Steve No. U-l and gave
Mr. Roosevelt U-2.
