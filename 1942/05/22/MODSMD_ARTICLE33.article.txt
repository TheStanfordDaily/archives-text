# Treasury Asks Deduction Tax
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 21 (UP).—
The Treasury today formally asked
Congress to enact a withholding tax
under which 10 per cent of a per
son's income would be deducted each
payday and applied to the sharply
increased tax bill he will pay on his
1942 earnings.
The levy would take effect as soon
as the pending $8,700,000 000 revenue
bill becomes law, thus enabling the
Treasury to benefit immediately by
collections on 1942 returns.
It would mean that many income
tax payers would pay two levies this
year—the one applying to 1941 in
come, collectable this year, and the
other applying to 1942 income, nor
mally not collectable until 1943.
The pioposal, marking a new de
parture in the American tax system,
was recommended to the House
Ways and Means Committee by
Treasury tax expert Randolph Paul,
the committee has been debating a
withholding tax and seems disposed
to approve it-
Give your blood to save a life. Be
