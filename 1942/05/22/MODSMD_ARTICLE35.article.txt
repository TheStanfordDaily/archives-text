If Condi Eddie Twiggs' Stanford golf team goes to
South Bend for the 45th annual National Collegiate
Athletic Association golf championships, the Indians
will he far and away the favorites to come home with
the team title in their possession.
If they do come through, it will he the fourth time

in five years and the 2nd
year that Twiggs' boys have walked
off with the Maxwell trophy.
In addition, any member of the
Stanford team, and especially Bud
Brownell and Frank McCann, will j
be rated a very fine chance of win- j
ning the individual crown.
All of which adds up to the idea !
that Stanford is the outstanding j
college in America when it comes j
to turning out winning golf teams. I
McCANN P.C.C. CHAMP
In Brownell the Indians have the
runner-up to Earl Stewart of L.S.U., j
last year's N.C.A A. champion. Mc-
Cann, a sophomore, has started his i
his varsity career in flashy style, '
winning the Pacific Coast Con
ference title this spring and play
ing steady golf all season.
Playing in the third spot on the I
Indian aggregation all season has
been Sandy Tatum, three-year vet
eran, who also competed in the na- '
tional tourney at Columbus last !
year. Another sophomore, George
Traphagen. has handled the fourth
spot, while junior Dave Doud and ;
sophomore Jack Wilson, and some
times sophomore Bob Barber, have
taken care of the remaining posi
tions on the team.
If a five-man team makes the trip
(; ix men went last year), the fifth
man will be determined by the
showings made this week-end by
Wilson and Doud in the Northern
California tourney.
*J HE RECORD
Briefly, the record of the Indians
in the N.C.A.A. tourney for the
past four years, which can't be
t qualed by any golf team in the na
tion right now. follows:
1938 Led by Art Doering, the In
dians copped the team champion
ship and set a new scoring record of
(301.
1939—The Maxwell trophy once
again landed in the clubhouse of the
Stanford golf course, as Warren
Berl, a sophomore then, paced the
Cards through the title and went to
the finals himself before falling be
fore Vince O'Antoni.
1940- Although Berl was once
again at the top of the Stanford
golf team, this year saw the Indians
wind up in sixth position in the team
rankings
-1941 The Indians made history
and only missed making a grand
slam by a small margin, as they (1)
won the team title, (2) broke their
own scoring record by 21 strokes,
(3) sent one man, Bud Brownell,
through as far as the finals, another
man, Dee Rcplogle, as far as the
quarter finals, and two other men,
Bud Finger and Capt. Warren Berl, j
ns far as the third round, and (4)
had in Finger the tourney medalist
runner-up.

When the Intercollegiate tennis tournament opens
next month in New Orleans, favored to win hoth sin
gles and doubles will he Stanford's entrants, Ted
Schroeder and Larry Dee.
Whether or not they will travel to New Orleans, if
the B.A.C. refuses to send them, has not yet heen

determined.
Schroeder, third ranking amateur
netter in the country, will be seeded
No. 1 in the singles ahead of the
nation's best college tennis men.
In combination with Due, Schroe-
DEE SEEDED HIGH
der will also top the seedings in the
doubles competition. Although Dee
and Jimmy Wade won the title when
both were sophomores in 1940. Wade
is now playing with Emery Neale to
give the Indians two strong tandems.
Neale and Dee also will probably
be seeded high in the singles along
with Seymour Greenburg of North
western, Pancho Segura of Miami,
Earl Bartlett of L.S.U., and Ted
Olewine and Billy Reedy of U.,S.C.
Although no team title is awarded,
Stanford with two strong doubles
teams and four good singles en
trants could easily capture it.
BEST RECORD
In the 20 years since the tourna
ment was started, Stanford has won
more titles than any other school
participating. Three times did an
Indian win the singles crown, while
six different doubles teams won.
Last man to win the singles cham
pionship for Stanford was Keith
Gledhill, who went on to become
•the world's doubles champion with
Ellsworth Vines.
Stanford's team has gone through
the season undefeated this year, and
has been called the greatest aggre
gation ever gathered at any one
school at one time. They defeated
the rival Bears 9-0, the first time
one team has been shut out in the
history of the matches.

Stanford golf course, as Warren
Berl, a sophomore then, paced the
Cards through the title and went to
the finals himself before falling be
fore Vince O'Antoni.
1940- Although Berl was once
again at the top of the Stanford
golf team, this year saw the Indians
wind up in sixth position in the team
rankings
-1941 The Indians made history
and only missed making a grand
slam by a small margin, as they (1)
won the team title, (2) broke their
own scoring record by 21 strokes,
(3) sent one man, Bud Brownell,
through as far as the finals, another
man, Dee Rcplogle, as far as the
quarter finals, and two other men,
Bud Finger and Capt. Warren Berl, j
ns far as the third round, and (4)
had in Finger the tourney medalist
runner-up.

When the Intercollegiate tennis tournament opens
next month in New Orleans, favored to win hoth sin
gles and doubles will he Stanford's entrants, Ted
Schroeder and Larry Dee.
Whether or not they will travel to New Orleans, if
the B.A.C. refuses to send them, has not yet heen

determined.
Schroeder, third ranking amateur
netter in the country, will be seeded
No. 1 in the singles ahead of the
nation's best college tennis men.
In combination with Due, Schroe-
DEE SEEDED HIGH
der will also top the seedings in the
doubles competition. Although Dee
and Jimmy Wade won the title when
both were sophomores in 1940. Wade
is now playing with Emery Neale to
give the Indians two strong tandems.
Neale and Dee also will probably
be seeded high in the singles along
with Seymour Greenburg of North
western, Pancho Segura of Miami,
Earl Bartlett of L.S.U., and Ted
Olewine and Billy Reedy of U.,S.C.
Although no team title is awarded,
Stanford with two strong doubles
teams and four good singles en
trants could easily capture it.
BEST RECORD
In the 20 years since the tourna
ment was started, Stanford has won
more titles than any other school
participating. Three times did an
Indian win the singles crown, while
six different doubles teams won.
Last man to win the singles cham
pionship for Stanford was Keith
Gledhill, who went on to become
•the world's doubles champion with
Ellsworth Vines.
Stanford's team has gone through
the season undefeated this year, and
has been called the greatest aggre
gation ever gathered at any one
school at one time. They defeated
the rival Bears 9-0, the first time
one team has been shut out in the
history of the matches.
If Condi Eddie Twiggs' Stanford golf team goes to
South Bend for the 45th annual National Collegiate
Athletic Association golf championships, the Indians
will he far and away the favorites to come home with
the team title in their possession.
If they do come through, it will he the fourth time

in five years and the 2nd
year that Twiggs' boys have walked
off with the Maxwell trophy.
In addition, any member of the
Stanford team, and especially Bud
Brownell and Frank McCann, will j
be rated a very fine chance of win- j
ning the individual crown.
All of which adds up to the idea !
that Stanford is the outstanding j
college in America when it comes j
to turning out winning golf teams. I

six different doubles teams won.
Last man to win the singles cham
pionship for Stanford was Keith
Gledhill, who went on to become
•the world's doubles champion with
Ellsworth Vines.
Stanford's team has gone through
the season undefeated this year, and
has been called the greatest aggre
gation ever gathered at any one
school at one time. They defeated
the rival Bears 9-0, the first time
one team has been shut out in the
history of the matches.
If Condi Eddie Twiggs' Stanford golf team goes to
South Bend for the 45th annual National Collegiate
Athletic Association golf championships, the Indians
will he far and away the favorites to come home with
the team title in their possession.
If they do come through, it will he the fourth time

in five years and the 2nd
year that Twiggs' boys have walked
off with the Maxwell trophy.
In addition, any member of the
Stanford team, and especially Bud
Brownell and Frank McCann, will j
be rated a very fine chance of win- j
ning the individual crown.
All of which adds up to the idea !
that Stanford is the outstanding j
college in America when it comes j
to turning out winning golf teams. I
McCANN P.C.C. CHAMP
In Brownell the Indians have the
runner-up to Earl Stewart of L.S.U., j
last year's N.C.A A. champion. Mc-
Cann, a sophomore, has started his i
his varsity career in flashy style, '
winning the Pacific Coast Con
ference title this spring and play
ing steady golf all season.
Playing in the third spot on the I
Indian aggregation all season has
been Sandy Tatum, three-year vet
eran, who also competed in the na- '
tional tourney at Columbus last !
year. Another sophomore, George
Traphagen. has handled the fourth
spot, while junior Dave Doud and ;
sophomore Jack Wilson, and some
times sophomore Bob Barber, have
taken care of the remaining posi
tions on the team.
If a five-man team makes the trip
(; ix men went last year), the fifth
man will be determined by the
showings made this week-end by
Wilson and Doud in the Northern
California tourney.
*J HE RECORD
Briefly, the record of the Indians
in the N.C.A.A. tourney for the
past four years, which can't be
t qualed by any golf team in the na
tion right now. follows:
1938 Led by Art Doering, the In
dians copped the team champion
ship and set a new scoring record of
(301.
1939—The Maxwell trophy once
again landed in the clubhouse of the
Stanford golf course, as Warren
Berl, a sophomore then, paced the
Cards through the title and went to
the finals himself before falling be
fore Vince O'Antoni.
1940- Although Berl was once
again at the top of the Stanford
golf team, this year saw the Indians
wind up in sixth position in the team
rankings
-1941 The Indians made history
and only missed making a grand
slam by a small margin, as they (1)
won the team title, (2) broke their
own scoring record by 21 strokes,
(3) sent one man, Bud Brownell,
through as far as the finals, another
man, Dee Rcplogle, as far as the
quarter finals, and two other men,
Bud Finger and Capt. Warren Berl, j
ns far as the third round, and (4)
had in Finger the tourney medalist
runner-up.

When the Intercollegiate tennis tournament opens
next month in New Orleans, favored to win hoth sin
gles and doubles will he Stanford's entrants, Ted
Schroeder and Larry Dee.
Whether or not they will travel to New Orleans, if
the B.A.C. refuses to send them, has not yet heen

determined.
Schroeder, third ranking amateur
netter in the country, will be seeded
No. 1 in the singles ahead of the
nation's best college tennis men.
In combination with Due, Schroe-
DEE SEEDED HIGH
der will also top the seedings in the
doubles competition. Although Dee
and Jimmy Wade won the title when
both were sophomores in 1940. Wade
is now playing with Emery Neale to
give the Indians two strong tandems.
Neale and Dee also will probably
be seeded high in the singles along
with Seymour Greenburg of North
western, Pancho Segura of Miami,
Earl Bartlett of L.S.U., and Ted
Olewine and Billy Reedy of U.,S.C.
Although no team title is awarded,
Stanford with two strong doubles
teams and four good singles en
trants could easily capture it.
