### 
The Zetes and Legal Fables will meet this afternoon at 1 p.m. on Dia
mond 3 to deeide the mural Softball championship after six weeks of com
petition among 50 campus organization teams.
The Zetes won in the semi-finals Wednesday hy defeating the Breakers
6-0 in a game that was marked hy a fast pitching duel between Sid llayes

of the Zetes and Sherm Selix oH
Breakers. The difference between the
teams was the nine errors made by
the Breakers.
MOUND DUEL
Hays struck out seven men and
allowed one hit, while Selix struck
out five and allowed four hits. The j
winners made no errors and gave
Hayes excellent support.
While Hayes was a little slower
than Selix, it was the fine support
that made the difference along with
the fact that three of Breakers' first -
string men were missing.
ROBINSON HITTER
The Legal Eagles trounced Encina
IE yesterday 28-4 to move into the I
finals, led by Harris Robison, who '
starred by hitting a home run, a
double, and 3 singles. Rex Shoop, as
the lawyer's pitcher, threw his best
ball of the season, and if he makes
the same showing today as yester
day, he will give Hayes something of
the battle which Selix did.
Mural totals for the past two quar
ters will be announced shortly, ac
cording to Red Holman, intramural
manager. The end of the Softball
season today will leave but 3 events
on the mural program for the re
mainder of the quarter.
