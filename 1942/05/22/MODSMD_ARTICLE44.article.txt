Ed Hertel and Johnny Fulton, ac
companied hy Assistant Coach Pete
Couch will head for Los Angeles to
night to compete in the Southern
Pacific Association A.A.U. meet in

Fulton, frosh middle-distance ace,
was invited down by A1 Wesson, di
rector of the meet, to compete in the
880-yard run. His competition will
include Warren Smtih of U.S.C. and
Thalmo Knowles of San Jose. One
of these men will probably run
about 1:53 in order to win.
HERTEL'S RECORD
Hertel's main competition in the
high hurdles will stem from U.S.C.'s
John Biewner, Arizona'.? Donn Kin
zle, and Louie Futrell of Fresno.
However, he has already defeated
all of these men, and shouldn't expe
rience too much difficulty doing it
again. He will be shooting for the
school record of 14.2 made by Gus
Meier in 1933. His mark of 14.3
made during the Fresno Relays last
week stamps him as a definite threat
to Meier's mark as well as Jack
Weierhauser and Sam Klopstock's
23.2 school low hurdle records.
Pushing Hertel in the lows will be
a pair of Trojans, Dick Browning
and Walt Smith. Both have done
23.4 this year, which is also Hertel's
best.

was invited down by A1 Wesson, di
rector of the meet, to compete in the
880-yard run. His competition will
include Warren Smtih of U.S.C. and
Thalmo Knowles of San Jose. One
of these men will probably run
about 1:53 in order to win.
HERTEL'S RECORD
Hertel's main competition in the
high hurdles will stem from U.S.C.'s
John Biewner, Arizona'.? Donn Kin
zle, and Louie Futrell of Fresno.
However, he has already defeated
all of these men, and shouldn't expe
rience too much difficulty doing it
again. He will be shooting for the
school record of 14.2 made by Gus
Meier in 1933. His mark of 14.3
made during the Fresno Relays last
week stamps him as a definite threat
to Meier's mark as well as Jack
Weierhauser and Sam Klopstock's
23.2 school low hurdle records.
Pushing Hertel in the lows will be
a pair of Trojans, Dick Browning
and Walt Smith. Both have done
23.4 this year, which is also Hertel's
best.
