# Card Ball Team To Tackle Army
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball season comes
to a close next week when Coach
Harry Wolter's combined varsity
and freshman squads meet two
strong service teams on the Sunken
Diamond.
On Thursday they tangle with the
Fliers of Mather Field, and on Sat
urday close their schedule against
the very powerful aggregation from
Camp Roberts. The latter team
boasts of two former big league
pitchers, Bobby Johnson and Larry
Powell. This team is under the di
rection of Claude Purkitt, former
Stanford star.
Bill Brokaw and Harry "Doc"
Mason, flashy frosh pitchers, will
probably get the starting assign
ments against the service teams, wilh
several other freshmen seeing action.
