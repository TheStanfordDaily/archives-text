# Gridders To End Spring Drills
## '42 Eleven To Preview For Public 
### 
Stanford previews its 1!I42 foot
ball team tomorrow with a two and
a half hour scrimmage on the prac
tice Held, starting at 2::»0. After a
short warm-up, 70-odd gridders will
clash in the final spring workout as
allotted by the Pacific Coast Con
ference rulings.
All the other Bay area schools
have completed their oft' - season
drills, so the Indians will be the last
local eleven seen in action until
September when wartime football
practice gets under way on the Farm
two weeks before the fall opener
against Oregon.
O.K. TACKLE TO TACKLE
From tackle to tackle Jim Law
son's varsity is intact from last year's
squad save at center, where Vic
Lindskog has been graduated to the
ranks of the Philadelphia Eagles of
the National Football League. Lind
skog has been working with Milt
Vueinieh, converted from fullback,
and Jack McCurdy, up from the
l'rosh, plus Darwin Seeley and Tyler
Norton.
Funny thing is that a spectator
doesn't know just how hard it is to
get that ball to the quarterback in
a hurry. However, Vueinieh is
working in nicely, and McCurdy.
injured during the midway point of
the l'rosh season, has also showed
plenty of zip.
At the ends only one veteran re
turns, Hank Norberg. Bill Symes,
who possibly could have grabbed a
first-string spot but has suffered
badly from arteritis, was forced to
drop football.
IMOWN AT END
Aside from "Big Hank," there's
Dave Brown, who's being groomed
for either of the end positions.
Brown will start on one of the
squads tomorrow with Norberg at
the other.
Pitted in Ihe backfield on one of
the starting teams will bo two fast
halves, Hoot Armstrong and soph
Jim Pettit. At quarter either A1
Cole or Ray Hammett get the nod,
and Buck Fawcett, switched from
halfback, will do the fullback totin',
Everybody that suits up will
play and Lawson promises a very
informal session with players be
ing changed from offensive to de
fensive teams and juggled around at
will.
