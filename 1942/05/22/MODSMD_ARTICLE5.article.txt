# Hikers to Visit Rolph Estate
## 
### 
James Rolph 111 has invited the
hikers in the local physical fitness
group, under Lieut. Comm. Stewart
Bryant, to visit his estate on their
20-mile hike this Sunday.
The route will be by way of Felt
Lake, Ampuerte Cottage, and Los
Trancos Woods. The group will
swim in the pool at the Rolph estate
and will visit the stock and pheasant
farm as well as the trophy room.
The hikers will start this hike at
Frenchman's Bridge at 9 a.m., and
as this will be the toughest of the six
hikes, special care has been recom
mended in choosing footwear.
Two pairs of sox are recommend
ed, one of heavy wool, and the other
ol a thin material. Shoes should be
stout, preferably with composition
soles and rubber heels. The shoes
should be greased before the trip.
Besides carrying knapsack lunches
and swimming suits, it is suggested
that each person carry some adhe
sive tape to apply to any tender
spots which develop on the feet dur
ing the trip. This will help to pre
vent blistering.
Five o'clock is the anticipated
hour of return to the starting point.
All interested persons, who arc
physically fit, are welcome to join in
this hike.
