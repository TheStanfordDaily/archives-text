| TXATS OFF to those gentlemen
J known as the Bucklubbers. In
j case you're not in the know, these
[ gentlemen keep many Stanford stu
| dents in school by giving their
I money for grants-in-aid.
In April E. P. "Red" Hauser
turned over to Chancellor Wilbur
a check for $3,000 to be used by
the Student Aid Commission.
Red is treasurer for the organiza
j tion and at the same time edits the
j monthly paper which is sent to
members, giving news of the cam
pus and of other members. In fact,
Red might even be called the "guid
ing genius" of the organization.

r the morning ofT tomorrow
I and walk—don't drive—to Red
[ wood City, climate best by govern-
I ment test, to see the First Annual
i Renewed California-Stanford Crew
! Classic.
Sit along (he cool banks of the
Poughkeepsie of the West and sip
J a mint julep while watching the
skulls go gliding by in front of
you, and speaking of skulls, you
might take in a horror movie in
Mcnlo 011 your way home.

IF YOU hurry back to the Farm
you can catch the Spring Grid
game in the afternoon at the varsity
; practice field. This will be real foot
ball, and the only time between now
1 and nexl f,-ill's first game, that the
: varsity will display their talents in
j public.
Don't think that just because
miracle man Clark Shaughnessy

is gene, that football will go back
to the drab style played here a few
years ago. Jim Lawson teaches
the same flashy, open game that
Coach Clark did, and this year's
team is one c.f Ihe fastest ever as
sembled here.

J ET TvIE herewith go on record
with a little long-range predict
ing by saying that we will defeat
Cal in four of the five major sports
during the school year 1942-43.
Yes, even the Big Meet should
fall to the Indians of next spring.
Football, basketball, and tennis
should go to us, too, with the Bears
slipping out with the baseball
crown.
/ you possibly get your Mon
-4 day lab postponed until some
day later in the week? Coach John
Lamb has arranged to get the best
tennis players in California to come
down to the Farm Monday afternoon

and give a series of exhibitions with |
the varsity for free.
Jack Kramer, George Richards, ;
Ed Amark, and Budge Patty will
mix with Ted Schroeder, Emery
Neale. Larry Dee, and Jimmy Wade
in singles and doubles matches.
Although Schroeder was seeded |
ahead of Kramer in the State Tour- |
ney which is in progress at Berkeley i
now, probably the latter is playing i
better tennis now than any other
amateur in the country.
