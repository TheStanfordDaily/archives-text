# Grant the Eastern Trips
## 
### 
SINCE the Board ot Athletic Control voted
down, against the opposition of all student
members, the Eastern trips for the golf, tennis
and track teams to compete in the N.C.A.A.
championships, student opinion has been voiced
so strongly that the student members of the
B.A.C. have called a special meeting of the
board tomorrow at 1 p.m. to reconsider.
There are four student members of the board:
the student body president is an automatic
member with vote; the Daily editor is an auto
matic ex-officio member, and there are two
members with votes elected by the student
body. At present, they are Larry Dee and Chuck
Taylor. These members will not ask tomorrow
for the track team to be represented in the East,
but they will urgently request the board to
change its mind on the golf and tennis trips.
Objectively, there is only one reason—ad
mittedly a good one—why the teams should not
make the trips East. The reason is the B.A.C.
expects decreased revenue due to crowd limi
tation at wartime athletic events, and the policy
is to make present funds last as long as possible.
The purpose of this editorial is, nevertheless,
to assist in influencing the Board of Athletic Con
trol to send the golf and tennis teams to the In
tercollegiates because, while it is difficult to
justify the expense in these times, we believe
such action would be ultimately for the good
of Stanford. There are reasons to prove it.
Probably the most important consideration
is, paradoxically, a purely cold-blooded, mone
tary one. Both teams are almost cinches to win
the National Intercollegiate Championships.
The tremendous volume of favorable publicity
for Stanford cannot be overlooked in wartime,
when any private institution needs all the tui
tion-paying students it can get. Some members
of the board may argue the board does not op
erate as a philanthropic institution, but as a
business corporation. Such a statement would
be correct, and in sending the teams East, the
board would be making a sound investment for
Stanford and consequently for itself.
Stanford's impressive tennis and golf records
are reviewed on page 4. California went down
before the Indians to its worst defeat in Berkeley
tennis history this year when Stanford blanked
the Bears 9-0, the first shut-out in the history of
California-Stanford tennis competition.
If the golf team goes to the Intercollegiates
next month, and it is almost sure to hang up a
team win and perhaps earn the individual cham
pionship, the tally will be four national titles for
the team in five years.
Stanford is the top golfing school in the
nation, without doubt. The amount of publicity
Stanford would gain through Eastern interest in
the N.C.A.A. could not be equaled by the foot
ball team with anything short of a trip to the
Rose Bowl. Stanford's top-flight golfers would
lend to the tournament the competitive flavor
that Luisetti would lend to a basketball cham
pionship.
The tournament will be held on the Chain o'
Lakes course in South Bend, Indiana, with Notre
Dame as host. It will be the opening event of
Notre Dame's One Hundredth Anniversary cele
bration. There has been an unprecedented
amount of time, money and energy spent by
Notre Dame to insure a top-notch tournament.
Failure of the best college golf team in the
United States to appear would undoubtedly
cripple the tournament, and friendly relations
should not be overlooked. Stanford plays No
tre Dame on the South Bend gridiron next fall,
and will be host to the Fighting Irish on the
Farm in 1943.
The tournament will be particularly impor
tant this year because there will be no National
Open and no National Amateur tourneys. It
v/ill be the only actual amateur tourney this
year, and the only one in which a national inter
collegiate champion will be crowned.
The South Bend matches will be preceded
immediately by the Hale America Tournament
in Chicago, June 18-21, only 80 miles from
South Bend. Although it is not under the aus
pices of the U.S. Golf Association, there are
1,475 entries. This important tourney will draw
every big golfing writer in the country—such
men as Charley Bartlett of the Chicago Tribune
and Bill Richardson of the New York Times—
who will naturally step over to South Bend to
cover the Intercollegiates. Publicity like that
can't be bought.

The fact that the Notre Dame tournament pro
ceeds will go to Navy Relief cannot be over
looked.
While this may appear as a one-sided argu
ment for the golf team, the tennis trip is equally
important. The granting by the B.A.C. of the
students' request would be a wise investment
from the angles of publicity, intercollegiate rela
tions and, most important, Stanford honor.
