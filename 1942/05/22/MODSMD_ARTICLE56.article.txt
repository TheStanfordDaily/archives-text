### AMIE REICHERT 
JT TAKES til 1 kinds of jobs to win this war and that's
a fact. Take these 45 American technicians who
have spent the past few months in the Far East scorch
ing the earth from Borneo to Burma.
These are the odd-job men of the front. They
belong to a group known as the American Technical
Group which has specialized in arson and dynamiting,
and keeping one step ahead of the advancing Japanese
invaders.
They are armed only with matches and gasoline
and dynamite, and they can destroy a truck in three
minutes, a loaded warehouse in ten minutes, and a
large bridge in a quarter of an hour. That's almost as
good going as Buck Rogers—and he uses a disinte
grator gun at that.
The ATG made quite a record for itself in these
last few months on a front that is vitally important—
the scorched earth front. When the war broke out the
Americans had just left Manilla and they went imme
diately to Borneo. In two weeks they destroyed enough
of the oil fields there to make the Japanese wish they
hadn't wasted so much efTort in capturing the island.
After that they went on to Java. Reports recently
from Britain stated that the scorched earth in Java
was so thorough that it will take the Japanese two
years to get any oil out of the fields there. The British
said that cement was poured down the wells and in
the pipe lines.

Java the American technicians went on to
more dirty work in Burma. Their first job there
was to assemble 6,000 tanks on the Burma Road and
see that (iO.OOO tons of Lend-Lease materials arrived
safely at their destinations in Free China.
As the enemy moved closer to Rangoon the dyna
miters destroyed 2,000 unassembled vehicles and
burned half a dozen warehouses to prevent their fall
ing into Japanese hands.
For the next two months they were kept on the run
from 10 to 100 miles ahead of the advancing Japanese.
When the ATG didn't have gasoline they sucked
i<'through a tube from the tank of a deserted car, then
sprayed a little on the car and ignited it.
It was pretty dangerous work and pretty unpleas
ant. The U.P. says not a man of the 45 has any eye
brows left and their faces are badly burned.
This is the sort of thing that is meant by all-out
war.

As the enemy moved closer to Rangoon the dyna
miters destroyed 2,000 unassembled vehicles and
burned half a dozen warehouses to prevent their fall
ing into Japanese hands.
For the next two months they were kept on the run
from 10 to 100 miles ahead of the advancing Japanese.
When the ATG didn't have gasoline they sucked
i<'through a tube from the tank of a deserted car, then
sprayed a little on the car and ignited it.
It was pretty dangerous work and pretty unpleas
ant. The U.P. says not a man of the 45 has any eye
brows left and their faces are badly burned.
This is the sort of thing that is meant by all-out
war.
JT TAKES til 1 kinds of jobs to win this war and that's
a fact. Take these 45 American technicians who
have spent the past few months in the Far East scorch
ing the earth from Borneo to Burma.
These are the odd-job men of the front. They
belong to a group known as the American Technical
Group which has specialized in arson and dynamiting,
and keeping one step ahead of the advancing Japanese
invaders.
They are armed only with matches and gasoline
and dynamite, and they can destroy a truck in three
minutes, a loaded warehouse in ten minutes, and a
large bridge in a quarter of an hour. That's almost as
good going as Buck Rogers—and he uses a disinte
grator gun at that.
The ATG made quite a record for itself in these
last few months on a front that is vitally important—
the scorched earth front. When the war broke out the
Americans had just left Manilla and they went imme
diately to Borneo. In two weeks they destroyed enough
of the oil fields there to make the Japanese wish they
hadn't wasted so much efTort in capturing the island.
After that they went on to Java. Reports recently
from Britain stated that the scorched earth in Java
was so thorough that it will take the Japanese two
years to get any oil out of the fields there. The British
said that cement was poured down the wells and in
the pipe lines.

more dirty work in Burma. Their first job there
was to assemble 6,000 tanks on the Burma Road and
see that (iO.OOO tons of Lend-Lease materials arrived
safely at their destinations in Free China.
