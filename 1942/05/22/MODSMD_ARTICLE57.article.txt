### MIKE CHURCHILL 
enjoys a good joke more than I do. Ha ha
ha. See, I'm laughing. But this d business
has gone too d far.
Heat, humidity, and hay fever, the cursed three,
have hit our campus like a panzer division, and have
overcome it as effectively.
The only solution that appears is the opening of
a branch school in Yosemite. For the months of May,
June and July regular work could be given in the
high, invigorating and pollen - free atmosphere of
the Sierra.
If it is required that the branch be nearer, a pos
sible alternative is the top of the Mark. It is likely
that the distractions would be greater in the latter
spot, however.
I am turning the whole thing over to an Excom sub
committee. They have proven able to reorganize
anything.

evening several of the new Phi Betes
were down the highway celebrating their appoint

wines, the scene was a jovial one.
Then one of them was called to the phone. A dis
tracted fraternity brother was phoning from his house
to know how to do a problem in Optics. The Phi
Bete explained how, the fellow went back to his study

yY FUNNY conversation was carried on outside the
little Episcopal church in Menlo several Sun
days ago.
As is his custom, the minister was talking to the
people in front of the church following the service.
An elderly lady was saying that she had had some
lovely jelly sent her from the East and that she must
give him some.
"They sent it," she said, "in a very tall narrow
glass, explaining in the letter that when the jelly was
all gone it would do for a zombie glass. What ever do
you suppose is a zombie glass?"
"I've heard of zombies," said her companion.
"They're something to do with witchcraft, or black
magic, but I don't see the connection. Do you, rev
erend?"
"I'm sure I havent' the slightest idea,' replied the
minister, with what I swear was a knowing glance.

has gone too d far.
Heat, humidity, and hay fever, the cursed three,
have hit our campus like a panzer division, and have
overcome it as effectively.
The only solution that appears is the opening of
a branch school in Yosemite. For the months of May,
June and July regular work could be given in the
high, invigorating and pollen - free atmosphere of

"I've heard of zombies," said her companion.
"They're something to do with witchcraft, or black
magic, but I don't see the connection. Do you, rev
erend?"
"I'm sure I havent' the slightest idea,' replied the
minister, with what I swear was a knowing glance.
