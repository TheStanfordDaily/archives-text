# CAMPUS OPINION
## GIVE QUEENS A BREAK 
### 
yHE EDITOR, SIR:
If you will pardon my using the Campus Opinion
column to plug another publication, I will venture to
say that I have read and enjoyed both the humor and
the facetious pages of the Chaparral for many months
now.
However, there is one feature that has consistently
irked my sense of the just, to-wit: the pictures of the
Campus Queens. For month after month these pic
tures have been badly lighted, over-dilTused, lacking
in skin texture, and apparently retouched with a
spoon.
The Chappie has done justice to Superfella, Cardi
nal O'Hara, and the Alpha Dclts; why can't they print
reasonably accurate likenesses of these queens?
