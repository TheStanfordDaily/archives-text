# HOW ABOUT THAT?

### 
r jpHE EDITOH, SIR:
We arc told that sugar is used to make molasses
which makes smokeless powder.
There were 511,211.285 gallons of whiskey stocked
in warehouses at the end of 1941.
It would be perfectly possible to redistill this whis
key to get the same amount of alcohol.
My question is: if a good many American house
wives heard these figures, would they be so anxious to
accept sugar rationing as a war sacrifice while distill
ers hold their stocks of liquor inviolate?
