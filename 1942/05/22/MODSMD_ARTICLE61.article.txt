# Year's Best Movie Satire, Drama Shown on Same Bill
## 
### 
"THE MALE ANIMAL," now playing at the Stanford in Palo Alto.
The blue moon has shone. Two of the year's best pictures are playing
on the same bill.
One is a drama, the other a satire. "Joan of Paris," the drama, boasts
little advance ballyhoo and few publicized stars, but its cast could hardly

be more excellent or its
more superb. At least one sequence |
is an innovation which leaves the j
audience incredulous. And scenes j
like that of the French schoolboys i
defiantly singing the Marseille as j
the storm troopers enter, are rare j
motion picture climaxes.
"The Male Animal," the satire,
has been heralded, both as a stage
and as a screen play, a successful
comedy. But although the screen
version did not become completely
metamorphosed from a stage play,
and although the play's significance
has seen timelier days, the resultant
picture is nevertheless not only a
successful comedy, but much more
than comedy.
And until the blue moon shines
again, there will never be two A
pictures—and outstanding A pictures
—playing on a single bill.—Covey
