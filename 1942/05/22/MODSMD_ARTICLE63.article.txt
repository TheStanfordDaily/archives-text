# Huston in Final Sunday Series
## 
### 
The last picture of the Sadler Se- j
l ies, "Rhodes of Africa," shows Sun- j
day at 7:15 in Memorial Hall; ad- j
mission is 20 cents. The last chapter j
of "Buck Rogers," and the news arc
included on the bill.
With Walter Huston in the title
role, the great biographical film re
counts the story of the British dia
mond tycoon who, informed he has
but six months to live, rises to a dic
tatorial position in South Africa ten
years later.
In the course of his struggles to
unite South Africa under the British
Empire, Rhodes engages in the fiasco
of Jameson's Raid, and is forced to
resign all his lofty titles. But as he
lies dying, the Boer War is fulfilling
his dream.
Meticulous care was taken to
make "Rhodes of Africa" flawlessly
authentic. The producers even
brought a real Matabele warrior to
England to play the part of King
Lobengula, and he turned out to be
a superb actor. "Time" commented:
"In history, Rhodes stole King Lo
bengula's country; in "Rhodes,"
King Lobengula steals the show."
