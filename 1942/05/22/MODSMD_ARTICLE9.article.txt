### 
MANZANAR, Calif., May 22
(UP). â€”In a setting reminiscent of
America's pioneer days, six Japa
nese worked today on a constitu
tion that will provide self-govern
ment for the first time for thou
sands of their fellow evacuees
here.
Ted Akahoshi, 4fi-year-old Stan
ford graduate and Santa Maria
rancher, was chairman of the com
mittee. He is a field foreman and
is helping supervise a guayule
rubber experiment now under way.
"The WCCA has willingly giv
en us a large share of government
within rules laid down for us,"
he explained. "The War Depart
ment does not want to step in un
less it becomes necessary. So far
we have worked harmoniously to
gether."
