# Chancellor Wilbur Okays Summer Conservation Camp at Huntington Lake
## Faculty Chosen to Teach Ectology, Fire Conservation, California Econ; Maximum Enrollment Raised to 110 
### 
The Stanford Emergency Conservation School received formal Uni
versity approval from Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur last Friday, accord
ing to Schafer Williams, instructor in history and newly appointed chair
man of the actual operation of the camp.
The general committee which has fostered and brought the school into

istence has tentatively lined up the
faculty, Williams said.
The academic director will be Pro
fessor Ira L. Wiggins of the Natural
History Museum. He will also teach
a course in forest ectology. Dr. Jen
kins from Sacramento Junior Col
lege, formerly of Stanford, will
teach a course in the principles of
conservation.
FIRE PREVENTION
Edward Steen will teach a course
in forest water shed protection and
will be in charge of the training
program for fire prevention and
suppression. Steen is a graduate in
the School of Education and is the
originator of the conservation
school plan.
There will also be courses in the
economic history of California and
an intensive course in first aid to
take care of men in the fire line. In
structors for these courses have not
been announced.
In praising the plan which was
first brought to the University's at
tention by Steen, Williams said:
"This is the best single program
ever offered in the United States for
training young men both in the
meaning of conservation and in the
ability to do something about it."
University officials are now com
pleting negotiations for Huntington
Lake in the High Sierras where the
school will be conducted from June
15 to September 15.
Because of the unusual response
for applications to date the quota has
been raised to 110 men. Further in
formation concernig the school may
be obtained in the history office,
Williams said.
CREDIT GIVEN
"Here is an ideal way for the
student who wants to participate ac
tively in the National Emergency
and at the same time further his own
interests by adding 15 or more cred
its to University requirements.
There are no strings attached and
any Stanford student may qualify,"
Williams added.
Williams pointed out that students
would not only learn something
about conservation but they would
also be looking after California's
greatest asset which is now her
greatest liability in wartime.
