### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford will aid America's war
industries with an all-campus drive
for scrap materials beginning today
and continuing until Saturday with
old metals, paper, rags, and rubber
to be collected. Chairmen have been
appointed in all living groups to
assist in collections.
Fraternities and sororities axe ex
pected to make a day-to-day can
vass, while the halls will hold their
collection Friday. A Peninsula San
itary Company truck will pick up all
material Saturday.
Hall students will be assisted by
chairmen in making the Friday col
lection. All material will be stored
and picked up the following morning
by the Peninsula truck as it makes
the rounds o£ the campus.
USE FOR MATERIALS
In America's total effort for total
victory, every pound of these mate
rials must be salvaged because:
Scrap metal makes the steel, brass,
copper, lead, and other metals for
the guns, planes, tanks, and ships we
need for victory—
Waste paper makes new paper
board to ship munitions, clothing,
and food to America's fighting men
at home and overseas—
Old rubber makes new rubber for
our motorized forces—for planes,
tanks, and battleships—and for es
sential civilian needs—
Old rags make needed materials
for emergency buildings, wiping
rags for war industries, and re
worked textiles.
S I EEL MILLS USE SCRAP
On the Pacific Coast the steel
mills use 85 per cent scrap steel and
15 per cent pig.
A few articles that contain iron
and scrap steel are discarded tools,
broken or obsolete household equip
ment, unused kettles, garden im
plements, old tire chains, and other
similar items.
SALVAGE IMPERATIVE
Despite the fact that demands of
war industries, vast though these
demands have been, are being cur
rently met, the possibility of a dis
ruption of supplies from abroad has
made it imperative that the nation
conserve its stores of lead.
Worn-out automobile batteries,
obsolete or broken plumbing and
heating and similar household equip
ment were cited by salvage commit
tee chairman Ed Porter.
Chairmen of the halls working
with Bill Hutchinson, who is in
complete charge of collections, are
Bill Hayes, Encina; Howard Nichol
son, Toyon; A1 Ellsberg, Branner;
Susan Wright, Lagunita; Callie Cur
tis, Roble; and Martha Ann Cass,
Union.
