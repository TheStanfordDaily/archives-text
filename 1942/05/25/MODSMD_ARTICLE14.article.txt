# Russians Forge Ahead Near Kharkov; Japan Batters Kinhwa Gates
## Occupation Expected Soon As Country Sees Heaviest Fighting in Five Years 
### 
CHUNGKING, May 24 (UP).â€”An estimated 100,000
Japanese battered from three directions today at Chi
nese defenses in the outskirts of Kinhwa, provisional
capital and railway center of maritime Chckiang Prov
ince, 185 miles southwest of Shanghai, in the heaviest
fighting in East Asia in five yoors.
Latest reports said the fighting was still outside

the gates of Kinhwa, and that cas
ualties on both sides were heavy.
(Tokyo Radio said Japanese van
guards were six miles from Kinhwa
and were expected to occupy the
town soon. It said Gen. Ku Chu
Tsung, commander of the Third
Chinese War Zone, apparently has
decided to abandon the town and
that the Bth Chinese Army, accom
panied by civilians, is trying to flee
from it. The southern outskirts of
the town are engulfed in flames, Tok
yo said.
Allt BASE OBJECTIVES
(London Radio was heard by CBS
quoting a Chinese military spokes
man as saying that the objective of
the Chekiang offensive was to de
stroy Chinese air bases within
bombing range of Tokyo and to tie
up Chinese troops who might be
sent to Yunnan Province to meet the
Japanese drive along the Burma
Road.)
(The German Radio quoted the
Tokyo newspaper Nichi Nichi as say
ing that the Chekiang offensive and
Japanese attacks on air bases in cen
tral and eastern China were part of
a "concentric attempt to liquidate
the China affair." Japanese control
of Chekiang Province, the newspa
per said, would sever the Hangchow-
Nanchang railway, over which vital
supplies are ferried to the Chung
king forces.)
Jap bombers had blasted at Kinh
wa ceaselessly for 24 hours before
the battle neared the town, an Army
communique said.
FIGHT STUBBORNLY
The Chinese, lacking mechanized
equipment and heavy artillery,
fought stubbornly for the town, the
key point of the Chekiang-Kiangsi
railway between Japanese - held
Hangchow, 85 miles to the northeast,
and Japanese-held Nanchang, 230
miles to the southwest.
The main enemy pressure was from
the east, northeast and southeast,
the communique said, but another
Japanese column was descending on
Kinhwa by river from the north
west.
Meanwhile, in Yunnan Province,
bordering Burma, 19 Japanese
bombers made a foray Saturday,
one force of eight bombers and six
'ighfers attacking Paoshan, where
bombs fell in the center of town, it
was reported.
