# Navy Approves Stanford's V-1
## Recruiting Officer Will Talk Thursday 
### 
The Navy has officially approved
Stanford University's curricula for
V-l, the naval officers' training pro-
I gram for sophomores, freshmen,
I and prospective freshmen between
! the ages of 17 and 19, inclusive.
Ensign F. L. Wyatt of the U. S.
Navy recruiting service will speak
next Thursday at 7 p.m. in Encina
lobby at a special meeting for
sophomores and freshmen and will
j answer students questions about the
V-l plan.
Enlistment in V-l immediately es
tablishes a student's status in the
armed forces and assures him at
least two calendar years of college
life. If he is accepted for V-7, deck
and engineering officers' training, he
can continue his schooling until
graduation.
Although certain mathematics
and physics requirements have been
set up by the Navy, they arc only
equivalent to those required by a
high school graduate seeking ad
mission into an accredited engineer
ing school. Students' normal courses
of study will not in any way be af
fected.
After completion of approximately
one to one and a half calendar years
in college, each V-l man will take a
classification test to determine his
qualifications for transfer either to
V-7 or to V-5, flight officers training.
Those students qualifying in the ex
aminations who have chosen class
V-5 will be transferred to an avia
tion training center, and students
choosing class V-7 will continue
their college work until they have
received their bachelor degrees.
