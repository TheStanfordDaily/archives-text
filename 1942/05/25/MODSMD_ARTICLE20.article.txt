MOSCOW, Mon., May 25 (UP). â€”Russian troops
forged ahead through the slaughter field around Khar
kov for the 13th straight day Sunday hul the Germans
clung doggedly to the offensive on the Russian left
(lank, 7.> miles to the southeast, and there were re
ports of great German tank and gun concentrations
in the Smolensk sector directly west of Moscow.

Red Fleet, the Soviet naval organ,
said that the Germans may be ex
pected to start mass parachute land
ings on the Russian Black Sea coast
soon and it urged the total mobiliza
tion of Russian marines to guard the
shoreline. It said the Germans also
have amassed some large flying
boats which can land near the shore
and put out invaders in rubber
dinghies.
The Germans have found that it
is useless to land small parties of
spies and saboteurs behind the Rus
sian lines, as they have been doing,
and now are landing heavily-armed
forces of up to 150 men, equipped
! with small mountain cannons, mo-

torcycles, light tanks and armored
cars, Red Fleet said. It did not say
where the landings occurred, but
presumably they were on the Kerch
Peninsula, which the Russians evac
uated last week.
OCCUPY IMPORTANT PLACE
An early morning communique
said Russian troops beat back Ger
man attacks and occupied an im
portant populated place near Khar
kov, and that they destroyed 40 Ger
man tanks in two days of fighting in
the Izyum-Barvenkova sector, where
it was admitted that the Red Army
was fighting "defensive battles."
German infantry as well as tank
units attacking in the southeast sec
tor were said to be suffering enor
mous casualties.
Saturday's air losses were given
officially as 24 German and 11 Rus
sian planes. Russian planes addi
tionally destroyed 35 German tanks,
175 trucks loaded with troops and
supplies, 18 gun emplacements, a
railway train and three munitions
dumps and destroyed or dispersed
four companies of Axis troops, the
communique said.
400 GERMANS KILLED
Four hundred Germans were kill
ed in a village seized by the Russians
near Kharkov, according to the
communique.
In the northwest, it said, two Rus
sian units forced their way across a
river and drove a wedge into the
German lines, annihilating a German
company that counterattacked.
Military dispatches told of the
routing of four Axis battalions in
the north Karelian sector, above
Leningrad, in a three-day battle,
and of the Germans feverishly build
ing fortifications and massing great
quantities of material on the central
front, west of Moscow.
Although Crimea was lost, except
for the besieged naval base of Sevas
topol and some isolated islands of
resistance, Soviet planes were wag
ing a furious campaign against Ger
man air bases there. The Germans
had massed hundreds of planes for
the Kerch campaign and they were
lying on congested airdromes, offer
ing ideal targets for Russian bom ti
ers.
