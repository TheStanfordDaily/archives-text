# Board Decides Not to Raise Price of Cokes
## Cellar to Sell Match Books Next Quarter In Change of Policy 
### 
The Cellar will continue to give
away matches and charge five cents
lor cokes, it was decided al a meet
ing of the executive committee of
the Stanford Union Board on May
14. Chairman William Owens pre
sided.
After studying a survey of prac
tices by Palo Alto firms in connec
tion with matches, the board decided
to give them away until the end of
spring quarter. Thereafter, two
hooks wiil be sold for five cents.
Because of the limited supply of
coke, the board debated whether to
raise the price to 10 cents, charge
3(J cents if another flavor is added, or
continue the present policy of five
cent cokes even though the supply
might not last through the priority
period. Since supply, not cost, is the
main factor, five-cent cokes will
continue.
The problem of walkouts was dis
cussed by the board, which ob
served that immediately following
the Daily publicity on violations of
the Honor Code there was an in
crease in the daily amount from
walkouts. However, no action was
taken.
The board also approved the use
of part of the concert room for stor
age space because of the larger de
liveries of supplies.
