# Original Settings Designed For 'He Who Gets Slopped'
## 
### BETTY TREMAYNE 
"He Who Octs Slapped," the expressionistic Russian play of circus
life which is being presented by the Stanford Players next Thursday, will
have one cf the most unusual sets ever designed for the Memorial Theater.
Waldemar Johanscn has devised a high stairway which is supposed to
lead (o the arena of a European circus. However, the stairs, instead of

being built up from the floor are.
suspended from the gridiron and
seem to hang in space.
Mr. Johansen explained that the
play is about a man who tries to
build a dream world for himself so
the set should be something unreal
and should seem to be unsubstantial
as a dream.
"Another feature of the produc
tion is that the lights, instead of be
ing concealed from the audience as
in most plays, will be hung where
ever they are most convenient. "If
it is best to have them out in the
auditorium where the audience can
see them, then that is where they
will be hung," Mr. Johansen ex
plained.
"He Who Gets Slapped" is a the
atrical play and makes no pretense
at realism. Members of the audience
are never supposed to forget that
they are in a theater. When the audi
ence enters the theater they will
find the curtain up, the stage set,
and the lights in place. When it is
time to begin the play the actors
will enter and ihe play will begin.
