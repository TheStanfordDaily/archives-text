"Our Marching Civilization," a
musical interpretation of history,
will be presented by Warren D. Al
len, professor of music and educa
tion, tomorrow evening in the audi
torium of Memorial Hall at 7:30 in

An innovation in musical pro
grams, the program is similar in
presentation to the popular "Ballad
for Americans." The concert will be
a kind of music lecture, with the
professor as speaker.
MUSICAL COMMENTARY
Mr. Allen will be assisted by Her
bert Jan Popper, pianist and direc
tor; Ted Uppman, baritone; Marjo
rie Benson, soprano; members of
the University Choir, Stanford Band,
Opera Workshop; and the classes on
music, speech and dance and the
march. These will provide musical
commnetary on the lecture.
The musical illustrations will
consist of march rhythms and
march songs that have been influen
tial in history and which have influ
enced politics.
ALLEN CITES EXAMPLES
Mr. Allen gives as an example
the Idealistic March: Ode to Joy (9th
Symphony) by Schiller - Beethoven,
which was contemporary with the
Rush-Bagot Agreement. "While the
Germans sang about brotherhood,"
Professor Allen explains, "Canada
and the United States put it into
practical effect in politics and
boundary settlements."
This is the final program in the
Tuesday Evening Series for the
quarter. The series will bo resumed
on June 23.
