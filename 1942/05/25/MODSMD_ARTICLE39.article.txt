# '42 Footballers Look Promising In Spring Final
## 
### 
It's just a question of having the
players around next fallâ€”that's how
Coach Jim Lawson summed up Sat
urday's spring football finale,, which,
incidentally, was viewed by 2500
spectators- The new Indian machine
apparently was good enough to elicit
this declaration from Lawson, who
usually is just fairly optimistic
about his squad's chances.
The practice brought forth small,
speedy halfbacks, enough good full
backs led by Buck Fawcett, who
was a halfback last year, a profu
sion of big linemen, and more good
ends than Jim would have admitted
when practice began six weeks ago.
Ray Hammett, after studying
Frankie Albert's quarterbacking
technique for two seasons, ran the
first eleven to a score over the third
squad on a 17-yard jaunt by Hoot
Armstrong, a 20-yard blast around
right end by Fawcett, and finally
Hammett's 20-yard heave to end
Bob Hall for the touchdown.
lIAMMETT MAKES COKE
The first-string starters notched
another score before Lawson called
for the second and fourth squads,
when Hammett snuck through the
middle on a quarterback sneak for
five yards.
A1 Cole handled the second team,
passing 25 yards to fullback Bob
Frisbee who raced the final five
yards for the second team's score.
The first team returned after a
short respite, and Armstrong turned
in the neatest runs of the day, gal
loping 36 yards off tackle, then slid
ing through guard for 16 more and
a touchdown.
LAPRADE ON SIDELINES
Loren LaPrade, regular guard, was
sidelined with poison oak rash and
Roger Laverty, end, stayed out with
a bad ankle. Milt Vucinich, moved
in from fullback, handled center
very well, as did Jim McCurdy,
frosh.
Fred Boensch, who tips the scales
around 240. busted into the two first
teams' backfield several times, and
with a little more consistency will
make a great lineman.
Two of the new backs, A1 Hoisch
and Jim Pettit, flashed plenty of
speed but lacked smoothness in
carrying out their assignments.
