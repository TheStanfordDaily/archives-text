# Indians Lose Crew Revival Race to Cal
## 
### 
California-Stanford crew rivalry
returned to (he sports menu Satur
day as the Bears flashed to a five
length victory in the firs( meeting of
(he (wo grudge contenders since
1922. The Redskins and (heir make
shift crew were nevertheless im
pressive as they jumped into a lead
at the start but were passed up by
the smooth-working California vet
erans.
In the loss, the Indians, however,
gained the equipment they need
when Cal's Ky Ebright presented
two shells to Nemo Pedersen, one
from California and the other from
AI Ulbrickson and the Washington
Huskies.
EBRIGHT SPEAKS
In making the presentation speech,
Ebright put into words the hopes of
the coast crew coaches that Stanford
will return to rowing on a full-time
basis, although that means a few
less victories for the Husky and
Bear crews. Apparently Ebright
feels that the building up of the
sport in the Bay area is worth the
risk to his veteran campaigners.
A good-sized crowd was on hand
to see the race and California car
ried out all the traditions of a win
ning crew by dumping its coxswain,
Dunny Woodbury, into the water.
Rough water kept the winner's
time down to 7:13.
NOW HAVE GOOD SHELLS
The Card oarsmen now have top
flight shells and hope to arrange a
couple of races to try out the new
shells before the quarter is over.
California was not represented by
its regular crew but the few mem
bers and others who made up the
boat showed beautiful form in the
victory over a 2000-meter course.
The Pyramids of Gizeh stretch for
GO miles south on the west bank of
the Nile and were begun in 3,000 B.C.
