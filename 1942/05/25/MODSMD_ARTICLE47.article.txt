## 
### 
Zcta Psi raptured a victory over the Legal Eagles in Friday's mural
baseball finale. Bla/.in' Sid Hayes burled the Zetes to a five-hit win, let
ting the law boys down with three walks while striking out seven.
The game was fairly tight until the last two innings, when ilie Eagles
ran their error total up to 10. while the Zetes piled up a big lead and

I won easily.
The Zetes picked up three runs in
the first inning on two singles by
Jack Ditz and Scolt Dudley and a
i double by Bud Madden.
Warren Gardner of the lawyers
i scored on Doug Giddings" single in
; the second inning. The Lawyers'
| last two runs came on singles by
Harris Robinson and an error.
Russ Wulff scorcd the circus catch
of the day by racing hard to nab
two balls that had "hit" written all
over them.
Hayes was in trouble in the fifth
when the Eagles loaded the bases,

but he pulled out of it with only
one run scored. In the final inning
Rex Sheep's infield support went to
pieces and the Zetes poured across
the plate in a bevy of runs.
The Legal Eagles showed excel
lent outfield support, but weak in
field play. Sheep's pitching, though
not matching Hayes', has improved
consistently since the begining of
the season.
