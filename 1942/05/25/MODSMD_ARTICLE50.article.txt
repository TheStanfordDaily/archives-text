# Training for Peace

WHEN we read of what the Axis is doing
toward blueprinting the post-war world for
domination under the "New Order," we cannot
help but wonder just what the United Nations
have done or are planning toward administer
ing the kind of peace they hope to make.
It has been an uphill grind for us, since we
went to war, to unify commands, to co-operate
in the production, distribution and use of war
implements and supplies, and finally, to turn
the United Nations' position from the defensive
to the offensive. We believe most everyone
was clear, after we went to war, on what we
were fighting for, but it has taken time to enun
ciate our goal and to build national morale.
The contributions of Tin Pan Alley were slow in
coming, but war songs have' been improving
steadily. Along the same lines, one of the latest
efforts of the movie industry is the excellent
picture, "Joan of Paris," which masterfully por
trays the inspired fighting and sacrificing we
must do to overcome the intolerance, the sus
picion, and the brutal deviltry which would
surely annihilate our personal and national free
dom.
There is no country in the world whose citi
zens are as individualistic as the people of the
United States, and there are no people as proud
and as jealous of their individualism. We come
and go as we please, and we will kill to protect
this right. We are doing it today, and we will
continue to do it until there is no nation on earth
with the power to threaten or overcome us.
Already, a special administration has been set
up in the Japanese cabinet to exploit occupied
areas. Today, this new administration super
vises the seizure of foodstuffs and raw materials
belonging to conguered countries, supervises
the levying of luxury taxes in the Philippines,
and the absorption of commercial establish
ments by Japanese firms.
To administer this program, Japanese youth
is being trained for leadership in the "New
Order" of Greater East Asia, which has meant
revision of the curricula of Japan's schools.
This change, which runs through the entire
educational system, states four objectivesâ€”to
fulfill the mission of empire, to train men who
are capable of carrying out the establishment of
the Greater East Asia New Order, to train men
who will be capable of leading many races, and
to develop cultural mobilization.
A Nazi school at Ordensburg is training a
select group to be exploiters of conguered terri
tories.
What are we doing? Select officers in Brit
ain are being trained for administering definite
areas of Europe. The University of Maryland
has inaugurated a course along "geopolitical"
lines, and Stanford's political science depart
ment offers a thorough study of geopolitics.
But, should we here at Stanford, and in other
major universities, not establish adeguate
courses for the training of government officials
who will be gualified to administer intelligently
the peace for which we are now fighting?
Let it not be construed that we advocate an
imitation of the Japanese and German systems.
What we suggest is the thorough training of a
government corps large enough to administer
the conguered countries until they can be
trusted to govern themselves.
