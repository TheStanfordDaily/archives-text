### AMIE REICHERT 
/ , ENERAL GIRAUD—not to be confused with Little
Gerard of the Quiz Kids—has been playing the
neatest mystery game of the week. No one seems to
know exactly what he is up to.
First of all you should know that General Henri
Honore Giraud was up until two weeks ago the Nazis'
prize French prisoner of war. They captured him
along with a lot of other generals when France fell
and they toted the pack of them off to the gloomy
prison fortress at Konigsberg.
Well, the Nazis had General Giraud locked up there
with the rest of the prisoners and they thought he was
pretty safe. But one day the head Nazi looked and
General Giraud wasn't there. And everyone got ex
cited and started looking under tables and chairs and
up on the chandeliers and so forth and still no General
Giraud.
And then somebody looked out a window and there
was a rope dangling in the breeze and reaching down
GO feet to the moat below.
And that was how General Giraud, the Daring
Old Man on the Fleeing Trapeze, escaped.
He disguised himself in civilian clothes and traveled
to Vichy, where his old friend Marshall Petain and sev
eral Nazi officials and Pierre Laval were all waiting to
greet him.
General Giraud has a record for being an ardent
Nazi-hater and a sympathizer with General De Gaulle,
and this is what makes one wonder why the Nazis
didn't immediately clap him into the Iron Maiden of
Nuremberg.
But they didn't and that is what is so mysterious.
Instead they sat him down and had conferences with
him. What was said no one really knows. What we
do know of the first few conferences is simply that
they made Giraud promise to be a good boy and swear
allegiance to Petain and promise not to aid General
De Gaulle or the Free French cause.

YESTERDAY part of the story came out. What Gi
raud wanted was this: He said he would return to
German custody on the condition that 500,000 French
prisoners of war be exchanged for him. And he further
sda ipublicly and ofr publication that he did "not trust
any German's word" and that was that.
The situation remains for the moment rather un
settled, and the mystery unsolved. No one knows why
Laval and the Nazis are bothering to dicker with
Giraud at all. Possibly the answer might be that
Laval is afraid of his people and does not dare molest
one of their old national heroes. In any event he is
keeping a lot of us guessing.
