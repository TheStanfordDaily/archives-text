"GOOD BYE, LITTLE DARLIN', GOOD BYE"
IT must to all . . ." so to you little dark lass,
it has come. You, who were a friend to many of
us, passed from among us in the cold deep dark of
early morn. Your heart burst with a loud pop, your
emotions flowed over, but the flames were not
quenched.
Phoenix-like you left us, but we feel sure that
you will rise again within shorter driving distance, and
with the same spirits you possessed before your un
timely demise.
We got to love you and your back yard. Many are
the memories and souvenirs we brought away with us,
and how we enjoyed your southern comfort.
To you came many to celebrate their great love,
while others came to forget theirs. Phi Betes and
draftees magnified pleasure or nullified pain with your
good spirits.
There was always a happy throng about you. The
Collins brothers, Tom, Rhum and John, were always
there. So were Julie Mint and that old fashioned
cousin of hers. Count Martini could always be found
there in company with his friend from Manhattan.
The lads from Milwaukee were on hand, together
with those Scots, Johnny Walker and Johnny Dewar,
and their teacher friend. What a gay crowd they were,
and how happy they could make you feel.
Now you are gone. You will not be there to play
host to us as graduates, as you have to countless
classes now gone by.
So long, see you at the corner of Palm Drive and
El Camino Real.

STANFORDITE, honored by Phi Beta Kappa, made
president of Tau Beta Pi and his own fraternity,
and member of our Intercollegiate Championship golf
team, was shaken to his boot strings the other day.
A phone call came to his house that a suspicious
character, apparently up to no good and quite shifty
looking, was trying to cash a check in Palo Alto by
using our Phi Bete's identification, but was writing
the Tau Bete's name very badly or incorrectly.
Upon returning home, the golfer was told of this
situation and was surprised to find that he was in the
same store at the same time, trying to cash a check
himself. In fact, he could not recall that there was any
one else in the store at all.
