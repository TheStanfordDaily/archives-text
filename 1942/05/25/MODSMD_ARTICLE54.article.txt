# CAMPUS OPINION
## ON THE HONOR CODE 
### 
r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is my two-bits worth on Stanford's Honor
Code controversy—sue me if I'm wrong.
Can one actually blame Stanford students for cheat
ing right and left when some sections are so crowded
that neighbors practically sit in one another's laps
when taking an exam? It is all very well to talk about
honesty and individual co-operation of the students,
but, unfortunately, we are not a race of gods and can
not be expected to conduct ourselves as such. It seems
to me" that the student who cheats under such circum
stances is far less to blame than a system which con
tinually tempts him to cheat.
What a wonderful world this would be if we didn't
have to put a curb on people's activities—each would
go happily on his way, doing no harm and suffering
none. But people just aren't built that way. Dangle a
piece of hamburger in front of a hungry dog long
enough, place it a centimeter or so from his snoot,
practically beg him to eat the meat and I Ifave some
thing of a sneaking suspicion that he would.
Building character is not a matter of so much talk.
Many of our "good" people have never been sub
jected to tlie temptations which made our "bad"
people "bad." In the last analysis we are, with a few
exceptions, all the same. If, after the faculty has made
all reasonable efforts to correct the seating, my neigh
bor stretches his neck a couple of feet to "compare
answers," I'll turn him in on the spot. But as long as
he's in a spot very much like I could be in and has
the opportunity to cheat practically handed out to him
on a silver platter, I would not turn him in. possibly j
to be expelled, just because the faculty runs around |
with the naive idea that men are perfect. I'd like to ;
crowd our faculty together in an exam to determine
whether a given member would keep his job; those I
on the short end. I believe, v/ould "cheat." They, too,
are human.

r jPHE EDITOR, SIR:
This is my two-bits worth on Stanford's Honor
Code controversy—sue me if I'm wrong.
Can one actually blame Stanford students for cheat
ing right and left when some sections are so crowded
that neighbors practically sit in one another's laps
when taking an exam? It is all very well to talk about
honesty and individual co-operation of the students,
but, unfortunately, we are not a race of gods and can
not be expected to conduct ourselves as such. It seems
to me" that the student who cheats under such circum
stances is far less to blame than a system which con
tinually tempts him to cheat.
What a wonderful world this would be if we didn't
have to put a curb on people's activities—each would
go happily on his way, doing no harm and suffering
none. But people just aren't built that way. Dangle a
piece of hamburger in front of a hungry dog long
enough, place it a centimeter or so from his snoot,
practically beg him to eat the meat and I Ifave some
thing of a sneaking suspicion that he would.
Building character is not a matter of so much talk.
Many of our "good" people have never been sub
jected to tlie temptations which made our "bad"
people "bad." In the last analysis we are, with a few
exceptions, all the same. If, after the faculty has made
all reasonable efforts to correct the seating, my neigh
bor stretches his neck a couple of feet to "compare
answers," I'll turn him in on the spot. But as long as
he's in a spot very much like I could be in and has
the opportunity to cheat practically handed out to him
on a silver platter, I would not turn him in. possibly j
