"America is certainly a swell country, and it has at least one foreign
admirer, to-wit—myself," wrote Jack Margetts, 27-year-old Britisher, to
Jim Cooper, Chi Psi.
Jack is one of 50 Englishmen who were receiving basic flying train
ing in Los Angeles where Jim met him. He dropped out of training, went

to Canada to study navigation, and,
is now in Leeds, England, finishing
his admittance requirements for the
army air corps as navigator.
"You see quite a lot of darned
trousers and shirts, but generally
speaking the standard of dress does
not seem to have fallen as yet, in
spite of rationing," he declared. Jack
said that it was surprising how
quickly people got accustomed to ra
tioning.
INITIAL STRANGENESS
"I suppose you will have got over
the initial strangeness of being at
war. So much has happened to me
since the time we came into the
war, it is rather difficult to recall
how one felt."
Concerning the food situation,
Margetts said, "we also expected to
go short of food, but rationing came
in gradually and we did not notice
it. Today we get enough to eat but
have learned to be satisfied with
less."
CAR PROBLEM
About cars he wrote, "Your terrific
propensity to road travel will, I sup
pose, present a problem as the roads
will have to be kept cleared for
military traffic and supplies."
And California apparently made
some impression on Margetts, too,
for he winds up his letter remarking,
"In the canteen this morning some
of the blokes are talking of a new
film in London, "Week-end in Ha
vana." I saw this shot at Fox Stu
dios and it was rather interesting to
hear that it is considered very good
over here. The actors did not think
much of it at the time. This Holly
wood line of mine is very useful,
enables you to be quite an asset at
a party."

war. So much has happened to me
since the time we came into the
war, it is rather difficult to recall
how one felt."
Concerning the food situation,
Margetts said, "we also expected to
go short of food, but rationing came
in gradually and we did not notice
it. Today we get enough to eat but
have learned to be satisfied with
less."
CAR PROBLEM
About cars he wrote, "Your terrific
propensity to road travel will, I sup
pose, present a problem as the roads
will have to be kept cleared for
military traffic and supplies."
And California apparently made
some impression on Margetts, too,
for he winds up his letter remarking,
"In the canteen this morning some
of the blokes are talking of a new
film in London, "Week-end in Ha
vana." I saw this shot at Fox Stu
dios and it was rather interesting to
hear that it is considered very good
over here. The actors did not think
much of it at the time. This Holly
wood line of mine is very useful,
enables you to be quite an asset at
a party."
"America is certainly a swell country, and it has at least one foreign
admirer, to-wit—myself," wrote Jack Margetts, 27-year-old Britisher, to
Jim Cooper, Chi Psi.
Jack is one of 50 Englishmen who were receiving basic flying train
ing in Los Angeles where Jim met him. He dropped out of training, went

to Canada to study navigation, and,
is now in Leeds, England, finishing
his admittance requirements for the
army air corps as navigator.
"You see quite a lot of darned
trousers and shirts, but generally
speaking the standard of dress does
not seem to have fallen as yet, in
spite of rationing," he declared. Jack
said that it was surprising how
quickly people got accustomed to ra
tioning.
INITIAL STRANGENESS
"I suppose you will have got over
the initial strangeness of being at
war. So much has happened to me
since the time we came into the
war, it is rather difficult to recall
how one felt."

Margetts said, "we also expected to
