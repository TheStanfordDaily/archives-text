# Paul Pendarvis' Orchestra Will Play at '42 Senior Ball
## 
### 
Making a last-minute change in the itinerary of his eastern summer
lour, Paul Pendarvis will bring his band to Stanford for the Class of '42's
Senior Ball instead of previously-scheduled Jimmy Grier, it was revealed
by the committee last night.
Originally the first choice of the seniors, Pendarvis could not fit the

engagement into his scheduled tour.
Arrangements then made with Grier
were cancelled Saturday when Pen
darvis informed the committee he
had made the change so that he
could play for the Stanford seniors'
last campus dance.
Bids will go on sale tomorrow
morning at the A.S.S.U. office for
$(3.60, lower by $1.65 than the price
of last year's ball.
The price of the bid includes, ad
mission to the dance, breakfast for
both members of the couple, re
freshments during the dance, and a
souvenir favor for the women.
The ball will be held, as in the
past, in Toyon lobby; breakfast will
be served in Branner dining hall.
The date also follows traditional
practice, the Friday night before
commencement from 10:30 to 4.
Sale of bids will be restricted the
first three days, tomorrow, Wednes
day, and Thursday, to seniors grad
uating during the year 1942. If
there are any bids left at this time,
sale will be opened to all graduates
receiving degrees at the June Com
mencement.
