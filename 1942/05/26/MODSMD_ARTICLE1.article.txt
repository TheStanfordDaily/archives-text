led by 150 tanks and supported by
long trains of armored cars and mor
tar and artillery units.
For two days the Red Army has
resisted steadily increasing pressure
around Izyum-Barvenka, a front
line dispatch said, as the Germans
apparently endeavored to breach the
Soviet lines there at all cost to re
lieve pressure on the Kharkov front,
where the invaders have landed tiny
tanks by air in the continuing battle.
The German assaults were report
ed continuing despite a terrific cost
in manpower and materials.
The Monday midnight Soviet
communique said savage tank and
infantry fighting continued before
Kharkov and, for the first time in
the two-week battle that began as a
Russian offensive, failed to specify
which side had the upper hand.
Naval planes of the Soviet north
ern fleet have sunk two German de
stroyers and an 8,000-ton transport
in enemy waters near their bases in
the last few days and scored four
direct bomb hits on a third destroy
er which probably went down, the
