# Salvage Drive Reaches Climax
## 
### 
Spring housecleaning for Stanford
living groups is advocated by Ed
Porter, Farm salvage chairman, for
the all-campus drive this week-end
for scrap materials for America's
war effort. Metals, paper, rags, and
rubber are the materials especially
desired.
"Fraternities will have their last
Saturday work day for sophomores
this week-end," Porter said. "It
seems to be an excellent opportunity
for houses to clean out their base
ments and attics before the end of
the quarter."
Collections from fraternities will
|be made Saturday morning be
tween 10 and 12 so all material
cleaned out would be taken away
immediately and would not clutter
up alleys of fraternities, he added.
Students in men's halls will be as
sisted by their corridor representa
tives who will help them gather up
their scrap material and deposit it
for collection Saturday morning by
a Peninsula Sanitary Company
truck
Collections at women's residences
are being worked out by Dinny
Sick, sororities; Susan Wright, La-
gunita; Callie Curtiss, Roble; and
Martha Ann Cass, Union.
