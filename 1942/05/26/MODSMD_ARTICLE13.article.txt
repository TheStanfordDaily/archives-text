# CHANCELLOR BLOCKS EASTERN TRIPS
## Board Recommendations Vetoed; Students To Seek Private Funds Subscriptions Sought to Finance Trip to Championship Matches 
### BOB SONTAG 
Larry Dec, Ed Stamm, and Frank Tatum, members of Stanford's ten
nis, track, and golf teams, will go before Ex Committee tonight to ask
approval of a private subscription campaign to raise funds for sending
Redskin representatives to eastern national championships this summer.
After Chancellor Wilbur's rejection of the B.A.C. recommendation for

the trips, the only way left open is
by private donations, and all mem
bers of the squads and their coaches
gave hearty approval to the move.
Frank Tatum, who will represent
the golf team, said yesterday it
would be useless for Stanford to de
fend its championship unless a full
four-man team is sent.
"The trip is very expensive," Ta
tum added, "but we are going lo try
this plan anyway. Most of the boys
are going into the service soon and
will give what they can to help
push it along."
Said Pitch Johnson, Stanford's
track coach:
"I'd like to see a couple of the
boys go to the nationals. I believe
Ed Hertel is one of the finest hurd
lers I have ever seen and Ed Stamm
one of the greatest shot putters.
Both boys would have good chances
of bringing firsts back to the Farm
in their respective events."
Of the three teams ,track would be
the easiest to finance. After 10 per
cent of the gate receipts are deducted
by the N.C.A.A., the remainder is
given to team participants, which
would help defray expenses for
Stamm and Hertel.
Johnnie Lamb, Farm tennis coach,
added his approval:
"In Ted Schroeder and Larry Dee
we have a doubles team capablc of
matching any combination in the
United States. I realize the reason
for financial curtailments arc very
good, but representation at the ten
nis nationals will boom Stanford
athletics, which have always been of
the highest standards and have al
ways been at hand when champion
ship material makes up an Indian
team."
