WHILE it is unfortunate the University cannot afford to send
representatives to the National Collegiate Athletic Associa
tion championships next month, as explained by Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur's farsighted statement in the column at right, there
is still a possibility Stanford athletes will travel to these important
events.
"If funds can be obtained for these purposes by private sub
scriptions," Dr. Wilbur states, "we should, of course, be very glad
to see the University represented by the superior athletes avail
able."
It should be understood, through this statement, that the
University is maintaining its policy of financial retrenchment in
hopes of carrying out a long-range athletic program geared to
survive for the duration. It is obvious, of course, that this state
ment leaves recourse for the athletes to appeal to interested per
sons for contributions to assist them in personally meeting ex
penses.
Stanford's golf team is not only tops in the nation, but will
defend its championship next month. Every effort should be
made and every assistance given to see that the men get to South
Bend. If Stanford wins again this year, it will be the fourth team
championship in five years.
If as few as two and as many as four members of the track
team go to the Intercollegiates there is every indication they
will be able to give such outstanding performances that the
N.C.A.A. will subsequently give them a percentage of the gate
receipts to pay expenses.
The tennis team boasts an imposing record. Larry Dee and
Jimmy Wade are former national doubles champions, and Ted
Schroeder last year won the doubles crown with Jack Kramer of
Los Angeles. Dee and Schroeder will play together if they travel
to New Orleans this year.
With such outstanding athletes available, Stanford should
make every effort to send them East. Three important alumni
have already signified their willingness to give all possible
financial assistance.
We heartily endorse the appeal these men will make to Ex
Committee tonight.

Bend. If Stanford wins again this year, it will be the fourth team
championship in five years.
If as few as two and as many as four members of the track
team go to the Intercollegiates there is every indication they
will be able to give such outstanding performances that the
N.C.A.A. will subsequently give them a percentage of the gate
receipts to pay expenses.
The tennis team boasts an imposing record. Larry Dee and
Jimmy Wade are former national doubles champions, and Ted
Schroeder last year won the doubles crown with Jack Kramer of
Los Angeles. Dee and Schroeder will play together if they travel
to New Orleans this year.
With such outstanding athletes available, Stanford should
make every effort to send them East. Three important alumni
have already signified their willingness to give all possible
financial assistance.
We heartily endorse the appeal these men will make to Ex
Committee tonight.
