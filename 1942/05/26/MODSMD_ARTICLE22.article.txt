### HAROLD SHAFER 
Members of Stanford's golf, track and tennis teams will not lie sent by
(be B<mi (l of Athletic Control to the eastern N.C.A.A. championships, nor
will members of the national championship Indian basketball team be
given gold wrist watches in recognition of their achievements.
The final decision was announced yesterday by Chancellor Kay Lyman

â–ºWilbur, after rejecting the Board
jof Athletic Control's recommenda
i tion that the trips and watches he
granted. The B.A.C. met Saturday
in special session, at the request of
the student members, to reconsider
the B.A.C.s previous decision not to
send the teams or grant the watches.
It was at Saturday's meeting the
board reversed its earlier recom
mendation.
Had the B.A.C.'s recommendation
been approved, expenses would have
been paid for five golfers traveling
next month to the N.C.A.A. cham
pionships at Notre Dame in South
Bend, Ind.; for sending four tennis
men to the N.C.A.A. matches in New
Orleans; and for sending two track
stars to the N.C.A.A. meet in Lin
coln, Neb. In addition, watches
would have been given the 11 bas
ketball players and one manager
who traveled to the championship in
Kansas City.
Under the basketball rules, the
champions would have been awarded
gold basketballs by the 8.A.C., but
since they received gold basketballs
in Kansas City, the board will prob
ably make some other "suitable
award in their place, A1 Masters,
graduate manager, stated yesterday.
Dr. Wilbur released the following
statement to the press yesterday,
after taking action on the B.A.C.
minutes:
"There is a sharp difference of
opinion between the members of the
Board of Athletic Control as to the
advisability of our athletes taking
trips to distant points and of pro
viding special souvenirs for our
championship basketball team.
"It certainly would be gratifying if
we had sufficient funds to make it
possible to do all of the things we
should like to do. Unfortunately,
though, our whole athletic structure
has gone to war and we must oper
ate from here on with entirely dif
ferent conceptions, both as to pur
pose and as to expenditure. The
military authorities have recom
mended that we provide physical
training in some form, including
participation in competitive games.
Frankly, from now on we must op
erate either on a deficit basis, which
if carried on for some time would
mean the destruction of our athletic
organizations, or upon a very cau
tious and compressed financial pro
gram, which is probably still pos
sible under war conditions, at least
for some time. We have some re
serves to carry us through a short
period. Under these circumstances
it seems to me that wc should main
tain our reserves, avoid excess ex
penditures, and be ready for any
emergency that may develop.
"Consequently I have not approved
of that part of the Board of Athletic
Control minutes where a divided
vote has given approval of these
avoidable expenditures. If funds can
be obtained for these purposes by
private subscriptions we should, of
course, be very glad to see the Uni
versity represented by the superior
athletes available."
