# Scholarship Committee Lists Graduation Honors
## 
### 
Dr. Phillip W. Buck, chairman of (ho Scholarship Committee, today re
leased the list of names lor graduation honors.
Speaking for the Scholarship Committee, I)r. Buck explained the hasis
on which the awards of Gieai Distinction and Distinction are made so
that it will he clearly understood by the University community.

He said that because of differences
in subject matter, teaching methods,
average size of classes, and methods
of evaluating performance, the sen
iors are grouped according to
schools, with the Education, Pre-
Lej'.al. and Pre-Business curricula
included in the Social Sciences, and
Nursing in Biological Sciences.
1.1.K MJII.ITY ESTABLISHED
A indent establishes eligibility for
consideration by (1) a B average for
tlie total Stanford record, and (2)
4f> units of advanced courses
(courses numbered 100 or above)
during the final six quarters. Stu
dent". lacking 45 units of advanced
Work may be brought to the atten
tion of the committee by depart
mental nomination.
The seniors of each school are
ranked acocrding to their grade
point rating, to which is added 10
points it their department recom
mends them, and 20 points if their
department names them as their
first choice for honors. The grade
point laitng is computed for their
last live or six quarters, and ex
cludes incompletes, deferred credit,
plus grades, and grades in physical
education, choir, oratorio, or band.
<?il.\T DISTINCTION
Awards of Great Distinction are
made to the live per cent with the
highest grade-point ratings plus
bonuses, in each school. Similarly,
awards of Distinction are made to
the next ranking ten per cent in each
school. This means that the high
arid low ratings fluctuate from
school to school, but for the reasons
given above, this seems to be the
most equitable basis for such awards.
The range for the schools this year,
including bonus points from depart
mental recommendations, from high
to low, ran as follows: Letters, 4.0(5-

3.G0; Biological Science, 4.0(5-3.15;
Physical Science, 4.19-3.62; Social
Science, 4.20-3.08; Engineering,
4.00-3.27.
