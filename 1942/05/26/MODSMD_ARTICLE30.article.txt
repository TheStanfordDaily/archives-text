## 
### HELEN LIVINGSTON 
The hack hall of the Memorial Theater is seething with activity these
days as Mrs. Helen Green's, costume class, under tin* direction of Elena
Madison and Dolly Miller, puts Uie finishing touches on the costumes for
"He Who Gets Slapped," to he presented May 2X, 2!). and'ilO.
According to Mrs. Green, it is no easy job to convey the feeling of

tragedy to the audience and create,
the atmosphere of a circus at the
same time, and thus her designs for
the production took a great deal of
time and thought.
USES BRIGHT COLORS
The solution she worked out with
Waldemar Johansen, who designed
the settings, allows her perfect free
dom to use the bright colors and
exaggerated lines of circus costumes,
for when the tragic aspects of the
play become intense the colors will
be darkened by the tricky use of
lighting.
Mrs. Green has attempted to con
vey in her use of color and texture
the symbolism of Andreyev's play
and of the characters in the play.
The passionate, intense Zinida will
wear a lion-tamer's costume of cloth
of gold, while the delicate Consuelo
dresses in pink net. In the last act
he is told his costume "bums like all
the devils in hell," and accordingly
his clown dress is made to simulate
flames.
CLOWNS CONVENTIONAL
For the other clowns Mrs. Green
is using the same devices as actual
clowns in circuses, rubber balls for
their noses, on faces smeared with
white grease paint, huge grinning
mouths, and amazing pink wigs.
