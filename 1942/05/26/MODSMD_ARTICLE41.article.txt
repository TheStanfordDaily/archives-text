it is getting near the end
of the publication year and since j
a new man will be appointed to this !
job today, I figured that this would
be as good a time to reminisce as
any.
Looking hack over the sports
year, the thing that strikes the
eye first is the presence of three
national championship teams on
the Stanford campus.
What is even more striking,
however, is the fact that only one '
of the three has gotten the chance
to go hack to the national tourna
ment for the respective sports, and
thereby show the nation their su
periority.
The basketball team was given a
chance to compete against the na
tion's best, and despite many injuries
they came through. In fact they
outclassed the teams they met.
The tennis and golf teams, hav
ing won their conference titles
easily, have earned the right to
represent the coast in the N.C.A.A. 1
golf tourney in South Bend and
the Intercollegiate tennis tourney
in New Orleans. However, due to j
present conditions the school is
evidently unable to send them
east.
Now the rest of the country will
just have to take our word that our
net and tee teams have no peers.

r jpHE custom for all outgoing sports
editors is to save their last col
umn for a tearful good-by, and a
few paragraphs of thanks to those
who have so faithfully served them
during their stay in office.
Something big may come up
Friday that I want to write about,
so I thought I'd get this out of the
way now.
First, its been grand; don't think
it hasn't.
Second, thanks to the following
men who have scurried around all
quarter gathering news, never ask
ing for any glory, and never getting
any: Bob Sontag, for his coverage
of basketball and spring football
practice; Bob Walt, varsity baseball;
Bill Hornby, frosh basketball, frosh
baseball, golf, and anything else
that might come up; Dick Keusink,
rugby, soccer, and polo; Ferris
Boothe, swimming and water polo;
Newt Wise, intramural this, intra
mural that, and intramural the other
thing; Hal Shafer, B.A.C. coverage;
Bill Dillinger and Ches Saroyan and
Irma Cunha, tennis â€”varsity, frosh,
women's, faculty, etc.; Ed Conn, frosh
track; and anybody else who did
anything worth while.

FOLLOWING are the results of a
twilight intramural meet held in
San Francisco Saturday: O'Neil, in
dependent, 84; McClelland, inde
pendent, 60; Myers, independent. 51;
Hampson, independent, 43; Allan, in
dependent, 34; Collier, independent,
25; Driscoll, independent, 21; Miller,
damned independent, 20; Hastings,
independent, 19; Thoreau, independ
ent, 11V 2 .
Even though O'Neil was ruled in
eligible for use of illegal equipment,
the Independents won the team title
handily.
