# A 						Book for a Diploma
## 
### 
ANOTHER plan by which the nation's col
lege students can contribute additional aid
toward the war effort has been developed by
the Victory Book Campaign's Commencement
Day Committee.
What it suggests is that every graduating
student will appear at Commencement with a
book, autographed by himself or herself, for
some fellow-American who is fighting or pre
paring to fight for his country.
"If possible, writes the committee, "let all the
books be stacked in some conspicuous place—
perhaps at the very foot of the rostrum. This
generous gathering of the books for use will
contrast vividly with- the notorious burning of
the books by the Nazis on May 10, 1933."
Each senior's book, then, might be regarded
as a symbolic ticket of admission to Commence
ment in return for which he receives his di
ploma. The personal autograph would help to
assure books of some worth, and might also lead
to a friendly correspondence—a sore want for
thousands of soldiers away from home.
The committee further suggests that a read
ing of the following passage from Milton's
Areopagitica" might be an appropriate preface
to the stacking of the books:
"Books are not absolutely dead things, but
do contain a potency ot life in them to be as
active as that soul was whose progeny they
are; nay, they do preserve as in a vial the
purest efficacy and extraction of that living
intellect that bred them. 1 know they are as
lively, and as vigorously productive, as those
fabulous dragon's teeth; and being sown up
and down, may chance to spring up armed
men."
The bringing of autographed books, including
seniors' home addresses, might be recom
mended by Ex Committee tonight to all gradu
ating seniors and to the Public Exercises Com
mittee for this year's Stanford Commencement.
