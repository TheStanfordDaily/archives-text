# War as a Leveler
## 
### 
PEOPLE are beginning to wonder what social
trends will come out of this war. According
to observers of the London scene, deep-cutting
developments are taking place which may lead
to permanent changes in class relationships.
The war has smashed social barriers in Eng
land. It is going to be tough for the lower
classes to go back to looking through the pales
of the estates after tasting equality during the
war. They will have a perfectly valid argument
in the fact that they contributed their share to
the war and, in return, deserve their share from
the peace.
According to Virgil Pinkley, observing war
time England for United Press, the people "seem
more fraternal . . . less cold and stiff."
Thousands of people who never worked with
their hands are now at farm labor and factory
work. Income tax was paid by 800,000 people
before the war; today the total is nearly 6,000,-
000. Family and education no longer deter
mine who shall fly in the R.A.F., who shall not.
Most of these trends are temporary; but Eng
land is certainly not going to go back to pre
war days completely. The people will be too
tired to go very far to the left; but there will
be a great deal of social legislation. The war
stirred social and political consciousness of the
people will cause this legislation.
Some of the new measures will be indirect.
For instance, the housing problem. Bombings
have done enough damage to require construc
tion of 350,000 houses annually for ten years
after the war.
Other trends will be more direct. Among
these may be control of quick profits and in
terest charges, or the establishment of a national
minimum wage.
As soon as the present conflict is over we
will begin to see if war can be a permanent
leveler.- Hap Everett
