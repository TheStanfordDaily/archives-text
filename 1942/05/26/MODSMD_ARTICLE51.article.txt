### AMIE REICHERT 
r pHE San Francisco papers were having a field day
yesterday smearing the good mayor of San Fran
cisco, Angelo J. Rossi. They have been waiting for
this a long time and I can t say I exactly blame them,
but the trouble with the whole business is that thus
itii the only lesults of the smear-Rossi campaign have
been to make the Tenney committee and the press look
awfully silly.
There are a lot of things they might have gotten
Angelo J. Rossi on but they were all short of being
enough to kick him out of office. For years San
Francisco city government has been not only corrupt
but inefficient—and that combination is inexcusable.
Just how great and terrible was this ineffiicency
was demonstrated last year when San Francisco had
its first few blackouts. The sirens couldn't be heard
and nobody could find the mayor and the chief of
police was up on a hill watching instead of being in
his office and the civilian defense was nonexistent and
the whole thing was a frightful mess.
After the whole thing was over and the newspapers
were gunning for the good mayor, somebody asked him
what he would have done if planes had really been
over the city.
Oh,' he said blithely, "we would have turned on
the lights and gone to work!"
When I* iorello LaGuardia came out here to inspect
the civilian defense set-up, he thought so much of
Mayor Rossi's capabilities, that he appointed the mayor
of Oakland regional director of the program. This
burned everyone up, of course, because Oakland is
always trying to be as big as San Francisco.

as I say, they might have gotten Rossi out
on this, or on the Stanford beating cpse, or on
any number of city issues he has bumbled, but I
guess they didn't have quite enough on him.
Now the San Francisco papers have gone after their
fuddy-duddy mayor with a vehemence that can only
be born of long suffering and protracted gripes. Be
cause the smearing that accompanies the charge is
ludicrous.
They say Rossi once gave the Fascist salute. Yes,
really. In Dreamland Auditorium. He raised his hand
and lo and behold it was a Fascist salute.
They say it in bold black headlines. The Tenney
Committee is saying it and, I suppose, trying to prove
the mayor is pro-Fascist and a fifth-columnist.
I don't think the mayor of San Francisco even
knows what Fascism is. In fact, I'm not sure he even
knows there is a war going on.
The Tenney Committee will have to pin a lot more
on Angelo J. than a Fascist salute—he was probably
just waving to a friend. Thus far they haven't brought
out any more evidence against the mayor. But tomor
row he takes the stand, and that ought to be fun.

really. In Dreamland Auditorium. He raised his hand
and lo and behold it was a Fascist salute.
They say it in bold black headlines. The Tenney
Committee is saying it and, I suppose, trying to prove
the mayor is pro-Fascist and a fifth-columnist.
I don't think the mayor of San Francisco even
knows what Fascism is. In fact, I'm not sure he even
knows there is a war going on.
The Tenney Committee will have to pin a lot more
on Angelo J. than a Fascist salute—he was probably
just waving to a friend. Thus far they haven't brought
out any more evidence against the mayor. But tomor
row he takes the stand, and that ought to be fun.
r pHE San Francisco papers were having a field day
yesterday smearing the good mayor of San Fran
cisco, Angelo J. Rossi. They have been waiting for
this a long time and I can t say I exactly blame them,
but the trouble with the whole business is that thus
itii the only lesults of the smear-Rossi campaign have
been to make the Tenney committee and the press look
awfully silly.
There are a lot of things they might have gotten
Angelo J. Rossi on but they were all short of being
enough to kick him out of office. For years San
Francisco city government has been not only corrupt
but inefficient—and that combination is inexcusable.
Just how great and terrible was this ineffiicency
was demonstrated last year when San Francisco had
its first few blackouts. The sirens couldn't be heard
and nobody could find the mayor and the chief of
police was up on a hill watching instead of being in
his office and the civilian defense was nonexistent and
the whole thing was a frightful mess.
After the whole thing was over and the newspapers
were gunning for the good mayor, somebody asked him
what he would have done if planes had really been
over the city.
Oh,' he said blithely, "we would have turned on
the lights and gone to work!"
When I* iorello LaGuardia came out here to inspect
the civilian defense set-up, he thought so much of
Mayor Rossi's capabilities, that he appointed the mayor
of Oakland regional director of the program. This
burned everyone up, of course, because Oakland is
always trying to be as big as San Francisco.

as I say, they might have gotten Rossi out
on this, or on the Stanford beating cpse, or on
any number of city issues he has bumbled, but I
guess they didn't have quite enough on him.
Now the San Francisco papers have gone after their
fuddy-duddy mayor with a vehemence that can only
be born of long suffering and protracted gripes. Be
cause the smearing that accompanies the charge is
ludicrous.
They say Rossi once gave the Fascist salute. Yes,
really. In Dreamland Auditorium. He raised his hand
and lo and behold it was a Fascist salute.
