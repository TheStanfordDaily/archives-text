ROOMMATES

jyOT UNTIL the other day did I ever stop to think
about my room mates. Just so long as their
Vitalis was in its proper place and while they had an
adequate supply of shoe polish, I really never gave
them much thought.
Then the other day one of them announced that
he was the second most physically fit man in the uni
versity, at least among those so far tested. He had
been chosen to represent our group in Physical Fit
ness tests and had evidently come out with flying
colors. I am really quite proud of him.
I therefore decided to get to know my room mates
better. I found out their names in the Quad, learned
that one was a sophomore and the other a senior, and
thereupon set about meeting them.
I questioned the next three people who came into
my room to fill their pens but none was my room
mate. I then decided upon a strategy. I concealed
myself beneath a pair of trousers that definitely were
not mine, and waited.
I felt sure that whoever picked them up would
surely be one of my room mates. After about an hour
and three-quarters wait they were suddenly lifted up
and I greeted the fellow as a room mate only to find
that it was the house manager out collecting the June
board bills.
I thought that perhaps if I left a little message on
my note paper asking them to communicate with me,
I would be sure to get hold of one. A week later I
got a letter from a girl in Omaha demanding alimony.
Then the idea came to me. I would study, in my
room, and see who else was there. I crept in about
nine and saw two people huddled over books. I
rushed to them joyously, and shook their hands. Was
I surprised to find that they were F. 8.1, agents look
ing for fifth columnists.
The problem finally solved itself. A package ar
rived for me one morning, and as I carried it up to
my room, it started to gurgle. Try as I did to muffle
it, the noise was nevertheless heard. As I tore off the
wrappings my room mates appeared. I stopped, in
troduced myself, and went on with the unwrapping.
I pulled it from its final sheath of paper, a bottle of
Pluto Water.
Well, evidently disappointed, they quickly drifted
away. I haven't seen them since, but even that brief
meeting was pleasant. My tooth paste is still going
at a rate indicative of three people's use, and the
Vitalis is still on hand, so they must be still there.
