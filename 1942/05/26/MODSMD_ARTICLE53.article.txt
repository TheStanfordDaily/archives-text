more honor com:

r jniE EDITOR, SIR:
This morning a letter I wrote to you appeared
in Campus Opinion after a deletion had been made;
this deletion, I feel, contained more or less the most
important point I had tried to make in connection with
the Honor Code, and brings things down from gen
erality to concreteness.
My reference to "cheaters" was not applied to all
students. I said that when the stakes are high —
when a person will either pass or fail on the basis of
one examination—as a general rule everyone can be
easily tempted to take an answer from someone else's
paper, especially when he has no barrier to overcome
and the answer is within a sidelong glance. I do not
mean that the student who doesn't have to will
cheat; I am merely saying that we can all ration
alize ourselves around conscience "when the need
arises." Consequently, the "honest, moral" student is
no "better" than the "dishonest" one—it's usually a
question of the different necessities and influences
which acted upon the two. If we only have the cour
age to admit it, we have our individual "moral skele
tons" in the closet of our minds; this applies to all of
us even though we don't choose to make the rattle
any more audible than we have to. So let's not at
tribute our unchallenged "virtues" to superior moral
fiber—such a commodity doesn't exist because every
j one has the same grade fiber be it A or D. An un
j challenged castle with decaying walls may stand up
j whereas a - bombed granite castle won't.
