# 'He' to Open At Stanford Tomorrow
## Ted Marcuse Takes Title Role in Russian Tragedy of 'Big Top' 
### 
"See the lovely, the beautiful, the
glamorous Consuclo, famous bare
back rider, sec Zcnida the lady lion
tamer, in tbc greatest show on
earth!"
The circus has come to Stanford,
and the tragedy of life behind the
scenes of a European circus comes
to life Thursday with the opening
performance of the Russian play, "He
Who Gets Slapped."
Ted Marcuse as "He" and Jacques
Poley as Consuelo, the equestrienne
queen, share top honors in the pl;iy.
LIGHTING EFFECTS
Because of the flexibility which
Andreyev gave his play, F. Cowles
Strickland, the director, will utilize
distinctive lighting effects, costum
ing, and sets to produce the illusion
of another world.
Mrs. Helen Green has designed the
costumes of the play, using bright
colors and exaggerated lines to fit
the distinctive set produced by Wal
demar Johansen.
The plot of "He" is woven around
a disillusioned writer who walks out
on his own world to find comfort
from the slaps life has given him in
the unreality of the circus. He finds
love, but must contend with John
High, his lover's father, who wishes
her to marry Gordon Peterson, a
wealthy baron.
CIRCUS ATMOSPHERE
The circus atmosphere is com
plete with Marcia Shaughnessy as
the lady lion tamer, Roscoe Jones as
the circus manager, and various
clowns and circus performers: Jeanne
Smith, Pamela Walker, Russell Bry
an, Charlotte Drea, Robert Bettin
court, John Lawry, and Paul Hos
tetler.
In "He Who Gets Slapped," as the
final production of the year, Mr.
Strickland has carried out his policy
to present to Stanford audiences
varied aspects of the theater. This
play he describes as a symphony of
the theater which will present any
number of interpretations and any
number of meanings depending upon
the individual.
