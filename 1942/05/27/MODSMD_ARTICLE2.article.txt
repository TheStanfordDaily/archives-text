# Conway Rescues Girls at Carmel
## 
### 
Farm student Don Conway became
an unthanked, if not entirely un
known hero late Sunday afternoon
when he helped rescue two girls from
the ocean at Carmel.
Conway and John Shaw from the j
Co-op House were sitting on the !
beach when the girls dashed past j
them and swam out about 150 yards,
then started to splash and scream
for help. Failing to see a lifeguard,
Conway swam out to them, and aid
ed by an unidentified soldier who
also had responded to their screams,
towed them safely to the beach.
An hour or so later when the
girls had returned to the beach,
someone pointed Conway out to j
them as "the man who rescued you." '
To which one of them replied coldly,
"Yes, 1 know. I had my arm around
him!"
