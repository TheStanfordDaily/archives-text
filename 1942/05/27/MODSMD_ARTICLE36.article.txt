# Two Memorials Honor Phillips
## Scholarship Fund, Plaque Established 
### 
Honoring the late John Pressley
Phillips Jr., son of Mr. and Mrs.
John P. Phillips of Fresno, two me
morials have been established at
Stanford University, where John was
a member of the junior class at the
time of his accidental death.
The student was fatally injured
last autumn in an accidental fall
from the porch of the Beta Theta Pi
fraternity house.
One of the memorials is a simple
bronze plaque, soon to hang in the
Beta Theta Pi chapter room at Stan
ford. It was made in the Stanford
foundry by William Messick, one of
John's fraternity brothers.
The other memorial will help boys
like John who are working their way
through college. It is the John
Pressley Phillips Memorial Scholar
ship Fund, established by friends of
the deceased as a perpetual endow
ment. John himself was the holder
of an anonymous scholarship.
Contributions to the fund already
received by the university from
friends of the Phillips family in
Fresno, at Stanford, and elsewhere
total $1,650. In addition the Stan
ford Beta Theta Pi Mothers' Club
has given $50. When the fund is
large enough, the income from it will
be used to provide an annual schol
arship for deserving students, ac
cording to Mrs. Olivia Byler, schol
arship secretary.
