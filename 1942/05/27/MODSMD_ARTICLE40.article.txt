# Allen Speaks On 'Marching Civilization'

"This increase in comfort at the
minimum of effort is reflected in the
songs we sing — songs with lush,
cushy orchestras—songs of dream
ing, songs of self-pity," said Dr.
Warren D. Allen, in his talk on "Our
Marching Civilization," a musical in
terpretation of history at the Tues
day Evening Series in the Memorial
Hall auditorium at 7:30 last night.
"We've had great work-songs in
this country, when the pioneers
were opening up the West," he said,
as the University choir sang a lively
rendition of "I've Been Workin' on
the Railroad."
Ted Uppman, baritone, Marjorie
Benson, soprano, and Herbert Jan
Popper, pianist-director, helped Dr.
Allen in his interpretation with the
assistance of the choir, the Stanford
Band, the opera workshop, and the
classes on music, speech and drama,
and the march.
"When hordes of barbarians go to
war, they need the excitement of
noise. Today this is truer than ever.
Modern barbarians, not content with
the already excruciating noises of
explosive warfare, put screamers on
their bombs and stukas," said Dr.
Allan.
Dr. Allen showed how men's ideals
and thoughts are revealed in the
songs they create and sing.
