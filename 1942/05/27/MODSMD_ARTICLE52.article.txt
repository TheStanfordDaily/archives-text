Delt, leads the individuals.
Mapel's 21.1)56 score is the highest yet recorded, hut his team has only
been able to pile up a 14.518 score. The Zetes, although their complete

team has not yet been tested, have a +
15.347 average. As their final men ■
are tested their score will fluctuate i
so that these results are not final.
Main trouble experienced by the i
five operators of the tests so far is j
that the men who agree to come out j
at a certain time often don't show !
up. When it costs $100 a day to run !
the lab, these lapses are costly.
Ollie Hamlin, Zete senior, and
Russ Collier, Delta Chi soph, are
close behind Mapel in the individual
scores. Both men boast tallies of '
