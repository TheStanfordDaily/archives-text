THIS volume of The Daily, devoted as faith
fully as possible to chronicling the Stanford
student war effort, would not be complete with
out a tribute to the personal achievements of
one man. The result of his vision and his end
less, sacrificing labor may well be called the
outstanding contribution of the year to Stanford
undergraduate extra-curricular activities.
This man is Bob Collins. The story of Bob
Collins and what he has done in the space of a
little over one quarter is as much a tribute to
lhe organizing genius of this idea-a-minute man
as it is to the total war contributions of the Stan
ford student body, unrivaled today by any uni
versity in the United States.
Last quarter Collins was just another student
going about the everyday affairs of an under
graduate—a Phi Delt from Riverside was his
label. One night as he was sitting in his room
studying his Shakespeare, his mind started wan
dering. He began asking himself why the aver
age Stanford student was so complacent, why
the Farm was not doing something to win the
war besides going to classes, why The Daily
had laid steady siege to the Ivory Tower for
so many months and years. He realized sugar
and rubber and paper napkins were on their
way out, that war stamps and bonds were not
selling at Stanford, that there was an unfor
giveable waste of food.
But he was not content with a few moments
of silent "beefing" to himself about the situation.
Constructive ideas started popping one after
another. They were unique.
The stimulus Collins gave Stanford in per
sonal sacrifice and in unselfish giving resulted
in the creation of the students' own War Ac
tivities Committee—not just another committee
for grade B politicians to get appointed to so
they could get their names in the paper—but a
committee of live wires whose efforts have been
untiring.
They have originated at Stanford the weekly
Stamp Day (last Thursday war stamp purchases
surpassed $1,500, enough to purchase three
jeeps); a "Clean Your Plate" program to save
food; a system of co-operative use of automo
biles; weekly contributions of Dimes for Diplo
mas, for Stanford men who return from the
service after the war. Living groups and the
senior class are buying war bonds and giving
them to the University, helping both Stanford
and Uncle Sam; fraternities are levying fines in
v/ar stamps; there is a waiting list of student
blood donors for the Red Cross; there is or
ganized saving and collection of junk for sal
vage; there are regular dinners and parties for
soldiers from nearby camps.
Stanford is proud of its record to date, and
deeply indebted to Collins and his unselfish
corps—lrv Hellman, Sylvia Berry, Ed Porter,
Dodie Crile, George Hellyer, Bob Schafer, Dick
Barger, Barbara Boorman, Charles Mcßrian,
Rosemary Cross, Ginnie Dean, Ann Bossinger,
Ted Norton, and Rosemary Goodwin.
Collins voluntarily developed the job he cre
ated, asking nothing and withholding his name
from publicity whenever possible.
If Stanford gives Bob Collins nothing more
than her sincere thanks, she should be pleased
to know formal recognition will be accorded
him in the official 1942 Class History. This an
nouncement v/as made yesterday by the class
historian.
