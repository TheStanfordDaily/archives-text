# Another Good Idea

MAGNOLIA and Eucalypto Casas of Lagu
nita Court have hit upon an idea which is
satisfying a serious need, heretofore overlooked
by campus organizations in their drive to aid
the v/ar effort.
They have given to the Stanford Medical
School Dean's Loan Fund, so that medical stu
dents who ordinarily would have to work sum
mer quarter will now be able to continue
straight through and graduate earlier. This j

will satisfy so much sooner the nation's urgent
need for qualified physicians.
In a letter to Ada Lee Kinard, president of
Casa Magnolia, Dean L. R. Chandler says, in
part:
"Your contribution helps immeasurably to
put a number of boys through Medical School
who otherwise woould have to drop out."
Here is a service which every living group
may well consider in giving funds intelligently.
