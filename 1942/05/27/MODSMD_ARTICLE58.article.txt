### AMIE REICHERT 
j jERR HITLER hasn't got enough worries these days,
no. Now he's having family trouble. The little
group just doesn't seem to be entirely en rapport of
late. The domestic tranquility of yesteryear is fall
ing away. The fur is beginning to fly and people are
calling names and Adolf sits in the middle of it all
chewing his moustache and invoking his inner voices
to no avail.
It s the two boys—Laval, the son of a butcher, and
Benito, the original jackal. They're beginning to
squabble, they're beginning to be jealous of one an
other. They re not being good neighbors, not at all.
When Hitler worked his tricky little coup d'etat in
I' ranee last month he sat back and smacked his lips
and rubbed his hands and thought, how line. But that
was last month and this is this month and things are
different already. >
Laval is getting too big for his britches, that's the
trouble. He's not taking all the orders that come
from the boss in Berlin. Or maybe it's Mussolini who
isn't taking the orders.
Hitler sits in the middle and tries to keep the boys
in hand, but truly that is a difficult thing. The day
he made Laval top dog in Vichyfrance he added an
other problem to his load. When Petain was there
things were simpler. Petain had no ambition—none
for himself, surely none for France. Laval is different.
Laval has ambition for fascism, that is why Hitler
picked him. But he also has ambition for fascist
France and for Pierre Laval, and that is the trouble,
* '% if *
| AVAL will not be pushed around. Mussolini is
trying it and that s what all the shouting is about.
Conditions in Italy are miserable. The people are war
weary and disgruntled. They haven't had a single
major victory since Mussolini handed them this prec
ious war. Mussolini is losing prestige at home—he
lost it abroad long ago. But now he can't fool his
people any more—and even the Little King is begin
ning to get ideas of his own. That is bad.
In the face of all this Hitler promotes the traitor
Laval to a top fascist spot and takes him to his heart.
It begins to look as though the son of the butcher will
become Puppet No. I—at the expense of dislocating the
Italian jaw.
There is one recourse for Mussolini. He drags
out the old battle cry—"Corsica! Nizza! Savoia!"
But now this doesn't sound so good to Hitler any
more. And it sounds even worse to Laval. After all,
they are all supposed to be buddies these days. Good
neighbors, allies, and all that sort of thing.
Laval stands fast. He will not give an inch to
Italian imperialism, he says. He won't turn over the
French fleet to Germany, at least not in name. This
is a new spirit of nationalism in tattered France. It is
fascist nationalism.

jyjUSSOLINI is miffed. He appeals to his old friend
Hitler, who, they say, is now working on Laval.
Ihis latest creation of Fuehrer Frankenstein threat
ens to become something of a monster. Traitor Doriot
steps forward and announces conveniently that he
will be only too happy to take over if Laval fails.
Germany demands for Italy the occupation of Tunis.
Laval talks big. Hitler says that if Laval doesn't say
yes, Rommel will march in anyway.
It's all a big mess, as you can see. It can end two—
maybe more—possible Wciys. It can end with Lavtil
on the outs and a more pliable tool in. It can end
with Italy—now terrified by the threat of Allied in
vasion—leaping into the arms of the United Nations.
It happened last time and it might happen again. For
Mussolini is losing his grip, and the Italian people
are beginning to see that there is nothing for them in
Hitler's war—win or lose.

Laval talks big. Hitler says that if Laval doesn't say

It's all a big mess, as you can see. It can end two—
maybe more—possible Wciys. It can end with Lavtil
on the outs and a more pliable tool in. It can end
with Italy—now terrified by the threat of Allied in

j jERR HITLER hasn't got enough worries these days,
no. Now he's having family trouble. The little
group just doesn't seem to be entirely en rapport of
late. The domestic tranquility of yesteryear is fall
ing away. The fur is beginning to fly and people are
calling names and Adolf sits in the middle of it all
chewing his moustache and invoking his inner voices
to no avail.
It s the two boys—Laval, the son of a butcher, and
Benito, the original jackal. They're beginning to
squabble, they're beginning to be jealous of one an
other. They re not being good neighbors, not at all.
When Hitler worked his tricky little coup d'etat in
I' ranee last month he sat back and smacked his lips
and rubbed his hands and thought, how line. But that
was last month and this is this month and things are
different already. >
Laval is getting too big for his britches, that's the
trouble. He's not taking all the orders that come
from the boss in Berlin. Or maybe it's Mussolini who
isn't taking the orders.
Hitler sits in the middle and tries to keep the boys
in hand, but truly that is a difficult thing. The day
he made Laval top dog in Vichyfrance he added an
other problem to his load. When Petain was there
things were simpler. Petain had no ambition—none
for himself, surely none for France. Laval is different.
Laval has ambition for fascism, that is why Hitler
picked him. But he also has ambition for fascist
France and for Pierre Laval, and that is the trouble,
* '% if *
| AVAL will not be pushed around. Mussolini is
trying it and that s what all the shouting is about.
Conditions in Italy are miserable. The people are war
weary and disgruntled. They haven't had a single
major victory since Mussolini handed them this prec
ious war. Mussolini is losing prestige at home—he
lost it abroad long ago. But now he can't fool his
people any more—and even the Little King is begin
ning to get ideas of his own. That is bad.
In the face of all this Hitler promotes the traitor
Laval to a top fascist spot and takes him to his heart.
It begins to look as though the son of the butcher will
become Puppet No. I—at the expense of dislocating the
Italian jaw.
There is one recourse for Mussolini. He drags
out the old battle cry—"Corsica! Nizza! Savoia!"
But now this doesn't sound so good to Hitler any
more. And it sounds even worse to Laval. After all,
they are all supposed to be buddies these days. Good
neighbors, allies, and all that sort of thing.
Laval stands fast. He will not give an inch to
Italian imperialism, he says. He won't turn over the
French fleet to Germany, at least not in name. This
is a new spirit of nationalism in tattered France. It is
fascist nationalism.

jyjUSSOLINI is miffed. He appeals to his old friend
