### MIKE CHURCHILL 
r REST HOME, May 2G (By Carrier Pigeon).-
Those people who failed to read yesterday's Daily
with care may have carried away the idea that the im
portant news was the refusal by the Chancellor to
sanction the golf and tennis trips.
Significant as this probably was, to my way of
thinking the really important story was down below
the fold, saying:
Stanford Women to Work
As Harvesters This Summer
a breath-taking announcement, to be sure. The thought
of Irma Jean Hannibal and Helen Kimbal in straw hats
and coveralls, leaning on pitch forks, and chewing
tobacco, brings nothing but horror to mind.
On the other hand, forgetting for a moment what
eflect this sort of thing will have on the femininity of
Stanford girls, always our most sacred trust, we can
see a tremendous opportunity to spread culture, en
lightenment. and goodness knows wh.-il among the
farmers <*>f Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, or Lake coun
ties who, despite Carole Lombard, do not always
know what they want.
This war is being called by many the Great Lev
eler. Then let us begin leveling as close to home as
we can, After all, why shouldn't the -farmers of
Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, or Lake counties get a
little of what the highly favored and socially selected
students of Stanford have been getting all along.
What the farmers of Sonoma, Napa, Mendocino, and
Lake counties formerly could obtain only through the
Smart Set pages, they now can have, relatively speak
ing, in the palm of their hands. We must send our girls
to the field and farm without hesitation or delay. In
war, and this is war, we must all share and share
alike.
It is said that under the guidance of Virginia
Dean, recently selected the most outstanding Pi Phi in
the Bay Area, Cap and Gown will sign up as a body.
And don't you think that bodies won't play their part
in this great movement.
If this movement back to the soil catches on you
can count on things being different around here next
year. Dirndls and wedgies will be replaced by riding
boots and jeans.
Instead of a few hands of bridge before dinner the
Thetas will pitch horseshoes, or hay, or maybe even
Dekes.
All things must change, I suppose, for an all-out
war effort; but when they take our girls, there just
doesn't seem to be much left.

r |MIIS column wants to extend its congratulations
along with every body else to John Horrall, editor
for the next volume. We're sorry that we won't be
around to help, but we can pass along the battle cry
of this volume: "When things gel tough, just think of
Bull Session, and those who have to read it."
