# Final Stamp Drive Takes Place Today
## Returns to Be Sent To U.S. Treasury; New $1600 Goal Set 
### 
Stanford will observe its last "War
Stamp Day" of the quarter today in
conjunction with a campus "Pledge
for Victory" campaign.
With a goal of $1600, the War
Stamp and Bonds Committee hopes
to top last week's record of $1535 .65.
The returns from the sale of War
Stamps have climbed steadily since
the first "War Stamp Day" six weeks
ago when $505 was contributed.
Fourteen outlets will have stamps
available for purchasers today.
Campus booths will be set up at the
Main Library, English Corner, Engi
neering Corner, and Union Cellar.
Other outlets are Union Barber
hop, Encina Store, Encina Barber
Shop, Union Cigar Counter, Golf
Course, Bookstore, Post Office,
8.A.C., Campus Service Station, and
the Gym Store.
JOINS PLEDGE' CAMPAIGN
In co-operation with the Treasury
Department, the War Stamp Com
mittee is conducting a "Pledge for
Victory" campaign on the campus.
The campaign which began Wednes
day and ends tomorrow is designed
to secure information about stu
dents' voluntary war contributions.
The Treasury Department is con
ducting a similar survey on a na
tional basis to determine whether
compulsory borrowing will be nec
essary to finance the war. The Stan
ford returns will be forwarded to
the Treasury Department.
MINUTE' MEN
Every living group will be visited
by student "Minute Men" who will
fill out a pledge card for each stu
dent. These pledges are not bind
ing, but merely an indication of each
student's contribution to the war
effort.
Sylvia Berry and Irv Hellman, co
chairmen of the survey, emphasized
that all information will be treated
as strictly confidential, and urged
everyone to co-operate with the
"Pledge for Victory" campaign.
