In west China, where Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek's troops are
battling to push back into Burma
enemy forces which invaded Yun
nan province, an American Volun
teer Group scouting pilot reported
yesterday that the Japanese were
concentrating large mechanized units
at Wanting, on the Burma Road at
the Burma-Yunnan border.
The report aroused concern over
the possibility that a strong column
soon would strike into Yunnan to
rescue the beleaguered Japanese
spearheads between the border and
the Salween River and penetrate
deeper toward Kunming, provincial
capital.
Today's communique said that
nearly half of the Japanese units
which broke through a Chinese en
circlement on the west bank of the
Salween above the Burma Road were
annihilated Sunday.

in battles close to Lunling, on the

positions, inflicting considerable

Foreign military observers at Kun
ming said that in four raids during
the past week on Japanese artillery
positions the Americans had silenced
six batteries.

bombers in the afternoon pounded
at Chinese positions on the east bank
of the Salween.

JAP CONCENTRATION
In west China, where Generalis
simo Chiang Kai-shek's troops are
battling to push back into Burma
enemy forces which invaded Yun

the Salween River and penetrate
deeper toward Kunming, provincial
capital.
Today's communique said that
nearly half of the Japanese units
which broke through a Chinese en
