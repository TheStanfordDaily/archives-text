# Talk to Explain New Price Bill
## 
### 
How Stanford students, as con
sumers, can help make the price
control bill stick will be the theme
of a talk today by Edward Shaw,
associate professor of economics, in
the Education Auditorium at 4:15
p.m.
"There arc dangers involved in
the efforts to control prices which
will be troublesome unless there is
general co-operation by consumers,"
said Dr. Shaw in explaining his sub
ject.
In his speech he plans to tell what
those dangers are that may make the
whole price control system collapse.
Dr. Shaw will also explain how that
can be prevented through consumer
co-operation and Congressional ac
tion.
Second in a series sponsored by
the consumer committee, the talk is
intended to familiarize students with
the various aspects of price control.
Beverly Duncan, chairman of the
meeting, urges everyone to attend.
