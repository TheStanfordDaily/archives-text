# Axis Libyan Columns Launch Drive Against Middle East Roadway
## Farm Salvage Campaign Ends This Week in Final Big Drive 
### 
Scrap metals, rags, rubber, and paper on the Stanford campus are
wanted by the nation for its war effort. All salvage will be collected this
week-end in the big finale of the quarter's activities in the Farm "Salvage
for Victory" campaign.
"Let's do our spring houseclcaning now for victory," Ed Porter, sal-

vage chairman, said yesterday. "It's
imperative that every bit of scrap
material on the campus get back into
production for the war effort."
Actual collections will be made
Saturday afternoon by the Penin
sula Sanitary Company, which has
volunteered trucks and men for the
drive. Halls will do their house
cleaning Friday and fraternities and
sororities Saturday morning.
REALLY NEEDED
America must have raw materials
to make the weapons our fighting
men need for victory, according to
the Bureau of Industrial Conserva
tion. Many of these materials can
be made from so-called waste and
scrap. It's a chance for every Amer
ican to take an active part in the
total effort necessary for total vic
tory.
George Waddell, pre-law student
from San Diego, made sure that
Toyon would have at least 500
pounds of metal by donating his car,
a venerable 1926 Buick.
OLD AGE ADVANCED
"It's seen good service in the two
years I've had it, but old age grad
ually crept up on it until the end
of last quarter when it gave up for
good. I think it can do more for the
nation now as scrap," he said in
presenting the ancient vehicle to
Gordy Durham, salvage chairman
for Toyon.
Other halls, Encina under Bill
Hayes and Branner under A1 Ells
burg, gave promising reports, which
were seconded by Peggy Mayer, re
porting for women's residences and
Dinny Sick for sororities.
TWO HOUSES ALREADY
"The Phi Psis and Delta Chis have
already cleaned out their basement
for this campaign, and found a lot
of salvageable material," said Bill
Hutchinson, collection chairman.
"If every fraternity would add
the job of cleaning out their base
ment or attic to their Saturday
morning work party this week, it
would help out the drive a great
deal as well as yield dividends in
the form of a cleaner Jiouse," he
added.
"Every bit of salvageable material
coming off this campus goes intc
production," Hutchinson said. "It if
our job to increase the amount ol
scrap for production."
WHAT THEY NEED
Here are materials urgently need
ed: Waste paper of all kinds i:
needed to make new paperboard t<
pack foods, airplanes, and tan!
parts, shells and ammunition anc
other articles. Practically all of thi
arms and supplies going to Britain
Russia, and China are packed anc
shipped in water-proof papcrboan
cartons.
Old rags can be used in factorie
for wiping rags and for roofing anc
I flooring materials in emergenc;
construction. 'Many rags also can bi
used in the production of paper.
SCRAP METALS
Scrap metals including iron, steel
brass, copper, aluminum, lead ii
metal beds, stoves, pots and pan. l
hangers, pipe and hardware article
arc urgently needed.
Old rubber can be reclaimed fo
military use. The nation's stock pil
of rubber is down to 460.000 ton;
less than one year's production, am
scrap rubber can replace fresh rub
ber in 75 per cent of rubber article:

REALLY NEEDED
America must have raw materials
to make the weapons our fighting
men need for victory, according to
the Bureau of Industrial Conserva
tion. Many of these materials can
be made from so-called waste and
scrap. It's a chance for every Amer
ican to take an active part in the
total effort necessary for total vic
tory.
George Waddell, pre-law student
from San Diego, made sure that
Toyon would have at least 500
pounds of metal by donating his car,
a venerable 1926 Buick.
OLD AGE ADVANCED
"It's seen good service in the two
years I've had it, but old age grad
ually crept up on it until the end
of last quarter when it gave up for
good. I think it can do more for the
nation now as scrap," he said in
presenting the ancient vehicle to
Gordy Durham, salvage chairman
for Toyon.
Other halls, Encina under Bill
Hayes and Branner under A1 Ells
burg, gave promising reports, which
were seconded by Peggy Mayer, re
porting for women's residences and
Dinny Sick for sororities.
TWO HOUSES ALREADY
"The Phi Psis and Delta Chis have
already cleaned out their basement
for this campaign, and found a lot
of salvageable material," said Bill
Hutchinson, collection chairman.
"If every fraternity would add
the job of cleaning out their base
ment or attic to their Saturday
morning work party this week, it
would help out the drive a great
deal as well as yield dividends in
the form of a cleaner Jiouse," he
added.
"Every bit of salvageable material
coming off this campus goes intc
production," Hutchinson said. "It if
our job to increase the amount ol
scrap for production."
WHAT THEY NEED
Here are materials urgently need
ed: Waste paper of all kinds i:
needed to make new paperboard t<
pack foods, airplanes, and tan!
parts, shells and ammunition anc
other articles. Practically all of thi
arms and supplies going to Britain
Russia, and China are packed anc
shipped in water-proof papcrboan
cartons.
Old rags can be used in factorie
for wiping rags and for roofing anc
I flooring materials in emergenc;
construction. 'Many rags also can bi
used in the production of paper.
SCRAP METALS
Scrap metals including iron, steel
brass, copper, aluminum, lead ii
metal beds, stoves, pots and pan. l
hangers, pipe and hardware article
arc urgently needed.
Old rubber can be reclaimed fo
military use. The nation's stock pil
of rubber is down to 460.000 ton;
less than one year's production, am
scrap rubber can replace fresh rub
ber in 75 per cent of rubber article:
Scrap metals, rags, rubber, and paper on the Stanford campus are
wanted by the nation for its war effort. All salvage will be collected this
week-end in the big finale of the quarter's activities in the Farm "Salvage
