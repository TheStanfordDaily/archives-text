Orinda Country Club Orchestra, the
Summer Quarter Registration Dance

nasium on registration night, June

"The Reg Dance will be one of i
the biggest social events of the Sum- ;
mer Quarter," said Selby. "With so
cial life centered on the campus, and
the natural summer dearth of activ- j
itiesâ€”this Reg Dance will be too
good to miss.
"Most new students and returning '
students will get together at the !
Summer Quarter Reg Dance," con- j
tinued Selby. "And, because there !
will be more fellows than girls here !
for Summer Quarter, the men bet- j
tcr get their dates and tickets now,"
he warned.

is being sponsored by Sigma Delta I
Chi, men's national professional
journalism fraternity.
