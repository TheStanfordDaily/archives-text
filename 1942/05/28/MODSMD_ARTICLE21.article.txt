# Russians Claim Flank Threat Being Reduced
## 
### United Press 
Col. Gen. Erwin Rommel's Axis
army in Libya struck out Wednes
day with a strong force of tanks and
dive bombers against American
equipped British Imperials defend
ing the vital roadway to Suez and
the Middle East, where the Allies
have their only usable land contact
with Russia.
One of Rommel's columns swept
90 miles through the desert before
colliding with British tank forces,
and another drove along the Medi
terranean coast to engage the British
near Tobruk and prevent their in
tervening in the desert battle.
Cairo reported that Rommel's
forces were driving hard, but
whether they were bent on a full
scale offensive remained to be seen.
If they were, it meant at best a di
version intended to discourage the
Allies from opening a second front
in Europe, and it could mean that
Hitler has launched a gigantic pinc
ers operation against the Middle
East, co-ordinated with the south
Russian campaign, in hopes of open
ing a trade route to Japan.
MALTA A FEINT?
Rommel's two German and one
Italian armored divisions and his
several infantry divisions are be
lieved to have been built up to full
strength during the past weeks of
lull. The terrific air assaults on Malta
I may have been designed to keep the
engaged there while these re
inforcements were shuttled across
the Mediterranean.
UNITED NATIONS ALERT
British Libyan forces also have
been strengthened by a steady flow
of Amercian war supplies, and that
fact, together with Rommel's difficult
supply problems and the approach of
the intolerable Libyan summer
raised the suspicion that his drive
was only a feint. It was enough,
however, to throw the United Na
tions -on the alert against a threat
to their Middle East supply route,
the Levantine oil fields, and the pos
sibility that Germans and Japanese
would find a meeting place where
Hitler could trade his industrial
products for the oil, rubber, tin and
other raw materials Japan has
looted from the southwest Pacific
area.
KHARKOV NO DECISION
The Russians, battling against tin;
upper arm of this vast parallel cam
paign, threw 52-ton tanks into the
Battle of Kharkov and reported that
they were reducing the threat to
their left flank, in the Izyum-Bar
venkova sector. They captured a
river town in the Donets bend .area
and advanced several miles at that
| point, and their rough-riding Cossack
cavalrymen made a 37-mile sortie
I i through the German lines at an
i i other, killing 2,100 Germans on the
! way.
j The Kharkov battle raged through
I its 16th day Wednesday still with
no signs of a decision, although the
Germans still claimed to be annihi
j ! lating three Soviet armies in an en
r ! circlement in the Izyum-Barvenkova
sector.
