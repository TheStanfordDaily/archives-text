## Complacent Attitude Going, Says Fisher

Our spiritual gains outweigh our !
losses in the Pacific, according to !
Galen M. Fisher, bay area adviser to I
the Institute of Pacific Relations, at I
the last meeting of the 12:10 Club i
this quarter in the Nitery yesterday
noon.
"At first we were complacent and
conceited as a nation and easy
going and self-indulgent as individ
uals," he said. "But we have been
jolted out of both of those ideas."
At the beginning of the war there .
were only 60 men of white extrac- I
tion who knew Japanese, Mr. Fisher
declared. Now the Army and Navy
are conducting schools of the Japa
nese taught by second generation
Japanese-Americans. They are aim
ing at a goal of 800 men able to
speak Japanese by the end of the
iyear. They will be valuable in
counter-propaganda and translation
of Japanese broadcasts.
Mr. Fisher said that there is a
complete ignorance of the psychol
ogy and the history of the Japanese
here, because "they have trailed the
clouds of feudalism recently," and
this makes them difficult for Ameri
cans to understand.
The authority on Pacific relations
scored a general hate of all Japa
nese growing out of the war, explain
ing that this attitude will not help
us win the war and will keep us
from making a workable peace.
"We must learn to respect them in
peace as well as in war," he de
clared. "We have already learned
to respect them in war."
