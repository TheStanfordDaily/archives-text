# Cowden Presents University With Senior Gift Installment
## '42 to Give About $1,900 In War Bonds 
### 
Bill Cowden, president of Stan
ford's senior class, presented Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur (see pic
ture at right) with the first install
ment of the senior gift last Satur
day, turning over two war bonds of
small denominations.
This year's senior class has de
cided to make its annual gift to the
University do double duty and so is
giving war bonds to the senior schol
arship fund, according to Cowden.
AMOUNT NOT KNOWN
Cowden, who was also co-captain
of Stanford's national championship
basketball team, when questioned
yesterday as to the exact amount of
the gift, said that he couldn't say
exactly how much the class would
be able to give, but stated that it
would be "approximately as much
as the Class of '41 gave."
The amount remaining in the
senior treasury at the end of each
year forms the basis for the total
gift to the University by departing
seniors.
ABOUT $1,900
The Class of 1941 contributed
$1,900 to the senior scholarship
fund. If this year's senior class has
a similar amount to give at the end
of the year, which, according to
Cowden, "seems very likely," and
makes its gift in war bonds, the
scholarship fund will eventually re
ceive more than $2,500.
Final presentation of the senior
class gift will be made by Cowden
at the Class Day exercises to be
held in the chapel on Friday morn
ing, June 12, from 10 to 12.
