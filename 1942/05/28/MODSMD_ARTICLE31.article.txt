# Drivers Urged To Co-operate
## Daily Conservation On Campus Stressed 
### PEGGY BOOTHE 
It is not the essential trips to San
j Francisco that need to be curtailed
but the short trips around the cam
pus that add up to a needless waste
of tires and gasoline, according to
the consumer committee which
hopes to eliminate non-essential
I driving.
With the theme that it is a pa
triotic student's duty to protect his
' car and tires as they are a part of
! the national capital, the committee
is campaigning for co-operative
driving to take the place of "Car
less Wednesday."
They define driving as essential if
i it. is honestly vital to winning the
war. Too many people are not will
ing to see their dates and trips as
"non-essential," according to the
; committee, which urges students to
! walk to classes, labs, and the gym
I and co-operate on longer drives.
The cardinal principle for drivers
| during the duration as formulated by
the committee is to never drive alone
but pick up any walkers and to plan
trips in advance so as to give others
[ transportation.
