### H. D. THOREAU 
year's intramural title fight has turned into a triangular tussle
between the Alpha Dells, the Phi Psis, and the living group to which
the editor of this paper belongs.
With only two events left to be tabulated. Alpha Delta Phi, five-time
winner of the award, has a 17-point lead over T.L.G.T.W.T.E.8., which in

turn lias a G-point margin over Phi
Kappa I'si.
These two aggregations are far
ahead of everybody else. Friday's
swimming meet and the physical fit
ness tests are the final events. If
several seniors in these various or
ganizations don't graduate this
spring, it can be blamed on the 40-
hour week they devoted to intra
murals.

jyi EMBERS of the Intercollegiate
Amateur Athletic Association of
America are rejoicing this week-end
bees iuse they are being allowed to
hold their annual outdoor track and
field championships without any in
trusion from Pacific Coast athletes.
For many years they had their
meet in privacy, but about 20 years
ago they made the mistake of invit
ing Stanford. From then on the
Indians, plus the Trojans, who were
asked to join a few years later, plus
the Bears, who had been members
for a few years previously, monopo
lized the meet. One of the three
teams won every year for about 15,
and it wasn't at all unusual to see
the three schools finishing one-two
three.
After a while schools like Colby,
Bates, Bowdoin, and Williams began
losing interest, since their athletic
specimens couldn't compete with the
western giants.
About five or six years ago the
eastern officials began making un
pleasant cracks at the Coast repre
sentatives. They actually made a
point of scheduling the meet on the
same weekend as the Pacific Coast
Conference championships.
Finally, last year, Stanford, U.S.C.,
and U.C.L.A. drew out of the asso
ciation, and California, although not
withdrawing, sent only one man. He
just happened to be back East at his
brother's wedding. This year no
P.C.C. trackmen will be in New
York this week-end to dominate the
Eastern "athletes" in the 66th annual
renewal of the Icey-foray.
i* *
spring, if all goes well,
Stanford crew enthusiasts will
not have to walk all the way to Red
wood City to see the Indian scullers
in action, since Coach Carl Pedersen
is now making preparations for mov
ing the training float and sculls to
Palo Alto.
With no cars handy, it will be no
task .'it all to walk the four or five
miles to the Paly yacht harbor.
B.A.C. authorities have promised
to double Pedersen's salary, just to
show that they are not averse to
spending money where it is abso
lutely essential. Of course, Pedersen
has coached for free during the past
years.
For those not in V-7, twice times
for-free equals for-free.
' i* * #
of unappreciated
coaches, let's put a vote in for
Eddie Twiggs. In golfing circles
throughout the country, Eddie is ac
knowledged to be the outstanding
coach in the business, but at Stan
ford he takes a back seat to the
Clark Shaughnessy's and Jim Law
son's.
Long is the list of famous Card
golfers developed by "the third best
dressed man in America." Frank
McCann is the latest to be added to
such names as Bud Brownell, War
ren Berl, Art Doering, and Lawson
Little.

winner of the award, has a 17-point lead over T.L.G.T.W.T.E.8., which in

These two aggregations are far

the three schools finishing one-two
three.
After a while schools like Colby,
Bates, Bowdoin, and Williams began
losing interest, since their athletic
specimens couldn't compete with the
western giants.
About five or six years ago the
eastern officials began making un
pleasant cracks at the Coast repre
sentatives. They actually made a
point of scheduling the meet on the
same weekend as the Pacific Coast
Conference championships.
Finally, last year, Stanford, U.S.C.,
and U.C.L.A. drew out of the asso
ciation, and California, although not
withdrawing, sent only one man. He
just happened to be back East at his
brother's wedding. This year no
P.C.C. trackmen will be in New
York this week-end to dominate the
Eastern "athletes" in the 66th annual
renewal of the Icey-foray.

spring, if all goes well,
Stanford crew enthusiasts will
not have to walk all the way to Red
wood City to see the Indian scullers
in action, since Coach Carl Pedersen
is now making preparations for mov
ing the training float and sculls to
Palo Alto.
With no cars handy, it will be no
task .'it all to walk the four or five
miles to the Paly yacht harbor.
B.A.C. authorities have promised
to double Pedersen's salary, just to
show that they are not averse to
spending money where it is abso
lutely essential. Of course, Pedersen
has coached for free during the past
years.
For those not in V-7, twice times
for-free equals for-free.
' i* * #
of unappreciated
coaches, let's put a vote in for
Eddie Twiggs. In golfing circles
throughout the country, Eddie is ac
knowledged to be the outstanding
coach in the business, but at Stan
ford he takes a back seat to the
Clark Shaughnessy's and Jim Law
son's.
Long is the list of famous Card
golfers developed by "the third best
dressed man in America." Frank
McCann is the latest to be added to
such names as Bud Brownell, War
ren Berl, Art Doering, and Lawson
Little.
