ball will perform today at 3:15 on
the Sunken Diamond when the
Stanford ball tea m plays the Camp

the service team's roster are Otto
Meyers, Three-Eye and Piedmont
Leagues and the American Asso

on Johnson's record, he won 12 and
lost 6 for Rocky Mount before be
ing called into the Red Sox fold

6 and dropping but 2 games. John

three inches tall, weighs 188 pounds,
and throws and bats left-handed.
Powell spent the 1940 season with

land Scott, shortstop. Bill Cunha,
C. C. Smith, and Dick Middleton

6 and dropping but 2 games. John

three inches tall, weighs 188 pounds,
and throws and bats left-handed.
Powell spent the 1940 season with
the Seals, winning 12 and losing 7

He is rather small, as compared to
Johnson, being but five feet ten
inches tall, weighing 178 pounds.
He throws from the left side, but
bats either left or right.
MASON MAY STAIiT
Coach Harry Wolter will start
either Doc Mason or Bill Brokaw
from his freshman squad.
Several other frosh are expected
to see action. The infield will see
such old-timers as Bill Harms at
first base; Harry Parsons, second
base; Ted Nell, third base, and Le
land Scott, shortstop. Bill Cunha,
C. C. Smith, and Dick Middleton
will probably see action at second
base to relieve the graduating Par
sons.
