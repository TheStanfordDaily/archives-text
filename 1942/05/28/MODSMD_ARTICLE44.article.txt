# Indians Face Tough Meet At Seattle
## 
### 
Although 18-man teams are to be
allowed at the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet at Seattle Saturday,
Southern California and the host
school, Washington, will probably
be the only schools at the meet with
a full complement.
Brutus Hamilton, California coach,
announced a 14-man squad for the
Bears. This team will be without
three of its brightest stars. Grover
Klemmer, Guinn Smith, and Jim
Jurkovich.
STARS OUT
Klemmer injured his leg early in
the season and will not run any more
this year; Smith went into training
for the Army Air Corps today; and
Jurkovich has already gone to work
since school at Berkeley has been
over several weeks.
Of all the P.C.C. cinder coaches,
only Dean Cromwell will have
trouble selecting the men to make
the trip. He has 25 men from which
to pick his team,
EASY FIELD
Wy Cripe, Stanford's only entry
in the flat races, will have a com
paratively easy field to compete
against. Northern division cham
pion in the half mile. Gene Swanzey
of Washington, has a best time of 1
minute 54.4 seconds, but he is far
ahead of the rest of the northern
880 men.
Chief opposition to Cripe in the
southern half-milers will be Warren
Smith of U.S.C. Although he ran
1:53.2 last season, he has not cut
under 1:55 this year.
lIERTEL FAVORED
Indian Ed Hertel is favored to win
both hurdles. However, the 220 low
hurdle race will give Hurricane Ed
plenty of competition. Pat Haley of
Washington State and Dick Brown
ing of U.S.C. will be pointing for the
undefeated Hertel.
Ed Stamm should have no diffi
culty placing in the shot put, but he
will be lucky to garner any discus
points, since two northerners have
tossed the platter over 150 feet. Best
of the N.D. shot putters is Cougar
Frank Londos at 49Va feet.
CHAMP MAY FALL
Don Findlay, returning confer
ence broad jump champion from
Oregon State, has not approached
his 23-9 mark of last season so may
easily be deposed by either Card
Captain Gene Kern, Trojan Mel
Bleeker, or Bruin Ken Schilling.
Findley and Jim Cole of Wash
ington tied for first in the high
jump at Seattle last week-end, but
this mark does not approach the
heights reached by Indians Willard
Smith and Vern Hart and Trojans
Gil Greene and Searles Tally.
Russ Peck's recent improvement,
plus the absence of Bear Smith,
makes the Indian one of the favor
ites to take the pole vault. Although
two men in the meet will have
vaults higher than Peck's 13-9, they
have not been consistent at over
13-6.

two men in the meet will have
vaults higher than Peck's 13-9, they
have not been consistent at over
13-6.
Although 18-man teams are to be
allowed at the Pacific Coast Con
ference meet at Seattle Saturday,
Southern California and the host
school, Washington, will probably
be the only schools at the meet with
a full complement.
Brutus Hamilton, California coach,
announced a 14-man squad for the
Bears. This team will be without
three of its brightest stars. Grover
Klemmer, Guinn Smith, and Jim
Jurkovich.
STARS OUT
Klemmer injured his leg early in
the season and will not run any more
this year; Smith went into training
for the Army Air Corps today; and
Jurkovich has already gone to work
since school at Berkeley has been
over several weeks.
Of all the P.C.C. cinder coaches,
only Dean Cromwell will have
trouble selecting the men to make
the trip. He has 25 men from which
to pick his team,
EASY FIELD
Wy Cripe, Stanford's only entry
in the flat races, will have a com
paratively easy field to compete
against. Northern division cham
pion in the half mile. Gene Swanzey
of Washington, has a best time of 1
minute 54.4 seconds, but he is far
ahead of the rest of the northern
880 men.
Chief opposition to Cripe in the
southern half-milers will be Warren
Smith of U.S.C. Although he ran
1:53.2 last season, he has not cut
under 1:55 this year.
lIERTEL FAVORED
Indian Ed Hertel is favored to win
both hurdles. However, the 220 low
hurdle race will give Hurricane Ed
plenty of competition. Pat Haley of
Washington State and Dick Brown
ing of U.S.C. will be pointing for the
undefeated Hertel.
Ed Stamm should have no diffi
culty placing in the shot put, but he
will be lucky to garner any discus
points, since two northerners have
tossed the platter over 150 feet. Best
of the N.D. shot putters is Cougar
Frank Londos at 49Va feet.
CHAMP MAY FALL
Don Findlay, returning confer
ence broad jump champion from
Oregon State, has not approached
his 23-9 mark of last season so may
easily be deposed by either Card
Captain Gene Kern, Trojan Mel
Bleeker, or Bruin Ken Schilling.
Findley and Jim Cole of Wash
ington tied for first in the high
jump at Seattle last week-end, but
this mark does not approach the
heights reached by Indians Willard
Smith and Vern Hart and Trojans
Gil Greene and Searles Tally.
Russ Peck's recent improvement,
