More than ever sportsmen will
have to know their "stauff" to take
advantage of short vacations, says
'Doc" Haslett, who returns to Palo
Alto for a free demonstration to
morrow from 11 to 2 o'clock in the
city hall park.
Haslett holds that vacations are
vitally important now because of
long working hours and mental ten
sion. But fishing equipment and
transpprtation facilities are at a i
minimum, so fishermen must know |
proper equipment and its care. In
tomorrow's demonstration he will
demonstrate proper technique of
getting ready to fish and the actual
fishing.
There are four federal cemeteries
for soldiers in North Carolina: at
New Bern, Raleigh, Salisbury, and
Wilmington.
