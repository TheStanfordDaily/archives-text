# The 						Class of '42
## 
### 
ONCE again the nostalgic moment draws
near when a senior class will file past the
Chancellor to receive its diplomas in the Frost
Amphitheater on a warm, late spring afternoon.
But this year it will be with mixed emotions
that the senior class leaves the Farm. There
are few who are able to begin their life work
upon graduation from college in a war year.
Our emotions are at once deep regret at leaving
Stanford and eagerness to get into the fight—
to meet the challenge.
There will be many of us—most of us—who
will not be able to begin our life work for a year,
or two years, or possibly many years. There
will also be some of us who will be able to step
into the service and immediately take up the
work for which we have prepared, and in many
cases we will have better jobs and better pay
than we would have had for several years after
graduation in normal times.
On June 14 we will leave here as engineers,
doctors, physicists, nurses, psychologists, lin
guists, lieutenants, privates, ensigns, apprentice
seamen, and second-class seamen. We will go
forth to become stenographers, civilian defense
workers, relief workers, officers in the field ar
tillery, pilots, and officers at sea on fighting
ships and merchantmen. This will be our life
work for at least the immediate future. And then
there will be the peace which we shall help
obtain and enforce and administer. In the next
few years there will be unbounded joy for some
of us and bitter grief for others of us. Probably
no generation has ever been able to look for
ward to a more interesting life. No matter how
we are individually affected, the years to come
will be fascinating. With this ahead of us, we
leave Stanford with heads high and with guick
ened pulse.
Our last few days on the Farm will be spent
in the busy activities of Senior Work—Class
Day exercises, laying of the Senior Plate, pres
entation of the class gift of War Savings Bonds
to the University, a visitation to the Mausoleum,
the reception of Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur, the all
night Senior Ball, and then, Baccalaureate and
Commencement services.
As we leave we'll say, to Stanford, "Thanks
for everything. We'll be back some day."

forth to become stenographers, civilian defense
workers, relief workers, officers in the field ar
tillery, pilots, and officers at sea on fighting
ships and merchantmen. This will be our life
work for at least the immediate future. And then
there will be the peace which we shall help
obtain and enforce and administer. In the next
few years there will be unbounded joy for some
of us and bitter grief for others of us. Probably
no generation has ever been able to look for
ward to a more interesting life. No matter how
we are individually affected, the years to come
will be fascinating. With this ahead of us, we
leave Stanford with heads high and with guick
ened pulse.
Our last few days on the Farm will be spent
in the busy activities of Senior Work—Class
Day exercises, laying of the Senior Plate, pres
entation of the class gift of War Savings Bonds
to the University, a visitation to the Mausoleum,
the reception of Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur, the all
night Senior Ball, and then, Baccalaureate and
Commencement services.
As we leave we'll say, to Stanford, "Thanks
for everything. We'll be back some day."
ONCE again the nostalgic moment draws
near when a senior class will file past the
Chancellor to receive its diplomas in the Frost
Amphitheater on a warm, late spring afternoon.
But this year it will be with mixed emotions
that the senior class leaves the Farm. There
are few who are able to begin their life work
upon graduation from college in a war year.
Our emotions are at once deep regret at leaving
Stanford and eagerness to get into the fight—
to meet the challenge.
There will be many of us—most of us—who
will not be able to begin our life work for a year,
or two years, or possibly many years. There
will also be some of us who will be able to step
into the service and immediately take up the
work for which we have prepared, and in many
cases we will have better jobs and better pay
than we would have had for several years after
graduation in normal times.
On June 14 we will leave here as engineers,
doctors, physicists, nurses, psychologists, lin
guists, lieutenants, privates, ensigns, apprentice
seamen, and second-class seamen. We will go
forth to become stenographers, civilian defense
workers, relief workers, officers in the field ar
tillery, pilots, and officers at sea on fighting
ships and merchantmen. This will be our life
