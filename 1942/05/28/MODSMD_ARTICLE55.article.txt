# Dear Hap:

### 
IT'S tough to get down and roll in : .he syrup
and write a traditionally sentimental tear
jerker to the losing associate editor. I am not
going to write the things that I am expected to
write to you—the things that every editor has
written for many years. I am not going to write
them because those things are understood be
tween you and me. They are so understood that
men do not talk or write of them. This is the
basis of real friendship. If I were to write a
sugary farewell to you, Hap, I know you would
turn just a little green all over. But it's reassur
ing to know the losing man doesn't walk "out
of the Shack and into the sunset" any more.
You have a bigger job to do, Hap. Good luck,
Mr. Marine.
