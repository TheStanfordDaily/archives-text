# Any Old Junk Today?

r TO those who may be somewhat inclined to
X laugh off the campus "Salvage for Victory"
campaign as "just another one of those drives"
- although we seriously doubt there are such
people here—we recommend they read the re
vealing story on page 1.
It is amazing to see the list of materials that
can be used—that are urgently needed. We
should start saving the stuff we used to toss into
the wastebasket or into a corner for the sopho
mores to clean up on Saturday mornings. We
should contact the salvage chairman of our
living group and find out where the collection
box is, know when collections are made, and
precisely what can be used. Furthermore, we
should make it our business to see to it that the
salvage chairman in charge of junk collections
in our respective living groups is on his toes,
that the drive doesn't show signs of bogging
down.

Many of us will be packing up and leaving
soon—cleaning out rooms, closets, desks and
dressers. There's always a lot of stuff that's
thrown away. Even if it's only old class notes
or any kind of paper, Uncle Sam can use it.
It is well for us to remember that while we
are still here in college, living more or less as
usual, contributing to the salvage campaign
can be just one more thing we can do in going
out of our way to beat the Axis.
