### AMIE REICHERT 
WAELL, I have been right in one prediction, any
way. Mayor Rossi took the stand in the Tenney
Committee hearing the other day and it was very
funny. The mayor is a great joker, all right.
Testifying with his usual vigor and clarity of
thought the mayor told the committee that the whole
business was a frame-up and a smear campaign di
rected against him personally, based on the "damnable
lies of irresponsible people."
When the committee got down to cases and asked
the good mayor a few questions, it came out that he
knew nothing about the activities of the former Italian
Chamber of Commerce, that he did not know it was
registered with the State Department as a foreign
agent, that he knew nothing about the Italian ex
service organization known as the E-Combatteti, that
he seemed to remember having heard of Italian lan
guage schools in San Francisco but had never in
quired about their curricula or their textbooks.
That's all right, mayor. No one really expects you
to know about these things or about anything else
that goes on in San Francisco. That's the way* it's
always been, ever since you've been mayor, and the
electorate of the city must expect things tc be run
that way because they keep right on re-electing you.
Yes, the mayor was good up there on the stand.
How about this choice paragraph quoted from the San
Francisco Chronicle of yesterday:
"Tears came to the mayor's eyes . . . when he told
of 'learning lessons of love and affection' for America
at his mother's knee."

jy|AYOR ROSSI'S daughter, Mrs. Eleanor C. Morris,
was pretty good, too. The Rossi family seems to
sufffer from congenital amnesia or something. Mrs.
Morris was formerly local president of the Mothers'
America and a member of the America First.
All she could remember about these two organi
zations was that they were "non-political."
She couldn't remember that the Mothers of Amer
ica is one of the most active and most pernicious sedi
tionist organizations in the country. That it is a
vicious Red-baiting, Jew-baiting, Roosevelt-baiting
committee of frustrated clubwomen. That even since
Pearl Harbor it has been disseminating literature
propagandizing for the impeachment of the President.
Mrs. Morris has a bad memory, I guess.
She couldn't remember much about America First
either. Something about a Senator—Wheeler, yes,
that's his name—who introduced some bills into the
Senate.
"That was political activity, wasn't it?" they asked
Mrs. Morris.
"I don't know," she said coyly. "You have to do
something."
A singularly profound answer.

A LI r they have on the mayor so far is what they've
always had on him—he doesn't know anything
about the city of San Francisco and its affairs. All the
subversive activity they have been able to prove thus
far comes under the heading of passive neglect of duty,
ignorance, inefficiency and so forth.
But they may get something positive on him yet.
Yesterday the Tenney Committee received a com
munication from Harry Bridges, who offered to testify
before them. Bridges recalled that seven years ago his
longshoremen's union refused to load a large quantity
of scrap metal collected by Italian gaibagemen for
shipment to Mussolini to be used in his Ethiopian
campaign.
Bridges' letter of yesterday to the Tenney Com
mittee says that Rossi subsequently ordered the long
shoremen to load the scrap with the threat that if they
refused to do so, he would furnish any number of
policement required to break any resistance on their
part.
If the Tenney Committee follows this lead and calls
up Bridges they may get something more on Mayor
Rossi than the usual complaints of stupidity.

A LI r they have on the mayor so far is what they've
always had on him—he doesn't know anything
about the city of San Francisco and its affairs. All the
subversive activity they have been able to prove thus
far comes under the heading of passive neglect of duty,
ignorance, inefficiency and so forth.
But they may get something positive on him yet.
Yesterday the Tenney Committee received a com
munication from Harry Bridges, who offered to testify
before them. Bridges recalled that seven years ago his
longshoremen's union refused to load a large quantity
of scrap metal collected by Italian gaibagemen for
shipment to Mussolini to be used in his Ethiopian
campaign.
Bridges' letter of yesterday to the Tenney Com
mittee says that Rossi subsequently ordered the long
shoremen to load the scrap with the threat that if they
refused to do so, he would furnish any number of
policement required to break any resistance on their
part.
If the Tenney Committee follows this lead and calls
up Bridges they may get something more on Mayor
Rossi than the usual complaints of stupidity.
WAELL, I have been right in one prediction, any
way. Mayor Rossi took the stand in the Tenney
Committee hearing the other day and it was very
funny. The mayor is a great joker, all right.
Testifying with his usual vigor and clarity of
thought the mayor told the committee that the whole
business was a frame-up and a smear campaign di
rected against him personally, based on the "damnable
lies of irresponsible people."
When the committee got down to cases and asked
the good mayor a few questions, it came out that he
knew nothing about the activities of the former Italian
Chamber of Commerce, that he did not know it was
registered with the State Department as a foreign
agent, that he knew nothing about the Italian ex
service organization known as the E-Combatteti, that
he seemed to remember having heard of Italian lan
guage schools in San Francisco but had never in
quired about their curricula or their textbooks.
That's all right, mayor. No one really expects you
to know about these things or about anything else
that goes on in San Francisco. That's the way* it's
always been, ever since you've been mayor, and the
electorate of the city must expect things tc be run
that way because they keep right on re-electing you.
Yes, the mayor was good up there on the stand.
How about this choice paragraph quoted from the San
Francisco Chronicle of yesterday:
"Tears came to the mayor's eyes . . . when he told
of 'learning lessons of love and affection' for America
at his mother's knee."

jy|AYOR ROSSI'S daughter, Mrs. Eleanor C. Morris,
was pretty good, too. The Rossi family seems to
sufffer from congenital amnesia or something. Mrs.
Morris was formerly local president of the Mothers'
America and a member of the America First.
All she could remember about these two organi
zations was that they were "non-political."
She couldn't remember that the Mothers of Amer
ica is one of the most active and most pernicious sedi
tionist organizations in the country. That it is a
vicious Red-baiting, Jew-baiting, Roosevelt-baiting
committee of frustrated clubwomen. That even since
Pearl Harbor it has been disseminating literature
propagandizing for the impeachment of the President.
Mrs. Morris has a bad memory, I guess.
She couldn't remember much about America First
either. Something about a Senator—Wheeler, yes,

that way because they keep right on re-electing you.
Yes, the mayor was good up there on the stand.
How about this choice paragraph quoted from the San
Francisco Chronicle of yesterday:
"Tears came to the mayor's eyes . . . when he told
of 'learning lessons of love and affection' for America
at his mother's knee."

jy|AYOR ROSSI'S daughter, Mrs. Eleanor C. Morris,
was pretty good, too. The Rossi family seems to
sufffer from congenital amnesia or something. Mrs.
Morris was formerly local president of the Mothers'
America and a member of the America First.
All she could remember about these two organi
zations was that they were "non-political."
She couldn't remember that the Mothers of Amer
ica is one of the most active and most pernicious sedi
tionist organizations in the country. That it is a
vicious Red-baiting, Jew-baiting, Roosevelt-baiting
committee of frustrated clubwomen. That even since
Pearl Harbor it has been disseminating literature
propagandizing for the impeachment of the President.
Mrs. Morris has a bad memory, I guess.
She couldn't remember much about America First
either. Something about a Senator—Wheeler, yes,
that's his name—who introduced some bills into the
Senate.
"That was political activity, wasn't it?" they asked
Mrs. Morris.
"I don't know," she said coyly. "You have to do
something."
A singularly profound answer.

A LI r they have on the mayor so far is what they've
always had on him—he doesn't know anything
about the city of San Francisco and its affairs. All the
subversive activity they have been able to prove thus
far comes under the heading of passive neglect of duty,
ignorance, inefficiency and so forth.
But they may get something positive on him yet.
Yesterday the Tenney Committee received a com
munication from Harry Bridges, who offered to testify
before them. Bridges recalled that seven years ago his
longshoremen's union refused to load a large quantity
of scrap metal collected by Italian gaibagemen for
shipment to Mussolini to be used in his Ethiopian
campaign.
Bridges' letter of yesterday to the Tenney Com
mittee says that Rossi subsequently ordered the long
shoremen to load the scrap with the threat that if they
refused to do so, he would furnish any number of
policement required to break any resistance on their
part.
If the Tenney Committee follows this lead and calls
up Bridges they may get something more on Mayor
Rossi than the usual complaints of stupidity.
