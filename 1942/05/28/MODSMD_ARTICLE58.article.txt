24 hours short of being a "has-been," and the
Epic hasn't been written. I tried, in fact, I had notes
on the matter, but lost them along with two reviews
for Morale in War Time.
Roughly, it was a conversation between the rear
gunner and the pilot, both Stanford men, of a large
patrol bomber. Watching the sun set and the moon
come out, the gunner sings, "Stanford in Spring."
"When the moon's on Lagunita .. . often he pauses
to talk over with the pilot just what they were doing
there last spring, and what the students are probably
doing now; "when the Chapel's clothed in shadow, and
the chimes begin to ring . . brings back old Stan
ford days and old Stanford traditions; "the ivy vines
on Roble, the trees along the Row .. . how good to
see them, to walk beneath them, again.
A few "zero" fighters broke into this reverie, then
still more. The bomber comes out of it still flying,
but it was found that the gunner was now an alumnus
of an even greater institution than Stanford.
Ashore a superior asks our pilot what were the last
words heard from the gunner.
"That's Stanford in Spring," he replies, turning
away, a little ashamed of the catch in his voice and
the mist before his eyes.

r |' I IIERE appears to be some sort of conspiracy against
me. Just before I landed here in the Rest Home
the physical fitness lab was bound they were going
to test me, but I evaded them. Now I get my notice to
appear for a draft physical. I hastily phoned the
Board and explained my condition. They replied, with
what I think was a smirk, "That's all right, we'll
wait."

■ AST night Mrs. Allen, who IS the Rest Home, came
u up to my room with a tube of tooth paste.
"This," she said, "is to make up for the paste of
yours that you mentioned the other day was being
used up by your room mates." Pretty nice, eh?
Mrs. Allen has been a pro tern mother to more
Stanford fellows than anyone could safely guess. She
has a peculiar knack of making you feel as though
you were at home. The only difference is that there
is nobody who keeps remarking how long you have
been in, bed and how badly the grass needs cutting all
in the same breath.
This is my first time in the Rest Home since coming
to Stanford, and I am a little sorry.

Ashore a superior asks our pilot what were the last
words heard from the gunner.
"That's Stanford in Spring," he replies, turning

the mist before his eyes.

■ AST night Mrs. Allen, who IS the Rest Home, came
u up to my room with a tube of tooth paste.
"This," she said, "is to make up for the paste of
yours that you mentioned the other day was being
used up by your room mates." Pretty nice, eh?
Mrs. Allen has been a pro tern mother to more
Stanford fellows than anyone could safely guess. She
has a peculiar knack of making you feel as though
you were at home. The only difference is that there
is nobody who keeps remarking how long you have
been in, bed and how badly the grass needs cutting all
in the same breath.
This is my first time in the Rest Home since coming
to Stanford, and I am a little sorry.

24 hours short of being a "has-been," and the
Epic hasn't been written. I tried, in fact, I had notes
on the matter, but lost them along with two reviews
for Morale in War Time.
Roughly, it was a conversation between the rear
gunner and the pilot, both Stanford men, of a large
patrol bomber. Watching the sun set and the moon
come out, the gunner sings, "Stanford in Spring."
"When the moon's on Lagunita .. . often he pauses
to talk over with the pilot just what they were doing
there last spring, and what the students are probably
doing now; "when the Chapel's clothed in shadow, and
the chimes begin to ring . . brings back old Stan
ford days and old Stanford traditions; "the ivy vines
on Roble, the trees along the Row .. . how good to
see them, to walk beneath them, again.
A few "zero" fighters broke into this reverie, then
still more. The bomber comes out of it still flying,
but it was found that the gunner was now an alumnus
of an even greater institution than Stanford.
