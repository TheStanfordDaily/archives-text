# Diploma Dimes To Roll Again
## 
### 
Today students will again contrib
ute to the Dimes for Diplomas fund
organized to help those Stanford
men in the service who will want to
return after the war and finish col
lege, but financially will be unable
to do so.
"We hope that every student will
contribute even though he may not
feel at the moment that he will get
direct benefits from this scholarship
fund. It would be a shame to let
the war curtail any more than nec
essary that most progressive phase
of American life, education," Dale
Hosman, chairman of the drive, said
yesterday.
It has been suggested that the
Diploma Fund drive be changed
from Thursday as it is overshadowed
by the war stamp drive. This will
be decided when the committee re
organizes this summer, Hosman
\said
