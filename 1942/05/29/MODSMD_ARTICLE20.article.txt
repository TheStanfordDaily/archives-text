# Cellar Will Close At 8 p.m. May 30
## 
### 
Due to the shortage of labor, it
wjll be neecssary to close the Cellar
May 30 and 31 at 8 p.m. On Friday
evening it will be necessary to cur
tail the serving of hot and cold
sandwiches after 7:30 p.m.; the
fountain will function as usual.

Miss Christine Ricker, director of
University dining halls, states that
luckily service has been curtailed
j only twice before. She further states
l that this is the only solution at the
| moment. The cause of these curtail
' ments has been a shortage of labor.
