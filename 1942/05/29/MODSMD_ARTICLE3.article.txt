# Humanities School Gets $47,500 Gift
## 
### 
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur of Stanford University
announced today acceptance of a gift of $47,500 from the
Rockefeller Foundation in support of the newly organized
School of Humanities.
Simultaneously Dr. Wilbur announced the appointment
of Lewis Mumford as professor of humanities and the selec
tion of Dr. John W. Dodds, professor of English, as execu-

tive head with the title of
Dean.
"This Rockefeller grant is
in addition to the many gen
erous gifts made by Stanford
friends to help inaugurate
the new School of Humani
ties," the Stanford Chancellor
said.
The purpose of the school,
which will begin next autumn,
is to "assist the student in ac
quiring a grasp of the past de
velopment of Western civili
zation and its relation to so
cial, cultural, and philosophic
forces shaping life in the
modern world."
Although the departments
of the present School of Let-

ters as well as the departments
of history, philosophy, music, graphic arts, and speech and
drama will be constituent members of the new school, three
or four additional faculty members will be appointed in the
field of humanities. These professors will be concerned with
that part of the student's program that cuts across the bound
aries of the separate departments, and will assist the student

in synthesizing his entire program
of study.
Part of the Rockefeller grant will
be used to establish an annual Con
ference of the Humanities at Stan
ford University. First of these con
ferences will be held next spring or
summer. The purpose of the confer
ences v/ill be to bring educators from
Western institutions of higher learn
ing to participate in discussions
which might help them to further the
work of the humanities in their own
institutions and which would assist
in shaping the program at Stanford.
The deliberate design of the new
school is to help students train them
selves to meet the present-day crisis
and to prepare them for the post
war period equipped with first-hand
knowledge and appreciation of the
accomplishments and values of
mankind.
Although the School of Humani
ties was established during a great
war, Stanford officials point out that
it is far more than a product of the
immediate crisis. Rather, they say,
it came out of a long-accumulated
dissatisfaction with that university
education which is too technical or
apparently aimless. The new school
will strive to develop in its grad
uates a better understanding of hu
man nature and human achievement.
Lewis Mumford. who has been ap
pointed professor of humanities, lias
long been known fftr his humanistic
studies and writings. One of the
most important fields of his studio;;
was urban civilization which fur
nished material for his two notable
books, "Technics and Civilization"
and "The Culture of Cities." Of his

recent books, "Faith for Living" is
well known.

The New York author was a Gug
genheim fellow and has lectured at
Dartmouth College and Harvard

University. He served as a member
of the Board of Higher Education of
the City of New York and is at pres
ent a member of the Committee on
Teacher Education of the American
Council on Education.
Professor Dodd.s of Stanford, the
new Dean of the School of Humani
ties, is a brother of Harold Willis
Dodds, president of Princeton Uni
versity.
