# Japanese Raid on Pacific Coast 'Almost Inevitable' -- Stimson
## 'Bigger' Than Tokyo Bombing 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 2H (UP). —
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson
warned today it is "almost inevi
table" that llie Japanese, humiliated
hy the smashing U.S. Army raid on
Tokyo, will try to strike a face
saving return blow "bigger, if pos
sible, than that suffered by their
own nation."
"We are alert to this almost in
evitable consequence of the Tokyo
raid," he told a press conference,
"and we are doing everything we
can to prepare for such a return
blow."
He said both coasts must be pre
pared, but pointed out that the
West Coast was closest to Japan.
He added, however, that there must

be no relaxation of vigilance on the
East Coast, asserting in answer to
a question that:
"An attack on Washington is not
wholly inconceivable."
'SEEMS INEVITABLE'
The task before us, he said, is to
"set our house in order for what
seems inevitable' in the way of a
retaliatory blow. He reminded
newsmen there is no perfect de
lense for long coastlines such as this
nation has.
"But I want to assure you we will
nol relax from our greatest defense,"
he said. "That is, preparation for a
major offensive."
WOULDN'T ELABORATE
Stimson declined to elaborate on
his reference to preparations for a
U.S. offensive. He likewise refused
comment on the possible connection
of such an operation with the visit
of high ranking U.S. Army officers
to London.
Some Washington officials cau
tioned against interpreting London
military discussions as foreshadow
ing early attempts to open a large
scale invasion and sustained land
offensive on the continent. One of
ficial pointed out a still larger AEF
would be necessary before any joint
offensive could be started.

would be necessary before any joint
offensive could be started.
