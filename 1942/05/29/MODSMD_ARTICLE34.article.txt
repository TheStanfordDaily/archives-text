# Red Army Smashes Through Nazi Ring in Kharkov Sector
## 
### 
MOSCOW, Friday, May 2!) (UP). —A lied Army formation has broken
through a German ring of entrapment in one sector of the Kharkov front
and farther south fierce tank and motorized infantry attacks on Marshal
Semyon Timoshenko's left flank still are being parried successfully, the
Russians reported today. +

Russian forces, on the offensive in |
some sectors of the Izyum-Barven- |
kova flank, were reported to have j
shattered the 101 st German infantry
division as it goose-stepped up to a
river bank. First blasting it apart
with a barrage across the stream,
Soviet shock troops swarmed over to
annihilate the fragments with bayo
nets and grenades, dispatches said.
The government newspaper Izves
tia reported the break-through of j
the temporarily encircled Russian I
detachment, without revealing its
size or the location. (Berlin had j
claimed the bulk of three Soviet
armies had been surrounded south
of Kharkov and had been all but
wiped out in a "battle of annihila
tion.")
REJOIN TIMOSHENKO
Crashing through the German
ring, Izvestia said, the Russians
dealt out death and destruction
wholesale as they stormed out to re
join Timoshenko's main forces and
straighten out their line.
Front reports said that at some
points the Germans were making
furious counter-attacks and at oth
ers clinging desperately to isolated
pockets of resistance.
Marshal Fedor von Bock was re
ported using considerably smaller
forces of tanks.
"On Thursday our troops repulsed
fierce attacks by enemy tanks and
infantry in the Izyum-Barvenkova
direction," the midnight communique
of the Soviet high command said.
It reported 28 German planes de
stroyed Wednesday and acknowl
edged the loss of 18 Soviet craft.
Stubborn fighting is going on in
one sector of the northwestern front
where the Germans lost 500 men and
large quantities of war materials, the
communique said. On the Kalinin
front the Red Army drove the Ger- ;
mans from two populated places i
| and they left several hundred dead
on the battlefield.
CORPSES CHOKE RIVER
The corpses of more than 1,000
| Germans choked the river and lit
j tered its bank after the Russian
| ambush of the full division of vet
erans of the Donets Basin campaign,
j while the Soviet troops consolidated
j their bridgehead and fanned out in I
pursuit of the punch-drunk frag- '
| ments, the report said.
Front-line dispatches said the Red
Army had snuffed out the threat to 1
its left flank in the Izyum-Barven
kova area below Kharkov and was
i expanding salients into the German !
lines.
The main Kharkov front appeared
; to have settled down to a temporary
battle of attrition, with the Ger- j
i mans content to hold their line i
i while gouging at the Soviet flank.

MOSCOW, Friday, May 2!) (UP). —A lied Army formation has broken
through a German ring of entrapment in one sector of the Kharkov front
and farther south fierce tank and motorized infantry attacks on Marshal
Semyon Timoshenko's left flank still are being parried successfully, the
Russians reported today. +

Russian forces, on the offensive in |
some sectors of the Izyum-Barven- |
kova flank, were reported to have j
shattered the 101 st German infantry
division as it goose-stepped up to a
river bank. First blasting it apart
with a barrage across the stream,
Soviet shock troops swarmed over to
annihilate the fragments with bayo
nets and grenades, dispatches said.
The government newspaper Izves
tia reported the break-through of j
the temporarily encircled Russian I
detachment, without revealing its
size or the location. (Berlin had j
claimed the bulk of three Soviet
armies had been surrounded south
of Kharkov and had been all but
wiped out in a "battle of annihila
tion.")
REJOIN TIMOSHENKO
Crashing through the German
ring, Izvestia said, the Russians
dealt out death and destruction
wholesale as they stormed out to re
join Timoshenko's main forces and
straighten out their line.
Front reports said that at some
points the Germans were making
furious counter-attacks and at oth
ers clinging desperately to isolated
pockets of resistance.
Marshal Fedor von Bock was re
ported using considerably smaller
forces of tanks.
"On Thursday our troops repulsed
fierce attacks by enemy tanks and
infantry in the Izyum-Barvenkova
direction," the midnight communique
of the Soviet high command said.
It reported 28 German planes de
stroyed Wednesday and acknowl
edged the loss of 18 Soviet craft.
Stubborn fighting is going on in
one sector of the northwestern front
where the Germans lost 500 men and
large quantities of war materials, the
communique said. On the Kalinin
front the Red Army drove the Ger- ;
mans from two populated places i
| and they left several hundred dead
on the battlefield.
CORPSES CHOKE RIVER
