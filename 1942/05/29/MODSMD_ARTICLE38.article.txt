# Congress Kicks At Gas Rations
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 28 (UP).—
Proposed nation-wide gasoline ra
tioning to relieve the rubber short
age drew sharp protests in Congress
today and the charge was made thai
the scarcity of rubber is a "fake"
conceived by the "giant rubber mo
nopolies for their own post-war pro
tection."

Rapid-fire developments in the
turbulent gasoline - rubber picture
came as Petroleum Co-ordinator
Harold L. Ickes told a press confer
ence that his proposed Texas-New
York pipeline was the only solution
to the critical Eastern gas and oil
shortage. He pledged every effort
to obtain War Production Board ap
proval of the project, but doubted it
will be forthcoming.

The congressional protests against
nation-wide rationing were led by
House Speaker Sam Rayburn, D.,
Tex., who said he had heard a lot of
reasons for rationing in areas where
the supply was plentiful but "none
of them appeal to me." He assailed
the argument that nation-wide ra
tioning is needed to conserve rub
ber—the theory behind WPB plans
to extend rationing to the entire
country.
Charges that the "fake rubber
shortage" was the work of large
rubber firms were made before a
House interstate commerce subcom
mittee by Elliot E. Simpson, inde
pendent rubber dealer of New York.
He contended plenty of scrap rubber
is available for conversion into a
usable product for making tires and
other civilian goods.
He said the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company, U.S. Rubber Com
pany, B. F. Goodrich Company,
Firestone Tire and Rubber Com
pany, and General Tire and Rubber
Company constituted an "economic
octopus which has a stranglehold on
the American people's rubber needs."

The general price level always
equals the ratio of the product of
money in circulation and its ve
locity of circulation to the physical
quantity of goods.

Harold L. Ickes told a press confer

The congressional protests against
nation-wide rationing were led by
House Speaker Sam Rayburn, D.,

reasons for rationing in areas where
the supply was plentiful but "none

the argument that nation-wide ra

He contended plenty of scrap rubber
is available for conversion into a
usable product for making tires and
other civilian goods.
He said the Goodyear Tire and
Rubber Company, U.S. Rubber Com
pany, B. F. Goodrich Company,
Firestone Tire and Rubber Com
pany, and General Tire and Rubber
Company constituted an "economic
octopus which has a stranglehold on
the American people's rubber needs."

quantity of goods.
