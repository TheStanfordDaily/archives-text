# Sorority Women May Meet Frosh Informally
## 
### 
Sorority women will be permitted to have informal contacts with enter
ing freshmen and transfers during the summer session, according to an
announcement made by Pan Hellenic Council this week.
"The attitude of Row women toward the freshmen this summer will be
friendly, natural, and we are encouraging them to associate in classrooms

and around the Quad," said Hank
Wallace, president of Pan Hell.*
"However, off-campus contacts and
functions are strictly illegal," she
added.
During the summer sorority wom
en will not wear their pins and the
distinction of Hall and Row will be
forgotten, the Council emphasized.
This spirit of informality should .
foster many friendships that might
not otherwise have been made.
All contacts made during the sum- !
mer with new women must be re
ported by the sororities at the first
meeting of Pan Hellenic Council
next fall. At that time, Row officers
reported, all of these contacts will be
reviewed by an executive council
which will levy fines for any infrac
tion of the rushing rules.
Sorority rushing - rules for next
year are about the same as this year,
according to the Pan Hell president.
There will be no open houses, but
instead a series of invitational teas
will be given in October.
Minor violations of rushing rules
daring the summer and next year
will not be overlooked as they some
times have been in the past. Fines
will be levied against individual vio
lators at the discretion of Pan Hel
lenic Council.
