against coffee cups, or read on the run to eight o'clocks and
then discarded, a chronicle of a year of Stanford's ups and
downs can be scanned.
Way back at the beginning of Fall Quarter Stanford's
Fiftieth Anniversary was still being publicized. On Oct. 1,
a commemoration ceremony showed a re-enactment of the
University's opening exercises of half a century before. Two
days later the students ended the celebration with dancing on
the Inner Quad, open houses on the Row, and a football rally,
while a group of old grads grouped together on the Inner
Quad to roar, roar, roar, for Leland Stanford Junioooooor.
When Stanford shaded Oregon, 19-15, and another 1940
football season was prophesied, the campus breathed a sigh
of relief, but caught its breath when The Daily reported that
the Pi Phi's nocturnal serenity had been upset by a midnight
prowler.

when Johnny Phillips, '43, Beta, was killed by a fall from the

partment, showed astounding foresight in an interview by

of pacifism, said, "We won't fight back."
On the afternoon of Oct. 11, Stanfordites huddled over
their radios and cursed the rain that was causing a Beaver
football victory over the Indians of 10-0 in the north.
Gene Tunney spoke to an informal gathering of students;
Interfraternity Council deferred rushing; the Indians rolled
over U.S.F. for a 42-26 moral victory and Mussolini predicted
that the United States would be crushed by the Axis.

already in the war, Cheslie Saroyan wandered out on a hill
side to study and saw his Shakespeare notes disappear down
the throat of a friendly cow.
The Indian-Bronco fracas on Nov. 1 inspired sport writers
to declare Shaughnessy's '41 model T equal to the '40 machine.

came finals.
On Dec. 8 Hirohito stepped in and studying was ruined
