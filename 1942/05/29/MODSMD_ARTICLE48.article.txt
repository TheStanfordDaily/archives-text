# Halls Get New Buzz System
## 
### 
Announcing changes in campus
communications which will directly
affect the residents of Toyon and
Encina this summer, Hall Director
Stanley Sharp announced yesterday
that students living in these dormi
tories will have individual tele
phone signals.
At present. Sharp stated, residents
of these halls are buzzed only by
room number. Thus at Encina, a
buzz to a room has one chance out
of three of getting the right person,
causing a great deal of confusion
and wasted time. With the new
equipment, the telephone operators
will revert to the system outlined in
hall announcements but at present
disregarded.
"The person whor-e family name
comes first in the alphabet will be
given one buzz, the second two. and
the third three. In the bawlout and
in campus directories, the "one
buzz" person will have an X after
his name, the "two-buzz" person a
Y, and the "three-buzz" person a Z.
"Thus, when you call the residence
halls, ask for Joe Bilch, X 2150, or
Bill Zyclowsky, 707, Z. Branner
will go on the system in the fall,"
Sharp stated.
