## 
### 
Stanford students going home at I In* end of tliis quarter will face no
rationing of train or Ims tickets, according to Pacific Greyhound bus lines
and the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The companies said they had no knowledge of the possibility of future
rationing of tickets. Rumors of bus and train ticket rationing are for the
present, at least, false. .

Gas rationing, however, is in ef
fect in 17 states along the eastern
seaboard, according to information
received from the California Auto
mobile Association's San Francisco
office.
The eastern states where gasoline
is being rationed are the following:
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massa
chusetts, New Hampshire, New Jer
sey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, West
Virginia, and the District of Colum
bia.
Parts of a few of the above states;
are free from gasoline rationing.
There is no rationing in part of
Delaware, in western New York,
western Pennsylvania, most of West
Virginia, and a few counties in the
west portion of the state of Vir
ginia.
There is no rationing now in
Washington or Oregon, but the sup
ply to gasoline dealers has been re
duced by one-third since the begin
ning of the war.
As in all cases throughout the na
tion, the shortage in Washington
and Oregon is the result of difficul
ties in the transportation of gasoline,
not a result of a general shortage.
The present gasoline rationing
program on the eastern seaboard is
to be effective from May 15 to July 1
of this year, the California Auto
mobile Association reports. Like
wise, no other rationing is expected
in the country until July 1.
The association further reports
that the eastern seaboards may see
an increase, a decrease, or an en
tirely new system of rationing.
Rationing throughout the country
would not be the result of a general
shortage, but rather because of a
plan to conserve rubber. The asso
ciation, however, says that it has as
yet not knowledge of the formation
of such a plan.

fect in 17 states along the eastern
seaboard, according to information
received from the California Auto
mobile Association's San Francisco
office.
The eastern states where gasoline
is being rationed are the following:
Connecticut, Delaware, Florida,
Georgia, Maine, Maryland, Massa
chusetts, New Hampshire, New Jer
sey, New York, North Carolina,
Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, South
Carolina, Vermont, Virginia, West
Virginia, and the District of Colum
bia.
Parts of a few of the above states;
are free from gasoline rationing.
There is no rationing in part of
Delaware, in western New York,
western Pennsylvania, most of West
Virginia, and a few counties in the
west portion of the state of Vir
ginia.
There is no rationing now in
Washington or Oregon, but the sup
ply to gasoline dealers has been re
duced by one-third since the begin
ning of the war.
As in all cases throughout the na
tion, the shortage in Washington
and Oregon is the result of difficul
ties in the transportation of gasoline,
not a result of a general shortage.
The present gasoline rationing
program on the eastern seaboard is
to be effective from May 15 to July 1
of this year, the California Auto
mobile Association reports. Like
wise, no other rationing is expected
in the country until July 1.
The association further reports
that the eastern seaboards may see
an increase, a decrease, or an en
tirely new system of rationing.
Rationing throughout the country
would not be the result of a general
shortage, but rather because of a
plan to conserve rubber. The asso
ciation, however, says that it has as
yet not knowledge of the formation
of such a plan.
Stanford students going home at I In* end of tliis quarter will face no
rationing of train or Ims tickets, according to Pacific Greyhound bus lines
and the Southern Pacific Railroad.
The companies said they had no knowledge of the possibility of future
rationing of tickets. Rumors of bus and train ticket rationing are for the
present, at least, false. .

Gas rationing, however, is in ef
fect in 17 states along the eastern
seaboard, according to information
