### 
It's spring "Houscclcaning for Vic
tory" this week-end in all Stanford
student residences in the campus
wide salvage drive for scrap metals,
rags, rubber, and paper.
' America must have raw materials
to make the weapons our fighting
men need for victory, and Stanford,
like the rest of the country, must
help to collect the scrap to make
these materials," states Ed Porter,
drive chairman.
Collections will he made Saturday
afternoon by trucks and men of the
Peninsula Sanitary Company.
CLEAN HOUSE
Most halls and women's residences
arc planning to clean out their rooms
for salvageable material this after
noon, while weary sophomores will
clean out the attics and basements of
their fraternity houses tomorrow
afternoon.
Waste paper has become increas
ingly important in the drive for sal
vageable materials. War needs for
paperboard, which make up 90 per
cent of all shipping containers, have
jumped from one-fourth of the pro
duction of 8 million tons last year to
two-thirds of the estimated produc
tion of 9 million tons this year.
NO DECREASE
There is no expected decrease in
demand by other consumers, so
waste paper and rags which can be
used in paper production must make
up the difference. Scrap metals and
rubber will prove to be increasingly
important as the war continues.
Meanwhile, preparations for the
drive are almost complete.

ingly important in the drive for sal
vageable materials. War needs for
paperboard, which make up 90 per
cent of all shipping containers, have
jumped from one-fourth of the pro

tion of 9 million tons this year.
