# Hole-in-One Tourney To Aid Golfers
## Dr. Wilbur's $25 Is Opening Contribution to Trip Fund 
### DON SELBY 
A new feature entered the golf fund campaign picture yesterday with
Sandy Tatum's announcement of a hole-in-one contest to supplement the
ticket sale and general contribution drive to raise money to send Stan
f< id's golf team to South Bend, Ind., this summer in defense of its N.C.A.A.
crown.
The contest, which will be held on the practice hole of the Stanford
course all day Saturday and all day Sunday, is open to all entrants. With

players allowed an unlimited num
ber of balls at 10 cents per ball, Ta
tum expects the tourney to draw a
large number of entrants to swell
the fund.
The first prize will be a tailor
made set of irons, donated by Coach
Eddie Twiggs, with golf balls being
awarded as secondary prizes. In
case of a tie for first, there will be a
play-off.
The first day of ticket sales and
contributions netted the fund $100,
Tatum said yesterday. The first con
tribution was made by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur in the amount
of $25.
The tickets to the Bud Brown
ell-Warren Bcrl match for the
All-University championship went
on sale at the A.S.S.U. office and
through private distributors yes
terday at 50 cents each. Sales will
continue until Tuesday, the day of
the 36-hole match.
"Although anyone may witness
the match whether or not he has a
ticket, we are hoping that most of
the students will buy tickets," Ta
tum said. "If they can't afford to
buy a ticket, any contribution will
be gratefully received."
"The alumni contacted so far have
come through marvelously," Tatum
declared, "and we are expecting a
great deal of help from them."
Stanford graduates all over the
country, and especially in the San
Francisco and East Bay areas, are
working to swell the fund by con
tacting other Stanford men besides
contributing themselves, according
to Tatum, who added:
"In all, the drive is going great
guns and should get better from now
on in."
One of the biggest campaign
points is the good publicity the Uni
versity will get from having teams
competing in the East.
National champs in IMS, 1911!),
and 1941, the Indian team, man
ned this year by Brownell, Frank
McCann, Tatum, and George Trap
hagen, will be shooting for Stan
ford's fourth national intercolle
giate title in five years and the sec
ond consecutive title in a row, if
the campaign is successful enough
to get them back to this year's
tourney.
Giving evidence that the N.C.A.A.
wants the favored Indian outfit back
at South Bend in no uncertain man
ner, Chick Evans, tourney commit
tee chairman and great golfer of the
past, has promised to enlist all the
aid he can for Coach Eddie Twiggs'
aggregation.
If the fund reaches $800. Tatum
feels that the team will have no
trouble in getting to the tourney
and back again.
In the meantime, Coach Twiggs,
who will finance his trip himself and
will probably give more than a little
aid to the players, is wishing that
the matter of the trip was settled.
"The whole thing has been so
uncertain," Twiggs remarked, "that
the boys haven't been doing the '
amount of work that they should.
Last year they knew as soon as
our season out here was finished
that they would he making the
trip, so by the time they started in
the tourney they were right at the
lop of their games."
Which means that Brownell & Co.
will really have to go to work when
and if the trip is definitely on.

"Dave Doud (No. 5 man on the
team) may be back there anyhow,"
said Twiggs, "so he may be on hand
to help us out. If we have more
than just the minimum, it takes a
little of the pressure ofT the first
four boys, although it has always
been the first four who have quali
fied. We could certainly use Jack
Wilson back there—if, of course, we
get there ourselves."

"The whole thing has been so

trip, so by the time they started in

will really have to go to work when

"Dave Doud (No. 5 man on the

said Twiggs, "so he may be on hand
to help us out. If we have more
than just the minimum, it takes a
little of the pressure ofT the first

A new feature entered the golf fund campaign picture yesterday with
Sandy Tatum's announcement of a hole-in-one contest to supplement the
ticket sale and general contribution drive to raise money to send Stan
f< id's golf team to South Bend, Ind., this summer in defense of its N.C.A.A.
crown.
The contest, which will be held on the practice hole of the Stanford
course all day Saturday and all day Sunday, is open to all entrants. With

players allowed an unlimited num
ber of balls at 10 cents per ball, Ta
tum expects the tourney to draw a
large number of entrants to swell
the fund.
The first prize will be a tailor
made set of irons, donated by Coach
Eddie Twiggs, with golf balls being
awarded as secondary prizes. In
case of a tie for first, there will be a
play-off.
The first day of ticket sales and
contributions netted the fund $100,
Tatum said yesterday. The first con
tribution was made by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur in the amount
of $25.
The tickets to the Bud Brown
ell-Warren Bcrl match for the
All-University championship went
on sale at the A.S.S.U. office and
through private distributors yes
terday at 50 cents each. Sales will
continue until Tuesday, the day of
the 36-hole match.
"Although anyone may witness
the match whether or not he has a
ticket, we are hoping that most of
the students will buy tickets," Ta
tum said. "If they can't afford to
buy a ticket, any contribution will
be gratefully received."
"The alumni contacted so far have
come through marvelously," Tatum
declared, "and we are expecting a
great deal of help from them."
Stanford graduates all over the
country, and especially in the San
Francisco and East Bay areas, are
working to swell the fund by con
tacting other Stanford men besides
contributing themselves, according
to Tatum, who added:
"In all, the drive is going great
guns and should get better from now
on in."
One of the biggest campaign
points is the good publicity the Uni
versity will get from having teams
competing in the East.
National champs in IMS, 1911!),
and 1941, the Indian team, man
ned this year by Brownell, Frank
McCann, Tatum, and George Trap
hagen, will be shooting for Stan
ford's fourth national intercolle

the campaign is successful enough
to get them back to this year's
tourney.

at South Bend in no uncertain man

"In all, the drive is going great
guns and should get better from now
on in."
One of the biggest campaign
points is the good publicity the Uni
versity will get from having teams
competing in the East.
National champs in IMS, 1911!),
and 1941, the Indian team, man
ned this year by Brownell, Frank
McCann, Tatum, and George Trap
hagen, will be shooting for Stan
ford's fourth national intercolle
giate title in five years and the sec
ond consecutive title in a row, if
the campaign is successful enough
to get them back to this year's
tourney.
Giving evidence that the N.C.A.A.
wants the favored Indian outfit back
at South Bend in no uncertain man
ner, Chick Evans, tourney commit
tee chairman and great golfer of the
past, has promised to enlist all the
aid he can for Coach Eddie Twiggs'
aggregation.
If the fund reaches $800. Tatum
feels that the team will have no
trouble in getting to the tourney
and back again.
In the meantime, Coach Twiggs,
who will finance his trip himself and
will probably give more than a little
aid to the players, is wishing that
the matter of the trip was settled.
"The whole thing has been so
uncertain," Twiggs remarked, "that
the boys haven't been doing the '
amount of work that they should.
Last year they knew as soon as
our season out here was finished
that they would he making the
trip, so by the time they started in
the tourney they were right at the
lop of their games."
Which means that Brownell & Co.
will really have to go to work when
and if the trip is definitely on.

"Dave Doud (No. 5 man on the
team) may be back there anyhow,"
said Twiggs, "so he may be on hand
to help us out. If we have more
than just the minimum, it takes a
little of the pressure ofT the first
four boys, although it has always
been the first four who have quali
fied. We could certainly use Jack
Wilson back there—if, of course, we
get there ourselves."
A new feature entered the golf fund campaign picture yesterday with
Sandy Tatum's announcement of a hole-in-one contest to supplement the
ticket sale and general contribution drive to raise money to send Stan
f< id's golf team to South Bend, Ind., this summer in defense of its N.C.A.A.
crown.
The contest, which will be held on the practice hole of the Stanford
course all day Saturday and all day Sunday, is open to all entrants. With

players allowed an unlimited num
ber of balls at 10 cents per ball, Ta
tum expects the tourney to draw a
large number of entrants to swell
the fund.
The first prize will be a tailor
made set of irons, donated by Coach
Eddie Twiggs, with golf balls being
awarded as secondary prizes. In
case of a tie for first, there will be a
play-off.
The first day of ticket sales and
contributions netted the fund $100,
Tatum said yesterday. The first con
tribution was made by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur in the amount
of $25.
The tickets to the Bud Brown
ell-Warren Bcrl match for the
All-University championship went
on sale at the A.S.S.U. office and
through private distributors yes
terday at 50 cents each. Sales will
continue until Tuesday, the day of
the 36-hole match.
"Although anyone may witness
the match whether or not he has a
ticket, we are hoping that most of
the students will buy tickets," Ta
tum said. "If they can't afford to
buy a ticket, any contribution will
be gratefully received."
"The alumni contacted so far have
come through marvelously," Tatum
declared, "and we are expecting a
great deal of help from them."
Stanford graduates all over the
country, and especially in the San
Francisco and East Bay areas, are
working to swell the fund by con
tacting other Stanford men besides
contributing themselves, according
to Tatum, who added:
