The Detroit Tigers further spiked
the first place aspirations of the
Cleveland Indians, putting them five
and one-half games behind the
Yanks, with a 6-2 victory behind
rookie hurler Virgil "Fire" Trucks.
It was Trucks' second win of tht
year, the fourth in five starts for the
Detroit squad.
Meanwhile, the Yanks rolled along j
I with a one-run win, 3-2, over the j
'docile Philadelphia Athletics. Jo
seph Gordon poled a single which
! scored Tom Heinrich with the win
ner. The A's outhit the Yanks, nine
hits to six, only to collapse in a fu- I
tile ninth inning "walk-the-batter"
session.
Kirby Higbee was the star as !
Brooklyn, the National one, topped !
the Boston Braves, 6-4. It was the
sixth straight for the Brooks over !
| Stengel's club. Higbee gained his
third victory, and Paul Waner of
Boston came within two hits of the
3,000-hit mark.
And the Cubs travelled 12 weary
innings to eke, and we do mean
eke, out the Cincinnati Reds, 2-1. In
the twelfth frame, Peanuts Lowrey
singled with but one out, and his ef
| fort sparked the Cub rally, which
I scored Lowrey three batters later.
The others were night tilts, which |
J were not reported at press time. ' |
