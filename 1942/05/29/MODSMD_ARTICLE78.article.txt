# Farm Team May Attend NCAA Meet
## 
### 
Stanford may be represented by j
several men in the N.C.A.A. track j
and field championships in Lincoln,
Nebr., next month, despite the
school's new athletic retrenchment
policy which has cut out school
financed Eastern trips.
Subscriptions are now being taken
among Farm track admirers to send
Ed Hertel, Stanford's superior hur
dler, to that meet and several oth- j
ers following it.
After Dr. Wilbur rejected the
B.A.C.'s recommendation for trips I
for nine men in three sports, Track |
Coach Pitch Johnson started a drive j
to raise money to send Hurricane Ed
to these meets where he stands an j
excellent chance of winning.
If any other members of the Card
track team place first or second in j
the P.C.C. championships at Seattle
Ibis week-end they will be appointed |
to the Coast team which is sched- j
uled to meet a selected Big Ten
team in a dual meet at Evanston, 111., j
on June IG, two days after the N.C.-
A.A. meet.
When this meet was originated I
four years ago the member schools
of both conferences agreed to share J
in its promotion equally, therefore I
any loss or gain incurred in the meet
will be shared in by Stanford who- !
ther we have any men entered or
not.
Stanford will therefore probably !
send any men appointed to the team I
by the conference. The majority of
(he expenses will be refunded to \
the school from the meet's gate j
receipts. Thus, if any Indians qual
ify for the trip tomorrow, A1 Mas- |
ters, B.A.C. executive head, will con- ;
tact board members and Dr. Wilbur S
by phone and inform them of the
circumstances.
Since the N.C A.A. will be on the
way to the Evanston meet, and since
it will come on the Friday and Sat
urday before the meet, which is on
Monday, Mr. Masters may rccom- I
mend that these men eligible be j
sent to both.
Hertel has definitely been listed
on Charley Hunter's Olympic Club j
roster which will compete in the J
National Junior and Senior A.A.U. '
championships in New York the last ;
week of June.
The Winged "O" will pay his ox- j
I enses from the Evanston meet on
East. Hunter also indicated that he j
will add Slamm to the team if the j
Indian wcightman improves his best I
.shot mark to 52 feet in (he interim. j
Since Hunter already has two good
shot putters, he cannot take Stamm
otherwise.
Anothc r Stanfordite, Johnny Ful
ton, may join the Club ranks. Ful
ton, a freshman, can run excellent
times in any race from a quarter- !
mile to two miles. He is an excellent
bet to win the Junior BKO.

ton, a freshman, can run excellent
times in any race from a quarter- !
mile to two miles. He is an excellent
bet to win the Junior BKO.
Stanford may be represented by j
several men in the N.C.A.A. track j
and field championships in Lincoln,
Nebr., next month, despite the
school's new athletic retrenchment
policy which has cut out school
financed Eastern trips.
Subscriptions are now being taken
among Farm track admirers to send
Ed Hertel, Stanford's superior hur
dler, to that meet and several oth- j
ers following it.
After Dr. Wilbur rejected the
B.A.C.'s recommendation for trips I
for nine men in three sports, Track |
Coach Pitch Johnson started a drive j
to raise money to send Hurricane Ed
to these meets where he stands an j
excellent chance of winning.
If any other members of the Card
track team place first or second in j
the P.C.C. championships at Seattle
Ibis week-end they will be appointed |
to the Coast team which is sched- j
uled to meet a selected Big Ten
team in a dual meet at Evanston, 111., j
on June IG, two days after the N.C.-
A.A. meet.
When this meet was originated I
four years ago the member schools
of both conferences agreed to share J
in its promotion equally, therefore I
any loss or gain incurred in the meet
will be shared in by Stanford who- !
ther we have any men entered or
not.
Stanford will therefore probably !
send any men appointed to the team I
by the conference. The majority of
(he expenses will be refunded to \
the school from the meet's gate j
receipts. Thus, if any Indians qual
ify for the trip tomorrow, A1 Mas- |
ters, B.A.C. executive head, will con- ;
tact board members and Dr. Wilbur S
by phone and inform them of the
circumstances.
Since the N.C A.A. will be on the
way to the Evanston meet, and since
it will come on the Friday and Sat
urday before the meet, which is on
Monday, Mr. Masters may rccom- I
mend that these men eligible be j
sent to both.
Hertel has definitely been listed
on Charley Hunter's Olympic Club j
roster which will compete in the J
National Junior and Senior A.A.U. '
championships in New York the last ;
week of June.
The Winged "O" will pay his ox- j
I enses from the Evanston meet on
East. Hunter also indicated that he j
will add Slamm to the team if the j
Indian wcightman improves his best I
.shot mark to 52 feet in (he interim. j
Since Hunter already has two good
shot putters, he cannot take Stamm
otherwise.
