. . . former A.S.S.U. President
| A1 Masters received a telegram this
I week from "Tug" Wilson, head of
Northwestern athletics and N.C.A.A.
big shot, asked the former A.S.S.U.
president to attempt to gel Cornie
Warmerdam as a gate attraction at
the Coast-Big Ten dual track meet
next month. Dutch has to be in
Pocatello two days before the meet
| and in New York five days later,
but maybe he can sandwich it in...
... a few weeks back I men
tioned the tennis team's shutout
win ever California as the first in
history. An alert coach has since
informed me that not only did the
'.'52 team win 9-0 from Ca!, hut it
did the same thing to S.C. and
U.C.L.A., and then went on to
heat Washington, 3-0. in the con
ference playoffs which have since
been abandoned. Keith Gledhill
headed an outfit of potent men
that season . . .
. . . Virgil "Fire' Trucks four-hit
win over I he Cleveland Indians yes
terday while hurling for the Tigers,
recalls to mind his first year in or
ganized ball, just out of high school.
' He fanned over 400 men in 200 inn-
I ings to set the Florida-Georgia
| League abloze. He's been "Fire"
Trucks ever since . . .
. . . Ed Hertel will' be facing old
rivals in the hurdles at Seattle to
morrow. When Ed was at Fuller
ton J.C., Trojans Dick Browning
and Walt Smith were at Visalia
and Glendale Jay sees, respectively,
and Zenas Butler, now at Eugene,
was at Long Beach. Ed ate their
cinders many times in those years,
j hut not now . . .
. . . the man who said that Fred
Boensch, pronounced bunch, was

I AST September it was good to sit
here and conjure up visions of

dio served no cokes and sandwiches
the day we fell before the Beavers
J at Corvallis in the mud, however . . .
it was god figuring up our chances

and-so beat so-and-so, etc. . . . but
all that ended with the Big Game
