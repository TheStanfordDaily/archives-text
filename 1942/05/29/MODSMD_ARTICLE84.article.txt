# Indians Set For Coast Track Meet
## 
### 
Coach Pitch Johnson, with eight
Stanford trackmen in tow, left Palo
Alto yesterday afternoon bound for
Seattle and the Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field champion
hips which will he held ther«* lo
norrcw morning and afternoon.
Wy Cripe, Ed Hertel, Don Reiss,
Td Stamrn, Russ Peck, Willard
Smith, Vein Hart, and Captain Gene
Kern are the Cards set to compete
against the conference's best.
The team, since they will not ar
rive in (he norlhern city until to
night, will get no chance to work
out before the preliminaries to
morrow morning. Trials will be
held only in events where the num
ber of entries warrants it.
U.S.C. FAVORED
Southern California, winner of the
team title every year since the meet
was re-founded in 1936, is a certainty
to take the team laurels again, but
Stanford will be fighting with Washi
ngton and California for the run
ner-up spots.
Although Cripe's marks to date
have not been sensational, he hat,
shown marked improvement of late
and his competition in the half-mile
may not be too stiff, so he .should
break into the scoring.
HERTEL STILL TOPS
Hertel, undefeated since March in
either high or. low hurdles, will be
favored to take both barrier events,
but not without competition. Wash
ington State's Haley is somewhat of
an unknown quantity in the highs,
since Ellington has just introduced
him to the event this spring.
Haloy and two Trojans, Dick
Browning and Walt Smith, will be
the men for Hurricane Ed to watch
in the lows. The Indian flash beat
both Southern Californians last
week-end, but only by a slim mar
gin. Browning's 23.2 mark of last
year makes hi in one of the top
timber-toppers in the nation.
HALEY'S TIME FAST
Ilaley placed in the conference
lows last year and did 23.8 only
last week in winning from Zenas
Butler of Oregon. The latter has a
mark of 23.5 made while in junior
college.
Don Reiss, second Card hurdler,
while only a sophomore competing
against these veterans, should break
in for a point or so in one or both
of the events.
Gil Greene of U.S.C. seems to be
head-and-shoulders ahead of the
rest of the high jump field, since he
has been consistent at 6-6 and better
all season. His teammate, Searles
Tally, has cleared 6 feet 8 inches
on occasion, but often drops out at
G-2, so he will probably finish no
better than in a tie with Indians
Willard Smith and Vern Hart, Farm
high jumping pair
HART OVER 6-5
Hart cleared over 6-5 last season
anel has come close to that mark on
several occasions (his year. Smith,
an unknown sophomore at the be
ginning of the yeiir, has been a con
stant winner at 6-4, and has shown
signs of going even higher.
The pole vault is an open event
with three and maybe more men
having an ecjual crack at the blue
ribbon. Willard Schaefer of Troy
has twice vaulted 14 feet 6 inches,
but usually is content with a foot
lower.
Lute Nichols of California went
14 feet even last week-end to equal
his best, but usually drops out at
13-6. These two men, plus Indian
Russ Peck, should battle it out
around 14 feet.
PECK GOING UP
Peck broke his own record by
three inches last week-ene! at Mo
desto when he cleared 13-9, and
should keep going up.
If Ed Stamm can come back io
the form he showed in the Big Meet
last month, he will give S.C.'s Carl
Merritt a battle in the shot put. In
that one meet Stamm pushed his
host effort out from 49 feet to 51-5.
Merritt has done 52-2.
Another possible first for Stan
ford looms in the broad jump. Cap
tain Gene Kern has been consistent
at over 23 feet this year, respite an
ankle injury. This seems to be
healed now, and after a week's rest
he is ready to go way out.

the men for Hurricane Ed to watch
in the lows. The Indian flash beat
both Southern Californians last
week-end, but only by a slim mar
gin. Browning's 23.2 mark of last
year makes hi in one of the top
timber-toppers in the nation.
HALEY'S TIME FAST
Ilaley placed in the conference
lows last year and did 23.8 only
last week in winning from Zenas
Butler of Oregon. The latter has a
mark of 23.5 made while in junior
college.
Don Reiss, second Card hurdler,
while only a sophomore competing
against these veterans, should break
in for a point or so in one or both
of the events.
Gil Greene of U.S.C. seems to be
head-and-shoulders ahead of the
rest of the high jump field, since he
has been consistent at 6-6 and better
all season. His teammate, Searles
Tally, has cleared 6 feet 8 inches
on occasion, but often drops out at
G-2, so he will probably finish no
better than in a tie with Indians
Willard Smith and Vern Hart, Farm
high jumping pair
HART OVER 6-5
Hart cleared over 6-5 last season
anel has come close to that mark on
several occasions (his year. Smith,
an unknown sophomore at the be
ginning of the yeiir, has been a con
stant winner at 6-4, and has shown
signs of going even higher.
The pole vault is an open event
with three and maybe more men
having an ecjual crack at the blue
ribbon. Willard Schaefer of Troy
has twice vaulted 14 feet 6 inches,
but usually is content with a foot
lower.
Lute Nichols of California went
14 feet even last week-end to equal
his best, but usually drops out at
13-6. These two men, plus Indian
Russ Peck, should battle it out
around 14 feet.
PECK GOING UP
Peck broke his own record by
three inches last week-ene! at Mo
desto when he cleared 13-9, and
should keep going up.
If Ed Stamm can come back io
the form he showed in the Big Meet
last month, he will give S.C.'s Carl
Merritt a battle in the shot put. In
that one meet Stamm pushed his
host effort out from 49 feet to 51-5.
Merritt has done 52-2.
Another possible first for Stan
ford looms in the broad jump. Cap
tain Gene Kern has been consistent
at over 23 feet this year, respite an
ankle injury. This seems to be
healed now, and after a week's rest
he is ready to go way out.
Coach Pitch Johnson, with eight
Stanford trackmen in tow, left Palo
Alto yesterday afternoon bound for
Seattle and the Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field champion
hips which will he held ther«* lo
norrcw morning and afternoon.
Wy Cripe, Ed Hertel, Don Reiss,
Td Stamrn, Russ Peck, Willard
Smith, Vein Hart, and Captain Gene
Kern are the Cards set to compete
against the conference's best.
The team, since they will not ar
rive in (he norlhern city until to
night, will get no chance to work
out before the preliminaries to
morrow morning. Trials will be
held only in events where the num
ber of entries warrants it.
U.S.C. FAVORED
Southern California, winner of the
team title every year since the meet
was re-founded in 1936, is a certainty
to take the team laurels again, but
Stanford will be fighting with Washi
ngton and California for the run
ner-up spots.
Although Cripe's marks to date
have not been sensational, he hat,
shown marked improvement of late
and his competition in the half-mile
may not be too stiff, so he .should
break into the scoring.
HERTEL STILL TOPS
Hertel, undefeated since March in
either high or. low hurdles, will be
favored to take both barrier events,
but not without competition. Wash
ington State's Haley is somewhat of
an unknown quantity in the highs,

has twice vaulted 14 feet 6 inches,
but usually is content with a foot
lower.
Lute Nichols of California went
14 feet even last week-end to equal
his best, but usually drops out at
13-6. These two men, plus Indian
Russ Peck, should battle it out
around 14 feet.
PECK GOING UP
Peck broke his own record by
three inches last week-ene! at Mo
desto when he cleared 13-9, and
should keep going up.
If Ed Stamm can come back io
the form he showed in the Big Meet
last month, he will give S.C.'s Carl
Merritt a battle in the shot put. In
that one meet Stamm pushed his
host effort out from 49 feet to 51-5.
Merritt has done 52-2.
Another possible first for Stan
ford looms in the broad jump. Cap
tain Gene Kern has been consistent
at over 23 feet this year, respite an
ankle injury. This seems to be
healed now, and after a week's rest
he is ready to go way out.
Coach Pitch Johnson, with eight
Stanford trackmen in tow, left Palo
Alto yesterday afternoon bound for
Seattle and the Pacific Coast Con
ference track and field champion
hips which will he held ther«* lo
norrcw morning and afternoon.
Wy Cripe, Ed Hertel, Don Reiss,
Td Stamrn, Russ Peck, Willard
Smith, Vein Hart, and Captain Gene
Kern are the Cards set to compete
against the conference's best.
The team, since they will not ar
rive in (he norlhern city until to
night, will get no chance to work
out before the preliminaries to
morrow morning. Trials will be
held only in events where the num
ber of entries warrants it.
U.S.C. FAVORED
Southern California, winner of the
team title every year since the meet
was re-founded in 1936, is a certainty
to take the team laurels again, but
Stanford will be fighting with Washi
ngton and California for the run
ner-up spots.
Although Cripe's marks to date
have not been sensational, he hat,
shown marked improvement of late
and his competition in the half-mile
may not be too stiff, so he .should
break into the scoring.
HERTEL STILL TOPS
Hertel, undefeated since March in
either high or. low hurdles, will be
favored to take both barrier events,
but not without competition. Wash
ington State's Haley is somewhat of
an unknown quantity in the highs,
since Ellington has just introduced
him to the event this spring.
Haloy and two Trojans, Dick
Browning and Walt Smith, will be
the men for Hurricane Ed to watch
in the lows. The Indian flash beat
both Southern Californians last
week-end, but only by a slim mar
gin. Browning's 23.2 mark of last
year makes hi in one of the top
timber-toppers in the nation.
HALEY'S TIME FAST
Ilaley placed in the conference
lows last year and did 23.8 only
last week in winning from Zenas
Butler of Oregon. The latter has a
mark of 23.5 made while in junior
college.
Don Reiss, second Card hurdler,
while only a sophomore competing
against these veterans, should break
in for a point or so in one or both
of the events.
Gil Greene of U.S.C. seems to be
head-and-shoulders ahead of the
rest of the high jump field, since he
has been consistent at 6-6 and better
all season. His teammate, Searles
Tally, has cleared 6 feet 8 inches
on occasion, but often drops out at
G-2, so he will probably finish no
better than in a tie with Indians
Willard Smith and Vern Hart, Farm
high jumping pair
HART OVER 6-5
Hart cleared over 6-5 last season
anel has come close to that mark on
several occasions (his year. Smith,
an unknown sophomore at the be
ginning of the yeiir, has been a con
stant winner at 6-4, and has shown
signs of going even higher.
The pole vault is an open event
with three and maybe more men
having an ecjual crack at the blue
ribbon. Willard Schaefer of Troy
has twice vaulted 14 feet 6 inches,
but usually is content with a foot
lower.
Lute Nichols of California went
14 feet even last week-end to equal
his best, but usually drops out at
13-6. These two men, plus Indian
