# Dear John:
## 
### 
JUST as I started to write this last one, a fighter
plane roared low over the campus. I didn't
look out the window in time to see it—l think
it was a P-38, by the sound of it. You can hear
them coming, but they're gone almost before
you can spot them.
That's the way it's been with this volume,
John. It's gone awfully fast. That is because
of the war. In the last few years it has been The
Daily's main charge to fight for a complete sun
deck on the Boalhouse and for Cellar tomato
juice with some food content in it, offered at a
decent price. But we went to war, and just as
soon as we did, these things became very little
and unimportant. To us in the Shack, war has
meant more space for news from every battle
front, because the future of our lives and of
the world is being decided by steel tanks in
heretofore vast, little-traversed deserts, by hard
hitting naval forces on new battle fronts in many
separate seas of the immense Pacific, and by
heavy bombers and lightning-fast fighters in
the brand new battle front of the skies.
At home on the Farm your job will be to
spur Stanford on to every possible aid to the
war effort, to prod committees and living groups
when they falter. Most important, your job here
will be one of encouragement to the Stanford
community —and this job will be a matter of
personal satisfaction to you because nowhere
could you find a more intelligent community,
wide-awake and responsive to the needs of the
country.
Last fall the world's momentum carried us
faster and faster toward war. There were those
who honestly hated to see it come and there
were those who blinded themselves to reality.
They included many people at Stanford. They
went on record in Campus Opinion and fought
a bitter battle for big name bands and other
luxuries that become absurdities and even here
sies in a nation preparing to go to war. It was
a farsighted Ex Committee that took a stand
against these people; it was Charley Bull and
his Volume 100 who fought and won that fight
for us, who led them and educated them, and
who paved the way to make it easier for us.
Here, then, is your job:
To chronicle accurately our victories and, if
necessary, our defeats. To lead Stanford in our
national fight for ungualified victory.
I should like to make special mention of that
great quartet who have, from the day they en
tered Stanford, given four years of their devo
tion and talent to The Daily—Romie, Jean, Bud
and Charley. I should like to thank, sincerely,
cach of them for their help, encouragement and
v/arm friendship.

To Jean, who did an A-l professional job on
the Fashion Edition and as women's editor; to
Herm, whose efficiency and natural genius for
dummying the paper and displaying news as
managing editor have aided the paper immeas
urably. To Vic, v/ho leaves Tuesday for Green
Bay and the Army, and who made himself in
dispensable han'dling local art in addition to
his regular duties; to Hap, who has made
working in the Shack so much more fun for
all of us, and who will be back to lend a hand
wholeheartedly whenever needed.

To Amie for a lively, well-written History and
for her night editing; to Churchill, whose Bull
Session provided daily intellectual gymnastics
for thousands; to H. D., who knows his sports
as well as any man who ever worked on the
paper, and proved it; to the Otter, for a lot of
hard work and for learning to get people's
heads in his pictures; to Steifer for his feeches,
to Coffee for an excellent job as art editor, to
Vash and to Cyc.

To Martha, Claudia, Don, Charley Alien,
Hamps, Mike, Ches and Salty for the best night
editing in a long time on The Daily. To Janie,
Ferris, Peg, Badge, Steve, Lucy, Bob Hannah,
Ted Norton, Winch and Newt as head copy edi
tors. Also to Newt for a swell job 0:1 intramurals.
To Ed McLellan for his art work.
To Looie for his patience, his co operation and
his friendship.
To each of these people, my sincere thanks.
They have earned for The Daily whatever suc
cess it has enjoyed this volume. I should like
particularly to thank Charley and Bat for all
their help; it looks like this volume may be "30"
on The Daily for them, too.
To you, John, I bequeath the tricky swivel
chair, the typewriter on the little green table,
and the cheesecake on the wall -just as much
symbols of office as the editor's ring and his
keys.
I hope you can remember to turn on the
machines on time. I never could.
So long, John, and good luck!

paper, and proved it; to the Otter, for a lot of
hard work and for learning to get people's
heads in his pictures; to Steifer for his feeches,
to Coffee for an excellent job as art editor, to
Vash and to Cyc.

To Martha, Claudia, Don, Charley Alien,
Hamps, Mike, Ches and Salty for the best night
editing in a long time on The Daily. To Janie,
Ferris, Peg, Badge, Steve, Lucy, Bob Hannah,
Ted Norton, Winch and Newt as head copy edi
tors. Also to Newt for a swell job 0:1 intramurals.
To Ed McLellan for his art work.
To Looie for his patience, his co operation and
his friendship.
To each of these people, my sincere thanks.
They have earned for The Daily whatever suc
cess it has enjoyed this volume. I should like
particularly to thank Charley and Bat for all
their help; it looks like this volume may be "30"
on The Daily for them, too.
To you, John, I bequeath the tricky swivel
chair, the typewriter on the little green table,
and the cheesecake on the wall -just as much
symbols of office as the editor's ring and his
keys.
I hope you can remember to turn on the
machines on time. I never could.
So long, John, and good luck!

JUST as I started to write this last one, a fighter
plane roared low over the campus. I didn't
look out the window in time to see it—l think
it was a P-38, by the sound of it. You can hear
them coming, but they're gone almost before
you can spot them.
That's the way it's been with this volume,
John. It's gone awfully fast. That is because
of the war. In the last few years it has been The
Daily's main charge to fight for a complete sun
deck on the Boalhouse and for Cellar tomato
juice with some food content in it, offered at a
decent price. But we went to war, and just as
soon as we did, these things became very little
and unimportant. To us in the Shack, war has
meant more space for news from every battle
front, because the future of our lives and of
the world is being decided by steel tanks in
heretofore vast, little-traversed deserts, by hard
hitting naval forces on new battle fronts in many
separate seas of the immense Pacific, and by
heavy bombers and lightning-fast fighters in
the brand new battle front of the skies.
At home on the Farm your job will be to
spur Stanford on to every possible aid to the
war effort, to prod committees and living groups
when they falter. Most important, your job here
will be one of encouragement to the Stanford
community —and this job will be a matter of
personal satisfaction to you because nowhere
could you find a more intelligent community,
wide-awake and responsive to the needs of the
country.
Last fall the world's momentum carried us
faster and faster toward war. There were those
who honestly hated to see it come and there
were those who blinded themselves to reality.
They included many people at Stanford. They
went on record in Campus Opinion and fought
a bitter battle for big name bands and other
luxuries that become absurdities and even here
sies in a nation preparing to go to war. It was
a farsighted Ex Committee that took a stand
against these people; it was Charley Bull and
his Volume 100 who fought and won that fight
for us, who led them and educated them, and
who paved the way to make it easier for us.
Here, then, is your job:
To chronicle accurately our victories and, if
necessary, our defeats. To lead Stanford in our
national fight for ungualified victory.
I should like to make special mention of that
great quartet who have, from the day they en
tered Stanford, given four years of their devo
tion and talent to The Daily—Romie, Jean, Bud
and Charley. I should like to thank, sincerely,
cach of them for their help, encouragement and
v/arm friendship.

To Jean, who did an A-l professional job on
the Fashion Edition and as women's editor; to
Herm, whose efficiency and natural genius for
dummying the paper and displaying news as
managing editor have aided the paper immeas
urably. To Vic, v/ho leaves Tuesday for Green
Bay and the Army, and who made himself in
dispensable han'dling local art in addition to
his regular duties; to Hap, who has made
working in the Shack so much more fun for
all of us, and who will be back to lend a hand
wholeheartedly whenever needed.

To Amie for a lively, well-written History and
for her night editing; to Churchill, whose Bull
Session provided daily intellectual gymnastics
for thousands; to H. D., who knows his sports
as well as any man who ever worked on the
paper, and proved it; to the Otter, for a lot of
hard work and for learning to get people's
heads in his pictures; to Steifer for his feeches,

for us, who led them and educated them, and
who paved the way to make it easier for us.
Here, then, is your job:
To chronicle accurately our victories and, if
necessary, our defeats. To lead Stanford in our
national fight for ungualified victory.
I should like to make special mention of that
great quartet who have, from the day they en
tered Stanford, given four years of their devo
tion and talent to The Daily—Romie, Jean, Bud
and Charley. I should like to thank, sincerely,
cach of them for their help, encouragement and
v/arm friendship.

To Jean, who did an A-l professional job on
the Fashion Edition and as women's editor; to
Herm, whose efficiency and natural genius for
dummying the paper and displaying news as
managing editor have aided the paper immeas
urably. To Vic, v/ho leaves Tuesday for Green
Bay and the Army, and who made himself in
dispensable han'dling local art in addition to
his regular duties; to Hap, who has made
working in the Shack so much more fun for
all of us, and who will be back to lend a hand
wholeheartedly whenever needed.

To Amie for a lively, well-written History and
for her night editing; to Churchill, whose Bull
Session provided daily intellectual gymnastics
for thousands; to H. D., who knows his sports
as well as any man who ever worked on the
paper, and proved it; to the Otter, for a lot of
hard work and for learning to get people's
heads in his pictures; to Steifer for his feeches,
to Coffee for an excellent job as art editor, to
Vash and to Cyc.

To Martha, Claudia, Don, Charley Alien,
Hamps, Mike, Ches and Salty for the best night
editing in a long time on The Daily. To Janie,
Ferris, Peg, Badge, Steve, Lucy, Bob Hannah,
Ted Norton, Winch and Newt as head copy edi
tors. Also to Newt for a swell job 0:1 intramurals.
To Ed McLellan for his art work.
To Looie for his patience, his co operation and
his friendship.
To each of these people, my sincere thanks.
They have earned for The Daily whatever suc
cess it has enjoyed this volume. I should like
particularly to thank Charley and Bat for all
their help; it looks like this volume may be "30"
on The Daily for them, too.
To you, John, I bequeath the tricky swivel
chair, the typewriter on the little green table,
and the cheesecake on the wall -just as much
symbols of office as the editor's ring and his
keys.
I hope you can remember to turn on the
machines on time. I never could.
So long, John, and good luck!

JUST as I started to write this last one, a fighter
plane roared low over the campus. I didn't
look out the window in time to see it—l think
it was a P-38, by the sound of it. You can hear
them coming, but they're gone almost before
you can spot them.
That's the way it's been with this volume,
John. It's gone awfully fast. That is because
of the war. In the last few years it has been The
Daily's main charge to fight for a complete sun
deck on the Boalhouse and for Cellar tomato
juice with some food content in it, offered at a
decent price. But we went to war, and just as
soon as we did, these things became very little
and unimportant. To us in the Shack, war has
meant more space for news from every battle
front, because the future of our lives and of
the world is being decided by steel tanks in
heretofore vast, little-traversed deserts, by hard
hitting naval forces on new battle fronts in many
separate seas of the immense Pacific, and by
heavy bombers and lightning-fast fighters in
the brand new battle front of the skies.
At home on the Farm your job will be to
spur Stanford on to every possible aid to the
war effort, to prod committees and living groups
when they falter. Most important, your job here
will be one of encouragement to the Stanford
community —and this job will be a matter of
personal satisfaction to you because nowhere
could you find a more intelligent community,
wide-awake and responsive to the needs of the
country.
Last fall the world's momentum carried us
faster and faster toward war. There were those
who honestly hated to see it come and there
were those who blinded themselves to reality.
They included many people at Stanford. They
went on record in Campus Opinion and fought
a bitter battle for big name bands and other
luxuries that become absurdities and even here
sies in a nation preparing to go to war. It was
a farsighted Ex Committee that took a stand
against these people; it was Charley Bull and
his Volume 100 who fought and won that fight
for us, who led them and educated them, and
who paved the way to make it easier for us.
