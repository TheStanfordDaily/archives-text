### AMIE REICHERT 
|>OYS and girls, this is the one I don't want to write.
1 don't know how to sing a swan song, or make a
great sunset, or even an indefinite afterglow. I'm just
quitting, as of now.
The best thing that happened to me personally this
year, I believe, was that people started fighting with
me. On the Quad and in the Cellar, and, oh God, in the
Campus Opinion column. That has been the greatest i
satisfaction of all. It was good and stimulating and it
proved for me that Stanford's Ivory Tower Was be
ginning to crumble.
* * * *
it has been an exciting year. The best thing that
happened to the world was the entry of our coun
try into the war.
I believe in this war. I have believed in it from the
start. It is not a dishonorable war. It is a war for I
existence, not only of America—certainly not the
America of the last decade—but for humanity. It is
not our war or England's war or Russia's war or any
one's war. No nation can have a monopoly on this
conflict. This is everyone's fight because it is free
dom's fight and justice's fight and civilization's fight.
It is war FOR these things as much as it is war
AGAINST tyranny and brutality and barbarism.
We can win this war. Not because we arc wholly
righteous in it—and we are not—but because we have
the strength in production and manpower to do it.
Principally because we have Russia as a military ally.
We can win this war by next year if the Red Army
stands fast. 1 believe the Russians will hold.
* «S * i|>
Y^ r HEN the day of victory comes, the U.S. and Rus
sia will be the two most powerful nations in the
world. The U.S. will be powerful because it will be
the richest nation in the world, the only nation not
decimated and diseased by the war. Russia will be
powerful because it will be her army that has really
won the war and defeated Naziism. It docs not matter
what happens in the next year or so, Russia has won
this war for us, I believe. It does not matter if British
and American forces open the second front in Europe
nnd crack the Germans. It does not matter who gets
to Berlin first. Russia is the victor in this struggle.
Our problem after the war will be to bring Russia
into the family of nations. To bring her in without
bringing in her ideology and her political methods.
The same is true of Germany, Italy, and Japan. How
this will be solved, I cannot pretend to know.
* * * *
at home we must make great and drastic
1 changes. We are fighting not for THE American
way of life, but for AN American way of life, as yet
unborn, unrealized. The American way of life of the
past can never be again. The era of rugged individual
ism and laissez-faire and irresponsible capitalism is
past. Labor will be the most powerful group in the
U.S. after this war, if it can find itself in time and find
intelligent leadership in time.
And this is right. America must make greater
strides toward socialism, governmental economic con
trol and regulation. It must be a New Deal Plus. The
leisure class—yes, that's you and that's me—will not
be permitted to hold onto what it has at the expense
i of the other nine-tenths of the population. There
| must be a leveling off, and this will mean a general
! lowering of our standard of living, but it will be worth
j it. The American workman will still be the richest in
| the world, but the American capitalist will be gone.
To Bill Steif, who will write this column summer
I quarter, and to Ted Norton, who will write it fall
j quarter, I bequeath my blessings and my World Al
manac. 30.

Y^ r HEN the day of victory comes, the U.S. and Rus
sia will be the two most powerful nations in the
world. The U.S. will be powerful because it will be
the richest nation in the world, the only nation not
decimated and diseased by the war. Russia will be
powerful because it will be her army that has really
won the war and defeated Naziism. It docs not matter
what happens in the next year or so, Russia has won
this war for us, I believe. It does not matter if British
and American forces open the second front in Europe
nnd crack the Germans. It does not matter who gets
to Berlin first. Russia is the victor in this struggle.
Our problem after the war will be to bring Russia
into the family of nations. To bring her in without
bringing in her ideology and her political methods.
The same is true of Germany, Italy, and Japan. How
this will be solved, I cannot pretend to know.
* * * *
at home we must make great and drastic
1 changes. We are fighting not for THE American
way of life, but for AN American way of life, as yet
unborn, unrealized. The American way of life of the
past can never be again. The era of rugged individual
ism and laissez-faire and irresponsible capitalism is
past. Labor will be the most powerful group in the
U.S. after this war, if it can find itself in time and find
intelligent leadership in time.
And this is right. America must make greater
strides toward socialism, governmental economic con
trol and regulation. It must be a New Deal Plus. The
leisure class—yes, that's you and that's me—will not
be permitted to hold onto what it has at the expense
i of the other nine-tenths of the population. There
| must be a leveling off, and this will mean a general
! lowering of our standard of living, but it will be worth
j it. The American workman will still be the richest in
| the world, but the American capitalist will be gone.

I believe in this war. I have believed in it from the
start. It is not a dishonorable war. It is a war for I
existence, not only of America—certainly not the
America of the last decade—but for humanity. It is
not our war or England's war or Russia's war or any
one's war. No nation can have a monopoly on this
conflict. This is everyone's fight because it is free
dom's fight and justice's fight and civilization's fight.
It is war FOR these things as much as it is war
AGAINST tyranny and brutality and barbarism.
We can win this war. Not because we arc wholly
righteous in it—and we are not—but because we have
the strength in production and manpower to do it.
Principally because we have Russia as a military ally.
We can win this war by next year if the Red Army
stands fast. 1 believe the Russians will hold.

|>OYS and girls, this is the one I don't want to write.
1 don't know how to sing a swan song, or make a
great sunset, or even an indefinite afterglow. I'm just
quitting, as of now.
The best thing that happened to me personally this
year, I believe, was that people started fighting with
me. On the Quad and in the Cellar, and, oh God, in the
Campus Opinion column. That has been the greatest i
satisfaction of all. It was good and stimulating and it
proved for me that Stanford's Ivory Tower Was be
ginning to crumble.
* * * *
it has been an exciting year. The best thing that
happened to the world was the entry of our coun
try into the war.
I believe in this war. I have believed in it from the
start. It is not a dishonorable war. It is a war for I
existence, not only of America—certainly not the
America of the last decade—but for humanity. It is
not our war or England's war or Russia's war or any
one's war. No nation can have a monopoly on this
conflict. This is everyone's fight because it is free
dom's fight and justice's fight and civilization's fight.
It is war FOR these things as much as it is war
AGAINST tyranny and brutality and barbarism.
We can win this war. Not because we arc wholly
righteous in it—and we are not—but because we have
the strength in production and manpower to do it.
Principally because we have Russia as a military ally.
We can win this war by next year if the Red Army
stands fast. 1 believe the Russians will hold.
* «S * i|>
Y^ r HEN the day of victory comes, the U.S. and Rus
sia will be the two most powerful nations in the
world. The U.S. will be powerful because it will be
the richest nation in the world, the only nation not
decimated and diseased by the war. Russia will be
powerful because it will be her army that has really
won the war and defeated Naziism. It docs not matter
what happens in the next year or so, Russia has won
this war for us, I believe. It does not matter if British
and American forces open the second front in Europe
nnd crack the Germans. It does not matter who gets
to Berlin first. Russia is the victor in this struggle.
Our problem after the war will be to bring Russia
into the family of nations. To bring her in without
bringing in her ideology and her political methods.
The same is true of Germany, Italy, and Japan. How
this will be solved, I cannot pretend to know.
* * * *
at home we must make great and drastic
1 changes. We are fighting not for THE American
way of life, but for AN American way of life, as yet
unborn, unrealized. The American way of life of the
past can never be again. The era of rugged individual
ism and laissez-faire and irresponsible capitalism is
past. Labor will be the most powerful group in the
U.S. after this war, if it can find itself in time and find
intelligent leadership in time.
And this is right. America must make greater
strides toward socialism, governmental economic con
trol and regulation. It must be a New Deal Plus. The
leisure class—yes, that's you and that's me—will not
be permitted to hold onto what it has at the expense
i of the other nine-tenths of the population. There
| must be a leveling off, and this will mean a general
! lowering of our standard of living, but it will be worth
j it. The American workman will still be the richest in
| the world, but the American capitalist will be gone.
