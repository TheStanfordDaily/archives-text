### MIKE CHURCHILL 
HTHE REST HOME, May 28 (By Way of tlic Burma
Road). — Journalistically speaking, my Stanford
days arc over just as soon as I get to the last line
of today's column.
The next time you pick up a Daily to read Bull
Session, it will have a different by-line. It is going back
to the man who was my predecessor, Chcslie Saroyan.
If anyone tells you that I was just a ghastly ex
periment and that The Daily is trying to begin again
as if I never happened, don't believe 'em.
I joined the staff of The Daily with Vol. 101 and
with this volume I leave it. I like to think that it is
only because I am graduating.
Vol. 101, the chocolate shake volume, was a lot of
fun, and a lot happened. We got a new head football
coach, and we were nearly taken over by the Navy.
There was big talk of l:3o's and Sylvia Berry made us
War Stamp conscious.
The cost of living started its rise, while allowances
diminished. Students got their fun closer to school, and
Dinah's burned. We got champion basketball, tennis,
and golf teams, and sugar was rationed. We elected
an interesting pair for student body president and vice
president, huge, handsome six-foot-four Ed Stamm and
pert petite five-foot Leslie Langnecker.

a dozen or more lines of this column belong
to me, so of course they should be forceful, pithy,
significant. The best way to find such stuff is to look
up back issues, but they are not available.
Then let me just say good-bye and thanks to the
others on the staff. They made me welcome as a new
comer and arc largely responsible for any merit my
work may have had. Good-bye too to Stanford and
her students, and particularly to this year's class, the
first class in 23 years to graduate into war. The first,
class ever to graduate into war where everyone must
fight if we arc to win.
I know we'll all fight; and we'll win.

others on the staff. They made me welcome as a new
comer and arc largely responsible for any merit my
work may have had. Good-bye too to Stanford and
her students, and particularly to this year's class, the
first class in 23 years to graduate into war. The first,
class ever to graduate into war where everyone must
fight if we arc to win.
I know we'll all fight; and we'll win.
HTHE REST HOME, May 28 (By Way of tlic Burma
Road). — Journalistically speaking, my Stanford
days arc over just as soon as I get to the last line
of today's column.
The next time you pick up a Daily to read Bull
Session, it will have a different by-line. It is going back
to the man who was my predecessor, Chcslie Saroyan.
If anyone tells you that I was just a ghastly ex
periment and that The Daily is trying to begin again
as if I never happened, don't believe 'em.
I joined the staff of The Daily with Vol. 101 and
with this volume I leave it. I like to think that it is
only because I am graduating.
Vol. 101, the chocolate shake volume, was a lot of
fun, and a lot happened. We got a new head football
coach, and we were nearly taken over by the Navy.
There was big talk of l:3o's and Sylvia Berry made us
War Stamp conscious.
The cost of living started its rise, while allowances
diminished. Students got their fun closer to school, and
Dinah's burned. We got champion basketball, tennis,
and golf teams, and sugar was rationed. We elected
an interesting pair for student body president and vice
president, huge, handsome six-foot-four Ed Stamm and
pert petite five-foot Leslie Langnecker.

a dozen or more lines of this column belong
to me, so of course they should be forceful, pithy,
significant. The best way to find such stuff is to look
up back issues, but they are not available.
Then let me just say good-bye and thanks to the
others on the staff. They made me welcome as a new
comer and arc largely responsible for any merit my
work may have had. Good-bye too to Stanford and
