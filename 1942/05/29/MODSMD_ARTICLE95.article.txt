# CAMPUS OPINION
## COMLLINS ON WAR WORK 
### 
r rHE EDITOR, SIR:
We all deeply appreciate your very generous rec
ognition of the Student War Program.
For myself. I can vouch for the importance of the
various committee heads. These people and the work
ers under them perform the undramatic hut all-essen
tial work. Their untiring efforts have been the very
basis of any of our success.
The list of unrecognized workers is endless. War
work is really too big for individuals or single groups
to stand out.
However, we all sincerely realize that the interest
of yourself and your staff has been one of the funda
mental contributions to the success of the campus war
effort.
In the last analysis the real thanks and praise go
to the general student body. We have worked hard
and enthusiastically. But we have only done so to
enable it to assume the responsibility in this crisis. It
has been the intelligence and eagerness of the campus,
in taking advantage of our facilities, which has made
and will keep Stanford's war effort progressive.
Robert Collins.
