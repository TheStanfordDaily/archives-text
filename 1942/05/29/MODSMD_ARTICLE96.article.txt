# Stanford Players Hit Peak With 'He Who Gets Slapped'
## 
### 
'I he most amazing technical job and in other respects the outstanding
Stanford production of the year, "He Who (lets Slapped." with two re
maining nights rings down the curtain on a successful Players' season.
Ted Marcuse as HE turns in his most remarkable performance at Stan
ford. As a sort of mystery man turned clown, he waxes humorous or
histrionic, even turns somersaults—
and Rets slapped—in a fashion pro- 4

I l'essional.
Marcia Shaughnessy, actress of the
j year, attests an unusual versatility
with a role the direct opposite of her
last starring vehicle. It will bear re-
J peating that, as an actress, she has
vet to be excelled on the Stanford
stage.
Though there are no characters
which are not satisfactory, at least
I two others deserve individual bou-
I qucts. One is the ever-reliable John
Hii'h, who plays a D'Annunzio-type
"ake, and injects a part that could
have been stale with a good meas
ure of momentum. The other is
Jaques Polcy, she of the nimble
limbs, who as a naive bareback rider
is not only, as usual, an exceptional
dancer, but, as usual, an exceptional
actress.
However, it was still the atmos
phere and not the cast which made
j the production. "He" is a bizarre,
, modernized "Pagliacci" with a lib -
| eral mixture of Russian profundity,
encompassing wittiness, tragedy, and
gripping drama, but. always ironi
cal. These effects are strikingly un
derlined with music from the circus
arena, with a picturesque Walde
mar Johansen setting and with an
incredible mastery of the lighting,
which, by changes in color, in in
tensity, in points of concentration,
and points of focus, not only estab
lishes the mood, the shifts in scenes,
and the shifts in attention, but give.;
a single set the variety of a moving
picture.
And this does not account for the
costuming, for the host of char
acters ascending and descending the
flights of stairs throughout, nor for
an infinite number of laudable
points. Suffice it to say that it is
an original and powerful play, well
cast, and technically perfect.—Covey
