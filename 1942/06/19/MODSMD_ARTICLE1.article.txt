"if all the students will meet at j
Lagunita at 3:30 and walk to the
picnic grounds together."
Since the picnic is a combination '
of the regular freshman and trans- j
fer assembly and of the usual bar- j
becue, Chancellor Wilbur and Stu
dent Body President Ed Stamm will
speak. Shorty Grannis, campus
funny man, will be master of cere
monies, leading yells and commu
nity singing.
