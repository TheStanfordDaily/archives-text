S.U. vice-president. Pointing out
Chat one of the main objects of A.S.-
S.U. functions this summer will be
£o keep Stanforditcs on campus, Miss
Langnecker said these functions
would be simpler than usual because
of the necessity of conforming to
wartime standards but at the same
ilime would be "very attractive."
On the schedule for the summer
are Sunday movies, a number of
jollyups, probably a barbecue, and
either a dance or a barbecue for
Saturday, July 4, stated Miss Lang
necker.
The Sunday movie series, she said,
is being run by Nancy Haskins, who
plans to show movies on alternate
Sunday nights.
"We have planned to hold the
jollyups," stated Miss Langnecker,
"on the week-ends in which we do
not show movies. They will defi
nitely be week-end, not mid-week,
dances." She added that "a chair
man to run these jollyups has not
yet been selected."
Plans are also under way, said

Miss Langnecker, to hold at least
one barbecue during the quarter,
and to have some type of celebra
tion on July 4, a Saturday.
She added, however, that all plans
are still rather indefinite, since Ed
Stamm, A.S.S.U. president, won't get
back from his Eastern track junket
until tomorrow.

The governor of North Carolina
is the only one in the United States
