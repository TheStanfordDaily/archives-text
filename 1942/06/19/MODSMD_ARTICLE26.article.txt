# Rubber Salvage Drive Starts
## 
### 
In co-operation with President
Roosevelt's rubber salvage program,
the Stanford Salvage Committee
will continue the work started last
Monday of collecting all rubber
goods that can be salvaged. Con
tainers will be placed in each living
group soon, according to Pete
Paget, chairman of the committee.
The drive ends June 30.
"Stanford students will play an
important part in this program,
which is of nationwide scope," he
added.
The Stanford War Activities
Board, of which the salvage commit
tee is a part, will interview all new
and old students who are interested
in doing campus war work Monday
and Tuesday afternoon from 3 to 5
in Room 13 of the Old Union.
"It is not what the students have
done, but what they want to do,"
according to Bob Collins, Stanford
War Activities Co-ordinator. "The
work will be interesting and for a
worthy cause."
Those interested will work with
the stamp committee, which will
start its activities Wednesday on
campus and in the living groups, the
salvage committee, public relations
committee, and any other war activ
ities board.
