Out (if Blood. Sweat, and Tear Gas
UNCLE SAM'S TEAM (and
brother, how it hurts): to the
Navy—Al Cole, who probably would
have held down the first string
wartime '42 football team. Cole will
be a member of the Naval Air Corps.
Don I jiebendorfer. Farm publicity di
rector and one of Stanford's staunch
est builder-uppers. Genial, balding
Don is at Annapolis preparing for
instructorship in the Navy's pre
fiight. training program. Clayton
Frye, Stanford boxing coach, re
cently commissioned a lieutenant,
senior grade. Frankie Albert, All-
American key-to-the-T man, who
after finishing work on the picture
"Spirit of Stanford" was commis-

sioned an ensign. Jim Lawson, saved
for last because his loss will be felt
most deeply. Strange how it hap
pened. Lawson waited around years
as an assistant coach and when the
big break comes, the war comes
with it, and Jim Lawson never gets
to coach the team he's been waiting
to coach for so long a time.

WOULDN'T BE A BIT SUR
" ROUNDED IF: Vic Lindskog.
husky Indian center of three years
past, gets some kind of an assistant's
job under whomever the B.A.C. ap
points Monday as a successor to
Lawson.
IE Stanford's football team plays
host to big crowds after all, because
five and possibly six of the regular
9-game schedule, will be played
away from home and away from
military-important highways. There's
Notre Dame at South Bend. There's
U.C.L.A. at Los Angeles in the Coli
seum, a site already approved by the
Army for two big crowd dates. One
is the American Legion's annual
show, which usually draws from
GO.OOO to 80.000, and the other is the
Treasury Department's welcoming
to Jimmy Doolittle and other war
heroes, which will draw pu—lenty.
The Washington and Santa Clara
contests are already slated for Ke
zar Stadium, and some arrangement
may shift the San Jose State-U.S.F.
encounter from the San Francisco
oval Oct. 24, to allow Stanford to
meet Southern California that day
instead.
The Big Game will be played at
Berkeley, also free from military
encumberment—we hope.
The three remaining games. Ore
gon State, Washington State, and
Idaho, will be held in the Stanford
Stadium with no one knowing yet
exactly how Army regulation will
effect the seating capacity.

PIPS THAT PASS IN THE
NIGHT: The Philadelphia Record
the other day printed the American
and National League baseball
standings in reverse order.
When amazed subscribers called
lip. gasping with wonderment, and
questioned the skyrocket climb,
the Reccrd replied: "We just
thought you'd like to sec the home
teams on lop for a change!"
The Record went even farther.
It printed the Phils in bush league
standings, whore they could reign
Cards, Reds. Giants. Pirates, Cubs,
and Braves—in that order.
