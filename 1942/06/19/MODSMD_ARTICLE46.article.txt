### BILL STEIF 
long-predicted drive to
ard the Near East with a meet
ing of the Japanese in India as the
eventual objective seems at last to
be taking shape. The Fuehrer, at
least, is attempting to make the
drive take shape. He seems to be
meeting a little opposition on the
way.
First there came the big Nazi
push against the Kerch Peninsula
in the Crimea. The idea, it must
be imagined, was to furnish a
jumping-ofT spot for a German
drive into the Caucasus, which
would immediately follow Kerch's
fall. The objective was accom
plished but Kerch didn't fall in
the few hours in which the Nazis
thought it might fall. It took a
good 10 days before the Soviet
troops were cleared out, and mean
while the Reds were playing havoc
with the Nazi lines between Khar
kov and the Sea of Azov. All of
which thoroughly destroyed the
value of the Nazi blitz technique.
Meanwhile, down along the North
African shore Marshal Rommel was
trying to sneak around the British
flanks and work his way over to
Cairo. But camera fan Rommel's
skillful thrusts got him nowhere.
He met British and Free French
troops which were at least his equal
in tank power and undoubtedly su
perior in the air. In the last week,
however, he has turned on a drive
sustained enough to take Bir Ha
cheim, the little oasis Knightsbridge,
and Bir El Gobi, places which are
of little importance in themselves
but which possess much strategic
importance in a war of movement
such as that which is now going on
in Libya.
Yesterday the Germans, appar
ently reinforced in tanks, took sev
eral more little towns out in the
desert. These included El Adem
and Sidi Rezegh, two key points in
the British outer defenses around
Tobruk. The Germans were also
reported mopping up in the vi
cinity of Acroma. the third town
in this semi-circle around Tobruk.
The trouble of the British, ac
cording to Raymond Graham
Swing, is not that they lack tanks
or planes, but that they are des
perately short on anti-tank guns.

r J , HE total result of the Nazis' des
ert offensive is that the British
are again in the more or less pre
carious position of having to defend
not only Tobruk, which is pretty
tough (the Nazis and Italians found
this out last time they drove east
ward in North Africa\ but there is
also the problem of keeping the long
road along the sea between Bardia,
on the Egyptian border, and Tobruk.
But from a long-range viewpoint,
Rommel's attack certainly cannot be
called a striking success. It has
forced the Nazis (with their Italian
epigones) to dig deeply into their
resources to keep the campaign go
ing; that is the significance of the
British and American sinking of two
Italian warships in the Mediterra
nean several days ago.
This, in other words, has been, like
the campaign against Kerch, a pretty
poor showing for an outfit that wants
to meet the Japs in India.
Another example of the blitz
blitzing none too effectively can
be seen in Sevastopol, where the
Germans have been trying to cut
down the Bolsheviks for a week.
Yesterday German communiques
claimed the capture of one of
Sevastopol's key inner defenses,
Fort Maxim Gorky. Russian com
muniques emphatically denied
this. The Nazis would like to get
rid of Sevastopol because, as a
naval base from which Russian
submarines and destroyers have
worked, it has constantly impeded
German preparations for an offen
sive eastward against the Cauca
sus or southward against Turkey.
The whole thing is that the eGr
mans have been concentrating their
war efforts toward the East. If they
