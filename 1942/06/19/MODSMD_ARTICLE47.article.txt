MUSIC IN THE AIR, last times Sat
urday, at the Curran in San Fran
cisco.
John Charles Thomas steps down
from the grand opera stage to in
dulge with gusto in the corn of Jer
ome Kern's operetta, "Music in the
Air." He retains some operatic end
phrase grunts and stoops to a cli
max in falsetto, but on the whole
sings every bit as well as expected
and has a whale of a time doing it.
He is nevertheless partially
eclipsed by his leading lady, Irra
Petina, whose rich contralto, the
highlight of the evening, casts a
pretty obvious reflection on the Met
ropolitan.
All the other leads are adequate,
except Francis Lederer, who, though
he looks his part, neither sings nor
speaks very well. The chorus is one
of the finest an operetta ever had.
Thomas, Petina, and the chorus
are, in fact, far better than the oper
etta itself, which goes overtime milk
ing two of the songs for all they are
worth (rather, for more than they
are worth), and milks the less de
serving one the harder. According to
the program, Oscar Hammerstein
added new touches to the old book.
But the book still does not compare,
for example, to the Muheim-Zelver
script of the recent Stanford Spring
Show. And the ballerinas, pitiful
fill-ins, would be put to shame by
the simplest Jacques Poley routine.
—Covey.

could nab Suez and the Caucasus,
they could make mince pie out of ;
Turkey. From>there the drift into
India and a junction with the Japs
would not be too difficult.
But tough Russians, British, and.
recently, Americans, have taken
some of the sting out of the Nazi :
blitz. The Germans, it seems, are
getting a little winded.

There are five ranks in the Brit
ish peerage.

MUSIC IN THE AIR, last times Sat
urday, at the Curran in San Fran
cisco.
John Charles Thomas steps down
from the grand opera stage to in
dulge with gusto in the corn of Jer
ome Kern's operetta, "Music in the
Air." He retains some operatic end
phrase grunts and stoops to a cli
max in falsetto, but on the whole
sings every bit as well as expected
and has a whale of a time doing it.
He is nevertheless partially
eclipsed by his leading lady, Irra
Petina, whose rich contralto, the
highlight of the evening, casts a
pretty obvious reflection on the Met
ropolitan.
All the other leads are adequate,
except Francis Lederer, who, though
he looks his part, neither sings nor
speaks very well. The chorus is one
of the finest an operetta ever had.
Thomas, Petina, and the chorus
are, in fact, far better than the oper
etta itself, which goes overtime milk
ing two of the songs for all they are
worth (rather, for more than they
are worth), and milks the less de
serving one the harder. According to
the program, Oscar Hammerstein
added new touches to the old book.
But the book still does not compare,
for example, to the Muheim-Zelver
script of the recent Stanford Spring
Show. And the ballerinas, pitiful
fill-ins, would be put to shame by
the simplest Jacques Poley routine.
