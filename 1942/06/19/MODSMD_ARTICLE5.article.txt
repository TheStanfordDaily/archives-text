# Increased Enrollment 'Healthy' Says Wilbur
## 
### 
"This year's registration shows
that Stanford means business in re
gard to the war," said Dr. Ray Ly
man Wilbur, Stanford Chancellor, in
a statement to The Daily last night.
Elaborating upon this, Dr. Wilbur
pointed out that the registration for
the Summer Quarter has doubled
that of a year ago, and that he con
sidered this a healthy sign because
it demonstrated that Stanford men ;
and women, together with their par
ents, have definitely become aware
of the necessity of having college
trained men and women in respon
sible positions in a nation at war.
Dr. Wilbur stated that he consid
ered this increased enrollment "very
remarkable" and that he was
"pleased" with the situation. He !
further remarked that "all of this j
proves that Stanfordites and their !
parents know what this is all about." I
