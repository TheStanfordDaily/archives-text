# Registration Count Reaches 1,729
## First-Day Enrollment Sets New Summer Quarter High Total Enrollees Expected to Reach 2.000 by Late Monday Afternoon 
### 
Jumping Summer Quarter registration totals to a new record high. 1729
students registered on the first day of Summer Quarter yesterday. This
total is nearly twice the number registered on the opening day of Summer
Quarter last year, when 874 students registered.
This new record total of 1729 is almost half of the normal registration.

University officials expect the totaL
registration to reach the 2000 mark
by late Monday when most late
comers will have registered.
Included in yesterday's total reg
istration were 1143 men and 580!
women. Last year's Summer Quar
ter total included 503 men and 371
women. Most men students who
registered for this year's Summer
Quarter are streamlining their col
lege programs in order to receive
their degrees before being called to
service. Many of these men are in
officer training programs of the
Army, Navy, and Marine Reserve
Corps. These students will be al
lowed, in most cases, to finish their
college education before being|
called to active duty.

No figures were available to show
the ratio of undergraduates to grad
uates, but officials believe that the
number of graduate students has
sharply declined and that most of
the increase in Summer Quarter reg
istration is due to the large numbers
of new and returning undergradu
ates.
