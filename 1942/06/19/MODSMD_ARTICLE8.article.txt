# Required Gym Now Effective
## 
### 
Designed to improve the physical
fitness of undergraduates during the
war. Stanford has adopted a compul
sory program of physical education

for all students under 25 years of
age during their entire college ca
reer except during their final quar
ter of residence.

This sweeping change in the phys
ical education program was passed
by the Academic Council last Friday.
The Council also voted to require
Lower Division students taking mil-

itary training to take physical edu
cation also, and increased the maxi
mum amount of credit toward the
bachelor's degree which Upper Di
sion students may elect.

This new emphasis on compul
sory physical graining will approxi
mately double the number of stu
dents taking physical education,
stated Dr. O. N. Anderson, director
of the Men's Health Service.
SAME PROGRAM COMMON
'"All Pacific Coast Conference
schools have either adopted com
pulsory physical education, or are
planning such a program," stated
Dr. Anderson.
When students registered yester
day, they found that they were re
quired to sign up a* the B.A.C. or
the Women's Gym for one unit of
physical education this Summer
Quarter.
This training is designed to build
up the student's physical abilities,
with particular emphasis on correc
tion of any physical weaknesses.
Beginning Autumn Quarter, physical
fitness tests will be given to every
undergraduate. These tests will de
termine each student's strength,
agility, endurance, and co-ordina
tion. Then the physical education
program for each student will be
adapted toward improving the weak
nesses demonstrated by the physical
fitness test.
PROGRAM IN FIVE GROUPS
The compulsory physical educa
tion program is divided into five
groups of courses. Students are re
quired to take one course from each
group, unless they are seniors. The
groups are:
Gymnastics: Tumbling and appa
ratus.
Aquatics: Swimming, diving, and
water polo.
Combative activities: Boxing,
wrestling, and fencing.
Team sports: Football, basketball,
baseball, soccer, and rugby.
Individual sports: Tennis, golf,
handball, badminton, track and field,
and skiing.
