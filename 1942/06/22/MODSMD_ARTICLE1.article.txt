# Editors Confer On News Role In War Years
## Knowland Praises Nation's Newsmen For Self-Censorship 
### 
The American newspaper in a
world at war was the chief topic of
speeches and panel discussions at
the fifth annual California Editors'
Conference held at Stanford this
past week-end. The three-day con
ference was sponsored by the Cali
fornia Newspaper Publishers Asso
ciation and the Stanford Division of
Journalism.
More than 100 editors and pub
lishers listened to keynote speeches
by J. R. Knowland, publisher of the
Oakland Tribune, and Colonel Wal
ter M. Harrison, public relations
officer at Fort Knox and former
managing editor of the Oklahoma
City Oklahom an.
Knowland paid tribute to the
newspapers for their "wholehearted
co-operation with self - imposed
wartime censorship."
ON HONOR SYSTEM
"Newspapers are on an honor
system to present news of the war
and still not reveal military secrets,"
said Knowland. "Newspaper pub
lishers have forgotten religious, per
sonal. and business differences, and
are maintaining the right of the
American people through construc
tive criticism and an example of
united co-operation with the gov
ernment."
Col. Harrison criticized the use of
glaring headlines and overplaying of
minor allied gains by the newspa
pers. He defended the delays in re
leasing news of military action and
emphasized that the first interest of
the government is the security of
men and ships.
In answering the question of how
the newspapers can help the war
effort, Harrison urged every com
munity to eliminate the blot of illit
eracy so that manpower can be ef
fectively trained and used.
WEIGLE SPEAKS

Stanford spoke on "What the Editor
Should Know About Radio," empha
sizing the inroads which radio has

fessor Harold Quigley of Minnesota,

per Making" on Sunday.
