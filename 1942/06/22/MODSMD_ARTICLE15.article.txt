# Russ Peck Ties in AAV Vault; Tracksters Aid Farm Prestige
## Nichols, Card Ace jump 13-6 
### 
Iluss Peck, Stanford senior, added
the National Junior A.A.U. pole
vault championship to his Pacific-
Coast Conference title Friday at the
Randall's Island Stadium in New
York.
Peck, competing unattached from
Palo Alto, tied with Lute Nichols of
California at 13 feet G inches, only
two inches under the meet record.
Both men had hitchhiked from Chi
cago the previous day.
WARMER DAM TAKES ALL
Saturday in the Senior A.A.U.
meet Peck again vaulted 13-6, but
this time it gave him only a fifth
behind Cornelius Warmerdam's 15-
2*2 performance.
Ed Hertel, hurdling ace on this
year's Farm cinder team, took fifth
in both 110-meter high and 200-
meter low hurdle races in the senior
meet. Vern Hart went unplaced in
the high jump.
HELP OLYMPIC CLUB
However, former Indian trackmen
did much to aid the Olympic Club
in garnering second place in the
team scoring. Tom Montgomery
scored 12 points in taking third in
both 56-pound weight throw and
shot put.
Phil Fox, Stanford graduate of
1937, threw the discus 163 feet, good
enough to get him second place in
the event that he has won three
times.
