# New Buzzer Code Begins
## 
### 
'"Beginning this quarter the
switchboard operators are going to
use the buzzer code system when
calling men to the telephone," de
clared Dr. Stanley L. Sharp, assist
ant dean of men, in a notice distrib
uted to all men living in Toyon and
Encina.
'This means that in two-man
rooms the man whose family name
comes first in alphabetical order
will be wanted when the operator
buzzes once, and the fellow whose
surname comes second will respond
to two buzzes," he continued.
To make the system work, men
whose names are first should regis
ter with a capital L after his room
number. The other man should put
a capital M after his room number,
for example: 424 L Encina and 424 M
Encina. Dean Sharp said that men
in single rooms should place an L
after their room numbers.
Dr. Sharp concluded that the men
would no longer have to debate,
argue, match, or draw lots to see
who should answer the phone.
