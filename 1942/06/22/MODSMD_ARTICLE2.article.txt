# Bucket Brigade Douses Campus Grass Fire
## 
### 
"Fire Department? There's a grass fire behind the A.T.O. house and
it's spreading fast."
Ed Edwin was calmly announcing the fact over the Co-op telephone at
about 4:1U) Saturday afternoon.
"The Smith Ranch?" a Firehouse voice came back.

"No, back of the A.T.O. house, and
j it's spreading to the old Jap house,"
J Edwin repeated.
"Where is it?"
"On campus, the A.T.O. house,
Santa Ynez."
1 "Spell it."
Edwin spelled it.
"Well," said the Firehouse voice,
I "everybody's gone to Smith's Ranch,
j I'm the only one here."
CO-OP IN DANGER
By then the Co-op was in real
| danger. Chuck Taylor, who had first

seen the fire, rushed out with Jimmy
CofTis and others from the Delta Chi,
A.T.0.. and Phi Psi houses, and to
gether with the Co-op group, rushed
about attaching hoses—one to a hot
water faucet—beating with wet
gunny sacks, and carrying buckets
full of water. Meanwhile, the wind
had sent the blaze to all parts of
the dry lot and at one time Taylor,
with his back to the Co-op house
hedge, was battling against a fire
that was nipping at his shoe tips.
TRUCKS ARRIVE
Edwin put another nickel in the
slot, and dialed the Palo Alto sta
tion. He had become so exasper
ated that his directions were not
straight, but the Palo Alto fire
trucks arrived in good time. How
ever. by that time the volunteer
workers had won the fight, and only
a few spots needed wetting down to
wind up the hot performance.
The Stanford Fire Department
extinguished the ten-acre grass fire
at the Smith Ranch in a half-hour
operation.
