# Team Thanks Trip Donors

"Stanford gained many new friends
and supporters by the representa
tives of the track team and their per
formances," said Ed Stamm, stu
dent body president, upon his re
turn from the N.C.A.A. track meet
at Lincoln. Neb., and the Big Ten-
Pacific Coast meet at Evanston, 111.
Stamm, who took fourth in the
shotput in the nationals and second
in the Big Ten meet, expressed his
sincere thanks for the squad to all
alumni who assisted in sending the
team east.
lIERTEL SICK
Hertel took sick at Lincoln, ac
cording to Stamm, and coupled with
the fact that he was running the low
hurdles for the first time on a turn,
he failed to qualify. He was leading
in his heat but hit the last barrier
and was unable to recover. He had
better luck in the highs, taking
fourth in the finals.
In the Big Ten meet he ran the
two fastest races of his career in
taking seconds behind Bob Wright,
the Ohio State champion, who was a
double winner in the nationals.
Stamm estimated Hertel's time in
the lows approximately at 23.1 and
for the highs about 14.1. Wright won
the lows by a half a stride.
STAMM NOSED OUT
Stamm was leading the shot put in
the Big Ten meet with a toss of 50
feet inches until the last throw
when Southern California's Carl
Merritt edged him out by an inch
and a half.
Vern Hart's good jumping in the
Evanston meet can be attributed to
the taping of his foot by the Olympic
Club trainer. Hart had been troubled
all year with a bone in his foot that
slips out of place, impeding his
jumping ability.
Russ Peck's vaulting pole was de
layed in transit from Evanston to
Lincoln, and he had to jump with a
borrowed pole, yet managed to get a
third place.
"It's good to be back on the cam
pus after such a fine trip. I think
next year's track prospects for
Pitch look very good. We missed
the presence of Captain Cie?|*
'"Ripper" Kern on the trip," said
Stamm as he hurried off to join
the freshmen on their trek up
Stanford Hill for the barbecue.
It is a greater distance from Tex
arkana, Tex., to El Paso, Tex., than
from Texarkana to Chicago.
