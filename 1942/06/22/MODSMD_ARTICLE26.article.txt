# False Optimism
## 
### 
THAT optimism is here again.
People are talking about the
"great naval victories of the
Coral Sea and Midway," about
"a second front in Europe this
summer," and about the war be
fog over within a year.
These beliefs are either un
bounded or grossly exaggerated.
Victories over Jap task forces
in the Coral Sea and Midway
battles are encouraging, but
don't demonstrate any
thing more than defensive
strength. And the battle is still
swirling around the fog-shroud
ed Aleutians.
In China and North Africa the
.situation is desperate. The Rus
sians are still holding, but the
main Nazi offensive hasn't been
unleashed as yet—Kharkov and
Sevastopol are only local en
gagements.
That false optimism pervaded
"he California Editors' Confer
ence here at Stanford this past
veek-end. The editors realized
hat somehow the people were
'ar more optimistic than was the
var situation.
Publisher Knowland of the
Dakland Tribune warned that
•he situation looked black—"at
: ts lowest ebb." Col. Harrison of
p ort Mason definitely said that
•he problem of logistics rele
gates the opening of a second
'ront in Europe far into the fu
ture.
The editors realized that some
body was to blame for this false
optimism. Some blamed the
government, and many blamed
•he Army and Navy for with
holding news of U.S. losses.
But the press and the public
deserve much of the blame.
Newspapers have consistently
overemphasized minor United
Nations' gains as major victo
ries. Remember the Russian
drive on Kharkov?
And the public is to blame be
cause it specializes in wishftil
thinking, and it patronizes news
capers which cater to that
thinking. So long as the public
buys and supports newspapers
which distort news to make it
palatable, this false optimism
will prevail.
The remedy must be guick
and complete. Except in cases
of absolute necessity, Army and
Navy communigues should de
fail Allied losses as well as en
emy losses. Newspapers must
fairly judge news by its import
ance, not by whether it is favor
able or not.
The public should demand a
remedy—for only then will the
public realize that this is a long,
hard fight for survival—and only
then will the American people
be prepared for the sacrifices
and the hardships necessary for
victory.—Charlie Allen

These beliefs are either un
bounded or grossly exaggerated.
Victories over Jap task forces
in the Coral Sea and Midway
battles are encouraging, but
don't demonstrate any
thing more than defensive
strength. And the battle is still
swirling around the fog-shroud
ed Aleutians.
In China and North Africa the
.situation is desperate. The Rus
sians are still holding, but the
main Nazi offensive hasn't been
unleashed as yet—Kharkov and
Sevastopol are only local en
gagements.
That false optimism pervaded
"he California Editors' Confer
ence here at Stanford this past
veek-end. The editors realized
hat somehow the people were
'ar more optimistic than was the
var situation.
Publisher Knowland of the
Dakland Tribune warned that
•he situation looked black—"at
: ts lowest ebb." Col. Harrison of
p ort Mason definitely said that
•he problem of logistics rele
gates the opening of a second
'ront in Europe far into the fu
ture.
The editors realized that some
body was to blame for this false
optimism. Some blamed the
government, and many blamed
•he Army and Navy for with
holding news of U.S. losses.
But the press and the public
deserve much of the blame.
Newspapers have consistently
overemphasized minor United
Nations' gains as major victo
ries. Remember the Russian
drive on Kharkov?
And the public is to blame be
cause it specializes in wishftil
thinking, and it patronizes news
capers which cater to that
thinking. So long as the public
buys and supports newspapers
which distort news to make it
palatable, this false optimism
will prevail.
The remedy must be guick
and complete. Except in cases
of absolute necessity, Army and
Navy communigues should de
fail Allied losses as well as en
emy losses. Newspapers must
fairly judge news by its import
ance, not by whether it is favor
able or not.
The public should demand a
remedy—for only then will the
public realize that this is a long,
hard fight for survival—and only
then will the American people
be prepared for the sacrifices
and the hardships necessary for
victory.—Charlie Allen

"great naval victories of the
Coral Sea and Midway," about
"a second front in Europe this
summer," and about the war be
