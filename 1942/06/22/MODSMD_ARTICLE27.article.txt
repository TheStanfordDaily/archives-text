### BILL STEIF 
in Libya Marshal Rommel
is turning it on. He has chased
part of the British desert army into
the defenses of Tobruk where, ac
cording to latest radio reports, des
perate fighting continues with the
Germans slicing into portions of the
inner lines. The rest of the British
army is lined up along the Egyptian
border and made a pair of brief
sorties yesterday in which they
turned back what seem to have been
several Nazi reconnaissance col
umns.
Meanwhile, it is pretty well estab
lished that the coastal road between
Tobruk and Bardia has fallen into
German hands, while the fate of
Bardia itself, five miles from the
Egyptian border, is in grave doubt.
The Libyan war together with the
problem of when, where, and how
to open a second European front

are unquestionably the topics which
Winston Churchill and Franklin
Roosevelt are mulling over in their
secret conferences in the East. In
the last week, however, the possi
bility of a new front has become in
finitely more remote than it was a
week ago.
The big problem now is to stop
Adolf from his contemplated drive
into the Near East. At Sevastopol
the Russians, though still holding on,
are taking a terrific beating, and the
Germans, in addition, seem to be
advancing against Marshall Simeon
Timoshenko's boys in the Kharkov
sector. The Kharkov fighting, how
ever, cannot yet be classed as major
action because the Nazis must con
tinue to pour it on in the Crimea.
* )|( *
JT IS fairly obvious the Sevastopol
and the Tobruk-Bardia battles
are the two upon which hang the
destiny of Hitler's eastern drive. If
the Russian toe-hold in the Black
Sea is broken and the Nazis are able
to drive through Egypt to the
Suez, they can breeze into Turkey,
Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan,
the Caucasus, Iran, and India. Al
ready there are signs that they are
turning on typical Nazi pressure
against Turkey. The attempted as
sassination of Franz von Papen, the
German ambassadorial trouble
shooter, is being pinned upon a pair
of Russians in what appears to be
a pretty obvious frame-up.
Over hero on the Western Hem
isphere the Navy, through a Thir
teenth Naval District spokesman,
says the Japs in the Aleutians are
"getting smacked whenever there
is a rift in the fog banks." This Navy
spokesman adds, "If the public is
confused about the situation in west
ern Alaska, then so is the enemy." I
wonder about that statement. I
wouldn't doubt the Navy in the least,
but the logic of those words seems
a bit strange. Why should the Japs
be confused because you and I are
confused? I certainly hope the
Navy is right.

is turning it on. He has chased
part of the British desert army into
the defenses of Tobruk where, ac
cording to latest radio reports, des
perate fighting continues with the
Germans slicing into portions of the
inner lines. The rest of the British
army is lined up along the Egyptian
border and made a pair of brief
sorties yesterday in which they
turned back what seem to have been
several Nazi reconnaissance col
umns.
Meanwhile, it is pretty well estab
lished that the coastal road between
Tobruk and Bardia has fallen into
German hands, while the fate of
Bardia itself, five miles from the
Egyptian border, is in grave doubt.
The Libyan war together with the
problem of when, where, and how
to open a second European front

are unquestionably the topics which
Winston Churchill and Franklin
Roosevelt are mulling over in their
secret conferences in the East. In
the last week, however, the possi
bility of a new front has become in
finitely more remote than it was a
week ago.
The big problem now is to stop
Adolf from his contemplated drive
into the Near East. At Sevastopol
the Russians, though still holding on,
are taking a terrific beating, and the
Germans, in addition, seem to be
advancing against Marshall Simeon
Timoshenko's boys in the Kharkov
sector. The Kharkov fighting, how
ever, cannot yet be classed as major
action because the Nazis must con
tinue to pour it on in the Crimea.

JT IS fairly obvious the Sevastopol
and the Tobruk-Bardia battles
are the two upon which hang the
destiny of Hitler's eastern drive. If
the Russian toe-hold in the Black
Sea is broken and the Nazis are able
to drive through Egypt to the
Suez, they can breeze into Turkey,
Iraq, Syria, Palestine, Afghanistan,
the Caucasus, Iran, and India. Al
ready there are signs that they are
turning on typical Nazi pressure
against Turkey. The attempted as
sassination of Franz von Papen, the
German ambassadorial trouble
shooter, is being pinned upon a pair
of Russians in what appears to be
a pretty obvious frame-up.
Over hero on the Western Hem
isphere the Navy, through a Thir
teenth Naval District spokesman,
says the Japs in the Aleutians are
"getting smacked whenever there
is a rift in the fog banks." This Navy
spokesman adds, "If the public is
confused about the situation in west
ern Alaska, then so is the enemy." I
wonder about that statement. I
wouldn't doubt the Navy in the least,
but the logic of those words seems
a bit strange. Why should the Japs
be confused because you and I are
confused? I certainly hope the
Navy is right.
