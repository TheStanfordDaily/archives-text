# 'Ship Ahoy' Thrills Kids Bores Adults
## 
### 
"SHIP AHOY," now playing at
the Stanford in Palo Alto.
"Ship Ahoy" is practically undi
luted vaudeville, and therefore will
! unquestionably be one of the most
successful pictures of the year. It
will rank in the first ten for all
people under 12 years of age.
The kids in the theater were
screaming with delight at the mug
ging of Skelton and Lahr. In fact,
this ancient brand of slapstick was
not nearly so funny as the ejacula
tions of an enraptured child four
rows down. If he is not there when
you see the show, the show prob
ably won't be nearly so good.
PAST MASTER
Eleanor Powell is quite definitely
a past master of the technique of
dancing. But wouldn't you as soon
see most anyone else dance? Cam
pus swing fans will likely find Tom
my Dorsey and his orchestra the one
attraction of the picture.
Otherwise, "Ship Ahoy" is the
ordinary species of summer movies
I which have been coming around
j every year as certainly as the new
j crop of- ragweed. And like most
I pictures of its type, there is an ad
j mixture of enemy spies and blatant
patriotism thrown in. At the bottom
of the whole matter, Red Skelton
j might be fairly good, except that
| Bob Hope is also in the business.
BETTER FILM
Now "Kid Glove Killer" is a much
j better film than "Ship Ahoy." Most
j of the credit is due Van Heflin, one
j of the best actors of the screen. His
studio deserves a sound threshing
j for ever having cast him in a B
| picture.
And neither of these pictures is
| as good as the two which played
j over the week-end, of which two.
J "Moontide" is one of the handful of
I first-rate dramas of the season. So
| it may all have been a mistake of
j scheduling, which could have been
| avoided by simply making "Moon
! tide" the Sunday picture.â€”Covey
