### 
Sculptor Carroll Barnes, 25, using
axes and chisels, has hewed away
several tons of chips from a huge
block of a giant redwood tree, which
he is shaping into a monumental
statue of Paul Bunyan. The statue,
which commemorates the giant leg
endary hero of the lumber camps,
will be erected in Sequoia Park.
