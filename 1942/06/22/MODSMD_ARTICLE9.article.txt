# Engineering School Adds New Course
## 
### 
A new program, designed to meet
the demand for industrial engineers
caused by the expansion of war in
dustries, is being offered at Stanford,
according to Professor Samuel S.
Morris.
In the new program which the en
gineering departments and the Grad
uate School of Business are co-oper
ating to operate, students will be abla
to complete work in industrial engi
neering on either the continuous
session plan of attending classes for
four quarters a year for three years,
or may choose to follow the regular
four-year, three-quarter plan.
Work in this new field can be
carried out in the same manner that,
engineering students have worked
for the A.B. degree.
