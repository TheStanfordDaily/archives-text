to 1939. He is working at the Per
manente plant in Los Altos this
summer.
Lindskog came to Stanford from
Santa Ana J.C. and played his first
football on the 1940 Rose Bowl team,
taking the center position away from
two veterans of the 1939 team. He
was mentioned on several All-Coast
teams along with Abner Wilson of
Oregon and Quentin Greenough of
Oregon State.
FRYE JOINS NAVY
A temporary leave of absence was
granted Clayton Frye, instructor in
hygiene and physical education and
boxing coach, who has joined the
Navy. Lindskog will probably take
over Frye's duties, having been a
Golden Gloves heavyweight cham
pion in Montana before coming to
Stanford.
