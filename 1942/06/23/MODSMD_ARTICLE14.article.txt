# Council Formed For Conservation
## 
### 
A new Conservation Council,
combining the work formerly done
by the Consumer and Salvage com
mittees, will hold its first meeting
tomorrow afternoon at 5 o'clock.
This council is made up of the
heads of three committees: the Sal
vage Committee, headed by Bill
Hutchinson, a Consumer Education
Committee, under Bev Duncan, and
a Conservation Committee, headed
by Pete Pagett.
The main work of this council will
be to educate the student for war
time living, and to show how human
and material waste can and must be
eliminated.
