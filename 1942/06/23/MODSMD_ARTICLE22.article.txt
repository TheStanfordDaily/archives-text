[yjURAL GONFALON AGAIN:
Stanford's summer mural soft
ball chase will be explained, talked
about, worked over, and "had
around" this afternoon for any and
all interested in formation of regu
lar league play. In charge of oper
ations is Harry Shipkey, a big man
to a big job. If you hanker for
baseball drop around to Room 5 of
the School of Health Building at
4:30 this afternoon.

TRISH JIMMY PHELAN popped
back into the local grid scheme
the other day with a coaching job at
St. Mary's. Long in the coaching
game. Phelan's appointment is an
other sure sign that football is get
ting under way at another Bay
school. First it was Minnesota, then
Illinois, and subsequently various
West Coast schools that Phelan was
going to coach, but none material
ized.
Then, out of the ozone, comes his
appointment at St. Mary's. At the
Gael roost Phelan will probably
shoot his Notre Dame system at coast
fans. Jimmy's rating is even strong
er here than in Seattle, probably be
cause of the consistent showing of
his Huskies against University of
California and Stanford.

COME GUYS must have been blue

BY THE U. 5.0.: here's
the new golf way to make money
for the United Service Organization—
through the U.S.G.A. (United States
Golf Association to you), its 5,200
member clubs have been asked to
designate one sand trap as the
''U.S.O. trap" with a fine of 25 cents
for men and 10 cents for women
whose shots fall into it.
So don't cuss out that sand pit—
trap a Jap instead.

BY THE U. 5.0.: here's
the new golf way to make money
for the United Service Organization—
through the U.S.G.A. (United States
Golf Association to you), its 5,200
member clubs have been asked to
designate one sand trap as the
''U.S.O. trap" with a fine of 25 cents
for men and 10 cents for women
whose shots fall into it.
So don't cuss out that sand pit—
trap a Jap instead.
[yjURAL GONFALON AGAIN:
Stanford's summer mural soft
ball chase will be explained, talked
about, worked over, and "had
around" this afternoon for any and
all interested in formation of regu
lar league play. In charge of oper
ations is Harry Shipkey, a big man
to a big job. If you hanker for
baseball drop around to Room 5 of
the School of Health Building at
4:30 this afternoon.

TRISH JIMMY PHELAN popped
back into the local grid scheme
the other day with a coaching job at
St. Mary's. Long in the coaching
game. Phelan's appointment is an
other sure sign that football is get
ting under way at another Bay
school. First it was Minnesota, then
Illinois, and subsequently various
West Coast schools that Phelan was
going to coach, but none material
ized.
Then, out of the ozone, comes his
appointment at St. Mary's. At the
Gael roost Phelan will probably
shoot his Notre Dame system at coast
fans. Jimmy's rating is even strong
er here than in Seattle, probably be
cause of the consistent showing of
his Huskies against University of
California and Stanford.
