# Card Golfers Lead in NCAA Play; Dee, Schroeder Win in First Round
## 
### 
Stanford's Bud Brownell and"
George Traphagen, number one man
and number four man, respectively,
on Eddie Twiggs' Indian golf team,
j tied for second with 71's behind
Northwestern's Dick Haskell after
{ the first round of qualifying play in
the National Intercollegiate tourney
] at South Bend yesterday.
Haskell's three-under-par G9 gave
him the lead in the battle for the
I N.C.A.A. medalist crown won last
year by Earl Stewart, tourney tillist
from L.S.U. Haskell was out in 34
] and back in 35.
Brownell and Traphagen both
I fired 36's for the first nine, 35's for
i the back nine, as the Indians moved
into the lead for the team title they
| won last year by the record-breaking
score of 580 strokes.
The Stanford team must cut four
strokes off yesterday's score in the
second round today to equal last
year's record score, a feat Coach
Twiggs has predicted to be a long
way off on a par-72 course.
However, the fact that the Indians
were close gives evidence that Stan
ford is once again near the top as
! far as turning out great college golf
1 teams is concerned.

First-seeded Ted Schroeder, one
of the top amateur netters in the
business, and Larry Dee, seeded
sixth, both won their opening-round
matches in the National Intercolle
giate tennis tourney at New Or
leans yesterday.
Schroeder, number one man on the
Stanford tennis team, had little
trouble in moving over David Bry
ant Jr., Austin College. 6-1, 6-0.
Meanwhile, Dee, third on the Indian
tennis ladder, knocked over Kala
mazoo's Will Culver, 6-4. 6-2, held
at Houston.
