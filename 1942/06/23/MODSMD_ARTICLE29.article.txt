NEXT Tuesday at midnight
President Roosevelt's drive
for scrap rubber closes. As he
stated in his last broadcast, the
United States has enough rub
ber for most purposes for this
year, but in 1943 our country
A/ill face a great shortage which
must be made up now.
The main purpose of the
present drive, which started
fune 15, is to enable the War
Production Board's Bureau of
Industrial Conservation to count
the amount of available rubber
.vhich is lying useless in base
ments, garages, and offices. Al
together we need about 655,000
'.ons to carry on this war on a
• arge enough scale to be effec
tive.
Local salvage committees —
12,000 in all — set up in each
state by the Bureau will play a
major role in the effort locally.
Stanford has such a committee
mder the supervision of Bob
Collins with Charlie Mcßrian as
head of the rubber salvage pro
gram.
We at Stanford got a late start
'n the drive because we were
"raught in the middle of vacation,
but to date we have already col
lected 2,000 pounds, and we still
have a week to go. It's pretty
difficult to think of everything
the first few days of school, but
in a way we are lucky that this
campaign hit us when it did, for
with all of the rooms being
cleaned we can dig around and
uncover a lot of goods that can
be turned over to the govern
ment.
The rubber should be taken
to the Corporation Yard, where
a depository is set up, or it can
be taken to the campus service
station next door to the Fire
house. The service station and
corp yard will pay one cent per
pound for material turned in.
The government pays the agen
cies back for the money they
pay out. If you have only a
small amount and do not choose
to take the money for just a few
pounds, the money the agencies
will receive from the govern
ment will be turned over to the
Stanford Convalescent Home. In
other words, the profit motive is
eliminated entirely.
This is a good opportunity for
all of us to do ourselves and the
government a favor: we can get
rid of a lot of junk around our
rooms and turn it over to the
government to be used for the
national offense.

Local salvage committees —
12,000 in all — set up in each
state by the Bureau will play a
major role in the effort locally.
Stanford has such a committee
mder the supervision of Bob
Collins with Charlie Mcßrian as
head of the rubber salvage pro
gram.
We at Stanford got a late start
'n the drive because we were
"raught in the middle of vacation,
but to date we have already col
lected 2,000 pounds, and we still
have a week to go. It's pretty
difficult to think of everything
the first few days of school, but
in a way we are lucky that this
campaign hit us when it did, for
with all of the rooms being
cleaned we can dig around and
uncover a lot of goods that can
be turned over to the govern
ment.
The rubber should be taken
to the Corporation Yard, where
a depository is set up, or it can
be taken to the campus service
station next door to the Fire
house. The service station and
corp yard will pay one cent per
pound for material turned in.
The government pays the agen
cies back for the money they
pay out. If you have only a
small amount and do not choose
to take the money for just a few
pounds, the money the agencies
will receive from the govern
ment will be turned over to the
Stanford Convalescent Home. In
other words, the profit motive is
eliminated entirely.
This is a good opportunity for
all of us to do ourselves and the
government a favor: we can get
rid of a lot of junk around our
rooms and turn it over to the
government to be used for the
national offense.
NEXT Tuesday at midnight
President Roosevelt's drive
for scrap rubber closes. As he
stated in his last broadcast, the
United States has enough rub
ber for most purposes for this
year, but in 1943 our country
A/ill face a great shortage which
must be made up now.
The main purpose of the
present drive, which started
fune 15, is to enable the War
Production Board's Bureau of
Industrial Conservation to count
the amount of available rubber
.vhich is lying useless in base
ments, garages, and offices. Al
together we need about 655,000
'.ons to carry on this war on a
• arge enough scale to be effec
tive.
