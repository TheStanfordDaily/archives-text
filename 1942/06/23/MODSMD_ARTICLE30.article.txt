# Bull Session
## 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
GENESIS AND REVELATIONS
IT WOULD perhaps be well for the
benefit of those students new to
Stanford to explain what is Bull
Session.
Back in 192(3 a column entitled
"The Bull Session" first appeared.
It grew strong on the then-raging
controversy of whether there should
or should not be a period of "indoc
trination" operated by the sopho
mores and designed to adjust fresh
men to Stanford life.
The column continued until 1929,
flourishing on controversy and criti
cism. and somewhere along the line
becoming "The Bullsession." How
ever, in the spring of 1929 it waned
and died, perhaps because people
with money in their jeans can't be
bothered with controversy.
# * *
In its place, oddly enough, ap
peared a feature called "Twenty
five Years Ago at Stanford." All this
while there was a column running
called "Cabbages and Things." which
concerned itself with the trivialities
of campus life.
Then in the spring of '31, in an ef
fort to take full advantage of the
talents of Abe Mellinkoff, Bull Ses
sion was revived to be a column of
"discussion."
For the past eleven years it has
held its own, mainly through the
ability of such men as Dave and
Sherm Mellinkoff. brothers of the
founder of the present series, of
John Cobb.s, and very recently of
Cheslie Saroyan.
* * *
gULL SESSION will run twice a
week, on Tuesday and Thursday
mornings. In the "other three"
quarters Bull Session and History...
1942 are daily features, due partly
to the fact that the paper then is
larger, and there is a bigger staff.
Because there is no United Press
service for the summer paper, our
contact with the outside world will
be maintained through Bill Steif and
his History... 1942 column.
As a combined teletype machine
and foreign correspondent, he will
endeavor to keep us posted on
things that are happening in the
world out there where it is ru
mored there is not only a war going
on but coca-cola is becoming
scarce.
« St *
£T is never wise to give advice to
freshmen or women; after all they
know just about everything, and, on
the whole, regret that they know it.
However, there are more ill-con
ceived notions in the minds of in
cipient Stanfordites than there are
ways to "win" the war.
These erroneous impressions arise,
in the main, from movies, magazines,
and myths cherished and repeated
by fifty-year-old alumni. It may
not lie in the stadium or the front
hall of Lagunita, nor is it merely a
way to get a commission.
Stanford was never rah-rah in
the wild sense, and the war has re
cently had a marked effect on life
on and off the Quad. It is at last
being realized that it is no sin to
know what is going on in the world
outside. It has almost become fash
ionable to be mentally alert and re
ceptive to new ideas.
This is the first time that a fresh
man class has entered Stanford in a
non-football quarter. This is the
first freshman class of the new
speed-up course. Welcome frosh
and good luck.

The Stanford Daily, through
its campus opinion column, of
fers an opportunity for students
and professors to air their views
on campus and nationwide ques
tions. All letters should be ad
dressed to the editor and must
be signed. If the name is to be
withheld, that should be speci
fied at the end of the communi
cation.

IT WOULD perhaps be well for the
benefit of those students new to
Stanford to explain what is Bull
Session.
Back in 192(3 a column entitled
"The Bull Session" first appeared.
It grew strong on the then-raging
controversy of whether there should
or should not be a period of "indoc
trination" operated by the sopho
mores and designed to adjust fresh
men to Stanford life.
The column continued until 1929,
flourishing on controversy and criti
cism. and somewhere along the line
becoming "The Bullsession." How
ever, in the spring of 1929 it waned
and died, perhaps because people
with money in their jeans can't be
bothered with controversy.

In its place, oddly enough, ap
peared a feature called "Twenty
five Years Ago at Stanford." All this
while there was a column running

concerned itself with the trivialities
of campus life.
Then in the spring of '31, in an ef
fort to take full advantage of the
talents of Abe Mellinkoff, Bull Ses
sion was revived to be a column of
"discussion."
For the past eleven years it has
held its own, mainly through the
ability of such men as Dave and
Sherm Mellinkoff. brothers of the
founder of the present series, of
John Cobb.s, and very recently of
Cheslie Saroyan.

gULL SESSION will run twice a
week, on Tuesday and Thursday
mornings. In the "other three"
quarters Bull Session and History...
1942 are daily features, due partly
to the fact that the paper then is
larger, and there is a bigger staff.
Because there is no United Press
service for the summer paper, our
contact with the outside world will
be maintained through Bill Steif and
his History... 1942 column.
As a combined teletype machine
and foreign correspondent, he will
endeavor to keep us posted on
things that are happening in the
world out there where it is ru
mored there is not only a war going
on but coca-cola is becoming
scarce.

£T is never wise to give advice to
freshmen or women; after all they
know just about everything, and, on
the whole, regret that they know it.
However, there are more ill-con
ceived notions in the minds of in
cipient Stanfordites than there are
ways to "win" the war.
These erroneous impressions arise,
in the main, from movies, magazines,
and myths cherished and repeated
by fifty-year-old alumni. It may
not lie in the stadium or the front
hall of Lagunita, nor is it merely a
way to get a commission.
Stanford was never rah-rah in
the wild sense, and the war has re
cently had a marked effect on life
on and off the Quad. It is at last
being realized that it is no sin to
know what is going on in the world
outside. It has almost become fash
ionable to be mentally alert and re
ceptive to new ideas.
This is the first time that a fresh
man class has entered Stanford in a
non-football quarter. This is the
first freshman class of the new
speed-up course. Welcome frosh
and good luck.

The Stanford Daily, through
its campus opinion column, of
fers an opportunity for students
and professors to air their views
on campus and nationwide ques
tions. All letters should be ad
dressed to the editor and must
be signed. If the name is to be
withheld, that should be speci
fied at the end of the communi
cation.
