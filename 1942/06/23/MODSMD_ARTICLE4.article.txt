# Corp Yard, Shell Station Take Rubber
## 
### 
All Stanford students and other
University residents can contribute
to the President's scrap rubber drive
at the Corporation Yard or at the
campus service station where rub
ber will be bought at 1 cent per
pound.
Students, faculty, and campus res
idents at Stanford will be reached
by the drive in an effort to collect
all scrap rubber items available,
such as old tires and tubes, garden
hose, shoes, tennis balls and sport
ing wear, and rubber mats and
pads.
TWO TONS SO FAR
To date two tons of scrap rubber
have been turned in at Stanford. A
total of at least 40 tons is expected
to be received at Stanford before
June 30, according to Charles Mc-
Brian, the head of the scrap rubber
drive at Stanford.
Government money received by
the service station for rubber which
is donated at the two campus col
lection centers will go to the Con
valescent Home.
!VI(-BRIAN HEADS DRIVE
The collection of scrap rubber is
part of Stanford's War Activities
Program. Charles Mc√ürian, the
head of the scrap rubber drive, is
being assisted by Vernice Hines in
charge of publicity, Jimmy Miller,
contacting i-esidences, and Barbara
Gregg in charge of the Speakers'
Bureau.
The national scrap rubber cam
paign began at 12:01 a.m. June 15,
and will end at midnight June 30.
Reports from federal sources in
Washington, D.C.. show the entire
stockpile of rubber to be less than
700,000 tons, which is about what
was consumed last year. Such
sources as synthetic rubber, guayule
plants, and South American impor
tations will bring no relief for sev
eral years.
