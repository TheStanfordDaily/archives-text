# 'Dimes for Diplomas' Nets Only Thirty-five Dollars
## 
### 
Donated dimes clinked into Rally Committee's "Dimes for Diplomas"
till last night, to the tune of $35.
"The donations were disappointing," remarked Jim Mcßrier. "Cut still
a good start considering the small amount of publicity. It's a good cause
and we ought to triple tonight's figure next week."

* The "cause" referred to is that of
students compelled to leave Stan
ford, within two quarters of gradua
j tion. to enlist in the armed services.
When the war is concluded, many of
these men will be given one-quarter
scholarships financed by the Dimes
for Diplomas drive.
Rally Com has taken control of
the drive from the War Activities
Board, which conducted the cam
paign last quarter. Students are re
quested to donate a dime weekly—
each Monday night. Rally Com has
designated Monday, rather than
Wednesday, for collections to avoid
! conflict with Stamp and Bond sales.
