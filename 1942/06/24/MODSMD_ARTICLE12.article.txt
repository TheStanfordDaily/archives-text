# Stanford Students Speed Education, Hasten Victory
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Since 1918, vacationing profs and
businessmen have had the run of
the campus during summer quar
ters. It was somewhat the same
story year in and out, with summer
registration coasting along on an
even keel.
Then, in '39, Adolf blitzed around
the Maginot, student sojourns at
Tahoe slackened, and summer en
rollment swelled to nearly 1000. War
had made youth academic conscious.
When Tojo wounded Pearl Har
bor, Stanford's administration bol
stered the summer curricula and in
'42 vacationing profs and business
men found themselves engulfed in a
flood of student enrollees, that
doubled the usual summer registra
tion. A new story hovered beneath
;he surface.
STANFORD WAR BOARD
Bob Collins, chairman of War
Activities Board is registered this
summer. Herein lies the story.
Prior to last March, Collins con
fined his activities to the run of the
mill. One day Collins grew restless,
besieged the Excom with queries
and suggestions for an extensive
war program. His action had effect
and overnight the War Activities
Board was created, with Collins as
boss.

* "We had a job to do. We got j
rolling and continued rolling with !
constant pushing . . . and we can't j
let up," remarked Collins. That's j
why he's here this summer.
The women's story is little differ- ;
i ent, as put forth by Helen Bergman, !
chairman of Women's Council.
According to Helen, "It's up to ,
the younger women to outfit them- !
selves with a solid education, while
the men battle and the oldsters run !
the war."
TYPICAL STUDENT
Bill Ohlandt, engineering major in I
the Army Air Corps deferment plan,
is registered this summer to speed
up his education and "the war on !
the Japs." Summer quarter enables
Ohlandt to begin flight training six
t months earlier.
On the whole, it's a sober youth at |
Stanford this summer and. as Bob. '
j Helen and Bill put it, "this fourth
I quarter has brought out the dead i
j earnestness of 1942 collegians."

mill. One day Collins grew restless,
besieged the Excom with queries
and suggestions for an extensive
war program. His action had effect
and overnight the War Activities
Board was created, with Collins as
boss.

* "We had a job to do. We got j
rolling and continued rolling with !
constant pushing . . . and we can't j
let up," remarked Collins. That's j
why he's here this summer.
The women's story is little differ- ;
i ent, as put forth by Helen Bergman, !
chairman of Women's Council.
According to Helen, "It's up to ,
the younger women to outfit them- !
selves with a solid education, while
the men battle and the oldsters run !
the war."
TYPICAL STUDENT
Bill Ohlandt, engineering major in I
the Army Air Corps deferment plan,
is registered this summer to speed
up his education and "the war on !
the Japs." Summer quarter enables
Ohlandt to begin flight training six
t months earlier.
On the whole, it's a sober youth at |
Stanford this summer and. as Bob. '
j Helen and Bill put it, "this fourth
I quarter has brought out the dead i
j earnestness of 1942 collegians."
Since 1918, vacationing profs and
businessmen have had the run of
the campus during summer quar
ters. It was somewhat the same
story year in and out, with summer
registration coasting along on an
even keel.
Then, in '39, Adolf blitzed around
the Maginot, student sojourns at
Tahoe slackened, and summer en
rollment swelled to nearly 1000. War
had made youth academic conscious.
When Tojo wounded Pearl Har
bor, Stanford's administration bol
stered the summer curricula and in
'42 vacationing profs and business
men found themselves engulfed in a
flood of student enrollees, that
doubled the usual summer registra
tion. A new story hovered beneath
;he surface.
