# Shipkey to Screen '39, '40 Summer Murals Tomorrow Afternoon, 4:45
## 
### 
Eleven Softball managers met
yesterday and drafted plans for
the coming Summer Quarter Soft
ball League under the direction of
Harry Shipkey.
Working with a tentative list of
24 teams, all managers and inter
ested players will meet in Room 2
of the School of Education Build
ing tomorrow to complete sched
ules and rules. Moving pictures of
tbe 1939 and 1940 summer series
will be shown at 4:45, after which
the business meeting will start.
Because the Summer League is
self-supporting, each player must
pay 50 cents to defray the cost of
umpires, upkeep of grounds, and
equipment. Each team must have
a minimum of 10 players, with no
maximum to tbe number on a
squad, as long as the per capita
fee is paid.
Unlike other quarters, letter
men are eligible for intramural
play. All infractions of rules arc
to be beard and judged by tbe
Board of Managers, All persons

enrolled for Summer Quarter are
eligible.
The 15)41 champions, Spar Ducks,
under the direction of Ned Johns,
are back again this year. Johns is
on leave from the University of
Oregon, and will probably have
another strong outfit with hopes
of retaining the Softball title.
It is hoped that enough teams
will sign up so that two leagues
may be formed, one for graduate
students, the other for undergrad
uates. A playoff will be held and
a trophy awarded the winner.
All teams will play twice a week
—on Tuesday and Thursday af
ternoons— with a round-robin
league.
