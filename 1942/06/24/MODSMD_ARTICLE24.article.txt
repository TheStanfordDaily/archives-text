# An Interesting Comparison
## 
### 
IT IS interesting to compare
the wartime university life in
Great Britain with that in this
country. According to a maga
zine released by the British In
formation Services, the normal
time which a non-technical stu
dent can put in at a university
before being called is now one
academic year. This includes
any college student, no matter
what his age may be.
On the other hand freshmen
in this country are practically as
sured of two years of education
ind possibly more if they take
advantage of the army, navy,
and marine plans to defer pros
pective officers. There is special
deferment in England, also, for
'hose technical students who
are taking special training. In
fact, they may stay for the full
five years, in some cases in
medical courses.
But the British student's lei
sure-time activities have defi
nitely been curtailed. Time has
to be found day by day for
'raining the ground or air corps,
to which all who seek deferment
must belong unless they are un
dertaking some eguivalent serv
ice such as civil defense. Night
by night relays of fire-watchers
are on duty.
Games have been drastically
cut for sheer lack of time, espe
cially in the residential universi
ties (which would correspond to
Stanford), where before the war
some form of outdoor exercise
was a daily rather than a weekly
">r bi-weekly evenU
"The only visible effect of this
change has been a marked im
provement in the men's bear
ing. In this respect parades can
do what the football field can
not, though much of the pre
service training now takes place
in lecture-rooms and not on the
parade-ground, thus taxing a
man's intelligence as well as his
muscles."
More serious than the loss of
'eisure time to the wartime un
dergraduate is the curtailment
of art, music, the theater, and
speakers from outside," mainly !
because of lack of time.
In England the students, pro
fessors, and parents have had to
face the stark realities of a
country at war. We are grad
ually beginning to "come
around" in the United States,
but it probably will take a tre
mendous bolt out of the blue in
the form of huge lap or Nazi
bombers to stir us to the proper
mental attitude. This does not
mean that there are not those
among us today who are far—
or should it be near— sighted
enough to know that we are at
war and that things cannot pos
sibly go on as usual —if we
want to win.
