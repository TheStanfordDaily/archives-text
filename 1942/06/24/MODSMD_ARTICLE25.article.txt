### BILL STEIF 
was the worst day
that the United Nations have
had since the Germans were at the
gates of Moscow eight months ago.
Since then have come Pearl
Harbor, Singapore, Burma, and
the Burma Road, the Philippines,
and the Aleutians. But those
losses are minor, have been coun
terbalanced by Allied victories to
j some extent, compared to the defi
nite possibility that today and the
coming week may witness the fall
; of Suez and Sevastopol.
Sunday night Marshal Rommel
I stormed into Tobruk. Fighting un
der a blazing sun which brought the
temperature up to 120 degrees, his
heavy tanks smashed the outer
perimeter of Tobruk's defenses.
Once through the hard crust of the
outer defenses, the rest apparently
was easy for the Nazi forces.
Since then the German troops
have rolled toward the east without
a stop. The British Bth Army evi
dently is badly hurt—a hurt which
began a week ago when a large
number of British tanks were drawn
into a Nazi ambush and decimated.
So now the Germans move toward
Egypt and drastic action must be
taken to halt the invaders. There
are even rumors that a Nazi para
chute army of 250.000 men is based
on Crete in order to attack Egypt
by air as Rommel sweeps in by
land. It is not a pretty picture.
Meanwhile, up on the Crimea the
Red Army is making a desperate bid
to hold Sevastopol and the Moscow
communiques keep up that last-ditch
tone of cheerfulness which would be
funny if the situation weren't so
ludicrous. The Germans, it seems,
are gradually eating up yard after
yard of Sevastopol and at the same
time are hitting Marshal Simeon
Timoshenko's troops in the Kharkov
sector. This, too, is not a pretty
pictui'e.
Even over here in the western
hemisphere we find the Japs
crawling on a couple of islands
that up to now we considered in
dubitably American. The Navy,
of course, is keeping the whole
thing pretty well hushed up so
that, as a I hirtcenth Naval District
spokesman said in a classic phrase
a few days ago, "If the public is
confused, then so is the enemy."

these little things are what
made yesterday discouraging.
For a while the United Nations are
going to have to ride on that little
item uneouthly but correctly known
as "guts. Tobruk, Sevastopol, the
Aleutianus, are blows which singly
would be tough to take. Together
they indicate that you and I are go
ing to get the test of our lives. It has
been pretty easy in the last couple
of months to gallop along in optimis
tic clouds while wo were scoring a
string of victories.
Now I wonder how you and I
are responding to discouraging
news. I wonder if we ran "take it."
I wonder if the renowned Ameri
can phenomenon, "guts." is really
there. I wonder if the guy I know
who is looking for a soft berth in
the Navy is going to continue his
search. I wonder if you and I are
going to take the WPB warning of
a food shortage seriously. I won
der if the screams that you and I
put up at the hint of gasoline ra
tioning are going to quiet down.
Personally. I have faith in Amer
ican intestinal fortitude. But wars
are not won with myths.

land. It is not a pretty picture.
Meanwhile, up on the Crimea the
Red Army is making a desperate bid
to hold Sevastopol and the Moscow
communiques keep up that last-ditch
tone of cheerfulness which would be
funny if the situation weren't so
ludicrous. The Germans, it seems,
are gradually eating up yard after
yard of Sevastopol and at the same
time are hitting Marshal Simeon
Timoshenko's troops in the Kharkov
sector. This, too, is not a pretty
pictui'e.
Even over here in the western
hemisphere we find the Japs
crawling on a couple of islands

Now I wonder how you and I

I wonder if the renowned Ameri

going to take the WPB warning of

Since then have come Pearl

Sunday night Marshal Rommel
I stormed into Tobruk. Fighting un
der a blazing sun which brought the
temperature up to 120 degrees, his
heavy tanks smashed the outer
perimeter of Tobruk's defenses.
Once through the hard crust of the
outer defenses, the rest apparently
was easy for the Nazi forces.
Since then the German troops
have rolled toward the east without
a stop. The British Bth Army evi
dently is badly hurt—a hurt which
began a week ago when a large
number of British tanks were drawn
into a Nazi ambush and decimated.
So now the Germans move toward
Egypt and drastic action must be
taken to halt the invaders. There
are even rumors that a Nazi para
chute army of 250.000 men is based
on Crete in order to attack Egypt
by air as Rommel sweeps in by
