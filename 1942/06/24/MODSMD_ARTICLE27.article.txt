The Sunday Night Movie Series

According to Nancy Haskins,
chairman of the Summer Quarter

| entertainment on campus.
In addition to a Grade A feature

be shown. Miss Haskins stated that
[ later on in the quarter a serial
j which promises to be fully as excit
ing as "Buck Rogers" will be added
to the program.
