# Fraternity Houses Facing Board and Room Problems
## Two House Managers Call Meeting To Discuss Summer Meal Plans 
### 
Because of the new problem faced by fraternities this summer in re
gard to hoard and lodging practices, two fraternity house managers have
j called a meeting for 7:15 tomorrow night at the Delta Chi house for all
managers plus representatives of all houses that are not open for the

summer.
With seven houses closed for the
summer quarter, an extra load has
been thrown on the fraternities that
are open in regard to furnishing
rooms for the men who are not liv-

ing in private residences or Univer
sity halls. The same conditions
apply to the board situation, for only
seven of the 24 fraternities are oper
ating tables.
In order to keep the fraternities
operating on the same basis as pri
vate homes, which they do during
the other three quarters, it is nec
essary that they do not take on any
aspects of the restaurant or hotel
business, according to Dean of Men
John Bunn. 1
DEAN'S PLAN
"If they do operate like restau
rants or hotels," Dean Bunn told
two house managers yesterday, "they
immediately become liable for state
taxation."
The solution, therefore. Dean Bunn
pointed out, is to have all the mem
bers of each closed house room at
one of the houses that is open and
eat at one of the houses that is op
erating a table. Fraternity men
living or eating off campus do not
count on the membership list of
their fraternity as far as this problem
is concerned.
FIRST WEEK DIFFICULTY
The difficulty faced by the ma
jority of the house managers during
this first week, according to Dick
Barger, Sigma Chi manager, has
been getting the men from closed
fraternities or houses not operating
tables to act as a group rather than
individually.
When the members of any particu
lar fraternity scatter up and down
the Row, living and eating at various
other houses, those houses ai~e be
coming restaurants and hrttels, Dean
Bunn said, adding:
"And that is dangerous for the
S fraternities themselves."

When the members of any particu
lar fraternity scatter up and down
the Row, living and eating at various
other houses, those houses ai~e be
coming restaurants and hrttels, Dean
Bunn said, adding:
"And that is dangerous for the
S fraternities themselves."
Because of the new problem faced by fraternities this summer in re
gard to hoard and lodging practices, two fraternity house managers have
j called a meeting for 7:15 tomorrow night at the Delta Chi house for all
managers plus representatives of all houses that are not open for the

summer.
With seven houses closed for the
summer quarter, an extra load has
been thrown on the fraternities that
are open in regard to furnishing
rooms for the men who are not liv-

ing in private residences or Univer
sity halls. The same conditions
apply to the board situation, for only
seven of the 24 fraternities are oper
ating tables.
In order to keep the fraternities
operating on the same basis as pri
vate homes, which they do during
the other three quarters, it is nec
essary that they do not take on any
aspects of the restaurant or hotel
business, according to Dean of Men
John Bunn. 1
DEAN'S PLAN
"If they do operate like restau
rants or hotels," Dean Bunn told
two house managers yesterday, "they
immediately become liable for state
taxation."
The solution, therefore. Dean Bunn
pointed out, is to have all the mem
bers of each closed house room at
one of the houses that is open and
eat at one of the houses that is op
erating a table. Fraternity men
living or eating off campus do not
count on the membership list of
their fraternity as far as this problem
is concerned.
FIRST WEEK DIFFICULTY
The difficulty faced by the ma
jority of the house managers during
this first week, according to Dick
Barger, Sigma Chi manager, has
been getting the men from closed
fraternities or houses not operating
tables to act as a group rather than
individually.
