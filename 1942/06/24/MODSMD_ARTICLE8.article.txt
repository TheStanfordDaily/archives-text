# Bennett Lauds Hawaii in War
## Series Speaker Tells Of December 7 Blitz 
### BILL DILLINGER 
Hawaii's food supply is more than
adequate, and the policing of the
island, both military and civil, is
thorough, according to Dr. Merrill K.
Bennett, member of an emergency
food-control board set up in the
islands after December 7, speaking
last night on the first Tuesday Series
! program of Summer Quarter.
Admitting that the food situation
j was "difficult" the first month or so
I after Pearl Harbor, Bennett stated
j that the islands now have a six
months' stock pile, and that the
fortress island of Oahu was, if any
thing, overstocked. Bennett praised
the prompt action of Congress in
voting money to the Surplus Com
, modities Board to supply Hawaii.
MILITARY LAW
The islands have been under mili
tary law since the first few weeks of
the war and Hawaii's government,
under the army's control, has been
; rigid and somewhat arbitrary, but
nevertheless thoroughly humane, the
i speaker believes. Hawaiian public
j opinion, he feels, is that martial
I rule, though strict, is probably the
' best possible under the circum-
I stances.
Hawaii is blacked out every night
from dusk to dawn, with a curfew
two hours after dark —about 10:15 in
! the summer —for all adults. The
streets are patrolled by regular and
military police and by volunteer
workers, so that gatherings of people
i after dark are almost impossible
j without discovery by the ever-alert
I patrol,
FALSE RUMORS
Dr. Bennett, whose home is with
| in 8 miles of Pearl Harbor, saw very
little of the bombing, although a
I Jap plane flew over his house and a
I couple of anti-aircraft shells fell
| nearby.
Dr. Bennett stressed the number
I of false rumors that were being cir
culated immediately after the blitz,
citing the stories of poisoned water
supplies, invasion attempts, and off
shore naval battles that latter proved
unfounded. The official reports on
the attack should be accepted on
face, according to Dr. Bennett, who
i stressed their ix?liability above the
| tales of so-called "eye-witnesses."

island, both military and civil, is
thorough, according to Dr. Merrill K.
Bennett, member of an emergency
food-control board set up in the
islands after December 7, speaking
last night on the first Tuesday Series
! program of Summer Quarter.
Admitting that the food situation
j was "difficult" the first month or so
I after Pearl Harbor, Bennett stated
j that the islands now have a six
months' stock pile, and that the
fortress island of Oahu was, if any
thing, overstocked. Bennett praised
the prompt action of Congress in
voting money to the Surplus Com
, modities Board to supply Hawaii.
MILITARY LAW
The islands have been under mili
tary law since the first few weeks of
the war and Hawaii's government,
under the army's control, has been
; rigid and somewhat arbitrary, but
nevertheless thoroughly humane, the
i speaker believes. Hawaiian public
j opinion, he feels, is that martial
I rule, though strict, is probably the
' best possible under the circum-
I stances.
Hawaii is blacked out every night
from dusk to dawn, with a curfew
two hours after dark —about 10:15 in
! the summer —for all adults. The
streets are patrolled by regular and
military police and by volunteer
workers, so that gatherings of people
i after dark are almost impossible
j without discovery by the ever-alert
I patrol,
FALSE RUMORS
Dr. Bennett, whose home is with
| in 8 miles of Pearl Harbor, saw very
little of the bombing, although a
I Jap plane flew over his house and a
I couple of anti-aircraft shells fell
| nearby.
Dr. Bennett stressed the number
I of false rumors that were being cir
culated immediately after the blitz,
citing the stories of poisoned water
supplies, invasion attempts, and off
shore naval battles that latter proved
unfounded. The official reports on
the attack should be accepted on
face, according to Dr. Bennett, who
i stressed their ix?liability above the
| tales of so-called "eye-witnesses."
Hawaii's food supply is more than
adequate, and the policing of the
island, both military and civil, is
thorough, according to Dr. Merrill K.
