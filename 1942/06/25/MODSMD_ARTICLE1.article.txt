# Row Men Meet Today to Plan Summer Living
## Fraternity Heads And House Managers To Discuss Problems 
### BOB HANNAH 
A meeting of all fraternity presi
dents and house managers at 7:15
tonight at the Delta Chi House has
been called by Acting Intel-fraternity
President Dick Reel.
The meeting will discuss four ma
jor problems that fraternities face
this summer. They are rushing,
Civilian Defense precautions, pledges
living in houses, and board practices.
Two house managers had pre
viously called a meeting of man
agers at the Delta Chi house tonight
to discuss board practices, but, ac
cording to Reel, "this is a good time
to thresh out the other three prob
lems."
SEND DELEGATES
All houses are urged to send both
their managers and presidents,
whether these managers and presi
dents are temporary or not. If there
are no house officers attending Stan
ford Summer Quarter, members
should delegate a responsible person
to attend the meeting.
The most pressing problem faced
by the fraternities is that of board.
Only seven of the 14 houses open

are serving meals this summer. Or
dinarily the houses are classified as
private homes, since all persons
eating there are members. However,
when members of other houses eat at
a fraternity, it assumes the status of
a restaurant, unless all the members
of the fraternity who are eating on
the row agree to eat at one house.
ACT TOGETHER
The chief difficulty that fraterni
ties have faced, according to Dick
Barger, Sigma Chi manager, is to
get their members to act as a group
rather than individually in eating at
other fraternity houses. It is ex
pected that this difficulty will be
overcome once students are settled
in the normal routine of school life.
