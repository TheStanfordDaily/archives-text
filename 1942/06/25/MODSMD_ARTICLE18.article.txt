# Four Named For Research On Vitamins
## 
### 
To carry on research work in vita
mins and nutrition, four research
fellows in biology have been ap
pointed by Stanford University un
der a grant of $(>.OOO made in April
by the Nutrition Foundation, Inc.
BREAD MOLDS
The biology fellows will work un
der Dr. George W. Beadle, professor
of biology and genetics, and Dr.
Edward L. Tatum, assistant professor
of biology, who have been develop
ing a method of studying vitamins
through the growth of special bread
molds.
Those appointed include: Adrian
M. Sib of the University of Nebras
ka; John G. Pierce, a biochemist
with an A.B. degree from Stanford;
August H. Doerman of Wabash and
the University of Illinois; and David
C. Regnery, a Stanford graduate who
has taken additional graduate work
at the California Institute of Tech
nology in Pasadena.
VITAMIN ANALYSIS
The research fellows will further
develop and apply the vitamin analy
sis method of Drs. Beadle and Ta
tum for measuring the amounts of
vitamins in various natural prod
ucts. such as fruits, vegetables, and
other foods. It will be a means of
combining scientific with practical
research in warfare.
Stanford's chemistry department
is co-operating with the study, and
Mr. Pierce will work with Dr. H. S.
Loring, assistant professor of bio
chemistry, on certain phases of the
research.
