# Toward Better Organization

TV LL reports point toward a
A. successful national rubber
salvage drive, but there are a
lev/ matters which should be
clarified.
1. Remember the huge alu
minum drive which swept the
nation several months ago? And
remember what happened to
the material collected? It sat in
junk yards and local depositor
ies for months without being
turned in to the national head
quarters. It seems that the en
tire organization of the idea was
never properly formulated, re
sulting in a pretty badly mud
dled affair.
2. The California State Auto
mobile Association and other
jroups are advocating the tear
ng out of rubber mats from au
"omobile floor-boards for sal
vage purposes. According to the
Association, approximately 100,-
300 tons would be added to the
scrap collection pile. That is
'ine, but will motorists want to
'ake the risk of depreciating the
:'alue of their cars when they
not sure that the rubber do
nated will be used?
We do not mean to intimate
hat this rubber drive is as bad
'y organized as the aluminum
7ather'ng field days, but we do
want to know if the materials
which are being turned in are
handled properly.
At Tuesday night's Excom
meeting, to bring the matter still
closer to the campus, it was sug
gested that Lagunita or some
other group sponsor a scaven
ger hunt for rubber materials.
The proposal was shelved for a
week because of conflicting
dates, which means the plan
cannot possibly be carried out
until after the Fourth of luly.
The President's rubber sal
vage drive will have closed by
'hen, but it does not necessarily
'ollow that the United States will
.not need rubber at that time.
The proposal would be a date
affair, and undoubtedly would
be on-campus. If the plan goes
through, which should be the
case, two excellent points will
be achieved:
1. Students will be able to
contribute a small, but neces
sary, part to the President's pro
gram; and 2. We will be able to
have a lot of fun right here on
the campus saving money and
tires.
This is a move in the right di
rection and should be followed
by other on-campus affairs for
the entire student bodv.
