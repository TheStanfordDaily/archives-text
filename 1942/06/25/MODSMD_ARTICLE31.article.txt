## AFTER SADDLE SHOES WHAT? 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
r BIG SCRAP rubber drive,
quite apart from its value to the
nation in a material sense, will per
haps rank along with the market
crash of '29 and repeal as marking
the end of another college "era."
Just as raccoon coats and cocktail
shakers were symbols of the tu
multous twenties, when enrollment
in college was a legalized way to
shake down parents and a means of
entre into the best bootleggers, so
saddle shoes marked the now-ended
"ivory tower" era remembered for
its blind isolationism and the social
acceptance of the idea that you need
not be a dough-heavy to be a good
guy.
Because of the rubber shortage no
saddle shoes have been made in two
months; because of the scrap drive
thousands of pairs will find their
way to the war effort. Before long,
saddle shoes, the symbol of a dead
era, will have disappeared from the
college scene.
Perhaps it is well. After all,
saddle shoes went in droves to big
games and super rallies when it
was only important to do or die
for Sextant State; they went along
to picnics in the hills and at
beaches; they pushed heavily on
throttles up and down the high
way when r.p.in.'s were more im
portant than a tire's life.
Saddle shoes belong to that dead
period when so often colleges held
the education of their students and
service to their country less im
portant than getting more books in
their libraries, more classrooms in
their halls, more professors in their
classrooms, and bigger stadiums on
their front lawns.
Colleges now are temporarily
limited to being subsidiaries of arm
ament works and purveyors of V-7
culture. However, with victory they
will blossom in a new guise as dif
ferent from the last as the bar
weaned thirties were from the gin
drenched twenties.

acceptance of the idea that you need
not be a dough-heavy to be a good
guy.
Because of the rubber shortage no
saddle shoes have been made in two
months; because of the scrap drive
thousands of pairs will find their
way to the war effort. Before long,
saddle shoes, the symbol of a dead
era, will have disappeared from the
college scene.
Perhaps it is well. After all,
saddle shoes went in droves to big
games and super rallies when it
was only important to do or die
for Sextant State; they went along
to picnics in the hills and at
beaches; they pushed heavily on
throttles up and down the high
way when r.p.in.'s were more im
portant than a tire's life.
Saddle shoes belong to that dead
period when so often colleges held
the education of their students and
service to their country less im
portant than getting more books in
their libraries, more classrooms in
their halls, more professors in their
classrooms, and bigger stadiums on
their front lawns.
Colleges now are temporarily
limited to being subsidiaries of arm
ament works and purveyors of V-7
culture. However, with victory they
will blossom in a new guise as dif
ferent from the last as the bar
weaned thirties were from the gin
drenched twenties.
