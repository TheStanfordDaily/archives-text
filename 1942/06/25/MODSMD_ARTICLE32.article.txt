# YOU TOO SHALL BE PHYSICALLY FIT

'"pHERE WAS once a time when, if
you went out for athletics, it
meant you were here on a scholar
ship. Now it means that you are be
ing groomed to be either a hostess,
or a victim, of the U.S.O.
In the matter of health the ad
ministration has changed, almost
over night, from a negative to a posi
tive approach. Time was when the
guardians of our fate and the mas
ters of our souls contented them
selves with merely limiting our par
ticipation in the vices.
Then we smoked less because it
just wasn't the thing to light up a
gasper on the Quad, in class, or the
library; drank less because of cer
tain campus restrictions concerning
the consumption of intoxicating
beverages: spent less time with
girls because of 12 and late
leaves.
Now, with compulsory physical
education to cope with, one doesn't
smoke for fear of a heart attack dur
ing the 25-lap warm-up for Mr.
Shipkey's advanced swimming, or
coining out of a little "bodily con
tact" second best. One doesn't drink
because it is all one can do to reach
home before collapsing, without at
tempting to get down the highway.
One doesn't take out Stanford
girls because what with the girls
strengthened from their P.E. and the
boys weakened from theirs, it is not
only no fun. but is often dangerous
too.
