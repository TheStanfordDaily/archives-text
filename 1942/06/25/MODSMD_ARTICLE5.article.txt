be held only for two weeks with two
meetings scheduled for each week.
The first meeting will be held Mon
day afternoon at 5 in Room 8 of the
Press Building. John Horrall. Daily

Thursday afternoon at the same time
in the same place. Don Selby, Daily
managing editor, will address the
tryoutees on coverage of the campus ;

week has not been completed as yet,
but will be announced at a further
date. Upon completion of this two
week period the Daily editorial board
will announce the various appoint
ments to the staff. Positions for
which the aspiring tryoutees will
work are those of cub reporter, re
porter and copy reader.
