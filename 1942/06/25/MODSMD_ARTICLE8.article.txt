### 
Another 1,000 pounds of scrap
rubber has been turned in to the
campus service station in the past
few days. The total amount of scrap
rubber contributed by Stanford to
the President's drive has reached
approximately 3,800 pounds.
The scrap rubber committee
urges everyone on campus to search
thoroughly for all scrap rubber. Old
tennis shoes, rubber hose, old tires,
inner tubes, tennis balls and hun
dreds of other such items will be
bought for one cent a pound at either
the campus gasoline station or the
corporation yard.
Fifty per cent of the nation's
rubber supply for this year will have
to be filled by scrap rubber collec
tions. According to Charles Mc-
Brian, head of Stanford's scrap rub
ber committee, the amount collected
at Stanford thus far compares fa
vorably with the amounts collected
in other communities; but, says Mc-
Brian, "everyone will have to turn
in a great deal more to fill the na
tion's need."
