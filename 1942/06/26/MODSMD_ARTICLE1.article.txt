# Connie Bennett To Disappear At Auditorium
## Sequel to 'Topper' To Be First Movie Of Bi-Weekly Series 
### 
Can you disappear when you pull
up a zipper? Can you disappear?
Well, Constance Bennett can and
does in "Topper Takes a Trip,"
which will be screened at the Edu
cation Auditorium on Sunday at
7:15.
Hal Roach's sequel to the popular
"Topper" will be the first offering
of Nancy Haskin's bi-weekly Sum
mer Movie Series. The series has
been moved from Memorial Hall to
the Education Auditorium for the
summer. Admission remains 20
cents.
Thorne Smith fans will enjoy this
movie version of another part of his
famous book, "Topper." In it, Con
stance Bennett plays the part of a
ghost. But she is a very unsual
ghost, having the ability to material
ize at will. Those who saw "Topper"
will remember that she and her hus
band were killed when their high
powered car smashed into a tree. But
because they had never been bad
nor good, they were unable to go to
heaven or elsewhere.
Being "low-plan" ghosts, they
were able to be visible or invisible
at any time. This can have its dis
turbing elements as Topper (Roland
Young) found out in the first pic
ture and continues to discover in the
second.
Few people who saw "Topper"
will forget the scene in which an au
tomobile apparently changed its own
tire. More memorable scenes of this
type are promised in Sunday's show
ing,
