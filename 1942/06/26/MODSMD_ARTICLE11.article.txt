# Columbia Films Stanford Life
## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
The Farm was invaded yesterday—
invaded by a six-man camera crew
i from Columbia Pictures, on location
to film the atmospheric background
for Frankie Albert's first starring
role, "Spirit of Stanford."
The crew consisted of Camera Di
rector Don Starling, first cameraman,
second cameraman, assistant cam
eraman, electrician, and grip (not an
article of leather baggage). Dan
Murphy, the grip, was the victim of
a stray draft, netting him a severe
cold for which he is taking the
usual treatment at a local highway
hospital.
A typical college-football epic,
supposedly laid at Stanford, the saga
unreels the story of a football star
i and his overinflated ego. In the
j course of the drama the ego is sub
| dued, and Albert gets the girl, bud
j ding Columbia starlet Margaret
j Chapman. •
All the famous buildings of Stan
ford will figure in the picture, as
well as a panoramic montage of the
famous Stanford footballers of his
tory—Ernie Nevers, Bobby Grayson,
Bill Corbus, et al. Albert, now at
I Annapolis for the Navy's physical
training program, completed the
j dramatic episodes of the film several
| weeks ago.
Students interested in observing
the strange rituals practiced by Hol
lywood cameramen can see them in
action near the Quad and Ad Build
ing today. They are distinguishable
from students by the fact that they
do not wear green cords, red shoes,
purple shirts, and egg-salad sports
coats.
