# Eight Houses Will Feed Row
## 
### DON SELBY 
Acting to straighten out the con
fused situation in regard to eating
at fraternity houses, 26 house presi
dents and managers, meeting at the
Delta Chi house last night, traded
men around like calves and came out
with a definite list—effective July t
—as to what houses are combining
for hoard.
EIGHT HAVE TABLES
A survey revealed that the eight
fraternities operating tables were
fairly well organized as far as hav
ing other houses eating with them in
groups was concerned. However, a
number of fraternity men were free
lancing, with the result that some
members of a fraternity were eating
at one house while other members
of the same fraternity were eating at
another house.
After going through the list of
boarders at each of the houses
where tables are being operated, thai
presidents and managers determined!
just what groups were broken up
and made arrangements, to alter the
situation.
GROUSP LISTED
Counting as a fraternity eating
group only those members of a fra
ternity who are eating on the Row,
the house representatives decided on
the following combinations:
Alpha Delt table—Delt:
Alpha Sig table—Tlieta Chi:
Beta table—Kappa Sig and Kap
pa Alpha;
Chi Psi table—S.A.E.:
Delta Chi table—A.T.O., Phi
Kap. Phi Sig. and Theta Delt;
Fiji table—Theta Xi and Phi Psi;
Sigma Chi table — Deke, Zetc,
and D.U.;
Sigma Nu table—No other house
at present.
The house representatives made
but one decision in regard to living,
declaring that all Kappa Sigs living
in fraternity houses should reside at
the Kappa Alpha house.
The meeting was called to prevent
the fraternities operating tables to
become liable for restaurant tax be
cause of restaurant-like operation
by taking in as boarders members
of any fraternity.
