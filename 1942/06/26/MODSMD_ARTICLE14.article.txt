# War Stamps to Share Space With 'Dimes' Campaign Boxes
## 
### 
Jim Mcßrier, in opening an intensified Dimes for Diplomas campaign,
yesterday revealed a tentative new "twist" to the drive. Utilizing
stamp booths, boxes may be placed alongside and students may volun
tarily donate their war stamps to the Dimes for Diplomas fund.
According to Mcßrier, the Dimes for Diplomas scheme has been set up

to finance students who have been
compelled to drop Stanford for the
armed services and who lack the
finances to continue their studies
after the war. The drive has been
designed to pay one quarter's ex
penses for 50 such students.
Next dimes collection will be made
Monday evening during the dinner
hour.
