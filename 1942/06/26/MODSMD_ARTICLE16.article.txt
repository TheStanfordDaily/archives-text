Alfred Frankenstein, music editor
of the San Francisco Chronicle and
lecturer in music at Stanford this
summer quarter, has begun his
course on "Music Today." In this
course, which is given every Tuesday
afternoon, Mr. Frankenstein will
discuss the outstanding works of
modern composers—from Jan Sibel
ius to Douglas Moore.
