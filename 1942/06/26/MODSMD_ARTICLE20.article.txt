## 
### 
Wartime exigencies have brought
agriculture into increased promi
nence and in view of rising price
tendencies, drastic reversals in agri
cultural policies lie in the future,
was the opinion of Dr. Holbrook
Working in an address to the West
ern Farm Economics Association
yesterday.
Dr. Working set three agricultural
policies as vital to a production pro
gram:
1. Elimination of political pressure
for immediate economic gains in ag
riculture;
2. All-out co-operation on the
part of agriculture for the best pro
duction program feasible;
3. Acceptance of necessary hard
ship and sacrifice.
In qualifying his first point, Dr.
Working contended that "current
demands for food and numerous in
dustrial materials derived from ag
riculture, obliviate the need of spe
cial assistance to the farmer."
Professor Working predicted many
future decisions of price controls,
priorities, compulsory saving and
tax legislation to affect agriculture.
"The emphasis," he declared, "will
be to restrain price advances, and
there will be an entirely new atti
tude on personal incomes and in
dividual sharing of the federal
burden."
He added that agriculture will be
more directly affected than labor by
the public resentment of price in
creases. .
The Western Farm Economics
Association will conclude its three
day convention today at noon.
