### 
Several managers for the Summer
Intramural League met yesterday
with Director Harry Shipkey and
formulated rules for the summer
softball program.
It is hoped to have two leagues,
one for graduates and one for under
graduates. Last year there was but
one league, for only ten teams
signed up.
The tentative list of teams includes
the Slave Drivers, Alpha Delts, Delta
Chi, Phi Gamma Deltas, Second-year
Med School, First-year Med School,
School of Education, Business
School, El Campo, Spar Ducks, So
cialists. The Stanford Daily, Chi Psi.
Beta, Zete, Toyon, and three Encina
teams.
Teams must have a minimum of
ten players, and each member must
pay a 50-cent fee to cover the ex
penses of the league.
