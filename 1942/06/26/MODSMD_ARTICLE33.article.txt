â€¢CONGRATULATIONS are in
' border for Nancy Schermer
horn, chairman of the Stanford
War Stamp Drive. Wednesday
night's $805 was sensational
considering the small time avail
able to Nancy and to her com-
Tiittee for organization of the
vork. Although the $900 goal
was not reached, next week's
goal of $1000 is not an impossi
bility. It is such committee
heads as Nancy and Bob Col
ins who are doing a real serv
ice to the school without any
ambition for personal glory.
