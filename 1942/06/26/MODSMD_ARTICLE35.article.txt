# History ...1942

### BILL STEIF 
'JpHIS would be a pretty good day
to stick my head in the sand,
ostrich-fashion, forget about Egypt,
the Aleutians, and the Crimea, and
discuss something comparatively
unimportant like "who are the Re
publicans (if there are any left out
side of Stanford) going to put up
for President in 1944?" But Buzzy
and Squid, a pair of Shetland
Islanders I met in Budser, say that
this is no time for anything like
that.
In fact, they say that this is the
time to face the reality that two
of our allies are taking sound
whippings for the moment. Which
seems to he true.
Rommel has driven into Egypt for
70 road miles. From all that can be
gathered at this moment Sidi Barani
has fallen. Along with it have gone
Solium, Halfaya, Sidi Omar, Fort
Capuzzo, and several other oases.
By the time Buzzy and Squid read
this the Nazi Marshal will probably
have pulled beyond Zawyet Sham
mas, another hot and comparatively
unimportant oasis near the Mediter
ranean.
This leaves the Nazis from 40 to 70
miles from Marsa Matruh. Marsa
Matruh is 140 miles from the Libyan
border and approximately 300 miles
from the Suez canal. It is at this
town that the British are preparing
their big defense. The town is the
hinge upon which swings the British
line and it is along this line that the
most important battle of the Egyp
tian campaign probably will develop.
* #
r jj I IIE British admit that Marsa
Matruh is one of the best de
fensive points along the whole
southern coast of the Mediterranean.
Rommel is stretching his supply lines
dangerously, but if he were to crack
Marsa Matruh the prize would un
doubtedly be worth the risk he is
taking. He has flanked the British
time after time to obtain his present
positions, but with a strong English
line reaching south from Marsa
Matruh this tactic probably will not
work. But the British are still in a
ticklish spot.
Meanwhile, the northern pincer of
Hitler's drive to the East is grad
ually forcing the Russians back in
the Kharkov sector and at Sevasto
pol. Here it seems mostly to be a
question of mass against mass, with
the Germans temporarily exerting
the most pressure. If that pressure
effects a break through the Russian
line the result might be disastrous,
but right now it looks as if the
Reds are tough-fibered enough to
hold.
There is still no news from
American sources about the Jap
landings on the Aleutians, though
the Nipponese and the Germans
have both broadcast news to the
effect that the Japs have put a
firm toe-hold upon a number of
the tiny islands off Alaska. The
Axis reports are not very trust
worthy these days, hut it does
seem slightly ominous that our
Navy has said absolutely nothing
in the last few days about what is
going on up there.
So there it is, Squid and Buzzy. It
isn't pretty and it isn't particularly
optimistic. It's just another sign
that we're not going to have it so
easy for a while and that we can't
underestimate the guys on the other
side of the barbed wire. And it's
another sign that we must and will
carry the hod for some time to come.
