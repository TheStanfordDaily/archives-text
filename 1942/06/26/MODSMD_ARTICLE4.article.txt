# Hoover Helps Rubber Drive
## 
### 
Herbert Hoover donated 200
pounds of scrap rubber to the cam
pus collections to help swell yester
day's total to 1,500 pounds. Yester
day's total was the greatest for any
single day since the rubber drive got
under way at Stanford.
Four truck loads of scrap rubber
were sent out from the campus to
collection centers late in the after
noon. The drive total so far amounts
to about 5,000 pounds.
Charles Mcßrian, who heads the
scrap rubber drive, commented on
yesterday's collections by saying, "In
spite of yesterday's fine showing, we
are still far from the realization of
our goal which has been set at
20,000 pounds. Yet, it is probable
that a much greater quantity is
presently collectable. In addition to
unused scrap, old rubber means that
rubber which serves as a luxury or
nonessential purpose when it could
aid in war production.
"Students and campus residents
are not being asked to donate nec
essaries which contain rubber and no
requests are made for such items as
usable floor mats, rubber shoes, etc.,
unless a satisfactory substitute can
be used," said Mcßrian.
Mcßrian pointed out that hard
rubber is reclaimable. Such articles
as gear shift knobs, combs, etc., if
rubber, are acceptable.
