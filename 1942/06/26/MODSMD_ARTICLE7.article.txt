# Fraternities Remedy Eating Problem; Summer Quarter Rush Rules Clarified
## Junior Pledging To Be Allowed 
### BOB HANNAH 
The problem of summer rushing
was settled last night by presidents
and managers of Stanford fraterni
ties at a meeting at the Delta Chi
house.
Acting Interfraternity President
Dick Reel, making reference to the
Interfraternity Rushing Regulations,
said they should apply and that "this
summer should be treated as a regu
lar Autumn Quarter except that
there shall be no rushing periods."
The meeting concurred with Reel,
after which he added that this meas
ure will serve to protect those
houses that are not operating this
summer.
JUNIORS NOT AFFECTED
However, the stipulation was made
that this action in no way affects
junior transfers who may be rushed,
may pledge, and may move into a
fraternity at any time.
To aid fraternities in their rushing
it was decided to mimeograph and
distribute to the various house a
list of all junior transfers eligible
for pledging.
The meeting was unable to dis
cuss fully the matter of Civilian De
fense, because of the absence of
Bob Greening, student member of
the Civilian Defense Council. But
Reel, speaking for Greening, said that
it would be necessary for houses to
appoint air raid wardens.
ADULT SUPERVISION
The University ruling on adult
supervision was also discussed and
clarified. Under this ruling, all
houses that are open but are not op
erating tables are required to have
one adult live in the house who is
okeyed by the dean of men.
Acting president for Summer
Quarter is Dick Reel, and acting sec
retary-treasurer is Don Dillon.
The Interfraternity offices will
tentatively be open on week days
from 10 to 11 a.m.
