# Fire Chief, Fox Terrier End Careers
## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
The scream of the Stanford Fire
house alarm bell will no longer jolt
Chief Robert E. Dugan out of the
comfort of his well-worn, oaken
swivel chair. It will no longer dis
turb him because Fire Marshal
Dugan's retirement became effective
last Saturday. He will be replaced
by his former assistant, Arden L.
Hatley.
Retiring along with Mr. Dugan
will be his fox terrier, Prince, Fire
house mascot, and Mr. Dugan's con
stant companion on every fire-call
he has answered during 19 years of
University service.
Gathering together his paper skel
eton, carved cocoanut head, and a
real skull, Mr. Dugan paused long
enough to separate personal keys
from official onesâ€”found only one,
"the key to the back door."
'"Don't you go in the front door?"
Arden Hatley asked.
'"No." Mr. Dugan replied with a
wry grin. ' My wife won't let me."
Evidently this dry humor has
stood him in good stead during 19
years of false alarms, early morning
awakenings, grass fires, and inquisi
tive Daily reporters, for when asked
for a comment on his retirement he
laughed loudly and said. "The quieter
I go T>ut the better I'll like it."
