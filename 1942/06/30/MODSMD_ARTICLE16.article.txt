# Girls at Gas Station Find Man's Job 'Cinch'
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
This isn't the man's world it used to be.
Driving into Associated Station No. 503 across from the stadium, we
were besieged by three comely "minute women." A Hurry of feminine
delicacy and efficiency, and our car was spotless, the tank full, battery
checked, and popcorn crumbs whisked from the floorboard.

A light breeze was blowing, and a
line strung with beach sandals, bath
ing caps, aprons and a rubber doll
gave us clue that female dexterity
had invaded the realm of national
salvage.
Then a girl trotted back with the
change. "This man's job is a cinch,"
expounded vacationing Stanfordite
Ruth Wilson. "We just bring in the
feminine touch and ears leave here
immaculate with the customers
grinning with satisfaction."
GIRLS RUN STATION
Three girls are running the sta
tion. Ruth is a Stanford pre-med
major, Madeline West was a car hop
at a southern drive-in, and Eureath
Horning was a sportsman pilot with
14 hours when civilian restrictions
were levied.
These denim-clad women are sift
ing into jobs throughout the country
—jobs vacated by men now shoul
dering Garands or pounding rivets
into a Lockheed tail assembly. As
Madeline predicted, "women are
adapting themselves so well to new
jobs that they're likely to be re
tained when this mess is over."
Madeline pointed to a new Buick
pulling up to the gas pumps.
"Eureath is going to get this one—
watch." We did, for several minutes,
as Eureath feverishly hunted for the
gas tank cap. Madeline chuckled.
"This is a tough one, but she'll get
it, it's a game with us."
TOUGH JOB
Sure enough, Eureath pressed the
tail light and to her amazemeht, it
lifted and revealed a chrome cap.
"That's the toughest part of the job,"
said Madeline, "finding the gas cap
or hood release."
There's another member of No.
503, Oliver Lekola. Oliver is there to
do the heavy work—lube jobs, flat
repairing, et al. He finds himself
somewhat of an outcast and retires
himself largely to the rear garage.
His status of an "outcast" was es
tablished when the women came to
work. At that time, Oliver got only
dirty looks from male customers
which transformed to smiles as one
of the girls took over. Therefore, to
day he has resigned himself to a
suboi'dinate position.
The girls know their business
diplomacy. As we pulled away they
chorused that Stanford students,
who comprise 50 per cent of their
business, are "awfullv nice."

The British Empire, before the
war, covered about one-fourth of
the world's habitable surface.

North Carolina leads all states in
native-born population, with 99.6
per cent.
