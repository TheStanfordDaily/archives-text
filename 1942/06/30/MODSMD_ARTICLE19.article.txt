collegiate athletic championships. leaving the ether two to Southern Cali
fornia and Ohio State.
In the school's most successful year, athletically speaking, since its
founding 50 years age, its basketball, golf, and tennis squads withstood

the competition of the best of the'
nation's college teams and came out
victorious.
Only in the track and swimming
championship meets did teams not
representing the Farm win. South
ern California's perennially strong
spike squad took the N.C.A.A. track
and field meet at Lincoln, Neb.,
two weeks ago, while a well balanced
Ohio State team won the N.C.A.A.
swim title.
TATUM BREAKS STREAK
Not only did the Card golf team
win the aggregate medal scoring for
the fourth time in five years, but
Frank "Sandy" Tatum broke a long
standing Stanford jinx by winning
the individual match play crown
over the Chain-o-lakes course at
South Bend, Ind.
In three previous years, Indian
teemen have reached the finals but
were defeated. Tatum, senior Phi
Bete, accomplished what Art Doer
ing. Warren Berl, and Bud Brown
ell failed to do. Coach Eddie Twiggs'
men established another record along
the way—that of qualifying the un
heard-of total of six men in the
match play.
Not only did Stanford win both
singles and doubles at the intercol
legiate tennis championships at New
Orleans last week, but both finals
were all-Stanford matches, and
three of the four singles semifinals
were from Stanford.
SCHROEDER DOES IT
Ted Schroeder, America's premier
amateur netter, had little difficulty
in subduing teammate, doubles part
ner Larry Dee, in the singles final.
These two combined to down mates
Neale and Wade in the doubles.
In Kansas City in March, with two
of their five first-stringers incapaci
tated, the Card basketball team
walked through the Dartmouth In
dians in the finals of the N.C.A.A.
hoop tourney.
Individually, Stanford athletes did
just as well. Frankie Albert was
made all-American quarterback for
the second year in a row. with Pete
Kmetovic and Chuck Taylor receiv
ing many honorable mentions.
Don Burn ess, co-captain and for
ward on the cage quintet, was put on
the all-American basketball. Howie
