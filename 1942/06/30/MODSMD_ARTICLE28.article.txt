THE eight Stanford fraterni
ties which are operating
fables this summer have done
a good job of ironing out their
difficulties concerning who
should eat where. There was
much friendly trading of men at
Jhe Interfraternity Council meet
ing held at the Delta Chi house
Thursday. It's too bad that such
good feeling cannot survive
longer than the summer. One of
the main problems of Stanford's
fraternity system has been the
sneaking, "we'll see if we can
get away with it" attitude in re
gard to rushing. Maybe we are
in the midst of a new genera
tion of above-board Row men.
We'll see. come next fall.
