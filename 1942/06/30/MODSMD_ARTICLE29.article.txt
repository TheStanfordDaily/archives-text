## FAREWELL TO RUBBER-NECKS 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
tire shortage has done at
least one thing for better living
here on campus. In the past, dur
ing Summer Quarter, the roads of
the Farm were crowded with rub
ber-necked tourists.
One always felt a little like an oc
cupant of a zoo as each carload of
staring strangers passed, obviously
nudging each other, saying, "Oh
look, that must be a college boy
there."
Then, too, there were the elderly
couples in well kept high priced
cars, often chauffeured, who had
never quite stopped living in the
Coolidge era and would sooner die
than vote democrat.
These people would stop their cars
near you and after rolling down
their window in a way known only to
those who have made their first
$500,000, regally ask the way to
President Hoover's house.
Now there is nothing wrong with
asking the way to Mr. Hoover's
house, but when you had to explain
that you didn't know, the look you
got was enough to shrivel you up.
You could see at once that you
were considered a nefarious cross
between a communist and an anarch
ist. Hastily they would roll up their
window before being contaminated,
and without giving you the oppor
tunity to explain that your father
had voted Republican and that you
could get to Mr. Hoover's house but
just couldn't describe the route.
All that is past now, thank good
ness, and Stanford, because of the
rubber shortage, is once more a pie
serve for the undergraduates and
wild life of California.
