# WOODY HERMAN HAS IT BACKWARDS
## 
### 
JN A RECENT recording Woody
Herman presented to the nation
a number all his own called Ooch
Ooch a Goon Attach which at first
sounds like the recording title to
end recording title. Looking at it
more closely you will notice that it
is merely Chattanooga Choo Choo
in reverse.
In case you are interested, the
lyrics are those of Rose O'Day sung
backwards. The effect is different if
nothing else.
