### 
"IN THIS OUR LIFE," now play
ing at the Stanford in Palo Alto.
"In This Our Life" is unquali
fiedly an excellent production;
though it might not have been with
out its Max Steiner score and Bette
Davis.
Although the picture deals with a
number of ideas it does not quite get
across, it achieves signal success in
the portrayal of Stanley Kimberlake,
a pampered girl addicted to such
pretty pastimes as running away with
her sister's husband and driving him
to suicide. And Bette Davis does a
magnificent job of it. There have
been more outstanding pictures
than usual this year, but this char
acterization is one of the first out
standing individual performances. In
my opinion, the role makes Miss
Davis, already winner of two Acad
emy Awards, number one contender
for the 1942 Oscar.
Anne Shirley does a right charm
ing job in "Unexpected Uncle," an
extraneous, Ladies - Home - Journal
type of light summer romance. And
Charles Colburn does a well-grooved
uncle in both pictures.—Covey
