# $550 Reached In Drive to Aid Stanfordites
## 
### 
Last night's Dimes for Diplomas
receipts nudged the total figure to
$550, as $40.60 was collected. Ac
cording to Jim Mcßrier, Rally Com
mittee head, the figui'e still falls far
short of the $100 per week goal, al
though the drive showed a slight
improvement over last week's $35.
Lagunita's returns last night made
up 50 per cent of the total collection,
whereas the fraternities contributed

only $7. It is anticipated that this
week's income will be augmented
Wednesday, when boxes will adjoin
War Stamp sales booths, and newly
purchased stamps may be voluntarily
contributed to the Dimes for Diplo
mas.
It is planned that the campaign
will finance 50 students to complete
one quarter at Stanford. Men who
have been compelled to leave school
for the armed services and who will
be financially unable to continue
after the war, will be qualified for
Dimes for Diplomas scholarships.
' More than S7OOO is needed," re
marked Mcßrier, "and we're one
fourteenth of the way to the goal
tonight."

War stamps will l>e sold on
campus next Wednesday for the
second time this summer. Wed
nesday's goal is set at $1,000.
Stamp sales reached $805 last
week.
