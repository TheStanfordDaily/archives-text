# ICKES FURTHERS DRIVE
## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Petroleum Co-ordinator Harold L.
Ickes addressed a plea to the nation
today to turn in old rubber. And as
the co-ordinator remarked at the
White House that he thought a lot of
rubber for scrap collection could be
found in public buildings, a reporter
pointed out that a heavy rubber mat
at the entry to the executive office
should be taken for scrap. The sec
retary called the reporter's bluff and
said the rubber would be carted
away to the nearest filling station im
mediately.
Stanford's participation in the
drive has taken on a new turn, ac
cording to the chairman of the drive,
Chuck Mcßrian.
Since the President has advanced
the deadline of the drive ten days to
July 10 at midnight, Mcßrian hopes
that every Stanford student and
campus resident will search through
their old belongings for more scrap
rubber.
The goal has been set at 20,000
pounds. Last Friday the rubber
drive total wass till far from reali
zation as only 5.000 pounds had been
collected.
Mcßrian urges everyone to look
once more for old rubber. Although
5,000 pounds have been collected it
is probable that a much greater
quantity can still be found.
