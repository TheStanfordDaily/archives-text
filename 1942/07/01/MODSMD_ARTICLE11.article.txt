# Draft Reg 18-20 Not for Army, Says Cowdery
## Long Lines of Men Fill Ad Building For Manpower Check-up 
### 
The 18-20 registration yesterday
was merely a check-up on the avail
able manpower between those ages.
There will be no conscription, either
for labor or military service, of the
men in that group, according to the
present plan. This was the verdict
of l)r. Cowdery, who was in charge
of the registration board in the Ad
ministration Building lobby.
Dr. Cowdery further observed that
the new registrants are not being as
signed numbers, which would be
necessary if there were to be some
sort of lottery.
BLANKS HELD BY BOARD
The registration blanks will be
held in reserve by the Palo Alto Se
lective Service Board to be added to
the regular conscription list when,
the registrant becomes 20. Thus the
main purpose of the registration has
been to facilitate entrance of men
into the regular conscription ar
x'angement by having them already;
registered. i
About 405 of an expected 450 or
500 Farm men had registered by
4:30 yesterday afternoon. Although
figures from other registration cen
ters in the vicinity are unavailable,
it is believed that about 600 Summer
Quarter students signed up in the
7 a.m. to 9 p.m. registration period.
MORNING RUSII
Dr. Cowdery's staff of volunteer
workers was busy all day, but stu
dents were forced to wait in line
only during the rush period from
9:30 to 11:30 in the morning, when
between 150 and 200 signed up.
Men who failed to register yester
day must report to the Palo Alto
Board as soon as possible. They are
subject to drastic penalties under the
law, Dr. Cpwdery has stated, adding
that a very good excuse would be
necessary, since even those at the
hospital were registered specially
yesterday.
Signing up with the 18-20 group
were those men who had reached
their 20th birthday since the last
registration. These men will be
numbered and included in the regu
lar selective serice lists, being sub
ject to call when their number
comes up. No figures are available
on this registration.
