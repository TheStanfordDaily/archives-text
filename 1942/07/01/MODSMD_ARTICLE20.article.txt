# Schedule Conflict Hits Grid Sign-up
## 
### 
As yet no teams have signed up
for a Summer Quarter touch foot
ball intramural "league, according to
Intramural Director Harry Wolter,
and a possible conflict of schedules
may result if a league is arranged.
Prior to the introduction of com
pulsory physical education, intra
mural activity could be substituted
for gym attendance, provided gym
classes fell on the same day a per
son was engaged in intramurals.
Also, most gym classes come on
Monday, Wednesday and Friday,
with Softball games scheduled for
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons.
This may cause difficulty in finding a
time satisfactory for football players.
However, any student interested in
having a summer touch football
league should sign up immediately on
the sign-up sheet on the intramural
board in Encina Gym, or get in
touch with Mr. Wolter at the B.A.C.
