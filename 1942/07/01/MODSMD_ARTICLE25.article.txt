So goes Idaho, so goes Montana
Scourges of grad managers' pollyana.
For years and years they've made an inference
To get you out of the Coast Conference.
Sam Barry wants games for his St. Mary's cadets
And the big four are all very good bets.
But Justin Sam wants 'em early in (lie season:
Because of changing personnel is one reason.
There's only one way to do it easily,
That's to cancel games with Vandal and Grizzly.
But Montana and Idaho arc back in the pix:
First time since round robin came in '.'!(»!
Would they give up games with the big four—
Cal. U.C.L.A., S.C.. and Leland Stanford Junior?
Maybe yes and maybe no, maybe they'll just straddle;
Maybe Ackerman, Masters, Priestly, and Eddv will put < n the saddle
Anyway, it's a cinch we will not wait and prattle
At another do-nothing confab in Seattle.
It's tough enough to get out of Missoula, Mont., and Moscow, Ida.
Without from the big four a guarantee bona fide.
Times are tough and transportation holonia;
So maybe Idaho and Montana will have to stay at homia.
This is really justa gestia;
It's really veddv cornia.
