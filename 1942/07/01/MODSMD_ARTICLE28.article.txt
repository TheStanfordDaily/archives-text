# Defense Training
## 
### 
DURING last Spring Quarter
Stanford had an air raid
and disaster drill. After this
drill, offiicals of Stanford's Civil
ian Defense Committee held
post-mortem in the A.S.S.U. of
fices in the Stanford Union.
While they expressed satis
faction with the drill they point
ed out that there was a danger
ous lack of training among the
Civilian Defense student person
nel.
Although eager and willing to
help, most of the students didn't
know what to do when they re
ported at the scene of a simu
lated disaster. There was a piti
ful need for a well trained, well
eguipped student personnel
manning the Civilian Defense
organization-
Yesterday a Civilian Defense
course was announced by the
Civilian Defense Committee for
the instruction of this personnel.
This two-unit course will be
offered by the School of Health
to teach the Civilian Defense
student personnel what it needs
:o know in order to do the job.
Both teachers, Dr. Luckett and
Mr. Coman, went through the
ngid War Department Civilian
Defense School on campus last
quarter.
They will teach the students
now to handle incendiary and
high explosive bombs —how to
distinguish between a magne
sium, a thermite, or an oil
bomb. Gas attack will be dis
cussed and methods of protec
tion against types of gas will be
taught.
In general, the students will
learn about air attack, blackout
methods and precautions, the
Stanford aircraft warning sys
tem in the control center, and
vill receive a thorough knowl
edge of the campus Civilian
Defense organization.
After this training, Stanford
Mil have the type of Civilian
Defense organization every com
munity in the country should
.have—well trained, well equip
ped, ready for the enemy.
The members of the Stanford
Civilian Defense Committee are
to be complimented—they saw
the main fault in the air raid and
disaster drill, and they moved
quickly to correct it. — Charlie
