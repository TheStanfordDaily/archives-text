### BILL STEIF 
r J A WO events of yesterday are of
signal importance.
The first is the fact that the
Nazis are only 80 miles from Al
exandria. The second is the fact
that almost three million Ameri
can youths of 18. 19, and 20 years
registered for the draft. The 18-
and 19-year-olds are not eligible
to be drafted—yet. The 20-year
olds will undoubtedly soon be
going.
In Egypt British defenses have
crumbled mysteriously. The gigantic
battle that was expected at Marsa
Matruh never got a chance to get
started. The United Nations re
treated. Then there was some ex
pectation, a definite belief, in fact,
} that Rommel would have to slow
! down and wage what might have
! been a comparatively pitched battle
| in and around the El Daba line, a
! 45-mile string which extended from
! the uninhabitable Quattara Depres
sion — a great salt marsh —on the
south to the Mediterranean on the
north. Rommel had earlier swept
Allied troops before him in an en
gagement at the Fuka Air Base 40
miles west of El Daba, but it was
thought—well, it makes no differ
ence. Rommel went right through El
Daba and the "line" that was sup
posed to be there.
It is true that Rommel's supply
I lines have been tremendously
j stretched. It is true that General
j Neil Ritchie has finally been booted
i out of command of the British Eighth
Army and that General Claude
Auchinleck has taken over what is
i left of that army. But it is also true
! that Rommel has made the toughest
part of his drive already. He does
, not have to worry now about getting
i shoved into a salt marsh. He is com
| ing into more fertile, better watered,
and more habitable land. The roads
and railroads are better from here
on for him. He now can attempt to
| take Alexandria by the coastal
I route—a bare 80 miles—or can stab
! southeastward toward Cairo—a drag
of about 140 miles.
Alexandria, it would seem, is the
! city which he will try to take, lie
has less than 80 miles to go. He
can follow the excellent coastal
road along the Mediterranean. Al
exandria. at the mouth of the Nile,
and thus controlling Cairo, pos
sessing a fine harbor and magnifi
cent dock facilities, one of Brit
ain's two or three key Mediter
ranean ports, and doubtlessly hold
ing many commodities which the
Nazis would love to get their claws
upon, would represent the great
est Nazi victory since the fall of
France.

it may seem, sounds pessi
mistic. It isn't. It is merely
: factual. The plain fact, in my opin
ion, is that the British army has fall
en apart in Egypt. Even Allied air
superiority cannot seem to do any
: thing against a tragic lack of anti
tank guns and tanks and the appar
ently antiquated generalship of the
British. We are taking a walloping
in Egypt which may throttle the
Suez and open the pathway to India
j for Hitler.
Meanwhile, thousands of miles
from Egypt, a lot more Americans
signed little white cards which will
eventually land most of the signees
into the army, navy, or marines.
This is important because it gives
Uncle Sam a reservoir of around
three million good young Ameri
cans which, if necessary, can be
thrown into any breech.
There has been some talk, in fact.
: at Washington about drafting 18- and
j 19-year-olds, but any legislation to
this effect apparently is being drawn
| up quietly or not being drawn up at
all. About the only sure thing is
I that if we get into a bad jam guns
j will be thrown into the hands of
| these three million.
And there is still a big. cloudy
j silence from the Navy about the
Aleutians.
