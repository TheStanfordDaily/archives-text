# Women Bob Up In Men's Janitor Work
## 
### 
The Big Cecils are on their way !
out—for the duration at least.
Big Cecil Lewis is foreman of
Stanford janitors. We were chat
ting about the janitorial business
when the black bell under the eaves
of the janitors' dorm clanged noisily,
heralding 4:45 and dinner time. Ten
minutes later we were sipping lem
onade in the janitors' dining hall.
Big Cecil jerked his thumb across
the hall to 12 women.
"With one exception," he ex
plained, "all these janitresses have
been taken on since December 7. Our
staff of men was seriously depleted
and they've saved the day."
JANITRESSES PRAISED
Big Cecil went on to praise these
women who have adapted themselves
remarkably to men's jobs. In many
instances they excel men, especially
in bed-making.
Big Cecil passed the bread and
apricots and mentioned that this
was not an experiment. Eastern col
leges, such as Yale, have had women
on their staffs for years. In further
praise, he commented that the
women were less transient than men
and accordingly more l'eliable,
DOMESTIC ATMOSPHERE
Across the table was Clara Bur
i ris, who sweeps clean the School of
| Business every evening. Clara is one
| of the Big Twelve new women, who
; have brought a domestic atmosphere
jto the janitors' community. Gera
! niums on the dining tables, lace
curtains and fresh paint mark the
recent women's influence.
Big Cecil chuckled as he remarked
1 that many new mattresses had been
j acquired to replace the old hair
j ones. Several women had allergy to
i pig, goat, and cow hair.
The janitors on campus are gov-
I erned independently of the school.
They comprise the Stanford branch
of the American Building Mainte
nance Company, which has staffs
working across the continent. They
are known as the "world's largest
janitorial service contractors."
BOSS MISSES DINNER
Big Cecil and his crew are not
: necessarily restricted to campus
I work. Yesterday, he and a handful
of men spent the day cleaning out
[ Moffatt Field barracks.
The big boss of the maintenance
j community is Mr. Brown. He missed
1 dinner last night in order to run up
to the city for the payrolls. Brown
has endeavored to stimulate the
'"big-family" atmosphere there with
| frequent picnics and social gather
ings.

Big Cecil Lewis is foreman of
Stanford janitors. We were chat
ting about the janitorial business
when the black bell under the eaves
of the janitors' dorm clanged noisily,
heralding 4:45 and dinner time. Ten
minutes later we were sipping lem
onade in the janitors' dining hall.
Big Cecil jerked his thumb across
the hall to 12 women.
"With one exception," he ex
plained, "all these janitresses have
been taken on since December 7. Our
staff of men was seriously depleted
and they've saved the day."
JANITRESSES PRAISED
Big Cecil went on to praise these
women who have adapted themselves
remarkably to men's jobs. In many
instances they excel men, especially
in bed-making.
Big Cecil passed the bread and
apricots and mentioned that this
was not an experiment. Eastern col
leges, such as Yale, have had women
on their staffs for years. In further
praise, he commented that the
women were less transient than men
and accordingly more l'eliable,
DOMESTIC ATMOSPHERE
Across the table was Clara Bur
i ris, who sweeps clean the School of
| Business every evening. Clara is one
| of the Big Twelve new women, who
; have brought a domestic atmosphere
jto the janitors' community. Gera
! niums on the dining tables, lace
curtains and fresh paint mark the
recent women's influence.
Big Cecil chuckled as he remarked
1 that many new mattresses had been
j acquired to replace the old hair
j ones. Several women had allergy to
i pig, goat, and cow hair.
The janitors on campus are gov-
I erned independently of the school.
They comprise the Stanford branch
of the American Building Mainte
nance Company, which has staffs
working across the continent. They
are known as the "world's largest
janitorial service contractors."
BOSS MISSES DINNER
Big Cecil and his crew are not
: necessarily restricted to campus
I work. Yesterday, he and a handful
of men spent the day cleaning out
[ Moffatt Field barracks.
The big boss of the maintenance
j community is Mr. Brown. He missed
1 dinner last night in order to run up
to the city for the payrolls. Brown
has endeavored to stimulate the
'"big-family" atmosphere there with
| frequent picnics and social gather
ings.
The Big Cecils are on their way !
out—for the duration at least.
