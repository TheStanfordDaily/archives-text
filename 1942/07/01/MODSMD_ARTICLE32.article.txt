# Critic Lauds Long Concert
## 
### 
The London String Quartet of
course played perfectly in the first
of its series of five Stanford con
certs in the Memorial Hall last night:
perfect intonation, perfect ensemble;
Beethovenian dynamics and Ravelian
tonal effects and Haydnian classical
blends, all done perfectly; and you
wonder how Evans could play a
'cello so effortlessly and Primrose
could get such a superb tone from
the viola.
But even in the inviolate field of
the string quartet, I propose to in
voke recriminations upon myself
with matters revolutionary. Perfect
though the performance was, and
well chosen the selections, a two
hour string concert is too much of a
good thing. All string quartets should
be cut down to a maximum of 15
minutes. For though it is true a
string quartet produces the most
perfect blend of any instruments,
and although there are infinite pos
sibilities for change in effects, there
are no possibilities for change in in
struments; a group of four instru
ments should not attempt composi
' tions as long as symphonies, which
are played in the same length of time
With four families of instruments.
Maybe a piano solo could be insert
ed between numbers. Though to be
sure a chamber concert has probably
never been better.
The distinguished players must
have gotten awfully hot in tuxes. Of
all the long-haired conventions, the

most handicapping for string play
ers is the necessity of playing in
coats—particularly on summer eve
nings.—Covey
