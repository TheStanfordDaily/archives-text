# Stamp Sales Grow as SWB War Funds Com Pushes Drive
## 
### 
It was in the days of the Sylvia Berry legend that Nancy Schermerhorn
began her career on the War Funds Committee of the Stanford War Board.
Starting on the war stamps booths, "Skermie" soon became chairman of
the War Funds Committee, which includes "Dimes for Diplomas." war stamp
sales, and special money-raising drives.

The War Funds Committee has*
become one of the most important
divisions of the War Board and is
doing an excellent job of raising the
stufT that buys the guns.
$500 IN DIMES
"Dimes for Diplomas" has already
collected $500. This money will help
students who have had an inter
rupted education through school
after the Victory.
And already this quarter war
stamp sales have soared close to the
$2000 mark. Moreover, there is
every indication that stamp sales
will boom upward as the summer
progresses.
These figures are, to say the least,
encouraging, and they are particu
larly so when one realizes that
Stanford's enrollment is only about
50 per cent of what it will be in
autumn, winter, and spring quar
ters.
Working as a subdivision of the
War Funds Committee is the "Dimes
for Diplomas" organization, the war
stamps sales group, and a committee !
that will handle special drives as
occasion arises.

Jim Mcßrier is the hard-working j

he is doing a job that has very little
thanks in it from the campus in gen
eral. For people somehow don't like
to let go of as small a sum as 10 |
cents, even when it is for a thor- j
oughly worthwhile cause.
War stamp sales are under the di
rection of Nancy Schermerhorn. >

It was in the days of the Sylvia Berry legend that Nancy Schermerhorn
began her career on the War Funds Committee of the Stanford War Board.
Starting on the war stamps booths, "Skermie" soon became chairman of
the War Funds Committee, which includes "Dimes for Diplomas." war stamp
sales, and special money-raising drives.

The War Funds Committee has*
become one of the most important
divisions of the War Board and is
doing an excellent job of raising the
stufT that buys the guns.
$500 IN DIMES
"Dimes for Diplomas" has already
collected $500. This money will help
students who have had an inter
rupted education through school
after the Victory.
And already this quarter war
stamp sales have soared close to the
$2000 mark. Moreover, there is
every indication that stamp sales
will boom upward as the summer
progresses.
These figures are, to say the least,
encouraging, and they are particu
larly so when one realizes that
Stanford's enrollment is only about
50 per cent of what it will be in
autumn, winter, and spring quar
ters.
Working as a subdivision of the
War Funds Committee is the "Dimes
for Diplomas" organization, the war
stamps sales group, and a committee !
that will handle special drives as
occasion arises.
MrBRIER HEADS DIMES
Jim Mcßrier is the hard-working j
lad who is in charge of "Dimes," and i
he is doing a job that has very little
thanks in it from the campus in gen
eral. For people somehow don't like
to let go of as small a sum as 10 |
cents, even when it is for a thor- j
oughly worthwhile cause.
War stamp sales are under the di
rection of Nancy Schermerhorn. >
Working with her is a crew that
really brings in results. There is Jim !
Frolik, Eleanor Lindholm. Nancy I
Pelton. Diane Holmes, and Bob |
Hampton.
