# Masters States Need of Larger Fire Auxiliary
## War Courses, R.O.T.C. To Provide Members For Disaster Forces 
### 
Stanford Civilian Defense Admin
istrator Alfred Masters announced
yesterday the first organization de
tails of the auxiliary fire and police
forces for the summer.
Both the regular police and fire
departments need to be augmented
for emergency disaster work as they
are during other quarters, Masters
pointed out.
Although these staffs will be spe
cially instructed in the particular
work assigned to them. Police Chief
Gordy Davis and Fire Chief Arden
Hatley are counting on a large part
of the training coming from Stan
ford's course in civilian defense
work. The course, open to all stu
dents. offers two units credit.
FUTURE ADVANTAGES
'"We hope all members of our
present 20-man auxiliary police
force will enroll in the new defense
course," Police Chief Davis said
yesterday, pointing out that such
training is advantageous not only for
whatever civilian defense work stu
dents may be doing on the campus
but also for general civilian safety
when the trainees leave Stanford.
The large auxiliary police force
which operated last quarter has been
supplanted by a streamlined staff
which will be just as effective and
easier to handle, Chief Davis said.
CD. AREAS REARRANGED
''The areas will be rearranged, but
the force will be able to handle the
campus," he declared.
The large part of Fire Chief Hat
ley's auxiliary fire department will
be made up of men from Stanford's
R.O.T.C. unit, who, according to
Masters, have had training that will
make them extraordinarily valuable
in fire fighting. Chief Hatley, who
will supervise the training of his
auxiliary force, said yesterday that
although his list of R.O.T.C. men
numbered 188, there were 39 posi
tions yet to be filled.
It is expected that students, espe
cially those enrolled in the defense
course, will work into these posts.
The fire department training will
consist mostly of instruction in how
to get into different parts of the
buildings in and around the Quad,
and in the use of pumps and other
fire-fighting equipment, according to
Chief Hatley.
Tires lose pressure by dilution of
air into the rubber from inside the
tube and evaporation of air outside,
states the California State Automo
bile Association. Keep a careful
check on tire pressure.

which operated last quarter has been
supplanted by a streamlined staff
which will be just as effective and
easier to handle, Chief Davis said.

''The areas will be rearranged, but
the force will be able to handle the
campus," he declared.
The large part of Fire Chief Hat
ley's auxiliary fire department will
be made up of men from Stanford's
R.O.T.C. unit, who, according to
Masters, have had training that will
make them extraordinarily valuable
in fire fighting. Chief Hatley, who
will supervise the training of his
auxiliary force, said yesterday that
although his list of R.O.T.C. men
numbered 188, there were 39 posi
tions yet to be filled.
It is expected that students, espe
cially those enrolled in the defense
course, will work into these posts.
The fire department training will
consist mostly of instruction in how
to get into different parts of the
buildings in and around the Quad,
and in the use of pumps and other
fire-fighting equipment, according to
Chief Hatley.

Stanford Civilian Defense Admin
istrator Alfred Masters announced
yesterday the first organization de
tails of the auxiliary fire and police
forces for the summer.
Both the regular police and fire
departments need to be augmented
for emergency disaster work as they
are during other quarters, Masters
pointed out.
Although these staffs will be spe
cially instructed in the particular
work assigned to them. Police Chief
Gordy Davis and Fire Chief Arden
Hatley are counting on a large part
of the training coming from Stan
ford's course in civilian defense
work. The course, open to all stu
dents. offers two units credit.
FUTURE ADVANTAGES
'"We hope all members of our
present 20-man auxiliary police
force will enroll in the new defense
course," Police Chief Davis said
yesterday, pointing out that such
training is advantageous not only for
whatever civilian defense work stu
dents may be doing on the campus
but also for general civilian safety
when the trainees leave Stanford.
