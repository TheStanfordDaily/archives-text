# Handball Tourney Newly Scheduled
## 
### 
A new extra-curricular activity
has been added to the summer sport
ing schedule with the forming of a
handball tournament under the di
rection of Woody Wier, Coach Harry
Moloney, director of minor sports,
announced today.
All registered students and faculty
are invited to sign up at the intra
mural board in the Encina Gym as
soon as possible so that a ladder may
be formed. The competition will be
in singles and doubles. Winners
will have their name engraved upon
Ihe handball plaque in the Trophy
Room.
Your post-war car may be a more
pleasant and economical vehicle
than the present one as you are
likely to have plenty of 100-octane
gas for its operation. The California
State Automobile Association re
ports that a new process recently de
veloped is said to yield 50 per cent
more 100-octane fuel from a given
amount of synthetics.
