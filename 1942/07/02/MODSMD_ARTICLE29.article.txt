# Girls' War Workshop
## 
### 
STANFORD women now have
iO one of their first opportuni
ties to aid actively in the war.
The Stanford War Board and the
7.W.C.A. have established a
War Workroom on the third
•loor of the Women's Clubhouse
opposite the Y.W.C.A. club
ooms.
From Monday through Thurs
day, from 1:30 to 5 p.m., girls
may work on projects directly
connected with winning the
var. They will cut up stockings,
knit them into stretcher pads,
knit sweaters, etc.
These materials will go di
rectly to our boys on the front
lines all over the world. Not
only will the effort of Stanford
girls help increase the supply
of these needed medical aids,
but they will help release wom
en now doing this part - time
work for full-time war work in
defense industries.
This is the Stanford women's
chance to "get in the fight."—
