## PANHELLENIC PANDEMONIUM 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
JN LAGUNITA, all hell may soon
break loose. This should occasion
no surprise if you recall that mem
bers of nine sororities are bunched
within the same four walls with
over a hundred freshman girls.
The situation is wide open for
backbiting, hair pulling, necromancy
and hangnails. Just what steps are
being taken to keep the little frosh
pure until they can be cloistered in
Roble is not revealed.
Three sisters were seen showing
the Deke house to a couple of frosh

girls the other
day. One of
them slyly re
marked und e r
her breath, "If
you pledge our
house you can
pass the Deke
house a lot.
Then if you walk

light you can't help but get dates."
There was some attempt to with
draw the rule against sorority girls
and freshmen driving into Paly to
gether, but it seems that if this is
allowed the Row girls purposely
make themselves late and then they
take the frosh to lunch and rush the
hcck out of them.
Some solution will of course be
found, and you can bet it will be a
hum-dinger.
