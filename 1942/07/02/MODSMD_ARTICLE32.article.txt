# APARTMENT IN PALY
## 
### 
Y FELLOW I know found an
apartment in Paly at a ridicu
lously low rent. He was, however,
turned down by the owner who ex
plained that it would only be rented
to a mother and daughter.
Here we have a present-day
Canute. His reasons were that if he
rents it to girls they ask up boys
and if to boys they invite girls in.
To prevent this sort of thing is just
about as difficult as stopping the tide.
After all, who is he to break up
that happy combination of a boy and
a girl, together. Didn't nature in
tend it that way?
As long as we have people around
like that who insist on bucking the
fundamental laws of the universe
this world will be banana cream pie
to guys like Hitler.
