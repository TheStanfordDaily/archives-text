# ANOTHER PERIL TO FREEDOM
## 
### 
TJOWN IN THE CELLAR you
have no doubt noticed that
grievous insult to the maturity or
some such thing that college people
are supposed to possess.
After you have paid your dough
you are likely to become hopelessly
entangled in the Cellar's latest in
stallation to torment the minds of
Axis-threatened people. From the
window where you pay your checks
to the top of the first flight of stairs
there extends a chain.
This is the sort of thing men are
fighting to get rid of. While men die
on foreign fields the Cellar calmly
takes on an atmosphere of a dun
geon with bars and chains to ham
per the freedom of those who pa
tronize it.
And furthermore, after you have
paid your check the least one can
ask is to be permitted to go one's
own way without benefit of chains
to coerce.
Goebbels would like to know that
Stanford is installing chains in its
Cellar.
