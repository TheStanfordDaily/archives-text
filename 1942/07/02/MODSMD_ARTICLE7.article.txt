"Why they had to pick 5:50 in the'
morning is beyond me," commented
Charles Vance, associate director of
dramatics, yesterday, referring to a
notice he received from Selective
Draft Board 112 to report for in
duction the morning of July 22.
Vance is now in the midst of prepa
rations of the Stanford Players' first
show of the season. By coincidence
the first night of the play is the same
day as that of his induction. "Collect
on Delivery" will open without its
director in the wings.
"If it Ls not ready by then, it never
will be," remarked Vance when re
minded that he would not be on
hand to take care of last-minute
details.
"I hope to get a two weeks leave
in which I can get 'Tartuffe*

started," he replied when questioned
about the season's second produc
tion.
Vance came to Stanford two years
ago. Formerly he taught at North
western University, where he made
his M.A.
H& graduated from University of |
Missouri, receiving a bachelor of
journalism degree. Following com
mencement, he spent four years do
ing newspaper work in West Vir
ginia. He was a reporter, desk edi
tor. and cartoonist at one time or
another. Later, using his abilities in
art, he did advertisements and win
dow displays for a department store.
Vance hopes to get into dramatic
work during the time he will be a I
member of the army of the United !
States. 1
