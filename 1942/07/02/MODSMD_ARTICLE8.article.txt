# Council Makes War on Waste
## Conservation Group Directs War Salvage 
### BOB HANNAH 
(Editor's Note: This is the third
of a series cf stories on the Stan
ford War Board.)

One of the later developments of
the Stanford War Board was the
formation of the Conservation Coun
cil.
As the title suggests, the Council
is primarily interested in saving ma
terials that are of use to the war ef
fort, but it is also interested in
teaching students to eat and live well
in the face of present and. future
rationing.
The Council, which is under the
direct control of the Stanford War
Board, is composed of the heads of
the Salvage Drive, the Consumer
Group, and the Conservation Drive.
COLLECTING RUBBER
At present, hard working members
of the Council are collecting rubber
to augment the growing national
stock pile which is so essential in
keeping the Army rolling.
Stanford can still remember the
drive last quarter when trucks tour
ed the dorms and prowled the Row
searching for anything metal from
bed springs to old razor blades. And
that sort of thing is going on now
and will continue to go on until we
win the war.
CONSUMER EDUCATION
Consumer Education is something
we don't hear much about, but as
more goods are rationed, and as the
standard of living lowers, consumer
education is something we will want
pretty badly.
The group has made a study of
items that have been and are about
to be rationed, and it has proposed
substitutes to keep our diet up to
par.
It will also offer advice in sensible
buying so that students will not get
stuck when they are out on then
quarterly shopping tour. For, al
though price ceilings were fixed last
March, there was no depth limit
placed on quality cellars.
LETS SAVE!
Until Victory we have no right to
waste anything, be it as minute as a
toothpaste tube or a paper straw.
Let's help our country, our college,
and ourselves and "get in the scrap."

The group has made a study of
items that have been and are about
to be rationed, and it has proposed
substitutes to keep our diet up to

It will also offer advice in sensible

March, there was no depth limit
placed on quality cellars.
LETS SAVE!
Until Victory we have no right to
waste anything, be it as minute as a
toothpaste tube or a paper straw.
Let's help our country, our college,
and ourselves and "get in the scrap."
