ford War Board.)

Entertaining thousands of men in
uniform is no small job, but the
United Service Organization of
the Stanford War Board is not only
doing it, but doing it well.
In the past few months, soldiers
from nearby posts have found pleas
ant evenings and lots of fun because
of the efforts and organizing ability
of the Stanford branch of the USO.
WEEKLY ENTERTAINMENT
Last quarter several fraternities,
sororities, and living groups enter
tained soldiers at dinner, dancing,
and movies.
Already this quarter plans have
been announced by Lagunita con
cerning weekly entertainment of
soldiers. Each casa is to sponsor the
program for its designated week.
FARM MEN HELP
Farm men are already being or
ganized to play service men in soft
ball and other sports. These games
will be played at the many picnics
that the "roughs" will give the sol
diers this summer.
The USO, which handles all en
tertainment work on campus, is di
vided into three main parts: men's
entertainment, women's entertain
ment, and the Palo Alto co-ordinat
ing division.
