# JULY FOURTH HOURS
## 
### 
July Fourth won't be a holiday for
the government this year. Regular
hours, 8-12, will be the day's order
at the post office. The Union Cellar,
too, is going to 'keep its regular
schedule, 8-8. on both Saturday and
Sunday. The dining hall, closed all
of Saturday, will be open from 12:15
to 1:45 and from 6 to 7 p.m. on Sun
day. The Bookstore, however, will
be closed over the whole week-end.
