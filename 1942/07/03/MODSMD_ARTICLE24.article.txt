# 'Cat' Tears Out Pipeline on Quad
## 
### 
"What a novel way to water the
flowers!" exclaimed a frosh girl as a
spray of water shot 15 feet from a
broken pipe in front of the library.
Following a policy of beautifying
the Quad, Corp Yard men were run
ning a caterpillar tractor with a
heavy two-toothed ripper to break
up the asphalt.
The work was progressing nicely
when the machine slowed down and
the engine coughed. The driver con
fidently gave it more throttle. The
"cat" rumbled, settled down, and
roared off pulling part of the water
main with it.
As the machine went on its de
structive way an observer was heard
to remark, "I wonder if that guy
.knows his rear end's dragging."
