Maloney, dean of Stanford's coach
ing staff and present director of j
minor athletics, has applied for j
commission as a physical instructor !
at one of the Army's aviation ground
schools.
Harry has at one time or another
been coach, trainer and director of

and track and field athletics at
Stanford since coming to the Farm
in 1908.
A veteran of World War I and the
Boer War, Maloney today is in fine
; physical shape from daily exercise
! and can pass' any Army physical.
GREAT RECORD
Glance at his record and you find:
coach and trainer of the American
, track and field team, Inter-Allied
; games, Paris, 1919; trainer and rugby
| commissioner, American Olympic
; rugby team, Olympic games, Ant
! werp, Belgium, 1920: president of
! California Rugby Union from 1921
to 1924; coach and manager of Aus
; tralian tennis tour in 1924; captain,
United States Cavalry Reserve,
j 1917; and division athletic director,
Bth Division, Camp Fremont, Calif..
! 1918.
Maloney is quite a pugilist and
j tells how he boxed five nights in a
j row with a Navy champ as his
transport plowed across the Atlantic,
j Seems as if Maloney couldn't find his
j sea legs for a while and took five
j terrific beatings.
When he found himself again he
pummeled the much - surprised
champ and won a handy decision.
KEEPS FIT
Maloney keeps up with his boxing
| by taking an afternoon boxing class
j in which 50 men have signed up.
In instructing his classes, Maloney
| continually emphasizes that he does
j not want knock-down, drag-out
| fighters, but men who can really
| handle themselves should the situa
tion arise. It takes skill, quick
| thinking, and complete co-ordination
of mind and muscle to make a per
fect boxer.
With a willingness to create
strength and physical fitness in
America's manpower, Harry Maloney
keeps himself and the men he teaches
in the best condition possible to meet
the enemy's challenge.
