# We're Off!

### 
MAYBE Stanford students
will have entertainment
■for the rest of the quarter, for
several houses have started the
ball rolling with open houses
and dances planned for the
coming weeks. The quarter
opened with the reg dance,
freshman jolly-up and barbecue,
Sunday movie, and now the
Delta Chis, A.T.O.'s Sigma Nus,
and Lagunita have arranged
dances. There will be another
Sunday movie July 12.
Farther ahead in the A.S.S.U.
calendar is the scrap rubber
scavenger hunt, which is still
: n the embryo stage. Leslie
Langnecker, who is in charge of
■ granting dates, has hinted that
barbecues and similar affairs
are being planned.
For those who are staying on
campus tomorrow, the Women's
jym swimming pool will be
open from 2 to 6 p.m. It's too
bad that the big celebration
.scheduled for tomorrow had to
/all through because of lack of
,student interest. The whole pur
oose of the idea was to encour
age students to remain here on
the campus and save tires and
help lessen the congestion on
our highways.

Twenty years ago tomorrow,
'apan agreed to cut its army by
56.000 men. This was a result
of an agreement made at the
Washington Conference.
