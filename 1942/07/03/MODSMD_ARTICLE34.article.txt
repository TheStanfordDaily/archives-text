# Summer Farewell
## 
### 
TATITH the coming of really
V V warm summer days when
i good swim is appreciated,
what happens but old Lake La
junita is slowly being drained.
No more moonlight swims after
a few minutes of studying at the
library, but best of all, no more
:iiosquitoes to interrupt a good
night's sleep.
The lakebed is beginning to
look like a ghost of days gone
by when beautiful women and
bronzed males could be seen
splashing around from raft to
raft. But the situation is not so
bad as it sounds, for it won't be
?ong before rain clouds will
appear overhead and everyone
will be cursing the weather.
Then the lakebed will begin to
fill and Stanford will once again
jrek up to the blue and white
boathouse snuggled away un
der Lagunita Knoll.

Originality and good organi
zation prevail in the British
scrap metal salvage scheme, for
by June 1 the railway compa
nies had collected several hun
dred tons of old horseshoes,
1,000 fenders from station wait
ing rooms, and thirty tons of
iron railings from railway hotels.
