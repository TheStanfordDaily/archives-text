### BILL STEIF 
r pilE Egyptian melee is in bitter
full swing at this writing. The
outcome of the battle, a battle upon
which hinges the immediate fate of
Alexandria and Cairo and the less
immediate fate of the Suez Canal
and the whole Middle East, is in the
balance.

Between SO and (!0 miles from
Alexandria the British and the
Nazis struggle. The British say
that they have outflanked the
Nazis. They say that Empire re
serves have managed to skirt Rom
mel's right flank in the south and
are now attacking the German
units from the rear. This is
cheering news—the first from the
North African front since Tobruk
fell.

We cannot, of course, overestimate
this British report. The Allied
troops may not be in sufficient force
to destroy the enemy's l'ear. They,
themselves, may be whipped by that
rear. On the other hand, the British
front line troops may be able to ef
fect a break-through and join their
comrades, since the southern end of
Rommel's line is reputedly the
weakest portion of that lirie. If the
British could junction with their
own troops to Rommel's rear, the
result would be to slash off, isolate
Rommel's southern arm, in which
case the Nazis might be weakened
enough for the British to hold their
positions and, indeed, to start a
counter-offensive west. But that, I
must admit, is in part, at least, wish
ful thinking.
Nevertheless, Cairo says that
large new groups of reserves, 25-
pound cannon, and new anti-tank
guns, which the British have thus
far sadly lacked, are being brought
into the battle is a good omen par
ticularly.

JJUT at this moment one really
cannot tell what will happen in
Egypt. Cairo news dispatches are
scanty and even now. rather opti
mistic; the quality of reports from
Berlin and Rome—especially Rome
—are well known. We must sit and
see what the verdict will be, though
it is a task of self-torture when the
sitter-and-thinker realizes that his or
her destiny partially depends upon
death in the Egyptian desert.
Sevastopol, meanwhile, has for
all practical purposes fallen. Rus
sians. Germans, and Rumanians
are undoubtedly still killing each
other in the Sevastopol area, but
the Nazis seem to have broken the
innermost defenses of Sevastopol
and broken up concerted Soviet
resistance in most of the city. As a
base from which the Russians
could harrass the Germans, Sev
astopol apparently is through. The
city's end could hardly have been
otherwise, in fact. It bad no visible
means of supply and certainly did
not have a bottomless reservoir of
manpower. The saga of Sevasto
pol. it appears, is comparable to
that of Bataan.

On the political front Churchill
has again received a vote of confi
dence, this time by the second larg
est majority he has ever been given.
To force Churchill from his posts as
Prime Minister and Defense Minis
ter would, of course, have been one
of the most assinine tricks Parlia
ment could have pulled. The whole
campaign to tear the man away from
the Defense Minister's portfolio was
conducted along strictly negative
lines and. in fact, seemed to show
all the more fully that, while
Churchill may not possess the pseu
do-Gothic intuition of a Hitler, he
has the tenacity, the regenerative
capacity, the blunt honesty and feel
ing for just-common you and I,
which, I think, represent the Eng
lish people at their best.
And still the Navy says nothing
about what is going on up in the
Aleutians.

astopol apparently is through. The

that of Bataan.

On the political front Churchill

conducted along strictly negative
lines and. in fact, seemed to show
all the more fully that, while
Churchill may not possess the pseu
do-Gothic intuition of a Hitler, he
has the tenacity, the regenerative
capacity, the blunt honesty and feel
ing for just-common you and I,
which, I think, represent the Eng

And still the Navy says nothing
about what is going on up in the

r pilE Egyptian melee is in bitter
full swing at this writing. The
outcome of the battle, a battle upon
which hinges the immediate fate of
Alexandria and Cairo and the less
immediate fate of the Suez Canal
and the whole Middle East, is in the
balance.

Between SO and (!0 miles from
Alexandria the British and the
Nazis struggle. The British say
that they have outflanked the
Nazis. They say that Empire re
serves have managed to skirt Rom
mel's right flank in the south and
are now attacking the German
units from the rear. This is
cheering news—the first from the
North African front since Tobruk
fell.

We cannot, of course, overestimate
this British report. The Allied
troops may not be in sufficient force
to destroy the enemy's l'ear. They,
themselves, may be whipped by that
rear. On the other hand, the British
front line troops may be able to ef
fect a break-through and join their
comrades, since the southern end of
Rommel's line is reputedly the
weakest portion of that lirie. If the
British could junction with their
own troops to Rommel's rear, the
result would be to slash off, isolate
Rommel's southern arm, in which
case the Nazis might be weakened
enough for the British to hold their
positions and, indeed, to start a
counter-offensive west. But that, I
must admit, is in part, at least, wish
ful thinking.
Nevertheless, Cairo says that
large new groups of reserves, 25-
pound cannon, and new anti-tank
guns, which the British have thus
far sadly lacked, are being brought
into the battle is a good omen par
ticularly.

JJUT at this moment one really
cannot tell what will happen in
Egypt. Cairo news dispatches are
scanty and even now. rather opti
mistic; the quality of reports from
Berlin and Rome—especially Rome
—are well known. We must sit and
see what the verdict will be, though
it is a task of self-torture when the
sitter-and-thinker realizes that his or
her destiny partially depends upon
death in the Egyptian desert.
Sevastopol, meanwhile, has for
all practical purposes fallen. Rus
sians. Germans, and Rumanians
are undoubtedly still killing each
other in the Sevastopol area, but
the Nazis seem to have broken the
innermost defenses of Sevastopol
and broken up concerted Soviet
resistance in most of the city. As a
