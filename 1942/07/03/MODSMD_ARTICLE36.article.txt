"THE WIFE TAKES A FLIER,"
now playing at the Stanford in
I'alo Alto.
"The Wife Takes a Flyer" is a
slapstickish farce which suffers
while attempting to be semi-dra
matic in the second half. It concerns
an RAF pilot (Franchot Tone) who
gets mixed up with a woman (Joan
Bennett), who is trying to get di
vorced from a maniac in occupied
Holland. The idea of the picture is
to portray the Nazis as buffoons—an
idea which deflates when it strains
to be serious.
RIDICULE AND REALISM
The one picture since "The Great
Dictator" which has successfully ac
complished ridicule and realism
when dealing with the Nazis is now
back at the Varsity and is recom
mended from this corner for second
seeing.
For "To Be or Not to Bo," if not
the first ranking comedy of the year,
is at least the most distinctive in the
respect just mentioned: combining
comedy and tragedy without sacri
ficing either.
FINER POINTS
As for the finer points which pro
vide such distinction, not for one
example at random, the skill with
which the Horst-Wessel Song and
Chopin's Milithry Polonaise are
utilized in the background music.
Add to that the Korda direction and
the Lubitsch writing, etc., and you
see how "To Be or Not to Be" shows
up "The Wife Takes a Flyer."
Walter Huston does nobly in the
second-billed quasi-musical.—Covey
