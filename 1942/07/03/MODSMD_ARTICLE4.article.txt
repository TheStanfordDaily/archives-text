# Farm To Combine Fun, War Work on Fourth
## 
### 
"In emphasizing an on-campus Fourth of July, Stanford will combine
recreation and war preparation at the women's swimming pool tomorrow,"
announced Leslie Langnecker, A.S.S.U. vice-president, yesterday.
A program has been planned jointly by the War Activities Hoard and
the Y.W.C.A. whereby the Army's emergency call for knit beanies and

gun mitts will be answered. Jean - *
Louise Nafziger, who helped found
the Y.W.C.A. War Workshop last
week, will transport knitting facili
ties to the women's pool and volun
teers will devote Saturday afternoon
to short knitting projects and swim
ming.
Badminton, volley ball, and tennis
courts will be open to men and
women, from 2 to G p.m., announced
Miss Langnecker.
Although women have traditionally
carried on knitting and stretcher
sewing activities, Miss Patricia Dav
idson expressed the hope that men
will follow in the footsteps of Bob
Collins, War Board chairman, who
has proved himself expert in
stretcher construction.
Miss Davidson, secretary of the
Y.W.C.A.. who is in charge of the
Workshop which was organized last
week, announced that there is a dire
need for knitters. Army stretcher
pads sewn from silk stockings are
also needed. The workshop, on the
top floor of the Women's Clubhouse,
is open Mondays through Thursdays
from 1:30 to 5. Volunteers may sign
up during these hours. Work will be
carried on for the duration.
