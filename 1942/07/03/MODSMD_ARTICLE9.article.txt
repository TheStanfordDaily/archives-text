# P.C.C. Blasts at Intramural Grid
## Summer Tilts Held Infraction Of Regulation 
### DON SELBY 
Any plans that Stanford students
had of competing in intramural
football this summer were blasted 1
yesterday with the announcement by
Professor W. B. Owens, Stanford's
Pacific Coast Conference athletic
representative, that such activity
would be in violation of conference
regulations.
As a matter of fact, no teams signed
up for the grid competition, accord
ing to Harry Wolter, faculty director
of intramurals, although a telephone
check of several organizations last
week revealed an interest in the
sport this summer.
BASED ON P.C.C. RULE
The basis for Professor Owens' de
cision was the Pacific Coast Confer
ence rule which states that any is
suance of football equipment be
tween the close of spring football
practice and the opening of fall
football practice is illegal.
It is believed, however, that the
rule was drawn up to prevent con
ference universities from holding
organized summer varsity football
drills, with no consideration of the
idea that the student body might
want to play the game during thq
summer in organized leagues.
STATEMENT OE RULE
The rule states that football can
be played if it is a required part
the University's physical education
program, but since Stanford's intra
mural slate is not a required activity
of the physical education program,
such competition would be illegal
here.
At the University of California, al
though an extra large summer intra
mural slate has been drafted, foot
ball will not be played.
