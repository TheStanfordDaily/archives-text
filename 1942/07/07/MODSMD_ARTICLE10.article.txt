# Eastern Experts To Teach Course
## 
### 
Eighty students taking defense
courses are now using three new
electrical laboratories, equipped for
study in the high-frequency field |
and constructed in the Stanford en
gineering department. Among these j
students are members of a signal
corps group, the first of three such
groups.
An additional defense course in
"The Application of Statistics to
Quality Control in Industry" is to
be given between July 17 and 2G by
two eastern experts, W. Edwards
Deming and David Kinsler, with the
aid of Hoi brook Working and Eu
gene L. Grant, of Stanford.
It is hoped, according to Professor i
Grant, that this course will aid in
bringing improved industrial meth- j
ods to the west coast.
