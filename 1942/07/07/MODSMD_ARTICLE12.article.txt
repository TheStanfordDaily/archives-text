# 'Dimes' Total Climbs to $610 In Third Week
## McBrier Announces Last Week's Figure Is Exceeded by $20 
### 
Five collection boxes augmented
last night's Dimes for Diplomas;
drive and increased last week's fig
ure by $20. bringing the grand total
to $<>10.
Jim Mcßrier, Rally Committee
chairman, was pleased by the in
crease, but remarked that "the
weekly goal of $100 is still remote,
gauging by this summer's response."
Mcßrier's goal would be reached if
50 per cent of the summer students
were to donate a dime each Monday
evening during the dinner hour.
FRATERNITY INCREASE
The fraternities boosted their con
tribution this week to $11.54, a 25
per cent increase over last week, ac
cording to Jack Witz, supervisor o?
fraternity collections. Lagunita's re
turns declined to $18, after donating
50 per cent of last week's total.
Collection boxes adjoining war
stamp booths Wednesday will swell
this week's "Dimes," in a new at
tempt to intensify the drive.
The Rally Committee attributed a
portion of this week's increase to an
address to an Education assembly*
yesterday afternoon, in an effort to
comb the campus more thoroughly.
CHAIRMAN AND STAFF
Working with Chairman Mcßrier
on the Dimes for Diplomas drive are
Jack Witz, Bob Ashley, Tom Bond,
Jeff Howe, Euna McCullers, Katie
Gore, "Tink" Downey, and Pat
George. Each one of these members
supervises collections at the various
eating groups.
The Dimes for Diplomas drive was
inaugurated last quarter when it
became apparent that many men
students, compelled to leave Stan
ford for the armed services, would
be financially unable to continue
college after the victory.
Fifty such students will be granted
one-quarter scholarships from the
Dimes for Diplomas fund.
