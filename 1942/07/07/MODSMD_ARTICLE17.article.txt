# Defense Class Begins July 8
## Coman, Luckett Start Civilian Safety Class 
### 
Stanford's Civilian Defense class,
which will be taught by Edwin T.
Coman and Mr. G. S. Luckett, will
meet for the first time tomorrow in
Room 2 of the Education Building at
7 p.m. to organize, Alfred R. Mas
ters, Civilian Defense Administra
tor for Stanford, announced yester
day.
There will be just one meeting
this week, Masters said. The class
regularly will be held each Wednes
day and Thursday night from 7 to 9.
Because the course is late in getting
started, it will bring one unit of
credit to enrol lees, according to
Masters. The course was originally
scheduled for two units.
"It's quite important that all per
sons working in Civilian Defense on
ihe campus enroll for (his class," said
Masters, who pointed out that the
training will be useful not only for
work here but for general civilian
safety wherever the trainee may be.
"Because we must always be
building and rebuilding an ever
changing Civilian Defense staff on
campus, we must do a quick but
complete job of training the men,"
Masters declared, "and this class is
the best instruction in this work a
man can get."
