# Maybe We Don't Care

### 
LAST Saturday our neighbors
across the bay at Berkeley
held a true patriotic celebration
for the Fourth. There were
speeches, band selections, and
a parade. Here at Stanford we
had the women's swimming
pool open; our proposed Satur
day night program fell through i
because of lack of interest.
Of course at Cal there is more
manpower with which to work,
which makes for larger audi
ences and more participants.
But at least the Berkeleyites
planned a good program and
went through with it.
It would seem that there were
enough R.O.T.C. men for a
marching unit and enough stu
dents to make up a band so that
Stanford could have put on a
jood program on a day which
should have had some meaning
to members of the cosmopolitan
group gathered here on the
campus.
Maybe we would rather waste
our time and tires with rides to
beaches and far-away cities.
