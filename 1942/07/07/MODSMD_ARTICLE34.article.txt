# Dear Mom:

### 
THINGS are different here at
school from what they have
been during the other eleven
quarters I've been here. What
with the rubber shortage and all,
almost all the service organiza
tions are emphasizing a "stay
on-campus" move.
Although it isn't new this
quarter, Sunday movies in the
auditorium have become quite
oopular as part of this move.
Since they only cost 20 cents,
!hey certainly save the kids
Tioney. Naturally, they save
tires, too.
I certainly wish, though, that
:here were some football or bas
cetball games or some other in
ercollegiate sports here this
summer. Of course, this four
quarter plan on a large scale is
.30 new that it sort of compli
cates the athletic picture, which
has always been based on com
petition from September to June
only.
But I was talking to some fel
lows the other day who sug
gested that it would be really
interesting to see some moving
pictures of Stanford's football
and basketball games of the past
few years, especially the movie
Everett Dean had taken of the
basketball play-offs in
Xansas City this year.
It certainly sounds like a good
*dea to me. A1 Masters, Board
of Athletic Control head, said
Jhat the 8.A.C., which has pos
session of most of the movies,
would be glad to furnish the
;'ilms. So all that has to be done
now is to have someone show
them. Maybe the A.S.S.U.,
which is the student body, will
qo for the idea. Leslie Lang
necker, the vice-president,
seems to like it. I hope some
thing comes of the plan.
