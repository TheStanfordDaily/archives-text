WHAT DO YOU TIIINK.
BABY?
JN AN EFFORT to find out what
Stanford girls think about Sum
mer Quarter, we conducted a poll to
get some idea of the various re
actions. In the course of our inves
tigation we approached 27 Stanford
girls.
Seven of them, before we had a
chance to say anything, said how
sorry they were but they already
had dates, but would we call next

week.
Three let out a loud shriek,
shouting, "Get away from me
you dog, I know all about
you Stanford men."
Eleven looked amazed and
said, "An opinion, do you

really mean we're supposed to have
opinions?"
Six said, "We never speak to
strange men, that is, unless they are
in convertibles."
The last one said she worked at
the Whoopee Shop and would I
drive her home. With that the in
vestigation ended abruptly.

THE SAD CONDITION
OF AN OLD TRADITION
'jpHE OTHER DAY, while waiting
in the hot sun outside Encina, I
watched three fellows try to get a
ride to Palo Alto.
It may be that new students
are as yet ignorant of the old cus
tom of picking up students who
are waiting to get to Paly; perhaps
even they are avoiding stops and
starts in an effort to conserve
rubber.
At least a dozen cars of so-minded
drivers passed by these fellows. Then
along came one that stopped. It was
at once apparent why.
Driving the car was Miss Margaret
Storey, a woman well acquainted
with Stanford and its traditions.
Miss Storey is known to all who
have attended Stanford track meets.
She often acts as a timer.
Stanford traditions are easy to fol
low, and fun too, particularly if it
helps someone else.
