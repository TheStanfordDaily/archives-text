# IT'S THE CUSTOM ON THE QUAD
## 
### 
j tradition that one sees
I being ignored from time to time
is that of refraining from smoking on
the Quad. This is probably the old
est custom, second to cutting classes,
that we have around here.
When we discuss the Quad and its
traditions there comes to mind the
famous one that concerns becoming
a Stanford woman.
Tradition has it that a Stanford
girl does not become a Stanford
Woman until she has been kissed in
the moonlight on the Quad by a
Stanford senior.
Seniors being, by nature, modest
creatures, it is not wise to suggest
that they enter into this tradition
with you in any off-hand way. If
you wish to become a Stanford
Woman, girls, be cautious about how
you handle the whole affair.

"If a man kills his brother, what
is that?"
"A fratricide."
"And if he kills his father?"
"A patricide."
"And if he kills a child?"
"An infanticide."
"And if he kills a man?"
"A homicide."
"And if he kills a girt?"
j "A broadside."
