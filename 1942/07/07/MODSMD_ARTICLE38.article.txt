## Alladine Bell's Play Termed 'Wonderful' 
### JACK OGLESBY 
"Alladine Bell is certainly a more '
talented writer than I was at her
age, and you can quote me on that."
There were the words that Mrs.
Aurania Rouverol, writer of such
Broadway successes as "Skidding,"
"Young April," and "Growing Pains,"
had for the author of the Stanford
Players' first production this season
during an interview Saturday after
noon.
"It's wonderful to find a young
writer doing comedy for a change,"
Mrs. Rouverol continued. "Most of
them seem to think of nothing but
tragedy."
SPENDING SUMMER HERE
Mrs. Rouverol, who is spending
the summer at Stanford as play
wright in residence with the Speech
and Drama department, has aided
Miss Bell, also of the department, in
the preparation of "Collect on De
livery" for production with sugges
tions and criticism.
"After reading her play and seeing
the first rehearsal, I believe she has
written an outstanding show," she
said. "The play is not the first Miss
Bell has written. Two previous
works, in the opinion of Mrs. Rou
verol, are Broadway material.
"It's a long jump from the amateur
field to the professional," Mrs. Rou
verol remarked with particular
emphasis on "long," but she feels
that Miss Bell has the talent to take
her on the road to success.

However, during those student
days she was far from being inactive.
She appeared in all the campus pro
ductions with leading roles and
wrote Stanford's "Come Join the
Band."
Following graduation, she did
short stories. Her first great success
on Broadway was "Skidding." This
play was bought by a Hollywood
studio and the screen version was the
first of the now famous Hardy fam
ily series.

play which she might produce at
Stanford.
As to crashing Hollywood as a
writer, Mrs. Rouverol advises writing
a successful novel or play.
"Studios will not read a manu
script unless it is backed by a promi
nent agent or comes from a well
known writer," she says.

"It's a long jump from the amateur
field to the professional," Mrs. Rou
verol remarked with particular
emphasis on "long," but she feels
that Miss Bell has the talent to take
her on the road to success.
STANFORD GRADUATE
Mrs. Rouverol is a Stanford grad
uate. She was a student at the Uni
versity during the time of the San
Francisco earthquake. In fact, the
quake prevented production of the
only play Mrs. Rouverol wrote dur
ing her undergraduate years.
However, during those student
days she was far from being inactive.
She appeared in all the campus pro
ductions with leading roles and
wrote Stanford's "Come Join the
Band."
Following graduation, she did
short stories. Her first great success
on Broadway was "Skidding." This
play was bought by a Hollywood
studio and the screen version was the
first of the now famous Hardy fam
ily series.
DAUGHTER ON RADIO
Mrs. Rouverol has a son. William,
and a daughter. Jean. Her son is do
ing graduate work in college. Jean
is familiar to radio listeners as
"Betty" in "One Man's Family." She
also is under contract ot a Holly
wood studio, the result of her per
formance in her mother's Broadway
production, "Young April." Mrs.
Rouverol is now working on a new
play which she might produce at
Stanford.
As to crashing Hollywood as a
writer, Mrs. Rouverol advises writing
a successful novel or play.
"Studios will not read a manu
script unless it is backed by a promi
nent agent or comes from a well
known writer," she says.
"Alladine Bell is certainly a more '
talented writer than I was at her
age, and you can quote me on that."
There were the words that Mrs.
Aurania Rouverol, writer of such
Broadway successes as "Skidding,"
"Young April," and "Growing Pains,"
had for the author of the Stanford
Players' first production this season
during an interview Saturday after
noon.
"It's wonderful to find a young
writer doing comedy for a change,"
Mrs. Rouverol continued. "Most of
them seem to think of nothing but
tragedy."
SPENDING SUMMER HERE
Mrs. Rouverol, who is spending
the summer at Stanford as play
wright in residence with the Speech
and Drama department, has aided
Miss Bell, also of the department, in
the preparation of "Collect on De

the first rehearsal, I believe she has
written an outstanding show," she
said. "The play is not the first Miss
Bell has written. Two previous
works, in the opinion of Mrs. Rou
verol, are Broadway material.
