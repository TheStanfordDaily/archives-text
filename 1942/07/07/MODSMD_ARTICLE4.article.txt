By BOB HANNAH

The Red Cross and the Y.W.C.A.
have sent vast aid in the form of
equipment, blood plasma, and
trained personnel to American forces
throughout the country and over the
world.
The two groups function as a single
unit of the Stanford War Board, al
though they are separate organiza
tions.
The "Y" has organized a work
room in which girls knit, make
stretcher pads, and army kits. More
over, the Civilian Defense classes
which are open to students are a re
sult of the work of the "Y" members.
C D. CLASSES VARIED
C.D. classes are varied, useful, and
interesting from the personal as well
as war standpoint. In them the stu
dent may study water safety, nutri
tion, nurse's aid, first aid, home nurs
ing, and motor mechanics.
Pearl Harbor showed how im
portant it is to have blood plasma on
the spot when it is needed. The Red
Cross, immediately realizing the
need for blood, issued a call for do
nators who wished to give blood for
their fighting men. There have al
ready been several days when stu
dents could donate, and there will
be more this summer and next year.
SPECIAL DIVISIONS
A fifth group of the Stanford War
Board is the Special Divisions. These
divisions are primarily for the in
ternal organization of the Board.
Groups of the Special Divisions are
the Speaker Service, the Publicity
Committee, Public Relations, and
the Morale Discussion Group.
