"THIS ABOVE ALL," now playing
at the Stanford in Palo Alto.
"This Above All" is of the first
twenty calibre of high-grade mo
tion pictures, and as such is also one
of the half dozen blue-ribbon war
pictures of 1942.
However, compared to Eric
Knight's book, which is followed
fairly closely, the picture in places
is almost second-rate. Like the book,
the picture is primarily a vehicle for
the exposition of opposing points of
view on the question of England's
preservation. In the cinema version
the arguments are presented neither
completely nor always clearly; and
the action, which should make the
ideas move along, is impeded by too
many scenes in which conversation
continues while Prudence changes
clothes.
The ending in particular loses its
poignancy compared to the book,
partly because Clive was still alive
(and quoting Shakespeare) and
partly because all paragraphs deal
ing with Prudence's pregnancy were
carefully excised, thus spoiling much
of the point.
These discrepancies, excisions, and
too many clothes-changing scenes do
not, nevertheless, overly detract
from the picture's excellence. The
picture in fact does one thing the
book could not—authentically orient
a non-Britisher in England; views
such as the sea through an open
window do that very well. And
parts of the picture, the opening din
ner dialog for example, actually
outdo parallel passages in the book.
And Tyrone Power, who is surpris
ingly good, with Joan Fontaine, who
is always good, turn in two outstand
| ing acting performances.
And by and large, in spite of the
j shears of the scenarist and the
shears of the censor, the vital con
flict of minds, whose presentations
made the novel a best-seller,
sentially retained in the picture.—
