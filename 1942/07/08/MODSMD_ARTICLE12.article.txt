# Farm Grad Wins Service Cross in Java Sea Battle
## Former Card Trackman Relates Experiences in Far Eastern Army 
### DAVE DAVIS 
"I'll tell you about it when this is all over, and then I'll scare you." Sci
wrote Lieutenant Les Johnsen, Stanford '40, to his wife, Eleanor Johnsen,
'42, in describing his participation in the Java Sea Battle for which he was
awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross.
A sprinter and quarter-miler during 1939-40, Les entered the Army Air

Corps after graduating and received
his wings on July 11, 1941. The next
day he married "Peanuts" Haller.
August, 1941, and Les was on active
duty. December, 1941, heralded his
departure for "parts unknown."
PASSES CENSOR
The next "Peanuts" heard was that
she had missed a telephone call from
someone in Australia. In the mean
time the war was popping in the
Philippines, and Les did not have
time to wait for telephone connec
tions. Arriving in Java he called the
United States again, missed "Pea
nuts" once more, but at the same
time sent her a cablegram giving the
name of the town in which he was
stationed.
"I don't know how it got past the
censor," Mrs. Johnsen said, "but I
placed a call for this town as soon as
I could. Four days later I got con
nected to Java all right, but it wag
the wrong Johnson. But 10 minuteg
later I heard Les shouting over the
phone. We got two minutes. We had
this convei'sation the day before the
Java sea battle started. About a
week later General Mac Arthur left
the Philippines."
Mrs. Johnsen writes Les every
day, but his return letters are nec
essarily vague as to his location and
activities.
LIVES IN GRASS HUT
Les now, however, is leading a
squadron with the United States In
terceptor Command in northern
Australia, living in one of the "alert"'
battle stations with six other men.
They live in a grass hut, a huge
sign over the door reading, "Rain
bow Room." Inside, the eyes of a
visitor would immediately be at
tracted to the picture of a lushly
curved female. An empty beer
bottle hangs from the ceiling, la
beled. "A Flyer's Dream." An Army
recruiting poster, "Join the Army and
See the World," almost covers the
roof—underneath it is lettered a sar
castic, "Nuts!"
Once a week the men get a day
off and often pack up equipment fo
alligator or water buffalo hunting.
