# Blaze Consumes Two Miles of Hay
## 
### 
Roaring flames, sweeping through
a field in the southeast corner of the
campus, consumed over two square
miles of oat hay late yesterday af
ternoon.
Calling the blaze the "best grass
fire I've seen in years," Chief Clemo
of the Palo Alto fire department ex
pressed the belief that the fire origi
nated in the dump south of the
R.O.T.C. stables.
Hundreds of spectators stood in
the dense smoke that hung over
Bayshore Highway and Mayfield
Avenue and watched almost 100
soot-covered firemen combat the
blaze.
Over 200 yards of wooden fence
on Mayfield Avenue were burned,
and residents of the area extin
guished the embers with water
buckets and garden hoses.
