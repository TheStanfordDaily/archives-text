# Mahan's One-Hitter Highlights I-M Openers
## Shutouts, High Scores Mar First Round of Softball Play 
### 
Weather excruciating, three shutouts, three football scores, and a one
hitter tossed by Page Mill's Ellis Mahan highlighted the opening of Stan
lord's Summer Quarter Softball League yesterday. Mahan, hurling for
the Rambling Wrecks, all-Page Mill squad, gave up only one safety as his
teammates pounded Jack McDonald for seven and won over the Cut
ters, 8-0. â™¦ _

Among the shutouts was a 17-2
shellacking administered by the So
cialists over O'Reilly's club. The So
cialists broke out in a ten-run rash
in the second inning and coasted all
the way.
Bill Stover's double with the bases
loaded and two in the last half of
the final inning gave the Fijis a 16-15
win over Encina 18. It was a free
hitting affair with Jerry Stapleton
the winning pitcher. Bill Helm
pitched for Encina.
PIED TYPERS PIED
The Pied Typers were pied, tied,
groggy, and foggy as Marsh Weigel
and the Biz Wigs turned loose boom
ing bats and good pitching to quaff
the writers, 17-0. Weigel pitched for
the winners and got a triple and a
homer in three trips to the plate. The
Typers, who beat the Biz Wigs in a
practice game, used four pitchers
and generally were very loose afield,
erring 14 times.
The Pied ones paraded four hurl
ers to the mound, starting with
George Tolman, who gave way to
Jerry Mayer, who gave way to Salty
Son tag, who gave way to Mayer, who
gave way to Charlie Allen.
Southpaw Tommy Kruger's long
hit down the left field foul line
caught Pied left-fielder Johnny Hor
rall for a triple. Daily Editor Horrall
made up for his miscue with a beau
tiful running catch in the next inn
ing.
FLASIIY FIELDING
In a game marked by the winners'
flashy fielding, the Spar Ducks
dumped the second-year Med School
7-2. Lyle Reynolds, California track
captain in 1934. doubled with two
aboard. Hanslader and Beeson
formed the winning battery.
Sherm Anderson's home run in the
second inning led the Alpha Delts to
a 5-2 win over the Lower Row. Jim
Boswell, shortstop, looked good in
the field, as did first-basemen Dave
Doud. Bob Mapel collected a couple
of timely hits for the victors. The
battery of Bob Woodward and Bob
McLean performed for the Alpha
Delts.
ENCINA IV-V ROUTED
Behind the one-run hurling of
Harry Booth, the Alpha Sig-Theta
Chi nine won a 7-1 rout over Encina
IV-V. Phil Rice scored three runs
for the winners.
Buzzy Munroe homered with two
men on to give the Chi sis a 12-9
victory over the Upper Row.
Freddy Oliver, one hand bandaged

and unusable, played roving short
stop for the Zetes, completing several
sensational fielding plays as the Zetes
won a hotly-contested game from
Encina 11-111, 4-3.
A slight dispute occurred over the
winning run when two Zetes ended
up on third base. The run counted,
however, since it was scored before
the final out at third.
There will be a meeting of the
Board of Managers tomorrow in
Room 352 of the Encina Gym.

The Stanford mansion in Washing
ton is now the property of the Washi
ngton Club, and is occupied by
ocal women.

In these sad days of tire rationing
drivers who burn up the road soon
will be walking on it.
