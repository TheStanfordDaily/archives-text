# Help Not Hinder

[T IS only human nature for
people to follow the fire en
gines—or even to try and beat
.he engines to the fire. Stanford
students have proven them
selves to be no exception to this
•statement.
Yesterday the Stanford fire
iepartment was attempting to
extinguish one of the toughest
grass fires they have faced this
quarter. The fire was spread
out and hence the fire depart
nent found themselves trying to
rover a wide area. But they
ound their task even more dif
'icult because of the fact that
students and other spectators
nad parked their cars and bi
cycles all over the two roads
eading to the scene of the fire.
The firemen had just about
extinguished the first fire when
mother alarm came in. By the
'ime the fire trucks had thread
ed their way in and around the
/arious parked vehicles, very
valuable time had been lost. It
ater turned out that the alarm
vas false, but had it been real,
he time lost by the firemen in
getting away from spectator-in
curred traffic jams would have
-neant perhaps a brush fire that
rould have spread for 30 miles
■>r more.
Another thing which irks the
:ire department is that campus
drivers are not observing the
rule that when a siren blows all
vehicles must pull over to the
side of the road and wait until
'he emergency car passes.
The fire department is main
tained for your protection, but
you can't have that protection
unless you give the fire depart
ment your co-operation. You
can help by not hindering. —
