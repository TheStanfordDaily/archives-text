r jTHAT old "no rest for the weary"
gag seems to be running vicious
ly true to form these hot summer
days.
Just when it looks like the United
Nations are beginning to get things
under some kind of control down in
Egypt Mr. Hitler springs the big and
long-awaited offensive against our
Russian friends.
In a way, of course, the Russian
drive was to he expected. It is
necessary that Adolf get the stub
born Soviet out of the way in or
der to get the treasure of oil which
lies in the Caucasus. In order to
get a strangle-hold upon the east
ern Mediterranean the Russians
are one of the two large elements
which must be blotted out. Fur
thermore, with the Reds in the
way, it would be impossible—well,
at least very difficult—for Hitler's
brown legions to continue into
Syria, Iraq, Iran, and India.
To launch the present offensive
the irritating stronghold of Sevasto
pol had to be put out of the war.
That is why, I think, no big push has
been seen before this time. Hitler
had to concentrate too much of his
strength on the Crimea in order to
erase Red grips upon Sevastopol
(and Kursk) before he could again
begin to bore into the heart of Rus
sia proper. With his Crimean objec
tives accomplished, the ex-corporal
is now throwing full weight against
the Russians.
Between Kharkov (about 200 miles
due north of the Crimea) and Orel
(about 175 miles due south of Mos
cow) Hitler has managed to breach
a large hole in Russian defenses.
The railway terminal of Voronezh—
the key city on the Rostov-Moscow
line—has apparently been captured.
The Germans seem to have control
of an 80- or 100-mile stretch of the
River Don just west of Voronezh.
*r * *
from the von Eeck-
Timoshenko front seem to indi
cate that the Reds are making un
important counter-attacks to the
south of the Nazi spearhead, but
these are obviously only to divert the
Germans and in this the Soviet
counter-drives have not visibly suc
ceeded.
If—and this is a big "if" because
the Russians are not at all happy
about the Nazis walking all over
their land and get tougher and
tougher as the Germans get closer
and closer to whipping them—if the
Nazis succeed in sustaining the mo
mentum of this drive they will prob
ably head directly toward the town
of Povorino, after which they must
keep going another hundred or so
miles in order to reach the Volga
River. Once at the Volga, the Ger
mans are in a very good position.
They can cut off the Russian oil
barges which travel up the Volga
from the great oil center on the Cas
pian Sea, Astrakhan, to northern
Russia and then gradually filter
down along the Volga to seize the
great new industrial city of Stalin
grad and then perhaps Astrakhan
itself.
But the Germans still have a lot
of fighting to do before they reach
the Volga. There are a lot of Rus
sians for the Germans to run over, a
lot of ground for the Nazis to cover,
and while the Russians may not have
the man-to-man fire-power of the
Germans, they are defending a land
which they know and which they
love.
It is a bloody mess down there in
southern Russia — about that there
can be no doubt. But it is a mess
of which the Russians can be proud.
I am no Bolshevik-lover; I sing no
paeans of praise for a system which,
in my opinion, can develop only into
a totalitarian dictatorship. But brave
men. motivated and organized by the
elemental necessity of caring for
their own soil and family. I must
salute. The Russians, notwithstand
ing Communist industrialization, are
a simple people with roots deep in

| the earth. They recognize that many
of themselves must die and do not
shrink from this reality. Perhaps
Americans, sophisticated and root
less, will one day come to the same
realization. The Japs are in the
Aleutians.

Just when it looks like the United
Nations are beginning to get things
under some kind of control down in
Egypt Mr. Hitler springs the big and
long-awaited offensive against our
Russian friends.
In a way, of course, the Russian
drive was to he expected. It is
necessary that Adolf get the stub
born Soviet out of the way in or
der to get the treasure of oil which
lies in the Caucasus. In order to
get a strangle-hold upon the east
ern Mediterranean the Russians
are one of the two large elements
which must be blotted out. Fur
thermore, with the Reds in the
way, it would be impossible—well,
at least very difficult—for Hitler's
brown legions to continue into
Syria, Iraq, Iran, and India.
To launch the present offensive
the irritating stronghold of Sevasto
pol had to be put out of the war.
That is why, I think, no big push has
been seen before this time. Hitler
had to concentrate too much of his
strength on the Crimea in order to
erase Red grips upon Sevastopol
(and Kursk) before he could again
begin to bore into the heart of Rus
sia proper. With his Crimean objec
tives accomplished, the ex-corporal
is now throwing full weight against
the Russians.
Between Kharkov (about 200 miles
due north of the Crimea) and Orel
(about 175 miles due south of Mos
cow) Hitler has managed to breach
a large hole in Russian defenses.
The railway terminal of Voronezh—
the key city on the Rostov-Moscow
line—has apparently been captured.
The Germans seem to have control
of an 80- or 100-mile stretch of the
River Don just west of Voronezh.

from the von Eeck-
Timoshenko front seem to indi
cate that the Reds are making un
important counter-attacks to the
south of the Nazi spearhead, but
these are obviously only to divert the
Germans and in this the Soviet
counter-drives have not visibly suc
ceeded.
If—and this is a big "if" because
the Russians are not at all happy
about the Nazis walking all over
their land and get tougher and
tougher as the Germans get closer
and closer to whipping them—if the
Nazis succeed in sustaining the mo
mentum of this drive they will prob
ably head directly toward the town
of Povorino, after which they must
keep going another hundred or so
miles in order to reach the Volga
River. Once at the Volga, the Ger
mans are in a very good position.
They can cut off the Russian oil
barges which travel up the Volga
from the great oil center on the Cas
pian Sea, Astrakhan, to northern
Russia and then gradually filter
down along the Volga to seize the
great new industrial city of Stalin
grad and then perhaps Astrakhan
itself.

these are obviously only to divert the
Germans and in this the Soviet
counter-drives have not visibly suc
ceeded.
If—and this is a big "if" because
the Russians are not at all happy
about the Nazis walking all over
their land and get tougher and
tougher as the Germans get closer
and closer to whipping them—if the
Nazis succeed in sustaining the mo
mentum of this drive they will prob
ably head directly toward the town
of Povorino, after which they must
keep going another hundred or so
miles in order to reach the Volga
River. Once at the Volga, the Ger
mans are in a very good position.
They can cut off the Russian oil
barges which travel up the Volga
from the great oil center on the Cas
pian Sea, Astrakhan, to northern
Russia and then gradually filter
down along the Volga to seize the
great new industrial city of Stalin
grad and then perhaps Astrakhan
itself.
But the Germans still have a lot
of fighting to do before they reach
the Volga. There are a lot of Rus
sians for the Germans to run over, a
lot of ground for the Nazis to cover,
and while the Russians may not have
the man-to-man fire-power of the
Germans, they are defending a land
which they know and which they
love.
It is a bloody mess down there in
southern Russia — about that there
can be no doubt. But it is a mess
of which the Russians can be proud.
I am no Bolshevik-lover; I sing no
paeans of praise for a system which,
in my opinion, can develop only into
a totalitarian dictatorship. But brave
men. motivated and organized by the
elemental necessity of caring for
their own soil and family. I must
salute. The Russians, notwithstand
ing Communist industrialization, are
a simple people with roots deep in

of themselves must die and do not
shrink from this reality. Perhaps
Americans, sophisticated and root
less, will one day come to the same
realization. The Japs are in the

r jTHAT old "no rest for the weary"
gag seems to be running vicious
ly true to form these hot summer
days.
Just when it looks like the United
Nations are beginning to get things
under some kind of control down in
Egypt Mr. Hitler springs the big and
long-awaited offensive against our
Russian friends.
In a way, of course, the Russian
drive was to he expected. It is
necessary that Adolf get the stub
born Soviet out of the way in or
der to get the treasure of oil which
lies in the Caucasus. In order to
get a strangle-hold upon the east
ern Mediterranean the Russians
are one of the two large elements
which must be blotted out. Fur
thermore, with the Reds in the
way, it would be impossible—well,
at least very difficult—for Hitler's
brown legions to continue into
Syria, Iraq, Iran, and India.
To launch the present offensive
the irritating stronghold of Sevasto
pol had to be put out of the war.
That is why, I think, no big push has
been seen before this time. Hitler
had to concentrate too much of his
strength on the Crimea in order to
erase Red grips upon Sevastopol
(and Kursk) before he could again
begin to bore into the heart of Rus
sia proper. With his Crimean objec
tives accomplished, the ex-corporal
is now throwing full weight against
the Russians.
Between Kharkov (about 200 miles
due north of the Crimea) and Orel
(about 175 miles due south of Mos
cow) Hitler has managed to breach
a large hole in Russian defenses.
The railway terminal of Voronezh—
the key city on the Rostov-Moscow
line—has apparently been captured.
The Germans seem to have control
of an 80- or 100-mile stretch of the
River Don just west of Voronezh.
