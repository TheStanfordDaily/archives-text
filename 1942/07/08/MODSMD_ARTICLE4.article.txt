# Lab to Test Men's Fitness
## 
### 
In a further study of the physical
fitness of the average man-on-cam
pus, the Stanford Exercise Labora
tory will begin physiological tests
next week on 100 subjects chosen at
random from the student body.
Formerly as many as 450 men were
used in the old physical fitness tests
involving much more fatiguing mus
cular activity than those to be used
next week.
The exercise laboratory is one of
several research groups, backed by
the National Research Council, now
engaged in gathering information for
use in the armed services.
The test, developed by Dr. Craig
Taylor, is as follows: the subject
steps up and down on a wooden
block approximately 60 times in two
minutes. This is equivalent to nor
mal stair-climbing. During this
procedure the heart rate is being re
corded by electrodes strapped on the
subject's chest. After the stepping
exercise is completed the blood
pressure is recorded, also the length
of time the subject can hold his
breath. This simple test is repeated
in one week at the same time of day.
In order to allay fears of me
dieval torture devices, interrupted
schedule, etc., the following points
were included in the letters of noti
fication which were mailed yester
day:
(1) Two visits to the laboratory of
40 minutes each;
(2) No particular preparation;
(3) Each subject will receive $1.50
for services;
(4) Treadmill tests will not be
given;
(5) No direct connection with
Army, Navy, or Marine recruiting.
The selected subject must appear
on schedule, have an okay from the
Men's Health Service, and be we
tween the ages of 18-28.
