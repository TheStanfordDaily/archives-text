# Ex-com Again Bans Dances Off Campus
## 
### DON SELBY 
Facing the problem of ofT-campus
social functions once again. Ex Com
mittee decided last night that "con
sidering good taste, safety, and ex
pense, social functions given by or
ganizations or groups of organiza
tions shall be held only on the cam
pus."
The action was taken because the
former Ex Committee ruling on this
subject, which read just as this one
does, expired with the end of Spring
Quarter.
Following presentation of the idea
in yesterday's Daily and by John
Hernan and Fred Maguire, origina
tors of the proposal, at the meeting
last night, it was decided to show
moving pictures of Stanford's foot
ball and basketball games of the last
two seasons in conjunction with the
regular Sunday movies.
GRID FILMS TO SHOW
The first athletic film, shots of the
Stanford-Nebraska Rose Bowl game
on January 1, 1941, will be shown
this Sunday. Ed Stamm, student
body president, reported that a let
ter had been written to Basketball
Coach Everett Dean requesting the
use of his films of the N.C.A.A. play
offs in Kansas City this year.
With Dick Rabbett as the head.
Speaker Service, a branch of the
Stanford War Board, was named as
the group which will aid the Alumni
Association in compiling a complete
record of Stanford men in the serv
ice.
POOL KEPT OPEN
The main function of Rabbett and
Speaker Service representatives will
be to place questionnaires in living
and eating groups and in the hands
of off-campus residents in order that
fraternities, eating clubs, and indi
viduals may help make the service
record more complete.
It was decided that the Women's
pool will be kept open every Satur
day from 3 to 5 p.m. at A.S.S.U. ex
pense because of the success of last
Saturday's program.
Dates granted: Cardinal's Scaven
ger Hunt. July 17; A.S.S.U. Sunday
movies, July 26; Co-op House din
ner dance, July 31; and Casa Gra
nada USO party, July 31.
