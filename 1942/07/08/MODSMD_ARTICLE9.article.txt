# India Desires Freedom, Peace
## 
### 
"America is more and more becom
ing the shield and support of the
crusade for democracy, and as it ac
cepts the lead in the fighting, it must
also take the moral leadership," ac
cording to Dr. Syud Hossain, noted
authority on foreign affairs who
spoke before a large Tuesday Series
audience last night.
"India wants her freedom!" Dr.
Hossain stressed. She hates Japanese
and Nazi brutality, but she feels no
more kindly toward British impe
rialism, according to the lecturer.
LOOKS TO AMERICA
In Dr. Hossain's opinion, it is
American participation in this war
which is lining up India on the
United Nations' side; India looks to
America to see to it that there will
be no return to the pre-war status
quo.
"America has promised that the
peace will be a world-wide peace
based on democratic principles; In
dia depends on the United States'
clean record in Asia to insure her
fair treatment," Dr. Hossain stated.
Dr. Hossain squelched accusations
that India was pro-Axis, pointing
out that India had denounced Jap
aggression in Manchuria in 1931, and
had imposed a boycott on Japan
while England and the United States
were still playing ball with her.
"There is not a single element in
India which sympathizes with the
Axis. Japan forfeited the esteem of
Asia by copying the very European
imperialism which the East hates,"
he stressed.
FREEDOM NOW
Commenting on Sir Stafford
Cripps' proposals to give India her
freedom after the war. Dr. Hossain
asked. "Why not freedom now? If
we are not ready for self-govern
ment now, we shall be no more so
after the war. If England sets her
self up as the champion of democ
racy, why doesn't she give democracy
to India, to one-fifth of the human
race?"
To England's demand that the de
fense of India be in English hands
exclusively, Dr. Hossain said India's
answer was; "If we are good enough
to die for this cause, we should be
good enough to have some voice in
the direction of our effort."

self up as the champion of democ
racy, why doesn't she give democracy
to India, to one-fifth of the human
race?"
To England's demand that the de
fense of India be in English hands
exclusively, Dr. Hossain said India's
answer was; "If we are good enough
to die for this cause, we should be
good enough to have some voice in
the direction of our effort."
"America is more and more becom
ing the shield and support of the
crusade for democracy, and as it ac
cepts the lead in the fighting, it must
also take the moral leadership," ac
cording to Dr. Syud Hossain, noted
authority on foreign affairs who
spoke before a large Tuesday Series
audience last night.
"India wants her freedom!" Dr.
Hossain stressed. She hates Japanese
and Nazi brutality, but she feels no
more kindly toward British impe
rialism, according to the lecturer.
LOOKS TO AMERICA
In Dr. Hossain's opinion, it is
American participation in this war
which is lining up India on the
United Nations' side; India looks to
America to see to it that there will
be no return to the pre-war status
quo.
"America has promised that the
peace will be a world-wide peace
based on democratic principles; In
dia depends on the United States'
clean record in Asia to insure her
fair treatment," Dr. Hossain stated.
Dr. Hossain squelched accusations
that India was pro-Axis, pointing
out that India had denounced Jap
aggression in Manchuria in 1931, and
had imposed a boycott on Japan
while England and the United States
were still playing ball with her.
"There is not a single element in
India which sympathizes with the
Axis. Japan forfeited the esteem of
Asia by copying the very European
imperialism which the East hates,"
he stressed.
FREEDOM NOW
Commenting on Sir Stafford
Cripps' proposals to give India her
freedom after the war. Dr. Hossain
asked. "Why not freedom now? If
we are not ready for self-govern
ment now, we shall be no more so
after the war. If England sets her
self up as the champion of democ
racy, why doesn't she give democracy
to India, to one-fifth of the human
race?"
