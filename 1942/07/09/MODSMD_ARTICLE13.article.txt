# Doctor MacFarlane Reports On Nation's Women's Army
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Dr. Jean Macfarlane is back from Washington, and with her she brought
the inside story of Uncle Sam's new women's army.
"The days when war was exclusively a man's proposition are fast fad
ing."' she remarked, shoving aside papers from her Projective Techniques
class. "In a few months America will command 25.000 female soldiers.
They will be on a $21 monthly pay- ♦

roll, stationed at Fort Ord and the
rest, and will be subject to transfer
anywhere on the globe."
SERVES WITH PSYCHIATRISTS
In the capital Dr. Macfarlane
served in the capacity of Expert
Consultant on a board of 18 psy
chiatrists in whose hands rested the
fate of applicants for the women's
"corps elite." The "corps elite" will
comprise appointees to the women's
first officer training station at Des
Moines, which parallels West Point
and Annapolis.
In the bedlam that is wartime
Washington and where Dr. Macfar
lane found the "whole bunch work
ing terrifically," the psychologists
and Army officials subjected the ap
plications for women's officer train
ing to a final psychological analysis.
In many cases, the board did not
hesitate to consult with the original
interviewers back in the area head
quarters.

Dr. Macfarlane herself shuttled
back to Salt Lake City, nerve cen
ter of the 9th Corps Area, to per
sonally discuss questionable appli
cations with the interviewer and to
do much of the preliminary inter
viewing directly.
Here, she found women eager to
forsake an $8,000 income and the se
curity of civilian life to get the war
over in a hurry and to bring their
men back soon.
The Women's Auxiliary Corps,
which will soon be enlarged to 80,000,
is functioning to alleviate the short
age of the Army's communications
and clerical staff, caused by the
swelling demand for larger combat
ant units.

"Woman replacements are proving
an unprecedented boon, as it is dis
covered that they even excel in
men's positions in handling omni
present red tape and communica
tions," remarked Dr. Macfarlane.
"Mrs. Oveta Hobby, director of the
auxiliary, is doing a level-headed

job. She has lots on the ball. Time-
Life praised her recently, and put
me down for furthering the com
pliment."
Saying this, Dr. Macfarlane drew
in her papers and resumed her aca
demic work. She is regularly on the
U.C. faculty and is teaching her sec
ond summer session here.
