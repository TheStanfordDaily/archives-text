# Rubber Drive In Final Stage
## 
### 
With only two more days to go,
Stanford will make a last effort to
collect all available scrap rubber in
a final drive today and tomorrow.
This afternoon coast gasoline sta
tions will close while attendants
make a house-to-house search for
scrap rubber to boost collections. It
is estimated that some 30.000 service
station operators will devote their
time from noon to 6 p.m. in a last
minute effort to boost stockpiles.
All major oil companies and inde
pedent stations were expected to co
operate in the plan.
Bill Hutchinson, conservation
chairman, announced last night that
a meeting of all the fraternities
would be held to make final plans for
fraternity collections. Residents of
dormitories are requested to see
their respresentative in regard to
collections.
It is hoped that by tomorrow all
Stanford residents will have co-op
erated in turning in all their old
scrap rubber.
Tomorrow will be declared "rub
ber day" by proclamations of mayors
of some major west coast cities, who
are to ask every citizen to devote at
least two hours of the day to the
quest for discarded rubber.

Extra pressure in tires this year
may mean extra miles next year.
