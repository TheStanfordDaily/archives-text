## ON THE HORNS OF DILAPIDATION, PERHAPS? 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford has a new football coach, four "sure to be played" games,
two in Kezar Stadium, one at South Bend, and one at Los Angeles. But
valuable parts of the team, especially quarterbacks, are fast drifting into
the great beyondâ€”beyond the 8-ball.
Frankie Albert has been graduated, but Ray Hammett and A1 Cole, two
top-notchers, were going to Jill the all-American's place.

Hammett may be inducted into
the Army before the summer is over,
and Cole is trying his best to get
into the Navy Air Corps. We are
somehow sans quarters.
Now for halfbacks.
Eric "Hoot" Armstrong writes
from Vancouver that he is reaping
a "hatful" at a defense shipyard.
That could keep him there, but we
hope different. Jim Pettit flashy
soph runner, is also doubtful. On
rumor, wc don't know how flimsy,
the grapevine says Pettit is looking
into the Air Corps business.
Hank Norberg, Indian standy at
left end, will be inducted into the
army July 22.
Thankfully, the remainder of the
squad is fairly well set with V-7,
et al.
But it isn't too wonderful a situa
tion.
