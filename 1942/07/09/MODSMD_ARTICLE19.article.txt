Louisiana State University re
fused Stanford's challenge to play
off the team He in the N.C.A.A.
golf championships at South Bend.
Another thing on that golf tourna
ment.
The qualifying rounds count for
the medal. Earl Stewart, L.S.U. de
fending champion and medalist,
could have gone for the medal again,
but since he was automatically quali
fied regardless erf his score, he went
out on the course free and easy—no
pressure.
He scorched the Chain o' Lakes
course with a 141, clipping one
stroke off his last year's record—
142. Had Stewart been shooting
for the medal again it is doubtful
in our minds that he would have
carded 141, because in former
pressure matches this year he has
been unable to hit his old stride.

Thanks to the "fan" who wrote in
to tell us that The. Daily miffed
Frank Tatum. Tatum is not N.C.A.A.
medalist, but the N.C.AA. individual
champion. Dick Haskell of North
western is this year's medalist.
