# Twenty Fires This Quarter
## 
### 
Since the first day of instruction
for Stanford's Summer Quarter. June
19, there has been over one fire per
school day. These fires have burned
over 45 acres of grassland, and in
two cases destroyed building prop
erty. These startling facts were an
nounced to the Daily yesterday by
Fire Chief Arden Hatley along with
his almost "dependable" report of a
fire yesterday near the isolation hos
pital which destroyed half an acre
of grass.
Most spectacular of this series of
blazes was the fire on July 7 which
burned 30 acres of vetch on the
north side of the R.O.T.C. stables.
This fire purportedly was set by
children after they were ordered to
leave the fire-hazard area earlier in
the day.
Growing sentiment against the
outbreak and continuance of such
fires was echoed by Daily Assistant
Managing Editor Mike Kresge in an
editorial published yesterday.
