# Do You Want Your Garden Ruined?

rN CASE you didn't know it,
1 yesterday was Carless Wed
nesday. That isn't supposed to
be merely a name of a day in
the week. It is a day lor Stanford
students to conserve the vital
rubber and gasoline they would
ase in their cars, which logically
shouldn't be used anyway.
There is always an answer
from those persistent violators
on Carless Wednesday. "What
about the shoe leather I use
talking to classes?" Or "These
are my tires, why shouldn't I
use them as. I please?" Or "I'm
just too lazy."
All we need is that kind of at
titude from 130,000,000 other
citizens and we'll be chasing
short, slant-eyed Orientals out
Df our backyards for years to
comes.
