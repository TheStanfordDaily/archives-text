".\"N TOT with a sailor," and the
IN phone banged down as
Susan Merryweather, '43, turn
ed down a request for a blind
date for the third time that week.
'Why don't they realize that we
just aren't the type," she mut
tered to her questioning room
mate.
"But, Susie," her roomie said
ntimately, "what's wrong with
a sailor? Your brother is in the
and your father fought
overseas."
"You don't understand, Caro
line (Caroline McSmutt). My
brother and father are different.
I just don't think I should go out
with sailors."
So Susan Merryweather goes
happily on her way knowing
she ie contributing her
share for victory by knitting
heels for sox she knows she will
never finish. She is the same
girl you see smoking in the
Quad. She is one of those girls
who is still wearing a rubber
girdle. She is one of the gang
who doesn't have to do any
thing to help the men in service
because everyone else is taking
care of them.
There are a lot of Susie Merry
weathers doing their share to
tear down the good work of the
'JSO. Why shouldn't girls of
college age go out with service
men? Most of the soldiers, sail
ors, and marines are college
graduates or fellows who are
planning to go back to college
after the war.
One night on a date with one
of these men would do much
toward raising their morale. It
might also change their opinion
of the girls "who go to that
country club in Palo Alto."
