VE7ITH a "Now we're in college,
let's be collegiate" attitude a
number of Encinamen Tuesday night
"demonstrated" out front.
As this is being written there is
talk of a "bigger and better brawl"
being staged. We are told that no
tices call all frosh to gather before
Encina at 10 Wednesday evening, to

have it around with
the boys who caus
ed the trouble.
We hope that this
will not occur, and
we don't think that
we are being poor
sports in saying

this. There is nothing better than
Stanford Spirit, and it is admittedly
a little hard to evince this with no
football games or rallies, but it will
not be gained through the proposed
brawl.

Last year sadness was brought to j
this school through the untimely
death of one of our students, and all
because the frosh with the slogan
"Jive with '45," thought it smart to
throw a big demonstration on the
Row.
If there is too much fervor in the
Encinamen to escape through normal i
channels, then perhaps a little more
extensive participation in intra
murals might be suggested.
Stanford has never been a place
for frosh-soph rivalries. Because
things are done in the movies has
never seemed good enough cause to
introduce them here. By all means j
let the frosh have class spirit, but j
make sure that at the same time it is !
Stanford spirit.
