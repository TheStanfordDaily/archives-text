# KNOW ANY ARSONISTS?
## 
### 
JF YOU have said to yourself, upon
hearing the fire sirens wail, there
have been an unduly large number
of fires hereabout lately, you're cor
rect.
Whether it is the heat wave, brok
en glass, coincidence, or plain old
arson, nobody knows. However, the
fires that have occurred recently
have led to speculation about their
origins.
The next time you spot a grass
fire, keep your eyes open for anyone
behaving suspiciously. If you see
kids in a field and a fire springs up,
don't be afraid to report it.
If these fires are not acts of God,
it is certainly worth while trying to
apprehend the arsonist. Try being a
self-styled Dick Tracy or Red Ryder
for the next few weeks. You might
even get a medal.
