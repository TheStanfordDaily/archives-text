# Dr. Mears Reports Optimistic Outlook for Shipping Problem
## 
### 
Professor Eliot G. Mears, associate director of the War Shipping Ad
ministration. returned to the campus this week optimistic about the recent
improvements in the war shipping problem.
"There has been a definite improvement in the shipping situation since
the WSB was created in February," Dr. Mears stated. "We hope that
with the continued work of the - —

board, co-ordination among Wash
ington agencies dealing with war
time ocean commerce will be even
better in the future," he added.
SHIPPING CO ORDINATOR
Dr. Mears, as chief of the Pacific
section of the WSB, must co-ordinate
the movements of all vessels of all
the Allied nations operating on the
Pacific front. Dr. Mears' office deals
with the starting times and routes of
cargo ships from ports scattered over
two-fifths of the world's area — the
coastlines of North, Central, and
South America, Australia, and the
Pacific islands, and the remaining
Allied-controlled shores of Asia.
After working for three months on
the board. Dr. Mears was granted
temporary leave to direct Stanford's
Summer Quarter, a job which he
has held for the past 11 years. Since
most of the preliminary work on
this year's Summer Quarter had
been done by Dr. Mears, it was felt
that he should be here at least some
of the time to supervise the actual
carrying out of the program.
GEOGRAPHY PROFESSOR
The professor will probably be on
the Farm only for the month of
July, although he may be allowed to
stay into August. "I may be called
back any time they need me," Dr.
Mears stated.
In addition to teaching a class and
directing Summer Quarter, Dr.
Mears is conducting investigations in
conjunction with his work on the
WSB
Dr. Mears. as professor of geogra
phy and international trade at Stan
ford, has been an authority on Pa
cific relations for nearly 20 years.
