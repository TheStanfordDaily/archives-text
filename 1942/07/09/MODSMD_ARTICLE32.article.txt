# Hall Undergoes Many Changes
## 
### J. J. WATERHOUSE 
Freshman students entering En
cina Hall for the first time in Septem
ber, will find a much different build
ing from the one that has greeted
frosh for so many years. This will
be the result of a $30,000 project de
signed to improve the livability of
the oldest hall on campus.
The project divides itself in three
parts, as follows:
1. Complete refurnishing and re
construction of 27 rooms.
2. Modernization of the clubroom
(formerly known as the lobby).
3. Work on the hallways.
"Not swank, but modern and mas
culine," is how Stanley Sharp, di
rector of men's residences, describes
the new rooms.
COMPLETELY REBUILT
"We have started from the bottom
up, and entirely rebuilt the rooms,"
he continued. "We have tried to
keep in mind not only the comfort
of the student, but also want to in
crease his opportunity for study."
Most of the new rooms are on the
third and fourth floors of the east
wing. Included in the new furnish
ings will be new desks, straight
chairs, easy chairs, beds, and mat
tresses. The old softwood floors will
be replaced by hardwood; marble
washstands, which have served for
more than 50 years, will give way to
modern basins; the naked light
globe hanging from the ceiling will
evolve into a central fixture, with
floor outlets placed around the base
boards.
ROOMS SPLIT
New built-in wardrobe closets will
divide the rooms into two sections, a
sleeping room and a study room.
The closets will not only serve to
j give increased storage space, but will
I also make it possible for one student
to sleep, while the other studies, ac
cording to Dr. Sharp.
Clubroom changes include the
j addition of new Charles of London
| type chairs, reupholstering of all the
j old sofas, fluorescent lighting fix
! tures, ash trays, a new trophy case,
j and an entire new paint job.
The doors, which are being placed
' in the hallways, will not only im
{ prove the appearance, but also sub
! due the Hall noises, according to Dr.
Sharp.

ings will be new desks, straight
chairs, easy chairs, beds, and mat
tresses. The old softwood floors will
be replaced by hardwood; marble
washstands, which have served for
more than 50 years, will give way to
modern basins; the naked light
globe hanging from the ceiling will
evolve into a central fixture, with
floor outlets placed around the base
boards.
ROOMS SPLIT
New built-in wardrobe closets will
divide the rooms into two sections, a
sleeping room and a study room.
The closets will not only serve to
j give increased storage space, but will
I also make it possible for one student
to sleep, while the other studies, ac
cording to Dr. Sharp.
Clubroom changes include the
j addition of new Charles of London
| type chairs, reupholstering of all the
j old sofas, fluorescent lighting fix
! tures, ash trays, a new trophy case,
j and an entire new paint job.
The doors, which are being placed
' in the hallways, will not only im
{ prove the appearance, but also sub
! due the Hall noises, according to Dr.
Sharp.
Freshman students entering En
cina Hall for the first time in Septem
ber, will find a much different build
ing from the one that has greeted
frosh for so many years. This will
be the result of a $30,000 project de
signed to improve the livability of
the oldest hall on campus.
The project divides itself in three
parts, as follows:
1. Complete refurnishing and re
construction of 27 rooms.
2. Modernization of the clubroom
(formerly known as the lobby).
3. Work on the hallways.
"Not swank, but modern and mas
culine," is how Stanley Sharp, di
rector of men's residences, describes
the new rooms.
COMPLETELY REBUILT
"We have started from the bottom
up, and entirely rebuilt the rooms,"
he continued. "We have tried to
keep in mind not only the comfort
of the student, but also want to in
crease his opportunity for study."
Most of the new rooms are on the
third and fourth floors of the east
wing. Included in the new furnish
ings will be new desks, straight
chairs, easy chairs, beds, and mat
tresses. The old softwood floors will
