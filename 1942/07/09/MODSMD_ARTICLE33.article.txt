# Farm 'Carless' Called Success
## 
### 
"Carless Wednesday was a success,
and I believe that the majority of
students showed a great deal of co
operation with the movement by not
driving their cars to classes yester
day," commented Stanley Wilson,
chairman of Carless Wednesdays.
"There were not as many cars park
ed around the Libe or the Union, and
I believe the students are trying to
co-operate with the President's plea
to conserve rubber."
Wilson emphasizes the fact that
the Carless Wednesday program is
not a weekly affair but that the con
servation program should be con
tinued through the Summer Quarter.
"It should not be necessary to re
mind the students that the conser
vation program should be continued
throughout the whole school year.
Carless Wednesdays are only an
added emphasis on the conservation
program," Wilson said.
Wilson pointed out that there were
still a number of cars on the campus
but that the program of "co-opera
tive driving" doubled up the number
of passengers in each car, and traffic
to and from the university was not
as heavy as usual.
"We still have a number of stu
dents on the campus that drive their
cars when they don't have to. We
placed mimeographed sheets on the
windshields of cars that were parked
around the campus asking them why
they drove their cars.
Next week we plan to print "stay
under 40" stickers and place them
on all cars to emphasize conserva
tion of tires and rubber," Wilson
said.
Harvard is the most richly en
dowed American university.
