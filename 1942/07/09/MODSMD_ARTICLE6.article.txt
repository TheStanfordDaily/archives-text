# Yesterday's Stamp Sales Boom To New Summer High of $1,110
## Nine Bonds Sold as Campus Goes All-out to Buy Reconnaissance Cars 
### 
"War stamp sales yesterday netted $1,110.50, the largest receipts (his
quarter. With the total sales of Summer Quarter reaching 52.870.25, it is
possible to see that people on the campus are aware of the government's
need for financial backing and therefore nearly everyone is supporting the
War Funds Drive," said Nancy Schermerhorn, the head of the War Funds
division of the Stanford War Board. â™¦

Nine bonds were sold yesterday on
campus. Booths brought in a total
of $853.75.
GOOD ORGANIZATION
Miss Schermerhorn remarked that
"the committee heads and their
committees have done an amazing
job of organizing all living groups
and urging all those who missed the
booths on campus to co-operate in
this drive by buying stamps and
bonds."
The heads of the committees are
Bill Levers at Toyon, Carl Living
ston at Encina, Eleanor Lindholm at
Lagunita for all women's groups, and
Bob Hampton, who is the head of
fraternity sales.
Last quarter the campus bought
enough war stamps to pay for 14
jeeps. This quarter the War Funds
Committee is aiming at buying the
same number of reconnaissance cars,
each of which costs twice as much
as a jeep.
BOUGHT THREE CARS
Although plans are not yet definite,
a reconnaissance car may be chris
tened on campus next week. To
date, this quarter's stamp receipts
are almost equal to the price of three
reconnaissance cars.
The 84 per cent average sales in
men's living groups exceeded sales
in women's living groups by 10 per
cent. Both men's halls and the Row
turned in the same average.
Three fraternities, Chi Psi, Fiji,
and Phi Psi, hit 100 per cent, and
Toyon followed with 90 per cent.
Encina was low in men's groups with
78 per cent.

In Lagunita, Eucalypto led all the
other casas with 94 per cent. Adelfa
bought 90 per cent, Naranja 80 per
cent, Olivo 76 per cent, Magnolia 68
