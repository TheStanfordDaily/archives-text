# Football Films To Play Sunday
## Sadler Series Bills Paul Robeson Movie 
### 
The Stanford-Nebraska Rose Bowl
pictures, a new serial, "Chandu the
Magician," a cartoon, and the English
movie sensation. "Sanders of the
River" starring Paul Robeson, con
stitute the Nancy Haskins bill for
the second in the Summer Quarter
series of Sunday movies.
Not in Memorial Hall as last quar
ter, but in the Education Auditor
ium, the program will begin at 7:15
Sunday evening, admission 20 cents.
Miss Haskins' arrangement for the
1941 Rose Bowl pictures will meet a
persistent student demand of a yeat*
and a half's standing. The B.A.C.
colored movies have been exhibited
to enthusiastic crowds all over the
United States, but have not been
shown on campus since January,
1941.
Proposed by The Stanford Daily,
their showing on the Sunday Series
was approved by Excom Tuesday
night, and other athletic pictures will
probably follow in subsequent
weeks.
'"Sanders of the River'' was filmed
in Africa following the Korda expe
dition into the Congo, and was the
most elaborate British location pic
ture ever filmed at that date. The
authentic African background of
hostile natives and jungle beasts
took London by storm, as did the
singing of Paul Robeson, who plays
Bosambo, a reformed convict who
becomes chief of a tribe; and Toto
Wane, an old Negro hair-tonic sales
man. who plays the wild and woolly
King Mofalba.
