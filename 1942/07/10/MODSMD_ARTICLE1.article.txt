# Campus Grass Fires Cause Little Damage
## 
### 
Two small grass fires were start
ed on the campus yesterday, con
tinuing the streak of Summer
Quarter fires, which have averaged
over one fire per school day.
Neither of the fires caused much
damage.
The first fire was started near
the driveway of the Convalescent
Home, and the second started in
hack of the golf course some dis
tance from the nearest road.
It was not known how the fires
started, and there was no sign of
arson.
