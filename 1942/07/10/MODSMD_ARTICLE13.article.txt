"Only constant thought and con
stant planning by great numbers of
people can win the war and win the
peace that follows," said Dr. Ed
gar E. Robinson, executive head of
the history department, in an ad
dress to the "Win the Warâ€”Win the
Peace" Conference yesterday morn
ing at the Palace Hotel.
"Tlie defense of American dem
ocracy is no new task. We have been
in revolt against this dictatorship
from the beginning, and we have to
win the battle for our way of life
every day. The way we win the war
,will determine the future. It is the
way our people think and feel about
what they are doing. It is how they
act in war that will determine what
they can do in peace," he contin
ued.
Six national organizations met to
consider the problems of the war
and the peace. The conference rep
resents many colleges and univer
sities throughout the nation.
In conclusion, Dr. Robinson de
clared. "There are three reasons
why the armed democracy of the
United Nations will win this wars
There is man power. There is ma
chine power, and there is will
power."
