# Mural Hurlers Take Honors In Close Softball Contests
## 
### ZIP WALT 
Tight pitching marked the second round of Summer Quarter Softball
play yesterday as one-, two-, and two four-hit performances were turned
in by outstanding campus hurlers.
Coming back after a disheartening 17-0 defeat, the Pied Typers battled
the Rambling Wrecks from Page Mill Road hut dropped a 4-1 decision.

►Jim Pollard held the soldiers to four
hits, while the Typers got six off
Ellis Mahari and Ace Stovall. All but
one of the Ramblers' runs were un
earned, coming in the first, fourth
and seventh innings. The Typers'
run came in the fifth when Mike
Kresge singled to right, scoring
Saltay Sontag, who had singled to
left. Pollard beat out two well-placed
bunts along the first base line. Son
tag also collected two hits.
Mahan gave up but one hit in the
four innings he worked, the hit was
a sharp line drive to center scored
by George Tolman. The Pied Typ
ers made seven errors to the Ram
bling Wrecks' none.
WEIR AGAIN
Woody Weir continued his sensa
tional pitching for the Slave Drivers
by blanking the strong Socialists,
4-0. allowing but one hit. The Slaves
got two runs in each of the first two
innings—both on home runs. Frank
Wells and John Winterburn both
collected circuit blows with men on
board to spell defeat for the men
from the Educational Workshop.
John Bunn also looked good at bat
and in the field.
Over in League A, Harry Booth
definitely established himself as one
of the most capable chuckers in the
pennant chase as he set down the
Encina 1-B squad with two hits
while his Alpha Sig - Theta Chi
teammates staged first- and second
inning rallies to win, 8-2. Booth
handcuffed the frosh for the first five
innings, before he gave up his first
hit. He also batted in two runs with
a triple in the second inning after
Phil Rice led off with a homer.
O'REILLY'S FALL AGAIN
John Moeur lead the Alpha Sig-
Theta Chi hit parade with two sin
gles and scored three runs. The
winners displayed some flashy field
ing, led by Chuck Read on first base.
First-year Med School cut the
O'Reilly's 12-3. Jack McDonald ap
plied the anesthesia with a four-hit
masterpiece. Ex-varsity baseballers
Harry Parsons and Bill Cunha found
opposing hurler Emmett Laidlaw for
two hits apiece. Bob Berweek and
McDonald also looked good at the
k plate for the neophyte Kildares.
Th ree consecutive home runs by
the Biz Wigs Moiderers' Row were
the big factor in their 9-5 victory
over last year's champs, the Spar
Ducks. Tom Krueger, Marsh Weigel,
and Herb Bull opened the fourth
inning by clouting the ball for cir
cuit blows. Despite the work of
Lyle Reynolds and Ned Johns, the
Spar Ducks couldn't match the fast-
I playing of the grad school team.
32-3 (THAT'S CORRECT)
Oh yes, Encina 11-111 played their
Encina brethren from floors IV-V on
Diamond 5. Encina 11-111 won. The
score: 32-3 (correct). It was ter
rific as the Encina Torpedoes raced
around the bases, mainly due to the
heavy hitting of Dave Bynum, Jerry
j Stanley, and Fritz Grau. Barrett
Weber relaxed, letting IV-V ease
over three tallies.
Harry Shipkey, director of the
' Summer Quarter sports program,
i urged all teams to report at 4:45 in
] stead of 5 p.m. because too many
games have been called at 0 p.m.

McDonald also looked good at the
k plate for the neophyte Kildares.
Th ree consecutive home runs by
the Biz Wigs Moiderers' Row were
the big factor in their 9-5 victory
over last year's champs, the Spar
Ducks. Tom Krueger, Marsh Weigel,
and Herb Bull opened the fourth

Tight pitching marked the second round of Summer Quarter Softball
play yesterday as one-, two-, and two four-hit performances were turned
in by outstanding campus hurlers.
Coming back after a disheartening 17-0 defeat, the Pied Typers battled
the Rambling Wrecks from Page Mill Road hut dropped a 4-1 decision.

►Jim Pollard held the soldiers to four
hits, while the Typers got six off
Ellis Mahari and Ace Stovall. All but
one of the Ramblers' runs were un
earned, coming in the first, fourth
and seventh innings. The Typers'
run came in the fifth when Mike
Kresge singled to right, scoring
Saltay Sontag, who had singled to
left. Pollard beat out two well-placed
bunts along the first base line. Son
tag also collected two hits.
Mahan gave up but one hit in the
four innings he worked, the hit was
a sharp line drive to center scored
by George Tolman. The Pied Typ
ers made seven errors to the Ram
bling Wrecks' none.
WEIR AGAIN
Woody Weir continued his sensa
tional pitching for the Slave Drivers
by blanking the strong Socialists,
4-0. allowing but one hit. The Slaves
got two runs in each of the first two
innings—both on home runs. Frank
Wells and John Winterburn both
collected circuit blows with men on
board to spell defeat for the men
from the Educational Workshop.
John Bunn also looked good at bat
and in the field.
Over in League A, Harry Booth
definitely established himself as one
of the most capable chuckers in the
pennant chase as he set down the
Encina 1-B squad with two hits
while his Alpha Sig - Theta Chi
teammates staged first- and second
inning rallies to win, 8-2. Booth
handcuffed the frosh for the first five
innings, before he gave up his first
hit. He also batted in two runs with
a triple in the second inning after
Phil Rice led off with a homer.
O'REILLY'S FALL AGAIN
John Moeur lead the Alpha Sig-
Theta Chi hit parade with two sin
gles and scored three runs. The
winners displayed some flashy field
ing, led by Chuck Read on first base.
First-year Med School cut the
O'Reilly's 12-3. Jack McDonald ap
plied the anesthesia with a four-hit
masterpiece. Ex-varsity baseballers
Harry Parsons and Bill Cunha found
opposing hurler Emmett Laidlaw for
two hits apiece. Bob Berweek and
McDonald also looked good at the
k plate for the neophyte Kildares.
Th ree consecutive home runs by
the Biz Wigs Moiderers' Row were
the big factor in their 9-5 victory
over last year's champs, the Spar
Ducks. Tom Krueger, Marsh Weigel,
and Herb Bull opened the fourth
inning by clouting the ball for cir
cuit blows. Despite the work of
Lyle Reynolds and Ned Johns, the
Spar Ducks couldn't match the fast-
I playing of the grad school team.
32-3 (THAT'S CORRECT)
Oh yes, Encina 11-111 played their
Encina brethren from floors IV-V on
Diamond 5. Encina 11-111 won. The
score: 32-3 (correct). It was ter
rific as the Encina Torpedoes raced
around the bases, mainly due to the
heavy hitting of Dave Bynum, Jerry
j Stanley, and Fritz Grau. Barrett
Weber relaxed, letting IV-V ease
over three tallies.
