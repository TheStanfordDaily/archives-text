# Cocking Talks To Educators

"A great deal of planning is going
on to avoid some of the disasti'ous
results of the last war," said Dr.
Walter Cocking, member of the Fed
eral Security Agency, in an address
to the School of Education, yester
day noon.
'"One of the things the federal gov
ernment is most interested in is not
only planning for the winning of the
war but also for the post-war prob
lems of demobilization, public health,
and vocational rehabilitation," he
continued.
'"Both a democracy and a dicta
torship plan," Dr. Cocking said, "but
the chief difference is this: in a dic
tatorship the leader plans and the
people do or die. In a democracy we
reverse the process, and the people
collectively aid in the determination
of the government's policies. There
is the chief strength of the demo
cratic system. If people are not part
of the planning process, they may
not be so courageous when the time
comes to test the plans that have
been made."
Dr. Cocking emphasized the im
portant role that education will play
in regional planning. "Planning
never stops, and it calls for the best
talent from the nation's colleges and
universities. One of the great diffi
culties of regional planning is to edu
cate the people to accept their re
sponsibility and to do something
about it."
