# Stanford USO Starts Rolling
## 
### 
With nearly 150 soldiers swimming
every night in the men's pool, and
Casa Granada planning a party for
the Page Mill men on July 31, the
USO program for the summer is
swinging into shape.
'"All of the giris are co-operating
wonderfully, and every casa in La
gunita is going to hold some kind of
entertainment for service men,"
says Mary Lou Hyatt, campus USO
chairman.
Twenty-five soldiers from Page
Mill will take part in Casa Gra
nada's informal evening of dancing
and card-playing, from 8 to 12 on
the 31st.
The drama group on the campus
will give a variety show next Sun
day at Gilroy for soldiers stationed
nearby, and arrangements are in
progress to invite service men to
Tuesday Evening lectures, Sunday
movies, and church services.
