Harry Shipkey, football director,
| summer softball director, and in

make men out of mice or drown 'em

Burning oil swim—This consists of
! swimming under water till your
I lungs do an el foldo, then coming
j up to the surface for a quick breath
of air, then ducking down under
again and keep rolling.
That "quick" breath of air is be
cause you are pretending to swim
through burning oil as if thrown
from a sinking ship into oil-soaked,
flaming waters. That sends you,
j then—
Zooming aircraft dive—Starting on
I the three-foot board you take a small
dive into the pool. Then comes the
ten-foot board, and by the time
you're tied up with muscular mal
maneuvers, it's off the tower —and
brudder, if you've never been off the
tower, you've missed a high-flying
j thrill. Try it sometime, for ducks.
Round the rosy fadeout, which is
[ termed such because one naturally
fades out of any picture after beat
' ing his arms and legs to a pulp—it
j feels so good when you stop, you
j know.
Anyway, it's round and round
; the inside edge of the pool, crawl,
side, breast, back, float, Austra
lian crawl. Japanese crawl, Scan
dinavian side. Norwegian side,
breast of chicken with a half-flut
ter kick and square it off at the
corners.
The combination of swimming
through the oil, off the board, and
around the edge, is building up some
mighty fine swimmers around the
I Encina pools—at least it will by the
' end of the quarter. Three big ones
for Harry Shipkey for keeping swim
ming instruction tied in with the
i war and teaching his classes to be
ready for anything.

Zooming aircraft dive—Starting on
I the three-foot board you take a small
dive into the pool. Then comes the
ten-foot board, and by the time
you're tied up with muscular mal
