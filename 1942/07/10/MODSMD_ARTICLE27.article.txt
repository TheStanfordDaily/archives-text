Geology students of Stanford Uni
country," Hubert Heffner, profes
dale, are hard at work exploring
and mapping an old quicksilver dis
trict near Vallejo. In three weeks
the group of 18, including some spe
cial students from the Universities
of Minnesota and Oklahoma, will
move to Nevada, where they are to
investigate a new tungsten-bearing
area near Rawhide.
In carrying out this work for the
United States Geological Survey, the
students map the geologic forma
tions, the occurrence of the ores, un
derground formations of existing
mines, and select areas which might
be mined profitably.
' By combining their professional
training with a desire to help the
government in vita! work, these
geology students have again shown
how Stanford has adapted itself to
wartime needs." Professor Eliot
Blackwelder, head of the geology de
partment. pointed out.
