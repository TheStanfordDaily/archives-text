# On War Aims
## 
### 
MOST people today know
that we are fighting a war,
but there are very few of them
who know exactly what we are
fighting for. Possibly no one
really knows, but there is a
discussion group here on the
:ampus which has as its pur
pose the enlightenment of stu
dents along these lines.
This is one of the many serv
ices the Stanford War Board,
under versatile Bob Collins, is
doing for the school. The pro
gram has been so successful
'his quarter that the Hoo'ver
War Library may file some of
'he reports to use as information
Dn student opinion during this
-var.
Every Monday and Thursday
aight at 8 o'clock, 10 to 12 stu
dents gather in the Women's
Clubhouse to air their views on
present war problems and aims,
the present there is a short
age of discussion leaders. Any
one interested should see Pru
Burtis, Georgette Hatfield, Dick
McClure, or Bob Collins.
