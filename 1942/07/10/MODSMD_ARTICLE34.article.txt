# A 						Wise Move
## 
### 
EXCOM'S decision of Tuesday
night concerning off - cam
ous dances was a wise and far
sighted move. Everywhere one
r urns he hears "on-campus en
tertainment," "stay on campus,"
but there is really a purpose to
all of this talk. Besides the tire
and gas problem, there is the
matter of blackout precautions.
If a party is caught several
miles off campus when an alarm
is sounded, it raises many prob
lems as to getting back before
lockouts, proper blacking out,
and worried parents.
Some groups still don't under
stand why they can't legally
hold these affairs. Maybe if
they think the situation over
and put themselves in the posi
tion of worried parents and pan
ic-stricken girls, they will be
able to realize the logic of the
decision.
