### BILL STEIF 
THE Nazis are still gaining in Rus
sia.
That is the stark fact of today's
news.
They have pushed themselves ]
into dominant positions in a long
stretch on the River Don. The city
of Voronezh, which the Germans !
claimed they had captured last
Tuesday, remains in doubt, but the
positions the Nazis have all along
the Don at that point seem to in
dicate that the practical value of
Voronezh, the city on the east
bank of the Don. is at an end.
Voronezh was important because
it was the main railroad junction
between Moscow and Rostov. The
Russians must now ship the valu
able petroleum products of Astra
khan and the precious industrial
manufactures of Stalingrad up
through Povorino alone.
Even Povorino, in fact, seems to
be threatened. The Nazi drive has in
all probability carried around Voro
nezh, and the announcement that the
Soviets have abandoned Staryi Os
kol, southwest of Voronezh, indicates
that the German drive is expanding
to the south.
* « *
JLJOWEVER, it is a long and rugged
road that the Nazis still must
travel to the Volga, Stalingrad, and
eventually Astrakhan. The success
of Hitler's offensive seems to depend
upon just how long his brown-clad
troops can keep rolling—in other
words, how far the momentum which
they have now will take them. If
they can take Stalingrad or can at
least establish a line along the Volga*,
the Russian resistance in the Cau
casus district is as good as broken.
But the Nazi "if," of course, depends
almost entirely upon how strongly
the Reds can resist Hitler's men. If
the Russians can place 1,000 tanks
in the field against 1.000 Nazi tanks,
as Moscow claimed yesterday after
noon, it would seem that the Ger
mans are not going to reach the
Volga.
And while we arc speaking of it.
I might mention that if the Nazis
do find themselves encamped on
the Volga about August 1, we
might as well decide that for ev
ery Russian life lost in these
weeks, one good, clean, young
American boy will give his in the
next several years. The Russian
war is not a thing so abstract
from our lives as many of us think.

jy/JEANWIIILE, the United States
gets interesting and somewhat
| heartening news from several other

Most important of this are reports
I from Chungking that the Chinese
| armies in Kiangsi province trapped
| 30,000 Japs in recapturing two im
portant towns from Hirohito's men.
Possibly more spectacular is the
news that the Tirpitz, Germany's
: latest and mightiest battleship, was
hit and seriously damaged while in
an attack which it was making upon
i an Allied convoy along the Arctic
| supply route to Russia. This, say
; Allied dispatches, saved the convoy
i and allowed the steady flow of Allied
' war materials into the U.S.S.R. to
! continue comparatively uninter
l rupted.
And one more encouraging sign
| developed in Egypt. The British
seem to be forcing Marshal Rom
mel back little by little, though it
must still be recognized that Rom
mel is pretty deeply entrenched
and only a full-fledged offensive
will be able to dislodge the wily
Nazi. Nevertheless, the picture
seems to be brightening consider
ably in Egypt. The British are
pommelling Rommel's rear from
the air and are sending out small
mobile units daily to harrass the

they have now will take them. If

the Russian resistance in the Cau
casus district is as good as broken.

seem to be forcing Marshal Rom
mel back little by little, though it
must still be recognized that Rom
mel is pretty deeply entrenched
and only a full-fledged offensive
will be able to dislodge the wily
Nazi. Nevertheless, the picture
seems to be brightening consider

Nazi lines west of El Alamein.

They have pushed themselves ]
into dominant positions in a long
stretch on the River Don. The city
of Voronezh, which the Germans !
claimed they had captured last
Tuesday, remains in doubt, but the
positions the Nazis have all along
the Don at that point seem to in
dicate that the practical value of
Voronezh, the city on the east
bank of the Don. is at an end.
Voronezh was important because
it was the main railroad junction
between Moscow and Rostov. The
Russians must now ship the valu
able petroleum products of Astra
khan and the precious industrial
manufactures of Stalingrad up
through Povorino alone.
Even Povorino, in fact, seems to
be threatened. The Nazi drive has in

Soviets have abandoned Staryi Os

that the German drive is expanding

jy/JEANWIIILE, the United States
gets interesting and somewhat

Most important of this are reports
I from Chungking that the Chinese

portant towns from Hirohito's men.
Possibly more spectacular is the
news that the Tirpitz, Germany's
: latest and mightiest battleship, was
hit and seriously damaged while in
an attack which it was making upon
i an Allied convoy along the Arctic
| supply route to Russia. This, say
; Allied dispatches, saved the convoy
i and allowed the steady flow of Allied
' war materials into the U.S.S.R. to
! continue comparatively uninter
l rupted.
And one more encouraging sign

seem to be forcing Marshal Rom
mel back little by little, though it
must still be recognized that Rom
mel is pretty deeply entrenched
and only a full-fledged offensive
will be able to dislodge the wily
Nazi. Nevertheless, the picture
seems to be brightening consider
ably in Egypt. The British are
pommelling Rommel's rear from
the air and are sending out small
mobile units daily to harrass the
Nazi lines west of El Alamein.
Rut it is still an awfully long way

about the only thing that will really
i recompensate for the British North
' African debacle of the Last month.
THE Nazis are still gaining in Rus
sia.
That is the stark fact of today's
news.
They have pushed themselves ]
into dominant positions in a long
stretch on the River Don. The city
of Voronezh, which the Germans !
claimed they had captured last
Tuesday, remains in doubt, but the
positions the Nazis have all along
the Don at that point seem to in
dicate that the practical value of
Voronezh, the city on the east
bank of the Don. is at an end.
Voronezh was important because
it was the main railroad junction
between Moscow and Rostov. The
Russians must now ship the valu
able petroleum products of Astra
khan and the precious industrial
manufactures of Stalingrad up
through Povorino alone.
Even Povorino, in fact, seems to
be threatened. The Nazi drive has in
all probability carried around Voro
nezh, and the announcement that the
Soviets have abandoned Staryi Os
kol, southwest of Voronezh, indicates
that the German drive is expanding
to the south.

JLJOWEVER, it is a long and rugged
road that the Nazis still must
travel to the Volga, Stalingrad, and
eventually Astrakhan. The success
of Hitler's offensive seems to depend
upon just how long his brown-clad
troops can keep rolling—in other
words, how far the momentum which
they have now will take them. If
they can take Stalingrad or can at
least establish a line along the Volga*,
the Russian resistance in the Cau
casus district is as good as broken.
But the Nazi "if," of course, depends
almost entirely upon how strongly
the Reds can resist Hitler's men. If
the Russians can place 1,000 tanks
in the field against 1.000 Nazi tanks,
as Moscow claimed yesterday after
noon, it would seem that the Ger
mans are not going to reach the
Volga.
And while we arc speaking of it.
I might mention that if the Nazis
do find themselves encamped on
the Volga about August 1, we
might as well decide that for ev
ery Russian life lost in these
weeks, one good, clean, young
American boy will give his in the
next several years. The Russian
war is not a thing so abstract
from our lives as many of us think.
