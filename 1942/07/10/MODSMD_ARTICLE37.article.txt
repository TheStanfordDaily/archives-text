Paul Robeson in "Sanders of the
River" plays on Nancy Haskins' Sun
day Movie Series this week in the
Education Auditorium. Among the
short subjects the 1941 Rose Bowl
colored movies is a special attraction.
The 1941 Rose Bowl game was
one of the great Bowl classics. Ne
braska scored in the first five min
utes, but the rags-to-riches Stanford
team came back to tie the score be
fore the end of the first quarter.
Then Nebraska completed a long
pass to go out in front 13-7; when a
few minutes later Stanford duplicat
ed the pass play at the other end
of the field, and kicked the extra
point to take the lead, 14-13. And
the lead was clinched with Kmeto
vic's amazing runback for a touch
down when practically every Ne
braska player was viciously blocked
out.
"Sanders of the River" is a unique
African picture, filmed in the Bel
gian Congo during four months on
location after an extended expedition
led by Zoltan Korda (who this year

picture of its time.

drunk on gin, executes a white man,
then plots to kill and skin Paul
Robeson.
