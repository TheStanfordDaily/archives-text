# Mexican Chaplin Stars In Tonight's Picture
## 
### 
The famous Mexican movie, "Ni Sangre Ni Arena," which will show in
the Education Auditorium tonight at 8. is a parody on bull fighting that
would doubtlessly be funny to a Mexican.
Time-Life critics acclaimed it wildly when it was released, about (he
same time as Tyrone Powers' vehicle, "Blood and Sand." These critics

said that "Ni Sangre Ni Arena"â™¦
("Neither Blood nor Sand") accom- ;
plished in comedy what "Blood and
Sand" attempted in tragedy.
Star of the picture is the Mexican
favorite. Cantinflas, called the Mex
ican Charlie Chaplin. He plays a
fast-talking pisano who by various
off-color devilishment commits him
self to fighting the bull in the shoes
of the great Toreador and finds him
self twice acclaimed.
One worries throughout the pic
ture whether Cantinflas' pants are
going to fall down, since he wears his
belt half a foot below his waist.
The bull fights, with well-cap
tured football-stadium atmosphere
and Mexican band music to make
them grand-operish, are obviously
the real thing. It is not uninterest
ing to listen to the rapid-fire Span
ish spoken, even if it cannot be un
derstood. An American phrase
crops up occasionally and a sum
mary in English is to be printed for j
tonight's showing.
The picture is sponsored at Stan- j
I ford by the Dramatists' Alliance and
Sigma Delta Pi, Spanish honor so-
I ciety.
