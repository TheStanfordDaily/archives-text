# Travel Movie Shows Tonight
## 
### 
"Guatemala," a motion picture in
technicolor, will be presented this
evening at 8 in the auditorium of
the Memorial Hall by Elsie Cross and
Florence Dean as the program of the
weekly Tuesday Evening Series.
The movie will show some of the
many varied scenes that can be
viewed in this sunny Central Amer
ican neighbor republic. The setting
for much of the picture takes place
in the region of Lake Atitlan with its
surrounding volcanos, flowers, mar
kets, and quaint lake village.
One of the highlights of the film
will be the vivid account of the
Santo Tomas religious festival in
which the natives parade through the
town's streets.
VIEWS OF CAPITOL
In contrast to scenes of primitive
native life are views of the modern
capitol, Guatemala City. Here are
shown the up-to-date buildings,
homes, industries, and hospitals, in
cluding the famous hospital of the
United Fruit Company where Dr.
McPhail carried on his revolution
ary experiments on malaria. The
annual fair which takes place in the
capitol is pictured in vivid colors.
The coffee industry and banana
farms are two of the country's chief
sources of wealth and mediums of
exportation. The photographers have
recorded interesting views concern
ing the daily work in the cultivation
of these two chief products.
NATIVE FARMS
Another contrast in the little Re
public is the difference in the meth
ods used for farming on the little
native farms from those of the hi, 1 *
plantations. The Indians use primi
tive implements that have survived
for hundreds of years. Typical

farm life scenes are depicted and
natives are shown in their national
costumes.
Miss Cross, the photographer, and
Miss Dean have made two trips to
Guatemala. The picture will include
shots, taken on their last expedition
as well.
