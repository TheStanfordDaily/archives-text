'Twas only idle rumor Thursday when we noted (hat Jim Pettit,
Stanford's flashy soph halfback and trackman, was eyeing the armed
services. Friday came the axe for the Farm, the blessing for the Navy
when Pettit accepted an appointment to Annapolis Naval Academy. Pettit
was heralded by many as Pete Kmetovie's successor at left halfback in the
Indian T formation.
A product of Benson High School in Portland, Ore.. Pettit was fast
enough to handle the L.H. speed burden. He turned a double sprint vic
tory in the April Little Big Meet at Berkeley when he trimmed teammate
A1 Iloisch in a 9.9 century and followed with a 21.(5 win in the 220-yard

■4. race.
One of Harry Shipkey's mainstays
jon the Papoose grid team, Pettit
• pedaled his way over the Trobabes
i to three touchdowns, helping the In
dian freshmen to a 25-<3 rout.
He was a mainspring in Coach
Marehy Schwartz' fall football plans,
and his absence again cuts down the
j available material at halfback to the
I point where we'd almost prophesy
i the innovation of a single wing
| formation.
At any rate, Pettit's loss must be
| rationalized along with the rest, A1
Cole, Hank Norberg, maybe Ray
! Hammett, and others, as part of the
! national emergency. And as the
: football season grows nearer one
| wonders if perhaps Edwin Atherton,
{ coast grid czar, will lower the bar
and let "purgees" back in the ball
game—or is that just warwishful
thinking?
