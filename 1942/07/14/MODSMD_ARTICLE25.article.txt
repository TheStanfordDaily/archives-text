face to face with Bud Browne!!,
number one man on Stanford's
N.C.A.A. crown holding team for the
past two years. Saturday in the
semi-finals of the Stanford Invita
tional golf tourney.

player of the tourney thus far,
ousting P.C.C. Champ Frank Mc-
Cann in the first round and knocking
over Pete Sehefzick Sunday in the
quarter-finals. He threw a 73 at Mc-
Cann, and that was plenty good for
a victory.
The chances of this Sunday's 36-
hole final being an all-undergrad
uate affair are pretty good. Either
Brownell or LaGasa is a cinch to be
in the battle. George Traphagen,
who won the medal with a hot 70
and -has been right next to par
through the whole tourney to date,
has to beat out Bobby Roos Jr.,
Menlo titlist, in the semis to keep the
finals among undergraduates. Roos,
a former member of the Indian
team, hasn't really been on his stick
during match play, after firing a 72
in the qualifying round, but he has
the game 1o give Traphagen plenty
of troublo Saturday.
The draw forced Dave Doud, In
dian team member, to play Trapha
gen, which was tough for Doud.
