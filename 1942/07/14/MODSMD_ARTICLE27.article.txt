# On the War Path
## 
### 
THE rubber shortage has be
come so important that high
way patrol officers of all coun
ties in California have received
orders to stop all motorists
traveling in excess of 40 miles
per hour. Motorists so stopped
will be warned that they are
violating their patriotic duty by
wasting precious rubber.
The move is designed to
conserve transportation because
of the nationwide rubber short
age and follows instructions
given Director James M. Carter
by Governor Olson to stop cars
traveling over the 40-mile limit
,l aid down in President Roose
velt's proclamation.
Officers making such stops
vill examine the tires of the mo
torist. If deemed unsafe, a cita
tion will be issued. The officers
vill also check the operator's li
cense to see that it has not ex
pired and examine the registra
tion certificate. If these are
found in order and all equip
ment is deemed safe, the motor
:st will be warned to stay under
40 and permitted to proceed.
The Department of Vehicles is
Â»nitiating such a move to con
serve equipment which will
help win the war. According to
Director Carter, "This is the best
vay for the people of the state
'o avoid gas rationing."
