# Scavenge in Style
## 
### 
A BRAND new idea in the
way of entertainment has
'inally hit the campus. Friday
night Stanford will have its first
ill-University scavenger hunt—
i hunt for essential war mate
rials such as metal and tin.
The committee in charge has
irranged the program so that
students from freshmen up to
seniors will be able to meet
people and have a good time in
Dne evening. This is supposed
to be a no - date affair with
groups of three and four couples
signing up to work together. In
fact, the sign-up doesn't even
have to be according to couples
—this will allow those guys and
gals who aren't particularly
choosy as to whom they scav
enge with a chance to exert their
independence.
To date ten outstanding prizes
have been obtained, ranging
from theater passes to chicken
dinners. Cars will be banned,
and the hunt will be confined to
'he campus.
This is the type of entertain
ment we should be striving for
—on campus, lots of fun, and
useful. The idea was the brain
child of Vernice Hines, who has
been working hard promoting
the scheme to students and to
merchants who might give
prizes.
Now all the rest of the student
body has to do is fall in line and
sample this new type of enter
tainment. If it's successful, let's
have more; if it fails, let's find
out what was wrong and rem
edy the situation.
