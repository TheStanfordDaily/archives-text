## A 						LESSON FROM AESOP 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
jyFR. AESOP, a talented Greek of
the Hellenic (as opposed to the
Row) variety, tells of three sons
gathered about a dying father and
hearing that in their orchard is the
family fortune to be got by digging.
Dig they did, but found no treas
ure. Pretty eefed, they turned to
harvesting their crop, only to find it

many times larger than
ever before because of all
the cultivating.
This is sort of what is
going on between the
Quad and the Libe. It

may seem like a waste of effort and
money at the moment to take out
the old, broken pavement and re
place it with grass, but it can be
justified in a long run perspective.
Student fees here at Stanford have
reached (in many minds they have
far exceeded) the maximum. All
additional revenue must come from
gifts. Such gifts come, in the main,
from business men.
A well kept institution implies a
well managed one, so a few thou
sand dollars spent on upkeep is
likely to attract far more in gifts
than one where savings have been
made at the expense of appearance.
It may be of interest that all im
provements, such as the new road
from the Chem Building to Roble
and over to the post office, have been
financed out of savings in the regu
lar budget and have entailed no
additional appropriations.
