A month of rubber salvaging un
der Chuck Mcßrian, of the SWB, has
brought Stanford 7.500 pounds of
old tires, bathing caps, floor mats,
and other items of rubber content.
Largest boost to the campaign was
made by Heineke's Shell station last
Thursday, when the station was
closed and employees spent the day
scouring local residences for rub
ber, as the President terminated the
national drive.
SHELL CONTRIBUTION
The Shell station's contribution
amounted to 3,000 pounds. One and
a half tons wei'e collected at the
Corp Yard.
According to Mcßrian, city service
organizations showed close co-oper
ation with the Stanford effort by can
vassing houses on the campus. It
was reported that a large amount of
rubber was donated to downtown
service stations by Stanford students.
Although the national drive is offi
cially over, Stanford will continue its
rubber salvage for the duration.
Under Cardinal directorship, a scav
enger hunt Friday night will supple
ment the prolonged rubber drive
(see col. 3).
SPEAKERS CREDITED
In making the previous rubber
campaign successful, Chairman Mc-
Brian credits Vernice Hines, chair
man of the Publicity Committee,
who prepared numerous campaign
posters, and the Speakers Bureau,
which waged an intensified oral
campaign for campus support.
"There is still a tremendous mine
of scrap rubber as yet untapped on
the campus," remarked Mcßrian,
"and plans are being laid for com
pulsory collections if voluntary con
tributions prove inadequate."
