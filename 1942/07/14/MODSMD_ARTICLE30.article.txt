# FLOORMATS AND DOOR MATS
## 
### 
pVEN WITHOUT the help of
Cardinals the campus managed
to contribute over three tons of rub
ber to the National Scrap Rubber
Drive.
It is interesting to note that a part
of this was floor mats from the rear
compartments of students' cars.
At the same time one can't help
wondering why, if the students can
take the rubber mats out of their
cars, the Bookstore couldn't have
contributed the two heavy rubber
mats that lie outside its doors.
If the two mats outside the Ad
Building are rubber then they too
detract from the patriotic appearance
that our campus has lately taken on
itself with the uniforms that are
currently seen all about.
