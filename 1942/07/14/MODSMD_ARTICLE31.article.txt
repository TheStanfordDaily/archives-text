WITH ABSOLUTELY no intention
of offending Prof. Tom Barclay,
we want to go on record as opposed
to the practice of assigning seats in
Stanford classes.
This practice, we feel, runs counter
to the motto of our University and
the GugPenheim Aeronautics Lab
oratory. "Let the Winds of Freedom
Blow."
One defense of the "system" is that
it is an incentive to attend class.
This is erroneous, for, given one
good looking girl and one handsome
fellow per class, the attendance will
be just as high with complete free
dom of seating.
Another supposed advantage is
that instead of saying, "Miss Jones,
will you please remain after class?"
the teacher need only remark, "Seat
65, see me later!" On this I reserve
comment.
