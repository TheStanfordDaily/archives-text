# A
						SUPER COLOSSAL EXTRAVAGANZA, PLEASE
## 
### 
STANFORD'S Smart Set, and a
good many others, too, are at
tending the Sunday evening movies
in ever-increasing numbers. With
out a doubt it is fast becoming the
social thing to do.
We would like to take this oppor
tunity of asking Nancy Haskins,
chairman of the thing, to get us one
of those super-dooper DeMille spec
tacles of former days.
Our cinema appetite is parched for
one of those old gala vehicles with
25.000 extras, tremendous sets, milk
baths, and all the trappings.
