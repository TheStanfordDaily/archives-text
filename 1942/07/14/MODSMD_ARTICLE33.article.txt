"THE GOLD RUSH," now playing
at the Mayfield in Mayficld.
Seventeen years ago Charlie Chap
lin's "Gold Rush" was voted the out
standing motion picture of the year.
To this greatest of his silent suc
cesses, Chaplin has dubbed in a
"Hearts and Flowers" musical score
of Wagner's "Evening Star," etc.,
and his own voice in a simple narra
tion; some scenes he has cut (1,000
feet worth) and some he has added
and lengthened that were originally
cut.
The result is one of the most in
teresting releases of 1942, a year
which has been, in more cinemic
ways than this revival, significantly
reactionary.
Being more than a curiosity of an
other generation's entertainment,
and providing more than the atavistic
pleasure of a corny Klondike story,
"The Gold Rush" is an ageless prod
uct of the genius of Chaplin. Its
photography for all its age is amaz
ingly modern—better-lit and less
jerky than the bulk of contemporary
foreign films; its gags for all their
age are amazingly funny—the dance
of the rolls, for example, remains un
surpassed; and the character of the
"Little Fellow" with flopping shoes
and minced mustache, for all its age,
is still amazingly pathetic.—Covey
