Herbert Goldhamer, Stanford Uni
versity sociologist, through study of
over .">,OOO organizations in Chicago,
has come to the conclusion that
presidents are either of two varieties.
They are either neurotics or ex
tremely well adjusted persons.
"The well adjusted person holds
office because he is chosen by oth
ers, or, as it were, has the office
thrust upon him because of his abil
ity," says Professor Goldhamer,
"while the neurotic pushes himself
into leadership positions because of
an excessive energy resulting from
frustrations."

Among the organizations that the
professor used as his material are
social clubs, fraternal orders, polit
ical clubs, trade unions, women's
clubs, and business men's associa
tions. He points out that the better
adjusted a person is, the more or
ganizations he belongs to.

College men with responsible posi
tions are usually members of a
greater number of organizations
than, for instance, the average high
school graduate in a minor position,
Mr. Goldhamer points out.

The study also revealed that men
usually enter into most of their club
activities after courtship and the
early years of marriage. Another
fact revealed was that young single
women living with their parents and
persons with evident personality
maladjustments, show a higher pref
erence for membership in political
and reform associations than do other
more well adjusted persons.

This study of voluntary associa
tions by the professor was aided by
the WPA and the social science re
search committee of the University
of Chicago.
