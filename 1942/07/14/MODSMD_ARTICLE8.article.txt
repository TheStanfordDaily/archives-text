# Graduate Writes Palestine Book
## 
### 
Stanford graduate Paul L. Hanna,
Ph.D., University of Florida, Gaines
ville, Fla., is the author of a re
cently published book, "British
Policy in Palestine."
Written under the dii'ection of Dr.
Carl F. Brand with material gathered
at the Hoover Library, this book has
political as well as literary signifi
cance.
Because many national as well as
territorial problems will have to be
settled at the end of the present war,
the contents of the book are timely,
for they provide invaluable data on
the solution of Palestine and the
Zionist and Nationalist movements
problems.
"Twenty-five years have passed
since the Balfour Declaration was
issued, and the present study by Dr.
Paul L. Hanna provides a timely
and unbiased review of the progress
that has been made in the accom
plishment of its purpose and of the
obstacles that have been encoun
tered," according to the foreword
written in this book by Josephus
Daniels, former Secretary of the
Navy under Woodrow Wilson.
