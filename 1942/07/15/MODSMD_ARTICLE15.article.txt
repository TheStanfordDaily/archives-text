### BOB SONTAG 
JJULLET BALLOT BAIT:
There's gonna be a college all
star vs. Chicago Bears football
fracas come August 28 at Soldiers"
Field in Chicago. The starting 11
players will be picked from the ex
perts'. grandstand quarterbacks',
and just plain fans' own choices.
The poll will continue until July
2(! at midnight when the players
with the largest number of votes
will be named to start against the
play-for-pay T eleven.
All ballots should be Sent to the
San Francisco Chronicle.
So: it behooves us to ask the great
Farm savant and opiner, H. D.
Thoreau, to give us his choices for
the collegians.
The great one. momentarily duck
ing out of his mole-like den in the
Chappie office, opined thusly, figur
ing six Stanford football players
.could take the cake if enough stu
dents and followers send in ballots
for 'em. And. by Gawd, he was
printing the ballots for said students
and followers when we left him
fondling his brayer and caressing a
type form with it, ostensibly print
ing ballots to fire at the Chronicle
sporting green.
Here are Thoreau's six Redskins
worthy of pencil pushers' diligence:
Arnold Meiners, left end
Ken Rohesky. left guard
Vic Lindskog. center
Freddy Meyer, right end
Frankie Albert, quarterback
Tele Kmetovic, left halfback
Proceeds from the game will go to
the Armv and Navv relief societies.

making the contest one of the sport
ing world's biggest contributions.
Voting started Monday. and
Western Conference coaches cast
their ballots for the all-star club.
Five out of nine picked Albert at
quarterback, so the Farm is on a
good thing there. It is assumed that
those named on the final team, if in
service, will be given leave to com
pete. The training period for the
game begins August 8 at North
western University.
So if Thoreau is thorough through
and through, catch a ballot from
him and send it up to San Francisco.
