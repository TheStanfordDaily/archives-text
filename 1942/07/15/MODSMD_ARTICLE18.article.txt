# Gen. Stillwell's Daughter Displays Oriental Art Here

A cleft hand pit-keel up a bronze spoon shaped like a plum twig and
blossom and neatly poured a drop of water oil a sheet of white paper
that was almost blank. The vertical side of a clilV, an overhanging tree,
and a tiny boat showed in black on the white expanse.
The artist. Miss Alison Stilwell. a young American adept at Chinese

painting, smiled up the crowd for
whom she was demonstrating in the
Thomas Welton Stanford Art Gal
lery yesterday afternoon.
''If I were back in China I'd use
absorbent paper instead of Kleenex
for this." she explained, blotting the
moistened page. Selecting a fox
hair brush from those resting on a
bronze stand of tangled vines, she
tinted a clump of pines pale green
with paint made of ground malachite,
glue, and water. In brightly enam
eled porcelain boxes were other
simple colors — blue made of lapis
lazuli, red from a boiled wood. All
Chinese paints, whether prepared in
powder, stick or cake form, and
whether applied to silk or paper, are
mixed with water.
Miss Stilwell is a daughter of
General Joseph Stilwell, now com
manding Chinese and American
forces in the Orient. She acquired
her technique in Peking, first from

no one less than Prince P'u Ju (pro
nounced Pooh Rooh), a member of
the Manchu royal family. Her three
years of training under him were in
terrupted for a year during which
the Prince went into traditional
mourning clad in white with uncut
hair after the death of his mother.
Mr. Yu Fei An then taught flower
and bird painting to both Alison and
her sister, Winifred, who also plays
on Chinese instruments.
Miss Stilwell's paintings have
been on exhibition in the gallery for
the past month. Notable among
them is a portrait of an old priest
in a patchwork robe. The subject,
Miss Stilwell assures us, is entirely
imaginary—but she will admit her
father declared it the best portrait
ever done of him.

One hundred and fifty different
strains of black stem rust have been
identified in wheat.

forces in the Orient. She acquired
her technique in Peking, first from

no one less than Prince P'u Ju (pro
nounced Pooh Rooh), a member of
the Manchu royal family. Her three
years of training under him were in

the Prince went into traditional
mourning clad in white with uncut
hair after the death of his mother.
Mr. Yu Fei An then taught flower
and bird painting to both Alison and
her sister, Winifred, who also plays
on Chinese instruments.
Miss Stilwell's paintings have
been on exhibition in the gallery for
the past month. Notable among
them is a portrait of an old priest
in a patchwork robe. The subject,
Miss Stilwell assures us, is entirely
imaginary—but she will admit her
father declared it the best portrait
ever done of him.

One hundred and fifty different
strains of black stem rust have been
identified in wheat.
A cleft hand pit-keel up a bronze spoon shaped like a plum twig and

''If I were back in China I'd use
absorbent paper instead of Kleenex
for this." she explained, blotting the

hair brush from those resting on a
bronze stand of tangled vines, she
tinted a clump of pines pale green
with paint made of ground malachite,
glue, and water. In brightly enam
eled porcelain boxes were other
simple colors — blue made of lapis
lazuli, red from a boiled wood. All
Chinese paints, whether prepared in
powder, stick or cake form, and
whether applied to silk or paper, are
mixed with water.
