# Wait for Your Fag

STANFORD has many grad
lO uate students and outsid
ers here this quarter who do not
understand some of the tradi
tions of our University. One of
♦he most fundamental of these
is the question of smoking in
the Quad.
Traditionally, the law students
have been the greatest offend
ers — the great pillars of inde
pendence who toss tradition to
the winds in order to have a
cigarette before class. The first
weeks of school most of the
rosh forget and wait until they
qet into the middle of the Quad
before finishing their cigarettes.
But now students who have
.been here for two and three
•/ears seem to have forgotten
completely about the custom.
Some persons even think the
equest has been completely
abandoned "for the duration"
iust because "practically every
thing else has been done away
vith."
Of course, many wonder
-vhat is back of this tradition.
When the University was found
ed, Mrs. Leland Stanford, in one
3f her few requests, asked that
students do not smoke in the
Quad. For years this custom
vas strictly adhered to, but in
'he last five or six years a new
crop of people, who pride them
selves in being independent,
have entered the portals of Le
'and Stanford Junior University
and torn down all of the prin
ciples which have lasted for
over 40 years.'
Not so many persons confine
'heir smoking to the Inner Quad
—it is mainly the walk along
'he edge of the Quad which is
inhabited by violators.
The next time you want to
ight a cigarette in front of Room
100, think and try to wait until
class is over and step outside
the Quad for your "little white
c riend."
You can also help revive a
dying tradition by politely re
ninding your friends when they
start to smoke in the Quad.

When is the Union Cellar go
ing to take down those iron
bars? Why should meals be
spoiled because the Union
wants us to feel like lions locked
in cages? And when is the
'rophy case going to be chang
ed? Is this some kind of a new
tradition?
