### BILL STEIF 
JT'S the same stuff from Russia to
day. The Nazis are pouring
through a dozen gaps in the Red
lines. After having made the big
dent along the Don at Voronezh, they
proceeded to strike further south on
the Don. Now they are pushing into
Rostov (a Stockholm dispatch says
they were only six miles away from
that city last night), have extended
a deep wedge from Rossosh and
Boguchar toward Stalingrad, and on
the northern front are again hitting
from Vyazma and Rzhev toward
Moscow.
The Russians, who have held up
against a constant pounding from
Hitler's grey automatons for over a
year, seem to be taking a beating
from which they may never recover.
This does not mean that the Bolshe
viks are by any stretch of the imagi
nation licked, but it does mean that

it is extremely possible—one is al
most tempted to say probable after a
quick glance at a map of southern
Russia—that the Reds may be ir
revocably licked within the next few
weeks.
And in the long run, this may
mean that We lose this war.
I think that this is as good a time
as any to try to think clearly on
this subject. If Joe Stalin's troops
fold up under the pressure to which
they are now being subjected, how
will this affect the United States?
First, it will that the difficulties of
opening a western front will be en
larged several hundred per cent.
This will be because, even though
Russia is not totally subjugated, the
backbone of her industry and de
fenses will have been broken. In
fact, this may even bring Mr. Hitler
to the point of launching an offensive
against England, a move which might
be successful.

and more likely, is that
Hitler could pour into India and
in conjunction with the Japs, mop up
China. After that, the United States
and the English island would be
entirely isolated and "the war of at
trition" might become an actuality
which could eventually beat us.
Third — and this goes for sure —
more American lives would prob
ably be lost than the combined to
tals of American lives lost in all our
wars since 1776. Under any circum
stances, a Russian defeat now means
a definite prolongation of the war.
The answer, it would seem, lies in
the opening of a second front some
where that will divert Herr Hitler.

the northern front are again hitting
from Vyazma and Rzhev toward
Moscow.
The Russians, who have held up
against a constant pounding from
Hitler's grey automatons for over a
year, seem to be taking a beating
from which they may never recover.
This does not mean that the Bolshe
viks are by any stretch of the imagi
nation licked, but it does mean that

it is extremely possible—one is al
most tempted to say probable after a
quick glance at a map of southern
Russia—that the Reds may be ir
revocably licked within the next few
weeks.
And in the long run, this may
mean that We lose this war.
I think that this is as good a time
as any to try to think clearly on
this subject. If Joe Stalin's troops
fold up under the pressure to which
they are now being subjected, how
will this affect the United States?
First, it will that the difficulties of
opening a western front will be en
larged several hundred per cent.
This will be because, even though
Russia is not totally subjugated, the
backbone of her industry and de
fenses will have been broken. In
fact, this may even bring Mr. Hitler
to the point of launching an offensive
against England, a move which might
be successful.

and more likely, is that
Hitler could pour into India and
in conjunction with the Japs, mop up
China. After that, the United States
and the English island would be
entirely isolated and "the war of at
trition" might become an actuality
which could eventually beat us.
Third — and this goes for sure —
more American lives would prob
ably be lost than the combined to
tals of American lives lost in all our
wars since 1776. Under any circum
stances, a Russian defeat now means
a definite prolongation of the war.
The answer, it would seem, lies in
the opening of a second front some
where that will divert Herr Hitler.


JOSEPH STALIN
JT'S the same stuff from Russia to
day. The Nazis are pouring
through a dozen gaps in the Red
lines. After having made the big
dent along the Don at Voronezh, they
proceeded to strike further south on
the Don. Now they are pushing into
Rostov (a Stockholm dispatch says
they were only six miles away from
that city last night), have extended
a deep wedge from Rossosh and
Boguchar toward Stalingrad, and on
the northern front are again hitting
from Vyazma and Rzhev toward
Moscow.
