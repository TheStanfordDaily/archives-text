# High Predicted In Stamp Sales
## 
### 
It is estimated that war stamp
sales, which reached a summer peak
of $1,110.50 last week, will mount
even higher tomorrow.
Nancy Schermerhorn, directing
the War Funds division of the Stan
ford War Board, has made the pur
chase of 14 reconnaissance cars as
the goal of this quarter's drive. Last
spring stamp sales netted the pur
chase price of the same number of
jeeps, which cost half as much.
"Although plans are not yet defi
nite." remarked Miss Schermerhorn,
"a reconnaissance car may be chris
tened on campus this week. Al
ready this summer stamp receipts
are almost equal to the price of three
reconnaissance cars."
Following the customary proce
dure, nine sales booths will be open
today, augmented by sales in cam
pus living groups. Last week three
fraternities showed a 100 per cent
response, with Toyon hitting 90 per
cent.
Girls will circulate through the
Cellar this morning at 10 and at 9
in the evening in attempts to in
crease sales. The Library and Un
ion have indicated their co-operation
by announcing that change may be
given in war stamps at the custo
mer's request.
Committee heads Bill Levers at
Toyon, Carl Livingston at Encina,
Eleanor Lindholm at Lagunita, and
Bob Hampton in charge of frater
nity sales, anticipate no ceiling for
stamp sales and expect today to
follow the increasing trend which
has been manifested during the last
month.
