year class meet their upper class
men, the 2nd-year Med, in a game
that will decide absolutely nothing
except the championship of the
medical profession. .lack McDonald,
Cutter pitcher, aided by Jack Par
sons and Bill Cunha, should hurl the
Cutters to victory.
Ellis Mahan, U.S. Army Hurler, whose hand grenade pitching blasted the
Biz Wigs to their first defeat Tuesday, takes the mound today against
Spar Ducks, last year's Summer Quarter softball champions. Over in
A League Harry Booth will try to put his Alpha Sig-Theta Chi nine hack
>into the loop leadership.

Seven teams in A League are tied
for first place with two wins against
one defeat. The Slave Drivers and
the Army boys are the only squads
with clean slates in B League.
MAIIAN HAS EDGE
Ellis Mahan should not have 100
much trouble matching the hurling
of Hanslader, if comparative scores
are any indication of a team's
strength. Wigs got three con
secutive home runs when they beat
ihe Spar Ducks, 9-5. while the Army
found the slants of Marsh Weigle to
their liking, winning handily, 9-1.
Spar Ducks boast of a 7-2 win over
the 2nd-year Mod team and a 7-1 de
cision over the impotent Menlo Oaks.
The Army's record includes a shut
out win over the Cutters and a 4-1
victory over the thrice - dumped
Pied Typers.
Booth, after losing a three-hitter
to the Upper Row, will try to halt
the hitting strength of the Chi Psis,
who have scored an average of nine
runs per game. Outside of Booth's
pitching, the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi
aggregation has little to offer for
| support in the field.
MED SCHOOL CLASH
It's the "crucial" day for the Med
School as the Cutters of the first
year class meet their upper class
men, the 2nd-year Med, in a game
that will decide absolutely nothing
except the championship of the
medical profession. .lack McDonald,
Cutter pitcher, aided by Jack Par
sons and Bill Cunha, should hurl the
Cutters to victory.
