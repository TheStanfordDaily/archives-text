## 
### 
Without telling more than a few of his friends, Robert A. (Bones)
Hamilton, famous blocking right halfback of the Vow Boys and. more re
cently, secretary of the Stanford Alumni Association, has taken a com
mission in the Navy as a lieutenant, and since June 22 has been connected
with the office of Naval Officer Procurement in San Francisco.

Originally assigned to working"*
with college alumni in a search for
naval officers, Lt. Hamilton has re
cently been assigned to the V-l pro
gram which, he says, has been
transferred from the recruiting office
to the office of Naval Officer Pro
curement within the last few weeks.
STILL ALUMNI HEAD
Because the war has necessitated
a curtailment of the usual functions j
of the Alumni Association, Lt. Ham
ilton told The Daily yesterday, he is
still able to supervise the operations
of the association office here by
working at nights and on the week
ends.
''If the job becomes too large to be ;
handled on this part-time basis, I
have a leave of absence from the |
board to fall back on, but the board
hopes that the office will be able to
operate under the present condi
tions," lA. Hamilton pointed out.
WORKING WITH V-l
The V-l program with which the
ex-gridder is working is a Navy !
classification for college freshmen J
and sophomores and high school j
seniors. It is from this class that the
Navy chooses its V-7 officer candi
dates.
Lt. Hamilton was one of the Stan- j
ford freshman football players who j
vowed thoy would never go down to j
defeat on the gridiron before a I
U.S.C. team and proceeded to make
good on their vow through three j
years of varsity ball. While so do- j
ing. the Vow Boys also knocked over
most of the rest of the teams in the :
Pacific Coast Conference and became ]
the only team in history to go to the
Rose Bowl for three consecutive j
years. "Bones" will be remembered I

as the boy who passed to Jimmy j
Coffis for the touchdown which beat
| Southern Methodist in the bowl game J
j of January 1, 193 G.
