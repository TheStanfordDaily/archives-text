DOES The Daily come out
too late to do any good
early in the mornings? That
seemed to be the case yester
day, for from 9 to 9:05 at least
15 persons were seen smoking
on the Quad, among them Jack
Boyd, who has been here for
three years, Alice Parks, who
took the minutes at the Excom
meeting which officially went
on record as supporting Mrs.
Stanford's request that there be
no smoking on Quad, and
Florence Funsten, a graduate
student who has been here long
enough to know Stanford tradi
tions.
As stated yesterday, much of
"he smoking is done on the outer
edge of the Quad which ex-
Tends from the Engineering
Horner to the History Corner.
