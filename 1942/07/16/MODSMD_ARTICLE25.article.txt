# The 						New Speedway
## 
### 
THE squeal of brakes, a yell,
and another Stanford stu
dent hit the hard pavement on
.he Quad, the victim of a speed
: ng cyclist who didn't bother to
;3low down to make a turn.
This hasn't happened yet, but
>t soon will if our own version
">f six-day bicycle racers don't
ake it easy on the turns and re-
Tiember that there are still some
oersons who walk to classes.
The walks in the Quad
shouldn't be turned into speed
ways. The cyclists shouldn't
consider the pedestrians as
nere obstacles in the mad race
*o classes. We didn't come to
school this summer to dodge
trazy pedal-pushers.
Why do some teachers take
roll in the summerâ€”or in any
other quarter? After all, isn't it
f he student's personal responsi
bility to get to class and keep
up on his work?
