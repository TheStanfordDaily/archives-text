# Watch Out
## 
### 
TOMORROW night's scav
enger hunt could turn into
i big farce and a financial trag
3dy if those who participate
don't watch what they take. It
vould be pretty useless to con
duct a drive for salvage mate-
Hals if a lot of the articles col
lected belonged to persons who
didn't want to part with them.
The idea is original and note
worthy, but the participants can
make or break such an event.
Watch your step tomorrow
night and don't go whole hog
just to win a couple of theater
tickets.
