# A 						SELF-PERPETUATING PHENOMENON

### 
"DECAUSE. like
the Republic-

an Party, Cardi
nals, has recently stirred only long
enough to nominate enough mem
bers to avoid extinction, many people
forgot that it existed.
Now, surprise, it will take over
the Scavenger Hunt. We hope it's a
success for then we may not only get
the trophies changed in the Cellar,
but Cardinals may rouse itself from
its sphinx-like torpor and do a
little more than just perpetuate it
self.
If the hunt is unsuccessful, then
we can expect them to foist the
blame off on Excom and hole-up for
another year.
We urge you. if only to get rid of
that lemonade set in the Cellar, to
turn out for the Scavenger Party
Friday.
