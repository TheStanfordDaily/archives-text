npo MANY STUDENTS the closed
doors to the top of the War Libe
do not represent just another ver
boten sign. But a real grievance.
Unfortunately for this column,
which thrives on criticism, the rea
sons for it being closed are quite
valid. This does not mean, however,
that they could not be removed.
One is that the public would dis
turb the research workers. To rem
edy this we need some beneficent
soul to spend a couple of hundred
dollars filling in the left end of the
concourse like the right end.
The other Ls that it is apparently
not wise to allow the students to run
the automatic elevators themselves,
nor to allow them to be at the top
without supervision.
If someone were hired at 50 cents
an hour for three hours in the after
noon, it would take but six visitors
at 25 cents a visit to pay for his
services,
We would certainly like to see
someone work on this problem, even
Cardinals might try it, and perhaps
take away the verboten sign.
