# Daily Sponsors War-Peace Poll
## 
### 
Tomorrow representatives of the
Stanford student body will have a
chance to express their opinions on
the role the United Nations should
play in the war and the peace to
follow.
Members of The Daily staff will
distribute ballots to the first repre
sentatives from four different groups
â€”lower division, upper division,
I Graduate students, and members of
S the faculty.
EIGHT QUESTIONS
The ballot consists of eight ques
j tions representing critical issues
; which will face the world at the end
! of the war. All students interviewed
I are asked to co-operate to the fullest
j extent so that a valid result may be
| obtained.
"We hope to find out," John Hor
rall, Daily editor, said, "just what
Stanford students think, and how
their thoughts compare with those of
the nation as a whole. We feel that
it is only through co-operative
thinking that we can win the peace
that follows."
In days gone by. The Daily has
often obtained excellent results by
taking a general random ballot dur
ing the lunch hour, thus giving
| every student a chance to express his
I opinion.
RANDOM SAMPLING
This summer, because many eat
ing places are closed, a ballot taken
under such conditions would not be
typical of the opinion of the student
body as a whole. Instead, a random
sample will be taken in which the
j opinions of various groups inter
i viewed will be weighed according to
' their relative importance.
Tabulation of The Daily votes
will be held Friday afternoon in The
Daily Shack, and the results will lie
published in next Tuesday's paper.
