# Dr. Caplan Speaks

### 
"Eloquence and the Loss of Lib- '
erty" was the topic of the lecture
given Wednesday afternoon in the j
Women's Clubhouse by Dr. Harry
Caplan, Goldwin Smith Professor of
Classics at Cornell University and at
present acting professor of classics i
here.
Dr. Caplan described the depths to
I which eloquence had fallen in Rome
' during the first century A.D. under
; the absolute rule of the emperors. !
He attributed the degeneration of i
oratory not only to faulty education 1
but chiefly to the decline of political 1
liberty, and gave testimony from
authors of the period to show that
some of them—satirists and histor- i
ians—recognized political freedom as
the source of true eloquence even if ,
accompanied by discord and time-
I consuming debate.
