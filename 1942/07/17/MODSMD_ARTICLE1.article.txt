# Brownell Top Favorite To Capture Golf Crown
## 
### DON SELBY 
With Biul Brownell odds-on favorite to move through all competition
for the second consecutive year, three Stanford undergraduates and a
former University student tee off tomorrow afternoon at 1:15 in the semi
finals of the Stanford Invitational golf tourney.
Flight competition gets underway as soon as the top two matches clear

the first fairway. All matches are-f
18-hole battles except the champion
ship flight finals, which will be over
36 holes.
Medalist George Traphagen, blond
Stanford junior who, with Brownell
and Intercollegiate Champ Frank
Tatum, tied for fifth place in the
qualifying l'ound of the N.C.A.A.
tourney, takes on Bobby Roos Jr.,
winner of the Menlo club title and
former Stanford golfer.
BROWNELL VS. LA GASA
Brownell, for the past two years
No. 1 man on the Stanford golf team
which has won the intercollegiate
crown, meets Jim LaGasa, who, al
though he wasn't good enough to
take the fourteenth place on the
Card team last spring, has been
knocking over the favorites with
amazing regularity in this tourna
ment.
Because of his generally superior
game and his great store of tourna
ment experience, Brownell is ex
pected to have little trouble with
LaGasa, who will be battling a psy
chological barrier as well as the long
hitting Carmel boy. On the other
hand, perhaps the fact that Brownell
is the overwhelming favorite will
take the pressure off LaGasa to such
an extent that he will play the kind
of golf that beat Stanford's Frank
McCann, P.C.C. titlist, in the first
round.
TRAPHAGEN FAVORED
The Traphagen-Roos affair prom
ises to be a humdinger, with Trap
hagen the favorite because of the
fine game he has been demonstrat
ing during the tourney. Roos. how
ever. has the game to knock over
the Card golfer if the latter lets
down at all.
If and when Traphagen and
Brownell meet in the 36-hole final,
the gallery should get a view of ex
cellent golf. Both boys have been
firing right next to par and show no
sign of letting up.

amazing regularity in this tourna
ment.
Because of his generally superior
game and his great store of tourna
ment experience, Brownell is ex
pected to have little trouble with
LaGasa, who will be battling a psy
chological barrier as well as the long
hitting Carmel boy. On the other
hand, perhaps the fact that Brownell
is the overwhelming favorite will
take the pressure off LaGasa to such
an extent that he will play the kind
of golf that beat Stanford's Frank
McCann, P.C.C. titlist, in the first
round.
TRAPHAGEN FAVORED
The Traphagen-Roos affair prom
ises to be a humdinger, with Trap
hagen the favorite because of the
fine game he has been demonstrat
ing during the tourney. Roos. how
ever. has the game to knock over
the Card golfer if the latter lets
down at all.
If and when Traphagen and
Brownell meet in the 36-hole final,
the gallery should get a view of ex
cellent golf. Both boys have been
firing right next to par and show no
sign of letting up.
With Biul Brownell odds-on favorite to move through all competition
for the second consecutive year, three Stanford undergraduates and a
former University student tee off tomorrow afternoon at 1:15 in the semi
finals of the Stanford Invitational golf tourney.
Flight competition gets underway as soon as the top two matches clear

the first fairway. All matches are-f
18-hole battles except the champion
ship flight finals, which will be over
36 holes.
Medalist George Traphagen, blond
Stanford junior who, with Brownell
and Intercollegiate Champ Frank
Tatum, tied for fifth place in the
qualifying l'ound of the N.C.A.A.
tourney, takes on Bobby Roos Jr.,
winner of the Menlo club title and
former Stanford golfer.
BROWNELL VS. LA GASA
Brownell, for the past two years
No. 1 man on the Stanford golf team
which has won the intercollegiate
crown, meets Jim LaGasa, who, al
though he wasn't good enough to
take the fourteenth place on the
Card team last spring, has been
knocking over the favorites with
amazing regularity in this tourna
ment.
