## Seven Dynamic Forces Outlined by Authors 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Ex-President Herbert Hoover and
Vis former right-hand diplomat,
Hugh Gibson, have come out for
American participation in world af
fairs after the war. In a thoughtful
book, "The Problems of Lasting
Peace," Hoover and Gibson have
made their plea for the American
people to begin now to think of the
problems of the coming peace.
The authors demand a complete !
victory in World War 11, for no dur- 1
ible or lasting peace could be !
founded upon compromise. They
say that the peace settlement must
take into account "the underlying
dynamic forces in civilization that I
make for war and peace."
These forces will sit at the peace ;
table, and the Hoover-Gibson thesis j
is that we must learn to deal with j
them in order to get the kind of a
peace that will last.
SEVEN FORCES
"Ideological, economic, national
istic, imperialistic, and militaristic
pressures, and the witches of fear,
hate, and revenge will participate in
every discussion. But on the other
hand, the prayers of a stricken world
tor a lasting peace will echo through
those halls. The seven dynamic i
forces have survived every crisis, j
They will be with us again."
The authors have traced the influ- j
unce of the seven dynamic forces
upon the peace settlements of his
tory, from the Pax Romana to Ver
sailles. They have compiled a beau
tifully simple outline which enables
the ordinary layman to appreciate
the problem of the coming peace in
the light of the historical past.
