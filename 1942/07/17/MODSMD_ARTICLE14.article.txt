# Sign List in Cellar For Share-a-Ride
## 
### 
To facilitate ride-sharing, students
and faculty who live off campus and
drive in every day have been asked
by the Conservation Committee to
sign up on the Share-n-Ride list on
the Cellar Bulletin Board. The co
operative driving movement has
been initiated in the interest of tire
and gasoline conservation and every
driver is urged to sign up today.
