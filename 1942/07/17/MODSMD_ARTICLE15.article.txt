# Book Asks Americans To Think About Peace
## 
### 
This incentive is that "peace should
be built upon fostering representa
tive government."
The authors discuss eight plans for
an instrument to preserve the peace.
They flatly reject complete isolation,
: Pax Americana, and federation. The
; rest of the proposals center around
; restoration of the League of Nations.
Hoover and Gibson seem to lean
I toward making the league "an effec
tive council of nations to preserve
peace solely by pacific settlements
and for building international co
operation."
ALLOW FLEXIBILITY
No matter what plan is adopted,
the authors plead for flexibility
which will allow for necessary
change.
"Peace can best be preserved, not
by preventing change and putting
the future in a strait-jacket, but by
seeking to control change and direct
it."
"The Problems of Lasting Peace"
is important not only because it sig
nalizes the unity of opinion among
political leaders regarding America's
role of world co-operation, but be
cause it is an excellent handbook
with which the American citizen can
begin now to think about the peace.
And it is most important that the
American citizen begins to seriously
regard the coming peace. For Pearl
! Harbor ended an era in which
j Americans shrank from their respon-
I sibilities in a world community of
nations.
Hoover and Gibson herald the pre
monition of America's destiny, and
they have written the message in
simple, but strong words. With all
the hope we hold in our hearts for a
peaceful world we trust that this
message is accepted by the Ameri
can people.
