### H. D. THOREAU 
Introducing H. D. Thoreau for the first time and maybe the only
time this season. From his Chappie haven Davy comes clown to write a
guest column. Take it, Davy.—Ed Note)

By H. D. THOREAU

WHETHER YOU want to or not, you will receive a ballot within the
next few days with the names of Vic Lindskog, Arnie Meiners, Ken
Robesky, Freddie Meyer, Pete Kmetovic, and Frankie Albert printed
on it in 18-point Bernard Gothic type.
Now that we have gotten official word from the S.F. Chronicle that
the ballots are acceptable, all that remains now is for 3,000 people, who

>are interested in seeing those six
Stanford football players on the all
star team which plays the Chicago
Bears in a charity game in Chicago
August 28. to sign their names to
the ballots. The Daily Sports De
partment will collect and send all
ballots to San Francisco.
IF SOL SCHIFF, national table
tennis champion, is really at the Page
Mill Road camp, like the rumor
mongers have it, it would be peachy
if they could rig up a table on the
stadium sod and have him come over
for a couple of exhibitions.
Emery Neale, school champ for
the past three years, is on campus
this summer and might be able to
offer the champ some competition.
ONE OF the trickiest floor men
and best all-around basketball play
ers developed in these parts for
some years was Kenny Davidson,
co-captain of the Indian five for
two years, and all-coast guard dur
ing the same period.
Last year, after taking a year of
graduate work here, he left for San
tiago, Chile, to be basketball in
structor at the University there.
From all reports the success he is
achieving down under is nothing
short of phenomenal.
He is achieving great success as a
goodwill ambassador to Uncle Sam.
AS A HANGOVER from spring in
the final compilation of the nation's
outstanding track and field men:
Johnny Fulton, frosh middle distance
man, Ed Hertel, hurdler, Ed Stamm,
engineering student, and Phil Fox,
discus-throwing alumnus represent
ed Stanford on the list of the ten
best in each event.
Hertel rated fifth in the low
hurdles and sixth in the highs;
Stamm had the sixth best shot
| mark; Fox's discus throw was third
| on the list; Fulton's 880 time was
tenth. A good representation for
what has been called a poor track
year on the Farm.
