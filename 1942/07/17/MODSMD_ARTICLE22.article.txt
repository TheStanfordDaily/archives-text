# Card-Trojan Game May Be at Kezar
## 
### 
That the Stanford-Southern Cal
ifornia football game will be moved
from the local stadium to Kezar
Stadium at San Francisco seems
almost a sure thing. Today Jimmy
Needles, athletic director of the
University of San Francisco, and

Graduate Manager AI Masters will
discuss final negotiations here.
The proposed move came as re
sult of the San Jose State-U.S.F.
game being scheduled the same ,
day as the Troy-Indian contest and
Masters' wish to move the Stanford
game to the fans to aid the trans
portation shortage.
