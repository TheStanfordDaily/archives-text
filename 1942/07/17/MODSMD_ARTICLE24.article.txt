# 'Second Front'
## 
### 
TATE ARE nearing the end of
VV the third year of World
War II without any indication
of a United Nations offensive.
For almost three years we have
been steadily losing — land,
bases, ships, men, machines —
all to gain time.
The Russians and Chinese
have borne the brunt of this
, f ight for time. They have kept
Britain and the United States
.free of battle so we could con
centrate on building forces for
'he offensive which could win
the war.
Today the Russians and Chi
nese are in mortal peril. Both
have reached the low ebb in
their battles for survival. Yet,
There is no indication that the
Russians and Chinese alone can
withstand the full onslaught of
'he German and Japanese arm
es without immediate and con
crete help.
That aid must come from Brit
ain and the United States and it
must come soon. And it must
be more than token aid—it must
oe a real diverting force.
We have been wasting time
speculating as to where to open
a "second front" — France, the
Lowlands, Norway, or the Bal
kans. Our strategists must pick
'he point where our forces can
penetrate deep enough to ease
the pressure on the Russian
:^ront.
Where we open the "second
:ront" isn't important at the mo
ment. It is important that some
adequate offensive be under
taken at once before a mortal
blow can knock the Russians or
Chinese forces out of the war.
Our strategy must undergo
radical revision before we can
oegin to win the war—we must
strike first and strike hard be
fore the time that the Russians
and Chinese have bought so
dearly runs out. —Charlie Allen

nese are in mortal peril. Both
have reached the low ebb in
their battles for survival. Yet,
There is no indication that the
Russians and Chinese alone can
withstand the full onslaught of
'he German and Japanese arm
es without immediate and con
crete help.
That aid must come from Brit
ain and the United States and it
must come soon. And it must
be more than token aid—it must

We have been wasting time
speculating as to where to open
a "second front" — France, the
Lowlands, Norway, or the Bal
kans. Our strategists must pick
'he point where our forces can
penetrate deep enough to ease
the pressure on the Russian

Where we open the "second

adequate offensive be under
taken at once before a mortal
blow can knock the Russians or
Chinese forces out of the war.
Our strategy must undergo
radical revision before we can
oegin to win the war—we must
strike first and strike hard be
fore the time that the Russians
and Chinese have bought so

The Russians and Chinese
have borne the brunt of this
