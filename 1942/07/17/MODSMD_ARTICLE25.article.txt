### BILL STEIF 
IS STANFORD doing more than
its part in helping the United Nations
win this war?
Do Stanford students recognize
fully enough what this war means
to them?
These are two questions which
have been bothering me in the last
couple of months. One, of course,
absolutely depends upon the other.
I put the question which should
logically come first second because I
believe it might be well to review a
little of the evidence as to exactly
| what Stanford has done toward win
j ning our war.
First and foremost: the Farm has
j contributed, just since December 7,
hundreds of strong, intelligent young
i men to the Army, Navy, and Mu-
I rines. American universities are the
j source of a major part of the leader
j ship in the services. Stanford, I be
lieve, has contributed more than its
share of leaders.
Second: several dozen Stanford
experts in the physical and social
sciences have gone back to Washing
ton to serve in various governmental
capacities. This, too, is an important
contribution to victory, because it is
necessary that older men with spe
cialized knowledge be used to best
| advantage in the national war
| scheme.
Third: the Civilian Defense School
and other University on-campus war
projects have been contributions
that must have been made to strive
for Allied success.
FOURTH: the Stanford War Board
i has been organized. Bob Collins has
done a magnificent job in building
j up a functional structure from what
i amounted to practically nothing. The
SWB, as it is now ORGANIZED,
j penetrates into every section of Stan
ford life. Its stamp and bond sales
men, its Red Cross bandage-makers,
[ its junk collectors (to name only a
j few), come from and reach all areas
lof Farm activity. They penetrate to
| all the physical environs of the
j campus.
But are these industrious work
ers meeting with the unqualified
success with which they must
meet? Hardly. The stamp and
bond sales do fairly well, hut not
so well as they should do consid
ering the fact that Stanford stu
dents are in large part drawn from
the economic cream of America's
business. The rubber collection on
campus has been a dismal Hop.
After one big day, few Farm wom
en have shown up in the Red Cross
workrooms to continue work on
bandages. Very few magazines for
service men have been collected.
Stanford students have continu
ously driven their cars in pleasure
spins with little thought to the ir
replaceable rubber on their wheels.
The SWB has penetrated every
corner of the campus, has reached
every individual, but it has not
penetrated the minds of Stanford
men and women. Farm leaders
are worrying about smoking on the
Quad instead of the war.
THIS is not Stanford's fault, I
think. It is the result of a deep
seated cynicism which is a hangover
from the last war and the depression
I and which refuses to allow belief in
! any but the most immediate facts.
It is the result of an attitude which
; says, "Let's play while we can." It
is, most of all, the result of Stanford
and the nation's failure to realize
what the news from Russia and
China and Egypt means. Congress, it
I seems, is merely an enlarged Excom.
J except that Congress is very prob
j ably less intelligent and even more
politically inclined than Excom.
The answer, I think, to my sec
ond question is obvious.
And, meanwhile, in Russia the
Nazis gained another 70 miles on
the road to Stalingrad. Moscow is
slowly being encircled. Rostov is
on the verge of siege. The Germans
are only 80 miles from Alexandria.
It is, I believe, time that Stanford
and the nation look at a map. With
i each mile that the Nazis advance
i more American lives and liberty are
I being k\st.
