# Nazis Foiled In New Film

"MISTER V," now playing al the
Stanford in Palo Alto.
"Mister V" will not make the first
ten—through no fault of its own. It
will be one of those pictures like
"The Long Voyage Home," which,
though in all respects an unusual
and masterful production, ranked
25th last year. Now the subtle, schol
arly "Mister V" bears no resem
blance to "The Long Voyage Home,"
but there is so little to discredit
about it that it will, like "The Long
Voyage Home," be naturally over
looked in the year-end ratings.
Producer, director, and star of the
film, Leslie Howard must now be
placed in the all-round-expert class
of Charles Chaplin and Orson Welles.
The character Mister V smacks of
Howard's early role, Scarlet Pimper
nel, but instead of rescuing aristo
crats from the shadow of the guillo
tine, Mister V rescues geniuses
from Nazi concentration camps. The
mystery-story handling of this idea
makes "Mister V" second only to
"The Invaders" as ranking adventure
picture of the year. Incidentally,
Mary Morris, who has been given
little chance till now to prove she
can act, proves it most excellently in
this production.
