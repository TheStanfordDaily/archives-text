# Mexican Satire To Play Tonight
## 
### 
Dramatists' Alliance and Sigma
Delta Pi will present the Mexican
satire "Ninguna de las Tres," by
Fernando Calderon, tonight at 8 in
the auditorium of the Women's
Clubhouse. The play will be given in
Spanish with programs fully anno
tated in English.
The comedy involves the efforts of
a pair of easy-going Mexican parents
to marry one of their three silly
daughters to a pleasant young friend.
Being a sensible man, however, he
will marry "ninguna de las tres"
(none of the three) in spite of all
sly maneuvers.
The cast is composed of advanced
students of the Spanish department
and students from South America.
Maria Soledad Rael plays the part
of Leonor, the sentimental, novel
reading daughter; Jeanette Skittons
is Mariquita, the vain beauty; Joyce
Wallace plays Clarita, the pedant of
the three. Nancy Reed and Danilo
Luksic play the parents, Dona Sera
pia and Don Timoteo. The part of
Don Juan, the reluctant suitor, is
taken by John Wonder. Andrew
Roberts will play Don Antonio, an
old friend of the family, with Carlos
Asensio as Don Carlos, the foppish
friend of Don Juan.
A typical Mexican "baile" (dance)
to which the audience is invited will
begin after the performance and re
freshments will be served. Admis
sion is 40 cents.
