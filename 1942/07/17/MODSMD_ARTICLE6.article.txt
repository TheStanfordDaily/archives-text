# STANFORD WAR POLL
## 
### GORDON SEVERANCE 
Stanford's opinion on the War and the Peace is a question which The
Daily will try to answer today when its staff will distribute ballots to
the first members of the five specified groups they meet. The number
interviewed from the designated groups—upper division, lower division,
graduate students and faculty members—will be determined in proportion
to their size.
The opinions expressed by each group will be weighed according to
their relative importance so that the results will approximate the actual
opinion of the entire student body.
The ballot consists of eight questions representing critical issues which
will face the world at the end of the war. All students interviewed are
asked to co-operate to the fullest extent so that a valid result may be
obtained.
The purpose of the Daily poll was summarized by John Horrall, when
he remarked yesterday, "We feel that it is only through co-operative
thinking that we can win the peace that follows."
Results of the poll will be publicly tabulated in the Daily Shack this
afternoon, and will appear in next Tuesday's issue.
