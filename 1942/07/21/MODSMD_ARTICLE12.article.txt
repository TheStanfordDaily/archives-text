Mo ving to further safeguard residents of the Stanford campus in case
of disaster, especially in regard to incendiary bombs, Alfred R. Masters.
Stanford Civilian Defense Administrator, yesterday urged persons in
charge of campus residences to fully equip their homes for protection
against fire, and at the same time announced University action taken to

help protect residential districts.
The University has assigned a
truck and a nine-man crew to each
of five residential areas, the crew to
be stationed at the civilian defense
emergency telephones in each of
those areas. Mr. Masters said.
Although the fire de
partment may be better equipped to
take care of the campus than many
city fire departments are to handle
their cities because of the difference
in the size of the areas," he pointed
out. ''No fire department in any city
can give complete protection against
fire in the event of a bombing.
"That's why it is necessary that
every campus residence be ade
quately equipped with sand, long
handled shovels, and hoses to com
bat fire caused by bombs. Some

residences may have enough equip
ment now. but most of them prob
ably have not. For that reason the
Civilian Defense Council is strongly
urging every campus resident to
prepare for the protection of his
own home."
The crews assigned to the resi
dential districts on the campus are,
in addition to the regular 237-man
crew, under the direction of Fire
Chief Arden Hatley, whose main
duty it will be to protect the Quad
and other University buildings.
