# Traphagen Defeats Brownell To Win Stanford Invitational
## 
### DON SELBY 
With George Traphagen's one-up victory over Bud Brownell on (he 38th
hole Sunday for the Stanford Invitational golf crown, the individual honors
garnered by members of Eddie Twiggs' Stanford golf team Ibis year was
evenly balanced between the top four men.
That's largely the significance of the result of the match.

But the golf that was played by
the blond Traphagen is another mat
ter and perhaps one that some of
the top-notchers in the California
amateur field are not so anxious to
consider. In turning back Brown
ell's bid for his second consecutive
hold on this championship, Trapha
gen shot (!7-74—141, one under par,
for the 3G holes and had a birdie
and a par on the two extra holes,
putting him two under par for the
clay's 38 holes.
TWIN BIRDIE
And the golf that Brownell shot in
dropping the match was something
rather hot itself. Although he fired
a par-71 in the morning, he was four
down at the halfway mark.
The Carmel boy had to birdie the
17th and 18th holes to keep from be
ing six-down at lunch time.
In the afternoon Brownell came
back in fine style, whacking away at
Traphagen's lead until he evened the
match on the 12th and took a 1-up
lead on the 13th. He lost it again
on the next hole, regained it on the
15th, and was one up until Traphagen
potted a 10-foot putt for a birdie to
win the 18th hole. Brownell's score
for the afternoon nine was 70, giving
him 141 for the 36 holes.
NO BACK SEAT
Pro Denny Shute played here one
day but didn't do very well for him
self, as he watched Brownell, the
lad with whom he played, card a
sizzling G3 to set a new course rec
ord.
Sunday's exhibition was just an
other bit of evidence that these
Stanford boys of whom Coach
Twiggs is so proud just won't take a
back seat to anyone in this game of
golf.

Traphagen's lead until he evened the
match on the 12th and took a 1-up
lead on the 13th. He lost it again
on the next hole, regained it on the
15th, and was one up until Traphagen
potted a 10-foot putt for a birdie to
win the 18th hole. Brownell's score
for the afternoon nine was 70, giving
him 141 for the 36 holes.
NO BACK SEAT
Pro Denny Shute played here one
day but didn't do very well for him
self, as he watched Brownell, the
lad with whom he played, card a
sizzling G3 to set a new course rec
ord.
Sunday's exhibition was just an
other bit of evidence that these
Stanford boys of whom Coach
Twiggs is so proud just won't take a
back seat to anyone in this game of
golf.
With George Traphagen's one-up victory over Bud Brownell on (he 38th
hole Sunday for the Stanford Invitational golf crown, the individual honors
garnered by members of Eddie Twiggs' Stanford golf team Ibis year was
evenly balanced between the top four men.
That's largely the significance of the result of the match.

But the golf that was played by
the blond Traphagen is another mat
ter and perhaps one that some of
the top-notchers in the California
amateur field are not so anxious to
consider. In turning back Brown
ell's bid for his second consecutive
hold on this championship, Trapha
gen shot (!7-74—141, one under par,
for the 3G holes and had a birdie
and a par on the two extra holes,
putting him two under par for the
clay's 38 holes.
TWIN BIRDIE
And the golf that Brownell shot in
dropping the match was something
rather hot itself. Although he fired
a par-71 in the morning, he was four
down at the halfway mark.
The Carmel boy had to birdie the
17th and 18th holes to keep from be
ing six-down at lunch time.
In the afternoon Brownell came
back in fine style, whacking away at
Traphagen's lead until he evened the
match on the 12th and took a 1-up
lead on the 13th. He lost it again
on the next hole, regained it on the
15th, and was one up until Traphagen

win the 18th hole. Brownell's score
for the afternoon nine was 70, giving
