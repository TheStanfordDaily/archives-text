# Lawson, Liebendorfer Think Navy Wonderful
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Take it from Lieutenants Jim
Lawson and Don Liebendorferâ€”the
Navy is different and it's great.
Lieut. Lawson, Stanford's head
football coach until he enlisted last
1 month, and Lieut. Liebendorfer,
Farm publicity director for the last
18 years, are back in Palo Alto for a
week after receiving commissions at
, Annapolis.
Lieut. Lawson said yesterday he
would leave for Seattle next Monday
to join the Naval Procurement Oflic.e
there. After a month at Seattle he
expects to take a permanent posi
tion at the San Francisco Naval
Procurement OfTiee.
TAKES JOB NEXT WEEK
Lieut. Liebendorfer takes up the
j job of assistant athletic director un
: der Lieut.-Com. Justin "Sam"
J Barry at the Naval Aviation Pre
: Flight School at St. Mary's starting
next week.
Ensign Frank Albert, who also re
ceived his commission Saturday, will
be married today to Miss Martha
Jean Barringer, Stanford senior, at
jan informal wedding in Glendale.
Stanford's all-American has also
been assigned to St. Mary's.
Lieut. Clayton Frye, former Stan
ford boxing coach, will be sent to
the Naval Air Base at San Diego
after completing special work at
Annapolis.
Ensign John McDonough, ex-
Stanford gridder, was assigned to the
i Oakland Naval Air Base.
Lieut. Liebendorfer was his chatty
| self and had much to say of how
| the Navy is training American man
hood.
NAVY APPEALING
'"I can't see how the Navy can help
but appeal to the red-blooded Amer
ican. Its intensive physical training
set-up alone is enough to call forth
most young men. And for those that
enter the flying game it's even more
| of a thrill," he added.
Lieut. Lawson, following the news
; of Stanford's football players joining
i the service, felt pretty keenly for
Marchie Schwartz, who replaced him
as Stanford football coach.
"It's just one of those things that
has to be taken along with the rest
of the war's bad news," he said. Jim
was speaking of Stanford's losing its
| speedy quarterback. A1 Cole, and the
[ possible loss of others instrumental
in the fall irrid camnaitm.
