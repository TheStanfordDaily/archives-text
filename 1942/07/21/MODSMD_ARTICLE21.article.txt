By JERRY MAYER

Revenge may well be the motive
this afternoon when the undefeated
Slave Drivers, composed of faculty
members, runs up against the once
beaten Biz Wigs, also a group not
satisfied with a mere four years of
education, in the feature softhall
game of the afternoon.
Out of this welter of higher edu
cation should emerge a tight pitching
duel between handsome Marsh

Battling to a tie yesterday,
after finishing last Thursday's 10-
inning game in a 10-10 deadlock,
the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi and Chi
I'sis have called off all playoffs
unless vital to the League out
come.

Weigel, Biz Wig hurler, and the
Drivers' Woody Wier. As in each
Slave Driver game, the students will
be out gunning for the boys who
ruin Bawlout* averages.
But they have their work cut out
for them. Behind Weir's potent
chucking the faculty has some good
hitting off the bats of Harry Shipkey,
Red Holman, and Art Wells. But
those creaking bones may not stand
up when the Biz Wigs' "murderers
row" of Weigle, Herb Bull. Tom
Krueger, and Tom Patterson start
leveling for extra bases.
In another feature contest, the
U.S. Army team from Page Mill
tangles with the hapless O'Reillys.
The Army team is undefeated, has
had only two runs scored against it.
