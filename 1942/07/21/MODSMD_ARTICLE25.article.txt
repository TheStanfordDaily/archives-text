# It's Discouraging

STANFORD supports a lot of
dead traditions. In the good
old days, when there were
plenty of cars, Stanford men and
women would start walking
along Palm Drive and get a ride
before reaching the "Y" turn.
Now those students who still
"have cars cherish them like
hey were made completely of
sugar and rubber. Why don't
earless Stanfordites get rides
nto and from Paly? It couldn't
be that their feet are muddy—it
hasn't been raining. It couldn't
De that they don't have enough
oersonality—personality isn't a
prerequisite for hitch-hikers. It
rould be that they have 8.0. —
but that isn't practical. What is
:his fatal attraction Stanford
-valkers don't have for car
owners?
Saturday a member of The
Daily staff started into Palo Alto
■vith the sole intention of getting
•a haircut. He wanted to get a
ide because the big green bus
always gives him indigestion.
4e stood at the designated turn
and waited and waited. Twelve
big, shiny cars whizzed by.
Twelve bronzed arms waved
and twelve sets of teeth smiled,
but still no ride. Then a 1929
Suick squeaked to a stop and
he driver offered the hopeful
oedestrian a ride. There was a
catch, however; the student had
'o help push the car in order to
get it started, but that didn't
bother him. At least he had
'ound someone with the true
spirit, even though it was a
graduate of the Class of 1911
'back on the Farm to look
hings over."
Well, he got his haircut, but
ae still wasn't sure of a return
'rip. He crossed the highway
and waited at the Paly end of
Palm Drive. All sizes, shapes,
and colors of cars went merrily
by—2B in all. Then a lady
pulled over to the side and of
fered the discouraged hiker a
ride if he would tell her how to
get to the Fiji house. He got his
ride, and the lady found the Fiji
nouse, which was a fair bargain.
But 40 cars to get two rides.
\ half-naked hitch-hiker with a
:en years' beard could do better
;han that on a pack trail in the
Sierras.
Why don't we revive a few of
hese dust-laden traditions, air
hem out, and use them now
when they have some practical
/alue?
And another Stanford tradi
'ion continues to be thrown
around like a feather in a wind
storm. Yesterday Bob Luke, on
his journey in back of the His
tory Building, lit up a cigarette
before wandering off the Quad.
Why can't some students wait
another ten steps before they
light their cigarettes?
