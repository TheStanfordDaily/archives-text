## A 						BUMBLED BARF 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
WEEK AGO this column ex
pressed a certain apathy to the
practice of assigning seats.
Professor Tom Barclay's name was
mentioned in this connection, and
unfortunately, the implication that
he was guilty of this J.C.-like prac
tice was all too apparent.
A student of Dr. Barclay's at once
produced a correction. It seems that
while he does assign seats, it is not
required that one occupy an as
signed, or any other seat.
Dr. Barclay does this only so that
he may learn the names of his stu
dents and dislikes compulsion along
with the rest of us.
Professor Barclay is to be com
mended, not criticized, and this col
umn is ashamed of itself.
