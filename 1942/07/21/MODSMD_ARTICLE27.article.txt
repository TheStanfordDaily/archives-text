I HAVE I been taken so
| literally as when I ordered a
plain hamburger in the Cellar.
Surprised at seeing no lettuce,
onions, or tomato peeping out from
beneath the bun; disappointed be
cause of no relishes, condiments, or
gravies trickled from between the
toasted segments, I peered within.
There, in abject loneliness, lay a
ground and grilled disc of flesh that
had once known a mother's sym
pathy and tenderness, even as you
or I.
Nude and greasy it lay; five cents
more and it could have had a coat
of cheese.
How like life! Cover and comfort
for five cents more. But why must
Cellar hamburgers remind us of
I this?
A piece of lettuce, a dash of rel
j ish. trifles each, seem not too much
to ask.
