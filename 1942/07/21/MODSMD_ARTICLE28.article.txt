# BLESSINGS ON YOU. BABE

### 
no YOU EVER feel like a chewed
sombrero when Saturday after
noon rolls around? Do smooth tires
keep you from the beach or some
friendly oasis?
Then take a trip to the pool be
hind the Women's Gym. There you
can lie on the grass, 101 l in the
water, play volleyball, or, if you
have been at Stanford very long, just
stare.
Jumping on the bandwagon for a
moment, let me plug the "hello"
habit, now near dead, particularly at
such a place as the pool.
A friend of mine started to pass
the time of day with a starry-eyed
little thing in a blue and white play
suit at the pool Saturday. The look
he got back momentarily froze the
surface of the pool.
Enough of that, girls. You're per
fectly safe.
And remember, freshmen, a
smile now may mean a phone call
during next year's sophomore slump.
Just ask a girl who's slumped!
