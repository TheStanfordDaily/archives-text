# MORE FUN RIGHT HERE

the point of view of sal
vage. I don't know how success
ful Friday night's party was, but as
far as introducing a new form of
campus entertainment, it rang all
four alarms.
The whole idea was good. While
there was not quite enough room
for dancing, the committee should
not be blamed, for the crowd was
not in keeping with the usual apathy
toward first-hand free enjoyment.
The skits were good, too. and it is
no criticism to say that they but
scratched the surface of the talent
that is wandering about this cam
pus.
All this adds up to a strong hope
that it will not be long before we
have another such evening with
vaudeville, and with the adjacent
casas opening their social rooms for
dancing.
Take it away Leslie Langnecker
and John La wry.
