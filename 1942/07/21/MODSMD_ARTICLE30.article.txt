# 'Circus' Makes Physics Easy
## 
### ALAN HEDDEN 
In the side of the wall of the phys
ics department's main corridor is a
World's Fair-like display case,
which Pre-Med student Bruce
Meyer describes as "better 'n a
three-ring circus." The cabinet, a
brain child of Dr. Paul Kirkpatriek,
acting head of the department, is
designed to illustrate principles of
physics in a way both tangible and J
attractive to the average student.
At the present time, third dimen
sional effects, as achieved by the
combination of the stereogram with
polaroid, are being shown. The most j
striking example is a miniature
moon, which literally stands out in
front of you like a canteloupe held
at arm's length.
Polarized light, first discovered by
Ruygens about IG7O, has already had
application in the field of photogra
phy, but the possibility of third di
mensional movies outweighs by far
anything previous. Take a look at
these "movies of the future." Then
start dreaming of Shirley Temple in
her third dimensional debut, say
about 1950, war permitting.
The physics department, with this
display cabinet, has Ynade an ad
mirable beginning. But consider the
various possibilities, as suggested by
Pre-Meder Meyer, if the plan were
slightly expanded.
"In the psychology department we
would find mazes of white mice,
showing us why people go crazy.
Over at the Chem Building we could
have Fourth-of-July fireworks ev
ery day. And in the biology depart- j
ment we could pry into the love life
of Ascaris. We could do all this in a j
fascinating way, without having to
take a course in the department and j

without opening a book.
If not carried too far, the plan
would continue to be the success that j
it is. But if carried too far, the en- j
tire student body would soon be
come majors in the "department of
utter confusion'."
