# International Police, World Federation Approved in Poll
## International Police Force, Free Trade, and World Federation Favored 
### GORDON SEVERANCE 
Stanford's student body has approved of measures which, if adopted,
would permanently relegate America's 144-year-old policy of isolation to
the junk pile. According to the Daily poll conducted last Friday, 82 per
cent of the student body are in favor of a world federation equipped wit!:
an international police force, 7!) per cent are willing to surrender some

►of our sovereign lights to such a fed
eration, while 60 per cent favor a
policy of international free trade.
The poll also revealed that the
student body has definite ideas about
the character of the post-war peace
conference. Seventy-six per cent
would not impose any reparations
upon the Axis powers, 71 per cent
prefer a negotiated to a dictated
peace, while 84 per cent are in fa
vor of two peace conferences — a
"cooling off" conference followed by
another conference of final negotia
tions.
The greatest division of opinion
occurred when 52 per cent believed
a world federation should evolve over
a period of time, while 48 per cent
believed that a league should be
established as soon as the smoka
clears away.
OPINIONS DIFFER
Further results of the survey re
vealed a sharp divergence of opin
ion between men and women. A
negotiated peace was favored by 37
per cent of the women compared
with 64 per cent of the men. A fre<3
trade policy was preferred by 70 per
cent of the women, while it was sup
ported by only 55 per cent of the
men.
However, men and women agree#
j almost identically on the necessity of
j a world federation equipped with
i force, the surrender of U.S. sover
| eign rights to the federation, and the
desirability of two peace confer
! ences.
SHOWS CORRELATION
' The survey revealed an interest-
I ing correlation between the amount
j of education the voter had and the
way he answered the questions. A
policy of a high protective tariff wa,;
| favored by only six voters — al
freshman women. The only student
I group favoring a dictated peace
were the freshman men who op
posed negotiation with a majority
| of 59.
The poll of faculty opinion showei
! striking uniformity. Eighty-one pre
ferred a dictated to a negotiated
! peace. Ninety-eight were in favo
of a world federation empowered
with police force, 95 would have a
league of nations established as soon
as the war is over.
