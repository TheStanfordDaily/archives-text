# Science Finds Basis of Hard Liquor Potency
## Stanford Scientists Debunk Soda Water Use as Neutralizer 
### 
It's not the alcohol content, but
ihe "buffers" in liquoi* which affect
:a person's condition.
According to reports by Dr. Henry
Newman and Dr. Mason Abramson
in the current issue of Science, "Hard
liquor makes a man drunk faster
:han wine because the latter con
tains buffers, substances that tend to
neutralize acids and alkalis."
The authors also debunked the
use of soda water as a neutralizer
with whiskey for the reason that
carbonated beverages are all acid
themselves.
LUCKY SUBJECTS
The Stanford scientists based their
results on experiments conducted on
two persons. Straight alcohol, Scotch,
Bourbon, gin, and California port and
burgundy wines were drunk by the
subjects in 10 minutes on empty
stomachs. The concentration of al
cohol was 13 per cent in volume.
Maximum concentration of alcohol
in the blood of test drinker A was
reached in 45 minutes for Scotch, gin,
alcohol and Bourbon. Burgundy
brought maximum concentration in
an hour and a half, and port in two
hours.
Ii GETS FRIED
Test drinker B showed a mild
aversion to distilled liquors which
resulted in mild nausea and a dis
turbed stomach which interfered
with the rapid absorption of these
liquors. As a result, there was no
difference in the times of absorption
of hard liquors and wine.
As further evidence that the buf
fers in the wine are responsible for
its slower absorption into the blood,
the scientists report that when
straight alcohol was buffered to the
same degree as port wine, it was
absorbed at nearly the same rato as
the wine.
