"SABOTEUR," now playing at
the Mayfield.
Having long held as a standard for
comparison the brand of movie which
has herein been referred to as the
"Hitchcock epic," I can now recom
mend the real McCoy, Hitchcock's
latest epic, "Saboteur," which in
cidentally is another for first ten of
the year.
As in "Rebecca" and "Suspicion"
and the whole string of Hitchcock
classics, practically every scene in
"Saboteur" is a painstaken work of
art. From the very opening sequence
the picture is a veritable museum of
unique shots. And the climactic
scene high on the Statue of Liberty's
torch is not only a unique shot but
an exemplary masterpiece of pho
tography, timing, and effect.
And not only the handling of
scenes but their inherent situations
make the action, laid in and between
Los Angeles and New York, a first
rank adventure story. Take the
eerie ghost-town scene near Boul
der Dam, or the circus-train dispute
over the fugitive's fate between the
human skeleton and a midget, or
any number of other striking situ
ations. Add to them a profound
subtlety of dialog, a past mastery of
construction, and an uncanny inte
gration of all the sub-arts of mo
tion picture production. Whether
the acting is good (and it is) is not
as important as that, it is one per
fected element of a picture utilizing
every phase of production in per
fected form.
