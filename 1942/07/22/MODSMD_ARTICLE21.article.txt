CTATUS QUO—"DE MESS WE IS NO\V IN":
1 Professor Harold S. Quigley, lecturing at Stanford this summer, re
marked in one of his classes recently that that's how a Negro preacher
defined the status quo.
"Itides to Paly" is hereby statusquoed likewise.

At any rate, a Stanford football
player, easily visible for at least 400
yards in his bright red Block S
sweater, sighed a throaty sigh and
hoofed it while six beautiful cars,
driven by six competent and per
haps beautiful (he couldn't see they
went by so fast) Stanford women,
whizzed right by.
Why no co-operation?
Admitted it's difficult for a girl to
stop to pick up a stranger on the
highway. But a Stanford man in a
Stanford sweater can hardly be
missed.
Wise up, gals, and give the guys
a lift.
