# WHY NOT A PRECEDENT?
## 
### 
Back at Empire City race course
in New York a lotta bettors were
ranting at a nag by the name of
Notes.
"I hate you, Dmitri Notes," they
were saying, in words of several
syllables.
Notes, a noble three-year-old,
running in the second race on the

program, refused to break from his
stall when the bell rang and the
electric barrier was sprung. He was
a $2.90-1 shot, and a lot of fans had
plunked two bucks down on him.
When stewards at the track
called the race official after some
other horse had won and decided

that no tickets sold on Notes would
be refunded, the crowd swarmed
out onto the track and yelled for
blood.
Now it's an established racing rule
that once a horse goes to the post
and is declared a starter, no tickets
sold on him will be refunded unless
he is subsequently declared out by
the stewards for one thing or an
other, or the bars across his stall re
fuse to open with the rest.
Apparently Note's stall opened
with the rest of the field, so all was
legal and correct as far as inter
preting racing rules was concerned.
But: why couldn't the stewards
start a precedent and refund tick
ets on Notes anyway?
Pity the poor two-buck bettor,
who sometimes suffers apoplexy try
ing to dope out a winner to lose his
deuce on, and then has to see his
horse get stalled in the stall.
'Twould be far better for horse
racing to do the bettor a good turn
for change. He, who takes pot luck
on how a horse feels, looks, and
finishes.

stall when the bell rang and the
electric barrier was sprung. He was
a $2.90-1 shot, and a lot of fans had
plunked two bucks down on him.
When stewards at the track
called the race official after some
other horse had won and decided

that no tickets sold on Notes would
be refunded, the crowd swarmed
out onto the track and yelled for
blood.
Now it's an established racing rule
that once a horse goes to the post
and is declared a starter, no tickets
sold on him will be refunded unless
he is subsequently declared out by
the stewards for one thing or an
other, or the bars across his stall re
fuse to open with the rest.
Apparently Note's stall opened
with the rest of the field, so all was
legal and correct as far as inter
preting racing rules was concerned.
But: why couldn't the stewards
start a precedent and refund tick
ets on Notes anyway?
Pity the poor two-buck bettor,
who sometimes suffers apoplexy try
ing to dope out a winner to lose his
deuce on, and then has to see his
horse get stalled in the stall.
'Twould be far better for horse
racing to do the bettor a good turn
for change. He, who takes pot luck
on how a horse feels, looks, and
finishes.

A tropical fruit of Brazil, jaboti
caba, grows out from the bark of
the tree.
