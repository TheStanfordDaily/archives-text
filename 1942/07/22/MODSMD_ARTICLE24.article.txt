# Harry Booth Hurls No-Hitter; Army, Slave Drivers Victors
## 
### 
While the undefeated Slave Driv
ers and U.S. Army teams swept on
ward toward their crucial game for
the championship of League B,
Harry Booth hurled a no-hitter yes
terday to pace the Alpha Sig-Theta
Chi combine to a 6-3 victory over
the Fijis. Loose fielding in the outer
gardens accounted for the losers'
counters.
The Slave Drivers rolled over the
Biz Wigs, 6-1, as skinny Marsh
Weigel's throwing failed to fool the
faculty. Big hitters for the Bawlout
bunglers were Art Wells, Red Hol
man and Bob Morris. Meanwhile,
the Drivers' arch-rivals from Page
Mill Road overpowered the O'Reil
leys, 13-1. Ellis Mahan allowed the
O'Reilleys only three hits, while the
khaki-clad lads banged out an even
dozen blows.
After dropping their opening con
test of the season, Encina 11-111
checked in with their fourth straight
triumph yesterday, 7-5, over Chi
Psi. John Paulis and Herb Eggel
ston led the freshmen, who have es
tablished themselves as the top choicc
to win the League A pennant.
The Spar Ducks waited until the
last inning to come from behind anc
nose out the Socialists, 7-6. Gabc
Hausladen and Art Miller, Spai
Duck battery, starred for the win
ners, with Hausladen knocking in the
tying run and Decker socking in the
winning marker. Ewarts sparked the
losers.
Getting off behind the eight-bal
when the Upper Row countered five
times, Lower Row rallied in the
final frame to score twice on Bal
this' homer with one mate aboarc
and tie the score, 7-7. The game wil
be played off sometime this week.
Second-year Medics deserted thei:

y scalpels and the Pied Typers their
i typewriters as the latter team
I marked up its first win of the sea
son, 8-7. The doctors and journal
i ists celebrated their get-together
i with such ungentlemanly conduct as
blocking base-runners and holding
fielders.
The Mcnlo Oaks also registered
i their initial win of the year by
whipping the Cutters, 3-1. Bleck,
Oak i nfielder, clouted three hits.
The Alpha Delts rallied from the
short end of an 0-6 score to nip En
cina IV-V, 11-10.
