# War Sense
## 
### 
LAST night Excom moved to
strengthen its policy of cen
tralizing all social life on the
rampus by approving a free
open-air dance in Union Court
on August 1.
The outstanding success of
last Friday's Scavenger Hunt
proved that Stanford will back
an inexpensive on-campus so
cial function. By providing an
attractive substitute on the cam
pus for the bright lights of the
rity and dark corners "down
the road," Excom displayed the
kind of sense we appreciate
during a war.â€”Charlie Allen
