### BILL STEIF 
'JPHE United States has not yet
produced a first-rate hero in
this war. Mac Arthur idolators will
no doubt immediately jump down
my throat for that statement but
the fact remains that heroes, to be
true heroes in my book at least, must
be victorious. Mac Arthur and Mac-
Arthur's men put up a valiant battle
on Bataan and, though they won
many individual struggles, they lost
the campaign. Since then, of course,
some of the furor concerning the
none-too-taciturn Mac Arthur has
died down, very possibly because the
Australian front seems to have been
relegated to a somewhat secondary
position.
Admiral Nimitz might qualify
for the hero's niche, hut. despite
his apparently simple, courageous,
and thoughtful qualities, the Bat
tle of Midway was not exactly the
total victory that our press repre
sented it to he since the Japs did
get into the outer fringe of the
Aleutians at the time that the good
admiral was annihilating a part of
the Nipponese fleet.
Of course, we have produced many
minor heroes, sterling men like John
Bulkeley and Colin Kelly, but these
men were not in positions to do the
immensely difficult work of planning
and leading a successful campaign,
and so, while their valor and intel
ligence must be readily admitted,
their deeds hardly qualify them as
national heroes.
* * #
HPHIS, obviously, is what we are
looking for. We need a man who
can plan and carry out a successful
campaign on a large scale, a man
who at least can be compared to
Napoleon, a man like Pershing or
Dewey or Grant or Washington. Thus
far we have produced no such man,
I believe, because in the 7M> months
in which we have been at war we
have almost exclusively back-ped
aled.
Reports from London, however,
seem to indicate that there is a fair
ly decent chance, at least, of getting
our national hero within the next
month or month and a half. This
is because the necessity— not the op
portunity particularly, but the neces
sity—of a second front is becoming
more and more apparent.
The Soviet is fighting desperate
ly along the Don. In the north
around Voronezh the Russians are
scoring some minor victories, hut
let it be emphasized that these are
only minor. In the south the Nazis
are gaining great chunks of land at
the expense of the Reds and with
every hour are coming closer to
Rostov. The Germans, further
more. are biting into Russian
ground more and more to the east.
The Russians are locked in mortal
struggle and right now seem to he
on the long end of the odds. The
surest indication of this. I think, is
that the Japs are massing large
numbers of troops along the Sibe
rian frontier in preparation for
what may he a dagger-in-the-hack
act reminiscent of Mussolini's stab
at France early in June. 1940.

OUT in London British and Amer
ican military leaders have been
holding a series of conferences which
can concern only the second front.
To save Russia that front is appar
ently a necessity. It will be the most
important move the Allies have
made since the United States en
tered the war. That is for sure. The
problem of where —in Norway or
France—the blow will come belongs
to the military. But the problem of
when is a problem which most
Americans should be able to answer
right now because it is obvious that
right now, when the ally which has
done most of our fighting thus far
in the war is in danger of utter de
feat, is the time to open a second
front. Supplies will be a heckuva
problem, no doubt, since we have al
ready lost over 400 merchant ships
in the Atlantic alone and are not

building ships fast enough to replace
our losses, but this is just one more
difficulty which our coming genuine
hero will surmount.
It's a cinch that we must have that
hero—and soon.

right now, when the ally which has
done most of our fighting thus far
in the war is in danger of utter de
feat, is the time to open a second
front. Supplies will be a heckuva
problem, no doubt, since we have al
ready lost over 400 merchant ships
in the Atlantic alone and are not

building ships fast enough to replace
our losses, but this is just one more
difficulty which our coming genuine
hero will surmount.
It's a cinch that we must have that
hero—and soon.
'JPHE United States has not yet
produced a first-rate hero in
this war. Mac Arthur idolators will
no doubt immediately jump down
my throat for that statement but
the fact remains that heroes, to be
true heroes in my book at least, must
be victorious. Mac Arthur and Mac-
Arthur's men put up a valiant battle
on Bataan and, though they won
many individual struggles, they lost
the campaign. Since then, of course,
some of the furor concerning the
none-too-taciturn Mac Arthur has
died down, very possibly because the
Australian front seems to have been
relegated to a somewhat secondary
position.
Admiral Nimitz might qualify
for the hero's niche, hut. despite
his apparently simple, courageous,
and thoughtful qualities, the Bat
tle of Midway was not exactly the
total victory that our press repre
sented it to he since the Japs did
get into the outer fringe of the
Aleutians at the time that the good
admiral was annihilating a part of
the Nipponese fleet.
Of course, we have produced many
minor heroes, sterling men like John
Bulkeley and Colin Kelly, but these
men were not in positions to do the
immensely difficult work of planning
and leading a successful campaign,
and so, while their valor and intel
ligence must be readily admitted,
their deeds hardly qualify them as
national heroes.

HPHIS, obviously, is what we are
looking for. We need a man who
can plan and carry out a successful
campaign on a large scale, a man
who at least can be compared to
Napoleon, a man like Pershing or
Dewey or Grant or Washington. Thus
far we have produced no such man,
I believe, because in the 7M> months
in which we have been at war we
have almost exclusively back-ped
aled.
Reports from London, however,
seem to indicate that there is a fair
ly decent chance, at least, of getting
our national hero within the next
month or month and a half. This
is because the necessity— not the op
portunity particularly, but the neces
sity—of a second front is becoming
more and more apparent.
The Soviet is fighting desperate
ly along the Don. In the north
around Voronezh the Russians are
scoring some minor victories, hut
let it be emphasized that these are
only minor. In the south the Nazis
are gaining great chunks of land at
the expense of the Reds and with
every hour are coming closer to
Rostov. The Germans, further
more. are biting into Russian
ground more and more to the east.
The Russians are locked in mortal
struggle and right now seem to he
on the long end of the odds. The
surest indication of this. I think, is
that the Japs are massing large
numbers of troops along the Sibe
rian frontier in preparation for
what may he a dagger-in-the-hack
act reminiscent of Mussolini's stab
at France early in June. 1940.

OUT in London British and Amer
ican military leaders have been
holding a series of conferences which
can concern only the second front.
To save Russia that front is appar
ently a necessity. It will be the most
important move the Allies have
made since the United States en
tered the war. That is for sure. The
problem of where —in Norway or
France—the blow will come belongs
to the military. But the problem of
when is a problem which most
Americans should be able to answer
right now because it is obvious that
right now, when the ally which has
done most of our fighting thus far
in the war is in danger of utter de
feat, is the time to open a second
front. Supplies will be a heckuva
problem, no doubt, since we have al
ready lost over 400 merchant ships
in the Atlantic alone and are not

building ships fast enough to replace
our losses, but this is just one more
difficulty which our coming genuine
hero will surmount.
It's a cinch that we must have that
hero—and soon.
'JPHE United States has not yet
produced a first-rate hero in
this war. Mac Arthur idolators will
no doubt immediately jump down
my throat for that statement but
the fact remains that heroes, to be
true heroes in my book at least, must
be victorious. Mac Arthur and Mac-
Arthur's men put up a valiant battle
on Bataan and, though they won
many individual struggles, they lost
the campaign. Since then, of course,
some of the furor concerning the
none-too-taciturn Mac Arthur has
died down, very possibly because the
Australian front seems to have been
relegated to a somewhat secondary
position.
Admiral Nimitz might qualify
for the hero's niche, hut. despite
his apparently simple, courageous,
and thoughtful qualities, the Bat
tle of Midway was not exactly the
total victory that our press repre
sented it to he since the Japs did
get into the outer fringe of the
Aleutians at the time that the good
admiral was annihilating a part of
the Nipponese fleet.
Of course, we have produced many
minor heroes, sterling men like John
Bulkeley and Colin Kelly, but these
men were not in positions to do the
immensely difficult work of planning
and leading a successful campaign,
and so, while their valor and intel
ligence must be readily admitted,
their deeds hardly qualify them as
national heroes.

HPHIS, obviously, is what we are
looking for. We need a man who
can plan and carry out a successful
campaign on a large scale, a man
who at least can be compared to
Napoleon, a man like Pershing or
Dewey or Grant or Washington. Thus
far we have produced no such man,
I believe, because in the 7M> months
in which we have been at war we
have almost exclusively back-ped
aled.
Reports from London, however,
seem to indicate that there is a fair
ly decent chance, at least, of getting
our national hero within the next
month or month and a half. This
is because the necessity— not the op
portunity particularly, but the neces
sity—of a second front is becoming
more and more apparent.
The Soviet is fighting desperate
ly along the Don. In the north
around Voronezh the Russians are
scoring some minor victories, hut
let it be emphasized that these are
only minor. In the south the Nazis
are gaining great chunks of land at
the expense of the Reds and with
every hour are coming closer to
Rostov. The Germans, further
more. are biting into Russian
ground more and more to the east.
The Russians are locked in mortal
struggle and right now seem to he
on the long end of the odds. The
surest indication of this. I think, is
that the Japs are massing large
numbers of troops along the Sibe
rian frontier in preparation for
what may he a dagger-in-the-hack
act reminiscent of Mussolini's stab
at France early in June. 1940.
