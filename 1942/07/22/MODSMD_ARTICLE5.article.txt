# String Quartet Concludes Series
## 
### 
The London String Quartet ended
the last of its series of five Stanford
concerts in Memorial Hall last night
—a series in all respects successful,
reaching its high point last week
with the Beethoven "Harp" and the
Mozart "Hunt" quartets.
Other than that the players exe
cuted the full program without a
hitch in ensemble 01* intonation,
little remains to be said of their per
formance, which was of the finest to
be heard anywhere.
Randall Thompson's folktune-fla
vored, largely danceable D Minor
quartet suffered not the slightest for
being sandwiched between Beet
hoven and Haydn. In fact, when
Hollywood finally recognizes the
possibilities of chamber music for
movie background, this Thompson
quartet is the type that will be their
best bet.—Covey
