performance of "Daisies on the Cartracks" by Alladine Bell.
The story concerns a family in Idaho and what happens when the
father (Paul Hosteller) decides that the time has come for he and his wife
(Joyce Henderson) to have another honeymoon.

The problem is to get the college
age children out of the way. The son
(Bob Ashley) refuses to go to col
lege, and the father seems to be un
able to get the daughter (Marcia

sulting developments supply the play
with plenty of laughs.
