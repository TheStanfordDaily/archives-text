# Opening Night Proves 'Daisies' Topnotch Play
## Farm Actors Excel In Amusing Comedy At Memorial Hall 
### 
"Daisies on the Car Tracks" is
excellent light entertainment, well
written, and well acted. It doesn't
pretend to solve any big problems,
but it does present its story of the
difficulties of a small town family in
a fast-moving laugh-crammed com
edy, which is all that is asked of it.
The characters are well cast, and
every one of them is right in char
acter. Bob Ashley does an Andy
Hardy that can show Rooney how
that type of part ought to be done;
he plays the part of an adolescent,
sincerely and well.
Marcia Shaughnessy gives her
usual competent performance, while
Joyce Henderson is excellent as the
somewhat impractical mother. Don
Ligget and Malcolm MacKillop are
convincing as the suitors —loser and
winner, respectively. Ligget comes
through well in the difficult part of
a grown-up "boy scout," producing
a flat monotone which fits in well
with the character.
LOVE-INTEREST
Marthe Halbach "looks capable'*
in the part of the omniscient country
aunt, which requires just that. Jo
Sawyer was good as the juvenile
love-interest.
The Players have difficulty with
their elderly men; Paul Hostetler has
all the mannerisms down pat, but
looks too youthful, and Nicolas Vo
gulkin, in a less important part,
really looks old. Vogulkin seems to
overdo the character, though; he
seems almost make-believe.
SENTIMENTAL ENDING
Alladine Bell has a good play; its
rapid movement clear down to the
pleasingly sentimental ending keeps
the audience interested—to the ex
tent of three curtain calls and a lib
eral demand for another.
The title phrase, "Daisies on the
Car Tracks," a homey adaptation of
"diamonds in the dust," supposedly,
misses fire; perhaps the original
title, "C.0.D.," might have been
better.
