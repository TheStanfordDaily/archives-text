### BOB SONTAG 
pOOTBALL SHOULD BE RE-, NOT DE-EMPHASIZED:
Some guy said the other clay that football didn't deserve to he sup
ported during the war. It should he de-emphasized, he said.
Football should he re-, not de-emphasized.
Maybe he thought the value of competitive sports in preparing hoys
to become soldiers has been overdone.
We don't think so.
The soldiers of every nation have something to fight for. A fighting
spirit in war can be aided and stimulated by a fighting spirit conceived

<011 the gridiron.
It may be called flag-waving by
some, but sports-mad America's will
;o win is a motivating factor that
must not be lost, especially in these
times.
Americans are rotten losers. Swell.
They hate like hell to run second in
anything, even though they are usu
ally gracious enough not to show that
trait when it's only a game.
And this war is the greatest game
of all. Strategy, flanking, hard driv
ing are all a part of it, and they are
all a part of football. A national
game that swells national spirit must
be maintained.
Physical fitness programs at
American schools that take the form
of gym classes and intramural sports
are largely financed by the receipts
from fall football games.
Making physical education com
pulsory itself is a great builder of
physical fitness, and to keep tip the
bigger than normal classes calls
for more teachers and more equip
ment.
Stanford has already moved Iwo
of its games to San Francisco, and
negotiations are under way for a
ihird. A1 Masters, graduate man
ager of the 8.A.C., has been confer
ring with Jimmy Needles, U.S.F.
athletic director, for the last week.
An announcement on the Stanford-
Southern California game, which is
under consideration, should be forth
coming this week.
Masters' idea in moving the Santa
Clara and Washington, and Southern
California games to Kezar is two
fold:
1. To keep gate receipts at a
level which will maintain active
programs of both intercollegiate
and intramural sports.
2. To take the game to the fans
without overtaxing the already
pressed transportation problem.
We're sure that Stanford as well
as other schools will be sincerely
eager to do all it can to support war
charities to the utmost of its ability.
Service organizations cannot expect
the impossible from college ath

letics. They must see to it that both
the press and public alike do not
misinterpret or misjudge.
So we say support football like
anything else that directly or indi
rectly will help win the war.

pOOTBALL SHOULD BE RE-, NOT DE-EMPHASIZED:
Some guy said the other clay that football didn't deserve to he sup
ported during the war. It should he de-emphasized, he said.
Football should he re-, not de-emphasized.
Maybe he thought the value of competitive sports in preparing hoys
to become soldiers has been overdone.
We don't think so.
The soldiers of every nation have something to fight for. A fighting
spirit in war can be aided and stimulated by a fighting spirit conceived

<011 the gridiron.
It may be called flag-waving by
some, but sports-mad America's will
;o win is a motivating factor that
must not be lost, especially in these
times.
Americans are rotten losers. Swell.
They hate like hell to run second in
anything, even though they are usu
ally gracious enough not to show that
trait when it's only a game.
And this war is the greatest game
of all. Strategy, flanking, hard driv
ing are all a part of it, and they are
all a part of football. A national
game that swells national spirit must
be maintained.
Physical fitness programs at
American schools that take the form
of gym classes and intramural sports
are largely financed by the receipts
from fall football games.
Making physical education com
pulsory itself is a great builder of
physical fitness, and to keep tip the
bigger than normal classes calls
for more teachers and more equip
ment.
Stanford has already moved Iwo
of its games to San Francisco, and
negotiations are under way for a
ihird. A1 Masters, graduate man
ager of the 8.A.C., has been confer
ring with Jimmy Needles, U.S.F.
athletic director, for the last week.
An announcement on the Stanford-
Southern California game, which is
under consideration, should be forth
coming this week.
Masters' idea in moving the Santa
Clara and Washington, and Southern
California games to Kezar is two
fold:
1. To keep gate receipts at a
level which will maintain active
programs of both intercollegiate
and intramural sports.
2. To take the game to the fans
without overtaxing the already
pressed transportation problem.
We're sure that Stanford as well
as other schools will be sincerely
eager to do all it can to support war
charities to the utmost of its ability.
Service organizations cannot expect
the impossible from college ath

letics. They must see to it that both
the press and public alike do not
misinterpret or misjudge.
