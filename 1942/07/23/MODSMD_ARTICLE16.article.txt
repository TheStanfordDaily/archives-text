wildly swinging Braves. Indian ac

two runs and three hits being
scored, and the three outs being

Kuklo again dropping three of the
Stanford men. Came the sixth inn
ing and Art Shafer relieved Harry
Mason on the Farm mound, the
Army men immediately scoring two

last inning played, leaving the Army
one point behind the Indians, whose
runs were made in the first, third,
fourth, and fifth innings.

posed to the Army's five, with the
Indian pitchers Mason and Shafer
