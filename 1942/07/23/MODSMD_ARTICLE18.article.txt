# U. S. Army and Slave Drivers Clash in Intramural Headliner
## 
### ZIP WALT 
In today's game between the U.S. Army and the Slave Drivers, both
undefeated with five wins, lies the fate and destiny of League B.
Both teams have met all opposition with case, and today's victor may
very well turn out to be the champion of Harry Shipkey's Summer Quarter

Softball League.
When the teams take the field on
Diamond 8 at 5 o'clock, the Army
boys of Page Mill will have three
capable men that can take the
mound: Ellis Mahan, Ace Stovall,
Whizzer Kopitzke. Mahan has had
little trouble in his four starting ap
pearances, and his teammates usually
build up a commanding lead so that
Stovall can relieve him. Kopitzke's
only appearance was a two-hit, 6-0
shutout over the third-place Spar
Ducks.
Woody Weir has shown fine con
trol for the Slave Drivers, very rarely
allowing a free pass. This is coupled
with speed and a good curve. John
Bunn, sparkplug of the infield, is his
battery mate. ClifT Wells pitched the
12-3 win over the Cutters.
GOOD SUPPORT
Weir has good support in the field,
with such men as Harry Shipkey,
Charles Winterburn, Pete Couch,
and Red Holman.
Encina 11-111, the hottest team in
League A, is paired off against the
Fiji squad that has a record of two
wins against three defeats.
Alpha Delt, co-leaders of the
league with the Encina team, faces
the pitching of Harry Booth, who is
fresh from a sparkling no-hit tri
umph over the Fijis. Bud Wood
ward will oppose Booth, and has a
slight advantage due to a strong in
field led by Dave Doud and Bud
Crary.
CELLAR BATTLE
A battle for the cellar position of
League B takes place when the Pied
Typers and the Menlo Oaks square
off. Due to the strong hitting of
Mike Kresge, George Tolman, and
Louie Sloss. the Typers are favored
to win another game.
Encina IB and Encina IV-V de
feated in every game this season,
also fight it out for cellar suprem
acy today in League A.
Spar Ducks should have little
trouble with the lowly O'Reilly's.
The squad is paced by Al Lewis,
former semi-pro player; Art Miller,
'32 and former Stanford catcher,
playing on the last Farm team that
won the conference championship.
Ned Johns, former Cardinal pole
vaulter, and Lyle Reynolds, Califor
nia track captain in '34, complete the
strong infield.
The Navajo word for motorcycle
means "son of an automobile."
