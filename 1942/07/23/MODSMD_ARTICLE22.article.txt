### 
The informal open-air dance which
was scheduled for the Union Court
on August 1 and was okayed by Ex
ecutive Committee Tuesday night
was postponed by that body in a
telephone poll yesterday.
''We found out after Excom meet
ing that there was a meeting of the

Dramatists' Alliance scheduled for
the Women's Clubhouse that night,"
Leslie Langnecker, A.S.S.U. vice
president, said yesterday.
The dance, which is to be spon
sored by the A.S.S.U. and Cardinals,
has been granted a new date, Aug
ust 15, the same day on which the
Cardinal-sponsored play-day is to
be held. Despite the fact that these
two functions are on the same day,
they will be separate affairs, accord
ing to Miss Langnecker.
