# Toward Less Confusion

BREAKFAST has always been
a hard thing to enjoy be
fore 8 o'clock classes, but most
experts agree that even a glass
of milk or a few pieces of toast
will give the student energy to
carry on through the long
stretch of morning classes.
However, most persons do
not get up until 7 a.m. at the
earliest. This gives them an
hour to get dressed, shower,
'ead the morning paper, and
get something to eat. Ordinarily
breakfast can be eaten in less
than 15 minutesâ€”that is at any
Dther place but Stanford.
Our situation is unique, more
so in the summer because many
visiting professors and dining
'oomless fraternity men find the
Union Cellar the most conve
nient place to get a bite to eat.
But why should breakfast in
the Cellar take close to half an
hour?
Obviously labor is a precious
irticle these days, and once se
cured it is not easy to hold onto.
Granted that, and granted that
many more persons are being
.served earlier this quarter, it is
still difficult to see why some
"truly satisfactory arrangement
cannot be worked out.
First, there should be some
order of service. The fellow
who is taller and bigger and can
muscle his way through the
crowd at the service counter
las a definite advantage over
he four-foot eight-inch blue
eyed frosh girl who never gets
anything to eat until 10 even
though she helps open the place
<n the morning.
Second, a cafeteria arrange
ment could very easily be ar
ranged with little or no extra
work. The far side of the coun
ter, to the left of the service
counter, could be used with
cereals, orange juice, milk, cof
fee, breakfast rolls, eggs, and
waffles as standing items on a
good, simple, wholesome menu.
This cafeteria system would
solve two of the present evils:
the order-of-service difficulty
and the labor shortage prob
lem. Naturally, persons would
have to stand in line. At first
this might be too big a change
for some of our wild-eyed early
risers, but they would soon get
used to the plan and undoubt
edly learn to like it. As for the
labor shortage, it would only
take two hashers at the most to
keep the crowd moving.
Maybe this arrangement
would lead to a healthier stu
dent body and to a more pro
found understanding of 8
o'clock lectures.
