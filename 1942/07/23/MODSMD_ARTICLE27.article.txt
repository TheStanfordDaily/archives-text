### MIKE CHURCHILL 
AN OPENED
LETTER
j UJJEAR BULL SESSION:
"Your editorial columns, con-
I corned with the NO-SMOKE tradi
tion, feel that this applies almost
anywhere, and make no distinction
between outer and inner quads.
''This is reading meaning into the
j tradition that is not there. The tra
dition applies only to the inner quad,
and by courtesy perhaps to the Me
morial Court.
"In the first week that Stanford
j was open the students unanimously
| voted, in appreciation to Mrs. Stan
j ford, to refrain from smoking on the
i quad. There was then only what we
j now know as the inner quad. Not
j even the chapel had been built.
"At that time it was all right to
; step off the quad (i.e., the inner
quad) onto what is now the outer
i quad to smoke.

OUTER QUAD BUILT
LATER
UrpHIS habit didn't change as the
Ad Building and the Assem
bly Hall (now the Business School)
were added in 1898, the Memorial
Arch (just two pillars since the
earthquake), the Physiology Build
ing, and Jordan Hall in 1899, the En
gineering Corner in 1902, and the
Geology Corner in 1904.
"In order that these buildings
might be properly and economically
insured, smoking was forbidden (not
voted out as a gesture of thanks) in
the outer quad.
"This did not constitute an ex
pansion of the tradition, and to con
sider it as such would be as illogical
as extending the tradition to the
Library steps, an idea no more in
consistent with the tradition than
including the outer quad.
<i * #
LAW STUDENTS
CHANGE
old tradition that no girl
ever uses the Law Steps arose
because the law students then came
out onto the outer quad to smoke.
This tradition has all but disap
peared now that the neophyte law
yers choose to smoke in the inner
quad.
"Frankly, I can see no support to
the criticism of smoking on the eol
lonade from the Engineering to the
| English Corner, and in front of the
Ad Building. These are much trav
i elled arteries that have come into
! use since the custom was instituted
and it would seem that with you a
i tradition is turning into an obses
! sion.

I MUST ADMIT
I DO AGREE
r pHIS column does not like to see
smr.king on the inner quad. It
: is the column of my boss, the editor,
! over to the left that takes the larger
viewpoint.
The above letter is not printed to
i start a controversy, but merely to
shed some light on an unsettled ques
j tion. It is a worth while tradition
| nnd should be abandoned. It is
being weakened by the uncertainty
1 as to its application. Perhaps a reso
lution from Excom or a statement
I from Chancellor Wilbur would clear
i up the whole matter.

of the power of that li'l ole column,
which, next to Daily Classifieds and
History '42. is the best read feature

I B.A.C. took them back for inven

AN OPENED
LETTER
j UJJEAR BULL SESSION:
"Your editorial columns, con-
I corned with the NO-SMOKE tradi
tion, feel that this applies almost
anywhere, and make no distinction
between outer and inner quads.
''This is reading meaning into the
j tradition that is not there. The tra
dition applies only to the inner quad,
and by courtesy perhaps to the Me
morial Court.
"In the first week that Stanford
j was open the students unanimously
| voted, in appreciation to Mrs. Stan
j ford, to refrain from smoking on the
i quad. There was then only what we
j now know as the inner quad. Not
j even the chapel had been built.
"At that time it was all right to
; step off the quad (i.e., the inner
quad) onto what is now the outer
i quad to smoke.

OUTER QUAD BUILT
LATER
UrpHIS habit didn't change as the
Ad Building and the Assem
bly Hall (now the Business School)
were added in 1898, the Memorial
Arch (just two pillars since the
earthquake), the Physiology Build
ing, and Jordan Hall in 1899, the En
gineering Corner in 1902, and the
Geology Corner in 1904.
"In order that these buildings
might be properly and economically
insured, smoking was forbidden (not
voted out as a gesture of thanks) in
the outer quad.
"This did not constitute an ex
pansion of the tradition, and to con
sider it as such would be as illogical
as extending the tradition to the
Library steps, an idea no more in
consistent with the tradition than
including the outer quad.
<i * #
LAW STUDENTS
CHANGE
old tradition that no girl
ever uses the Law Steps arose
because the law students then came
out onto the outer quad to smoke.
This tradition has all but disap
peared now that the neophyte law
yers choose to smoke in the inner
quad.
"Frankly, I can see no support to
the criticism of smoking on the eol
lonade from the Engineering to the
| English Corner, and in front of the
Ad Building. These are much trav
i elled arteries that have come into
! use since the custom was instituted
and it would seem that with you a
i tradition is turning into an obses
! sion.

I MUST ADMIT
I DO AGREE
r pHIS column does not like to see
smr.king on the inner quad. It
: is the column of my boss, the editor,
! over to the left that takes the larger
viewpoint.
The above letter is not printed to
i start a controversy, but merely to
shed some light on an unsettled ques
j tion. It is a worth while tradition
| nnd should be abandoned. It is
being weakened by the uncertainty
1 as to its application. Perhaps a reso
lution from Excom or a statement
I from Chancellor Wilbur would clear
i up the whole matter.

THEY'VE
GONE
r HEN I saw that the lemonade set
j that a great Stanford team won
; in 1928 had been taken out of the
Cellar, I was. to put it mildly,
; elated.

of the power of that li'l ole column,
