# Military Set-up To Be Outlined
## 
### 
All Stanford students who have
not as yet definitely signed up with
some branch of the service are
strongly urged to attend the meeting
in the auditorium of the Education
Building tonight at 7. New changes
in the military set-up for college
students will be gone over.
Dean John Bunn has recently re
turned from San Francisco where he
conferred with a board composed of
Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Coast
Guard, Army Air Force, and Naval
Air Force officers. They discussed
new changes in the system which
will effect the college careers of
nearly every underclassman.
Freshman corridor meetings which
are usually held Thursday evenings
have been called off in order that all
Encina men will be able to attend
this vital meeting.
The chief feature of the meeting
will be an explanation of the new
Army Reserve classification which
will allow college men to complete
their course before going on active
duty. After the student has received
his degree he enters the Army as a
draftee but is assured an opportunity
to attend Officer's Training School.
