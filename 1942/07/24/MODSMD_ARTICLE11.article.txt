### 
Next week's Tuesday Evening
Series program will feature a lec
ture on "Scientific Diversions" by
Arthur C. Pillsbury, noted photog
rapher and botanist. The lecture will
be given at 8 p.m. in Memorial Hall.
Mr. Pillsbury will use colored mo
tion pictures taken by special proc
esses to tell the story of movement
and growth in plants. Included in his
picture will be flowers of California,
both wild and cultivated, and those
of Hawaii, Suva. Samoa, Panama,
Colombia, and Jamaica, which he
photographed on his various trips.
Mr. Pillsbury has secured these
visual records of plant life by the
use of microscopes, cameras, a mo
tor gear mechanism, and numerous
other devices of his own invention,
including a special camera that
takes X-ray motion pictures of plants
during their growth. He is able, by
the use of 600 pictures, to show in
detail the birth of a lily—a process
which takes but 25 seconds.
