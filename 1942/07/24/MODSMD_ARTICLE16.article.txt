### 
Jimmy Pollard, one of tallest
members of Stanford's N.C.A.A. bas
ketball champs, saved the game for
the Stanford Laundry the other
night. He tipped in the shot that
tied the score with seconds to go,
tipped in another to match the visi
tors' goal in the first overtime pe
riod, then passed to Hugh West for
the winning goal in the final extra
session.
