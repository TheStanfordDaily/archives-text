# T FORMATION OR SINGLE WING?
## 
### 
It isn't too early to talk about it, mebbe. Will Stanford switch to a
single wing this fall in place of the terrific T?
Some say no. some say yes:
We say blow your horn and guess.
The T needs an aleVt, speedy, field-marshalling quarterback. Right
now Stanford has three quarterbacks, none brilliant, but all capable: Ray
Hammett, Neele Johnston, and Bobby Andrews. Of the three Hammett is
probably the most experienced. But whether he can do with quarterback

exactly what Frankie Albert and Al-
Cole did is something for time and
Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz to
decide.
In the first place it is questionable
whether or not Hammett will return
to school. He expects to be drafted
this summer while at the same time
he has applied for appointment in
the Army Enlisted Reserve. If he is
drafted it will be up to Johnston
and Andrews.
When Stanford lost Jim Pettit, it
lost its fastest halfback and the man
who was. to take Pete Kmetovic's
spot on those flankers and man-in
motion plays where intense speed is
the answer.
When Stanford lost Hoot Arm
strong. if it has, as some rumors
would have it, more speed went with
him.
On the other side of the picture
is this: could the single wing he
taught in the short time between
practice and the first game Oct. 2?
Definitely not. Although the sys
tem is easier and less intricate, it
couldn't be done in that short
space of time.
Stanford still has speed in 148-
pound AI Hoisch. It has a very fast
fullback in the person of Randall
"Buck" Fawcett. It has another
fairly fast and greatly underrated
halfback in Bill Sheller.
The blocking question. Stanford
uses finesse blocking, has used it

for two years under Clark Shaugh
nessy and the T. Stanford hasn't
tasted the big. bone-crusher blocks
that go along with single wing.
Another thing. Spectators want
spectator football. The single wing
partly destroys that fiashiness and
the zany plays that go hand in hand
with the T.
