# TIP PASSED OUT:
## 
### 
We once got a hot tip from a guy
at a hoss track on a nag named Sea
Witch.
We laid down two clackers on her.
In a mile and eighth tour, Sea
Witch broke last and was running
there as the horses came by the
stands the first time. Suddenly she
made her move.
She moved right up on the heels
of the horse in front of her, fell
down, and broke her neck. Moral:
stay home and save everything
you've got.
