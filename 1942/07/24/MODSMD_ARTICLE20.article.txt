# Mohan's 3-Hitter Handcuffs Slave Drivers, 4-1
## Doughboys Leading B League; Booth's Hurling Nets 8-3 Win 
### ZIP WALT 
Behind the three-hit pitching of Ellis Malum, the U.S. Army team moved
into sole possession of League B with a hard-fought 4-1 triumph over the
Slave Drivers yesterday.
Cliff Wells used his slow-breaking curve ball to good advantage, but
two errors and two misplayed balls meant the difference between a close

game and a chance for a win. Woody*
Weir moved out into the roving
short position in a strategy move, j
thinking that Wells' slow ball pitch
ing would he more effective than
Weir's fast control ball hurling.
Mahan and Wells were deadlocked
until the fourth at 1-1. Then errors
came that proved costly to the fac
ulty men from the School of Health.
ENCINA 11-111 WINS
Those amazing freshmen for floors
11-111 of Encina moved into first
place of League A as they measured
the Fijis while the Alpha Delts
dropped their game to Harry Booth
and the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi team.
Encina 11-111 holds this league lead
because of a tie between the Alpha
Sig-Theta Chi and Chi Psi that
twice had to be called. Their first
tie ended at 10-10, the second at 3-3.
After that both teams agreed to can
cel the game unless it was vital to
the outcome of the league.
In the early innings the Fijis had
little trouble taking a four-run lead
over the frosh, but couldn't hold it
as the heavy-hitting of John Paulis,
Herb Eggleston, A. B. Dunn, Boh
Keenan, and Hank Leckman took its
toll.
BOOTH HURLS 2-HITTER
Harry Booth turned in another !
dazzling pitching performance, al- |
.lowing but two hits. He is the only
hurler in either league to have an
no-hitter to his credit. Gene Foster

Alpha Delts, 8-3. Chuck Read hit a ;
home run in the fifth with none
aboard.
Erwin Decker eased to a 16-5 win ;
over the O'Reilly's. His mates club- !

Harry Wizer played outstanding ball I
on first base, as did Nagle behind the ;
plate.
The Pied Typers proved to be a |
hot and cold outfit as they meekly j
! dropped a 2-0 decision to the Menlo
Oaks.
The long-delayed "crucial" tie !

game between the Med School class
es will be played off today.
