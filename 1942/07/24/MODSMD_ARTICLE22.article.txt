# Hee Haw! Mules, Not Nags, Race in South
## 
### 
GREENWOOD. Miss.. July 2:5.â€”
The familial* cry of "there they go"
will resound here today. But not
for the horses. Mules, 100 of them,
fresh from the cotton rows, race
today for charity. Owners, whether
sharecroppers or plantation pro
prietors, compete on equal terms.
Sonic owners, including negroes
from the city's Catfish Alley and
planters from mansions built by
cotton fortunes, will ride their
steeds to the races because of tire
rationing.

It has been estimated that babies
now eat about four times as much
as their parents did when infants.
