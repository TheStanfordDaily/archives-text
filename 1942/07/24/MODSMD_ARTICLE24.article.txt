# The 						Victory Day
## 
### 
T A 7"E HAVE here on the Farm
V Y a very active war board
which strikes practically every
part of the campus. This board
is composed exclusively of
volunteer student workers who
ire interested in what they are
doing. Although it is hard to
believe, most of these persons
have given up much of their
extra time which had previously
been devoted to movies and the
tike to participate in one of the
most valuable parts of the pres
ent war—the civilian aspect.
Next Wednesday this work
vill not be such a mystery to
hose who have not bothered to
nvestigate what is being done
it Stanford to aid the United
Nations' cause, for from 10 to 12
hat day machine guns will fire,
exhibits will be on display, and
acuity and student leaders will
speak to show everyone exactly
/vhat can be done and what is
being done.
Ten o'clock is a good hour
because the sun will be high
enough to discourage most late
sleepers. Another victory was
accomplished when classes
-vere allowed to be dismissed
or two hours. Of course, even
vith all of this, there will be
nany who will choose to drink
■:okes and play bridge."
The main trouble with pro
grams of this sort is that they
reach only those who already
lave an interest. Those who
don't particularly care what
happens will stay away and
sneer. At least that has been
>he case in the past; let's hope it
will not be the case on Wed
nesday.
