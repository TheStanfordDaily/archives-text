### BILL STEIF 
r pHE Battle of the Caucasus has
now reached its most critical
phase. Despite Russian claims of
success in holding the Nazis in the
north at Voronezh, the fact is that
Marshal Semeon Timoshenko's troops
are taking a mighty walloping in the
triangular area between Voronezh,
Rostov, and Stalingrad.
Even if the Reds have managed
to hold at Voronezh, what good has
it done them? The Nazis have
more than accomplished their ob
jective in attacking that city. They
now possess most of the Don River
between Rostov and Voronezh, and
that waterway, together with the
railroad that parallels it, are the
two things that make Voronezh an
important town. The possessor of
the railroad and the river, for all
practical purposes, is the possessor
of Voronezh. Rostov, however, is a
horse of a different color.
As one of the last Black Sea ports
belonging to Russia, Rostov has tre
mendous value in that it can be used
as an effective base for harrassing
German ship movements in the
Black Sea. Also, it is just possible
that it can still be of some use for
the reception of supplies from Tur
key to be shipped to Russian forces
further east. Furthermore, Rostov
is a much larger city than Voro
nezh, possesses some industries, and
is an important junction for Soviet
oil pipe lines.
of course, is even
more important than Rostov. It
is the seat of much of Russia's heavy
industry, is, in fact, the place where
a large part of Russia's war supplies
have been coming from. In addition,
the vital oil pipe lines connecting
Moscow and Astrakhan run through
Stalingrad as do two of the Soviet's
most important links between
northern and southern Russia — the
Volga River and the Astrakhan-
Stalingrad-Moscow railroad.
Obviously, the losses of Rostov
and Stalingrad would be the most
damaging blows the Russians have
suffered this year, not only be
cause the Soviet would be so
grievously injured by the loss of
the two cities, but also because the
Nazis would gain the oil of the
Caucasus and what might even
tually be a position for a heavy
shot at India.
Reports of last night have the
Nazis penetrating to the outskirts of
Rostov, while Hitler's legions seem
to be making mush of the resistance
which they are meeting on their way
to Stalingrad. It would seem that
the eastern segment of Marshal Fedor
von Bock's two-pronged drive is un
doubtedly within a hundred miles of
Stalingrad, and one Paris report
says that a German spearhead had
struck to a point within 28 miles of
that city, although the French seem
to have an unfortunate tendency to
exaggerate Nazi successes.
of this does not mean that the
Russians have not been putting
up a good battle. They have. They
have, in fact, thus far done better
against the Nazis than any other of
the United Nations. But the terrific
German superiority in guns, tanks,
planes perhaps, and mobile equip
ment has literally overwhelmed
Stalin's men. Man for man I would
not hesitate placing my money on
the Reds over the "Nordics." but this
war is not being won by manpower.
It is firepower—superior firepower—
which must win this war.
The United Nations have today
in England and Ireland, I am con
vinced. suflicient superiority in
firepower to invade either France
or Norway now. The main body of
German troops is in Russia and the
Allies could very conceivably es
tablish a continental foothold
which the Germans, occupied on
two fronts, could never break.
The only thing is that this second
front must be established now. Time
is working against us. If the Allies
do not take the offensive now, there
muy be no eastern front left.
