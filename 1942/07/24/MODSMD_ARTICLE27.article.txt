### JOSEPH M. RUNNING 
"THE LOGIC OF BELIEF," by D.
Elton Truehlood, Harper and Broth
ers, $2.75 (courtesy Stanford Book
store).
It is significant that D. Elton
Trueblood's monumental philosophy
of religion, "The Logic of Belief,"
should come off the press when so
many people are re-examining and
re-affirming their personal faith.
And it is significant that Dr. True
blood examines the nature of belief
in such a way that should most ap
peal to the university circles with
which he is associated.
He has sought, he says, "to pre
sent an . introduction to belief in
general, and religious belief in par
ticular, always from the point of
view of the logician." And he has
achieved that goal; he is an ardent
believer, but his analysis of the
structure of belief, his evaluation of
the personal creed of the average
man, his plea for a widening and
deepening of faith is presented in a
manner that must honestly be
called coolly scientific.
Dr. Trueblood believes in a log
ical and open-minded following of
truth, even though it leaves him
faced with some very real difficul
ties, such as the problem of evolu
tion and the problem of evil. Two of
his best chapters are on those sub
jects. Another outstanding chapter
is the section on aesthetics.
The book is a stimulating volume
for those who wish to watch on
paper the logical reasoning of a keen
mind, and for those who may be in
terested in examining their own
belief.
