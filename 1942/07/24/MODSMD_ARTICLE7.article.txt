# 'Win Peace with World League,' Says Lindeman
## Philosopher Bases Success of Plan On Use of Mobile Police Force 
### 
World federation is the only answer to world peace following the pres
ent conflict, according to Dr. Edward Christian Lindeman, nationally
known philosopher and educator from the New York School of Social
Work, who has been the principal lecturer at the annual Stanford School

of Education summer conference.
"The Allied nations are going to
win this war in the military sense in
about three years. In order to win
the peace, however, a world federa
tion must be formed before the enc!
of hostilities," according to Dr.
Lindeman. "This federation must be
based on force, if we are to escape
the failure of the League of Na
tions."
STUDENT OPINION
College student opinion, such as
expressed by the Daily War Poll,
showing 82 per cent of Stanford stu
dents in favor of such a world fed
eration, should be fostered by the
faculty, said Dr. Lindeman.
Dr. Lindeman's plan for the fed
eration would divide the world up
into eleven regions, based on geo
graphical location, culture and eco
nomic status. The federation should
be formed as soon as any two of
these regions are ready, not wait
until the armistice period, he said.
"Greatest policing force would bÂ«i
a highly mobile, heavily armed!
striking force, controlled by tha
central world government to wipe
out aggressors before they have had
a chance to do any damage.
This world army would have con
trol of all centers of production
manufacturing armaments, and hence
could throttle any uprising," he said
FRAMEWORK
Such a federation would have a
similar framework to that of the
United States, with a president, su
preme court, and legislative body.
The supreme court would be com
posed of II men, one from each of
the regions. Five representatives
from each region, representing in
dustry, labor, agriculture, science,
and education, would form the legis
lative body, according to Dr. Linde
man's plan.
At the present time Dr. Lindeman
is working in a special institute
workshop on Education in Peace an!
War in New York. He is also
work in the Red Cross training pro
gram and with the USO. He will re
turn to New York tomorrow.
