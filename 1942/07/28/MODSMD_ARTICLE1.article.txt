### KEITH BENNETT 
The Army Enlisted Reserve pro
gram has been temporarily sus
pended, pending completion of fur
ther plans and reports, it was an
nounced last night by Colonel Harry
B. Allen. No enlistments will be ac
cepted except for advanced R.O.T.C.
students who are required to join the
Enlisted Reserve before signing ad
vanced contracts. When plans have
been completed, the general enlist
ment will be reopened.
The requirements for the Reserve
and the Navy V-l program were
announced by Dean John Bunn and
Colonel Allen at an assembly last
Thursday evening. They are as fol
lows:
Army Enlisted Reserve: Any per
son now in college in good health
and good standing is eligible to join.
After passing a physical exam, the
applicant will be sworn in, and will
be allowed to complete college if he
maintains good standing. Upon
graduation he will enter the Army,
and will then be sent to officers'
school. When the course in the offi
cers' school is completed, he will be
commissioned in the branch of the
service for which he was trained.
Navy V-l program: Any freshman
or sophomore, or person who was a
sophomore during Spring Quarter of
this year is eligible. After passing
physical exams, he is enlisted in the
V-l program. However, in order to
be allowed to complete his college
education, he must have taken a year
of college mathematics, and must
have had geometry. He must also
pass the mental examination that
will be given near the end of his
sophomore year, and which will in
clude mathematics and physics. If
he fails to qualify in this exam, he
will be called into immediate service
as an enlisted man in the Navy. If
he does meet all qualifications, the
candidate is allowed to finish col
lege, and will be commissioned as an
ensign after graduation.
The importance of these programs
to college students was heightened
at the meeting by Dean Bunn's
statement that there is a prevailing
opinion in official circles that the
draft age will be lowered to 18 fol
lowing the November elections.
He emphasized, however, that
there was no need for hasty action,
and that careful considerations
should be made.
Each school will also appoint one
faculty member to act as an armed
service representative, and to pro
vide information to students.
