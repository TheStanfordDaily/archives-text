# Beery Mugs Way Through New Western
## 
### 
"JACKASS MAIL," now playing
at the Stanford.
Wallace Beery is the jackass in
'Jackass Mail," though Marjorie
Main brays out a close second. For
one who is not fed up with westerns
and can stand unlimited doses of
Beery's mugging and Main's hillbilly
fits, the "Jackass" theme of lawless
ventures unintentionally turned
leeds of valor will hold a teacup of
rowdy humor, strained.
"Fingers at the Window," based on
the implausible idea of hypnotizing
schizophrenics into ax murdering, is
the best Dr. Kildare picture of the
year. With Rathbone as the villain,
Laraine Day as the brainless victim
Kildare's best line: "She hasn't got
the braiiis of a pancake"), and Kil
dare under another name to sleuth
to boot, the picture is definitely num
ber one of the first-ten second-fea
ture mysteries of the year. I don't
recall any fingers at the window,
though.â€”Covey

'Farm" of eight thousand six hun
