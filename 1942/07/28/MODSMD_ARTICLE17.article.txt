## 
### 
"Is this the Daily? Well, say.
we've captured a live falcon over
here at the theater. Falcon? Yes,
one of those hooked beaked birds
with a leal her strap dangling
from its leg. Unh huh, and it tried
to bite a couple of people, too, in
cluding me. Wherc'd we get it?
Well, we found it sitting on the
ledge out on the porch, so Jimmy
grabbed it. Where can the owner
get it? We're keeping it here, but
Jimmy called the police so maybe
they'll take it. lis sure funny, be
cause it (its in with our new play,
"Tartuffe."
The speaker was Charley Vance,
the capturer was Jimmy Walker,
the falcon is the falcon and the
owner can get the bird from the
drama department or the Paly
police.
