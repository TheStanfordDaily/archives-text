STANFORD CREW SAVES RUBBER, TOO:
k In an attempt to bring the sport home to Stanford fans ami at the
same time solve (he transportation problem, Carl Pedersen, crew coach,
is contemplating a move from the Redwood City Harbor to Palo Alto.
The Redskins now have three shells, one brand new, a gift from Uni
versity of Washington. And literally there's 110 place to put 'em,
The ramshackle boathouse at Redwood isn't too good. And it's too far
to ask the crewmen to make a daily trip during the training season.
Therefore, the Stanford crew has asked from the city a lease permit at !
the Palo Alto harbor just across the Bayshore highway, easily accessible
to crew members and fans alike.
The likeable Indian coach hopes to get the green light signal from
Palo Alto's Board of Public Works and City Council very soon, so thai
facilities will be ready by next quarter.

{ M)OD LUCK TO HAMMETT:
Ray Haminett, third lo las! of a long line of quarterbacks, tossad
liis application into the Army Enlisted Reserve maw yesterday, and with
it goes many a fond hope from us and football fans alike.
Kay expects to be drafted some time this summer, and appointment to
the reserve would keep him in school until graduation.
He is visiting the campus for a week and expects to get in a little
golf, tennis, swimming, et cetera after, quitting his summer job. He should
'""ceive word of action on his request for enlistment in about two weeks.
Good luck from all, Ray.

IyiAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW:
That Frankie Albert, also visiting campus now before going to the
Naval Aviation Pre-Flight School at St. Mary's, received in the neighbor
hood of G G's for his part in the "Spirit of Stanford."
That Jimmy Pollard, basketballer and all-around athlete, once turned
down an offer from the New York Yankees to attend Oregon, then be
farmed out to a Yankee club.
That Warren Wright, owner of Whirlaway, the all-time money winner
in horse racing, turns 10 per cent of long-tailed Whirly's earnings into
defense bonds.
That Stanford's balloting for the all-star game at Chicago August 28
swung the coast voting in favor of three Stanford players. Vic Lindskog
and Frankie Albert were already tops on the coast, but the Farm's 605
ballots pushed Fred Meyer, Ken Robesky, and Pete Kmetovic into the
top spots in the home picking. Thanx again to those that voted here.
