# Harry Booth Attempts to Halt Encina Streak at Five Straight
## 
### 
Harry Booth, outstanding Hurler in League A, will be out on the mound
today for the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi combination to stop the currently high
riding Enema 11-111 team in its bid for the Summer Softball crown.
Today's games mark the final week of play, after which comes the play
off series for the league title and consolation prize. The winner of each

league will meet. ♦
After dropping their first game by
a one-run margin to the Zetes, the
freshmen have taken five straight
i games in impressive style. The hit -
| ting authority is handled by John
Paulis, Herb Eggleston. Bob Keenan,
and Hank Leckman.
Booth has the only no-hit per
formance in either league, but lack
of fielding ability on the part of his
j teammates has usually kept him in a
hole. The Alpha Sigs-Theta Chis
have at times shown surges of hit
ting power, mainly on the part of
Phil Rice, Chuck Read. Gene Fos
ter, and John Moeur.
Ellis Mahan's U.S. Army team, the I
i only undefeated club in either
league, take on the thrice-beaten [
| 2nd-year Med School. Pitching for I
medics is tall, fastball pitcher Frank
Rogers. Cap Pitch ford is his battery j
mate, with Nick Bills the mainstay j
| of the infield.
DRIVERS IN SECOND

Drivers, resting in second place, meet

The Alpha Delts. one of the hard- I

though losing two games, should have
| little trouble handing pitcher Bud
j Woodward a victory. He gets con
; sistently good support in the infield
i from Bob McLean, Bud Crary, and

Harry Booth, outstanding Hurler in League A, will be out on the mound
today for the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi combination to stop the currently high
riding Enema 11-111 team in its bid for the Summer Softball crown.
Today's games mark the final week of play, after which comes the play
off series for the league title and consolation prize. The winner of each

league will meet. ♦
After dropping their first game by
a one-run margin to the Zetes, the
freshmen have taken five straight
i games in impressive style. The hit -
| ting authority is handled by John
Paulis, Herb Eggleston. Bob Keenan,
and Hank Leckman.
Booth has the only no-hit per
formance in either league, but lack
of fielding ability on the part of his
j teammates has usually kept him in a
hole. The Alpha Sigs-Theta Chis
have at times shown surges of hit
ting power, mainly on the part of
Phil Rice, Chuck Read. Gene Fos
ter, and John Moeur.
Ellis Mahan's U.S. Army team, the I
i only undefeated club in either
league, take on the thrice-beaten [
| 2nd-year Med School. Pitching for I
medics is tall, fastball pitcher Frank
Rogers. Cap Pitch ford is his battery j
mate, with Nick Bills the mainstay j
| of the infield.
