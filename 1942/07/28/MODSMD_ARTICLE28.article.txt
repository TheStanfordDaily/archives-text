actually are
V-/ using their cars less now,
according to the State Board of
Equalization, for there has been
a drop of 7.66 per cent in rev
enue from taxable gasoline
sales in June as compared with
the same month of last year.
The total gallonage for the
first six months of 1941 was
1,007,531,896 and 956,897,334
or the same period this year.
Of course this isn't a very large
drop—not close to the amount
the drop should be—but it does
show a certain sign of aware
ness, which is a move in the
nght direction.
To bring the matter close to
nome, how much of this drop is
due to a decreased use of cars
it Stanford? Naturally, we are
Dnly a small part of the state,
md any drop recorded here
A/ould make little difference in
he total figure, but it would be
nteresting to count the number
of students who can say they
ictually bought less gasoline
his year than they did last
night.
Possibly it is being a bit too
oessimistic to say that Stanford
nen and women are going to
drive their cars until they liter
ally fall apart. No one is exempt
—this is not a sermon from high
—actually every student in
school who owns or drives a
-ar has been using it with the
idea that maybe next week or
lext month he will cut down.

Much has been said Irom day
;o day about car owners putting
their limousines on blocks and
jsing them only when neces
sary. It doesn't take much ex
plaining to show a person that
the less he uses his car the
longer his tires will last; but the
big problem is to convince each
individual that his co-operation
as as essential as that of "those
Dther guys who drive around
all of the time."
Maybe we should set aside a
(arm for discarded plow horses;
we'll be needing them for trans
portation before long.

Are Stanford's roughs going
smooth? According to reports,
there were many corsages at
last Saturday night's Lagunita
formal. Corsages are fine, but
now, more than ever, the tradi
tion of no flowers for campus
dances should hold true. Be
sides, the geraniums in front of
Lagunita could have been cut
and used for flowers. Well, it
would have been a gesture.

Much has been said Irom day
;o day about car owners putting
their limousines on blocks and
jsing them only when neces

plaining to show a person that
the less he uses his car the
longer his tires will last; but the
big problem is to convince each
individual that his co-operation

Maybe we should set aside a
(arm for discarded plow horses;
we'll be needing them for trans

Are Stanford's roughs going
smooth? According to reports,
there were many corsages at
last Saturday night's Lagunita
formal. Corsages are fine, but
now, more than ever, the tradi
tion of no flowers for campus
dances should hold true. Be
sides, the geraniums in front of
Lagunita could have been cut
and used for flowers. Well, it
would have been a gesture.
actually are
V-/ using their cars less now,
according to the State Board of
Equalization, for there has been
a drop of 7.66 per cent in rev
enue from taxable gasoline
sales in June as compared with
the same month of last year.
The total gallonage for the
first six months of 1941 was
1,007,531,896 and 956,897,334
or the same period this year.
Of course this isn't a very large
drop—not close to the amount
the drop should be—but it does
show a certain sign of aware
ness, which is a move in the
nght direction.
To bring the matter close to
nome, how much of this drop is
due to a decreased use of cars
it Stanford? Naturally, we are
Dnly a small part of the state,
md any drop recorded here
A/ould make little difference in
he total figure, but it would be
nteresting to count the number
of students who can say they
ictually bought less gasoline
his year than they did last
night.
Possibly it is being a bit too
oessimistic to say that Stanford
nen and women are going to
drive their cars until they liter
ally fall apart. No one is exempt
—this is not a sermon from high
—actually every student in
school who owns or drives a
-ar has been using it with the
idea that maybe next week or
lext month he will cut down.
