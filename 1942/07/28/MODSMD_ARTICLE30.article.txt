# IN THE WAY OF APOLOGY

OEGLER has his "Fair Enough,"
Mrs. R. "Her Day," Walter Win
chell his "Gent's Room Journalism,"
my roommate Steif has "History 1942
(courtesy of Time, Life and Royce
Brier), Sontag, "Salty Sez" (cour
tesy of the Sporting Green), but
Churchill has to get sick and leave
me with Bull Session.
I could write about the hospital so
that Mike would be assured good
treatment and extra special back
rubs, but then maybe the result
wouldn't be laudatory and Mike
would be ignored by the nurses. He
couldn't stand that. Besides, my last
hospital bill, thanks to the Student
Health Fund, was pretty reasonable.
Curiosity finally got the best of me.
Churchill is a Zete and I wondered
just what kind of diseases Zetes get.
So, I called the Paly Hospital and
finally a militant voiced nurse in
formed me that "Mr. Churchill is in
isolation and cannot have visitors."
"Well, what's he got?" I asked eag
erly, now being hot on the trail of
what Zetes get. Came the pursed lips,
pruins and prisms reply, "Measles."
I laughed and hung up.
