## 
### 
Lagunita Hall will entertain par
ents, off-campus students, and
friends at an open house on Sunday,
August 9. The guests will be met
in the main lobby and taken from
there to the various casas. Each casa
will serve refreshments between
3:30 and 5 o'clock. During the open
house the girls will be allowed to
take their guests through the hall.
Last night at the casa meetings
the girls signed up for one of the
four following committees: hostess,
serving, checking, and clean-up.

Eighty per cent of the slate quar
