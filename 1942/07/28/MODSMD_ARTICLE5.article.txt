CONSTRUCTION MAGNATE Henry J. Kaiser is turning his interest
from ships to flying boats, as evidenced by the Kaiser-designed model
of a 200-ton 12-motored seaplane shown here in front of him. And he
is thinking of larger ships, with as many as 20 motors, and huge
decks inside their wings. Kaiser says his present shipbuilding facili
ties could be switched to handle flying boats and have the 70-tonners
coining off the assembly line within 10 months.
