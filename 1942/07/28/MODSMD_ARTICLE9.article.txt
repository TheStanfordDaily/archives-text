# Stanford: The City in Itself, As Viewed Behind the Scenes

### BY NOEL YOUNG 
(Editor's Note: This is the first in a series of articles based on the
behind-the-scene aspects of Stanford University, practically a city in
itself.)

When you're through chatting with Frank Fish Walker, it's hard to
believe that Stanford isn't a city.
As the situation stands, Walker has the title of Financial Vice-Presi
dent. supervising professors' payrolls, keeping an eye on Stanford securi-

►ties in the Pennsylvania Railroad,
and directing 1200 non-academic
employees and 9.000 acres of black
soil.
WALKER CO ORDINATOR
He is the co-ordinator of a policy
forming committee composed of
J. W. McDonnell, Corp Yard super
intendent, Miss Christine Ricker,
director of dining halls, Fire Chief
Arden Hatley, Police Chief Gordon
Davis, Men's Residence Director
Stanley Sharp, and Miss Anastasia
Doyle, director of women's resi
dences.
Two years ago Mr. Walker left the
realm of New York high finance to
return to Stanford for the first time
since 1917 when he left as an under
graduate to go gunning for subma
rines on a destroyer. He was not
only A.S.S.U. president and Daily
business manager but also the only
president in Farm history to be
elected unanimously.
CARS WERE SCARCE
"In those days Henry Ford was just
getting the hang of mass production
and cars were as scarce as hen's
teeth," observed Mr. Walker. "And
today when I come back, I find the
pendulum is swinging back again."
As Mr. Walker finished the chat,
he presented The Daily with a copy
of the annual financial report. Fig
ures inside revealed that the vice
president handles a $5,000,000 budget,
supplemented by $30,000,000 worth of
income-producing assets.

behind-the-scene aspects of Stanford University, practically a city in
itself.)

When you're through chatting with Frank Fish Walker, it's hard to
believe that Stanford isn't a city.
As the situation stands, Walker has the title of Financial Vice-Presi
dent. supervising professors' payrolls, keeping an eye on Stanford securi-

►ties in the Pennsylvania Railroad,
and directing 1200 non-academic
employees and 9.000 acres of black
soil.
WALKER CO ORDINATOR
He is the co-ordinator of a policy
forming committee composed of
J. W. McDonnell, Corp Yard super
intendent, Miss Christine Ricker,
director of dining halls, Fire Chief
Arden Hatley, Police Chief Gordon
Davis, Men's Residence Director
Stanley Sharp, and Miss Anastasia
Doyle, director of women's resi
dences.
Two years ago Mr. Walker left the
realm of New York high finance to
return to Stanford for the first time
since 1917 when he left as an under
graduate to go gunning for subma
rines on a destroyer. He was not
only A.S.S.U. president and Daily
business manager but also the only
president in Farm history to be
elected unanimously.
CARS WERE SCARCE
"In those days Henry Ford was just
getting the hang of mass production
and cars were as scarce as hen's
teeth," observed Mr. Walker. "And
today when I come back, I find the
pendulum is swinging back again."
As Mr. Walker finished the chat,
he presented The Daily with a copy
of the annual financial report. Fig
ures inside revealed that the vice
president handles a $5,000,000 budget,
supplemented by $30,000,000 worth of
income-producing assets.
