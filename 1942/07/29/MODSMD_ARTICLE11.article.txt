J. W. McDonnell is the boss of 112 |
nen, the kind of boss (he men call ;
' Mac" to his face.
His office is at the head of a nar- i
:ow flight of wooden stairs in the 1
main Corp Yard building. There he
is superintendent of 112 of Vice- j
President Walker's 2000 employees—
carpenters, painters, plumbers, me- ]
•hanics, brick-layers. They're all I
ough men with tough jobs.
''We do all the physical work on ■
.he campus, from stem to stern," said |
Mac. Yesterday, they were finish- i
mg up a resurfacing job on San Juan j
Hill roads. Tomorrow, they tackle a j
road on the "Y." Three wells and a
pipeline from Searsville, comprising
in independent campus water sys
tem of 350.000,000 gallons, come un- 1
der Mac's supervision.
The war has measurably slowed j
;he Corp Yard down, and has scaled j
its work to a minimum. The labor
situation, priorities on lumber and i
frozen lighting fixtures have forced j
McDonnell to restrict his work on j
the Row to emergency jobs only.
With a skeleton staff, the big job to- j
day is bare maintenance of the
campus physical plant.
"Our buildings aren't like pyra
mids and for the duration it's all we
can do to combat the annual dete
rioration," remarked Mac. "Plans
for construction of a chemistry an
nex were killed by the war."
McDonnell has worked for Stan
fold since the days of the earth
quake when the chapel was prac
tically devastated and Agassiz, the
marble statue, dove headlong through
a cement sidewalk, In those days,
the maintenance crew was decen
tralized. Mac was then in charge of
the independent electrical depart
ment. In 1917, there was a general
reshuffle and the Corp Yard was i
organized to co-ordinate all phases
of campus repairs.
McDonnell compensates for his
tough job by raising orchids. On
off-hours, he puts his calloused mitts
to painstaking cultivation of 300
orchids. A glass vase on his desk
held a white-lipped specimen, which
he personally collected in Mexico
last year.

J. W. McDonnell is the boss of 112 |
nen, the kind of boss (he men call ;
' Mac" to his face.
His office is at the head of a nar- i
:ow flight of wooden stairs in the 1
main Corp Yard building. There he
is superintendent of 112 of Vice- j
President Walker's 2000 employees—
carpenters, painters, plumbers, me- ]
•hanics, brick-layers. They're all I
ough men with tough jobs.
''We do all the physical work on ■
.he campus, from stem to stern," said |
Mac. Yesterday, they were finish- i
mg up a resurfacing job on San Juan j
Hill roads. Tomorrow, they tackle a j
road on the "Y." Three wells and a
pipeline from Searsville, comprising
in independent campus water sys
tem of 350.000,000 gallons, come un- 1
der Mac's supervision.
The war has measurably slowed j
;he Corp Yard down, and has scaled j
its work to a minimum. The labor
situation, priorities on lumber and i
frozen lighting fixtures have forced j
McDonnell to restrict his work on j
the Row to emergency jobs only.
With a skeleton staff, the big job to- j
day is bare maintenance of the
campus physical plant.
"Our buildings aren't like pyra
mids and for the duration it's all we
can do to combat the annual dete
rioration," remarked Mac. "Plans
for construction of a chemistry an
nex were killed by the war."
McDonnell has worked for Stan
fold since the days of the earth
quake when the chapel was prac
tically devastated and Agassiz, the
marble statue, dove headlong through
a cement sidewalk, In those days,
the maintenance crew was decen
tralized. Mac was then in charge of
the independent electrical depart
ment. In 1917, there was a general
reshuffle and the Corp Yard was i
organized to co-ordinate all phases
of campus repairs.
McDonnell compensates for his
tough job by raising orchids. On
off-hours, he puts his calloused mitts
to painstaking cultivation of 300
orchids. A glass vase on his desk
held a white-lipped specimen, which
he personally collected in Mexico
last year.
