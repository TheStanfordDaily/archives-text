# Five Ex-Stanford Gridders Named All-Stars
## Grid Stars Will Journey East To Meet Pros 
### 
Stanford's football picture focused
eastward yesterday when five mem
bers of last year's Redskin eleven
were invited to participate in the
annual Chicago Bear-Collegiate All-
Star grid contest August 28 at Sol
diers Field in Chicago.
The five are: Frankie Albert, All -
American quarterback for the Inst
two years; Vic Lindskog, center and
now an assistant coach to 'Marchie
Schwartz; Freddy Meyer, voted All-
Coast right end for two years by
Associated Press poll; Pete Kmeto
vic, halfback, one year All-Coast
A.P.: and Ken Robesky, outstanding
guard on the last three Stanford
teams.
Seventy-five collegiate stars have
been asked to appear, and those who
accept will report at Northwestern
University at Evanston, 111., August
8 to begin training. The Bears begin
training the same day at Delafield,
Wis.
MIDWEST PLAYERS LEAD
Ohio State, Minnesota, and Notre
Dame led the field with two bids
each for the starting team as in
vites were mailed out to players
from 34 universities and colleges
who were selected in a nationwide
poll. More than four million ballots
were cast, including those of 397 sol
diers in Ireland and 430 in Hono
lulu.
Ljndskog expects to leave today, if
possible, but may delay going until
Saturday. Albert is visiting the cam
pus now and will leave some time
next week. Kmetovic and Robesky
are at Great Lakes Naval Training
Base, and Meyer is working in Los
Angeles.
Other coast stars invited are Bob
Reinhard, California's tackle, and
Bob Robertson, Southern California
halfback. None of the coasters in
vited made the starting team but all
will probably see action during the
game.
SCHWARTZ TO TAKE TRIP
Elsewhere on the football front
Coach Schwartz said yesterday he
would leave for Omaha with his wife
xand family next week to visit rela
tives.
He hopes to be able to see Clark
Shaughnessy, former Stanford foot
ball mentor, now head athletic di
rector at the University of Mary
land.
Schwartz may be in the east long
enough to see the Bear-All-Star
game and gather some potent point
ers from the play-for-pav Bears,
who use exclusively the T system
Schwartz expects to employ here
next fall.
