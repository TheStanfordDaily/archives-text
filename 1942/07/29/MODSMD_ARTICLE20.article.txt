# Frosh Lead Softball League A After Tieing Row Team, 2-2
## 
### 
Yesterday s game between the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi coalition and the
Encina 11-111 team, to decide the supremacy of League A, ended in a 2-2
deadlock, thus leaving the frosh in possession of first place.
The Alpha Sig-Theta Chis had little trouble puslung over two runs in
the first inning, and appeared to have little trouble holding down the frosh.

due to the superb pitching of Ilarry-
Booth. Phil Rice turned in some
spectacular fielding at second base to
hack up Booth.
Phil Rice took the hitting honors
for the winners, batting a thousand
for the day.
Due to important work at its post,
the U.S. Army had to postpone its
game with the 2nd-year Medics, with
the game to be played soon.
Alpha Delts, holding second spot,
put Pete Gadd on the mound instead
of Bud Woodward, and handed him
an easy 14-3 win over Encina IB and
the pitching of Art Shafer. The
frosh found themselves in the hole at
the outset as their opponents scored
five runs in the first inning and
three in the second. Gadd hit a
homer for the Alpha Delts.
An upset was scored in League B
as the Cullers tripped up last year's
champions, the Spar Ducks, 7-i. De
spite the heroic work of Duck catcher
Art Miller, the neophyte medics
supported Pete Jones' three-hit
pitching with timely hits by Bill
Roth and Tex Paskowitz.
Roth got a triple and a single to
lead the attack, followed by Pas
kowitz' home run.
League B's second-placers, the
Slave Drivers, had little trouble in

knocking over O'Reilly's, 16-0. Ev
eryone on the team collected hits,
and things got so soft that Dean John
Bunn pitched a few innings for the
faculty men.
Marsh Wcigle's loss to the Biz
Wig Club apparently didn't affect
the team too much as Bill Materse,
aided by timely hitting, beat the im
proving Menlo Oaks. Weigle, one of
the league's best hurlers, has left
school to report for active duty in
the Navy.
Going into the last inning the Oaks
had built up a comfortable four
run lead, but successive home runs
by Tom Krueger. Bill Davis, and
pitcher Materse scored four runs to
put the Biz Wigs in front. 8-6.
Jeff Bromfield, despite the many
errors of his Zete teammates, won
his own ball game in the last inning
with a three-run homer to win over
the Chi Psi. 6-5.
Chuck Taylor led an undermanned

Upper Row team both at bat and
afield to beat the Encina IV-V squad, j
7-4. Ed Gibbs also starred for the I
winners with some spectacular field- '
ing work.
The Lower Row trampled the |
Fijis, 18-7, despite the latter's last- j
inning five-run rally. George Henzie i
pitched good ball for the winners :
until the last inning. Frank Tibbetts I
hurled for the losers.

Yesterday s game between the Alpha Sig-Theta Chi coalition and the
Encina 11-111 team, to decide the supremacy of League A, ended in a 2-2
deadlock, thus leaving the frosh in possession of first place.
The Alpha Sig-Theta Chis had little trouble puslung over two runs in
the first inning, and appeared to have little trouble holding down the frosh.

due to the superb pitching of Ilarry-
Booth. Phil Rice turned in some
spectacular fielding at second base to
hack up Booth.
Phil Rice took the hitting honors
for the winners, batting a thousand
for the day.
Due to important work at its post,
the U.S. Army had to postpone its
game with the 2nd-year Medics, with
the game to be played soon.
Alpha Delts, holding second spot,
put Pete Gadd on the mound instead
of Bud Woodward, and handed him
an easy 14-3 win over Encina IB and
the pitching of Art Shafer. The
frosh found themselves in the hole at
the outset as their opponents scored
five runs in the first inning and
three in the second. Gadd hit a
homer for the Alpha Delts.
An upset was scored in League B
as the Cullers tripped up last year's
champions, the Spar Ducks, 7-i. De
spite the heroic work of Duck catcher
Art Miller, the neophyte medics
supported Pete Jones' three-hit
pitching with timely hits by Bill
Roth and Tex Paskowitz.
Roth got a triple and a single to
lead the attack, followed by Pas
kowitz' home run.
League B's second-placers, the
Slave Drivers, had little trouble in

knocking over O'Reilly's, 16-0. Ev
eryone on the team collected hits,
and things got so soft that Dean John
Bunn pitched a few innings for the
faculty men.
Marsh Wcigle's loss to the Biz
Wig Club apparently didn't affect
the team too much as Bill Materse,
aided by timely hitting, beat the im
proving Menlo Oaks. Weigle, one of
the league's best hurlers, has left
school to report for active duty in
the Navy.
Going into the last inning the Oaks
had built up a comfortable four
run lead, but successive home runs
by Tom Krueger. Bill Davis, and
pitcher Materse scored four runs to
put the Biz Wigs in front. 8-6.
Jeff Bromfield, despite the many
errors of his Zete teammates, won
his own ball game in the last inning
with a three-run homer to win over
the Chi Psi. 6-5.
Chuck Taylor led an undermanned

Upper Row team both at bat and
afield to beat the Encina IV-V squad, j
7-4. Ed Gibbs also starred for the I
winners with some spectacular field- '
ing work.
The Lower Row trampled the |
Fijis, 18-7, despite the latter's last- j
inning five-run rally. George Henzie i
pitched good ball for the winners :
until the last inning. Frank Tibbetts I
hurled for the losers.
