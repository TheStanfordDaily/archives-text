# Victory Day
## 
### 
TWO days after Pearl Harbor,
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
our told an all-University assem
bly that "this is reality—we are
right up against the guns."
We were all pretty serious
about the war then. American
pride had just been attacked at
°earl Harbor and we all wanted
o go right out and clean up the
dirty Japs. But this gradually
vore off, and students began to
view the war with complacency.
Most of us haven't been
ouched by the war. We've set
up a war activities organiation
'o take care of student contribu
ions toward the war effort. This
var activities organization has
done a good job, but the student
"rontributions have been poor.
Today Stanford is holding its
irst Victory Day. For the first
ime since Pearl Harbor there
exists a planned effort to reach
ill the students with the whole
picture of Stanford at war.
By exhibitions, demonstrations,
speeches, and pictures the Stu
dent War Board is trying to
drive home the seriousness of
otal war to every student.
At an all-University assembly
today, Chancellor Wilbur will
lead a discussion of how the
Stanford student can help win
the war while still in college.
Six student speakers, in a panel
discussion, will survey the op
portunities for each student to
do his part in the war effort.
Today every student has a
rhance to get the right answer
to this question — "What can I
do to help win the war while
Cm still in college?" Failure of
any student to attend the Vic
tory Day assembly and look
Dver the exhibits means that
student is not interested in do
ing his part.
Today's Victory Day program
should make every student
think seriously about his part in
the war. Bob Collins and his
War Board staff have done an
excellent job in planning Vic
tory Day, but every student
must participate in order for the
program to be a success. —

ouched by the war. We've set
up a war activities organiation
'o take care of student contribu
ions toward the war effort. This
var activities organization has
done a good job, but the student
"rontributions have been poor.
Today Stanford is holding its
irst Victory Day. For the first
ime since Pearl Harbor there
exists a planned effort to reach
ill the students with the whole
picture of Stanford at war.
By exhibitions, demonstrations,
speeches, and pictures the Stu
dent War Board is trying to
drive home the seriousness of
otal war to every student.
At an all-University assembly
today, Chancellor Wilbur will
lead a discussion of how the
Stanford student can help win
the war while still in college.
Six student speakers, in a panel
discussion, will survey the op
portunities for each student to
do his part in the war effort.
Today every student has a
rhance to get the right answer
to this question — "What can I
do to help win the war while
Cm still in college?" Failure of
any student to attend the Vic
tory Day assembly and look
Dver the exhibits means that
student is not interested in do
ing his part.
Today's Victory Day program
should make every student
think seriously about his part in
the war. Bob Collins and his
War Board staff have done an
excellent job in planning Vic
tory Day, but every student
must participate in order for the
program to be a success. —
