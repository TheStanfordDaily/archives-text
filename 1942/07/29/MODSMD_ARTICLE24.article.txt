### BILL STEIF 
I wonder who our
enemies really are. Of course, I
know about the Japs and the Nazis
and the Italians outside the country
and I know that the Nazi saboteurs
caught within the United States are
enemies, but I have recently been
reading about another group of men
who to all intents and purposes
seem to be good, solid American
citizens with respectable jobs and
nice wives and children to come
home off the 6:10 to, and who, in all
respects, would seem to be quite ex
cellent models for many Americans.
There is, for example, a man
named Scrimgeour who until the
war was making $5,000, perhaps
$10,000, a year working for the
Navy. He is a roly-poly little man
who probably likes bacon and
eggs and coffee for breakfast. Well,
soon after the war came along he
and several of his friends formed a
little company and began selling
things. I know salesmen have had
pretty tough going since Decem
ber 7, hut these salesmen, for a
reason, didn't have a hard time at
all. In fact, they had soon made
something in the neighborhood of
$250,000.
The reason they did so nicely was
because these men were selling the
services of large industries to the
Navy. The Navy, you see, wanted
and wants to buy a lot of things to
maybe win the war, and a lot of large
manufacturing companies wanted to
sell these things to maybe win the
war for the Navy. The only trouble
was that the companies and the
Navy had a hard time getting to
| gether, and so Mr. Scrimgeour and
I a lot of men like Mr. Scrimgeour
: who had received a few hints from a
few people in the Navy or the Army,
just did their patriotic duty and got
i the companies and the services to
j gether—for a fee.

of course, this may be pa
triotism and all that sort of
thing, and I don't doubt that Mr.
Scrimgeour and all his fellow brok
ers are personable gentlemen—just
like Maurice Arnff, but just the same
it does seem a little bit peculiar that
men are making so much money at
a time when I thought that Mr.
Roosevelt and Mr. Nelson and Mr.
Henderson were trying to stop people
from making a lot of money because
lots of money for some people would
deprive other people of necessities
which are not too plentiful today.
Naturally, I don't know, but some
times I just wonder who our ene
mies—all of our enemies—are.
And in southern Russia Rostov has
fallen and the Nazis are just a little
under 50 miles from Stalingrad. If
Marshal Simeon Timoshenko is to
make his big stand anywhere it
would seem to have to be along the
great Don River. Some reports have
it that the Germans have forced
crossings along the Don near Tsimey
ansk, which is southwest of Stalin
grad and almost due east of Rostov.
These reports seem pretty reliable,
but the reports that the Nazis have
succeeded in slipping across the
great stream at its bend near Stalin
grad are as yet unconfirmed. Never
theless. the situation is desperate.

TPIMOSHENKO obviously no longer
has either the men or the mate
rial with which to hold solidly
against the gray-green hordes of
Hitler. Reason says that only a minor
miracle can save what remains of
the Caucasus, and yet—if Timoshen
ko's men had yielded to reason's
sober incantations they might have
yielded long ago. The minor miracle
might come in the form of an
Anglo-American second front, but I
personally have my doubts about
such a possibility. There still seems
to be too much confusion and too
little leadership in Washington and
even London (incredible as it
sounds) to put very much hope in
the second front ide,».
