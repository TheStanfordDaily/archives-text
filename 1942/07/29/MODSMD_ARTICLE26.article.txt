# 'Eagle Squadron' Throws Jolting Punch at Complacency
## 
### 
'•EAGLE SQUADRON," now play-*
in» at the Mayfield Theater.
Although a Hollywood plot has
been skillfully woven into the Battle |
of Britain, "Eagle Squadron" still re
tains enough of the guts of war to
make it a powerful picture.
The story of American volunteers
in the RAF Eagle Squadron is un
folded against a background of the
savage London blitzkriegs and Luft- '
waffe dogfights.
The sweep and speed of the picture
j carry the spectator into the midst of j
I the fastest and most deadly battle of
history. But the RAF pilots value
death as cheap in terms of the lib
erty for which they're fighting.
Walter Wanger's deft touch has
laid bare the heart of Britain during
those dark days when Nazi bomber |
fleets were pounding London into
rubble. "Eagle Squadron" portrays j
the superhuman work the RAF did |
during those November blitzkriegs—
giving life to Churchill's words that j
"never before in history have so j
many owed so much to so few."
"Eagle Squadron" carries a power
ful message—its purpose is to make j

♦ the war more immediate and real to
j complacent Americans. And it's
packed with enough punch to jolt
that "it can't happen here" attitude
out of every spectator.—Allen
