### ESTHER BELEW 
During these days when unsung
heroes are being discovered in many
fields, there are still some who go
unnoticed.
In this category may be put the
Y.W.C.A. social service group, which
has been going to the migrant camp
near San Jose to teach various
handicrafts to 35 children who vary
in age from 10 months to 16 years.
The work of the girls, who in
struct every Wednesday and Friday
afternoon for two hours, includes
telling stories, teaching games, and
showing how to make dolls from
rags and stockings, wall decorations
from paper plates, and beads from
macaroni. '
The Stanford group was the only
one to respond to a request by the
director, Miss Dorothy Davis, for
girls from the colleges in this area
to help in the work. Because the
fruit work in which the migrants are
engaged is nearly completed for the
season, this week will be last for the
Y group.
The work carried on by the Stan
ford girls and by various groups of
girls in all parts of the state is doing
much to better living habits and
conditions of the migrants, according
to Miss Davis.
