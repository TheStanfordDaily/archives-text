# Soldiers to Aid In Stamp Drive
## 
### 
Soldiers from the Page Mill Road
Camp will aid the War Stamp Com
mittee today by selling stamps from
booths on the campus. A ride in a
jeep will be offered to anyone who
buys a war bond from one of the
booths.
"Although the purchase of a $1,000
bond carried stamp receipts to an
all-time high last week, the Stamp
Committee hopes that the soldiers'
help and the interest created by Vic
tory Day will cause the students to
set another record," said Nancy Pel
ton, the head of sales from booths.
An extra stamp booth will be
placed in front of Memorial Hall
from 9 to 12 in the morning. The
other booths will carry on sales at
the usual hours, and the soldiers will
continue to help until the booths
close.
"One of the purposes of Victory
Day," according to a War Board
statement, "is to increase the weekly
total of $1,500 in stamps and bonds
that the campus is now buying. In a
nine-month period, purchases have
already passed the $10,000 mark.
