# Stanford Co-ed Charges Aroff In 'Gift Talk'
## Pat Bouchard Says Farm Ensigns Asked To Give Presents 
### 
Patty Bouchard, '43, told a gen
eral court-martial yesterday that
Lieut. Comdr. Maurice N. Aroff at a
hotel dinner party had suggested to
two newly commissioned Navy en
signs, "Now that you boys are in,
how about getting me something?"
The Stanford co-ed testified that
Aroff, on trial for charges ranging
from scandalous conduct to false
hood, had said to Irving Cummings
Jr., '40, former Farm football player,
and Mickey Levee, '42, head of Ral
lycom last year:
"Irv—you get me some cuff links.
And Mickey—you get me a white
gold identification bracelet, with my
name and blood type on it."
This was all done in a laughing
manner, said Miss Bouchard, but she
testified that Aroff had immediately
held out his wrist for measurement
with a piece of thread.
Miss Bouchard was the first wit
ness that Judge Advocate Lieut. Irv
ing Klein brought to the stand to
support charges that Aroff had vio
lated Navy regulations by accepting
gifts from government employees
making less money than does Aroff.
The prosecution will attempt to
prove that Aroff accepted a pair of
$40 gold cuff links from Cummings,
another pair of cuff links from En
sign Lawrence Stromberg, and a $950
car from Tony Martin.
Miss Bouchard said that Levee had
later written her and asked for the
thread with which she had measured
Aroff's wrist. But Levee did not
send Aroff the bracelet, she said, be
cause he found that they were too
expensive.
