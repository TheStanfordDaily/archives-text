# Farm Stamp Sales Rise to Over $1300
## 
### 
War stamp sales skyrocketed
again this week, with all all-out
effort that brought in $1319.25.
Discounting the boost given to last
week's sales by a $1.000-bond sale,
this week's figure hits a new Sum
mer Quarter high, surpassing the
old mark by more than $200.
"The Victory Day program, com
plete with a mock battle and free
jeep rides, undoubtedly was the
spark for yesterday's high mark,"
Nancy Schermerhorn, drive chair
man, remarked last night.
Women's living groups averaged
SO per cent, while men's groups
reached nearly that mark. How
ever. five fraternities contributed
100 per cent, while only three casas
reached the 90 per cent class.
