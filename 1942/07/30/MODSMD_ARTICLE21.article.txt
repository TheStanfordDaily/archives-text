### CYCLONE COVEY 
(Cyclone Covey, Daily Review
Editor, herewith presents, upon
popular demand, his highly au
thoritative ten-best movie list. —
Editor's Note.)

In response to persistent accusa
tion that I have already rated over
20 pictures in my first-ten movie list,
and also to somewhat less persistent
requests from exactly three readers
as to just what pictures are now so
rated, I herewith hazard to print my
very highly authoritative top ten se
lections, so far (so far, mind you) in
1942.
Contrary to general misconception,
an investigation of Daily files re
veals only four pictures to have been
mentioned in connection with a first
ten rating; to those four I would add
three which appeared during vaca
tion and so unreviewed, and three
more reviewed and rated highly.
This list, not necessarily in order,
will naturally fluctuate as future
films effect displacements.
(1) The Invaders, (2) Kings Row,
(3) Saboteur, (4) Tortilla Flat, (5)
Moontide, (6) My Favorite Blonde.
(7) Dangerously They Live, (8) Joan
of Paris, (9) To Be or Not to Be,
(10) Mister V.
By my diagnosis the winter sea
son. although it turned out. such
films as "Ball of Fire" and ''The
Man Who Came to Dinner," in no
way compared to the consistent qual
ity of the spring season or that of
the summer season in progress.
I also nominate "My Gal Sal" as
the year's most pretentious flop.
