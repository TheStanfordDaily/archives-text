COFTBALL ALL-STARS?
k llow's for arranging an all-star
Softball team from the Stanford
summer league to meet the win
ner of Palo Alto's league? There
are enough outstanding players in
the local league, we hope, to give
the downtowners a ball game.
The Stanford leagues' play-offs
come up next week, and after that,
if studying for finals doesn't inter- j
fere, we'll have it around gently but
firmly and make our all-star picks j
then.

piED TYPERS VNPY:
In deference to other noble
nines this will be short and in
sipid. Anywow, the Pied Typers.
composed of Daiiynien plus a
would-be New York Yankee and a
Stanford quarterback, won their
second non-consecutive game
Tuesday in softball pennant scram
ble. brush for the bunting, chase
for the pennant, run for the rag,
and or what have you.
Should the Pied ones win today
they may get into the consolation
round. If they don't, they won't.
Pied players will apply pink lit
mus to (he radius and the ulna of
pitcher James Pollard's good right
wing to figure the solution—of to
day's hurling problem.
hould the rosy fabric turn blue
the solution is a basic one, and if
there's anything the Typers need, it's
something basic. Basically, the Typ
ers haven't a thing on the ball, but
their unrealized potentialities broke i
forth in that famous, oft-used "rash j
of base hits" Tuesday to win 17-4.
They'll probably do an el foldo
today, but one neva knows, do
one?

IyTAYBE YOU DIDN'T KNOW:
That Bob Helliwell, Stanford's
fencer terrifico, is teaching begin
ning epee, saber, and foil in the ab
sence of Elwyn Bugge, who is vaca
tioning.
That baseballs fouled out of At
lanta's Southern Association will be J
worth their weight in war bonds and \
stamps to the finders. All baseballs i
will be stamped, and those grabbing,
the fouled horsehide can exchange it
for whatever amount is stamped on
it. Jeez, what a stampede there'll be
for those fouls: one $50 bond ball
will be in play!
That Carl Pedersen, Stanford crew
toach. is seeking a training launch to
be used next fall for the Redskin
oarsmen. Any yachtsman with
something in the way of a boat that
makes 25 miles per with lots of free
board is kindly asked to see Peder
sen if he has any designs on selling
it.
That almost every guy and gal at
the Army demonstration yesterday
knew softball hurler Ellis Mahan
was the corporal in charge of the j
37 mm. anti-tank squad.
At Ryan High Voltage Lab was 1

COFTBALL ALL-STARS?

Softball team from the Stanford
summer league to meet the win

are enough outstanding players in
the local league, we hope, to give

The Stanford leagues' play-offs

if studying for finals doesn't inter- j

firmly and make our all-star picks j
then.
