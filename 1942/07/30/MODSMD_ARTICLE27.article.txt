# Help the Other Guy

### 
STANFORD has lots of red
hot ideas for aiding the war
effort, but they are not utilized
by the students who can really
get much out of them if they
would only try. To bring these
/ague generalities down to spe
cific cases, believe it or not, but
we have a co-operaitve driving
program on the campus for the
earless many.
Basically this venture is sup
posed to include all members of
'he student body who have cars
or who want rides. The idea is
or those who are willing to
help our potential pedestrians to
;ign up at the designated spot
and for the tired pedestrians to
also sign up for rides. This is a
airly simple arrangement and
has several advantages.
Aside from the obvious boon
o walkers, it offers car owners
who feel that they cannot af
ord to drive all of the time to
arrange with other car owners
.so that tires and gas can be
saved by all parties. This effort
also gives students an opportu
nity to meet people whom they
orobably would never have met
oefore. According to all reports,
some pretty good guys don't
iave cars and the same is prob
ably true of car owners.
At Lagunita the girls have an
arrangement by which a piece
of paper is placed at the desk
and girls who want rides at cer
ain times or girls who will have
room in their cars at certain
imes write the information
down and then arrangements
are made accordingly.
Many of the workers in de
fense plants have similar plans,
more along the "share your car"
idea. All of these are commend
able and should be used. Pos
sibly those of us who didn't
know about the school-wide Co
operative Driving Effort will not
have to spend so much time
waiting for rides at Wilson's or
at the 'Y' turn now.
