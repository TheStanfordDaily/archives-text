# PROBLEM OF THE WEEK
## 
### 
JJAVE you ever laid awake nights
wondering whether or not more
rubber was used up driving those
jeeps around than was collected by
them in their driving? I have been
told that those 10-ply tires wear out
at an alarming rate when driven over
40 miles an hour, and seeing them
zoom around the campus full of
happy soldiers and co-eds has given
me considerable worry.
For example, one soldier picked up
a 3-by-4-inch piece of rubber mat
ting and a 25-cent defense stamp,
and spent the next 35 minutes riding
around campus with the donors of
the aforementioned mat and stamp,
who by some coincidence were fresh
man women.
Think that over.
