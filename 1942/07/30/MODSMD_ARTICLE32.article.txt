# STEAMING ON THE QUAD?
## 
### 
JN LINE with The Daily's campaign
to quench all smoking on the
quad, may I suggest to the Corp
Yard that they close up all vents
of the steam tunnels under the quad.
Tuesday mornnig I distinctly saw
smoke, or at least steam, escaping
from one of these vents.
Granted that this is just an isolated
example, still it would be setting a
bad example for the kiddies if this
were to happen often.
