# Stanford Kitchens Feed 5,000 Students Per Day
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
(Editor's Note: This is the third in the series of articles depicting
Stanford as it looks from behind the scenes.)

It was late afternoon and a chef strode outside to an elm, where hung
an iron triangle. He began to hammer it. And young Stanford descended
en masse on that spot in horsedrawn buggies, tandems, and on foot. That

was the Cellar in the ISDO's. "
It's a different story todayâ€”the
chef doesn't have time to pound an
iron; he has to cook 5,000 meals
daily. Atop the Cellar is a corps of
graduate dieticians headed by Mrs.
Dorothy Bell, in Miss Christine flick
er's absence. Here the making of
menus for the campus eating groups
is supervised. By a nutritional yard
stick, calories, vitamins and carbohy
drates are all figured into the diet.
It took Mrs. Bell four years at lowa
State College and intensified study
of home economics and chemistry of
foods to qualify her for this job.
CENTRAL BAKERY
There's a central bakery in Encina
which turns out every snail, dough
nut, cake and cookie consumed by
the eating groups. The ovens get
warmed up in the wee hours and by
3 a.m. the dough begins to swell and
brown.
The capacity of the ovens is tre
mendous. Twenty-four hundred
doughnuts is a normal figure for one
day. Nevertheless, quantity is not
achieved at the expense of quality.
"These asinine stories about our
use of skimmed milk and powdered
eggs are nonsense," exclaimed Mrs.
Bell.
"In the face of climbing food
prices we continue to maintain nu
tritional standards," she added.
WAR MAKES PROBLEM
The war is making the proposi
tion of feeding the Stanford com
munity continually more difficult.
However, Mrs. Bell has adopted
the philosophical code of the pony
express, and even though the chef
and his relief walked out without
notice last week, the public was
scarcely aware of the frantic activity
behind the scenes.
"It took everyone's arms and legs

to do it," she remarked with gritted
teeth.
The war has also made kitchen
equipment scarce. The new electric
bake oven for the Union is lost for
the duration and as Mrs. Bell tersely
said, "We're guarding silverware
with our lives."
WHOLESALE COMMISSSARY
Since no concern in Palo Alto is
able to supply the Farm with such
quantities as 700 pounds of spinach,
the Stanford Wholesale Commissary
was set up in 1922 to facilitate co
operative buying for the Union, fra
ternities and sororities, which is done
at the large San Francisco markets.
Besides the large-scale diets for
the bulk of students, there is a spe
cial diet table at Encina for indi
viduals demanding exceptional foods.
Twenty-five diabetic enjoy the ad
vantages of this set-up, which is
unique among American colleges.
Like the vacationing mailman, Mrs.
Bell devotes her sojourns to quests
for new glamour foods. "I keep on
the alert for new foods with eye
appeal, and derive pleasure from
tearing new foods to pieces to see
what they're made of."
