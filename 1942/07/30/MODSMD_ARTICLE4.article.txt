### BILL DILLINGER 
Stressing the importance of per
sonal participation in the nation's
war effort, Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur shared the stage with a
panel of student leaders in yester
day's Victory Day program in Me
morial Ilall.
"Try to he a participant. Don't
be satisfied with just being a spec
tator," was Chancellor Wilbur's
admonition to the overflowing
crowd of students and faculty. He
urged everyone to engage in some
form of war work, and to support
actively the various civilian war
programs, emphasizing that even
the most minor thing when done by
130,000,000 people becomes import
ant.
Chancellor Wilbur, supporting a
point made by Ensign Frankie Al
bert, stated that the nation needs

leaders even more than it needs
manpower, and that it is to the col
leges that the nation looks for
these leaders.
"Keep in school as long as the
government will let you, to train
yourself to be a better leader; the
government will find you if it
wants you," was the Chancellor's
advice.
While urging students to train
themselves in engineering, foreign
languages, arid other skills of im
mediate military value, Chancellor
Wilbur showed a certain optimism
about the future. "Youth will have
a great opportunity," he said, "for
they will live in a world made
small and interdependent by this
emergency."
In the panel discussion. Bob
Knox, as an entering freshman,
quizzed student leaders Ed Stamm,

Chris Moody, Betsey Wilson,
Lawrence Grannis, and Ensign Al
bert on the problems of student
war activities.
Stamm outlined campus air raid
precautions, naming the various
shelters on campus and calling for
students to man the volunteer fire
and police squads needed in such
emergencies.
Grannis urged students to con
serve what they have and to give
generously all the surplus articles
they have that the country needs.
Miss Wilson told of the work of
the War Board Workroom and the
Blood Bank, and Miss Moody asked
students to become informed about
the war so that they may co-oper
ate in the war effort more wisely
and more fully. Ensign Albert
spoke on the need for leadership
in war.
