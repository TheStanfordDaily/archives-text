# Scattered Snuff Retards Tartuffe
## 
### 
"A-a-aâ€”choo!"
Allan Treat sneezed into a snuff
box. The powder was blown about
the stage. The cast sneezed. Result:
Asher Wilson, co-director of "Tar
tuff e," was forced to call off re
hearsals for several minutes yester
day while he and the actors recov
ered from the blow.
The French comedy by Moliere
calls for the use of a snuff box dur
ing the action of the play. Treat,
who is playing the role of Cleante,
decided to add a bit of realism to the
action and recently bought a box of
snuff. However, since yesterday's
mishap, it has been decided to sub
stitute a more innocent powder for
the snuff.
The play will open August 13 for
a three-day run at the Little Theater.
Tickets are now on sale at the Me
morial Hall Box Office.
