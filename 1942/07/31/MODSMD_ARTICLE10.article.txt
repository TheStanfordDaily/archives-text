# Card Gridders to Play U.S.C. Here
## Use of Kezar Too Difficult, Masters Says 
### DON SELBY 
The long-bandied-about problem
of the location of the Stanford-U.S.C.
football game Oct. 24 was settled
yesterday with the announcement by
A1 Masters, Stanford B.A.C. head,
that the game will definitely be
played here instead of at Kezar.
Masters and Jim Needles, U.S.F.
athletic director, have long been dis
cussing the advisability of playing
the Indian-Trojan game and the
U.S.F.-San Jose State game as a
double-header on Oct. 24 in Kezar*
the advantage from the Stanford
point of view being that such an
arrangement would do away with a
large part of the spectator transpor
tation problem.
"But I now believe that in view
of the difficulty such a plan would
bring up in ticket distribution, it
would be better to have the game
played here," Master said.
''Furthermore, the U.S.C. game will
be the only one of major importance
to be played here this fall and it will
be much better for the students front
that point of view. It would also ba
difficult to take care of four stu-<
dent rooting sections at Kezar, which
is the problem we would face if the
Stanford-U.S.C. and U.S.F.-San Jose
State games were played as a double
header."
The number of spectators to be
allowed to attend the game here has
not been limited yet. Whether or not
it will be cannot be predicted up to
game time.
