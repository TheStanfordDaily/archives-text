# B.A.C. to Decide Frosh Grid Fate Monday
## Coaching Staff Vacancy to Be Filled by Board 
### 
Whether or not Stanford will have
a freshman football team with regu
larly scheduled games will be de
cided at the Board of Athletic Con
trol meeting Monday afternoon, at
which time the board will also act
on the 1942-43 budget.
The board will also discuss the
coaching situation, for, with Vic
Lindskog, recently appointed as
sistant football coach, still undecided
as to whether he will accept the posi
tion or play professional football,
Stanford may soon find itself with a
vacancy on the coaching staff.
In making plans for the first-year
team, the board will probably make
one of three decisions:
1. Junk the freshman team en
tirely.
2. Have the team and coach as
usual.
3. Form a "B" team of freshmen
and third and fourth string varsity
players.
FAVORS DROPPING FROSH
When Jim Lawson took over as
head football coach last spring, he
stated that he was very much in fa
vor of dropping the freshman grid
schedule, substituting instead a play
whereby the frosh gridders would
practice with the varsity.
"I would prefer that system even
when no war emergency exists,"
Lawson said at that time.
. Marchie Schwartz, named acting
head coach of Stanford's football
team when Lawson enlisted in the
Navy before the start of Summer
Quarter, has not made any state
ments about the freshman team.
LIMITATION EXPECTED
Dr. O. N. Andersen, School of
Health director, said last night he ex
pected the frosh schedule would be
abandoned. But if it is not, he point
ed out, the games will probably be
limtied to the home field bccause of
the transportation problem.
Should the third plan be adopted
by the board, the combination would
probably schedule Army training
camp teams, but the main emphasis
would be on the team's use as scrim
mage opposition for the varsity.
SIGNS WITH BEARS
Since Hampton Pool, star guard on
the Indian team of 1939 and an end
on the Chicago Bears for the past
two seasons, has signed with the
Bears for the coming fall grid cam
paign, the list of eligible coaches to
join the Stanford coach staff, if
Lindskog does play pro ball, has
been cut considerably.
