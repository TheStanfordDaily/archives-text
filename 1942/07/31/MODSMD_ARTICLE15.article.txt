# Army Team Wins 'B' Softball Title, 'A' League in Triple Tie
## 
### ZIP WALT 
After the dust had settled follow
ing the final games of the Summer
Quarter Softball League yesterday,
one league winner was certain, while
the other had one team that is cer
tain of a tie, and two others that
have hopes of a tie, providing their
tied games can he played off.
Playoffs for the university cham
pionship and consolation crown be
gin on Tuesday. It is hoped that all
the tie games will be played off to
day and Monday so that final stand
ings may be computed.
The U.S. Army finished on top of
League B with eight straight wins,
the only team to have an undefeated
season.
But League A is a little more con
fused. Zeta Psi, after playing off its
ties, is certain of a tie for first place
with seven wins and one loss. Alpha
Sig-Theta Chi has one defeat, but two
tie games to play off, one of which is
with Encina 11-111, which also has
but one defeat to its credit. But be
fore this can be played off, the Alpha
Sig-Theta Chis have a tie game still
pending with the Chi Psis.
SPOTLIGHT GAME
On July IG, the two teams tied. 10-
10. and later played it off, only to
end in a 3-3 tie. They again tried
to decide who the winner was, and
again ended in a deadlocked score.
Figuring that they had played each
other enough, they decided to call
the tie off, providing the outcome of
the game was not vital to the out
come of the league standings. Now
the game is taking the spotlight, and
a winner cannot be determined un
til the tie is played off.
The Socialists, composed of mem
bers of the Educational Workshop,
have disbanded, and will not enter
the playoff round.
ENCINA 11-111 RALLIES
Trailing the Alpha Delts 5-3 going
into the last inning, the Encina 11-TII
men rallied to win 6-5. John Paulis'

two-base hit scored the winning
runs. Lloyd Merriman stared in the
field. The victory proved to be costly
for the Encinamen, for catcher John
Sadler broke his finger during a play
at the plate. â€¢
After getting off to a shaky start,
the Zetes pushed over four runs in
the second and nine runs in the next
inning to wax the Fijis, 13-4.
Successive hits by Dick Northon,
Ed Stamm, and Jeff Bromfield led
the attack. Jeff Bromfield. who
sparked the team to victory, had
good backing from a well-function
ing infield.
Ellis Mahan gave up but one hit in
the few innings he hurled for the
U.S. Army in their easy 9-1 victory
over the 'Menlo Oaks. The hitting
attack was led by Tony Brishe, who
got three for four at bat.
FREE HITTING GAME
The Upper Row pulled a sensa
tional rally in a free-hitting game to
beat Encina 18, 17-11. Leading at the
third inning by three runs, the Up
per Row kicked the ball all over the
infield, and pitcher Bill Ritter lost
much of his "stuff," enabling the
frosh to slip 10 runs across the plate
to take the lead.
But the Row men were not out of
the race, for they came right back
into the lead, scoring eight runs. En
cina tied the count at 11-11 in the
fifth, but their opponents found the
hurling of Art Shafer, and scored six
runs.
TRIP LOWER ROW
Alpha Sig-Theta Chi pulled an
other game out of the fire in the last
inning to score three runs and trip
the Lower Row, 5-2. Harry Booth,
who pitched tight ball throughout,
and John Moeur singled, and Eu
gene Foster batted them in to break
the 2-2 deadlock. Phil Rice's field
ing for the winners was a big aid in
the victory.
Pete Jones, aided by the fielding
of Harry Parsons at third base,

hurled one-hit ball to beat the Pied
Typers, 4-0.
Herb Bull's Biz Wigs won by de
fault from the Socialists.
Cliff Wells pitched for the Slave
Drivers in their close 3-2 game over
the Spar Ducks. Carl Ross was in
jured when rugged left fielder for
the Spar Ducks, Ned Johns, slid into
second base. Art Miller and A1
Lewis starred for the losers, while
John Bunn, Red Holman, and Chuck
Winterbui'n looked good for the
losers.
