IT'S interesting to hear every- j
one moan when midquarters
ire on deck or when finals are
Dnly a few days off, but it's
more interesting to see how
nany students come back to
Stanford to visit during their
/acations. This quarter at least
20 Stanfordites who are not en
rolled this quarter, but who will
be back in the fall, have drop
ped around to the Shack, to the
Libe, or even to classrooms, ex
plaining, "I just couldn't stay
iway."
What is this fatal charm Stan
ford has over its undergraduates
who continue to drop back to
see how things are going in
their absence?
