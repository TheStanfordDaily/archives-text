magic word of the magic man,
Josef Stalin, said yesterday to
the Russian army, "Stop retreating."
This may work. Nothing else
thus far has. The Russians are still
retreating, or were, at least, until
the order of the strong man of
Russia came through. I am not be
ing facetious when I say that the
words of Stalin may halt, may even
turn, the Nazis. The man is un
deniably strong, undeniably be
lieved in. He consolidated the
gains of the Russian Revolution.
He strengthened the whole frame
work of Russian economic life. He
will be one of history's remember
ed figures. And his say-so may
be just enough to put a touch more
of starch into the backs of every
Russian soldier, the difference be
tween victory along the bloody and
straining Don line and defeat.
Avid yet, it is difficult for me to
see how words will win anything for
the Allies at this crucial hour. If
anybody enjoys the confidence of his
people it is, I believe, Stalin. His
record, it is true, is not clean. He
was not one of the leaders in the
Revolution of February, 1917, in
Russia which swept Tsardom from its
rotten pedestal. If he had led his fol
lowers at that time, Bolshevism in
all probability would have imme
diately acceded to the power which
the Tsar could no longer hold
(neither Lenin nor Trotsky were in
Russia in February, 1917).

was not an outstanding
k personality of the October Revo
lution. He followed in the steps of
Lenin and Trotsky, and for services
rendered was appointed Commis
sioner of Nationalities (or some
equivalent title) near the end of
1917. He served, was not particularly
close to Lenin, and did not rise to
promnience until it became appar
ent that Lenin was going to die in
1923. Then came plans. Lenin died.
And Leon Trotsky, one of the
most brilliant brains that the Twen
tieth Century has produced, was ex
iled from his native land to live an
embittered decline and to die with
an assassin's 4-inch dagger-wound
in his head.
But with Trotsky's exile Stalin's
fortunes picked up, naturally, and
gradually he spun a plan of prac
tical Communism (State Social
ism?) which has tremendously en
larged the strength of the U.S.S.R.
The ideological effects of the Stalin
program may have hurt his nation
but that is not the point. Except
for the notorious Moscow trials of
1933 and 1934 and the enigmatic
pact with Hitler in 1939 Stalin's
record since about 192(5 has been
good. And his power is absolute
because a faith in him exists. That
is the main thing today, despite the
splotchy record.

that matter, in a totally dif
ferent set-up in which our lead
er, especially in wartime, is sup
posed to be spotless. FDR's recent
appointment of the Hague man, Tom
Meaney, to a Federal judgeship, is
not an event with the halo of a Sun
day school picnic. Winston Church
ill. too. could be raked over some of
these coals.
But let that he as it may. The '
point is that the three most pow- j
erful anti-Axis leaders enjoy the
confidence of the vast majority of
their people. Their people believe
most of what their leaders tell
them and try. pretty much, to ful
fill (lie demands and the pleadings
of those leaders. That is why I
say that Stalin's order to the Red
Army may work.
But I must doubt a little. Words
are fine in many situations but what i
we are in today is not won very
much with words. That is why, also.
I am becoming a little doubtful
about our constant "pledges" to get (
that second front opened. I'm not

This may work. Nothing else

the order of the strong man of
Russia came through. I am not be

He strengthened the whole frame

the Allies at this crucial hour. If
anybody enjoys the confidence of his
people it is, I believe, Stalin. His

was not one of the leaders in the
Revolution of February, 1917, in
Russia which swept Tsardom from its
rotten pedestal. If he had led his fol

1923. Then came plans. Lenin died.

for the notorious Moscow trials of

magic word of the magic man,
Josef Stalin, said yesterday to
the Russian army, "Stop retreating."
This may work. Nothing else
thus far has. The Russians are still
retreating, or were, at least, until
the order of the strong man of
Russia came through. I am not be
ing facetious when I say that the
words of Stalin may halt, may even
turn, the Nazis. The man is un
deniably strong, undeniably be
lieved in. He consolidated the
gains of the Russian Revolution.
He strengthened the whole frame
work of Russian economic life. He
will be one of history's remember
ed figures. And his say-so may
be just enough to put a touch more
of starch into the backs of every
Russian soldier, the difference be
tween victory along the bloody and
straining Don line and defeat.
Avid yet, it is difficult for me to
see how words will win anything for
the Allies at this crucial hour. If
anybody enjoys the confidence of his
people it is, I believe, Stalin. His
record, it is true, is not clean. He
was not one of the leaders in the
Revolution of February, 1917, in
Russia which swept Tsardom from its
rotten pedestal. If he had led his fol
lowers at that time, Bolshevism in
all probability would have imme
diately acceded to the power which
the Tsar could no longer hold
(neither Lenin nor Trotsky were in
Russia in February, 1917).

was not an outstanding
k personality of the October Revo
lution. He followed in the steps of
Lenin and Trotsky, and for services
rendered was appointed Commis
sioner of Nationalities (or some
equivalent title) near the end of
1917. He served, was not particularly
close to Lenin, and did not rise to
promnience until it became appar
ent that Lenin was going to die in
1923. Then came plans. Lenin died.
And Leon Trotsky, one of the
most brilliant brains that the Twen
tieth Century has produced, was ex
iled from his native land to live an
embittered decline and to die with
an assassin's 4-inch dagger-wound
in his head.
But with Trotsky's exile Stalin's
fortunes picked up, naturally, and
gradually he spun a plan of prac
tical Communism (State Social
ism?) which has tremendously en
larged the strength of the U.S.S.R.
The ideological effects of the Stalin
program may have hurt his nation
but that is not the point. Except
for the notorious Moscow trials of
1933 and 1934 and the enigmatic
pact with Hitler in 1939 Stalin's
record since about 192(5 has been
good. And his power is absolute
because a faith in him exists. That
is the main thing today, despite the
splotchy record.

that matter, in a totally dif
ferent set-up in which our lead
er, especially in wartime, is sup
posed to be spotless. FDR's recent
appointment of the Hague man, Tom
Meaney, to a Federal judgeship, is
not an event with the halo of a Sun
day school picnic. Winston Church
ill. too. could be raked over some of
these coals.
But let that he as it may. The '
point is that the three most pow- j
erful anti-Axis leaders enjoy the
confidence of the vast majority of
their people. Their people believe
most of what their leaders tell
them and try. pretty much, to ful
