Stanford as it looks behind the

Carl Meyers, as a young boy of 14,
took a fourth-class berth on a trans
oceanic steamer and came to Cali
fornia from Germany. Following the
training his father had given him, he
began work in begonia gardens.
This month, Carl Meyers drank a
quiet toast to his 37th year as a
Stanford nurseryman. For 37 years
his fingers have deftly packed soil at
the base of begonias and a wide va
riety of plants. Today he is white
haired and slightly bent, but his five
acre nursery behind the museum
flourishes as it always has within the
glass walls of three vast greenhouses.
ENLARGED NURSERY
During the spring, when the nurs
ery is the busiest, a single bench in
the 90-foot greenhouse contains
10,000 cuttings and plants. Later,
they are transplanted to campus
grounds. In addition to replenish
ing flower beds throughout the cam
pus, Meyers keeps the vases of La
gunita, Roble and the Chapel filled
with seasonal blooms.
When he first took over the Stan
ford nursery in 1905 there was one
inadequate greenhouse. He built the
other two shortly thereafter and took
on three helpers. Today the en
larged nursery plays an important
function behind the scenes by add
ing soft color to the campus.
RODENT ENEMIES
Meyers lifted his straw hat and
ran his fingers through white hair.
"My biggest enemies are not the
Nazis or Japs today, but the rabbit,
who nips off the buds of my outdoor
plants, and the mole, who attacks
them at the roots," he said.
