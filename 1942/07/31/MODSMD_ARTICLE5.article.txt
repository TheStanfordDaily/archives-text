# Blood Donors Aid U.S. Navy

### KEITH BENNETT 
Fireman Second Class Albert J.
Heick. USN, is glad to be alive. And
he's surprised to be alive. Albert
Hcick was at Pearl Harbor on De
cember 7, and was burned beyond
recognition.
For four nights the doctors thought
that Heick was a living dead man,
but they kept shooting blood plasma
into him, and he began a miraculous
recovery. The doctors said that
blood plasma saved his life, and as
Heick put it, "I'm ready to believe
them."
Today Heick may be back on the
business end of a 16-inch gun. He
wanted to .go back again; and with
the help of 11 quarts of blood plasma,
he was in shape to do it.
Heick was only one of the 150 men
in the same naval hospital whom
plasma saved or helped to save.
On the first or third Thursdays of
a month, a gleaming white truck
marked "Red Cross Blood Donor
Service" rolls into Palo Alto to ac
cept volunteer blood donations for
use of plasma in similar cases. On
July 1 it had rolled out with a total
of 273 pints of blood.
The entire process is very simple.
To sign up as a volunteer, obtain
your parents' permission if you are
under 21, and then give a pint of
blood.
