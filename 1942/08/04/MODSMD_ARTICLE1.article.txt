# 'Flying Indians' to Celebrate Opening of Naval Auditorium
## 
### 
The Livermore Naval Air Base will celebrate the completion of a big
new auditorium with a sport dance for the airmen at 8:.'50 on Wednesday
evening, August 5.
Stanford's "Flying Indians," composed entirely of Stanford volunteers
and led by Wing Commander Don Burness, was formed under the Navy's

V-5 program with the privilege of
remaining together throughout their
basic training period.
Shortly after they were inducted
into the Navy service three weeks
ago at the Oakland Naval Training
Station, the Indians were transferred
to the Livermore base.
Upon completion of the basic
course, they will be sent to one of
the advanced schools — Corpus
Christi, Jacksonville, or Pcnsacola—
for six months of advanced train
ing. The last part of the training pe
riod, approximately 100 hours, the
members of the group will be given
instruction in specialty branches to
which they may be assigned.
The cream of the crop—footballers,
newsmen, and student leaders —have
gone into this branch of military
service. They will leave behind them
in this new field an even brighter
record than the one they left at
Stanford.
