# Mrs. Miniver Described As Fine Art
## 
### 
"MRS. MINIVER," now playing
at the Stanford.
In its unprecedented ninth week at
Radio City Music Hall, and by other
than box office tokens a monument
in cinema history, "Mrs. Miniver"
demonstrates the motion picture as
having evolved to the peerage of fine
art as well as to a ranking techno
logical phenomenon of the age.
Yet "Mrs. Miniver" is not spec
tacular. Alfred Hitchcock would
have made it so, and it would have
been as great, through his con
struction of split-timed suspenses.
But William Wyler makes a great
picture by the very opposite of
Hitchcock's technique: in the same
way that a Dickens or Tolstoy or
Hugo novel is great: being simply a
presentation of life, unglamorized
and un-Voltairized.
This is due in large part, aside
from the role of the young pilot, to
a magnificent cast. To say that Wy
ler, the picture, Walter Pidgeon, and
Greer Garson are now leading con
tenders for Academy Awards would
be a conservative statement.
And Teresa Wright, who in fact is
already nominated for an Academy
Award, and of whom Wyler said,
"She has never committed an error
in acting taste," makes her second
cinema appearance in "Mrs. Mini
ver," thereby being well launched
toward becoming the screen's great
est dramatic actress.â€”Covey
