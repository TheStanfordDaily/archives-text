The Cubberley Library in the
School of Education Building has re
cently installed a display of a com
plete collection of the Riverside Text
books in Education, published by
the Houghton Mifflin Company of
Boston.
Dr. Elwood P. Cubberley, late
dean emeritus of the school, was the
originator and editor of the series.
The first volume appeared in 1914
and the last, numbered 106, was pub
lished shortly before the death of Dr.
Cubberley in 1941. Other members
of the Stanford faculty who are rep
resented by volumes are Dr. J. S.
Sears, Dr. J. C. Almack, Dr. L. M.
Terman, Dr. M. Merrill, Dr. W. M.
Proctor, Dr W. C. Eells, and Dr.
L. E. Bassett.
Dr. Cubberley used the proceeds
accruing to him as author and editor
to finance the building of the School
of Education, which he personally
planned, and for the endowment of
the library to which the University
has given his name in commemora
tion of his life and work. An artistic
bookplate, designed by the Stanford
Press, portrays the dream of the new
building from an arch of the old
quad, and recites the part played by
the books in its realization.
