TN AN article in the Pacific
.jl Coast Edition of The Wall
Street Journal, Felix Morley has
outlined the benefits derived
from the accelerated educational
programs now being carried out
in some 600 colleges and uni
versities in every section of the
United States.
According to Morley, "Some
conseguences of the acceler
ated educational program are
already apparent. The shortage
Df man-power, both in agricul
ture and industry, has been
sharply emphasized this sum
mer by the curtailment of stu
dent workers."
He claims that whether ac
celeration proves a temporary
ohenomenon, or becomes the
standard practice in our col
leges, it will without guestion
oermanently modify many pre
war educational concepts and
orocedures.
As Morley says, "It is as yet
r oo early for anyone to speak
categorically. The general ex
perience of the past few weeks,
however, carries strong indica
tion that college administrations,
'acilities, and student bodies are
all benefitting from the pres
sures to which they are this
summer being subjected."
Morley adds that perhaps the
greatest gain brought the col
!eges by acceleration is taking
olace off campus. "Their activ
ity these summer months is
•velding them into their commu
nities in a manner which semi
professional football, fraternity
dances, and amateur dances
never accomplished.
"Whereas the country club
aspect of the college has in
creasingly produced a certain
contempt by 'town' for 'gown'
the sacrificial acceptance of a
12-month year, the voluntary
elimination of academic privi
lege, is now earning a new com
munity respect. The many new
services by the colleges in the
f ield of adult education and
good citizenship serve to con
firm this healthy leveling of
class and caste barriers."
Thus this new type of educa
tion is facing a big test as to
whether or not it will last after
the war or fade out with the de
cline of Germany, Italy, and
fapan.
Better start thinking about that
date for Friday niqht's barn
dance in the Women's Gym.
There'll be all kinds of dances
for all kinds of dancers. And it
will only be two bits, and you
can save your car because it's
on the campus.

"Whereas the country club
aspect of the college has in
creasingly produced a certain
contempt by 'town' for 'gown'
the sacrificial acceptance of a
12-month year, the voluntary
elimination of academic privi
lege, is now earning a new com
munity respect. The many new
services by the colleges in the
f ield of adult education and
good citizenship serve to con
firm this healthy leveling of
class and caste barriers."
Thus this new type of educa
tion is facing a big test as to
whether or not it will last after
the war or fade out with the de
cline of Germany, Italy, and
fapan.
Better start thinking about that
date for Friday niqht's barn
dance in the Women's Gym.
There'll be all kinds of dances
for all kinds of dancers. And it
will only be two bits, and you
can save your car because it's
on the campus.
TN AN article in the Pacific
.jl Coast Edition of The Wall
Street Journal, Felix Morley has
outlined the benefits derived
from the accelerated educational
programs now being carried out
in some 600 colleges and uni
versities in every section of the
United States.
According to Morley, "Some
conseguences of the acceler
ated educational program are
already apparent. The shortage
Df man-power, both in agricul
ture and industry, has been
sharply emphasized this sum
mer by the curtailment of stu
dent workers."
He claims that whether ac
celeration proves a temporary
ohenomenon, or becomes the
standard practice in our col
leges, it will without guestion
oermanently modify many pre
war educational concepts and
orocedures.
As Morley says, "It is as yet
r oo early for anyone to speak
categorically. The general ex
perience of the past few weeks,
however, carries strong indica
tion that college administrations,
'acilities, and student bodies are
all benefitting from the pres
sures to which they are this
summer being subjected."
Morley adds that perhaps the
greatest gain brought the col
!eges by acceleration is taking
olace off campus. "Their activ
ity these summer months is
•velding them into their commu
nities in a manner which semi
professional football, fraternity
dances, and amateur dances
never accomplished.
