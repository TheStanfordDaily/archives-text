### MIKE CHURCHILL 
ONCE
AGAIN
W/TIILE NOT what you would call
robust, this writer is again able
to pound a typewriter and before
anything else is done, wants to thank
Mike Kresge and H. D. Thoreau for
taking over while he languished in
Hospital.
There is no need to comment on
how well they did. After all, they
have their own ideas and the read
ers are able to judge for themselves.
Kresge, who wrote with so much
feeling about the hospital, finds him
self again confined. He is thanking
his restraint in keeping himself
from cracking wise about that insti
tution. Hospitals and pachyderms
never forget.

CAL
CO-EDS
W/HEN the San Francisco Exam
iner appeared with the head,
"Stanford Girl Tells of Aroff 'Gift
| Talk," it is not hard to believe that
I there was more than one Berkeley 8.,
pardon, girl who grabbed and quickly
read the story.
The hope was no doubt that there
was a moral charge involved and bit
ter must have been the disappoint
ment when it was discovered that
the whole matter concerned nothing
more livid than a friendly dinner
party.
To be perfectly fair, there were
some fellows in this "V-7 Heaven"
who were disappointed too,

PULSE
A NOTHER college paper reports
i that the Doctors at Chanute Field
i tell how the pulse rates of Univer- !
| sity ROTC students "were higher on •
| the average than the rates of men j
not attending a college."
The writer goes on to say that he
thinks that there must be some- i
thing significant about this but that;
he "Can't think of any good clean
| reason why."

I ENQUIRE ON
j OUR IRON
| last quarter this col
unin mentioned that there was a
j lot of iron about our campus that
' might well be converted to scrap. We :
didn't expect it to be gathered up, !
nor was that why we mentioned it.
Now, however, the government is
making an urgent appeal for scrap
metal. It is not just a patriotic cam
paign, it is a vital need.
Again, then, this column reminds
the Student Salvage Committee and
the University that those many iron
posts that line Galvez and Lasuen
Streets near the highway, that are
! back of the Library, and are scat
tered about the campus, would be of
better service to Stanford and the
j nation if they were parts of planes,
ships, and tanks.
This column is glad that we can
| choose whether or not we want to
give this scrap iron to the govern
ment. It would feel a lot better,
though, if that iron were defending
that right to choose.

PEOPLE WITH MINDS
A LOT LIKE FLOORMATS
i 'JpHE recent drive to collect floor
| mats (rubber) from the back of
cars was termed reasonably suc
cessful. There is no such thing. Un
less every car owner gave the rub
ber mat from back compartment and
turtleback then the drive was not a
success.
If those men. who still keep their i
j mats ever get caught by the enemy
J for lack of air or tank support I hope
they live long enough to remember
| their selfishness.
If those girls who still keep their
mats ever are employed by the Japs
in an old but not honorable profes- i
sion I hope they stay healthy long
enough to reflect on their selfish- i
ness.
