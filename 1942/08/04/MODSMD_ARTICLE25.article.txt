# Verna Hellings Strengthens New Summer Theater Play
## 
### 
"Hoe Corn, Dig 'Taters" might very
well be called just "Ho, Corn!"
This play, winner of the Etherege
Award through the Dramatist's Al
liance, tells the story of a Kentucky
hill gal and her problem of not be
coming an old maid at the age of 19.
It is finally decided that she will
marry the boy of that county who is
picked by the draft board. The army
doctor comes to make the inspection
,and falls in love with the gal, and
she visa versa.
Fortunately, none of the local boys
pass the physical, thanks to the
thoroughgoing work of worms and
malnutrition.
However, the county's pride is at
stake.
At this point a character called
Granny Fearsome, who has come to
the place to die (she's sure of it),
saves the day by discovering that the
doctor is the questionable son of a
former county resident.
The preacher who has come to
give the sermon for Granny marries
the two and everybody's happy.
There is no point to the play, and
the comedy plot is not strong, novel,
or funny enough to hold it together.
Some fine work was done, how
ever, by Verna Hellings, who played
Granny. She has a delightful style
that brings laughter out of rather

weak lines. She carried the play al
most alone and kept it going.
Patty Boyle, who was the gal, is a
good actress and would like to
see some more of her, but with a bet
ter part. Credit, too, should go to
Rosemary Wells, a widow, and Wil
liamson Gibson, a sergeant, who
made a good comedy team.
The co-author Gladys Wheeler
Charles said, when the award was
announced, that this was her first
play. We believe it. The show never
developed into anything better than
a fair high school play.
The Hillbarn Summer Theater,
which presented the show at the
Little Theater Friday night, will re
open it at their open-air theater in

San Mateo, August G to 9. Perhaps
the extra rehearsals will improve
the play considerably.â€”Oglesby
