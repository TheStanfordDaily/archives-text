# Tartuffe Faces New Problem
## High Heel Has Made Rough's Life Tough 
### 
High heels were never meant for
Stanford roughs, according to the
members of the "Tartuffe" cast.
"Tartuffe" comes to the main audi
torium of Memorial Hall on August
13 for a three-day run. The show,
set in the period of Louis XIV, calls
â€¢for high heels on the shoes of all the
men. A week of rehearsal has not

solved the difficulty completely. "It's
like learning to walk all over again,"
said Johnny Lawry, who is playing
the title role in the production.
Tommy Townsend as Valere has
the most difficult job with the shoes.
In the last act his entrance calls for
him to enter upstage center and run
as fast as possible down a long flight
of stairs to the stage floor. All went
well until he got his period shoes.
Townsend made the entrance but not
on his feet. It was dramatic but not
in period.
Long curled wigs that fall to the
shoulders have also been a sore spot
with the roughs. Difficulty in keep
ing the hair out of their faces has
given them another problem to
overcome.
Charles Vance, director of the
Memorial Theater, will leave to
morrow for service in the Army. He
will be replaced by Asher Wilson,
who will finish the directing of
"Tartuffe."
