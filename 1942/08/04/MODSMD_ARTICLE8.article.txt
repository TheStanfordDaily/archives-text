# Diploma Funds Show Decrease
## 
### 
Dimes contributions last night
slid into a low for the Summer
Quarter, raising the Dimes for Dip
lomas fund only $36.46. According
to figures released by Jim Mcßrier,
Rally Com chairman, all living
groups showed a proportionate lag
which indicated that the "dimes
habit" is not fully effective.
Lagunita, which has previously
held a consistent lead, contributed
$10.08 as contrasted to its high mark
of $18.95 last month. Collections
from the Wednesday stamp boxes
showed a 50 per cent drop from the
previous week, which Mcßrier at
tributed to the preoccupation of stu
dents on Victory Day.
$49.08 LAST WEEK
Last week, Dimes totaled $49.08,
and Mcßrier then hope that "this
was only a temporary slack" and
looked for an increase this week.
However, in view of the returns, he
commented that "it is apparent that
the campus enthusiasm needs to be
drastically rejuvenated."
With this in mind, the Rally Com
is sponsoring a Barn Dance Friday
evening. (For details see column 3.)
Returns from the affair will go into
the Dimes for Diplomas fund.
Here is the itemized account of
this week's collection:
Fijis $2.06
Sigma Chi 25
Chi Psi 48
Sigma Nu 1.23
Delta Chi 1.20
Alpha Sig 30
Alpha Delt 2.07
El Campo 90
Union 10.80
Cellar 4.82
Betas (lost box)
BEGUN LAST QUARTER
The Dimes campaign was inaugu
rated last quarter when it became
evident that many men students
would be compelled to leave Stan
ford before graduation to join the
armed services. It was anticipated
that the eventual armistice would
find a large proportion of them finan
cially unable to continue their edu
cation.
Thus the purpose of Dimes for
Diplomas was to finance at least 50 of
these men for one quarter at Stan
ford.
