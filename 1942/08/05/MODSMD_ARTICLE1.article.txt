# Grid Outlook Cloudy; Cards Slim on Backs
## Schwartz to Confer With Shaughnessy On Football Situation 
### DON SELBY 
"Is Ray Hammett going to be here
to play quarterback? Is there going
to be real interest in football on the
Coast this year?"
Those questions and many others
like them were buzzing around in
the head of Marchie Schwartz,
Stanford's head football coach since
late June, as he hurried here and
there in preparation for his 4 p.m.
departure yesterday for the East.
"I've come to the conclusion that
there is absolutely no use trying to
figure out who is going to play for
Stanford this fall," he declared. "I'm
just going to wait until the first day
of practice, September 9. then go out
on the practice field and see who is
here and who isn't."
TO SEE CLARK
Schwartz will take his family to
Omaha, Neb., and after a short visit,
will travel on to Chicago, where he
will witness the College All Star-
Chicago Bear game and where he
will confer with Clark D. Shaugh- j
nessy, Stanford's Cinderella mentor I
until he switched to Maryland last |
spring.
Marchie isn't saying just what he
and Mr. Miracle Man will talk about,
but the long odds are on the idea
that they will spend more than a few
minutes on plans for the Indian foot
ball team. At any rate, Schwartz had
his arms full of play diagrams when
he left the "coaches room" in the
B.A.C. building yesterdav.
T FORMATION RETAINED
On or about Sept. 4 Schwartz plans
to return and immediately go into
deep sessions with his coaching staff.
Harry Shipkey, Vic Lindskog, and
Husky Hunt, in order to have things
fully organized when the gridders
return for the pre-season workouts.
Stanford's football team will look
essentially the same this fall as it
has during the Shaughnessy regime
as far as style of play is concerned,
according to Schwartz, who poo
poos the rumors that the Indians
will have to shift from the "T" for
mation because of the loss of backs
Frank Albert, Pete Kmetovic, A1
Cole, and, more recently, Jim Pettit. ]
The Hammett question mark is, of j
course, giving the Card coach no end j
of worry, for, as he puts it:
QUARTERBACK WANTED
"Just somebody please tell me !
what I'm going to use for a quar
terback if Hammett is drafted?" All
the other quarterback candidates are
inexperienced, most of them sopho
mores. Hammett is currently en
gaged in a game of tag with the
Army, since he has not yet been ac
cepted in the Enlisted Reserve, fol
lowing his application last week.
In a coaches opinion poll as to the
respective merits of the teams in the
P.C.C. last week. Stanford was rated
fifth, a ranking with which Schwartz
agrees.
But even he cannot reconcile this
ranking with the strength of Stan
ford's potential first-string line this
fall. Boys like Chuck Taylor, Ed
Stamm. Bruno Banducci. and Loren
LaPrade just aren't a dime a dozen.
INEXPERIENCED BACKS
"But we haven't the experienced
backs," Schwartz says, "and they've
the boys who score the touch
downs."
Quarterbacks, aside from Ham
mett, look now to be: Neele John
ston. Bob Andrews, and Mark Caf
fail. With loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
With the loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
and possibly of Eric Armstrong
through scholastic ineligibility, hard
running Willard Sheller appears to
bo the only experienced halfback.
Pettit wasn't experienced, having
played only freshman ball at Stan
ford, but he was being counted upon
to take the speed burden left by
Kmetovic's graduation. AI Hoisch, a
tiny speed-burner from Los An-

geles, looked good in spring prac-
I ice but. he, too, lacks experience.
From last year's frosli club Don
Zappettini, Clem Woods, and Ross
Dana will vie for halfback posts.
Until he finds out definitely whether
or not Armstrong will return,
Schwartz isn't deciding what boys
will play what halfback.

The first-string fullback position
seems to be pretty well taken care
of by Buck Fawcett, another fast
runner, with Dave Pate and Bob
Frisbee in reserve. Frisbee, a junior
transfer, looked especially hot in the
final spring practice drill.

When Kelly Ross joined the serv
ice it became almost definite that
LaPrade would stay in the guard
spot he handled last year, leaving the
center chore to Milt Vucinich, last
vear's fullback.

Zappettini, Clem Woods, and Ross
Dana will vie for halfback posts.
Until he finds out definitely whether
or not Armstrong will return,
Schwartz isn't deciding what boys
will play what halfback.

The first-string fullback position
seems to be pretty well taken care
of by Buck Fawcett, another fast
runner, with Dave Pate and Bob
Frisbee in reserve. Frisbee, a junior
transfer, looked especially hot in the
final spring practice drill.

When Kelly Ross joined the serv
ice it became almost definite that
LaPrade would stay in the guard
spot he handled last year, leaving the
center chore to Milt Vucinich, last
vear's fullback.
"Is Ray Hammett going to be here
to play quarterback? Is there going
to be real interest in football on the
Coast this year?"
Those questions and many others
like them were buzzing around in
the head of Marchie Schwartz,
Stanford's head football coach since
late June, as he hurried here and
there in preparation for his 4 p.m.
departure yesterday for the East.
"I've come to the conclusion that
there is absolutely no use trying to
figure out who is going to play for
Stanford this fall," he declared. "I'm
just going to wait until the first day
of practice, September 9. then go out
on the practice field and see who is
here and who isn't."
TO SEE CLARK
Schwartz will take his family to
Omaha, Neb., and after a short visit,
will travel on to Chicago, where he
will witness the College All Star-
Chicago Bear game and where he
will confer with Clark D. Shaugh- j
nessy, Stanford's Cinderella mentor I
until he switched to Maryland last |
spring.
Marchie isn't saying just what he
and Mr. Miracle Man will talk about,
but the long odds are on the idea
that they will spend more than a few
minutes on plans for the Indian foot
ball team. At any rate, Schwartz had
his arms full of play diagrams when
he left the "coaches room" in the
B.A.C. building yesterdav.
T FORMATION RETAINED
On or about Sept. 4 Schwartz plans
to return and immediately go into
deep sessions with his coaching staff.
Harry Shipkey, Vic Lindskog, and
Husky Hunt, in order to have things
fully organized when the gridders
return for the pre-season workouts.
Stanford's football team will look
essentially the same this fall as it
has during the Shaughnessy regime
as far as style of play is concerned,
according to Schwartz, who poo
poos the rumors that the Indians
will have to shift from the "T" for
mation because of the loss of backs
Frank Albert, Pete Kmetovic, A1
Cole, and, more recently, Jim Pettit. ]
The Hammett question mark is, of j
course, giving the Card coach no end j
of worry, for, as he puts it:
QUARTERBACK WANTED

what I'm going to use for a quar
terback if Hammett is drafted?" All
the other quarterback candidates are
inexperienced, most of them sopho
mores. Hammett is currently en
gaged in a game of tag with the
Army, since he has not yet been ac
cepted in the Enlisted Reserve, fol
lowing his application last week.
In a coaches opinion poll as to the
respective merits of the teams in the
P.C.C. last week. Stanford was rated
fifth, a ranking with which Schwartz
agrees.
But even he cannot reconcile this
ranking with the strength of Stan
ford's potential first-string line this
fall. Boys like Chuck Taylor, Ed
Stamm. Bruno Banducci. and Loren
LaPrade just aren't a dime a dozen.
INEXPERIENCED BACKS
"But we haven't the experienced
backs," Schwartz says, "and they've
the boys who score the touch
downs."
Quarterbacks, aside from Ham
mett, look now to be: Neele John
ston. Bob Andrews, and Mark Caf
fail. With loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
With the loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
and possibly of Eric Armstrong

to play quarterback? Is there going
to be real interest in football on the
Coast this year?"
Those questions and many others
like them were buzzing around in
the head of Marchie Schwartz,
Stanford's head football coach since
late June, as he hurried here and
there in preparation for his 4 p.m.
departure yesterday for the East.
"I've come to the conclusion that
there is absolutely no use trying to
figure out who is going to play for
Stanford this fall," he declared. "I'm
just going to wait until the first day
of practice, September 9. then go out
on the practice field and see who is
here and who isn't."
TO SEE CLARK
Schwartz will take his family to
Omaha, Neb., and after a short visit,
will travel on to Chicago, where he
will witness the College All Star-
Chicago Bear game and where he
will confer with Clark D. Shaugh- j
nessy, Stanford's Cinderella mentor I
until he switched to Maryland last |
spring.
Marchie isn't saying just what he
and Mr. Miracle Man will talk about,
but the long odds are on the idea
that they will spend more than a few
minutes on plans for the Indian foot
ball team. At any rate, Schwartz had
his arms full of play diagrams when
he left the "coaches room" in the
B.A.C. building yesterdav.
T FORMATION RETAINED
On or about Sept. 4 Schwartz plans
to return and immediately go into
deep sessions with his coaching staff.
Harry Shipkey, Vic Lindskog, and
Husky Hunt, in order to have things
fully organized when the gridders
return for the pre-season workouts.
Stanford's football team will look
essentially the same this fall as it
has during the Shaughnessy regime
as far as style of play is concerned,
according to Schwartz, who poo
poos the rumors that the Indians
will have to shift from the "T" for
mation because of the loss of backs
Frank Albert, Pete Kmetovic, A1
Cole, and, more recently, Jim Pettit. ]
The Hammett question mark is, of j
course, giving the Card coach no end j
of worry, for, as he puts it:
QUARTERBACK WANTED
"Just somebody please tell me !
what I'm going to use for a quar
terback if Hammett is drafted?" All
the other quarterback candidates are
inexperienced, most of them sopho
mores. Hammett is currently en
gaged in a game of tag with the
Army, since he has not yet been ac
cepted in the Enlisted Reserve, fol
lowing his application last week.
In a coaches opinion poll as to the
respective merits of the teams in the
P.C.C. last week. Stanford was rated
fifth, a ranking with which Schwartz
agrees.
But even he cannot reconcile this
ranking with the strength of Stan
ford's potential first-string line this
fall. Boys like Chuck Taylor, Ed
Stamm. Bruno Banducci. and Loren
LaPrade just aren't a dime a dozen.
INEXPERIENCED BACKS
"But we haven't the experienced
backs," Schwartz says, "and they've
the boys who score the touch
downs."
Quarterbacks, aside from Ham
mett, look now to be: Neele John
ston. Bob Andrews, and Mark Caf
fail. With loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
With the loss of Pettit to Annapolis,
and possibly of Eric Armstrong
through scholastic ineligibility, hard
running Willard Sheller appears to
bo the only experienced halfback.
Pettit wasn't experienced, having
played only freshman ball at Stan
ford, but he was being counted upon
to take the speed burden left by
Kmetovic's graduation. AI Hoisch, a
tiny speed-burner from Los An-

geles, looked good in spring prac-
I ice but. he, too, lacks experience.
From last year's frosli club Don
Zappettini, Clem Woods, and Ross
Dana will vie for halfback posts.
Until he finds out definitely whether
or not Armstrong will return,
Schwartz isn't deciding what boys
will play what halfback.

The first-string fullback position
seems to be pretty well taken care
of by Buck Fawcett, another fast
runner, with Dave Pate and Bob
Frisbee in reserve. Frisbee, a junior
transfer, looked especially hot in the
final spring practice drill.

When Kelly Ross joined the serv
ice it became almost definite that
LaPrade would stay in the guard
spot he handled last year, leaving the
center chore to Milt Vucinich, last
vear's fullback.
