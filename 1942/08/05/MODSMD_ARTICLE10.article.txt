## HOW WILL THE WAR AFFECT FOOTBALL? 
### BOB SONTAG 
Introducing Hay Hammett, quarterback, who gives his impression
of the coming football season. Take it, Kay, while we take time
off.—Editor's Note)

There has been the question in the minds of sports fans as to how
present world conditions will affect football in the United States this year:
whether the public will take interest in this year's games; whether the
game itself will remain one of HIE sports of America, a position which it
has held during the past 20 years; and whether the players themselves will
have the old enthusiasm and spirit to give everything they have for their
alma maters.
Our own head coach, Marchie Schwartz, has taken a natural interest in
these questions and during his summer work at defense plants has asked
a good number of such questions to numerous working men. The response
in almost every instance has been, "I'll say I am going to every game I can,"
Many of the workers who could not afford games in previous years can
now go to them. Also such games will definitely afford great relaxation to
the thousands of workers who have been putting out day and night the
necessary munitions, ships, and other war materials.

A few weeks ago, (he status of football as we have known it here
on the coast was threatened by possible extinction. But after General
DeWitt's "go" signal, and especially after the Armed Services of the
U.S. have accepted football as their Number One sport, it seems that
football has attained a higher and more important position than ever
before.
When the Army and the Navy have planned on football schedules for
those serving in their camps and pre-flight schools; and, even more, when
high officials have guaranteed players in the services who have been
elected for the All-Star game to be played this month at least two or three
weeks leave to participate, we can assume that, barring unforeseen changes,
we will be out there in the stadium along about September cheering an
other Red Machine on to victory.
As for the players' attitude toward football this year: perhaps noth
ing more need be said than to point out that any athlete under any condi
tions gives his "all" to win in any game.

Any decrease in crowds or support from outsiders will not cut any
of the spirit the boys will show when the whistle blows for the kick
off. The only "dig" that may develop will be a possible antagonism by
these in the service, or those who have sons in the service, toward the
players as "not doing their part in the war effort."
This has resulted in a step by the B.A.C. to publish in the football pro
grams the military status of every player. Since nearly every player old
enough to register in the draft is in some Army or Naval Reserve program,
what better way could they "do their part" than to prepare themselves
physically and mentally than by staying in college, receiving their degrees,
and entering into the various fields of leadership. And leadership is cer
tainly one thing this country will need in the years to come.
Speaking of leaders, the bay-area sports writers seem to have our neigh
bors from Barklay (or is it Burply) as the ones to beat this coming
geason.
The old "T" is slyly sitting in fifth place. Well. I can remember in
about 1 !)40 when the old T" was sloppily drooping in eighth place, not
expected to win a single game. History has a way of repeating itself,
as we know it will when our ultimate and final victory shall again
restore our American way of life, liberty and freedoms.

Introducing Hay Hammett, quarterback, who gives his impression
of the coming football season. Take it, Kay, while we take time

There has been the question in the minds of sports fans as to how
present world conditions will affect football in the United States this year:
whether the public will take interest in this year's games; whether the
game itself will remain one of HIE sports of America, a position which it
has held during the past 20 years; and whether the players themselves will
have the old enthusiasm and spirit to give everything they have for their
alma maters.
Our own head coach, Marchie Schwartz, has taken a natural interest in
these questions and during his summer work at defense plants has asked
a good number of such questions to numerous working men. The response
in almost every instance has been, "I'll say I am going to every game I can,"
Many of the workers who could not afford games in previous years can
now go to them. Also such games will definitely afford great relaxation to
the thousands of workers who have been putting out day and night the
necessary munitions, ships, and other war materials.

A few weeks ago, (he status of football as we have known it here
on the coast was threatened by possible extinction. But after General
DeWitt's "go" signal, and especially after the Armed Services of the
U.S. have accepted football as their Number One sport, it seems that
football has attained a higher and more important position than ever
before.
When the Army and the Navy have planned on football schedules for
those serving in their camps and pre-flight schools; and, even more, when
high officials have guaranteed players in the services who have been
elected for the All-Star game to be played this month at least two or three
weeks leave to participate, we can assume that, barring unforeseen changes,
we will be out there in the stadium along about September cheering an
other Red Machine on to victory.
As for the players' attitude toward football this year: perhaps noth
ing more need be said than to point out that any athlete under any condi
tions gives his "all" to win in any game.

Any decrease in crowds or support from outsiders will not cut any
of the spirit the boys will show when the whistle blows for the kick
off. The only "dig" that may develop will be a possible antagonism by
these in the service, or those who have sons in the service, toward the
players as "not doing their part in the war effort."
This has resulted in a step by the B.A.C. to publish in the football pro
grams the military status of every player. Since nearly every player old
enough to register in the draft is in some Army or Naval Reserve program,
what better way could they "do their part" than to prepare themselves
physically and mentally than by staying in college, receiving their degrees,
and entering into the various fields of leadership. And leadership is cer
