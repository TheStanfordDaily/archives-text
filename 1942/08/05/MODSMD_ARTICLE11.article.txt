With the elimination of two of
the four seeded teams, the faculty
student doubles handball tournament
under the direction of Woody Weir
went into the semifinals this week.
Pairings for the semifinals are:
Rabbett and Burton vs. McCaughn
and Gensen; Mac Donald and Jones
vs. Mitchell and White.
Although Rabbett and Burton are
seeded first, Mitchell and White,
both of the faculty, have been prac
ticing every noon hour, and have
been sweeping aside their opponents
with ease.
Results of the quarter-finals,
played off last week were:
Rabbett and Burton def. Pollard
and Hooper, 21-19. 21-15; McCaughn
and Gensen def. Voss and Eikelman,
21-12. 21-G; Mac Donald and Jones
def. timson and Wheeler in three
games; Mitchell and White def. Fos
ter and Read in three games.

Abnormal tire wear and faulty
steering are the results of bad wheel
alignment, according to Louis P.
Signer, manager of the Emergency
Road Service.
