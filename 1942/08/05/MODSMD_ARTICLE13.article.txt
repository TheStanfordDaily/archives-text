on Thursday.
Sergeant Whizzer Kopitzke took the mound yesterday in place of Ellis

Alpha Sig-Thota Chi combine to win
easily, 10-4. Harry Booth, the one
man team, pitched excellent ball for
the losers, but once again poor field
ing kept him in the hole.

two men on to put the Army into an
early lead. Private Savage was the
leading hitter with two for three.
ZETES STAY IN RACE

Zetes, as he led them to an 8-6 vic

Bromfield's timely triple with two on
put them into the lead in a very
closely contested game. He also col
lected two doubles and knocked in
four runs to lead his team at the
plate.
Scott Dudley pitched for the Zetes,
and got excellent support from his
infield of Dick Northon, Ed Stamm,
and Jack Steiny. Bob Leaver was
touched for six runs in the first
inning, but despite the fine fielding
of Bill Davis and Monte Pfyl. they
were unable to get into the lead.
Encina 11-I II took the Spar Ducks,
7-4, mainly on the hitting of Don
Lemmon, Frank Wigmore, and the
pitching of Barrett Weber. It was
the eighth consecutive win for the
frosh.
BUNN'S lIIT TIMELY
John Bunn's double in the seventh
with the bases loaded sparked the
Slave Drivers to a 7-2 win over the
Alpha Dclts. Cliff Wells allowed but
six hits, and was having a close duel
with Bud Woodward until the sev
enth when three walks, an error,
and hits by Bunn and Clark netted
the faculty men six runs.

Keith Laizure's two clutch hits
aided the pitching of Frank Tibbetts
as the Fijjs took the Cutters, 8-5.
Despite the work of Harry Parsons
and Bill Cunha in the infield, the
medics couldn't hit when men were
on base.
In the consolation round, the erst
while dormant Pied Typers explod
ed, trouncing the Upper Row, 23-3,
in the biggest rout of the day.
Pitcher Jim Pollard had at least one
strike-out per inning, while his
mates, led by Harris Robison, gave
him good fielding and hitting sup

port. RobiSon, playing his first game
for the Typers, clouted a home run
in the second inning to lead the
journalists' attack. Chuck Taylor
looked good for the Upper Row.
