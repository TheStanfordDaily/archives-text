H. S. Ede, former director of the
British Museum of National Art,
speaking to a Tuesday Evening Series
audience last night, pointed out that
the "artist is a window through
which we can gaze at beauty." In
commenting on the pictures hung in
the National Gallery of Art in Wash
ington. Mr. Ede went further to say
that "if the artist is sincere we ac
cept his work as simply as we accept
the unrealities of a bad dream."
The National Art Gallery was a
gift of the late Andrew Mellon and
when opened included 500 pictures
and 44 sculptures including the
work of the world's most famous
artists. Some of the first art works
were the gift of Samuel Kress.
Speaking of the nationalist tend
encies in art, Mr. Ede said that "in
Italy the greatest activity in painting
and art has occurred."
"The Washington Art Gallery is
probably the only gallery in the
world to be equipped with baby car
riages," Mr. Ede said, in describing
some of the features of the institu
tion. "The galleries are air-condi
tioned. first-aid stations are strate
gically placed, and the walls of the
galleries are tinted to provide the
proper background for the pictures
being hung there," Mr. Ede said.
Mr. Ede also remarked that al
though the gallery is constructed of
pink marble, the color is only visible
when rain occurs; if the rain is hard
enough, the building becomes deep
red.
