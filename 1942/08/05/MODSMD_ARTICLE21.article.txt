# For Whom the Bell Tolls

THERE he was out on the top
deck trying to get some
sleep. Then it happened.
Twelve times the clock struck.
He turned over and passed it off
as a trick of his imagination. But
15 minutes later the clock
struck the quarter hour, and
that went on and on and on.
Then he dozed off to sleep
only to hear the quarter hour
strike again. That completely
upset him, for it was getting late,
but he still couldn't get to sleep.
So he decided to wait for 45
minutes to see how long he had
to sleep until time to get up. But
ne dozed off again just before
the hour was supposed to strike.
That went on all night, and
:here was nothing he could do.
Yelling or shoe throwing could
n't help; so he gave up, a bun
dle of nerves with a total of 40
minutes' sleep.
There's nothing wrong with
the chimes ringing all night.
Somebody undoubtedly forgot
io turn them off. But it dem
onstrates how one gets used to
certain noises at night and has
to make adjustments before he
ran get back to normal again.
