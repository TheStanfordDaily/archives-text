TT'S FUNNY how more Stan-
L ford women contribute to the
Dimes for Diplomas drive than
do the men. Can the women be
more interested in having the
men come back to school than

The Dimes drive is one of the
most worthy causes we have at
Stanford, but it seems that the
men and women of Stanford are
burdened with too many other
drives for money. The Dimes
coffer will be richer at the end
of the quarter, however, because
the proceeds from next Friday's
dance and the money from the
last Sunday Night Movie of the
quarter will go toward the
Dimes' fund.
