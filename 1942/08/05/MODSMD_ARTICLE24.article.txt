### BILL STEIF 
January 1 over 400 of our
ships have been sunk in the At
lantic. Furthermore, there has been
no let-up in this tremendous toll.
The figures for each month indicate,
instead, that the result of U-boat
warfare has become increasingly ef
fective. The number of ships which
we can expect to lose to the Axis
has not even been stabilized. And
yet as late as three weeks ago Sec
retary of the Navy Frank Knox was
assuring us that something definitely
was being done to combat the sub
marine menace, that the United Na
tions would thereafter lose fewer and
fewer ships to Nazi U-boats, that we
could expect more and more of our
supplies to get to their destinations.
Now I have the greatest respect
for Colonel Knox. In those days
in which we were not at war. days
which seem a millenium away to
day, I believed that his was the
correct attitude concerning the
European situation. He was what
another colonel, Robert McCor
mick, called a "war-monger," hut
nevertheless, I thought that Knox
was right in believing that Nazi
Germany was a menace to the
American concept of liberty.
But today a little doubt is creep
ing into my mind. To what was the
good colonel referring when he
made his rather fatuous statement
about a decrease in U-boat sinkings
several weeks ago. The facts are all
against the man. We are losing boats
by the hatful—and nobody seems to
be doing anything about it, mainly, I
guess, because, try as the Navy will,
there is nothing much they can do
about the situation.

WHICH point Mr. Henry Kai
ser enters. Mr. Kaiser also sees
that nobody is doing very much
about the U-boats. Therefore, as a
practical man-of-affairs he sits down
to see what he can cook up: and he
cooks something up, something
which is hot and new and nice and,
it appears, may be the answer to the
problem. The point is that wo have
ships on the seas to try to get sup
plies that will help win the war to
the places where our generals think
there is a pretty good chance of
whipping the enemy.
The place where supplies are going
to have to go the quickest and the
most is to England, because it is ob
vious that we and the English are
going to have to get ofT our duffs and
open a Second Front if we are to
win the war. But the submarines
prevent supplies from getting across.
So Mr. Kaiser says let's fly 'em
across in big flying boats. He has
the plans all drafted, everything all
set to go. He estimates that he can
build 5.000 flying boats in a year and
he estimates that in one day 5.000
flying boats can fly 500,000 men to
England and the next day fly 700.000
pounds of bread, butter, and bombs
to that unhappy island. And it is
well to remember that Mr. Kaiser
has never gone back on that type of
promise yet.

JT LOOKS like wo are not going
to get that Second Front this
summer. There are too many tech
nicalities such as transportation to
England that have yet to be ironed
out. Therefore, by the time the
next summer rolls around Mr.
Kaiser would very likely be pre
pared to deliver several thousand
flying ships and thus iron out many
of those technicalities.
But Mr. Kaiser has gone to
Washington. He is apparently being
swallowed in the bureaucratic maze
along the Potomac. The good Colonel
Knox has added to the confusion of
Mr. Kaiser by saying neither yes nor
no. Everyone else from the bellboy
at the Mayflower up has added his
voice to the controversy. And so
time, a great enemy, steals on. and
in Washington it looks like faith in
American daring and originality and
enterprise Is dyinj.

day, I believed that his was the
correct attitude concerning the
European situation. He was what
another colonel, Robert McCor
mick, called a "war-monger," hut
nevertheless, I thought that Knox
was right in believing that Nazi
Germany was a menace to the
American concept of liberty.
But today a little doubt is creep
ing into my mind. To what was the
good colonel referring when he
made his rather fatuous statement
about a decrease in U-boat sinkings
several weeks ago. The facts are all
against the man. We are losing boats
by the hatful—and nobody seems to
be doing anything about it, mainly, I
guess, because, try as the Navy will,
there is nothing much they can do
about the situation.

WHICH point Mr. Henry Kai
ser enters. Mr. Kaiser also sees
that nobody is doing very much
about the U-boats. Therefore, as a
practical man-of-affairs he sits down
to see what he can cook up: and he
cooks something up, something
which is hot and new and nice and,
it appears, may be the answer to the
problem. The point is that wo have
ships on the seas to try to get sup
plies that will help win the war to
the places where our generals think
there is a pretty good chance of
whipping the enemy.
The place where supplies are going
to have to go the quickest and the
most is to England, because it is ob
vious that we and the English are
going to have to get ofT our duffs and
open a Second Front if we are to
win the war. But the submarines
prevent supplies from getting across.
So Mr. Kaiser says let's fly 'em
across in big flying boats. He has
the plans all drafted, everything all
set to go. He estimates that he can
build 5.000 flying boats in a year and
he estimates that in one day 5.000
flying boats can fly 500,000 men to
England and the next day fly 700.000
pounds of bread, butter, and bombs
to that unhappy island. And it is
well to remember that Mr. Kaiser
has never gone back on that type of
promise yet.

JT LOOKS like wo are not going
to get that Second Front this
summer. There are too many tech
nicalities such as transportation to
England that have yet to be ironed
out. Therefore, by the time the
next summer rolls around Mr.
Kaiser would very likely be pre
pared to deliver several thousand
flying ships and thus iron out many
of those technicalities.
But Mr. Kaiser has gone to
Washington. He is apparently being
swallowed in the bureaucratic maze
along the Potomac. The good Colonel
Knox has added to the confusion of
Mr. Kaiser by saying neither yes nor
no. Everyone else from the bellboy
at the Mayflower up has added his
voice to the controversy. And so
time, a great enemy, steals on. and
in Washington it looks like faith in
American daring and originality and
enterprise Is dyinj.
January 1 over 400 of our
ships have been sunk in the At
lantic. Furthermore, there has been
no let-up in this tremendous toll.
The figures for each month indicate,
instead, that the result of U-boat
warfare has become increasingly ef
fective. The number of ships which
we can expect to lose to the Axis
has not even been stabilized. And
yet as late as three weeks ago Sec
retary of the Navy Frank Knox was
assuring us that something definitely
was being done to combat the sub
marine menace, that the United Na
tions would thereafter lose fewer and
fewer ships to Nazi U-boats, that we
could expect more and more of our
supplies to get to their destinations.
Now I have the greatest respect
for Colonel Knox. In those days
in which we were not at war. days
which seem a millenium away to
day, I believed that his was the
correct attitude concerning the
European situation. He was what
another colonel, Robert McCor

nevertheless, I thought that Knox
