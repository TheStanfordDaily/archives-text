# Mascot Runs Out on Cal

### 
Internal strife is simmering on the
Berkeley campus. Petty thievery is
stirring, for yesterday it was an
nounced that the mahogany bear
which normally sits on the Fiji living
room table had gone AWOL.

Fraternity circles were thrown into
confusion when Glenn Wollman,
Fiji house manager, declared that
freshmen were to canvass suspected
neighboring houses in search for the
wooden mascot. Last year the wan
derlust bear was found in possession
of a rival fraternity.

In the midst of the furor, the Fijis
set the value of their carved bear at
$50, and felt pretty unhappy about
the whole thing.
