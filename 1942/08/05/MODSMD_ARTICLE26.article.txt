# Chilean Play Ends Dramatic Festival
## 
### 
Although most of the activities of
the 1942 Dramatists' Alliance Festival
Program have taken place, the pro
gram will not officially end until the
presentation of "Aguas Abajo" on
August 7.
The play, written by the modern
Chilean author Gloria Moreno, has
been translated for the occasion by
Wilber E. Bailey of the Stanford
University Press. It will be given
as a formal group reading in the
auditorium of the Women's Club
house at 8 p.m. Admission is 28
cents.
