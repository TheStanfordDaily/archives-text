### 
Since its introduction nine years
ago, iodobismitol, with the aid of
sobisminol, which was developed just

syphilis. lodobismitol is injected in
tramuscularly, and sobisminol is
taken by mouth. These facts were
reported yesterday by Dr. P. J.
Hanzlik, head of thfe Stanford de
partment of pharmacology.
"As a result of the discovery of
these two agents, following a study
of 13 years, Stanford University has
directly contributed tangible bene
fits to human society, and there is
reason to believe that similar bene
fits from the same source will con
tinue," Dr. Hanzlik added.
