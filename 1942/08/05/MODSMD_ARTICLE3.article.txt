Declaring that the Co-operative
Book Exchange needs reorganization
or abolition. A.S.S.U. President Ed
Stamm asked Excom last night to
investigate the exchange. Excom
Member Bob Hammett was appointed
to conduct an investigation into the
Book Exchange and report his find
ings to Excom in two weeks.
Stamm pointed out that the Ex
change had a poor volume of busi
ness and no facilities to handle any
adequate amount of business. He
suggested that Hammett write the
University of Washington for sug
gestions about reorganization of the
exchange.
