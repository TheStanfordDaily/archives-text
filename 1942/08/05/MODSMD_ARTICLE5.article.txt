# Encina Receives First Major Facelifting in Fifty Years
## 
### J. T. WATERHOUSE 
Eiuina. the dormitory that has served Stanford students for the past
50 years, is today undergoing its first extensive alteration. Improvements
costing $30,000 will convert the majority of the rooms on the third and
fourth floors of the east wing into highly desirable and modern living

quarters.
Each of the rooms has been en
tirely "rebuilt," according to Stan
ley L. Sharp, director of men's resi
dences. Among the improvements
are the built-in wardrobe closets
which divide the rooms into two sec
tions, a sleeping room and a study
room.
NEW FURNISHINGS
Included in the new furnishings
will be office-type desks, straight
chairs, beds and mattresses. Soft
wood floors have been replaced by
hardwood; sturdy but impractical
marble wash-stands have been re
placed by modern basins.
Perhaps the most impressive thing
to Encina alumni who return to
view the new rooms will be the ab
sence of the naked light globe hang
ing from the middle of the ceiling.
This scourge of Encinamen has been
replaced by a central lighting fixture,
with floor outlets placed strategically
around the baseboards.
CLI BROOM REMODELED
Improvements have not been con
fined to the individual rooms, how
ever. The clubroom has also had a
face-lifting. Changes here include
new fluorescent lighting fixtures, the
addition of new "Charles of London"
type chairs, the reupholstering of all
the old sofas, ash trays, a new tro
phy case, and an entirely new paint
job. The scars on the floor, left by
countless generations of cigarette
butts, have been removed and the
floor revarnished.
Although completion date is not
yet definite it is expected that the
rooms will be finished before the
end of the quarter. Open house will
be held at this time, along with the
dedication of the clubroom.
