# Army Enlisted Reserve Re-opened
## Stanford Given Quota of 2108 For Reserves Navy's V-Programs Permit Graduation Prior to Induction 
### AL HEDDEN 
Enlistments in the Army Reserve
are again being accepted at Army
enlistment stations, it was announced
yesterday in Salt Lake City by Col
onel John W. Crissy, commandant of
the Ninth Corps Area. The an
nouncement, received by Colonel
Harry It. Allen, commander of Stan
ford's 1t.0.T.C. unit, follows a tem
porary suspension of the enlistment,
during which additional plans were
incorporated in the program.
The age requirement for the Re
serve is now set at 18 to 46. as of the
date of graduation. Good standing in
the University and good health are
the other requirements for enlist
ment.
TWO WAYS TO ENLIST
"There are two ways of enlisting,"
Dean John Bunn announced. "Stu-Â«
dents may apply at the Army Pro
curement Office in Redwood City, in
which event they will be given free
transportation to the enlistment sta
tion in San Francisco, or, if imme
diate enlistment is desired, they may
go directly to the San Francisco of
fice, located in Rooms 311 and 312
of the Tower Building, 703 Market
Street."
The Army has given Stanford a
maximum quota of 1104 men, as com
pared to a maximum of 1004 men
eligible for the Navy's V-programs.
This comparatively large total of 2103
leaves plenty of opportunity for late
enlistment by those who want to
wait and see what the draft board
is going to do.
SPECIAL TRAINING
Following graduation and induc
tion, the reservist will undergo the
regular 13-week basic training pro
gram of the draftee. He is then give ti
officer's training in the special field
to which he may be assigned, in
cluding aviation, radio, engineering,
navigation, and meteorology.
In the Navy set-up, freshmen and
sophomores are eligible for the V-l
class, and juniors and seniors may
enlist in either the V-5 or V-7 class.
