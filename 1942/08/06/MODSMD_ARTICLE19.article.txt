Medical research has long known
that the virus causing infantile
paralysis is extremely resistant and
stubborn to destroy, but Dr. Edwin
W. Schultz of Stanford University
has completed a series of experi
ments to confirm this.
Subjecting the poliomyelitus virus
1 to a diet of dilute solutions of 122
potent chemicals, including the pow
erful sulpha compounds, the bacte
! riologist found that the dangerous
virus survived nearly 80 of the
chemical agents in the concentration
used.
"The resistance of the virus to
| chlorine is of especial interest in
connection with the frequent pres
ence of virus in stools and sewage,"
Dr. Schultz pointed out in his article
on the experiment in the current is
sue of the Journal of Infectious
Diseases.
Of importance was the fact that
the virus was susceptible to fairly
high dilutions of 33 of the chemicals,
including oxidizing agents, Dr.
Schultz also reported. Because these
seemed to inactivate the virus, the
chemicals are to be studied further
to ascertain if higher dilutions can
be successfully used as preventatives
| and in therapeutic treatment.
In the Stanford experiment, the
initial concentration of the chem
icals represented a thousandth of
their molecular weight in order to
determine the relative molecular ef
fectiveness of the individual agents
tested.
