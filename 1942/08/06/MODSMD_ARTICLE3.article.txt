# School to Have New Tile Roof
## 
### 
The new School of Humanities
will soon have a new tile roof, J. J.
McDonald, superintendent of build
ings and grounds, announced today.

The new roof, to be made of a
higher grade of tile, will replace the
present weather-beaten roof, which
leaks badly. The roofing job will be
completed by the opening of Fall
Quarter.
Also to be completed by the be
ginning of next quarter is the
much commented upon construction
on Lasuen, in front of the main
library. According to McDonald, the
new lawn should be in and up by
the end of Summer Quarter, while
the planting of shrubbery and the
repaving of the roadway will be
completed during the vacation,
''The amount of construction work
done on the campus will decrease
greatly from now on, due to the
war," McDonald explained. "I've
lost two of my best men to aircraft
industries already."
