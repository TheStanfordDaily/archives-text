'piIE EDITOR. SIR:
Some votaries of the Foul Fiend
nave arisen from the Murky Depths
and decided that I make a good "fall
guy" for publicity angles.
Last week I was sneezing on the
front page of the Dippy for good old
'Tartuffe." That wasn't so bad, as
nost people recognized it as pure
publicity hokum.
But this Tuesday in an article for
.heir dance on August 7. the Rally
Jom plunged me into some rather
torrid H2O. May I be permitted to
state:
1. That I have never made any
claims to professional rank on this or
,»ny other faculty.
2. That I am not the leader of the
.lancers who are to demonstrate. We
are members of the California Fed
eration of Folk Dancers. Lee Owens
is president of the local group. Ed
Carpenter is also a member of this
group and has charge of the dances
next Friday. I am merely the pub
licity manager for the Federation
Festival to be held in Paly on Aug.
16 (plug).
You may remember the slogan,
"Konko the Rally Committee." May
I suggest we proceed? But let's do
it with Dimes for Diplomas, and at
the same time have fun dancing next
Friday. Aug. 7.
