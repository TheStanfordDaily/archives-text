r JPHE DAILY CALIFORNIAN, jour
nalistic vehicle for that student
body from Berkeley who feel that
education, as a college avocation, is
being overstressed, reprints inter
esting things about Stanford.
This came to mind when I read in
Richard Donovan's Chronicle col
umn (brackets mine) that "the Brit
ish captured a talkative (sure)
young graduate of the University of
California . . . the other day.
"He was ... 'a cocky (not un
usual) and convinced Nazi' ... He
spoke perfect English (this seems
strange) ,and said . . . that after four
years study in Berkeley, he left for
his home in Germany (no one could
blame him) . . .
"He informed the British intelli
gence officers that the Nazis would
sweep over Iran, Iraq, Syria, Pales
tine, and Egypt (cf., annual Berke
ley Rose Bowl chatter)."
It is not my purpose to draw any
moral from the above, anyone at all
familiar with Berkeley can do that
for himself.
I do feel, however, that had this
young German attended Stanford, he
would have been easily convinced of
the superiority of the "American
way of life" and, far from rejoining
his Homeland, would have settled
here and probably even voted Re
publican.
