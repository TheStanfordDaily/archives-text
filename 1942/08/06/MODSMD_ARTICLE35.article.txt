# SALTY'S SPEECHLESS

### 
r |' , UESDAY there was no Salty Sez.
Yesterday someone else wrote it.
Last Monday Bob Sontag (Salty)
got his white Selective Service ques
tionaire. Get the picture?
Salty was in the last group (18-20)
to register. Now he has the ques
tionaire he wonders if the old folks
will vote one day in November and
the youngsters get called to arms
the next day.
If you were in the last registra
tion. don't think that Uncle Sam
isn't interested in you. And it's not
so he can send you to Scout Camp,
either.

<•6/ I ARS," more than one student
are saying, "should be volun
tarily dispensed with here on the
Farm for the duration."
While never one to sit on the
fence, I will let this pass without
personal comment.
The idea seems to be that by
means of a vote, poll, or survey
among car owners, some student
group such as (you guessed it)
Cardinals, might determine the stu
dents' willingness or unwillingness
to give up and forbid the use of
automobiles among students.
It so happens that the fellow who
suggested this plan to me is not an
embittered pedestrian. In fact, he
runs a car and has no more trouble
than the next guy in getting better
than average dates.
He feels that not only would it be
of real value to the war. but that it
would be one more thing to show
the people that Stanford is not only
conscious of its place in the struggle,
but a leader in that struggle.
Think it over this vacation. Maybe
next quarter it will be determined
just how the students feel about it
and action taken or the matter
dropped.
