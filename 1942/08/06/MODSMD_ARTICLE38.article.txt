"DU PONT. ONE HUNDRED AND
FORTY YEARS," by William S.
Dutton. Scribners. $:>. !»96 pages.
Both the growth of big business
and the growth of the United States
are reflected in the pages of this in
dustrial biography of the DuPont
corporation. As the author himself
states, "this is a story of men and
goods, of peace and war, of vision
and venture. It is the biography
of tens of thousands whose efforts
and identities are merged in the rec
ord and character of a company
unique in American industrial his
tory."
The book can be generally divided
into two main sections—lBoo-1900.
one hundred years of DuPont ex
plosives, and 1900-1940, forty years
of synthetics. From a minor gun
powder plant established in 1802 by
founder Eleuthere Irenee du Pont de
Nemours, French emigre, the author
traces the company through years of
growth until it became the foremost
explosive manufacturer in the
United States: and now its synthetic
products greatly affect the life of
the nation.
Of course one cannot paint a biog
raphy of the Du Pont corporation
without to some extent painting the
biography of the Du Pont family.
Dutton, however, limits, as much as
possible, mention of the family ex
cept where it is directly related to
the company.
More than a scholarly study, the
book's readable prose, clear treat
ment, and large type are features
which make it highly commendable.
