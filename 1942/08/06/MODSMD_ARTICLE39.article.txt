# Tony Martin 'Recalls' Reverses Testimony
## 
### 
Radio Singer Tony Martin startled
the court-martial trial of Lt. Comdr.
Maurice N. Aroff yesterday by re
versing his previous testimony about
the car he gave Aroff. Last Monday,
Martin testified that he had given the
car to Aroff, and later had been
asked by Aroff to tell intelligence
officers the car had been paid for by
Aroff. Yesterday, Martin on the wit
ness stand for the defense, "recalled"
that Aroff had offered to pay him for
the car.
