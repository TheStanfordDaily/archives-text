### 
'"Differential and Integral Calcu
lus," a text attacking mathematics
problems from a modern point of
view, was published this June by
Harold M Bacon, assistant professor
of mathematics here.
The book, which Professor Bacon
has been working on for four years,
will be used as the text for begin
ning calculus courses next fall. Four
thousand practice exercises are in
corporated in the book which, ac
cording to the professor, gives fuller
explanations and more details than
most other texts on the same subject.
