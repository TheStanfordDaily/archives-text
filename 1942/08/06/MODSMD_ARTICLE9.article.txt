# Campus Begins Scrap Search
## 
### 
Stanford's Conservation Commit
tee is opening a new drive for the
collection of scrap metals on the
campus. Under the direction of Bill
Hutchinson, chairman of the com
mittee, collections will be made
every other Saturday. Hutchinson
urges all campus residents to again
scour their fraternities of dormitories
for scrap metals.

"There are lots of old metals
around the living groups that could
well be collected for scrap," said
Hutchinson. "It is estimated that
there are approximately 1,000
pounds of steel in each house and
possibly some of this metal has lost
its usefulness and would be an aid in
helping out the war effort as it can
all be remelted and used again."

The War Office in Washington has
announced some figures on scrap
metal conservation. Collections of
small metals, such as scissors, will
bring one-third a pound of steel. An
electric iron will give up six pounds
of steel: an umbrella one-half
pound; old springs from chairs five
pounds, and metal wastebaskets two
pounds. Steel springs from a mat
tress will yield 20 ponuds of metal,
enough to make several steel helmets
for soldiers.

Also needed for collection arc
rubber, rags, manila rope, burlap
and waste cooking fats.
