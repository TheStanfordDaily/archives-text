# Social Quarter Ends Aug. 16
## 
### 
Acting to escape the student body
ruling which prohibits social activity
during the seven days before finals,
Excom has announced plans for an
intensified recreational program to
be held between now and August 16.
Christening the two-week session
of fun will be tonight's hayseed
frolic, the barn dance sponsored by
Rally Com at 8:30. Although the
dance to celebrate the opening of
the redecorated Encina lobby has
been postponed, due to wet paint,
Toyon Hall will come to the rescue
with a dance Saturday night, high
lighted by the music of Bill Arsenio
and his orchestra, and the startling
lighting effects of Bill Levers, Em
inger Stewart, and Rene Ventner.
PLAY DAY AUGUST 15
Tennis tournaments, swimming
races, and all-around physical fun
will be featured at the play day,
scheduled for August 15 at the Wom
en's Gym. ASSU will bear the bur
den of incidental expenditures while
concessionaires will make donuts, ice
cream, and cokes available to hungry
participants.
Climax of the entire program will
come that same evening when the
Open-Air Dance, sponsored by Ver
nicc Hines and the Cardinals, will
be held in the Corp Yard. A plat
form for dancing couples will be
constructed, while record music will
be compensated for by a nearly full
moon,
CHINESE LANTERNS
Les Langnecker, ASSU vice-presi
dent, said that "the Corp Yard will
also string up Chinese lanterns, a
subtle reminder to _• to China,
Britain, and the 30 other war fronts."
Anti-climax of the two-weeks pe
riod of rest will be the final exami
nations, which now loom only three
weeks away, the first examination
being on August 27.
