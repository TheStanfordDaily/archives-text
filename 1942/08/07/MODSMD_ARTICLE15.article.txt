# Farmhands Set To Make Hay At Hop Tonight
## Gym Transformed Into Country Barn For Rally Com Dance 
### 
Farm cowhands and milkmaids, alt
slicked up in their best store-bought
duds, are all set to make hay tonight
in the Women's Gym at Rally Corn's
barn dance, with moonshine being
replaced by apple cider.
"The women's barn has been
changed into an old gym, complete
with wheels, buggies, and every
thing but Uncle Fud's prize Holstein,
and any danged furriners will be
shot on sight," Dad Jim Mc√ürier,
dance committee member, said,
shifting his well-chewed cud.
Tink (Ma'am) Downey, dance
chairman, also reported that "re
sults from the freshman girls' raid up
the Piow on Wednesday night were
quite good and a big crowd is ex
pected."
Good old-fashioned barn dances
will feature the early evening en
tertainment with the Farmhands
kicking up their heels to square
dances and Virginia reels. Farm
smooths will take over at 10 o'clock
when popular music will bring the
thing back to civilization.
"Furriner" guests at the dance will
include Dr. Max Savelle, Mr. and
Mrs. Rixford K. Snyder, and Pro
fessor and Mrs. Georges LeMaitre.
Admission is 25 cents, and shootin'
irons will be checked at the door.
