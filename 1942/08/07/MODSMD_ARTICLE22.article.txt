# Top Film Fare Shows in Paly

### 
'"KINGS ROW," now playing at
the Varsity.
With "Kings Row" back at the
Varsity, and "Mrs. Miniver" held
over at the Stanford, probably the
two top pictures of the year are
showing simultaneously in Palo Alto.
In "Kings Row" Robert Cummings
plays the role of his career; Betty
Field re-establishes herself among
the screen's foremost dramatic act
resses; and Ronald Reagan surpasses
all his past performances—to take no
account of Nancy Coleman, Claude
Rains, Charles Colburn, Ann Sheri
dan, and all the rest of a most re
markable cast.
Eric Korngold's score is rivalled
only by Vaughn Williams' for "The
Invaders" as the year's outstanding
film music. And only the direction
of Hitchcock himself could compare
with Sam Wood's handling of the
story, making it as gripping a drama
as has come to town these past
millenia.—Covey
