# Council to Revise Scrap Collections
## 
### 
Bill Hutchinson, chairman of the
Conservation Council, announces
that plans are being made for mass
collections of scrap metals, but as yet
the metal will still be collected in
the regular manner through the
junk men.
"Collections will be made every
other week," said Hutchinson. "We
hope that fraternities and other
dormitories will plan in advance for
the collections. We have not as yet
made plans for collections from other
campus residents but we urge them
to look around their homes for old
scrap metal."
The committee is planning to ini
tiate savings plans for foodstuffs on
the campus. The first of these series
was the fat-saving campaign. In the
future other foodstuffs such as cof
fee, milk and bread will be included
in the plan.
