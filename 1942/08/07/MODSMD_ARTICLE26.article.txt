## WHY DOESN'T EVERYBODY JUST WISE UP A LITTLE? 
### BOB SONTAG 
This football situation, as presented in the city papers, is just about
getting to the point where somebody oughta be wised up, and the quicker
the better.
For instance, yesterday's San Francisco News, Sports Editor Tom Laird
specifically, said:
''It seems io me thai Stanford took a schoolboy attitude in trans
ferring the Southern California game back to Palo Alto after Kezar
was all set. As I recall, the game was taken to Kezar at the suggestion
of the Army. Stanford seems a hit cocky."
Mr. Laird continues:
"The dimout regulations could he a portent that General John
DeWitt is ready to crack down on a lot of things, including football.
General DeWitt has never set a definite crowd limit, hut does he in
dicate that he will look with pleasure on crowds of 30,000 or more
which are bound to jam vital road lanes?"

To all of which we reply: 'tain't necessarily so.
Firstly, the Army did NOT advise Stanford graduate manager A1 Masters
to move the Southern California game to Kezar Stadium in San Francisco.
Mr. Laird can recall that one again.
Secondly, Stanford is not taking a "schoolboy" attitude in bringing the
f game back to its own stadium. Mr. Laird" does not tell us what his
"schoolboy" blurb means anyway, and what we take it to mean is not so.
This university is co-operating to the fullest extent with public and Army
officials. When and if General DeWitt takes it upon himself to ask Stanford
personally to move its game to San Francisco, the B.A.C. will do so.
As to Mr. Laird's reference to General DeWitt's frowning on crowds
over 30.000, does he remember that last July 4 there were upwards of
75,000 persons in attendance at the Mac Arthur Day celebration at Kezar?
And did General DeWitt do anything about it?
Does Mr. Laird know, as he must, that there are two main highways
connecting San Francisco and Palo Alto, the Bayshore and 101? Couldn't
those whose tires are in good enough condition to warrant a 30-mile
drive here use one highway in deference to the other which could be left
open for possible military use?
And finally, why don't the city sports writers stop drumming up
stories that are adverse to the continuance of football on the coast as a
whole this fall? Since the Army has the last word on last-minute
cancellations, let them also have the first word on everything else
connected with the very difficult situation of having a football season.
And the bet is safe as a defense bond that those self-same writers want to
see football in California, and the other coastal states this year. Amen.
