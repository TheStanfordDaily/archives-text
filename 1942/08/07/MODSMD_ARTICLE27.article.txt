# TICKETS TO W.S.C. GAME:
## 
### 
For those students who wish to go to the Stanford-Washington State
football game, to be played Sept. 26 here, all that is necessary for admit
tance is a spring or summer quarter student body card for regular students;
and for transfers and freshmen the blue acceptance slip to the university
will do fine.
