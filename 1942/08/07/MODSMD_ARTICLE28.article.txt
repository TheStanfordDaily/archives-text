# Stanford Netman Misses Nationals
## 
### 
CULVER, Ind., Aug. 6.â€”Only one
of the nation's top young players
missing today as the National Junior
championships went into the second
round was Ted Myers, Stanford
freshman, who was unable to leave
his studies on the coast to compete
in this annual tourney.
Budge Patty and Bob Falkenburg,
Myers' fellow Californians, and co
favorites to win the 1942 title, had
little trouble with their early-round
opponents.
