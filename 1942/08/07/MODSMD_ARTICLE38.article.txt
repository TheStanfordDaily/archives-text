FT HASN'T been the policy of
.1 the editorial columns of this
paper to degrade our neighbors
across the bay at Berkeley. Of
course, at times friendly jibes
have crept in, but none of them
have been in seriousness.
But there comes a time when
a man can stand no more; so we
are hereby answering a com
ment made at the end of the
Letters to the Ice Box column of
The Daily Californian, which
corresponds to The Daily's
Campus Opinion column.
Someone wrote to the Ice Box
saying that he liked California
and that he thought it was about
:ime Cal got the "reputation she
deserves." Then the editor an
swered that the contributor "is
: : ortunate in having escaped al
most unscathed an attack of
some of the most pernicious
orms of Stanford propaganda.
. . Such slander is merely
one of the crosses to be borne
by persons in envied positions."
That is one of the most beau
iful confessions that we have
ever read. The editor of the
noble Daily Californian prac
ically admits that the members
of the study body at the Uni
versity of California are very
susceptible to all forms of prop
aganda, especially that coming
rom Leland Stanford Junior
'Jniversity.
It is pretty strange that with
all of the persons who are being
educated at Berkeley that most
of them heve helped spread the
word around that "the campus
was unfriendly, all the profes
sors dull, the gals and or guys a
weird and wicked looking lot."
At least that's what "I Like Cal
45," the contributor, said his
friends told him.
Well, it's nice to see one per
son who has sense enough to
'ook around his campus and dis
cover a few of its finer points.
That little comment about
such slander being one of the
crosses to be borne by persons
in envied positions was nat
urally thrown in to fill up the
space at the end of the column.
Such is the method of those who
have nothing to say.
Daily staff members will gath
er at the Shack Monday after
noon at 2:30 for the last staff
meeting of the quarter. It is es
sential that all members attend.
The pre reg edition will be out-
Jined.

FT HASN'T been the policy of
.1 the editorial columns of this
paper to degrade our neighbors
across the bay at Berkeley. Of
course, at times friendly jibes
have crept in, but none of them
have been in seriousness.
But there comes a time when
a man can stand no more; so we
are hereby answering a com
ment made at the end of the
Letters to the Ice Box column of
The Daily Californian, which
corresponds to The Daily's
Campus Opinion column.
Someone wrote to the Ice Box
saying that he liked California
and that he thought it was about
:ime Cal got the "reputation she
deserves." Then the editor an
swered that the contributor "is
: : ortunate in having escaped al
most unscathed an attack of
some of the most pernicious
orms of Stanford propaganda.
. . Such slander is merely
one of the crosses to be borne
by persons in envied positions."
That is one of the most beau
iful confessions that we have
ever read. The editor of the
noble Daily Californian prac
ically admits that the members
of the study body at the Uni
versity of California are very
susceptible to all forms of prop
aganda, especially that coming
rom Leland Stanford Junior
'Jniversity.
It is pretty strange that with
all of the persons who are being
educated at Berkeley that most
of them heve helped spread the
word around that "the campus
was unfriendly, all the profes
sors dull, the gals and or guys a
weird and wicked looking lot."
At least that's what "I Like Cal
45," the contributor, said his
friends told him.
Well, it's nice to see one per
son who has sense enough to
'ook around his campus and dis
cover a few of its finer points.
That little comment about
such slander being one of the
crosses to be borne by persons
in envied positions was nat
urally thrown in to fill up the
space at the end of the column.
