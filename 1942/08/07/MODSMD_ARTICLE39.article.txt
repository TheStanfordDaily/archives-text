### BILL STEIF 
JT IS eight months ago today that
the Japs struck at Pearl Harbor.
Those first days after December 7
sent a tremendous tremor of excite
ment through the United States. Ev
erybody was sore and everybody
was determined. We were going to
be in Tokyo in fantastically short
times, our production was going to
wallop Hitler in less time.
In Washington there was confu
sion. plenty of it, but we thought
that this would gradually got
straightened out, that in a month,
maybe two months, we would
really he rolling. And the wave of
excitement simmered down to
what was supposed to be good,
strong American determination.
Well, we certainly haven't been
rolling in the last six months, and
sometimes I wonder about Ameri
can determination. There's Aroff
and the ftar "brokers"—profiteers
to you—and the Navy's Public
Relations Office which seems to be
coddling a supposedly strong-stom
ached and determined people, and
the case of a few thousand tons of
unaccounted-for steel and the ter
rific rubber mess and the fact that
at least 431 of our cargo ships have
gone to the bottom of the Atlantic
and Pacific since January 1 and
lots of other little things which add
up into something awfully big.
♦ * *
JN FACT, the thing is so big it is
difficult to see what it is. Now I,
for one, do not think that the Amer
ican people have grown "soft" in the
last 20 or 25 years. Many people
think that this is true and sometimes
when you look around at some of
the moola-bloated boys at Stanford,
for instance, you think maybe that is
it. But since most Americans haven't
got a lot of long green, I can't see it.
It may be that our leadership has
been and is bad. This, I believe,
comes a lot closer to the mark. It
started with the shallow sincerity
of our last wartime President and
has lasted right down to today.
Lonely Mr. Hoover—aloof, un
loved, and apparently not under
standing that a real world revo
lution had begun at Sarajevo in
1914 and that the Russian Revolu
tion, for instance, and the depres
sion were just two aspects of some
fundamental change—did nothing.
Mr. Roosevelt, however, was and
is of a different stripe. He is so
anxious to do something, it seems,
that he is trying to do everything,
trying to satisfy everybody, and. as
a result. I don't think he is doing
very much. He is a politician who
simply loves people, all people, and
therefore vacillates—far too much.
I fear. FDR. I think, understands
that there are some changes being
made, but he is so rooted in the
dying tradition of laissez-faire in
dividualism that it is dillicult for
him to see it pass from the his
torical scene as it is doing. Most
of the "social" ideas which the
President has plugged have not. it
must be remembered, been his
own, but rather those of his "bright
young men" who have talked him
into them.

'"pHUS we see that we are (1) los
ing the war; (2) living in a
Deriod in which men's ideas and very
lives are changing radically. Per
haps the first fact is related to the
second. I think it is.
Perhaps one reason that we are
losing the war is that we do not
know what we are fighting for—that
we do not realize that because of the
world revolution in which we are
involved we can never go back to
even the days of Roosevelt's first
two terms. Perhaps it is tune to come
to the realization that we are fighting
for the better items which we knew
in '"the good old days," that is our
freedoms, and at the same time for
several of the undeniably brilliant
aspects of Fascism and Naziisin,

notably a socialized economy and col
lective effort in times of crisis. We
are, I think, the moderates in this
war who are battling for a synthesis.
That, at least, is how I conceive it
and I think if this idea were in the
minds of many Americans we would j
have a firmer basis for the fight, less
confusion—and be a good deal closer
to winning the war.

JN FACT, the thing is so big it is
difficult to see what it is. Now I,
for one, do not think that the Amer
ican people have grown "soft" in the
last 20 or 25 years. Many people
think that this is true and sometimes
when you look around at some of
the moola-bloated boys at Stanford,
for instance, you think maybe that is
it. But since most Americans haven't
got a lot of long green, I can't see it.
It may be that our leadership has
been and is bad. This, I believe,
comes a lot closer to the mark. It
started with the shallow sincerity
of our last wartime President and
has lasted right down to today.
Lonely Mr. Hoover—aloof, un
loved, and apparently not under
standing that a real world revo
lution had begun at Sarajevo in
1914 and that the Russian Revolu
tion, for instance, and the depres
sion were just two aspects of some
fundamental change—did nothing.
Mr. Roosevelt, however, was and
is of a different stripe. He is so
anxious to do something, it seems,
that he is trying to do everything,
trying to satisfy everybody, and. as
a result. I don't think he is doing
very much. He is a politician who
simply loves people, all people, and
therefore vacillates—far too much.
I fear. FDR. I think, understands
that there are some changes being
made, but he is so rooted in the
dying tradition of laissez-faire in
dividualism that it is dillicult for
him to see it pass from the his
torical scene as it is doing. Most
of the "social" ideas which the
President has plugged have not. it
must be remembered, been his
own, but rather those of his "bright
young men" who have talked him
into them.

therefore vacillates—far too much.
I fear. FDR. I think, understands
that there are some changes being
made, but he is so rooted in the
dying tradition of laissez-faire in
dividualism that it is dillicult for
him to see it pass from the his
torical scene as it is doing. Most
of the "social" ideas which the
President has plugged have not. it
must be remembered, been his
own, but rather those of his "bright
young men" who have talked him
into them.

'"pHUS we see that we are (1) los

Perhaps one reason that we are
losing the war is that we do not

we do not realize that because of the
world revolution in which we are
involved we can never go back to
even the days of Roosevelt's first

in '"the good old days," that is our
freedoms, and at the same time for
several of the undeniably brilliant
aspects of Fascism and Naziisin,

notably a socialized economy and col

are, I think, the moderates in this
war who are battling for a synthesis.

minds of many Americans we would j

confusion—and be a good deal closer
to winning the war.
JT IS eight months ago today that
the Japs struck at Pearl Harbor.
Those first days after December 7
sent a tremendous tremor of excite
ment through the United States. Ev
erybody was sore and everybody
was determined. We were going to
be in Tokyo in fantastically short
times, our production was going to
wallop Hitler in less time.
In Washington there was confu
sion. plenty of it, but we thought
that this would gradually got
straightened out, that in a month,
maybe two months, we would
really he rolling. And the wave of
excitement simmered down to
what was supposed to be good,
strong American determination.
Well, we certainly haven't been
rolling in the last six months, and
sometimes I wonder about Ameri
can determination. There's Aroff
and the ftar "brokers"—profiteers
to you—and the Navy's Public
Relations Office which seems to be
coddling a supposedly strong-stom
ached and determined people, and
the case of a few thousand tons of
unaccounted-for steel and the ter
rific rubber mess and the fact that
at least 431 of our cargo ships have
gone to the bottom of the Atlantic
and Pacific since January 1 and
lots of other little things which add
up into something awfully big.
♦ * *
JN FACT, the thing is so big it is
difficult to see what it is. Now I,
for one, do not think that the Amer
ican people have grown "soft" in the
last 20 or 25 years. Many people
think that this is true and sometimes
when you look around at some of
the moola-bloated boys at Stanford,
for instance, you think maybe that is
it. But since most Americans haven't
got a lot of long green, I can't see it.
It may be that our leadership has
been and is bad. This, I believe,
comes a lot closer to the mark. It
started with the shallow sincerity
of our last wartime President and
has lasted right down to today.
Lonely Mr. Hoover—aloof, un
loved, and apparently not under
standing that a real world revo
lution had begun at Sarajevo in
1914 and that the Russian Revolu
tion, for instance, and the depres
sion were just two aspects of some
fundamental change—did nothing.
Mr. Roosevelt, however, was and
is of a different stripe. He is so
anxious to do something, it seems,
that he is trying to do everything,
trying to satisfy everybody, and. as
a result. I don't think he is doing
very much. He is a politician who
simply loves people, all people, and
therefore vacillates—far too much.
I fear. FDR. I think, understands
that there are some changes being
made, but he is so rooted in the
dying tradition of laissez-faire in
dividualism that it is dillicult for
him to see it pass from the his
torical scene as it is doing. Most
of the "social" ideas which the
