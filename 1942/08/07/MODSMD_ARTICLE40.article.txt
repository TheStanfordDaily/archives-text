# Stanford Letter Entered in Trial
## 
### 
Commendatory letters, one bear
ing the signature of Dean Marion R.
Kirkwood of the Stanford Law
School, were introduced by the de
fense into the court-martial trial of
Lt. Cmdr. Maurice Aroff yesterday.

Aroff took the stand and briefly
told his life history. He said he en
listed in the Navy at the age of 14.
In 1936 he applied for a commission
in the naval reserve, but was re
jected for lack of professional ex
perience and education. Intensive

tutoring on navigation, seamanship
and mathematics enabled him to get
the commission the same year.
Aroff is on trial for charges rang
ing from scandalous conduct to falsi
fication of enlistment data.
