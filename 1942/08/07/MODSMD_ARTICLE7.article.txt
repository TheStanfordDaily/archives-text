# Soldiers to See 'Tartuffe' Free
## 
### 
Continuing their policy of playing
host to service men, the Stanford
Players will reserve free seats for
all men in uniform when "Tartuffe"
opens August 13 for a three-day run.
Rehearsal continued today under
the direction of Asher Wilson, who
has taken over Charles Vance's di
rection job. Vance, who was in
ducted into the army two weeks ago,
returned on leave to get the play
started.
Before he left, he stated that he
would try to return for the opening
of the play, but could not say
whether the authorities would allow
him to make the trip.
