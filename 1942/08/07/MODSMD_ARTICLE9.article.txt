# We're Fighting For Philosophy Of Lifeâ€”Stace
## Author-Philosopher Addresses Education Club on Democracy 
### 
Dr. Walter Terence Stace, whose
hook, "The Destiny of Western Man,"
was recently awarded a national
first prize, addressed the Education
Club yesterday on "What Are We
Fighting For?"
"We're fighting for a philosophy of
life and so are the totalitarians," Dr.
Stace declared. "Our democratic phi
losophy is derived from early Greek
admiration of l'eason and moderation
and from the Christian ethical ideal
of selflessness. This accounts for our
tendency to settle international dis
putes through arbitration, and it ac
counts for our principle of demo
cratic equality."
Dr. Stace then proceeded to trace
the origins of the totalitarian phi
losophy. "Totalitarianism is derived
from Schopenhauer, who believed
that force of will is more important
that reason, love, or any other hu
man attribute. Such a philosophy
develops a ruthless, powerful indi
vidual.
"Since our government in the
United States is the political expres
sion of the democratic ideals of rea
son. moderation, and selflessness, the
totalitarian peoples in fighting
against it are trying to subvert the
whole light of the western world for
the last 2,000 years."
A former member of the British
civil service for 12 years and private
secretary to the governor of Ceylon,
Dr. Stace is now professor of phi
losophy at Princeton University.
