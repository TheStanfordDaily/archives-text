# Towering Stairs To Highlight Tart'
## 
### ALAN HEDDEN 
Waldemar Johansen, who believes
in bigger and bigger stage settings,
has almost topped himself with the
design and construction of the set
for Moliere's "Tartuffe," which opens
Thursday for a three-day run at the
Memorial Theater. The set, featur
ing a huge staircase unit, towers 32
feet above the stage floor.
The application of decorative de
sign to a Baroque set, such as the
one now under construction, pre
sents a terrific problem, according to
Mr. Johansen. "Architectural struc
ture," he explained, "was almost
completely hidden by decor at that
time, and so, when I design for the
period, I must use a lot of decora
tion. huge curlicues and such. And,
having designed it, I must help
paint it on the set."
TIIIRI) DIMENSION
"The artists of the Baroque pe
riod," Johansen continued, "strove to
give a heavy, three-dimensional
quality to their work." The stage sets
of that time, he went on, were all
two-dimensional, but for the benefit
of both actors and director, the set
for the Players' production of "Tar
tuffe" will be three-dimensional, in
volving the tremendous circular
staircase, which is the featured part
of the design.
"Most actors like steps," he added,
"and this construction gives a de
cidedly classical touch to the stage
setting, which is in good accord with
the classical nature of Moliere's
writing."
WALNUT AND TURQUOISE
The whole set is finished in a
light walnut color with decorations
in turquoise. Trick moving lighting
effects have been developed and will
be managed by Joyce Henderson
and Paul Hostetler. William Girvan
is in charge of all construction, with
Clayton McCarty assisting in the
crew work.
Rehearsal continued today under
the direction of Asher Wilson, who
has taken over Charles Vance's di
rection job, and Marcia Shaughnessy.

Vance, inducted into the Army
two weeks ago, hopes to return for
the opening, "but it's all up to the
Army," he reminded.

Waldemar Johansen, who believes
in bigger and bigger stage settings,
has almost topped himself with the
design and construction of the set
for Moliere's "Tartuffe," which opens
Thursday for a three-day run at the
Memorial Theater. The set, featur
ing a huge staircase unit, towers 32
feet above the stage floor.
The application of decorative de
sign to a Baroque set, such as the
one now under construction, pre
sents a terrific problem, according to
Mr. Johansen. "Architectural struc
ture," he explained, "was almost
completely hidden by decor at that
time, and so, when I design for the
period, I must use a lot of decora
tion. huge curlicues and such. And,
having designed it, I must help
paint it on the set."
TIIIRI) DIMENSION
"The artists of the Baroque pe
riod," Johansen continued, "strove to
give a heavy, three-dimensional
quality to their work." The stage sets
of that time, he went on, were all
two-dimensional, but for the benefit
of both actors and director, the set
for the Players' production of "Tar
tuffe" will be three-dimensional, in
volving the tremendous circular
staircase, which is the featured part
of the design.
"Most actors like steps," he added,
"and this construction gives a de
cidedly classical touch to the stage
setting, which is in good accord with
the classical nature of Moliere's
writing."
WALNUT AND TURQUOISE
The whole set is finished in a
light walnut color with decorations
in turquoise. Trick moving lighting
effects have been developed and will
be managed by Joyce Henderson
and Paul Hostetler. William Girvan
is in charge of all construction, with
Clayton McCarty assisting in the
crew work.
Rehearsal continued today under
the direction of Asher Wilson, who
has taken over Charles Vance's di
rection job, and Marcia Shaughnessy.
assistant director.
Vance, inducted into the Army
two weeks ago, hopes to return for
the opening, "but it's all up to the
Army," he reminded.
