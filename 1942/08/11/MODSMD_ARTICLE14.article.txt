CHANCE SELECTION:
* That today's conference of graduate managers in San Francisco will
bring out what we've waited for a long time: that freshmen will bo able
to play on varsity teams this fall. Not that the g.m. meeting can say
"yes," just like that. Any motion on allowing first-year men to compete
on varsity teams would have to be okayed by the conference faculty
representatives.
Although the faculty members have no meeting again until December,
a telegraphic poll could be taken. The University of San Francisco's
athletic manager, Jimmy Needles, announced last week that the Dons

expect to allow freshmen on their
varsity squads.
Needles' decision is also subject to
approval by the U.S.F. board, and
he will be eyeing conference officials
like a hawk today when and if the
matter is brought up. U.S.F. is not
a member of the conference, but has
generally abided by conference rules,
since it schedules games with confer
ence schools.
As for the yeas and nays on the
subject, why not allow frosh to play
on varsity teams?
In Stanford's own case in particu
lar: there is now no frosh coach.
Planning the usual frosh team would
necessitate hiring a new coach and
expenditures made for him and for
uniforms and equipment.
Not so hot in the midst of the war
and curtailed budgets.
Also, the speeded-up system of go
ing to college for three years in
stead of four, taking in summer
school, gives the athlete only two
years of eligible competition on var
sity teams.

Some say it will be too tough on the younger men. The Japs will be
tougher.
