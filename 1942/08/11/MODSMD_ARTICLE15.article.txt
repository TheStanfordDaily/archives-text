# FRANKIE ALBERT STAYS HOME:
## 
### 
Ensign Frankie Albert, stationed at the Naval Aviation Pre-Flight
School at St. Mary's, couldn't accept an invitation to appear in the Aug
ust 28 football game at Chicago for the collegiate all-stars.
Ensign Albert is attached to the Naval Aviation Cadet Selection Board
and could not be granted leave. According to dispatches from North
western University, where the all-stars are training. Bob Zuppke evinced
plenty of disappointment when told that Albert would be unable to report.
In trying to outmatch the skill of George Halas, who employs the T
formation in his Bear team. Albert would have been just the man to help
Zup teach the T to the other players unfamiliar with its more inside
intricacies.
