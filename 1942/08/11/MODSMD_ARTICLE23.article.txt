# Scrap Collections Will Start Soon
## 
### 
To co-operate with a statewide |
salvage campaign, soon to be offi- j
cially announced by Governor 01- !
son. the Salvage Committee plans to |
place a "scrap collecting barrel" in !
front of the Union.
The.statewide drive is expected to |
begin the week of August 17, but the
official announcement of the drive
has not yet been made. The salvage ;
committee, under the chairmanship
of Bill Hutchinson, will place a bar
rel in front of the Union where small i
scrap materials may be placed by
the students. Any metal material,
such as old compacts and key con
tainers are acceptable.
Governor Olson especially urged
the Stanford Salvage Committee to
co-operate in the drive. Since it is j
not appropriate this late in the quar
ter to stage a campus-wide scrap
drive, Hutchinson said, students are
asked to co-operate by saving their ;
old scrap materials and placing them
in the barrel as they go by the
Union.
Stanford's first graduating class in
1892 contained 29 transfer students
