# Dr. Brandt Predicts No Fat, Oil Shortages
## 
### 
Unless drastic, unforeseen changes
occur, there will be no rationing of
fats and oils to consumers in Amer
ica, Dr. Karl Brandt of the Stanford
Food Research Institute said yester
day. Dr. Brandt lias recently re
turned from Washington, D.C.,
where he served for the past three
months as economic adviser to
Claude A. Wickard, Secretary of
Agriculture.
"There will be no rationing to
consumers in this country unless they
become panicky and cause too much
inequality through hoarding," Dr.
Brandt declared. "The farmers of
America are not only fulfilling high
production goals but for some crops,
such as soy beans, peanuts and flax
seed, they have left the most op
timistic expectations," he contin
ued.
LEND-LEASE INCREASED
Lend-lease shipments of fats and
oils to Great Britain and Russia have
increased greatly, he reported, while
the domestic situation still remains
favorable.
South America, especially Argen

>Tina, has more fats than we can ab
sorb, the Stanford food economist
said, but because of the losses in
shipping space, more important
products such as bauxite, meat, and
coffee are being moved in preference
to the fats and oils.
Dr. Brandt has proposed a new
method of shipping fats and oils to '
the Quartermaster General of the ;
Army. At present, shortenings are
being shipped in round containers
which waste scarce metals and space, j
do not permit stacking, and many
times the containers burst in transit
because of shifting cargoes.
HYDROGEN ATI ON
Dr. Brandt has suggested to the
Army that the vegetable oils be "hy- j
drogenated" to a hard consistency.
The shortening can then be molded
into square forms and packed into
regular Army containers. This j
method provides not only gains in
trucking, railroad and ocean ship
ping space and saves waste, but also
results in saving storage space be- j
fore shipping and at the destination.
"Samples of highly hydrogenated

vegetable shortenings have been
submitted to the Quartermaster Gen
eral, and the method has every
probability of being adopted by the
Army and later on for lend-lease
shipments," the Stanford food econ
omist concluded.
The 1942 Stanford University Sum
mer Quarter with 2,035 students en- j
rolled is the largest in the history of j
the University. The previous record
of 1,409 was made in 1929.

Claude A. Wickard, Secretary of
Agriculture.
"There will be no rationing to
consumers in this country unless they
become panicky and cause too much
inequality through hoarding," Dr.
Brandt declared. "The farmers of
America are not only fulfilling high
production goals but for some crops,
such as soy beans, peanuts and flax
seed, they have left the most op
timistic expectations," he contin
ued.
LEND-LEASE INCREASED
Lend-lease shipments of fats and
oils to Great Britain and Russia have
increased greatly, he reported, while
the domestic situation still remains
favorable.
South America, especially Argen

>Tina, has more fats than we can ab
sorb, the Stanford food economist
said, but because of the losses in
shipping space, more important
products such as bauxite, meat, and
coffee are being moved in preference
to the fats and oils.
Dr. Brandt has proposed a new
method of shipping fats and oils to '
the Quartermaster General of the ;
Army. At present, shortenings are
being shipped in round containers
which waste scarce metals and space, j
do not permit stacking, and many
times the containers burst in transit
because of shifting cargoes.
HYDROGEN ATI ON
Dr. Brandt has suggested to the
Army that the vegetable oils be "hy- j
drogenated" to a hard consistency.
The shortening can then be molded
into square forms and packed into
regular Army containers. This j
method provides not only gains in
trucking, railroad and ocean ship
ping space and saves waste, but also
results in saving storage space be- j
fore shipping and at the destination.
"Samples of highly hydrogenated

vegetable shortenings have been
submitted to the Quartermaster Gen
eral, and the method has every
probability of being adopted by the
Army and later on for lend-lease
shipments," the Stanford food econ
omist concluded.
The 1942 Stanford University Sum
mer Quarter with 2,035 students en- j
rolled is the largest in the history of j
the University. The previous record
of 1,409 was made in 1929.
Unless drastic, unforeseen changes
occur, there will be no rationing of
fats and oils to consumers in Amer
ica, Dr. Karl Brandt of the Stanford
Food Research Institute said yester
day. Dr. Brandt lias recently re
turned from Washington, D.C.,
where he served for the past three
months as economic adviser to
Claude A. Wickard, Secretary of
