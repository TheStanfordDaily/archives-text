# HOPES TO FINISH PLAY
## 
### 
Coach Elwyn Bugge, tennis coach,
I requested all semi-iinalists in the
All-University men's tennis tourna
ment to play off their matches this
week and hoped that all play would
be finished by the end of the week.
The tower of the Hoover Library
on War, Revolution, and Peace at
Stanford University is 280 feet in
height, and is equal to a 16-story
I building.
