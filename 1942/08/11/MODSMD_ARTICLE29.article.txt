## AND THE MOON'S GREEN CHEESE 
### MIKE CHURCHILL 
Autumn Quarter, without
fail, an unfortunate situation
arises outside the gates of some
football stadium where Stanford is
playing.
The subject is, of course, student
body cards.
Because a lad cannot remember
his grandmother's maiden name, or
doesn't recall the Republican nomi
nation for Congress from his home
town, he is suspected of trying to
cheat his way into the game.
There are many ex-students who
recall bitterly the time when hun
dreds were kept from seeing the first
quarter of a game in Los Angeles
because each card was meticulously
checked.
With more games to be played in
the City, and with the possibility of
limited attendance, there is every
likelihood that this situation will
arise frequently during the coming
season.
Year after year The Daily, the
Chappie, and the student body have
complained about this unfair prac
tice, but so far they have been bay
ing at the moon.
Other colleges solve the matter by
printing student body cards with
the holder's picture on them. While
this costs more, the additional ex
pense is partly overcome by having
the cards last for three successive
quarters or more.
We think that we can speak for the
students when we condemn the past
practices of stadium gatekeepers and
ask that a remedy be found.
