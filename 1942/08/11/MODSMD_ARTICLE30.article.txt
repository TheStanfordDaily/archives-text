,4 s LONG AS we are on the sub
ject of making Stanford more
something or other, we suggest that:
(a) the Cellar remain open after
the Sunday movies. After all, they
were started to keep people on cam
pus, so why make them go down
town to get a coke or hamburger
after the show?
(b) the Cellar try to remain open
a little later when there is a dance
on campus. For reason see above.
While on the subject of the Cellar,
our operative, Secret Agent X Mi
nus 9, writes in from his outpost
under the cash register that a lad
kept returning to the counter for
coffee refills the other day.
'My," said the waitress, fizzing
like an Alka-Seltzer. "you sure do
like coffee."
'"Yeah." replied the guy, altering
his ego to suit the occasion, but I
sure hate to drink so much hot
water to taste it."
