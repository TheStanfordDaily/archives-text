# NEW BIG GAME
## 
### 
JF, IN COMING YEARS, there
should be no Big Game, we sug
gest that the ROTC's from Stanford
and Berkeley engage in mock combat
in its place.
The one big trouble with this sug
gestion is that should it ever come
about, the City papers would prob
ably have the Berkeley team slated
to play in the Tokio bowl after the
first three practice scrimmages.
Finally, we suggest that you take
heart in the news that this column
can only be written once more this
quarter.
Stanford University is situated
only 6.000 miles from Tokyo and is
in direct line of enemy bomber
routes to the Atlantic seaboard.
