"MAISIE GETS HER MAN." now
dragging at the Stanford.
"Maisie Gets Her Man" and "Re
member Pearl Harbor" make the
current Stanford bill the season's
biggest double negative.
Under the guise of a comedy,
"Maisie Gets" is about the dreariest
jumble of cheap sets, forced lines,
and monotonous action that ever
wasted away a Sunday afternoon.

•♦■Practically the whole picture takes
place in a low-gxade tenement office
building, a run-down vaudeville
theater, and a down-and-outers'
greasy-spoon restaurant. Add to
that absolutely nothing, except Ann
Southern's frown and whine and
Red Skelton's hopeless humor, and an
ending that is positively the most
nauseating sight since Farmer
Brown's hog drowned in the slop.—
