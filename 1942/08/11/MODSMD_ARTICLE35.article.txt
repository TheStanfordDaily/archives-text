# Crackdown Begins On Traffic Fines
## 
### 
George Tolman, chairman of Men's
Council, warned yesterday that stu
dents must clear up their parking
ticket fines to avoid heavier assess
ments. Tickets must be cleared up
before final examinations or offend
ers' grades will be held up.
This move was necessitated, Tol
man said, "by the large number of
tickets that were given out during
Summer Quarter, and as yet have
not been cleared up."
There will be a meeting of Men's
Council today in the Excom room of
the Union this afternoon at 4:15.
