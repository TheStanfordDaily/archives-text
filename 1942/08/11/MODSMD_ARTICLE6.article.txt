Declaring that a democratic peo
ple—conscious of the values of their
history, dedicated to the advance
ment of mankind, and resolved to
build a structure within which man
kind can live in security and dignity
and peace—will survive, Dr. Edgar
E. Robinson, executive head of the
Stanford history department, spoke
to the Commonwealth Club at San
Francisco's Palace Hotel last Friday.
Tracing the origins and develop
ment of the American way of life.
Dr. Robinson declared, "America's
answer to the challenge of the dicta
tors is to be found in our history.
America, in coming into being in
1776, struck at tyranny and rule by
force."
Dr. Robinson also warned Ameri
cans that the conditions of the world
following the war will not be con
ducive to democracy.
"Democracy will continue to per
sist," he declared, "because it is a
method of surviving social change
without revolution. In order to se
cure that way of life, we must know
democracy for what it has been, we
must insist upon its development,
and we must uphold the three prin
ciples of our success—economic free
dom, social co-operation, and polit- [
ical adaptation."
