(See Editorial on Page 4)

Heavy purchases of War Bonds
helped boost week-end sales of War
Stamps slightly over the quota for
the first three days of War Stamp
Week. Friday's returns totalled
$406.75, and yesterday's total
reached $535.25. All sales for the
first three days amount to $1396.75.
slightly over the three-day quota of
$1350.
With a goal of $2700 to reach by
Wednesday night, War Stamp sales
must reach today's $50 quota, and
exceed Wednesday's final day quota
of $900. The goal of $2700 was ex
perimentally set as a fair estimate of
10 per cent of the student body in
come.
War Board officials express the
hope that the $2700 goal will be
reached as that will be an indication
that students are co-operating with
the nationwide effort to devote 10
per cent of the national income to
War Bonds and Stamps.
Day-to-day tally of the progress
of War Stamp and Bond week is
kept on the "Stamp Out the Axis"
scoreboard over the doorway to the
Cellar. The face of Hirohito has al
ready been blacked out, as has half
of Mussolini's face.
