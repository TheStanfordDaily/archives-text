### 
Determined to "act rather than
talk," Stanford professors have vol
untarily assumed a 10 per cent sal
ary reduction in order to turn more
money to war stamps and bonds.
Acting further. Professors Thomas
Barclay, Joseph Oliphant, Harold
Bacon, Rixford Snyder, and Max
Savelle will sell stamps and bonds
this morning in the Cellar and on
the Quad.
Meanwhile, students purchasing
stamps and bonds yesterday boosted
the total receipts taken in since the
drive started last Friday to $1,916.47.
The Tuesday take amounted to
$519.70, of which $100 was made
possible by the purchase of a war
bond for that amount.
Today, War Board officials were
confident that the goal of $2700 would
be reached by tonight as an indica
tion that "students are co-operating"
with the nationwide effort to devote
10 per cent of the national income to
War Bonds and Stamps. The $2700
goal was set as a fair estimate of 10
per cent of the student body income.
Day-to-day tally of the progress
of War Stamp and Bond week is kept
on the '"Stamp Out the Axis" score
board over the doorway to the Cel
lar. The face of Hirohito has already
been blacked-out, as has practically
three-quarters of Mussolini's face.
