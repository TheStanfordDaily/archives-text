# Frosh Question Junked; Train Squads Limited
## Conference Slashes Traveling Teams To 28 Footballers 
### 
Pacific Coast graduate managers
neatly shut out once and for all the
freshman-varsity eligibility question
at their meeting yesterday when
they recommended a uniform date
be set for the opening of freshman
practice in 1943 but left undiscussed
the matter of allowing frosh to play
on varsity teams this year. The date
asked for is the fourth Monday in
September.
Two other recommendations were
also made:
1. That traveling squads be lim
ited to 28 players. This would apply
only to games more than 50 miles
away.
2. That two quarters will consti
tute a full game in the conference in
event of air raid or emergency. The
standings would then go into a per
centage basis as a win and loss if
one team were ahead after two quar
ters had been completed.
NAPS SLATES 6 C;AMES
Also out of the meeting came
tentatively scheduled games for the
Naval Aviation Pre-Flight School at
St. Mary's including College of the
Pacific Sept. 19; Oregon Sept. 26;
Washington Nov. 12; Stanford Nov.
28; California Dec. 5; and Oregon
State Dec. 12.
The three recommendations will
now be mailed to the faculty repre
sentatives of the conference, who
have the final official word.
The managers arrived at the 28
for traveling squads after railroad
companies indicated that no football
team may have more than one car,
with 32 berths. Twenty-eight play
ei's, plus coaches and newspaper
men, would take all available space.
STANFORD FROSH?
Now that the freshmen-on-var
sity problem is apparently out the
window for this year, Stanford's
Board of Athletic Control will meet
in a special session next Monday to
decide whether the Farm will plan
a frosh team and schedule as in pre
war time.
Stanford now has no freshman
coach, as Harry Shipkey, former
yearling mentor, will be giving full
time duties to the varsity this fall.
The Dames' Reading Group will
meet today at the home of Mrs.
Theodore Kreps, 2335 Waverly, Palo
Alto, at 7:30 p.m.
