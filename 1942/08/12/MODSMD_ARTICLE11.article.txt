# FARCE OPENS TOMORROW NIGHT
## 
### 
Production in '"TarhifTe," to bo
presented tomorrow, Friday, and
Saturday nights, is nearing comple
tion, according to Asher Wilson, new
'iirector. Even the fad that the big
luanner, strung across Lasuen in
front of tlit* Cellar, fell down, could
lot delay things.
Waldemar Johansen, set designer,
was working hard on preview pic
tures of the cast, soon to be seen in
he Quad show cases.
"A more intimate picture of the
<jast, with more of their make-up
.still on. may be seen almost any
norning at 1 o'clock in the Whoopee
Shop in Paly," Director Wilson re- |
narked. "We go there after re- !
learsals and discuss everything from
he show to major surgery."
The most interesting feature of
he huge set designed by Johansen
:'.s a tremendous semi-circular stair
case that swings up and across the '
40 feet of the proscenium opening, i
True to its period the structural J
details are obscured by the lavish '
ornament. Lighting will play a very j
mportant part in the scene changes
with Johansen using color in light, j
ogether with moving effects and J
projections on the sky cyclorama that
,he theater boasts.
Whether former director Charles
Vance could attend the opening night j
was still a matter for speculation;
nowever, Wilson, who was expecting j
x telegram from him, hoped that he [
vould be granted leave in order to I
nake the trip.
