Bill Hutchinson, program super

highly controversial Zete - Encina
softball championship game for the
League B crown may he played as a
feature of Saturday afternoon's Play
Day. There is also a possibility that
finals of the men's intramural tennis
tournament will be held on Ihe wom
en's courts that same afternoon.
WAA may move its volleyball
play-offs up from Thursday to offer
an added feature on the Saturday
program, according to Lucy Terrell,
Lagunita president.
These championship tourneys,
however, will not affect the orig
inally scheduled program, with all
student swimming, tennis, badmin
ton to be conducted as planned.
Staggering athletes will be resusci
tated by doughnuts, ice cream and
cokes, barring unforeseen rationing.
Play Day festivities will begin at
1 o'clock, while students will be re
cruited for a clean-up from 6 to 9.
Compensation for this job will be an
open-air dance in the Union Court.
Saturday's Play Day and open-air
dance will terminate campus-spon
sored social affairs until September's
Pre-Reg dance.
