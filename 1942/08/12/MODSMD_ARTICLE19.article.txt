# Baseball Film Livens Show

"(IRE AT MAN'S LADY." now
pla> ing at the Stanford Theater.
This film, although taking top
billing over its low-budget compan
ion feature, "It Happened in Flat
bush," does not deserve more than
hind play to a "Wontchagivaquarter"
short.
However, Lloyd Nolan, Carole
Landis, and an interesting story in
the "Flatbush" film, make the bill
presentable.
"Great Man's Lady" opens with
Barbara Stanwyck playing the part
of a 150-year-old secret ex-wife of
a long-since dead pioneer and biga
mist, who surprisingly enough turns
out to be Joel McCrea, the other
"name" actor in the show.
After much whining and hobbling
by Miss Stanwyck in a set of uncon
vincing wrinkles, she begins to tell
the story of her life, and the scenes
go back a hundred years to show the
audience what she is talking about.
In order not to spoil the show for
you. I'll say no more.
"It Happened in Flatbush" con
cerns itself with the National
League baseball pennant race of last
year, and goes along at a lively
enough pace up to the final scene
which is a slight letdown if vou

read the newspapers at all last
August.
Neither feature quite comes up to
the standard set by ' Mrs. Miniver."
