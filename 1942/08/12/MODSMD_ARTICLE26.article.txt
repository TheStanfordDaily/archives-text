# Teaching Hatred
## 
### 
THE problem of teaching hat
red came to a point during
Stanford Conference on Edu
cation for War and Peace here
a fortnight ago. Federal officials
and college educators debated
uhe necessity of indoctrinating
.hatred into the war effort.
Dr. Walter Cocking of the
federal Security Agency stress
ed. "We must fight hatred with
hatred, fanaticism with fanati
cism. A soldier with a bayonet
vill fight better if he hates his
enemy and everything he
stands for."
Dr. Albert Guerard of Stan
ord pleaded for rational think
ing, pointing out that highly
nechanized warfare places a
premium on cool-headedness
and that emotional hatred is dan
gerously undependable.
Chances are that both Cock
ng and Guerard are right. We
nust hate Axis ideology enough
to fight to the death against it.
But we don't want to become
vanatics.
What we probably need is a
comprehensive teaching pro
gram for all our fighting forces
and civilians — a program that
will drive home to Americans
he conseguences of an Axis
victory. Only then will we be
able to hate enough to fight and
still preserve the rational think
ing for which we are fighting.—
