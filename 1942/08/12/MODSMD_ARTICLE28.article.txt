# History ...1942

### BILL STEIF 
r is a lot of fighting in the
Solomon Islands these days and
from what our Navy says, perhaps
we are going to be able to get the
islands. Of course, we are losing men
doing this little trick, but obviously
we cannot expect to win this war
without losing men. This means we
shall lose a lot more men (not to
mention ships and equipment) be
fore we do win. The only thing to do
is to steel oneself for the shock and
then dig in some more.
I noticcd that the Solomons have
been getting all the big play in
the local papers. Now. undoubted
ly this American action is im
portant and the local papers sell
much better when they can head
line an American victory, BUT it
seems to me that the Nazi capture
of Maikop and its adjacent oil
fields deserves at least equal play
from a strict news standpoint.
And. even more important, I be
lieve is what is going on in India.
I speak of India advisedly because
I'll admit that I know darn little
about that teeming and mysterious
land. Nevertheless, it does seem that
the loss of India to the Japs would
be a hard blow for the United Na
tions. I am, of course, intimating
that we can lose the war. That is not
saying we will lose but I believe we
will find it a lot easier to win if In
dia does not fall into the hands of
the Japs and Germans.
jyjOHANDAS GANDHI is no
dummy. He has struck at the
British with the demand for Indian
independence at the time when the
British are in mortal danger of los
ing that imperial realm. But let us
glance at the past for a moment.
Gandhi has, since 1927, con
stantly warned the British that In
dia would be no party to a future
war unless India were first con
sulted. "Consulted" means Indian
independence. When this war be
gan Mahatma did not back down
on this point, but when France fell
he did compromise, despite the
fact that a few hours after the war
began Britain, in utter disregard
of Indian wishes, declared India
neutral. Meanwhile India had
armed and equipped 2.000.000 im
perial soldiers who had fought and
died throughout the world.
Now the reason Gandhi compro
mised at the time of the fall of
France was because he wanted to
abandon the policy of non-violence
and take up arms if Britain would
give India a real voice in Indian af
fairs. But there was no soap—not
even the Atlantic Charter, according
to Mr. Churchill, applied to India.
Then came Stafford Cripps after
Singapore had fallen and the Nip
ponese were thrusting westward.
II ERE India and Britain came
within an ace of agreement.
But the English insistence that any
state which wanted to stay out of
an Indian Federal Union could—
giving a new lease on life to the
autocratic Indian princes—and the
British demand that the defense
minister be an Englishman, could
not be stomached by the Indians.
This last point particularly was ob
noxious to Gandhi since he recog
nized that only an Indian with
real powers could rally the nation
around the standard of the United
Nations.
Meanwhile, the usual group of na
tional fascists organized in India and
prepared to hand the country over to
! the Japs. The Indian people, disil
| lusioned by the high-handed actions
j of the British "democracy." began
' swallowing the hypnotizing pill of
i fascism. Gandhi had to act and he
had to act fast. The result is the cur
j rent demand for independence,
i Ganhdi, I think, is acting in the in
: terests of democracy. Gandhi, 1
think, is trying hard to keep the
I fascists from India. And Gandhi re
alizes that the only thing that will
lead the polyglot that is India from
fascism is the granting of Indian in
i dependence.
