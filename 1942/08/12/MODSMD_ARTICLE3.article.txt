U.S. AIR AND LAND FORCES, spearheaded by Marines, are continuing the attack on the Japanese-held
Solomon Islands. Principal points of the American attack are Guadacanal, and Tulagi, strongest Japanese
base in the islands. Allied forces are also said to have raided the New Britain-Bismarck area and attacked
the Japanese base in mid-New Guinea, 55 miles from Port Moresby.
