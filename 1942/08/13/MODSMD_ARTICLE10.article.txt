# Army Officers to Train on Farm
## Quartermaster Training School to Open on Farm Program to Be Carried Out as Part Of Graduate School of Business 
### 
A new school for the training of officers for the Quartermaster Corps of
the Army has just been established at Stanford University by the War
Department and will be open to graduates of universities throughout the
nation who have completed two-year basic ROTC training, the office of
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur announced yesterday.

The program will be carried out as
a part of the Graduate School of
Business and is the only Quarter
master Corps unit on the Pacific
Coast offering the quartermaster
officer training on the graduate level.
Scheduled to begin on September 28,
the program will be an extension of
Stanford's ROTC unit.
GET COMMISSIONS
In addition to having the basic
two-year ROTC training course or its
equivalent, the college graduates
must be under 26 years of age, and
be able to pass the Army physical
examination. Upon completion of
the six-quarter, 18-month program
of work, leading to the degree of
master of business administration,
the men will be commissioned sec
ond lieutenants in the Officers' Re«
serve, Quartermaster Corps.
Under selective service regula
tions, men enrolled in the advance
course of quartermaster training will
be draft exempt and placed in
Class 4-B.
„ "One of the important advantages
of the program is that the regular
course of study in the Graduate
School of Business is almost identical
to that required by the Quartermas
ter Corps for the training of its offi
cers," said Dean J. Hugh Jackson of
the Business School. "And all stu
dents successfully completing the
required program of study will re
ceive the M.B.A. degree at the same
time they are awarded the commis
sion of second lieutenant."

training are to receive money allow
