Stanford casualty stations.
According to a recent inventory,
two stretcher blankets made from
silk stockings, six dozen triangular
bandages and gauze dressings and
24 knitted garments, including watch
caps, rifle mitts, children's sweat

made.
The Work Room will resume its
activities in the autumn.
