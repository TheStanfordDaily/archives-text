# Stanford Students Advised To Work During Vacation
## 
### 
War representatives will speak to the members of all campus eating
tables next Tuesday, outlining an announcement made by the Stanford
War Board yesterday and stressing the nation's need for labor and the
ways in which Stanford students can help fill that need during the coming

September vacation.
The announcement said in part, "It
is imperative that students write to
their home towns now and offer
their services for September. The la
bor situation all over the country is
acutely short. Every employer has
lost men to the draft, and nearly all
are looking for dependable people
to relieve their September vacation
periods and to prepare for their fall
productions.
"If you have ever worked before,
write the person, who previously
employed you, and ask him if he
needs you for the four weeks in
September. Apply at industries with
seasonal projects, canneries, etc.
File your name with the U.S. Em
ployment Office in your locality for
work on farms or in other needed
places," advised the announcement.
Students who plan to stay in the
San Francisco Bay Area may contact
Miss Adelaide Palmer in the Student
Employment Service for the infor
mation about the Bay Area labor
needs.
The national government, in re
sponse to the need for maintaining
a high labor supply, has established
the War Manpower Commisison.
The Red Cross, Civilian Defense,
the USO, salvage drives, and stamp
and bond sales agencies are all places
where Stanford students can help
compansate for labor shortages.
