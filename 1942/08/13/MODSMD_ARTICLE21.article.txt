Play tournament opens August 31 on the sea-fringed
Pehble Beach course.
Raymond Elmer "Dubber" Brownell, former North
ern California amateur champion, former Pacific Coast i
Conference champion, and six-time qualifier for the
National Amateur, who advanced to the quarter-finals [
of last year's state championship, will lead the Indian
quartet.
The other three men, all of whom were members
of the school's N.C.AA. championship team, are Frank
McCann, present P.C.C. champion. George Trapahgen,
winner of the recent Stanford Invitational tourney, and |
Jack Wilson, Deke open champion.
McCann and Traphagen also played in last year's
matches, with the latter advancing to the second

All four are expected to compete in the driving

tournament to be held on Sunday, August 30, the day
before the tourney opens and the day after Stanford's
Summer Quarter final examinations.
The same day North-South exhibition team matches
will be held, and Brownell is expected to hold the po
sition he had on last year's northern team. McCann
and Traphagen, because of their recent improvement,
may also be placed on the teams.
Ernie Peiper of San Jose will be hack to defend
the title he won last year, but his path will not be
an easy one since all of the state's best amateurs
will be entered.
Qualifying rounds will be held Monday with the
match play continuing through the week until Satur
day when the finals will be played.
Pete Low and several other members of last year's
frosh team may also go down for the tourney. Dave
Dowd, Jim LaGasa, and Brown, other Card golfers,
will be unable to play.
