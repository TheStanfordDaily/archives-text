# Football Scouting Won't Be Limited
## 
### 
Along with yesterday's three rec
ommendations made by Pacific Coast
graduate managers at their meeting
in San Francisco was the motion
that there be no limitation on foot
ball scouting. Some modification of
this rule was expected but the man
agers allowed the former scouting
privileges to continue.
They also agreed on the reaffirmed
stand of last year to permit 3,000
service men free admission to all
conference games except the Stan
ford-California contest. All service
men over the 3.000 limit will be
charged 50 cents.
The 50-mile radius agreement,
which would prevent teams from
carrying travelling squads of more
than 28 players to games over 50
miles from home, will allow all teams
full strength at loc .1 traditional
games.
The distance between Santa Clara
and University of California is more
than 50 miles, but Santa Clara, the
visiting team in the Bronco-Bear
tussle, will be allowed to carry a
full squad.
