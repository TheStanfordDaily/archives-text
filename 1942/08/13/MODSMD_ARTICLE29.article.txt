# Work for Victory
## 
### 
WITH only two more weeks
to go before finals start,
Stanford students have already
begun to think about what they
ire going to do with the four
vacation period during
September before the start of
Autumn Quarter.

Many of us have gone straight
ihrough for four quarters; others
have started Stanford in the
Summer Quarter after finishing
:hree or fours years at high
school. Naturally, we want to
cest and enjoy ourselves before
starting school again.
Swimming, boating, and all
<inds of summer sports would
lave been fine last summer and
he summer before, but now that
ve are in this war up to our
aecks, we have a far more im
oortant job to do than getting a
beautiful sun tan.

We who are going to be fight
ng the war from the "home
:ront" can contribute very defi
nitely toward an Allied victory.
We can spend our vacation
vorking, working in defense
olants or canneries or depart
nent stores or service stations
or any place where labor is
needed and needed badly.

The businesses hit the hard
est by the present labor short
tge are those which cannot af
ord to pay high salaries or those
vhich cannot get draft exemp
ion for their employees. The
ong arm of Uncle Sam has
eached into everything in or
der to get an army to beat the
\xis.

So those of us who still have
i few months this side of that
'<haki uniform should do our
oart to keep the wheels of in
dustry rolling. Don't think this
appeal excludes the members
}f the fairer sex, for they, too,
ran "work for victory."
