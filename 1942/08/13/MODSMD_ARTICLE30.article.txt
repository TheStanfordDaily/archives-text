THE Union Cellar usually
bears the brunt of student
:riticism because more students
nhabit that place throughout
'he course of the day than any
Mher spot on the campus. First
here were spots in the cokes,
hen naked hamburgers, then
poor service before 8 a.m., then
closing hours.
None of these have been ade
quately solved except for the
roke spots, but we are positive
now that only a fire or an earth
quake will eliminate the biggest
problem of the Summer Quar
ter, for the very far-sighted
Union directors have thought it
best to anchor the chain by the
cashier with a chromium-plated
post.
Now listen to the students
scream. Antagonism is not a
â€¢shortcut to popularity.
