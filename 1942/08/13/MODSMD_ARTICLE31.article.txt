MAIDEN." said the Editor, "why
write one?"
This was his response to my moan
that a final column is always a
worry.
"You." he went on, "wrote the big
'Farewell, fair Stanford, for I go
now' column back last May and then
snuck back and went on filling Bull
Session as though nothing had hap
pened."
He just doesn't understand, our
Editor. Everyone who has ever writ
ten Bull Session wails all quarter
about writing the last column, hop
ing all the while that some nymph or
muse will whisper the brilliant idea
to him that will bring about the
greatest end-column of all time.
Well, no nymph came along.

IT'S ALWAYS
DONE
B ut tradition says that one who
writes Bull Session must write a
Last Column at least once a volume.
Like Lagunita we are running dry.
And speaking of the Lake, it has
been a source of worry to us, ever
since they began to drain it, just
where the thousands of frogs that
once filled it have gone. I guess God
alone knows the answer to this.
At least one big bull frog is known
to have left the Lake and headed
down toward the Library fountain.
A squashed outline halfway to the
P.O. bears witness to his failure.
It is perhaps just as well. Chances
are he wouldn't have liked the
fountain anyway.
The only reason we mentioned this
was to draw some sort of a moral.
It had to do with Japan or Germany,
or even Italy but for the life of us
we can't remember what it was.
You'll just have to figure it out for
yourselves.

MAYBE THINGS'LL
CHANGE
mentioning the war, we
have figured out, all by our
selves, that the Solomon Island bat
tle is maybe a kind of turning point
in the war.
It is our opinion, and a right good
one we think, that the action was
undertaken to forestall any Jap at
tack on Siberia or India quite apart
from the strategic advantage to be
gained if the islands are taken.
With this new offensive threat
Japan's hands are tied, at least for
the time being. If we are successful
Japan will be on the defensive for
the first time this war. Then watch
out. Mr. Tojo.
Boy, are we profound, today.

WHAT DID YOU
EXPECT?
r |" , HIS column hasn't done a lot this
summer. It yelled a bit about
s on the Q , about the Ride
to Paly, about the salvage drives.
Then we went to the hospital. That
was an experience.
Also, way back in the beginning
we made what we thought was an
innocent jest at Lagunita. Mighty
were the repercussions. The day it
appeared in print our relationship
with Stanford girls sank to a new
low.
All but a few girls have stopped
spitting at us when they see us on
Quad, but they still slap us if we
pinch them.
We also started running little cuts
in an attempt to liven up this col
umn. Mr. Batman, who is our lino
typist. nearly went mad. Finally he
unequivocally announced that if I
ran cuts he wouldn't correct my
spelling and grammar mistakes.
There have been no cuts since.

mentioning the war, we
have figured out, all by our
selves, that the Solomon Island bat
tle is maybe a kind of turning point
in the war.
It is our opinion, and a right good
one we think, that the action was
undertaken to forestall any Jap at
tack on Siberia or India quite apart
from the strategic advantage to be
gained if the islands are taken.
With this new offensive threat
Japan's hands are tied, at least for
the time being. If we are successful
Japan will be on the defensive for
the first time this war. Then watch
out. Mr. Tojo.

Also, way back in the beginning
we made what we thought was an
innocent jest at Lagunita. Mighty

All but a few girls have stopped

There have been no cuts since.

This was his response to my moan
that a final column is always a
worry.
"You." he went on, "wrote the big
'Farewell, fair Stanford, for I go
now' column back last May and then
snuck back and went on filling Bull
Session as though nothing had hap
pened."
He just doesn't understand, our
Editor. Everyone who has ever writ
ten Bull Session wails all quarter
about writing the last column, hop
ing all the while that some nymph or
muse will whisper the brilliant idea
to him that will bring about the
greatest end-column of all time.
Well, no nymph came along.

IT'S ALWAYS
DONE
B ut tradition says that one who
writes Bull Session must write a
Last Column at least once a volume.
Like Lagunita we are running dry.
And speaking of the Lake, it has
been a source of worry to us, ever
since they began to drain it, just
where the thousands of frogs that
once filled it have gone. I guess God
alone knows the answer to this.
At least one big bull frog is known
to have left the Lake and headed
down toward the Library fountain.
