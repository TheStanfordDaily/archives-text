"THE CONDITIONS OF PEACE,",
by Edward IlaUelt Carr. $2.50. Mac-
Millan.
Only in rare instances does war
produce a book that shows keen in
sight into the problems of the post
war world. The first, and finest, such
book of World War II has been writ
ten by Professor Edward Hallett
Carr of the University College of
Wales.
Professor Carr's book is entitled.
"The Conditions of Peace," and it
presents the outspoken recommenda
tions of a scholar who is disgusted
with the muddling of the 1919-39
period.
Warning the victors not to look
backwards in search of principles to
guide the post-war settlement, Pro
fessor Carr bluntly diagnoses world
troubles since 1914 as a contemporary
revolution. It is a revolution, he
says, against three predominant
ideas of the 19th century.
1. Liberal democracy of the 19th
century brand.
2. Selfish national self-determina
tion.
3. Economic laissez-faire.
Professor Carr proposes specific
solutions to these problems, asserts
that we must solve them or civiliza
tion will slip back to the 19th cen
tury. Pleads Professor Carr, "The

The challenge of the revolution can
only be met by redefining and re
interpreting democracy in a new and

revolutionary sense. The present
crisis of democracy is the need for
this redefinition."—Allen
