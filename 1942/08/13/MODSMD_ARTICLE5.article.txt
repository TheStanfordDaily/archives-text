# Tartuffe Lifts Curtain at 8
## Vance Given Leave To Attend Opening 
### ALAN HEDDEN 
Stanford's 1942 summer theater
season goes into its last lap tonight
with the opening of a three-day run
of "Tartuffe," Moliere's famous com
edy of manners. And the show will
not be without the services of its
drafted director, Charles Vance.
Asher Wilson, co-dh~ector, re
ceived a wire from Vance last night,
saying that he had been given spe
cial leave from his Army duties to
attend tonight's opening.
BAROQUE SET
Set in the latter half of the 17th
century, the play is staged accord
ingly on a gigantic baroque set,
which was specially predesigned by
Waldemar Johansen to give the
heavy, three-dimensional effect that
the period demands. A huge, 32-
foot circular stair set, done in a
light walnut color with decorations
in turquoise, is the featured piece.
The stair is made especially effective
for the actors by the use of trick
colored lights.
In this production the very diffi
cult and complex job of costuming
has been handled by Hazel Brain.
This marks her first major costume
play as head of the costuming de
partment at Stanford.
OUTSTANDING CAST
The cast contains the names of
many of Stanford's old standbys
with the addition of many new
names, some of them making their
first appearance in a Stanford pro
duction. The inimitable Johnny
Lawry is admirably cast as the hypo
critical Tartuffe, the hero, while Co-
Director Wilson plays the part of the
gullible Orgon.
Bob Finney, a newcomer to Stan
ford drama, is well cast in the role
of Damis, fiery son of Organ. Tom
Townsend, looking almost like
movieman Doug Fairbanks, is cast
as the dashing lover, Valere, while
Allan Treat, well known for his
work at the Palo Alto Community
Theater, will be seen as the long-
Concluding this outstanding cast
are Pat Allen, seen as the dainty and
are aPt Allen, seen as the dainty and
tearful Mariane; Anne Meadows,
the peppery and vivacious Madame
Pernelle, mother of Orgon: and
Marcie Baum, playing the part of
the mischievous Dorine.

Stanford's 1942 summer theater
season goes into its last lap tonight
with the opening of a three-day run
of "Tartuffe," Moliere's famous com
edy of manners. And the show will
not be without the services of its
drafted director, Charles Vance.
Asher Wilson, co-dh~ector, re
ceived a wire from Vance last night,
saying that he had been given spe
cial leave from his Army duties to
attend tonight's opening.
BAROQUE SET
Set in the latter half of the 17th
century, the play is staged accord
ingly on a gigantic baroque set,
which was specially predesigned by
Waldemar Johansen to give the
heavy, three-dimensional effect that
the period demands. A huge, 32-
foot circular stair set, done in a
light walnut color with decorations
in turquoise, is the featured piece.
The stair is made especially effective
for the actors by the use of trick
colored lights.
In this production the very diffi
cult and complex job of costuming
has been handled by Hazel Brain.
This marks her first major costume
play as head of the costuming de
partment at Stanford.
