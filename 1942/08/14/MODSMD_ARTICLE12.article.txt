# 'Tartuffe' Wins Critic's Praise
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Moliere's classical satire, "Tar
tuffe," playing again tonight and to
morrow night in Memorial Hall,
brings off the Players' summer sea
son in a style highly successful.
The lively, versatile, and not at
all unattractive Marcie Baum suc
ceeds in securely stealing the show

before it ever gets going, which is
not till after intermission, playing a
garrulous, outspoken Mariane's maid.
Through the fault of Moliere, how
ever, "Tartuffe" does not develop
into a minor riot till the arrival of
Tartuffe. who being done by John
Lawry, proceeds at long last to play
the situations to their seams — the
dialog at this point being happily
aided by Moliere.
Up to the intermission the inter
minable soliloquies are excellently
borne by the veteran manner of
Ash Wilson, the melodious baritone
of Allen Treat, and the nicely re
strained acting of Patricia Allen.
The setting is a marvel in itself,
as when has a Waldemar Johansen
setting been otherwise? Hazel
Brain's costuming is as usual un
usual. And Lullylic music well sug
gests the period—if also that the play
might better have been an opera.
