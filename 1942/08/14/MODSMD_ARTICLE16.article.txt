# Johnson Holds Track Preview
## 
### 
To glimpse a prospectus of next
spring's track team, Coach Pitch
Johnson has arranged a special meet
to be held on Angell Field a week
from today in which several Stan
lord varsity members will compete
and also others expected to carry the
Indian banner in the spring track
campaign. Johnson said yesterday
that all events cannot be filled, how
ever, and anyone wishing to com
pete may do so. The meet starts at
4:30 p.m.

Among those varsity stars to ap
pear are Ed Stamm and Ed Voss in
the weight events. Others planning
to enter are Bruce Meyer, Ralph
Schaffarzick, and Charles Bancroft
in the middle distances; Ben Her
rick in the pole vault, and Bill Rit
ter in the hurdles.
Stamm, one of the nation's fore
most shot-putters last spring, has
been putting in time on his discus
torm this summer and may surprise
Coach Johnson with a long throw.
Voss, Giant basketballer, did some
high jumping on the frosh track
team as well as throwing the
weights. Although he is inexperi
enced he has unlimited possibilities.
Meyer was one of last spring's
crack quartet of frosh quarter-mil
ers, while Herrick is a transfer from
San Mateo.

Coach Johnson hopes to uncover
some virgin talent in this impromptu
meet that may later have pregnant
possibilities.
