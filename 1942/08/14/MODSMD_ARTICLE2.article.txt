# Students Plan New V-7 Group
## 
### 
More than 20 V-7 students met in
the Nitery Wednesday night and
outlined plans for a campus organi
zation of V-7 students.
Discussion revolved around inte
grating the V-7 group with the local
Sea Scouts so that students could
gain practical sailing and nautical
experience on Sea Scout boats in
the Palo Alto yacht harbor. About
ten V-7 students will meet at the
Nitery this Sunday morning at 10
to go sailing.
Don Dillon said that Navy offi
cials would be glad to talk with the
V-7 group regarding special pre
ensign courses, and that the school
administration would probably in
troduce any special courses if enough
students were registered in the V-7
group.
Bud Ambrose, originator of the
V-7 group idea, presided at the
meeting and announced that another
meeting would be held in the Nitery
at 10 o'clock next Wednesday night.
Fie urged all those who attended the
last meeting to bring several V-7
friends with them.
