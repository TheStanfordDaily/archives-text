# Masters Moves to Increase Civilian Defense Efficiency
## 
### 
In a move to increase the effectiveness of Stanford's Civilian Defense
organization for the next school year, Alfred H. Masters, administrator
of the body, announced yesterday that there will probably be a booth
in front of the Administration Building on Fall Quarter registration day
for students to sign up for Civilian Defense work.

Instead of the students turning in-<
their Civilian Defense sign-up cards
at one of the registration desks, they
will turn them in to the special
booth, according to Masters, who
hopes that this procedure will in
crease the number of those signing
up.
"Because the body changes so
often, it is imperative that we get
our civilian defense organization
functioning as soon after registration
day as possible," Mr. Masters said
yesterday. "Our campus must be
able to handle disaster work if and
when the occasion arises, and the
students will be the ones largely re
sponsible for doing the work."
Among the 500 student workers
needed, Masters pointed out, are
200 to 300 auxiliary firemen, 50 to 60
auxiliary policemen, 110 students to
man the three casualty stations, plus
messengers.
The first aid and defense courses
which have been given in recent
quarters will be repeated for Fall
Quarter, the first aid courses offering
from two to three units and the
defense course giving one unit.
