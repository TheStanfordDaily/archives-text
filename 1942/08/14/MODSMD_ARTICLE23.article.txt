Business at the Cellar has gained
in accordance with increased en
rollment this summer. Purchases
have numbered about 500 during the
noon hour alone as "against a usual
300 to 400. according to Miss Chris
tine Ricker, director of dining halls.
The total volume of sales, however,
though greater than in any previous
J summer, cannot be compared with
business during regular quarters.
Ring-ups have averaged over 2,000
per day, but Miss Ricker observes
that 50 to 60 per cent of that num
! ber consisted of 5-eent items.
