## 
### 
One of the greatest problems fol
lowing the war will be the rehabili
tation and readjustment of the mil
lions of soldiers returning to civil
life, Dr. Lewis M. Terman, noted
Stanford psychologist, declared lo
day.
"It will be imperative that the gov
ernment provide some sort of coun
seling service to help men get settled
back into their normal way of liv
ing," Dr. Terman said. "If the war
lasts several years, perhaps half of
the returning men will have been
away from their occupations for so
long that a definite program of voca
tional readjustment will be neces
sary. Most of the other half will have
had no experience in any occupation
but warfare."

"If the catastrophes of the last
war are to be avoided, it will be
necessary to have highly trained men
to give proper vocational guidance
and re-education for peace," the
Stanford psychologist emphasized.

"After the war, vocational coun
j seling in high schools, colleges, and
j industries will be greatly expanded,"
:he predicted. "And because there
J will be more and more old people in
j proportion to young, there will be a
growing need for psychological coun
seling of the elderly—both to pre
vent or correct maladjustments and
to help make their lives more mean
ingful."
