comes a thing of the past. Pub
lishing four days a week during
summer was something new for
The Daily, but it didn't take long
for the staff to learn to condense
»he news to fit a tabloid news
paper. The big trouble will be
in going back to the large size
oaper in Autumn Quarter.
We haven't tried to carry on
any tremendous campaigns.
Most of our criticisms have been
aimed at much needed reforms
in the Cellar. They have been
;n good faith, but to date nothing
has come of them. We hope
'hat the Union will see fit to
make the necessary changes be
fore the overflow crowd hits the
campus next quarter.
But our biggest attempt has
been at the revival of Stanford
•raditions. Many persons have
♦hought this campaign worthless
when we have the more im
oortant job of winning the war.
But our theory behind these re
vivals has been: if a student
~an't co-operate in little matters
:>f school traditions, how can he
be expected to co-operate in big
orograms which affect the entire
nation?
And so we are still crowded
'or space during the 8 a.m.
breakfast rush, and we are "kept
in line" by a chain at the cash
ier's office in the Cellar, and we
are still walking to Paly and we
are still smoking in the Quad,
but you can't get things done
unless you talk about them, and
there has been plenty of talk
'his quarter.
We kept the war and a vic
tory for the United Nations first
; n our thoughts. We set a new
record in buying War Stamps
and Bonds, and we finally began
'o get together in the co-opera
tive driving sign-up. We had a
successful Victory Day which
oroved to outsiders that Stan
ford is not really a country club,
despite opinion to the contrary.
And we kept our entertain
ment on the campus. Tires and
gas are really precious items
now. We collected a lot of scrap
rubber for Uncle Sam's victory.
So, we have done much for our
selves and the country, but
there is a lot we can do next
quarter and every other quarter
until victory is ours.

there has been plenty of talk
'his quarter.
We kept the war and a vic
tory for the United Nations first
; n our thoughts. We set a new
record in buying War Stamps
and Bonds, and we finally began
'o get together in the co-opera
tive driving sign-up. We had a
successful Victory Day which
oroved to outsiders that Stan
ford is not really a country club,
despite opinion to the contrary.
And we kept our entertain
ment on the campus. Tires and
gas are really precious items
now. We collected a lot of scrap
rubber for Uncle Sam's victory.
So, we have done much for our
selves and the country, but
there is a lot we can do next
quarter and every other quarter
until victory is ours.
TATITH this issue The Sum
» V mer Daily for 1942 be
comes a thing of the past. Pub
lishing four days a week during
summer was something new for
The Daily, but it didn't take long
for the staff to learn to condense
»he news to fit a tabloid news
paper. The big trouble will be
in going back to the large size
oaper in Autumn Quarter.
We haven't tried to carry on
any tremendous campaigns.
Most of our criticisms have been
aimed at much needed reforms
in the Cellar. They have been
;n good faith, but to date nothing
has come of them. We hope
'hat the Union will see fit to
make the necessary changes be
fore the overflow crowd hits the
campus next quarter.
But our biggest attempt has
been at the revival of Stanford
•raditions. Many persons have
♦hought this campaign worthless
when we have the more im
oortant job of winning the war.
But our theory behind these re
vivals has been: if a student
~an't co-operate in little matters
:>f school traditions, how can he
be expected to co-operate in big
orograms which affect the entire
nation?
And so we are still crowded
'or space during the 8 a.m.
breakfast rush, and we are "kept
in line" by a chain at the cash
ier's office in the Cellar, and we
are still walking to Paly and we
are still smoking in the Quad,
but you can't get things done
unless you talk about them, and
