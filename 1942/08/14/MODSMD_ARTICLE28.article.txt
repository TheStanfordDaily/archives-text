### BILL STEIF 
'OMES now the end of Steif's
' brief sojourn in this column. In
ternationally speaking, it has not
been a pleasant summer. We—and
when I say "we" I mean the United
; Natiorls—have had some rough go
ing. The going is still rough and
probably will keep that way for a
long time. We cannot see our road
to victory open for quite a while. I
, do not say this because I am of na
ture pessimistic but because this
seems the most realistic viewpoint to
! take.

We absorbed a shellacking that
was almost fatal in Egypt.
We have absorbed and still are
absorbing a whipping in Southern
Russia.
* * *
■ have been minor defeats in
China, we have lost some of our
Navy, we have lost the strategically
important tip of the Aleutians. India
still has not definitely come to the
side of the United Nations, because,
perhaps, the British policy in India
has been a little too pig-headed and
not quite intelligent enough. These
have all been on the negative side
of the balance this summer.
But there are bright aspects to
flic situation. Our offensive action
in the Solomon Islands is a happy
idea, even if it is costly and not
wholly successful. The ever-in
creasing air dominance of the RAF
over Europe presages a Second
Front which is still nebulous and
probably will not become concrete
until next spring or summer but
which is, nevertheless, more and
more a better bet. The increasing
power of the American Air Force
throughout the world is a good
sign. And, perhaps even more im
portant. back here in the United
States I think more and more peo
ple are finally waking up to the
possibility that we can be beaten.
This, I believe, is reflected in the
general public's rising indignation
concerning Washington bureau
cracy. by Henry Kaiser's novel and
perhaps brilliant solution for the
submarine menace, by the hun
dreds of ideas which poured into
the Capitol for the creation of syn
thetic rubber, by the ever-rising
curve of our war production.
These are good signs, but we -must
still realize that the war is going to
be long, that many of us are going to
die before it is through (a worth
while sacrifice), that we shall never
be able to go back to our giddy un
controlled economy of the 1920's and
1930'5.
Ted Norton takes this spot at the
beginning of next quarter. He is a
good man and will do a good job.
Thank you who have managed to
wade through this stuff this summer
—and Ted. I hope you can be more
and more optimistic next fall.

These are good signs, but we -must
still realize that the war is going to
be long, that many of us are going to
die before it is through (a worth
while sacrifice), that we shall never
be able to go back to our giddy un
controlled economy of the 1920's and
1930'5.
Ted Norton takes this spot at the
beginning of next quarter. He is a
good man and will do a good job.
Thank you who have managed to
wade through this stuff this summer
—and Ted. I hope you can be more
and more optimistic next fall.
'OMES now the end of Steif's
' brief sojourn in this column. In
ternationally speaking, it has not
been a pleasant summer. We—and
when I say "we" I mean the United
; Natiorls—have had some rough go
ing. The going is still rough and
probably will keep that way for a
long time. We cannot see our road
to victory open for quite a while. I
, do not say this because I am of na
ture pessimistic but because this
seems the most realistic viewpoint to
! take.

We absorbed a shellacking that
was almost fatal in Egypt.
We have absorbed and still are
absorbing a whipping in Southern
Russia.

■ have been minor defeats in
China, we have lost some of our
Navy, we have lost the strategically
important tip of the Aleutians. India
still has not definitely come to the
side of the United Nations, because,
perhaps, the British policy in India
has been a little too pig-headed and
not quite intelligent enough. These
have all been on the negative side
of the balance this summer.
But there are bright aspects to
flic situation. Our offensive action
in the Solomon Islands is a happy
idea, even if it is costly and not
wholly successful. The ever-in
creasing air dominance of the RAF
over Europe presages a Second
Front which is still nebulous and
probably will not become concrete
until next spring or summer but
which is, nevertheless, more and
more a better bet. The increasing
power of the American Air Force
throughout the world is a good
sign. And, perhaps even more im
portant. back here in the United
States I think more and more peo
ple are finally waking up to the
possibility that we can be beaten.
This, I believe, is reflected in the
general public's rising indignation
concerning Washington bureau
cracy. by Henry Kaiser's novel and
perhaps brilliant solution for the
submarine menace, by the hun
dreds of ideas which poured into
the Capitol for the creation of syn
thetic rubber, by the ever-rising
curve of our war production.
