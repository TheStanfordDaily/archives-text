HUSKY MOVIES
It will be remembered that the
famous Stanford Cinderella team
had unexpectedly won six games in
a row, when it encountered the only
other unbeaten team on the Coast,
the University of Washington, for
the virtual PCC championship.
The situation just before the turn
of the tide stood thus: the third quar
ter was two-thirds over, Standlee
was injured, Washington was lead
ing 10-0 and had the ball on the
Stanford 30. Whereupon the rooters
"gave 'em the axe" in the loudest
organized yell of the year.
IvMET SENSATIONAL
Chuck Taylor stopped cold three
different Husky backs in succession,
! and Stanford took over on downs;
when presently Kmetovic went over
for a touchdown on a 55-yard pass
play; a fast campaign scored again;
and then Kmetovic made a sensa
tional interception and outran the
whole Husky team to a third touch
down for a 20-10 Stanford win.
