Freshmen Aren't
Dumb
I
They know a lot and arc willing to learn. But they can't
learn everything at once.
Upperclassmen, for example, know from experience
that it's easy to save three-fourths of the cost of their
books by buying them downtown on Emerson Street at
College Book Shop, and then selling them back to College
Book Shop when they've finished with them. (A four dol
lar book can be bought for three and sold back at two.)
But Freshmen are busy people. They may not know an
old farmer to tell them, before they've spent all that
money on new texts, that College Book Shop is just
around the corner from Montgomery Wards.
And so we have to advertise. They say it pays.
