# An Improved Encina Hall Greets '16'
## Rooms Rebuilt, New Furnishings Added, According to Sharp 
### 
Entering male freshmen of the
Class of '4G will find that their home
for their freshman year has under
gone some new improvements. The
dormitory that has served Stanford
students for the past fifty years has
undergone extensive alterations dur
ing the Summer Quarter.
Improvements amounting to $30,-
000 have converted the majority of
the rooms on the third and fourth
floors of the east wing into highly
desirable and improved modern liv
ing quarters. Of course the new en
tering freshmen won't know the En
cina of old, but upper division men
and members of the class of '45 cer
tainly ought to appreciate the new
Encina.
Each of the rooms has been en
tirely rebuilt according to Stanley
L. Sharp, director of men's resi
dences. Among the improvements
are built-in wardrobe closets which
divide the rooms into two sections, a
sleeping room and a study room.
OFFICE-TYPE DESKS
Included in the new furnishings
will be office-type desks, straight
chairs, beds and mattresses. Soft
wood floors have been replaced by
hardwood floors and sturdy but im
practical washstands have been re
placed by modern basins.
Perhaps the most impressive thing
to Encina alumni who return to view
the new rooms will be the absence
of the naked light globe hanging
from the middle of the ceiling. This
scourge of Encinamen has been re
placed by a central lighting fixture,
with floor outlets placed strategically
around the baseboards.
All the improvements have not
been confined to the individual
rooms, however. The clubroom has
also been done over. Changes also
include new fluorescent lighting fix
tures, the addition of "Charles of
London" type chairs, the reuphol
stering of all the old sofas, ash trays,
a new trophy case, and entirely new
paint job.
BURNS REMOVED
The scars on the floor left from
countless generations of cigarettes
have been removed and the floor re
varnished.
Finishing date for all the remod
eling was the last of Summer Quar
ter. Open house will be held at
the beginning of this Autumn Quar
ter and all students, old ones as
well as new ones, are invited to at
tend the opening of the new En
cina.

Each of the rooms has been en
tirely rebuilt according to Stanley
L. Sharp, director of men's resi
dences. Among the improvements
are built-in wardrobe closets which
divide the rooms into two sections, a
sleeping room and a study room.
OFFICE-TYPE DESKS
Included in the new furnishings
will be office-type desks, straight
chairs, beds and mattresses. Soft
wood floors have been replaced by
hardwood floors and sturdy but im
practical washstands have been re
placed by modern basins.
Perhaps the most impressive thing
to Encina alumni who return to view
the new rooms will be the absence
of the naked light globe hanging
from the middle of the ceiling. This
scourge of Encinamen has been re
placed by a central lighting fixture,
with floor outlets placed strategically
around the baseboards.
All the improvements have not
been confined to the individual
rooms, however. The clubroom has
also been done over. Changes also
include new fluorescent lighting fix
tures, the addition of "Charles of
London" type chairs, the reuphol
stering of all the old sofas, ash trays,
a new trophy case, and entirely new
paint job.
BURNS REMOVED
The scars on the floor left from
countless generations of cigarettes
have been removed and the floor re
varnished.
Finishing date for all the remod
eling was the last of Summer Quar
ter. Open house will be held at
the beginning of this Autumn Quar
ter and all students, old ones as
well as new ones, are invited to at
tend the opening of the new En
cina.
Entering male freshmen of the
Class of '4G will find that their home
for their freshman year has under
gone some new improvements. The
dormitory that has served Stanford
students for the past fifty years has
undergone extensive alterations dur
ing the Summer Quarter.
Improvements amounting to $30,-
000 have converted the majority of
the rooms on the third and fourth
floors of the east wing into highly
desirable and improved modern liv
ing quarters. Of course the new en
tering freshmen won't know the En
cina of old, but upper division men
and members of the class of '45 cer
tainly ought to appreciate the new
Encina.
