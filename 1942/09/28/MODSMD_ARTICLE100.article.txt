# GARDINAL-W.S.C. DUEL STANDS 50-50
## Backfield Question Mark Behind Solid Forward Wall 
### BOB SONTAG 
It's just a gamble.
And the odds can swing either way when Marchie Schwartz sends his wartime football
team against Babe Hollingbery's Washington State Cougars Sept. 26 in the opening clash
of the Pacific Coast Conference at the Stanford Stadium.
The Redskins have a "tackle to tackle" team and three potent backfield men to count
on—the remainder of the team is an unknown quantity and quality after two weeks of
practice.
That "tackle to tackle" forward wall is Ed Stamm and Bruno Banducci, tackles; Chuck
Taylor and Loren LaPrade, guards, and Milt Vucinich, center. Those three potent backs
are Ray Hammett, quarter; Buck Fawcett, full, and Bill Sheller, right half.

Eric "Hoot" Armstrong, who un
doubtedly would have been the
fourth man in the "T" offense, is
ineligible and at this writing has only
the slimmest chance of being in uni
form when the Cards and Cougars
bump heads in the 1942 curtain
raiser. Although Armstrong played
right half last year, he probably
would have been shifted to left half.

Right now Don Zappettini is play
the first-string left half position.
Piedmont "Zapp" was a fullback on
the freshman squad last year but
was turned into a half with the job
of succeeding Pete Kmetovic.
Vucinich, the "Slashing Slav" i:i
slaving at center for sure, but yes
terday he worked at quarterback,
of all positions—and did a fine job
of passing and ball handling. Ham
mett is still the No. 1 quarter, but
Schwartz has no compunction about
throwing Vucinich in the breech
should Ray be injured.
RESERVES STRONG
Andrews has shown ability to pa; :.,
but both he and CafTall are young
and need experience.
Hank Norberg and Roger Laverly
are slated to handle the end spots
with Dave Brown not far behind.
Brown will be able to play either
one equally well. He showed up
well in spring practice and will be
seen aplenty this year. Bob Hall,
Pete August, Bill Brubaker, Sandy
Banks, and Don Wallace make up
the other reserve ends.
Back to the stonewall forwards,

foot in tackling practice and was
declared out of the opening game
with Washington Slate.
there are enough good second and
third stringers to keep the Stanford
front strength A-l all day long.
At center is one of the finest pros
pects Stanford has. He's Charles
Wakefield, burly 247-pounder, who
transferred to the Farm from Bakers
field J.C. Wakefield will shed some
of that excess before the season be
gins, but he's running almost fast
enough now to suit the Card coach
ing staff. Darwin Seeley, Tony Med
ved, and dropkicker Tyler Norton
fill out the pivotmen.
Norton spends much of his time
booting 'em through the goal posts
from as far as 35 yards, which means
he'll be good for three points now
and then.
FIVE GOOD TACKLES
Five good tackles will keep Bruno
biting and Stamm hitting. They're
Fred Boensch, 6 feet 3 and 220
pounds of San Matean power; Jim
Cox, who's seen experience on the
varsity; Moose Mannon, also re
turning; Jack Monteverde, rugby
letterman, and Bill Young, outstand
ing lineman from the frosh.
Guarding behind the two stal
warts LaPrade and Taylor are Ed
McCain and Dave Patterson, a
squatty pair that can grind in and
stick.
The backfield presents the big
question mark of Stanford's fall cam
paign. Aside from the three afore
mentioned, Sheller, Fawcett, and
Hammett, no one appears to have
quite the experience to be called
solid material.
MANY HALFBACKS
Schwartz has halfbacks, lots of
'em, but five are sophs, and that
means work and learn. At right half
are Al Hoisch, the speedy little
sprinter who pushed Jim Pettit to a
9.9 hundred in the Little Big track
meet last spring, and Ross Dana
brother of Jack, the basketball man
Over at left are Fred Sanderman
another Papoose trackman of lasl
year; Larry Dee, who by now has
entered almost every sport knowr
to man; Ben Morrison, the hand
some one who played against U.S.F
last year, and John Eliel, up frorr
the frosh.
At fullback are Bob Frisbee, Sac
ramento J.C. transfer and Art Ship
key, nephew of assistant coach
Harry Shipkey. Frisbee has showr
ability as a passer, while Shipkey
a very muscular lad, can tote the
ball well on running plays.
PETTIT MISSED
The man most sorely missed or
the squad is Jim Pettit, who was be
ing groomed to take over left half
back. He was rated all-America!
material by almost every coast coacl
and writer. A bid from Annapoli:
came during the summer, however
and Pettit is there now and wil
probably play ball for the Navy.
At best the Cougar-Stanford garm
must be called a 50-50 proposition
Schwartz doesn't know much abou
Washington State. Nobody docs, a:

a matter of fact. The fact that every
one wants to know is whether Jay
Stoves and Bob Kennedy arc eli
gible or not?
STOVES OUESTIONABLE
The pair are the outstanding backs
on Babe Hollingbery's team, and both
up for Athertonizing because they
competed in A.A.U. basketball, which
would rule them out by coast con
ference regulations.
Should anything happen to Ham
mett, Stanford may be stuck in a
deep hole that it could never pull
out of. Schwartz says Hammett may
be as good as Frankie Albert, be
cause of his added ability along
blocking lines. Albert was also a
great blocker, but Hammett's height
and largeness seem to favor him in
that department.
It's just a gamble.

there are enough good second and
third stringers to keep the Stanford
front strength A-l all day long.
At center is one of the finest pros
pects Stanford has. He's Charles
Wakefield, burly 247-pounder, who
transferred to the Farm from Bakers
field J.C. Wakefield will shed some
of that excess before the season be
gins, but he's running almost fast
enough now to suit the Card coach
ing staff. Darwin Seeley, Tony Med
ved, and dropkicker Tyler Norton
fill out the pivotmen.
Norton spends much of his time
booting 'em through the goal posts
from as far as 35 yards, which means
he'll be good for three points now
and then.
FIVE GOOD TACKLES
Five good tackles will keep Bruno
biting and Stamm hitting. They're
Fred Boensch, 6 feet 3 and 220
pounds of San Matean power; Jim
Cox, who's seen experience on the
varsity; Moose Mannon, also re
turning; Jack Monteverde, rugby
letterman, and Bill Young, outstand
ing lineman from the frosh.
Guarding behind the two stal
warts LaPrade and Taylor are Ed
McCain and Dave Patterson, a
squatty pair that can grind in and
stick.
The backfield presents the big
question mark of Stanford's fall cam
paign. Aside from the three afore
mentioned, Sheller, Fawcett, and
Hammett, no one appears to have
quite the experience to be called
solid material.
MANY HALFBACKS
Schwartz has halfbacks, lots of
'em, but five are sophs, and that
means work and learn. At right half
are Al Hoisch, the speedy little
sprinter who pushed Jim Pettit to a
9.9 hundred in the Little Big track
meet last spring, and Ross Dana
brother of Jack, the basketball man
Over at left are Fred Sanderman
another Papoose trackman of lasl
year; Larry Dee, who by now has
entered almost every sport knowr
to man; Ben Morrison, the hand
some one who played against U.S.F
last year, and John Eliel, up frorr
the frosh.
At fullback are Bob Frisbee, Sac
ramento J.C. transfer and Art Ship
key, nephew of assistant coach
Harry Shipkey. Frisbee has showr
ability as a passer, while Shipkey
a very muscular lad, can tote the
ball well on running plays.
PETTIT MISSED

the squad is Jim Pettit, who was be
ing groomed to take over left half
back. He was rated all-America!
material by almost every coast coacl
and writer. A bid from Annapoli:
came during the summer, however
and Pettit is there now and wil
probably play ball for the Navy.
At best the Cougar-Stanford garm
must be called a 50-50 proposition
Schwartz doesn't know much abou
Washington State. Nobody docs, a:

a matter of fact. The fact that every
one wants to know is whether Jay
Stoves and Bob Kennedy arc eli
gible or not?
STOVES OUESTIONABLE
The pair are the outstanding backs
on Babe Hollingbery's team, and both
up for Athertonizing because they
competed in A.A.U. basketball, which
would rule them out by coast con
ference regulations.
Should anything happen to Ham
mett, Stanford may be stuck in a
deep hole that it could never pull
out of. Schwartz says Hammett may
be as good as Frankie Albert, be
cause of his added ability along
blocking lines. Albert was also a
great blocker, but Hammett's height
and largeness seem to favor him in
that department.
It's just a gamble.
And the odds can swing either way when Marchie Schwartz sends his wartime football
team against Babe Hollingbery's Washington State Cougars Sept. 26 in the opening clash
of the Pacific Coast Conference at the Stanford Stadium.
The Redskins have a "tackle to tackle" team and three potent backfield men to count
on—the remainder of the team is an unknown quantity and quality after two weeks of
practice.
That "tackle to tackle" forward wall is Ed Stamm and Bruno Banducci, tackles; Chuck
Taylor and Loren LaPrade, guards, and Milt Vucinich, center. Those three potent backs
are Ray Hammett, quarter; Buck Fawcett, full, and Bill Sheller, right half.

Eric "Hoot" Armstrong, who un
doubtedly would have been the
fourth man in the "T" offense, is
ineligible and at this writing has only
the slimmest chance of being in uni
form when the Cards and Cougars
bump heads in the 1942 curtain
raiser. Although Armstrong played
right half last year, he probably
would have been shifted to left half.

Right now Don Zappettini is play

third stringers to keep the Stanford
front strength A-l all day long.
At center is one of the finest pros
pects Stanford has. He's Charles
Wakefield, burly 247-pounder, who
transferred to the Farm from Bakers
field J.C. Wakefield will shed some
of that excess before the season be
gins, but he's running almost fast
enough now to suit the Card coach
ing staff. Darwin Seeley, Tony Med
ved, and dropkicker Tyler Norton
fill out the pivotmen.
Norton spends much of his time
booting 'em through the goal posts
from as far as 35 yards, which means
he'll be good for three points now
and then.
FIVE GOOD TACKLES
Five good tackles will keep Bruno
biting and Stamm hitting. They're
Fred Boensch, 6 feet 3 and 220
pounds of San Matean power; Jim
Cox, who's seen experience on the
varsity; Moose Mannon, also re
turning; Jack Monteverde, rugby
letterman, and Bill Young, outstand
ing lineman from the frosh.
Guarding behind the two stal
warts LaPrade and Taylor are Ed
McCain and Dave Patterson, a
squatty pair that can grind in and
stick.
The backfield presents the big
question mark of Stanford's fall cam
paign. Aside from the three afore
mentioned, Sheller, Fawcett, and
Hammett, no one appears to have
quite the experience to be called
solid material.
MANY HALFBACKS
Schwartz has halfbacks, lots of
'em, but five are sophs, and that
means work and learn. At right half
are Al Hoisch, the speedy little
sprinter who pushed Jim Pettit to a
9.9 hundred in the Little Big track
meet last spring, and Ross Dana
brother of Jack, the basketball man
Over at left are Fred Sanderman
another Papoose trackman of lasl
year; Larry Dee, who by now has
entered almost every sport knowr
to man; Ben Morrison, the hand
some one who played against U.S.F
last year, and John Eliel, up frorr
the frosh.
At fullback are Bob Frisbee, Sac
ramento J.C. transfer and Art Ship
key, nephew of assistant coach
Harry Shipkey. Frisbee has showr
ability as a passer, while Shipkey
a very muscular lad, can tote the
ball well on running plays.
PETTIT MISSED
The man most sorely missed or
the squad is Jim Pettit, who was be
ing groomed to take over left half
back. He was rated all-America!
material by almost every coast coacl
and writer. A bid from Annapoli:
came during the summer, however
and Pettit is there now and wil
probably play ball for the Navy.
At best the Cougar-Stanford garm
must be called a 50-50 proposition
Schwartz doesn't know much abou
Washington State. Nobody docs, a:

a matter of fact. The fact that every
one wants to know is whether Jay
Stoves and Bob Kennedy arc eli
gible or not?
STOVES OUESTIONABLE
The pair are the outstanding backs
on Babe Hollingbery's team, and both
up for Athertonizing because they
competed in A.A.U. basketball, which
would rule them out by coast con
ference regulations.
Should anything happen to Ham
mett, Stanford may be stuck in a
deep hole that it could never pull
out of. Schwartz says Hammett may
be as good as Frankie Albert, be
cause of his added ability along
blocking lines. Albert was also a
great blocker, but Hammett's height
and largeness seem to favor him in
that department.
It's just a gamble.
And the odds can swing either way when Marchie Schwartz sends his wartime football
team against Babe Hollingbery's Washington State Cougars Sept. 26 in the opening clash
of the Pacific Coast Conference at the Stanford Stadium.
The Redskins have a "tackle to tackle" team and three potent backfield men to count
on—the remainder of the team is an unknown quantity and quality after two weeks of
practice.
That "tackle to tackle" forward wall is Ed Stamm and Bruno Banducci, tackles; Chuck
Taylor and Loren LaPrade, guards, and Milt Vucinich, center. Those three potent backs
are Ray Hammett, quarter; Buck Fawcett, full, and Bill Sheller, right half.

Eric "Hoot" Armstrong, who un
doubtedly would have been the
fourth man in the "T" offense, is
ineligible and at this writing has only
the slimmest chance of being in uni
form when the Cards and Cougars
bump heads in the 1942 curtain
raiser. Although Armstrong played
right half last year, he probably
would have been shifted to left half.

Right now Don Zappettini is play
the first-string left half position.
Piedmont "Zapp" was a fullback on
the freshman squad last year but
was turned into a half with the job
of succeeding Pete Kmetovic.
Vucinich, the "Slashing Slav" i:i
slaving at center for sure, but yes
terday he worked at quarterback,
of all positions—and did a fine job
of passing and ball handling. Ham
mett is still the No. 1 quarter, but
Schwartz has no compunction about

should Ray be injured.
RESERVES STRONG
Andrews has shown ability to pa; :.,
but both he and CafTall are young
and need experience.
Hank Norberg and Roger Laverly
are slated to handle the end spots
with Dave Brown not far behind.
Brown will be able to play either
one equally well. He showed up
well in spring practice and will be
seen aplenty this year. Bob Hall,
Pete August, Bill Brubaker, Sandy
Banks, and Don Wallace make up
the other reserve ends.

question mark of Stanford's fall cam
paign. Aside from the three afore
mentioned, Sheller, Fawcett, and
Hammett, no one appears to have
quite the experience to be called
solid material.
MANY HALFBACKS
Schwartz has halfbacks, lots of
'em, but five are sophs, and that
means work and learn. At right half
are Al Hoisch, the speedy little
sprinter who pushed Jim Pettit to a
9.9 hundred in the Little Big track
meet last spring, and Ross Dana
brother of Jack, the basketball man
Over at left are Fred Sanderman
another Papoose trackman of lasl
year; Larry Dee, who by now has
entered almost every sport knowr
to man; Ben Morrison, the hand
some one who played against U.S.F
last year, and John Eliel, up frorr
the frosh.
At fullback are Bob Frisbee, Sac
ramento J.C. transfer and Art Ship
key, nephew of assistant coach
Harry Shipkey. Frisbee has showr
ability as a passer, while Shipkey
a very muscular lad, can tote the
ball well on running plays.
PETTIT MISSED
The man most sorely missed or
the squad is Jim Pettit, who was be
ing groomed to take over left half
back. He was rated all-America!
material by almost every coast coacl
and writer. A bid from Annapoli:
came during the summer, however
and Pettit is there now and wil
probably play ball for the Navy.
At best the Cougar-Stanford garm
must be called a 50-50 proposition
Schwartz doesn't know much abou
Washington State. Nobody docs, a:

a matter of fact. The fact that every
one wants to know is whether Jay
Stoves and Bob Kennedy arc eli
gible or not?
STOVES OUESTIONABLE
The pair are the outstanding backs
on Babe Hollingbery's team, and both
up for Athertonizing because they
competed in A.A.U. basketball, which
would rule them out by coast con
ference regulations.
Should anything happen to Ham
mett, Stanford may be stuck in a
deep hole that it could never pull
out of. Schwartz says Hammett may
be as good as Frankie Albert, be
cause of his added ability along
blocking lines. Albert was also a
great blocker, but Hammett's height
and largeness seem to favor him in
that department.
