# GARDINAL-W.S.C. DUEL STANDS 50-50
## Backfield Question Mark Behind Solid Forward Wall 
### BOB SONTAG 
It's just a gamble.
And the odds can swing either way when Marchie Schwartz sends his wartime football
team against Babe Hollingbery's Washington State Cougars Sept. 26 in the opening clash
of the Pacific Coast Conference at the Stanford Stadium.
The Redskins have a "tackle to tackle" team and three potent backfield men to count
on—the remainder of the team is an unknown quantity and quality after two weeks of
practice.
That "tackle to tackle" forward wall is Ed Stamm and Bruno Banducci, tackles; Chuck
Taylor and Loren LaPrade, guards, and Milt Vucinich, center. Those three potent backs
are Ray Hammett, quarter; Buck Fawcett, full, and Bill Sheller, right half.

Eric "Hoot" Armstrong, who un
doubtedly would have been the
fourth man in the "T" offense, is
ineligible and at this writing has only
the slimmest chance of being in uni
form when the Cards and Cougars
bump heads in the 1942 curtain
raiser. Although Armstrong played
right half last year, he probably
would have been shifted to left half.

Right now Don Zappettini is play
the first-string left half position.
Piedmont "Zapp" was a fullback on
the freshman squad last year but
was turned into a half with the job
of succeeding Pete Kmetovic.
Vucinich, the "Slashing Slav" i:i
slaving at center for sure, but yes
terday he worked at quarterback,
of all positions—and did a fine job
of passing and ball handling. Ham
mett is still the No. 1 quarter, but
Schwartz has no compunction about
throwing Vucinich in the breech
should Ray be injured.
RESERVES STRONG
Andrews has shown ability to pa; :.,
but both he and CafTall are young
and need experience.
Hank Norberg and Roger Laverly
are slated to handle the end spots
with Dave Brown not far behind.
Brown will be able to play either
one equally well. He showed up
well in spring practice and will be
seen aplenty this year. Bob Hall,
Pete August, Bill Brubaker, Sandy
Banks, and Don Wallace make up
the other reserve ends.
Back to the stonewall forwards,

STANFORD UNIVERSITY, Sep
tember 17—Bruno Banducci, vet
eran right tackle, pulled a joint
muscle in the instep of his right
foot in tackling practice and was
declared out of the opening game
with Washington Slate.
