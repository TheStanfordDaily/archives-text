# Jim Pollard's Loss Dims Cage Hopes
## Veterans, Sophomores Boost Harriers Hope; Johnson Sees Comeback 
### ED CONN 
Sparked by the return of veterans Ed Stamm. Don Reiss, Bob Comp
ton, VVillard Smith, and Buek Fawcett; plus the accession of last year's
freshman "greats," the varsity track team is well 011 its way to justify its
rating as one of Stanford's foremost sports squads irrespective of its
relapse the last two years due to a shortage of material.
"While during the war period," commented Coach "Pitch" Johnson,

'there may not be as many out
standing performances on the coast
:is in past years, we will be no worse
riff than the other schools in this
respect and we figure to hold our
own with the teams we usually
meet."
How does Johnson justify his
statement? Just look:
Sorting off in the weights there's
Ed Slamm, who won the Big Meet
shot put last year with a heave of
52 feet 5 inches after only a week
and a half of practice. Backing up
Slamm in both the shot and discus
will be Ed Voss, center on Everett
Dt an's national championship bas
kei ball team; Art Shipkey, a mus
cuhr transfer from New Mexico;
;kI freshman Bob Henry, who'll be
< !i ible Spring Quarter.
SMiTII HIGH JUMPS
Willard Smith, who tied for first
in the high jump against California
at 6:3. will be pressed by Jim Kresl,
Ed Voss, Jack Flammer, and Don
Landale, all of whom have cleared
six feet.
Junior A1 Pande is the leading
j; velin tosser with a best throw of
186.3, whereas A1 Hoisch's 24.3
iiiatlc in the broad jump marks him
as a standout in that event. John
.s >n claims, however, he will have
to bank upon new transfers, Ben
Herrick and Bob Hart, to carry on
the pole vault honors.
Veterans Don Reiss and Glenn
Neilsen will be greatly pushed in
both hurdles by Bill Ritter, a trans
it "i - from Whittier. Reiss' best time
last year as a sophomore was 14.9
in the highs and 24.2 in the lows.
DASHES OKEH
Al Hoisch, "Buck" Fawcett, and
Floyd Cuff will ably handle the 100
and 220—a1l having done 10 flat or
better in the century. In the quar
ter (here's Bruce Meyer and Bob
Sears, who did 49.6 as freshman last
year, plus Dick Ambrose, Jim Doty,
and Ralph Shafferzick, whom John
son expects to go well under 50 sec
onds.
Leading middle distance man un
doubtedly is John Fulton, last year's
freshman star who ran the second
fastest 880 on the coast, 1:54.7, in
winning the Pacific Association title
from Thelmo Knowles, San Jose
Slate's negro flash. Wayne Girdner,
a transfer from Chapman College,
and George Grimes round out the
880 event men.
COMPTON IN THE MILE
Long, lanky Bob Compton leads
the long distance runners, who in
clude Larry Grey, unbeaten frosh
miler and two miler last year, Dave
Bills, Bill Eberle, Bob Raitt, and
Dave Kimbol. Compton's best in the
mile last year was 4:24.7.
As to fall track practice," John
son concluded, "I urge all freshmen
who have had any track experience
at all or who aspire to a track career
at college to report on opening day
and take track as part of your phys
ical education requirement."
The fall track program this year
is much more expensive than ever
before, including cross - country
meets with California, San Francisco
State, and San Jose State for which
freshmen are eligible, three or four
intramural meets plus an all-fresh
man meet, and possibly track meets
with other schools.
