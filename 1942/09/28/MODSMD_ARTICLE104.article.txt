# Squad Clipped: Stars Burness, Cowden Lost
## 
### 
Don Burness, Bill Cowden, and
Jim Pollard, magic names in Stan
ford's basketball grand slam sweep
to the N.C.C.A. championship, will
be missing from the lineup next
month when Coach Everett Dean
calls together the remnants of a titu
lar squad.
Burness is wing commander of
the "Flying Indians," Stanford's own
flying cadet unit now training at
Livermore, and Cowden is connected
with Pan-American Airways at
Treasure Island. Both were gradu
ated in June.
Pollard, the tall one, went out on
eligibility, and with him went
Stanford's chance to at least have a
great team before the cage season
starts.
"Jim would have played even bet
ter ball this year," said Dean yes
terday.
LUISETTI COMPLEX
Last year Jim always had that
Luisetti complex against him. He
was raised on a pinnacle of press
clippings that made, him the new
Luisetti. And that pressure was al
ways against him. In every game
he was expected to be the high
scorer, and in trying too hard, he
could not possibly meet that test.
Pollard was not a great shot. He
was strictly one of natural ability,
which kept him superb in all de
partments of the game.
Lanky Jim was the flashiest play
er on the court An many a game, yet
he could be cool as an iceberg the
next minute. His loss puts the Red
skins in a mediocre position for the
coming season, which includes a
game against the Great Lakes Naval
Station in the Sugar Bowl for Army-
Navy Relief.
COAST HARD HIT
Every team on the coast was hit
pretty hard by the draft, graduation,
and enlistment, except Southern
California, where Julie Bescos will
be better off than most of the south- !
ern division squads.
For Stanford, an early first string
five would be composed of Jack
Dana, Howie Dallmar, Ed Voss,
Freddie Linari, and Fred Oliver.
Two other members of last year's
team also in the fold are Bill Hooper
and Johnny Eikelman, with frosh
candidates Dave Brown and Bob Hall
outstanding candidates.
PRACTICE TILTS
Stanford will have no Christmas
practice tour as in pre-war years,
but will top its off-season splurge
against the sailor boys at the big
relief show in New Orleans on De
cember 30. A squad of 10 will prob
ably make the trip.
The Redskins open this year's
defending championship with a
doubleheader at California meeting
the St. Mary's Pre-Flight School,
while California and Santa Clara
tangle in the second game.
Stanford opens its conference sea
son as defending Pacific Coast champ
against Southern California here
January 8 and 9.

ated in June.
Pollard, the tall one, went out on
eligibility, and with him went
Stanford's chance to at least have a
great team before the cage season
starts.
"Jim would have played even bet
ter ball this year," said Dean yes
terday.
LUISETTI COMPLEX
Last year Jim always had that
Luisetti complex against him. He
was raised on a pinnacle of press
clippings that made, him the new
Luisetti. And that pressure was al
ways against him. In every game
he was expected to be the high
scorer, and in trying too hard, he
could not possibly meet that test.
Pollard was not a great shot. He
was strictly one of natural ability,
which kept him superb in all de
partments of the game.
Lanky Jim was the flashiest play
er on the court An many a game, yet
he could be cool as an iceberg the
next minute. His loss puts the Red
skins in a mediocre position for the
coming season, which includes a
game against the Great Lakes Naval
Station in the Sugar Bowl for Army-
Navy Relief.
COAST HARD HIT
Every team on the coast was hit
pretty hard by the draft, graduation,
and enlistment, except Southern
California, where Julie Bescos will
be better off than most of the south- !
ern division squads.
For Stanford, an early first string
five would be composed of Jack
Dana, Howie Dallmar, Ed Voss,
Freddie Linari, and Fred Oliver.
Two other members of last year's
team also in the fold are Bill Hooper
and Johnny Eikelman, with frosh
candidates Dave Brown and Bob Hall
outstanding candidates.
PRACTICE TILTS
Stanford will have no Christmas
practice tour as in pre-war years,
but will top its off-season splurge
against the sailor boys at the big
relief show in New Orleans on De
cember 30. A squad of 10 will prob
ably make the trip.
The Redskins open this year's
defending championship with a
doubleheader at California meeting
the St. Mary's Pre-Flight School,
while California and Santa Clara
tangle in the second game.
Stanford opens its conference sea
son as defending Pacific Coast champ
against Southern California here
January 8 and 9.

is at the upper right-hand corner

JIM POLLARD
Don Burness, Bill Cowden, and
Jim Pollard, magic names in Stan
ford's basketball grand slam sweep
to the N.C.C.A. championship, will
be missing from the lineup next
month when Coach Everett Dean
calls together the remnants of a titu
lar squad.
Burness is wing commander of
the "Flying Indians," Stanford's own
flying cadet unit now training at
Livermore, and Cowden is connected
with Pan-American Airways at
Treasure Island. Both were gradu
ated in June.
Pollard, the tall one, went out on
