# Soccermen Open Oct. 10 With U.S.F.
## 
### BOB FISHER 
Stealing some of the spotlight from
the coming football contests will be
the Fall Quarter soccer season which
opens October 10 with a fracas on
the home field with U.S.F.
Coach Hurry Moloney's Cardinal
soccer players will be out to defend
the conierence championship which
they won last season and also to
keep intact the unbeaten record
which they maintained last fall.
VETERANS RETURN
Three halfbacks, George Koffer,
Tom Ohliger, and Joe Welsh, have
returned and should make a strong
defensive trio. Although Hank Pe
ters has been considering the Navy,
he may be back at one of the full
back spots. In addition, Louis Chang,
Rene Paz, Dave Bills, and Art
Sweetzer will return to form a vet
eran nucleus for this year's forward
wall.
Some of the veterans who have
been lost to Ihe squad this year are
goalie Jack Burns and fullback Ollie
Hamlin, who were graduated; Jack
Pagen, who joined the Marines; and
last year's co-captain, Ed Johnson,
who finished his school course this
Summer Quarter.
There is some likelihood that some
contests will be arranged with the
Army teams in the vicinity, for the
Army has listed soccer as one of the
three top games for their training
program and should develop some
strong competition.
TENTATIVE SCHEDULE
Although the final conference
schedule will not be settled until a
meeting of officials on Sept. 28, a
