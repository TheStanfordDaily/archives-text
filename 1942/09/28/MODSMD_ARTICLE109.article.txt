# Irish Star to Play Quarterback Spot
## 
### 
Angelo Bertelli, the sensational j
bullet passer for the Irish of Notre 1
Dame, will face the Indians from the
quarterback spot this year, instead
of from his usual left-halfback spot,
when the two teams meet at South
Bend, Indiana.

The Irish star was one of the finest ;
passers in the country last year, com
pleting 70 out of 123 passes, for a
total gain of 1,207 yards. And much
like past Notre Dame passing stars,
the 175 pound ace can also run from !
the tailback spot.
