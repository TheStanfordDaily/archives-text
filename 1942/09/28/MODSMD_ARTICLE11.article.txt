# War Board Background Explained
## Wartime Group Sets Record for Service, Work Without Glory 
### BOB MANNA 
All out for Victory is the duty of
every American. This truth was
realized by Stanford closely follow
ing Dec. 7 . . . AND STANFORD
DID SOMETHING ABOUT IT.
Almost overnight groups of stu
dents organized to do everything
possible for the war. In the early
part of the year it bccame evident
that an organizing and directing
force was needed to group the vari
ous agencies.
And thus came into being the
Stanford War Board.
The SWB is composed entirely of
students and derives its authority
from the Associated Students of
Stanford University (ASSU). Un
like some of the "Farm's" more pop
ular peacetime "activities," SWB of
fers no glory, no future in campus
politics; only the satisfaction of
working in a group that has already
established a record of endeavor,
service, and things accomplished.
U.S.O. BRANCH
Operating as a part of the Board
is U. 5.0., which entertains service
men posted in the Palo Alto vicinity.
War Stamps and Bond sales last
summer sold thousands of dollars of
shares in democracy, and the sal
vage group collected tons of every
thing from floor mats to razor blades.
A group which is believed to be
unique to Stanford is the Dimes for
Diplomas organization. This unit has
already collected enough dimes for
soldiers who left college for the
armed forces to pay the way of a
lot of them who wish to continue
their education after victory.
Consumer Education is a commit
tee which has done a great deal for
students. It has, through publicity
and speeches, taught students to
make use of supposedly waste ma
terials.
RED CROSS CLASSES
Red Cross has been co-operating
with the national organization and
has organized classes in everything
from life-saving and first aid to mo
tor mechanics. Also once each
month the Blood Bank, under the
Red Cross, has come to Palo Alto and
taken donations from hundreds of
students.
Called by campus and University
leaders one of the most worth-while
organizations ever at Stanford, the
War Board is open to all students
interested in working hard for the
war and in doing ftiore than their bit.
Those interested in participating
in this work need only call local 513,
or visit the War Board office in room
I 13 of the Old Union. Room 13 is lo
cated immediately above the Union
Cellar.
