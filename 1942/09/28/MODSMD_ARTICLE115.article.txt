# Hollingbery and Red Sweater Forms Dangerous Combination

WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE, PULLMAN, Sept. 20—(Special to The
Daily)— One large-knit red sweater, now battered, ragged and torn, has
served Orin E. ("Babe") Hollingbery, W.S.C.'s veteran football master,
through 2.'5 years of coaching. The sweater is now as characteristic of
Babe as his own sideline antics on the football field.

"I'm really not superstitious," Babe
says, "But that sweater has stuck
with me such a long time that it's
become a good-luck emblem."
Hollingbery received the sweater
when playing football with the
Olympic Club in 1919. Since then,
it has been on his back while coach
ing Lick High School and Bates
Prep school in San Francisco, the
Olympic Club in San Francisco, the
annual East-West Shrine games, and
■the Chicago All-Star game which
Hollingbery helped coach several
years ago.
TRADITION SWEATER
Babe and his sweater started their
17th year coaching the Washington
State Cougars with the initial prac
tice last September 10. Even the
boys don't want to work unless Hol
lingbery wears his tradition sweater.
Last season, the battered garment
was misplaced by one of the mana
gers before the opening game in
Los Angeles against U.C.L.A. Every
thing on the trip went wrong—the
boys didn't get their workout on the
way down—they were held up eight
hours by a landslide—didn't arrive
in Los Angeles until 2 a.m.—the
street cars in Los Angeles kept them
awake the short time they were in
bed—the game was played at night
and the passing attack which Hol
lingbery had mapped V>ut bogged
down because of the dew on the
ground—and the Cougars lost the
game.
COMMITTEE
"When we got back home," Babe
said, "I found the sweater, and we
: started to win again. This year I've
appointed a committee of one to
take care of it."
Several years ago, the college gave
Hollingbery a new letter sweater.
He tried wearing it a few times, but
it just didn't feel right, so he went
back to wearing his old sweater. He
has been wearing it ever since.
The sweater was with Babe when
he coached the Olympic Club to 11
straight wins in 1925, climaxing the
season by defeating California the
first defeat California had received in

five years and in 45 straight games.
Again Hollingbery had the sweater
when his Washington State Cougars
won the Pacific Coast championship.
