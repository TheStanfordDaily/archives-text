# Coach Expects Indian's Best Aquatic Team
## 
### 
A Stanford swimming team three |
deep in every event, bolstered by j
record breakers Enimett Cashin. Jim
Gamble, and A1 Weeden, and hardly
affected by the graduation of only ;
three veterans, causes Coach Ernest
Brandsten to regard this year's ag
gregation as possibly one of Stan- ]
ford's greatest squads.
Sprinter Jim Gamble, who was
outstanding last year as a freshman,
set a frosh record of 24.1 in the 50
yard dash and will be the Cards best
in the 50 and 100. "Nobody on the
coast will beat him," assures Brand
sten.
''He has a fine stroke, swims high,
and may set a record anytime,"
Brandsten added.
Gamble's best in the 50. however,
is 3.3 against the Y.M.C.A., and he
likewise holds the freshman record
in the 100 at 54.4.
Bob Jones and Bob Mapel, both
24 second men who are fast improv
ing will press Gamble in the shorter
dash, whereas Don Smith is capable
of doing 55 seconds or better in the
century, having taken second place
in last, year's Big Meet.
NARVER OKEII AGAIN
Dick Narver was hampered in the
100 last year by a shoulder injury,
but that has been corrected and he ;
should improve very fast. Doug
Goodan and Mapel have possibilities.
Five men, all of whom are capable
of 2.20 or better will ably handle the
220 yard dash. The rivalry between
them should bring their times close
to 2.15. Those live include Smith,
Cashin, Renaltcr, Narver, and Ted
Munroe.
Munroe after missing last year's
Big Meet because of the measles is
the number one candidate in the !
quarter mile event having already j
hit 5.18 should accomplish 5.10 be- j
fore the end of the season. Eastman,
shorter distances most of last year
is now ready for the longer goings
a sophomore who worked on the
and might give Munroe some close
competition. Bell rounds out the
quarter mile trio.
CASIIIN BACKSTROKER
Leading the breaststrokes is no one
but the National A.A.U. champion,
Cashin, who is now eligible after a
year of university residence. Cash
in's best for the 200 yard event is
well under 2.25.
The 150 yard backstroke should
be well handled by sophomore Al j
Weeden who as a freshman hit .1.41
in breaking his older brother's rec
ord and according to Brandsten
should go under 1.37 this season.
Pete Hatch, Phil Lee, and Bill Mapel
will round out the combination, all
having done 1.47. They should im
prove theirs to 1.45 voices their
coach.
SHOULD BREAK RECORDS
With Cashin on the breaststroke,
Weeden on Ihe backstroke, and
Gamble on the freestyle, the Cards
will have a record breaking 300 yard
medley relay team capable of 2.58.
The event in the Big Meet last year
was won in 3.11. The 400 yard free
style relay doesn't worry Brandsten.
He has eight menâ€”Smith, Gamble,
Narver, Eastman, Cashin, Munroe, j
Mapel, and Goodan from which to |
pick a team.
Bill Beamer. a transfer from Michi
gan, Bill Gard, who took third
against Cal last year, and freshman
Carter Schriber and Dick Williams
round out a powerful diving team.
