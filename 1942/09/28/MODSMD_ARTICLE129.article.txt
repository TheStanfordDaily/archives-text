# BALL BOY' RISES TO NET CHAMPION
## 
### 
Ten years ago nobody—not even his mother—
thought the little ball boy scurrying around the Los
Angeles Tennis Club would ever be the national
champion.
Five years ago, even after the little boy had become
junior champion, nobody thought he would be the
nation's best netter. That is nobody except William
T. Tilden 111, all-time great who had given a little of
his time coaching the lad. But then "Big Bill" would
say anything unusual if he thought it might get in
print.
Two years ago, with two years of schooling at the
University of Southern California behind him and the
national doubles crown on his head, no one expected
the former ball boy ever to do much in singles. After
all, wasn't it his partner who had carried the load in
their climb to the doubles championship?
One year ago, after he had given the champion
his toughest match and come within one point of
advancing to the finals of the national singles tour
ney, still only one voice opined that the hero of this
saga, now a junior at Stanford, would within the
coming year reach the top of amateur tennis. That
lonely voice, curiously enough, came from a lowly
journalist on The Stanford Daily.
But Bill lilden, the? Daily journalist, and the lad's
mother—she was finally converted—can now say "I
told ya so," for Ted Schroeder went to Forrest Hills,
Long Island. He went there with an injured wrist. A
wrist that was taped up tightly. He wasn't impressive.
He dropped games to players who weren't in the same
class with him. He dropped games and all his wins
were close, but he won them all until he was in the

n »mm rn ■ ■ m m ■ W « ■ ■
finals with Frank Parker, the Los Angeles backboard.
He started slowly, the mechanical man was play
ing flawlessly, he jumped to a 4-2 lead on Schroeedr,
but Parker was like a machine and Schroedcr was a
human who could be inspired and he became in
spired and he outplayed Parker with shots that could
not be duplicated by the machine. He outplayed
the mechanical man, and won the first set. And then
he was down 5-2 in the second set.
Again he rose above the perfection of Parker and
came back from 5-2 to win the second set. And then
the match was won. He could loaf through the third
and fourth sets, and he did, and he could be fresh and
ready to win in the fifth and this he did, and the 6-2
score in the last set left no doubt as to who was the
better man.
And he won with a tightly taped wrist.
And they could say "I told you so," for Ted Schroe
der is the United States Lawn Tennis Association's
singles champion, twice doubles champion, mixed
doubles champion, intercollegiate singles and double?
champion, holder of myriad other titles, as well as the
country's and probably the world's foremost amdteui
tennis player.
But in these ten years Frederick R. Schroeder Jr.
hasn't sacrificed everything else and become a "ten
nis bum" in order to win these honors. He of the
"rolling walk," "bull shoulders," "perpetual squint,"
and "geometrical crew cut," as he has been variously
tagged by announcers, writers, and the public, has an
A.H. he received from Stanford University last June,
he has an enlistment in the United States Navy, and
he has a girl in Montana named "Boom-Boom."

He started slowly, the mechanical man was play
ing flawlessly, he jumped to a 4-2 lead on Schroeedr,
but Parker was like a machine and Schroedcr was a
human who could be inspired and he became in
spired and he outplayed Parker with shots that could
not be duplicated by the machine. He outplayed
the mechanical man, and won the first set. And then
he was down 5-2 in the second set.
Again he rose above the perfection of Parker and
came back from 5-2 to win the second set. And then
the match was won. He could loaf through the third
and fourth sets, and he did, and he could be fresh and
ready to win in the fifth and this he did, and the 6-2
score in the last set left no doubt as to who was the
better man.
And he won with a tightly taped wrist.

But in these ten years Frederick R. Schroeder Jr.
hasn't sacrificed everything else and become a "ten

Ten years ago nobody—not even his mother—
thought the little ball boy scurrying around the Los
Angeles Tennis Club would ever be the national
champion.
Five years ago, even after the little boy had become
junior champion, nobody thought he would be the
nation's best netter. That is nobody except William
T. Tilden 111, all-time great who had given a little of
his time coaching the lad. But then "Big Bill" would
say anything unusual if he thought it might get in
print.
Two years ago, with two years of schooling at the
University of Southern California behind him and the
national doubles crown on his head, no one expected
the former ball boy ever to do much in singles. After
all, wasn't it his partner who had carried the load in
their climb to the doubles championship?
One year ago, after he had given the champion
his toughest match and come within one point of
advancing to the finals of the national singles tour
ney, still only one voice opined that the hero of this
saga, now a junior at Stanford, would within the
coming year reach the top of amateur tennis. That
lonely voice, curiously enough, came from a lowly
journalist on The Stanford Daily.
But Bill lilden, the? Daily journalist, and the lad's
