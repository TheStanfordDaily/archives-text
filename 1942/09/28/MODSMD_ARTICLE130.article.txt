# Crewmen Build New Boathouse
## 
### 
Two bronzed backs were leaning
over the framework of a building
with a northeast wind from San
Francisco Bay blowing in their faces.
Those two backs belonged to Bud
Clary and Bill Chamberlin, who
came back to school two weeks early
to start work on the new home for
the Stanford crew at the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
Before actual construction could
begin, Clary, who is president of the
Stanford Boat Club, got a truck and
filled it with donated lumber from
a construction camp in the San Joa
quin Valley.
"It took us seven hours to load
and half an hour to unload," Clarv
said.
CREW MOVES
Last year the crew's home was
the Redwood City Harbor, but, ac
cording to Clary, the entire set up
at Palo Alto is better. The new boat
house is much closer to the water,
the racing course will be better pro
tected, and the location is more con
venient for students.
The ground for the boathouse was
donated by the City of Palo Alto
and $300 for construction costs and
upkeep on the boats was contributed
by alumni.
Carl Peterson will act as official
crew coach without pay. Although
Dr. O. N. Andersen could not be
reached for confirmation at the time
of publication, it is believed that
those who participate in crew Au
tumn Quarter will receive gym
credit.
RACES PLANNED
Clary hopes to have several races
this fall with U.C.L.A., Oregon State,
Sacramento J.C., and possibly one
of the Cal boats.
There are several strong veterans
returning, but with the added equip
ment and help, at least 30 candidates
will be needed to furnish the proper
competition. Clary returns at stroke
oar. Other experienced men are
Chamberlin, Orlin Harter, Herb
Goodan, and Dick Builis.
"We need freshmen," Clary said,
"but we can use any man who is
really interested. We have room for
two or three coxswains, also."
At present the boat club owns
three shells and a scow. Andy An
derson of Permanente has loaned
the club a coaching launch; so now
the .Stanford crew has every possi
bility to return to a prominent posi
tion in coast rowing circles.

Francisco Bay blowing in their faces.
Those two backs belonged to Bud
Clary and Bill Chamberlin, who
came back to school two weeks early
to start work on the new home for
the Stanford crew at the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
Before actual construction could
begin, Clary, who is president of the
Stanford Boat Club, got a truck and
filled it with donated lumber from
a construction camp in the San Joa
quin Valley.
"It took us seven hours to load
and half an hour to unload," Clarv
said.
CREW MOVES
Last year the crew's home was
the Redwood City Harbor, but, ac
cording to Clary, the entire set up
at Palo Alto is better. The new boat
house is much closer to the water,
the racing course will be better pro
tected, and the location is more con
venient for students.
The ground for the boathouse was
donated by the City of Palo Alto
and $300 for construction costs and
upkeep on the boats was contributed
by alumni.
Carl Peterson will act as official
crew coach without pay. Although
Dr. O. N. Andersen could not be
reached for confirmation at the time
of publication, it is believed that
those who participate in crew Au
tumn Quarter will receive gym
credit.
RACES PLANNED
Clary hopes to have several races
this fall with U.C.L.A., Oregon State,
Sacramento J.C., and possibly one
of the Cal boats.
There are several strong veterans
returning, but with the added equip
ment and help, at least 30 candidates
will be needed to furnish the proper
competition. Clary returns at stroke
oar. Other experienced men are
Chamberlin, Orlin Harter, Herb
Goodan, and Dick Builis.
"We need freshmen," Clary said,
"but we can use any man who is
really interested. We have room for
two or three coxswains, also."
At present the boat club owns
three shells and a scow. Andy An
derson of Permanente has loaned
the club a coaching launch; so now
the .Stanford crew has every possi
bility to return to a prominent posi
tion in coast rowing circles.
