# Water Polo Is All-Vet Team
## 
### 
The loss of only one man, Capt.
Frank Mitchell, from Ihe farm water
polo squad which last season twice
defeated California, 7-G and 7-4, for
the first time in- seven years, plus a
host of new material assures another
successful season for these who play
"the roughest sport on the curricula."
Forward candidates galore are vy
ing for three of the seven positions.
There's Capt. Bacon, Bob Mapel, Don
Smith, Dick Naver, A1 Weeden, Em
mett Cashin, and Grant Culley.
LOTS OF SPEED
"At this stage of the season Cashin
looks like the number one forward,"
Coach Ernest Bransten stated. "He's
got plenty of speed, had wonderful
experience playing with (he Olympic
Club, and swims very high. With
the huge turnout of new and good
men that we've got even Captain
Bacon and Grant Culley, last year's
all-conference forward will have to
hustle plenty fast to make the first
squad," he added.
Bob Jones, an outstanding swim
mer and poloist last year, is almost
certain for a starting guard berth.
He's big, a fine dribbler, and has ihe
necessary brains. Sophomores Hen
ery Saltanstall, a fast, shifty free
style swimmer, Peter Hatch, who
swims very high, and Phil Lee, a re
markably accurate shot will vie for
the remaining guard positions.
VETERAN GOALIE
Last year's veteran goalie, Bob
Lee, sophomore Noble will handle
the seventh man job.
"It looks like one the greatest
teams that I've ever seen," reiterated
Brandsten, "Thoy practiced well all
spring, and most of them were here
Summer Quarter. California will un
doubtedly be weaker due to the
losses of Norris and Crane, their
scoring combination, and Cleeves,
their outstanding guard."
