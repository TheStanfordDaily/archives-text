# NO ROSE BOWL
## 
### 
The Rose Bowl football classic, and
I the annual Tournament of Roses
parade has been canceled this year
by a vote of the citizens and mer
chants of Pasadena. The cancella
tion was thought to be the best way
of complying with the national war
! program.

Totally blind workmen in state
operated workshops produced goods
I valued at mote than $800,000 last
year, much of it for U.S. armed
I forces.

The University of California has a
record of 28(5 wins, 102 losses, and 39
| ties in 58 years of football.
