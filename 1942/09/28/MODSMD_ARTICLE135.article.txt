# BROWNELL SETS RECORD 66
## Stanford Ace Clips Two Off Old Mark 
### 
Stanford's "Bud" Brownell was
the hottest and coldest golfer in the
California State Golf Cliampion
ship tournament at Pebble Beach
during the first week of September.
Knocking out eight birdies,
Brownell set a new course com
petitive record of 66, six under par,
in the second qualifying round of
Ihe tournament. Brownell's G6 was
two strokes better than the previous
record of 68 set by a professional,
Les Madison, in 1935.
And Brownell's two-day qualify
ing total of 139 also established a
medalist mark for the tournament.
BItOWNFLL CO-FAVORED
Riding into the first round of
match play, Brownell was co-favored
for the championship with dapper
Johnny Dawson of Los Angeles.
Brownell, .shooting even-par golf,
disposed of Jim Hamm of. Los Ange
les in the first round by 7 and 6.
Alter rounds of* 73, GG, and 72—
Brownell looked like the hottest
player in the tournament.
But the next day, in the second
round of match play, Bud became
the coldest golfer in the tourna
ment. It happened suddenly on the
ninth hole. Bud was leading Bill
Fritz, San Francisco machinist, 4
lip after 8 holes, when suddenly his
putter froze.
COULDN'T SINK LITTLE ONES
After dropping 20- and 16-foot
putts for three days, Bud couldn't
even sink the little 3-foot ones in his
match with Fritz. The San Fran
ciscan, playing steady golf, de
feated the erratic Brownell, 2 and 1.
Three other members of Stanford's
golf team besides Brownell quali
fied for the tournament. Two of
them, Frank McCann and George
Traphagen, dropped out in the first
round of match play by identical
scores—2 and 1.
National Intercollegiate Champion
Frank Tatum, Jr., survived to the
third round before he was erased by
Mat Palacio, Hamilton Field, by 2
and 1.
It was Brownell's last match under
Stanford colors, as Bud graduated
at the end of Summer Quarter and
expects to be called into the service
soon.
Cool-tempered little Johnny Daw
son, whose game was consistently
hot, won the tournament handily.
