# Farm Fencing Outlook Fair
## 
### 
All hough seriously handicapped by
the loss of several graduating mem
bers of the team, Coach Elwyn
Bugge's Farm fencers will have sev
eral experienced men back on the
squad to make up the nucleus of a
strong team.
With top man Bob Helliwell gone,
Bugge will have to rely on the work
of Harvard Lomax, Bob Perkins and
A1 Hedden.
Hedden, up from last year's frosh
team, promises to be one of the best
fencers on the Indian squad. With
only a year of experience Hedden
went well in the finals of the Uni
versity playoffs. It will be around
Lomax, however, that Coach Bugge
will attempt to build a new team.
Lomax will hold down first spot on
the Farm team.
As yet no games have been sched
uled for the current season but
Coach Bugge hopes to round out
some intercollegiate matches for the
later part of the quarter.
All men interested in trying out
for the team are invited to see Coach
Bugge about arrangements or to sign
up for fencing on Reg day.
