# Michigan Backfield Tops in Big Ten
## 
### 
Michigan's great backfield of last
year, the backfield that was bottled
only by the giant Minnesota line,
will return intact except for Bob
Westfall, their spinning and line
bucking wizard. Back will be
Tommy Kuzma, the sophomore last
year who stepped into Harmon's
shoes, and came through. Back will
be Georgie Ceithaml, captain and
one of the hiost devastating blockers
in the Big Ten. And also back will
be Paul ("Tiger") White, the scat
back, who can also cut down oppos
ing ends from his wing spot.
These backs, operating behind a
line headed by Bob Kolesar, Julius
Franks, Merv Pregelman, and the
Ail-American candidate for tackle,
A1 Wistert, will give the Wolverines
the edge in the Big Ten race.
