## 
### 
When the Stanford tennis squad
opens it practice sessions for the
coming year, it will be without three
of the key men who led them in
last year's championship team.
Missing will be the dynamic Ted
Schroeder, number one man for the
Cards last season and also the num
ber one player in the nation. Gone
will be Larry Dee, number three
man and ace doubles player. Also
missing will be Jimmy Wade, who
was fourth on the squad last year,
and former inter-collegiate doubles
champion with Dee.
But the cards cannot be counted
out of the Conference race. Return
ing this year will be the dependable
Emery Neale, the Portland senior.
Neale was number two behind
Schroeder last year, and is an ag
gressive player, with a powerful
serve and he should be ready for his
best season this year. He is as strong
as any number one man on the coast.
Behind Neale, there can be any
one. There is Chuck Hutchison, a
senior who could play good tennis,
Paul Wilson, the Ventura J.C. trans
fer who played doubles mostly last
year, Jack Clark, who can be a win
ner, and then a bunch from the frosh,
headed by Ted Myers, Dick Thomas,
Bob Rutledge and Tom Van Fleet.
