# Firemen Seek Fourth Mural Football drown
## 
### 
The new physical activity program,
revitalized by the demands of the
war effort, have skyrocketed the in
tramurals program for the coming
vear. Football, as always, will be
in the prime spot.
The Firehouse, defending champs,
will be hard pressed to repeat lor
the fourth time. Although they suc
ceeded in retiring the big silver tro
phy after three successful football
seasons, the loss of the Plyl brothers,
Monte and Frank, George Kaufman,
Frank Farrell, and Wy Cripe will
force them to field a completely in
experienced team, with the exception
of returning veterans Bill Berreyesa
and Tom Kruger.
Farrell and the Pfyl brothers were
members of all three championship
teams; Kaufman was a two-year
veteran; and Cripe kicked the .10-
yard field goal that beat the Kappa
Sigs in last year's finals.
KAPPA SIGS STRONG
Although Jack Harris and Frank
Wells, both members of last year's
finalists, will not be back, the Kappa
Sigs should have another strong
team, probably built around John
Brooke, an outstanding lineman.
If the Athertonized men of two
years ago are allowed to play, watch
out for the Dekes. They'll have a
fine player and an outstanding coach
if Bill Joslyn can come out. The
absence of Jim Pollard, however,
will be sorely felt.
POTENTIAL CHAMPS
Two other potential champs are
the Alpha Delts and Zetes. With
Dave Doud, Gordon and Bob Crary,
and triple-threat Dee Rowe in the
fold, the Alpha Delts will be one of
the strongest contenders, while the
Zetes, with basket bailers Ed Voss,
Jack Dana, and Fred Oliver, should
have a "dark-horse" favorite.
Still another strong aggregation
will be the winner of the Encina
League, if the frosh summer soft
ball teams are any indication. And
lastly, the Delta Chi's, led by base
baller Lee Scott, from frosh football
ers of two seasons ago, must be
watched.
The 1942 season opens with the
Fall Quarter, so get out those old
jerseys and start tossing the old
pigskin around.

the Alpha Delts and Zetes. With
Dave Doud, Gordon and Bob Crary,
and triple-threat Dee Rowe in the
fold, the Alpha Delts will be one of
the strongest contenders, while the
Zetes, with basket bailers Ed Voss,
Jack Dana, and Fred Oliver, should
have a "dark-horse" favorite.
Still another strong aggregation
will be the winner of the Encina
League, if the frosh summer soft
ball teams are any indication. And
lastly, the Delta Chi's, led by base
baller Lee Scott, from frosh football
ers of two seasons ago, must be
watched.
The 1942 season opens with the
Fall Quarter, so get out those old
jerseys and start tossing the old
pigskin around.
The new physical activity program,
revitalized by the demands of the
war effort, have skyrocketed the in
tramurals program for the coming
vear. Football, as always, will be
in the prime spot.
The Firehouse, defending champs,
will be hard pressed to repeat lor
the fourth time. Although they suc
ceeded in retiring the big silver tro
phy after three successful football
seasons, the loss of the Plyl brothers,
Monte and Frank, George Kaufman,
Frank Farrell, and Wy Cripe will
force them to field a completely in
experienced team, with the exception
of returning veterans Bill Berreyesa
and Tom Kruger.
Farrell and the Pfyl brothers were
members of all three championship
teams; Kaufman was a two-year
veteran; and Cripe kicked the .10-
yard field goal that beat the Kappa
Sigs in last year's finals.
KAPPA SIGS STRONG
Although Jack Harris and Frank
Wells, both members of last year's
finalists, will not be back, the Kappa
Sigs should have another strong
team, probably built around John
Brooke, an outstanding lineman.
If the Athertonized men of two
years ago are allowed to play, watch
out for the Dekes. They'll have a
fine player and an outstanding coach
if Bill Joslyn can come out. The
absence of Jim Pollard, however,
will be sorely felt.
POTENTIAL CHAMPS
Two other potential champs are
the Alpha Delts and Zetes. With
Dave Doud, Gordon and Bob Crary,
and triple-threat Dee Rowe in the
fold, the Alpha Delts will be one of
the strongest contenders, while the
Zetes, with basket bailers Ed Voss,
Jack Dana, and Fred Oliver, should
have a "dark-horse" favorite.
Still another strong aggregation
will be the winner of the Encina
League, if the frosh summer soft
ball teams are any indication. And
lastly, the Delta Chi's, led by base
baller Lee Scott, from frosh football
