# Daily Opens Grid Circus
## 
### 
For the first time in many years,
The Stanford Daily will throw a team
on to the intramural football fields,
it was announced by Editor John
Horrall. "We have lots of talent
around the shack, and we should go
places," the editor said.
The squad will be light, but will
balance off its lack of weight with
deceptive fakes, criss-crosses, re
verses, hidden ball plays, laterals,
flankers, man in motion plays, and
anything that it can do to make
touchdowns.
Leading the Daily circus will be
Ches Saroyan, who will pass and call
plays from the tailback.
"My plan is to baffle the opposi
tion," Saroyan said. "We will baffle'
them and then spring men into the
clear. I think the system is infall
ible."
In the backfield with Saroyan will
be Zip Walt, rocket back who can
run an eleven flat hundred. Walt
will spend most of his time on the
wing, taking passes in the flat and
spreading the opposing line. Round
ing out the backfield will be Froggy
Hampson, who can't do a thing.
The line will be built around Big
Bulge Charley Allen. The Bulge will
be planted at the center spot, and
will be flanked by two rugged guards
Lou Sloss of the Business Staff, and
Mike Kresge. The Daily men will
be strongest on the flanks, with Edi
tor John Horrall and Sports Editor
Bob Sontag. Both boys are tall and
rangy and have sticky fingers, and
are ideal men to take the bullet
passes from Saroyan.
The squad will work under the
name of the Pied Typers.

more rigorous demands on the spark
plugs, causing them to lose efficiency
more rapidly. - '
