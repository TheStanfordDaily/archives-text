# Taylor Picked on Grid Analysts All-American
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
The Daily's Grid Analyst
The key words to the 1942 collegiate football season will he the T
formation and Blondie Black.
Stanford, Notre Dame, Missouri, and Boston College, four of the na
tion's top ten teams, will do their attacking from a T, some the same as
that exploded on college grid circles here two years ago by Clark Shaugh-

and some with variations, but
the offensive weapon of the coming
months on the nation's greenswards
will be the T.
Two boys, Billy Hillenbrand of In
diana and Frank Sinkwich of Geor
gia, on their records of last year,
have been chosen as the players of
the year before the season starts, but
in two months, John Thomas
"Blondie" Black's reputation will
override any amount of publicity
Sinkwich and Hillenbrand might get.
By that time the Mississippi State
sprinting giant will have knocked
cold his yearly quota of a dozen men
in his-rampaging charges.
FORDHAM AGAIN?
But turning to the more conven
tional task of choosing sectional and
national championship teams, the na
tion's best team is always just the
best team in the picker's region, so
only sectional leaders can be chosen.
Fordham's yearly high hopes for
top honors in the East will receive
plenty of dampening from the Bos
ton College Eagles, Pennsylvania,
Duquesne, and Maryland—yes, little
Maryland, the team that after 2!)
days of Shaughnessy's teachings
whipped the Navy eleven in a spring
practice game.
No team south of the Mason-Dixon
line appears to be able to challenge
Georgia's supremacy. Gone are those
yearly powerhouses, Duke,and Ten
nessee. One or two of Mississippi
State's usual upsets might lift the
Corn Pone title from the Bulldogs,
but it isn't likely.
AGGIES CLASSY
Texas Aggies loom as the class of
the Southwest, but with that region's
entire grid picture at a low ebb, even
their best is none too good.
Missouri's Tigers are not only des
tined to walk over all Big Six com
petition, but they should give what
ever team is Unfortunate enough to
draw them in the January bowl cir
cuit a big surprise.
No Western Conference team
should be able to challenge Notre
Dame's bid for Midwestern su
premacy this season. The Golden
Gophers of Minnesota are on the
decline, and Michigan hasn't quite
the all-around strength.
In case anyone is worried about
it, Utah should remain as the class
of the Rockies this season.
IRISH POTENT
With the Far West's two best
j teams, U.S.C. and Stanford, both
| playing intersectional tilts with the
potent Fighting Irish, there should
be little difficulty in establishing the
relationship between football in these
| parts and the game elsewhere.
As for the usual September all -
| American team, it might shape up
i like this:
Ends—Bob Gantt and Nick Suso
eff of Duke and Washington Stiite,
respectively, ahead of Dave Schrei
ncr of Wisconsin and Bill Hender
son of Texas A. & M.
Tackles — Dick Wildung, Minne
sota veteran, and Gil Bouley of
| Boston College rate ahead of Michi
gan's Wistart and Duquesne's Ma
tisi.
Guards—Bob Dove of Notre Dame
and Chuck Taylor of Stanford are
far ahead of all other collegiate
guards.
Center—Washington's Walt Harri
son should finally get the acclaim he
has deserved for two years. Bill Sib
ley of Texas Aggies will furnish his
competition.
Backs—Sandwiched in with Black,
Hillenbrand, and Sinkwich is an
other big hard runner, a bit harder
than most—Pat Harder of Wiscon
sin. Since he comes from New York,
the Gotham scribes will try to build
Columbia's Paul Governali into a

j first stringer, but he'll have to be
j content with a second row seat along
with Dippy Evans of Notre Dame,
Mickey McCardle of U.S.C., and Bob
j Steuber of Missouri.
