# ED STAMM ALMOST GRABBED BY NAVY:
## 
### 
Contrary to what you may have read elsewhere, Stanford's student
body prexy and prize left tackle WAS almost swept into the Navy maw
a couple of weeks ago. Although he is-a Navy engineer and registered
in a reserve classification, Ed received a wire, ordering him to report to
Newport, Rhode Island. Sept. 8. Right after finals, he went home to Port
land, thence checked in Seattle at the Navy office on the order.
Seattle officials told him to remain in Portland and not report even
if it meant he would be late at R.1., because they were so sure it was
all a mistake.
Finally word came through on the ninth that the order was a mistake
and that the Navy would much rather have Stamm finish school as pro
vided for in his classification. So it was just a little excitement, but he
did have to straighten it out to be here this fall.
