# FOOTBALL DIFFERENT UNDER SCHWARTZ:
## 
### 
Football this year will be different under Stanford's new coach,
Marchie Schwartz.
You can remember last year when the stadium arcs blazed on until
7:30 p.m. sometimes while the Farm gridders toiled. Well, it ain't gonna
be that way no more. Not because
Schwartz doesn't believe in scrim
mage and lots of it, but because he
knows it, can be overdone.
It was overdone last year, we
believe, when Stanford went into
that Cal game, heavy favorites,
only to drop a l(i-love match.
They had worked out too much.
Now, during the pre-season train
ing period, for example, it's two daily
sessions, 9-11, and 3-5. And Marchie
sticks by those hours.
It's not "just one more play fel
las," and on into the night as Clark
Shaughnessy did. Schwartz prac
tices during those four hours, and at
the quitting bell it's "that's all for
today," and he means it.
What this new type method means
is that the team can be keyed up
for a game, and maybe slightly
under-keyed, but it will never be
stale. It will always be asking for
more, and that's the right physical
condition for winning football.
Here's good luck to Marchie and
Stanford's 1942 grid eleven.
