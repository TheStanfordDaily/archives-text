# MARTIN STILL PUTS ON A SHOW:
## 
### 
While in Portland uncling the sister's baby, we happened in at a few
ball games at the Vaughn Street stadium. Sacramento was in town, but
the lowly Bcavos (that's what the Oregonian calls 'cmâ€”reason being
Beavers is one count too long for a headline, methinx) took two out of
th ree that we saw.
Best part of it was to see manager-player Pepper Martin handle
first base and slide into third. lie came around to third on a long
single and hit the bag head first, arms and legs flying like a wind
mill. teeth gnashing and spikes flashing. It's a good thing the throw
was way late, or there might have been total war at third.
