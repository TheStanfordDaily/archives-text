# Card Spirit May Carry Them To Title Over Bums, Yanks
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
If the St. Louis Cardinals keep up the momentum of their surge toward
the National League pennant for a few more days, they may win the
World Series as well as the pennant.
The Cards are the "hottest" team in baseball today. They've got the
fight, the spirit, and the drive to carry them to the pennant. And that

Cardinal spirit is a tough thing to
beat in the stretch drive.
But if the Cards win the flag, how
will they stack up against the World
Champion New York Yankees, who
clinched their 13th American League
pennant last week?
Solely on the basis of form, a World
Series between the Yanks and Cards
would be very close. The Yanks
would have a slight pitching edge,
a marked infield edge, and the Cards
would have a marked outfield edge
and better reserves.
For the sake of comparison, let's
see how the two teams stack up,
position by position.
CATCHER
Bolstered by the veteran Bill
Dickey, still the best catcher in the
majors, the Yankee catching corps
has a decided edge over the Cards.
The Cards have Walker Cooper,
brother of pitcher Mort Cooper, and
Ken O'Dea, former Cub backstop.
| Cooper, hitting .288, is one of the best
catchers in the National League, but
not the equal of Dickey.
FIRST BASE
First Base is a toss-up. The Cards'
young Johnny Hopp has the fielding
edge, and the Yanks' Buddy Hassett
has a slight batting edge. Hassett is
hitting .283 to Hopp's .267.
SECOND BASE
Although the Cards' Jimmy Brown
is the National League's best second
baseman, he's not in the same class
with Joe Gordon of the Yankees.
Gordon is the best infielder in the
majors.
SHORTSTOP
Here the Cardinals have a slight
edge. Martin Marion's .284 batting
mark gives him the nod over little
Scooter Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees,
who is hitting .271. Both arc excel
lent fielders.
THIRD BASE
Gerald Priddy, playing in place of
the ailing Red Piolfe, deserves a
slight edge over Rookie Walt Kurow
ski of the Cardinals. Priddy's bat
ting mark of .288 and his consistent
fielding rate him over the young
Polish boy, who is batting .
Hence the Yankees have a decided
edge in the infield. In the outfield,
however, the Cards have a decided
edge on the basis of this year's rec
ords.
RIGHT FIELD
Enos "Country" Slaughter's power
j has been the big gun of the Cardinal
attack all year. His .320 record at
the plate clearly gives him the edge
over Roy Cullenbine of the Yankees
who is only hitting .273.
CENTER FIELD
The Cardinals Terry Moore is the
best center fielder in the National
League, and is one of the greate.sl
defensive outfielders in the history
j of the game. Bui he must give the

T
edge to Joe DiMaggio, the greatest
all-around ball player in the majors
today.
LEFT FIELD
Because Charley Keller is having
a bad year at the plate, the left field
edge goes to young Stan Musial of
the Cardinals. Rookie Musial's big
bat is currently pummeling the ball
for .317, while Keller's average is
i down to .282.
PITCHING
The Yankees and Cardinals have
the two best pitching staffs in the
; majors. The big five of each pitching
| staff, with won and lost records for
the year, are:
YANKEES: Hank Borowy (15-13),
I Ernie Bonham (20-5), Spud Chand
ler (16-4), Atley Donald (9-3), and
i Red Ruffinp (14-7).
CARDINALS: Johnny Beazley
1 (19-6), Mort Cooper (2U-7), Howie
Krist (12-3), Max Lanier (13-7), and
Murry Dickson (6-3).
There is little to choose between
! the two staffs. Both are loaded with
young, capable hurlers. The Yankees
i have a long edge on experience, and
therefore they must be given the
[ edge in pitching.

the National League pennant for a few more days, they may win the
World Series as well as the pennant.

Gordon is the best infielder in the
majors.
SHORTSTOP
Here the Cardinals have a slight
edge. Martin Marion's .284 batting
mark gives him the nod over little
Scooter Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees,
who is hitting .271. Both arc excel
lent fielders.
THIRD BASE
Gerald Priddy, playing in place of
the ailing Red Piolfe, deserves a
slight edge over Rookie Walt Kurow
ski of the Cardinals. Priddy's bat
ting mark of .288 and his consistent
fielding rate him over the young
Polish boy, who is batting .
Hence the Yankees have a decided
edge in the infield. In the outfield,
however, the Cards have a decided
edge on the basis of this year's rec
ords.
RIGHT FIELD
Enos "Country" Slaughter's power
j has been the big gun of the Cardinal
attack all year. His .320 record at
the plate clearly gives him the edge
over Roy Cullenbine of the Yankees
who is only hitting .273.
CENTER FIELD
The Cardinals Terry Moore is the
best center fielder in the National
League, and is one of the greate.sl
defensive outfielders in the history
j of the game. Bui he must give the

T
edge to Joe DiMaggio, the greatest
all-around ball player in the majors
today.
LEFT FIELD
Because Charley Keller is having
a bad year at the plate, the left field
edge goes to young Stan Musial of
the Cardinals. Rookie Musial's big
bat is currently pummeling the ball
for .317, while Keller's average is
i down to .282.
PITCHING
The Yankees and Cardinals have
the two best pitching staffs in the
; majors. The big five of each pitching
| staff, with won and lost records for
the year, are:
YANKEES: Hank Borowy (15-13),
I Ernie Bonham (20-5), Spud Chand
ler (16-4), Atley Donald (9-3), and
i Red Ruffinp (14-7).
CARDINALS: Johnny Beazley
1 (19-6), Mort Cooper (2U-7), Howie
Krist (12-3), Max Lanier (13-7), and
Murry Dickson (6-3).
There is little to choose between
! the two staffs. Both are loaded with
young, capable hurlers. The Yankees
i have a long edge on experience, and
therefore they must be given the
[ edge in pitching.
If the St. Louis Cardinals keep up the momentum of their surge toward
the National League pennant for a few more days, they may win the
World Series as well as the pennant.
The Cards are the "hottest" team in baseball today. They've got the
fight, the spirit, and the drive to carry them to the pennant. And that

Cardinal spirit is a tough thing to
beat in the stretch drive.
But if the Cards win the flag, how
will they stack up against the World
Champion New York Yankees, who
clinched their 13th American League
pennant last week?
Solely on the basis of form, a World
Series between the Yanks and Cards
would be very close. The Yanks
would have a slight pitching edge,
a marked infield edge, and the Cards
would have a marked outfield edge
and better reserves.

| staff, with won and lost records for
the year, are:
YANKEES: Hank Borowy (15-13),
I Ernie Bonham (20-5), Spud Chand
ler (16-4), Atley Donald (9-3), and
i Red Ruffinp (14-7).
CARDINALS: Johnny Beazley
1 (19-6), Mort Cooper (2U-7), Howie
Krist (12-3), Max Lanier (13-7), and
Murry Dickson (6-3).
There is little to choose between
! the two staffs. Both are loaded with
young, capable hurlers. The Yankees
i have a long edge on experience, and
therefore they must be given the
[ edge in pitching.
If the St. Louis Cardinals keep up the momentum of their surge toward
the National League pennant for a few more days, they may win the
World Series as well as the pennant.
The Cards are the "hottest" team in baseball today. They've got the
fight, the spirit, and the drive to carry them to the pennant. And that

Cardinal spirit is a tough thing to
beat in the stretch drive.
But if the Cards win the flag, how
will they stack up against the World
Champion New York Yankees, who
clinched their 13th American League
pennant last week?
Solely on the basis of form, a World
Series between the Yanks and Cards
would be very close. The Yanks
would have a slight pitching edge,
a marked infield edge, and the Cards
would have a marked outfield edge
and better reserves.
For the sake of comparison, let's
see how the two teams stack up,
position by position.
CATCHER
Bolstered by the veteran Bill
Dickey, still the best catcher in the
majors, the Yankee catching corps
has a decided edge over the Cards.
The Cards have Walker Cooper,
brother of pitcher Mort Cooper, and
Ken O'Dea, former Cub backstop.
| Cooper, hitting .288, is one of the best
catchers in the National League, but
not the equal of Dickey.
FIRST BASE
First Base is a toss-up. The Cards'
young Johnny Hopp has the fielding
edge, and the Yanks' Buddy Hassett
has a slight batting edge. Hassett is
hitting .283 to Hopp's .267.
SECOND BASE
Although the Cards' Jimmy Brown
is the National League's best second
baseman, he's not in the same class
with Joe Gordon of the Yankees.
Gordon is the best infielder in the
majors.
SHORTSTOP
Here the Cardinals have a slight
edge. Martin Marion's .284 batting
mark gives him the nod over little
Scooter Phil Rizzuto of the Yankees,
who is hitting .271. Both arc excel
lent fielders.
THIRD BASE
Gerald Priddy, playing in place of
the ailing Red Piolfe, deserves a
slight edge over Rookie Walt Kurow
ski of the Cardinals. Priddy's bat
ting mark of .288 and his consistent
fielding rate him over the young
Polish boy, who is batting .
Hence the Yankees have a decided
edge in the infield. In the outfield,
however, the Cards have a decided
edge on the basis of this year's rec
ords.
RIGHT FIELD
Enos "Country" Slaughter's power
j has been the big gun of the Cardinal
attack all year. His .320 record at
the plate clearly gives him the edge
over Roy Cullenbine of the Yankees
who is only hitting .273.
CENTER FIELD
The Cardinals Terry Moore is the
best center fielder in the National
League, and is one of the greate.sl
defensive outfielders in the history
j of the game. Bui he must give the

T
edge to Joe DiMaggio, the greatest
all-around ball player in the majors
today.
LEFT FIELD
Because Charley Keller is having
a bad year at the plate, the left field
edge goes to young Stan Musial of
the Cardinals. Rookie Musial's big
bat is currently pummeling the ball
for .317, while Keller's average is
i down to .282.
PITCHING
The Yankees and Cardinals have
the two best pitching staffs in the
; majors. The big five of each pitching
| staff, with won and lost records for
the year, are:
YANKEES: Hank Borowy (15-13),
I Ernie Bonham (20-5), Spud Chand
ler (16-4), Atley Donald (9-3), and
i Red Ruffinp (14-7).
CARDINALS: Johnny Beazley
1 (19-6), Mort Cooper (2U-7), Howie
Krist (12-3), Max Lanier (13-7), and
Murry Dickson (6-3).
There is little to choose between
! the two staffs. Both are loaded with
young, capable hurlers. The Yankees
i have a long edge on experience, and
therefore they must be given the
[ edge in pitching.
