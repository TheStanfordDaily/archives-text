# Losses Shake Veteran Farm Baseball Team
## 
### ZIP WALT 
Baseball Coach Harry Woltcr
thought (hat he was going to field
an all-veteran team this coming
spring:, hut the loeal enlistment of
fiees have the answer to his squad,
for many key men have left for the

service.
The losses that will be felt the
most are Ted Nell at third base and
Carl Kellenbergcr at centerfield.
The team that could win but two
C.1.8.A. games last year will have
a bolstered pitching staff with Harry
Mason and Bill Brokawfi fresh from
a successful season on the frosh
squad. Mason pitched and played in
the field for a semi-pro team this j
summer, showing great authority at
bat. Bill Harms will be back to serve
as a relief hurler, and may take some
starting assignments.
OL' LEFTHANDER
Only lefthander on the mound staff
is Don Pendergrass, who was slated
to have a banner year as a sopho
more, but an ailing arm kent him
on the side lines most of the season.
He may also be used in the oumeiu
to utilize his hitting ability.
Lost to the pitching staff are Harry
Dyck and Bill Wilson. Dyck was
the team's No. 1 chucker, and was
forced to carry most of the hurl
ing assignments. Wilson has been
drafted.
Veteran Ward Walkup will be
back to handle the catching assign
ments, and will have relief in Sandy
Banks, up from the frosh team.
Walkup, filling in for Ace Hanlon
who did not return, came through
in fine style, and is expected to have
have a good year.
HAMMETT SPARKPLUG
The team's spark plug and out
standing player, Ray Hammett, is
again expected to have no peers in
the league around the first base bag.
Hammett was the only Stanford man
to hit over .300, clouting the ball for
I a good .319 average with a losing
club.
Harry Parsons and Captain A.
Boch Caruso have graduated and
Dick Middleton has joined the Ma-
I rines, leaving the second base spot
1 wide open. C. C. Smith of the frosh
1 team is improving fast, and may fill
the position.
Leland Scott will be back to con
tinue at shortstop but may be forced
| to move over to second base, should
j Clark Graham turn out for the team.
Sophomore Jim Boswell is also a
good contender for the sport.
Ted Nell has joined the Air Corps,
leaving but Ted Fallasco to cover
third b&se. Nell played almost ev
ery inning at this spot, and will be
sorely missed by Coach Wolter.
