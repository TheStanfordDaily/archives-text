# Indian Chiefs Haul Out Tom-toms, Prime Farm For Pre-Reg Welcome
## Campus Abandons Vacation Days To Greet New Students Sept. 25 At Week-end Acquaintance Course 
### DAVE DAVIS 
Indian drums of welcome will beat Friday, Sept. 25, pounded by
Stanford committeemen emerging from the obscurity of a vacation period
to greet hundreds of new students, gathering at the Farm for a three-day,
pre-registration celebration. And the 8 a.m. opening of Itoble, Ventura, and
Encina halls will officially start the program designed to acquaint fresh
men with every phase of Stanford life.
Early morning trains will be met by chief drum-thumper A1 Haas, and
members of his pre-registration committee, who will shuffle the new-

comers to their respective halls, in-4
troduce them to their sponsors, and I
each other.
Taking part in a whirlwind sched- j
ule allowing little time for dawdling, j
the freshmen will get a rush intro- j
duction to Stanford's academic side
at 1:30 p.m. when the aptitude test
will be given in Room 214. Survivors
will then retire to sponsors' rooms
for an afternoon of discussion and
relaxation. During these meetings
the sponsors will explain the intri
cacies of the pre-registration pro
gram and acquaint the frosh with
classmates living in the immediate
vicinity.
New students will become gastro
nomically familiar with Stanford
Friday night, eating their first meals
of the Autumn Quarter at Roble and
Encina, while verbal dessert will be
served in the form of a greeting by
Dean of Women Mary Yost, speak
ing at Roble, and Dean of Men John
Bunn, at Encina.
ENGLISH A EXAMS
A 7:15 breakfast Saturday will
possibly prepare students for the
English A examination to be given
from 8 to 10 a.m., as latecomers make
up the aptitude test at 9 o'clock.
At 10:30 sponsors will again take
the frosh in hand, providing them
with campus maps, course announce
ment booklets, and showing them
where time schedules may be pur
chased. The group will then be di
rected to class advisers who will as
sist each student to plan his scho
lastic program. A vigorous attempt
will be made by the Pre-Reg Com
to get every student to his adviser
by 1 p.m., so that all may attend the
Stanford-Washington State game to
be played in the stadium Saturday
afternoon.
"Everyone should be sure his pro
gram is made out first, even though
he misses the game," Haas advises.
Advisers will be available all af
ternoon.
FIRST JOLLY-UP
Stanford's institution of the dance,
the Jolly-Up, will claim the atten
tion of new men and women from
7:30 to 9:00 Saturday night. Aiming
to keep the wolves away from the
gate, Haas says, "Strictly, this affair
is for first-quarter new students. In
fact, identification badges will be
J necessary for even them to got in."
The dance is offered as a consolation
