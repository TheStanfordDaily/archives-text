With the prospect of a lowered
draft age, more and more college
men will be seeking to enter the

the discretion of War Department
officials.
The age requirement is set at 1H

Good standing in (he University and
good physical condition are the other
entrance requirements.
Upon induction into the army, the
reservist will undergo the regular
13-week basic training program of
