# Quartermaster School to Open
## 
### KEITH BENNETT 
Stanford's newest addition to the
Wartime effort will open Sept. 28
whell the school for training quar
termaster corps officers begins its
initial session.
The training program will be car
ried out as a part of the Graduate
School of Business, and will be the
only quartermaster corps unit on the
roast offering training on the gradu
ate level.
The entrance requirements for the
school are:
Candidates must have a bachelor's
degree from an accredited univer
sity, must be less than 30 years of
age when completing the course,
must have had 2 years basic R.O.T.C.
training, and must be able to pass
the regular army physical examina
tion (an eye test of 20/100 is accept
able).
Upon satisfactory completion of
the 18 month training program the
candidates are awarded the degree
of Master of Business Administra
tion, and are commissioned second
lieutenants in the Officer's Reserve,
Quartermaster Corps. Candidates
failing to satisfactorily pass the
course will become privates in the
quartermaster coi'ps.
Under the existing draft regula
tions, men enrolled in the advance
course of quartermaster training will
be draft exempt, and placed in class
4-B.
A quota of 50 candidates has been
established for the Stanford school,
and it is believed that the number of
applications will far exceed the num
ber to be admitted.
Students accepted for the officer
training course will receive govern
ment allowances amounting to about
$200 for the two-year period. Of
this, SlOO is deductable for uniforms

and textbooks. Students will wear
uniforms similar to those worn by
commissioned officers except for rank
insignia.
By awarding both a degree and a
commission, the training program
will be exceptionally valuable to the
candidate. The regular course of
fered by the Graduate School of
Business is almost identical with the
requirements for training of Quarter
master Corps officers, and has elimi
nated the necessity for major cur
riculum changes.
The program will draw part of its
classes from Stanford graduates who
have had the required two years of
basic R.O.T.C. training.
