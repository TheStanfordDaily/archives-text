Chancellor and Mrs. Ray Lyman
Wilbur will be at home informally
for all new students Saturday eve
ning, Oct. 3, from 8 to 11 at their
Lagunita Knoll residence.
In the past Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur
have held two receptions, one for
the new lower division students and
one for the new upper division stu
dents. However, this year, because
of the large freshman class enrolled
for Summer Quarter, there will be
only one reception.
Dress for this traditional part of
the orientation program will be in
formal. Besides meeting Dr. and
Mrs. Wilbur, students will also meet
various other University officials.
