## F. Q. Hewitt Drafted; Allen Holds Hammer 
### 
The Stanford Chaparral, campus
humor magazine, in starting its sec
ond half-century of publication next
month, promises bigger and funnier
things for the 1942-43 school year,
but in doing so it is also calling on
every student to do what he can
writing, drawing, and selling the
new Chappie.
With Editor Frank Hewitt sched
uled for the foot artillery next month,
and with several other members of
the staff in a doubtful status as to
the duration of their scholastic en
deavors, much new talent is needed
to keep the Chaparral content at its
present level.
In Hewitt's absence, Don Allen,
associate editor, will take over Jhe
editorial side of the magazine.
Business Manager Bruce McClel
land and Circulation Manager Max
well Myers have issued a call for
freshmen women to help in the fall
subscription drive. They offer mone
tary gain, social broadening, and in
tellectual sharpening to any co-cd
aiding this worthy cause.
Associate Editor H. D. Thoreau said
in reference to the magazine's an
nual quest for new talent, "If it can
find our office, it has sufficient talent
to merit a page in our magazine."
Other Chaparral officers for the
coming year are B. G. Miller, man
aging editor, Douglas Hastings, art
editor and Rita Hayworth, inspira
tional editor.
The magazine is published by
Hammer and Coffin, National Hon
orary Humor Society.
