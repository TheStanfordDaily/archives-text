# Stanford Trains Women Engineers
## 
### 
Women are soon to be given free
' training in engineering at Stanford
I as a result of the increased demand
for semi-skilled laborers in war in
| dustries.
On the basis of the success of the
recently completed 10-week train- ;
j ing program, Stanford is setting up a
I full year program for which appli
cants must have completed at least
two years of college work, with a I
; preference being placed on courses
| in mathematics and physical sci- '
ences, according to Professor Eugene
L. Grant, director of the war train
; ing program at Stanford.
The first six months of the pro
gram, begining September 28, will |
j be spent in basic engineering train
ing such as the elements of mathe- j
| matics, engineering drafting, intro- j
; duction to shop practice, and engi- ,
j neeiing mechanics. The final six
| months will give specific training for
! work in airplane plants, the ship- |
j building industry, and other war
! work.
