# New Additions Make Drama Library Tops
## Library, Photographs, And Movie Scripts Head Recent Gifts 
### 
Recent additions to Stanford's
drama library make it probably the
outstanding American drama col
lection on the Pacific Coast, accord
ing to Dr. Nathan Van Patten, Direc
tor of University Libraries.
An important addition was the
collection presented by Miss Milli
cent Sears of Carmel, which includes
programs, clippings, photographs,
and brochures from as far back as
1832.
Purchased during the summer
months was the private library of
Barrett H. Clark, New York drama
critic, comprised of nearly 2,000 vol
umes and including many rare and
now unobtainable items.
The importance of the Sears col
lection, according to Dr. Hubert C.
HefTner, head of the Division of
Speech and Drama, is its use in
tracing the history of the produc
tions of the American theater. The
extensive clippings are also par
ticularly valuable as biographical
material.
Also included in the library is a
considerable collection of movie
scripts, presented by the studios, in
working condition, and a number
of sketches, drawings, and scale
models of movie sets. These are
useful both for instruction purposes
and 'as examples for student pro
ductions.
Students have had an active part
in building up the drama library. A
gift of $2,500 from Ram's Head and
Dramatic Council has made much of
the recent growth possible.
"It is our aim to build one of the
finest collections on American Drama
and the American theater in the na
tion," said Dr. Heffner in com
menting on the recent additions.
