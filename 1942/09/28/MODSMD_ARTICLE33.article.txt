The vital importance of the univer
sities is being better understood each
day as we go further into this vast,
modern, mechanical war. The sword
of the warrior is now replaced by
complicated machines that depend
for their efficacy upon expert build
ers and expert operators. The engi
neer, doctor, physicist, chemist, bac
teriologist, economist, geologist, me
teorologist, teacher, linguist, and so
on, cannot be trained off-hand, but
must be the product of years of study
under good instruction.
We must not lose sight of the fact,
too, that our complicated social world
cannot be understood without the
background of a general education.
You have come to Stanford to
prepare for an unknown future, but
one in which real preparation is im
portant both from your personal
standpoint and that of our nation.
We welcome you to Stanford. We
have sent hundi'eds, in fact thou
sands, of our men and women to all
parts of the world better equipped
for the many jobs which they have
to do. We expect you to develop
here. You must make your time
count; for time is moving fast, and
the United States is deciding its
destiny. You will need to keep well,
relax at times, keep your minds
clear and your bodies well and ac
tive. A properly balanced Univer
sity life will put you forward.
In short, be serious, but not too
serious to fill in the edges of the day
with sensible recreation and some
study of all that is going on about us.
