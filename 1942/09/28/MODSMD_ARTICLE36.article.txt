Stanford men and women, wel
come to the campus. You students
who are returning will find a changed
atmosphere. The pattern which was
beginning to form last winter and
spring was definitely set by a seri
oiis, practical, loyal student leader
ship during the Summer Quarter
just passed. You new students will
sense this spirit as soon as you ar
rive.
The grim realities of war—a war
we are losing at present—have so
bered our thinking and our actions.
There is no place now for the super
ficialities of life. Sound and efficient
investment of time, money, and en
ergy is necessary. The curriculum
has been streamlined and geared to
the war effort. A strenuous physi
cal fitness program is ready to func
tion. Your student leaders have
planned a program of purposeful ac
tivities for the campus in which you
are invited to participate.
In effect, you are asked by your
government to give up your freedom
for the duration in order that you
may preserve it for the future. You
are actually loaned to the Univer
sity for a period of training and drill
so that you will be ready when you
are called. To this end most of you
will enlist in one of the Reserve
Corps and be assigned to duty in the
University.
This is Stanford at war. I know
that you as loyal men and women
who love Stanford will accept the
challenge and will acquit yourselves
honorably and nobly. We all, the
administration and the faculty, are
eager to share with you. We extend
you the warmest welcome and wish
you the best of luck during this
school year.
John W. Bunn
Dean of Men
