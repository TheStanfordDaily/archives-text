# Luduena Reports On Asthma Drug
## 
### 
Repeated injections of high doses
of the widely used drug amino
phyllin for asthma are not safe, says
Dr. F. P. Luduena, acting professor
of pharmacology at the Stanford
University School of Medicine.
In therapeutic doses this effective
drug is relatively safe, but investi
gation has shown that the highest
tolerated doses of aminophyllin gave
evidence of slight irritation in the
meninges, or membranes of the
brain and spinal cord, and in the
kidneys.
Dr. Ludutna states that these ir
ritations would be minor considera
tions in the use of the drug in emer
gencies, as in intractable asthma,
where aminophyllin can give dra
matic and complete relief.
