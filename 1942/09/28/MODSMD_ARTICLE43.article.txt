# TIRE WEAR
## 
### 
Abnormal tire wear will result if
there is misalignment of the rear
wheels of the car. Misalignment is
often caused by a bent frame, a bent
rear housing, or slippage of one side
of the housing on the rear spring.
Rear wheels should have a correct
relationship with the front wheels in
order to follow the front end of the
car in a parallel position.

Incorrect brake lining in your car
will cause squeaking brakes, says
the California State Automobile As
sociation.
