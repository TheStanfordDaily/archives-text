Dimes for diplomas will begin its

collections each Monday evening at
all eating groups, announced Jim

Monday collections will be dime

last spring when it became apparent
that many men students, within a
quarter of graduation, were com
pelled to join the armed services.

war a number of students would then
be financially capable of finishing
their last quarter at Stanford with
dimes from the diploma drive. The
purpose of the dimes fund is to pay
tuitions for at least 50 of these un
dergraduates.

4,000 Spring Quarter enrollees, boost
ing the total fund to $1,781.
