# GUNS WON'T SAVE WORLD'-MUMFORD
## 
### MIKE KRESGE 
"If our free democratic world is
saved it will be saved, not just by
machines and guns, but by our ca
pacity to produce a higher type of
human being, whose will and purpose
are superior to those of the enemy,"
declared Lewis Mumford, professor
of the new School of Humanities, in
an interview with The Daily explain
ing the significance and purpose of
the school.
Professor Mumford recently ar
rived on the campus from the East
to take over his duties and to col
laborate with Arthur Bestor, Jr.,
formerly of Columbia University;
Desmond Powell, formerly of the
University of Arizona; and Jeffery
Smith, aliio from Columbia, in giv
ing the new basic junior course in
the Humanities Fall Quarter.
"The aim of this school will be
primarily to create better men and
women," explained Professor Mum
ford. "Its studies will be grounded
in the experience of the past, vital
ized by constant reference to the
present, and directed toward the
progressive mastering of the future.
It will attempt to develop people
who have an equal capacity to think
and feel and act; to think, not in
compartments, but in related wholes;
to feel and express their emotions
with the discipline that comes
through high art; and to act, not as
creatures of routine or as victims of
circumstances, but as fully purpo
sive and enlightened beings."
MAN IN ALL ASPECTS
The student will study the whole
of man in all his aspects, rather than

extreme specialization in any one
field. The latter, Professor Mumford
asserted, is one of the great disinte
grating forces of the world and has
become especially so in the last 30
years.
The well-known author and phi
losopher pointed out that in techni
cal refinement our machines have
often approached perfection, but that
no similar development has been
visible in the education of men.
According to Professor Mumford
if the social order of the post-war
period is to survive it must not ex
hibit the disastrous weaknesses
which helped to bring on the war,
but must be founded on a sounder
conception of man's personality, his
functions, his duties, his discipline
and his destiny. And it must first of
all rest on the belief that the per
fection of man is the chief end of

all man's institutions and inventions.
"Nine tailors may make a man,
but nine specialists are not a substi
tute for a complete human being,"
remarked Professor Mumford.
Professor Mumford concluded the
interview by saying, "In the renewed
cultivation of the humanities lies the
promise of a more enduring fruition
for humanity itself."

It will attempt to develop people
who have an equal capacity to think
and feel and act; to think, not in
compartments, but in related wholes;
to feel and express their emotions
with the discipline that comes
through high art; and to act, not as
creatures of routine or as victims of
circumstances, but as fully purpo
sive and enlightened beings."
MAN IN ALL ASPECTS
The student will study the whole
of man in all his aspects, rather than

extreme specialization in any one
field. The latter, Professor Mumford
asserted, is one of the great disinte
grating forces of the world and has
become especially so in the last 30
years.
The well-known author and phi
losopher pointed out that in techni
cal refinement our machines have
often approached perfection, but that
no similar development has been
visible in the education of men.
According to Professor Mumford
if the social order of the post-war
period is to survive it must not ex
hibit the disastrous weaknesses
which helped to bring on the war,
but must be founded on a sounder
conception of man's personality, his
functions, his duties, his discipline
and his destiny. And it must first of
all rest on the belief that the per
fection of man is the chief end of

all man's institutions and inventions.
"Nine tailors may make a man,
but nine specialists are not a substi
tute for a complete human being,"
remarked Professor Mumford.
Professor Mumford concluded the
interview by saying, "In the renewed
cultivation of the humanities lies the
promise of a more enduring fruition
for humanity itself."

"If our free democratic world is
