# ALL DEPARTMENTS
## 
### 
The School of Humanities will be
composed of the departments of Eng
lish, Germanic, Romanic and Slavic
languages, Classics, Graphic Arts,
History, Music, Philosophy, Reli
gion and Speech and Drama. Each
of these departments will have its
own departmental major, but, in ad
dition, there will be a school pro
gram leading to the A.B. in Hu
manities.

According to Professor John W.
Dodds, Dean of the new school, this
program will cut across the depart
ments and make use of the resources
of all the departments in planning a
well-wrought humanistic education.
The individual departments will be
active collaborators in the program
of the humanities school.
For the person interested in Hu
manities his time in school will be
roughly spent in this manner: West
ern Civilization in his freshman year,
American Civilization in his sopho
more year, the junior humanities
course in his junior year, and in his
senior year he will continue appro
priate course work but will also ex-
Lend his exploration into some set of
problems which has particularly ex
cited his interest. A seminar will
also be given for the person's spe
cific interest.
