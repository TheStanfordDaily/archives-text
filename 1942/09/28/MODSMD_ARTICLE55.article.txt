# Union Cellar Opens For Fall Service
## 
### 
The Cellar will open to serve full
meals on September 21, following a
period of partial or simplified service
which began on September 15.
Roble and Encina Halls will be
the first to reopen dining rooms
with their pre-registration dinners
on September 25. Supper on Sep
tember 27 will be the first meal
served in other dormitories.
All dining rooms on campus were
closed during a sixteen day period
for cleaning. The Cellar showed
most strain due to the unusual sum
mer enrollment, as well as less eat
ing off campus. An average of 500
as against a usual 300 or 400 sales
was estimated for the lunch hour
alone, according to Miss Christine
Ricker, Director of Dining Halls.
Ring-ups for the day were com
monly above 2,000, even though 50-
G0 per cent of such sales amounted
to no more than 5 cents individually.
