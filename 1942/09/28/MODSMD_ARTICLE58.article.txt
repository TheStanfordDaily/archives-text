# Conservation Council Saves Vital Materials
## Collins Heads Scrap Collection, Promotes Carless Wednesdays 
### 
Under the general direction of
Bob Collins, the Stanford Conser
vation Council will continue to aid
the government in conserving vital
war materials.
During the last school year the
council held rubber drives, scrap
drives, and consumer good 5 drives.
Also under the direction of the
Conservation Board was Carless
Wednesday, a co-operative plan to
aid in rubber conservation by ask
ing students not to drive their cars
on Wednesdays.
This coming quarter promises to
see more concentrated action by the
council in preventing waste of all
goods. As the government directs,
the council will endeavor to help
students to see just how they can
co-operate with the government in
the nation-wide conservation pro
grams.
