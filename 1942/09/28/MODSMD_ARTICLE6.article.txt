# FARM STUDENT BODY CHIEFS
## 
### 
September will mark the start of
a new quarter and the continuance
of a new system started for us this
summer. We realize how much it
means to continue an education when
world conditions are so disturbed,
and therefore try to fit even more
work into our college curriculum.
I think you will all find, however,
that besides the work there is plenty
of time for relaxation and we ef
fect,a fair balance between work and
play.
The stress on activity has been
toward promoting on-campus func
tions, and you will find that Stan
ford has a tremendous advantage
from this point of view. Fall Quar
ter, and the rest of the year too, will
provide an opportunity for hard
work and relaxing play as a part of
1946.

Vice-President, A.S.S.U.

On behalf of the Associated Stu
dents of Stanford University, I take
great pleasure in welcoming you new
freshmen and transfers to Stanford.
It is encouraging to see so many
of you planning to attend college
during these war times. You are to
be complimented on your decision
to obtain a college education, for
as many of our national leaders have
pointed out, "brains not brawn will
win this war." Because of their real
ization of the importance of having
our young men and women trained
in college, the various military serv
ices have offered numerous defer
ment plans to assure many of you
new students of completing your col
lege work.
We have just finished a highly
successful Summer Quarter. The
present war has put a more serious
emphasis on our work, but it has
also made us more unified and spir
ited. Many campus activities are
planned for the next year, and we
arc all looking forward to a fine
school year.
Ed Stamm
President, A.S.S.U.
