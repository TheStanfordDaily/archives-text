# Hay Region Students Help Harvest Crops
## 
### 
Students from Bay region univer
sities, colleges, and high schools
helped harvest crops in Santa Clara
and San Joaquin counties, and in
the North Bay area because of the
shortage of labor this summer.
an Francisco school opening was
postponed several days to allow the
students to help save the crops.
Many of the steady laborers had
taken positions in the shipyards or
other defense plants.
