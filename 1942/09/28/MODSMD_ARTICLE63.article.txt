## 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Stanford students returning for the new l!) 42-43 school year will notice
many improvements around campus. Foremost in the improvement line
is the new work that has been done in the freshman dormitory. Encinri
has undergone $.'>0.(100 worth of work that promises to transform the hall
into a highly desirable and modern living quarter.
The grounds between the Education Building and the Quad have been

planted with a new 10-foot lawn.''
J ho lawn was planted to correct the
faulty drainage on the eastern side
<il the Quad, according to J. W. Mc-
Donnell, Superintendent of Grounds.
TOP SOIL ADDED
New top soil was added to the !
ground as the old soil was removed,
and plants and shrubs were added
along Ihe border. The lawn has been i
regraded so that during the heavy '
rainfalls the water will not run
down into the underground base- !
ments on the south of the Quad.
A sprinkler system could not be
installed because of priorities, but a
system is expected to be added after
the war. The job was completed at
an estimated cost of about $2,000.
QUAD IMPROVEMENTS
Although hampered by war prior
ities, the University has made sev
eral improvements in the Inner
Quad. Room 50 in the Inner Quad
has a newly retiled roof. Part of the
building has been completely done
over. Room 50 will house the new
School of Humanities. The new roof
for the building is made of a higher
grade of tile and replaces the old
weather-beaten roof which leaked
badly.
Serra, the street in front of the
Hoover War Library, has been re
surfaced with seal coat to provide
better wear. Lomita and Santa Te
resa have also been resurfaced with
seal coating. ,
TREES REMOVED
Four big palm trees that recently
grew in the Inner Quad were re
moved by workmen this last Sum
mer Quarter when the trees threat
ened to grow up under the buildings.
A number of palm trees along Palm
Drive were also removed.
Workers have made attics and
loofs accessible to fire fighters by
building doors under the roofs of
many of the Inner Quad buildings.
FIRE FIGHTING
The doors have been arranged so
that in case of air attack firemen
may enter the attics with hoses and
other fire-fighting equipment. Be
fore the improvements were made
it was impossible to reach some of
the attacks, which were endangered
by fires in. an incendiary attack. All
campus buildings have now been
provided with buckets and sand and
other fire-fighting equipment.
Between the German Building and
Room 100, workers have built a
safety vault to store chemicals for
the School of Biology in case of air
raids. After the war it is planned
to turn the storeroom into a trans
former vault.
The cafeteria unit of the Union ]
dining hall has a new tile floor that
was built in at the close of Sum
mer Quarter.
