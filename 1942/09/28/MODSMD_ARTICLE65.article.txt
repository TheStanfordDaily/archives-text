# Farm to Present New Play Series
## Historical Writings To Interpreted 
### 
In cooperation with the new School
of Humanities the Stanford speech
and drama division will present a
series of plays and readings open to
the public and augmented by dis
cussions. Generally historical in se
quence the course will attempt to
relate the meaning of the plays and
readings to our own times.
According to Dr. Hubert Heffner,
head of the speech and drama divi
sion, one of the first plays to be
given in this series will be an an
cient Chinese masterpiece, recently
translated, and never before given
on the American stage. It is pos
sible, however, he said, that negotia
tions for its production will not be
successful.
