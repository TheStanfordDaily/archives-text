# Alderson Reports On Athlete's Foot
## 
### 
No single preparation has yet been
developed which can be successful
in treating all cases of athlete's foot
in all of its stages, Dr. Harry E.
Alderson, clinical professor of der
matology at the Stanford School of
Medicine, reports in the current issue
of the Stanford Medical Bulletin.
This is true because of the variety
of ways in which different individ
uals react to medicines applied in
treatment.
The use of phenol-camphor, re
cently announced in a Reader's Di
gest article by Paul De Kruif as a
single cure for the disease is not at
all advocated by Dr. Alderson. The
50-50 solution is an extremely pow
erful mixture and can do very seri
ous damage to the skin. Even gan
grene has been observed as a result
of the use of this treatment.
