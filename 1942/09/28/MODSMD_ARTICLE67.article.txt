# Engineering Sets Sought By WPB
## 
### 
A scarcity of drawing instruments i
has prompted the priorities Division I
of WPB to issue an SOS call to en
gineering graduates in the Pacific
Coast region to bring their unused
instruments out of hiding.
Officials explained that probably
90 per cent of all engineering grad
uates, during the last 40 or 50 years,
owns a set of drawing instruments
which are not being used. If alumni
would turn unused drawing sets into j
their alma maters for the war pro
gram, they would be easing a difficult
situation, it was stated.
