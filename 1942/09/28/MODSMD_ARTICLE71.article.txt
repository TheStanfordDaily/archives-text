## Administrators To Act On Resolution 
### 
The resolution lequiring students
to take a general survey course in
United States history adopted by a
conference of California college and
university teachers # here at Stanford
last week will soon he acted upon by
a committee of Stanford professors
and administrators; however, no defi
nite date has been set, according to
Edgar Eugene Robinson, head of the
University's history department.
The conference's resolution, Rob
inson stated, is merely a recommen
dation, and its fulfillment is solely
dependent upon each university.
Whether the requirement will af
fect those already enrolled in both
upper and lower division, or only
incoming students will depend upon
the legislation of the law when and
if it is passed by the university com
mittee.
The course, according to the con
ference's recommendations, should
cover the political and economic his
tory of the United States from its
discovery to the present, with "due
attention to social, cultural, and
other forces."
