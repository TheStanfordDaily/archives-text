# We Start Again

FROM all parts of the country they came
back to the little green shack halfway be
tween the postoffice and Lagunita to put out the
Autumn Quarter Pre-Reg edition. "They" are
the faithful members of the Stanford Daily staff
who abandoned lucrative jobs two weeks early
in order to put out a 12-page paper for the in
coming students.
Traditionally, about 25 members of the staff
who are interested in working on the paper
and who can tear themselves away from work,
labor like fools for three solid days writing,
editing, and proofreading copy.
From the Stanford Daily staff we welcome all
new Stanford students and hope that we can
continue to put out a paper which will be
worthy of the fine institution with which we are
proudly starting another year.
To be trite, we sincerely say that things will
be different this fall. Frankly, we don't envy
the new students because they will be missing
a lot of the tradition and fun of old. We are
here to work and to get as much out of our
college years as possible.
The war has caused the cancellation of our
Big Game bonfire. The parades and other cele
brations will be restricted because of the limited
supply of fuel and tires. But we do have one
advantage with this new program—our enter
tainment will be focused here on the campus,
eliminating the necessity of long rides to San
Francisco and other nearby amusement centers.
Even the amount of time the student spends
in the University has been cut down. Last
summer a new record for undergraduates at
tending Summer School was established, for
many of us found it to our advantage to try to
finish our education as soon as possible before
the long arm of Uncle Sam and his draft board
cohorts clutched us away from our school.
Next summer will find many of you cultivat
ing beautiful tans on the way to class, for Stan
ford has definitely switched to the four-quarter
system for the duration.
You will like Stanford's traditions. Although
many of them have become things of the past,
there are still many which should last until the
registrar stops asking for tuition. We think the
Rides to Paly tradition is the most important.
Those who will be fortunate enough to have
cars and still be able to drive them should pick
up students who will be waiting in front of
Encina, at the Y turn on Palm Drive, at Wilson's,
or at the beginning of Palm Drive.
Mrs. Stanford asked that students do not
smoke on the Quad. There has been much pro
test concerning this campaign by those who
say such a dispute doesn't matter when we
have a bigger problem on our hands—the
winning of the war by the United Nations. But
we maintained last summer and continue to
maintain that if students cannot co-operate in
such small matters, how can they be expected
to help with things that really count?
One of our newer traditions which has be
come a habit the past two quarters is the buying
of War Bonds and Stamps every Thursday
night. We still have a long way to go in this
effort, but Stanford has truly taken part in this
program wholeheartedly.
As for The Daily and campaigns, we plan to
do our part in promoting all-out victory for the
United Nations. We feel that by securing for
ourselves the best possible education while we
are at school we can contribute much now and
more later to a better world order.
Thus The Daily starts the second half of
Volume 102.

cars and still be able to drive them should pick
up students who will be waiting in front of
Encina, at the Y turn on Palm Drive, at Wilson's,
or at the beginning of Palm Drive.
Mrs. Stanford asked that students do not
smoke on the Quad. There has been much pro
test concerning this campaign by those who
say such a dispute doesn't matter when we
have a bigger problem on our hands—the
winning of the war by the United Nations. But
we maintained last summer and continue to
maintain that if students cannot co-operate in
such small matters, how can they be expected
to help with things that really count?
One of our newer traditions which has be
come a habit the past two quarters is the buying
of War Bonds and Stamps every Thursday
night. We still have a long way to go in this
effort, but Stanford has truly taken part in this
program wholeheartedly.
As for The Daily and campaigns, we plan to
do our part in promoting all-out victory for the
United Nations. We feel that by securing for
ourselves the best possible education while we
are at school we can contribute much now and
more later to a better world order.
Thus The Daily starts the second half of
Volume 102.
FROM all parts of the country they came
back to the little green shack halfway be
tween the postoffice and Lagunita to put out the
Autumn Quarter Pre-Reg edition. "They" are
the faithful members of the Stanford Daily staff
who abandoned lucrative jobs two weeks early
in order to put out a 12-page paper for the in
coming students.
Traditionally, about 25 members of the staff
who are interested in working on the paper
and who can tear themselves away from work,
labor like fools for three solid days writing,
editing, and proofreading copy.
From the Stanford Daily staff we welcome all
new Stanford students and hope that we can
continue to put out a paper which will be
worthy of the fine institution with which we are
proudly starting another year.
To be trite, we sincerely say that things will
be different this fall. Frankly, we don't envy
the new students because they will be missing
a lot of the tradition and fun of old. We are
here to work and to get as much out of our
college years as possible.
The war has caused the cancellation of our
Big Game bonfire. The parades and other cele
brations will be restricted because of the limited
supply of fuel and tires. But we do have one
advantage with this new program—our enter
tainment will be focused here on the campus,
eliminating the necessity of long rides to San
Francisco and other nearby amusement centers.
Even the amount of time the student spends
in the University has been cut down. Last
summer a new record for undergraduates at
tending Summer School was established, for
many of us found it to our advantage to try to
finish our education as soon as possible before
the long arm of Uncle Sam and his draft board
cohorts clutched us away from our school.
Next summer will find many of you cultivat
ing beautiful tans on the way to class, for Stan
ford has definitely switched to the four-quarter
system for the duration.
You will like Stanford's traditions. Although
many of them have become things of the past,
there are still many which should last until the
registrar stops asking for tuition. We think the
Rides to Paly tradition is the most important.
Those who will be fortunate enough to have
cars and still be able to drive them should pick
up students who will be waiting in front of
Encina, at the Y turn on Palm Drive, at Wilson's,
or at the beginning of Palm Drive.
