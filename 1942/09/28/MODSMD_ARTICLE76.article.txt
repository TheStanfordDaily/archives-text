# Leave Your Car
## 
### 
ONE northern college has asked that all
students leave their cars home. To many
this seems like a slap in the face, an ultimatum
which denies the students freedom of choice.
To date Stanford has not officially sent out
such a request, and it is hoped that such an
order will not be forthcoming.
Obviously, many students find it more con
venient to drive to school than to take a train
or bus, BUT no intelligent student is oblivious
to the fact that if things continue in their pres
ent line, we won't be able to use cars at all.
So, if you do not absolutely need your car,
why not leave it home and save that vital caso
line for our armed forces?
