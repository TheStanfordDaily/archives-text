PEACE, ITS WONDERFUL!
Such a peace, most (non-Axis) people will agree,
is to be attained by a world-wide establishment of
what President Roosevelt has termed "the four free
doms," freedom of religion and information and free
dom from want and fear.
That the attempt to secure or deny one or more
of these freedoms, and all that they imply, has been at
the root of every war since the earliest times, is not
to be doubted; and so it is logical to presume, as phi
losophers have for the past couple of centuries, that
if these freedoms were guaranteed to all, not to the
victor alone, the Second Horseman might be perma
nently dismounted.
Now opposed to this logic, which, as reflection
will demonstrate, is neither more nor less than an
attempt to enact the Golden Rule into international
law, is the perfectly natural feeling that the Axis
must he punished. Such a feeling is not Christian
nor, considering the efTccts of other peace settlements
that attempted punishment, is it wise; but tell that
to the conquered peoples!

Should Germany be turned over to an occupation
force of Poles and Greeks? Should Japan be turned
over to the Chinese and Koreans? Should we let
bygones be bygones and require no more of Germany
than the establishment of a liberal government and
such restitution as will not force her again to eco
nomic disaster? These arc obvious problems and arc ob
viously immediate and pressing. Some will say that
the problem of winning the war is even more ob
vious, and far more immediate, but what good would
it be to win the war and then again lose the peace?
Even if we accept the principle of "peace without
victory," what is to be done? The Atlantic Charter, to
which the United Nations have adhered, l'avors equal
access to resources and raw materials for all, freedom
of the seas, international economic collaboration, na
tional self-determination, disarmament of the aggres
sors as a preliminary to general disarmament, and
lasting peace. One comment was that the Charter was
the greatest public document since the Republican
platform of 1936, and certainly some criticism is justi
fied, since the paper answers few questions and poses
several new ones.
The most promising of the recent plans is that ad
vanced by E. H. Carr, editorialist of the London Times,
in a recent book. He proposes to suspend political mat
ters after the war until the economic reconstruction of
Europe has been put under way, under the direction of
a single authority, a European Planning Commission.
This plan has the merit of not attempting to force a
solution of involved political problems on masses of
people to whom a loaf of bread is of much greater
interest. Moreover the period of several years allowed
for the beginnings of reconstruction would serve as a
"cooling-off" period in which reason might overrule
the passions of victory and defeat.
, I have here stated a few of the problems of a
peace settlement, a few of the proposals already
made, and given some comment on these problems
and proposals. This is not, by any means, intended
to be a last word. This is intended as a first word.
The problems of a lasting peacc will be discussed in
this column (while it is under my jurisdiction) until,
God willing, every reader, and all his friends and
family, have discussed the subject and, for better or
worse, made their minds up about it. For it is only
by such a process that positive public opinion can be
built up, and it is imperative that there be such a
positive popular attitude.
