### CHESLEY SAROYAN 
SUMMER SUMMER
BY the time this issue of The Daily reaches you,
the summer will be over. A lot of things have hap
pened during the past summer. I have seen a few new
things. I have thought about a few new things. I have
learned a few new things, mostly mathematics for V-7.
On the whole the past summer has been profitable for
me.
I hope that it was profitable for you.
I hope that you had a good time.
I hope that you got a nice, brown tan, and put on
a white shirt and looked at yourself in the mirror. I
hope that you ran and perspired and felt the muscles
of your legs. I hope that you met an exciting person,
a person whom you loved sincerely and one who loved
you sincerely even if it lasted for only a month. I
hope that you had long talks with your mother and
father, and sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes and
kidded with your grandmother 1 . I hope that you
jumped in water, and felt cool and fine.
* * * *
x HOPE that you read some books.
I hope that you read a little of Tchekov, a little
of Shaw, something by John Steinbeck, a play by Sean
O'Casey that I read over three times, and maybe even
a little of the hard reading by John Dewey.
I hope you did so that your mind was not asleep.
I hope that you walked on grass in your bare feet,
and had the grass tickle your feet and make them feel
good. I hope you saw the sunrise a couple of times.
I hope that you listened to music.
♦ * * *
BUT most important of all, I hope that you sat in
your room, or took long walks by yourself and
looked at the things around you and looked at yourself
and tried to understand what it was all about. What
is it? What does it mean to be alive in the world in
the year 1,942? What is the world? What is a man?
What should a person try to do during the short time
that he is living? What is it all about?
I hope you thought about all these things, because
if you did you were happy.
If you did, you were active and thoughtful.
We are the most fortunate of this generation. We
are the children of the rich. We are the ones that do
not have to worry about our food, our clothing, our
housing, at least not in the same intense degree that the
rest of the world has to worry about these things.
We have spare time.
We should use our spare time in the best possible
way.
♦ * * *
IF anyone should be conscious, aware, alert, alive,
active, productive, it must be us. We arc the ones
that the world is depending on. We arc the ones who
are getting the opportunities. Wc are the ones who
must change (he world and make it more habitable.
Wc are the ones who must hate evil. We are the ones
who must love good. The world is depending on us,
a world that is confused and shaken is depending on
us, and we must make the most out of every moment,
out of every opportunity, this coming year. This com
ing year, we must use our autumn, our winter, our
spring, we must use our libraries, our laboratories,
our professors, the knowledge that is available to us,
we must use them and with them create weapons with
which we can fight the forces of terror, prejudice,
narrowness, and hatred, and we must use them to
create instruments with which to build a world that is
even greater and happier than the world of our mothers
and fathers. The world is depending on us, and we
must do it.

pened during the past summer. I have seen a few new
things. I have thought about a few new things. I have
learned a few new things, mostly mathematics for V-7.
On the whole the past summer has been profitable for
me.
I hope that it was profitable for you.
I hope that you had a good time.
I hope that you got a nice, brown tan, and put on
a white shirt and looked at yourself in the mirror. I
hope that you ran and perspired and felt the muscles
of your legs. I hope that you met an exciting person,
a person whom you loved sincerely and one who loved
you sincerely even if it lasted for only a month. I
hope that you had long talks with your mother and
father, and sipped coffee and smoked cigarettes and
kidded with your grandmother 1 . I hope that you
jumped in water, and felt cool and fine.
* * * *
x HOPE that you read some books.
I hope that you read a little of Tchekov, a little
of Shaw, something by John Steinbeck, a play by Sean
O'Casey that I read over three times, and maybe even
a little of the hard reading by John Dewey.
I hope you did so that your mind was not asleep.
I hope that you walked on grass in your bare feet,
and had the grass tickle your feet and make them feel
good. I hope you saw the sunrise a couple of times.
I hope that you listened to music.
♦ * * *
BUT most important of all, I hope that you sat in
your room, or took long walks by yourself and
looked at the things around you and looked at yourself
and tried to understand what it was all about. What
is it? What does it mean to be alive in the world in
the year 1,942? What is the world? What is a man?
What should a person try to do during the short time
that he is living? What is it all about?
I hope you thought about all these things, because
if you did you were happy.
If you did, you were active and thoughtful.
We are the most fortunate of this generation. We
are the children of the rich. We are the ones that do
not have to worry about our food, our clothing, our
housing, at least not in the same intense degree that the
rest of the world has to worry about these things.
We have spare time.
We should use our spare time in the best possible
way.
♦ * * *
IF anyone should be conscious, aware, alert, alive,
active, productive, it must be us. We arc the ones
that the world is depending on. We arc the ones who
are getting the opportunities. Wc are the ones who
must change (he world and make it more habitable.
Wc are the ones who must hate evil. We are the ones
who must love good. The world is depending on us,
a world that is confused and shaken is depending on
us, and we must make the most out of every moment,
out of every opportunity, this coming year. This com
ing year, we must use our autumn, our winter, our
spring, we must use our libraries, our laboratories,
our professors, the knowledge that is available to us,
we must use them and with them create weapons with
which we can fight the forces of terror, prejudice,
narrowness, and hatred, and we must use them to
create instruments with which to build a world that is
even greater and happier than the world of our mothers
and fathers. The world is depending on us, and we
must do it.
