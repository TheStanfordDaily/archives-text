# Defense Group Reorganizes
## 
### 
As Stanford moves into its Fall
Quarter schedule, the first Fall Quar
ter under war conditions, the Civil
ian Defense Council on the campus
will be reorganized for the coming
school year.
Because the personnel of the body
changes so often, due to members
leaving school, reorganization is a
full-time process.
"We are requesting students to
volunteer for the various branches
immediately," Alfred R. Masters, ex
ecutive director of the Civilian De
fense Council said, pointing out that
it is imperative to develop the or
ganization immediately to the point
where it can function smoothly.
"It is contemplated that we will
make up our auxiliary fire and police
squads from the R.O.T.C. units," Mr.
Masters said, "but it is necessary to
enlist volunteers to man the first aid
stations and to act as messengers."
There will be rehearsals as soon
after the crews have been developed
as is practicable, according to Mr.
Masters, who is of the opinion that
such action is necessary to get the
organization back on a good operat
ing basis.
Mr. Masters also pointed out that
it is imperative that each department
head supervise in detail the work of
his department in order that the or
ganization would not be slowed
down.
Furthermore, he said, it is the in
dividual's responsibility to look oul
for the safety of his own living
group, for, since the University's
auxiliary fire and police crews are
not large enough to handle more
than the University buildings, the
residents of each living group will
have to be prepared to protect their
homes in the event of disaster.

Passengers should not horseplay in
a car, thereby distracting the driver's
attention.
