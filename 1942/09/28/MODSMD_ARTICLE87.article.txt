### H. D. THOREAU 
The Daily's Grid Analyst
Put California's ends with Stanford's line in front of Southern Cali
fornia's backfield, and give them Oregon State's Pacific Coast Conference
and Rose Bowl championships. That's the outlook for the coming months.
The experts agree in picking the Bears as the logical champ on their
showing last season in whipping the Indian T, 1(5-0, plus their potent

freshman aggregation of last year,,
but each of these experts leaves him
self an out by picking a dark-horse
that "might well upset the dope."
In this, The Daily's exclusive P.C.C.
grid forecast, the Indians and Tro
jans are picked as the logical winners
with California holding the position
of the dark-horse. But these three
teams will have to be excellent to
finish ahead of the Beavers, who, by
their coach's own admission, will be
as strong as last year s championship
team.
So that this forecast will not be
accused of evading the issue and
mincing words, with eight deft
strokes it cuts off the limb on which
it is sitting:
1. Southern California
2. Stanford
3. California
4. Oregon Slate
5. Washington
(i. Washington Slate
7. IJ.C.L.A.
X. Oregon
Idaho and Montana, although still
forcing themselves on the rest of
the conference, do not bear rating.
Analyzing the teams individually
the following statements became
evident:
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA—New
Coach Jeff Cravath seems destined
to bring the Trojans a daring kind ofi
football not seen on Bovard Field
since Gloomy Gus Henderson left in
'25. Backfield talent as personified
by McCardle, Finney, Manning, Mu
sick, Bleeker, Kroll, Bledsoe, Taylor,
Whitney, and Jamieson, plus the
speed of trackmen Trout, Browning,
and Calalnan, give S.C. three good
back fields as in the steam-roller of
yore. If replacements can be found
for tackles Wilier and Audet, only
a draft board will be able to stop a
New Year's Day move from Univer
sity Avenue to Pasadena.
STANFORD-A complete mystery,
but sec column 8.
CALIFORNIA—Much is expected
from sophomores Dodds, Peiper,
Rowe, Rawn, and Honegger. The
team's success as a whole depends
on their success. Veterans Ferguson,
