# Cravath's Trojans Rated Tops, Stanford Second In Coast Gridiron Battle
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
The Daily's Grid Analyst
Put California's ends with Stanford's line in front of Southern Cali
fornia's backfield, and give them Oregon State's Pacific Coast Conference
and Rose Bowl championships. That's the outlook for the coming months.
The experts agree in picking the Bears as the logical champ on their
showing last season in whipping the Indian T, 1(5-0, plus their potent

freshman aggregation of last year,,
but each of these experts leaves him
self an out by picking a dark-horse
that "might well upset the dope."
In this, The Daily's exclusive P.C.C.
grid forecast, the Indians and Tro
jans are picked as the logical winners
with California holding the position
of the dark-horse. But these three
teams will have to be excellent to
finish ahead of the Beavers, who, by
their coach's own admission, will be
as strong as last year s championship
team.
So that this forecast will not be
accused of evading the issue and
mincing words, with eight deft
strokes it cuts off the limb on which
it is sitting:
1. Southern California
2. Stanford
3. California
4. Oregon Slate
5. Washington
(i. Washington Slate
7. IJ.C.L.A.
X. Oregon
Idaho and Montana, although still
forcing themselves on the rest of
the conference, do not bear rating.
Analyzing the teams individually
the following statements became
evident:
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA—New
Coach Jeff Cravath seems destined
to bring the Trojans a daring kind ofi
football not seen on Bovard Field
since Gloomy Gus Henderson left in
'25. Backfield talent as personified
by McCardle, Finney, Manning, Mu
sick, Bleeker, Kroll, Bledsoe, Taylor,
Whitney, and Jamieson, plus the
speed of trackmen Trout, Browning,
and Calalnan, give S.C. three good
back fields as in the steam-roller of
yore. If replacements can be found
for tackles Wilier and Audet, only
a draft board will be able to stop a
New Year's Day move from Univer
sity Avenue to Pasadena.
STANFORD-A complete mystery,
but sec column 8.
CALIFORNIA—Much is expected
from sophomores Dodds, Peiper,
Rowe, Rawn, and Honegger. The
team's success as a whole depends
on their success. Veterans Ferguson,
L< idhol), ITerrcro, Christiansen, Ma
sun, Reinhard, and Graves leave four
important holes to be filled. Coach
Si ill) Allison has material to deal
with, but at the same time he has
iric xperience to contend with. A
10i.1j.5h schedule faces the Bears, with
games on ten consecutive Saturdays.
OJIKGON STATE —No adequate
substitutes have yet been found for
Don Durdan and Bob Dethman at
lh< halfback positions, and until they
are, Lon Stiner does not have an
other championship team. Such men
as George Zellick, George Bain,
Lloyd Wickett, Boyd Clement, War
ren Simas, Joe Day, and Choc Shel
ton do, however, bode of a defense
that will cause many red-hot teams
some tepid afternoons.
WASHINGTON — The Husky
strength can be summed up in Walt
Harrison, a mighty, roving center,
Arnold Weinmeister, a highly prom
ising soph flankman, and Bobby Er
ickson, a left scatback of no little
distinction. Coach Pest Welch will
undoubtedly put eight other men on
the field at a time to pose in the
other positions, but whether their
presence will prove of greater nui
sance value to these three stars or
to the opponents, Mr. Welch will
know along about the first of Oc
tober.
WASHINGTON STATE — Babe
Hollingberry's upsetting eleven of
last season had versatile Billy Sewell
and persistent Bob Kennedy in the
backfield, Dale Gentry and Nick
Susoeff, two spoilers at the ends, and
an unobtrusive but effective line.

The line, however, is now so unob
trusive that the opposition can be
expected to brush it aside.
U.C.L.A.—As one writer said, "The
Bruins can be the surprise team of
the coast," but as this writer is now
saying, "They won't."
On paper the Westwoodians look
good, but like paper in a game they
only seem to fold up. Bob Water
field, their returning quarterback,
was the league-leading passer of last
season; George Phillips, their full
back who is also returning, was the
leading punter. All Coach Horrell
must do now is find a league-lead
ing runner, and then he can start
looking for a line.
OREGON—The Ducks should even
have some trouble handling Idaho
this fall. The rest of their games will
be breezes—for the opposition. Stan
ford, however, is not fortunate
enough to draw any of the benefits
of this breeze, since the Indians also
finally managed to sign up Idaho.
The Ducks' best talent migrated to
the Navy school at St. Mary's along
with their coach, Tex Oliver.
As for the independent teams, the
same two words apply to Santa Clara
that have been used for the past ten
years, "Always tough."
II Jimmy Phelan can bring his St.
Mary's Gaels though their mid
week scrimmages with the Naval
Pre-Flight School powerhouse at
Moraga, he will be doing all that can
be expected of one man.
As for the sailors themselves,
they'll do all right as long as the
Army doesn't start drafting from the
Navy.

backfield, Dale Gentry and Nick
Susoeff, two spoilers at the ends, and
an unobtrusive but effective line.

The line, however, is now so unob
trusive that the opposition can be
expected to brush it aside.
U.C.L.A.—As one writer said, "The
Bruins can be the surprise team of
the coast," but as this writer is now
saying, "They won't."
On paper the Westwoodians look
good, but like paper in a game they
only seem to fold up. Bob Water
field, their returning quarterback,
was the league-leading passer of last
season; George Phillips, their full
back who is also returning, was the
leading punter. All Coach Horrell
must do now is find a league-lead
ing runner, and then he can start
looking for a line.
OREGON—The Ducks should even
have some trouble handling Idaho
this fall. The rest of their games will
be breezes—for the opposition. Stan
ford, however, is not fortunate
enough to draw any of the benefits
of this breeze, since the Indians also
finally managed to sign up Idaho.
The Ducks' best talent migrated to
the Navy school at St. Mary's along
with their coach, Tex Oliver.
As for the independent teams, the
same two words apply to Santa Clara
that have been used for the past ten
years, "Always tough."
II Jimmy Phelan can bring his St.
Mary's Gaels though their mid
week scrimmages with the Naval
Pre-Flight School powerhouse at
Moraga, he will be doing all that can
be expected of one man.
As for the sailors themselves,
they'll do all right as long as the
Army doesn't start drafting from the
Navy.
The Daily's Grid Analyst
Put California's ends with Stanford's line in front of Southern Cali
fornia's backfield, and give them Oregon State's Pacific Coast Conference
and Rose Bowl championships. That's the outlook for the coming months.
The experts agree in picking the Bears as the logical champ on their
showing last season in whipping the Indian T, 1(5-0, plus their potent

freshman aggregation of last year,,
but each of these experts leaves him
self an out by picking a dark-horse
that "might well upset the dope."
In this, The Daily's exclusive P.C.C.
grid forecast, the Indians and Tro
jans are picked as the logical winners
with California holding the position
of the dark-horse. But these three
teams will have to be excellent to
finish ahead of the Beavers, who, by
their coach's own admission, will be
as strong as last year s championship
team.
So that this forecast will not be
accused of evading the issue and
mincing words, with eight deft
strokes it cuts off the limb on which
it is sitting:
1. Southern California
2. Stanford
3. California
4. Oregon Slate
5. Washington
(i. Washington Slate
7. IJ.C.L.A.
X. Oregon
Idaho and Montana, although still
forcing themselves on the rest of
the conference, do not bear rating.
Analyzing the teams individually
the following statements became
evident:
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA—New
Coach Jeff Cravath seems destined
to bring the Trojans a daring kind ofi
football not seen on Bovard Field
since Gloomy Gus Henderson left in
'25. Backfield talent as personified
by McCardle, Finney, Manning, Mu
sick, Bleeker, Kroll, Bledsoe, Taylor,
Whitney, and Jamieson, plus the
speed of trackmen Trout, Browning,
and Calalnan, give S.C. three good
back fields as in the steam-roller of
yore. If replacements can be found
for tackles Wilier and Audet, only
a draft board will be able to stop a
New Year's Day move from Univer
sity Avenue to Pasadena.
STANFORD-A complete mystery,
but sec column 8.
CALIFORNIA—Much is expected
from sophomores Dodds, Peiper,
Rowe, Rawn, and Honegger. The
team's success as a whole depends
on their success. Veterans Ferguson,
L< idhol), ITerrcro, Christiansen, Ma
sun, Reinhard, and Graves leave four
important holes to be filled. Coach
Si ill) Allison has material to deal
with, but at the same time he has
iric xperience to contend with. A
10i.1j.5h schedule faces the Bears, with
games on ten consecutive Saturdays.
OJIKGON STATE —No adequate
substitutes have yet been found for
Don Durdan and Bob Dethman at
lh< halfback positions, and until they
are, Lon Stiner does not have an
other championship team. Such men
as George Zellick, George Bain,
Lloyd Wickett, Boyd Clement, War
ren Simas, Joe Day, and Choc Shel
ton do, however, bode of a defense
that will cause many red-hot teams
some tepid afternoons.
WASHINGTON — The Husky
strength can be summed up in Walt
Harrison, a mighty, roving center,
Arnold Weinmeister, a highly prom
ising soph flankman, and Bobby Er
ickson, a left scatback of no little
distinction. Coach Pest Welch will
undoubtedly put eight other men on
the field at a time to pose in the
other positions, but whether their
presence will prove of greater nui
sance value to these three stars or
to the opponents, Mr. Welch will
know along about the first of Oc
tober.

from sophomores Dodds, Peiper,
Rowe, Rawn, and Honegger. The
team's success as a whole depends
on their success. Veterans Ferguson,
L< idhol), ITerrcro, Christiansen, Ma
sun, Reinhard, and Graves leave four
important holes to be filled. Coach
Si ill) Allison has material to deal
with, but at the same time he has
iric xperience to contend with. A
10i.1j.5h schedule faces the Bears, with
games on ten consecutive Saturdays.
OJIKGON STATE —No adequate
substitutes have yet been found for
Don Durdan and Bob Dethman at
lh< halfback positions, and until they
are, Lon Stiner does not have an
other championship team. Such men
as George Zellick, George Bain,
Lloyd Wickett, Boyd Clement, War
ren Simas, Joe Day, and Choc Shel
ton do, however, bode of a defense
that will cause many red-hot teams
some tepid afternoons.
WASHINGTON — The Husky
strength can be summed up in Walt
Harrison, a mighty, roving center,
Arnold Weinmeister, a highly prom
ising soph flankman, and Bobby Er
ickson, a left scatback of no little
distinction. Coach Pest Welch will
undoubtedly put eight other men on
the field at a time to pose in the
other positions, but whether their
presence will prove of greater nui
sance value to these three stars or
to the opponents, Mr. Welch will
know along about the first of Oc
tober.
WASHINGTON STATE — Babe
Hollingberry's upsetting eleven of
last season had versatile Billy Sewell
and persistent Bob Kennedy in the
backfield, Dale Gentry and Nick
Susoeff, two spoilers at the ends, and
an unobtrusive but effective line.

The line, however, is now so unob
trusive that the opposition can be
expected to brush it aside.
U.C.L.A.—As one writer said, "The
Bruins can be the surprise team of
the coast," but as this writer is now
saying, "They won't."
On paper the Westwoodians look
good, but like paper in a game they
only seem to fold up. Bob Water
field, their returning quarterback,
was the league-leading passer of last
season; George Phillips, their full
back who is also returning, was the
leading punter. All Coach Horrell
must do now is find a league-lead
ing runner, and then he can start
looking for a line.
OREGON—The Ducks should even
have some trouble handling Idaho
this fall. The rest of their games will
be breezes—for the opposition. Stan
ford, however, is not fortunate
enough to draw any of the benefits
of this breeze, since the Indians also
finally managed to sign up Idaho.
The Ducks' best talent migrated to
the Navy school at St. Mary's along
with their coach, Tex Oliver.
As for the independent teams, the
same two words apply to Santa Clara
that have been used for the past ten
years, "Always tough."
II Jimmy Phelan can bring his St.
Mary's Gaels though their mid
week scrimmages with the Naval
Pre-Flight School powerhouse at
Moraga, he will be doing all that can
be expected of one man.
As for the sailors themselves,
they'll do all right as long as the
Army doesn't start drafting from the
Navy.
The Daily's Grid Analyst
Put California's ends with Stanford's line in front of Southern Cali
fornia's backfield, and give them Oregon State's Pacific Coast Conference
and Rose Bowl championships. That's the outlook for the coming months.
The experts agree in picking the Bears as the logical champ on their
showing last season in whipping the Indian T, 1(5-0, plus their potent

freshman aggregation of last year,,
but each of these experts leaves him
self an out by picking a dark-horse
that "might well upset the dope."
In this, The Daily's exclusive P.C.C.
grid forecast, the Indians and Tro
jans are picked as the logical winners
with California holding the position
of the dark-horse. But these three
teams will have to be excellent to
finish ahead of the Beavers, who, by
their coach's own admission, will be
as strong as last year s championship
team.
So that this forecast will not be
accused of evading the issue and
mincing words, with eight deft
strokes it cuts off the limb on which
it is sitting:
1. Southern California
2. Stanford
3. California
4. Oregon Slate
5. Washington

7. IJ.C.L.A.
X. Oregon
Idaho and Montana, although still
forcing themselves on the rest of
the conference, do not bear rating.
Analyzing the teams individually
the following statements became
evident:
SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA—New
Coach Jeff Cravath seems destined
to bring the Trojans a daring kind ofi
football not seen on Bovard Field
since Gloomy Gus Henderson left in
'25. Backfield talent as personified
by McCardle, Finney, Manning, Mu
sick, Bleeker, Kroll, Bledsoe, Taylor,
Whitney, and Jamieson, plus the
speed of trackmen Trout, Browning,
and Calalnan, give S.C. three good
back fields as in the steam-roller of
yore. If replacements can be found
for tackles Wilier and Audet, only
a draft board will be able to stop a
New Year's Day move from Univer
sity Avenue to Pasadena.
