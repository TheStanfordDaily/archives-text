# Wilcox Works With Papeese
## 
### BILL STEIF 
The husky, blond young man
whom Stanford grid addicts will see
strolling along the sidelines during
frosh games this fall is not to be
taken as one of the Farm's up-and
coming All-Americans.
He will be, rather, the new Papoose
mentor, Francis (Willie) Wilcox, who
made something near to an Ail-
American name for himself at
Creighton University in Omaha just
a few yeax-s back.
Wilcox is supposed to be the un
known quantity on this year's coach
ing staff, for he and his record are
comparatively unknown on the west
coast. As a matter of fact, this is not
strictly true, because Wilcox coming
to a school at which Marchie
Schwartz is head coach is virtually
like coming home for the new frosh
coach. This is because it was Marchie
who between 1933 and 1937 coached
the Creighton team on which Wilcox
starred.
COMPILES BIG RECORD
Wilcox, in those years, compiled
quite a record for himself. He won
three football letters and at his left
halfback post was named All-Mis
souri Valley Conference in 1935 and
1936. In 1936 he also received All-
American honorable mention. In ad
dition, he dabbled in basketball and
was also good enough at the cage
game to earn his letter.
The new coach says that he re
ceived his greatest disappointment
in 1936 against Marquette, then a
Rose Bowl prospect. Wilcox that
Saturday intercepted a Marquette
pass and scored. But Creighton
failed to make the extra point and
finally Marquette shoved across a
touchdown and followed it up with
the extra pointâ€”"a real heartbreak
er," says Wilcox.
ONLY ONE DEFEAT
Since his graduation from Creigh
ton in 1937 Wilcox has been coach
ing middle western high schools.
Last year his Cheyenne, Wyoming,
high school club went through its
entire season with only one defeat
against nine wins.
Married, good-looking Wilcox has
no predictions to make about this
! year's frosh team since the Papeese
began practice Sept. 21. He has,
however, adapted himself to the T
easily after coaching the Notre Dame
j system for three years, and, if his
past record is worth the paper it is
written on, "Willie" Wilcox and his
freshmen may really have something
to show.
