Stanford men will aid the war ef
fort by being physically fit!
By action of the Academic Council
last June new regulations were
passed to insure this. All under
graduate men except those seniors in
their last quarter of residence, men
with serious physical defects, and
students over 25 years old will be
required to register for physical
education each quarter.
All men, excluding the exceptions,
must take and pass at least one
course in each of the five areas into
which the sports have been divided.
TEAM SPORTS
Team sports make up the first area
and include such sports as football,
basketball, baseball, and rugby. In
dividual sports comprise the second
area, track and field, tennis, golf,
skiing, handball, and other similar
sports being included in it.
Aquatic sports make up the third
area. Combative sports such as box
ing, wrestling, and fencing are in
cluded in the fourth area. The last
area is gymnastics, utilizing tum
bling and apparatus work.
FITNESS TEST
The second feature of the fitness
program is the physical fitness test.
This test will be given during the
first week of classes to all under
graduate men with the exception
of seniors and those excused by the
men's medical adviser.
Students who fail to take the test
at the time provided for it will be
required to pay for a test at a later
date.
The components of the physical
fitness test are strength, agility, en
durance, and co-ordination. The
strength test includes chinning,
push-ups, standing broad jump, and
sit-ups. Agility is tested by the
Burpee test. The Burpee movement
is started from the standing posi
tion. As the hands are placed in the
vicinity of the feet the legs are ex
tended backward. They are imme
diately returned to the squatting
position after which the erect po
sition is assumed again. This com
plete movement is repeated as often
as possible in a twenty-second in
terval of time.
RUN FOR ENDURANCE
Endurance is tested by the 6-sec
ond run and the 300-yard run. Co
ordination is established by the
shuttle run.
Three hundred Stanford freshmen
were tested in the fall of 1941. The
test revealed that 3'A of those tested
could not chin one time; 19' A could
not chin five times; 7% could not
push-up (parallel bars) one time;
49'/ could not push-up five times;
12 f A could not vault an obstacle
waist high; and 25''k could not swim
50 yards.
STANDARDS LISTED
Dr. A. A. Esslinger, Director of
Physical Education, has suggested
; the following standards for some of
the events in the test. The figures
in parentheses are standard for the
| superior "fit" man such as com
! mandos or paratroopers, while the
other figures are standard for the
I average "fit" man.
Chinning, 10 (16); broad jump, 7
! feet 6 inches (8 feet 6 inches); Bur
j pee test, 10 (13); 12-pound shot put
\ (this is not included in the Stanford
' test but the figures are interesting
for comparison), 25 feet (35 feet);
push-ups, 25 (40); and sit-ups, 50
(100).

Students who fail to take the test
at the time provided for it will be
required to pay for a test at a later
date.
The components of the physical
fitness test are strength, agility, en
durance, and co-ordination. The
strength test includes chinning,
push-ups, standing broad jump, and
sit-ups. Agility is tested by the
Burpee test. The Burpee movement
is started from the standing posi
tion. As the hands are placed in the
vicinity of the feet the legs are ex
tended backward. They are imme
diately returned to the squatting
position after which the erect po
sition is assumed again. This com
plete movement is repeated as often
as possible in a twenty-second in
terval of time.
RUN FOR ENDURANCE
Endurance is tested by the 6-sec
ond run and the 300-yard run. Co
ordination is established by the
shuttle run.
Three hundred Stanford freshmen
were tested in the fall of 1941. The
test revealed that 3'A of those tested
could not chin one time; 19' A could
not chin five times; 7% could not
push-up (parallel bars) one time;
49'/ could not push-up five times;
12 f A could not vault an obstacle
waist high; and 25''k could not swim
50 yards.
STANDARDS LISTED
Dr. A. A. Esslinger, Director of
Physical Education, has suggested
; the following standards for some of
the events in the test. The figures
in parentheses are standard for the
| superior "fit" man such as com
! mandos or paratroopers, while the
other figures are standard for the
I average "fit" man.
Chinning, 10 (16); broad jump, 7
! feet 6 inches (8 feet 6 inches); Bur
j pee test, 10 (13); 12-pound shot put
\ (this is not included in the Stanford
' test but the figures are interesting
for comparison), 25 feet (35 feet);
push-ups, 25 (40); and sit-ups, 50
(100).
Stanford men will aid the war ef
fort by being physically fit!
By action of the Academic Council
last June new regulations were
passed to insure this. All under
graduate men except those seniors in
their last quarter of residence, men
with serious physical defects, and
students over 25 years old will be
required to register for physical
education each quarter.
All men, excluding the exceptions,
must take and pass at least one
course in each of the five areas into
which the sports have been divided.
TEAM SPORTS
Team sports make up the first area
and include such sports as football,
basketball, baseball, and rugby. In
dividual sports comprise the second
area, track and field, tennis, golf,
skiing, handball, and other similar
sports being included in it.
Aquatic sports make up the third
area. Combative sports such as box
ing, wrestling, and fencing are in
cluded in the fourth area. The last
area is gymnastics, utilizing tum
bling and apparatus work.
