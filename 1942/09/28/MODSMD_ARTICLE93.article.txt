# Shaughnessy's Magic T Sparks Tail-end Terps
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Clark Daniel Shaughncssy, the Cinderella man with the "T" formation,
is back at the University of Maryland spinning his magic, and already
Eastern sports "experts" are predicting that he will lift the lowly Terra
pins into football prominence.
The "rags to riches" story of how Shaughncssy transformed Stanford's

team of winless wonders into un
defeated Rose Bowl champions is
still a legend in sports circles.
But Cinderella stories don't hap
pen every day, and the Eastern ex
perts can't expect. Shaughncssy to
transform one of the poorest football
squads in the country into a cham
pion overnight.
NEVER STRONG
For Maryland has never had a
strong team. For years the Terps
have occupied "breather" spots on
the schedules of teams like Duke,
Pennsylvania, and Syracuse. This
year the Terps have a nine-game
schedule, with Florida, Duke, and
Virginia among the stronger foes.
With luck the "T" formation Terps
should win five or six games—and
this would be a miraculous improve
ment over their performance in pre
vious years.
FIFTY-FOUR REPORT
Fifty-four gridders were on hand
for Shaughnessy's first practice ses
sion, among them fourteen letter
men. From these lettermen, Shaugh
ncssy has built his first team.
The Terrapins will have a rugged,
heavy line, with a light, fast back
field—the components of a good "T"
formation team. Bob James and Jack
Gilmore will hold down the ends;
Jack Dittmar and Reggie Vincent,
the tackles; and Eddie Choranes and
Luther Conrad, the guards. The only
non - letterman, 202 - pound Paul
Flick, will be at center.
MONT QUARTERBACK
The Terps' backfield will have Tom
Mont at quarterback, Elmer Rigby
and Jack Mier at the halves, and
Jack Wright at full.
Assisting Shaughnessy with the
backs is Jack Manders, former Chi
cago Bears veteran, Manders knows
the "T" formation thoroughly and is
helping the backs perfect the intri
cate timing required of the "T."
Al Heagy and Al Woods, hold
over Maryland coaches, are working
with the line and ends.
CONDITIONING PROGRAM
Besides being varsity football
coach, Shaughnessy has another job
at Maryland—a more important job.
He's athletic director, and he has in
stituted a strenuous physical con
ditioning program to fit Maryland
men for the armed services.
Almost 500 students are playing
football, mostly on an intramural
basis, this fall because Shaughnessy
thinks the grid sport is one of the
finest conditioners for fighting men.
Shaughnessy, like most college
athletic directors, has recognized
that physically fit fighting men are
of more value to the country than
a few football victories.
So perhaps the "experts" will for
give Mr. Shaughnessy if he fails to
come up with another Rose Bowl
winner this year.

Al Heagy and Al Woods, hold
over Maryland coaches, are working
with the line and ends.
CONDITIONING PROGRAM
Besides being varsity football
coach, Shaughnessy has another job
at Maryland—a more important job.
He's athletic director, and he has in
stituted a strenuous physical con
ditioning program to fit Maryland
men for the armed services.
Almost 500 students are playing
football, mostly on an intramural
basis, this fall because Shaughnessy
thinks the grid sport is one of the
finest conditioners for fighting men.
Shaughnessy, like most college
athletic directors, has recognized
that physically fit fighting men are
of more value to the country than
a few football victories.
So perhaps the "experts" will for
give Mr. Shaughnessy if he fails to
come up with another Rose Bowl
winner this year.
Clark Daniel Shaughncssy, the Cinderella man with the "T" formation,
is back at the University of Maryland spinning his magic, and already
Eastern sports "experts" are predicting that he will lift the lowly Terra
pins into football prominence.
The "rags to riches" story of how Shaughncssy transformed Stanford's

team of winless wonders into un
defeated Rose Bowl champions is
still a legend in sports circles.
But Cinderella stories don't hap
pen every day, and the Eastern ex
perts can't expect. Shaughncssy to
transform one of the poorest football
squads in the country into a cham
pion overnight.
NEVER STRONG
For Maryland has never had a
strong team. For years the Terps
have occupied "breather" spots on
the schedules of teams like Duke,
Pennsylvania, and Syracuse. This
year the Terps have a nine-game
schedule, with Florida, Duke, and
Virginia among the stronger foes.
With luck the "T" formation Terps
should win five or six games—and
this would be a miraculous improve
ment over their performance in pre
vious years.
FIFTY-FOUR REPORT
Fifty-four gridders were on hand
for Shaughnessy's first practice ses
sion, among them fourteen letter
men. From these lettermen, Shaugh
ncssy has built his first team.
The Terrapins will have a rugged,
heavy line, with a light, fast back
field—the components of a good "T"
formation team. Bob James and Jack
Gilmore will hold down the ends;
Jack Dittmar and Reggie Vincent,
the tackles; and Eddie Choranes and
Luther Conrad, the guards. The only
non - letterman, 202 - pound Paul
Flick, will be at center.
MONT QUARTERBACK
The Terps' backfield will have Tom
Mont at quarterback, Elmer Rigby
and Jack Mier at the halves, and
Jack Wright at full.
Assisting Shaughnessy with the
backs is Jack Manders, former Chi
cago Bears veteran, Manders knows
the "T" formation thoroughly and is
helping the backs perfect the intri
cate timing required of the "T."
