WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE, PULLMAN, Sept. 20 (Special to
The Daily).—With 37 men reporting for the twice-daily workouts, Coach
Orin E. "Babe" Hollingbcry's Washington State Cougars arc expected to
continue last season's torrid pace which led them to four surprise wins and
the name of "the hottest team on the coast" at the end of the 1941 season.

Only two points after
separated Washington State from
their second-place standings to the
conference crown.
This season 18 lettermen are back,
including eight backs and ten line
men, in addition to two experienced
men, one junior college transfer, and
16 sophomores.
Big Nick Susoeff, Washington
State's candidate for All-American
honors, is back again at his left end
job. Susoeff was one of the leading
pass catchers on the coast, and al
ready this year he has made several
spectacular catches in the practice
sessions. Susoeff was all-coast last
year, and is not only a pass receiver
but a power on defense as well as
on the offense.
STOVES OUT?
Bob Kennedy, fullback, and Jay
Stoves, left half, are two certain
starters in the Cougar backfield.
Kennedy is Hollingbery's find at
fullback last season after all the eli
gible Cougar fullbacks had cither
been declared ineligible or were in
jured. Kennedy finished the season
by making several spectacular runs
against the University of Idaho and
Texas A. and M. Jay Stoves will
take over Billy Sewell's place in the
Cougar backfield. Stoves is a triple-
Ihrcat artist who can kick, run and
pass with the same ability. The eli
gibility of both Stoves and Kennedy
is questionable, since both played
A.A.U. basketball against P.C.C.
conference rules. Their case is pend
ing now.
Frank Akins, two-year letterman
who is back after a year's lay-off,
and Earl Brenneis, letterman, will
be back at the right half job. Akins
may be shifted to the number 1 left
! half position, as he can pass and kick
I in addition to running with the ball.
BAKER AT QUARTER
Fred Bnker, who was Fred Small
| before he had to get his name
changed back to the original to get
his birth certificate authorized, is
i the leading candidate at quarter
back. Tom Branigan, two-year vet
eran who played guard, was shifted
to quarterback during spring prac
tice and has been there since. Jim
Boyle, letterman, is also another
j leading candidate for quarterback.
Other backs who are back are
Frank Londos, letterman fullback
who saw plenty of action last sea
son; Gene Evans, quarterback with
a year's experience; Jim Thompson,
sophomore triple-threat man; and
Bepton Bangs and Dick Cozens,
| sophomores, and Max Barr, junior,
are all trying out for right half.
In addition to Nick SusoefT, cer
tain starter at left end, the other
left end candidates are Tag Chris
tenscn, Floyd Knell and Ralph
Thomson, all sophomores. Max
Dodge, letterman, and "Jelly" Hjal
mer Anderson, sophomore, are the
leading candidates at right end with
sophomore Wallace Kramer also try
ing out for the position.
George Dyson and Jim Wright,
Hollingbery's two big 215-pound let -
termen, are certain starters at the
tackle spots. Dyson and Wright
both saw plenty of action last sea
son, and both boys will be used for
place kicking and kicking otT. Bill
Gustafson, letterman, and Les Metz
ger, sophomore, will be Wright's un
derstudies at right tackle with Rufus
Bold man and Bob Hix, sophomores,
backing Dyson at the left tackle slot.
Bill Ward, who was on last year's
sophomore all-American team, will
be back again at his regular left
-uard job. Ward is a letterman of
last season who made the first team
his first year on the varsity. He
has already been mentioned as an
all-American candidate this seacon.
Tom Parry and John Godfrey, soph
omores, arc also trying out for left
guard.
Rod Giske and Gene Argcr, letter
men, arc Washington State's leading
men for the right guard job. Both
men saw action in nearly all of the
Cougar games last year, and they
both love to play "rough and tough."
Harry Planck and Keith Manning,
sophomores, are also trying out for
the right guard post.
The center post on the Cougar
team is well taken care of lhi.s year
with Bill Remington, regular from
last season, back. Remington is the
big blond who so capably took care
of the large hole left in the Cougar
line after graduation a year ago.
Buster Hollingbery, letterman and
son of Coach Babe Hollingbery, will
be the Cougars' second choice for
the pivot spot, with Vern Oliver,
sophomore, also trying out for the
job.
The Cougar team is well balanced
from end to end, but the guards,
tackles, and ends still need develop
ing. If all the Washington State
candidates remain eligible, Holling
bery should have a strong team.

WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE, PULLMAN, Sept. 20 (Special to
The Daily).—With 37 men reporting for the twice-daily workouts, Coach
Orin E. "Babe" Hollingbcry's Washington State Cougars arc expected to
continue last season's torrid pace which led them to four surprise wins and
the name of "the hottest team on the coast" at the end of the 1941 season.

Only two points after
separated Washington State from
their second-place standings to the
conference crown.
This season 18 lettermen are back,
including eight backs and ten line
men, in addition to two experienced
men, one junior college transfer, and
16 sophomores.
Big Nick Susoeff, Washington
State's candidate for All-American
honors, is back again at his left end
job. Susoeff was one of the leading
pass catchers on the coast, and al
ready this year he has made several
spectacular catches in the practice
sessions. Susoeff was all-coast last
year, and is not only a pass receiver
but a power on defense as well as
on the offense.
STOVES OUT?
Bob Kennedy, fullback, and Jay
Stoves, left half, are two certain
starters in the Cougar backfield.
Kennedy is Hollingbery's find at
fullback last season after all the eli
gible Cougar fullbacks had cither
been declared ineligible or were in
jured. Kennedy finished the season
by making several spectacular runs
against the University of Idaho and
Texas A. and M. Jay Stoves will
take over Billy Sewell's place in the
Cougar backfield. Stoves is a triple-
Ihrcat artist who can kick, run and
pass with the same ability. The eli
gibility of both Stoves and Kennedy
is questionable, since both played
A.A.U. basketball against P.C.C.
conference rules. Their case is pend
ing now.
Frank Akins, two-year letterman
who is back after a year's lay-off,
and Earl Brenneis, letterman, will
be back at the right half job. Akins
may be shifted to the number 1 left
! half position, as he can pass and kick
I in addition to running with the ball.
BAKER AT QUARTER
Fred Bnker, who was Fred Small
| before he had to get his name
changed back to the original to get
his birth certificate authorized, is
i the leading candidate at quarter
back. Tom Branigan, two-year vet
eran who played guard, was shifted
to quarterback during spring prac
tice and has been there since. Jim
Boyle, letterman, is also another
j leading candidate for quarterback.
Other backs who are back are
Frank Londos, letterman fullback
who saw plenty of action last sea
son; Gene Evans, quarterback with
a year's experience; Jim Thompson,
sophomore triple-threat man; and
Bepton Bangs and Dick Cozens,
| sophomores, and Max Barr, junior,
are all trying out for right half.
In addition to Nick SusoefT, cer
tain starter at left end, the other
left end candidates are Tag Chris
tenscn, Floyd Knell and Ralph
Thomson, all sophomores. Max
Dodge, letterman, and "Jelly" Hjal
mer Anderson, sophomore, are the
leading candidates at right end with
sophomore Wallace Kramer also try
ing out for the position.
George Dyson and Jim Wright,
Hollingbery's two big 215-pound let -
termen, are certain starters at the
tackle spots. Dyson and Wright
both saw plenty of action last sea
son, and both boys will be used for
place kicking and kicking otT. Bill
Gustafson, letterman, and Les Metz
ger, sophomore, will be Wright's un
derstudies at right tackle with Rufus
Bold man and Bob Hix, sophomores,
backing Dyson at the left tackle slot.
Bill Ward, who was on last year's
sophomore all-American team, will
be back again at his regular left
-uard job. Ward is a letterman of
last season who made the first team
his first year on the varsity. He
has already been mentioned as an
all-American candidate this seacon.
Tom Parry and John Godfrey, soph
omores, arc also trying out for left
guard.
Rod Giske and Gene Argcr, letter
men, arc Washington State's leading
men for the right guard job. Both
men saw action in nearly all of the
Cougar games last year, and they
both love to play "rough and tough."
Harry Planck and Keith Manning,
sophomores, are also trying out for
the right guard post.
The center post on the Cougar
team is well taken care of lhi.s year
with Bill Remington, regular from
last season, back. Remington is the
big blond who so capably took care
of the large hole left in the Cougar
line after graduation a year ago.
Buster Hollingbery, letterman and
son of Coach Babe Hollingbery, will
be the Cougars' second choice for
the pivot spot, with Vern Oliver,
sophomore, also trying out for the
job.
The Cougar team is well balanced
from end to end, but the guards,
tackles, and ends still need develop
ing. If all the Washington State
candidates remain eligible, Holling
bery should have a strong team.

The Daily).—With 37 men reporting for the twice-daily workouts, Coach
Orin E. "Babe" Hollingbcry's Washington State Cougars arc expected to
continue last season's torrid pace which led them to four surprise wins and
the name of "the hottest team on the coast" at the end of the 1941 season.

Only two points after
separated Washington State from
their second-place standings to the
conference crown.
This season 18 lettermen are back,
including eight backs and ten line
men, in addition to two experienced
men, one junior college transfer, and
16 sophomores.
Big Nick Susoeff, Washington
State's candidate for All-American
honors, is back again at his left end
job. Susoeff was one of the leading
pass catchers on the coast, and al
ready this year he has made several
spectacular catches in the practice
sessions. Susoeff was all-coast last
year, and is not only a pass receiver
but a power on defense as well as
on the offense.
STOVES OUT?
Bob Kennedy, fullback, and Jay
Stoves, left half, are two certain
starters in the Cougar backfield.
Kennedy is Hollingbery's find at
fullback last season after all the eli
gible Cougar fullbacks had cither
been declared ineligible or were in
jured. Kennedy finished the season
by making several spectacular runs
against the University of Idaho and
Texas A. and M. Jay Stoves will
take over Billy Sewell's place in the
Cougar backfield. Stoves is a triple-
Ihrcat artist who can kick, run and
pass with the same ability. The eli
gibility of both Stoves and Kennedy
is questionable, since both played
A.A.U. basketball against P.C.C.
conference rules. Their case is pend
ing now.
Frank Akins, two-year letterman
who is back after a year's lay-off,
and Earl Brenneis, letterman, will
be back at the right half job. Akins
may be shifted to the number 1 left
! half position, as he can pass and kick
I in addition to running with the ball.
BAKER AT QUARTER
Fred Bnker, who was Fred Small
| before he had to get his name
changed back to the original to get
his birth certificate authorized, is
i the leading candidate at quarter
back. Tom Branigan, two-year vet
eran who played guard, was shifted
to quarterback during spring prac
tice and has been there since. Jim
Boyle, letterman, is also another
j leading candidate for quarterback.
Other backs who are back are
Frank Londos, letterman fullback
who saw plenty of action last sea
son; Gene Evans, quarterback with
a year's experience; Jim Thompson,
sophomore triple-threat man; and
Bepton Bangs and Dick Cozens,
| sophomores, and Max Barr, junior,
are all trying out for right half.
In addition to Nick SusoefT, cer
tain starter at left end, the other
left end candidates are Tag Chris
tenscn, Floyd Knell and Ralph
Thomson, all sophomores. Max
Dodge, letterman, and "Jelly" Hjal
mer Anderson, sophomore, are the
leading candidates at right end with
sophomore Wallace Kramer also try
ing out for the position.
George Dyson and Jim Wright,
Hollingbery's two big 215-pound let -
termen, are certain starters at the
tackle spots. Dyson and Wright
both saw plenty of action last sea
son, and both boys will be used for
place kicking and kicking otT. Bill
Gustafson, letterman, and Les Metz
ger, sophomore, will be Wright's un
derstudies at right tackle with Rufus
Bold man and Bob Hix, sophomores,
backing Dyson at the left tackle slot.
Bill Ward, who was on last year's
sophomore all-American team, will
be back again at his regular left
-uard job. Ward is a letterman of
last season who made the first team
his first year on the varsity. He
has already been mentioned as an
all-American candidate this seacon.
Tom Parry and John Godfrey, soph
omores, arc also trying out for left
guard.
Rod Giske and Gene Argcr, letter
men, arc Washington State's leading
men for the right guard job. Both
men saw action in nearly all of the
Cougar games last year, and they
both love to play "rough and tough."
Harry Planck and Keith Manning,
sophomores, are also trying out for
the right guard post.
The center post on the Cougar
team is well taken care of lhi.s year
with Bill Remington, regular from
last season, back. Remington is the
big blond who so capably took care
of the large hole left in the Cougar
line after graduation a year ago.
Buster Hollingbery, letterman and
son of Coach Babe Hollingbery, will
be the Cougars' second choice for
the pivot spot, with Vern Oliver,
sophomore, also trying out for the
job.
The Cougar team is well balanced
from end to end, but the guards,
tackles, and ends still need develop
ing. If all the Washington State
candidates remain eligible, Holling
bery should have a strong team.
