WASHINGTON STATE COLLEGE, PULLMAN, Sept. 20 (Special to
The Daily).—With 37 men reporting for the twice-daily workouts, Coach
Orin E. "Babe" Hollingbcry's Washington State Cougars arc expected to
continue last season's torrid pace which led them to four surprise wins and
the name of "the hottest team on the coast" at the end of the 1941 season.

Only two points after
separated Washington State from
their second-place standings to the
conference crown.
This season 18 lettermen are back,
including eight backs and ten line
men, in addition to two experienced
men, one junior college transfer, and
16 sophomores.
Big Nick Susoeff, Washington
State's candidate for All-American
honors, is back again at his left end
job. Susoeff was one of the leading
pass catchers on the coast, and al
ready this year he has made several
spectacular catches in the practice
sessions. Susoeff was all-coast last
year, and is not only a pass receiver
but a power on defense as well as
on the offense.
STOVES OUT?
Bob Kennedy, fullback, and Jay
Stoves, left half, are two certain
starters in the Cougar backfield.
Kennedy is Hollingbery's find at
fullback last season after all the eli
gible Cougar fullbacks had cither
been declared ineligible or were in
jured. Kennedy finished the season
by making several spectacular runs
against the University of Idaho and
Texas A. and M. Jay Stoves will
take over Billy Sewell's place in the
Cougar backfield. Stoves is a triple-
Ihrcat artist who can kick, run and
pass with the same ability. The eli
gibility of both Stoves and Kennedy
is questionable, since both played
A.A.U. basketball against P.C.C.
conference rules. Their case is pend
ing now.
Frank Akins, two-year letterman
who is back after a year's lay-off,
and Earl Brenneis, letterman, will
be back at the right half job. Akins
may be shifted to the number 1 left
! half position, as he can pass and kick
I in addition to running with the ball.
BAKER AT QUARTER
Fred Bnker, who was Fred Small
| before he had to get his name
changed back to the original to get
his birth certificate authorized, is
i the leading candidate at quarter
back. Tom Branigan, two-year vet
eran who played guard, was shifted
to quarterback during spring prac
tice and has been there since. Jim
Boyle, letterman, is also another
j leading candidate for quarterback.
Other backs who are back are
Frank Londos, letterman fullback
who saw plenty of action last sea
son; Gene Evans, quarterback with
a year's experience; Jim Thompson,
sophomore triple-threat man; and
Bepton Bangs and Dick Cozens,
| sophomores, and Max Barr, junior,
