FRESHMEN ARE
NEWMEN
Upperclassmen know from experience that it's easy to
save three-fourths of the cost of their books by buying
them downtown on Emerson Street at College Book
Shop, and then selling them back to College Book Shop
when they've finished with them. (A four dollar book
can be bought for three and sold back at two.)
But Freshmen are busy people. They may not know an
old farmer to tell them, before they've spent all thai
money on new texts, that College Book Shop is just
around the corner from Montgomery Wards.
