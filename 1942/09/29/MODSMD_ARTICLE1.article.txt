# Cellar to Close Sundays Due to Labor Shortage, Says Board of Governors
## Union, Encina Dining Malls to Close Saturdays, Open Sundays; Students Asked to Cooperate in Rush Hours 
### DICK KEUSINK 
The Union Board of Governors at their first regular meeting of the
school year announced last Thursday that the Cellar would be closed on
Sundays due to an acute shortage of help in the dining unit. Miss Chris
tine flicker. Director of the Union Dining II«lJs, said that it was not the
lack of student help that would close the Cellar on Sundays but it was

just impossible to hnd sufficient help
to run the Cellar in off hours when
students could not help.
"There are a number of jobs which
students cannot take or find time
to work at," said Miss Ricker. "We
appreciate the help of the students,
but the Cellar is faced with the same
problems that other eating units
have, lack of full-time help."
The main dining room will con
tinue to operate on Sunday, but will
be closed on Saturdays as it has been
in the past. The Union Cellar will
continue to close at 8 o'clock for the
next week at least. However, it is
hoped to have the cigar counter
unit open even if the Cellar counter
cannot open.
SATURDAY MEALS
The Board, composed of Frank F.
Walker, financial vice-president of
the University; William B. Owens,
chairman of the Board; Ed Stamm,
president of the student body; Bill
Moran, student manager, and Wil
liam Paul, regularly elected member
of the board, also decided to close
the Encina Hall dining room on Sat
urdays instead of Sundays.
"The Encina dining room has also
been closed on Sundays in the past,"
commented Miss Ricker, "but the
board decided that Saturday would
be a better day to close since stu
dents generally miss meals on Sat
urday during the football season
anyway."
The Encina Cellar Store will con
tinue to operate on a seven-day ba
sis as it has in the past. The store
will be open from 7 in the morning
until 11 at night.
RESTAURANT PROBLEMS
Miss Ricker, who is an ex-officio
member of the board, remarked
that all restaurants and eating places
are also faced with an acute shortage
of labor due to people going into
war industries. "We would appre
ciate it if students would do their
own bussing during the morning
rush hours. Students are eating their
food from paper plates as we do not
have enough help to serve and wash
dishes," she stated.
The Union hopes that students
will co-operate in the hope that the
dining halls can get back on regular
schedule as soon as the labor situa
tion can be regulated.

Miss Ricker, who is an ex-officio
member of the board, remarked
that all restaurants and eating places
are also faced with an acute shortage
of labor due to people going into
war industries. "We would appre
ciate it if students would do their
own bussing during the morning
rush hours. Students are eating their
food from paper plates as we do not
have enough help to serve and wash
dishes," she stated.
The Union hopes that students
will co-operate in the hope that the
dining halls can get back on regular
schedule as soon as the labor situa
tion can be regulated.
The Union Board of Governors at their first regular meeting of the
school year announced last Thursday that the Cellar would be closed on
Sundays due to an acute shortage of help in the dining unit. Miss Chris
tine flicker. Director of the Union Dining II«lJs, said that it was not the
lack of student help that would close the Cellar on Sundays but it was

just impossible to hnd sufficient help
to run the Cellar in off hours when
students could not help.
"There are a number of jobs which
students cannot take or find time
to work at," said Miss Ricker. "We
appreciate the help of the students,
but the Cellar is faced with the same
problems that other eating units
have, lack of full-time help."
The main dining room will con
tinue to operate on Sunday, but will
be closed on Saturdays as it has been
in the past. The Union Cellar will
continue to close at 8 o'clock for the
next week at least. However, it is
hoped to have the cigar counter
unit open even if the Cellar counter
cannot open.
SATURDAY MEALS
The Board, composed of Frank F.
Walker, financial vice-president of
the University; William B. Owens,
chairman of the Board; Ed Stamm,
president of the student body; Bill
Moran, student manager, and Wil
liam Paul, regularly elected member
of the board, also decided to close
the Encina Hall dining room on Sat
urdays instead of Sundays.
"The Encina dining room has also
been closed on Sundays in the past,"
commented Miss Ricker, "but the
board decided that Saturday would
be a better day to close since stu
dents generally miss meals on Sat
urday during the football season
anyway."
The Encina Cellar Store will con
tinue to operate on a seven-day ba
sis as it has in the past. The store
will be open from 7 in the morning
until 11 at night.
