# 'Dimes' Drive Begins Monday
## 
### 
"Dimes" cans will be passed next
Monday, marking the beginning of
the Dimes For Diplomas third quar
ter. During the dinner hour, all of
the campus eating groups, including
the Row, will be visited by campaign
representatives who will solicit dimes
for the scholarship fund.
Dimes campaign was conceived last
spring when it became evident that
many men students, within a quarter
of graduation, would be drafted and
would be financially unable to con
tinue school after the Victory. It is
the Dimes for Diplomas' purpose to
raise a fund large enough to pay a
quarter's tuition for 50 of these stu
dents.
Five thousand dollars is required
for this undertaking. To date $841.85
has been collected, $503.66 donated
by summer quarter students.
Jim Mcßrier, Rally Com chairman,
asks that the student body get the
"Dimes habit" and looks for a $100
contribution Monday.
The campaign staff is being or
ganized this week, and students in
terested in working with the Rally
Com on the Dimes drive are referred
to Mcßrier, Fiji house.
