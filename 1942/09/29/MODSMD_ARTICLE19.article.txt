# Dr. Wilbur Tells Need For 18 Unit Programs
## 
### 
"All students now registering in
the University should have in mind
the part they will play in the war.
All work must be speeded up. When
ever feasible 18 hours of work should
be taken, since that permits gradu
ation in ten quarters," declared
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur in a
recent letter to all University de
partment heads.
Following Dr. Wilbur's lead and
accompanying his effort, the Stu
dent War Board is asking every stu
dent carefully to consider his pro
gram of courses this fall, before reg
istering.
"Students should keep in mind
that they are in school on borrowed
time and they must do not only bet
ter work than ever before, but more
work than ever before," stated a Stu
dent War Board member.
"The average course in the past
has been 15 units," he continued.
"In times like these 17 or 18 units is
not unreasonable or impossible for
most people. Each student must
study his own situation and his own
capabilities and then make sure that
he is doing his utmost."
