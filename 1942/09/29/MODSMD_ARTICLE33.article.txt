# Daily Abandons Door Delivery
## 
### 
War has compelled The Daily to
abandon its usual door-to-door de
livery. Beginning today, stacks of
Dailies will be left at strategic spots
on the campus in an effort to con
serve tires and gas, announced
George TÂ°lman, business manager.
Professors living on campus ex
tremities, and off-campus students
will be able to get Dailies at home
only through mail subscriptions,
which will get them the paper a
day late.
Faced with delivering several
thousand newspapers in only one car,
Tolman conceived the new plan
which was okayed by Bill Moran,
student manager, and A1 Masters,
graduate manager. This plan is sub
ject to change after a trial period.
Hereafter, all stacks of Dailies will
be left in boxes at the four corners
of the Quad, the tfnion, Libe, Chem
istry Building, Anatomy Building,
Post Office, Education Building, and
the B.A.C.
