# Woman's Editor Spends July With ISS Mulling War, Peace
## 
### AMIE REICHERT 
The newspapers called us "Elea- i
nor's kids," and Westbrook Pegler I
called us "Young Communists," but
we weren't either one. We were 27
college students in a big house on an
island off the northernmost tip of
Maine and we were studying "A
Democratic Strategy for War and
Peace."
The students came from all parts '
of the United States, and one from
South America. There were two
negro students and one Chinese stu
dent, students of all faiths and vary
ing backgrounds. What we had in
common was that we were all young
Americans in the middle of national
and international chaos, trying to
see a little more clearly the shape
of things as they are, trying to plan
intelligently for the shape of things
to come.
This school was called the Summer
Student Leadership Institute, and it
was run by the International Student
Service. Mrs. Roosevelt is a member
of the executive board of ISS, and
it was at the President's summer
home on the island of Campobello
that the institute was held.
TWO SECTIONS
The course of study was divided
into two sections which were sepa
rate yet interrelated. The morning
sessions were given over to the gen
eral study of the national and in
ternational situation, its political,
economic, sociological, and ideologi
cal aspects. The various plans for
peace and future international co
operation were studied and dis
cussed.
The afternoon sessions, which
made up the second section, were
student discussion and reports on the
problems and possibilities for youth
responsibility and action through all
of this. These were strictly student
meetings, whereas the morning ses
sions were lecture meetings.
Among the lecturers at Campobello
this year were author Louis Adamic,
Chinese Ambassador Hu Shih, sci
entist Harlow Shapley, economist Eli
Ginzberg, Professor Jaques Barzun
of Columbia, and Hans Simon of the
New School of Social Research.
MaoIVER DIRECTOR
Director of the institute was Dr.
Robert M. Maclver of Columbia.
In the evenings we had various
lectures ranging from the one on
modern music by composer Douglas
Moore, to the one on the labor move
ment by Jimmy Wechsler, labor ed
itor of PM.
Mrs. Roosevelt visited at Campo
bello for several days, long enough
to make 27 new enemies for West
brook Pegler. We went with her to
inspect the Quoddy project in East
port, Maine, which has been con
verted into a government-subsidized
training school for defense workers.
Here each month some 800 boys
come to start their training period.
They come from the New York and
New England areas and they are
what is called "the underprivileged."
They come to learn to be welders,
airplane mechanics, carpenters — to

do a hundred vital jobs.
They live in Quoddy Village, a
close-knit community of boys from
the ages of about 16 to 25, and ihey I
run their own government, efficiently
too.
The day we visited the project
they had just elected a new mayor
a negro.
We thought this was democracy |
at work. We thought this was some
thing of what we had been talking
about for five weeks on an isolated '
foggy island oft' the coast of Maine.
We saw that is wasn't all just "good j
in theory," we saw that it could be
done.
Among other things we learned a
new symbol at Cumpobello—the
double "V." It means victory over j
fascism abroad, and victory over fas
cism at home. We learned that these
are the two great battles which face I
American youth.
