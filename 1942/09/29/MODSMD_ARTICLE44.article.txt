# ASSU Managers To See Moran
## 
### 
Bill Moran, A.S.S.U. student man
ager, asked yesterday that all man
agers of student organizations come
to see him sometime this week.
"It is necessary," said Moran, "that
all individuals who handle the fi
nances of campus organizations get
the A.S.S.U. rules on money matters
straightâ€”that is, all campus organi
zations which collect money from
students come under A.S.S.U. con
trol and those funds must be de
posited through the A.S.S.U.
However, Moran emphasized that
this does not include eating clubs,
fraternities, or sororities.
Moran will be available either in
the A.S.S.U. office or the student
manager's office any afternoon this
week.
