# Vucinich Named Captain For Santa Clara Game
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity eleven had a respite from body contact work yester
day after their bruising 6-0 defeat by the Washington State Cougars last
Saturday.
Coach Marchie Schwartz scrimmaged his second and third teams, work
ing in Ray Hammett, first string quarterback, on some plays.
Center Milt Vucinich was out with a charley-horsc, and Bob Ilall,

first string end, rested because of a,
sprained ankle suffered in the Wash
ington State game. Both will be in
shape in a few days.
VUCINICH GAME CAPTAIN
Vucinich was elected game captain
for the Santa Clara game next Sat
urday.
The Washington State game
showed the Indians lack game expe
rience and must strengthen their
backfield. More than anything else,
the game showed that the Stanford
attack, was pitifully impotent. The
Indians only netted 55 yards from
scrimmage.
Part of the impotency can be at
tributed to inexperience. Both Ham
mett and Zappettini were jittery at
times and a little over-anxious to
please. With one game under their
belts they should bp. much steadier
next Saturday.
TIMING POOF
The backs showed poor timing on
many plays and both the line and
backs guilty of ragged block
ing ar i tackling. Both Zappettini
and Hammett had fair shots at Earl
Brenneis of the Cougars after he
gathered in Jay Stoves' pass on his
way to the only score of the game.
In order to strengthen the back
field, Coach Schwartz moved Ben
Morrison from left halfback to quar
terback. Morrison will work behind
Hammett and Mark Caffall, second
string quarterback.
On the bright side of the ledger
was the play of the line, particularly
the sophomore ends, Dave Brown,
Bob Hall, and Pete August. With
Hank Norberg and Rog Laverty on
deck the Indians appear to have
solved the end problem. The line
looked very solid with Ed Stamm,
Chuck Taylor, Vucinich, Loren La-

Prade, and Jim Cox turning in good
performances. Bruno Banducci, vet
eran right tackle, did not aggravate
his foot injury and will be ready to
play against Santa Clara.
FAWCETT OUTSTANDING
Buck Fawcett was easily the stand
out backfield man, and he accounted
for almost all of the Indian offense.
Fawcett carried the ball ten times
for a total gain of 52 yards. Bill
Sheller played a good defensive
game and his punting was outstand
ing. Sheller's punting average of
39.6 yards a kick relieves the In
dians of one burden Ensign Frankie
Albert left when he graduated.
One other burden Albert left which
has not been shouldered is the pass
ing. The T formation depends on a
passing threat for its effectiveness
and, so far, no back has demon
strated much passing ability.
lIOISCH BREAKS LOOSE
During yesterday's scrimmage,
diminutive Al Hoisch broke away
several times for long gains and
showed that he will be a very dan
gerous back once in the open. Dur
ing the workout the second and third
strings concentrated mainly on quick
opening plays inside the tackles.
The Indians meet the Santa Clara
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco next Saturday. The Bron
cos walloped Utah, one of the best
teams in the Rocky Mountain con
ference, 12-0 in Salt Lake City last
Saturday.

many plays and both the line and
backs guilty of ragged block
ing ar i tackling. Both Zappettini
and Hammett had fair shots at Earl
Brenneis of the Cougars after he
gathered in Jay Stoves' pass on his
way to the only score of the game.
In order to strengthen the back
field, Coach Schwartz moved Ben
Morrison from left halfback to quar
terback. Morrison will work behind
Hammett and Mark Caffall, second
string quarterback.
On the bright side of the ledger
was the play of the line, particularly
the sophomore ends, Dave Brown,
Bob Hall, and Pete August. With
Hank Norberg and Rog Laverty on
deck the Indians appear to have
solved the end problem. The line
looked very solid with Ed Stamm,
Chuck Taylor, Vucinich, Loren La-

Prade, and Jim Cox turning in good
performances. Bruno Banducci, vet
eran right tackle, did not aggravate
his foot injury and will be ready to
play against Santa Clara.
FAWCETT OUTSTANDING
Buck Fawcett was easily the stand
out backfield man, and he accounted
for almost all of the Indian offense.
Fawcett carried the ball ten times
for a total gain of 52 yards. Bill
Sheller played a good defensive
game and his punting was outstand
ing. Sheller's punting average of
39.6 yards a kick relieves the In
dians of one burden Ensign Frankie
Albert left when he graduated.
One other burden Albert left which
has not been shouldered is the pass
ing. The T formation depends on a
passing threat for its effectiveness
and, so far, no back has demon
strated much passing ability.
lIOISCH BREAKS LOOSE
During yesterday's scrimmage,
diminutive Al Hoisch broke away
several times for long gains and
showed that he will be a very dan
gerous back once in the open. Dur
ing the workout the second and third
strings concentrated mainly on quick
opening plays inside the tackles.
The Indians meet the Santa Clara
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco next Saturday. The Bron
cos walloped Utah, one of the best
teams in the Rocky Mountain con
ference, 12-0 in Salt Lake City last
Saturday.
Stanford's varsity eleven had a respite from body contact work yester
day after their bruising 6-0 defeat by the Washington State Cougars last
Saturday.
Coach Marchie Schwartz scrimmaged his second and third teams, work
ing in Ray Hammett, first string quarterback, on some plays.
Center Milt Vucinich was out with a charley-horsc, and Bob Ilall,

first string end, rested because of a,
sprained ankle suffered in the Wash
ington State game. Both will be in
shape in a few days.
VUCINICH GAME CAPTAIN
Vucinich was elected game captain
for the Santa Clara game next Sat
urday.
The Washington State game
showed the Indians lack game expe
rience and must strengthen their
backfield. More than anything else,
the game showed that the Stanford
attack, was pitifully impotent. The
Indians only netted 55 yards from
scrimmage.
Part of the impotency can be at
tributed to inexperience. Both Ham
mett and Zappettini were jittery at
times and a little over-anxious to
please. With one game under their
belts they should bp. much steadier
next Saturday.
