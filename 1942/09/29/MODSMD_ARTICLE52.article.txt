A hattle for the fullback position
is being waged between Agnew,
Steve Tish, a fast, hard-junning
back, and John Wipple. At the pres
ent time, oil his high school record,
Agnew seems to be the class.
HALFBACK BATTLE
Lloyd Merriman at left halfback
and Mark HefTelfinger at right half
are leading the candidates for the
halfback spots. Homer Hamlin is
also a solid contender for a starting
position.

In the line, leading the competition
are Bob Rohrer, left end; Bill Hach
tan, left tackle; Dick Madigan, left
guard; Dick Flatland and Sid Smith,
centers; Ed Gunderson, right guard;
Russell Tausheck, right tackle; and
Frank Wigmore and Frank Heflle
