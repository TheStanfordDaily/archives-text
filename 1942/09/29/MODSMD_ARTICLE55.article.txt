## 
### 
Clark Shauglincssy's debut as
head coach at the University of
Maryland was an overwhelming
success as his Terrapins, employ
ing the T formation, humiliated
the University of Connecticut, 34-
0, last Saturday.
Little Tommy Mont, the Tcrps'
quarterback, sparked Maryland to
four quick scores early in the first
half, after which Shaughnessy
used his reserves and coasted to
victory.
In previous years Connecticut
was rated on an even level
with Maryland.
