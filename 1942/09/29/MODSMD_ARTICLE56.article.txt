# Compulsory Physical Program To Meet Wartime Demands
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Compulsory physical education for nearly every Stanford man he
comes effective this quarter under a sweeping wartime program aimed at
providing students with the strength, agility, endurance, and coordination
which military service will demand.
"We don't want any Stanford man to have two strikes against him when

he enters the service," stated Dr.
A. A. Esslinger of the School of
Health, in announcing registration
procedure for the program yesterday.
The program has been planned
after a survey of the most recent
college physical "toughening" pro
grams, gathered by the forces of A1
Masters, graduate manager.
The only students who will be ex
cused from registering for a physical
education course at the B.A.C. build
ing today will be graduate students,
those over 25 years old, those with
a serious physical defect, or senior
students in the last quarter of resi
dence. Last-quarter seniors enrolled
in Navy V-l must comply with the
new regulations.
SPORTS DIVIDED
Otherwise many a Farm man who
thought his days in Eneina gym were
over will have live choices in sign
ing for his new training. Sports have
been divided into five areas: team
sports, individual sports, aquatic
sports, combative sports, and gym
nastics.
Students must complete one course
in each ol' these live, although the
sequence is left to the student's
choice. Students who can swim 100
yards (any combination of strokes
allowed) will be excused from the
aquatic area, but no credit will be
allowed for this division by passing
this test.
The following courses will meet
program requirements. Under team
sports football, basketball, baseball,
soccer, rugby, crew, and volleyball
are open. Crewmen will receive
athletic credit for the first time in
several years. Individual sports are
track and field, tennis, golf, bad
minton, handball, and skiing.
AQUATIC DIVISION
Swimming, diving, and water polo
are listed in the aquatic division, and
boxing, wrestling, and fencing meet
combative area requirements. Gym
nasts may take either tumbling or
apparatus work.
To meet the new demand on ath
letic facilities, every instructor on
the payroll will have classes eight
hours a day, officials stated. Because
of this, morning classes, usually
scarce on student programs, will be
instituted. They will be filled by
compulsory action if necessary. Ev
ery student with free hours in the
morning is urged to use them for
his physical education class.
I' irst step in the program will be
intensive physical fitness testing for
all registrants. The tests will be
taken during the first class period
for which the student is registered.
Tests are scheduled between 9 and
11:15 in the mornings and between
2 and 5:15 in the afternoons.
TEST PROCEDURE
Dressed in street shoes and cloth
ing, students will go through the
mill from pullups to track dashes,
and their current physical fitness will
be recorded for comparison with
achievements at the end of the train
ing period.
The School of Health considered
the figures in parenthesis to be
"standard for the average fit man
in the different tests listed below.
Strength ratings are based on pull
ups (10), pushups (25), standing
broad jump (7 ft. G in.), and situps
(50).
I hi 1 Burpee test measures agility.
I he victim starts from standing po
sition, falls forward on his hands,
kicks feet back, returns to squatting
position, and stands up straight. If
you can do this ten times in 20 sec
onds, you are average. *
ENDURANCE RATED
Endurance is measured by the six
second run (44 yards), and by the
.'SOO-yard dash (48 seconds).
The shuttle run, testing coordi
nation, is a modified hurdle race
(37 seconds).
No one who is eligible under the
general rules of the program will be
exempted from the tests except by
medical permit. Students who take
the tests later than their scheduled
time will have to pay for a second
appointment, Dr. Esslinger stated.
Transfer students will have their
former work evaluated by Dr. O. N.
Anderson, director of the School of
Health, and their programs will be
adapted according to his decision.

AL MASTERS
Compulsory physical education for nearly every Stanford man he
comes effective this quarter under a sweeping wartime program aimed at
providing students with the strength, agility, endurance, and coordination
which military service will demand.
"We don't want any Stanford man to have two strikes against him when

he enters the service," stated Dr.
A. A. Esslinger of the School of
Health, in announcing registration
procedure for the program yesterday.
The program has been planned
after a survey of the most recent
college physical "toughening" pro
grams, gathered by the forces of A1
Masters, graduate manager.
The only students who will be ex
cused from registering for a physical
education course at the B.A.C. build
ing today will be graduate students,
those over 25 years old, those with
a serious physical defect, or senior
students in the last quarter of resi
dence. Last-quarter seniors enrolled
in Navy V-l must comply with the
new regulations.
SPORTS DIVIDED
Otherwise many a Farm man who
thought his days in Eneina gym were
over will have live choices in sign
ing for his new training. Sports have
been divided into five areas: team
sports, individual sports, aquatic
sports, combative sports, and gym
nastics.
Students must complete one course
in each ol' these live, although the
sequence is left to the student's
choice. Students who can swim 100
yards (any combination of strokes
allowed) will be excused from the
aquatic area, but no credit will be
allowed for this division by passing
this test.
The following courses will meet
program requirements. Under team
sports football, basketball, baseball,
soccer, rugby, crew, and volleyball
are open. Crewmen will receive
athletic credit for the first time in
several years. Individual sports are
track and field, tennis, golf, bad
minton, handball, and skiing.
AQUATIC DIVISION
Swimming, diving, and water polo
are listed in the aquatic division, and
boxing, wrestling, and fencing meet
combative area requirements. Gym
nasts may take either tumbling or
apparatus work.
To meet the new demand on ath
letic facilities, every instructor on
the payroll will have classes eight
hours a day, officials stated. Because
of this, morning classes, usually
scarce on student programs, will be
instituted. They will be filled by
compulsory action if necessary. Ev
ery student with free hours in the
morning is urged to use them for
his physical education class.
I' irst step in the program will be
intensive physical fitness testing for
all registrants. The tests will be
taken during the first class period
for which the student is registered.
Tests are scheduled between 9 and
11:15 in the mornings and between
2 and 5:15 in the afternoons.
TEST PROCEDURE
Dressed in street shoes and cloth
ing, students will go through the
mill from pullups to track dashes,
and their current physical fitness will
be recorded for comparison with
achievements at the end of the train
ing period.

choice. Students who can swim 100
yards (any combination of strokes
allowed) will be excused from the
aquatic area, but no credit will be
allowed for this division by passing
this test.
The following courses will meet

compulsory action if necessary. Ev
ery student with free hours in the
morning is urged to use them for
his physical education class.
I' irst step in the program will be
intensive physical fitness testing for
all registrants. The tests will be

the figures in parenthesis to be
"standard for the average fit man
in the different tests listed below.
Strength ratings are based on pull
ups (10), pushups (25), standing
broad jump (7 ft. G in.), and situps
(50).
I hi 1 Burpee test measures agility.
I he victim starts from standing po
sition, falls forward on his hands,
kicks feet back, returns to squatting
position, and stands up straight. If
you can do this ten times in 20 sec
onds, you are average. *
ENDURANCE RATED

The shuttle run, testing coordi
nation, is a modified hurdle race

Anderson, director of the School of
Health, and their programs will be

Compulsory physical education for nearly every Stanford man he
comes effective this quarter under a sweeping wartime program aimed at
providing students with the strength, agility, endurance, and coordination
which military service will demand.
"We don't want any Stanford man to have two strikes against him when

he enters the service," stated Dr.
A. A. Esslinger of the School of
Health, in announcing registration
procedure for the program yesterday.
The program has been planned
after a survey of the most recent
college physical "toughening" pro

The only students who will be ex
cused from registering for a physical
education course at the B.A.C. build
ing today will be graduate students,
those over 25 years old, those with
a serious physical defect, or senior
students in the last quarter of resi
