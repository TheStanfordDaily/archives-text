# Back to Fundamentals, Says the 'Stubber'
## 
### 
"Fundamentals."
That was the big word at Berkeley
yesterday as the "Stubber"—"Stub"
Allison to those who are not so in
timate with him—sent his slightly
tarnished Golden Bears back to work
for Cal's game this Saturday with
Oregon State at Corvallis. Every
time the "Stubber" loses a game or
conies close to losing a game he goes
back to fundamentals. Ol' Sarge Al
lison came close to dropping his
opener to St. Mary's last Saturday,
just eking out a 6-0 win, and yester
day it was rumored that he had
said to himself, "I've been teaching
the boys too much fancy stuff, too
much single wing and short punt.
The boys threw the ball around too
much last Saturday, and they passed
three or four times."
So it's "back to fundamentals" for
Cal.
