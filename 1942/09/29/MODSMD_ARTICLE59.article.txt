# Brook Gridders Take Early Lead
## 
### 
As is Brooklyn's custom for the
past year to jump into an early lead
in league standings, the Brooklyn
Dodgers of the Eastern Division of
the National Football League went
into the league lead, being tied with
the New York Giants. In the West
ern Division, the two Chicago teams,
the Bears and the Cardinals, are tied
for the lead.
Tlii' fourth place Philadelphia Ea
gles of the Eastern Division have
scored the most points in their group,
52. However, their opponents found
them easy to score upon, having
rolled over them for 72 points.
In the Western Division, the Bears
have the scoring lead, all of which
were tallied in their only league
game; they took the Green Buy
Packers into camp, 44-28. While the
Cardinals have made but 20 points,
they are the only professional team
that has not yet been scored upon.
The Detroit Lions, losers in two
starts, have yet to make a point.
