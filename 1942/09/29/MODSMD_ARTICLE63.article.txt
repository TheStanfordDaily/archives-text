# Farm Soccer Squad To Play Opener Oct. 10
## 
### 
Stanford's Cardinal soccer squad
is set to begin practice for its tough
ten-game schedule this Thursday
afternoon. Willi the first intercol
legiate game scheduled for October
10, Coach Maloney will have to put
his squad through a rugged and in
tensified conditioning program in the
short time that he has.
All soccer men are asked to re
port for their physical examination
Thursday afternoon at 2. After the
brief check-up, equipment will be
issued at the gym store.
WAR HITS EQUIPMENT
Due to the war emergency, it is
exceedingly difficult to get soccer
equipment, since most of the kickers'
togs must be imported from Eng
land or South America.
For this reason Coach Maloney
has been forced to limit the var
sity squad to 35 and the freshman
team to 25 members.
Upperclassmen who are inexpe
rienced in soccer are not urged to
come out this quarter as the fall is
the intercollegiate season.
INSTRUCTION IN SPRING
During the regular season there is
little time for instruction to new
men. However, soccer is also given
iti the spring and summer, and Coach
Maloney adds that "during these
non-competitive quarters, I espe
cially use the time for training in
experienced players."
All soccer men will report tomor
row at 4:20 for the first roll call and
will be given the newly inaugurated
physical fitness test.
