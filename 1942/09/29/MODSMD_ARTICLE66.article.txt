# Stanford Film Stars Albert

If it doesn't do anything else, the
"Spirit of Stanford" is going to get
the University of California awfully,
awfully mad. That makes it a suc
cess.
To pass lightly over the story (Co
lumbia did, why shouldn't we?)," it's
a movie writer's idea of Frankie Al
bert's four years at Stanford. Cocky
because of his football fame, Frankie,
the "Glendale Flash," arrives at
Stanford, leads the frosh team to its
first undefeated, untied season, rises
to immortality with the Rose Bowl
squad of '40, gets cocky all over
again, wises up just before the 1941
Big Game, ends up mopping floors
and telling the story of his college
days to two dopes from Modesto
High.
WE WIN CAL GAME
It's that '41 Big Game that's going
to result in the destruction of every
theater in Berkeley that shows this
little beauty. Everybody knows that
the Indians dropped that one, IG-0.
Everybody except Columbia Pic
tures. But a quick twist of the sce
narist's pencil, a few interjected
shots of the W.S.C. game, and up
comes Stanford with a 14-7 win.
Well, we always did claim that we
could win that one if it was played
over.
This show is tops for laughs. You'll
laugh everywhere you shouldn't.
Have a laugh on the Dekes when
Albert turns up as a good old Beta
Sigma Psi. Have a laugh on the
Roble hashers when you discover
they can sing pretty and have
spawned a quartet known as the
Four Vagabonds. In fact, laugh just
anywhere and you'll be on the beam.
PLENTY OF LAUGHS
The picture does have its good
points. Frankie, amazingly enough,
turns in a swell job. We were afraid
he might be another Luisetti but his
acting is O.K. Columbia deserves
some credit for calling the Quad the
Quad, and a quarter a quarter in
stead of a term or semester. You'll
also enjoy the shots of the Stanford-
Nebraska Rose Bowl game. The
writers left that alone and it is as
thrilling as anything else in the pic
ture. Ernie Nevers is on hand to play
Ernie Nevers.
Go see the "Spirit of Stanford,"
have a laugh, look at the publicity
for the Farm, and as you leave the
theater breathe a prayer of thanks
that we were never cursed with the
Four Vagabonds.
