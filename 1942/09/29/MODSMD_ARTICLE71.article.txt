# Supposedly Potent Squads Suffer in Grid Starts
## 
### 
Supposed favorites in the Pacific
Coast Conference grid race turned
out performances varying from bad
to middle class Saturday with many
of the games providing no solid in
dications of who might be where
when this first year of wartime foot
ball grows up.
The best playing came from non
conference schools, particularly on
the part of Jimmy Phelan's St. Ma
ry's Gaels. The ex-Washington men
tor and charges pushed the dream
team from Cal right back on its
heels, although losing a 6-0 verdict
on a blocked kick in the third quar
ter. Santa Clara introduced a new
light half, Paul Vinolla, who paced
the Broncs to a 12-0 win over Utah.
Southern California's Trojans
completely forgot their fundamentals,
letting Tulane block, pass, and tackle
them at will, losing a 27-13 verdict
in Jeff Cravath s first tilt as Trojan
head. Another California school,
Leland Stanford Jr., also lost a foot
ball game.
In the northland, Oregon State
walloped the frustrated Vandals from
the University of Idaho, 32-0. Which
proves little since both Idaho and
Montana, which lost to Brigham
Young 12-6, had a hard time finding

the 28 men to fill out their allowed i
quota anyway.
Washington likewise had less com- I
petition in Stagg's College of the
Pacific outfit, winning 27-0 with the
sparkling play of a couple of sophs,
Mickey McCardle and Erickson.
St. Mary's Pre-Flight School, in
cluding Ensign Frank Culling Al
bert, pulled a last-minute field goal
to beat Oregon, 10-9. T.C.U. out
lasted U.C.L.A., 7-6.
Hence California and S..C have a
lot of face to save for the publicity
directors, Stanford will have a better
team, 0.5.C., Washington, and Wash
ington State have much hope, U.C.-
L.A. has some hope, and Idaho and
Montana have little.
