# Wolter to Manage Murals; Firemen Aim for Grid Title
## 
### 
Given enthusiastic support by School of Health officials despite the fact
that a student manager will not be hired, Stanford's 1!)42 intramural
football schedule will open sometime in the next two weeks, guided by the
Farm's baseball mentor, Harry Wolter,
Students will be excused from athletic classes which conflict with

scheduled intramural games, Dr. O.
N. Anderson, director of the School
of Health, stated yesterday.
"Last year's program was such a
success that we want this year's to
be a bigger and better part of our
program," Anderson said.
FIREIIOUSE STILL HOT?
Destined to be perhaps the biggest
and best part of the fall grid race,
(he Firehouse, almost habitual win
ner of the trophy, has already turned
out for practice. But there are con
siderable gaps in the squad that
barely squeezed past Kappa Sigma
for a 9-7 title win last year.
Missing are Wy Cripe, who booted
that winning field goal, and both of
the Pfyls, Frank at end, and Monte,
best intramural football back the
Farm had. George Kaufman is in
the Army. Back from the title squad
are ends Berryessa and Farrell, and
hall back Tom Kruger. Filling in
Pfyl's shoes will be Jerry Roin
staedt, and Frank Wheeler, Si O'-
Donnell, and Bob Rueben complete
the squad.
AUG TURNOUT SEEN
Until the league schedules are
drawn up, the grouping of teams and
their probable chances won't be
known, but the -Kappa Sigs, Alpha
Delts, Dekes, and Zetes report
strength which will give the Blaze
Chasers trouble.
More than 500 students are ex
pected to play mural ball this fall,
in addition to the volleyball, basket
ball, track, horseshoe, tennis, and
relay events scheduled for the rest
of the year.
The decision to leave the position
of student manager open, without

the appointment of a successor to
Red Holman, was reached at a B.A.C.
committee meeting last spring.
