# WHERE DO THEY GO FROM SATURDAY?

Stanford's first football game has
flown to the great beyond. Now the
question is: how are they going to
make out for the remainder of the
season, especially in next two
week's two non-conference games
against Santa Clara and Notre Dame?
We think they'll do swell. We'll
do so much belter that this de
partment is already to pick the
Indians over the Broncos on the
basis of what a week of practice
can do to a team that must find
itself after going through an open
ing contest greener than a guy
who needs Mothersill's.

Tell y'a how and why we can do it.
First of all, our offense.
It you were there you know it wasn't like in the days of old. Instead
it was cold and looked uninspired. If you weren't there, you probably rend
about it, and writers said Stanford was impotent. But if you looked further
and deeper into the messy six-love debacle, you could see that word
green. G-R-E-E-N it shone, right through the T formation and it left
the Redskins pretty sick around the gills.
But no wonder they looked green!
For the first time in his football career quarterback Ray Hammett was
asked to go the route. And Ray did almost play the entire game at that.
Ilis passing was tolerable. Account some of that wobbliness to nerv
ousness of a "first" game. But the Duke can pass. We know that from
the accounts of last year's Oregon State game at Corvallis. lie clicked 'em
mighty well lor Stanford and he can do it again when some of that
pressure is relieved.
The rest ot the Card backfield, the runners and pass snatchers, were
sparked along by Buck Fawcett, whose one year of experience made him
the best back back on the field for the Red and White.
A1 Hoisch and Don Zappettini will need this week of preparation per
haps more than anyone else. Bill Sheller, experienced right half, was kick
ing admirably. The "rock" will do okeh and can be counted on.
Other halfbacks who "benched it" during the game, Fred Snnderman,
Ross Dana, Larry Dee, Clem Woods, Russ Peck, will probably work into
next Saturday's game and will make the halfback spots nice and deep.
r lhe sterling play of Stanford's soph ends brought much praise from
Man-hie Schwartz, the Indians' soft-spoken coach. Dave Brown. Boh
Hall, and Pete August are the trio, and all Tackled with a viciousncss that
hcfoozled their elders, Roger Laverty and Hank Norberg.
That "tackle to tackle" team we spoke about before the game was in
there all right, but wasn't quite its old self.
Milt Vucinich was toiling at a job new to him. It was so new to him
that Loren Laprade centered for Sheller's punts. On the defense Voos
tackled well, but tackling is a sticking point.
As a whole, the teams' tackling was sloppy except for the soph end trio.
Deftness and sureness along that line will come only with the heavy scrim
maging slated for the coming week.
How about that pass defense?
Jay Stoves of the "hot" Stoves seemed a passing fool against Stan
ford Saturday. But those aerials didn't hit home because (lie Indian
pass defense is wrong. It was because the boys didn't know their as
signments well. At any rate there were times when three Stanford
players tagged one man, while another Cougar received was clear.
