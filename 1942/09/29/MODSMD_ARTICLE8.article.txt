# Co-op Bookstore to Shutdown Following Liquidation Sales
## 
### BILL STEIF 
A "nolde experiment" came to an end this week.
The Co-operative Bookstore, begun in the fall of by the now
defunct Stanford branch of the American Student Union, will lie liqui
dated in the next four weeks because of a $75 loss which the organization
sustained this summer, according to Bill Moran, A.S.S.U. Student Manager.

â™¦ "Liquidation of the bookstore,"
said Moran, "will fall into three defi
nite stages." The first will be the
sale at prevailing prices of all books
which the Co-op now has on hand,
i This means that students who now
have books on consignment at the
bookstore will get the money prom
ised them if their books are sold.
ON SALE THIS WEEK
Ben Miller will be in the Co-op,
room 15 on the top floor of the Old
Union, today, tomorrow, Thursday,
i and Friday of this week from 1 to 5
p.m. selling the large stock of text
books which the bookstore has
stored up. Miller will also be on
hand to peddle any texts which re
main during the second week of the
quarter, although his hours for next
week have not yet been announced.
At the end of the next week, ac
cording to Moran, the bookstore will
be held open for one more week in
order that students whose books
have not been sold can go up to room
15 and claim their unsold texts. "At
the end of the third week of the
quarter," stated Moran, "the A.S.S.U.
will take over all unsold and un
claimed books. Any money which
the A.S.S.U. makes from these un
claimed books will be held in a fund
by the Associated Students for a
number of months to take care of
any justified claims on the bookstore,
and then these funds will revert to
the A.S.S.U."
RESELLING STOPPED
Moran pointed out that the book
store will not accept any more books
from students to be sold. He also
| emphasized that those books now
| on hand are all textbooks for courses
; given at Stanford.
The Co-operative Bookstore was
[ reorganized last winter after the
j mysterious disappearance of $50 of
i its funds. Previous to that time it
; had been an organization independ
ent of the A.S.S.U. The bookstore
had been sanctioned by Chancellor
Wilbur and Excom when it was first
begun in 1938. Its difficulty of last
winter brought it under the scru
: tiny of the A.S.S.U., and its reor
ganization brought it into the A.S.-
S.U.'s financial set-up for what was
then termed "a trial period."
Because of the $75 loss which the
organization sustained this summer,
Excom this week decided that the
experiment had been unsatisfactory
and proceeded to give Moran the
green light on liquidation plans.
