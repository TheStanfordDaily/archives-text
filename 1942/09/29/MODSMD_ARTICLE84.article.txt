# More Units
## 
### 
Freshmen registered yesterday and all other
students will turn in those complicated
books today. While standing in line waiting
to turn that $143 check over to the University,
why not stop and ask yourself if you are tak
ing enough units with real value? For the frosh
who have registered, there is still plenty of
time to change.
The purpose of this campaign to get students
to take more than the minimum of units is
solely to help us get as much as possible out
of college while we are here on borrowed time.
We owe this to ourselves, to our parents who
are supporting us, and to our country so that
we will be well trained for service and for the
reconstruction after the war.
