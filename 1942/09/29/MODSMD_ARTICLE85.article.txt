# Sacrifice for Victory
## 
### 
We are going to be asked to do a lot of un
pleasant things this quarter which will
seem unreasonable and unfair, but there are
sound, logical reasons behind these requests.
Stanford students have started helping pick
crops in this valley and will be asked from
time to time to work in fields and possibly in
canneries to relieve the labor shortage.
We have all heard that we must sacrifice to
win the war. We have read the messages from
men who have spent months of hell in Japa
nese prison camps. We have listened to men
who have fought in the Atlantic and Pacific.
They all agree that the help that we at home
are providing is appreciated but not adequate.
This is our big opportunity to show those who
are risking their lives for us that we can and
will help.
So, don't laugh and say, "That's not for me,"
when a very efficient looking person asks you
to pick beans next week.
