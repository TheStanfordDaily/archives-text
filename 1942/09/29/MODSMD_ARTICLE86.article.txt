# Dark Sundays
## 
### 
The door was locked and a terrible oath
echoed across Lasuen from the Cellar.
"Sunday night and no cokes?" Joe couldn't
understand why he was locked out of his
favorite campus rendevous. And there will be
plenty of Joes like Joe who will scream and
yell until they've run every legitimate argu
ment into the ground.
Why will the Cellar close its doors Sundays?
Because, believe it or not, the search for greener
pastures on the part of the potwashers, dish
washers, and cooks has left the Union with
just about one-half as many helpers as is neces
sary to serve students and guests seven days
a week.
All of us have been guilty of unjust and un
founded remarks concerning the Cellar. As is
the case in every dispute, one has to look into
both sides of the case and then form a sensible
conclusion from the facts at hand. When the
Union Board of Governors decided to close the
Cellar on Sundays, it discovered that this would
force some students to eat off-campus for break
fast and lunch. That problem is solved in the
following manner:
Branner, Toyon, and Encina men will still be
able to use the store at Encina. Men from Se
quoia, the Row, and other living groups can use
the main dining room in the Union. In this way
the students will still be served and the Cellar
will be able to keep its head above water for
the duration.
So, Joe, you'll forget several times on Sun
days, but if you have brains enough to be in
college, you will understand.
