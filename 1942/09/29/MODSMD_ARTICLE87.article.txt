### TED NORTON WHAT ABOUT RUSSIA 
WHAT has Russia lost so far? Nothing but its great
agricultural and industxial resources of the south,
about 40 million of its population, and number of
soldiers which some German sources set as high as
10 million! And its remaining food and oil resources
are seriously threatened.
IJITLER' S object is not necessarily to destroy and
occupy all the U.S.S.R.; he needs only to weaken
Russia to the point that it is no longer an immediate
offensive threat. The Russians will continue to fight,
I think we can be sure of that, but with shortages of
men and supplies they cannot, however fine their spirit,
fight as well as they have fought.
IF Germany's generals can stabilize the Eastern front,
shoving across the Volga in the south and backing
up their lines with an "Eastwall" of prepared positions,
they will be able to release divisions for service else
where, on the Atlantic Coast, in Africa, or in the Near
East. A second front would be impossible then, if it
is impossible now.
we cannot count on winter to save the day for
us. The Nazis were more or less unprepared for
last year's cold weather, and they were neither frozen
out, nor driven out by the Soviets. No one has yet suc
cessfully claimed that the German High Command is
stupid. They will be prepared for this winter.

is to be done? Our military leaders tell us
that a second front is impossible and all our shout
ing for an immediate push will be of no avail if our
generals and admirals cannot act. The blunt fact would
seem to be that the armies of the United Nations in
Europe are not yet a match for the German armies.
And if they are not, it would be disastrous to try to
meet the Nazis on the field.
if we could land in France, and Dieppe was
not an over-encouraging episode, to land and be
defeated would be not only disastrous, but useless.
All the work of preparation would be to do again,
Russia would not be saved, and incidentally, millions
of our men would be dead or Nazi prisoners.
still-born Second Front would be worse than no
second front at all. All we can do, then, is what
we are doing, sending supplies, bombing Germany,
and waiting. The time will come when we will be
stronger than the Axis, and to build up to that point
must be our present goal.
