### CHESLEY SAROYAN 
TO TIIE FRESIIMEN
Hello, young man. Hello, young woman.
You have graduated from high school. You have
left your homes, and are now at Stanford University.
You are no longer adolescents. You are young men and
women. You are grown up, you are in a university, and
you are free to do almost whatever you want to do in
the next four years. It is up to you.
You can spend your time learning to be a doctor.
You can spend long hours in the labs, learning about
the human body, experimenting and dissecting the
bodies of little animals. You can spend long hours in
your room memorizing the names and the positions of
the bones of the body, of the muscles of the body, of the
organs of the body, about the nerves and the blood of
the body. And you can know what to do with these
parts of the body when they are not working right,
and then you can go out and help people when they
cough, when their stomachs pain them, when their
teeth decay and turn green, when their skin contracts
a disease. You can learn these things and go out and
help people.
You can spend your time in bars along the Penin
sula or in San Francisco. You can drink. Whiskey.
You can feel abnormal. And beer. And you can learn
the names of drinks. A Dry Martini and an Old Fash
ion. A Gimlet. A King Alphonse, or a shot of bourbon
straight, or some Scotch with soda or with water. You
can drink. Whiskey. And beer and wine and liquers.
And feel abnormal.
You can learn about economics. You can learn about
production, about distribution, about consumers curves,
and business cycles and why they are important and
why we keep having them. And about money and
banking and trusts and monopolies and why they arc
important and why we keep having them. And about
supply and demand and about taxation and about the
law of diminishing returns, and about depressions and
hunger and the profit system and capitalism and why
all this is important and why this is the best way to
supply to the people the things that they need and why
we keep using this system. You can learn all these
things and become a businessman. Or a Socialist.
You can be a politician. You can say hello to every
one and be liked by everyone, and serve on a dance
committee, and then help take down the decorations
after the dance, and then you can be chairman of Back
to the Farm Day, then get elected to Ex-Committee, and
then be elected President of the Student Body and have
your picture all over the Quad, and have people point
at you at dances and at the games.
You can be an athlete. You can make a letter in
football, in basketball, in track and tennis, and you
can see your picture in the sporting green and you can
read about yourself and hear people talking about you,
and in the morning you can lie in bed and look at your
picture in the Green section and read about yourself.
And keep a scrap book.
You can read philosophers. You can try to find out
about the world, how it started, why it started, what
people are, where they are going, whether there is a
purpose to the world and to the living, or if it is all
a matter of accident. And also if there is a God or
not. You can read philosophers and be a philosopher
and dedicate your life to answering these questions.
You can spend your time having dates. You can
take a different girl out every week or every night,
and you can make a tremendous impression on many
by telling them how successful you were in making
the girls forget the simple rules that are necessary for
intelligent, healthy living.
And you can do lots of other things. You can learn
to be a teacher or a psychologist or a historian or a
priest or a newspaperman, or a sculptor or an electri
cian, or you can sit in the Union and drink cokes and
play bridge, and play ping pong, or bet on whether one
horse will beat another horse, or that one card will be
higher than another card, or that the little black dots
on the dice will be in your favor. Or you can go swim
ming in the lake when there is water in it, or take
walks around the campus and look at the squirrels,
or buy records and play them on your phonographs.
You are out of high school.
You have been in the world around eighteen years.
You have passed tests that show you are intelligent.
You are free to do what you want, to spend your
time in any way you want, to learn what you want, and
to be what you want. It is up to you. I only ask you
to try to brush aside the obvious and the sensational,
and to choose the solid and the sound. I only ask you
to learn habits that will be enjoyable and valuable to
you for the rest of your life, so that your life will be
even and smooth and balanced and full, so that when
you are old you can look back at your life, and smile,
and feel glad that you were alive, and proud that you
had a chance to live, and then you will be ready to die.
And if you do, everyone will cry and be sorry that you
died. And thev will burv von.

we keep using this system. You can learn all these
things and become a businessman. Or a Socialist.
You can be a politician. You can say hello to every
one and be liked by everyone, and serve on a dance
committee, and then help take down the decorations
after the dance, and then you can be chairman of Back
to the Farm Day, then get elected to Ex-Committee, and
then be elected President of the Student Body and have
your picture all over the Quad, and have people point
at you at dances and at the games.
You can be an athlete. You can make a letter in
football, in basketball, in track and tennis, and you
can see your picture in the sporting green and you can
read about yourself and hear people talking about you,
and in the morning you can lie in bed and look at your
picture in the Green section and read about yourself.
And keep a scrap book.
You can read philosophers. You can try to find out
about the world, how it started, why it started, what
people are, where they are going, whether there is a
purpose to the world and to the living, or if it is all
a matter of accident. And also if there is a God or
not. You can read philosophers and be a philosopher
and dedicate your life to answering these questions.
You can spend your time having dates. You can
take a different girl out every week or every night,
and you can make a tremendous impression on many
by telling them how successful you were in making
the girls forget the simple rules that are necessary for
intelligent, healthy living.
And you can do lots of other things. You can learn
to be a teacher or a psychologist or a historian or a
priest or a newspaperman, or a sculptor or an electri
cian, or you can sit in the Union and drink cokes and
play bridge, and play ping pong, or bet on whether one
horse will beat another horse, or that one card will be
higher than another card, or that the little black dots
on the dice will be in your favor. Or you can go swim
ming in the lake when there is water in it, or take
walks around the campus and look at the squirrels,
or buy records and play them on your phonographs.
You are out of high school.
You have been in the world around eighteen years.
You have passed tests that show you are intelligent.
You are free to do what you want, to spend your
time in any way you want, to learn what you want, and
to be what you want. It is up to you. I only ask you
to try to brush aside the obvious and the sensational,
and to choose the solid and the sound. I only ask you
to learn habits that will be enjoyable and valuable to
you for the rest of your life, so that your life will be
even and smooth and balanced and full, so that when
you are old you can look back at your life, and smile,
and feel glad that you were alive, and proud that you
had a chance to live, and then you will be ready to die.
And if you do, everyone will cry and be sorry that you
died. And thev will burv von.

ming in the lake when there is water in it, or take
walks around the campus and look at the squirrels,
or buy records and play them on your phonographs.
You are out of high school.
You have been in the world around eighteen years.
You have passed tests that show you are intelligent.
You are free to do what you want, to spend your
time in any way you want, to learn what you want, and
to be what you want. It is up to you. I only ask you
to try to brush aside the obvious and the sensational,
and to choose the solid and the sound. I only ask you
to learn habits that will be enjoyable and valuable to
you for the rest of your life, so that your life will be
even and smooth and balanced and full, so that when
you are old you can look back at your life, and smile,
and feel glad that you were alive, and proud that you
had a chance to live, and then you will be ready to die.
And if you do, everyone will cry and be sorry that you
died. And thev will burv von.

Hello, young man. Hello, young woman.
You have graduated from high school. You have
left your homes, and are now at Stanford University.
You are no longer adolescents. You are young men and
women. You are grown up, you are in a university, and
you are free to do almost whatever you want to do in
the next four years. It is up to you.
You can spend your time learning to be a doctor.
You can spend long hours in the labs, learning about
the human body, experimenting and dissecting the
bodies of little animals. You can spend long hours in
your room memorizing the names and the positions of
the bones of the body, of the muscles of the body, of the
organs of the body, about the nerves and the blood of
the body. And you can know what to do with these
parts of the body when they are not working right,
and then you can go out and help people when they
cough, when their stomachs pain them, when their
teeth decay and turn green, when their skin contracts
a disease. You can learn these things and go out and
help people.
You can spend your time in bars along the Penin
sula or in San Francisco. You can drink. Whiskey.
You can feel abnormal. And beer. And you can learn
the names of drinks. A Dry Martini and an Old Fash
ion. A Gimlet. A King Alphonse, or a shot of bourbon
straight, or some Scotch with soda or with water. You
can drink. Whiskey. And beer and wine and liquers.
And feel abnormal.
You can learn about economics. You can learn about
production, about distribution, about consumers curves,
and business cycles and why they are important and
why we keep having them. And about money and
banking and trusts and monopolies and why they arc
important and why we keep having them. And about
supply and demand and about taxation and about the
law of diminishing returns, and about depressions and
hunger and the profit system and capitalism and why
all this is important and why this is the best way to
supply to the people the things that they need and why
we keep using this system. You can learn all these
things and become a businessman. Or a Socialist.
You can be a politician. You can say hello to every
one and be liked by everyone, and serve on a dance
committee, and then help take down the decorations
after the dance, and then you can be chairman of Back
to the Farm Day, then get elected to Ex-Committee, and
then be elected President of the Student Body and have
your picture all over the Quad, and have people point
at you at dances and at the games.
You can be an athlete. You can make a letter in
football, in basketball, in track and tennis, and you
can see your picture in the sporting green and you can
read about yourself and hear people talking about you,
and in the morning you can lie in bed and look at your
picture in the Green section and read about yourself.
And keep a scrap book.
You can read philosophers. You can try to find out
about the world, how it started, why it started, what
people are, where they are going, whether there is a
purpose to the world and to the living, or if it is all
a matter of accident. And also if there is a God or
not. You can read philosophers and be a philosopher
and dedicate your life to answering these questions.
You can spend your time having dates. You can
take a different girl out every week or every night,
and you can make a tremendous impression on many
by telling them how successful you were in making
the girls forget the simple rules that are necessary for
intelligent, healthy living.
And you can do lots of other things. You can learn
to be a teacher or a psychologist or a historian or a
priest or a newspaperman, or a sculptor or an electri
cian, or you can sit in the Union and drink cokes and
play bridge, and play ping pong, or bet on whether one
horse will beat another horse, or that one card will be
higher than another card, or that the little black dots
on the dice will be in your favor. Or you can go swim
ming in the lake when there is water in it, or take
walks around the campus and look at the squirrels,
or buy records and play them on your phonographs.
