# Pacific Islands Fear Disease
## Mai aria, Plague May Hinder War Efforts 
### 
The irregular conditions of war
time transportation routes and
shortages of quinine and anti-mala
rial agents have advanced the
threat of epidemics of malaria and
plague in the Pacific islands, ac
cording to Edward P. Mumford. re
search associate in biology at Stan
ford University.
Because of this dangerous situa
tion, "further knowledge of plague
carrying and potentially plague
carrying rats and mice may serve
to avert epidemics among the army
and civilian populations," the biolo
gist states in the current issue of the
American Scientist.
Mr. Mumford, who is studying this
problem with outstanding special
ists in the United States and Great
Britain, declares that these diseases,
which have always been a danger in
the Pacific zone, might, in fact, frame
the outcome of an entire campaign.
He points out New Caledonia, an
important island connecting the
America and Australia supply route,
and Hawaii and other islands of the
Central Pacific as important places
which may forfeit their defense
against malaria before the war is
ended. More casualties in the last
war were due to this disease than to
any other, he says.
