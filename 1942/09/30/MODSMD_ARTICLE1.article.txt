# Russians Halt Huge Drive Against Northwestern Outskirts of Stalingrad
## Nazis Lose 29 of 50 Tanks, 1500 Men in Two Complete Divisions As Reds Hold Original Positions

MOSCOW, WEDNESDAY. SEPT. 30 (U.R).—The new drive launched
by two German divisions and 50 tanks in the northwestern outskirts of
Stalingrad has been halted and the Germans have lost 1,.»00 men and
29 tanks in one day's fighting there, the Soviet high command announced
today.

German tanks and infantry, sup-,
ported by airplanes, made one attack
after another in that sector all day
Tuesday and at nightfall the Russians
still were holding their original po
sitions, the midnight communique
revealed.
Warships of the Soviet Volga flo
tilla annihilated parts of two Ger
man infantry battalions, the com
munique said.
Earlier front dispatches had re
ported that German artillery was
systematically bombarding the Volga
crossings at Stalingrad from newly
won heights in the northwestern part
of the city.
The communique said Soviet troops
stilJ were "engaged in active fight
ing operations" farther northwest of
Stalingrad, where their week-long
counter-offensive has threatened to
turn the German flank. In that sector
a single Russian unit has slain 2,000
Germans and destroyed 49 tanks and
18 field guns in three days of fight
ing, the high command revealed.
German prisoners were quoted as
saying that one Nazi tank division
and a motorized infantry division
have been routed in that three-day
battle and that some companies (nor
mally containing about 250 men) had
only 15 or 20 survivors.
In the Mozdok sector of the Cau
casus, 350 Germans were killed.
Tanks destroyed and a number of
attacks repulsed, the communique
said. At one point the Russians were
pressed back, but, bolstered by rein
forcements, they counter-attacked
and threw the Germans back to their
original positions, the communique
said.
It also reported 300 Rumanian Al
pine troops were killed in a futile
attack on the Soviet lines southeast
of Novorossisk, on the Black Sea,
and 200 more Germans were killed
on the Leningrad front.
The main battles now raged in two
sectors northwest of Stalingrad, one
in the city's outskirts, and the other
on the barren steppes between the
Volga and Don rivers farther north
west. On the latter front, Marshal
Semyon Timoshenko's relief army
was reported in front dispatches to be
forging slowly but steadily ahead on
a 50-mile front.
Red Star, the army organ, revealed
that Russian troops are still on the
west bank of the Don, which the
Germans crossed to lay siege to
Stalingrad 37 days ago. The Gov
ernment newspaper Izvestia said
Soviet guns have destroyed several
pontoon bridges and sunk numerous
troop-laden boats trying to cross
the Don the last few days.
The flaming brush country around
Stalingrad was described by Izvestia
as "a living hell, whose crossroads
arc controlled by Soviet signal men."
Rain has not fallen on the steppes for
three months and German planes are
setting the brush afire with incen
diary bottles.
Water wells are rare and the water
found is salty. Izvestia's correspond
ent Eugene Kriger said. On a land
scape stripped bare of every hut,
tree and blade of grass, men burrow
underground to let the flames sweep
through the dry brush above them,
then emerge and continue their
march. The day time winds are still
hot, Kriger said, but there was frost
in Stalingrad last night.

MOSCOW, WEDNESDAY. SEPT. 30 (U.R).—The new drive launched
by two German divisions and 50 tanks in the northwestern outskirts of
Stalingrad has been halted and the Germans have lost 1,.»00 men and
29 tanks in one day's fighting there, the Soviet high command announced
today.

German tanks and infantry, sup-,
ported by airplanes, made one attack
after another in that sector all day
Tuesday and at nightfall the Russians
still were holding their original po
sitions, the midnight communique
revealed.
Warships of the Soviet Volga flo
tilla annihilated parts of two Ger
man infantry battalions, the com
munique said.
Earlier front dispatches had re
ported that German artillery was
systematically bombarding the Volga
crossings at Stalingrad from newly
won heights in the northwestern part
of the city.
The communique said Soviet troops
stilJ were "engaged in active fight
ing operations" farther northwest of
Stalingrad, where their week-long
counter-offensive has threatened to
turn the German flank. In that sector
a single Russian unit has slain 2,000
Germans and destroyed 49 tanks and
18 field guns in three days of fight
ing, the high command revealed.
German prisoners were quoted as
saying that one Nazi tank division
and a motorized infantry division
have been routed in that three-day
battle and that some companies (nor
mally containing about 250 men) had
only 15 or 20 survivors.
In the Mozdok sector of the Cau
casus, 350 Germans were killed.
Tanks destroyed and a number of
attacks repulsed, the communique
said. At one point the Russians were
pressed back, but, bolstered by rein
forcements, they counter-attacked
and threw the Germans back to their
original positions, the communique
said.
It also reported 300 Rumanian Al
pine troops were killed in a futile
attack on the Soviet lines southeast
of Novorossisk, on the Black Sea,
and 200 more Germans were killed
on the Leningrad front.
The main battles now raged in two
sectors northwest of Stalingrad, one
in the city's outskirts, and the other
on the barren steppes between the
Volga and Don rivers farther north
west. On the latter front, Marshal
Semyon Timoshenko's relief army
was reported in front dispatches to be
forging slowly but steadily ahead on
a 50-mile front.
Red Star, the army organ, revealed
that Russian troops are still on the
west bank of the Don, which the
Germans crossed to lay siege to
Stalingrad 37 days ago. The Gov
ernment newspaper Izvestia said
Soviet guns have destroyed several
pontoon bridges and sunk numerous
troop-laden boats trying to cross
the Don the last few days.
The flaming brush country around
Stalingrad was described by Izvestia
as "a living hell, whose crossroads
arc controlled by Soviet signal men."
Rain has not fallen on the steppes for
three months and German planes are
setting the brush afire with incen
diary bottles.
Water wells are rare and the water
found is salty. Izvestia's correspond
ent Eugene Kriger said. On a land
scape stripped bare of every hut,
tree and blade of grass, men burrow
underground to let the flames sweep
through the dry brush above them,
then emerge and continue their
march. The day time winds are still
hot, Kriger said, but there was frost
in Stalingrad last night.
