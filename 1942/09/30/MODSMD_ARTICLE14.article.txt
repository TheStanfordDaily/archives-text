# Fall Reg Dance Draws over 500
## Line Half-block Long Forms to Buy Bids 
### 
One of the biggest crowds ever to
attend the traditional Reg Dance
filled the Women's Gym last night
to dance to the latest records of big
name hands. Lured by the promise
of prizes for best performances in
the foxtrot and the rhumba, and by
the low admission price, approxi
mately 500 couples celebrated the
end of Registration Day.
At one time the line of couples
waiting to buy bids at the door
reached a half a block from the en
trance.
"It turned out to be one of the
most successful dances in recent
years," Chairman Carl Livingston
stated. "Apparently, Stanford stu
dents are getting into the habit of
celebrating on-campus rather than
off."
Dress for the dance, which lasted
from 9-12 p.m., was informal. Cider
and doughnuts were served as re
freshments. The low admission, a
contributing factor to the success of
the dance, was 50 cents, plus 5 cents
tax.
