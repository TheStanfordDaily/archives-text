# Roble Women Like Working For Farmers
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Nine girls went tomato-picking
Monday. They donned their oldest
jeans, clainhered into a farmer's
truck and were off to the Mountain
View Berry Farm where they spent
a novel day in the fields with Jesse,
the foreman.
Barbara Sadler, Roble president,
laughed as she related her experi
ences with tomatoes that should have
been picked sooner. She told us how
desperately the farmers needed more
of these girls, and how exuberant
they were to have those few. They
showed their gratitude by serving
the girls iced watermelons and get
ting them gloves for their reddening
hands.
Those who worked on the farm
Monday were scouts. They learned
just what they would be required to
do and how many hands were need
ed. They brought home a favorable
report, and yesterday a second con
tingent of lower division women, 16
in all, returned to fill tomato lugs.
KESSLEIi HELPS
But Roble women weren't alone in
bolstering farm labor. Jim Kessler,
of the Stanford War Board, got wind
of the movement and recruited an
entire fraternity to pick prunes be
low San Jose. And the YWCA took
up the cry by packing lunches for
all fruit pickers.
By the time the prunes and toma
toes are picked, the bean fields will
be ready for harvest. After the beans
there will be other crops.
As Barbara Sadler remarked, "It
looks as if this is only a beginning
.... there's work to be done all
year, and Stanford should be down
in those fields every weekend."
And maybe Stanford will, for the
SWB has shown interest and may
take over the scheme and put it on
a larger working scale, as repre
sentatives of Roble are hoping.
WORK NOT STRAINING'
According to Barbara, the work is
not straining and if taken in the right
spirit, is a "whale of a good time."
Foreman Jesse, who speaks a hybrid
Spanish-English, made the day easy
with his Latin humor. He contrived
a lottery and gave the tomatoes he
pickcd to the girl who guessed, the
lucky number. They were paid by
the lug and worked in the spirit of
competition. Jesse presented them
with the largest tomatoes picked,
and they returned to the campus
with a basket of fruit the size of
melons, which they solemnly gave
to Dean Yost.
Miss Pat Davidson, YWCA, Miss
Helen Vincent, California Employ
ment Bureau, Miss Grace Glenn,
Roble Dining Hall Director, Janet
McClanahan, YWCA, Lucille Ter
rell, Women's Conference President,
Jim Kessler, SWB and Barbara Sad
ler are responsible for mobilization
of the fruit picking corps.
They have started the ball rolling,
but need more volunteers. Students
interested in aiding the acute farm
labor shortage are referred to Jim
Kessler, War Board office.
