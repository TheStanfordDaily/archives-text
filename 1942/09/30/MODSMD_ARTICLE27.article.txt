# Farm Fall Registration Drops 10.4 Per Cent to 3525 Total; Women's Enrollment Climbs
## Figures Show Famed 2 to 1 Ratio Falls as Men Drop 433 Students, Leaving 1.6 Males to Each Woman 
### BILL STEIF 
Totaling 3525 men and women, yesterday's registration for Stanford's
Fall Quarter showed a drop of 10.4 per cent over last falifs registration.
This decrease, however, came wholly from masculine ranks, for only
2197 men registered yesterday as compared to 2(>30 a year ago—a decline
of 433.
This knocked Stanford's famed, old ratio of 2 to 3 men for every woman

"on campus into the proverbial
cocked hat, for the registration of
women in the University yesterday
soared to a record-breaking total
of 1328, well above last year's 130<>,
and brought the ratio down to where
there are now only 1.659 men to
every woman on the Farm.
The ratio a year ago this fall whs
just over two men to every Stanford
woman.
OFFICIALS PLEASED
The response of University offi
cials to so comparatively small a
drop was one of pleasant surprise.
Farm Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur, in commenting upon this fall's
registration, said, "considering the
wartime situation, our registration
was remarkable."
"The whole picture is very en
couraging," he continued, "for it in
dicates that the students arc really
serious about continuing their Uni
versity work." Concerning the pos
sibility of further registration drops
in future quarters, Chancellor Wil
bur stated, "We can't know how our
registration will hold up as that
depends principally upon what the
Army does."
LATE GAINS EXPECTED
The Chancellor added that he be
lieved the University's operation on
a full-time, four-quarter system
(summer registration was two and
a half times above that of the pre
vious summer) has also been a help
ful educational stimulus.
Further registration gains will
probably be shown today, as there
are usually 75 to 150 students who
register late.
