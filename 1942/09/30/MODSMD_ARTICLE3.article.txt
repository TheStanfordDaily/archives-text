# Police to Nab 'Over-35' Cars
## 
### 
SACRAMENTO, Sept. 29 (UP).—
A 35-mile-per-hour speed limit will
bo enforced in California starting
Thursday, it was announced tonight
by Director of Motor Vehicles James
M. Carter, despite an informal opin
ion of Attorney General Earl War
ren that the lowered limit cannot go
into effect without a special session
of the Legislature.
Carter ordered the Highway Pa
trol to arrest violators of the 35-
mile sfjeed limit whenever condi
tions, such as weather, condition of
pavement, condition of the tires or
vehicle warrant the assumption that
a speed of greater than 35 miles an
hour is unsafe and dangerous to
life or property. The new policy is
part of a federal rubber conserva
tion program.
NO AUTHORITY'
Warren, in Fresno, commented
that the Highway Patrol has no
authority to change the statutory
55-mile-per-hour speed limit and
the lower rate can be enforced only
in dimout areas where safety would
be jeopardized by higher speeds.
Warren indicated he would not ac
tively oppose the new orders, how
ever.
Carter replied to Warren's re
marks that he "may be honestly of
this opinion or he may think that
such a position is good political am
munition." Warren is a candidate
for Governor.
LIMIT PATRIOTIC
"I am convinced," Carter said,
"that through the co-operation of
patriotic citizens ... a uniform
35-mile limit will be observed upon
California highways."
Carter said enforcement will be
| aided through giving records of ci
tation to gasoline and rationing
boards, investigating records of
speeders for possible suspension of
licenses, and asking the Office of
Price Administration for authority
to take up the gasoline rationing
! books of violators.
