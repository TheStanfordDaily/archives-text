Jim Stone, '39, thought that when
he married Margaret Hale, also '39,
he'd be the boss.
But now he isn't at all sure. You
see, Jim is now a corporal in this
man's army and yesterday he re
ceived the news that his wife will
soon be commissioned a lieutenant,
third grade, in the Women's Aux
iliary Corps.
"Now that she ranks me," said
Corporal Stone quizzically, "I don't
now what the correct procedure will
be. Do I address my wife as 'sir'
and salute when she tells me to do
the dishes?"
"Imagine me saying, 'Lieutenant,
dear, may I have a nickel for a
cigar?" he continued morosely.
The Stones, Lieutenant and Cor
poral, were married in 1941. "8.A."
(before Army) the Stones lived at
New Haven, Conn., where the "little
Corporal" was an instructor at Yale.
Corporal Stone is the son of Dr.
and Mrs. Calvin P. Stone. Dr. Stone
is a member of the Stanford psy
chology department faculty.
