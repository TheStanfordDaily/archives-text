Reg Day, Oel. 1. litis .... Stan
ford men donned uniforms for the
duration as members of the Stu
dent's Training Corps .... frater
nities closed for the duration and
their houses were turned over to the
Army .... the Daily was published
only three times a week .... serv
ice flags hung outside living groups
designating the number of members
in service overseas (the Kappas and
Thetas had twelve each) ....
"Stanford will open next Monday
not primarily as a college but as a
military training camp" headlined
the Daily in its fall pre-registration
edition and went on to describe the
activities of the S.A.T.C. (Student
Army Training Corps).
All three branches of the service,
according to this article, were rep
resented in the training corps. Stu
dents who became members of the
naval, marine, or army units were
subject to military law and were
placed on an active duty status. The
Government provided tuition, uni
forms, barracks, and paid each stu
dent $30 a month.
TYPICAL DAY
The typical day of one of these
students wouldn't put the activities
of 1942's war babies in a very fa
vorable light. Up at 5:30, those
supermen of the other generation
drilled until 8, attended classes until
4, and were in bed by 9:30 every
night.
They weren't studying hygiene
and modern art either. During the
first term mathematics, descriptive
geometry, chemistry, and English
composition were required of every
student in the Corps. In addition at
least eleven hours a week of mili
tary instruction were given the
trainees.
Stanford's contributions in the
other war were ncJt confined to this
military training. More than five
field ambulance units were organized
on the campus and 125 Stanford men
cared for wounded soldiers on the
battlefields of France. Many women

students formed service and canteen
units also and were sent abroad.
C.RIM DAYS
Those were pretty grim days,
1917-1918, down on the Farm. The
student body worked harder then as
it is now to train themselves first
for the job of winning the war and
then for the reconstruction that was
to follow.
Life wasn't gay and it wasn't so
cial then and it may not be now.
Still it's kind of comforting to look
back and realize those other students
faced many of the same problems
and came through with only a few
scratches.

student in the Corps. In addition at
least eleven hours a week of mili
tary instruction were given the
trainees.
Stanford's contributions in the
other war were ncJt confined to this
military training. More than five
field ambulance units were organized
on the campus and 125 Stanford men
cared for wounded soldiers on the
battlefields of France. Many women

students formed service and canteen
units also and were sent abroad.
C.RIM DAYS
Those were pretty grim days,
1917-1918, down on the Farm. The
student body worked harder then as
it is now to train themselves first
for the job of winning the war and
then for the reconstruction that was
to follow.
Life wasn't gay and it wasn't so
cial then and it may not be now.
Still it's kind of comforting to look
back and realize those other students
faced many of the same problems
and came through with only a few
scratches.

Reg Day, Oel. 1. litis .... Stan
ford men donned uniforms for the
duration as members of the Stu
dent's Training Corps .... frater
nities closed for the duration and
their houses were turned over to the
Army .... the Daily was published
only three times a week .... serv
ice flags hung outside living groups
designating the number of members
in service overseas (the Kappas and
Thetas had twelve each) ....
"Stanford will open next Monday
not primarily as a college but as a
military training camp" headlined
the Daily in its fall pre-registration
edition and went on to describe the
activities of the S.A.T.C. (Student
Army Training Corps).
All three branches of the service,
according to this article, were rep
resented in the training corps. Stu
dents who became members of the
naval, marine, or army units were
subject to military law and were
placed on an active duty status. The
Government provided tuition, uni
forms, barracks, and paid each stu
dent $30 a month.
TYPICAL DAY
The typical day of one of these
students wouldn't put the activities
of 1942's war babies in a very fa
vorable light. Up at 5:30, those
supermen of the other generation
drilled until 8, attended classes until
4, and were in bed by 9:30 every
night.
They weren't studying hygiene
and modern art either. During the
first term mathematics, descriptive
geometry, chemistry, and English
composition were required of every
student in the Corps. In addition at
least eleven hours a week of mili
tary instruction were given the
trainees.
