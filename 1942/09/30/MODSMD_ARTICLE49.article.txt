### 
Stanford's 1942 intramural pro
gram is waiting for physical educa
i tion registration to be completed
before the first contests are begun,
but Harry Wolter, new coordinator
of the program, announced yester
day that lists for the tearrts to sign
should be ready by Friday.
As last year, Wolter expects up
ward of 500 men to repoirt for the
grid games. Probably the same pro
cedure as the preceding year will
be followed i - egarding schedules. Ten
leagues of five teams each would be
established, with the round-robin
winners of each of these leagues
playing a straight single elimination
tournament for the title.

Last year the Fi rehouse, Kappa
Sigma, Breakers, Deke, Toro, Encina
2E, Encina 4W. Alpha Delta Phi,
Sequoia, and Business School won
their respective titles to qualify for
the play-offs.
Later in the week The Stanford
Daily will present an analysis of the
teams reported to be entering the
leagues, listing veteran members and
probable strength.
Measuring 460 feet from side to

rated by grass plots and lines of
trees, Avenida Nueve de Julio, in
Buenos Aires, is the widest avenue
in the world.
