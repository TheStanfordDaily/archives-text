# Schwartz Irons Out Backfield Weakness
## 
### 
Not disheartened by their 6-0 de
feat by the Washington State Cou
gars, the Stanford Indians prepared
for two non-conference games in the
next two weeks. This Saturday the
Indians play the Santa Clara Broncos
at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco,
and on Oct. 10 the Cardinals jour
ney back to South Bend, Ind., to
meet Notre Dame.
Yesterday the Indians had two
hours of hard scrimmage and body
contact work. Coach Schwartz alter
nated Mark Caflfal and Ben Morri
son, a converted left halfback, at
quarterback on the second team.
Morrison, a deft lefthanded passer,
looked particularly good, and may
help solve the Indians weakness in
reserve quarterback.
Center Milt Vucinich, elected cap
tain for the Santa Clara game, was
back in uniform after a troublesome
charley horse which kept him out of
practice on Monday. Varsity End
Bob Hall was still out with a sprained
ankle, but he will suitup for today's
workout.
Coach Schwartz was worried about
the Santa Clara game. Reports of
last week's 12-0 Santa Clara victory
over Utah showed the Broncos have
a well-balanced team with a stand
out back in Tony Freitas. Freitas'
passing against Utah was remark
able, and the Indians are working
on their pass defense in preparation
for it.
The first bicycle with a rotary
crank was built in 18GG by Pierre
Illemont, who rode the machine from
Ansonia, Conn., to New Haven.
