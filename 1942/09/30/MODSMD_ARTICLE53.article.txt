# Pressure Group
## 
### 
THE United States is facing the most serious
threat to its parliamentary government in
recent history. A selfish pressure group—the
farm lobby—is effectively blocking enactment
of the urgently needed cost-of-living bill re
quested by President Roosevelt.
By holding the coming elections over the
heads of farm bloc Congressmen, the farm lobby
has been able to tack the Hatch Amendment
onto the cost-of-livnig bill. This amendment,
which requires the President to include farm
wages in the computation of parity, will raise
the cost of living by $4,000,000 annually, accord
ing to federal economists.
Thus, the Hatch Amendment has converted a
bill to stabilize the cost of living into a bill to
raise the cost of living.
President Roosevelt has bluntly told Congres
sional leaders that he will veto the cost-of-living
bill if the Hatch Amendment is included.
Administration leaders have attempted to
compromise with the farm bloc without success.
Senator Brown was told by farm bloc Senators
that he would have to deal with the heads of the
farm lobby rather than with the elected repre
sentatives of the farmer.
The stranglehold which the farm lobby has
over Congress raises the whole question of the
future of Congress.
If Congress is unable to function as the repre
sentative of the people, and has degenerated
into a tool for organized pressure groups, then
President Roosevelt has no choice but to as
sume the full reins of government.
The President's deadline for Congressional
action on the cost-of-living bill expires today.
Any effective action by Congress is very un
likely. Hence the President must act to control
the rising cost of living by Executive Order.
And when Mr. Roosevelt acts, Congress
ceases to perform its role in our democracy as
the true representative of the people. For this
the American people can thank the farm lobby
in Washington.—Charlie Allen
