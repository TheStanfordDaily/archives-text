IN a sense The Daily is Stanford's Hyde Park.
We have a Daily column, Campus Opinion,
which guarantees that the student's voice will
never be quelled, or much more likely will
never be lost in the rush. It is not done in the
same military fashion that the London bobbies
do, but we hope it is in the same friendly way.
This column is a safety valve, and an idea
exchange, and anyone may blow off steam or
put forward an idea, but the letters to the
editor must be signed. The author's name may
be withheld if he so desires, but to keep the
contributions within the bounds of propriety,
and on a somewhat serious plane, the signature
is necessary.
If the Union food, the band's music, or the
attitude of the Stanford women bothers you,
or if you have a way to cure hay fever, a
method to beat the draft, or a theory on winning
the war, write to the editor and express your
self. It's your column.—Al Hampson
