# See Excom Work
## 
### 
STANFORD UNIVERSITY has a student body
government, the ,egislative"powers of which
are vested in the Executive Committee, Excom.
Excom is Stanford's Congress, and like Con
gress it handles a great deal of business and
does many things, some of which are good and
some of which are bad, but all of them are
open for our inspection. More than this, we are
asked to attend these meetings and see some
of the troubles that face self-government at
even so small a group as Stanford.
At the Excom meeting, which will be held
tonight, some rather important things will be
discussed, and some new members will make
their debut.
Excom is made up of 15 members. Those
who have votes are: one graduate student, two
seniors, two juniors, two sophomores, a man
at-large, and the president and the vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U.
There are also a lot of ex-officio members
who make up the total. These people will carry
on the work of the student government. The
convention of college war boards which may

be held on the Stanford campus this quarter,
the Sunday evening movies, A1 Haas' pre-reg
istration report, and the Spring Show financial
report, will all occupy the time of the Excom.
Besides these things the usual menial business,
such as the granting of dates and the hearing
of reports, will be done.
Before you form any opinion either good or
bad about Excom and the people on it, come
and see student government in action. â€” A1
