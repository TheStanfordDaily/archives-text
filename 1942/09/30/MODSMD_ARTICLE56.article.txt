There are a number of ways to get into the armed
forces. You can be drafted; you can enlist in the Army,
in the Navy, in the Marines, in the Coast Guard, in
the Army Air Force, or the Navy Air Force. In most
of these there are subdivisions, as the several Naval
Reserve classifications, V-l, V-7, V-5, V-11, and, I
presume, all included numbers. The other forces have
their several classifications as well.
Now, here is the objectionable situation. Every one
of these services are competing with one another, try
ing each to sign the most desirable men for their team
without giving any consideration whatsoever to the
possible value of the man in any other of the forces,
or in any other employment. If, for instance, it was
decided that army aviators were the imperative need,
the greatest problem in procuring these flyers would
be to prevent the Navy or Marines from attracting
them to those services.
Furthermore, nearly all these services and their
subdivisions have different requirements. A man can
be in too poor physical shape to enlist in the Army,
but he can, on the other hand, be drafted or join the
Army enlisted reserve. A man who cannot qualify as
an apprentice seaman in the Navy, can get a rating or
even a commission in a Naval Reserve classification,
but not in all reserve classifications. And the opera
tion of these probably well-intentioned plans of or
ganization does not justify the confusion that results
in the mind of the average citizen who wants to serve
his country.

is a summary of the confused situation as re
gards fighting manpower alone. But, as I have
already said, there is a second, equally important clas
sification: producing men.
The military situation is confused more by red tape
than by actual problems of supply and demand, but
as regards productive labor, there are such problems.
There is no need for me to devote space to demon
strating that labor is poorly distributed, competition
for labor is nearly uncontrolled, and poorly organized
for maximum production.
Steps are being taken to change this picture. Inti
mations have come out of Washington, from McNutt
and Hershey in particular, that a national service act,
authorizing government action to put labor where it is
needed and to keep it there is on the way. This is the
proper and the only thing to do in the circumstances,
but it must be done with the horrible example of the
fighting manpower set-up clearly in mind. And it is
an excellent chance to put the entire manpower situa
tion right.
The advices from Washington contain a great deal
of material that may be included in such a law. Classi
fication of agriculture, classifications of industry and
industries, labor-freezing, wage stabilization and wage
subsidies, all this, mishandled, can develop into a situ
ation far more confused than even that extant. A clear
parallel with the present military situation may be
drawn; it can result in complete non-comprehension
as far as the aforesaid average citizen is concerned.
And if the program is not comprehensible, it won't
work!

J SAID that the enactment of this national service
legislation might be an excellent opportunity to put
the whole manpower situation straight. If a single
service authority is set up, granting to one commission,
or even individual, the last word on who does what and
where, both in the armed and producing services, order
will have started to emerge out of chaos. Among other
details, one set of physical and mental standards for
all the classifications of all the fighting forces should
be established, and, even more important, all recruit
ing by the several branches should end. Each service
and each agency of production should have the men
it needs assigned from a common pool of manpower,
and consideration should be given not only to what the
particular service or producer says it requires, but to
what the grand strategy of the whole war effort says it
can have. (The implications of that last statement are
broad, but only this one phase can be considered here
now.)
