# Stanford Defense Courses To Train 500 for War Work
## 
### 
The Stanford war production courses are steadily expanding to meet
the increased demands for trained workers in war industries. Five hun
dred men and women will be trained on the campus this fall, and several
times that many in the extension courses in San Francisco.
A course much in demand, "The Application of Statistics to Quality

Control in Industry," was given in
Los Angeles last week. The course
was conducted by Professors Hol
brook Working and Eugene L. Grant
of Stanford.
Thirty-five defense courses are
being given this month. This num
ber is expected to increase to 120 or
150 before the school year is over.
DEFENSE COURSES
Three thousand people have al
ready taken these defense courses,
and it is expected that this number
will run to 11,000 before the end of
the year.
One course, "Engineering Drafting
and Technical Calculations," is be
ing given only for women. Com
panies hiring the women engineers
trained during the Summer Quarter
were well pleased with the results.
The women proved more careful
with detail work and more patient
than men. This course will be re
peated beginning October 5. Forty
women engineers will be taught in
San Francisco, and 40 on the cam
pus.
One of the most popular defense
courses during the Summer Quar
ter was the one on "Personnel Man
agement."
Stanford has one of the best elec
trical laboratories in the country,
so it is fully prepared to give highly
technical military training. Twenty
picked Signal Corps men are sent
by the Army once a month to take
a high-frequency technical course.
This 48-hours-a-week course makes
use of the Stanford klystron and
double klystron.
HIGH SCHOOL GRADS
The courses are given for high
school graduates who are interested
in working in war industries, under
the direction of the United States
Office of Education. Women who
want to take up drafting should
have at least two years of math.
Professor Grant is in charge of the
program at Stanford.
Faculty members state that fall
students enrolled in defense courses
are taking their work more seriously.
They feel that this is another ex
ample of the present trend to adapt
oneself to war conditions.
