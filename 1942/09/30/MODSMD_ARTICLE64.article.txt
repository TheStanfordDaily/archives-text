WASHINGTON, Sept. 29 (UP).—
The Senate farm bloc won tentative
adoption of its controversial farm
price amendment to the anti-infla
tion bill tonight and then tempora
rily blocked a vote on a compromise
substitute by springing a parlia
mentary trap on Administration
forces to send the chamber into re
cess until tomorrow.
The move came when Democratic
leader Alben W. Barkley offered the
compromise substitute, designed to
nullify the farm bloc victory, and
sought an immediate vote.
The farm forces not only blocked
the vote but offered an amendment
which had the effect of requiring a
vote on their amendment ahead of
Barkley's.
Barkley, recognizing that Admin
istration forces had been placed in
an unenviable position, agreed to a
recess until 11 a.m. tomorrow.
The new amendment—introduced
by Senator Carl Hatch, D., N.M.—
would guarantee the farmer a return
covering the cost of production of
agricultural commodities. It is es
sentially the same proposal advanced
by the farm bloc yesterday and re
jected by Administration leaders.
Hatch is co-author with Senator
Elmer Thomas, D., Okla., of the con
troversial amendment adopted.
DENVER, Sept. 29 (UP). —The
power unit and three baggage
coaches of the City of Denver, crack
streamlined train of the Union Pa
cific Lines runing between Denver
and Omaha, caught fire tonight l'/ 2
miles east of Snyder, Colo., but re
sumed its journey after a delay of
one hour.
