### 
"Part-time jobs of every descrip
tion are now available to Stanford
students who desire part-time work,"
Miss Adelaide Palmer, Executive
Assistant of the Appointment Serv
ice, announced yesterday.
Jobs handled through the Appoint
ment Service are usually in Palo
Alto, Menlo Park, and the surround
ing territory, and often are those
offering board and room, Miss Pal
mer said. Other work, including
that of gardening on and off campus
which was formerly done by Japa
nese labor, is being offered.
Students interested in filing appli
cations for employment may acquire
them at the Appointment Service in
the Administration Building. All
hauling jobs on campus are under
the direction of Miss Christine
Ricker in the Union.
Applications may still be made for
NYA money in various departments,
although there is a reduced pro
gram, Miss Palmer added.
