NO SPECIAL TRAINS

As all available locomotives and cars are needed
for military and other essential traffic, we cannot
operate special trains to San Francisco for the
football games at Kczar Stadium this season,
or expand regular trains. We regret that war
time transportation requirements make it im
possible to provide special service to sports
events as we have done in the past.
