# Campus Civilian Defense Termed 'Paper Scheme', Weak Under Pressure
## Organizations Are Not Workable Masters Declares; Practical Class Possibility for Training Manpower

That tbe Stanford Civilian Defense organization is merely a plan on
paper and not a workable scheme under pressure was revealed by Mr.
Alfred Masters, head of the campus Civilian Defense organization, at a
meeting of the Stanford Civilian Defense Council yesterday.
"We have an organization I don't believe will function," Masters said.
"We have an organization on paper,

but that is about all. Fire and po
lice protection and transportation
won't work the way things are
now."
The reservoir of manpower for
defense positions on the campus
will come from the R.O.T.C. classes,
according to Colonel Harry B. Allen,
but that supply of manpower will
not start training until next week.
"That means that we won't have
these men ready for another two
weeks," Masters added. "We need a
speeding up of personnel."
The Council conceded that the
available manpower is adequate,
but that the University is faced with
the problem of training these men,
most of them new to work of this
sort.
The University offers a course in
Civilian Defense this quarter, but,
said Dean of Men John Bunn, "We
need a practical course which will
fit the men to do a specific job.
The Civilian Defense course is a
good academic course."
It was tentatively decided that
one R.O.T.C. battery will be given
training in fire fighting.
On the brighter side was the dis
closure that the organization of
wardens in University residences is
coming about slowly but definitely.
According to Professor John Dodds,
the air raid warden situation is in
pretty good shape. With the addi
tion of the new air raid shelter in
the Education Building, it was
agreed that that situation is well
taken care of.
