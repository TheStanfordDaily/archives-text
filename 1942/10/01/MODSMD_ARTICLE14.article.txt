# Stanford Farmhands Pick Fruit for Food Arsenal
## 
### 
First regular contingent of Stan
ford farm labor bolstered America's
food arsenal with 2'/a tons of prunes
and 150 boxes of tomatoes Tuesday.
Following Monday's scouting tour
by nine Roble sponsors, 37 lower di
vision women and three Encina men
answered the call and split into two
parties—one picked tomatoes at the
Mountain View Berry Farm, another
gathered prunes near San Jose.
They brought back the same story
related by Barbara Sadler, Roble
president, yesterday — a story of
grateful farmers, stiff backs and a
good time. They serenaded Santa
Clara, and got scowls; they picked
fruit, and got paid; and by giving
farmers a hand they have started a
vitally important movement which
holds promise of alleviating the
critical farm labor shortage.
ROBLEITES lIAPPY
As Lu French, Roble, put it, she
left for the prune ranch with appre
hension, but returned with enthusi
asm for the work, eager to go again.
Anna Lundstrom, who worked in the
tomato fields, commented that she
experienced the same feeling as if
she bought a war bond and even felt
guilty for accepting pay for her
work.
To them it was a serious game.
They took it as it were a Big Game,
scrambled to fill the most lugs. Miss
Rosemary Clark, Roble Director,
brought them watermelon at half
time.
Miss Clark emphasized that these
short trips serve mainly to season
the workers for longer stretches dur
ing vacations. Farmers have sug
gested that camps be provided for
vacationing students, both men and
women.
PROGRAM FORMS
Organization is now in progress
in formulating regular week-end
farm help. As yet, only Roble has
worked out a functioning program.
John Mitchell, representing Encina,
will join the Roble committee in a
meeting tonight, in an effort to re
cruit volunteers for farm work be
ginning this week-end.
Jim Kessler, Stanford War Board,
represents the student government
on the conference and there are in
dications that the SWB may assume
reins of the labor corps as it gains
in scope.
