# Dean Speaks at Toyon Smoker
## 
### 
Pointing out that Stanford has al
ways done much to promote "the
junior transfer idea," Dean John
Bunn assured 108 transfer men as
sembled at a smoker in Toyon
Lobby last night that they were
"just as welcome as those who began
as freshmen or sophomores."
The smoker, a regular feature of
Stanford's orientation program, was
intended to acquaint new men with
(he extracurricular activities they
might enter, and featured a talk by
Assistant Football Coach Vic Lind
skog who discussed participation in
sports.
Dean Bunn said it was hard to
advise a student how much work
he should take, but he noted that
because of the war time has become
more precious. In a given school
year, then, each student should en
deavor to do more work than he
would normally undertake. That
amount, however, should not be the
maximum amount of work a student
can do, but "his optimum amountâ€”
that quantity he can do best."
Coach Lindskog asked the new
students for their "unanimous sup
port" in the football games that re
mained on the Indians' schedule. He
anticipated a "rough, tough" game
with Santa Clara Saturday, and
wanted a large following on hand
to cheer the team on.
Other speakers included Dr.
Stanley Sharp, who spoke on the
honor code; Frank Bauman, on fo
rensics; Don Aillen, on the Chapar
ral.
