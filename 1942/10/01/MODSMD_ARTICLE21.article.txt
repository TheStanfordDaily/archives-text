### 
MOSCOW, OCT. 1 (U.R).—German
shock troops, bolstered by a fresh
tank division, have edged ahead in
the northwest Stalingrad industrial
area, but the Russians have struck
two stunning blows down in the
Caucasus, slaughtering 8.000 Ru
manians along the Black Sea coast
and 1,500 Germans near Mozdok, the
high command revealed today.
Four German divisions, two in
fantry and two armored, are now
penetrating the northwestern fringe
of the city. Although they made
slight progress Wednesday for the
first time in three days, the Nazis
guarding the remote left flank of the
German line surrendered another
hill to a Russian army driving down
from the Don River Valley to Stal
ingrad's relief.
On all sectors of the 40-mile battle
arc around the city except in the
northwest outskirts, the Russians
held their ground as the 38th day of
siege began.
Front dispatches from the Cau
casus said the Russians were grad
ually gaining the initiative and that

winter was closing in fast, bringing
the snow-line down into the foot
hills of Europe's tallest mountains
there.
Farther northwest a Russian army
driving down from the Don Valley to
Stalingrad's relief was still gaining
ground. It captured another height
in an all-day battle Wednesday, the
communique said.
Meanwhile Stocholm reports as
serted that Hitler, confronted by
failure of his armies to break Rus
sian resistance at key points on Uio
eastern front, has shifted command
ers before Stalingrad and Leningrad.
Field Marshal Fedor von Bock
was said to have been succeeded by
Col. Gen. Hermann Hoth, former
armored division commander. The
German-dominated Vichy radio said
Hoth was given the post of chief of
operations.
Field Marshal Georg von Kuechler
has taken over the northern German
army, replacing Field Marshal Wil •
helm Ritter von Leeb, who failed
to take Leningrad after more than
a year's siege, Stockholm said.
