BERLIN, SEPT. 30 — (German
Broadcast recorded by UP in New
York). —Adolf Hitler promised the
German people tonight that Stalin
grad will fall and outlined a three
point program for winning the bulk
of Russia's natural resources and
converting them to the uses of the
Reich.
Addressing the National Socialist
Party in a mass meeting at the
Sportspalast, Hitler said Germany's
three main goals for 1942 wore:
1. Securing the German position in
the Black Sea region through set
tlement of the Crimea.
2. The break-through to thr? Don,
the focal operation of the offensive
in South Russia on which the Ger-

man army concentrated during the
summer.
3. The seizure of Russia's "last
great wheat regions, the last of the
coal that can be made into coke,
and Soviet oil."
Hitler derided the prospects of a
second front on the continent, but
by inference acknowledged that his
strategists were preparing for any
that might be opened.
Hitler said his schedule for this
year called first for holding what had
been gained, holding "with iron pow
er and waiting to see who gets tired
first," and secondly to attack under
all circumstances where necessary.
"Tine organization of this gigantic
territory we have occupied is among
the tasks ahead," Hitler said.
