# College Men's Training In Air Corps Praised
## 
### United Press 
The men who go into the sky in Army Air Corps ships are the finished
product of a training machine which in less than a year has performed
a miracle of human transition, molding happy-go-lucky American col
legians into fighter pilots, bombardiers, and navigators.
Responsible for the birth of this huge trained reserve which feeds one

of the most potent forces in the'
American war effort is the U.S. Air
Forces Fiying Training Command,
headed by a former West Pointer
and veteran airman, Major General
Barton K. Yount.
To Yount and his associates come
thousands of young men to be
trained in handling flying ships
worth thousands of dollars, capable
of tons of destruction. They must
master the technique of explosives,
aircraft mechanism, navigation, am l
gunnery.
SCHOOL PROCEDURE
Once enlisted, the candidate hur
dles preliminary physical, mental,
and psychological tests; then comes
classification as bombardier, navi
gator, or pilot. Each class trains as
a separate force. Later all three are
combined in an operational training
program, teaching teamwork in
handling the diverse jobs of a war
time raid.
On raids they learn that the base
objective flight is controlled by the
pilot. The bombardier's turn comes
over the target. And navigation gets
you there and gets you home.
"No other country in the world
has the men that we have," Major
Genei'al Yount said in appraising
these male products of his machine.
PICK OF CROP
"We are operating the world's big
gest school for airmen and it is
growing all the time. We get the
pick of the crop and are keeping at
all times a comfortable reserve of
candidates. Our rate of training
keeps pace with demand for per
sonnel. We don't know what will
happen in the future, but we will
be ready with facilities, machines,
and trained manpower."
In analyzing the program recently,
Yount and his assistants, Major Gen
eral Ralph Royce, hero of the April
bombing of the Philippines, and
Brigadier General M. F. "Mike"
Scanlon, former air force head in
New Guinea, stated three things
about the boys who have come out
of colleges to air war training cen
ters:
1. They are the best trained pilots
in the world.
2. Their training program is keep
ing them well abreast of the de
mand of the actual fighting forces
for their services.
3. Their school is the biggest in
the world, is growing, and will keep
growing until the day comes when
their kind can go back to the cam
pus to study in a world at peace.

SCHOOL PROCEDURE
Once enlisted, the candidate hur
dles preliminary physical, mental,
and psychological tests; then comes
classification as bombardier, navi
gator, or pilot. Each class trains as
a separate force. Later all three are
combined in an operational training
program, teaching teamwork in
handling the diverse jobs of a war
time raid.
On raids they learn that the base
objective flight is controlled by the
pilot. The bombardier's turn comes
over the target. And navigation gets
you there and gets you home.
"No other country in the world
has the men that we have," Major
Genei'al Yount said in appraising
these male products of his machine.
PICK OF CROP
"We are operating the world's big
gest school for airmen and it is
growing all the time. We get the
pick of the crop and are keeping at
all times a comfortable reserve of
candidates. Our rate of training
keeps pace with demand for per
sonnel. We don't know what will
happen in the future, but we will
be ready with facilities, machines,
and trained manpower."
In analyzing the program recently,
Yount and his assistants, Major Gen
eral Ralph Royce, hero of the April
bombing of the Philippines, and
Brigadier General M. F. "Mike"
Scanlon, former air force head in
New Guinea, stated three things
about the boys who have come out
of colleges to air war training cen
ters:
1. They are the best trained pilots
in the world.
2. Their training program is keep
ing them well abreast of the de
mand of the actual fighting forces
for their services.
3. Their school is the biggest in
the world, is growing, and will keep
growing until the day comes when
their kind can go back to the cam
pus to study in a world at peace.
The men who go into the sky in Army Air Corps ships are the finished
product of a training machine which in less than a year has performed
a miracle of human transition, molding happy-go-lucky American col
legians into fighter pilots, bombardiers, and navigators.
Responsible for the birth of this huge trained reserve which feeds one

of the most potent forces in the'
American war effort is the U.S. Air
Forces Fiying Training Command,
headed by a former West Pointer
and veteran airman, Major General
Barton K. Yount.
To Yount and his associates come
thousands of young men to be
trained in handling flying ships
worth thousands of dollars, capable
of tons of destruction. They must
master the technique of explosives,
aircraft mechanism, navigation, am l
gunnery.
