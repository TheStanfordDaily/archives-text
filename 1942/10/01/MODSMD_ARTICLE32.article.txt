OMON ISLANDS SEPT. 14—(de
layed) (U.R)—America's first aerial
ace in the Solomons campaign—
Capt. Marion E. Carl, a Marine pilot
from Hubbard, Ore.—returned safe
ly to headquarters today after being
missing for five days.
He was shot down by Japanese
fighter planes while attacking a for
mation of enemy fighters and wns
rescued from the sea, "more dead
than alive," by friendly natives.
The tall. 26-year-old Oregon State
graduate suffered minor burns on
his wrists but will fly within a week.
BAGS BOMBERS
Before he was shot down Carl
bagged two more bombers, bringing
his total to 11 planes destroyed dur
ing the operations on Guadalcanal
Island. He took off from Henderson
Field shortly before noon on Sept. 9,
leading his squadron.
"We wex-e up 20 minutes flying
over the southeastern coast of
Guadalcanal when we ran head on
into a formation of 26 twin-engine
Mitsuibishi bombers headed for our
installations," he said. "Our forma
tion made two overhead runs on the
bombers and I got one on each run.
PLANE BURNS
"The first exploded and burned as
soon as I hit him and the second
spun down smoking. I was trying to
decide whether to follow him down
when the Jap fighters hit me from
behind. Bullets began fiying all over
the place. The coekpit filled up with
smoke, blinding me. I never did get
a look at what was on my tail before
bailing out.
"The parachute opened at 15,000
feet and I floated down off near
island, a few miles off the Guadal
canal coast about 30 miles from
home.
I w;is dunked into the ocean 400
! yards off the island and started to
swim toward shore. I got within
hailing distance of the beach easily
but the current prevented me from
landing.
"I was just about to give up when
a native boy paddled out in a canoe,
grabbed me and hauled me aboard
more dead than alive."
