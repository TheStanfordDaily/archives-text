### ZIP WALT 
BERKELEY TENNIS CLUB,
Sept. 30.â€”Emery Neale, Stanford's
ace net star, had little trouble in
holding o(V the belated drive of
Nick Carter of San Francisco in
a men's singles quarterfinal match
today in the Pacific Coast Tennis
Championships. Ted Myers, cap
tain of the frosh team last year,
was eliminated in the junior di
vision in a hard fought match
from his old rival, Harry Likas,
now attending the University of
San Francisco.
Neale disposed of Carter, who
was sorely out of condition, in best
two out of three sets, winning 6-3,
4-G, 7-5. Likas won in straight sets,
6-3, 6-3.
These were the only Stanford men
to play today.
NEALE PRECISE
Carter, conqueror of Neale in a
recent Portland tournament, played
in his usual style of ground strokes
from (he base line, never using
forcing shots or rushing the net.
Neale was slow in coming to the net,
but when he did, he usually put the
ball away with a neat placement.
In the second set, Carter pulled
away quickly at the start, gaining
most of his points on Neale's er
rors. The Stanford star consistently
bit ihe net, and blew several easy
shots. Carter, a product of the
Golden Gate Park courts, won three
games before Neale could find him
self.
Neale had the tiring Carter on
the run in the last set. He errored
frequently and coupled with occa
sional bursts by Carter from the
baseline, the set went into an extra
game. Neale's overhead slams were
hard and accurate, missing but once.
MYERS SLOW
Myers got off to a slow start, but
once he got the feel of things, often
caught Likas flatfooted. Likas is
seeded No. 1 in the tournament.
Myers won his point whenever he
had an opportunity to come to the
net.
Likas, however, took advantage
of Myers' misplacements, and played
steady tennis throughout save for
a short slump in each set.
