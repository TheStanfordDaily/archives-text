# Ruffing Buckles, But Yankees Win Opener
## Champions Triumph, 7-4; Moore Wrecks No-Hitter 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Big "Red" linHing gained the threshold of baseball immortality yes
terday, hut his heart was Itroken in the eighth inning hy Terry Moore's
line single as the Yankees outslugged the Cardinals, 7-4, to win the lirst
game ol the World Series at Sportsman's Park in St. Louis.
For seven and two-thirds innings, the veteran Yankee pitched the great-

est masterpiece in World Series his
tory. holding the Curds hitless while
his team-mates got to Mort Cooper
for five runs.
Then, alter two were out in the
eighth, Moore slashed his single into
right field and the spell was broken.
Ruffing eased up and the Cards
staged a typical ninth inning rally.
They drove the 37-year old Ruffing
to the showers after two were out in
the ninth with a four-run outburst.
Lanky "Spud" Chandler strolled in
from the Yankee bull-pen and finally
quelled the rally by forcing Stan
Musial to tap to Hassett with the
bags loaded.
BROKE ALMOST EVERY RECORD
The aged Ruffing lusted long
enough to break almost every im
portant World Series pitching rec
ord. He bested the former mark for
pitching perfection established by
Yankee Herb Pennock in the. 1927
Series when he hurled hitless ball
against the Pittsburgh Pirates for
seven and one-third innings. And
Red became the only pitcher ever to
win eight world Series games.
Aside from Ruffing's dramatic
pitching performance, the game was
the story of a Cardinal rally that
came too late. Until the ninth the
Yankees were master of the situa
tion at all times. They hit Cooper
consistently and capitalized on four
Card errors to pile up a commanding
seven-run lead going into the ninth.
The Yanks broke the scoring ice
in the fourth when Joe DiMaggio
shot a sharp single into left field,
and went to second as Bill Dickey
walked. Buddy Hassett sliced a
double inside the left field foul line,
and DiMaggio scored with the first
run of the game.
YANKS PILE IT UP
The World Champions got another
in the fifth on Rolfe's single, Cullen
bine's double, and DiMaggio's infield
grounder. An error by "Country"
Slaughter of the Cards on Ruffing's
fly ball and three solid base hits gave
the Yanks three more runs in the
eighth.
Another sloppy fielding demonstra
tion by the Cards, who cracked de
fensively under pressure, contrib
uted two more runs to the Yankee
total in the ninth.
The Card fans finally got something
to cheer about as National League
champions got to Ruffing in the
ninth. After Musial went out, Walk
er Cooper singled off Rolfe's glove,
but Hopp fiied to left. Then the fire
works broke. Sanders walked, and
Marty Marion drove both Cooper
and Sanders home with a searing
triple to right. Ken O'Dea drove
Marion in with a single ,and after
Brown singled. Ruffing left the game.
MUSIAL UP WITH BAGS LOADED
Terry Moore met Chandler with
a single, scoring Crespi, who ran for
O'Dea. Slaughter's infield single
loaded the bases and brought up
Stan Musial with the bags loaded. A
grand slam homer would have won
for the Cards, 8-7, but Chandler,
pitching carefully, forced Musial to
ground out.
Manager Billy Southworth of the
Cards said he would pitch Rookie
Johnny Beazly, a 21-game winner,
in the second game today. Beazley
will be opposed by Ernie "Tiny"
Bonham of the Yanks, who won 22
games during the league season.

The Yanks broke the scoring ice

Terry Moore met Chandler with

O'Dea. Slaughter's infield single

to the showers after two were out in
the ninth with a four-run outburst.
Lanky "Spud" Chandler strolled in
from the Yankee bull-pen and finally
quelled the rally by forcing Stan
Musial to tap to Hassett with the
bags loaded.
BROKE ALMOST EVERY RECORD
The aged Ruffing lusted long
enough to break almost every im
portant World Series pitching rec
ord. He bested the former mark for
pitching perfection established by
Yankee Herb Pennock in the. 1927
Series when he hurled hitless ball
against the Pittsburgh Pirates for
seven and one-third innings. And
Red became the only pitcher ever to
win eight world Series games.
Aside from Ruffing's dramatic
pitching performance, the game was
the story of a Cardinal rally that
came too late. Until the ninth the
Yankees were master of the situa
tion at all times. They hit Cooper
consistently and capitalized on four
Card errors to pile up a commanding
seven-run lead going into the ninth.
The Yanks broke the scoring ice
in the fourth when Joe DiMaggio
shot a sharp single into left field,
and went to second as Bill Dickey
walked. Buddy Hassett sliced a
double inside the left field foul line,
and DiMaggio scored with the first
run of the game.
YANKS PILE IT UP
The World Champions got another
in the fifth on Rolfe's single, Cullen
bine's double, and DiMaggio's infield
grounder. An error by "Country"
Slaughter of the Cards on Ruffing's
fly ball and three solid base hits gave
the Yanks three more runs in the
eighth.
Another sloppy fielding demonstra
tion by the Cards, who cracked de
fensively under pressure, contrib
uted two more runs to the Yankee
total in the ninth.
The Card fans finally got something
to cheer about as National League
champions got to Ruffing in the
ninth. After Musial went out, Walk
er Cooper singled off Rolfe's glove,
but Hopp fiied to left. Then the fire
works broke. Sanders walked, and
Marty Marion drove both Cooper
and Sanders home with a searing
triple to right. Ken O'Dea drove
Marion in with a single ,and after
Brown singled. Ruffing left the game.
MUSIAL UP WITH BAGS LOADED
Terry Moore met Chandler with
a single, scoring Crespi, who ran for
O'Dea. Slaughter's infield single
loaded the bases and brought up
Stan Musial with the bags loaded. A
grand slam homer would have won
for the Cards, 8-7, but Chandler,
pitching carefully, forced Musial to
ground out.
Manager Billy Southworth of the
Cards said he would pitch Rookie
Johnny Beazly, a 21-game winner,
in the second game today. Beazley
will be opposed by Ernie "Tiny"
Bonham of the Yanks, who won 22
games during the league season.
