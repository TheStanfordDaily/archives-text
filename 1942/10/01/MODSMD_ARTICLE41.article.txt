The U.S. Naval Pre-Flight School of St. Mary's will meet Stanford's
soccer team in the first official game of the 1!)42 season Oct. 17.
The original opener with the University of San Francisco scheduled for
Oct. 10, was called off by Coach Harry Maloney, because he doesn't feel
that the team can prepare itself for intercollegiate competition in so short
a time. 4.

Practice games have been ar- j
ranged with a team of British sai
lors. It is possible that a game can
be arranged for Oct. 10 in place of
the U.S.F. contest.
Coach Maloney attnaed the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Soccer Confer
ence at San Mateo, Monday night,
and made arrangements for a ten

California. Other frosh games will
be arranged with junior colleges and
high schools in the vicinity.
