# To a Rude Awakening

IF the rest of the nation is as poorly prepared
and as narrow-minded as Stanford was yes
terday, the Jap bombers can swoop in over
San Francisco Bay and lay this entire peninsula
to waste.
But we don't think that the rest of the nation
could possibly be as poorly prepared. First
of all, the Stanford Civilian Defense Council
cannot get organized quickly enough to give
a mock air raid drill for the California State
Council of Defense. That's fine. We could be
bombed in 10 minutes, and what would hap
pen? There would be so much confusion that
the campus could be burned to the ground
while the messengers, wardens, etc., were still
running around trying to straighten out orders.
Second, Excom very nearly passed on a
rally last night for the Santa Clara game, but
it was defeated mainly for the reason that a
good rally could not be prepared. Let it not be
misunderstood that we are against rallies and
football games. They were fine for 1941 and
years before, but we must change our entire
train of thought and direct it toward winning
this war and winning it as soon as possible.
If we keep thinking about going to rallies,
football games, and dances, we are letting our
minds drift farther and farther away from the
question at hand. WE'VE GOT TO WIN THIS
WAR.
What should we substitute for rallies, dances,
and football games? We should have our
schedules so well budgeted as to hours that
we can all spend a little time each day learn
ning what to do in case of an attack on the
campus, rolling bandages for the Red Cross,
picking fruit for nearby farmers, and doing
other things that will definitely add to the cause
of Victory.
It shouldn't take a lot of flag waving and
stirring music to convince us that we are doing
very little. It will take more than words to
convince many of our friends that their way
of living will have to change. Until that day
comes when we are all in accord, this nation
may crumble and be taken over by a mob of
gangsters from overseas.â€”J. H.
