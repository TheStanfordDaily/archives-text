# New Face; Same Stuff

LAST night Excom approved the appoint
ment of Rosemarie Cross to succeed Bob
Collins as the Co-ordinator of the Stanford War
Board. All of us know the job that Bob Collins
undertook, and all of us know the job that he
has turned in. We have known Collins as the
idea man behind the War Board, the person
who did not want publicity but wanted the job
done.
Now that he has left Stanford to try to enlist
in the army, there is no reason to despair or
to yearn for "the good old days" when Collins
was at the helm. The Stanford War Board was
created on March 3, and on March 4 Rosemarie
Cross looked up Bob Collins to let him know
that she was interested in the problem that he
was tackling and that she would gladly give
her support.
In this respect she was one of many who
thought that another committee had been
formed and here was a chance to get in on the
ground floor. However, she had ideas and en
ergy and was uninterested in the publicity and
fame that she could garner for herself.
Last spring she worked in the public rela
tions side of the War Board, and in this capacity
she was instrumental in founding the War
Speakers' Bureau, which makes announce
ments to the different living and eating groups
on the campus, to the Mothers' Club, and to
local groups in Palo Alto.
Rosemarie Cross was the force behind the
War and Peace discussion groups which are
now held on the campus. These groups are
devoting most of their energies to the post-war
problem and are considering it in the light of
economic, racial, and political angles.
She was not here during Summer Quarter,
but worked in the central office of the USO in
Los Angeles, where she received a great deal
of experience in war work in general and more
particularly in the field of entertainment. From
her work with the USO, she has instigated the
family type of entertainment for the soldiers
stationed near the campus. Under this system
the soldiers will be asked to private homes in
small groups, and in this way some of the home
life that is so absent from their life will be
supplied.
The War Board has been cut down in size
in an effort to streamline it and to do only those
jobs that are essential. Although many of the
less important committees have been removed,

there is still room for those who are sincerely
interested in the work.
Although there will be a new face at the
War Co-ordinator's desk, the same high quality
work and the same fresh and energetic ideas
will come forth as in the past.-- A1 Hampson
