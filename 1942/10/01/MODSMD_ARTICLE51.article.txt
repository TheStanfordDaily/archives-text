YESTERDAY, the situation was serious. To show
just how serious, let me quote from Charlie Allen's
editorial in yesterday's Daily.
"The United States is facing the most serious threat
to its parliamentary government in recent history. A
selfish pressure group, the farm bloc, is effectively
blocking enactment of the urgently needed cost of liv
ing bill The President's deadline for Congres
sional action on the bill expires today. Any effective
action by Congress is very unliely. Hence the Presi
dent must act And when Mr. Roosevelt acts,
Congress ceases to perform its role in our democracy."
The situation referred to was this: An anti-inflation
measure, to stabilize all prices and wages was neces
sary. The farm bloc in Congress, fighting for higher
farm prices, prevented such action by Congress. Presi
dent Roosevelt then ordered Congress to enact such
legislation by the first of October, today, in default
of which he threatened to establish the measures he
deemed necessary by executive decree, issued under
his general emergency powers, and, in so far as farm
prices were concerned, was expected to over-ride an
act of Congress.
r J I HE effect of such executive action would have been,
in the long view, catastrophic. However necessary
it might be to win the war that prices and wages gen
erally be stabilized, it would have been the longest
single stride toward dictatorship that the United States
has ever taken. This is the reasoning: Such a move
is justified because this is an emergency; if, in the
future, we have another emergency, executive legis
lation, following this precedent would be again justi
fied; a few more such emergency decree-laws might
be issued; and soon Congress could be sent home as
nothing but a nuisance. Such reasoning is not only
logical, but, considering the stresses and strains pre
dicted on every hand for the post-war period, we could
expect emergencies, real or fabricated for the purpose,
to burgeon on every hand. And there is good histori
cal precedent, ancient and modern, for the conversion
of emergency dictatorship into permanent tyranny.
In discussing the possible effects of the failure of
Congress to act, I used the past tense. And I was over
joyed to be able to put my suppositions in the past
tense, because Congress has acted. Whether from the
highest motives of patriotism or the less exalted of
practical politics, and probably from both, the farm
bloc gave way, a compromise measure was put through
the Senate, and the measure sent to the House. The
conscript fathers probably heaved a sigh of relief, and
the rest of the country should have, too.

in the long view, catastrophic. However necessary
it might be to win the war that prices and wages gen
erally be stabilized, it would have been the longest
single stride toward dictatorship that the United States
has ever taken. This is the reasoning: Such a move
is justified because this is an emergency; if, in the
future, we have another emergency, executive legis
lation, following this precedent would be again justi
fied; a few more such emergency decree-laws might
be issued; and soon Congress could be sent home as
nothing but a nuisance. Such reasoning is not only
logical, but, considering the stresses and strains pre
dicted on every hand for the post-war period, we could
expect emergencies, real or fabricated for the purpose,
to burgeon on every hand. And there is good histori
cal precedent, ancient and modern, for the conversion
of emergency dictatorship into permanent tyranny.
In discussing the possible effects of the failure of
Congress to act, I used the past tense. And I was over
joyed to be able to put my suppositions in the past
tense, because Congress has acted. Whether from the
highest motives of patriotism or the less exalted of
practical politics, and probably from both, the farm
bloc gave way, a compromise measure was put through
the Senate, and the measure sent to the House. The
conscript fathers probably heaved a sigh of relief, and
the rest of the country should have, too.

LAST-MINUTE REPRIEVE
YESTERDAY, the situation was serious. To show
just how serious, let me quote from Charlie Allen's
editorial in yesterday's Daily.
"The United States is facing the most serious threat
to its parliamentary government in recent history. A
selfish pressure group, the farm bloc, is effectively
blocking enactment of the urgently needed cost of liv
ing bill The President's deadline for Congres
sional action on the bill expires today. Any effective
action by Congress is very unliely. Hence the Presi
dent must act And when Mr. Roosevelt acts,
Congress ceases to perform its role in our democracy."
The situation referred to was this: An anti-inflation
measure, to stabilize all prices and wages was neces
sary. The farm bloc in Congress, fighting for higher
farm prices, prevented such action by Congress. Presi
dent Roosevelt then ordered Congress to enact such
legislation by the first of October, today, in default
of which he threatened to establish the measures he
deemed necessary by executive decree, issued under
his general emergency powers, and, in so far as farm
prices were concerned, was expected to over-ride an
act of Congress.
r J I HE effect of such executive action would have been,
in the long view, catastrophic. However necessary
it might be to win the war that prices and wages gen
