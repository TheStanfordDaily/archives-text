JF THIS school ever rebuilds its classrooms, I'd like
to suggest that they put seats only in the back of
the rooms because that's the only place most students
will sit anyway.
One might think that professors had halitosis the
way the rear seats fill up and front ones remain empty.
I've never yet heard of a clear cut case of halitosis
against a professor though.
With the war emergency and the tremendous de
crease of civilian man-power it appears as though
these profs we have are going to have to last a long
time before we get any replacements, so why don't
you sit somewhere near the front of the class today.
It'll save wear and tear on the faculty voices. After
all, you wouldn't want to have a dumb professor would
you?
