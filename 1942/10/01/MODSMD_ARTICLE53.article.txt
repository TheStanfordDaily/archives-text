# HOW TO EVADE THE DRAFT

### 
J.JOW many of you didn't buy your Santa Clara and
Washington football tickets yesterday? Wise up.
Who knows a good three-unit course at 9 o'clock?
I feel Dr. Wilbur frowning on my 15-unit course. An
added attraction to the heavy program deal is that it
gives you a cut-rate tuition. Ferinstance, taking a 15-
unit course, it costs you $7.67 per unit. On an 18-unit
program they'll let you off for only $6.39 a unit. It's
a steal, but they're willing to do it for national defense.
If every student takes full advantage of these bar
gain prices the University will lose about $100,000
each quarter.
Pretty soon they'll raise the tuition again.
