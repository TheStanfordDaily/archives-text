# WIN YOURSELF ONE MILLION DOLLARS

r JpHE STANFORD DAILY is giving its readers an
extra special treat this year. In the past Bull Ses
sion has had the highest reader interest of any feature
in the Daily. But that isn't good enough. This quarter
it's going to be twice as good since there will be two
Bull Sessioners who will alternate writing the column,
Bill Steif and H. D. Thoreau.
(Editor's Note.â€”This change has been made because
neither of these boys is competent enough to hold the
position by himself.)
