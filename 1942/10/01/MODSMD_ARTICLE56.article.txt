## COURSE CHANGE ERROR 
### 
THE EDITOR, SIR:
I'm angry, very angry! Yesterday I registered' for
a course listed in the Time Schedule and this morning,
like most people, went to class for the first time. Only,
there wasn't a class. At 10:15 the department secretary
sauntered in and notified us that the course wasn't
being given. Then she added, "Of course you'll have
to file a study change card." She smirked.
I realize that this is war time and that school con
ditions arc upset, but nevertheless, isn't there some
thing that the school could do to inform students in
time so that they could avoid all the administration
red tape that a study change involves?
I understand that all advisors were notified, but
evidently they didn't do their job. Something slipped.
The least the administration could do is try to inform
The Daily and hope that the students would read such
a notice. If such errors could be avoided all concerned
would be saved much time and effort.
