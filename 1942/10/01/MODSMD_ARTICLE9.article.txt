# Bronc Rally Killed, SWB Head Chosen
## Cross Named Board Coordinator; Co-op Liquidation Approved 
### AL HAMPSON 
After first approving a rally for
the Santa Clara game by the vote
of 7-2, Excom reversed itself last
night and decided to abandon the
rally at the recommendation of Rally
Committee Co-Chairman Jim Mc-
Bricr.
Although the request for the rally
had not been approved either by the
Committee on Public Exercises, or
Lhe Office of the Dean of Men, the
rally was passed upon on the con
dition that it be "short and sweet."
However, when Mc√ürier said that
it was better to give no rally rather
than a poorly prepared rally which
might not be a success, the subject
was again voted on and this time
defeated.
Bob Collins gave his final report
on the Stanford War Board before
he left to try to enlist in the army.
Rosemary Cross was appointed as the
Co-ordinator in his stead.
Bill Moran, Student Manager, re
viewed the action that Excom had
taken during the summer on the prob
lem of the Co-op Bookstore, and then
stated that he had gone ahead and
hired Ben Miller to liquidate the
bookstore. He also elaborated on
his plan for the closing of the store.
His plan which calls for the sell
ing of all the books possible in the
next two weeks, the giving back of
all those unsold, and the selling of
the remaining with the money go
ing to the A.S.S.U., was approved.
Bill Moran also reported that the
Reg Dance this quarter was the most
successful one ever held. It amassed
a profit of $201.66.
