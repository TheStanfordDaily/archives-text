"Wc arc (lie ATO's," the Pi
Ph 'f.s sang from their lf>udoir
windows to the fraternity across
the street. Quickly roused by their
song, the ATO's rushed down to

were joined—in voice.
An exchange of about five songs
apiece, each side applauding the
other, ended with the Pi Phi good
night song and the ATO's singing
"(lodnight Ladies."
But no sooner had the ATO's re
turned to their domicile, when
symbolically a sparrow flew in
their window, and a contingent of
ATO's took it over in a boot and
gave the Pi Phi's the bird.
