# Wilbur Pleads For Effective Manpower Use
## 2000 Students Hear Chancellor's Annual Welcoming Address 
### 
Emphasizing that Stanford stu- !
dents must train for a "split-second
technological war," Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur pleaded for the most
effective use of our manpower in his
annual welcoming address to 2000
students in Memorial Hall yester
day.
"We are facing the enemy here,
and you are here for training," Dr.
Wilbur told the students.
He said the universities were go
ing to become practically a branch
of the armed services, and urged
students to get into line now for the
necessary leadership training.
"In the universities we must train
those who will win the war," said
Dr. Wilbur. "This is a technologi
cal war, for 60 out of 100 persons
engaged in it have some technologi
cal job to do."
NOT PICKED TOO SOON
"It takes time to train men for the
technical jobs this war demands,"
continued Dr. Wilbur, expressing the
hope that men training in colleges
would not be picked too soon.
He asserted that unless we get
mastery of our manpower, we have
taken on a job we cannot see through.
He said that the Manpower Com
mission would probably grow to be
come one of the most powerful gov
erning groups in the country, and
that it would probably tell every
body what to do, where to do it,
and when to do it.
"This new kind of war requires a
new kind of man," continued Dr.
Wilbur, and the universities' job is
| to sort out students as rapidly £<s
possible to make them into leaders
—in two years, or three at the most.
REALISTIC APPROACH
Dr. Wilbur pleaded for a realistic
approach to the war. "A lot of flam
boyant bragadoecio can go down be
fore a machine gun," he said. He
pointed out that the war is still go
ing against us, and we must realize
this fact. He cautioned students to
cut down on their exuberances.
"Unless v/e go in 100%, we're go
ing to come out on the short end,"
he warned students.

mastery of our manpower, we have
taken on a job we cannot see through.
He said that the Manpower Com
mission would probably grow to be
come one of the most powerful gov
erning groups in the country, and
that it would probably tell every
body what to do, where to do it,
and when to do it.
"This new kind of war requires a
new kind of man," continued Dr.
Wilbur, and the universities' job is
| to sort out students as rapidly £<s
possible to make them into leaders
—in two years, or three at the most.
REALISTIC APPROACH
Dr. Wilbur pleaded for a realistic
approach to the war. "A lot of flam
boyant bragadoecio can go down be
fore a machine gun," he said. He
pointed out that the war is still go
ing against us, and we must realize
this fact. He cautioned students to
cut down on their exuberances.
"Unless v/e go in 100%, we're go
ing to come out on the short end,"
he warned students.
Emphasizing that Stanford stu- !
dents must train for a "split-second
technological war," Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur pleaded for the most
effective use of our manpower in his
annual welcoming address to 2000
students in Memorial Hall yester
day.
"We are facing the enemy here,
and you are here for training," Dr.
Wilbur told the students.
He said the universities were go
ing to become practically a branch
of the armed services, and urged
students to get into line now for the
necessary leadership training.
"In the universities we must train
those who will win the war," said
Dr. Wilbur. "This is a technologi
cal war, for 60 out of 100 persons
engaged in it have some technologi
cal job to do."
NOT PICKED TOO SOON
"It takes time to train men for the
technical jobs this war demands,"
continued Dr. Wilbur, expressing the
hope that men training in colleges
would not be picked too soon.
He asserted that unless we get
mastery of our manpower, we have
taken on a job we cannot see through.
