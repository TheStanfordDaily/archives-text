# Band Practices For Brone Game
## 
### 
The Stanford Band went through
their second practice session yester
day in anticipation of the Santa
Clara-Indian game in Kczar Stadium
tomorrow.
"We still have plenty of room for
more men in the organization, Band
master Dick Rabbett said. "There
are good brass and reed sections, but
we could use some more percussion
instruments."
Rabbett added that the band is
short in the drum section and any
one that can handle a drum "should
come out and give it a try." He also
emphasized the fact that the band
is strikingly a student-run organiza
tion this year.
"This is an experiment," Rabbett
said. "If we function well this year
the band will continue to run under
the same kind of organization. Be
fore, we had a faculty bandmaster,
but this year the success of the band
will depend upon the help of the
students themselves. We can have
the best band on the coast, but not
unless the students co-operate in
backing the band," he added.
Band Manager Ed Carpenter,
asked students planning to play in
the band tomorrow to report to him
sometime this afternoon or tomorrow
afternoon to get a uniform.
