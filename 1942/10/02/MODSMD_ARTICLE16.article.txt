# Ranchers Call For Harvesters
## Campus Volunteers To Help Save Crops 
### 
Stanford's farm labor movement
was given a boost yesterday when
Miss Rosamond Clarke, Roble Di
rector, announced that arrangements
have been made for the first of reg
ular week-end crews composed of
campus volunteers, to pick tomatoes
Saturday and Sunday.
Representatives from Roble, the
Row, Lagunita, the Union, YWCA,
and the Stanford War Board pledged
campus-wide collaboration with the
labor movement. Miss Helen Vincent,
speaking for the California Employ
ment Bureau, emphasized the need
for a sustained, all-year effort.
PICKERS NEEDED
"Urgent pleas," she said, "for men
and women to help in field harvest
and canneries are daily pouring into
my office from short-handed ranch
ers. Already this week several
truck loads of Stanford recruits have
aided local farmers and have found
that the work is not over-taxing."
"The labor demand," further re
ported Miss Vincent, "will grow even
more acute when the walnuts and
beans ripen this month."
Jim Kessler, SWB; Janet McClana
han, YWCA; Chico Barman, Roble;
Elizabeth Chandler, Union; and Bill
Collings, Row, arc posting sign-up
sheets for this weekend's help.
TRANSPORTATION
Farmers will furnish transporta
tion and the YWCA will pack
lunches. Tomato pickers will be paid
approximately 20 cents per lug.
Palo Alto merchants are also fac
ing a labor shortage and have pressed
demands on Miss Vincent's bureau
for Stanford help on weekends. Stu
dents interested in part-time em
ployment are referred to Miss Vin
cent, California Employment Bureau.
