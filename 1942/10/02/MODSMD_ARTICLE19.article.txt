# Franklin D. Roosevelt Returns to Washington From Secret Journey
## Wartime Secrecy Surrounds FDR's Inspection Trip 
### 
WASHINGTON, OCT. 1 (U.RJ.—
President Roosevelt returned from
an 8,754-mile transcontinental war
inspection trip today, convinced after
visiting 24 states that Congress and
the Government in Washington are
trailing far behind the people in war
spirit.
The two-week, coast-to-coast jour
ney also convinced Mr. Roosevelt
that the war production program is
going, on the whole, extremely well,
allowing for what he described as a
normal percentage of lag in a pro
gram purposely made a bit higher
than human ingenuity could carry
out.
His trip was made under condi
tions of extreme wartime secrecy
with no public announcement per
mitted until his return to the White
House. Leaving Washington the
night of Sept. 17, he visited nine of
the Nation's biggest war plants, 529
shipyards, seven naval stations, eight
Army camps, and two Marine train
ing centers.
TRAVELS ON COAST
The trip took him first to Detroit,
then out to the Northwest, down the
Pacific Coast and into the Southwest,
and back to Washington through the
deep South. He talked to factory
workers and production experts, ad
mirals and wounded marines, farm
ers and industrialists, and from this
extensive cross-section of the peo
ple he got the deeply founded im
pression that they are far ahead of
most of their leaders in war spirit.
Mr. Roosevelt also returned be
lieving firmly that the Nation is
ready and willing to make sacrifices
greater than ever dreamed of in
Washington.

So pleased was he with the result:;
of his own on-the-scene reporting
of the Weir effort that lie hoped lie
would be able to make another in
spection trip next spring, touring the
central part of the country and see
ing such things as operations of the
Tennessee Valley Authority.
PEOPLE BACK PLAN
He said as a result of talking with
many working people that he be
lieved they were in wholehearted
accord with the program to stabilize
living costs, and furthermore, thai,
they were jittery about the prospect.,
of further increases in the cost of
living. Thus he indicated determina
tion to see his stabilization program
through.
War preparations on the West
Coast and elaborate precautions
against attack that might come at.
any moment deeply impressed the
President. From Seattle to San
Diego, he saw Army camps and
Naval stations operating on a 24-
hour alert. He saw canopies of
barrage balloons protecting great
cities, familiar landmarks camo
flouged almost beyond recognition.

WASHINGTON, OCT. 1 (U.RJ.—
President Roosevelt returned from
an 8,754-mile transcontinental war
inspection trip today, convinced after
visiting 24 states that Congress and
the Government in Washington are
trailing far behind the people in war
spirit.
The two-week, coast-to-coast jour
ney also convinced Mr. Roosevelt
that the war production program is
going, on the whole, extremely well,
allowing for what he described as a
normal percentage of lag in a pro
gram purposely made a bit higher
than human ingenuity could carry
out.
His trip was made under condi
tions of extreme wartime secrecy
with no public announcement per
mitted until his return to the White
House. Leaving Washington the
night of Sept. 17, he visited nine of
the Nation's biggest war plants, 529
shipyards, seven naval stations, eight
Army camps, and two Marine train
ing centers.
TRAVELS ON COAST
The trip took him first to Detroit,
then out to the Northwest, down the
Pacific Coast and into the Southwest,
and back to Washington through the
deep South. He talked to factory
workers and production experts, ad
mirals and wounded marines, farm
ers and industrialists, and from this
extensive cross-section of the peo
ple he got the deeply founded im
pression that they are far ahead of
most of their leaders in war spirit.
Mr. Roosevelt also returned be
lieving firmly that the Nation is
ready and willing to make sacrifices
greater than ever dreamed of in
Washington.

So pleased was he with the result:;
of his own on-the-scene reporting
