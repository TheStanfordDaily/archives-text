# Santa Clara 10-8 Over Stanford Tomorrow
## Cards Can Upset If First Game Greenness Fades 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Stanford's Indians went through an
intensive two-hour light scrimmagc
against Santa Clara formations in
preparation for their game with the
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco tomorrow.
No heavy body contact woi-k was
held, and the entire squad was in
mood shape for the Santa Clara game.
Milt Vucinich, center, was desig
nated as game captain earlier this
week.
The Indians will go into the Santa
Clara game as decided underdogs on
the basis of last week's games. Stan
ford looked very impotent in losing
to Washington State. 6-0, while Santa
Clara exhibited lots of power in
beating Utah, 12-0. Santa Clara is
favored, 10-8.
FREITAS DANGEROUS
Jesse Freitas, famed Bronco passer,
had a field day against Utah and is
expected to take to the air against
Stanford if the sturdy Indian line
dents the Santa Clara running at
tack. Since the Stanford pass defense
looked woefully weak against Wash
ington State, Coach Buck Shaw of the
Broncos may elect to strike through
lite air early in the game. However,
the Indians have been drilling all
week on pass defense, particularly
against Santa Clara formations, and
should be ready for an air attack.
The big question mark to be settled
tomorrow afternoon is whether Stan
ford is the impotent team it appeared
to be against Washington State.
Against the Cougars, the Indians
gained only 59 yards all afternoon,
and all phases of the famed "T" for
mation attack wilted.
IMPROVE HACK FIELD TIMING
Coach Marchie Schwartz has been
drilling the Indians all week in an
effort to improve the intricate back
field timing required of the "T" for
mation. But most observers have
agreed that a lot of the Indians' poor
offense was due to nervousness on
the part of the Stanford backs who
haven't had much actual game expe
rience.
Fans expect Ray Hammett to settle
