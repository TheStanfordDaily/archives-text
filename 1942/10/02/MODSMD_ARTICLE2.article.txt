# Santa Clara 10-8 Over Stanford Tomorrow
## Cards Can Upset If First Game Greenness Fades 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Stanford's Indians went through an
intensive two-hour light scrimmagc
against Santa Clara formations in
preparation for their game with the
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco tomorrow.
No heavy body contact woi-k was
held, and the entire squad was in
mood shape for the Santa Clara game.
Milt Vucinich, center, was desig
nated as game captain earlier this
week.
The Indians will go into the Santa
Clara game as decided underdogs on
the basis of last week's games. Stan
ford looked very impotent in losing
to Washington State. 6-0, while Santa
Clara exhibited lots of power in
beating Utah, 12-0. Santa Clara is
favored, 10-8.
FREITAS DANGEROUS
Jesse Freitas, famed Bronco passer,
had a field day against Utah and is
expected to take to the air against
Stanford if the sturdy Indian line
dents the Santa Clara running at
tack. Since the Stanford pass defense
looked woefully weak against Wash
ington State, Coach Buck Shaw of the
Broncos may elect to strike through
lite air early in the game. However,
the Indians have been drilling all
week on pass defense, particularly
against Santa Clara formations, and
should be ready for an air attack.
The big question mark to be settled
tomorrow afternoon is whether Stan
ford is the impotent team it appeared
to be against Washington State.
Against the Cougars, the Indians
gained only 59 yards all afternoon,
and all phases of the famed "T" for
mation attack wilted.
IMPROVE HACK FIELD TIMING
Coach Marchie Schwartz has been
drilling the Indians all week in an
effort to improve the intricate back
field timing required of the "T" for
mation. But most observers have
agreed that a lot of the Indians' poor
offense was due to nervousness on
the part of the Stanford backs who
haven't had much actual game expe
rience.
Fans expect Ray Hammett to settle
down tomorrow and turn in a good
game at quarterback. Hammett has
been passing particularly long and
accurately in practice, and he may
find holes in the Santa Clara pass
defense for long tosses to speedy
Indian ends and halfbacks.
SANTA C. 10-8 OVER STANFO...
FAWCETT MAY BREAK AWAY
But the Cards' still have their ace,
Buck Fawcett, to worry the Broncos.
Fawcett is probably one of the most
dangerous backs on the coast and he
may break away for long runs to
morrow.
During practice sessions this week,
Coach Schwartz has been concentrat
ing on quick opening plays between
the tackles, trying to break loose
speedy little A1 Hoisch. If the light
scat back ever gets into theo pen,
he's gone for a touchdown, and he
may be Schwartz's hope in the Santa
Clara game.
Although the entire squad is in
good health, Loren LaPrade, varsity
guard, was confined to the rest home
yesterday as a preventive measure.
Hi? is expected to be in ready for
the game tomorrow.
TAYLOR MAY DO IT AGAIN
The rest of the Indian forward wall
Hall, Banducci, Vucinich, Taylor,
Stamm, and Norberg—are ready to
halt the complicated spinners and
reverses which make up the Bx-oncos
ground attack. Chuck Taylor played
most of last year's Stanford-Santa
Clara game in the Bronco's backfield,
and the flashy red-headed guard may
help smother their attack again this
year.
The Stanford end problem was
solved decisively in the Washington
State game by the play of three soph
omores—Dave Brown. Bob Hall, and
Pete August. This trio, with Hank
Norberg and Rog Laverty, give the
Indians plenty of depth and strength
at the ends.
The rest of the line reserves are
strong. The entire line is two deep
and the Broncos should be outplayed
in the forward wall.
BACKFIELD WEAK POINT
But the Stanford backfield is the
weak point. If Don Zappettini and
some of the other halfbacks settle
clown and turn in a good ball game,
Stanford may surprise the Broncos.
Hammett, Fawcett and Bill Sheller
give stability to the backfield and
they may help the sophomores hit
their stride tomorrow.
Sheller's punting against Washing
ton State was outstanding, but he
will have to kick 'em far and long
to rival A1 Santucci, the Bronco's
center, who is noted for being one of
the finest punters on the coast.
No matter how you figure the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, the In
dians are definite underdogs. "If
wo can win this one, it'll sure be an
upset," remarked Coach Marchie
Schwartz after practice the other day.

strong. The entire line is two deep
and the Broncos should be outplayed
in the forward wall.
BACKFIELD WEAK POINT
But the Stanford backfield is the
weak point. If Don Zappettini and
some of the other halfbacks settle
clown and turn in a good ball game,
Stanford may surprise the Broncos.
Hammett, Fawcett and Bill Sheller
give stability to the backfield and
they may help the sophomores hit
their stride tomorrow.
Sheller's punting against Washing
ton State was outstanding, but he
will have to kick 'em far and long
to rival A1 Santucci, the Bronco's
center, who is noted for being one of
the finest punters on the coast.
No matter how you figure the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, the In
dians are definite underdogs. "If
wo can win this one, it'll sure be an
upset," remarked Coach Marchie
Schwartz after practice the other day.
Stanford's Indians went through an
intensive two-hour light scrimmagc
against Santa Clara formations in
preparation for their game with the
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco tomorrow.
No heavy body contact woi-k was
held, and the entire squad was in
mood shape for the Santa Clara game.
Milt Vucinich, center, was desig
nated as game captain earlier this
week.
The Indians will go into the Santa
Clara game as decided underdogs on
the basis of last week's games. Stan
ford looked very impotent in losing
to Washington State. 6-0, while Santa
Clara exhibited lots of power in
beating Utah, 12-0. Santa Clara is
favored, 10-8.
FREITAS DANGEROUS
Jesse Freitas, famed Bronco passer,
had a field day against Utah and is
expected to take to the air against
Stanford if the sturdy Indian line
dents the Santa Clara running at
tack. Since the Stanford pass defense
looked woefully weak against Wash
ington State, Coach Buck Shaw of the
Broncos may elect to strike through
lite air early in the game. However,
the Indians have been drilling all
week on pass defense, particularly
against Santa Clara formations, and
should be ready for an air attack.
The big question mark to be settled
tomorrow afternoon is whether Stan
ford is the impotent team it appeared
to be against Washington State.
Against the Cougars, the Indians
gained only 59 yards all afternoon,
and all phases of the famed "T" for
mation attack wilted.
IMPROVE HACK FIELD TIMING
Coach Marchie Schwartz has been
drilling the Indians all week in an
effort to improve the intricate back
field timing required of the "T" for
mation. But most observers have
agreed that a lot of the Indians' poor
offense was due to nervousness on
the part of the Stanford backs who
haven't had much actual game expe
rience.
Fans expect Ray Hammett to settle
down tomorrow and turn in a good
game at quarterback. Hammett has
been passing particularly long and
accurately in practice, and he may
find holes in the Santa Clara pass
defense for long tosses to speedy
Indian ends and halfbacks.
SANTA C. 10-8 OVER STANFO...
FAWCETT MAY BREAK AWAY
But the Cards' still have their ace,
Buck Fawcett, to worry the Broncos.
Fawcett is probably one of the most
dangerous backs on the coast and he
may break away for long runs to
morrow.
During practice sessions this week,
Coach Schwartz has been concentrat
ing on quick opening plays between
the tackles, trying to break loose
speedy little A1 Hoisch. If the light
scat back ever gets into theo pen,
he's gone for a touchdown, and he
may be Schwartz's hope in the Santa
Clara game.
Although the entire squad is in
good health, Loren LaPrade, varsity
guard, was confined to the rest home
yesterday as a preventive measure.
Hi? is expected to be in ready for
the game tomorrow.
TAYLOR MAY DO IT AGAIN
The rest of the Indian forward wall
Hall, Banducci, Vucinich, Taylor,
Stamm, and Norberg—are ready to
halt the complicated spinners and
reverses which make up the Bx-oncos
ground attack. Chuck Taylor played
most of last year's Stanford-Santa
Clara game in the Bronco's backfield,
and the flashy red-headed guard may
help smother their attack again this
year.
The Stanford end problem was
solved decisively in the Washington
State game by the play of three soph
omores—Dave Brown. Bob Hall, and
Pete August. This trio, with Hank
Norberg and Rog Laverty, give the
Indians plenty of depth and strength
at the ends.
The rest of the line reserves are

tack. Since the Stanford pass defense
looked woefully weak against Wash
ington State, Coach Buck Shaw of the
Broncos may elect to strike through
lite air early in the game. However,
the Indians have been drilling all
week on pass defense, particularly
against Santa Clara formations, and
should be ready for an air attack.
The big question mark to be settled
tomorrow afternoon is whether Stan
ford is the impotent team it appeared
to be against Washington State.
Against the Cougars, the Indians
gained only 59 yards all afternoon,
and all phases of the famed "T" for
mation attack wilted.
IMPROVE HACK FIELD TIMING
Coach Marchie Schwartz has been
drilling the Indians all week in an
effort to improve the intricate back
field timing required of the "T" for
mation. But most observers have
agreed that a lot of the Indians' poor
offense was due to nervousness on
the part of the Stanford backs who
haven't had much actual game expe
rience.
Fans expect Ray Hammett to settle
down tomorrow and turn in a good
game at quarterback. Hammett has
been passing particularly long and
accurately in practice, and he may
find holes in the Santa Clara pass
defense for long tosses to speedy
Indian ends and halfbacks.
SANTA C. 10-8 OVER STANFO...
FAWCETT MAY BREAK AWAY
But the Cards' still have their ace,
Buck Fawcett, to worry the Broncos.
Fawcett is probably one of the most
dangerous backs on the coast and he
may break away for long runs to
morrow.
During practice sessions this week,
Coach Schwartz has been concentrat
ing on quick opening plays between
the tackles, trying to break loose
speedy little A1 Hoisch. If the light
scat back ever gets into theo pen,
he's gone for a touchdown, and he
may be Schwartz's hope in the Santa
Clara game.
Although the entire squad is in
good health, Loren LaPrade, varsity
guard, was confined to the rest home
yesterday as a preventive measure.
Hi? is expected to be in ready for
the game tomorrow.
TAYLOR MAY DO IT AGAIN
The rest of the Indian forward wall
Hall, Banducci, Vucinich, Taylor,
Stamm, and Norberg—are ready to
halt the complicated spinners and
reverses which make up the Bx-oncos
ground attack. Chuck Taylor played
most of last year's Stanford-Santa
Clara game in the Bronco's backfield,
and the flashy red-headed guard may
help smother their attack again this
year.
The Stanford end problem was
solved decisively in the Washington
State game by the play of three soph
omores—Dave Brown. Bob Hall, and
Pete August. This trio, with Hank
Norberg and Rog Laverty, give the
Indians plenty of depth and strength
at the ends.
The rest of the line reserves are
strong. The entire line is two deep
and the Broncos should be outplayed
in the forward wall.
BACKFIELD WEAK POINT
But the Stanford backfield is the
weak point. If Don Zappettini and
some of the other halfbacks settle
clown and turn in a good ball game,
Stanford may surprise the Broncos.
Hammett, Fawcett and Bill Sheller
give stability to the backfield and
they may help the sophomores hit
their stride tomorrow.
Sheller's punting against Washing
ton State was outstanding, but he
will have to kick 'em far and long
to rival A1 Santucci, the Bronco's
center, who is noted for being one of
the finest punters on the coast.
No matter how you figure the
Stanford-Santa Clara game, the In
dians are definite underdogs. "If

Stanford's Indians went through an
intensive two-hour light scrimmagc
against Santa Clara formations in
preparation for their game with the
Broncos in Kezar Stadium in San
Francisco tomorrow.
No heavy body contact woi-k was
held, and the entire squad was in
mood shape for the Santa Clara game.
Milt Vucinich, center, was desig
nated as game captain earlier this
week.
The Indians will go into the Santa
Clara game as decided underdogs on
the basis of last week's games. Stan
ford looked very impotent in losing
to Washington State. 6-0, while Santa
Clara exhibited lots of power in
beating Utah, 12-0. Santa Clara is
favored, 10-8.
