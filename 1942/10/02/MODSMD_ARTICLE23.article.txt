Stressing the importance of post
war discussions, Dr. Lee Chapin ad
dressed the Stanford debating team
yesterday at the squad's first meet
ing in which he outlined the duty
of the debating team during this war
crisis.
In his first address to the Farm de
baters since his return from Hawaii
| University, Dr. Chapin said, "Be
cause you as students are vitally
concerned with this war, and be
cause you will be bearing arms in
a very short time, it is very impor
tant that you must study the prob
lems of post war reconstruction. We
must plan a satisfactory peace this
time."
Due to the ever-changing domestic
problem, it will be impossible to
debate any national governmental
issue, Dr. Chapin pointed out, how
ever in discussing post-war prob
lems the debaters are making a defi
nite contribution to the war effort.
Jim Frolik, debate manager,
opened the meeting by mentioning
that the debate society will co-op
erate this year with The Stanford
War Board in giving talks on current
topics in the vai'ious living groups
and do other duties desired by
SWB.
There will be no eastern trip this
year, Frolik announced, however,
the number of intramural debates,
inter-collegiate debates, and other
contests will be greatly increased to
offset this disappointment.
