The average man entering the
United States armed forces today is
better-informed and knows his
"Three R's" better than his proto
type in any previous American army,
declared Grayson N. Kefauver, Dean
of School of Education, in taking
note of the current attack on pro
gressive education, which he claims
is "not exaggerated, but false."
However, Kefauver remarked that
the man who enters the Army still
does not know enough—he never
can.
In supporting the case of progres
sive education, Kefauver pointed out
that since war was declared, schools
havfc rapidly expanded their voca
tional teaching and have so far
turned out 4,000,000 trained for war
industry.
