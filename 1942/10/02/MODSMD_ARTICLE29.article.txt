# 'Wake Island' Shows Rough Action Shots
## 
### 
To the Japanese message "Will
you surrender?" the Commanding
Officer of the Wake Island defenders
replied, in behalf of his troops, "the j
enemy will get their answer in a !
few minutes." And they did with a i
storm of American hellfire.
This timely, dramatic, and excit
ing piece of entertainment relates
the actual events of Uncle Sam's
Marines on Wake Island as clearly
as the accounts have been recorded.
MALE CAST
The entire male cast is excellent, j
The other sex is not missed. Brian
Donlevy has the lead as chief engi
neer constructing fortifications on
the Island. He gives a splendid per
formance. Rough and tough as he
always is, he fits into the picture
perfectly.
Major of that courageous squad of
Marines is Robert Preston. Again
he does an outstanding piece of act
ing along with Mac Donald Carey
and Walter Abel.
The order "open fire" is given. That
first invading convoy is thoroughly
squelched. The accurate shols of
American dive - bombers, causing
smoke, fire, and destruction, is pre
lighting effects.
SECOND FEATURE
The two weeks of constant strug
gling on Wake Island is a blood
curdling episode. It is a privilege
and duty for all Americans to see a
re-enactment of the action, alertness,
and efficiency of the Marine Corps
defending our democratic rights.
"Priorities on Parade" is the sec
ond feature. A combination of "Jive
Bombers" and defense plant workers
provide a tiresome musical. Jerry
"Greeting Gates" Colonna supplies
the comedy. But he isn't enough to
make the movie attractive.â€”Goldman
