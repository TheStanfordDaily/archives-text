# Slaughter, Musial Help Beazley Check Yanks, 4-3
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Two rookies and a seasoned veteran got together yesterday in St. Louis
to give the Cardinals a 4-3 win over the New York Yankees and even the
count of the 1iÂ»42 World Series at one game apiece.
Triple heroes of the second contest were youngsters Johnny Beazley .
and Stan Musial and the veteran Enos "Country" Slaughter.
After Morton Cooper, the St. Louis ace moundsman, had failed in the

opener Wednesday, Beazley
balled the championship into submis
sion, although he gave up ten hits,
four more than the Yankees' Ernie
Bonham. With the exception of the
eighth inning, when Charley Keller
broke a hitless streak of three trips
by whacking a homer over the roof
in right field to tie the score, Beaz
ley was master.
MUSIAL MENDS WAYS
Musial, 20 years old, was the best
man in the Yankee lineup Wednes
day when he popped up in the ninth
inning with the bags loaded to
end the amazing Cardinal rally.
Yesterday, however, Musial. came
through with a single into center
field that drove Slaughter across
with the winning run.
Slaughter, who has guarded the
rightfield garden for St. Louis for
the last three years, probably de
serves as much credit for the Cardi
nal win as any man on the lineup.
He threw a perfect strike to Whi
tey Kurowski to nail Tuck Stain
back at third. Buddy Hassett sin
gled to Slaughter in right and Stain
back, running for Dickey, tried to
go from first to third: Eut even
Stainback, one of the fleetest men
in a New York uniform, couldn't
stave off that arm, and Kurowski
tagged him out.
YANKS STIFLED
Had Stainback made third, the
Yanks would have had men on first
and third with none out.
Bonham, hailed as the game's
greatest "control" pitcher, took the
mound and reached for two straight
for the Yankees. But his first in
ning wildness, something new in his
repertoire, ended with the Cards
scoring two runs.
Bonham walked Jimmy Brown
and threw too late to get him at
second on Terry Moore's sacrifice.
He settled down to put away
Slaughter and Musial, but Walker
Cooper slammed a double that his
the right field wall, driving in both
runnel's. Bonham had gone through
the regular season walking only 23
batters during 226 innings of pitch
ing.
KUROWSKI TRIPLES
Johnny Hopp singled in the sev
enth and Kurowski followed with
his first hit of the series, a rousing
triple down the left field line for
another St. Louis tally.
Then came a shaky eighth inning
for Beazley as Roy Cullenbine sin

gled, stole second, and came home
on Joe DiMaggio's one-base hit.
Came Keller to the plate to wallop
his home run, knotting the score at
3-alt
The Cardinals blasted right back |
in their half of the inning to swipe
the winning run off Bonham. j
Slaughter opened the inning with j
a double and went to third on Cul- j
lenbine's throw-in to Rizzuto that \
got by the Yankee shortstop and ]
dribbled into left field.
MUSIAL DOES IT
That set the stage for Musial's
hero-making hit, a sharp drive into
center that won the ball game.
Today the teams travel to New j
York to resume play at Yankee Sta
dium Saturday. Three games are j
slated there, and if the issue is still
undecided the clubs will return to [
St. Louis to end the series.
