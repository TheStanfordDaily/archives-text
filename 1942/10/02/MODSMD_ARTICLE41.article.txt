# 'Treason by Luxury'
## 
### 
THE system of priorities protects the steel,
copper, rubber, and other commodities that
the government needs from waste. With this
system in force we cannot bid against the gov
ernment for them, unless we do so on the
"black market."
However, there is a market in which we do
bid against the government. It deals not in
steel or rubber or luxuries that are no longer
obtainable, but in the necessities of life—food,
shelter, and clothing.
By consuming these necessities luxuriously,
by buying a new suit of clothes that you do not
need, by putting two lumps of sugar in your
coffee when one will suffice, by doing any of
these common wasteful things that have made
up our living habits in the past, we are ham
pering the government's war policy. In a sense
we are committing "treason by luxury." We
are bidding against the government for time
and men.
There are only a certain number of man
hours from which we can draw, and this total
has been seriously depleted by the huge Army
that is now being recruited. Part of these man
hours must be diverted away from the war ef
fort toward the manufacture of life's necessities.
If these necessities are consumed luxuriously,
the man hours used in their manufacture are
lost.
Although great quantities of things can still
be purchased without ration cards or without
priority listings, we should not buy these items
loosely. We should ration ourselves and buy
only those necessities that are necessary, and
we must keep in mind that luxurious consump
tion has no place in a war economy.—Al Hamp
