NEED we say that one of the basic freedoms
for which we are fighting is freedom of the
press? It was mentioned by Woodrow Wilson,

We of America like to say what we think.
That is one of our greatest privileges. Yester
day was the beginning of American Newspaper
Week. The Stanford Daily represents a very
small but very important part of the newspapers
throughout the country. We feel that because
the minds of tomorrow are being trained here
at Stanford and in other universities it is our
duty to keep the columns of this paper clean
and free from pressure groups of all kinds.
This does not mean that we are sitting on
our little pedestal high in the clouds immune
to criticism. That is what makes a newspaper.
It is those on the outside who look at the paper
from a different angle than we do that make the
paper a true student publication.
Thus we invite and reguest more letters to
our Campus Opinion column this week above
all. There are many controversial subjects at
hand here on the campus and in the nation.
This paper is the place to express your opin
ions.
To the newspapers of America we pledge
