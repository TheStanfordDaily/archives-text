CLIMAX seems near in the battle of Stalingrad,
in which, according to the Soviets, 25,0U0 Germans
fell last week. A Russian relief army is battling toward
the city from the north-west, and the Nazis are direct
ing their assaults to the north-west of the city to cut
it off from this possible assistance.
Any discussion of the war in Russia leads inevitably
to the question of Russia's position in the peace, that
"just and lasting peace," that Americans, including
myself, are so sure is coming. So, presuming always
that Deutschland is not über alles, and that the war is
won equally by the Eastern and Western Allies, how is
Russia to be treated?
♦ * * *
IT must be remembered th.xt before June 22, 1941,
the U.S.S.R. was just another totalitarian aggressor.
Besides the scraps of Finland picked up in that round,
the Reds acquired all of eastern Poland with a quick
stab-in-the-back in Sept. '39. They established a mili
tary occupation, and later annexed, the three Baltic
republics, Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthonia, three re
publics existing by the grace of President Wilson and
self-determination. They took a chunk of Rumania,
too.
The Atlantic Charter calls for this same self-deter
mination, and decries transfers of territory and au
thority implemented by force. We can be sure that
Russia is playing for Russia alone, and how can the
Western Allies reconcile their Charter with Soviet de
mands for secure borders?
Must we compromise with our published principles,
and leave these acquisitions to the tender mercies of
Communism and dictatorship? Or, after straining every
nerve to arm and aid the U.S.S.R., do we attack it,
with the highest motives, ourselves? I don't know, I'm
askin'.

it off from this possible assistance.
Any discussion of the war in Russia leads inevitably
to the question of Russia's position in the peace, that
"just and lasting peace," that Americans, including
myself, are so sure is coming. So, presuming always
that Deutschland is not über alles, and that the war is
won equally by the Eastern and Western Allies, how is
Russia to be treated?

IT must be remembered th.xt before June 22, 1941,
the U.S.S.R. was just another totalitarian aggressor.
Besides the scraps of Finland picked up in that round,
the Reds acquired all of eastern Poland with a quick
stab-in-the-back in Sept. '39. They established a mili
tary occupation, and later annexed, the three Baltic
republics, Latvia, Lithuania, and Esthonia, three re
publics existing by the grace of President Wilson and
self-determination. They took a chunk of Rumania,
too.
The Atlantic Charter calls for this same self-deter
mination, and decries transfers of territory and au
thority implemented by force. We can be sure that
Russia is playing for Russia alone, and how can the
Western Allies reconcile their Charter with Soviet de
mands for secure borders?
Must we compromise with our published principles,
and leave these acquisitions to the tender mercies of
Communism and dictatorship? Or, after straining every
nerve to arm and aid the U.S.S.R., do we attack it,
with the highest motives, ourselves? I don't know, I'm
askin'.
Oct. 2, 1942.
