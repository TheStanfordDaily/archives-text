THE TIP-OFF
The tip-off came Wednesday night.
There were a lot of people sitting around a big yel
low table up in the Excom meeting room. They arc
all nice people, I guess. I don't know very many of
them so I really can't say, but they are all nice people
to look at. The young men were suited and coatcd and
their hair was all combed to the last little strand. And
the young women were all dressed very neatly, just
like the college women in newspaper ads, and were
all very prettily coiffeured. Several of the young
women were blond, too.
* * * *
Then discussion came up about whether or not to
grant Rally Committee a date.
The rally in question would have been held last
night. Now rallies are a fine thing. The football team
sits big and block-like and imposing up at one end of
the basketball pavilion behind the cheerleaders and the
master of ceremonies, the band in fine Cardinal-and
white uniforms marches into the large structure toot
ing at the top of their lungs, the freshmen plop them
selves on the floor in the middle of the Gym with brand
new rooters' caps, and all the venerable upper-classmen
I file into the bleachers.
Then there is a lot of rah-rah-rah and a lot of
semi-singing and somebody gets up and exhorts "the
old team to give the old fight for the old school" and
someone from the team usually reciprocates with
"we'll give the old school the old fight by the old team."
And everybody is touched and the frosh wander out
very impressed and thrilled and the upper-classmen
| suck their cigarettes and nonchalantly meander home.
What a lot of unity these rallies furnish for the stu
i dent body!
.* * * *
Well, anyway, these nice people around that big
yellow table in the Excom room liked the idea of hav
ing a rally. Someone moved that the date be granted
to Rally Committee—and the motion quickly passed.
This is not to Rive the impression that all the people
in that room were for the rally.
There was the neat little cutie who is Vice-Presi
i dent of your Associated Students who pointed out in
j a quiet, dignified manner that Rally Committee was
I hardly prepared to put on a good rally, that rallies are
only a questionable means with which to build student
I unity. It was a gutty stand.
There was the Editor of the Daily who, with an
honest passion, stated that the Civilian Defense Council
on this campus doesn't know which way it is going—
said that even the professors on the Council were so
confused that they admitted their own confusion—be
| tween gags. More guts.
.* * * *
There was a young man in glasses and a perpetual
| black hat who said something about a war—something
which the nice people at the big yellow table didn't
catch very well. Guts, sure.
And there was the retiring head of the Stanford
War Board (you know—those pests that come around
i and try to sell you bonds, stamps, and old rubber) who
j mentioned what I've been mentioning, guts. Only this
| young man meant the word in its most literal sense.
| He said lots of fellows like the nice young fellows sit—
1 ting around the Excom table were foregoing much of
their lives for a place called the U.S.A. He said we
i might try to get a little more U.S.A. spirit and, per
haps. let the old rah-rah get along by itself for a while.
J He said we might even try to do something a little
j constructive for the U.S.A. But, of course, he added,
; he didn't want to horn in on the business of the stu
dents' representatives too much. He left for his home
yesterday morning to enlist in the Army.
But the representatives of the students—elected
representatives—couldn't see it the way these four
! people did.
The nice blondes (Pi Phi's someone called 'em) voted
for a rally. And the strikingly handsome young man
who sat next to the President and hadn't opened his
yap all through the debate voted for the rally. And
this trio gathered several others behind it to put the
; big rah-rah across.
* * * #
But the smart little Vice-President had one more
trick up her sleeve. So she hauled the young man who
is the chairman of the Rally Committee before Excom
and he admitted he wasn't ready to put on a good rally,
i And then, grudgingly, all the nice young men and
women at the big yellow table had to decide that maybe
i it wouldn t be a good idea to have a rally. And so there
wasn't any rally last night.
But to me it was more than that. It was the tip-off
: on who is who among "our student leaders."
I hope this helps to tip you off a little.
