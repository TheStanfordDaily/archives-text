# Farm to Play Host To Bay Area Colleges
## 
### 
November 14, 15, and 16, Stanford
will play host to fifteen colleges of
the Bay Area in the annual meeting
of the National Student Federation
Association. This year the meeting
of the N.S.F.A. will be devoted to the
discussion of current problems in the
running of war-time student govern
ment.
Stanford students will be repre
sented by co-chairmen of the event,
Francis Harvey and Merwin Lisiecki.
"At this time a conference to deal
with local problems of student gov
ernment would be profitable to all
colleges said Miss Harvey. "We hope
that other colleges in other areas
will hold similar meetings that we
may compare notes and decide what
is the best policy to take in the
emergency."
The local committee hopes that
Professor Lewis Mumford of the new
School of Humanities will be present
to discuss government policies.
