SANTA CLARA, Oct. 1 (Special '
to The Daily)— Returning from the
Salt Lake desert region where he
succeeded in tossing the Utah Red
skin for a 12-0 throttling, the Santa
Clara Bronco is once again in his
native corral in Kczar Stadium, and
today sees the bucking mustang at
tempting to throw the tough Stan
ford Indian.
They say the Bronco is thirsty,
and the apparent throat quencher
appears to be a cup of the vaunted
Stanford T. Twice before the Santa
Clara steed has attempted to drink
of the beverage which the boys are
serving down on the Farm, and twice
the strength of the T has bowled
him over. But it has been whispered
up in the region of the Prune Valley
that the third time will be the charm,
and with this thought in mind that
I pick Coach t Lawrence Timothy
"Buck" Shaw's Broncos to take Stan
ford tomorrow afternoon.
FREITAS IN BACKFIELD
Tomorrow will see a great Indian
line battle one of the smoothest back
field combinations in the country.
Led by the sensational pigskin pitch
ing of Jesse Freitas, and the hard
driving "Hell for leather" running
of Bill Prentice and Paul Vinolla,
Santa Clara is out to run up double
digit total on the score board. In
Pete' Davis and Les Palm the Mis
sion School has a pair of blocking
quarterbacks that are set to rock the
Stanford linemen.
It is interesting to note the fact that
Shaw will have a trio of sophomores
in the starting backtiold, along with
another second year at the left guard
spot. The Silver Fox rates his full
back, Prentice, as one of the Pacific
Coast's outstanding powerhouses,
while the sport scribes who watched
the Broncos perform in Salt Lake
City hail Vinolla as the 1942 sopho
more sensation. Davis is the other
soph in the quartet of backs, while
Bart Gianelli will open at guard.
AERIAL CIRCUS
The Shaw eleven boasts an aerial
circus in the Freitas to Alyn Beals
passing combination. Stanford will
5 remember Beals, who was the most
j outstanding flankman to face them
last season. An artist in faking his
opponents out of position, Beals is
heralded as the greatest pass catch
ing end in college football. His ex
ploits are backed by the records in
as much as during the 1941 grid
campaign he scored 60 points. A1
has been honored for his achieve
ments and today will captain Santa
Clara.
Freitas is a deluxe package when
it comes to the air department, and
he has few peers in spot passing.
Against Oregon last year he compiled
the amazing record of hurling ten
straight strikes, with Beals being on
the receiving end of the majority of
the stratosphere heaves. Some ob
servers go out on the limb so far as
to say that the Freitas to Beals act
is the modern version of the Dixie
Howell to Don Hutson show that
beat Stanford in the Rose Bowl in
1935.
BEALS AT WING
At the wing posts Beals will have
Ken Dowing as his running mate,
with big Tom Fears, 215 sophomore,
slated to see plenty of action. Ed
Alliguie and Frank Zmak are the
starting tackles, with Sheldon Harden
and Gianelli at the guard berths.
The pivot post will see A1 Santucci
and Eddie Forrest sharing the action.

Santucci handles the Bronco punting
assignments and is one of the Coast's
best in the kicking game. Forrest
ranks as a great line backer and is
the aggressive type of a player that
wins the favor of the fans with his
play.
There you have them. The boys
who will do havoc with the Indians.
Other names that will loom on the
Santa Clara horizon will be Pat
Higgins, Dave.Boland, Jim Desmond,
Art McCaffray, Tony Schiro, Dan
Wallis, and John Klarich. Anyone
of the men might be the name that
will be heralded Sunday morning in
the headlines as the -star that led the
Broncos over Stanford.
The final score might well read
Santa Clara 20, Stanford 0.

At the wing posts Beals will have

There you have them. The boys

SANTA CLARA, Oct. 1 (Special '
to The Daily)— Returning from the
Salt Lake desert region where he
succeeded in tossing the Utah Red
skin for a 12-0 throttling, the Santa
Clara Bronco is once again in his
native corral in Kczar Stadium, and
today sees the bucking mustang at
tempting to throw the tough Stan
ford Indian.
They say the Bronco is thirsty,
and the apparent throat quencher
appears to be a cup of the vaunted
Stanford T. Twice before the Santa
Clara steed has attempted to drink
of the beverage which the boys are
serving down on the Farm, and twice
the strength of the T has bowled
him over. But it has been whispered
up in the region of the Prune Valley
that the third time will be the charm,
and with this thought in mind that
I pick Coach t Lawrence Timothy
"Buck" Shaw's Broncos to take Stan
ford tomorrow afternoon.
FREITAS IN BACKFIELD
Tomorrow will see a great Indian
line battle one of the smoothest back
field combinations in the country.
Led by the sensational pigskin pitch
ing of Jesse Freitas, and the hard
driving "Hell for leather" running
of Bill Prentice and Paul Vinolla,
Santa Clara is out to run up double
digit total on the score board. In
Pete' Davis and Les Palm the Mis
sion School has a pair of blocking
quarterbacks that are set to rock the
Stanford linemen.
It is interesting to note the fact that
Shaw will have a trio of sophomores
in the starting backtiold, along with
another second year at the left guard
spot. The Silver Fox rates his full
back, Prentice, as one of the Pacific
Coast's outstanding powerhouses,
while the sport scribes who watched
the Broncos perform in Salt Lake
City hail Vinolla as the 1942 sopho
more sensation. Davis is the other
soph in the quartet of backs, while
Bart Gianelli will open at guard.
AERIAL CIRCUS
The Shaw eleven boasts an aerial
circus in the Freitas to Alyn Beals
passing combination. Stanford will
5 remember Beals, who was the most
j outstanding flankman to face them
last season. An artist in faking his
opponents out of position, Beals is
heralded as the greatest pass catch
ing end in college football. His ex
ploits are backed by the records in
as much as during the 1941 grid
campaign he scored 60 points. A1
has been honored for his achieve
ments and today will captain Santa
Clara.
Freitas is a deluxe package when
it comes to the air department, and
he has few peers in spot passing.
Against Oregon last year he compiled
the amazing record of hurling ten
straight strikes, with Beals being on
the receiving end of the majority of
the stratosphere heaves. Some ob

Stanford linemen.
It is interesting to note the fact that
Shaw will have a trio of sophomores
in the starting backtiold, along with
another second year at the left guard
spot. The Silver Fox rates his full
back, Prentice, as one of the Pacific
Coast's outstanding powerhouses,
while the sport scribes who watched
the Broncos perform in Salt Lake
City hail Vinolla as the 1942 sopho
more sensation. Davis is the other
soph in the quartet of backs, while
Bart Gianelli will open at guard.
AERIAL CIRCUS
The Shaw eleven boasts an aerial
circus in the Freitas to Alyn Beals
passing combination. Stanford will
5 remember Beals, who was the most
j outstanding flankman to face them
last season. An artist in faking his
opponents out of position, Beals is
heralded as the greatest pass catch
ing end in college football. His ex
ploits are backed by the records in
as much as during the 1941 grid
campaign he scored 60 points. A1
has been honored for his achieve
ments and today will captain Santa
Clara.
Freitas is a deluxe package when
it comes to the air department, and
he has few peers in spot passing.
Against Oregon last year he compiled
the amazing record of hurling ten
straight strikes, with Beals being on
the receiving end of the majority of
the stratosphere heaves. Some ob
servers go out on the limb so far as
to say that the Freitas to Beals act
is the modern version of the Dixie
Howell to Don Hutson show that
beat Stanford in the Rose Bowl in
1935.
BEALS AT WING
At the wing posts Beals will have
Ken Dowing as his running mate,
with big Tom Fears, 215 sophomore,
slated to see plenty of action. Ed
Alliguie and Frank Zmak are the
starting tackles, with Sheldon Harden
and Gianelli at the guard berths.
The pivot post will see A1 Santucci
and Eddie Forrest sharing the action.

Santucci handles the Bronco punting
assignments and is one of the Coast's
best in the kicking game. Forrest
ranks as a great line backer and is
the aggressive type of a player that
wins the favor of the fans with his
play.
There you have them. The boys
who will do havoc with the Indians.
Other names that will loom on the
Santa Clara horizon will be Pat
Higgins, Dave.Boland, Jim Desmond,
Art McCaffray, Tony Schiro, Dan
Wallis, and John Klarich. Anyone
of the men might be the name that
will be heralded Sunday morning in
the headlines as the -star that led the
Broncos over Stanford.
The final score might well read
Santa Clara 20, Stanford 0.

SANTA CLARA, Oct. 1 (Special '
to The Daily)— Returning from the
Salt Lake desert region where he
succeeded in tossing the Utah Red
skin for a 12-0 throttling, the Santa
Clara Bronco is once again in his
native corral in Kczar Stadium, and
today sees the bucking mustang at
tempting to throw the tough Stan
ford Indian.
They say the Bronco is thirsty,
and the apparent throat quencher
appears to be a cup of the vaunted
Stanford T. Twice before the Santa
Clara steed has attempted to drink
of the beverage which the boys are
serving down on the Farm, and twice
the strength of the T has bowled
him over. But it has been whispered
up in the region of the Prune Valley
that the third time will be the charm,
and with this thought in mind that
I pick Coach t Lawrence Timothy
"Buck" Shaw's Broncos to take Stan
ford tomorrow afternoon.
FREITAS IN BACKFIELD
Tomorrow will see a great Indian
line battle one of the smoothest back
field combinations in the country.
Led by the sensational pigskin pitch
ing of Jesse Freitas, and the hard
driving "Hell for leather" running
of Bill Prentice and Paul Vinolla,
Santa Clara is out to run up double
digit total on the score board. In
Pete' Davis and Les Palm the Mis
sion School has a pair of blocking
quarterbacks that are set to rock the
Stanford linemen.
