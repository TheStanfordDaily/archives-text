SANTA CLARA, Oct. 1 (Special '
to The Daily)— Returning from the
Salt Lake desert region where he
succeeded in tossing the Utah Red
skin for a 12-0 throttling, the Santa
Clara Bronco is once again in his
native corral in Kczar Stadium, and
today sees the bucking mustang at
tempting to throw the tough Stan
ford Indian.
They say the Bronco is thirsty,
and the apparent throat quencher
appears to be a cup of the vaunted
Stanford T. Twice before the Santa
Clara steed has attempted to drink
of the beverage which the boys are
serving down on the Farm, and twice
the strength of the T has bowled
him over. But it has been whispered
up in the region of the Prune Valley
that the third time will be the charm,
and with this thought in mind that
I pick Coach t Lawrence Timothy
"Buck" Shaw's Broncos to take Stan
ford tomorrow afternoon.
FREITAS IN BACKFIELD
Tomorrow will see a great Indian
line battle one of the smoothest back
field combinations in the country.
Led by the sensational pigskin pitch
ing of Jesse Freitas, and the hard
driving "Hell for leather" running
of Bill Prentice and Paul Vinolla,
Santa Clara is out to run up double
digit total on the score board. In
Pete' Davis and Les Palm the Mis
sion School has a pair of blocking
quarterbacks that are set to rock the
Stanford linemen.
It is interesting to note the fact that
Shaw will have a trio of sophomores
in the starting backtiold, along with
another second year at the left guard
spot. The Silver Fox rates his full
back, Prentice, as one of the Pacific
Coast's outstanding powerhouses,
while the sport scribes who watched
the Broncos perform in Salt Lake
City hail Vinolla as the 1942 sopho
more sensation. Davis is the other
soph in the quartet of backs, while
Bart Gianelli will open at guard.
AERIAL CIRCUS
The Shaw eleven boasts an aerial
circus in the Freitas to Alyn Beals
passing combination. Stanford will
5 remember Beals, who was the most
j outstanding flankman to face them
