# Friend of Thai King Studies Engineering at Farm School

"Hi, Roy!" Rachan Vanjan-Vanit, son of a prominent Siamese engineer
and close friend of the former king of Thailand, grinned and yelled hack
a similar greeting to one of his Toyon friends as he sat over a 10 o'clock
coke in the Cellar.
Born and reared in Bangkok, Thailand, "Roy" has hccomc as American-

ized as his nickname since he
to this country almost two years ago.
"I still don't like these coca colas,"
he confided, "but I drink them be
cause it's the thing to do."
Roy has been a student at Stanford
for almost a year though he has
attended both George Washington
University and the University of
Miami since he arrived in the United
States. He's majoring in mining en
gineering and there's a look of de
termination in his eyes when he says
he hopes to go back to Siam some
day and develop its resources.
BANGKOK MAIL
Since the first of October, Roy has
received no word from his family
who are still in Bangkok as far as
he knows. It took about twenty days
for a letter to reach him way back
then and the postage for a two-page
letter came to over a dollar.
In that last letter to come out of
Siam, Roy said his father hinted of
an impending Japanese invasion.
"The people of Thailand," he wrote,
"will fight if the Japs come." Roy
shook his head thoughtfully when
asked about the actual invasion.
"They didn't have much to fight
with," he said.
This young Siamese student does
not say much about what's going on
over there but you can be sure he
is well informed on the latest events.
Every morning he listens to the
short wave broadcasts that are fil
tered through a large station on the
coast of China. Japanese propa
ganda is an old story to him, but
occasionally the real news slips
through the walls of censorship in
his occupied homeland and is picked
up by the American networks.
BOY KING OF SIAM
One of Roy's close friends is the
former boy king of Siam who at
tended the same high school he did
in Bangkok. Democracy was once
an actuality in Thailand under the
constitutional monarchy form of gov
ernment. When the Japanese march
ed in, according to Roy, the young
king resigned and is now attending
i school, in Switzerland.
The foreign population of Thai
land, Roy says, was small before
the war. There were only about
fifty Japanese in the country and
about 153 Americans. "The latter
i have decreased markedly and the
j former increased about 200 per cent,"
! he remarked grimly.
Roy intends to finish his engineer
ing course this summer and perhaps
to follow his career back in the min
ing section of Siam after the war is
over and his country free again. He
hasn't lost faith in that fact or his
optimism of the future. A lot of us
could take a lesson in his brand of
t confidence and courage.
