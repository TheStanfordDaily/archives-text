# Blood Bank Issues Call For Donors
## Volunteers Sign Up Afternoons at Union War Board Office 
### 
Stanford's Blood Bank, one of the
University's most valuable contri
butions to the war effort, again is
sues a call for volunteers.
"We students can do our country
a very direct service by helping the
Blood Bank, a service possibly of
more direct value than any of our
other wartime activities. A dona
tion to the Blood Bank takes only
45 minutes and may save a life,"
states Rosamund Fuller, campus
chairman for the Blood Bank.
SIGN AT WAR OFFICE
Volunteers may sign up any after
noon in the Stanford War Office,
Room 13 in the Old Union. Actual
donations will be made in Palo Alto
the first and third Thursday of
every month from 11 a.m. to 2 p.m.
beginning Oct. 15.
"Every student possible should
contribute to the Blood Bank for his
share in the war effort. Our dona
tions have already saved the lives
of many of our fighting men, and
can save many more if we volunteer
for the Blood Bank," continued Miss
Fuller. "The actual donation of a
quart of blood is painless and takes
very little time."
Persons under 21 must have a slip
with their parents' signature in order
to contribute their blood. Donors
should obtain these slips from the
war office as soon as possible in
order to have them signed before
Oct. 15.
SECOND DONORS WAIT 8 WEEKS
Anyone who has donated to the
Blood Bank must wait eight weeks
before making a second donation.
Stanford is co-operating with the
Palo Alto Chapter of the Red Cross
in its work on the Blood Bank. A
mobile unit from San Francisco
makes periodic trips along the Pe
ninsula to accept blood donations
from, the various localities.
