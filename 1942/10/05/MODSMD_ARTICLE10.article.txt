# O'Neill Calls For Gaieties Skits & Songs
## 
### 
The Big Game Gaieties is get
ting under way, and Director Bob
O'Neill wants ideas.
Annual production highlight of
Big Game week, the Gaieties is a
compilation of songs, skits, and
production ideas submitted by stu
dents, and, according to O'Neill, the
success of the show depends largely
on the amount turned inâ€”and the
sooner the better.
Material, especially in the music
line, should be as fully developed
on paper as possible and, although
a definite deadline has not yet been
set, it will be about the end of next
week. Anyone on the committee of
selection, comprised of John Lawry,
Bill Struthers, Asher Wilson, and
John Boucher, will accept ideas, or
they may be turned in at the Ram's
Head office, Room 2, Old Union.
Temporary staff for the Gaieties
appointed during Wednesday night's
Ram's Head meeting are Hal Levitt,
technical director, and Paul Holstet
ler, production manager.
