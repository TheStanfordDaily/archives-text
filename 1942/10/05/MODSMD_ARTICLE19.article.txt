# GRIDDERS ENTRAIN 6:33 TONIGHT
## Players Making Trip To Be Named Today 
### 
Stanford's varsity squad will work
out briefly today at 2 p.m. before
entraining tonight at 6:33 for South
Bend, Ind., and the Notre Dame
game next Saturday.
Coach Marchie Schwartz will
take 28 players back East and will
select the squad to make the trip
during today's practice.
The Indians will arrive in South
Bend on Wednesday and work out
Wednesday and Thursday. The team
will probably rest Friday before
meeting the Irish in Knutc Rockne
Memorial Stadium on Saturday.
It will be a homecoming for Coach
Schwartz, for he is one of Notre
Dame's immortals â€” having played
left halfback on the Rockne "won
der teams" of 1929, '30. and '31. In
his last year he was an Ail-Ameri
can.
The Indians will be trying hard to
break into the win column, after
dropping games to Washington State
and Santa Clara. Notre Dame, a
pre-season favorite for the mythical
national championship, has tied a

strong Wisconsin team, 7-7. and lost
last week in an upset to Georgia
Tech. So the Irish will also be out
for their first win.
Stanford's squad came out of the
Santa Clara game uninjured and
will be at top strength for Notre
