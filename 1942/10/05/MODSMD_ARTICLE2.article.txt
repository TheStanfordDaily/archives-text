LONDON, Oct. 4 (UP).â€”German
Reichsmarshal Hermann Goering
admitted tonight in a radio address
that it was impossible to ward off
British air attacks on Germany be
cause his air force is too busy in
Russia, but he said that once the
Soviet is beaten "we will turn all
our might against England."
Meanwhile, he promised the peo
ple of the bombed areas a larger
ration of meat.
Speaking for an hour and 50 min
utes in Berlin's Sportspalast on the
occasion of the harvest thanksgiving,
Goering warned the German people
to expect another long winter of
war in Russia which "won't be easy
but will be different because this
time we have prepared and grown
wise."
