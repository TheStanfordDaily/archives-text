### 
CHUNGKING, Oct. 4 (U.R)â€”Wen
dell L. Willkie said today that im
perialistic "spheres of influence"
which have held back China's prog
ress for a century must be abolished
in the post-war world along with
the mandate system of the League of
Nations.
In their place, Willkie said, must
stand a totally free China entering
on a new era in which the traditional
poverty of China's masses will be
ended.
His statement followed a tour of
Chungking's modern textile, paper
and chemical factories.
