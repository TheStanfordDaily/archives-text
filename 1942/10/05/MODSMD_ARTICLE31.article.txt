# Russians Hold Stalingrad Gains Despite Continuous Nazi Tank, Infantry Push
## Reds Counter-Attack to Halt Push; 'Big' Battle Rages on Mozdok Front As Germans Drive on Grozny Fields 
### 
MOSCOW, Monday, Oct. 5 (UP). —Massed German tanks and infantry
attacked incessantly 011 the Stalingrad front yesterday, struggling to wipe
out limited Red Army gains and reclaim the wavering initiative, only to
b< heaten off hy powerful Soviet counter-blows, the high command re
ported today.
A skimpy Red Army summary of the crucial struggle raging along

the winding line through the ruins
of the Volga city said that in one
unidentified sector two tank - led
German infantry battalions assaulted
a Soviet position six times during
the day.
Hard-hitting Soviet troops, sup
ported by an artillery barrage, re
pelled all attacks, the Sunday mid
night communique of the high com
mand «,aid, wiping out 200 German
shock troops.
Early Russian reports acknowl
edged but a single setback along the
battle line running through the
ruined streets. That was a Soviet
withdrawal from an inhabited point
northwest of the city.
The official newspaper Pravda
said "the greatest battle ever" has
been raging for a week on the Moz
dok front above the Grozny oil fields,
where massed German tanks and
motorized infantry struggled to
break through a hilly region.
VALLEY OF DEATH
An extremely critical situation
prevailed Friday, Pravda said, when
a break-through appeared immi
nent as the Germans struck with
packs of 120 tanks. But the Rus
sians repelled five successive at
tacks, smashing 126 tanks and kill
ing more than 2,000 men in what
now is called "the valley of death."
Below Novorossisk in the north
west Caucasus, a large Axis force
based south of the Kuban River
was reported trying to smash
through the mountains to the Black
Sea behind Red Army positions.
German flame throwers kindled
great fires in a thick forest guarding
the Black Sea approaches, but dis
patches said the front lines had not
changed materially for days.
RUMANIANS ROUTED
South of the city a Soviet unit
routed the Fifth Rumanian infantry
regiment, while to the northwest in
continued operations along the Ger
man left flank the Russians cap
tured a fortified position, wiped out
a company of infantry and seized
considerable booty.
Supplementary dispatches said
that in northwest Stalingrad the Red
Army attacked in force in an indus
trial district, battering through sev
eral streets and improving the So
viets' general position.
Earlier front dispatches said the
Red Army was pressing its limited
initiative in and around Stalingrad,
recapturing part of an industrial
settlement in the northwest metro
politan area, had driven the Ger
mans from a large area to the south
west, and slashed deeper into the
enemy flank across the Don-Volga
river corridor.
