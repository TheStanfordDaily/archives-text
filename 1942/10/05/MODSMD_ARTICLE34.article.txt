-1 i I • i I ity of a second front in Europe
M > ipies a "very important place,
(.ti might say a place of first rate"
~ the Soviet estimate of the current
v:; i situation.
Stalin, in a statement made avail
aiile to American correspondents in
Moscow, said Allied aid to Russia,
:<s compared with the Soviet Union's
contribution to the cause of the
United Nations, "has so far been
little effective."
"In order to amplify and improve
this aid," the leader of all the So
viets asserted, "only one thing is
required: that the Allies fulfill their
oi.'ligations fully and on time."
NO INTERVIEW
Stalin issued one of his rare pro
nouncements directly on issues of
worldwide moment in the form of a
]( tier to correspondents answering
three questions put to him in writ
hit;. He described it as in lieu of

an interview which the pressure of
work made it impossible for him to
grant.
He made no direct connection be
tween his pronouncement on the
importance of a second front and the
implicit call to the Allies to fulfill
their obligations "fully and on
time."
LONDON OPINION
LONDON, Oct. 4 (UP).—Qualified
London observers believed tonight
that Premier Josef Stalin's second
front statement was designed to
bring pressure on the British and
American governments for an Allied
invasion of the continent imme
diately.
They believed that Stalin's state
ment was aimed especially at the
assertion recently by a high for
eign source in London that Allied
failure to open a second front soon
might cause strained relations with
Russia which would have serious
consequences both during and after
the war.
