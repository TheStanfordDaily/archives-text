# Co-Op House Leads Campus With 2.86 Grade Average
## 
### 
The Walter Thompson Co-operative House, newest living group on cam
pus, leads other living groups scholastically for the year 1941-42 with a
2.86 ratio of grade points to units, according to the annual statistical report
on grades released this morning.
Union residence followed second with a standing of 2.83, while Alpha
Kappa Lambda led the fraternities with 2.79. Gamma Phi took top honors
for the sororities and El Tigre for the eating clubs with ratings of 2.76.
Liquid extra-curricular activities toppled El Capitan, three-year men's
scholastic leader, from its perch, while the Union replaced Casa Ventura
as the women's highest group.
The war, which started just before Autumn Quarter finals, made no ap
preciable difference in the grades of Stanford men and women. Highest
group averages were made during Winter Quarter as in past years, while
Autumn and Spring Quarter averages balanced just about evenly.
The University average for the past year was identical with the average
of the year before: 2.53.
The column headed "Standing" shows how the ratios of individual
groups compare with the average of the University.

The Walter Thompson Co-operative House, newest living group on cam
pus, leads other living groups scholastically for the year 1941-42 with a
2.86 ratio of grade points to units, according to the annual statistical report
on grades released this morning.
Union residence followed second with a standing of 2.83, while Alpha
Kappa Lambda led the fraternities with 2.79. Gamma Phi took top honors
for the sororities and El Tigre for the eating clubs with ratings of 2.76.
Liquid extra-curricular activities toppled El Capitan, three-year men's
scholastic leader, from its perch, while the Union replaced Casa Ventura
as the women's highest group.
The war, which started just before Autumn Quarter finals, made no ap
preciable difference in the grades of Stanford men and women. Highest
group averages were made during Winter Quarter as in past years, while
Autumn and Spring Quarter averages balanced just about evenly.
The University average for the past year was identical with the average
of the year before: 2.53.
The column headed "Standing" shows how the ratios of individual
groups compare with the average of the University.

The Walter Thompson Co-operative House, newest living group on cam
pus, leads other living groups scholastically for the year 1941-42 with a
2.86 ratio of grade points to units, according to the annual statistical report
on grades released this morning.
Union residence followed second with a standing of 2.83, while Alpha
Kappa Lambda led the fraternities with 2.79. Gamma Phi took top honors
for the sororities and El Tigre for the eating clubs with ratings of 2.76.
Liquid extra-curricular activities toppled El Capitan, three-year men's
scholastic leader, from its perch, while the Union replaced Casa Ventura
as the women's highest group.
The war, which started just before Autumn Quarter finals, made no ap
preciable difference in the grades of Stanford men and women. Highest
group averages were made during Winter Quarter as in past years, while
Autumn and Spring Quarter averages balanced just about evenly.
The University average for the past year was identical with the average
of the year before: 2.53.
The column headed "Standing" shows how the ratios of individual
groups compare with the average of the University.
