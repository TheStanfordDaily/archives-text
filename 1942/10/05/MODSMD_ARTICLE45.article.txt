# NOTRE DAME VIA SANTA CLARA:
## 
### 
Maybe you saw it, maybe you didn't, but Marchie Schwartz' footballers
looked good enough in the second half against Buck Shaw's Broncos to do
something mighty upsettish at South Bend come next Saturday.
We saw Ray Hammett tackled behind the line of scrimmage so many

times we quit counting. But we
thought his protection was poor, in
fact, rather superfluous. We saw
Hank Norberg zoom in and block A1
Santucci's kick only to have Buck
Fawcett pass square into the hands
of Pat Higgins on the first play.
Screwiest thing about that parti
cular backfire was that no one was
supposed to say anything about it
before the game so that no Bronco
could get hold of it. So what hap
pens: the play comes off with no ad
vance info to the enemy, and the
enemy comes up with ball instead.
We saw a doughty Stanford line,
back on its feet after just getting
started against Washington State.
That line choked the Santa Clara
running attack so well that Santa
Clara didn't make one first down in
the first three quarters.
We thought we saw what was
later confirmed by the camera,
Fawcett and Hammett smacking
into each other after Jesse Freitas'
pass floated over their heads to

that wonderful pass snatcher, Alyn Bcals.
We consircr the Bronco end's ability to get behind both Indian defenders
something no good defensive man ever allowsâ€”not so much as a point
in his favor but merely the untimely carelessness of Fawcett and Hammett.
To show that Fawcett figured out Mr. Bcals was evident when he inter
cepted the next pass from Freitas when Bcals came at him and once
more attempted to outsnookcr him. as F. I). "Spud" Lewis so aptly put
it in one of yesterday morning's city papers.
A sophomore, Mark Caffall, some never knew he was on the roster, took
the team in hand and the Redskins marched.
Roger Lavert} grabbed Santucci's kiekoff and swept up the sidelines
like a perpetual man-in-motion and seemed on his way to score until
knocked down after a 28-yard gain. Fred Sanderman, in at left half,
made 7 on a quick opener, and Fawcett and Bill Sheller got together for
a first down on Stanford's 49.
The attack was finally stopped when Caffall was nailed behind the line
while looking for a receiver what wasn't.
Hammett went back into the game in the fourth quarter, and as it finally
happened, it was the vets who made the score. Hammett passed first to
Dave Brown to carry Stanford to the mid-field stripe. Hammett was get
ling the protection he missed during the first half and hit his receivers
like we like it.
Laverty took the next Indian aerial and raced for 2."t more yards.
Moments Infer Fawcett took Hammett's pass behind a screen of Fred
Boenseh, Loren FaPrade, Chuck Taylor, and Milt Vucinich.
Taylor blasted two Broncos out of the play and Vucinich swept away
another on the 15. Fawcett rode down the sidelines and carried Higgins
across the goal line with him. Stanford missed another chance to score
when held for four downs inside the aSnta Clara 5. (More tomorrow.)
