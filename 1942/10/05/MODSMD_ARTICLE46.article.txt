The surging St. Louis Cardinals
outslugged the New York Yankees,
yesterday and took a commanding
three games to one lead in the
World Series before 69,902 fans,
largest crowd ever to see a series
game.
The record crowd watched the ir
repressible Cardinals out-hit and
out-play the world champions in the
most thrilling game of the series so
far.
The Yanks broke the scoring ice
in the first inning against fireballer
Mort Cooper with one run on Red
Rolfe's double and Roy Cullenbine's
single.
As Rookie Hank Borowy of the
Yankees. Manager Billy Southworth
nings behind a snapping curve ball,
the one-run lead loomed bigger and
bigger and bigger. But in the fourth,
the tension broke.
Fleet-footed Stan Musial beat out
a bunt to open the fourth. Then
Walker Cooper singled to center, and
Johnny Hopp walked, filling the
bases. Whitey Kurowski drove a
hard single through Red Rolfe into
left field, scoring Musial and Cooper.
The outburst rattled Borowy and
he walked Slats Marion, and then
Mort Cooper singled to right, scor

single knocked Borowy out of the
box, and the Yanks sent in Atley

DiMaggio, Terry Moore singled to
left, scoring Marion. Then Enos
Slaughter rolled out to Gordon,
Cooper moving on to third. Stan
Musial connected with his second hit
of the inning, a rattling double to

right, scoring Mort Cooper with the
sixth run of the inning. Walker
Cooper lined to Joe Gordon to end
the outburst.
With a 6-1 lead, the Cards looked
like sure winners, but they reckoned
without the big Yankee rally in the
fifth which knotted the score.

batting champion of the day, opened
the fifth with a slashing single to
left. Red Rolfe walked. Roy Cullen
bine rammed a single into center,
scoring Rizzuto. After DiMaggio

and took second as Dickey grounded
out to Brown. Then Gerry Priddy
lashed a double deep into the right
field corner, scoring Gordon with
the filth run of the inning, which
tied up the ball game at 6-6.
But the Cards wouldn't be stopped.
They took advantage of Donald's
