### 
Managers of intramural football
teams which wish to enter the
Farm's 1942 race should meet in the
B.A.C. at 7:15 p.m. Tuesday, Harry
Wolter, program director, said yes
terday.
Sign-up slips for entering teams
are already posted in the gym, and
team managers should be selected to
represent their squads, in drawing
up schedules. Already about 20
teams have been entered, with at
least 30 more expected before the
Tuesday deadline.
Organized team practices are
clicking at the more athletically
earnest of the fraternities and clubs.
Along the Row, early practice re
ports spotlight attention on the
Dekes, Alpha Delts, Kappa Sigs,
Zetes, Delts and others whose try
out sessions have been well planned.
Tomorrow the Daily will carry the
first of three articles surveying the
strength of Lower Row, Upper Row,
and Club-Independent Teams.
