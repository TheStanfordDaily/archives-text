# Farm Women Begin Course In Engineering
## No Tuition Charged; Graduates Do Well, Employers Report 
### 
Invading another traditionally
masculine field, Stanford women
begin today to learn drafting and
technical calculations, as the Uni
versity opens its second women's
engineering course, with classes
scheduled both on the campus and
in San Francisco.
A total of 40 women engineers are
to meet classes on the campus, and
the same number in San Francisco
in the Cogswell Polytechnic College
at 26th and Folsom streets.
NO TUITION CHARGED
High school graduation with two
years of mathematics or the equiva
lent are prerequisites for enrollment
in the defense training course, for
which no tuition is charged. The
women are expected to provide their
own books and drawing equipment.
A full year engineering course
will be offered to students who do
exceptionally well in the first quar
ter of the new course, on the basis
of success of summer classes.
GRADUATES SUCCESSFUL
Graduates of the first free 10-
week classes, which ended a month
ago, already are employed in war
plants and industries, Professor Eu
gene L. Grant, director of Stanford's
war training program, declared.
Companies hiring the women engi
neers were said to have found them
to be more careful with detailed
work and more patient than men.
