## 
### 
win the game, Manager Joe Mac-
Carthy brought in Ernie Bonham to
quell the Cards. He retired Hopp
and purposely walked Kurowski to
fill the bases. Slats Marion's long
fly to DiMaggio scored Musial from
third. Pinch-hitter Ray Sanders flied
to Rolfe, retiring the side.
The Cards got their final tally in
the ninth on Pitcher Max Lanier's
single, scoring Hopp who had sin
gled.
It was the same story all over
again for the Yanks. The Cards
were just too fast, too daring, and
put their hits together for runs when
they counted. The old Yankee jinx
ol left-handers appeared again. Max
Lanier, a southpaw, appeared in the
critical relief role and had the world
champions eating out of his hand.
The thundering battle of base hits
brought seven pitchers to the mound.
Of these seven, two relief hurlers,
Howie Pollct of the Cards and Atley
Donald of the Yanks, were credited
with victory and defeat respectively,
although Pollet pitched only one ball
to one batter. The Cards also used
lanky Harry Gumbert in a relief
role.
With a 3-1 lead in the series, the
Cards need only one more game to
dethrone the World Champion
Yankees skept along for three in
will start rookie Johnny Beazley,
who won the second game, against
the Yanks today. MacCarthy will
use Red Ruffing, who almost had a
no-hitter against the Cards in the
first game in St. Louis.
