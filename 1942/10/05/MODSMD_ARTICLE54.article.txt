# Engineers and Chaucer
## 
### 
EVEN before the war, the cry for specializa
tion arose and we narrowed the scope of
our college course accordingly. Now, more
than before we must specialize. We must learn
Engineering, and Chemistry, and Physics. The
lower division requirements for Engineering
students have been lowered until now only
one year of history and two quarters of Eng
lish are required.
In a way this defeats the purpose of college
and especially the lower division. The first
two years were once conceived as years for
spreading out—for dabbling into lots of new
things and getting fresh ideas. Years for the
English majors to take Biology, and for the En
gineers to take Spanish or French, and for the
Journalists to take Philosophy.
Today we cannot afford the time for this older
concept of education. Time is too short for
the mathematician to learn Chaucer's Middle
English or the good things in Shakespeare.
Even now we are going to college on borrowed
time. The nation doesn't have enough laborers
to pick fruit, to weld tankers or file cards—let
alone enough men to fly planes, shoot guns
or navigate destroyers.
However, there is a way that we can spe
cialize down to a fine point, push through col
lege as fast as possible, and still glean some of
the joys and benefits of a broad general edu
cation.
We can audit courses that happen to come at
our free periods. Rather than sitting in the sun
or going to the Cellar at 10 o'clock, we could
find a course that interests us, ask the profes
sor's permission to listen, and attend it regu
larly.
Nothing but interest will hold us there. If we
find the time, we could do some of the reading
and enlarge the benefits of the course. If hard
pressed in other courses, we can neglect the
reading and just sit and listen to some of Amer
ica's great men discuss their own particular
fields.
Stanford with its many departments and fine
professors offers limitless opportunities for
broadening our interests and getting new ideas.
Auditing is a way that this can be achieved
without sacrificing valuable units of specialized
training.—Al Hampson
