# Second Front
## 
### 
SINCE Hitler struck at Russia over a year ago,
the favorite topic of armchair strategists
has been the second front. More popular pres
sure and public opinion has influenced the
second front decision than any other similar
military decision in history.
Yet the decision regarding the second front
has already been made, probably many months
ago, by Anglo-American military strategists in
London. Their decision probably boils down
to this:
They realize that the second front in Europe
is necessary to knock out Germany. But they
know that the launching of a second front—a
full-fledged invasion of the continent —will be
the largest single military operation in history.
They know that if the second front succeeds,
we will probably win the war; if the second
front fails, we will probably lose it.
For this reason they must make sure of suc
cess before they launch their invasion. The
Dieppe raid disclosed the high rate of casualties
which will undoubtedly attend a real invasion
of the French coast. So the strategists have
probably come to this decision regarding the
time of invasion: It must be held off as long as
possible, or until fully adequate preparations
can be made, so there will be a minimum
chance of failure.
But the strategists realize that Russia is the
key to the war on the Eurasian land mass. If
the situation in Russia demands a second front
before full preparations are completed, then that
second front must be launched to save Russia.
For the whole Allied strategy of war depends
on keeping Russia fighting.
So the very absence of a second front to date
means just one thing: The Anglo-American
strategists are convinced Russia will hold
through this winter. It is apparent that the Battle
of Stalingrad is the reason behind this decision.
The heroic Russian defense of the Volga city

has completely destroyed Nazi hopes of reach
ing the "Archangel to Astrakhan" line by win
ter.
Hitler's message to the German people last
week was the tip-off on Nazi strategy. The Ger
mans intend to sit and wait for the blow to strike,
for they hope to turn the second front into an
other Dunkirk and follow it with an invasion
of Britain.
With the falling of snow in the Caucasus, the
initiative passes into the hands of the United
Nations. Hitler must spend the winter in Russia,
Stalingrad or no Stalingrad. When spring, 1943,
breaks over Europe, the second front must be
launched. It must be ready by that time, for any
further delay would be treason. Charlie Allen
