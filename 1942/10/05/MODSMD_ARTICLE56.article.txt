### TED NORTON 
BOTTLENECK ISO. 1
As he has demonstrated time and again, Presi
dent Roosevelt will not delegate authority. He in
sists on keeping a directing finger in every gov
ernment pie, regardless of the fact that figura
tivley and literally he has only ten fingers.
1 refer, of course, to the appointment of Justice
By rnes as "director of economic stabilization.*' in
the first place, he is no "czar" nor, in the second,
is he in charge of any unified administration. He
is one of the President's aides in the Office for
Emergency Management, a loose grouping of all the
new war offices, a position only slightly more ele
vated than that of presidential "legman"' Admiral
Leahy. There has been no reorganization of the
present conflicting agencies; its only effect is to
impose another layer of authority over and above
such agencies as the War Labor Board, the OPA,
etc.
Perhaps I have presented a slightly exaggerated
picture. The appointment is an advance in the
sense that there is now an arbitrator between the
formerly independent economic agencies, and a
central office charged with the formulation of
economic policy. But President Roosevelt bad an
opportunity, upon the passing of the anti-inflation
bill last week, to set up such an economic high
command as would have simplified the patchwork
of economic offices in Washington and improved
their efficiency and the efficiency of the war effort.
And he failed conspicuously to do so.
