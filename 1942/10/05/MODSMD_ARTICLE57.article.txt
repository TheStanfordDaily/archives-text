# BULL SESSION
## 
### H. D. Thoreau 
Last Friday night an attempt was made to bridle
one of the freedoms that we Americans love so
well. Right here on this campus, force was used in
an attempt to intimidate one of those gentlemen
of the fourth estate, a defender of the right of the
freedom of the press.
This lad was hitch-hiking down Lasuen in his
best Frid ay night suit, when a hot-iron full of Pi
Phi's stopped and dragged him into its midst.
Seeing who he was, they commenced to put half
hitches in his cravat, muss his best Friday night
suit, tweek his ears, and head off toward the Oke
phenoke Swamp where they intended to leave him
to his fate.
Now what had this lender slip of a lad done
to those great big awful girls?
He had been to a student government meeting
at which two of their number were present. He had
reported the affair in his column the next day in
an honest, straightforward manner. His only men
tion of the girls had been, "The nice blondes (Pi
Phi" s someone called 'em) voted for a rally. . . .
And this trio gathered several others behind it to
put the big rah-rah across."
Those are the words Bill Sleif wrote that made
an entire sorority house rise as a body and set out
to hunt him down and do him bodily harm, as a
lesson to other guardians of the press who might
come after him and seek to print the truth.
I'm going hitch-hiking tonight.
