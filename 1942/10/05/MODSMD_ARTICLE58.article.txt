BLOOD BANK

The Editor, Sir:
Yesterday there was an instructive little incident
at the Comm inity Center, where the people of the
Blood Bank j/roup were doing their usual excellent
work. During the preliminaries one of the donors
was heard to state that it was her first time. "Shame
on you! ' said a Gray Lady, merrily. "You could
have given three times by now. Ihe donor seemed
confused and made various excuses.
It may be thought that the Gray Lady was un
kind and that she should have praised more highly
this great and terrible sacrifice of a single pint of
blood. The donor did come once, which is more
than can be said of most of our patriots.
The Bank can never have enough plasma for
America's millions of fighting men. It look eleven
quarts of the stuff to save a Pearl Harbor casually
who was literally a mass of wounds. It saved him.
I said the Bank could never have enough, but it
could if all of our healthy civilians (all of those
fortunate enough to be hear a Center) would go
again and again, five times a year, as long as the
war lasts. It doesn't hurt, but suppose it did? It
hurts to be shot! It doesn't weaken you, but sup
pose it did? It's more weakening to be burned or
gassed!
