# U.S. Army Aircraft Superior To Axis Planes, Says Report
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (UP).—
U.S. Army planes, with a record of
only one loss to seven for the enemy
during a recent 30-day combat pe
riod, are "more than a match" for
any opposing military aircraft, a
House military affairs subcommittee
reported tonight after a two-week
investigation.
The report praised the perform
ance of U.S. bombers and flatly re
jected charges that American fighter
planes are inferior to those of Ger
many, Italy, or Japan, declaring that
"in the final analysis, it is the box
score that counts.
PLANE VS. PLANE INVALID
"It is idle," the report said, to
compare the speed, performance and
maneuverability of one plane against
another when engaged in war.
"It is only common sense to say
that our planes and our pilots are
performing exceptionally well when
they are knocking down two or three
enemy planes to every one of ours
that is lost."
Reports from the nine fighting
fronts where American planes and
crews are in action, the report said,
show that U.S.-built bombers have
set an "outstanding record" and
that American fighters have splen
did combat qualities.
AMERICANS MAY BE PROUD
Asserting that Army Air Force
officials are "fully alert" to make
any design changes shown necessary
by experience, it said the American
people "may be justly proud of the
record of their air forces, their
achievements and their will to bring
this war to a speedy and successful
conclusion."

The subcommittee, headed by Rep.
Dow Harter, D., 0., had high praise
for the Army's B-17 Flying Fort
ress and other bombers, declaring
their performance was so impres
sive that "little need be said since
their record today has been so out
standing as to silence criticism."
"The B-17 continues today to be
the fastest high - altitude, long
range bomber in production in the
world," it continued. "Its record of
deefnsive combat demonstrates that
it is the most heavily armed bomber
in current operations."
CRITIQUE OF THE ZERO
Turning to charges that the Jap
Zero fighter is superior to the Bell
P-39 Aircobra and the Curtiss P-40
Tomahawk, the report said:
"The Zero is an excellent flying
machine and a relatively poor fight
ing machine. . . . The Zero has
certain better flying characteristics
(such as faster climb, higher ceil
ing and greater maneuverability)
but the P-40 has a number of better
fighting characteristics (greater fire
power, heavy armor, leak-proof
tanks, higher speed and greater div
ing ability) which make it effective
against the Zero."

against the Zero."
WASHINGTON, Oct. 4 (UP).—
U.S. Army planes, with a record of
only one loss to seven for the enemy
during a recent 30-day combat pe
riod, are "more than a match" for
any opposing military aircraft, a
House military affairs subcommittee
reported tonight after a two-week
investigation.
The report praised the perform
ance of U.S. bombers and flatly re
jected charges that American fighter
planes are inferior to those of Ger
many, Italy, or Japan, declaring that
"in the final analysis, it is the box
score that counts.
PLANE VS. PLANE INVALID
"It is idle," the report said, to
compare the speed, performance and
maneuverability of one plane against
another when engaged in war.
"It is only common sense to say
that our planes and our pilots are
performing exceptionally well when
they are knocking down two or three
enemy planes to every one of ours
that is lost."
Reports from the nine fighting
fronts where American planes and
crews are in action, the report said,
show that U.S.-built bombers have
set an "outstanding record" and
that American fighters have splen
did combat qualities.
AMERICANS MAY BE PROUD
Asserting that Army Air Force
officials are "fully alert" to make
any design changes shown necessary
by experience, it said the American
people "may be justly proud of the
record of their air forces, their
achievements and their will to bring
this war to a speedy and successful
conclusion."

The subcommittee, headed by Rep.
Dow Harter, D., 0., had high praise
for the Army's B-17 Flying Fort
ress and other bombers, declaring
their performance was so impres
sive that "little need be said since
their record today has been so out
standing as to silence criticism."
"The B-17 continues today to be
the fastest high - altitude, long
range bomber in production in the
world," it continued. "Its record of
deefnsive combat demonstrates that
it is the most heavily armed bomber
in current operations."
CRITIQUE OF THE ZERO
Turning to charges that the Jap
Zero fighter is superior to the Bell
P-39 Aircobra and the Curtiss P-40
Tomahawk, the report said:
"The Zero is an excellent flying
machine and a relatively poor fight
ing machine. . . . The Zero has
certain better flying characteristics
(such as faster climb, higher ceil
ing and greater maneuverability)
but the P-40 has a number of better
fighting characteristics (greater fire
power, heavy armor, leak-proof
tanks, higher speed and greater div
ing ability) which make it effective
against the Zero."
