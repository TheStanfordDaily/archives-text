# Service Seeks New Speakers
## Members To Address Neighboring Groups 
### 
Stanford Speakers' Service, a
unique organization which furnishes
a wide variety of student speakers
and topics to organizations in
neighboring vicinities, is looking for
new members to include on its 1942-
43 roster.
Any student interested in gaining
speaking experience, addressing pub-
Ik- audiences, and making possible
job contacts is asked to contact Mrs.
Claire Loftus, faculty adviser of the
Speakers' Service, at local 594 or in
Room 209, Memorial Auditorium, or
Jim Kessler, who was recently ap
pointed student manager of the
service.
SERVICE GIVES CREDIT
Besides offering valuable experi
ence, students may enroll in the
service for either 1 or 2 units. They
are given individual training by Mrs.
Loftus, and there are no prerequi
sites.
The Speakers' Service has made
considerable progress in the past
year towards establishing itself as a
reliable, convenient agency for the
Peninsula, community, and campus.
Stanford student speakers have
visited schools, men's and women's
organizations, service clubs, and
church groups, and they have
spoken on a variety of subjects
ranging from "Bali Interlude" to
"God Under the Swastika" and
"Model T on the Stanford Lawn."
ADDRESSES . 10,000
Despite the change in world af
fairs, the Speakers' Service filled a
total of 178 engagements, addressing
over 10.000 persons in 1941-42. This
is significant in revealing the suc
cess of the organization even after
war conditions caused difficulties in
transportation, the discontinuing of
program entertainment, and constant
revision of the original roster to
meet new demands.
All students who joined the
Speakers' Service have filled public
engagements, and the personnel in
cludes representatives from 12 de
partments of study. Members have
all been outstanding scholastic and
activity leaders, being members of
Phi Beta Kappa, class officers, and
living group presidents.
