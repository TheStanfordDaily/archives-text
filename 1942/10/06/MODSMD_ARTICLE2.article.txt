# Turkish Ali Kefeli Declares People Ready to Fight Nazis
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Today Turkey stands athwart a
potential Nazi thrust into the oil
riches of Iran, and while Hitler is
stalled at Stalingrad, Turkey is
sharpening her sword. Any rumors
of Turkish collaboration with the
Axis are hotly denied by Ali Kefeli,
who left Istanbul for America in
February.
TURKS WILL NOT KNEEL
"With an army 2 ] /2 million strong,
the Turks are ready to fight. They
have seen France fall . . . and then
the Balkans. They will not kneel
before any invader—not until they
have fought to the last man." Ali lit
a pipe he bought in Baghdad and
pointed to a picture of President
Kemal. "There is the man who mod
ernized Turkey and taught her to
love peace. During his 20 years in
office, he changed Turkey. He knew
war would come someday and that
Turkey might have to fight for its
life. That is why he put every school
boy through a year's military train
ing. We have laid great faith in our
new army and the Turks today have
absolute confidence in their leaders
at Ankara . . . they support every
policy.

"We have had wars with Russia
and have been historic competitors in
the Black Sea. But we know that as
long as the Russians hold the Nazis,
so long will our neutrality be se
cure. And the British — they have
been our friends since the Crimean
War. That is why today my people
are hoping for Germany's defeat.
EGYPT WANTS FREEDOM
"But it is different in Egypt." Ali
commented after visiting Cairo and
Alexandria en route to the States.
"The Arabic peoples are similar to
the Indians in attitude. They have
long borne grudges against English
intrusion and want their freedom."

Ali's ship, "El Nil," lay in dock at
Alexandria when Rommel staged a
daybreak raid. From a porthole, he
saw a heavy bomber downed by ack
ack fire after it dumped a bomb 20
feet away, and witnessed machine
gunning Stukas swoop over the
streets. British fighters took after
the Nazi planes when anti-aircraft
fire subsided.
BARRAGE AT SUEZ
El Nil was unscathed and steamed
on to Port Said, which lay under a
canopy of barrage balloons, and

passed between concrete fortifica
tions of the Suez. From there it was
a relatively uneventful voyage
around the Cape. Nevertheless, pas
sengers were required to wear life
belts continually and were given
disaster rehearsals. Lifeboat com
panies were organized, and Ali, who
became a proficient swimmer at Is
tanbul, was put in charge of one
lifeboat company.
The monotony of the journey was
relieved when they crossed the equa
tor. Dressed in women's clothes,
apropos for the frivolous occasion,
Ali was voted the most "ridiculous"
and was promptly tossed fully
clothed into the ship's pool, thus be
coming a solemn member of the
"Holy Order of Neptunian aßthers."
Next evening, he entertained the
passengers by doing card tricks on
an amateur show.
At Trinidad. El Nil merged with a
convoy of 15 ships. As they crossed
the Caribbean, a lurking German
sub torpedoed two neighboring mer
chant ships. With a lifeboat crew.
Ali went overboard and fished out
23 survivors. His next assignment
came five hours later when a drunk
toppled over the railing, and was
pulled from the brine by the 22-
year-old Turk.
DROVE PACKARD AT HOME
Arriving in New York. Ali bought
a Ford and drove the last lap to
Stanford. He had learned to drive
a Packard at home.
After four months of travel, Ali
Kefeli arrived at the Farm for two
undergraduate years of mechanical
engineering instruction. He left the
Black Sea February 6, knowing only
the American term "Okay." A fel
low passenger aboard El Nil taught
him a good conversational English.
From Stanford. Ali plans to obtain
his MA at MIT and then return to
Ankara, to embark on a career to
further the modernization program
instigated by the late President
Kemal.
