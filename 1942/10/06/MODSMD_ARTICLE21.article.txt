### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 5 (UP).—
Price Chief Leon Henderson tonight
took the second step toward im
plementing President Roosevelt's
new five-point anti-inflation pro
gram by ordering rentals on dwell
ings in all parts of the nation sta
bilized at levels prevailing last
March 1.

The action, coupled with the
OPA's week-end imposition of price
ceilings on previously uncontrolled
food products, insured the public
against further rises in itwo of the
most important items in the family
budget—food and rents.

Henderson extended the govern
ment's rent control authority to the
entire country by establishing 45
additional defense-rental areas cov
ering each of the states except Con
necticut, Rhode Island and Dela
ware, which previously had been
designated in their entirety.

Officials emphasized that the OPA
will give landlords and other dwell
ing owners 60 days to adjust then
rentals to March 1 levels. At the
expiration of that period on Dcc. 5
the OPA will take control where
necessary.

Tonight's order left these three
fixed points of the President's pro
gram to be acted upon: stabilization
of wages and salnrios; a $25,000 lim
itation on yearly salaries after taxes
and fixed obligations and a general
freezing of salaries in excess of
$5,000; and tighter control of war
profits.
