* Hard to say who felt more fool
ish, Gerry Priddy or Joe Gordon
after the pair missed connections
yesterday and eased the. once- j
champion New York Yankees
into the avvfulest el foldo job they
ever accomplished in a World
Series.
Gordon, who batted .321 for the
regular season and a nifty .095 (that's
right, 2 for 21) for the Series, must
shoulder equally the spilt milk with
Priddy.
The situation: Gordon on second.
Dickey on first, none out in the
ninth with the Yanks behind, 4-2.
Naturally Manager oJe McCarthy
throws on the bunt signal to move
the runners into scoring position.
Priddy watches Beazley and pushes
his bat out to punt. But he misses
the ball cold, doesn't even spoil it
so he might try again.
Gordon, on base for only the
second time in the series, finds
the new ground around second so
thrilling that he wants to look
third over too. So he dashes for
the third base cushion. Looking up
while about halfway there, he sees
Priddy missing the ball and scram-

hies back to second.
But Walker Cooper has the ball
right on his head and Jimmy Brown
tags the Yank second baseman out
before he can say "I wuz robbed."
On the other hand all credit is due
to the St. Louis Cardinals who
wrested the World Series title away
from the American League with the
greatest combination of outfielding,
infielding, pitching, base running,
and clutch hitting we ever heard on
any radio or read about in any paper.
