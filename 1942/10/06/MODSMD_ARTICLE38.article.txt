# BERKELEY TENNIS:

### 
While we listened to the World
Series, Stanford tennis stars did
things in a nice way at the Berkeley
tennis matches over the weekend.
Bob Forbes, a sophomore, teamed
with Art Larsen of California to
annex the Pacific Coast Jr. Doubles
title from Gene Franco and Wally
Smith, another Stanford sophomore.
Ted Myers, also a sophomore, who
lost to Harry Likas in the semi
finals of the Jr. Men's Singles, played
off a long-time postponed match
with Chip Cheney of California and
beat the Bear.
