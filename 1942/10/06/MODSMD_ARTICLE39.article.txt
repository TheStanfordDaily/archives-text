# Cards Blast Yankees, 4-2, Win Series
## 
### 
Those amazing St. Louis Cardinals,
who were 10games behind the
Brooklyn Dodgers August 5, com
pleted the greatest comeback in base
ball history yesterday when they
broke a 2-2 deadlock in the ninth
inning on Whitey Kurowski's homer
to submerge the New York Yankees,
4-2, and win the fifth and deciding
game of the 1942 World Series.
Young Johnny Beazley, who beat
the Cardinals, 4-3, in the second
game of the series, gave out seven
scattered hits while his mates combed
37-year-old Red Ruffing for nine.
The teams rode into the ninth in
ning locked at 2-all. Third baseman
Kurowski smacked Ruffing's third
toss for a four-bagger sending
catcher Walker Cooper home ahead
of him.
OLI> TIME RALLY FAILS
The Yankees, trying valiantly to
stay in the Series, started off a typi
cal, old-time rally in their half of
the ninth as Joe Gordon singled and
Catcher Bill Dickey was safe when
shortstop Jimmy Brown fumbled
what looked like an easy double
play chance.
There they were, Gordon on sec
ond, Dickey roosting on first, and
none out.
Gerry Priddy, playing first base in
place of Buddy Hassett, tried to sac
rifice the runners to second and
third, but he missed the ball, and
Cooper shot it to Marty Marion at
second to nip Gordon, who couldn't
get back in time after his break for
third on the attempted sacrifice.
SELKIRK ROLLS OUT
After Gordon was out, Priddy
lined to Brown and pinch-hitter
George Selkirk grounded out.
Brown to Hopp, to end the ball game
and the Series.
The Yanks held a pne-run lead on
Phil Rizzuto's homer in the first in
ning until the fourth frame when
Enos Slaughter clouted a round
tripper to knot the score.
The Yanks came back again for
another run when Joe DiMaggio
singled Red Rr*lfe across. The Cardi
nals evened the count again in the
sixth when Captain Terry Moore
scored from third on Cooper's long
fly to right.
With the score all tied up again
and the Redbirds erring frequently,
it seemed that the New Yorkers
would open up with an outburst
sooner or later. But the Cards wea
thered their fouj* mis-cues and on
Kurowski's home run handed the
Yankees their worst drubbing in
Series history.
