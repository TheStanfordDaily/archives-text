# Lower Row Gridders Appear As Intramural Football Threat
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
(Following is the first in a series
of articles on the intramural football
teams which will compete in the
1942 season at Stanford. Today's
article is a prospectus of the Lower
Row squadsâ€”Editor's Note.)

Intramural football teams are
manned by every type of character
that a school like Stanford can pro
duce, covering the range of brawn
between Athertonized bruisers who
were supposed to murder our P.C.C.
rivals and just ordinary, run-ol'-the-
Quad lads.
This diversity is the strength of
Stanford's intramural program for a
voluntary sports program thrives
only on student co-operation.
This same diversity is the reason
that mural grid forecasting is an art
with absolutely no foundation.
There are no records of past per
formances. no special inlets to the
"inside," and no reporters who have
the time to cover the practice ses
sions of every group day by day.
Certain pointers are left for us to
scan; (1) some groups always field a
good team for they are habitually
trophy-brained and usually stocked
with one or two maulers; (2) some
teams start organizing earlier, prac
tice more, and (3) some few have
returning players who looked good
last year.

Along Lower Row, the home of
many consistent athletic houses, sev
eral teams will threaten the crown
now worn by the Firehouse.
The DEKES have only one man
missing in a lineup that has had
previous experience all around. Fea
turing Bill Joslyn, an Athertonized
player, the squad will include Dick
McDonough and John Leddy at ends,
Bill Hooper at center, a smart passer.
Jack Clark, at quarter, and Tom
Fuller at fullback, wilh one halfback
spot open. Manager Jack Quinlan
will guide a team with a splendid
mural record behind it, including a
spot in last year's playoffs. Running
attacks are in the offing.
KAPPA SIGMA is grieving for a
team that almost won the race in
1941 when a last-minute field goal
beat them, 9 to 7. But the shoes of
Frank Wells and Jack Harris in the
backfield can't be filled very easily.
The only two starters yet announced
are Manager Johnny Brooks at the
quarterback spot in a T-formation
attack, aided by Carol Bird at full.
A husky sophomore class will help,

but it doesn't look like another run
ner-up here.
At the PHI DELT house, soph
speedsters Johnny Fulton and Bob
Sears will form the nucleus of a fast
team. With other husky ex-Encinans
such as John Thompson, Phil Prince,
and Clem Turner in the line, the
team has at least a solid start. Larry
Dee might get a backfield post if his
eligibility is decided.
ZETA PSI will be led by Manager
Jim Ellis" another varsity-to-be man
that got nipped by conference regu
lations. Co-captains are two ex
perienced ends, Jeff Bromfield and
Jack McDonald. In the other spots,
Dick Miller, A1 Simons, Jerry Roth,
Jack Reynolds, and Pete Paget will
see the most action. There's no Ollie
Hamlin to pass, but there may not
be a Business School jinx this year
either.
The ALPHA DELTS appear to
have entered practice in the most
serious fashion of any house on
Lower Row. Always strong in intra
mural athletics, they will use Pete
Gadd, E. B. Hall, Bob Crary, and
Fred Woodard from last year's team.
Much passing expected from here.
SIGMA CHI
SIGMA CHI will be another sopho
more team, not yet organized. Bob
Boorman, John Smith, and Bob Car
dinal are sure-starting first-year
men, with other spots unfilled. The
DU's are the last of teams who ap
pear the strongest to date. They'll
have Jake McCoy, Lee Peake, Leo
McCaffrey, Bob Silva. and soph Bob
Barsocchini as a nucleus.
The rest don't appear as powerful,
which may make them a sure bet.

KAPPA ALPHA has not started or
ganized practice, but Manager A1
Bacon will use Tom LaCoste. Laurie
Baillard, Rod Finney, and Ward
Cummings. The PHI KAP's have
one of the best passers in the league,
Harry Dyck, with ends Bill Cough
lin and Yehudi to receive for him.
Bruce Cordingly is at center.
EFFICIENT AKL's
The ALPHA KAPPA LAMBDA
team will produce Rog Evans, Dave
Narver, Dick Brown, and another
undecided in the backfield, behind
Harvard Lomax, John Harter, and
Bill Taylor in the line. They have
jumped the gun on others in or
ganizing efficient practice sessions.
The PHI SIGS have Russ Dunlap,
Bud Perry, Doug Jennings, and no
further plans. THETA CHI has a
full team back, but few sophomore
replacements, The ALPHA SIGS,
CHI PSl's, SAE's, and BETA's have
not started yet, but the latter should
produce some fine running plays. So
on the Lower Row, the watchword
is Deke and keep an eye on the
Kappa Sigs, Phi Delts, Zetes, and Al-
I pha Delts.
