# Help Wanted

### 
WITH each quarter the personnel of Stan
ford's really worth-while organizations
changes. Today we are faced with a shortage
of manpower on the Stanford War Board, the
body which is doing more for Stanford's good
standing in the Bay area than any other group.
This quarter has been exceedingly difficult
for the Board. First, Bob Collins, the father and
backbone of the plan, left school for Uncle
Sam's fighting forces. Now Rosemary Cross
doesn't have enough students to help her carry
out a comvplete program.
The War Board is not just another committee.
It entails much work with no glory. Most of
the students who started with the movement
have students who startde with the movement
have stuck with it because they found the work
interesting and worth while.
It s too bad that Stanford can always find
enough people for dance committees, Cardi
nals, and other groups which should be drafted
en masse to carry out this very essential pro
gram.
But it s lots more fun and better for one's pride
to volunteer for a job than to be drafted into it.
So, if you have several hours a week that you
feel are being wasted, why not drop in to Room
13 of the Old Union and see Rosemary and ask
for a job? You won't be turned down because
you haven't been on enough previous com
mittees; in fact you will probably be much
better off if you have never had contact with
Stanford's committee system.
