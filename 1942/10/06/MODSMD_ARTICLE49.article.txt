# The 						Revival

T'HE DAILY has always been a stickler for
the rare old Stanford traditions. We don't
like to see people smoke on the Quad, we like
to see earless students picked up and driven
into Paly, and we like to see upper classmen
wear cords.
We are glad to hear that this year's Senior
Class has decided to revive one of its most
sacred rights, the placing of flowers at the
Mausoleum every Sunday. Of course, this tra
dition derives its sole value from the fact that
we are honoring the founders of our Uni
versity.
We believe that this is reason enough to pull
this discarded tradition out of the ashcan, dust
it off, and put it back into practice.
