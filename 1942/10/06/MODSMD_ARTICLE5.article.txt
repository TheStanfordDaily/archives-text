# Stump Drive Sets First Day's Quota
## 
### 
An intensified drive to sell War
Bonds and Stamps on the Stanford
campus begins tomorrow for the
Autumn Quarter, with students
asked to invest 10 per cent of their
total savings in government securi
ties every Wednesday.
Hall and Row representatives are
leading in the attempt to secure to
morrow's quota of $1500, an average
of 50 cents a student, with Nancy
Pelton as acting chairman.
Men and women are asked to buy
stamps from representatives in their
living groups, or to report to them
purchases made at other sales
agencies.
One representative for the stamp
drive has been named for each
fraternity or sorority house and for
each hall corridor. Diane Holmes
heads sorority representatives, and
Don Shannon fraternity representa
tives.
Committee members will staff
booths for stamp and bond sales on
Wednesdays at the Engineering
Corner 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., at the Eng
lish Corner, the same hours, in the
Cellar from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m., and in
the Library from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
The book store, post office, and
Cellar store sell stamps and bonds
throughout the week. Faculty mem
bers as well as undergraduates are
expected to invest heavily in the
stamp drive. Total investments for
each living group will be published
in the Daily.
Miss Pelton urges the participation
of all students in investing an
amount unimportant to them but
vital in buying war materials to sup
port brothers and friends at the
front.
