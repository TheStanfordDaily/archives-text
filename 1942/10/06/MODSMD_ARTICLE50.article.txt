WITH Stanford's traveling football team yes
terday went A1 Masters, director of the
Stanford Civilian Defense plan. Masters has
an important job on the trip as official repre
sentative of the University. He has an equally
important job here at Stanford as director of
defense.
We wonder if the University made a wise
move in sending its ace co-ordinator, the man
who had the nerve last Wednesday to tell the
various heads of Civilian Defense committees
that their work was not progressing rapidly
enough for safety's sake, to South Bend.
Masters' office work will be handled by his
secretary, but we believe Stanford needs a cen
tral executive here all of the time to direct this
very essential job of Civilian Defense.
Wouldn t it be worth the University's time 1
and money to hire a full-time man to handle the
work Mr. Masters has been doing so capably? !
It would be necessary to get a man with as
much fire and as much ability as Masters who
wouldn t be burdened with other responsi- i
bilities.
We only hope that Stanford will not be
threatened with an air attack very soon, for we j
believe that many of the heads of the various j

committees would find themselves without
jobs, for Stanford would be a heap of ashes.
We can t afford to wait around for the organi
zation to gain momentum. Granted that we
have a unigue problem at Stanford because
most of the manpower is composed of students,
we still hold that a man with a single responsi
bility—the defense of the Stanford campus
from attack by air—could have pushed the pro
gram ahead and had everything in readiness
for "come what may."
As Mr. Masters said last night before leaving,
if this program isn't speeded up, "someone is
going to get hurt."
