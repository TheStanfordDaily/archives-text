# BULL SESSION

### Bill Steif 
\esterday afternoon I went down to \isit a man
who is in what people call the "autumn of life.*'
Ihe man's name is Edward Maslin I Inline.
I hat probably doesn't mean much to most of you
unless you have happened to have had Lynn White's
course in Renaissance and Reformation. If you
have had Professor While's course the name may
slir a memory, for this man, Hulme, was the fellow
who wrote the textbook that White uses.
Well, I went down to Palo Alto where Hulme
lives expecting to find a slightly doddering old man.
But Hulme fooled me.
Hulme fooled me because, though he is well past
the 70-mark and a little gouty, he is as mentally
spry as a freshman—and knows a very lot more.
Hulme, you see, is a Stanford man. In fact, he
is practically one of Stanford's original men.
He entered Stanford, as far as I could gather,
in the fall of I<>92. He had been born in London
and had quit school at the age of 10, as he puts
it, "just when they were beginning to teach us
decimals." He worked and then, with his family,
came to the New World, settling first in Little
Rock, Ark., and then heading west to Portland. In
Portland he was working as a shipping clerk and
doing dramatic reviews on the side when a man
came up to him and asked him if he would like
to go to a new school in California. Hulme pro
tested that he had never been to high school, but
the man said "that doesn't make any difference."
And so Edward Maslin Hulme came to the Farm.
1 here was no tuition at Stanford in those days
and hashing jobs were easy to get I the spirit which
had prompted Senator Stanford to write in his last
letter to David Starr Jordan that he wanted "poor
boys as well as rich boys given a chance al Stan
ford"' was still very much alive in those days), but
it took Hulme five years to gel through school. This
was because he had to make up his high school
credits.
He knew Herbert Hoover and Ray Lyman Wil
bur quite well and says of Hoover, "he was a quiet
young man—almost speechless, one might say."
And to Stanford's present Chancellor he attributes
"a great amount of ability, despite certain narrow
nesses."
Then came two years of graduate work from
which the man who had never had a high school
education emerged a Ph.D. This was followed by
several years of teaching in a Portland high school
and then a 19-year tenure at the University of
Idaho. It was in this early period of Hulme's life
at Idaho that he produced Renaissance Mid Refor
mation—the book that Lynn White still uses—and
it was also in this period that Hulme came to be
recognized as an outstanding scholar in the field of
the Middle Ages and the Renaissance.
One of the good man's most vivid recollections
about his years at Idaho concerns the late Senator
William Borah. It seems that Borah gave Hulme.
who was also debate coach at the university, 50
dollars every year to purchase debate books. One
year, however, Hulme badly needed a book on
Botticelli which cost almost 50 dollars for some
work he was doing—and so he bought it with
Borah's cash. Hulme remarks of the incident that
"Borah probably thought Botticelli was some sort
of Italian cheese—like gorgonzola."
Finally, in 1921. Dr. Hulme got the call to come
back to his alma mater and here he stayed, except
for sabbaticals and summers spent traveling in
Europe, mi ill his retirement in 193 c*. He then went
up to Portland to teach al the Oregon extension
school, but last spring lie came back to Palo Alto—
for good, perhaps.
Bui just because il looks as if Dr. Hulme's active
academic life is through doesn't mean that he is
through thinking. As a mailer of fact, that seems
to be the farthest thing from his mind. The Oxford
Press just brought out a little book of his called
"History and Its Neighbors" which Dr. Hulme, il
seems, thinks is the best work he has done, for in il
he neatly proves (to his satisfaction I thai history,
far from being a science, is essentially an ail with
only a spice of scientific method. To him "history
is the story <>f all the essential thoughts and deeds
of men." And speaking of history, he said he was
hopeful that because Roosevelt's turn of mind is
more practical than Wilson's we may see a good and
lasting peace, for he is "quite assured thai we shall
win the war."
Tall, heavily built, and with hair that is not yet
gray, Edward Maslin Hulme's viewpoint is always
toward the fulure. to the what-will-be. not the what
might-have-been. His blue eyes gleam a little when
he talks of the "next book or the next trip. 11 is
words about his early days as a poor and unedu
cated boy lire not bitter—they are only wise and
tinged with humor.
And when I walked back toward the campus in
the hazy autumn sun and watched the leaves drop
ping from the trees, autumn look on a little different
meaning for me.
