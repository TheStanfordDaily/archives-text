# Brasher Given Double Office
## 
### 
Mir Brasher, vice president of
Women's Conference, will also serve
as secretary this quarter since Nancy
Dole has a lab that conflicts with the
new meeting time of the group,
President Lucy Terrell announced
yesterday at a session in the Wom
en's Clubhouse.

Elected as members of the con
ference committee on social regula
tions were Joan Hill, Sue Stevens,
Betty Lee Luhnow, and Chris
Moody. They, together with Ruth
Atkins and Miss Terrell, will meet
today at 4 p.m. to discuss the adap
tation of regulations to changed
wartime conditions.

Miss Atkins, council chairman,
urged Conference members to stress
to their living groups the necessity
of old students setting an example in
observance of the honor code. She
said that the chief failure was in
students not assuming responsibility
for seeing that others observed it.
Council hours for this quarter will
be Monday and Wednesday from 1
to 2 p.m., she announced.

A.S.S.U. social regulations were
revived by Les Langnecker, who
asked that living groups apply for
dates at least three weeks before the
event and reminded them of the
present policy banning off campus
parties and name bands.

In a report on student harvesting
activities, Janet McClanahan out
lined the procedure for signing up
workers and arranging for transpor
tation and food.
