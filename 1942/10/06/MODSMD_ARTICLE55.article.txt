# 'The Raft' Portrays Heroism Of Three U.S. Naval Fliers
## 
### 
"The Raft" by Robert Trumbull
(Henry Holt and Company), now on
sale at The Stanford Bookstore.

Early this year American news
papers carried a short account of
three navy fliers who desperately
fought the Pacific for 34 days in a
rubber raft, minus food, water, in
struments, and, towards the end of
(heir 1000-mile voyage, without
clothing.

Harold Dixon, chief petty officer
md spokesman for the trio, was
awarded the Navy Cross for "ex
traordinary heroism, exceptional de
termination, resourcefulness, skilled
seamanship, excellent judgment, and
highest quality of leadership." But
even these words are hardly ade
quate.
CRASH IN PACIFIC
Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Tony
Pastula, struggled into their clumsy
rubber raft after their scout bomber
from a carrier prowling the far
South Pacific hit the choppy sea.
But the raft, Bx4-feet over all,
turned over easily in the heavy Pa
cific swells, and they'd soon lost all
equipment except a pocket knife, a
pair of pliers, and an automatic pis
tol that soon became useless from
corrosion, and a length of line.
A series of ingenious makeshilis
enabled Dixon to guide the fabric
craft. They pulled their food from
the air and sea, and before they lost
their clothing, they were able to
catch drinking water by soaking
their rags when it rained.
Yet they survived to land, spent
and weak, on a strange shore. The
trio, proud and courageous to the
last, made a feeble attempt to march
up the beach in military fashion. "If
there are Japs on this island, they'll
not see an American sailor crawl.
We'll stand and march, and make
them shoot us down," Dixon com
manded his companions.
But he had made the raft go where

lie wanted and had brought his men
through.
In Honolulu he told the story to
Robert Trumbull, experienced news
paperman who was close to the fliers
during their long convalescence.
Trumbull has told the story in sim
ple terms and brief form, just as !
Dixon told it to him.—Glasson.

But he had made the raft go where

lie wanted and had brought his men
through.
In Honolulu he told the story to
Robert Trumbull, experienced news
paperman who was close to the fliers
during their long convalescence.
Trumbull has told the story in sim
ple terms and brief form, just as !
Dixon told it to him.—Glasson.
"The Raft" by Robert Trumbull
(Henry Holt and Company), now on
sale at The Stanford Bookstore.

Early this year American news
papers carried a short account of
three navy fliers who desperately
fought the Pacific for 34 days in a
rubber raft, minus food, water, in
struments, and, towards the end of
(heir 1000-mile voyage, without
clothing.

Harold Dixon, chief petty officer
md spokesman for the trio, was
awarded the Navy Cross for "ex
traordinary heroism, exceptional de
termination, resourcefulness, skilled
seamanship, excellent judgment, and
highest quality of leadership." But
even these words are hardly ade
quate.
CRASH IN PACIFIC
Dixon, Gene Aldrich, and Tony
Pastula, struggled into their clumsy
rubber raft after their scout bomber
from a carrier prowling the far
South Pacific hit the choppy sea.
But the raft, Bx4-feet over all,
turned over easily in the heavy Pa
cific swells, and they'd soon lost all
equipment except a pocket knife, a
pair of pliers, and an automatic pis
tol that soon became useless from
corrosion, and a length of line.
A series of ingenious makeshilis
enabled Dixon to guide the fabric
craft. They pulled their food from
the air and sea, and before they lost
their clothing, they were able to
catch drinking water by soaking
their rags when it rained.
Yet they survived to land, spent
and weak, on a strange shore. The
trio, proud and courageous to the
last, made a feeble attempt to march
up the beach in military fashion. "If
there are Japs on this island, they'll
not see an American sailor crawl.
We'll stand and march, and make
them shoot us down," Dixon com
manded his companions.

lie wanted and had brought his men
