# War Talks To Open Fall Symposiums
## Five Professors Fell War Causes, Results At Meeting Tonight 
### BOB FISHER 
Tonight at 7:30 the Tuesday Eve
ning Series will open its fall quarter
urogram in Memorial Hall with a
symposium by five Stanford pro
fessors on the subject "The War:
The Longer View."
Each speaker will deal with one
phase of the problem in a brief talk.
At the end of the program there will
be opportunity for discussion from
the audience, and a chance to ques
ion the speakers. The whole pro
gram should not take much more
than an hour.
Professor Philip W. Buck of the
political science department will
open the symposium with a discus
sion of the agencies of world gov
ernment that have already been
developed by the two conflicting
powers.
TWO OPPOSING PLANS
According to Professor Buck, the
struggle over how the world shall be
organized after the smoke will have
cleared away is one of the principal
conflicts of the war. Each side has
h plan; which shall prevail? The
outcome of the war will determine
this vital question.
The second speaker will be Harold
H. Fisher, professor of History, whose
subject is "What are sufficient
causes, as seen by the peoples of the
various nations, for fighting a long
war?"
CREATIVE FORCES
Dr. Fisher states that it is some
times difficult to see that "among
the things being shattered and swept
away in this world-wide struggle
are some that we can afford to lose.
These are the barriers which confine
the creative forces of our age."
He adds that "we should distin
guish between the creative and de
structive forces, and shape our war
and peace policies accordingly."
MUMFORD SPEAKS THIRD
Next Lewis Mumford, professor of
Humanities, will deal with the sub
ject, "Why is this crisis of 30 years'
standing spiritual rather than politi
cal?"
Dr. Mumford will attempt to show
that society has slipped backward
during this time, and will show how
problems of this war can be traced
back to 1912.
CENTURY OF EFFORT
He warns that this time there will
be no swift and easy peace. Empha
sizing that "there is no past behind
us that is worth returning to," Pro
fessor Mumford states that it will
take at least a century of steady, de
termined effort to work out a last
ing peace.
The fourth speaker will be Pro
fessor Lynn T. White of the History
Department who will attempt to
answer the question "Does history
move on toward a world order as the
goal of this conflict?" He will at
tempt to prove that "the present war
is the final phase of the struggle for
the political unification of mankind
which goes all the way back to the
stone age."
The final speech on the program
will be given by Dr. Karl Brandt of
the Food Research institute. He will
attempt to answer the questions,
"How can nationalism survive a long
war.'" and "What is the economic
endurance of the participants?"
EFFECT OF DURATION
He will bring out the erosive ef
fect of the long duration of the war
upon previously existing economic,
social, and political structures in
Europe and Asia. H<e will also an
alyze the possibilities of building the
peace according to prewar patterns
and discuss other alternative plans.
This speech will conclude the
formal part of the program. The
remaining time will be given over
to student participation.

This symposium is just another
one of the ways by which Stanford
is attempting to bring the war closer
to the students. The Tuesday Eve

Public Exercises Committee.

phase of the problem in a brief talk.
At the end of the program there will
be opportunity for discussion from
the audience, and a chance to ques
ion the speakers. The whole pro
gram should not take much more
than an hour.
Professor Philip W. Buck of the
political science department will
open the symposium with a discus
sion of the agencies of world gov
ernment that have already been
developed by the two conflicting
powers.
TWO OPPOSING PLANS
According to Professor Buck, the
struggle over how the world shall be
organized after the smoke will have
cleared away is one of the principal
conflicts of the war. Each side has
h plan; which shall prevail? The
outcome of the war will determine
this vital question.
The second speaker will be Harold
H. Fisher, professor of History, whose
subject is "What are sufficient
causes, as seen by the peoples of the
various nations, for fighting a long
war?"
CREATIVE FORCES
Dr. Fisher states that it is some
times difficult to see that "among
the things being shattered and swept
away in this world-wide struggle
are some that we can afford to lose.
These are the barriers which confine
the creative forces of our age."
He adds that "we should distin
guish between the creative and de
structive forces, and shape our war
and peace policies accordingly."
MUMFORD SPEAKS THIRD
Next Lewis Mumford, professor of
Humanities, will deal with the sub
ject, "Why is this crisis of 30 years'
standing spiritual rather than politi
cal?"
Dr. Mumford will attempt to show
that society has slipped backward
during this time, and will show how
problems of this war can be traced
back to 1912.
CENTURY OF EFFORT
He warns that this time there will
be no swift and easy peace. Empha
sizing that "there is no past behind
us that is worth returning to," Pro
fessor Mumford states that it will
take at least a century of steady, de
termined effort to work out a last
ing peace.
The fourth speaker will be Pro
fessor Lynn T. White of the History
Department who will attempt to
answer the question "Does history
move on toward a world order as the
goal of this conflict?" He will at
tempt to prove that "the present war
is the final phase of the struggle for
the political unification of mankind
which goes all the way back to the
stone age."
The final speech on the program
will be given by Dr. Karl Brandt of
the Food Research institute. He will
attempt to answer the questions,
"How can nationalism survive a long
war.'" and "What is the economic
endurance of the participants?"
EFFECT OF DURATION
He will bring out the erosive ef
fect of the long duration of the war
upon previously existing economic,
social, and political structures in
Europe and Asia. H<e will also an
alyze the possibilities of building the
peace according to prewar patterns
and discuss other alternative plans.
This speech will conclude the
formal part of the program. The
remaining time will be given over
to student participation.

This symposium is just another
one of the ways by which Stanford
is attempting to bring the war closer
to the students. The Tuesday Eve
ning Series is sponsored by the
Public Exercises Committee.
Tonight at 7:30 the Tuesday Eve
ning Series will open its fall quarter

symposium by five Stanford pro
fessors on the subject "The War:
The Longer View."
