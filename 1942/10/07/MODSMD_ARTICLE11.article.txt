# Autumn War Stamp Sales Begin Today
## S.W.B. Goal of $1500 Requires $.50 Average Per Stanford Student 
### 
Today will be the first Autumn
Quarter War Stamp day on the
Stanford campus for the new school
year. The War Funds committee of
the Stanford War Board has set to
day's quota at $1500, which when
reached will represent an average of
50 cents per student.
As has been the practice in past
quarters, stamps and bonds will be
sold from booths on the campus as
well as in all living groups. Booths
on the English and Engineering cor
ners will be open from 8 a.m. until
3 p.m. In the Union Cellar a booth
will be open from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.,
and another in the library will sell
from 8 a.m. to 10 p.m.
New head of sorority War Stamp
representatives is Diane Holmes.
Don Shannon will head fraternity
representatives, taking over the reins
from Bob Hampton who held the job
during the summer. Representatives
have been assigned to sell stamps in
each corridor in the halls.
Acting stamp chairman Nancy
Pelton expressed the belief that if
the students realize the urgency of
the stamp and bond campaign, they
will soon break the stamp sales rec
ord established last quarter.
