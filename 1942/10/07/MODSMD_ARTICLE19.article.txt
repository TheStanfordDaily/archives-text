### KAY SCHWARTZ 
(See Editorial Page 4)
In a desperate plea to Stanford to
keep vital food rolling to the Allied
armies, a nearby cannery last night
called on every Stanford man to
work several hours each week to
help allay the labor shortage which
threatens to halt production.
Moving swiftly to co-operate with
this plea from the Mountain View
Supply Co., the Stanford War Board
this morning posted a work sched
ule sheet in the Union Cellar. Thirty
Stanford men are needed for every
two-hour shift throughout the day
and night, seven days a week. They
will be paid 73 cents an hour.
Heartily endorsing the program,
Dean John Bunn emphasized that
students should budget their time
so that they may work one of the
shifts with no loss to their studies.
Men enlisted in the reserve corps of
the Army, Navy, and Marines arc
urged to take advantage of this op
portunity to actively assist their
comrades in the fighting lines.
FREE TRANSPORTATION
The schedule of shifts begins each
morning at 8 and continues through
out the day at two-hour intervals,
according to the cannery, so that
each student can go down and work
whenever he has the free time.
Arranging for transportation, the
Mountain View Co. has placed two
station wagons at the disposal of the
students which will make regular
trips between the campus and the
cannery.
Stanford sorority women are being
asked to cook their own dinners
once a week so that their hashers
may work those hours in the can
nery.
WEEKEND SHIFTS
In their house meetings next Mon
day, Row women will vote on the
set night each week hashers will be
released from their regular duties to
work the 6 to 8 o'clock shift.
On weekends the cannery has is
sued a special request for men to
work during the night when the
labor shortage is very desperate. It
is suggested that some women's or
ganization on campus supply box
lunches for the men working these
shifts.
IMMEDIATE WORK
Urging Stanford men to sign up
immediately, the Stanford War
Board emphasized that the real
emergency will be in the next two
weeks during which the ripened to
matoes must be packed. The entire
crop is destined for the U.S. govern
ment to supply army camps.
So that the various student or
ganizations on campus may take an
active part in this emergency, the
War Board has suggested that these
organizations volunteer in a body
for the various shifts, particularly
this weekend.

shifts.
IMMEDIATE WORK
Urging Stanford men to sign up
immediately, the Stanford War
Board emphasized that the real
emergency will be in the next two
weeks during which the ripened to
matoes must be packed. The entire
crop is destined for the U.S. govern
ment to supply army camps.
So that the various student or
ganizations on campus may take an
active part in this emergency, the
War Board has suggested that these
organizations volunteer in a body
for the various shifts, particularly
this weekend.

In a desperate plea to Stanford to
keep vital food rolling to the Allied
armies, a nearby cannery last night
called on every Stanford man to
work several hours each week to
help allay the labor shortage which
threatens to halt production.
Moving swiftly to co-operate with
this plea from the Mountain View
Supply Co., the Stanford War Board
this morning posted a work sched
ule sheet in the Union Cellar. Thirty
Stanford men are needed for every
two-hour shift throughout the day
and night, seven days a week. They
will be paid 73 cents an hour.
Heartily endorsing the program,
Dean John Bunn emphasized that
students should budget their time
so that they may work one of the
shifts with no loss to their studies.
Men enlisted in the reserve corps of
the Army, Navy, and Marines arc
urged to take advantage of this op
portunity to actively assist their
comrades in the fighting lines.
FREE TRANSPORTATION
The schedule of shifts begins each
morning at 8 and continues through
out the day at two-hour intervals,
according to the cannery, so that
each student can go down and work
whenever he has the free time.
Arranging for transportation, the
Mountain View Co. has placed two
station wagons at the disposal of the
students which will make regular
trips between the campus and the
cannery.
Stanford sorority women are being
asked to cook their own dinners
once a week so that their hashers
may work those hours in the can
nery.
WEEKEND SHIFTS
In their house meetings next Mon
day, Row women will vote on the
set night each week hashers will be
released from their regular duties to
work the 6 to 8 o'clock shift.
On weekends the cannery has is
sued a special request for men to
work during the night when the
labor shortage is very desperate. It
is suggested that some women's or
ganization on campus supply box
lunches for the men working these
shifts.
