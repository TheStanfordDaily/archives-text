# SABOTAGE CAMPAIGN
## 
### 
STOCKHOLM, Oct. 6 (UP).—The
Germans have proclaimed an emer
gency in central Norway from
Trondheim to the Swedish border
in an attempt to stifle a sabotage
campaign, and Denmark is torn by
rioting between patriots and mem
bers of the Danish "Free Corps" on
leave from Russia, responsible re
ports said tonight.
The Free Corps is composed of
Danes who have volunteered to
fight for the Germans.
(Norwegian quarters in London
called the state of emergency a pos
sible invasion alert, and said it cov
ered Trondheim and 10 other large
political districts in Norway. The
Germans, it was added, had rushed
large S.S. Elite Guard reinforce
ments there and started mass ar
rests to smoke out patriot leaders.)
EMERGENCY INVOKED
Josef Terboven, German commis
sioner in Norway, invoked the emer
gency because "many cases of sabo
tage have occurred lately, imperil
ing the security of the occupation
forces as well as economic produc
tion," the reports said.
A curfew was imposed from 8 p.m.
until 5 a.m., highway travel was re
stricted to daylight hours, train
travel forbidden except for troops,
and "all resistance will be crushed
by armed force."
The Trondheim district Nazi
chief, Rogstad, was said to have been
empowered with full authority to
punish "all attempts to disturb or
der" and all those violating the
emergency regulations were prom
ised immediate courtmartial.
LARGE AREA
The state of emergency extends
through all of the Trondheim dis
trict, the entire Troendelag district
and parts of the Nordland, an area
extending roughly 100 miles south
of Trondheim and 200 miles to the
north and east of Sweden.
(The German super - battleship
Tirpitz and other German warships
have been using Trondheim as a
base and are believed berthed in its
fjord now awaiting a chance to raid
Allied North Cape convoys. The
Trondheim area provides almost
impenetrable natural protection for
the German warships against Allied
attack, but they would be a prize
objective of any sabotage campaign.)

Germans, it was added, had rushed
large S.S. Elite Guard reinforce
ments there and started mass ar
rests to smoke out patriot leaders.)
EMERGENCY INVOKED
Josef Terboven, German commis
sioner in Norway, invoked the emer
gency because "many cases of sabo
tage have occurred lately, imperil
ing the security of the occupation
forces as well as economic produc
tion," the reports said.
A curfew was imposed from 8 p.m.
until 5 a.m., highway travel was re
stricted to daylight hours, train
travel forbidden except for troops,
and "all resistance will be crushed
by armed force."
The Trondheim district Nazi
chief, Rogstad, was said to have been
empowered with full authority to
punish "all attempts to disturb or
der" and all those violating the
emergency regulations were prom
ised immediate courtmartial.
LARGE AREA
The state of emergency extends
through all of the Trondheim dis
trict, the entire Troendelag district
and parts of the Nordland, an area
extending roughly 100 miles south
of Trondheim and 200 miles to the
north and east of Sweden.
(The German super - battleship
Tirpitz and other German warships
have been using Trondheim as a
base and are believed berthed in its
fjord now awaiting a chance to raid
Allied North Cape convoys. The
Trondheim area provides almost
impenetrable natural protection for
the German warships against Allied
attack, but they would be a prize
objective of any sabotage campaign.)
STOCKHOLM, Oct. 6 (UP).—The
Germans have proclaimed an emer
gency in central Norway from
Trondheim to the Swedish border
in an attempt to stifle a sabotage
campaign, and Denmark is torn by
rioting between patriots and mem
bers of the Danish "Free Corps" on
leave from Russia, responsible re
ports said tonight.
The Free Corps is composed of
Danes who have volunteered to
fight for the Germans.
(Norwegian quarters in London
called the state of emergency a pos
sible invasion alert, and said it cov
ered Trondheim and 10 other large
political districts in Norway. The
Germans, it was added, had rushed
large S.S. Elite Guard reinforce
ments there and started mass ar
rests to smoke out patriot leaders.)
