# Four Years Whittling Pays Boathouse Debt
## 
### 
At the last Excom meeting it was
reported that after lour years, the
boathouse debt nears liquidation
And with its final payment, the
boathouse will become a gift to the
University by the Associated Stu
dents, no strings attached.
It all started in '38. when a Life
photographer caught the antiquated
boathouse in the act of falling down
on the job. It literally collapsed into
the seasonal lake as throngs of stu
dents jammed onto a corner of the
pier to mug for the camera.
END OF OLD HOUSE
At the next Excom meeting, Pres
ident "Beebs" Lee suggested con
struction of a new boathouseâ€”the
"boathouse boys" had to have a roof
over their heads. That was October
11, 1938. A few months of budget
haggling and cost estimates by stu
dent manager Tom Killefer and the
tottering boathouse was dragged
away.
A contest was held for new boat
house plans. Two hours before dead
line, Dick Spencer was struck in a
moment of inspiration and submitted
the winning plans on a piece of
wrapping paper.
Construction went ahead, at a cost
of $255, and the ASSU was commit
ted to meet costs on their own. the
BAC having washed its hands of the
project. Twenty-five hundred dol
lars was granted outright from the
ASSU budget and the Cardinals
came through with $154. The re
maining $6fiol was left to student in
genuity.
HIGH FINANCE
Coke machines were installed at
the lakeshore, and on days of the
annual Junior Water Carnival, the
revenue was high. Income from reg
dances was channeled into the boat
house debt. Last week's dance
brought in $201 and whittled the
debt to approximately $110. Thus it
looks as if the final debt payment of
the boathouse will be made on the
fourth anniversary of its conception.
Future reg dance income will be
turned over for boathouse mainte
nance.
Lake Lagunita was drained this
summer,- and newcomers probably
look aghast at the present mud flats.
But with the winter rains, tributary
streams will flow again and by
spring, canoes will again glide criss
cross on Lagunita.
