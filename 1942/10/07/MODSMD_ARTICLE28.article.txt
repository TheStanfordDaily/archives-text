# Sunday Movies To Start Oct. 9
## 
### 
The Sunday Movies Series, now
an established campus institution,
will begin for Autumn Quarter this
week. October 9, under the direction
of Emily Howard.
The Series was the brainchild of
Vice-President Anne Townsend two
years ago, and under the guidance of
a line of distinguished co-eds, par
ticularly Barbara Sadler, the Sunday
night custom has become success
fully entrenched in Farm tradition.
The first picture under the "Ham"
Howard regime will be "Catherine
the Great," starring Elizabeth Berg
ner and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. Short
subjects and a chapter of a serial,
neither selected as yet, will also be
shown.
Showings are in Memorial Audi
torium at 7:15, open for 20 cents to
faculty and students.
