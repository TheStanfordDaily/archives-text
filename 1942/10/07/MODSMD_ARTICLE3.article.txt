# 'This War Is Final Effort to Unite Mankind'
## Stanford Professors Discuss Current War In Tuesday Panel 
### ED CONN 
"This war that is now being fought
all over the world will be the final,
not jvist the semi-final effort to
unite all humankind into a unified
society with a world government,"
spoke Professor Lynn White of the
Stanford History Department last
night at Memorial Theater in the
first of the Tuesday Series this
quarter which was devoted to a
panel of five professors discussing
"The War —The Longer View."
Recounting the historical succes
sion from family to tribe, to cities, to
city states, to states, and finally to

empires as merely "constants" of
history, White claimed that this ;
present war is merely an effort of j
Japan, Italy, and Germany to catch
up with the other nations. White
claimed that a new "variable," the
combustion engine, has knitted this
world so close together that people
will either naturally unite through
fear of annihilation, or will be driven
to it by force. Referring to Dr. Wil
bur's adage, "Gasoline and alcohol
don't mix," White added, "Neither
will the gasoline engine and isola- i
tionism."
BUCK OPENS PANEL
Dr. Phillip Buck of the Political
Science Department opened the
panel, pointing out that two types of j
world economic planning are now
being formed, the forceful con- [
trolled economy of the Fascists, and j
cse co-operation and conciliation of j
the United Nations. The result of
the war will determine which idea {
will prevail.
Emphasizing that we are at the
zenith of our age of mechanization j
which has been unfolding the last
four hundred years, Professor Lewis
Mumford urged that people must be
ready to change the basic funda
mentals of their philosophy of life
if they wish to preserve what is good
in life.
Professor Harold Fisher of the
History Department stated that the
most important cause for fighting
this war facing the common man j
is the preservation of the welfare of
the individual through the use of I
moral and technological discoveries
of this century.
Economics Professor Karl Brandt !
warned of the great problem of re- \
habilitating Europe after three i
years of the Nazi regime which is j
comparable to the changes twenty I
years of Communism wrought in ■
Russia.

claimed that a new "variable," the
combustion engine, has knitted this
world so close together that people
will either naturally unite through
fear of annihilation, or will be driven
to it by force. Referring to Dr. Wil
bur's adage, "Gasoline and alcohol
don't mix," White added, "Neither
will the gasoline engine and isola- i
tionism."
BUCK OPENS PANEL
Dr. Phillip Buck of the Political
Science Department opened the
panel, pointing out that two types of j
world economic planning are now
being formed, the forceful con- [
trolled economy of the Fascists, and j
cse co-operation and conciliation of j
the United Nations. The result of
the war will determine which idea {
will prevail.
Emphasizing that we are at the
zenith of our age of mechanization j
which has been unfolding the last
four hundred years, Professor Lewis
Mumford urged that people must be
ready to change the basic funda
mentals of their philosophy of life
if they wish to preserve what is good
in life.
Professor Harold Fisher of the
History Department stated that the
most important cause for fighting
this war facing the common man j
is the preservation of the welfare of
the individual through the use of I
moral and technological discoveries
of this century.
Economics Professor Karl Brandt !
warned of the great problem of re- \
habilitating Europe after three i
years of the Nazi regime which is j
comparable to the changes twenty I
years of Communism wrought in ■
Russia.

"This war that is now being fought
all over the world will be the final,
not jvist the semi-final effort to
unite all humankind into a unified
society with a world government,"
spoke Professor Lynn White of the
Stanford History Department last
night at Memorial Theater in the
first of the Tuesday Series this
quarter which was devoted to a
panel of five professors discussing
"The War —The Longer View."
Recounting the historical succes
sion from family to tribe, to cities, to
city states, to states, and finally to

empires as merely "constants" of
history, White claimed that this ;
present war is merely an effort of j
Japan, Italy, and Germany to catch
up with the other nations. White
