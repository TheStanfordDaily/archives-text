## 
### 
Sending his team through light
drills for the rest of the week, Coach
Francis Wilcox is polishing the at
tack and defense of the Stanford
Freshmen for their opening game
this Saturday with Menlo Junior
College at 2:30 in the Stadium. Ad
mission is free.
The team boasts of a good solid
line, with ends capable of snagging
the passes of quarterback Jack
Brownson. The backfield, working
from the T-formation, has speed
and weight.
Bill Agnew, 175-pound fullback
from Piedmont, will be out of the
game. In the first scrimmage of the
year, he injured his leg. He returned
to practice Monday, but was dressed
only in a gym suit. His leg should
be completely recovered in time for
the game with the St. Mary's Pre-
Flight B Team, which follows the
Menlo game. Sieve Tish is current
ly holding the fullback spot, and will
give Agnew a good battle for the
position. Homer Hamlin, All-J.A.L.
irom San Jose, is also a strong con
tender for fullback.
SHARP PASSING
Brownson's passes have been sharp
and accurate, and should the speed
of the halfbacks and the brawn of
the hard-crashing fullbacks bog
down, he has good ends in Bob
Lascter, Chet Fowler, Walt Burke,
Bob Rohrer, Frank Wignore and
Frank Heffelfinger. At the present
time Wigmore, Heffelfinger and

Rohrer are the leading candidates.
Brownson comes from Dishman,
| Wash., and was honorary captain of
I two all-star teams of the Central
■ Valley League. Laseter is from New
Trier High School, and lives at Win
netka, 111. Fowler was all-confer
ence for two years from Ashland
High School.

In the halfback positions, at the
present time, Lloyd Merriman and
Mark Heffelfinger are in the start
j ing spots, but closely followed by
Bill McKie, who also plays quarter
back, Redondo Union High School.
Two very outstanding boys are
! fighting for the center position, with
! Dick Flatland having a slight edge
j over Sid Smith. Flatland played for
Polytechnic High School of San
Francisco which took second behind
Lowell in the league standings.
1 Smith is an all-North Bay League
i center from Vallejo.
Bill Hachtan, first-string All
; Eastern last year from Huntington
Park is holding down the left tackle
j position with Russell Taushheck on
the other side of the line. Bob Ber
: ryman, all-conference from South
I Pasadena is also a strong contender.
ACE GUARD
Dick Madigan, for two years all
A.C.A.I, guard from Piedmont and
co-captain and co-optimo winner

Park is holding down the left tackle
j position with Russell Taushheck on
the other side of the line. Bob Ber
: ryman, all-conference from South
I Pasadena is also a strong contender.
ACE GUARD
Dick Madigan, for two years all
A.C.A.I, guard from Piedmont and
co-captain and co-optimo winner
with Agnew, and Ed Gunderson, all
city from Polytechnic High School of
San Francisco, are having little
i trouble with their guard positions.
Sending his team through light
drills for the rest of the week, Coach
Francis Wilcox is polishing the at
tack and defense of the Stanford
Freshmen for their opening game
this Saturday with Menlo Junior
College at 2:30 in the Stadium. Ad
mission is free.
The team boasts of a good solid
line, with ends capable of snagging
the passes of quarterback Jack
Brownson. The backfield, working
from the T-formation, has speed
and weight.
Bill Agnew, 175-pound fullback
from Piedmont, will be out of the
game. In the first scrimmage of the
year, he injured his leg. He returned
to practice Monday, but was dressed
only in a gym suit. His leg should
be completely recovered in time for
the game with the St. Mary's Pre-
Flight B Team, which follows the
Menlo game. Sieve Tish is current
ly holding the fullback spot, and will
give Agnew a good battle for the
position. Homer Hamlin, All-J.A.L.
irom San Jose, is also a strong con
tender for fullback.
SHARP PASSING
Brownson's passes have been sharp
and accurate, and should the speed
of the halfbacks and the brawn of
the hard-crashing fullbacks bog
down, he has good ends in Bob
Lascter, Chet Fowler, Walt Burke,
Bob Rohrer, Frank Wignore and
Frank Heffelfinger. At the present
time Wigmore, Heffelfinger and

Rohrer are the leading candidates.
Brownson comes from Dishman,
| Wash., and was honorary captain of
I two all-star teams of the Central
■ Valley League. Laseter is from New
Trier High School, and lives at Win
netka, 111. Fowler was all-confer
ence for two years from Ashland
High School.
STARTING HALFBACKS
In the halfback positions, at the
present time, Lloyd Merriman and
Mark Heffelfinger are in the start
j ing spots, but closely followed by
Bill McKie, who also plays quarter
back, Redondo Union High School.
Two very outstanding boys are
! fighting for the center position, with
! Dick Flatland having a slight edge
j over Sid Smith. Flatland played for
Polytechnic High School of San
Francisco which took second behind
Lowell in the league standings.
1 Smith is an all-North Bay League
i center from Vallejo.
Bill Hachtan, first-string All
; Eastern last year from Huntington
Park is holding down the left tackle
j position with Russell Taushheck on
the other side of the line. Bob Ber
