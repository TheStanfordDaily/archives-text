# Upper Row Mural Footballers Strong in Passers, Receivers
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
(Editor's Note: This is the second
in a series of three articles survey
ing 1942 intramural football pros
pects on the Farm. Today the Upper
Row is featured.)

From the upper portion of Lasuen
Street, where greater spaces give
more room for practice and several
hills give more muscle on the legs,
Stanford will receive some of its
better 1942 intramural football teams.
Ignoring the fact that the mural
champ for several years has come
from nearer sea level, down by the
Firehouse, the outlook for several of
the hill teams is uniquely rosy. At
least three have full teams back, and
several of them have passers and re
ceivers who have had much experi
ence in snaring thrown objects. This
handy faculty is what wins mural
games.
PHI PSI HOT
Take the case of Phi Kappa Psi.
On the end they have one Howard
Dallmar whose altitude was very
handy last basketball season. Pitch
ing to him will be Keith Pinion who
has a frosh grid letter from 1940 in
his bottom drawer. Mix these with
mural veterans, Bill Weeks, Jim
backfield. The line, composed of
Dallmar, Ralph Kewitt, and Bill
Nourse, another victim of Atherton's
1940 orgy, completes one of the
happiest pictures on the campus.
Also hopeful are the Fijis. Passing
from quarter will be Bill Harms,
the backfield quartet being rounded
out by soph baseballers Bill Brokaw
and Ken Horth, plus Don Dillon.
The line—Frank Tibbetts and Eric
Hauser at ends, and Bob Haffner at
center — furnishes the remainder,
with blocking ability the question
mark here.
At the Delta Tau house, the Card's
best baseball duo, Pitcher Harry
Mason and Catcher Ward Walkup,
appear in the grid backfield. Art
Matthews, a sharp blocker, and A1
Harris of the soph class will play in
the backfield, with Dwayne Zamzow,
Pete Bosche, and Shelly Parker in
the line. Their practice has been well
organized, emphasizing passing.
TIIETA BELTS
Thota Delta Chi is another house
that takes mural ball seriously. Soph
Larry Grey, frosh trackman last
year, and Oscar Holmes are a couple
of fast ends. Ted Carpenter, Bob
Vania, Dave Lark in, and Vern Free
man are backs, and heavy Orlin
Harter, another soph, is centering.
The rest of the Upper Row can't
produce quite such rounded teams.
The Sigma Nus have two excellent
ends, Tom Shreve and Bob Slater,
with Otto McCutcheon at center. In

the backfield, Kenny Hennegan. a
soph, and Bob Wheeler are sure
starters, the other two spots being
open.
Delta Chi has three former mural
players in the backfield. Larry Wolf,
a transplanted lineman, Ed Gibbs,
and Russ Collier. Bill Ritter is num
ber four. In the line it's strictly an
open proposition. Glenn Nielsen and
Monty Stearns are the best bets for
ends. But the fast squad of Ortman,
Selby, Atkinson, which had it out
with the Zetes last year, is extinct.
That leaves Theta Xi with three
backs, Merlyn Olson, Rube Mettler,
and Johnny O'Hanneson, and no
line as yet. Two swell ends, Laurie
Clark and Jack Hieronymus appear
at the ATO house, with Nick Cam
pos, Izzie Ferrar. and Nick Cook
named for backfield posts.

Dallmar whose altitude was very
handy last basketball season. Pitch
ing to him will be Keith Pinion who
has a frosh grid letter from 1940 in
his bottom drawer. Mix these with
mural veterans, Bill Weeks, Jim
backfield. The line, composed of
Dallmar, Ralph Kewitt, and Bill
Nourse, another victim of Atherton's
1940 orgy, completes one of the
happiest pictures on the campus.
Also hopeful are the Fijis. Passing
from quarter will be Bill Harms,
the backfield quartet being rounded
out by soph baseballers Bill Brokaw
and Ken Horth, plus Don Dillon.
The line—Frank Tibbetts and Eric
Hauser at ends, and Bob Haffner at
center — furnishes the remainder,
with blocking ability the question
mark here.
At the Delta Tau house, the Card's
best baseball duo, Pitcher Harry
Mason and Catcher Ward Walkup,
appear in the grid backfield. Art
Matthews, a sharp blocker, and A1
Harris of the soph class will play in

Pete Bosche, and Shelly Parker in
the line. Their practice has been well

Thota Delta Chi is another house
that takes mural ball seriously. Soph
Larry Grey, frosh trackman last
year, and Oscar Holmes are a couple
of fast ends. Ted Carpenter, Bob
Vania, Dave Lark in, and Vern Free
man are backs, and heavy Orlin
Harter, another soph, is centering.
The rest of the Upper Row can't
produce quite such rounded teams.
The Sigma Nus have two excellent
ends, Tom Shreve and Bob Slater,
with Otto McCutcheon at center. In

the backfield, Kenny Hennegan. a
soph, and Bob Wheeler are sure
starters, the other two spots being
open.
Delta Chi has three former mural
players in the backfield. Larry Wolf,
a transplanted lineman, Ed Gibbs,
and Russ Collier. Bill Ritter is num
ber four. In the line it's strictly an
open proposition. Glenn Nielsen and
Monty Stearns are the best bets for
ends. But the fast squad of Ortman,
Selby, Atkinson, which had it out
with the Zetes last year, is extinct.
That leaves Theta Xi with three
backs, Merlyn Olson, Rube Mettler,
and Johnny O'Hanneson, and no
line as yet. Two swell ends, Laurie
Clark and Jack Hieronymus appear
at the ATO house, with Nick Cam
pos, Izzie Ferrar. and Nick Cook
named for backfield posts.
(Editor's Note: This is the second
in a series of three articles survey
ing 1942 intramural football pros
pects on the Farm. Today the Upper
Row is featured.)

From the upper portion of Lasuen
Street, where greater spaces give
more room for practice and several
hills give more muscle on the legs,
Stanford will receive some of its
better 1942 intramural football teams.
Ignoring the fact that the mural
champ for several years has come
from nearer sea level, down by the
Firehouse, the outlook for several of
the hill teams is uniquely rosy. At
least three have full teams back, and
several of them have passers and re
