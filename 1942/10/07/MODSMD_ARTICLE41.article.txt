# Wolter Asks Mural Groups For Spotters
## 
### 
Wartime conditions came even
closer to Stanford athletics when
Hari'y Wolter, director of the stu
dent intramural program, suggested
to a meeting of football managers
last night that the living groups
which they represented should be
come a part of the Ground Observ
ers Corps Air Raid Warning Service,
Army Air Corps.
The managers were asked to place
the following proposal before their
groups before another meeting
sometime next week: that each
group undertake to man a nearby
aircraft spotting tower one night a
month from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., with
the time split into two-hour shifts
of two men each.
Since about fifty groups are ex
pected to enroll in the mural pro
gram, the assignment could be han
dled rather easily through that me
dium, Wolter stated.
FOOTBALL PLANS
The football program will begin
sometime next week, Wolter stated.
All teams must be signed up on the
gym bulletin boards by Friday, so
that the directors can draw up
league assignments over the week
end.
No changes in the rules of play
and eligibility listed in the intra
mural folder are contemplated.
Managers are urged to get a copy of
the book at the School of Health
office before play begins.
The need for trained referees is
acute, Wolter stated, and any stu
dents who have had experience in
grid officiating should contact him
at once. The job pays a minimum of
fifty cents an hour.
VOLLEYBALL SOON
The volleyball program will also
open next week, with games tenta
tively set for evenings when grid
games are not played. Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday have been
suggested as times for the latter.
There is a definite possibility that
the mural championship game will
be played as a preliminary to a
P.C.C. football game late in No
vember, possibly the Oregon game
on November 10.
The thirty managers present were
urged to consider the coming pro
gram as a student venture which
demands complete co-operation with
officials and with rules set by the
players at the beginning of the
season.
Women who make their own
clothes can easily have a hat if they
stick to the turban style.

VOLLEYBALL SOON
The volleyball program will also
open next week, with games tenta
tively set for evenings when grid
games are not played. Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday have been
suggested as times for the latter.
There is a definite possibility that
the mural championship game will
be played as a preliminary to a
P.C.C. football game late in No
vember, possibly the Oregon game
on November 10.
The thirty managers present were
urged to consider the coming pro
gram as a student venture which
demands complete co-operation with
officials and with rules set by the
players at the beginning of the
season.
Women who make their own
clothes can easily have a hat if they
stick to the turban style.
Wartime conditions came even
closer to Stanford athletics when
Hari'y Wolter, director of the stu
dent intramural program, suggested
to a meeting of football managers
last night that the living groups
which they represented should be
come a part of the Ground Observ
ers Corps Air Raid Warning Service,
Army Air Corps.
The managers were asked to place
the following proposal before their
groups before another meeting
sometime next week: that each
group undertake to man a nearby
aircraft spotting tower one night a
month from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m., with
the time split into two-hour shifts
of two men each.
Since about fifty groups are ex
pected to enroll in the mural pro
gram, the assignment could be han
dled rather easily through that me
dium, Wolter stated.
FOOTBALL PLANS
The football program will begin
sometime next week, Wolter stated.
All teams must be signed up on the
gym bulletin boards by Friday, so
that the directors can draw up
league assignments over the week
end.
No changes in the rules of play
and eligibility listed in the intra
mural folder are contemplated.
Managers are urged to get a copy of
the book at the School of Health
office before play begins.
The need for trained referees is
acute, Wolter stated, and any stu
dents who have had experience in
grid officiating should contact him
at once. The job pays a minimum of
fifty cents an hour.
