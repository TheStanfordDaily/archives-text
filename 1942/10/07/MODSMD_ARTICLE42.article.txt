## Look Magazine Photographer To Begin Basketball Pictures 
### 
Maurice Terrill, a photographer for Look Magazine, national news
picture weekly, begins work on the campus this morning on a series of
pictures of Stanford's national basketball champions and their famous
mentor, Everett Dean.
Working with Dean and Publicity Director Don Selby, Terrill will take
action shots illustrating the basketball technique which led the Cards to
the P.C.C. and national crowns last season. Sports Editor Jack Gunther
of Look stated in a letter to Dean that the pictures would appear sometime
toward the start of the college basketball season, probably in early De
cember.

For the work, Dean will call upon
returning varsity members, includ
ing Howie Dallmar, Ed Voss, Jack
Dana, Fred Linari, Leo McCaffrey,
Fred Oliver, and others. Conspicu
ously absent, in tomorrow's shots at
least, will be Bill Cowden and Don
Burness, the graduated veterans, and
Jim Pollard who will not return to
Scholastic competition.
In one sense the spread in the
magazine is a personal compliment
to Coach Dean since Harlan Logan,
editor of Look, once played basket
ball under the Farm leader at In
diana University.
The national attention which will
be called towards Stanford hoopsters
by the article may or may not be
embarrassing to this year's squad.
When varsity practice starts Monday,
the answer will begin to unroll.
Two of the best soph prospects,
Dave Brown and Bob Hall, are trav
eling under varsity grid colors, and
another. Jack Heald, has a bad knee
which kept him away from football
this fall.
