## 
### BOB FISHER 
Through the hospitality of the
Cardinal soccer team, Stanford's
' good sporting name is spreading
j across international boundaries and
doing its part to facilitate good feel
j ing for the allied cause.
Recently two damaged British
! cruisers limped into port at San
! Francisco. After arrangements for
! repairs had been made, the first
! thing the athletic officer in charge
! did was to call up and make ar
\ rangements for soccer matches with
! the Stanford squad.
The story goes back to last year,
j His Majesty's Ship, the Orion had
j been seriously damaged in the bat
tle of Crete, and had managed to
{ dock in San Francisco for repairs.
MATCHES ARRANGED
The British sailors found them
selves with time on their hands. Be
ing adept at the good old English
games of soccer and rugby, they ar
ranged some matches with teams in
the San Francisco vicinity.
One of these teams was Stanford
University. After the contest, the
Stanford men entertained the sailors,
inviting them up to the fraternities
and doing their best to make the
sailors' visit as enjoyable as possible.
Eight months passed. All the re
pairs having been completed, the
! Orion steamed out of San Francisco
j harbor on her way toward further
combat.
SHIPS MEET
Somewhere in the Pacific the
Orion met the two other damaged
British ships The athletic officer of
the Orion got in touch with the ath-
I letic officers of the other two ships.
He advised them:
"When you arrive in San Fran
! Cisco if you want some recreation
S for the men, do not fail to get in
I touch with Stanford University and
j arrange for some soccer matches."
Coach Harry Maloney said about
| this incident "This is the kind of
j publicity you cannot buy, it's the
j kind of publicity you have to earn."
