# Work in the Cannery
## 
### 
WE are at war, and because we are at war
the reservoir of manpower to help in can
neries has been drained practically dry by
higher paying defense plants and by the Army,
Navy, and Marines.
We of Stanford have a definite part we can
play right here at home. The Mountain View
Supply Company, to state a single instance,
needs men for all shifts to help fill orders from
the government for the armed forces. The Daily,
with the co-operation of Rosemary Cross, has
worked out a scheme by which Stanford men
can do much to relieve this shortage of man
power.
This morning on the war map in the Cellar
will be found a chart of hours which the men
can sign to help work in that particular cannery
for Thursday. When the number of men avail
able is determined, transportation difficulties
will be ironed out and published in tomorrow's
Daily. In any case, the cannery has promised
to pay for expenses to and from the plant.
There is one difficulty in a signup system,
however. To promise to work and then to quit
at the last moment is worse than doing nothing
it all, for the cannery will plan its work around
the number of men to be expected each hour.
So, if you are in doubt about whether or not
you will be able to help at a certain hour, don't
put your name down on the list.
The cannery needs men 24 hours a day. Stan
ford cannot be expected to work 30 men (which
is the number needed for every two-hour shift)
for each shift, but if we can contribute any
help at all, it will be appreciated.
Before signing up for any job, remember
these three very important points:
1. If you are in any type of Army, Navy, or
Marine reserve, you are under obligation to
keep up your grades. If you fall down in your
studies, you will be dragged right out of school
into the armed forces. It is essential that we
have trained leaders for this war.
2. When you feel that you have put in
enough time with your books, sign up for work
in the cannery. You will be doing a great favor
and you will also be earning a little money.
3. If you do this type of work, some part of
your present social-study-relaxation program
will have to suffer. It doesn't take a lot of brains
to see that social life is the logical spot to hit.
We realize that a certain amount of social relax
ation is necessary, but we cannot continue as
we have in the past.
So, why not drop into the Cellar today and
sign up for work tomorrow?

The cannery needs men 24 hours a day. Stan
ford cannot be expected to work 30 men (which
is the number needed for every two-hour shift)
for each shift, but if we can contribute any
help at all, it will be appreciated.
Before signing up for any job, remember
these three very important points:
1. If you are in any type of Army, Navy, or
Marine reserve, you are under obligation to
keep up your grades. If you fall down in your
studies, you will be dragged right out of school
into the armed forces. It is essential that we
have trained leaders for this war.
2. When you feel that you have put in
enough time with your books, sign up for work
in the cannery. You will be doing a great favor
and you will also be earning a little money.
3. If you do this type of work, some part of
your present social-study-relaxation program
will have to suffer. It doesn't take a lot of brains
to see that social life is the logical spot to hit.
We realize that a certain amount of social relax
ation is necessary, but we cannot continue as
we have in the past.
So, why not drop into the Cellar today and
sign up for work tomorrow?
WE are at war, and because we are at war
the reservoir of manpower to help in can
neries has been drained practically dry by
higher paying defense plants and by the Army,
Navy, and Marines.
We of Stanford have a definite part we can
play right here at home. The Mountain View
Supply Company, to state a single instance,
needs men for all shifts to help fill orders from
the government for the armed forces. The Daily,
with the co-operation of Rosemary Cross, has
worked out a scheme by which Stanford men
can do much to relieve this shortage of man
power.
This morning on the war map in the Cellar
will be found a chart of hours which the men
can sign to help work in that particular cannery
for Thursday. When the number of men avail
able is determined, transportation difficulties
will be ironed out and published in tomorrow's
Daily. In any case, the cannery has promised
to pay for expenses to and from the plant.
There is one difficulty in a signup system,
however. To promise to work and then to quit
at the last moment is worse than doing nothing
it all, for the cannery will plan its work around
the number of men to be expected each hour.
So, if you are in doubt about whether or not
you will be able to help at a certain hour, don't
put your name down on the list.
