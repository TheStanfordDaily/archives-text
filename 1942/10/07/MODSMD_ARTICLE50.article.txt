TONIGHT at 7:30 the executive body of the
Associated Students meets for its second
weekly meeting of the quarter. After a very
dull Summer Quarter session, when every mo
tion was passed unanimously, Excom practi
cally blew the lid off of its meeting room last
week debating whether or not to pass on a
date for a rally for the Santa Clara game.
There will be much doing tonight besides
the routine business of granting dates. With
Ed Stamm en route to South Bend, Leslie Lang
necker will preside.
We are glad to see that this Excom has a little
life except for a few exceptions. But we wish
to point out that if Excom as a body represent
ing every student at Stanford does not wake up
to the fact that some very definite program
should be put forward soon centered around

Stanford's position in this war, it will lose its
right to exist as a wartime governing body.
We do not mean to sit back and tell Excom
to go ahead and pass legislation without pre
senting a plan. The Daily will have its say to
night at the meeting and in these columns until
a workable program has been formulated.
