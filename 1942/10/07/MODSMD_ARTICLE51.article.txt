There is still a war going on, although the Santa
Clara game and the Series may have pushed it
out of your consciousness for a few days. The
United Press reports coming oil llic wire announce,
among other things, that a major battle is brewing
in the Solomons and the Aleutians, and that Stalin
grad is still Russian and still fighting.
As recent reports have shown, our establishments
in the Solomons, on Guadalcanal, for instance, are
little more than exaggerated beach-heads. Entire
islands have not been occupied, only some strategic
portions of the shoreline, and there are powerful Jap
forces si ill intact and dangerous inland. Japanese
reinforcements have been landed in several places,
and '"usually well-informed sources" report that
powerful Japanese naval units have been sent south.
Meanwhile, General Mac Arthur's troops continue
to force back the enemy in l\ew Guinea.
1 he news from the North Pacific, while perhaps
of less magnitude, is jusl as encouraging. Wash
ington announces that kiska has been raided "al
most daily" since mid-September and that the
pounding the Japs have taken has been consider
able.
There are indications that the RAF and the U.S.
Army Air Force are set to open a new and intensive
bombing campaign on Occupied France. The BBC
broadcasts to the Continent have lately contained
warnings to Frenchmen to evacuate themselves from
areas producing war materials for Germany.
Blood and steel are writing the epic of Stalin
grad. To comment with a typewriter is a little
silly. The question comes to mind, however, as to
whether or not the citizens of an American city
would show as much guts as those Russians have
shown and are showing.
