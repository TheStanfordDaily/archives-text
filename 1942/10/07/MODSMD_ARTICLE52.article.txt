# BULL SESSION
## LESLIE IN CHAIR 
### BY H. D. Thoreau 
Tonight Leslie Langneeker will lake over the
reins of the Executive Committee of the A.S.S.U.
in the absence of our President Ed Stannn, who has
gone to a convention at South Bend, Indiana.
The docket for ihe evening includes such goodies
as Civilian Defense Council report, Publications
Council report, Rally Committee report, Activity
files report, Election Board report, N.S.F.A. War
Heroes report, N.S.F.A. Convention report, Cardi
nals report, Catherine ihc Great report (Catherine
won I be able to make it herself, but someone will
be at the meeting to represent her I, along with a
few other items of universal importance.
However, the highlight of the evening's enter
tainment holds down the number five spot on the
docket. On the old vaudeville circuit this spot came
just before the intermission and was usually held
open for the trained seals or some other equally
sparkling attraction.
On tonight's Excom extravaganza we have Miss
Patricia Bouchard s campaign to Light I p the
Campus. J\ot knowing ihe particulars of this drive,
1 cannot further enlighten you as to the purpose of
the whole thing, but I in suic it will be worth while.
Perhaps since excess electric illumination would
hardly be patriotic at this lime, we could have a I'i
Phi sit on every corner at night and thereby lighten
the way of any traveler who might not be able to
make it from ihe Library to the Co-op House in one
jump.
Although no such crowd as attended the opening
night of ihe "Let's Make liugby a Major Sport"'
drive is expected, there will be a tidy little group
crowding around the big golden ochre table so don't
wait until the last minute if you expect to get an
orchestra seal.
