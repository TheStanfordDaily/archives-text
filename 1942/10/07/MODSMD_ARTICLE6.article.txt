# Winter Quarter Rushing Planned by Row Council
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Fraternity rushing of new lower division men will be held Winter
Quarter, according to t'ic decision of the Interfraternity Council in its
first meeting of the 1942-4!} school year at the Delt House last night.

In a move that, as President Lee
Peake said, " â€”will keep both Row
and Encina scholastic averages up,
not only for the Autumn Quarter,
but for the year as a whole," the
council approved of an 18 to 21-day
program including three open
houses, the exact details of which
are to be worked out by a rushing
committee, headed by Peter Gadd.
BALMAN RESIGNS
Ben Parkinson was elected to the
post of secretary of the council,
succeeding Frank Bauman who had
to resign due to pressure of other
duties. Parkinson's election was
unanimous after Ralph Kewit and
Shelly Parker had declined the
nomination.
Bill Collings of the War Board
spoke briefly to the row representa
tives as to the possibility of fra
ternity men signing up for week-end
work to aid in the elimination of the
crop-harvesting labor shortage.
Peake announced the Interfrater
nity Conference, tentatively set for
October 14 at which all house presi
dents, managers, and rushing chair
men will meet with administration
heads and the Interfraternity Board
of Control to discuss the Stanford
fraternities' situation during this
national emergency. The date is
pending Chancellor Wilbur's sched
ule, since he will be one of the
speakers.
COMMITTEE HEADS
The following men were appointed
as heads of the following committees
for the coming year: Scholarship,
Bob Blake; alumni relations, Gil
Thompson; social, Ralph Kewit:
nominating, Eugene O'Neill.
No one is holding the council's
Tarver Scholarship this year, since
Joe Morin, the appointee, was not
able to use the scholarship.
