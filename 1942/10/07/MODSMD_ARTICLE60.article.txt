## French Civilians Warned to Evacuate War Plant Territory 
### 
LONDON, Oct. G (UP).â€”An esti
mated 200 or more British bombers
raided western Germany last night
and the British radio tonight broad
cast a warning "on behalf of the
U.S. air forces in England" to French
civilians to evacuate areas around
German war plants in France be
cause they were subject to bombing.

The Berlin radio went off the air
at 9:05 p.m., indicating the RAF
might be operating over German
territory for the second successive
night in its renewed offensive
against Reich industries which Mar
shal Hermann Goering admitted
Sunday he was powerless to pre-

vent.
The British Broadcasting Com
pany warning urged French people
living within a mile of any factory
or other objective serving the Ger
man war effort to move their resi
dences."
The warning said there was "com
plete American sympathy" with the
French people but pointed out that
in operational bombing of military
objectives in the occupied zone, sur
rounding areas "are inevitably en
dangered."

Indicating that U.S. planes are
about to start sustained daylight
raids on France to augment the
RAF'.s night attacks on Germany,
the BBC listed particular U.S. Air
Force objectives as factories pro
ducing airplane and tank parts, ve
hicles and chemicals, and major
freight yards, shipbuilding yards and
submarine bases.
