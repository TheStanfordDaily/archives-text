# V-7 Students Meet Tonight
## 
### 
Students enrolled in the Naval
Reserve's V-7 classification will
meet tonight in the Nitery of the
Old Union building for the purpose
of organizing a Stanford indoctrina
tion ship at the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor.
The local Sea Scout chapter has
invited the Stanford Naval Reservists
to use its facilities and has volun
teered to enroll these students in the
Sea Scouts. This enrollment will be
done tonight, and all students at
tending the meeting are asked to
bring their $1 initiation fee.
The Stanford Sea Scout boat will
furnish these future Naval officers
with practical training in navigation
and small boat handling. The Stan
ford group will cruise Sundays at
the harbor in a Sea Scout ketch
and will participate in lifeboat and
signal drills. Captain Ruckee, for
merly of the merchant marine, will
be the group commander.
An excellent turnout at tonight's
meeting is expected, as this pre
indoctrination training for Stanford's
V-7 students is not offered at any
other college on the coast.
