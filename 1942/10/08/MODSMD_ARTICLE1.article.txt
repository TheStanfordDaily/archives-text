# No Friday Dates, Rules Excommittee
## Legislators Appoint Griswold Elections Committee Leader 
### AL HAMPSON 
Excom broke precedent last night.
Passed with a minimum of discus
sion was the resolution to grant no
Friday night dates for campus or
ganizations for the coming year and
to cancel those which it had already
granted.
It was decided that this action
was desirable since the University
is now operating on a six-day week
and there is no place for social ac
tivities on Friday night which will
"make Saturday's classes value
less," according to Lucy Terrill.
"Tie Administration said either
we close Friday night, or we won't
show up Saturday morning," she
continued, in relation referring spe
cifically to the success of the Sum
mer Quarter when operated on a
six-day week.
"It is up to us to break down," she
concluded.
Excom approved the minutes of
the last Cardinals meeting, and Hay
Busch, representing the Cardinals,
told of the duties, plans, and recom
mendations which Cardinals has
formulated for the coming year.
CARDINALS PLACE
In answer to the frequently re
curring rumor that Cardinals is
out-dated and no longer efficient,
Busch stated that Cardinals can act
as a straining body for Excom and
"save Excom a lot of valuable time."
He went on to say that Cardinals
had a large number of duties. "We
have to keep up the trophy case in
the Cellar about which we have a
new policy."
In regard to its social activities,
Busch said, "The Big Game dance
was one hell of a job, frankly. I
would hate to see you disband Car
dinals and take it on yourselves,
especially when you will just ap
point another committee."
Excom, then approved a motion
to have Cardinals present a plan for
its social activities for the Autumn
and Winter Quarters at the meeting
next week.
N.S.F.A. CONVENTION
Fran Harvey discussed her plans
for the local N.S.FA. convention
which will be held here Nov. 14
and 15.
The minutes of the Publication
and Dramatic Councils were ap
proved.
Excom also approved by a unani
mous vote John Fulton's plan for
raising money for the U.S.O.
Bob Griswold was appointed head
of the Election Board. It was de
cided that in the job of choosing
his 11 subordinates Excom would
continue to help him.
