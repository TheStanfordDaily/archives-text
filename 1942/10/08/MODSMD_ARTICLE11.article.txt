# Russians Wipe Out Nazi Shock Troops, Tanks in Stalingrad
## 
### 
MOSCOW. Oct. 8 (UP).—The Russians killed 800 more Germans and
destroyed 1!) of their tanks while beating off every attack on Stalingrad
Wednesday, the high command announced today, and unofficial reports
said at least 200,000 of Hitler's best shock troops already have been slain
in the 45-day battle for the city.
The midnight communique accounted for approximately :»,:}5O more

. Axis troops slain on all fronts, from
the lofty Caucasus Mountains to the
chilling plains northwest of Moscow.
These included 150 Germans killed
in the Don-Volga corridor by a Rus
sian army driving down to relieve
Stalingrad from the northwest; 100
at an unidentified sector; a com
pany of 250 men in the Mozdok
sector near the Grozny oil fields; two
battalions (1,000 men) of Rumanians
near the Black Sea coast; 800 Nazis
on the northwestern front, and a
company of 2,580 wiped out by Rus
sian planes.
RELIEF FORCES PUSH ON
The relief forces bearing down on
Stalingrad from the Don Valley
again "improved their positions"
Wednesday, the communique re
ported, and a single detachment
commanded by a lieutenant was
credited with killing the 150 Ger
mans there.
The only Russian setback reported
was in the Caucasus, where Soviet
troops fell back to new defense
positions near Mozdok. This was
offset, however, by the encirclement
and anihilation of the two Rumanian
battalions farther west, below the
fallen Novorossisk naval base.
Every dispatch from the Stalin
grad front said the battle was stead
ily increasing in ferocity. German
gains there the past week can be
measured only in yards.
NAZIS RUSH TROOPS
One of the latest German moves,
according to the newspaper Pravda,
was to rush five battalions (2,500
men) of sappers and construction
troops, experts in dynamite demoli
tion and veterans of the storming of
Sevastopol, out of the Crimea by
airplane and throw them into action
in Stalingrad's northwestern sub
urbs.
The Germans were believed to be
preparing to pulverize that part of
the city—mostly workers' quarters
and factories—due to their failure
to smash its defenses after days of
assaults by up to 500,000 men, hun
dreds of tanks and 1,000 airplanes.
Front dispatches Wednesday said
that in addition to recapturing three
streets, the Russians drove the Ger
mans from several blocks of build
ings which they had just seized in
a minor break-through. The Ger
mans were starting to clear out
fences and fortify the buildings
when they were routed.
