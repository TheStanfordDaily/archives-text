# Reserves Must Get C Average
## Men Going Minus Will Be Called Up 
### 
Stanford students enlisted in either
the Army or the Navy enlisted re
serve must have at least a C average
at the end of each quarter, or they
will be called to active duty, accord
ing to a recent release from Wash
ington.
"On account of the necessary lapse
of time in reporting scholastic stand
ings," the release continues, "it is
probable that in many such cases
the student will be ordered to active
duty at the end of the next subse
quent grading period." A like fate
will befall all who fail to attain a
sufficiently high standing in the gen
eral comprehensive examination to
be given all enlisted students prior
to the end of the sophomore year.
Furthermore, students "must carry
a full-time schedule of studies as
customarily defined by the institu
tion."
Enlisted reserve students enrolled
in Stanford may elect to follow either
the regular four-year course of
study or the accelerated program,
but are expected to take the ac
celerated program if financially able.
