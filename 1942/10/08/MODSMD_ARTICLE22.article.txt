# Norway Flares Against Nazis
## 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 8 (UP). —Serious
disturbances were reported to have
occurred in Oslo last night and the
Germans were expected to proclaim
a state of emergency at any hour
in the Norwegian capital.
The outbreaks, reported in a
United Press Stockholm dispatch to
have been precipitated when Quis
ling and German police made sev
eral raids, followed the execution of
15 by firing squads at Trond
heim. Their deaths raised to 25 the
number of victims of a Nazi terror
in Norway that apparently is arous
ing all Scandinavia to a pitch un
equaled since the Nazis swept
northward in 1940.
LIKE STREET BATTLES
The dispatch said the raids ap
peared to have met resistance and
that the police showered houses and
streets with submachine gun bul
lets. The shooting was reported so
intense at one time that it gave the
impression that street battles were
in progress, Stockholm reported.
Stockholm said the state of emer
gency—martial law already is in
effect along over a 500-mile strip
of the central Norwegian coast—
probably would be proclaimed in
Oslo as soon as Josef Terboven,
Reich Commissioner for Norway,
and Gen. Wilhelm Rediess, chief of
the Gestapo, returned from Trond
heim.
Stockholm also reported that a
showdown in German-Danish rela
tions, reportedly strained during re
cent days, was expected soon.
ANNOUNCED BY RADIO
The latest executions in Trond
heim were announced last night by
the Oslo radio.
Condemned by a special court
which rejected their appeals for
mercy, the 15 were executed at 7
p.m. in the presence of the Trond
heim chief of police, the German
controlled broadcast said. Two
other Norwegians received seven
year prison sentences and another
defendant was discharged.
Authoritative quarters re
ported the ruthless German reprisals
were touched off by a plot to sabo
tage the Trondheim naval base, nest
of German raiders which prey on
Allied convoys.

number of victims of a Nazi terror
in Norway that apparently is arous
ing all Scandinavia to a pitch un
equaled since the Nazis swept

LIKE STREET BATTLES
The dispatch said the raids ap
peared to have met resistance and
that the police showered houses and
streets with submachine gun bul
lets. The shooting was reported so
intense at one time that it gave the
impression that street battles were
in progress, Stockholm reported.
Stockholm said the state of emer
gency—martial law already is in
effect along over a 500-mile strip
of the central Norwegian coast—
probably would be proclaimed in
Oslo as soon as Josef Terboven,
Reich Commissioner for Norway,
and Gen. Wilhelm Rediess, chief of
the Gestapo, returned from Trond
heim.
Stockholm also reported that a
showdown in German-Danish rela
tions, reportedly strained during re
cent days, was expected soon.
ANNOUNCED BY RADIO
The latest executions in Trond
heim were announced last night by
the Oslo radio.
Condemned by a special court
which rejected their appeals for
mercy, the 15 were executed at 7
p.m. in the presence of the Trond
heim chief of police, the German
controlled broadcast said. Two
other Norwegians received seven
year prison sentences and another
defendant was discharged.
Authoritative quarters re
ported the ruthless German reprisals
were touched off by a plot to sabo

of German raiders which prey on
Allied convoys.
