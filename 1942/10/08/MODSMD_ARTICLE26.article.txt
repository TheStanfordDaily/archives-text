## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Local canneries have issued an
urgent demand for Stanford men to

In the wake of a movement re
cruiting crop pickers, organization
of a Farm cannery corps followed
an investigation of the critical labor
shortage by Miss Helen Vincent,
State Employment Bureau.
A work schedule sheet was posted
in the Cellar yesterday morning by
the Stanford War Board. Two fra
ternities, Delta Chi and Theta Delt.s,
responded en masse. A score of in
dividual registrants were also re
corded, announced Rosemary Cross,
SWB.
TRANSPORTATION PAII)
Functioning as a program dis
tinct from the crop pickers, the can
nery contingent will make its first

wagons would be provided by the
cannery for transportation. Last
night the cannery reported that the
cais were unavailable, but that
workers would be given 50 cents to
cover transportation. Their wages
will be 73 cents per hour.
In an effort to intensify recruit
ment, the SWB will circulate speak
ers to all men's living groups to
night, to give them details of the
labor program.
Three local canneries have issued
formal calls for Stanford men —
Mountain View Supply Company,
Sutter Cannery and the Libby plant
at Sunnyvale.
