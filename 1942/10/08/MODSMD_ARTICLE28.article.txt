# Allied Advance Retarded In New Guinea Mountains
## 
### 
GEN. Mat ARTHUR'S HEADQUARTERS, Australia, Oct. 8 (LP).—
Rugged mountain terrain has slowed down the Allied advance; over the
Owen Stanley Mountains of New Guinea, which has been made with
' practically no losses" of Australian troops composing the offensive force,
it was announced today.
For the first time in many weeks, the daily communique issued by

Gen. Douglas Mac-Arthur's head
quarters did not report any Allied
aerial attacks. It was devoted to
a brief discussion of the Owen Stan
ley situation and otherwise reported
only aerial reconnaissance activity
in the area northwest of Australia.
"Some difficulties of terrain now
are progressively slowing down the
advance of out' ground troops," the
communique said in reference to the
Owen Stanley fighting. It was the
first time since the offensive began
on Sept. 25 that headquarters did
not specify where the advancing
Australians were.
Yesterday's communique said they
were advancing forward from Kagi,
about five miies south of the gap
which crosses the mountains, with
out encountering any enemy resist
ance.
'today's communique said that
"(bis incredibly difficult range of
mountains presents almost insuper
able complications in maintenance
of supply fines for troop units of
any size."
I( said that, as anticipated, the
Japanese discovered their supply
problems had become aggravated by
almost three weeks of incessant Al
lied air attacks "and are impossible
of immediate solution."

Meanwhile, the Navy Department i
in Washington issued a communi- I
que stating that Japanese forces ap- j
pear to have withdrawn from two j
of the Aleutian Islands. The com- j
munique said American fliers con
tinued to blast away at Kiska—third '
of the three islands originally oc
cupied by the enemy last June.
The latest attack on Kiska, the
Navy said, occurred on Oct. 5 when
Army Liberator bombers, escorted
by fighters, shot down six Japanese
seaplanes. Demolition and incen
diary bombs were dropped on the I
enemy camp area and hits were I
made on a seaplane hangar. The
Navy said the American planes en
countered only fight anti-aircraft I
opposition and that all our planes I
returned to their base safely.
The communique said aerial re- j
connaissance had failed to show any
signs of "continued enemy occu
pancy or activity" for the last sev
eral weeks on Attn and Agattu—
westernmost of the Aleutian archi
pelago.
Army bombers attacked Attu dur
ing the latter part of September,
destroying "most of the buildings on
the island," the communique said.
