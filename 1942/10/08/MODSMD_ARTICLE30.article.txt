# 'German Food Problem Is Still Not Serious'
## 
### 
Although the German food situa
! tion has become strained since the
beginning of the war, it still is not
serious; but, according to Dr. Helen
! C. Farnsworth, of the Food Research
Institute, the situation will soon
change decisively.
This was the idea expressed in
"Wartime Food Developments in
Germany," the first of a series of
War-Peace Pamphlets, which will
replace those issues of "Wheat
Studies" which have been omitted
due to the war.
HARVESTS REDUCED
Due to bad weather and shortages
of labor, farm machinery, and ferti
lizer, the total German harvests have
been seriously reduced: however, the
I deficit has been replaced from the
large reserve stocks with which
Germany entered the war and by
voluntary and forced imports from
other European countries.
"Given time," says Dr. Farns
worth. "Nazi officials might be able
to organize the Continent's agricul
ture together with the Ukraine and
Poland to produce the large food and
feed surpluses which the Nazis have
planned."
FAMINE POSSIBLE
On the other hand, the non-co
operating and unscientific European
| peasants, the wartime shortages of

labor and machinery, and possible
transportation crises due to Allied
air raids, may bring Germany to the
edge of famine as in World War I.
"The United Nations must remem
ber, however," concludes Dr. Farns
worth, "in dealing with German food
problems, Nazi officials have already
shown marked resourcefulness and
foresight, great organizing ability,
and unparalleled ruthlessness in ex
ploiting the conquered peoples of
Europe to aid the German war ef
fort. They may be counted upon to
continue to show the same charac- |
I teristics."
