### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Boasting two strong teams and a
wealth of capable reserves, Stan
ford's varsity water polo team would
be a potential conference champion
if a conference still existed.
Losing just three men, Fred Man
waring and Frank Mitchell through
graduation and Grant Culley to the
Navy, Coach Ernie Brandsten has a
strong squad returning from last
year's powerful freshmen and var
sity swim teams.
The Card mermen tentatively have
scheduled eight games, two each
with St. Mary's Pre-Flight School,
Olympic Club, San Jose State, and
California. Their usual southern
games against Southern California
and U.C.L.A. have been cancelled
because of transportation difficulties.
"They look very good for so early
in the season.
They shoot well and pass well," re
ported Coach Brandsten after yes
terday's scrimmage. "They're so
well grounded in fundamentals, we
have been able to start scrimmaging
almost immediately."
SQUAD TAKES SHAPE
Yesterday's scrimmage saw Cap
tain Hadley Bacon, Bill Mapel, and
Emmett Cashin playing forward on
the first team. Bacon and Mapel are
veterans from last year, while Cash
in, ineligible last year, is one of the
fastest swimmers in the country.
Mappel and Cashin will alternate at
sprint.
Guards were Don Smith, captain
of the swimming team and a return
ing veteran; and Dick Narver and A1
Weeden from the 1941 yearling team.
Narver is now at center back, but
will have a real job on his hands
when Bob Jones returns to action.
Jones, a 1941 veteran and one of the
finest players on the coast, is re
covering from a recent operation,
but will be ready for action some
time next week.
Pete Lee returns to take over his
old spot at goalie. He is backed up
by Phil Onesti and Jack Carpenter.
NEW MEN ENCOURAGING
Behind these men. Brandsten has
a group of dependable reserves who
should see plenty of action. Phil Lee,
Newman, and Carroll Collins will
keep the forwards on their toes,
while Paul Egeler and Tex Ritter
from last year's varsity and Wilkin
son, Maguire, and Bud Carpenter
from the frosh team will be strong
contenders for a starting berth at
guard.
Don Dillon, who played two years
ago, returns to action and has shown
up well at guard.
The Cards open their season
against the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
School here, Oct. 17, followed by a
return match there the following
week.
