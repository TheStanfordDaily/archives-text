# Independent Gridsters Loom Strong In Murals
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This is the last of the Daily intramural football surveys.
Today independent groups are featured.)
That story about the burly blaze-chasers from the Firehouse and 4heir
wonderful intramural football teams is not only trite, but it's also true for
1942.

One can do any amount of grous
ing because people are always
"playing up" the Firehouse. In fact
they are a very groused-about team
when you add in the cussing of the
teams that they beat, one-two-three.
But this year they are again the
pick in the independent circles,
though they may get a rougher ride
than usual when they meet the best
of the Row.
NO MORE PFYL
Despite the loss of the Pl'yl bro
thers and George Kaufman, they
still have Tom Kruger, Bill Berry
essa, Frank Farrell, and a good
practice routine. Fill-ins are Jerry
Roinstaedt, Frank Wheeler, Si
O'Donnell, and Bob Ruben.
In eating club ranks, from which
the Toros reached the playoffs last
year, no organized practices are evi
dent yet. The Breakers lost most of
their team along with their cook,
especially all - intramural passer
Bruce Clark. If and when they
enter, they'll have most luck with
Johnny Mitchell and Bud Ambrose.
The Toros will use Carlos Brown,
soph basketeer, George Tolman, and
Robert Sontag in the backfield.
Sophs Tom Morton and Jerry Fine
at ends, with the center spot and
two backfield posts wide open.
LOS ARCOS
Los Arcos has organized the best
practice, but Manager Louis Gro
thaus has only three sure starters,
Howie Nicholson, Jim Block, and
Jim Julian. A practice "breather"
with the Firehouse is scheduled be
fore the regular season's play.
El Capitan, with Smiley Cameron
passing at quarterback, will use
Dick Uefflay at one end, and Don
Gabrial at half. Outside of these
starters, Johnny Youle, Bill Levers,
Carl Spilman will see much action.
In the Tigre lair, Howard Ladeen
will manage a non-veteran lineup.
Playing will be Paul Wolf, Joe Pew,
and Jim Powell, El Campo's end
Bob Hughey is a sharp pass receiver.
If Burton Berry, Joe Hirshberg, or
Irving Fine can iuund up three
others for a team, and if one of them

can pass, this outfit is good for points.
Encina will gather in corridor
meetings tonight to choose intra
mural managers for the season. For
the first time in several years, the
sophomore transfers have been
split up among the corridors. So
there will be no more 4W power
house teams to roll through the
frosh league.
The ultra-independent teams such
as the Business School, the Medical
School, and perhaps the Encina spon
sors, are unheard from. It will be
some such collection as this, how
ever, that will upset rosy applecarts
such as the Zetes and Delta Chis
planned last year.

at ends, with the center spot and

LOS ARCOS
Los Arcos has organized the best
practice, but Manager Louis Gro
thaus has only three sure starters,
Howie Nicholson, Jim Block, and
Jim Julian. A practice "breather"
with the Firehouse is scheduled be
fore the regular season's play.
El Capitan, with Smiley Cameron
passing at quarterback, will use
Dick Uefflay at one end, and Don
Gabrial at half. Outside of these
starters, Johnny Youle, Bill Levers,
Carl Spilman will see much action.
In the Tigre lair, Howard Ladeen
will manage a non-veteran lineup.
Playing will be Paul Wolf, Joe Pew,
and Jim Powell, El Campo's end
Bob Hughey is a sharp pass receiver.
If Burton Berry, Joe Hirshberg, or
Irving Fine can iuund up three
others for a team, and if one of them

can pass, this outfit is good for points.
Encina will gather in corridor
meetings tonight to choose intra
mural managers for the season. For
the first time in several years, the
sophomore transfers have been
split up among the corridors. So
there will be no more 4W power
house teams to roll through the
frosh league.
The ultra-independent teams such
as the Business School, the Medical
School, and perhaps the Encina spon
sors, are unheard from. It will be
some such collection as this, how
ever, that will upset rosy applecarts
such as the Zetes and Delta Chis
planned last year.

That story about the burly blaze-chasers from the Firehouse and 4heir
wonderful intramural football teams is not only trite, but it's also true for
1942.

One can do any amount of grous
ing because people are always
"playing up" the Firehouse. In fact
they are a very groused-about team
when you add in the cussing of the
teams that they beat, one-two-three.
But this year they are again the
pick in the independent circles,
though they may get a rougher ride
than usual when they meet the best
of the Row.
NO MORE PFYL
Despite the loss of the Pl'yl bro
thers and George Kaufman, they
still have Tom Kruger, Bill Berry

practice routine. Fill-ins are Jerry

In eating club ranks, from which
the Toros reached the playoffs last

their team along with their cook,
especially all - intramural passer
Bruce Clark. If and when they
enter, they'll have most luck with
Johnny Mitchell and Bud Ambrose.
