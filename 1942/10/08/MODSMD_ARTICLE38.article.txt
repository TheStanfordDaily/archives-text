# Farm Cagers Posed by 'Look'
## 
### 
Memories of the Farm basketball
team that flipped its way to a na
tional championship last season
lurked in the corners of Stanford |
Pavilion yesterday afternoon as
Coach Everett Dean paraded the
remainder of his title squad for Look
Photographer Maurice Terrill.
The four-page spread which Look
will run sometime in December is
to honor Dean, especially for the
years he has spent in the same high
calibre of coaching that led to the
Stanford crown.
But even if the hard labors of Ter
rill — climbing on top of the
backboard, on ladders, lying on the
floor, arranging flash bulbs and ap
paratus—produce an article worthy
of the team of 1941, to the sidelines
they were an excuse for melancholy.
Excuse number one was "Mike"
Cowden, using his last chance of'
donning a Stanford uniform to sink
his hunch-shouldered shots from the
center with the oldtime accuracy.
Excuse number two was the con
spicuous absence of Flying Indian
"Ma" Burness and stringbean Jim
Pollard.
The rest of them, the complete
lineup that faced Dartmouth in the
title clash in Kansas City last win
ter, went through the gestures for
Terrill.
Ed Voss, lumbering and bigger
than ever, push-em-up Fred Linari.
Jack Dana, and Howie Dallmar
looked rested and ready for the year.
Here's a sample of the kind of
pictures taken: Dean showing Cow
den the proper take-off for a one
handed set shot; Terrill on top of
the backboards catching Cowden as
he comes in from the side; Dallmar
showing his stretch on a rebound;
Freddy Oliver guarding.
The rest of them—McCaffrey,
Fuller, Eikleman, Leddy, Dee—
helped out, horsing around in prac
tice shots in the interlude. It's this
same horsing that Dean must change
into his 1942 attack when varsity
practice sessions open Monday.
Meanwhile. Terrill will send to
Look the picture-story of a great
coach and his best team. It may not
have a wartime sequel.
