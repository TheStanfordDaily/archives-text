# Star Guard To Captain Grid Squad
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Charley "Chuck" Taylor, Stan
ford's candidate for all-America
lienors at guard, will have an op
portunity to prove his merit this
Saturday afternoon at Knutc Rockne
IVlemoiial Stadium against the Irish
of Notre Dame.
The fiery red-head has been elect
ed game captain and will lead the
Indians against the Irish. He will be
pitted agfciinst Harry Wright, Notre
Dame quarterback who was trans
ferred to guard to take advantage of
down-field blocking. Wright is re
garded as one of the best guards in
the Midwest and should give Chuck
plenty of work on Saturday.
MIDWEST WRITERS
The game will be covered by a
strong contingent of Midwest sports
writers, particularly from Chicago,
and these men are largely instru
mental in picking all-America can
didates.
As regards the game, the Indians'
chances appear none too bright.
They will probably take the field as
2-1 or 5-2 underdogs against the
Irish.
Notre Dame's powerful squad,
picked as national football cham
! pions by most experts before the
I season opened, has a record almost
as bad as Stanford. The Irish have
tied Wisconsin, 7-7, and lost to
Georgia Tech, 13-6. However, the
experts attribute this to the Irish
unfamiliarity with the "T" forma
tion, which Coach Frank Leahey in
stalled at Notre Dame this year.
BEST BACKFIELD
The Ifish backfield. probably the
fastest and most versatile in collego
ranks, is ready to go Saturday with
the possible exception of Dippy
Evans, the veteran right halfback
Bert Bertelli, the Irish sensational
passer, will be at quarterback; fleet
footed Bill Early will be at left half
back, backed up by the sophomore
scat back, Bob Livingston; anc
Jerry Cowhig at fullback.
The Irish have a clearly market:
edge in the backfield. but the Cardi
should be able to outplay the Notre
Dame forward wall. In this, and the
Stanford familiarity with the "T"
lies the Indians' chances for ar
upset Saturday.
