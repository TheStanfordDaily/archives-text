# Frosh Gridders Prepare for First Game

### 
When the Stanford Frosh meet
Menlo Junior College this Saturday
at 2:30 in the Stadium, they will he
playing a team that has had the
taste of competition.
The United States Coast Guard
Ramblers beat the J.C. team 6-0
last week, while the yearlings have
yet to be put to the test.
Charles L. "Chuck" Winterburn,
former Stanford star, and an assist
ant under Glenn S. "Pop" Warner
here and at Temple University, has
been named the new football coach
at the boys school, replacing Roy
Hughes, who is leaving for a posi
tion in the U.S. Navy.
Playing fullback for the Menlo
Oaks is ex-Stanfordite Neele John
ston, who was slated to substitute
for Pay Hammett in the varsity
backfield. But Johnston was de
clared ineligible at the beginning of
the practice season, so went down

the highway to Menlo Park and
registered.
In a practice scrimmage against
the remaining varsity, the fvosh
turned in a very creditable perform
ance. Steve Tish showed that he is

quite capable of filling in for the
ailing Bill Agnew at fullback. Tish,
weighing 205 pounds, is big and fast,
hitting the line hard. Jack Brown
son, outstanding quarterback, threw
some very good passes.
