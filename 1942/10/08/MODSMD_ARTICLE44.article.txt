LAST week a prominent American author lost
a lot of friends and the respect of an entire
nation when he declared publicly, and quite
noisily, that he thought England would be bet
ter off under Adolf Hitler than under the present
British ruling class. The author, Theodore
Dreiser, was publicly criticized and privately
damned, because his remarks v/ere exagger
ated, badly phrased, and almost treasonably
ill-timed. But few people challenged the fact
that there was an element of truth and justi
fication in criticizing the political, socia'., and
economic mores of the British ruling aristoc
racy.
Americans were among those who got excited
about Dreiser. They got excited and they got
angry, because, many of them declared, and in
good truth, he was inadvertently and stupidly
playing into the hands of Hitler's fifth column
propaganda in this country, which for over a
year now has been aimed at a dissolution of
the Anglo-American alliance.
Strangely enough, however, some of the ex
cited and angry Americans were the same
Americans who with one hand work for a vic
tory of the United Nations and with the other
attack the bulwark of United Nations strength,
and our most valiant ally, Russia.
Yes, some of these same Americans who are
so wary of Dr. Goebbel's propaganda continue
to warn us about "those Russians." These are
the wiseacres who remind us that Russia is a
dictatorship, that she is totalitarian, that she
annexed Finland and the Baltics several years
ago. These things are by definition bad, so
the argument would seem to run, and the label
which must be attached to German conquest
must also be attached to Russian conquest.
That is, both must be labeled aggressors.
There is no need to point out the very super
ficial differences between the German totali
tarianism and the Soviet totalitarianism. Such
a distinction should be obvious to anyone who
reads the papers. In the same way there is no
need to whitewash Russia's foreign policies of
the last four years, or to condemn them wholly,
to make up your mind, and quite completely,
which side we are on, and which side Russia
is on. Russian "aggression" cannot be lumped
in the same category with Nazi "aggression"â€”
unless one wishes to ignore completely the
causal factors of this conflict, the disastrous
blindness of the democracies, and the shrewd
ness and farsightedness of the Russian Foreign
Office which at least had the common sense
to realize that Hitler was not just playing games,
while the British and the French thought he was
and wanted to play with him.
For those who, like England's still-flourishing
Cliveden Set, remain suspicious of the Soviet,
and work quietly toward disintegrating her pres
ent cordial and firmly cemented bonds of alli
ance with the Western democracies, for those
who continue to warn against Russia and Rus
sian aims in the post-war settlement, we can
offer little hope or comfort that their fears will
not be realized. Russia will have a prominent
voice at the peace table, there can be no doubt
of that. She has earned that voice more than
any of the other United Nations engaged in
this conflict, and because of this, and because
her ultimate social aims are in no way contra
dictory to the Atlantic Charter, her voice will
be heard.
All this, of course, provided we win the war. !
