A dispatch from London, forwarded from Stock
holm, where they had it from German circles in
Oslo, discloses that Adolf Hitler is planning a "Cer
inunic confederate state to be formed hy annex
ing Holland, Denmark, Norway, and Slovenia to
the Reich, ' "in'much the same manner that Austria
and Luxembourg have been incorporated." All
elected governments are to be suppressed, it is said,
and replaced by Berlin-appointed administrators.
Meanwhile, there is a new wave of sabotage re
ported on the Continent. In Norway, the S.S. men
have executed 15 Norwegians and jailed hundreds
more. Members of the Danish Nazi "Free Corps,"
on leave from the Russian front, have refused to
return to the trenches, and their very appearance
has set off riots in the Danish streets. Even German
broadcasts admit that the situation is serious. There
have been new executions in France. The situation
in the Balkans is simmering to a boil in a confer
ence of Balkan rulers summoned to Vienna for a
conference with the Nazi authorities.
It is easy to see, in the face of such outbreaks,
why the Nazis advance such plans for what, in
effect, is a new "Holy Roman Empire of the Ger
man Nation." With the countries losing their inde
pendent status, the Nazis could conscript their man
power for the German army and for German in
dustry. In the long view, the Oslo reports say, an
enlarged German slate dominating the continent
would make for "a happier and more prosperous
Europe." From the German point of view, it
doubtless would.
Tt has been reported that the Danes have already
refused any voluntary confederation. No opinion
has been expressed by the Dutch, Norwegians, etc..
in words, but the wave of sabotage and riot already
referred to speaks louder than words. Oct. 8, 1942.
