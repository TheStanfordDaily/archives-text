She was a little buck-toothed child, oh, so very,
very buck-toothed. She had a little, just barely
visible, moustache under a little turned-up nose.
She used double negatives frequently. She had
brown, gypsy legs and brown hair. And she gave
the impression of great wisdom and great loneli
ness. She was only sixteen.
I met her—where? ... in San Francisco and
worked with her. Vie were both in very subordi
nate positions at a very lofty institution. I didn't
like her when she first came to work. No one very
much liked her.
Her name was Grant—but it might have well
been Lee, or Graham, or Smith, or Brown—or
Lincoln.
es, Lincoln. I hat was how I first came to
know her a little—how shall I say it?—more search
ingly. It seems that her great-grandfather ( she said)
had known, associated with, Abraham Lincoln in
Salem, Illinois. And then I asked her some more
things about herself and her family and her life
and her thoughts (though in my intellectual supe
riority 1 hardly believed that she could have any
thoughts).
Her father had been a coal-miner near Spring
field. Illinois. 1 ( )2[) came. I here was no coal-min
ing to be done. The family took to the road. Some
times they walked, sometimes the father made
enough money to buy an old rattletrap car. In 1932
they spent a spring in Holly Valley, Kentucky.
I he little girl talks about that spring a bit long
ingly: "pink blossoms, purple hills, warm sun. sniff
ing dogs." There was no school in Holly Valley
and the little girl thinks that some day she would
like to go back to Kentucky and start a school
there.
Then her family hit the road again. They drifted
and wandered all over the West. Nebraska, Idaho,
Missouri, Utah. Kansas, Washington, Oregon, the
Dakotas—the West. But one day the father and the
mother split up. The father went to Michigan, the
mother to San Francisco. The little girl went to
work.
She talked as if schools had seen little of her.
She talked as if she had experienced a great deal,
had learned much about living. She wasn't ever gay
except at a few choice moments when her buck
teeth glistened. She wasn't very bright and she
said little maddening truths that irritated the
people with whom she worked. And she said she
soil of liked the life on the road, missed it some
how.
I didn't talk to her very much after she had
told me her story. It somehow bothered me to speak
to her much.
It is much easier to sit around in places smelling
of stale beer with indirect lighting and blaring
juke boxes and the jest-making chatter-chatter of
bright young pseudo-sophistieates than to talk to
dull Miss Grants in San Francisco or Seattle or St.
Paul. But sometimes I wonder what that friend of
Miss Grant's great-grandfather in Salem, Illinois,
would have said about voung Miss Grant.
