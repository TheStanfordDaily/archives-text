and harmony. He told how the stu
dents in the American universities
and colleges were leading the way in
bringing the young people of the

considering a number of schools and
was walking down the street one
day in La Paz, the Bolivian capital,
when he happened to run into Prof.
Paul R. Hanna of the Stanford edu
cation department. They got to
talking about schools, and in the
end Professor Hanna sold the young
South American on the Farm.
