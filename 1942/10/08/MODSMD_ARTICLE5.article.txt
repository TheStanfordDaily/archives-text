# Campus Eating Clubs To Seek New Members
## Walker, Club Heads Propose Four-Point Operating Program 
### 
Continuing a period of intensified
rushing, Stanford's seven eating
clubs this week endeavored to re
plenish their depleted memberships
and bring them to a total of above
30 each. All the clubs suffered a
severe loss of members last Spring
and Summer Quarters when gradu
ation took a great many and the
Army and Naval Reserve programs
suddenly called many more.
The lack of club members eating
on the Commons last week necessi
tated a meeting between Commons
club presidents and Frank F. Walk
er, financial vice-president of the
University, to discuss rushing plans.
FOUR-POINT PROGRAM
The group decided on four points:
1. That all the clubs should at
tempt to build their memberships to
25-30 regular eating members dur
ing the next three weeks.
2. Due to the labor shortage in the
Encina kitchen the clubs decided to
do their own janitorial work.
3. On a near date in the future the
clubs will pay. for meals equivalent
to 75 per cent of their membership
rather than for just 13 meals regard
less of membership as in the past.
4. For the first three weeks of the
quarter, at least, no breakfasts will
be served clubs. Because of the few
men who eat breakfast, eventually
just one club will be opened in the
morning for all club members who
wish to eat breakfast.
DEMAND GREAT
The demand for eating places on
the campus has become so great, ac
cording to Mr. Walker, due to lack
of transportation, it is necessary that
clubs operate at full capacity to ab
sorb the demand. Those clubs that
fail to build their membership may
find it necessary to give over their
clubroom to un-affiliated boarders
who would make arrangements
through the Encina kitchen.
El Cuadro, with only eight mem
bers, is facing the prospect of
pledging 20 new members in three
weeks.
Breakers, dormant for a week, due
to a shortage of members, was still
undecided last night as to plans, ac
cording to Ed McCain, club mana
ger.
SECOND MEETING
A second meeting of club presi
dents with Mr. Walker will be held
sometime during the next week.
Inter-club council president Ray
Hammett, before leaving for the
East, authorized council vice-presi
dent John Youle to call a meeting,
thoueh as yet one hasn't been
scheduled.
The subject of the number of
meals for which a club must pay
every day regardless of the number
of students eating will probably be
discussed at this second meeting.
Clubs in the past have paid for at
least 13 meals even if the number
eating was less.
The only visible indication of pres
ent club strength came from intra
mural sign-ups which show El Capi
tal!. El Toro, and El Campo antici
pating a heavy schedule of mural
sports.

tated a meeting between Commons
club presidents and Frank F. Walk
er, financial vice-president of the
University, to discuss rushing plans.
FOUR-POINT PROGRAM
The group decided on four points:
1. That all the clubs should at
tempt to build their memberships to
25-30 regular eating members dur
ing the next three weeks.
2. Due to the labor shortage in the
Encina kitchen the clubs decided to
do their own janitorial work.
3. On a near date in the future the
clubs will pay. for meals equivalent
to 75 per cent of their membership
rather than for just 13 meals regard
less of membership as in the past.
4. For the first three weeks of the
quarter, at least, no breakfasts will
be served clubs. Because of the few
men who eat breakfast, eventually
just one club will be opened in the
morning for all club members who
wish to eat breakfast.
DEMAND GREAT
The demand for eating places on
the campus has become so great, ac
cording to Mr. Walker, due to lack
of transportation, it is necessary that
clubs operate at full capacity to ab
sorb the demand. Those clubs that
fail to build their membership may
find it necessary to give over their
clubroom to un-affiliated boarders
who would make arrangements
through the Encina kitchen.
El Cuadro, with only eight mem
bers, is facing the prospect of
pledging 20 new members in three
weeks.
Breakers, dormant for a week, due
to a shortage of members, was still
undecided last night as to plans, ac
cording to Ed McCain, club mana
ger.
SECOND MEETING
A second meeting of club presi
dents with Mr. Walker will be held
sometime during the next week.
Inter-club council president Ray
Hammett, before leaving for the
East, authorized council vice-presi
dent John Youle to call a meeting,
thoueh as yet one hasn't been
scheduled.
The subject of the number of
meals for which a club must pay
every day regardless of the number
of students eating will probably be
discussed at this second meeting.
Clubs in the past have paid for at
least 13 meals even if the number
eating was less.
The only visible indication of pres
ent club strength came from intra
mural sign-ups which show El Capi
tal!. El Toro, and El Campo antici
pating a heavy schedule of mural
sports.
Continuing a period of intensified
rushing, Stanford's seven eating
clubs this week endeavored to re
plenish their depleted memberships
and bring them to a total of above
30 each. All the clubs suffered a
severe loss of members last Spring
and Summer Quarters when gradu
ation took a great many and the
Army and Naval Reserve programs
suddenly called many more.
The lack of club members eating
on the Commons last week necessi
tated a meeting between Commons
