"WAR EFFORT, Information Manual for San Francisco" by James Ladd
Delkin, 50 cents at The Stanford Bookstore and most newsstands.
For anyone who has had to deal.*

with San Francisco agencies con
nected with the war effort, this
pocket-sized guide is a God-send.
And for anyone who contemplates
contacting them; it is almost a
necessity.
About the beginning of the sum
mer, Mr. Delkin, a Stanford alumnus,
who has published several guides
to San Francisco and neighboring
vicinities, decided it was time the
duties and functions of the various
war agencies and programs were
straightened out for the layman.
COMPLETE COVERAGE
The concise booklet just released
covers all U.S. Government Offices,
including news agencies, Civilian
Defense, local public and private or
ganizations, women and youth acti
vities, war effort programs, the
USO, employment, training, salvage,
and so on.
It's easy and handy to use, con
taining a master key at the bottom
of each page and a complete alpha
betical index. Mr. Delkin has left
room for notes at the end of each
section.
The most amazing thing about the
booklet is its completeness. Not only
does it contain every aspect of the
war effort in San Francisco, but the
addresses and phone numbers of ev
ery organization and a brief explan
atory note of the function each
performs.
lIOW TO GET IN WAVES
Topic covered range from Federal
Commissions and dim-out regula
tions to qualifications for the
WAACS and the WAVES. A special
article at the end of the booklet was
written by Bill Irwin, son of Stan
ford's noted graduate, Will Irwin.
Young Irwin, a shipyard worker,
has commented on this occupation's
role in defense, and he has included
a list of shipyard jargon.
Among the little known facts Del
kin has revealed is the eligibility of
women to volunteer for the State
Guard, and that this is the first time
in 40 years that the Navy has asked
for relief in helping its own.

Mr. Delkin has compiled this in
formation manual with the idea that
"San Francisco Is Worth Fighting
For," and he has made clear the
activities of all who are fighting for
San Francisco and the nation.
