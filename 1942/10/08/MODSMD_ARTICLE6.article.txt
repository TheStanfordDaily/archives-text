### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 7 (U.R)â€”Easing of
city zoning restrictions as an aid to
the acute housing problem of war
workers was proposed tonight by
Mayor William F. Devin. who out
lined a three-fold plan of action.
Devin said he would favor new
building codes which would permit
use of vacant store buildings as tem
porary residences and allow interior
remodeling of residences hitherto
restricted to one family for use as
multiple family dwellings.
He declared also the city would
bend every effort in pressing its ap
plication with the federal govern
ment for funds to construct 2500
houses on city-owned property and
in war industrial areas.
