# Stamp Drive Falls Short Of Objective
## Students Buy $800 Of War Securities, Missing $1500 Quota 
### 
The Stanford campus fell an esti
mated $700 short of its War Stamp
quota yesterday. Although complete
reports were not available last night,
Nancy Pelton, acting chairman of
the War Funds committee of the
SWB, estimated total sales at $800.
Miss Pelton and Don Shannon,
head of fraternity representatives,
believe that by next week the sell
ing organization will be complete
and everyone will be contacted.
They agreed that next week's sales
should far exceed this week's show
ing which did not reach many living
groups.
NINE PERFECT
Nine fraternities bought 100 per
cent: A.K.L., Alpha Sig (in addition
to buying a bond), Kappa Sig, Fiji,
Phi Kap, S.A.E., Theta Chi, Theta
Delt, and Theta Xi.
In the sororities, the A.O.Pi's
boosted sales $16.25 to take a strong
lead in the 100 per cent column.
Other sororities which hit 100 per
cent were Chi O, Delta Gamma,
Gamma Phi, Alpha Phi, and Pi Phi.
The Kappas who were caught with
no organization pledged 100 per cent.
Lagunita averaged 57 per cent
buyingt $62.75 worth of stamps.
Olivo was the highest among the
casas with 70 per cent.
MARIPOSA LEADS
Mariposa led the Union group with
100 per cent.
"Stamp purchasers buying on the
Quad and through booths in the
Union and the Library responded
wonderfully, increasing the sales by
$500," Miss Pelton announced.
One $50 and three $25 bonds were
sold over the booths on the campus.
