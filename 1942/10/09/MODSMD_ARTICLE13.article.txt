### 
BOSTON, Oct. 8 (U.R) — Acting
Secretary of State Sumner Welles
declared tonight the refusal of Ar
gentina and Chile to sever relations
with the Axis is permitting the other
American republics to be "stabbed
in the back" by enemy agents oper
ating freely within their borders.
Noting with "profound gratitude
and renewed encouragement" that
18 other Western Hemisphere na
tions are solidly behind the United
I States, he told the National Foi'eign
I Trade Convention that the "remain
ing two republics—an obvious ref
erence to Chile and Argentina—are
still permitting their territory to be
utilized by Axis emissaries "as a
base for hostile activities against
I their neighbors."
