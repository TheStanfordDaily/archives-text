Emphasizing that the stamina and
courage of youth may be the de-
J ciding factor in battle, Adjutant
General James A. Ulio—for the sec
[ ond time within a week—called
j upon young Americans to join their
I youthful British and Russian com
patriots on the war fronts.

Some quarters expect the request
I to be presented this week, probably
by Secretary of War Henry L. Stim
