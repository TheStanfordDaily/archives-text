Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
Stanford is a 5-2 underdog at
oSuth Bend tomorrow when Coach
Marchie Schwartz takes a band of
Indian footballers into the Stadium
of his alma mater, University of
Notre Dame.
The Fighting Irish, slam-bang
eleven that won the Western Cham
pionship in 1936. 37, and 38, is not
a top-heavy favorite that it might I
have been had the teams met last
year. Instead, those who offer to
wager on the outcome have slighted
the South Benders and made them
only a measly 2V&-1.
A wire from Tom Carvey, senior
manager, tells the story from Chi- I
cago:
"Had completely uneventful trip.
Bob Hall and Dave Brown are
okeh and ready to play. Roger
Laverly pulled a muscle and may
not play. Buck Fawcett's ankle
responded to heat treatment and
is also ready. Sandv Banks, re
serve end, is here. Darwin Seclcy
has a bad eye infection and will
be taken to specialist in Chicago.
Tony Medvcd will back up Milt
Vucinich at center. Schwartz is
busy working on defense. A chalk
talk is scheduled for Friday morn- .
iiur. Odds here give tSanford 11
points."
Harry Shipkey met the team at
CI licago with a good scout report!
from the Notre Dame-Georgia Tech
game of the week before, which the
Irish dropped, 13-6. Carvey added
that pictures of the 1942 Bronco
game were shown on the train.
Stanford has not had any body
contact work since the Santa Clara
game and benefited by the three
day train ride to the windy city ]
where they scrimmaged yesterday. I
Though Carvey did not say it, the
Indians will probably scrimmage
again this morning.
