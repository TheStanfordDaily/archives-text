MOSCOW. Oct. !) (UP).—Stalin
grad's defenders annihilated four
Herman battalions (2.000 men) ami
destroyed 16 tanks Thursday but
were forced to fall back from two
streets in a suburban community,
llu- high command announced today.
Meanwhile a Russian relief army
bearing down on Stalingrad from
the northwest pounded the exposed
German left flank with artillery,
routed the Nazis from defensive
trenches and destroyed 11 block
houses and a company of infantry,
the Soviet Thursday midnight com
munique reported.
(There still was nothing in official
Soviet dispatches to confirm a Ber
lin radio announcement that the
Germans are abandoning frontal as
saults on Stalingrad. A broadcast
of DNB, official German news ag
ency, had said that since the major
German objectives at Stalingrad
had been "achieved," it is "no longer
necessary that the rest of the city
be captured by storm." Instead,
Berlin said, the rest of Stalingrad
will be destroyed by heavy artil
lery.)
Although the communique re
ported only that the Russians were
making a stonewall stand in Sta
lingrad, broken by the retreat in
the outlying area, supplementary
front dispatches indicated that the
whole German plan for crushing
Stalingrad was falling apart. They
reported steady progress in the Rus
sian advance from the northwest
and s.iid that in one big battle out
side the city, 45,000 Germans paced
by elite Prussian shock troops were
routed in disorders from a north
western industrial district.

Before the loss of main rubber
sources, tires and tubes consumed
75 per cent of United States rubber.
