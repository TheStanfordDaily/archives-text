# Encina Men Take Over K.P. Duties During Labor Shortage
## 
### NEWT WISE 
The labor shortage spread from
the fields and canneries last week
and settled right in the Encina
kitchen when volunteers were re
quested from the frosh class to act as
pot washers to cover a shortage
which arose at thy last minute.
This may be a common occur
rence in the future and it will prob
ably be necessary, according to Miss
Doris Braddock, director of the En
cina Dining Hall, to employ student
labor on 2 to 4-hour shifts to re
place those men who have been
taken by the Army.
The frosh who volunteered, work
ing Sunday, were David glees, Herb
Eagleston, Ashton Gardiner, Ernest
Masler, Thom Power, and Hay
Wheeler.
MAN HOURS SHORT
The kitchen is 54 man hours short
in comparison to last year, Miss
Braddock stated. The Encina dining
hall was originally designed to em
ploy only three women, however,
since the advent of the war it has
been necessary to employ an in
creasing number until at present

there are nine women working, and
a demand for two more full-time
workers.
There are but two men left in the
kitchen which may make it neces
sary in time to use student workers
in half-day shifts. The kitchen
could use at least four men students
on more than two-hour shifts.
Labor shortages in the local dairies
are threatening the frosh's supply of
milk; yesterday's delivery was 100
bottles short of the order. Although
not yet an actuality milk rationing
is "very close" Miss Braddock said.
MEAT RATIONING
Since the beginning of the quarter
a voluntary rationing of meat has
been in effect with an allotment of
2 x /> pounds a week to a person, which
has brought about meatless lunches
for the frosh and the Commons
clubs.
Peaches are out of the Encina diet
because the Army has taken all the
canned supply. Miss Braddock said
she hopes to be able to get 80 per
cent of last year's canned goods sup
ply, but is not sure she will be able
to.
