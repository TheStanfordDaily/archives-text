# Fall Quarter 'Dimes' Drive Starts Monday
## Rally Committee Sets $5500 as Goal For Diploma Fund 
### 
"Dimes" drive for the Fall Quar
ter will open Monday, announced
Ted Barr, Rally Committee member
and chairman of the drive.
On Monday evening, members of
the Rally Committee will circulate
among the living groups to solicit
dimes for the Dimes for Diplomas
scholarship fund. Contributions will
augment the Dimes fund, which has
set $5500 as its goal.
The campaign was instigated last
spring when it became apparent that
many men students within a quarter
of graduation, would be compelled
to leave school for armed services.
As many of them will be financially
unable to continue at Stanford after
the Victory, the Dimes program was
conceived to grant one-quarter
scholarships to 50 students thus
qualified.

Dimes will be collcctcd each Mon
day evening and results will be pub
lished, by houses, in tabular form,
in Wednesday's Daily, together with
results from the Tuesday stamp
drive.
