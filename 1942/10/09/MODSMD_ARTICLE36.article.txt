# War Changes Football Scene
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (U.R) — The
1912 football season already has
taken some abrupt turns and there
arc more upsets and changes ahead.
With the season moving into its
third week-end, these definite trends
stand.
1. The game is being taken away
from home town fans to meet war
11 ansportatiou regulations.
2. The list of major undefeated
college teams is much smaller than
usual.
The various service teams are
more than holding their own.
I. It's another season of offen
sive football, with the forward
pass again the biggest weapon.
So far as service teams are con
cerned. il looks now as if the lowa
Naval Cadets, Great Lakes and Jim
Crowley's North Carolina Pre-flight
teams are the top rankers. But there
will be others, perhaps just as good,
springing up in other sections.
Straight power plays still have
their place in the offensive picture,
but in the games played thus far the
forward pa; s hns done most of the
ground gaining and most of the
winning.
TK.WI RATINGS UPSET
The teams which were given pre
season ratings as the powerhouses
of their respective sections have been
among the upset victims. Minne
sota, Notre Dame, Pennsylvania,
Fordham, California, Tulane, Duke
and so on down the line.
But those Minnesota and Penn
sylvania defeats were something
rise again. They came at the hands
of the service teams which really
have been showing some of the col
lege elevens how football should'be
played.
There is a pretty strong feeling
that Minnesota and Pennsylvania
will do all right for the rest of the
season, with the Gophers perhaps
a; ain rating as the best college team
in the country.
A NNOUNCI. TWO ( 11A NOES
Two changes announced this week
show what difficulties are being en
countered. The Yale-Princeton game
was transferred to New York and
Ihe Rice-North Carolina game was
postponed for the duration, all be
cause of transportation problems.
Although no definite figures are
available, attendance so far this
season is down and sites are being
changed in the hope of attracting
more customers. More changes in
locations are being considered and
probably will be announced soon.
The one bad feature of taking the
games away from their home towns
is I hat the fans who long have sup
ported the clubs must go to extra
expense if they still wish to see
their favorites play. But war plays
no favorites, so all teams not located
in population centers are in the
same boat.

Straight power plays still have
their place in the offensive picture,

forward pa; s hns done most of the

TK.WI RATINGS UPSET
The teams which were given pre
season ratings as the powerhouses
of their respective sections have been
among the upset victims. Minne
sota, Notre Dame, Pennsylvania,
Fordham, California, Tulane, Duke
and so on down the line.
But those Minnesota and Penn
sylvania defeats were something
rise again. They came at the hands
of the service teams which really
have been showing some of the col
lege elevens how football should'be
played.
There is a pretty strong feeling
that Minnesota and Pennsylvania
will do all right for the rest of the
season, with the Gophers perhaps
a; ain rating as the best college team
in the country.
A NNOUNCI. TWO ( 11A NOES
Two changes announced this week
show what difficulties are being en
countered. The Yale-Princeton game
was transferred to New York and
Ihe Rice-North Carolina game was
postponed for the duration, all be
cause of transportation problems.
Although no definite figures are
available, attendance so far this
season is down and sites are being
changed in the hope of attracting
more customers. More changes in
locations are being considered and
probably will be announced soon.
The one bad feature of taking the
games away from their home towns
is I hat the fans who long have sup
ported the clubs must go to extra
expense if they still wish to see
their favorites play. But war plays
no favorites, so all teams not located
in population centers are in the
same boat.
NEW YORK, Oct. 8 (U.R) — The
1912 football season already has
taken some abrupt turns and there
arc more upsets and changes ahead.
With the season moving into its
third week-end, these definite trends
stand.
1. The game is being taken away
from home town fans to meet war
11 ansportatiou regulations.
2. The list of major undefeated
college teams is much smaller than
usual.
The various service teams are
more than holding their own.
I. It's another season of offen
sive football, with the forward
pass again the biggest weapon.
So far as service teams are con
cerned. il looks now as if the lowa
Naval Cadets, Great Lakes and Jim
Crowley's North Carolina Pre-flight
teams are the top rankers. But there
will be others, perhaps just as good,
springing up in other sections.
