# Johnston Leads Menlo Against Frosh in Opener
## First Wilcox Team Ready But Untried 
### ZIP WALT 
A new coach, Francis Wilcox, ]
guiding liis i irst college squad, and j
an untried team, the Stanford
Freshmen, hope to pnt their untried I
talents together tomorrow when the>
kick off to Menlo Junior College at j
2:.'JO in the Stadium. Admission to j
the game is free.
Menlo has a slight advantage in
that it already has one game under
its belt, and therefore may be a
more lit team. Menlo met the United
States Coast Guard Rambler squad
10 days ago, losing G-0. Outstanding
for the Oaks is Neele Johnston, for
mer Stanford varsity contender for |
quarterback, who, after becoming
ineligible for the Card team, regis
tered at the nearby J.C. He plays
fullback.
The yearlings, using the T forma
tion, have a good solid first string,
but the reserves are weak. Two very
important cogs in the frosh machine
have just been declared ineligible.
Sid Smith, who was giving Dick
Flatland a hard light for the center
position is out, along with John
Wipple, second string fullback.
AGNEW OUT
These losses create quite a prob
lem for Wilcox, for with Bill Agnew I
on the sidelines with a sore leg,
Steve Tish is now called upon to
carry the fullback position by him- j
self. Homer Hamlin, All-P.AJj.
from San Jose, was converted to the
halfback spot, but is able to fill in at
fullback. Flatland is now alone at
center, his only substitutes being
very light boys.
A big battle has resulted at right
tackle between Ted Burk and Bob
Berryman. Burk did not show up
for practice until last week, and in a
short time proved his worth and
ability. Berryman was holding down
the spot until Burk arrived, and is i
still considered a standout.
BROWNSON PASSES
Jack Brownson holds down the
important quarterback position and
is capably relieved by Jay McKie, an
All-Bay League star, from Redondo
High School. Brownson was hailed
as one of the best high school passers
in the nation, and should the ground j
â– ittnck fail, he will have little trouble j
taking to the air. He has capable !
I ends in Frank Wigmore on the !
j right and Bob Rohrer on the left, i
George Rasmussen and Frank Hef- ;
felfingcr are more than adequate j
substitutes.
Fastest man on the team is Lloyd
Merriman at the speed post, left
halfback. Merriman is capable of a
breakaway and is always dangerous.
Mark Heffelfinger has a slight edge
over Hamlin on the right side. Ham
j lin will have a busy afternoon if he
| has to replace Tish at fullback and
I Heffelfinger at half. Ben Cassinerio,
j a small 150-pound, five-foot-six- |
inch scat back, may see some action >
if he is fully recovered from a minor i
injury.

signal drill.
