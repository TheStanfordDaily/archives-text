"The importance of small craft
today in commando raids and es
capes cannot be overemphasized,"
said Mr. Wallace Claussen, assistant
national director of Red Cross wa
ter safety and small craft, as he
spoke before some two hundred
girls gathered at the women's pool
yesterday afternoon to watch a ca
noe i ng demonstration.
Demonstrating the correct posi
tion and paddling techniques for a
canoe, he also stressed the impor
tance of staying with the craft when
it is capsized or swamped. In quick
succession he showed the girls how
to right a capsized canoe, empty
the water out, climb in and paddle
it back to shore.
"To maneuver a canoe efficiently
without flailing the water on either
side, biffing your partner on the

head, and pouring water clown his
neck is just a matter of practice and
teamwork," he concluded.
Mr. Claussen, who was the coach
for Olympic canoeing teams, was
assisted by Mr. Pierce, field repre
sentative for Northern California.
Mr. Claussen has come out from
the East to train Army and Navy
men in handling small craft for
