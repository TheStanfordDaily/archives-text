### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 9 (UP).— Tough
conference tilts and rugged inter
sectional battles command major
attention as college football finally
comes into its own tomorrow
throughout the nation.
The Mid-West comes up with an
unusually heavy program, head
lined by two crunching Big Ten
bouts and two intersectional lu'awls.
In the South there are three tough
Southeastern Conference games and
on the West Coast the Pacific Coast
Conference stages three big tilts.
The East finds several strong sec
tional candidates meeting their first
major test.
The two outstanding intersec
tional games have the home clubs—
Notre Dame and Ohio State fa
vored over Stanford and Southern
California respectively, with the
Irish an 8-5 choice despite a poor
start. In the Big Ten it's Illinois-
Minnesota and Northwestern-Pur
due, with Minnesota's Gophers and
the Northwestern Wildcats favored.
Also in the Mid-West Bernie
Bierman's hardy lowa Pre-flight
eleven is a 7-5 choice over power
packed Michigan; Great Lakes is
touted over Pitt, lowa over Camp
Grant, lowa State over Marquette,
Indiana over Nebraska and Wis
consin over Missouri.
