### BOB SONTAG 
STANFORD OVER IRISH!
' It's growing like fresh fruit.
It's coming up from under, out
from over, and from the middle of
in between. It's streaming over
the campus and leaking into Paly,
even into seme southermost parts
c( S:in Francisco —the zany idea
that Stanford could trump Notre
Dame tomorrow at South Bend.
Well, how about it?
One hates to sell the hometown
team short in any game, even against
Notre Dame.
But this department watched last
week's practice and the week's be
fore and came away with a story
that would wring tears from Boris
Karloff and a face as long as one of
those pooches that's born under a
bureau. Stanford absolutely did not
look any better than it did at the
start, except for one thing: The
new men who didn't break into the
Cougar game were given their
chances and not found wanting.
Every man that can do anything
on the football field is back there
and will be in uniform ready to get
Stanford out from behind an eight
ball that's getting so big it may cover
up the T.
This year Notre Dame is not quite
what it used to be. Regardless of
the fact that Dippy Evans will prob
ably pick splinters from his mole
skins throughout the afternoon, the
odds shouldn't go overboard on
Frank Leahy's boys.
The Irish have yet to win.
Stanford has yet to win. Notre
Dame is no hall of fire. Imagine
tossing over a formation that
hears the name of your own alma
mater. The Notre I)ame System,
instituted by Knute Dockne, was
switched in favor of the T forma
tion especially for Angelo Bertclli,
the Notre Dame passing demon.
Bertelli, oddly enough, has not
connected in quite the fashion that
Leahy expected of him and is prob
ably not a great deal more potent
than Stanford's own pitchers, Ray
Hammett and Mark Caffall.
Jerry Cowhig, the Irish full, is
hailed as a new Norm Standlee by
the boys back East, but we fear that
Jimmy Mello will be much the bet
ter when the game gets under way.
Cowhig is nursing an injury sus
tained before the opening game
against Wisconsin and may not be
quite ready for a full game.
Bill Earley, no relation of Steven
Early on account of that e, hasn't
begun to live up to pre-season
reputation and another outsider
who will be his satellite pro tem is
Creightcn Miller, who was a lead
ing ground-gainer last week when
Georgia Tech thumped Notre
Dame, 13-6. That loss may start
the Irish on their way to a de
feated season for a change.
We're too used to hearing about
Notre Dame as undefeated, untied,
un this and un that. And it's a darn
good gamble that Stanford can keep
that upset list going.
Any guy in his sane old self will
have to admit that when Notre Dame
and Stanford have at it tomorrow.
Coach Marchie Schwartz' boys have
a good chance to push the Irish
heads deeper down into that all
failing dope bucket, which this year
seems to be on the verge of being
thrown out of all the experts' an
cient anti-iluke laboratories—there
just isn't any real dope any more.
Even Stanford can win tomorrow.

I OCAL FRONT:
J Iluss Peck, Stanford's junior
A.A.U vault champ, is on his way
into the Army Air Corps or some
branch of the service . . . One of the
Ileffelfi liger boys, whom you can
see tomorrow afternoon against
Menlo J.C. in the Stadium, keeps
dead heads in his room to frighten
away unwanted visitors, etcetera.
And we said dead heads, not dead
heads . . . That Look photog should
have dropped around the Farm last
year when Coach Everett Dean had
a championship team under wing;
Howie Dallmar, Ed Voss, and Jack
Dana are still here to go to it Mon
day when practice starts, but Jimmy
Pollard, Don Burness. and Bill Cow
den have flown ... 11. D. Thoreau,
sports ed on the last volume's Daily,
gave a speech last night to the new
tryoutces.
