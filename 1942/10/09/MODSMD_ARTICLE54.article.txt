NOTRE DAME * STANFORD
Dove, Boh LE Norherg, Hank
Dove. All-American end last year, was shifted to guard and back to end
after the Wisconsin game. A senior, defense in his dish; dangerous at
snaring passers and runners behind the line; also Angelo Bertelli's fleet
receiver. Norberg, two-year letterman is undependable. Injuries have kept
him down. He shares the end position with Dave Brown, who will see
action. EDGE TO DOVE.
Rymkus, Louis LT Staintn, Ed
Rymkus must fill the shoes of last year's powerful Jim Brutz, stands
six-foot four, weight 228. Louis has been kept, out of hard play by a knee
injury. Stamm, another T vet, is link No. 1 in the "tackle to tackle wall"
which has breathed the air of Pasadena. His experience will count. EDGE
TO STAMM.
Mcßride, Boh LG Taylor. Charles (Capt.)
Mcßride, an all-state Ohio high school product whose main line is de
fense, was originally a fullback, shifted by Leahy to the line; rugged but
lacks experience. Taylor is Stanford's All-American lor '42. LDGE r IO
TAYLOR.
Brock. Thomas C Vucinieh, Milt
Brock will be behind the 8-ball Saturday. He is filling in for the injured
Walt Ziemba. He won a letter last year and has been No. 2 man long |
enough to absorb the Leahy system. Vucinieh, shifted from fullback to
center this season, is having his hands full trying to approach the play of
last year's center, Vic Lindskog. NO EDGE.
Wright. Harry RG LaPrade, Loren
LaPrade has an injured toe but is expected to be at top-flight against
the Irish. Wright is a great downficld blocker and former backfield man.
Very close. EDGE TO LaPRADE.
Higgins, Luke RT Banducci, Bruno
liiggins is a soph, unexperienced. He is taking over for Bob Neff. Ban
ducci is another link in the Indian stonewall forwards. EDGE TO BAN
DUCCI.
Murphy, George (Capt.) RE Ilall. Bob
Murphy started in six out of nine games last year, played 277 minutes.
Also a great catcher for Bertelli. Hall is perhaps one of the Farm's best
sophs. He has played well and while favoring an injured ankle will be no
match for Murphy. EDGE TO MURPIIY.
Bertelli, Angelo QB Hammett, Ray
Bertelli is a top passer, one of the nation's best. He completed 70 out of
123 last season, gaining 1027 yards. Hammett, despite his critics, is learning
the T business fast. EDGE TO BERTELLI.
Livingstone, Boh L!I Sandennan, Fred
Soph Livingstone is a shifty runner with an all-state record from In
diana behind him. Running is his like, also good pass snatcher, but he
will have to go far to adequately replace Dipp Evans, out on an injury.
Look for another soph, Tom Miller, to help here. Sanderman is a new face
on the Redskin roster. His excellent play against Santa Clara in the second
half rates him the first-string spot over Don Zappettini. LDGE TO LIV
INGSTONE.
Farley, Bill RH Sheller, Bill
Earley is small and was a main replacement for the spot vacated by Steve
Juswik. He was responsible for the win over USC two yer.rs ago by knock
ing down a pass with only 10 seconds to go. An excellent pass receiver.
Sheller, Stanford's bettcr-than-average kicker, hits the first-string this
year. His line bucks are betting better as he goes alonrj. EDGE 10
EARLEY.
Cowliig, Jerry IB Fawcett. Buck
Cowhig missed the first two games but will be ready and able tomorrow.
Notre Dame claims he's the nearest thing to a new Norm Standlee. Faw
cett has been the only of the T boys to show some of the real spark of that
original model-T. His end runs make him the best Stanford ground
gainer. Counting in Cowhig's recent injury, EDGE TO FAWCETT.
TEAM EDGE: Stantord 5. Notre Dame 5, and 1 even.
FINAL SCORE: Stanford 14-13.

LaPrade has an injured toe but is expected to be at top-flight against
the Irish. Wright is a great downficld blocker and former backfield man.
Very close. EDGE TO LaPRADE.

liiggins is a soph, unexperienced. He is taking over for Bob Neff. Ban
ducci is another link in the Indian stonewall forwards. EDGE TO BAN
DUCCI.
Murphy, George (Capt.) RE Ilall. Bob
Murphy started in six out of nine games last year, played 277 minutes.
Also a great catcher for Bertelli. Hall is perhaps one of the Farm's best
sophs. He has played well and while favoring an injured ankle will be no
match for Murphy. EDGE TO MURPIIY.
Bertelli, Angelo QB Hammett, Ray
Bertelli is a top passer, one of the nation's best. He completed 70 out of
123 last season, gaining 1027 yards. Hammett, despite his critics, is learning
the T business fast. EDGE TO BERTELLI.
Livingstone, Boh L!I Sandennan, Fred
Soph Livingstone is a shifty runner with an all-state record from In
diana behind him. Running is his like, also good pass snatcher, but he
will have to go far to adequately replace Dipp Evans, out on an injury.
Look for another soph, Tom Miller, to help here. Sanderman is a new face
on the Redskin roster. His excellent play against Santa Clara in the second
half rates him the first-string spot over Don Zappettini. LDGE TO LIV
INGSTONE.
Farley, Bill RH Sheller, Bill
Earley is small and was a main replacement for the spot vacated by Steve
Juswik. He was responsible for the win over USC two yer.rs ago by knock
ing down a pass with only 10 seconds to go. An excellent pass receiver.
Sheller, Stanford's bettcr-than-average kicker, hits the first-string this
year. His line bucks are betting better as he goes alonrj. EDGE 10
EARLEY.
Cowliig, Jerry IB Fawcett. Buck
Cowhig missed the first two games but will be ready and able tomorrow.
Notre Dame claims he's the nearest thing to a new Norm Standlee. Faw
cett has been the only of the T boys to show some of the real spark of that
original model-T. His end runs make him the best Stanford ground

TEAM EDGE: Stantord 5. Notre Dame 5, and 1 even.

Sheller, Stanford's bettcr-than-average kicker, hits the first-string this
year. His line bucks are betting better as he goes alonrj. EDGE 10
EARLEY.
Cowliig, Jerry IB Fawcett. Buck
Cowhig missed the first two games but will be ready and able tomorrow.
Notre Dame claims he's the nearest thing to a new Norm Standlee. Faw
cett has been the only of the T boys to show some of the real spark of that
original model-T. His end runs make him the best Stanford ground
gainer. Counting in Cowhig's recent injury, EDGE TO FAWCETT.
TEAM EDGE: Stantord 5. Notre Dame 5, and 1 even.
FINAL SCORE: Stanford 14-13.

Stanford-Notre Dame interactional football game at South Bend, Ind.)
NOTRE DAME * STANFORD
Dove, Boh LE Norherg, Hank
Dove. All-American end last year, was shifted to guard and back to end
after the Wisconsin game. A senior, defense in his dish; dangerous at
snaring passers and runners behind the line; also Angelo Bertelli's fleet
receiver. Norberg, two-year letterman is undependable. Injuries have kept
him down. He shares the end position with Dave Brown, who will see
action. EDGE TO DOVE.
Rymkus, Louis LT Staintn, Ed
Rymkus must fill the shoes of last year's powerful Jim Brutz, stands
six-foot four, weight 228. Louis has been kept, out of hard play by a knee
injury. Stamm, another T vet, is link No. 1 in the "tackle to tackle wall"
which has breathed the air of Pasadena. His experience will count. EDGE
TO STAMM.
Mcßride, Boh LG Taylor. Charles (Capt.)
Mcßride, an all-state Ohio high school product whose main line is de
fense, was originally a fullback, shifted by Leahy to the line; rugged but
lacks experience. Taylor is Stanford's All-American lor '42. LDGE r IO
TAYLOR.
Brock. Thomas C Vucinieh, Milt
Brock will be behind the 8-ball Saturday. He is filling in for the injured
Walt Ziemba. He won a letter last year and has been No. 2 man long |
enough to absorb the Leahy system. Vucinieh, shifted from fullback to
center this season, is having his hands full trying to approach the play of
last year's center, Vic Lindskog. NO EDGE.
Wright. Harry RG LaPrade, Loren
LaPrade has an injured toe but is expected to be at top-flight against
the Irish. Wright is a great downficld blocker and former backfield man.
Very close. EDGE TO LaPRADE.
Higgins, Luke RT Banducci, Bruno
liiggins is a soph, unexperienced. He is taking over for Bob Neff. Ban
ducci is another link in the Indian stonewall forwards. EDGE TO BAN
DUCCI.
Murphy, George (Capt.) RE Ilall. Bob
Murphy started in six out of nine games last year, played 277 minutes.
Also a great catcher for Bertelli. Hall is perhaps one of the Farm's best
sophs. He has played well and while favoring an injured ankle will be no
match for Murphy. EDGE TO MURPIIY.
Bertelli, Angelo QB Hammett, Ray
Bertelli is a top passer, one of the nation's best. He completed 70 out of
123 last season, gaining 1027 yards. Hammett, despite his critics, is learning
the T business fast. EDGE TO BERTELLI.
Livingstone, Boh L!I Sandennan, Fred
Soph Livingstone is a shifty runner with an all-state record from In
diana behind him. Running is his like, also good pass snatcher, but he
will have to go far to adequately replace Dipp Evans, out on an injury.
Look for another soph, Tom Miller, to help here. Sanderman is a new face
on the Redskin roster. His excellent play against Santa Clara in the second
half rates him the first-string spot over Don Zappettini. LDGE TO LIV
INGSTONE.
Farley, Bill RH Sheller, Bill
Earley is small and was a main replacement for the spot vacated by Steve
Juswik. He was responsible for the win over USC two yer.rs ago by knock
ing down a pass with only 10 seconds to go. An excellent pass receiver.
Sheller, Stanford's bettcr-than-average kicker, hits the first-string this
year. His line bucks are betting better as he goes alonrj. EDGE 10
