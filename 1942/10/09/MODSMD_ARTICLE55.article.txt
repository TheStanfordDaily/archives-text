# Comedian's Son Killed in Crash
## 
### 
DETROIT, Oct. 8 (UP).—The ear
to-ear smile that for years has char
acterized the face of Joe E. Brown
was gone tonight as the comedian
planned to board a plane for Palm
Springs, Calif., where his son, Capt.
Don E. Brown, was killed in an
Army airplane crash today.
The young pilot was engaged in a
routine operation when the plane
plummeted to the ground near the
desert resort, superior officers said.
Brown attended the University of
California at Los Angeles where he
was student body president and
played on the U.C.L.A. football team,
winning his letter although too light
for a regular post on the team. He
played in the line.
His father long had been inter
ested in university affairs and vir
tually adopted several members of
the U.C.L.A. football team, among
them Mike Frankovitch, star grid
and baseball player who later mar
ried Binnie Barnes of the films.
Reports from the scene of the
crash said that both motors of the
attack bomber apparently went out
and the plane nosed into the ground.
Brown was flying alone at the time
of the crash.
Young Brown joined the Army's
infantry reserve in January, 1039,
and was commissioned a second
lieutenant in the Air Corps on
July 11, 1941. Only a few months
ago he was raised to the rank of
captain.
The ferry command said that a
board of officers has been sent to
the desert resort to investigate the
cause of the crash. No funeral ar
rangements were announced imme
diately.
The comedian has several other
children including another grown
son, Joe, Jr., who also is in the
armed service. Only a few months
ago the two sons held a reunion
with their father and mother when
both received leave from their mili
tary duties.

DETROIT, Oct. 8 (UP).—The ear
to-ear smile that for years has char
acterized the face of Joe E. Brown
was gone tonight as the comedian
planned to board a plane for Palm
Springs, Calif., where his son, Capt.
Don E. Brown, was killed in an
Army airplane crash today.
The young pilot was engaged in a
routine operation when the plane
plummeted to the ground near the
desert resort, superior officers said.
Brown attended the University of
California at Los Angeles where he
was student body president and
played on the U.C.L.A. football team,
winning his letter although too light
for a regular post on the team. He
played in the line.
His father long had been inter
ested in university affairs and vir
tually adopted several members of
the U.C.L.A. football team, among
them Mike Frankovitch, star grid
and baseball player who later mar
ried Binnie Barnes of the films.
Reports from the scene of the
crash said that both motors of the
attack bomber apparently went out
and the plane nosed into the ground.
Brown was flying alone at the time
of the crash.
Young Brown joined the Army's
infantry reserve in January, 1039,
and was commissioned a second
lieutenant in the Air Corps on
July 11, 1941. Only a few months
ago he was raised to the rank of
captain.
The ferry command said that a
board of officers has been sent to
the desert resort to investigate the
cause of the crash. No funeral ar
rangements were announced imme
diately.
The comedian has several other
children including another grown
son, Joe, Jr., who also is in the
armed service. Only a few months
ago the two sons held a reunion
with their father and mother when
both received leave from their mili
tary duties.
