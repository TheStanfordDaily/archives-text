# Shaughnessy May Have Great Team
## 
### 
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy is do
-1 ing it again.
Back at the University of Mary- j
land, the "1" formation wizard is !
| turning out another quick-breaking i
miracle team like Stanford's Rcse I
Bowl Indians of 1940.
Paced by little Tommy Mont, a
| slingshot quarterback with an arm
1 like Frankie Albert, the Terrapins j
i have swept through their first two j
! games in impressive fashion.
Sh&ughnessy's "T" formation
; clicked in convincing style as Mary
land breezed through Connecticut,
! 34-0. and downed a tough Lakehurst
' Naval Air Station team last week,
i 14-0.
Among the nation's top passei's,
i shifty Tommy Mont has completed
12 of 23 tosses for a total net gain
of 325 yards in two games.
Shaughnessy is sold on his quar
terback, even going so far as to
mention Mont in the same breath
with All-American Frankie Albert.
So far, Maryland has shown a
fast-breaking, versatile attack, and
one of the most rugged defenses in
the East. The Terps will face their
third opponent, a tough Rutgers
team, in Baltimore Stadium tomor
i row.
