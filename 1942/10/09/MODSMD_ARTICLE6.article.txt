# Both Teams Try For Initial Win

NOTRE DAME, Ind., Oct. 8 (Spe
cial to The Daily)—lt will be a
battle of the T-formations here in
Notre Dame stadium Saturday as
Stanford University's Indians and
Notre Dame's Irish each strive to
gain their initial victory of the 1942
football season.
Notre Dame's coach, Frank Leahy,
in his second season in the drivei - 's
seat, will be favored to drive his
1942 model-T over the finish line
ahead of first-year steresman
Marchie Schwartz. Both men have
found out this season that the favor
ites picked by the experts do not
necessarily win football games.
The only previous meeting be
tween the two teams was in 1925,
Notre Dame winning 27-10 in the
Rose Bowl game at Pasadena. The
Irish hopefuls will be striving to
maintain supremacy over the In
dians, who are coming East with
revenge in their hearts.
NOTRE DAME MEN
The Notre Dame lineup will size
up something like the one that made
the trip to the coast 17 years ago.
The backfield is light and the line
of only average weight. However
Coach Leahy definitely cannot boast
of Four Horsemen and Seven Mules.
The nearest thing the Irish mentor
has to a "Horseman" is Owen "Dip
py" Evans, leading scorer and
ground-gainer in 1941, who will
probably be out of Saturday's game.
Evans was injured on the first
play of the fall's first scrimmage
and has not even engaged in scrim
mage since. The popular belief
around the Irish campus is that the
loss of Evans meant the difference
between a victory and a tie with
Wisconsin and a victory and defeat
in the Georgia Tech tussle.
The Irish T did not get a chance to
show its full effectiveness in the
Wisconsin and Georgia Tech games.
Coach Leahy, despite the tie and
defeat, is well satisfied with the
squad and the new system. Showing
improvement in their ball-handling
nil along, the Irish should be ready
to prove Leahy's faith in them and
at the same time show the full worth
of the T-formation.
BERTELLIPASSES
Angelo Bertelli, shifted to quar
terback this year, has not lost any
of his effectiveness in forward pass
ing.
His failure to connect on so many
occasions can be blamed on the
team's lack of experience with the
new system. With two games ex
perience at the signal-calling spot,
"Bert" is due to resume his precision
passing of 1941 and that spells little
short of defeat for Stanford.
A heavy epidemic of backfield in
juries completely upset the Notre
Dame starting plans. Besides Evans,
Croighton Miller, Gerry Cowhig.
! ;<nd Bortelli have all been laid up at
one time or another. Miller and
Cowhig had been counted on as
first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
against the Yellowjackets last week.
He is expected to be ready to start
this Saturday and to show Stanford
the nearest thing to Norm Standlee j
they have seen. In the event Cow
hig's injury again withholds him i
from the starting lineup, Jim Mello,
who has been the most consistent ,
yardage-maker thus far, will again
start at the fullback slot.
EARLEY AT HALF
Bill Earley, pint-sized right half
back, has not yet begun to live up
to his pre-season form. The little !
West Virginian is a very fast run
ner and a good pass receiver. He is
a constant threat to opponents and
Stanford will be no exception. |
Creighton Miller, his injured ankle i
well healed, was one of the leading j
ground-gainers last week and will
see a lot of action Saturday as Ear
ley's replacement.
Sophomore Bob Livingstone and
Tom Miller, who have been dividing ;
the left half duties, will undoubtedly |
see a lot of action with Evans out. !
Livingston will probably draw the i
starting assignment.
Bob Dove, Ail-American end last !
year, after being tried at guard in j
spring and fall workouts was shifted
back to his regular position, left end. j
just before the season opened. It
wasn't because Bob failed at the
guard post that he was returned to j
end, but because he was needed
most at the terminal position.
MURPHY CAPTAINS
He is proving himself just as ef
fective as in 1941. Captain George
Murphy at right end teams with
Dove to give the Irish one of the
finest pairs of ends in the nation.
Both .pre standout players, offen
sively and defensively.
The Irish line coaches have had a
hard time finding capable replace
ments for tackles Lillis and Brutz
who were lost by graduation. Lou
Rymkus, 218-pound senior has played
excellent defensive ball thus far,
ending the work at the left side of
the line. The other tackle spot still
presents itself as a problem.
Bob Neff, a senior who started the
season on the first eleven has been
bothered by an injury, and is not
able to go at it full strength. Sopho
mores Ziggy Czarobski and Luke
Higgins lack experience but will
probably carry the brunt against
the Indians.
WRIGHT SHIFTED
Harry Wright was shifted from the
j backfield to the line to take up the
I slack left by the graduation of All-
American Bernie Crimmins. Wright,

who quarterbaeked last year's un
defeated team, has proven himself
just as valuable a blocker at his new
post.
Bob Mcßride, left guard, is an ex
cellent defensive player. Center
Walt Ziemba has been the outstand
ing Irish lineman to date but was in
jured and Tom Brock will start in
his place.
The season records for Stanford
and Notre Dame are the same, no
vitcories. After Saturday's game one
or the other is going to chalk one up
in the win column. Here at Notre
Dame, the popular conviction is that
the victory will not go back to the
Pacific Coast.

revenge in their hearts.
NOTRE DAME MEN
The Notre Dame lineup will size
up something like the one that made
the trip to the coast 17 years ago.
The backfield is light and the line
of only average weight. However
Coach Leahy definitely cannot boast
of Four Horsemen and Seven Mules.
The nearest thing the Irish mentor
has to a "Horseman" is Owen "Dip
py" Evans, leading scorer and
ground-gainer in 1941, who will
probably be out of Saturday's game.
Evans was injured on the first
play of the fall's first scrimmage
and has not even engaged in scrim
mage since. The popular belief
around the Irish campus is that the
loss of Evans meant the difference
between a victory and a tie with
Wisconsin and a victory and defeat
in the Georgia Tech tussle.
The Irish T did not get a chance to
show its full effectiveness in the
Wisconsin and Georgia Tech games.
Coach Leahy, despite the tie and
defeat, is well satisfied with the
squad and the new system. Showing
improvement in their ball-handling
nil along, the Irish should be ready
to prove Leahy's faith in them and
at the same time show the full worth
of the T-formation.
BERTELLIPASSES
Angelo Bertelli, shifted to quar
terback this year, has not lost any
of his effectiveness in forward pass
ing.
His failure to connect on so many
occasions can be blamed on the
team's lack of experience with the
new system. With two games ex
perience at the signal-calling spot,
"Bert" is due to resume his precision
passing of 1941 and that spells little
short of defeat for Stanford.
A heavy epidemic of backfield in
juries completely upset the Notre
Dame starting plans. Besides Evans,
Croighton Miller, Gerry Cowhig.
! ;<nd Bortelli have all been laid up at
one time or another. Miller and
Cowhig had been counted on as
first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
against the Yellowjackets last week.
He is expected to be ready to start
this Saturday and to show Stanford
the nearest thing to Norm Standlee j
they have seen. In the event Cow
hig's injury again withholds him i
from the starting lineup, Jim Mello,
who has been the most consistent ,
yardage-maker thus far, will again
start at the fullback slot.
EARLEY AT HALF
Bill Earley, pint-sized right half
back, has not yet begun to live up
to his pre-season form. The little !
West Virginian is a very fast run
ner and a good pass receiver. He is
a constant threat to opponents and
Stanford will be no exception. |
Creighton Miller, his injured ankle i
well healed, was one of the leading j
ground-gainers last week and will
see a lot of action Saturday as Ear
ley's replacement.
Sophomore Bob Livingstone and
Tom Miller, who have been dividing ;
the left half duties, will undoubtedly |
see a lot of action with Evans out. !
Livingston will probably draw the i
starting assignment.
Bob Dove, Ail-American end last !
year, after being tried at guard in j
spring and fall workouts was shifted
back to his regular position, left end. j
just before the season opened. It
wasn't because Bob failed at the
guard post that he was returned to j
end, but because he was needed
most at the terminal position.
MURPHY CAPTAINS
He is proving himself just as ef
fective as in 1941. Captain George
Murphy at right end teams with
Dove to give the Irish one of the
finest pairs of ends in the nation.
Both .pre standout players, offen
sively and defensively.
The Irish line coaches have had a
hard time finding capable replace
ments for tackles Lillis and Brutz
who were lost by graduation. Lou
Rymkus, 218-pound senior has played
excellent defensive ball thus far,
ending the work at the left side of
the line. The other tackle spot still
presents itself as a problem.
Bob Neff, a senior who started the
season on the first eleven has been
bothered by an injury, and is not
able to go at it full strength. Sopho
mores Ziggy Czarobski and Luke
Higgins lack experience but will
probably carry the brunt against
the Indians.
WRIGHT SHIFTED
Harry Wright was shifted from the
j backfield to the line to take up the
I slack left by the graduation of All-
American Bernie Crimmins. Wright,

who quarterbaeked last year's un
defeated team, has proven himself
just as valuable a blocker at his new
post.
Bob Mcßride, left guard, is an ex
cellent defensive player. Center
Walt Ziemba has been the outstand
ing Irish lineman to date but was in
jured and Tom Brock will start in
his place.
The season records for Stanford
and Notre Dame are the same, no
vitcories. After Saturday's game one
or the other is going to chalk one up
in the win column. Here at Notre
Dame, the popular conviction is that
the victory will not go back to the
Pacific Coast.

squad and the new system. Showing
improvement in their ball-handling
nil along, the Irish should be ready
to prove Leahy's faith in them and
at the same time show the full worth
of the T-formation.
BERTELLIPASSES
Angelo Bertelli, shifted to quar
terback this year, has not lost any
of his effectiveness in forward pass
ing.
His failure to connect on so many
occasions can be blamed on the
team's lack of experience with the
new system. With two games ex
perience at the signal-calling spot,
"Bert" is due to resume his precision
passing of 1941 and that spells little
short of defeat for Stanford.
A heavy epidemic of backfield in
juries completely upset the Notre
Dame starting plans. Besides Evans,
Croighton Miller, Gerry Cowhig.
! ;<nd Bortelli have all been laid up at
one time or another. Miller and
Cowhig had been counted on as
first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
against the Yellowjackets last week.
He is expected to be ready to start
this Saturday and to show Stanford
the nearest thing to Norm Standlee j
they have seen. In the event Cow
hig's injury again withholds him i
from the starting lineup, Jim Mello,
who has been the most consistent ,
yardage-maker thus far, will again
start at the fullback slot.
EARLEY AT HALF
Bill Earley, pint-sized right half
back, has not yet begun to live up
to his pre-season form. The little !
West Virginian is a very fast run
ner and a good pass receiver. He is
a constant threat to opponents and
Stanford will be no exception. |
Creighton Miller, his injured ankle i
well healed, was one of the leading j
ground-gainers last week and will
see a lot of action Saturday as Ear
ley's replacement.
Sophomore Bob Livingstone and
Tom Miller, who have been dividing ;
the left half duties, will undoubtedly |
see a lot of action with Evans out. !
Livingston will probably draw the i
starting assignment.
Bob Dove, Ail-American end last !
year, after being tried at guard in j
spring and fall workouts was shifted
back to his regular position, left end. j
just before the season opened. It
wasn't because Bob failed at the
guard post that he was returned to j
end, but because he was needed
most at the terminal position.
MURPHY CAPTAINS
He is proving himself just as ef
fective as in 1941. Captain George
Murphy at right end teams with
Dove to give the Irish one of the
finest pairs of ends in the nation.
Both .pre standout players, offen
sively and defensively.
The Irish line coaches have had a
hard time finding capable replace
ments for tackles Lillis and Brutz
who were lost by graduation. Lou
Rymkus, 218-pound senior has played
excellent defensive ball thus far,
ending the work at the left side of
the line. The other tackle spot still
presents itself as a problem.
Bob Neff, a senior who started the
season on the first eleven has been
bothered by an injury, and is not
able to go at it full strength. Sopho
mores Ziggy Czarobski and Luke
Higgins lack experience but will
probably carry the brunt against
the Indians.
WRIGHT SHIFTED
Harry Wright was shifted from the
j backfield to the line to take up the
I slack left by the graduation of All-
American Bernie Crimmins. Wright,

who quarterbaeked last year's un
defeated team, has proven himself
just as valuable a blocker at his new
post.
Bob Mcßride, left guard, is an ex
cellent defensive player. Center
Walt Ziemba has been the outstand
ing Irish lineman to date but was in
jured and Tom Brock will start in
his place.
The season records for Stanford
and Notre Dame are the same, no
vitcories. After Saturday's game one
or the other is going to chalk one up
in the win column. Here at Notre
Dame, the popular conviction is that
the victory will not go back to the
Pacific Coast.

first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
against the Yellowjackets last week.
He is expected to be ready to start
this Saturday and to show Stanford
the nearest thing to Norm Standlee j
they have seen. In the event Cow
hig's injury again withholds him i
from the starting lineup, Jim Mello,
who has been the most consistent ,
yardage-maker thus far, will again
start at the fullback slot.
EARLEY AT HALF
Bill Earley, pint-sized right half
back, has not yet begun to live up
to his pre-season form. The little !
West Virginian is a very fast run
ner and a good pass receiver. He is
a constant threat to opponents and
Stanford will be no exception. |
Creighton Miller, his injured ankle i
well healed, was one of the leading j
ground-gainers last week and will
see a lot of action Saturday as Ear
ley's replacement.
Sophomore Bob Livingstone and
Tom Miller, who have been dividing ;
the left half duties, will undoubtedly |
see a lot of action with Evans out. !
Livingston will probably draw the i
starting assignment.
Bob Dove, Ail-American end last !
year, after being tried at guard in j
spring and fall workouts was shifted
back to his regular position, left end. j
just before the season opened. It
wasn't because Bob failed at the
guard post that he was returned to j
end, but because he was needed
most at the terminal position.
MURPHY CAPTAINS
He is proving himself just as ef
fective as in 1941. Captain George
Murphy at right end teams with
Dove to give the Irish one of the
finest pairs of ends in the nation.
Both .pre standout players, offen
sively and defensively.
The Irish line coaches have had a
hard time finding capable replace
ments for tackles Lillis and Brutz
who were lost by graduation. Lou
Rymkus, 218-pound senior has played
excellent defensive ball thus far,
ending the work at the left side of
the line. The other tackle spot still
presents itself as a problem.
Bob Neff, a senior who started the
season on the first eleven has been
bothered by an injury, and is not
able to go at it full strength. Sopho
mores Ziggy Czarobski and Luke
Higgins lack experience but will
probably carry the brunt against
the Indians.
WRIGHT SHIFTED
Harry Wright was shifted from the
j backfield to the line to take up the
I slack left by the graduation of All-
American Bernie Crimmins. Wright,

who quarterbaeked last year's un
defeated team, has proven himself
just as valuable a blocker at his new
post.
Bob Mcßride, left guard, is an ex
cellent defensive player. Center
Walt Ziemba has been the outstand
ing Irish lineman to date but was in
jured and Tom Brock will start in
his place.
The season records for Stanford
and Notre Dame are the same, no
vitcories. After Saturday's game one
or the other is going to chalk one up
in the win column. Here at Notre
Dame, the popular conviction is that
the victory will not go back to the
Pacific Coast.

NOTRE DAME, Ind., Oct. 8 (Spe
cial to The Daily)—lt will be a
battle of the T-formations here in
Notre Dame stadium Saturday as
Stanford University's Indians and
Notre Dame's Irish each strive to
gain their initial victory of the 1942
football season.
Notre Dame's coach, Frank Leahy,
in his second season in the drivei - 's
seat, will be favored to drive his
1942 model-T over the finish line
ahead of first-year steresman
Marchie Schwartz. Both men have
found out this season that the favor
ites picked by the experts do not
necessarily win football games.
The only previous meeting be
tween the two teams was in 1925,
Notre Dame winning 27-10 in the
Rose Bowl game at Pasadena. The
Irish hopefuls will be striving to
maintain supremacy over the In
dians, who are coming East with
revenge in their hearts.
NOTRE DAME MEN
The Notre Dame lineup will size
up something like the one that made
the trip to the coast 17 years ago.
The backfield is light and the line
of only average weight. However
Coach Leahy definitely cannot boast
of Four Horsemen and Seven Mules.
The nearest thing the Irish mentor
has to a "Horseman" is Owen "Dip
py" Evans, leading scorer and
ground-gainer in 1941, who will
probably be out of Saturday's game.
Evans was injured on the first
play of the fall's first scrimmage
and has not even engaged in scrim
mage since. The popular belief
around the Irish campus is that the
loss of Evans meant the difference
between a victory and a tie with
Wisconsin and a victory and defeat
in the Georgia Tech tussle.
The Irish T did not get a chance to
show its full effectiveness in the
Wisconsin and Georgia Tech games.
Coach Leahy, despite the tie and
defeat, is well satisfied with the
squad and the new system. Showing
improvement in their ball-handling
nil along, the Irish should be ready
to prove Leahy's faith in them and
at the same time show the full worth
of the T-formation.
BERTELLIPASSES
Angelo Bertelli, shifted to quar
terback this year, has not lost any
of his effectiveness in forward pass
ing.
His failure to connect on so many
occasions can be blamed on the
team's lack of experience with the
new system. With two games ex
perience at the signal-calling spot,
"Bert" is due to resume his precision
passing of 1941 and that spells little
short of defeat for Stanford.
A heavy epidemic of backfield in
juries completely upset the Notre
Dame starting plans. Besides Evans,
Croighton Miller, Gerry Cowhig.
! ;<nd Bortelli have all been laid up at
one time or another. Miller and
Cowhig had been counted on as
first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
against the Yellowjackets last week.
He is expected to be ready to start
this Saturday and to show Stanford
the nearest thing to Norm Standlee j
