NOTRE DAME, Ind., Oct. 8 (Spe
cial to The Daily)—lt will be a
battle of the T-formations here in
Notre Dame stadium Saturday as
Stanford University's Indians and
Notre Dame's Irish each strive to
gain their initial victory of the 1942
football season.
Notre Dame's coach, Frank Leahy,
in his second season in the drivei - 's
seat, will be favored to drive his
1942 model-T over the finish line
ahead of first-year steresman
Marchie Schwartz. Both men have
found out this season that the favor
ites picked by the experts do not
necessarily win football games.
The only previous meeting be
tween the two teams was in 1925,
Notre Dame winning 27-10 in the
Rose Bowl game at Pasadena. The
Irish hopefuls will be striving to
maintain supremacy over the In
dians, who are coming East with
revenge in their hearts.
NOTRE DAME MEN
The Notre Dame lineup will size
up something like the one that made
the trip to the coast 17 years ago.
The backfield is light and the line
of only average weight. However
Coach Leahy definitely cannot boast
of Four Horsemen and Seven Mules.
The nearest thing the Irish mentor
has to a "Horseman" is Owen "Dip
py" Evans, leading scorer and
ground-gainer in 1941, who will
probably be out of Saturday's game.
Evans was injured on the first
play of the fall's first scrimmage
and has not even engaged in scrim
mage since. The popular belief
around the Irish campus is that the
loss of Evans meant the difference
between a victory and a tie with
Wisconsin and a victory and defeat
in the Georgia Tech tussle.
The Irish T did not get a chance to
show its full effectiveness in the
Wisconsin and Georgia Tech games.
Coach Leahy, despite the tie and
defeat, is well satisfied with the
squad and the new system. Showing
improvement in their ball-handling
nil along, the Irish should be ready
to prove Leahy's faith in them and
at the same time show the full worth
of the T-formation.
BERTELLIPASSES
Angelo Bertelli, shifted to quar
terback this year, has not lost any
of his effectiveness in forward pass
ing.
His failure to connect on so many
occasions can be blamed on the
team's lack of experience with the
new system. With two games ex
perience at the signal-calling spot,
"Bert" is due to resume his precision
passing of 1941 and that spells little
short of defeat for Stanford.
A heavy epidemic of backfield in
juries completely upset the Notre
Dame starting plans. Besides Evans,
Croighton Miller, Gerry Cowhig.
! ;<nd Bortelli have all been laid up at
one time or another. Miller and
Cowhig had been counted on as
first string right half and fullback.
Cowhig missed the opener com
pletely and saw but little action
