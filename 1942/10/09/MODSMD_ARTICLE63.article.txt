# Six-Day Week
## 
### 
EXCOM'S revolutionary bill forbidding Fri
day night dates on campus roused many
students out of their dormant state of mind yes
terday. Now, whether they like it or not, they
are coming to realize that ail is not "as it used
to be."
We appreciate the contribution to today's
Campus Opinion column, for we believe that
it represents the opinion of many of the stu
dents. It is argued that a six-day week affects
very few students directly. This is very true
now, but the aim of the University, the War
Board, and The Daily is to get those students
who have no classes on Saturday to do some
kind of war work Friday nights.
Does this sound too fantastic? To name one
group as an example, according to all reports,
the Fijis are going to work in the cannery to
night and tomorrow night. Besides the money
involved, that house has realized that there
is work to be done and that it can help.
But back to the reason for passing the "no
Friday night dates motion." Everyone realizes
that students have to relax. Of course, we will
have to do much less relaxing and more work,
but relaxation can be controlled or it can get
out of hand. Friday night is a good study night;
it is a good night to roll bandages and work
in the cannery.
In Autumn Quarter we have football games
on Saturday. We don't like to study or work
after these games, whether we win or lose.
Thus Saturday night is the logical night for a
period of relaxation, granted, of course, that the
six-day week is necessary.
We believe that the six-day week is impor
tant now for the following reasons:
1. Saturday classes will be more numerous
from quarter to quarter. It is to the advantage
of all that students attend these classes, and
when they go, it is necessary that their minds
be clear so they will be able to get the most
out of the classes.
2. As mentioned before, we should spend
our time doing worthy jobs instead of getting
tired elbows leaning across bars. There are
several opportunities offered on page 1 for stu
dents to work tonight.
3. There is a matter of good taste. We can
establish a very good name for ourselves, as
members of a far-sighted University, when we
tell outsiders that we are going to forego enter
tainment one night a week for war work.
The Daily doesn't expect every student to
agree with this proposal; therefore we expect
many contributions to Campus Opinion so that
all views can be aired.

Congratulations to the Y.W.C.A. on its 50th
anniversary. It has gone hand in hand with
the University in the development of fine
womanhood and excellent leadership.

to be."
We appreciate the contribution to today's
Campus Opinion column, for we believe that
it represents the opinion of many of the stu
dents. It is argued that a six-day week affects
very few students directly. This is very true
now, but the aim of the University, the War
Board, and The Daily is to get those students
who have no classes on Saturday to do some
kind of war work Friday nights.
Does this sound too fantastic? To name one
group as an example, according to all reports,
the Fijis are going to work in the cannery to
night and tomorrow night. Besides the money
involved, that house has realized that there
is work to be done and that it can help.
But back to the reason for passing the "no
Friday night dates motion." Everyone realizes
that students have to relax. Of course, we will
have to do much less relaxing and more work,
but relaxation can be controlled or it can get
out of hand. Friday night is a good study night;
it is a good night to roll bandages and work
in the cannery.
In Autumn Quarter we have football games
on Saturday. We don't like to study or work
after these games, whether we win or lose.
Thus Saturday night is the logical night for a
period of relaxation, granted, of course, that the
six-day week is necessary.
We believe that the six-day week is impor
tant now for the following reasons:
1. Saturday classes will be more numerous
from quarter to quarter. It is to the advantage
of all that students attend these classes, and
when they go, it is necessary that their minds
be clear so they will be able to get the most
out of the classes.
2. As mentioned before, we should spend
our time doing worthy jobs instead of getting
tired elbows leaning across bars. There are
several opportunities offered on page 1 for stu
dents to work tonight.
3. There is a matter of good taste. We can
establish a very good name for ourselves, as
members of a far-sighted University, when we
tell outsiders that we are going to forego enter
tainment one night a week for war work.
The Daily doesn't expect every student to
agree with this proposal; therefore we expect
many contributions to Campus Opinion so that
all views can be aired.

Congratulations to the Y.W.C.A. on its 50th
anniversary. It has gone hand in hand with
the University in the development of fine
womanhood and excellent leadership.
