# No Publicity!

### 
THE War Stamp drive of Wednesday fell far
short of its Sl5OO goal. Some say it was be
cause there was not enough publicity. Maybe
that is true, but it isn't a very valid excuse; for
by now, over 10 months after our entry into
the war, we should know what these stamps are
for without having a tremendous publicity
campaign shoved down our throats.
We are doing ourselves and our country a
favor by purchasing stamps, but how many
times have we heard that? We believe the
drive will go over much better next week when
students will start that Stamp Night habit of
buying one or two green stamps a week.
