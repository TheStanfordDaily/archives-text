## OFF THE DEEP END? 
### TED NORTON 
lor the firsl time in many weeks, the news looks
encouraging. Naturally, the biggest and l>csl item
is the announced German withdrawal from Stalin
grad. In the light of past Nazi performances, this
is as good as a confession.of failure; and for that
failure the Soviets deserve full credit. Notwithstand
ing the effects of the impending arrival of winter,
it was the determination of Stalingrad's defenders
and the skill of the Soviet strategists thai stopped

Exchange has had its lirst million-share day since
December. 1941. and that stock prices are steadiK
rising. I don't believe that there are many better
indications of a rising morale in the American
people, evei.i among our "capitalists" whose faith
in America has been sometimes questioned.
