Cluttering up the steps. floors, walls, and ceilings
surrounding the /\.S.S.I . offices for ihc past feu
days have been 5,344 tryoutees for positions on
Rally Committee, a student organization organized
some years ago for a good reason, no doubt.
While the trouts sit outside busily doing their
homework and playing five-card draw—joker wild
for aces, straights, and flushes—the bosses hold
forth in the inner sanctum, interviewing the aspir
ants, one by one. They also have a box of them on
the table—aspirants.
But to get back to Martha Iburmond and James
Mcßriar silting there questioning the quaking
trouts. It seems that the big bosses base a svslem
of putting down some comment on the bottom of
each tryoutee s card, in order to be able to recog
nize them later.
Appearing not once but several times on the
cards of little-girl trouts was Mcßrier's identifying
statement, "Cute sweater girl. Wow!"

\ext to the Rrooklyn Dodders I can I lliink of
anyone who Jias less use for ihe (Cardinals than
has the Stanford student body.
This fact was brought to my attention several
evenings ago by one Hays Rush, a guilty-con
seienced member of Cardinals. lie first pointed out
all the tremendous things Cardinals had done in
the past, and then later pouted because there wasn't
anything for them to do now.
He mentioned that they had formulated a new
policy in regard to their private charge, the Cellar
trophy case. The next day the VC.A.A. silverware
was taken from the case, and in place of it was
put dust.
