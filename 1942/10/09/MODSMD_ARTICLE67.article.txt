The Kditor, Sir:
There is an old saying lo the effect that while
the cat's away, the mice will play. Mice or rats
we wonder? Il seems vnrv peculiar that such an
important ruling as no Friday night dales was
passed when the head of our student government
was away.
Ihe pretext given for this piece of legislation
is ihe new six-day school week. Although a great
many students are taking the Wilbur-prescribed
units, not many of ihcm have found themselves
in Saturday classes and are consequently working
harder during the week. Granted some people are
taking Salurdav classes: nevertheless, the majorilv
of students should not be ruled by the precaution
taken for the benefit of this few. We believe that
the people who register for these Saturday classes
do so with the realization <>f the obligation they
incur.
\\ itli the Cellar closed and no Fridav night dales,
it seems that the I niversilv is contradicting il
policy of on-campus entertainment and forcing the
majority of students to go down the highwa\ <Â»r
to the city.
*"\\ e are glad to see thai Kxeom eliminated grant
ing dales on Friday nights at its meeting last night.
Our sludenl government sv-lcm took a big step
ahead and passed a worthwhile piece of leui*lalion.
\\ ho is glad, and whose -Indent government?
