# Albert Plays College Hero In New Film
## 
### 
"The Spirit of Stanford," starring
Ensign Frankie Albert, the Farm's
\ll-American quarterback, opens
Sunday at the Stanford Theater.
The epic of Albert's four years at
Stanford (Hollywood version) will
play for four days, closing Wednes
lay. The first show on Sunday be
gins at 1 p.m.
The story in brief concerns Frank's
ife at tSanford, altered to fit a
movie script, from the time he en
rolls at the Farm as a cocky kid from
Glendale to his last game at Stan
ford when he is finally embued with
ihe true and noble "Spirit of Stan
lord."
FAIRLY AUTHENTIC
Although Card students will laugh
at certain inaccuracies in the film,
there is nevertheless much authen
ticity. Frankie Albert is played by
Frankie Albert, Ernie Nevers is
played by Ernie Nevers, the Stanford
ootball equipment is played by the
Stanford football equipment (the
University loaned it to Columbia
Pictures for the film), and the Quad
is played by the Quad (the Univer
sity did not loan this to Columbia
Pictures for the film but they us&d
it anyhow).
FEMININE LEAD
Playing the feminine lead is Mar
guerite Chapman. Marguerite is the
kind of girl "whose entrance into
a dining room causes soup to spill
on masculine vests and brings about
fin abrupt cessation in the cacophony
of clattering cutlery," to quote Co
lumbia's publicity releases.
Our advice to you on this picture
is not to see it while you are eating
soup, or if you must eat soup in the
Stanford Theater, remove your vest.
P.S.: You'll adore the Four Vaga
bonds.â€”Cough lin
