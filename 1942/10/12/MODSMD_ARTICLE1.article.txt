# Job Program At Canneries In Confusion
## Committee Attempts To Solve Manpower, Union Membership 
### 
Despite fire, AFL legalities and
crossed signals, Stanford cannery
volunteers managed to give a slight
Imm»U to ifcic labor problem this
weekend.
First wrinkle in plans was en
countered Friday, when 46 men were
dispatched to four local canneries.
Apparently, co-ordination between
the canneries and Stanford had been
faulty, for one cannery had hired a
crew of Moffett field soldiers and
had not expected the Stanford con
tingent. As a result, they were
turned away.
Others were put to work, but were
compelled to apply for AFL union
membership. A 10-day interim be
fore applications become effective
allowed the boys to work Friday.
Efforts are being made by Jim Kess
ler, SWB, to exempt Stanford men
from union membership, as they are
not working full time.
FIRE RUMOR ADDS SNARL
Another wrinkle arose in the form
of a rumor. A small fire in the Mt.
View Supply Co. plant. Friday eve
ning caused inconsequential mate
rial damage but was distorted by
rumors until it had burned down
the entire establishment. As a re
sult, numerous Stanford volunteers
cancelled their plans to work there.
Sturday morning Rosemary Cross,
SWB, received word that three of
the canneries did not need help that
day. Rosemary then called all men's
living groups informing them that
the program was off. A few hours
later, she received another call re
questing Stanford labor. In a second
call to the men's houses, she suc
ceeded in recruiting only eight
workers.
CANNERIES SENT PLEA
By Sunday night, the whole pro
gram seemed hopelessly snarled.
Nevertheless, the SWB is attempting
to iron out the wrinkles. The first
problem was to determine where the
snags lay. It seems that the can
neries had sent out an urgent plea
last Monday for workers. The War
Board then tackled the problem and
made arrangements to send them a
small army of workers. The can
neries, realizing that .they had no
time to make preparations to handle
the large number of inexperienced
men who applied, reversed their
policy at the last minute and decided
to employ only small groups of
Stanford men. Then arose further
complications — union regulations,
limitations and transportation.
Thus, the situation presents itself,
and the SWB is taking measures to
cope with the problems. The most
imposing wrinkle is one of organiza
tion. The SWB has designated a
committee to handle cannery labor.
However, it will not work directly
with the canneries, as this would
make the SWB a technical employ
ment agency and would burden it
with union responsibilities. There
fore, the SWB will work through
Miss Helen Vincent, U.S. Employ
ment Bureau. Miss Vincent will keep
in touch with canneries, and will re
lay facts regarding labor demand,
hours, and type of work to the SWB.
Office and cannery representa
tives will attempt to arrive at a solu
tion this week.

the large number of inexperienced
men who applied, reversed their
policy at the last minute and decided
to employ only small groups of
Stanford men. Then arose further
complications — union regulations,
limitations and transportation.
Thus, the situation presents itself,
and the SWB is taking measures to
cope with the problems. The most
imposing wrinkle is one of organiza
tion. The SWB has designated a
committee to handle cannery labor.
However, it will not work directly
with the canneries, as this would
make the SWB a technical employ
ment agency and would burden it
with union responsibilities. There
fore, the SWB will work through
Miss Helen Vincent, U.S. Employ
ment Bureau. Miss Vincent will keep
in touch with canneries, and will re
lay facts regarding labor demand,
hours, and type of work to the SWB.
Office and cannery representa
tives will attempt to arrive at a solu
tion this week.
Despite fire, AFL legalities and
crossed signals, Stanford cannery
volunteers managed to give a slight
Imm»U to ifcic labor problem this
weekend.
First wrinkle in plans was en
countered Friday, when 46 men were
dispatched to four local canneries.
Apparently, co-ordination between
the canneries and Stanford had been
faulty, for one cannery had hired a
crew of Moffett field soldiers and
had not expected the Stanford con
tingent. As a result, they were
turned away.
Others were put to work, but were
compelled to apply for AFL union
membership. A 10-day interim be
fore applications become effective
allowed the boys to work Friday.
Efforts are being made by Jim Kess
ler, SWB, to exempt Stanford men
from union membership, as they are
not working full time.
FIRE RUMOR ADDS SNARL
Another wrinkle arose in the form
of a rumor. A small fire in the Mt.
View Supply Co. plant. Friday eve
ning caused inconsequential mate
rial damage but was distorted by
rumors until it had burned down
the entire establishment. As a re
sult, numerous Stanford volunteers
cancelled their plans to work there.
Sturday morning Rosemary Cross,
SWB, received word that three of
the canneries did not need help that
day. Rosemary then called all men's
living groups informing them that
the program was off. A few hours
later, she received another call re
questing Stanford labor. In a second
call to the men's houses, she suc
ceeded in recruiting only eight
workers.
CANNERIES SENT PLEA
By Sunday night, the whole pro
gram seemed hopelessly snarled.
Nevertheless, the SWB is attempting
to iron out the wrinkles. The first
problem was to determine where the
snags lay. It seems that the can
neries had sent out an urgent plea
last Monday for workers. The War
Board then tackled the problem and
made arrangements to send them a
small army of workers. The can
neries, realizing that .they had no
time to make preparations to handle
the large number of inexperienced
men who applied, reversed their
policy at the last minute and decided
to employ only small groups of
Stanford men. Then arose further
complications — union regulations,
