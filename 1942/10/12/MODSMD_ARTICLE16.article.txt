# German Stalingrad Push Stalls As Nazis Bring Up Reserves; Jap Solomon Landings Continue
## Enemy Destroyer Sunk, Island Base Reinforced 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (UP)—
One of the most important land bat
tles of the Pacific war tonight ap
peared to be taking form in the Sol
onions where the Japanese continue
moving in men and supplies in a bid
to seize Guadalcanal Island and its
strategic airfield from American
forces.
The Navy acknowledged in its
latest communique that the enemy
has succeeded in landing more re
inforcements on the northwest cor
ner of Guadalcanal despite vigorous
assaults by American airmen on en
emy warships covering the opera
tions. A Jap destroyer was sunk and
a destroyer and cruiser damaged in
action.
Naval experts said Japan's deter
mination to reinforce its Guadal
canal positions, regardless of losses,
makes it clear the enemy hopes to
concentrate a ground force large
enough to march down the island
toward the American airfield.
The landings are taking place on
the same side of the Guadalcanal
mountains on which the key Amer
ican positions are established and it
is considered most likely the Jap
anese will attempt the southward
push through a series of "pincer"
actions.

SOMEWHERE IN NEW GUINEA,
via courier, Oct. 10 (Delayed) (U.R)—
American flying fortresses have
practically destroyed Rabaul, Jap
anese base on New Britain, with two
mass attacks which frightened the
enemy's Zero fighters out of the
skies and left the four-motored
monsters to wreak their devastation
molested only by inaccurate anti
aircraft. fire.
The fortress crews returning from
the second attack at dawn today said
they had plastered Rabaul with 40
tons of explosive bombs and hun
dreds of incendiaries. They set three
huge fires and many smaller ones in
the warehouse and administrative
district, scored a direct hit on a Jap
vessel in the harbor and strafed
runways, buildings and grounded
planes at Lakunai airdrome without
ppposition.
The Japs started banging away
with ack-ack when the fortresses
were still 10 miles from the target,
the crews reported, but Jap Zero
fighters stuck to the ground, afraid
to challenge the bombers.
U.S. Army headquarters in Aus
tralia said files visible for 90 miles
were set by the Allied bombers in
the Rabaul attack. Other bombers
raided Dilli, a Jap base on the island
of Timor.
