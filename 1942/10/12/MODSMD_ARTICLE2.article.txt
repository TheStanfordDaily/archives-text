CRIPPLE CREEK, Colo., Oct. 11
(UP).â€”Dig. dig, dig was the watch
word in this famous gold-mining
town today as old-timers and other
residents flung themselves feverishly
into the business of mining as much
gold ore as possible before mid
night Thursday, when a govern
ment decree calls a halt to opera
tion of the nation's large yellow
metal mines.
