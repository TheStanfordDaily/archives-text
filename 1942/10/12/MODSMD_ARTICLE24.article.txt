### 
MOSCOW, Monday, Oct, 12 (UP).
—The German siege army at Stalin
grad. hied white hy enormous losses,
broke ott the 48-day assault yes
terday, the Red Army announced
today, hut front dispatches warned
that strong enemy reinforcements
were moving up to renew the attack.
"In the Stalingrad area our troops
are exchanging fire with the en
emy," the Sunday midnight com
munique of the Soviet higli com
mand said. "Enemy tanks and in
fantry which have suffered huge
losses lately showed no activity."
Red Star, the Soviet army organ,
earlier reported a slackening of
German pressure on Soviet barri
cades blocking the streets of Sta
lingrad, attributing the lull to the
utter exhaustion of front line
shock troops.
GERMAN RESERVES ARRIVE
It said, however, that fresh Ger
man reserves were pouring in on
Stalingrad under orders to capture
the city regardless of the cost, and
that a resumption of hostilities in
full fury might be expected at any
time.
As Red Army artillery and Ger
man siege guns dueled over the
ruins of the Volga city, the high
command said one Soviet battery
destroyed eight German block
houses, three guns, five machine
gun nests and one ammunition
dump.
Russian artillerymen who trained
their cannon on another German
concentration wrecked an anti-tank
gun, wiped out eight machine-gun
nests with their crews, and anni
hilated two mortar batteries and
about a company of infantry, the
late communique said.
Northwest of Stalingrad the Red
Army relief drive toward the city
appeared to have been checked.
The high command reported light
ing of a local character, and Ger
man attacks repelled in some sec
tors. At one point German infantry
led by six tanks attempted to attack
but was beaten back with heavy
losses, including three tanks and
some prisoners.
WAR THEATER SIIIETS
The main weight of the campaign
in South Russia had shifted, tem
porarily at least, to the Caucasus.
There, the official war summary
said, the Russians crushed stubborn
Axis resistance southeast of Novo
rossisk, advanced and encircled one
inhabited locality.
In another sector of the Black
Sea region the Red Army beat back
two German attacks, destroyed two
tanks and seven trucks, and wiped
out a company of infantry.
To the southeast in the Mozdok
area, Soviet defenders of the Grozny
011 fields "engaged in battles with
enemy tanks and infantry." One
Red Army unit repulsed five attacks
and killed up to 300 enemy troops,
capturing a radio transmitter and
12 trucks.
