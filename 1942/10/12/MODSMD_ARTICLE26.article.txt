### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 11 (U.R)—
House acceptance of the new 5 per
cenl "victory tax" on all individual
incomes above $!2 a week was pre
dicted l>y congressional leaders to
night as conferees prepared to ad
just Senate and House differences in
the record $8,000,000,000 war revenue
hill.
The measure, biggest in history,
would tap the earnings of one-third
of the nation's population and will
I oost annual revenue to $25,000,000,-
000. Taxes on individuals and cor
porations. would be raised to the
highest levels in American history.
Chairman Walter F. George (D.,
Ga.), of the Senate Finance Com
mit Lee who guided the momentous
bill through five days of hectic floor
debate, hoped to get joint confer
ences underway on Tuesday in or
der to complete work by the end of
this week.
The "victory tax," to be super
imposed on increased normal and
surtax rates for individuals, is the
m ijor difference to be ironed out.
Chairman Robert L. Doubhton
(D., N.C.), of the House Ways and
M-uns Committee and leading com
mit Ice members indicated the levy
will be accepted. They were of the
opinion it is a question of accepting
the tax or' turning elsewhere for
equal revenue —an estimated $3,-
050,000,000 annually—and that the
best alternative would be a sales tax,
opposed by the administration and
refused approval by both houses.
The "victory" tax applies to all
income in excess of $624 a year and,
in most cases, would be deducted
from paychecks. A system of re
bates is set up to cover war bond
purchases and debt and insurance
premium payments.
