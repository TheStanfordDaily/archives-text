# No Meat Tuesday Asks La Guardia
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 11 (U.R)—Mayor
F. H. LaGuardia officially asked all
hotels and restaurants in New York
today to make Tuesday a meatless
day.
The mayor previously had recom
mended to housewives that they buy
fish instead of meat on Tuesdays.
His request, however, was in the
nature of a counter-proposal to the
plan of a group of restaurant men to
make Friday a meatless day.
Said LaGuardia: "Friday is a tra
ditional fish day and to make Friday
your official meatless day smacks of
the slicker, doesn't it? We don't
want to be hypocritical about this.
Let's give the example to the rest of
the country."
