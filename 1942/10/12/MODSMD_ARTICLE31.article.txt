SEATTLE, Oct. 11 (U.R)—Crowdde,
war-rushed Seattle was threatened
with another problem tonight—one
which may further pinch the diet of
her hard-working populace.
State Agriculture Director Arthur
E. Cox told Seattle and nearby cities
they may expect rationing of milk
by Jan. 1, 1943.
Of all peacetime travel in the
United States, 90 per cent was by
passenger automobile.
