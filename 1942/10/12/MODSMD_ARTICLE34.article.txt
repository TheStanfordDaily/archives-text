# New 'Brain Wave' Laboratory Opens on Stanford Campus
## 
### 
With the foiinal opening yesterday of a new laboratory of electroence
phalography. more popularly referred to as "brain wave" laboratory, the
Stanford School of Medicine now has what is believed to be the most com
plete and modern instrument in the country.
The new instrument has been under construction and adjustment for

nearly 10 months. It is the out-
growth of several years of labora
tory research work on convulsions
and allied neurological problems
which led to the need for such a
precise method.
The brain waves are recorded by j
attaching metal clips or electrodes j
to the scalp of the patient. The in- |
finitesimal currents that are picked
up are led off to powerful ampli
fiers. which increase their strength
to the point where the waves trace
their own identity by means of elec
trical pens.
Stanford's medical investigators
consider the waves as being either
normal or abnormal. The normal
ones are a train of undulations pres
ent in all persons and associated
with vision.
ABNORMAL WAVES
Abnormal waves are usually j
slower and larger, and they vary in j
shape according to the cause of the
abnormality. By the character of I
the waves, the physician is able to j
diagnose tumors of the brain, cer- j
tain forms of epilepsy, injuries to the '
brain, and other pathological condi- |
tions.
Epilepsy, for example, is charac
terized by rapid, spike-like waves.
On the other hand, alcohol in large
doses produces the large, slow waves
characteristic of unconsciousness.
TEST FOR BLIND
Another use of the brain wave ap
paratus was discovered by a Seattle
medical investigator, who found that
normal, fundamental waves are
broken up when the eyes are open;
this being true, the instrument can
determine between real and feigned
blindness.
A worker who claimed compensa
tion for loss of sight was accused of
malingering, but he was found to be
telling the truth when the funda
mental waves recorded by the elec
troencephalograph persisted when
his eyes were open.
The brain wave machine is unique
among such instruments in that it is
entirely remotely controlled, thus
avoiding electrical interference. The
apparatus consists of four sets of
amplifiers housed within a single
unit, with the power being generated
and regulated within the instrument
itself.

With the foiinal opening yesterday of a new laboratory of electroence
phalography. more popularly referred to as "brain wave" laboratory, the
Stanford School of Medicine now has what is believed to be the most com
plete and modern instrument in the country.
The new instrument has been under construction and adjustment for

nearly 10 months. It is the out-
growth of several years of labora
tory research work on convulsions
and allied neurological problems
which led to the need for such a
precise method.
The brain waves are recorded by j
attaching metal clips or electrodes j
to the scalp of the patient. The in- |
finitesimal currents that are picked
up are led off to powerful ampli
fiers. which increase their strength
to the point where the waves trace
their own identity by means of elec
trical pens.
Stanford's medical investigators
consider the waves as being either
normal or abnormal. The normal
ones are a train of undulations pres
ent in all persons and associated
with vision.
ABNORMAL WAVES
Abnormal waves are usually j
slower and larger, and they vary in j
shape according to the cause of the
abnormality. By the character of I
the waves, the physician is able to j
diagnose tumors of the brain, cer- j
tain forms of epilepsy, injuries to the '
brain, and other pathological condi- |
tions.
Epilepsy, for example, is charac
terized by rapid, spike-like waves.
On the other hand, alcohol in large
doses produces the large, slow waves
characteristic of unconsciousness.
TEST FOR BLIND
Another use of the brain wave ap
paratus was discovered by a Seattle
medical investigator, who found that
normal, fundamental waves are
broken up when the eyes are open;
this being true, the instrument can
determine between real and feigned
blindness.
A worker who claimed compensa
tion for loss of sight was accused of
malingering, but he was found to be
telling the truth when the funda
mental waves recorded by the elec
troencephalograph persisted when
his eyes were open.
The brain wave machine is unique
among such instruments in that it is
entirely remotely controlled, thus
avoiding electrical interference. The
apparatus consists of four sets of
amplifiers housed within a single
unit, with the power being generated
and regulated within the instrument
itself.
