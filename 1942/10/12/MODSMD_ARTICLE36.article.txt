# R.O. Students Sign Pay Cards
## 
### 
The R.O.T.C. Department of Stan
ford has announced that all students
enlisted in the Enlisted Reserve
Corps of the Army should call at the
Department of Military Science and
Tactics, Room 536, and sign their
individual pay records.
Major Edward J. Scares, Ord
nance Officer of the R.O.T.C. and
officer in charge of reserve enlist
ments at Stanford, declared that
signing the pay book now does not
entitle a man to receive pay until
he is called to active duty. However,
all men should sign their records as
soon as possible to complete their
individual files, he said.
The use of individual pay records
is an innovation with the Army for
the purpose of facilitating pay dis
tribution when men are away from
their home bases at pay time. With
the new system a soldier can pre
sent his pay record to any finance
officer of the Navy, Marines or the
Army if he is not at the home base
on pay day. This cuts out many of
the delays which accompanied this
procedure in the past and greatly
simplifies the disbursement of pay
in the Army.
