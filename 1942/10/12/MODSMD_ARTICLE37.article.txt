The 97 areas—the largest number
brought under federal control at one
time—raised to 287 the number of
compulsory rent ceiling areas. There
are 109 areas remaining, and offi
cials said Henderson intends to
"clear them up" as rapidly as pos
sible.
LANDLORDS GET 60 DAYS
Henderson opened the way for
rent controls across the nation last
Monday by establishing additional
defense-rental areas. Landlords in
those areas were given 60 days to
comply voluntarily before the gov
ernment steps in.
He announced that maximum rent
regulations, covering hotels and
rooming houses, will be issued for
the 97 new areas effective Nov. 1.
They will prescribe regulations for
the registration of rental living
quarters.
