# Opera Star To Perform For Series
## 
### 
Joseph James, distinguished young
Negro baritone will appear on the
Farm tomorrow night at the Me
morial Theater at 7:30 p.m. in the
second Tuesday Series program of
the current quarter.
Mr. James began his professional
career as a concert singer in 1933,
and since that time has also ap
peared in "Run Little Chillun," a
presentation of the Federal Theater,
and "The Swing Mikado," which
played at the San Francisco Golden
Gate Exposition.
In reviewing a concert given by
Mr. James last May in San Fran
cisco, Alfred Frankenstein, music
critic of the San Francisco Chronicle,
said, "Joseph James presented a
magnificently chosen program. His
big baritone voice was thoroughly
admirable in its depth, power and
quality, and one rarely hears in
terpretations inspired by such flam
ing sincerity and devotion to music."
The concert will begin promptly
at 7:30 p.m. New students are re
minded that there is no charge for
the Tuesday Evening Series. All are
cordially invited to attend, according
to the Committee on Public Exer
cise which arranges for the series.
