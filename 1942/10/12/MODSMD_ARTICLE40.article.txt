# Fred Sanderman Out for Season
## Injury-riddled Cardinals En Route Home; Stamm May Miss Vandal Game 
### 
As Stanford's football team speeds home where hundreds of wishful
thinkers were toppled from pinnacles of rationalization after the Indians
absorbed a 27-0 smearing from Notre Dame, it is apparent that much more
than mere face was lost by the rout: Freddie Sanderman, who recently
graduated to first string left half, suffered a broken clavicle and will he

out of the Farm line-up for the re-.,
mainder of the season.
Ed Stamm took on a bruised rib
which may keep him out of the
Idaho game next Saturday; Mark
CafTall, the sophomore quarterback
who sparked Stanford's touchdown
drive against Santa Clara a week
ago, has a leg infection and did not
play Saturday; Bill Sheller, who
played the full 60 minutes against
Notre Dame and averaged 41 yards
per punt in five attempts, w;'.s all
used up; Dave Brown carried along
a purplish shiner, a result of Harry
Wright's elbow; Jim Cox had a mi
nor leg injury, and Buck Fawcett
re-injured his ankle and added to
it a cut lip—that's the sum of the
battering defeat at South Bend.
TEAM ARRIVES WEDNESDAY
Coach Marchie Schwartz, whose
homecoming was all gayness ex
cept for the score, said, "Those
men injured won't have to practice
until Wednesday." He was either
quipping or forgot the fact that the
train bearing the Indian warriors
doesn't arrive until Wednesday, and
there are no practice stopovers en
route.
Stanford is still looking for a
victory in 1942, and the prospect
of realizing it against Idaho dimmed
over the week-end as Vic Lindskog
failed to scout the Vandal-Eastern
Washington encounter at Cheney,
Wash. After finding that the game
had been shifted from Saturday to
Friday, Vic tried to obtain plane
and magic carpet reservations but
couldn't get either, so Idaho goes
unscouted.
WATCII BEARS WIN
The team watched the Chicago
Bears trounce the Cardinals, 41-14,
yesterday afternoon before leaving
Chicago.
With Sanderman out for the sea
son, the all-important left halfback
spot will probably go back to either
Don Zappettini or Ben Morrison.
Morrison did not play against Notre
Dame. He was bopped on the head
in the Santa Clara game and may
have a mild brain concussion.
The remainder of the team came
out of the battle intact, excepting
Tony Medved, who played in his
first varsity game and had several
stitches taken in his upper lip.
When the team arrives Wednes
day to begin practice for Idaho,
Schwartz will try to iron out pass
defense.
It's a big order.

When the team arrives Wednes
day to begin practice for Idaho,
Schwartz will try to iron out pass
defense.
It's a big order.
As Stanford's football team speeds home where hundreds of wishful
thinkers were toppled from pinnacles of rationalization after the Indians
absorbed a 27-0 smearing from Notre Dame, it is apparent that much more
than mere face was lost by the rout: Freddie Sanderman, who recently
graduated to first string left half, suffered a broken clavicle and will he

out of the Farm line-up for the re-.,
mainder of the season.
Ed Stamm took on a bruised rib
which may keep him out of the
Idaho game next Saturday; Mark
CafTall, the sophomore quarterback
who sparked Stanford's touchdown
drive against Santa Clara a week
ago, has a leg infection and did not
play Saturday; Bill Sheller, who
played the full 60 minutes against
Notre Dame and averaged 41 yards
per punt in five attempts, w;'.s all
used up; Dave Brown carried along
a purplish shiner, a result of Harry
Wright's elbow; Jim Cox had a mi
nor leg injury, and Buck Fawcett
re-injured his ankle and added to
it a cut lip—that's the sum of the
battering defeat at South Bend.
TEAM ARRIVES WEDNESDAY
Coach Marchie Schwartz, whose
homecoming was all gayness ex
cept for the score, said, "Those
men injured won't have to practice
until Wednesday." He was either
quipping or forgot the fact that the
train bearing the Indian warriors
doesn't arrive until Wednesday, and
there are no practice stopovers en
route.
Stanford is still looking for a
victory in 1942, and the prospect
of realizing it against Idaho dimmed
over the week-end as Vic Lindskog
failed to scout the Vandal-Eastern
Washington encounter at Cheney,
Wash. After finding that the game
had been shifted from Saturday to
Friday, Vic tried to obtain plane
and magic carpet reservations but
couldn't get either, so Idaho goes
unscouted.
WATCII BEARS WIN
The team watched the Chicago
Bears trounce the Cardinals, 41-14,
yesterday afternoon before leaving
Chicago.
With Sanderman out for the sea
son, the all-important left halfback
spot will probably go back to either
Don Zappettini or Ben Morrison.
Morrison did not play against Notre
Dame. He was bopped on the head
in the Santa Clara game and may
have a mild brain concussion.
The remainder of the team came
out of the battle intact, excepting
Tony Medved, who played in his
first varsity game and had several
stitches taken in his upper lip.
