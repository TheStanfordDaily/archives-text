# P.C.C. Race Is Still Undecided
## 
### 
Another of those P.C.C. football
races where the winner may head
for Pasadena with even two defeats
and still be the so-called "best" in
coast football is in the offing as
Saturday's scores revealed that vir
tually anybody and his dog can still
he the favorite.
Cocky O.S.C. found it out at Los
Angeles where the U.C.L.A. Bruins,
having vowed to win a game for Don
Brown, son of Joe E .Brown and
former Bruin lineman just killed in
a plane crash, smothered the Bea
vers HO to 7.
The Bruin victory also pointed out
the exceptional strength of Tex
Oliver's St. Mary's Pre-flighters who
previously topped the Bruins. The
ensigns from Moraga are the best on
the coast. Saturday they slaughtered
the Coast Guard 40 to 0.
W.S.C. in the north is still the un
defeated leader, having dissected the
Montana Grizzlies (58-1(5. And the
two unknown quantities of the race,
Washington and Oregon, had it out
at Portland, the Huskies popping
back into the not-to-be-overlooked
column with a 15-7 win.
Santa Clara continued undefeated
by just edging Cal, 7-6. The Bears
looked as if they were tired of hear
ing the jibes of sportswriters who
won't let them forget their early
season mishaps. Stanford and USC
were thumped.
