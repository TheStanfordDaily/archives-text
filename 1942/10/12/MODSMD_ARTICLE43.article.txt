## IT GETS LEANER: 
### 
Stanford threatened many times
against Notre Dame. It threatens
to go through the season winless un
less a pass defense unfolds that is
capable of staying even with the
hard-charging line that forced the
Irish to score all four of their touch
downs via the ether.
Seven times has the enemy scored
thus far this year, and all seven
times passes were the nemesis.
Coach Francis Wilcox' frosh looked
so good in beating Menlo, 25-20, that
somebody in the stands Saturday
said Stanford could go places with
the varsity line and the freshman
backs. Might be something in that
â€”if the freshman eligibility rule
were in effect on the coast.
You can read about the amazing
backs that helped win the Papoose
opener in the'adjoining column to
the right.
