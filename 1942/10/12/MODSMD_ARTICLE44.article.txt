# ROSE BOWL ON:
## 
### 
It may not be intercollegiate, it
may not be in the Bowl itself, but
there'll be a Rose Bowl game come
next January 1. Tournament of
Roses officials met Friday and de
cided that the intersectional tilt is
on with only the Army green light
needed for final plans. With the
season three weeks old, we throw in
as a nice little potpourri for the
New Year's, a doubleheaderâ€”lowa
Pre-Flight vs. St. Mary's Pre-Flight
plus the Pacific Coast Conference
winner vs. Georgia Tech.
