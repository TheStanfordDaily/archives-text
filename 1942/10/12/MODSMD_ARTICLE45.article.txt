# SUMMING IT UP:
## 
### 
k Because every other "smart"
picker picked Notre Dame over
tSanford, except Bill Leiser and
Art Rosenhaum of the San Fran
cisco Chronicle, The Daily sports
staff conjured up a mythical finish
Friday in the Indians' favor, 14-13.
Not so hot either, but it beat the
other prognosticators by at least
adding up to the final score, 27-0.
The 0 gets in there free of picking.
