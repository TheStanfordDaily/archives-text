## Freshman Grid Team Defeats Menlo, 25-20 
### ZIP WALT 
Showing great strength in both backfield and line, the Stanford fresh
men opened their season with an easy 25-20 win over Menlo Junior Col
lege last Saturday in the Stadium.
It was the first college team that Francis Wilcox, former Creighton stai
ever put on the field, and his debut was most successful.

The frosh backs, aided by good.,
blocking in the line, had little
trouble bucking 'the line or sweep
ing the ends for long gains. Menlo
set up all scores by passes from
Ward Bowers and Bill Sheridan, two
of them coming when Wilcox had
the third team in the game. Menlo
was able to make but one first down
on the ground.
FROSH SCORE
Stanford got the ball for the first
time after Bowers sent a towering
GO-yard kick to the frosh 15. Then
they marched 85 yards in seven
plays to score. It went like this:
Mark Heffelfinger, right half, made
15 yards on the first play. Jack
Brownson, quarterback, fumbled, but
recovered. Then Lloyd Merriman,
left half, hit right guard for 29 yards.
Steve Tish, fullback, picked up 11
more yards, then packed the ball
again for five. Merriman clicked off
four. Then, on third down, with one
yard to go, Merriman powered over
his own right guard, cut to the left
in the Menlo secondary, picked up
interference, and boomed over for
six points.
Brownson kicked the extra point,
Merriman holding.
SECOND SCORE
After an exchange of kicks,
Brownson returned a punt to the
Menlo 40. Merriman, behind good
interference and sharp blocking,
moved for 25 yards to the 15. He
picked up 10 inside left end for a
first down on the Menlo 5. Tish
bucked over tackle for a touchdown.
Wilcox inserted a whole new team,
which was a little weak on pass de
fense. Bowers, playing a standout
game for the losers, tossed the ball
30 yards to Pratt, who was stopped
by Tish on the 2. Bowers then
scored on a quarterback sneak
standing up. His conversion was
good.
THIRD SCORE
At the start of the fourth quarter,
Brownson intercepted a pass on his
own 15. and raced 65 yards to the
Menlo 20. Tish catapulted around
left end, aided on a key block by
Merriman on a charging opponent
wingman, and trotted into the end
zone.
A few plays later, with the ball
resting on the Menlo 19, Bowers
went back to kick. Carson Rasmus
sen. in for Bob Rohrer at left end,
blocked the kick, and right end Frank
Heffelfinger, in for Frank Wigmore,
picked up the ball on the two-yard
line and scored, making the point
25-7. The conversion failed.

►
Menlo then took to the air, after
the reverse from Sheridan to Pratt.
Sheridan, now playing quarterback,
hit Grover Boldt on the 28. On the
next play, the same combination
clicked for a pass into the end zone.
Seconds after the kickoff, Sheri
dan spotted Pratt alone on the side
line, and threw 25 yards for the last
score of the game. A pass for the
extra point was good, running the
tally to 25-20.
Stanford's first string went back
into the game, and on the first play
Tish ripped off 12 yards as the gun
sounded.
Mark Heffelfinger broke his nose
in the first quarter, but all indica
tions are that he will be able to play
next week.

Showing great strength in both backfield and line, the Stanford fresh
men opened their season with an easy 25-20 win over Menlo Junior Col
lege last Saturday in the Stadium.
It was the first college team that Francis Wilcox, former Creighton stai
ever put on the field, and his debut was most successful.

The frosh backs, aided by good.,
blocking in the line, had little
trouble bucking 'the line or sweep
ing the ends for long gains. Menlo
set up all scores by passes from
Ward Bowers and Bill Sheridan, two
of them coming when Wilcox had
the third team in the game. Menlo
was able to make but one first down
on the ground.
FROSH SCORE
Stanford got the ball for the first
time after Bowers sent a towering
GO-yard kick to the frosh 15. Then

15 yards on the first play. Jack
Brownson, quarterback, fumbled, but
recovered. Then Lloyd Merriman,
left half, hit right guard for 29 yards.
Steve Tish, fullback, picked up 11
more yards, then packed the ball
again for five. Merriman clicked off
four. Then, on third down, with one
yard to go, Merriman powered over
his own right guard, cut to the left
in the Menlo secondary, picked up
interference, and boomed over for
six points.
Brownson kicked the extra point,
Merriman holding.
SECOND SCORE
After an exchange of kicks,
Brownson returned a punt to the
Menlo 40. Merriman, behind good
interference and sharp blocking,
moved for 25 yards to the 15. He
picked up 10 inside left end for a
first down on the Menlo 5. Tish
bucked over tackle for a touchdown.
Wilcox inserted a whole new team,
which was a little weak on pass de
fense. Bowers, playing a standout
game for the losers, tossed the ball
30 yards to Pratt, who was stopped
by Tish on the 2. Bowers then
scored on a quarterback sneak
standing up. His conversion was
good.
THIRD SCORE
At the start of the fourth quarter,
Brownson intercepted a pass on his
own 15. and raced 65 yards to the
Menlo 20. Tish catapulted around

picked up 10 inside left end for a
first down on the Menlo 5. Tish
bucked over tackle for a touchdown.
Wilcox inserted a whole new team,
which was a little weak on pass de
fense. Bowers, playing a standout
game for the losers, tossed the ball
30 yards to Pratt, who was stopped
by Tish on the 2. Bowers then
scored on a quarterback sneak
standing up. His conversion was
good.
THIRD SCORE
At the start of the fourth quarter,
Brownson intercepted a pass on his
own 15. and raced 65 yards to the
Menlo 20. Tish catapulted around
left end, aided on a key block by
Merriman on a charging opponent
wingman, and trotted into the end
zone.
A few plays later, with the ball
resting on the Menlo 19, Bowers
went back to kick. Carson Rasmus
sen. in for Bob Rohrer at left end,

25-7. The conversion failed.

Menlo then took to the air, after
the reverse from Sheridan to Pratt.
Sheridan, now playing quarterback,
hit Grover Boldt on the 28. On the
next play, the same combination
clicked for a pass into the end zone.
Seconds after the kickoff, Sheri
dan spotted Pratt alone on the side
line, and threw 25 yards for the last
score of the game. A pass for the
extra point was good, running the
tally to 25-20.
Stanford's first string went back
into the game, and on the first play
Tish ripped off 12 yards as the gun
sounded.
Mark Heffelfinger broke his nose
in the first quarter, but all indica
tions are that he will be able to play
next week.
Showing great strength in both backfield and line, the Stanford fresh
men opened their season with an easy 25-20 win over Menlo Junior Col
lege last Saturday in the Stadium.
It was the first college team that Francis Wilcox, former Creighton stai
ever put on the field, and his debut was most successful.

The frosh backs, aided by good.,
blocking in the line, had little
trouble bucking 'the line or sweep
ing the ends for long gains. Menlo
set up all scores by passes from
Ward Bowers and Bill Sheridan, two
of them coming when Wilcox had
the third team in the game. Menlo
was able to make but one first down
on the ground.
FROSH SCORE
Stanford got the ball for the first
time after Bowers sent a towering
GO-yard kick to the frosh 15. Then

15 yards on the first play. Jack
Brownson, quarterback, fumbled, but
recovered. Then Lloyd Merriman,
left half, hit right guard for 29 yards.
Steve Tish, fullback, picked up 11
more yards, then packed the ball
again for five. Merriman clicked off
four. Then, on third down, with one
yard to go, Merriman powered over
his own right guard, cut to the left
in the Menlo secondary, picked up
interference, and boomed over for
six points.
Brownson kicked the extra point,
Merriman holding.
