# Mural Football Needs Officials

### 
Unless more people sign up as
referees, Stanford's intramural foot
ball season may not be able to open
Wednesday or Thursday as planned,
Harry Wolter, director, stated last
night.
"If students aren't interested in
their own program, we may not be
able to run it at all," Wolter said in
announcing that only two men have
applied for officials' jobs thus far.
Students need not be experienced
players to apply for the jobs which
pay 50 cents an hour. An intramural
official usually handles two games
of an hour each in an afternoon.
About 50 teams have signed up for
the fall schedule, including the 10
Encina corridor teams which will
light for the title of the "Brown
stone" League.
Schedules are now being drawn
up. Certain seedings are being made
to spread the strong teams through
out the 10 leagues.
No further action has been taken
about the call for volunteer aircraft
spotters issued by Wolter at the last
intramural meeting Tuesday.
