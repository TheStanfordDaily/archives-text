# The
						Dimes Habit
## 
### 
IN a way Rally Committee symbolizes what
Hollywood thinks ol colleges. It is made up
of pretty little girls decked out in the Stanford
colors with little red axes on their sweaters. It
has to do with mass demonstrations of the old
college spirit, and it has to do with a gay light
life and bustling activity of self-impressed
people.
The Rally Committees that gave birth to
"Konko the Bronko" and "Rekonko the Bronko"
were of this type. They had their duties, to be
sure, but duties of such a nature that they were
rather unimportant by comparison with the
things that are happening throughout the world.
Since last Spring Quarter Rally Committee
has seen a change. It is still in charge of or
ganized cheering at football games, pre-game
rallies, and card tricks, but now it has willingly
assumed a new responsibility.
During Summer Quarter Rally Committee
took over the collecting of the dimes in the
"Dimes for Diplomas" project. Not only did
they take it over but they also put it over. In
the Spring Quarter only $338.19 was collected,
but during the summer, with a much reduced
enrollment to contribute, Rally Committee got
$361.56.
This increase is a tribute to organization
rather than to the increasing generosity of the
student. For the most part the students will
contribute to this project if they are reminded of
it. Under the direction of Jim Mcßrier they
were reminded and the idea of a "dimes habit"
was conceived and an organization was set up
to collect the money.
Ted Barr, a member of Rally Committee, is
now drive director and it is under him that the
Stanford student will again acquire the "dimes
habit."
An efficient, highly organized, well controlled
organization is needed. No group on the Stan
ford campus is better qualified to take on the
job of getting the dimes than the Rally Com
mittee.
So when the new members of the new Rally
Committee come around to you during dinner
tonight to help you get the "dimes habit," for
get Hollywood and the bands and the red and
white sweaters and remember that someday
the war will be over and men will come back
to Stanford who are now in the service.—Al
