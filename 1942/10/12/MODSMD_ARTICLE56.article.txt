# On the Cellar
## 
### 
PLANS are now being worked out so that
the Cellar can be kept open at least later than
8 p.m. on week nights and possibly all day
Sundays. Besides those who are directly con
cerned with the management of the campus
rendezvous, students have suggested several
plans which may be tried very soon.
In today's Campus Opinion we have the
brain child of nine Roble sponsors. Maybe their
plan can be put to work; probably it cannot.
We have learned from past experiences that
student help, while capable, is very uncertain.
That was before the war. Now studies are play
ing a more important place in the student's life,
and there actually isn't time for many of the
organizations to loan their members to do out
side work.
This isn't a reversal of form. It is merely a
recognition of the facts. Manpower has de
creased. But, before many more days have
passed, The Daily promises to bring out a de
tailed plan concerning the Cellar so that it can
be thrown open to all students from opening
time until 10 or 10:30 p.m. We need the Cellar,
and we'll find the men to run it somehow.
