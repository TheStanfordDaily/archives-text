# Welcome Them Home
## 
### 
THREE years ago we saw a pretty sad demon
stration of football on the turf of the stadium.
The next year we saw an undefeated team go
to the Rose Bowl. Last year the tide turned, but
we still had a good team that won a few games.
Where are we now? We have a loser. Al
though football probably shouldn't have been
allowed this year, we have it, and we should
support it. Naturally, we are disappointed, and
we all have ideas as to how we could have
done it last week-end.
But those guys are playing their hearts out
even though they haven't tasted victoryâ€”yet.
They'll be coming home Wednesday. Wouldn't
it be a good idea to meet them at the train and
show them we are still behind them?
