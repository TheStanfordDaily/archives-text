SHIPS FOR VICTORY
When Henry Kaiser launched the "Joseph M.
Teal ' in ten clays and had il outfitted in another
live, people sal up and took notice. A lot of people
wanted to know how it was possible to put a 10.000-
ton freighter together in that short a time.
Things are busy in shipyards these days. On a
sort of assembly line, plates are laid out. cut, and
assembled in huge open-air shops; and whole sec
lions arc put together on dry land. A ship is prac
tically finished before it is laid on llie ways. It is
merely a matter of linking up sections and welding
them together.
That is ihc way the '"Teal was built. If you
have enough men, and enough sections done be
fore you slarl the laying of the keel, it is a simple
matter to gel a ship done in ten days. Kaiser had
both. That is one reason why he got the '"Teal"
done in so short a time.
Inside the yards, most men work hard, but not
too hard. Work is generally spread over a consider
able number of workers so that sometimes when
the right tool is somewhere else, or when the ma
terials fail to arrive on time, there may be some
workers not working every minute of their eight
hours. Of course there are slackers and worthless
men in all yards, but they are being weeded out
and put in the army. At the yard in which I worked,
men worked 12 to 11 hours a day for months in
order to get a ship out on time.
1 5y and large the industry as a whole is working
as hard and as fast as il can to speed I lie* vital ship
ping to win the war.
