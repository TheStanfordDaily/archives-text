# BULL SESSION

I he big barn-like buildings were outlined against
a dark- cloudy sky.
I he three of us had gone down to the Sutler can
nery in South Palo Alto. At school tin*) had told us
that men were needed down there. "Men are scarce;
the maw of the war machine engulfs thousands;
food must go to the troops; students can spare a
liltle time so that food can go; you can do your
minute bit." So we went to the cannery. And the
great barn-buildings stood against the night sk\.
We went into the employment ollice. A smooth,
tired man sat at a desk and told us there was a
difficulty. If we wanted to work at the cannery
very much we would have to join the local AFL
union, l ive bucks initiation fee. buck and a half
a month as long as we worked. We went over to
the union's shack and filled out application blanks.
In this closed shop you have to have become a
union member within ten days of the first lime
you have gone to work or you don t go to work
at all. If you don't go back after the first time
you have worked you don't have to pay. 1 didn't
feel honest about the* process.
We went back to the employment office and the
tired man led us into the cannery proper. There a
foreman named l.upe took us through small moun
tains of can cases to a huge slack of tliirk card
board. The cardboard was later to be folded into
can cases. All we had to do was to pass several
thousand of these bundles down the stack. We
took off our sweaters and jackets.
I climbed to the lop of the stack. We passed the
bulky bundles almost rhythmically. We started to
sweat.
Pretty soon Lupe came back and put one of us
on another job. The two of us continued to drop
the heavy cardboard to the floor. On the door two
soldiers from Page Mill were working with us. One
of them, a tall, red-haired fellow who talked as if
he came from somewhere in the Southwest, was
slacking the bundles about six feel high on little
wooden travs. Then the oilier soldier would wheel
them olf on a hand-truck.
After an hour and a half \\r all knocked olf and
went to gel a drink of water and a spot of relaxa
tion. In the little room set aside for relaxation a
lot of men stood and sat. Most of iheni were smok
ing. A big blond fellow came in. lie said to no one
in particular:
"Hoy, this sure is lough. I go up to Stanford. I'm
only going to work until midnight. \\ i>h I was back
at Mot re Dame with the football team.
i\o one said an) thing. We went back to work.

Pretty soon Lupe came back and put one of us
on another job. The two of us continued to drop
the heavy cardboard to the floor. On the door two
soldiers from Page Mill were working with us. One
of them, a tall, red-haired fellow who talked as if
he came from somewhere in the Southwest, was
slacking the bundles about six feel high on little
wooden travs. Then the oilier soldier would wheel
them olf on a hand-truck.
After an hour and a half \\r all knocked olf and
went to gel a drink of water and a spot of relaxa
tion. In the little room set aside for relaxation a
lot of men stood and sat. Most of iheni were smok
ing. A big blond fellow came in. lie said to no one
in particular:
"Hoy, this sure is lough. I go up to Stanford. I'm
only going to work until midnight. \\ i>h I was back
at Mot re Dame with the football team.
i\o one said an) thing. We went back to work.

I he big barn-like buildings were outlined against
a dark- cloudy sky.
I he three of us had gone down to the Sutler can
nery in South Palo Alto. At school tin*) had told us
that men were needed down there. "Men are scarce;
the maw of the war machine engulfs thousands;
food must go to the troops; students can spare a
liltle time so that food can go; you can do your
minute bit." So we went to the cannery. And the
great barn-buildings stood against the night sk\.
We went into the employment ollice. A smooth,
tired man sat at a desk and told us there was a
difficulty. If we wanted to work at the cannery
very much we would have to join the local AFL
union, l ive bucks initiation fee. buck and a half
a month as long as we worked. We went over to
the union's shack and filled out application blanks.
In this closed shop you have to have become a
union member within ten days of the first lime
you have gone to work or you don t go to work
at all. If you don't go back after the first time
you have worked you don't have to pay. 1 didn't
feel honest about the* process.
We went back to the employment office and the
tired man led us into the cannery proper. There a
foreman named l.upe took us through small moun
tains of can cases to a huge slack of tliirk card
board. The cardboard was later to be folded into
can cases. All we had to do was to pass several
thousand of these bundles down the stack. We
took off our sweaters and jackets.
I climbed to the lop of the stack. We passed the
bulky bundles almost rhythmically. We started to
sweat.
