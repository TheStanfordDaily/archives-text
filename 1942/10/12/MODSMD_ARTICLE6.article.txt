# Pan-Hellenic Urges Transfer Sign-Up
## 
### 
Pan-Hcllenic urges all Greek let
ter transfers to register in the Dean
of Women's office Tuesday, Wednes
day, or Thursday this week. The
transfers are asked to leave their
name, address, the name of their
sorority, and that of their old school.
This sign-up is being effected this
year so that the transfer's sorority
can get to know her better here.
Many sororities invite their trans
fers for lunch every week. Accord
ing to Hank Wallace, president of
Pan-Hellenic, the registration will
facilitate this practice.
