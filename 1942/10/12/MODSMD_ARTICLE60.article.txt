The Editor, Sir:
All of us are agreed that student activities should
be confined to campus — but why begin by closing
the otdy place on campus which provides the in
formal, inexpensive entertainment everyone is
howling about? The basher shortage we under
stand but why not keep the Cellar open evenings
for cokes? Perhaps some enthusiastic and com
petent organization Cardinals, or Rall\ Commit
tee, for instance -could handle some sort of volun
teer work.
A Cardinal could open a coke bottle or pour a
cup of coffee, without detracting too much from
the care and polishing of trophies.
