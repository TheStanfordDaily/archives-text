# 'Aida' Opens War-Time S.F. Season
## 
### 
The San Francisco Opera season's
grand opening Friday night was not
its usual fashion convention; but
the stock performance of "Aida"
was, as usual, successfully impres
sive, though lacking in any consum
mate inspiration.
Frederick Jagel did not look very
aesthetic in his Egyptian gown, nor
did Bruna Castagna and her sev
eral tons sprawled out on the floor
in the last act.
JAGEL OPERATIC
Besides his voice, which never did
clear up, Jagel, who has done some
roles irreproachably, was Friday al
most offensively operatic, yet good
iii certain registers at certain times.
Miss Castagna of course sang Am
neris quite heartily and, except
for traces of age around her voice's
lower edges, quite commendably.
Stella Roman's vocal shortcomings
were largely redeemed by an ex
quisite pianissimo; and she was a
credible Aida, which is better than
having incredible Rethberg sing
hitchlessly.
BASSOS GOOD
Robert Weede, in the leopard skins
of King Amonasro, competed for top
singing honors with High Priest Ezio
Pinza, whose singing was as pretty
as any I've ever heard. These two
bassos, in fact, were the only really
outstanding features of the produc
tion, aside from the ballet costumes
(not the ballet) and the setting of
the third act.
The final duet, incidentally, was
sung exactly like Dr. Popper has
said it should not be sung.—Covey.
