CHICAGO, Oct. 11 (UP).â€”Roger
Touhy, the small, crafty, chisel
faced beer-era gang lord of Chi
cago's Northwest Side who shot his
way out of Statesville Prison with
six others Friday, appeared tonight
to have slipped through police bar
ricades and disappeared in the dust
covered labyrinths of the old under
world.
The 1940 depreciated value of
American highways is estimated at
511,G00,000,000.
