ALASKA DEFENSE COMMAND
HEADQUARTERS, Oct. 11 (UP).—
Four American fighter pilots today
exposed cowardly tricks of Japanese
fliers in air fighting over Kiska and
told how they had found the "sui
cide tactics" of Hirohito's airmen
were "just a bluff."
The airmen, escorting heavy
bombers in raids on Kiska in the
Aleutian Islands, said that in re
cent dogfights with Zero seaplanes,
the Japs have attempted to capital
ize on their reputation for fanati
cism by appearing to dare head-on
collisions with American pilots in
midair.
The Americans dodged at first,
but on the second attempts the
Yanks suspected the bluff and de
liberately held the snouts of their
planes dead on the Japanese "sui
cide" course.
Every time the Japs yielded at
the last instant and have not tried
the suicide bluff since.
