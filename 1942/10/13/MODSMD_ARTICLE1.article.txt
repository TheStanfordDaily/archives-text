# Navy Reveals Japs Sunk Three U.S. Cruisers in August Solomons Battle
## Highest Blow Since Pearl Harbor Downs Quincy, Astoria, Vincennes; 'Majority of Personnel Saved' 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (U.R)—Loss of the U.S. heavy cruisers Quincy,
Astoria and Vincennes during a fierce close-range night battle in the
opening phase of the Solomon Islands invasion last August was revealed
tonight by the Navy which said a majority of the personnel were saved
but that "there still were many casualties."

It was the biggest single blow suf
fered by the fleet since the Japanese
sneak attack on Pearl Harbor Dec. 7
sent five warships to the bottom.
The Navy said news of the sink
ings had been withheld until now
for reasons of military security.
The battle was the same which re
sulted in the sinking of the Austra
lian cruiser Canberra, announced
previously from Australia.
LOSS HAS BEEN OFFSET
"The loss of these four cruisers,"
the Navy said, "has now been offset
by the appropriate reallocation of
ships which is made possible by new
ship construction."
All three American cruisers were
of the Astoria class—commissioned
between 1934 and 1937.
The Quincy was of 8375 tons and
the Vincennes of 9400 tons. Each
carried a normal complement of 952
officers and men. The Astoria was
of 9950 tons and normally carried
899 men.
The three cruisers, hidden in
darkness, were on patrol in the
cloud-shrouded mouth of Tulagi
Harbor when a blinding searchlight
lanced out of the darkness from
the southern end of the bay and
Japanese warships suddenly began
firing shell after shell into the
American squadron.
The Navy communique said:
"There the Japanese force en
countered our northeast screen of
cruisers and destroyers and a battle
at close range results. The action
was fought with guns and torpedoes,
with targets illuminated by search
lights and star shells.
FIRE HEAVY, ACCURATE
"The enemy fire was heavy and
accurate and the U.S. cruisers
Quincy and Vincennes were hit re
peatedly and sank during the night.
"A third cruiser, the U.S. Astoria,
was badly damaged and burned
throughout the night. She sank the
following morning."
But the four cruisers—and what
ever of their personnel perished—
did not die in vain.
The transports and supply ships
they were assigned to guard were
left untouched by the Japs who
"withdrew to the northwest without
attempting an attack" on them.
