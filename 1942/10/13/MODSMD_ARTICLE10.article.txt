## Young Baritone Will Present Program of Spirituals, Classics 
### BOB FISHER 
The distinguished young Negro
baritone, Joseph James, will appear
tonight in the Memorial Hall Audi
torium at 7:30 in the second pro
gram of the current Tuesday eve
ning Series.
Mr. James will present a four-part
musical concert in an hour program.
He will sing 14 compositions in all.
The young baritone will be accom
panied by his wife, Alberta James.
Although he did not make his pro
fessional concert debut until 1933,
James has been in musical perform
ances ever since his youth. He has
sung in choirs since he was 12 years
old, participating in church, high
school, university, and professional
organizations.
HALL JOHNSON CHOIR
He first became known to West
Coast music lovers as a member of
the Hall Johnson Negro Choir.
While with the Hall Johnson Choir,
he appeared in the motion picture
production of "The Green Pastures."
Stanford students may have seen
James at the San Francisco Golden
Gate Exposition where he appeared
in the all colored production of the
"Swing Mikado." He sang the part
of Pooh-Bah.
In reviewing a concert given by
Mr. James last May in San Fran
cisco, Alfred Frankenstein, music
critic of the "Chronicle," said:
"Joseph James presented a mag
nificently chosen program. His big
baritone voice was thoroughly ad
mirable in its depth, power and
quality, and one rarely hears inter
pretations inspired by such flaming
sincerity and devotion to music."
THREE COMPOSERS
The first part of the program this
evening will consist of three classi
cal compositions by well known
composers. The program will open
with "Although an Host Encamp"
by Bach. The other two pieces are
Handel's "Dank sei dir, Herr" and
"Thus Saith the Lord."
Mr. James will then sing three
compositions by Moussorgski. They
are, "In My Attic," "By the Water,"
and "Ah, Not With God's Thunder."
The third part of the program
will consist of four Negro spirituals.
James will pay tribute to his race
with the songs: "On My Journey,"
"Done Foun' My Los' Sheep." "Cru
cifixion," and "Noways Tired."
CONCLUDING PART
The concluding part of the con
cert will consist of four old English
lyrics. The first is the musical ver
sion of Shakespeare's "O Mistress
Mine," arranged by Roger Quilter.
This will be followed by another
Quilter composition entitled "Blow,
Blow, Thou Winter Wind." The
third piece is "Adam Lay Y-Boun
den" by Joan Lloyd. The young
baritone will conclude the concert
with the musical version of Edwin
Arlington Robinson's amusing bal
lad "Miniver Cheevy."
The program will begin promptly
at 7:30. New students are reminded
that there is no charge for the Tues
day Evening Series which is spon
sored by the Committee on Public
Exercises.
