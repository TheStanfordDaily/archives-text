# Special Laboratory To House Marlon Electron Microscope
## 
### 
A special laboratory on campus will house a new and improved model of
the electron microscope which has been under construction at Stanford
University for nearly a year by Dr. Ladislaus Marton, it was announced
yesterday.
The new 100,000-volt instrument should be assembled in its new home

by the end of November. Provision
has also been made in the elec
tronics laboratory for the installa
tion of a million-volt electron
microscope which Dr. Marton will
construct during the coming year.
LAB PLANS
Space has been provided for rooms
for slide preparation: a darkroom, a
power room, and a laboratory for
the new microscope. A room for
X-ray equipment for the study of
industrial radiography will be in
cluded. The X-ray equipment was
recently presented to Stanford by
Dr. F. Rodenbaugh of San Fran
cisco.
Research with and development
of the electron microscope at Stan
ford is being carried out through a
grant of $65,000 to the University
from the Rockefeller Foundation.
It was given last year for the pur
pose of a five-year research pro
gram.
LOCATION GIVEN
The new laboratory will occupy
the space formerly used for the of
fices of Dean Samuel B. Morris of
the School of Engineering and also
the space formerly taken up by the
engineering faculty room in the en
gineering building. The new faculty
for the engineering staff is now in
what was formerly the civil en
gineering library.
