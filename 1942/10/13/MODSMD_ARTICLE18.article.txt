# 18-19 CONSCRIPTION URGED BY F.D.R.
## Forced Labor Rationing In Essential Industries Hinted in Fireside Chat Roosevelt Emphasizes Necessity For Student Work During School, Suggests Holidays for Crop Picking 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP). — President Roosevelt
told the nation in a fireside chat tonight that the time has
come to draft 18- and 19-year-old youths for military service
and that compulsory allocation of industrial and agricultural
manpower will be necessary if a voluntary system fails.
He set no time for drafting the 'teen-agers.
The President also declared that "many major positions of
strategy have been made" in regard to opening second fronts
and said "We have all agreed on one of them—the necessity
of diverting enemy forces from Russia and China to other
war theaters by new offensives against Germany and Japan."
"An announcement of how these offensives are to be
launched, and when, and where," he said, "cannot be broad
cast over the radio at this time."
His remarks obviously were addressed to certain elements
of the press and radio—"typewriter strategists," he called them—"who,"
he said, "burden the public with their bright ideas" of military operations
without having "much information about the facts."
SECOND FRONT FUROR ANSWERED
They also recalled the recent furor over second front statements by
Wendell L. Willkie and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin which he apparently
answered indirectly tonight.
He said there was complete unity among the United Nations high com
mand on when and where necessary offensive operations will be.
The President's words were broadcast nationally and are to be re
broadcast to the world in several languages.
He said the drafting of 'teen-age youths and solution of the war man
power problem are important requisites for "speeding up victory" and
with regard to war production he asserted:
I can say to you that we are getting ahead of our enemies in the
battle of production."
UNBEATABLE SPIRIT OF PEOPLE
Discussing his recent two-week tour of the nation, the chief executive
said he found an "unbeatable spirit" among the people and that they are
"united as never before."
He declared confidently that "We Americans and our Allies are going
to win—and do not let anyone tell you different." But, he added, if
victory is to be speeded, 18- and 19-year-olds must be drafted and we
must "learn to ration manpower."
The President did not prescribe the exact method of assuring thai
the nation's manpower on the home front is distributed so that war pro
duction can be maintained fully and constantly.
TRAINED YOUTH NEEDED
He said his tour convinced him that "all of our combat units that go
overseas must consist of young, strong men who have had thorough
training."
"A division that has an average age of 23 or 24 is a better fighting unit
than one which has an average age of 33 or 34," he said. "The more of
such troops we have in the field, the sooner the war will be won, and the
smaller will be the cost in casualties.
"Therefore, I believe that it will be necessary to lower the present
minimum age limit for selective service from 20 years down to 18. Wc:
have learned how inevitable that is—and how important to the speeding
up of victory."
BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS
Bills are pending in both houses of Congress to lower the draft age
but hearings have been deferred. Many legislators reportedly are reluc
tant to act until after the November elections. Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson is said to have forwarded a letter to the Budget Bureau recom
mending induction of the 18-19 class.
He dealt at length with the problem of adequate manpower and
warned:
"It may be that all of our volunteer efforts—however well intentioned
and well administered—will not suffice to solve the problem. In that case,
we shall have to adopt new legislation. If that is necessary, I do not
believe the people will shrink from it."
MUST STOP WASTING LABOR
". . . We shall be compelled to stop workers from moving from one
war job to another as a matter of personal preference; to stop employers
from stealing labor from each other; to use older men, and handicapped
people, and some women, and even grown boys and girls, wherever pos
sible and reasonable, to replace men of military age and fitness; to train
new personnel for essential war work; and to stop the wastage of labor
in all non-essential activities."
He called upon school officials to work out plans whereby high school
students will be able to take some time from their school year and use
their summer vacations to help farmers raise and harvest their crops or
to work in war industries.
DOES NOT MEAN CLOSING SCHOOLS
"This does not mean closing schools and stopping education," he as
sured. "It does mean giving older students a better opportunity to con
tribute to the war effort. Such work will do no harm to the students."
As for the fighting part of the war, he indicated the tide is turning
in favor of the Allies.

sured. "It does mean giving older students a better opportunity to con
tribute to the war effort. Such work will do no harm to the students."
As for the fighting part of the war, he indicated the tide is turning
in favor of the Allies.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP). — President Roosevelt
told the nation in a fireside chat tonight that the time has
come to draft 18- and 19-year-old youths for military service
and that compulsory allocation of industrial and agricultural
manpower will be necessary if a voluntary system fails.
He set no time for drafting the 'teen-agers.
The President also declared that "many major positions of
strategy have been made" in regard to opening second fronts
and said "We have all agreed on one of them—the necessity
of diverting enemy forces from Russia and China to other
war theaters by new offensives against Germany and Japan."
"An announcement of how these offensives are to be
launched, and when, and where," he said, "cannot be broad
cast over the radio at this time."
His remarks obviously were addressed to certain elements
of the press and radio—"typewriter strategists," he called them—"who,"
he said, "burden the public with their bright ideas" of military operations
without having "much information about the facts."
SECOND FRONT FUROR ANSWERED
They also recalled the recent furor over second front statements by
Wendell L. Willkie and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin which he apparently
answered indirectly tonight.
He said there was complete unity among the United Nations high com
mand on when and where necessary offensive operations will be.
The President's words were broadcast nationally and are to be re
broadcast to the world in several languages.
He said the drafting of 'teen-age youths and solution of the war man
power problem are important requisites for "speeding up victory" and
with regard to war production he asserted:
I can say to you that we are getting ahead of our enemies in the
battle of production."
UNBEATABLE SPIRIT OF PEOPLE
Discussing his recent two-week tour of the nation, the chief executive
said he found an "unbeatable spirit" among the people and that they are
"united as never before."
He declared confidently that "We Americans and our Allies are going
to win—and do not let anyone tell you different." But, he added, if
victory is to be speeded, 18- and 19-year-olds must be drafted and we
must "learn to ration manpower."
The President did not prescribe the exact method of assuring thai
the nation's manpower on the home front is distributed so that war pro
duction can be maintained fully and constantly.
TRAINED YOUTH NEEDED
He said his tour convinced him that "all of our combat units that go
overseas must consist of young, strong men who have had thorough
training."
"A division that has an average age of 23 or 24 is a better fighting unit
than one which has an average age of 33 or 34," he said. "The more of
such troops we have in the field, the sooner the war will be won, and the
smaller will be the cost in casualties.
"Therefore, I believe that it will be necessary to lower the present
minimum age limit for selective service from 20 years down to 18. Wc:
have learned how inevitable that is—and how important to the speeding
up of victory."
BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS
Bills are pending in both houses of Congress to lower the draft age
but hearings have been deferred. Many legislators reportedly are reluc
tant to act until after the November elections. Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson is said to have forwarded a letter to the Budget Bureau recom
mending induction of the 18-19 class.
He dealt at length with the problem of adequate manpower and
warned:
"It may be that all of our volunteer efforts—however well intentioned
and well administered—will not suffice to solve the problem. In that case,
we shall have to adopt new legislation. If that is necessary, I do not
believe the people will shrink from it."
MUST STOP WASTING LABOR
". . . We shall be compelled to stop workers from moving from one
war job to another as a matter of personal preference; to stop employers
from stealing labor from each other; to use older men, and handicapped
people, and some women, and even grown boys and girls, wherever pos
sible and reasonable, to replace men of military age and fitness; to train
new personnel for essential war work; and to stop the wastage of labor
in all non-essential activities."
He called upon school officials to work out plans whereby high school
students will be able to take some time from their school year and use
their summer vacations to help farmers raise and harvest their crops or
to work in war industries.

"This does not mean closing schools and stopping education," he as
sured. "It does mean giving older students a better opportunity to con
tribute to the war effort. Such work will do no harm to the students."
As for the fighting part of the war, he indicated the tide is turning
in favor of the Allies.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 12 (UP). — President Roosevelt
told the nation in a fireside chat tonight that the time has
come to draft 18- and 19-year-old youths for military service
and that compulsory allocation of industrial and agricultural
manpower will be necessary if a voluntary system fails.
He set no time for drafting the 'teen-agers.
The President also declared that "many major positions of
strategy have been made" in regard to opening second fronts
and said "We have all agreed on one of them—the necessity
of diverting enemy forces from Russia and China to other
war theaters by new offensives against Germany and Japan."
"An announcement of how these offensives are to be
launched, and when, and where," he said, "cannot be broad
cast over the radio at this time."
His remarks obviously were addressed to certain elements
of the press and radio—"typewriter strategists," he called them—"who,"
he said, "burden the public with their bright ideas" of military operations
without having "much information about the facts."
SECOND FRONT FUROR ANSWERED
They also recalled the recent furor over second front statements by
Wendell L. Willkie and Soviet Premier Josef Stalin which he apparently
answered indirectly tonight.
He said there was complete unity among the United Nations high com
mand on when and where necessary offensive operations will be.
The President's words were broadcast nationally and are to be re
broadcast to the world in several languages.
He said the drafting of 'teen-age youths and solution of the war man
power problem are important requisites for "speeding up victory" and
with regard to war production he asserted:
I can say to you that we are getting ahead of our enemies in the
battle of production."
UNBEATABLE SPIRIT OF PEOPLE
Discussing his recent two-week tour of the nation, the chief executive
said he found an "unbeatable spirit" among the people and that they are
"united as never before."
He declared confidently that "We Americans and our Allies are going
to win—and do not let anyone tell you different." But, he added, if
victory is to be speeded, 18- and 19-year-olds must be drafted and we
must "learn to ration manpower."
The President did not prescribe the exact method of assuring thai
the nation's manpower on the home front is distributed so that war pro
duction can be maintained fully and constantly.
TRAINED YOUTH NEEDED
He said his tour convinced him that "all of our combat units that go
overseas must consist of young, strong men who have had thorough
training."
"A division that has an average age of 23 or 24 is a better fighting unit
than one which has an average age of 33 or 34," he said. "The more of
such troops we have in the field, the sooner the war will be won, and the
smaller will be the cost in casualties.
"Therefore, I believe that it will be necessary to lower the present
minimum age limit for selective service from 20 years down to 18. Wc:
have learned how inevitable that is—and how important to the speeding
up of victory."
BILLS PENDING IN CONGRESS
Bills are pending in both houses of Congress to lower the draft age
but hearings have been deferred. Many legislators reportedly are reluc
tant to act until after the November elections. Secretary of War Henry L.
Stimson is said to have forwarded a letter to the Budget Bureau recom
mending induction of the 18-19 class.
He dealt at length with the problem of adequate manpower and
warned:
"It may be that all of our volunteer efforts—however well intentioned
and well administered—will not suffice to solve the problem. In that case,
we shall have to adopt new legislation. If that is necessary, I do not
believe the people will shrink from it."
MUST STOP WASTING LABOR
". . . We shall be compelled to stop workers from moving from one
war job to another as a matter of personal preference; to stop employers
from stealing labor from each other; to use older men, and handicapped
people, and some women, and even grown boys and girls, wherever pos
sible and reasonable, to replace men of military age and fitness; to train
new personnel for essential war work; and to stop the wastage of labor
in all non-essential activities."
He called upon school officials to work out plans whereby high school
students will be able to take some time from their school year and use
their summer vacations to help farmers raise and harvest their crops or
to work in war industries.
