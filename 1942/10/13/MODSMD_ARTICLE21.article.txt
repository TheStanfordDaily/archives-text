BOMBEIt TRIO! Here they are, the three Notre Dame stars that put
together a sensational passing offense Saturday to tumble the Indians,
27-0. Lower left. Boh Dove, left end; top left, Capt. George Murphy;
above, Angelo Bertelli, quarterback. Bertelli tossed two touchdown
aerials to Dove, one to Murphy, and a fourth to Joe Limont, suit end.
