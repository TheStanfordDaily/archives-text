### BOB SONTAG 
pOOTBALL PLIGHT:
The best thing anybody can say
right as regards the plight of Stan
ford's thrice-beaten football team
j is that back in 1939 the varsity grid
ders lost every conference and in
tersectional ball game in the season,
excepting Dartmouth.
Right now the score stands three
love and stands to become all the
more romantic unless salve is found
for the ailing Indian pass defense.
Every team Stanford has yet to
play knows the Redskins are vul
nerable through the air. Idaho
brings down Howard Manson next
j Saturday, and he'll be pitching like
Johnny Beazley if the coaching staff
doesn't go into a long strategem con
j fab on how to blow up those aerial
| bombs before they land.
Cognizant observations on pass
defense at (his point are:
j I—The backfield just isn't pass
I conscious. Pictures of the Santa
I Clara and Washington State con
| tests show the boys cannot antici
pate the play and when it does
| come down their alley all are
dumb-struck.
2 —Speed is not utilized. Fast
of-footness shown on the track
and on the practice field doesn't
exert itself during the actual play.
The remedy?
A big order for Coach Marchie
! Schwartz is to find the right com
! bination of four men, plus the line
; backer-upper which makes a five
man backfield on defense. Not an
unearthly guess would be to insert
a strictly defensive backfield when
on defense and Switch when the ball
is regained. With unlimited sub-
I stitutions prevailing, this could be
done with no trouble at all.
Only trouble with that system is
to first find the men who can work
j it out.
Rather than try to pick out some
thing we have no business fooling
with, we'll watch practice when the
lads come home and rate it off the
; workouts preceding the Ida ho
[ match.
