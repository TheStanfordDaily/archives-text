# MURAL MANAGERS:
## 
### 
The best part of the intra
mural sports program at Stanford,
football, is going out the window
unless Director Harry Wolter is
able to find some referees. Cer
tainly there are enough teams
already signed to volunteer the
services of one of their men for a
game. Wolter desires men who
really know the rules and can put
them into effect. But if he can't
get experienced refs. the teams
will necessarily have to throw one
of their own men into the breach.
Better hurry, too. the season
should get under way tomorrow
or Thursdav.
