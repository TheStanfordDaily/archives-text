# CONFERENCE RACE:
## 
### 
Experts this week will try to

I outpick themselves in a Pacific
| Coast Conference race that has all
the aspects of a Mark Hellinger
| short story except that the punch
ending won't come for a long time
J because the teams are going crazy
beating each other and leaving only
Washington State and UCLA unde
feated in conference play.
At this writing we pick brother
Bruin from Los Angeles to cop the
apple. The Bruins whitewashed last
year's Rose Bowler, Oregon State,
in the week's nicest upset—there
were plenty of 'em—and off that
one should go on to greater things,
like beating California at Berkeley
: next Saturday. Bob Waterfield, who
I led the Coast in yardage gained
j from passing last year, is on t'e
i beam, and another aerial outfit like
I that could sure ruin Stanford—un
j less that defense blossoms out.
