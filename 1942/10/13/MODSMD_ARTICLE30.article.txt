### 
Football interests of hundreds of Stanfordites, on the How, in the halls,
and in the hidden and unhidden lairs of graduate students and faculty
members, swing for a time away from varsity schedules Friday afternoon
when the first of 52 intramural teams under Director Harry YVolter will
open the I!M2 season.

become the most popular non-var

repeatedly stated to managers that
"this is your own program; its suc
cess depends upon you."

Encina will have its "Brownstone
League" of 10 teams, fighting for the
frosh championship won last year
by the soph transfer floor, 4W.
The officiating situation which
threatened to hamper the entire
program has been solved through
the co-operation of students who
volunteered to Wolter yesterday
Others who wish the 50-cent-per
hour jobs are still asked to apply.

No changes have been made in the
rules listed in the red handbook
published by the School of Health
covering intramural organization
