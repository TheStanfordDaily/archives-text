# Heffner Asks For Woman's Debate Society
## Drama Prof Favors Equal Speech Chance For Stanford Girls 
### ED CONN 
"A well organized women's de
hate society is something that Stan
lord University sadly lacks," ac
cording to Hubert Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and member
of the speech and drama depart
ment, "and a girl has hardly a
chance to succeed in Stanford de
bating under the present set-up."
"Numerous times since I've been
at Stanford, women students have
asked me how they could try out for
debating. There only being one such
organization in the school, the var
sity debate team, I've always direct
ed them to that, but in most cases
their efforts are in vain. On the
varsity team they must compete with
men who have had experience since
high school days and on through
college, men who've worked to
gether for hours and hours at a
time."
WOMEN MAY COMPETE
Mr. Heffner hopes to organize
such a society to give Stanford
women a chance to receive equiva
lent training as the men students, so
that they may compete with not
only the varsity but also other
schools.
"In the next few months Stanford
will be presenting radio panel dis
cussions from our own station here
at Memorial Theater concerned with
the students and the war, and for
women to participate on the broad
casts as well as men would add
greatly to the program," Heffner
added.
Such organizations have already
appeared at California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. on the Coast, and nearly
every middle western school has
women's debate societies. "In fact at
Northwestern where I taught for
nine years, women regarded debating
as an excellent preparation for bus
iness and law, and those who had
outstanding records in debating were
almost assured entrance into law
school despite just an average schol
astic rating."
TRAINING FOR ARMY
"I want to see Stanford debating
on a well organized basis with as
many people as possible benefitting
from it," Heffner commented. "Of
late, the U.S. Army has greatly rec
ognized the importance of speech
training for officers, and has insti
tuted a course at officers' school for
that special purpose."
Just as the Army found that
numerous men are unable to address
successfully a group of enlisted
tloops, likewise men of great in
telligence in everyday life are ham
pered because of an inferiority com
plex based upon their inability to
face large assemblies of people,
Heffner concluded.

"Numerous times since I've been
at Stanford, women students have
asked me how they could try out for
debating. There only being one such
organization in the school, the var
sity debate team, I've always direct
ed them to that, but in most cases
their efforts are in vain. On the
varsity team they must compete with
men who have had experience since
high school days and on through
college, men who've worked to
gether for hours and hours at a
time."
WOMEN MAY COMPETE
Mr. Heffner hopes to organize
such a society to give Stanford
women a chance to receive equiva
lent training as the men students, so
that they may compete with not
only the varsity but also other
schools.
"In the next few months Stanford
will be presenting radio panel dis
cussions from our own station here
at Memorial Theater concerned with
the students and the war, and for
women to participate on the broad
casts as well as men would add
greatly to the program," Heffner
added.
Such organizations have already
appeared at California, U.S.C., and
U.C.L.A. on the Coast, and nearly
every middle western school has
women's debate societies. "In fact at
Northwestern where I taught for
nine years, women regarded debating
as an excellent preparation for bus
iness and law, and those who had
outstanding records in debating were
almost assured entrance into law
school despite just an average schol
astic rating."
TRAINING FOR ARMY
"I want to see Stanford debating
on a well organized basis with as
many people as possible benefitting
from it," Heffner commented. "Of
late, the U.S. Army has greatly rec
ognized the importance of speech
training for officers, and has insti
tuted a course at officers' school for
that special purpose."
Just as the Army found that
numerous men are unable to address
successfully a group of enlisted
tloops, likewise men of great in
telligence in everyday life are ham
pered because of an inferiority com
plex based upon their inability to
face large assemblies of people,
Heffner concluded.
"A well organized women's de
hate society is something that Stan
lord University sadly lacks," ac
cording to Hubert Heffner, professor
of dramatic literature and member
