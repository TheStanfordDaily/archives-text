# Group To Discuss Rogers' Campaign
## 
### 
Discussing the possibilities of
backing the political campaign of
Will Rogers Jr., Delta Sigma Rho,
Stanford's honorary speech frater
nity, will hold a meeting Wednesday
evening at the home of Dr. Lee
Chapin, debate coach.
In view of the fact thai Mr. Rogers
was formerly a debater at the Uni
versity, members of the group will
try to decide as to the possibilities
of backing his campaign on the
campus.
The candidate to Congress, a son
of the late humorist, is running as
a liberal Democrat. The campaign
has not as yet become a matter of
much importance on the campus,
but according to Frank Bauman,
president of the fraternity, a pro
gram may be scheduled to arouse
interest.
The meeting will convene at 7:30
and should be an interesting one.
