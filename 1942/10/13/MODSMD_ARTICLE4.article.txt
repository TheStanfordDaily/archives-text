# Davis Requests Removal of Bikes
## 
### 
The drive to get bicycles off the
Quad had had disappointing results,
according to Police Chief Gordy
Davis, since vehicles are still to be
found leaning against walls, espe
cially by Johdan Hall and in back of
the Physics Department.
Student response to the drive is
still voluntary, but if carelessness
in this respect is continued bicycles
will be picked up and placed in
storage. A fee will be charged the
claimants.
Chief Davis also remarked that
the rubber and gas shortages have
promoted running board riding as
use is made by the greatest pos
sible number of people of each ride
into town. Drivers offering rides on
their running boards will, however,
be subject to a fine of $1 per person
on the outside of their cars.
