# For Better Tests
## 
### 
STUDENTS have always wanted to do away
with the examination system. There are
many arguments advanced by those who main
tain that tests—midquarters and finals—should
not be done away with. We grant these points,
but we would like to point out a few revisions
which might better the present system.
Since most students have or will have real
ized before long that school work should come
first, other activities next, most of us are attend
ing our classes regularly and concentrating on
studies. If this is true, then wouldn't it be better
to test the student's knowledge of a course than
to examine his ability to outcram his fellow
students?
By this we mean that under the present ex
amination system, we don't and the teachers
don't discover what we know; we are merely
conducting mass memory tests. To be strictly
radical, why should teachers announce their
tests? The best way to find out what one knows
is to quiz him without allowing him a chance to
fill his brain with a collection of worthless facts
which will disappear the minute the test is over.
With this system the student will be forced
to review his notes and keep up with his work.
He will find that when he has finished his
course he will have done more than take up a
seat in a lecture room; he will have learned at
least a little about the course that will stick
with him.
Many of us are taking certain courses because
of requirements pushed down our throats by
the Army, Navy, and Marines. The knowledge
we gain from these courses is not supposed to
be superficial. It is supposed to be complete.
Then, why should girls be put under this
system? There are always those girls who
come to college to find a husband. There's
nothing wrong with that except for the fact that
they are wasting a lot of people's time and
jnoney. The girls will find that they will get
a lot more enjoyment out of later life if they
can grasp a subject in conversation and back
it up with facts learned at college in a poli sci
course or some other "unimportant" class.
They will find that they will command much
more respect, and they will probably be able
to get a better type of husband. But that's their
business and not the worry of a newspaper.
It's too bad that the football special carry
ing our defeated gridmen home from Notre
Dame won't arrive in Palo Alto until 11:30
a.m. tomorrow. It isn't right to ask students
to cut classes to welcome the team back, but
those who are unoccupied should show up
at the depot.
