# Football Tickets

### 
THERE should not be any screaming tomor
row or the rest of the quarter about tickets
irom the B.A.C. for the U.S.C., U.C.L.A., or Cal
games, for there has been sufficient publicity on
the campus about the days and time to buy the
tickets.
The B.A.C. has a tremendous amount of work
to do handling the athletic end of the Univer
sity; so it is easy to.understand why unkind
and unwarranted comments are not welcome
when there has been plenty of publicity about
such matters as ticket sales.
Obviously, many of us do not agree with
the B.A.C. on many questions such as the loan
ing of student body cards, charging for the
games, etc., but when we have been warned and
the policy has been established, we should help
matters instead of hinderinq them.
