KIPLING WOULD lIATE ME
I do not always agree wilh the editorial tone of
Life Magazine. It is very often possible to detect
a consciousness therein that llie\ stand, if not at
God's right hand, at least at his left, lint they make
a most excellent and cogent point in their last week s
issue, when in an open letter to the British people,
they point out that the United [Nations are not fight
ing to maintain the British Kmpire.
I his statement is of particular cogency when the
situation in India is considered. The I niled States,
and, I feel sure, China, the USSR, and the rest of
the civilized world, are not fighting to maintain an
old-fashioned colonial tyranny in India. There is
something particularly disgusting about the report
that Conservatives in the House of Commons
cheered a statement hv the Secretary of State for
India that RAF planes had strafed Indian mobs.
I am not qualified to give a final verdict on the
situation in India. But it would seem that if the
people of that troubled land, or a majority of them,
demand independence, thev, by the principles of
the Atlantic Charter, and by the express*, terms of
our Declaration of Independence, should have it.
But there has not yet been sufficient demonstration
of this opinion. True, the members of the Con
gress party are rioting and dying for their objective,
and true, leaders of various less prominent groups
issue continual pronuneiainentos, but there are 3
or 4 hundred million Indians and the numbers of
adherents of all parties combined, even if they
agreed with each other, would not constitute a
majority.
What course, then, should be pursued? The
British and the Indians, of the Congress parly in
particular, have been unable to agree on an\thing.
Recent developments make it seem unlikely that
the y ever w ill agree. The only suggestion that 1 can
make is that a committee, wilh authority to make a
final decision, be appointed from llie I niled States.
Russia, and China; that it investigate; and that it
make ils decision, on the basis of a plebiscite, if
necessary. We are told thai an era of internation
alism is approaching; this would seem to be an
opportunity to launch it.
