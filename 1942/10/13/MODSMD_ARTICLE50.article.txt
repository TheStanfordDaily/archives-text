### Bill Steif 
[This is the last halj of yesterday's Bull Session)
About 11:30 Lupe came around and put us all on
different jobs. 1 stenciled cases of hot sauce and
•loaded them onto a handlruck. I was supposed to
wheel the cases over to the other side of tlie room.
About three-quarters of ihe way over on my first
trip I lost my balance and crash—there were several
dozen tins of hot sauce all over the floor. The fore
man of the hot sauce line came over and helped
me pick up. Then he showed me how to use a hand
truck. One of the buxom little Portuguese girls on
the hot sauce line laughed. I was embarrassed.
But it went better after thai.
Then at midnight came an hour off. lunchtime.
I met one of my friends and we went over to
the cannery cafeteria. It was crowded. Short, fat,
dark women, big bronzed soldiers, heavy-muscled
men all nudged toward the meatballs which were
that night's special. We had hot beef sandwiches
and sal down with a couple of soldiers who had not
gotten the jobs they had come for that night. They
had been drinking beer since about 9 o'clock. They
were talking about the bottle they were going to bu\
Ihe next night. They were drunk.
At 1 we went back into the plant. White-aproned
women came in with us. talking away in Portuguese.
We wheeled handtrucks around for a bit and
then a foreman came over and gave us new jobs.
I was put at the end of a conveyor belt from which
cases full of tinned tomato soup continuous!) issued.
With me was a stocky, bald man of about 3<5 or 10
years named Agusto Gonzales. We had to pick the
cases off the belt and pile them nine high. Agusto
tried to explain the technique of throwing cases
around to me in pantomime. He didn't know very
much Knglish.
After a while it occurred to me that the cases
were heavy. I looked down and saw on a case words
which read: '"Not under 12 lbs., not over 65 lbs."
I suddenly fell awfully tired.
But Agusto and myself worked on to 0 a.m.
At (> my friend and myself left. M\ other friend
worked on until <> o'clock. It was just beginning to
get light. The clouds >lill stood in
the sky. I was tired, but that was all right.
It is surprising how much one can learn in big
barn-like structures.

barn-like structures.
[This is the last halj of yesterday's Bull Session)
About 11:30 Lupe came around and put us all on
different jobs. 1 stenciled cases of hot sauce and
•loaded them onto a handlruck. I was supposed to
wheel the cases over to the other side of tlie room.
About three-quarters of ihe way over on my first
trip I lost my balance and crash—there were several
dozen tins of hot sauce all over the floor. The fore
man of the hot sauce line came over and helped
me pick up. Then he showed me how to use a hand
truck. One of the buxom little Portuguese girls on
the hot sauce line laughed. I was embarrassed.
But it went better after thai.
Then at midnight came an hour off. lunchtime.
I met one of my friends and we went over to
the cannery cafeteria. It was crowded. Short, fat,
dark women, big bronzed soldiers, heavy-muscled
men all nudged toward the meatballs which were
that night's special. We had hot beef sandwiches
and sal down with a couple of soldiers who had not
gotten the jobs they had come for that night. They
had been drinking beer since about 9 o'clock. They
were talking about the bottle they were going to bu\
Ihe next night. They were drunk.
At 1 we went back into the plant. White-aproned
women came in with us. talking away in Portuguese.
We wheeled handtrucks around for a bit and
then a foreman came over and gave us new jobs.
I was put at the end of a conveyor belt from which
cases full of tinned tomato soup continuous!) issued.
With me was a stocky, bald man of about 3<5 or 10
years named Agusto Gonzales. We had to pick the
cases off the belt and pile them nine high. Agusto
tried to explain the technique of throwing cases
around to me in pantomime. He didn't know very
much Knglish.
After a while it occurred to me that the cases
were heavy. I looked down and saw on a case words
which read: '"Not under 12 lbs., not over 65 lbs."
I suddenly fell awfully tired.
But Agusto and myself worked on to 0 a.m.
At (> my friend and myself left. M\ other friend
worked on until <> o'clock. It was just beginning to
get light. The clouds >lill stood in
the sky. I was tired, but that was all right.
It is surprising how much one can learn in big
barn-like structures.
