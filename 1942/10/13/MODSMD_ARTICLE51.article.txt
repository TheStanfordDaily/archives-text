## BUCK ROGERS 
### 
The Kdi tor, Sir:
Is Stanford so juvenile that it must have Buck
Rogers with its Sunda\ movies? Is the need so
great that the same B. R. that was shown last \ear
is shown again this \ear. presumably because no
other lÂ». R. was available? Does the Sundax Series
have In slum a serial to make people eome? What
can we do about it? Many of us go to see the
classic picture \ct must be insulted In the absurdi
ties. scientific contradictious, and repititious plot
of B. I!. At least us horse opera!
