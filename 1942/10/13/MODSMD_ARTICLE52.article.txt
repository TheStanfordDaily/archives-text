# Future Stanford Production Praised on New York Stage

"The Eve of St. Mark," Maxwell Anderson's newest play which will he
presented here November 4, 5, (J. 7 ami !) by the Stanford Players, opened
for its first Broadway showing last Wednesday and received enthusiastic
nation-wide publicity.
Mark Barron, famed New York drama critic, writing for the Wide World
under an Oct. 11 dateline, com- +

mented:
"Much of the lusty quality which
made his first great success, "What
Price Glory?", so memorable is found
again in Maxwell Anderson's new
est play, "The Eve of St. Mark."
SOLDIER SUBJECT
"Here again he deals with Ameri
can soldiers, and he writes of them
with fine color and vigor. But here
he talks not only of the coarse life
of Army camps, but also of the sol
dier's home and family and fiancee."
The play tells a beautiful love
story against the background of
harsh war, with the hero fighting for
his life on Bataan.
"There is tenderness in his play,
and passion, and a plea to our audi
ence to understand the things a man
lights for and the impulses that
make him want to be an honorable
soldier," Mr. Barron continued.
COMIC ARMY SCENES
Judging from the reviews, the play
has wide appeal, and should meet
with considerable success before
university and community audi
ences, for Mr. Barron says:
"In his scenes in the barracks, in
the bar-rooms, in the forlorn outpost
in the Philippines, Anderson pre
sents a rolicking group of soldiers.
It is doubtful if he has ever written
better comic scenes. He manages
his romantic scenes simply and with
great tenderness, forsaking the blank
verse that has characterized his re
cent plays."
