# Bawl-Out Proofs Posted in Ad. Bldg.
## 
### 
Bawl-out proofs will be posted
today. Tuesday, from 9 to 5, on the
Administration Building bulletin
board. Students are asked to check
their own listings to see if they are
correct. If an error appears, the
students should report it to the reg
istrar's office.
The bawl-out is a quarterly pub
lication in which appears the stu
dent's name, home town, depart
ment, division (lower or upper),
units, residence on campus, and post
office box. Students may purchase
the bawl-outs later in the quarter.
