# S.W.S. Fries To Untangle Labor Crisis
## Transportation and AFL Union Troubles Snag Farm Workers 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Drew Peax-son quoted the Presi
dent Monday as saying that "the
manpower problem isn't as serious
as a lot of people are trying to make
us believe," and that he was fully
confident it would be licked the
American way.
Yesterday, War Board repre
sentatives quoted Sutter Personnel
Manager Heinecke as saying "the
cannery labor problem is well in
hand at present, but the future is
unpredictable."
Last week, Stanford got wind of a
labor shortage in local canneries
and set out to lick it the American
way. A large crew of Farm volun
teers besieged four canneries in an
effort to bolster the asserted short
age. But they returned, muttering
about union difficulties, no job va
cancies or transportation.
VISIT CANNERY
A committee was designated by
the War Board to supervise the
cannery labor program. Yesterday,
accompanied by Miss Helen Vin
cent of the U.S. Employment Bu
reau, the committee called on the
Sutter cannery intending to work
out a co-operative program for
Stanford labor.
This is the answer they got. At
present, the Sutter plant has a full
crew of workers, thanks to a score
of Page Mill army volunteers. How
ever, the ranks of cannery workers
may fall fiat at any time. With this
eventuality, a call may be issued
for Stanford workers on short no
tice.
UNION PROBLEM
As for union membership. The
cannery holds a closed shop con
tract, and a clause reads that all
workers "must affiliate within ten
days." The cannery is powerless to
make any modifications to exempt
part-time Stanford workers from
union membership.
However, this is the report of only
one cannery. Others apparently
need help and the War Board com
mittee has made arrangements to
keep informed of the labor demand
through the employment office.
Representatives of men's houses arc
asked to maintain co-operation with
the War Board and be ready to fill
a sudden demand.
