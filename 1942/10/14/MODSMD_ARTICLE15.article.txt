## Fleet Intercepts Enemy on Return To Solomon Fight 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (U.R) —
American Fleet units, returning to
the Battle of the Solomons, sank a
Japanese heavy cruiser, four de
stroyers and a transport during a
fierce 30-minute battle Sunday night
in perhaps the biggest single blow
delivered against the enemy fleet
there, the navy disclosed tonight.
The new land drive resulted in
"many" Jap troop casualties. Those
attacks were completed Sunday—a
few hours before the American Task
Force of cruisers and destroyers in
tercepted the Jap fleet unit and
pounded it into defeat.
Today's two navy communiques
brought the box score of destruction
for the two actions to:
Six Japanese ships sunk (one
heavy cruiser, four destroyers and
a transport.)
One Jap destroyer probably sunk.
Three Jap cruisers damaged—one,
and possibly two, of them crippled
and knocked out of action.
