# Russians Recapture Stalingrad Positions
## 
### 
MOSCO, Wednesday, Oct. 14 (U.R)
—Russian troops, wresting the ini
tiative from the Germans in key sec
tors of the now wintry southern
front, recaptured lost positions in
Stalingrad yesterday and cut a new
gash in the Nazi flank to the north
west, a Red army communique said
today.
"In the Stalingrad area our troops
recaptured positions which they had
lost the day before in one district of
the town," the high command said
in its only mention of infantry acti
vity inside the Volga city.
GERMAN ATTACK FAILS
Thus the enfeebled burst of Ger
man attacks Monday shaped up as a
flash in the pan instead of the indi
cated resumption of full-scale ef
forts to complete the conquest of
Stalingrad by direct assault.
The late communique and supple
mentary front reports said the Ger
mans now were on the defensive at
Stalingrad and on both wings of
the Caucasus front, on which winter
j had clamped its first numbing grip.
Significant of the change in the
situation on the lower Soviet front,
the preamble to the midnight com
munique said merely that "no
changes took place on the fronts"—
for the first time in weeks failing to
report big scale hostilities in speci
fied areas.
RUSS NAZI CANNON DUEL
Russian and German cannon still
dueled over Stalingrad, the high
command said. Red army artillery
men were credited with knocking
out three German tanks, three ar
tillery and 16 trench mortar bat
teries, and 10 enemy field fortifica
tions.
Soviet guardsmen attacked Ger
man forward positions northwest of
Stalingrad, the official bulletin said,
and "pressed the Germans back
somewhat." They also destroyed
one anti-tank gun, 16 machine guns
and one mortar battery.

Stalingrad and on both wings of
the Caucasus front, on which winter
j had clamped its first numbing grip.
Significant of the change in the
situation on the lower Soviet front,
the preamble to the midnight com
munique said merely that "no
changes took place on the fronts"—
for the first time in weeks failing to
report big scale hostilities in speci
fied areas.
RUSS NAZI CANNON DUEL
Russian and German cannon still
dueled over Stalingrad, the high
command said. Red army artillery
men were credited with knocking
out three German tanks, three ar
tillery and 16 trench mortar bat
teries, and 10 enemy field fortifica
tions.
Soviet guardsmen attacked Ger
man forward positions northwest of
Stalingrad, the official bulletin said,
and "pressed the Germans back
somewhat." They also destroyed
one anti-tank gun, 16 machine guns
and one mortar battery.
MOSCO, Wednesday, Oct. 14 (U.R)
—Russian troops, wresting the ini
tiative from the Germans in key sec
tors of the now wintry southern
front, recaptured lost positions in
Stalingrad yesterday and cut a new
gash in the Nazi flank to the north
west, a Red army communique said
today.
"In the Stalingrad area our troops
recaptured positions which they had
lost the day before in one district of
the town," the high command said
in its only mention of infantry acti
vity inside the Volga city.
GERMAN ATTACK FAILS
Thus the enfeebled burst of Ger
man attacks Monday shaped up as a
flash in the pan instead of the indi
cated resumption of full-scale ef
forts to complete the conquest of
Stalingrad by direct assault.
The late communique and supple
mentary front reports said the Ger
mans now were on the defensive at
Stalingrad and on both wings of
the Caucasus front, on which winter
j had clamped its first numbing grip.
