Rally Committee discusscd plans
for bigger, but fewer rallies last
night, at its first meeting since the
tryoutee period. Plans were made
for the Idaho and S.C. games, and
pompom stunts to take the place of
card stunts were worked out.
No rally will be held before the
Idaho game, but the committee re
quested that the student body wear
white shirts and rooters' caps. There
will be separate sections for the
men and women. The band will per
form during the half.
Pat George and Bob Ashley will
take charge of the S.C. rally, which
will be followed by the annual Pa
jamarino, handled by Louis Sloss.
Martha Thurman asked the girls
to hand in simple plans for pompom
stunts to be started at the S.C. game.
Six hundred girls will form de
signs by raising their pompoms as
directed by the cheer leaders, some
thing new to the Stanford rooting
section. Pompoms will be on sale
in the A.S.S.U. office on Friday
from 1 o'clock to 5, and Saturday
from 8 o'clock to 12.
Jim Mc√ürier, president, when
asked his opinion of the new Rally
Committee, said, "It's wonderful."
