WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (U.R)—
President Roosevelt today ordered
federal seizure of plants of Triumph
Explosives, Inc., and two Delaware
subsidiaries after disclosure of an
alleged "bribery" scandal involving
company officials and civilian in
spectors for the army and navy.
The White House said a prelimi
nary inquiry by the navy which took
over the plants, indicated that "more
than $1,000,000 in management 'ir
regularities' may be involved."
Five persons alleged to have been
implicated—two company men and
three inspectors—were arrested on
bribery charges by FBI agents.
