## 
### 
Sunday night's showing of a
chaptcr of "Buck Rogers" serial,
which ran last year on the bi
weekly campus movie series, was
a mistake of the San Francisco
film company from whom the
movies arc leased, acording to the
A.S.S.U. office. The instructions
of "Ham" Howard, selector of the
current series, had been for an
other serial. Miss Howard has ar
ranged that the same mistake will
not be made twice, and that on the
second movie program, a week
from Sunday, either a new serial,
or a continuation of last summer's
("Chandu, the Magician") will be
shown.
