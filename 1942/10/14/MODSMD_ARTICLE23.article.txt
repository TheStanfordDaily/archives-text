# Diploma Drive Hits New High
## 
### 
Setting a new collection record of
$131.80, seven Stanford living groups
contributed 100 per cent in helping
to make the first fall "Dimes for
Diplomas" campaign an outstanding
success, Chairman Ted Barr said
yesterday.
Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Nu, Al
pha Tau Omega, Walter Thompson
Co-op House, Madrona, Alpha
Omicron Pi, Delta Delta Delta, Delta
Gamma, Kappa Kappa Gamma, Pi
Phi, El Toro—there are the groups
on the "honor" list.
In addition to the distinct units,
Encina broke all previous records
with a $22.16 donation, while three
Roble corridors —18, IA, 2B—gave
100%, helping to make that hall's
total gift of $17.63.
FAIL TO CONTRIBUTE
Three fraternities, Kappa Sigma,
Delta Kappa Epsilon, and Sigma
Alpha Epsilon, were not listed as
contributors, Barr stated.
Collection cans to continue the
drive for this scholarship fund will
be at all bond and stamp sales booths
today. The first week's collections
exceeded the committee goal by
$31.80. Splendid records of certain
houses in contributng to this fund,
raised to help in-the-service Stan
ford men to finish a quarter's work
after the war, is entirely due to
group members who had the house
gifts organized when Rally Com
collectors appeared. Some groups
have not yet been reported, accord
