WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (U.R) —
Price Chief Leon Henderson, com
pleting major details of the tire con
servation program, today limited the
nation's. 27.000,000. passenger, ve
hicles to five tires apicce and set
Nov. J) as registration day for nation
wide gasoline rationing outside the
already rationed Eastern area.
Effective Nov. 22 every vehicle
will be under gasoline rationing,
every car will be subpject to per
iodic tire inspection and every mo
torist must come within the five
tire limit.
Violation of any of these regula
tions —or the 35-mile-an-hour na
tional speed limit—will mean less
gasoline for the violator or, perhaps,
none at all.
All motorists will be entitled to
apply to their local boards for re
caps, but whether they get them or
not depends on how they use their
cars and the status of the rubber
supply.
When motorists outside the East
ern zone start registering Nov. J)
they also will be required to file tire
inspection certificates and list the
serial numbers of all the tires they
own. If more than five are listed for
any one car, the motorists will be
denied gasoline rationing books until
they have sold the excess to the fed
eral government.
The Nov. 9 registration will be
for basic "A" coupon books which
provide for 16 gallons of gasoline a
month—enough to drive an average
of 2880 miles a year. Motorists may
apply for supplemental rations then
if they wish, but extra gasoline is
provided only for essential driving.
Every motorist—no matter how he
uses his car—is entitled to an "A"
book.
