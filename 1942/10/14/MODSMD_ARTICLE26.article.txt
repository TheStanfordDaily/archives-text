### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (U.R)—
Backcd by a "go" signal from Pres
ident Roosevelt and Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson, Congress to
night cleared the way for swift ac
tion on legislation to draft 18 and 19-
year-old youths, with prospects the
House will vote on the issue before
the week-end.
Plans to push a bill through t lie
lower chamber "no later than Sat
urday night" were announced by
Speaker Sam Rayburn only a few
minutes after Stimson told the legis
lators that "never before in its his
tory" has the nation so needed the
exceptional fighting qualities found
only in 'teen-age soldiers.
The House committee will meet
9 a.m. tomorrow and is expected
to report a bill no later than Thurs
day.
"The commander-in-chief and the
generals of the army have asked for
this legislation and I intend to pass
it without delay," Rayburn said.
May's bill would postpone induc
tion or any 18 or 19-year-old youth
during the last half of his final year
in high school. It would prohibit
the army from ordering any soldier
under the age of 20 to combat serv
ice unless he had been given at
least 12 months of military training.
May said this provision was his own
idea and had not been proposed by
the War Department.
