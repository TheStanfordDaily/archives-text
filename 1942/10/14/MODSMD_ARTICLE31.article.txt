That Stanford would be an ideal site for a western training school for
the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps was the enthusiastic opinion of Lts.
Mary E. McGlinn and Madelyn Miller when they spoke to women students
at the Women's Clubhouse yesterday afternoon.
Answering a suggestion made by Prof. Calvin Stone, the father-in-law of

a WAAC officer, the speakers agreed
that the Farm's prestige and facili
ties make it the highly desirable
answer to a growing need for a west
ern training center.
Lt. McGlinn. San Francisco repre
sentative, spoke first, describing the
need for an army auxiliary and giv
ing the history of the corps. Re
viewing the President's statement of
the possibility of a draft of woman
labor, she declared that the WAAC
needs thousands of women to meet
the need for its services.
TAKE MEN'S JOBS
"Every WAAC l'eleases one boy
who is doing such work as tele
phoning, typing, or driving command
cars, for combat duty. As Colonel
Hobby described the WAACS, we
have 'a debt to democracy and a
date with destiny'."
To join the corps, women must be
citizens between the ages of 21 and
45, in good health and of excellent
moral character. When application
forms, obtained at 444 Market street
in San Francisco, are filled out, they
are sent to headquarters, which
calls women up as they are required.
After describing Fort Des Moines,
the training center, as "like a col
lege campus with a leisurely air it
loses when 2000 women start drill
ing." Lt. McGlinn outlined the
WAAC routine and training. "We're
proud of the simplicity of our life,
for we want to be treated like sol
diers."
BASIC TRAINING
All WAACS now have four weeks
of training as basic auxiliaries be
fore (hey are classified for special
ized work. They are then trained in
mess administration, driving, mili
tary sanitation, hygiene, chemical
warfare or any other of 20 subjects.
Their work during this period de
termines their rank upon gradua
tion.
"All types of endeavor are repre
sented in the WAACs," according to
Lt. Miller, who added that they even
drive jeeps and three-ton trucks.
And 95% of them ask for overseas
service.
"The WAVES have to kiss the boys
goodbye, but the WAACS go with
them," quoted Lt. Miller in con
clusion.
