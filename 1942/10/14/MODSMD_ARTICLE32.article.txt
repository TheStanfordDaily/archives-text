For the greatest benefit to practi
cal medicine in the last four years,
Dr. Thomas Addis, of the Stanford
School of Medicine, was awarded
the Cullen Prize by the Royal Col
lege of Physicians in Edinburgh.
Dr. Addis, an outstanding author
ity on kidney troubles, and his col
leagues have made extensive studies
of Blight's Disease. At present he is
perfecting a simple method of the
diagnosis and treatment of kidney
diseases in the doctor's office.
"The care of the kidney disease
belongs to the practicing physician,
not to the specialist," says Dr. Addis.
However, diagnosis now requires a
great deal of expensive equipment
usually accessible only to the spe
cialist, and at considerable cost pro
hibitive to the low-income patient.
Dr. Addis is devising a simpler and
less expensive method.
The degree of damage to the kid
neys is indicated by the rate at
which kidneys excrete a substance
called creatinine into the blood and
urine. Dr. Addis' method involves
standard solutions of color which
will be comparable to various de
grees of creatinine in solutions of
blood or urine, eliminating expen
sive, complicated equipment. This
also includes a simpler way of pre
paring the blood and urine solutions
for testing.
After ascertaining the extent of
the damage, the practicing physician
can prescribe a low-protein diet, as
this results in rest for the kidneys
while they are repairing.
