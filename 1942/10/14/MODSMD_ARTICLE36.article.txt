# Governali Set As Grid Great
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 13 (U.R)—Notes
from the football press-boxes:
You can tab Senior Paul Vincent
Governali as one of the country's
best collegiate passers. Pitching the
pigskin for Columbia last year, he
was responsible for 80 per cent of
his team's ground-gaining. This
season in three games—against Ft.
Monmouth, Maine and Brown—he
has completed 32 out of 50 passes
for an average of 04 per cent.
Clicked for 10 out of 22 against
Brown. Tossed 10 touchdown passes
in three games and against Ft. Mon
mouth, threw four scoring passes for
a Columbia record. His total aerial
yardage gained is 603 for an average
of 18.8 per completion.
The gridiron season has not yet
reached the halfway mark, but al
ready the country lists only 29 un
beaten, untied teams in the major
school class and four service squads.
However, the North Carolina Pre-
Flight eleven is unbeaten but tied
by the Georgia Pre-Flight squad.
AIRFIRM WORKER
John (Little Clipper) Smith, for
mer football coach, is working for
an aviation firm located in Hartford,
Conn. Princeton reports Charlie
Brown, Freshman center, as the
best find of the year and puts the
finger on Bob Sandbach as just as
good a tackier as his famous bro
ther, Ken, one of the best the game
ever had . . . Bill Dudley, former
All-America back from Virginia
and now a rookie with the Pitts
burgh Steelers, looks like the pro
player of the year . . . they're al
ready calling the Steelers—"Dudly
& Co."
UCLA PICKED
UCLA, only member of the Pa
cific Coast Conference that never
has played in the Rose Bowl, looks
like a good bet to land there after its
37-7 shellacking of Oregon State—
that is, if there is a Rose Bowl game
. . . Frank Malinowski, 17-year-old
end, is one of the few bright spots in
a disappointing Fordham team. In
the Purdue pame, a burley boiler
maker guard told him to go back
to the cradle but Frank Stuck
around long enough to catch a pass
for the winning touchdown . . . then
he caught the only pass Fordham
completed in the scoreless tie with
North Carolina.

a Columbia record. His total aerial
yardage gained is 603 for an average
of 18.8 per completion.
The gridiron season has not yet
reached the halfway mark, but al
ready the country lists only 29 un
beaten, untied teams in the major
school class and four service squads.
However, the North Carolina Pre-
Flight eleven is unbeaten but tied
by the Georgia Pre-Flight squad.
AIRFIRM WORKER
John (Little Clipper) Smith, for
mer football coach, is working for
an aviation firm located in Hartford,
Conn. Princeton reports Charlie
Brown, Freshman center, as the
best find of the year and puts the
finger on Bob Sandbach as just as
good a tackier as his famous bro
ther, Ken, one of the best the game
ever had . . . Bill Dudley, former
All-America back from Virginia
and now a rookie with the Pitts
burgh Steelers, looks like the pro
player of the year . . . they're al
ready calling the Steelers—"Dudly
& Co."
UCLA PICKED
UCLA, only member of the Pa
cific Coast Conference that never
has played in the Rose Bowl, looks
like a good bet to land there after its
37-7 shellacking of Oregon State—
that is, if there is a Rose Bowl game
. . . Frank Malinowski, 17-year-old
end, is one of the few bright spots in
a disappointing Fordham team. In
the Purdue pame, a burley boiler
maker guard told him to go back
to the cradle but Frank Stuck
around long enough to catch a pass
for the winning touchdown . . . then
he caught the only pass Fordham
completed in the scoreless tie with
North Carolina.
NEW YORK, Oct. 13 (U.R)—Notes
from the football press-boxes:
You can tab Senior Paul Vincent
Governali as one of the country's
best collegiate passers. Pitching the
pigskin for Columbia last year, he
was responsible for 80 per cent of
his team's ground-gaining. This
season in three games—against Ft.
Monmouth, Maine and Brown—he
has completed 32 out of 50 passes
for an average of 04 per cent.
Clicked for 10 out of 22 against
Brown. Tossed 10 touchdown passes
in three games and against Ft. Mon
mouth, threw four scoring passes for
a Columbia record. His total aerial
yardage gained is 603 for an average
of 18.8 per completion.
