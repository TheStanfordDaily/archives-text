LEAGUE ANALYSIS
Analyzing the newly announced J
set-up, it is evident that league I
sponsors intend to spread the strong I
teams throughout the program, ;
rather than concentrating them in
one league as a method of killing
the giants among themselves.
Th us, Phi Psi roosts in League 2, j
Zeta Psi in League 3, and the Dekes !
in League 5. Exception to the new
rule is found in League 4, where '
one of the toughest fights is certain
to develop.
Firehouse, the defending cham- !
pion, Kappa Sigma, the runner-up j
(without much hope of repetition, |
it's true) and the boys on top of the
hill, Delta Tau and Sigma Nu, are I
gathered in one cosy grouping.
In League G, the Alpha Delts and
Biz School should threaten almost
at once, while in League 1 El Toro
and Branner are pre-season favor
ites.
TWO VIEWS
There are two views of this sched- j
ule matter. Oneh olds that the
strong teams should have to play j
each other, allowing more of the
smaller squads to reach playoff
honors. The other forgets such sen- j
timent and follows the regular j
tournament rules which seed the '
supposed best so that the playoffs I
will find really high-calibre mate
rial clashing for the crown.
Underlying any opinion on the j
subject is this fact: No one yet can
say which teams will come out on
top, and predicting in such a race as j
Stanford's murals is even more pre- j
carious than in regular grid fore- j
casting.
But even with qualifications, it
appears that the brethren at Phi Psi.
Zeta Psi, and Deke at least can
breathe far easier tonight since they
won't have to worry about each
other until laterâ€”and maybe never.
