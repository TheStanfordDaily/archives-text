HEAVYWEIGHT CHAMP Joe Louis, quoted a few days ago as having
retired from the ring for good, is shown here in his traditional after
the-fight pose. Joe's manager. Jack Roxborough, claimed that Joe
was misquoted, and that he only meant that he was through with box
ing until after the war. Nevertheless Roxborough admitted that the
champion "may retire" when the war is over, but added he hoped the
fighter would not be too old for the ring after he leaves the army.
