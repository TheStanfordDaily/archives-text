### BOB SONTAG 
First it was Look, now it's Esquire.
When Stanford's basketball team, under the tutelage of Everett Dean,
hit the hall of fame by drubbing a scrappy Dartmouth squad last spring to
win the National Collegiate Athletic Association championship at Kansas

City, a lot of editors and writers
were around and they saw a brand
of basketball the likes of which
never came to the Mid-West before.
Well. Look magazine sent its Coast
representative to see Dean a week
ago. The result was a day of picture
taking and soon to come is a spread
of Redskins on Look's pages.
If that wasn't enough, Esquire's
November issue, soon to be on
stands, will carry an article by Bob
Cook all about Dean and his NCAA
champions.
Cook is publicity director at the
University of Indiana and a life-long
friend of Dean's. At his suggestion,
Jack Gunther, sports editor of Look
and United Press, ordered Look's
Coast man to do an article for the
picture magazine. Now Cook has
written a yarn about Dean's methods
exclusively for Esquire.

DACK TO WORK:
The gridders return today.
They start working out this
afternoon.
They need encouragement.

They could he worse.
If von don't have a class, drop down to the station and meet your foot
hall team. The train might not he on lime, so call Southern Pacific, P.A.
(>lO5. If on time, the choo-choo pulls in at 11:30. With soldier priorities,
et al, it will probably be late.
