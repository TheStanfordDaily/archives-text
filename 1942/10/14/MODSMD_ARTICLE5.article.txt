# Farm Will Go Carless Today
## 
### 
Today is earless Wednesday on
the Farm as the Conservation Coun
cil starts its co-operative driving
effort for the year. Everyone is
urged to leave his car at home to
day and sign -up sheets have been
posted in the dormitories so people
can secure rides, by doubling up in
cars, to and from class.
Members of the smaller living
groups are asked to co-operate in
the sharing of cars and all persons
living off campus are also urged to
share rides. Letters have been sent
to all faculty members and students
living off campus. Those persons
having cars are asked to get in
touch with anyone living in the
same vicinity that does not have a
car.
Students are discouraged from
driving their cars to and from the
football games in the city. Buses and
trains will not be run on special
schedules so students should pur
chase their tickets early to assure
seats on the trains.
The Conservation Committee
urges everyone to co-operate in
the movement.
