That very line journalistic enterprise, The Daily Californian, should
be proud of its Injunuity.
According to The Californian, Clark Shaughnessy told the yell leaders
at Maryland to "consult California leaders to insure proper success. In so
doing Mr. Shaughnessy subtly denoted his preference of the Bear rooting
section over Stanford's."
We hope they read this up at Berkeley, because it's difficult to remain
cool under such implied grut.
As a matter of strict fact Doc Colvear only recently received a letter
from said Maryland yell leader, asking him about said card stunts. So
apparently Mr. Shaughnessy's quote was read into by some unknowing |
reporter on The Daily Californian.
