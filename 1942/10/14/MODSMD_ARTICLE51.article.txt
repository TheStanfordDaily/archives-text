## Farm Soccer Men To Tangle With British Naval Teams 
### 
Starting the season with a double-header, Stanford's championship
soccer team will meet two teams of British sailors tomorrow afternoon
at 4 on the University playing field.
The games will be played according to international rules which forbid
substituting players. This should be very valuable for the Cardinal squad

members, as there is nothing like
one hour of steady competition
without rest to put a team into con
dition. The players have had only
a few practice sessions this seaSfin,
and the games should either "kill 1
them or make them."
After the contests, Stanford will
extend its hospitality to the Royal
Navy men with the sailors being
invited up to the fraternity houses
for dinner and entertainment.
OFFICER TO REFEREE
The first game beginning at 4 will
be refereed by a Royal Navy officer.
To even things up the second game
starting at 5 will be refereed by
a Stanford official.
Stanford will present an imposing
forward wall against the Navy men.
Main scoring threats are shifty Rene
Paz at inside left and Louis Chang
at center forward. The other three
forwards are John Gertridge, in
side right, and Bob Barker and,
Dave Bills at the wings.
LETTERMEN RETURN
Three experienced halfbacks, all
returning lettermen, are at the hall's.
George Koffer will direct the team
from center half and Russ Bryan
and Joe Welsh will be at left half
and right half respectively.
The two fulls, Frank Spenser and
Hank Peters, are both lettermen.
The first team is rounded out by
Keith Pinion.
The lineup for the second game

Crary at forwards; Tom Olliger,
