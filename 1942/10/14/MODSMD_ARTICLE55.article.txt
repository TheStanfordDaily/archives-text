# Where We Stand
## 
### 
IN his fireside chat to the nation Monday
night, President Roosevelt answered the
questions most of us have been asking since
the war began. He clearly defined our place
in the war—the role each individual is expected
to play in our fight for freedom.
Now we know all of us—from the freshman
to the senior—are in the front lines. The 18-19-
year-old draft and compulsory manpower pro
gram will definitely assign every student a
place in the total war effort.
This does not mean that all men students
v/ho have passed their eighteenth birthday will
be drafted at once. It means that some com
prehensive plan for training students in college
will probably be enacted soon. It also means
that every physically fit male must prepare
himself for combat duty. The President stressed
the fact that the most efficient fighting forces
average 23 years in age. We will make up the
backbone, the officers' corps, of these combat
forces.
Compulsory manpower planning will assign
places to those men physically unfit for combat
fighting. It will also give the women a definite
and important place in the war. No student will
be exempt from some type of service.
This means that for the first time all of us
know where we are going in this war. Each
student now should be able to plan for a defi
nite part of the total war effort. The compre
hensive physical fitness tests will enable each
student to determine whether he is fitted for
combat duty. If he is, then he should imme
diately begin training for leadership in the
armed services along the lines Chancellor Wil
bur outlined in his welcoming address at the
beginning of this quarter.
Special skills and training such as physics, en
gineering, chemistry and medicine are urgently
needed. Men already studying in these fields
must intensify their training. Men physically
unfit for combat duty should begin training in
essential non-combatant fields like these.
The women must also find their place. The
WAACS and WAVES urgently need college
graduates for officer training. Stanford girls
with no essential skills who graduate this year
can aid the war effort by enrolling in these
women's Army and Navy forces.
The President has done his job. He has told
us what the nation expects of each of us. His
address furnishes a clear-cut outline which both
University officials and student government can
use to help Stanford students prepare for their
place in this all-out war.
Immediate and adequate preparation is vital.
There should be no delay on the part of the
University and student administrations in for
mulating a clear-cut program which will facili
tate this preparation.—Charlie Allen
