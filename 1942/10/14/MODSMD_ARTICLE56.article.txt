# It's Not Patriotic
## 
### 
TODAY is the second Stamp Day of the Au
tumn Quarter, and today, as last week, the
goal has been set at $1500 for the entire campus.
1 his amounts to about 50 cents per person which
in turn amounts to 5 Saturday Evening Posts
or 10 vanilla ice cream cones.
Last week we fell $800 short of the goal.
Stamp Day didn't get much publicity then and
maybe for that reason it failed. We have been
in the war for 10 months now and we shouldn't
have to be hit each Wednesday with a large
picture of a pretty girl buying a war stamp to
remind us to get our guarters ready.
We will go over the $1500 guota this week if
we remember: "It's not patriotic to buy War
Stamps; it's unpatriotic not to buy them." A1
