THE BEAM IN OUR OWN EYE
1 lie House of Representatives yesterday passed
a hill outlawing the poll tax as a qualification for
voters in a federal election. The details are given
elsewhere, but the reasons advanced in the House
and before the Senate committee are worthy of note.
Not a single allegation that the negro is inferior to
the white or that he is otherwise constitutionally
unfit to vote is reported!
In the House, the shout was "Unconstitutional!
and "States' Rights! Hattou Sumners. chairman of
the House Judiciary Committee, cited case and prec
edent in demonstration of the measure's illegality.
Before the Senate Judiciary Committee, holding
hearings on an identical bill, Their Excellencies, the
Governors of Alabama and South Carolina, could
say no more than that it was ill-timed and under
handed, and that it would promote I alliteratively >
"dissension, disunity, and discord."
It was indeed pleasant, after hearing the cam
paign speeches of Gene Talmadge, not to hear these
gentlemen thump the drum of racial prejudice.
Perhaps the truths of science and the hopes of de
mocracy are winning some Southern couverts.
\ he House's action, however, can serve as a warn
ing to the Confederate states that if they do not
themselves put their houses in order, it will he done
for them. They had best make their plans now to
improve the lot of both the negro and the "poor
white.' '1 he pool of ignorance, poverty, suffering,
and disease that is represented by the underprivi
leged of the South is a menace to the entire nation.
"Democracy cannot suffer fools."
