# THOUGHTS ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON
## 
### 
1 was listening to the radio last Saturday after
noon when for some strange reason I got to think
ing about Notre Dame hack fields.
It occurred to me that playing behind the line for
ihe Fighting Irish in the early thirties were four
men equally as good, if not better, than the famed
Four Horsemen. Flmer Layden. Harry Miller, Harry
Stuhldreher, and Jimmy Crowley.
This hack field was composed of Frank Carideo,
Marty Brill, Marchie Schwartz, and Jumpinjoe Sa
voldie.

Tune in. same time, same station, tomorrow for
another stanza in that true-to-life saga of cannery
life called "On the Old Assembly Line."
