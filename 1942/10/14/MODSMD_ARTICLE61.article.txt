The Editor, Sir:
Almost 30 years ago the greatest of all Stanford
rivalries, embodied in the old "Plug Ugly," was
abandoned at the Farm because of its rough char
acteristics. Fifteen years later administrative heads
decided that freshman-sophomore hazing was too
obnoxious for the I*arms polished gentlemen. It
looked as if the Stanford rough was destined to
move out of the picture forever.
Now for the last few years, new Stanford stu
dents have read the Frosh Bible and have learned
that they were to be treated with dignity and respect
at the Farm. Freshmen wandered about the campus
wearing cords and snubbing sophomores, and soon
the inevitable smoothie was accepted at Stanford.
But what happened? First, our Dean of Men
would rather have us drinking at bars and driving
on highways than privately imbibing safely at
home; our smoothies can no longer be smooth on
Friday night dates, or on evenings in the I nion—
and yet we are asked to co-operate bv keeping our
selves on campus and emphasizing on-campus ac
ti\ ities.
Do you. Mr. l.ditor. or the so well-informed
members of Bull Session think this sort of thing
is building campus spirit? Let's face it Stanford
is in a rut and we all know it. \\ illi our football
team and Kally Committee both out of commission
this year, something must be done. I agree that in
wartime we must sacrifice a l»»t »>f tilings, but fri
\olih is one thing and morale quite another.
