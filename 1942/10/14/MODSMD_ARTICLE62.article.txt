# 'Talk of the Town' Proves Humorous Entertainment
## 
### 
THE TALK OF THE TOWN, now playing at the Stanford Theater.
As a piece of cinematic art this may not be a great moving picture, but as
entertainment it is very commendable.
Jean Arthur gives an excellent characterization of Jean Arthur as the
heroine of the story, who is the object of the affections of Ronald Coleman,

a law professor and jurist, and Cary
Grant, a fugitive from justice and a I
champion of the downtrodden of I
whom he is one.
The plot hatches when, as Miss
Arthur is cleaning up a country
home preparatory to Mr. Colman's
occupancy, Mr. Grant, ducks in
while on the lam from the cops on a
trumped-up charge.
Grant won't leave and Coleman
moves in so eventually they meet.
Here begins the socially significant
part of the film. Coleman, the ideal
ist, and Grant, the realist, do not
see eye to eye on anything but chess.
The conflict in the film is whether
Coleman should endanger his
chances for becoming a Supreme
Court justice, by aiding Grant clear j
himself of the frame-up, and there- ;
by save his life.
Naturally, in the end, Coleman
becomes a realist and saves Grant,
who is now swinging to the ideal
istic side. Incidentally, Grant gets
the girl, and Coleman gets the job
on the bench.
Accompanying feature is "The
Spirit of Stanford," a Columbia re
lease starring Eiknarf Trebla, for
mer Farm footballer.â€”Thoreau.
