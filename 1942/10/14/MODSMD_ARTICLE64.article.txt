WASHINGTON, Oct. 13 (U.R) —
National Housing Administrator
John B. Blandford Jr. warned to
night that failure of the newly in
augurated voluntary program to
provide adequate quarters for war
workers will force the government
to resort to a "requisitioning, com
mandeering and billeting."
He said the decision was based on
widespread evidence that war pro
duction already has been adversely
affected through loss of trained
workers who could not find places
to live.
