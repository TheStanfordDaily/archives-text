# Chancellor Wilbur Flays 'Hell Week' As Detriment To Stanford War Effort
## Interfraternity Council Is Told To Forget Unnecessary Traditions And to Rise to the Crisis of War 
### BOB HANNAH 
Blasting "hell week" as detrimental to the war effort, Chancellor Ra;
Lyman Wilbur last night warned fraternity leaders to in no way harm an;
members of their organizations during prc-initiation period.
Speaking at the Fourth Annual Interfraternity Council Dinner, Chan
ccllor Wilbur emphasized that students are only in college because the;

will be of more use to the
alter college training, and he termed
anything that interferes with the
pursuit of studies, namely "hell
week," as "so much trash."
"You'll have hell from me," he
continued, "if you destroy one man
in hell week." Blame for students
"going minus" because of pre-ini
tiation hazing will rest squarely on
the fraternities, he added. The
Chancellor had previously cited new
regulations which place enlisted re
servists on active duty if they, do not
maintain a "C" average.
In what many listeners termed one
of his most bombastic and angry
talks, Chancellor Wilbur called on I
fraternity leaders to rise to the |
crisis of the war and forget unnec- j
essary traditions and deep-rooted j
convictions concerning "hell week."
"You're only boys, but you've got
to be men," he said.
Chancellor Wilbur also predicted
that future fraternity membership
will be lower as students will be
completing college education in less
than three years, and there will be
a drop in graduate enrollment.
DEAN OF MEN
Dean of Men John Bunn, speaking
previous to Chancellor Wilbur,
pointed out that fraternity planning
and thinking must be predicated for
war. Towards this purpose, all men,
fraternity, hall, and independent,
must join some reserve, carry a
normal number of study units, and
maintain at least a "C" average.
Dean Bunn outlined a three-point
substitute for hazing during the
pre-initiation period; points sent
him by interfraternity councils in
other universities.
I—Teaching pledge facts and data
about his university.
2—Teaching pledge facts and data
about the interfraternity organiza
tion in his university.
3—Teaching pledge facts and data
about his individual fraternity.
ADVOCATES BUDGET
A budget and inclusion of all spe
cial assessments in fraternity house
bills was also recommended by Dean
Bunn. These two measures would
probably make membership more
attractive to finance-minded rush
ees. "And most rushees are finance
minded," he added.
Lee Peake, interfraternity presi
dent, presented Bill Ross, president
of the House Managers, who men
tioned the scarcity of kitchen help,
and warned that fraternities should
expect to merge tables in the near
future, because of decreased mem
bership and decreased operating
costs.
RUSH RULES UNCHANGED
A1 Marshal, speaking for the j
Rushing Chairmen, declared that
rushing rules would remain the i
same as la t st. year, but that there is j
a possibility that individual (car)
rushing would be illegal after 10
p.m.
Rushing dates have tentatively j
been set for period between Jan. 6- !
23. This is considerably shorter than '
in previous years, and commences j
two days after the opening of Win- I
tcr Quarter, Jan. 4.
The dinner was held in the Gar
den Wing of the Old Union at 6:30 !
hist night.

ADVOCATES BUDGET
A budget and inclusion of all spe
cial assessments in fraternity house
bills was also recommended by Dean
Bunn. These two measures would
probably make membership more
attractive to finance-minded rush
ees. "And most rushees are finance
minded," he added.
Lee Peake, interfraternity presi
dent, presented Bill Ross, president
of the House Managers, who men
tioned the scarcity of kitchen help,
and warned that fraternities should
expect to merge tables in the near
future, because of decreased mem
bership and decreased operating
costs.
RUSH RULES UNCHANGED
A1 Marshal, speaking for the j
Rushing Chairmen, declared that
rushing rules would remain the i
same as la t st. year, but that there is j
a possibility that individual (car)
rushing would be illegal after 10
p.m.
Rushing dates have tentatively j
been set for period between Jan. 6- !
23. This is considerably shorter than '
in previous years, and commences j
two days after the opening of Win- I
tcr Quarter, Jan. 4.
The dinner was held in the Gar
den Wing of the Old Union at 6:30 !

Blasting "hell week" as detrimental to the war effort, Chancellor Ra;
Lyman Wilbur last night warned fraternity leaders to in no way harm an;
members of their organizations during prc-initiation period.
Speaking at the Fourth Annual Interfraternity Council Dinner, Chan
ccllor Wilbur emphasized that students are only in college because the;

will be of more use to the
alter college training, and he termed
anything that interferes with the
pursuit of studies, namely "hell
week," as "so much trash."
"You'll have hell from me," he
continued, "if you destroy one man
in hell week." Blame for students
"going minus" because of pre-ini
tiation hazing will rest squarely on
the fraternities, he added. The
Chancellor had previously cited new
regulations which place enlisted re
servists on active duty if they, do not
maintain a "C" average.
In what many listeners termed one
of his most bombastic and angry
talks, Chancellor Wilbur called on I
fraternity leaders to rise to the |
crisis of the war and forget unnec- j
essary traditions and deep-rooted j
convictions concerning "hell week."
"You're only boys, but you've got
to be men," he said.
Chancellor Wilbur also predicted
that future fraternity membership
will be lower as students will be
completing college education in less
than three years, and there will be
a drop in graduate enrollment.
DEAN OF MEN
Dean of Men John Bunn, speaking
previous to Chancellor Wilbur,
pointed out that fraternity planning
and thinking must be predicated for
war. Towards this purpose, all men,
fraternity, hall, and independent,
must join some reserve, carry a
normal number of study units, and
maintain at least a "C" average.

substitute for hazing during the
pre-initiation period; points sent

other universities.
