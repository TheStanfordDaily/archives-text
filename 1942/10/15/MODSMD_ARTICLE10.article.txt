# Excom Kills Frosh Rally After 8 p.m.
## 
### 
Slicking to its policy of fewer
rallies, Excom last night again took
a definite stand and voted down the
proposed Freshman Rally which was
to run after 8 p.m. by a vote of 4-1.
Under the leadership of Bob
Knox, the idea of having a rally
only for the freshman men and
women in the Encina lobby after
tonight's dinner was hatched and
plans laid. It was brought before
Excom only for the formality of
approval.
When permission was denied, the
freshmen on the Rally Committee
came over to the meeting late to
again press their ideas.
"I hate to dampen their enthu
siasm, but with all their programs
for the coming week they will have
enough to do," said Bob Hammett,
graduate man on Excom.
BEST INTERESTS
"We must stick to one thing and
work for the best interests of the
group," Les Langnecker, vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., said.
Other ideas such as a Saturday
morning rally were proposed as an
alternative. "I would be glad to
open the stadium gates early for
the freshmen," Ben Miller, head of
the B.A.C. guards, stated.
"If the freshmen decide to have
the rally so that it will end before
8 p.m., it will not be in the hands
of Excom," stated Bill Moran, stu
dent manager.

committee heads for the coming

Slicking to its policy of fewer
rallies, Excom last night again took
a definite stand and voted down the
proposed Freshman Rally which was
to run after 8 p.m. by a vote of 4-1.
Under the leadership of Bob
Knox, the idea of having a rally
only for the freshman men and
women in the Encina lobby after
tonight's dinner was hatched and
plans laid. It was brought before
Excom only for the formality of
approval.
When permission was denied, the
freshmen on the Rally Committee
came over to the meeting late to
again press their ideas.
"I hate to dampen their enthu
siasm, but with all their programs
for the coming week they will have
enough to do," said Bob Hammett,
graduate man on Excom.
BEST INTERESTS
"We must stick to one thing and
work for the best interests of the
group," Les Langnecker, vice-presi
dent of the A.S.S.U., said.
Other ideas such as a Saturday
morning rally were proposed as an
alternative. "I would be glad to
open the stadium gates early for
the freshmen," Ben Miller, head of
the B.A.C. guards, stated.
"If the freshmen decide to have
the rally so that it will end before
8 p.m., it will not be in the hands
of Excom," stated Bill Moran, stu
dent manager.
