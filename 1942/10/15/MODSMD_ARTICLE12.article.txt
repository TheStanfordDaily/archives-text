# Lack of Skits May Bring End To '42 Gaieties
## O'Neill Sets Monday As Script Deadline 
### 
'Ihe future of the Big Game Gaie
ties. a Stanford tradition since IX9B,
hangs in the balance as Director
Bob O'Neill makes one last appeal to
students at large to co-operate in
producing a show which has had the
reputation of being an all-student
undertaking.
Cause of the Gaieties' precarious
predicament is the fact Tuesday's
script deadline did not achieve the
expected results.
Hoping that the campus will rouse
itself from an appalling apathy,
O'Neill, in a final attempt to keep
the Gaieties rolling and insure the
future of a show which has been
produced yearly two seasons after
the Big Game was initiated, extend
ed the script deadline to next Mon
day at noon.
MAYBE NO SHOW
"I must emphasize the fact that
unless there is sufficient response to
this appeal, there may be no Gaie
ties this year," O'Neill added.
Lamenting the fact that the Gaie
ties is ceasing to be a student affair
and has more and more tended to
become a closed show as the cam
pus assumes the feeling that the
Gaieties rolls along of its own
weight, this year's director feels
that the success or failure of this
show determines the continuation
or finis of future Gaieties.
THE NEED: SKITS
Musically, O'Neill and staff feel
the show has all it needs, but more
strongly they feel that skits are the
backbone of the Gaieties, and at
present the show is a non-verti
brate.
Skits need not be long, O'Neill
emphasized. A single comic theme
properly developed into dialogue is
what the staff is calling for—and
hopes to get before the postponed
deadline.
Firmly believing that the Gaie
ties fill a definite need and feeling
that its success should not be jeo
pardized by an apparent lack of stu
dent interest* O'Neill said that the
duties of students during war
should not be so pressing that they
forget how to laugh.

Hoping that the campus will rouse
itself from an appalling apathy,
O'Neill, in a final attempt to keep
the Gaieties rolling and insure the
future of a show which has been
produced yearly two seasons after
the Big Game was initiated, extend
ed the script deadline to next Mon
day at noon.
MAYBE NO SHOW
"I must emphasize the fact that
unless there is sufficient response to
this appeal, there may be no Gaie
ties this year," O'Neill added.
Lamenting the fact that the Gaie
ties is ceasing to be a student affair
and has more and more tended to
become a closed show as the cam
pus assumes the feeling that the
Gaieties rolls along of its own
weight, this year's director feels
that the success or failure of this
show determines the continuation
or finis of future Gaieties.
THE NEED: SKITS
Musically, O'Neill and staff feel
the show has all it needs, but more
strongly they feel that skits are the
backbone of the Gaieties, and at
present the show is a non-verti
brate.
Skits need not be long, O'Neill
emphasized. A single comic theme
properly developed into dialogue is
what the staff is calling for—and
hopes to get before the postponed
deadline.
Firmly believing that the Gaie
ties fill a definite need and feeling
that its success should not be jeo
pardized by an apparent lack of stu
dent interest* O'Neill said that the
duties of students during war
should not be so pressing that they
forget how to laugh.
'Ihe future of the Big Game Gaie
ties. a Stanford tradition since IX9B,
hangs in the balance as Director
Bob O'Neill makes one last appeal to
students at large to co-operate in
producing a show which has had the
reputation of being an all-student
undertaking.
Cause of the Gaieties' precarious
predicament is the fact Tuesday's
script deadline did not achieve the
expected results.
