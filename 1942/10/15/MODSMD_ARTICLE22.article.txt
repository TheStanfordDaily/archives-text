SEATTLE. Oct. 14 (U.R)—A run
away army barrage balloon ram
paged mischieviously today, drag
ging 1000 feet of cable over build
ings in the downtown district, snap
ping power and telephone wires,
touching off fires and making hun
dreds of Seattleites late for work.
The errant gas-bag was first
sighted on its way to town by sur
prised highway motorists after it
snapped its moorings—located by
army authorities as "somewhere in
the Pacific Northwest."
