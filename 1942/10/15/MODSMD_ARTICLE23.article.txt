# New Large-Scale Jap Invasion Of Solomons Bolstered as Navy Reveals Sudden Turn for Worse
## Enemy Warships Shell Airfield, Shore Positions on Guadalcanal As Transports Pour in Troops 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (U.R)—A suuden turn for the worse in (lie
Solomon Islands was revealed tonight by the Navy Department which said
Japanese warships bombarded the American-held air field and shore in
stallations on Guadalcanal and landed more reinforcements on that key
— ■ a. island.

Enemy troops were landed this
morning on the north coast of Guad
alcanal to the westward of positions
held by U.S. Marines, a Navy com
munique said. They came from
transports covered by naval units,
suggesting that the Japs were suc
ceeding in forcing a large-scale in
vasion.
Ominously or not, there was no
mention of resistance by American
air or sea forces, nor was there any
mention of the damage to the vital
airfield there.
A DAY LATER
This startling turn in the Battle
of the Solomons came 24 hours after
the Navy revealed an American task
force had smashed a similar invasion
attempt Sunday night during a
fierce 30-minute battle that cost the:
enemy one heavy cruiser, four de
stroyers and one transport sunk.
Bombardment of the airfield and
shore installations at Guadalcanal
was carried out Monday night.
The landings were effected early
this morning.
JAP STRATEGY
The pattern of the Jap action sug
gested the objective first was to
knock out or cripple American
aerial facilities and then move in
transports for large-scale landings.
The fact that landings were made
from transports indicated they were
of major proportions.
The Guadalcanal airfield is the
heart of the American defense sys
tem in the Solomons. Without it,
the American position there would
be virtually untenable.
There seemed little doubt thai a
showdown battle was near.

JAP STRATEGY
The pattern of the Jap action sug
gested the objective first was to
knock out or cripple American
aerial facilities and then move in
transports for large-scale landings.
The fact that landings were made
from transports indicated they were
of major proportions.
The Guadalcanal airfield is the
heart of the American defense sys
tem in the Solomons. Without it,
the American position there would
be virtually untenable.
There seemed little doubt thai a
showdown battle was near.
