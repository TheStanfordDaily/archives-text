ni( u' in the bicycle situation. People

dantM rous to have these bicycles
clutl'jiing up the arcades, hallways,
and vv Iks in the Quad area, accord

Hacks are provided for cyclists
and it is hoped that use will be made
of them. They are located at the
Library, Art Gallery. Education
Buildin./. the entrance to Memorial
Court, the front of Jordan Hall,
Physics Building, and by the Law
Sieu.s. Should these racks be full

there is ample parking room near
them. If bikes are not kept off the
Quad area voluntarily, they will be
impounded.
The vehicle code provides that bi
cycles must be lighted when in use
after dark. Cyclists are urged to
provide their bikes with lights of
some sort and a reflector in the rear.
This aids the motorist and pedes

Davis issued another warning con
cerning the practice of riding on
running boards. It is appreciated
that students are sharing their cars,
he said, but they must not be loaded
to impair the safe operation of the
vehicle. This is not a local proviso,
but is part of the Vehicle Code.
