## 
### MARTY POWELL 
As the Y.W.C.A. membership drive goes into its iiual stretch, incom
plete reports show that the organization is well on the way toward its
goal of 'live hundred members for the littieth year."
Stressing the point that they are offering "plenty" for the membership
dollar, the club has offered an itemized statement to prospective members.

Each dollar is divided between
yarn for afghans for hospitalized
service men, membership in the
World and National Y.W.C.A., social
activities, office and "Y" rooms'
maintenance, social service projects,
a page in the Quad, the Yost Schol
arship Fund, Stanford Convalescent
Home Fund, aid to students in Chi
na and Europe, and student confer
ences.
CHOOSE ACTIVITIES
The "Y" has always carried out a
plan whereby members may choose
their activities according to their
interests. To put this into effect the
club offers each year a varied selec
tion of subjects for discussion and
activity groups from which the
members may choose.
Freshman members may get the
low-down on campus activities, see
points of interest in the vicinity,
and participate in special discussions
of the day, by joining the* Freshman
Club. Kathleen Guthrie will be
chairman of the group, and Beverly
Adams has been elected freshman
president.
Social service is being offered for
members interested in that work as
a career or avocation. Betsy Ann
Wilson, chairman, has tours to so
cial agencies in San Jose and San
Francisco planned for the group.
OTHER COURSES
Marriage and the Home, proven
to be one of the "Y's" most popular
groups, is being offered again this
Winter Quarter, and will feature six
discussions led by authoritative
speakers.
Industrious individuals may learn
mimeographing, filing and letter
writing through Office Practice,
while in contrast an afternoon of
relaxation with fine music is offered
by the Music Appreciation group.
With the focus on current events,
"Y" members will participate in
World Affairs Discussions. For this
an impressive array of guest speak
ers is being lined up.
Co-operating with the govern
ment relocation program, the Y.W.-
C.A. during the past quarter has
been sending the Daily and Chapar
