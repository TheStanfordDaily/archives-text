# Fraternity Initiates To Help Scrap Drive
## 
### 
Fraternity initiates will be on
call Saturday morning from 8 to
1 to help Stanford and Paly resi
dents carry down heavy scrap, the
War Board announced yesterday.
(If reside rtts will call the War
Board in the next few days, it will
see that a boy is sent and the scrap
collected. Since the National Scrap
Drive ends Oct, 1!), the Board
urges residents to donate as much
scrap as possible now.
