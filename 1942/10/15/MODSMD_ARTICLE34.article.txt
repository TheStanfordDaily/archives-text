### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 14 (U.R)â€”The
House yesterday overrode deter
mined southern opposition and ap
proved a bill outlawing poll taxes as
a pre-requisite to voting in federal
elections.
The vote climaxed an uproarious
session in which tempers snapped
and some Northerners joined South
erners in denouncing the measure
as an invasion of state's rights and
therefore unconstitutional.
The southern poll tax delegation
in the Senate, where the bill now
goes, has promised to filibuster it to
death if they can't kill it in the
judiciary committee. The committee
already is debating a bill by Sen.
Claude Pepper (D., Fla.), but
neither measure is expected to see
the light of day.
