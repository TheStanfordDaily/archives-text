QUARTERS, Australia, Oct. 15
(UP). — Veteran Australian jungle
troops have reached the north slopes
of the Owen Stanley Mountains in
New Guinea and, after a new ad
vance of almost five miles, are en
gaging the Japanese at the ap
proaches to Templeton's Crossing,
Allied headquarters announced to
day.
The fighting is centering on the
north side of the strategic mile
high gap leading across the moun
tains and it represented a gain of
almost five miles from the Myola
area, the last reported position of
the Australians on the south side
of the mountains.
The Australians previously had
pierced or outflanked Japanese
forces along two trails in the summit
area between Myola and Temple
ton's Crossing. Once they take the
latter position they probably will
begin a downhill drive some 13
miles to Kokoda, Japanese base
about halfway across 120-mile-wide
eastern New Guinea between Port
Moresby and the Japanese beach
head of Buna on the island's north
coast.
