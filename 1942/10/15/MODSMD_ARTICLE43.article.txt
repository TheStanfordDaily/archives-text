# Bruised Farm Team Plans Pass Defense
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Stanford's battered and bruised football squad detrained at 12:30 p.m.
yesterday and at 4 p.m. held an extensive two-hour pass defense diill.
Most «f the backs and ends participated in the drill against passes from
a single wing formation. The Indians demonstrated in the drill thai their
greatest weakness —lack of adequate pass defense—still exists.

Passers Ray Hammett, Bob An- <
drews, and Bob Rodgers found their
receivers down the field with amaz
ing regularity, although the defend
baeks attempted to knock down the
tosses.
It was impossible to single out
individual backs for criticism, be
cause all the backfield units failed
to break up the passing plays. Ev
ery unit displayed a lack of co
operation and a surprising unfamil
iarity with pass defense assignments.
Most of the backfield men on de
fense displayed a tendency to "play''
their men too closely, thereby per
mitting pass receivers to dodge and
swerve behind them. Passes com
pleted to these men were touch
downs.
SHIFTS NEEDED
Coach Marchie Schwartz is work
ing the Indians hard on pass de
fense, but he may he forced to shift
the backs around before he can find
an effective pass defense combina
tion. He may have to resort to per
fecting a separate backfield unit for
defense, because most of the first
string backs don't seem to be able
to master the technique of pass de
fense.
Tragedy of the situation is that
the Stanford line is playing the best
football turned in by an Indian line
in many years. Not one of the seven
touchdowns scored against the In
dians in three games has been regis
tered on the ground—all of them
have been scored on passes,
LINEMEN PRAISED
Observers at the Notre Dame-
Stanford game last Saturday said
the Indians' line play was excellent,
and one sports writer remarked that
Stanford had the best line in the
country. The more experienced line
men have been trying to help the
backs whenever they could, but
they may lose their fight and bog
down if the pass defense doesn't
improve.
On the basis of yesterday's drill,
the Indians are probably due for a
lot more work on pass defense this
week in preparation for the Idaho
game.
The squad is in poor shape, most
of the players sporting minor ail
ments such as black eyes and char
ley horses from the Notre Dame
game. Mark Caffall, reserve quar
terback, has his leg in a cast be
cause of an infection and may be
through for the season; Ed Stamm,
varsity tackle, is favoring a badly
bruised hip, but should see action
Saturday; and Ed McCain's bad foot
will probably keep him out for the
rest of the season.
Little Bobby Andrews, who was
shelved by a mysterious blood clot
in his leg before the season opened,
was back in harness yesterday and
looked very good. If he can master
the plays soon, he may be what the
Indians need at quarterback.
