# Phi Psis Meet Medical School In Grid Opener
## 
### 
Phi Psi meets Medical School, and
the soldiers from Page Mill Road
play Branner in the outstanding
games of Friday afternoon's open
ing intramural football program.
A last-minute addition to Director
Harry Wolter's list, the Army team
has an excellent record in mural
play on the Farm this summer, win
ning their baseball league title.
They were strong favorites for the
all-school crown until marching or
ders moved them off the day of the
finals.
The Phi Psi's with Howie Dall
mar at end are considered one of
the stronger house squads, but the
Medical School should be about
the toughest competition in their
league. An upset now is more of a
possibility than later in the season.
ENCINA LAX?
With the referee situation cleared
up, one black mark remains against
the record of student support for
the 1942 program. Encina, former
stronghold of mural ball and pro
ducer of much all-intramural mate
rial, has produced only two teams,
according to Wolter's sign-up lists.
"We have plenty of room for them
to come in," Wolter said last night.
He will contact the Encina spon
sors .sometime before Friday to dis
cuss the situation. Possibly the
fault lies in a mistaken idea of who
is to sign up for the different corri
dors. Encina should be able to raise
ten teams.
VOLLEYBALL, HORSESHOES
Wolter has completed tentative
plans to open the volleyball and
I horseshoe leagues early next week.
Managers must be signed up by
Monday. Already 24 horseshoe and
36 volleyball teams are listed, indi
cating that these sports will at
-Iract at least 250 Stanford men.
On the tennis roster eight teams
! have been byed through the first
round. Theta Delta Chi, Beta,
| S.A.E., A.T.0., Chi Psi, Phi Kappa
! Sigma, Delta Upsilon, and Kappa
j Sigma received the waivers. The 16
[ other teams entered must play their
i first matches by October 31.
