GEN. MacARTHUR'S HEAD
QUARTERS, Australia, Wednesay,
Oct. 14 (U.R)â€”Sgt. Meyer Levin of
Brooklyn, N.Y., formerly bombardier
for Colin Kelly, was awarded a sil
ver star today for bracketing a
15,000-ton Japanese transport with
eight 500-pound bombs during the
Battle of the Coral Sea.
The flying fortress on which he
was bombardier subsequently ran
out of fuel and the crew took to
parachutes, the citation said.
Maj. Gen. George C. Kenney pre
sented silver stars to Levin and 21
other American airmen.
