# On the Quad
## 
### 
OUR fellow journalists who occupy the bro
ken-down building down Lomita Drive
from The Daily are at it again. In other words
the Quad is taking pictures. Girls have quit
school, men have cursed because their pictures
didn't turn out "just right" in the past.
But each year the Quad continues to invite the
campus to its den for individual sittings. Some
times it asks organizations to gather at Memo
rial Hall, the Education Building, or at cactus
plant number two in that well-known Farm
garden spot. In fact the Quad does such a good
job of getting some of the campus organizations
together that these groups decide to have a get
acquainted meeting on the spot and then dis
band until Quad-picture-taking time the next
year.
Then some students spend most of Winter
and Spring Quarters parading up and down the
Quad or drinking cokes in the Cellar waiting
to jump in front of a camera so that they can
see themselves in the candid section or in the
prominent students on campus pages.
Professors speak to Quad people so that they
can see themselves in the faculty section under
the heading, "The student's friend."
But who doesn't like to see his picture in the
Quad? It is a book which will last forever—a
permanent record of a school year, something
to look over in future years.
Still this natural ego sometimes takes a lot
of stimulation before it is brought out. The
Quad has to beg each group to be on time until
the editor's ears turn black from sticking them
into the phone for hours at a time.
To the fraternities, sororities, and other or
ganizations, when it's your turn to have pic
tures taken, show up on time 100 per cent. It
makes for a better looking book, and it doesn't
do your group any harm to have a full picture.
Read the Quad picture schedule each day in
The Daily and you won't go wrong.
To the B.A.C. we extend thanks for keep
ing the booth open {or students to buy tickets
for the U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cal games. It's
a pretty long walk from Lagunita and Roble
to the 8.A.C., and this extra day gave many
of the girls who wouldn't have walked over
to get tickets one last chance.

OUR fellow journalists who occupy the bro
ken-down building down Lomita Drive
from The Daily are at it again. In other words
the Quad is taking pictures. Girls have quit
school, men have cursed because their pictures
didn't turn out "just right" in the past.
But each year the Quad continues to invite the
campus to its den for individual sittings. Some
times it asks organizations to gather at Memo
rial Hall, the Education Building, or at cactus
plant number two in that well-known Farm
garden spot. In fact the Quad does such a good
job of getting some of the campus organizations
together that these groups decide to have a get
acquainted meeting on the spot and then dis
band until Quad-picture-taking time the next
year.
Then some students spend most of Winter
and Spring Quarters parading up and down the
Quad or drinking cokes in the Cellar waiting
to jump in front of a camera so that they can
see themselves in the candid section or in the
prominent students on campus pages.
Professors speak to Quad people so that they
can see themselves in the faculty section under
the heading, "The student's friend."
But who doesn't like to see his picture in the
Quad? It is a book which will last forever—a
permanent record of a school year, something
to look over in future years.
Still this natural ego sometimes takes a lot
of stimulation before it is brought out. The
Quad has to beg each group to be on time until
the editor's ears turn black from sticking them
into the phone for hours at a time.
To the fraternities, sororities, and other or
ganizations, when it's your turn to have pic
tures taken, show up on time 100 per cent. It
makes for a better looking book, and it doesn't
do your group any harm to have a full picture.

The Daily and you won't go wrong.
To the B.A.C. we extend thanks for keep
ing the booth open {or students to buy tickets
for the U.S.C., U.C.L.A., and Cal games. It's
a pretty long walk from Lagunita and Roble
to the 8.A.C., and this extra day gave many
of the girls who wouldn't have walked over
to get tickets one last chance.
