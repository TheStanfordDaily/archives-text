WHILE the- Dimes for Diplomas drive hit a
new high Monday night, there are still a
few wrinkles which should be ironed out be
fore the campaign can be called a complete suc
ccss. Several houses were reported as "non
contributors. ' Actually this statement was true,
but after a careful check, it was discovered that
one of the houses was not given a collection
box.
It is the job of Rally Committee to see that
these items are taken care of. Maybe the house
in guestion misplaced the collection box; never
theless the committee should have made an
effort to get a check just before collection time
with the house's Dimes chairman.
Getting students to give money for this effort
is much more difficult than the selling of War
Stamps, for these little red and green govern
ment stamps are practically self-selling. The
publicity work carried on thus far by Rally
Committee for the Dimes campaign has been
very effective, and it should continue.
So, to Ted Barr, chairman of the drive, we
offer congratulations for Monday night's col
lection and hope that the Dimes total will con
tinue to swell.
