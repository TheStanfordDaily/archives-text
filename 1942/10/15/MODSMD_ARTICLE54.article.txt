DULCE ET DECORUM . . .
I here is a bill pending before the Congress au
thorizing a draft of 1 <>- and 19-year-olds. Ihe de
mands of the armed forces and lite support given
those demands by the President in his recent chat
have inspired the legislative branch l<> act now, the
wrath, if any, of their constituents to the contrary
notwithstanding. The new spirit in the Congress
has been matched, however, by a new spirit else
where in the nation; that is, among the lo- and 19-
year-olds themselves.
We have heard a lot about the wild younger
generation of the pre-depression years, and we
heard a lot about the lost generations that were cast
into '"the cold, cold world" of the deep depression.
I hose like myself, who are already 1-A, fall into
another generation; they were not really conscious
of the depression since they cannot remember the
non-depression years. They can, however, remem
ber well the years of peace. But the generation now
flocking lo the recruiting stations, as the wire serv
ice reports, being three or four years younger, fall
into still another group of American youthâ€”those
who cannot remember clearly the years before there
was widespread war.
Al atiy rate, they arc jamming recruiting stations
all over the country. We can presume that the
imminent draft is the argument that puis the fa
thers and mothers 1 signatures on the dotted line,
their consent being necessary. The moving spirit,
however, is that of the young men themselves, for
clearly a soldier of the United States is a man, what
ever his precise age. They could wait the months
that will doubtless be required lo put new ma
chinery in operation, although there are some 19-
year-olds who already have their questionnaires.
Maybe they would have time lo start college and
enter a reserve unit; (jr. at any rate, they would
have a little more lime down on ihe farm, or in
their favorite creamery, or at time-and-a-half-for
overtime in their local defense plant. Well, they
aren't waiting!
