Death is something that young people usually
don't run into very much and, therefore, don't give
much thought to. Or at least we don't give much
thought to it as a reality which actually means
something in our lives. We all figure that we have
a long way to go and death seems to be only an
abstraction which hits elderly folk.
The only things is that today it isn't an abstrac
tion because we happen to be involved in a war
which will probably mean death for a lot of the
young men who are on this campus right now
(maybe even for one of my four readers).
oli may wonder what brought this all on. Well,
a friend of mine just mentioned yesterday afternoon
that one of our mutual friends was killed a couple
of days ago in an airplane crash. 1 looked it up
and there was a little item about it in The Daily
a day or two ago.
It was just a little squib, something to the effect
that James Brennan, 23, class of 12. had died when
a plane lie was taking lip went into a spin at 2(H)
feel. Ihe accident occurred at a field somewhere
in California where Brennan was an army in
structor.
I hadn I thought about '"The I log" (we used to
call Brennan ''The Hog I much since he had left
school at the end of winter quarter last year with
a degree in engineering, and so this little item sort
of struck home.
But the fact is that he is dead.
This is not unusual. It is to be expected, I sup
pose. But it arouses a peculiar feeling in me be
cause I just happened to know this good man. It
is not as if I had lost a brother or a best friend. But
it makes me mad. And it makes me mad, I think,
because 1 cannot afford to be mournful.
This is just a "little" thing, but I believe that
from it I am beginning to know win I feel like
such a fool when 1 walk down the streets of San
Francisco and see young men in uniform on all
sides of me.
U * U
Were all not dead, however, which reminds me
that something we can't forget in wartime is that
good, old cure-all for every ailment, humor.
Now I don't know what the deal is exactlv, but
it seems that there is some danger that the Farm's
Big (liinie Gaieties ma\ get killed at that greatest
little show on earth, Kxcom. The reason for this
is that practically no scripts for the Gaeities have
been turned in. How about it. Stanford men and
women, are you gonna let the Gaieties expire?

I hadn I thought about '"The I log" (we used to
call Brennan ''The Hog I much since he had left
school at the end of winter quarter last year with
a degree in engineering, and so this little item sort
of struck home.
But the fact is that he is dead.
This is not unusual. It is to be expected, I sup
pose. But it arouses a peculiar feeling in me be
cause I just happened to know this good man. It
is not as if I had lost a brother or a best friend. But
it makes me mad. And it makes me mad, I think,
because 1 cannot afford to be mournful.
This is just a "little" thing, but I believe that
from it I am beginning to know win I feel like
such a fool when 1 walk down the streets of San
Francisco and see young men in uniform on all
sides of me.

Were all not dead, however, which reminds me
that something we can't forget in wartime is that
good, old cure-all for every ailment, humor.
Now I don't know what the deal is exactlv, but
it seems that there is some danger that the Farm's
Big (liinie Gaieties ma\ get killed at that greatest
little show on earth, Kxcom. The reason for this
is that practically no scripts for the Gaeities have
been turned in. How about it. Stanford men and
women, are you gonna let the Gaieties expire?
Death is something that young people usually
don't run into very much and, therefore, don't give
much thought to. Or at least we don't give much
thought to it as a reality which actually means
something in our lives. We all figure that we have
a long way to go and death seems to be only an
abstraction which hits elderly folk.
The only things is that today it isn't an abstrac
tion because we happen to be involved in a war
which will probably mean death for a lot of the
young men who are on this campus right now
(maybe even for one of my four readers).
oli may wonder what brought this all on. Well,
a friend of mine just mentioned yesterday afternoon
that one of our mutual friends was killed a couple
of days ago in an airplane crash. 1 looked it up
and there was a little item about it in The Daily
a day or two ago.
It was just a little squib, something to the effect
that James Brennan, 23, class of 12. had died when
a plane lie was taking lip went into a spin at 2(H)
feel. Ihe accident occurred at a field somewhere
in California where Brennan was an army in
structor.
