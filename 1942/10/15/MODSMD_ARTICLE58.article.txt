# Paly Pet Shelter Grows Into $25,000 Enterprise
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ Daily Feature Editor 
From a few homemade kennels in a private back yard to a $25,000
establishment caring for thousands of strayed and homeless pets each
year is the story of the I'alo Alto Animal Shelter since its birth eighteen
years ago when a group of irate citizens formed a humane society in
protest to the inhuman treatment of small animals.
Offering her country home as a temporary shelter for homeless and

mistreated animals, Mrs. Frank
Thomas identified herself with this
worthy project and for eighteen
years has been one of the guiding
forces of the state humane society.
Today she is superintendent of the
Animal Shelter and a vice-president
of the California Humane Associa
tion.
150 A MONTH
Caring for over 150 animals a
month is no easy job, accordng to
Mrs. Thomas. "We try to find a good
home for every animal we take in
here, but we do not give them away
to just anyone," she remarked. "By
charging a small amount for the
animals we have found that people
have a greater interest and feeling
for them."
One of the most inspiring projects
carried on by the Shelter was dur
ing the Japanese evacuation last
spring. Hundreds of small pets be
longing to the evacuees that other
wise might have been destroyed or
left homeless were adopted by the
Animal Shelter and good homes
found for the majority of them.
CONTRIBUTIONS
In 1936 the Shelter was moved to
its present site and kennels and
buildings totaling $15,000 were built.
An individual contributor in Santa
Barbara donated $10,000 and the
City of Palo Alto gave $5,000. Since
then another $10,000 has been put
into the establishment.
The Palo Alto Shelter is unique
according to its officers in that it
cares for almost any type of small
animal. Dogs and cats predomi
nate but every so often a crippled
bird or a lost rabbit is brought in.
"I 4)'s surprising how many such
animals we place in homes," added
Mrs. Thomas.

In a war-torn world where ruth
lessness and cruelty are fostered
that little plot of ground just off
University Avenue really embodies
the spirit of sacrifice and humanity.
Quietly and without fanfare it has
carried on its service to dumb ani
mals for eighteen years.
