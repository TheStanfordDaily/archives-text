# Congress Acts To Speed 18-19 Conscription
## Members Hint Student Deferment for Term Likely To He Dropped 
### 
J WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (U.R)—
The nation's top military leaders
told Congress today that a virile
"offensive" force of 7,500,000 men is
planned for 1943 and that 18 and 19-
year-olds must be drafted to pro
vide new manpower to displace the
old and physically unfit.
Early action was foreshadowed
when the chairmen of the House
and Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee promised to wind up hearings
on enabling legislation as rapidly
as possible. The House may pass its
bill this week. The outlook in the
Senate is indefinite, however.
NO QUARTER DEFERMENTS
Committee members conceded
that proposals to prohibit sending
18-year-olds overseas with less than
a year's training would be voted
down because of Army opposition.
Likewise, they said, a provision in
the Senate bill to permit college stu
dents to complete their current se
mester before being inducted will
be dropped.
High-ranking Army and Navy
officials appeared before the two
committees to urge speed and more
speed in lowering the draft age.
Salient facts developed from their
testimony were:
The Army is "growing too old"
and younger blood is needed to fight
the swift and rigorous mobile war
fare of World War 11. The young
sters would form the backbone of
America's expanding land, air and
sea forces and displace "older in
effectives" who would return to the
lathes and workshops of war in
dustries.
Drafting of married men with de
pendent wives will begin in "three
or four weeks" and lowering of the
draft age would only delay their
call for "three or four months."
The Army Air Force will be more
than doubled next year to give the
Allies air supremacy—"a prerequi
site to victory"— and land forces
will be swelled to new high levels.
A 5,000,000-man army is expected
by the end of 1942.

site to victory"— and land forces
will be swelled to new high levels.
A 5,000,000-man army is expected
by the end of 1942.
J WASHINGTON, Oct. 14 (U.R)—
The nation's top military leaders
told Congress today that a virile
"offensive" force of 7,500,000 men is
planned for 1943 and that 18 and 19-
year-olds must be drafted to pro
vide new manpower to displace the
old and physically unfit.
Early action was foreshadowed
when the chairmen of the House
and Senate Military Affairs Com
mittee promised to wind up hearings
on enabling legislation as rapidly
as possible. The House may pass its
bill this week. The outlook in the
Senate is indefinite, however.
NO QUARTER DEFERMENTS
Committee members conceded
that proposals to prohibit sending
18-year-olds overseas with less than
a year's training would be voted
down because of Army opposition.
Likewise, they said, a provision in
the Senate bill to permit college stu
dents to complete their current se
mester before being inducted will
be dropped.
High-ranking Army and Navy
officials appeared before the two
committees to urge speed and more
speed in lowering the draft age.
Salient facts developed from their
testimony were:
The Army is "growing too old"
and younger blood is needed to fight
the swift and rigorous mobile war
fare of World War 11. The young
sters would form the backbone of
America's expanding land, air and
sea forces and displace "older in
effectives" who would return to the
lathes and workshops of war in
dustries.
Drafting of married men with de
pendent wives will begin in "three
or four weeks" and lowering of the
draft age would only delay their
call for "three or four months."
The Army Air Force will be more
than doubled next year to give the
Allies air supremacy—"a prerequi
site to victory"— and land forces
will be swelled to new high levels.
