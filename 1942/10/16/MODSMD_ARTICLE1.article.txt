single men in another area have not
been called.

duction of the youngsters is neces
sary to set up a "virile" striking
force of 7,500.000 by the end of 1943.
STIMSON URGED STEP
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim
son, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George
C. Marshall, Selective Service Chief
Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey and
others urged the step to enable the
Army to replace older men with
youths who have greater stamina
and endurance.
Hershey, who testified before the
committee again today, said the
Army can meet the 7,500,000 goal
for 1943 without calling married
men with children provided Con
gress acts speedily on the issue.
He estimated that a maximum of
1,500,000 men can be drawn imme
diately from the present 18-19-year
bracket, and that an additional 1,-
200,000 will reach draft age during
1943. Thus, he said, since the Army
will number more than 5,000,000 by
Jan. 1 the 1943 goal of 7,500.000 prob
ably can be reached by induction
of 18 and 19-year-olds and those
who will reach the age of 18.

single men in another area have not
been called.
APPROVED IN 2 DAYS
The measure, drafted by Rep.
James W. Wadsworth (R., N.Y.), co
author of the original selective serv
ice act, was approved after less than
two days' consideration.
Army officials testified that in
duction of the youngsters is neces

force of 7,500.000 by the end of 1943.
STIMSON URGED STEP
Secretary of War Henry L. Stim
son, Army Chief of Staff Gen. George
C. Marshall, Selective Service Chief
Maj. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey and
others urged the step to enable the
Army to replace older men with
youths who have greater stamina
and endurance.
Hershey, who testified before the
committee again today, said the
Army can meet the 7,500,000 goal
for 1943 without calling married
men with children provided Con
gress acts speedily on the issue.
He estimated that a maximum of
1,500,000 men can be drawn imme
diately from the present 18-19-year
bracket, and that an additional 1,-
200,000 will reach draft age during
1943. Thus, he said, since the Army
will number more than 5,000,000 by
Jan. 1 the 1943 goal of 7,500.000 prob
ably can be reached by induction
of 18 and 19-year-olds and those
who will reach the age of 18.
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (U.R) —
Tlic House Military Affairs Com

It also provided, with regard to
education, that selective service shall
have discretionary authority to de
fer youths during the current aca
demic year but not after next July.
Another amendment provides that
