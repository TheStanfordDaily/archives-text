# SWB Swings Into Action For Scrap
## Campus Residences Will Be on Lookout For Metal Salvage 
### BILL HORNBY 
Completcly streamlined and rc
| organized by an SWB committee,
; the Farm's wartime salvage program
opens Saturday with a campus-wide
J collection of light scrap metal.
Working under Co-Chairmen Joan
Penberthy and Fred McGuire, the
salvage committee has divided all
potential scrap into five divisions:
Light scrap metal, heavy scrap j
metal, rubber, kitchen grease, and
workshop scrap. The first division
will be the object of Saturday's cam
paign.
The third section—rubber—will
use the plan already in force on the
campus. Collected material should
be placed in the rubber barrel near
the Cellar. If necessary, committee
members will move the container to
| different, positions on the "Farm."
Cooks of the various residences
are the main performers in the
grease collection, division four. After
grease has been strained into cans,
it should be kept until one-pound
quantities are saved. Then it should
be given to the respective group's
butcher.
COLLECTION PLAN
Metal in division one will be col
lected by trucks from salvage boxes
on the lawns of each living group.
Every group will receive a sign by
| Friday night bearing its name, said
Chairman Penberthy, so that the
amount contributed by each group
can be noted.
Tin cans should be prepared for
for collection by punching in the
ends, removing labels, and flatten
[ ing into a thick rectangle.
Wheels, bedsteads, and bed springs
are expected as contributions in the
scrap iron division. Under the sal
vage plan, during the year any cam
pus residence which finds such mate
rial will phone the CWB who will
assume responsibility for moving it
from the residence lawn and then
trucking it away.
SUNDAY JOB
As a part of this weekend's "fresh
start" session, heavy scrap metal will
be collected Sunday. Initiates from
; seven fraternities — Kappa Alpha,
Theta Xi, Kappa Sigma, Delta Up
silon, Phi Psi, Phi Kappa Sigma,
and ATO—will be on call Saturday.
They will assist any scrap-finder to
move the articles to collection points.
Trucks will finish the job Sunday.
Scrap in this division will be pur
chased from the finders.
WORKSHOP PLAN
Stanford War Workshop will be
organized toward the end of the
quarter, using scrap saved in divi
sion five. Such things as silk stock
ings, magazines, maps, etc. will be
collected by committee members for
this project. Students are asked to
I take individual responsibility for
| saving articles until they are re
! quested to turn the material in.
To co-ordinate the residence
j groups with the SWB in this new
salvage system, house representa
tives will be named.
All persons wanting help in pre
paring heavy metal for Sunday's
drive should call 9411, Local 513, be
. fore Saturday.
