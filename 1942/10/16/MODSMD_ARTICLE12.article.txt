# Cap and Gown Plans To Entertain Frosh
## 
### 
Cup and Gown is giving an in
formal dance for the Freshman
1 Class Saturday night from 9 to 12
p.m. in the Nitery. Although other
i people are welcome, the dance is
i really being given to entertain the
frosh. Somehow the idea has cir
< culated that the class of '46 has
failed to enjoy all the pleasures of
Stanford life. This is a war period,
but relaxation must be furnished
I to keep the students working.
The "Freshman Frolic" is under
the direction of Margaret Terry.
Tickets and dates may be ob
tained from Encina Sponsors, and
| all frosh arc urged to attend. Cider
! and candy will be served during
I the dance.
