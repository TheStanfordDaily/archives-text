# Battle Blazes For Stalingrad
## Nazi Troops, Planes Press Russians Rack

MOSCOW. Friday, Oct. 16 (U.R)â€”
Thirty thousand German troops
paced by 100 tanks and many planes
stormed a factory settlement in
North Stalingrad yesterday and,
at a cost of 45 tanks and more than
1500 men, pressed back the defend
ing Red army forces, a Soviet com
munique revealed today.
The battle for Stalingrad blazed
into full fury again after a pro
tracted lull, the high command re
ported. Implying that t'ne struggle
was raging unabated, it said "Our
men are selflessly repelling furious
enemy attacks."
(Berlin broadcast reports by mili
tary spokesmen that German shock
troops captured the Dshershinski
tractor plant in North Stalingrad
Thursday and broke through to the
Volga on a front of nearly two
miles.)
The Thursday midnight communi
que and earlier front dispatches said
the Germans also had stepped up
their attacks in four key areas of
the Caucasus. Intensified drives
above the Grozny oil fields and in
the Black Sea region were seen here
as a race against the bitter Russian
winter already reaching into the
Caucasus.
THREE ATTACKS
On the Mozdok front of the East
Caucasus the Germans launched
three attacks in quick succession in
efforts to crash through Soviet posi
tions, the high command said. Red
army counter-blows nailed the Nazis
to their original posts.
Resurgent hostilities also were re
ported northwest and south of Stal
ingrad. A Russian detachment stab
bing at the German flank above the
city charged the first-line trenches
of the Germans and wiped out about
a company of infantry, the late com
munique said.
An earlier report from military
sources here said the Red army "ad
vanced somewhat" northwest of
Stalingrad in its relief drive toward
the battered city.
RELIEF ARMY
(The London radio broadcast an
uncredited report that Marshal Sem
yon Timoshenko's relief army was
"making good progress and he is
now within sight of Stalingrad.)
