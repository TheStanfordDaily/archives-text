# Solomon Islands Hold; Japanese Ship Attacks New Hebrides Air Base
## U.S. and Japanese In Air-Sea Duel For Guadalcanal 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 15 (U.R) —
With a mighty showdown battle for
the Solomon Islands apparently at
hand, the Navy announced tonight
that an American base in the New
Hebrides Islands used by the ait
striking and scouting forces partici
pating in the struggle has been
shelled by a Japanese warship, prob
ably a submarine.
This development was revealed a
few hours after the Navy reported
that American and Japanese forces
in the Solomons were locked in a
great air-sea conflict for control of
the key island of Guadalcanal.
The attack in the New Hebrides
on the base at Espiritu Santo-ap
parently is aimed at hampering the
sending of aerial support into the
battle for Guadalcanal.
It was the first known attack on
the New Hebrides. Secretary of Wat-
Henry L. Stimson revealed only to -
day that U.S. Army ground forces,
as well as airmen, are now stationed
in that vital area which straddles
the American supply route to Aus
tralia.
WAVE OF BOMBERS
Tonight's communique said an
other wave of about 27 Jap bombers
again had attacked the Guadalcanal
air field—chief prize in the battle of
the Solomons and key to American
positions in that area—and that en
emy warships still were lurking off
the northern coast of Guadalcanal.
There, American planes and shore
guns fought a savage duel with Jap
forces seeking to regain bases they
lost to the United States Marines
Aug. 7.
The Japs, backcd up by a battle
ship-studded fleet and with still
another powerful armada bearing
down from the north, apparently
were going all out in a gigantic ef
fort to recapture Guadalcanal and
its air field and thus regain control
of the gateway to Australia and the
Southwest Pacific.
ARMY IN FIGHT
Reinforced Americans — Stimson
revealed that Army ground troops
had joined the hard-pressed Marines
—were hitting back fiercely in a
stubborn attempt to retain their hold
on this stepping stone to Tokyo.
Tonight's Navy communique said
there was no report pertaining to
land fighting on Guadalcanal but
Stimson had reported the Army and
Marine forces were holding tenaci
ously.
Their planes and shore guns al
ready damaged at least seven Jap
ships, including a battleship and
three transports, and destroyed
more enemy planes. The transports
were later observed "beached and
still burning" hours after the attack,
the latest communique said.
But the Japs, rebounding from
Sunday's setback at sea in which
they lost a heavy cruiser, four de
stroyers and a transport, apparently
were shooting the works. Their
men-o-war—battleships, cruisers and
destroyers—and their bombers have
been hammering away "heavily" at,
the heart of the American defense
system, the air field.
Their transports, screened by a
battleship, cruisers and destroyers,
have been pouring in reinforcements
on the north shore of Guadalcanal
scarcely 40 miles from the air field.
