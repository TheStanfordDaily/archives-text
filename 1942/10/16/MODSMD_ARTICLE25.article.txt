### 
Bob O'Neill has big hopes for the
weekend.
With the Farm's restricted social
calendar, he hopes hundreds of stu
dents will sit down and find their
nightly entertainment pouring out
Gaieties scripts to beat the final ex
tended deadline Monday noon.
And his word of advice to week
end writers is, ''Work in groups —for
best results."
To start ideas rolling, he an
nounced that all brands of satire
about campus gripes, organizations,
politics, both campus and national,
and the average man in the war
will be acceptable.
"Burlesques of such current sub
jects as "The Spirit of Stanford"
would make ideal material," he said,
"and naturally we want scripts con
cerning any and every aspect of the
Big Game."
O'Neill feels that if several stu
dents pool their ideas for a comic
skit, desirable results will be
achieved. "It should be the respon
sibility of every living group to
gather their wits about them—and
produce something."
