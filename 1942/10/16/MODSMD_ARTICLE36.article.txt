### BOB SONTAG 
Ed Stamm is out and Bob Ilall a doubtful starter tomorrow when Stan
ford series its first win of the 1942 season against Idaho. The big left
tackle bruised his hip al South Bend last week and the injury is too
severe to take chances with. Ilall. reserve end. had to be helped oil the

practice field yesterday when he
re-injured a sore ankle.
Darwin Seeley, who was in at
second-string center, has been or
dered to quit football because of an
eye infection. Tony Medved, who
played in his first varsity contest
last Saturday, will back up Milt
Vucinich at center.
Fred Boensch will fill the breach
at tackle, while Harvey Bernhard,
who showed up nicely yesterday,
will also take a turn at Stamm's
vacated position.
ANDREWS PLAYS
That quarterback Ray Hammett
will have aid in waiting was assured
when Bobby Andrews appeared in
fine shape at practice. Ben Mor
rison, now Stanford's utility man
who can play any position in the
backfield, may also play at the sig
nal spot.
Hall's ankle was quite stiff and
the hard-charging sophomore may
watch ihe game from the bench.
Roger Laverty, right end, was
named game captain.
Jim Cox gave Bruno Banducci a
real battle for the starting berth
at right tackle but "Bite 'em, Bruno"
should dig in first on the Cards'
forward wall.
CONTACT LENSES
Chuck Taylor and Loren LaPrade
are the starting guards with Dave
Patterson and John Sogorka to back
them up.
Stepping into the Redskin back
field finds Hammett at quarter, Don
Zappettini, left half, Bill Sheller,
right half, and Buck Fawcett, full.
Fawcett will be wearing contact
lenses tomorrow and his game is
expected to improve greatly. .
A1 Hoisch busted loose on several
quick openers yesterday and will
undoubtedly do some ball carrying
at left half. Sheller, who averaged
41 yards per kick at South Bend,
booted beautifully during practice
and Hammett also got off a few
long ones. Â»
IDAHO A MYSTERY
As for the weak pass defense that
has thus far ruined the '42 T, Coach
Marchie Schwartz drilled his de
fenders for an hour. Game time will
be the only judge of his success.
Schwartz said last night he was
encouraged by the final test before
the game.
Idaho is still the great American
mystery. One thing to be sure of is
the passing ability of one Howard
Manson. Beat Manson's aerials and
you beat Idaho.
