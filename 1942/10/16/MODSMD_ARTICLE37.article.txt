### BOB SONTAG 
FOOTBALL SCORES:
For those who sink or swim in
1 his week's football pools, we add
our prognostications, fresh from the
40-yard line of yesterday's practice:
Stanford 20. Idaho (5
UCLA 1.1, California 7
rsc 14. WSC 14
Washington 4ft. Montana ft
Stanford is rated 14 points better
than Idaho, not because it is actual
ly two touchdowns superior, but be
cause it would look nice on the
scoreboard.
UCLA gains the nod over Cali
fornia because of the Bruins' 30-7
win of a week ago over Oregon
State.
Southern California is picked to
tie the Cougars not because it should
but because it will do Stanford and
everybody else in the conference a
lot of good to have Washington State
drop one or tie one.
As for out-of-conference games,
Santa Clara could do it again over
Oregon State, while Washington
should bully Montana at will. Moti
tana is in the conferenceâ€”but hard
ly figures to bother anybody.
