# Frosh To Meet Pre-Flighters Tomorrow, 11
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman footballers
get a real test tomorrow when they
play the heavier, older, and more
experienced St. Mary's Pre-flight B
team in a preliminary to the varsity-
Idaho game.
Included in the St. Mary's roster I
are two former Stanfordites, Bob |
Burnett, basketballer, and Bud Mad- ;
den, winner of a frosh football nu
meral.
Coach Francis Wilcox will start
the same combination that marched
to two quick first quarter scores
against Menlo Junior College last
week, winning 25-20. Stanford's
line averages 188, the backfield 185.
Yesterday afternoon the frosh
went through a light dummy scrim
mage against five- and seven-man
lines. Today's practice will em
phasize signal and pass drill.
PRE-FLIGHT A MYSTERY
The Pre-flight team, coached by
James Dixon, formerly an assistant
at Oregon State, is a mystery. It
has yet to play an outside game.
But the Pre-flighters have been
scrimmaging with the varsity for
the past four weeks on opposition
plays, gaining plenty of experience.
Constant turnover hampers the for
mation of a smooth functioning out
fit.
In the backfield at right half for
the Navy is Manuel De Maria, for
merly of Salinas J.C. and the Uni
versity of Nevada. Left halfback is
Don Smith of the University of
Washington. Wallace Johnson, who
played for Kansas, is at fullback,
and Jack McDermott, a newcomer,
is at quarterback.
Starting at left end for the Pre
flight team is Bob Ramsauer, who
saw action under Coach Stub Alli
son at California.
HAMLIN AT FULL
With the return of Bill Agnew to
playing condition, Homer Hamlin
has been permanently moved to
fullback, where he is understudying
hard-driving Steve Tish. Agnew
will alternate with Mark Heffelfin
ger at right half. Lloyd Merriman 1
is at left half. Jack Brownson will
lead the team from quarterback. I
with Jay McKie as an able replace- ,
ment.
Bob Berryman turned in a good j
game at right tackle last week, and |
has pulled ahead of Ted Burke, who
was giving him a hot contest. Frank
Heffclfinger and Carson Rasmussen
should see plenty of action at the J
ends.
John Paules and Paul Prevost will
be out of the game due to injuries, i
