# Students Lend a Hand To Nation's Farmers
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
The labor shortage is no more localized than army conscription. By
December, 7,500,000 men will have been inducted. Every rural community
is already staggering from loss of manpower, and it's largely students and
women who arc streaming to the fields with buckets and gloves.
Local newspapers across the country are carrying stories of their towns-

people's response to the shortage."
Early tomorrow, Stanford women
will be picking tomatoes, Pennsyl
vania students will husk corn, Pasa
denans will crate oranges. It's what
Roosevelt calls the "American way."
Back East, this is a bumper year
for corn, and harvesting hands are
at a premium. The "College News,"
of Bryn Mawr College, Pa., reports
regular expeditions of students have
been filling corn cribs for local
farmers.
STUDENTS PICK ORANGES
Down South there is an orange
picking emergency. A student fore
man at Pasadena Junior College has
organized a group of boys to give
Monrovia orchardists a hand, re
ports the "Pasadena Chronicle."
Hundreds of Sacramento house
wives are learning what lies behind
the cans of tomatoes on their grocers'
shelves, wrote the S.F. Chronicle.
Business women and mothers are
leaving their jobs and children after
hours, and are volunteering their
labor in canneries.
TOMATO WORKERS CALLED
The San Francisco Wartime Har
vest Council has issued a call for
workers in the tomato harvest, and
hope to enlist 280 high school volun
teers before the first frost.
West Coast labor has been hit the
hardest. Shipyards in the bay re
gion, aircraft factories in the Bur
bank area, with the evacuation of
7000 Japanese, have heightened the
effect of the draft on labor.
This loads responsibility on West
Coast students. The girls will har
vest tomatoes tomorrow, but more
are needed, for sustained weekend
work—for the duration.

work—for the duration.
The labor shortage is no more localized than army conscription. By
December, 7,500,000 men will have been inducted. Every rural community
is already staggering from loss of manpower, and it's largely students and
women who arc streaming to the fields with buckets and gloves.
Local newspapers across the country are carrying stories of their towns-

people's response to the shortage."
Early tomorrow, Stanford women
will be picking tomatoes, Pennsyl
vania students will husk corn, Pasa
denans will crate oranges. It's what
Roosevelt calls the "American way."
Back East, this is a bumper year
for corn, and harvesting hands are
at a premium. The "College News,"
of Bryn Mawr College, Pa., reports
regular expeditions of students have
been filling corn cribs for local
farmers.
STUDENTS PICK ORANGES
Down South there is an orange
picking emergency. A student fore
man at Pasadena Junior College has
organized a group of boys to give
Monrovia orchardists a hand, re
ports the "Pasadena Chronicle."
Hundreds of Sacramento house
wives are learning what lies behind
the cans of tomatoes on their grocers'
shelves, wrote the S.F. Chronicle.
Business women and mothers are
leaving their jobs and children after
hours, and are volunteering their
labor in canneries.
TOMATO WORKERS CALLED
The San Francisco Wartime Har
vest Council has issued a call for
workers in the tomato harvest, and
hope to enlist 280 high school volun
teers before the first frost.
West Coast labor has been hit the
hardest. Shipyards in the bay re
gion, aircraft factories in the Bur
bank area, with the evacuation of
7000 Japanese, have heightened the
effect of the draft on labor.
This loads responsibility on West
Coast students. The girls will har
vest tomatoes tomorrow, but more
are needed, for sustained weekend
work—for the duration.
