# Royal Sailors Sink Cardinals

### BOB FISHER 
A real lesson in the good old
English game of soccer was dealtout
to the Stanford varsity yesterday
afternoon when two teams of Royal
Navy sailors overwhelmed the In
dians 6-1 and 4-0.
This was the first game of the sea
son for the Stanford players, who
have had only two weeks of prac
tice. The British sailors on the oth
er hand have had over half a dozen
games under their belt. Yet there
was no question as to which was the
better team no matter how much
practice each has had. Stanford
was outclassed from the very start.
SAILORS HURRY
In the first game, the sailors went
to work in a hurry and made three
goals within five minutes. Rene
Paz, inside right, scored Stanford's
only goal on a long 50-yard kick to
make the score 3-1, but the Royal
Navy rushed in two more goals be
fore the end of the half to put the
game on ice.
Stanford looked much better in
the second half and held the sailors
to only one more goal. The second
team also played a better second
half, holding their opponents score
less; but again the game had al
ready been decided in the first pe
riod with four Navy goals.
FRENCH STARS
Don French, inside left for the
British, led his team in scoring with
three well-placed goals. Sammy
Devine, the Royal Navy's star for
ward, counted two, and Lieut. Pratt,
the center forward, booted in the
final tally.
The only commendable feature of
Stanford's game was the defensive
play. Since most of the game was
played in Stanford's territory, the
backs had to play a rugged game to
keep the score as low as it was.
Coach Harry Maloney's only com
ment on yesterday afternoon's games
was, "Our boys gained a valuable
lesson today; probably as valuable
as they will receive all season."
