# It'll Be Tougher

### 
IT'S tough on a fellow in school when he is
spending a lot of time and money trying to
get an education when he isn't sure whether
or not he will be able to finish his job before
the Army steps in and takes him away.
All of us realize that, but most of us have
done nothing about it. We all heard or read
about Roosevelt's speech concerning the con
scription of 'teen-age youths. That talk had us
worried because we weren't exactly sure what
our status was to be. Even though we knew
that many of us would be called away soon, we
weren't quite sure what to do with our personal
problems.
There is something which the college men
who have not acted as yet can do to assure
themselves of getting a good education for jobs
after the war and for making sure that they get
a crack at becoming officers while the war is
still going on.
First, they should sign with one of the many
reserve corps; you know what they are—V-7,
Enlisted Reserve, V-l, and all of the others.
Second, take the courses demanded by these
branches of the service and get good grades
in them.
Third, concentrate primarily upon studies, no
matter what you are taking.
Maybe an explanation of the full power of
the local draft board would help pound reality
into some of the foggy-brained individuals who
have not yet realized the seriousness of the
problem.
If a student of draft age is registered in one
of the reserves and goes minus, the powers
above have no choice but to yank that student
out of school and put him into the Army where
he will do his country more good. This means
that a college student has to be just that if he
wants to become an officer.
If a student of draft age has not registered
with any of the reserves and he gets his induc
tion orders, he is beyond help. It takes such a
little bit of effort to get into one of the reserves
compared with the amount of time the student
loses when he has to go into the Army with an
incomplete education.
Thus, there are two important things for the
student to remember: (1) To those who have not
joined a reserve, join one immediately, or you
will have lost a chance to be a well-trained
officer after graduation. (2) To those in the re
serves, don't threaten your enviable position
by neglecting your studies.
And to report a tip which has more truth than
rumor to it, if you are inclined to go to cock
tail parties or be "seen around the local night
spots," make sure you keep your name out of
the papers because the draft board will be
positive then that you are wasting your time
at college. It would be a good idea to stay
away from excessive notoriety anyway—un
less you look attractive in khaki.

loses when he has to go into the Army with an
incomplete education.
Thus, there are two important things for the
student to remember: (1) To those who have not
joined a reserve, join one immediately, or you
will have lost a chance to be a well-trained
officer after graduation. (2) To those in the re
serves, don't threaten your enviable position
by neglecting your studies.
And to report a tip which has more truth than
rumor to it, if you are inclined to go to cock
tail parties or be "seen around the local night
spots," make sure you keep your name out of
the papers because the draft board will be
positive then that you are wasting your time
at college. It would be a good idea to stay
away from excessive notoriety anyway—un
less you look attractive in khaki.
IT'S tough on a fellow in school when he is
spending a lot of time and money trying to
get an education when he isn't sure whether
or not he will be able to finish his job before
the Army steps in and takes him away.
All of us realize that, but most of us have
done nothing about it. We all heard or read
about Roosevelt's speech concerning the con
scription of 'teen-age youths. That talk had us
worried because we weren't exactly sure what
our status was to be. Even though we knew
that many of us would be called away soon, we
weren't quite sure what to do with our personal
problems.
There is something which the college men
who have not acted as yet can do to assure
themselves of getting a good education for jobs
after the war and for making sure that they get
a crack at becoming officers while the war is
still going on.
First, they should sign with one of the many
reserve corps; you know what they are—V-7,
Enlisted Reserve, V-l, and all of the others.
Second, take the courses demanded by these
branches of the service and get good grades
in them.
Third, concentrate primarily upon studies, no
matter what you are taking.
Maybe an explanation of the full power of
the local draft board would help pound reality
into some of the foggy-brained individuals who
have not yet realized the seriousness of the
problem.
If a student of draft age is registered in one
of the reserves and goes minus, the powers
above have no choice but to yank that student
out of school and put him into the Army where
he will do his country more good. This means
that a college student has to be just that if he
wants to become an officer.
If a student of draft age has not registered
with any of the reserves and he gets his induc
tion orders, he is beyond help. It takes such a
little bit of effort to get into one of the reserves
compared with the amount of time the student
loses when he has to go into the Army with an
incomplete education.
