# The
						Best Day
## 
### 
TODAY is the fifth day of Indian summer. It
doesn't mean much in the long range or the
large scope of things, but it is sort of nice to
know that today is the fifth day of Indian sum
mer.
Indian summer is a pause in the seasons. The
tired and faded summer is washed away by the
first rains which are the forerunners of fall. The
best of each is mixed up -the cold of autumn
and the sunshine of summer- and the nippy,
cold, hard, blight days are the result.
We may not have the time, the tires, nor the
gasoline to rush off to the hills and scuffle
through the leaves and drink cold apple cider.
Even though we can't do this, we should pay
homage to Indian summer in some way. So
look at the bright sky, take a deep breath and
say, "Today is the best day in the world."—Al
Hampson
