OCTOBER 14, 1942
Editor, Stanford Daily
Stanford University, Calif.
DEAR SIR: (That is the first big mistake made
by the author of this note. The Editor is not a
gentleman.)
Mr. Thoreau (that's me) should be put on the
"pan" for writing as he did in regard to the pic
ture in which Frankie Albert (sometimes referred
to as Eiknarf Trebla) starred. It wasn't in the least
smart to write his name EIKNARF TREBLA (more
commonly known as Frankie Albert).
Thousands of people enjoyed the games in
which Frankie played I he's referring to football
games for the Glendale Dynamiters, 1935-37, and
for the Stanford Indians, 1938-41. Total paid at
tendance for these games was $1,200,000.) The
student body had a real team (lie talks as if Albert
was the properly of the A.S.S.U.) —and they were
proud to say they attended Stanford I this guy
comes to Stanford to be associated with a win
ning football team. Isn't the addition of Mr. Mum
ford more valuable to the school than the loss of
Mr. Albert?) There were no excuses to be made
for THAT team I Duke Hammett ought lo slug
this guy.) Frankie look valuable time from his
studies (writing this tripe takes a lot of lime too),
and he also took many a hard bruise (granted).
This Mr. Thoreau (that's me) can sit on his lazy
behind and write reviews (granted), but has HE
the intestinal fortitude (guts) to lake the physical
beatings the boys do? 1 was out for rugby
for one day and got hit in the face by Bill Sheller. (
Ihe smallness of his make-up 15-ft.11 1 •», 159
pounds) is indicated in the write-up in this morn
ings Daily (notice —no apostrophe in "morning's."
lie's almost illiterate.) We who appreciate that
the boys play their hearts out that others may have
pleasure in seeing the games—and play for the
glory of STANFORD (how does DORFNATS
sound?), resent such smarl-aleckness that appeared
this morning.
Here is one Stanfordite who would like to place
a kick upon Mr. Thoreau's (that's me) anatomy
where it would do the most good (all right, where
do you think it would do the most good?) And
may the good Lord (why bring him into lliis) bless
us with more students of the caliber of EIKNARF
TREBLA (and less like Thoreau. eh?).
