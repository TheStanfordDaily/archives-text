LDI'I OK, Dear Sir:
Apparenlty not enough scripts are coming in
for the Gaieties. O'Neill sa\s with a desperate air.
that lie is making a last minute appeal. It seems
evident that the Gaieties will fold if the appeal is
not answered. Frankly. I don't think it will. People
are busy. I>lll that is no reason to do awa\ with the
show. \\ by not lake the skils from past shows
make this year's production a Gaieties Review?
In the few shows thai I have seen, there are many
acts I would like to see again. And I would cer
tainly like to see some of those top acts that grad
uates sometimes tell me about.
One of the hardest things about pulling a show
together is lr\ing IÂ«> figure out what would please
the audience. What could be belter than lÂ«> use
acts alread\ Iried and tested?
Don't <fnil. O'Neill, lei's keep 'em laughing, too.
JACK O.
