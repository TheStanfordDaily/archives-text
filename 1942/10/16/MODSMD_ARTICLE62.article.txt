### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 15 (U.R)â€”'The
National Association of Broadcasters
said tonight that "the social and eco
nomical implication" of Federal
Judge John P. Barnes' dismissal of
the government's anti-trust suit
against James C. Petrillo and the
American Federation of Musicians
"are far wider than the recording
issue" and permits "workers of any
category to strike against machinery
in their fields."
