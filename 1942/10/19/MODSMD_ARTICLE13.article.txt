# SWB Solves Union Mess In Canneries
## Forkner, Nole Named Labor Supervisors By Rosemary Cross 
### 
The campus cannery problem, for
all practical purposes, is settled. Last
week Excom received official notice
from Rosemary Cross, War Board
chairman, that Luanna Forkner and
Nancy Dole had been appointed su
pervisors of Stanford's cannery labor
organization.
Stanford labor is now ox-ganized on
an "emergency" basis. The insoluble
union stipulation that requires even
part-time student help to affiliate,
has frustrated SWB attempts to send
out regular weekend labor corps, as
was its original intention.
GROUPS DESIGNATED
Through a clause in the local can
neries' union contracts, which allows
new workers 10 days to become
members, the SWB will now func
tion. Representatives of all men's
living groups have been designated
to recruit volunteers to stand by for
an emergency call. They will submit
names to the War Board committee,
which will keep them on file.
When a cannery issues a sudden
demand for help, it will notify Miss
Helen Vincent, U.S. Employment
Bureau. She, in turn, will relay the
message to the SWB, specifying the
number needed, hours, and trans
portation facilities. By a means of
systematized rotation among the four
local canneries, volunteer students
will be able to work from four to
eight times before the 10-day limit
overtakes them. It is the SWB com
mittee's function to keep account of
days worked at each cannery by in
dividual records.
UNCONFINED AID
This organization is not confined
to cannery aid, however. Wherever
there is a need—at shipyards, fruit
orchards or canneries—the campus
organization is capable of fulfilling
it.
In a few weeks, Rosemary Cross
expects a call from walnut orchards
lor corps of both men and women.
"Knockers," to slap walnuts from
the trees, will be comprised of men.
Women are needed to gather the
nuts from the ground.
Miss Cross emphasized that, de
spite obstacles encountered, the need
remains and urged house represen
tatives to co-operate "to the fullest
extent."

Through a clause in the local can
neries' union contracts, which allows
new workers 10 days to become
members, the SWB will now func
tion. Representatives of all men's
living groups have been designated
to recruit volunteers to stand by for
an emergency call. They will submit
names to the War Board committee,
which will keep them on file.
When a cannery issues a sudden
demand for help, it will notify Miss
Helen Vincent, U.S. Employment
Bureau. She, in turn, will relay the
message to the SWB, specifying the
number needed, hours, and trans
portation facilities. By a means of
systematized rotation among the four
local canneries, volunteer students
will be able to work from four to
eight times before the 10-day limit
overtakes them. It is the SWB com
mittee's function to keep account of
days worked at each cannery by in
dividual records.
UNCONFINED AID
This organization is not confined
to cannery aid, however. Wherever
there is a need—at shipyards, fruit
orchards or canneries—the campus
organization is capable of fulfilling
it.
In a few weeks, Rosemary Cross
expects a call from walnut orchards
lor corps of both men and women.
"Knockers," to slap walnuts from
the trees, will be comprised of men.
Women are needed to gather the
nuts from the ground.
Miss Cross emphasized that, de
spite obstacles encountered, the need
remains and urged house represen
tatives to co-operate "to the fullest
extent."
The campus cannery problem, for
all practical purposes, is settled. Last
week Excom received official notice
from Rosemary Cross, War Board
chairman, that Luanna Forkner and
Nancy Dole had been appointed su
pervisors of Stanford's cannery labor
organization.
Stanford labor is now ox-ganized on
an "emergency" basis. The insoluble
union stipulation that requires even
part-time student help to affiliate,
has frustrated SWB attempts to send
out regular weekend labor corps, as
was its original intention.
