# Solomon Stand Is Now Critical
## Japs Pound Airfield; Gather Assault Force 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 18 (UP).—
The American position in the Solo
mon Islands became increasingly
critical tonight as the Navy reported
continued Jap bombings of Guadal
canal and enemy naval and troop
concentrations pointing to a "strong
j assault" against the island's vital
airport now held by U.S. forces.
But the more important develop
ments on the American strategic sit
uation were contained in the Solo
mons communique which said the
enemy is "continuing to bomb our
airfield and short positions on Gua
dalcanal Island and it is believed
that enemy troops and equipment
are being disposed for a strong as
sault against our air field."
The Navy said that no new Japa
nese troop landings have been de
tected on the key island since Oct. 15
(Solomons time), but noted omi
nously that "heavy concentrations
of enemy ships"—presumably in
cluding transports—are still report
ed in the Buin-Shortland area, 260
miles northwest of Guadalcanal.
Again there was no mention of
American naval surface units, al
though on Saturday Navy Secretary
Frank Knox had intimated there
were some in the area when he said:
"Our land, sea and air forces of
the Army, Navy and Marine Corps
are engaged in meeting a serious
enemy assault, the outcome of which
is still undecided."
While the overtone of the latest
Navy announcement on the Solo
mons was ominous, it also contained
irrefutable proof that the Japs'
mightiest efforts have been unable
to prevent U.S. air fighters from
making effective use of their air
field.
