firmly in the rubble of Stalingrad
killed 6,000 German troops and
wrecked 45 tanks on two narrow
sectors yesterday in hurling back
furious armored and infantry on
slaughts, the Red Army announced
today.
The Russians kept their defense
lines through the streets of Stalin
grad intact throughout the fifth day
of the concentrated German effort
to smash through to the Volga, the
high command said in its Sunday
midnight communique.
For the third time in 36 hours the
high command said there was no
lasting German success in the great
attack on the industrial section of
north Stalingrad, despite the inten
sification of the assaults and the ar
rival of Nazi reinforcements.
"In the Stalingrad area our troops
i repelled furious attacks by enemy
! infantry and tanks,' 'the late com
j munique said.
German infantry, supported by
j tanks and planes, attacked Soviet
| defensive points in one unidentified
! area, precipitating bloody struggles
in which the Russians destroyed 28
enemy tanks, eight field guns, and
10 trench mortar batteries, and
"wiped out three infantry battal
ions," the late communique said.
