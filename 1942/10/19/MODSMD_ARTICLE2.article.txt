# Card Hang Up New Stadium Scoring Record In Idaho Win
## 
### CHARLIE ALLEN 
Stanford's victory-starved footballers poured it on a hapless Idaho!
team, 54-7, for their first win of the season before a sparse crowd of 4.000
in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Besides signifying the Indians first victory of the season, the convinc
ing manner which marked the Stanford attack brought hope again to

students who witnessed the game.
For the first time since the days
i of Frankie Albeit, the T began to
roll. Behind two low-chargmg lines
that opened up the Vandal forwards
with ease, the inexperienced Indian
backs bit off high chunks of yard
age.
INDIANS SCORE ON GROUND
Keeping mostly to the ground, the
Indians piled up more points than
any other Stanford team has ever
tallied in Stanford Stadium. Buck
Fawcett spearheaded a ground at
tack that struck with devastating
speed and fury behind vicious
blocking. The Los Banos speedster
ran roughshod for three touch
downs, Blazing Ben Morrison scam
pered for two, Bill Sheller also got
a pair, and chunky Art Shipkey
blasted his way for the last one.
After a few early moments of un
certainty in which the fumbling In
dians got under way, Fawcett cli
maxed a 45-yard march by racing
around Idaho's right end as Zappet
tini blasted the wingback out of
the way. Fawcett hit the sidelines
and cut in sharply to slide into the
end zone for the first score. Hank
Norberg placekicked the extra point
and the rout was on.
TAYLOR, LA PRADE STAR
With Chuck Taylor and Loren
LaPrade, Ail-Americans Saturday
if there were a couple, blasting Van
dals out of the way with key blocks,
F'awcett ran wild to either right or
left. Once the key blocks sprung
him around the end, he was gone,
and the Los Banos boy never looked
better. He is developing a slashing
deception that made Bobby Gray
son the terror of Coast football in
Vow Boy days.
The whole picture was encourag
ing. Hammett looked better than
ever before, and little Bobby An
drews showed lots of talent, espe
cially in the passing department.
Slashing Dick Munroe, unveiled
for the first time this year, and 249-
pound Art Shipkey, who rolls like a
supercharged tank, tore what was
!eft of the Vandal line to shreds.
Blazing Ben Morrison, who became
a good back in the Santa game, was
a great ball-carrier Saturday. He
thread-needled his way through a
dozen tacklers for a score and
breezed home with Bobby Andrews'
rifle toss to score a little later.
INDIAN LINE STRONG
But the big difference was still
the Indian line. The first team for
ward wall tore gaping holes in the
Vandal line and smothered the Ida- i
ho attack deep in the back field. The '
Indians were in so fast that the
Vandal kickers were continually 1
pulling their punts short in order I
to keep from having them blocked. !
Bill Young, reserve guard, showed I
plenty of fight and enough drive to
place him up near Chuck Taylor |
and Loren LaPrade as guards. Both
reserve tackles, Jim Cox and Fred
Boensch, were great. The Indian i
line improves with every game and ,
may be the best on the Coast right
now.
Coach Marchie Schwartz was very
much encouraged by the Indians'
showing although he realized that.
Idaho is hardly first class oppo
sition. Yet the pass defense was
better, backfield timing was good,
and there was always that Fawcett—
fast approaching the title of best
back on the Coast.
Ed Stamm, giant tackle, took it
easy Saturday but will be ready for
the U.S.C. game next week. All
members of the squad who didn't
play will scrimmage today, and the
entire squad will begin work for
the Trojan tomorrow.
That's something else again—may
be we've got another one of those
hair-raising T formation outfits
we've all been dreaming about. The
Trojan game will tell.

Stanford's victory-starved footballers poured it on a hapless Idaho!
team, 54-7, for their first win of the season before a sparse crowd of 4.000
in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Besides signifying the Indians first victory of the season, the convinc
ing manner which marked the Stanford attack brought hope again to

students who witnessed the game.
For the first time since the days
i of Frankie Albeit, the T began to
roll. Behind two low-chargmg lines
that opened up the Vandal forwards
with ease, the inexperienced Indian
backs bit off high chunks of yard
age.
INDIANS SCORE ON GROUND
Keeping mostly to the ground, the
Indians piled up more points than
any other Stanford team has ever
tallied in Stanford Stadium. Buck
Fawcett spearheaded a ground at
tack that struck with devastating
speed and fury behind vicious
blocking. The Los Banos speedster
ran roughshod for three touch
downs, Blazing Ben Morrison scam
pered for two, Bill Sheller also got
a pair, and chunky Art Shipkey
blasted his way for the last one.
After a few early moments of un
certainty in which the fumbling In
dians got under way, Fawcett cli
maxed a 45-yard march by racing
around Idaho's right end as Zappet
tini blasted the wingback out of
the way. Fawcett hit the sidelines
and cut in sharply to slide into the
end zone for the first score. Hank
Norberg placekicked the extra point
and the rout was on.
TAYLOR, LA PRADE STAR
With Chuck Taylor and Loren
LaPrade, Ail-Americans Saturday
if there were a couple, blasting Van
dals out of the way with key blocks,
F'awcett ran wild to either right or
left. Once the key blocks sprung
him around the end, he was gone,
and the Los Banos boy never looked
better. He is developing a slashing
deception that made Bobby Gray
son the terror of Coast football in
Vow Boy days.
The whole picture was encourag
ing. Hammett looked better than
ever before, and little Bobby An
drews showed lots of talent, espe
cially in the passing department.
Slashing Dick Munroe, unveiled
for the first time this year, and 249-
pound Art Shipkey, who rolls like a
supercharged tank, tore what was
!eft of the Vandal line to shreds.
Blazing Ben Morrison, who became
a good back in the Santa game, was
a great ball-carrier Saturday. He
thread-needled his way through a
dozen tacklers for a score and
breezed home with Bobby Andrews'
rifle toss to score a little later.
INDIAN LINE STRONG
But the big difference was still
the Indian line. The first team for
ward wall tore gaping holes in the
Vandal line and smothered the Ida- i
ho attack deep in the back field. The '
Indians were in so fast that the
Vandal kickers were continually 1
pulling their punts short in order I
to keep from having them blocked. !
Bill Young, reserve guard, showed I
plenty of fight and enough drive to
place him up near Chuck Taylor |
and Loren LaPrade as guards. Both
reserve tackles, Jim Cox and Fred
Boensch, were great. The Indian i
line improves with every game and ,
may be the best on the Coast right
now.
Coach Marchie Schwartz was very
much encouraged by the Indians'
showing although he realized that.

showing although he realized that.
Idaho is hardly first class oppo
sition. Yet the pass defense was
better, backfield timing was good,
and there was always that Fawcett—
fast approaching the title of best
back on the Coast.
Ed Stamm, giant tackle, took it
easy Saturday but will be ready for
the U.S.C. game next week. All
members of the squad who didn't
play will scrimmage today, and the
entire squad will begin work for
the Trojan tomorrow.
That's something else again—may
be we've got another one of those
hair-raising T formation outfits
we've all been dreaming about. The
Trojan game will tell.
Stanford's victory-starved footballers poured it on a hapless Idaho!
team, 54-7, for their first win of the season before a sparse crowd of 4.000
in Stanford Stadium Saturday.
Besides signifying the Indians first victory of the season, the convinc
ing manner which marked the Stanford attack brought hope again to

students who witnessed the game.
For the first time since the days
i of Frankie Albeit, the T began to
roll. Behind two low-chargmg lines
that opened up the Vandal forwards
with ease, the inexperienced Indian
backs bit off high chunks of yard
age.
INDIANS SCORE ON GROUND
Keeping mostly to the ground, the
Indians piled up more points than
any other Stanford team has ever
tallied in Stanford Stadium. Buck
Fawcett spearheaded a ground at
tack that struck with devastating
speed and fury behind vicious
blocking. The Los Banos speedster
ran roughshod for three touch
downs, Blazing Ben Morrison scam
pered for two, Bill Sheller also got
a pair, and chunky Art Shipkey
blasted his way for the last one.
After a few early moments of un
certainty in which the fumbling In
dians got under way, Fawcett cli
maxed a 45-yard march by racing
around Idaho's right end as Zappet
tini blasted the wingback out of
the way. Fawcett hit the sidelines
and cut in sharply to slide into the
end zone for the first score. Hank
Norberg placekicked the extra point
and the rout was on.
TAYLOR, LA PRADE STAR
With Chuck Taylor and Loren
LaPrade, Ail-Americans Saturday
if there were a couple, blasting Van
dals out of the way with key blocks,
F'awcett ran wild to either right or
left. Once the key blocks sprung
him around the end, he was gone,
and the Los Banos boy never looked
better. He is developing a slashing
deception that made Bobby Gray
son the terror of Coast football in
Vow Boy days.
The whole picture was encourag
ing. Hammett looked better than
ever before, and little Bobby An
drews showed lots of talent, espe
cially in the passing department.
Slashing Dick Munroe, unveiled
for the first time this year, and 249-
pound Art Shipkey, who rolls like a
supercharged tank, tore what was
!eft of the Vandal line to shreds.
Blazing Ben Morrison, who became
a good back in the Santa game, was
a great ball-carrier Saturday. He
thread-needled his way through a
dozen tacklers for a score and
breezed home with Bobby Andrews'
rifle toss to score a little later.
INDIAN LINE STRONG
But the big difference was still
the Indian line. The first team for
ward wall tore gaping holes in the
Vandal line and smothered the Ida- i
ho attack deep in the back field. The '
Indians were in so fast that the
Vandal kickers were continually 1
pulling their punts short in order I
to keep from having them blocked. !
Bill Young, reserve guard, showed I
plenty of fight and enough drive to
place him up near Chuck Taylor |
and Loren LaPrade as guards. Both
reserve tackles, Jim Cox and Fred
Boensch, were great. The Indian i
line improves with every game and ,
may be the best on the Coast right
now.
