# Legislation Speeded on 18-19 Draft
## Completion of Bill Planned for End Of This Week 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. !K (UP).—
Prompt Senate action on legislation
to draft 18- and 19-ycar-old men
was promised tonight by adminis
tration leaders eager to send the
measure to President Roosevelt by
the end of this week.
Senate Democratic Leader Alben
W. Barkley of Kentucky said con
sideration of the Senate bill, to be
formally reported tomorrow, will
be undertaken "at the earliest pos
sible opportunity" — probably on
Tuesday.
He has reached no definite under
standing with Republican Leader
Charles L. McNary of Oregon, who
wants to delay debate until minority
members return to the capital, but
said flatly that "I don't want to put
it off until the end of the week."
McNary urged the postponement
until he can round up Republican
Senators who left Washington after
passage of the record tax bill 10
days ago on the understanding no
controversial legislation would La
brought up in their absence.
DIFFERS SLIGHTLY
The Senate bill, approved unani
mously by the Military Affairs Com
mittee on Friday, differs only in
minor aspects from the House ver
sion passed by an overwhelming 345
to 16 vote Saturday afternoon. Both
will lower the minimum draft age
from 20 to 18 to add some 1,500,000
'teen-age youth to the rapidly ex
panding army, which has set a goal
of 7,500,000 men by the end of 194.'5.
Barkley predicted the Senate will
"perfect its own bill and substitute
it for the House measure," leaving
any differences to be ironed out in
conference. He said it conforms
more closely to Army and Selective
Service recommendations and that
"the less complications, restrictions
and loopholes we have, the better."
Principal Senate light is expected
on an elaborate "draft priority''
system—approved by the House but
rejected by the Senate committee—
which would prohibit the induction
of married men in any given state
until all supplies of single men are
exhausted, and would prevent in
duction of men with children until
all childless married men have been
called.
Another difference in the two
bills involves the deferment of
youths to complete educational
courses. The Senate version pro
vides special temporary deferments
for high school students called dur
ing the second half of the current
academic year; the House bill ex
tends the deferment clause to col
leges as well.
Both measures make liable for
military service men now deferred
in class 4-F because of convictions
of "dry law" violations during the
prohibition era. And they repeal
the present law requiring the Army
to discharge men who enlisted be
fore they were 21 without parental
consent and by falsifying their ages.

'teen-age youth to the rapidly ex
panding army, which has set a goal
of 7,500,000 men by the end of 194.'5.
Barkley predicted the Senate will
"perfect its own bill and substitute
it for the House measure," leaving
any differences to be ironed out in
conference. He said it conforms
more closely to Army and Selective
Service recommendations and that
"the less complications, restrictions
and loopholes we have, the better."
Principal Senate light is expected
on an elaborate "draft priority''
system—approved by the House but
rejected by the Senate committee—
which would prohibit the induction
of married men in any given state
until all supplies of single men are
exhausted, and would prevent in
duction of men with children until
all childless married men have been
called.
Another difference in the two
bills involves the deferment of
youths to complete educational
courses. The Senate version pro
vides special temporary deferments
for high school students called dur
ing the second half of the current
academic year; the House bill ex
tends the deferment clause to col
leges as well.
Both measures make liable for
military service men now deferred
in class 4-F because of convictions
of "dry law" violations during the
prohibition era. And they repeal
the present law requiring the Army
to discharge men who enlisted be
fore they were 21 without parental
consent and by falsifying their ages.
WASHINGTON, Oct. !K (UP).—
Prompt Senate action on legislation
to draft 18- and 19-ycar-old men
was promised tonight by adminis
tration leaders eager to send the
measure to President Roosevelt by
the end of this week.
Senate Democratic Leader Alben
W. Barkley of Kentucky said con
sideration of the Senate bill, to be
formally reported tomorrow, will
be undertaken "at the earliest pos
sible opportunity" — probably on
Tuesday.
He has reached no definite under
standing with Republican Leader
Charles L. McNary of Oregon, who
wants to delay debate until minority
members return to the capital, but
said flatly that "I don't want to put
it off until the end of the week."
McNary urged the postponement
until he can round up Republican
Senators who left Washington after
passage of the record tax bill 10
days ago on the understanding no
controversial legislation would La
brought up in their absence.
DIFFERS SLIGHTLY
The Senate bill, approved unani
mously by the Military Affairs Com
mittee on Friday, differs only in
minor aspects from the House ver
sion passed by an overwhelming 345
to 16 vote Saturday afternoon. Both
will lower the minimum draft age
from 20 to 18 to add some 1,500,000
'teen-age youth to the rapidly ex
panding army, which has set a goal
of 7,500,000 men by the end of 194.'5.
