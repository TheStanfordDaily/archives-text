### 
NEW YORK, Oct. 18. UPâ€”Stock
prices rose to new pre-Pearl Harbor
highs early last week and then re
acted rather sharply in a technical
adjustment which was intensified by
an unfavorable turn in the war news
from both the Stalingrad and Solo
mon Islands fronts.
The stock exchange was closed
Monday for the Columbus Day holi
day but Tuesday the advance in
progress in the preceding week was
resumed and the Dow Jones Indus
trial, Rail and 65 stock averages all
climbed to their best levels since
before this country's entry into the
war.
