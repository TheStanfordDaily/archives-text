# GOING BOWLING?
##

Read somewhere that some
body thinks Stanford could go to the
Rose Bowl next year; that is Jan. 1
• —next year.
Fi off. the Indians are a better
team than the Bernie Bierman

coached lowa Pre-Flighters. They
must be, or else how come Noti'e
Dame beat the fliers 28-0, and
Stanford only 27-0? Only one point,
to be sure, but lowa had gone
through four games without a defeat.
The PCC lines up now with UCLA
riding the top with wins over Ore
gon State and California and two
losses to non-conference St. Mary's
Pre-Flight and Texas Christian.

Southern California stacks up next
with a win over Washington State
and a tie to Washington with a non
con loss to Tulane. Washington
statistically is better off, with two
wins over Oregon and Montana and
a tie with the Trojans, but the two
victories are not on par with those
belonging to the Bruins and Trojans.
Stanford, with its one win and one
loss on the conference record, stands
slightly below that of Oregon State,
which holds wins over Cal and Idaho
with a loss to UCLA.
If you want to go Bowling, Stan
ford must handle the rest of its op
ponents with meat hooks.
It's a nice thought, and the air
around Pasadena brings fragrant
memories of a thrilling Nebraska-
Stanford game of two years ago.
Maybe the boys were just over
elated in the dressing room after
I Saturday's game, but a little confi-
I dence never hurt anybody.
ttHAUGHNESSY DUNKEI):
j Clark Shaughnessy's streak at
j Maryland was abruptly ended Satur
day by VMI 29-0.

Read somewhere that some
body thinks Stanford could go to the
Rose Bowl next year; that is Jan. 1
• —next year.
Fi off. the Indians are a better
team than the Bernie Bierman

coached lowa Pre-Flighters. They
must be, or else how come Noti'e
Dame beat the fliers 28-0, and
Stanford only 27-0? Only one point,
to be sure, but lowa had gone
through four games without a defeat.
The PCC lines up now with UCLA
riding the top with wins over Ore
gon State and California and two
losses to non-conference St. Mary's
Pre-Flight and Texas Christian.

Southern California stacks up next
with a win over Washington State
and a tie to Washington with a non
con loss to Tulane. Washington
statistically is better off, with two
wins over Oregon and Montana and
a tie with the Trojans, but the two
victories are not on par with those
belonging to the Bruins and Trojans.
Stanford, with its one win and one
loss on the conference record, stands
slightly below that of Oregon State,
which holds wins over Cal and Idaho
with a loss to UCLA.
If you want to go Bowling, Stan
ford must handle the rest of its op
ponents with meat hooks.
It's a nice thought, and the air
around Pasadena brings fragrant
memories of a thrilling Nebraska-
Stanford game of two years ago.
Maybe the boys were just over
elated in the dressing room after
I Saturday's game, but a little confi-
I dence never hurt anybody.
ttHAUGHNESSY DUNKEI):
j Clark Shaughnessy's streak at
j Maryland was abruptly ended Satur
day by VMI 29-0.
