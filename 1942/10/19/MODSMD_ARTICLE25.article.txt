of San Francisco rivals 27 to 0 be
fore 35,000 fans today in a bitterly
fought contest punctuated by four
fist-fights.

ued to hand the Dons a terrific
drubbing throughout the contest.
Officials were forced to halt the
game four times to break up free
swinging melees between players,
but were unable to pin the blame
on any particular player, and no one
was ejected from the game.

opening kickoff and pounded relent
lessly 70 y,ard.s to the Don five-yard
line before the crumbling U.S.F.
forward wall held on downs. But
Don fullback Fred Shaw was able
to punt out only to his own 33, and
halfback Roy Guisti quickly engi
neered the Gaels into scoring posi
tion again, plunging one yard for
the touchdown. Half Gonzales Mo
rales converted from placement.
Guisti put the Gaels under way
again in the second period, tossing
a 30-yard pass to end Fnrron Brum
frield, who made a leaping catch be
hind the Don secondary and scam
pered 35 yards to pay dirt. Morales
again booted the conversion.
Sl. Mary's continued to drive hard
in the third quarter, punching over
two more touchdowns. Morales
skirted right end and dashed 19
yards for one tally, while end .Jack
Verutti notched the other when he
grabbed sub halfback Jock Gcr
maine's soaring 40-yard pass and
trotted 20 yards more to score.
The Dons, completely outclassed
by the fast-striking St. Mary's line,
were able to penetrate to the Gaels'
35-yard line but once —when tl.ey
fumbled to lose the ball.

The Gaels, incensed over a week
long controversy over the use of
freshman football players by U.S.F.,
quickly pounded out a touchdown
in the opening minutes and contin
ued to hand the Dons a terrific
drubbing throughout the contest.
Officials were forced to halt the
game four times to break up free
swinging melees between players,
but were unable to pin the blame
on any particular player, and no one
was ejected from the game.
St. Mary's took the ball on the
opening kickoff and pounded relent
lessly 70 y,ard.s to the Don five-yard
line before the crumbling U.S.F.
forward wall held on downs. But
Don fullback Fred Shaw was able
to punt out only to his own 33, and
halfback Roy Guisti quickly engi
neered the Gaels into scoring posi
tion again, plunging one yard for
the touchdown. Half Gonzales Mo
rales converted from placement.
Guisti put the Gaels under way
again in the second period, tossing
a 30-yard pass to end Fnrron Brum
frield, who made a leaping catch be
hind the Don secondary and scam
pered 35 yards to pay dirt. Morales
again booted the conversion.
Sl. Mary's continued to drive hard
in the third quarter, punching over
two more touchdowns. Morales
skirted right end and dashed 19
yards for one tally, while end .Jack
Verutti notched the other when he
grabbed sub halfback Jock Gcr
maine's soaring 40-yard pass and
trotted 20 yards more to score.
The Dons, completely outclassed
by the fast-striking St. Mary's line,
were able to penetrate to the Gaels'
35-yard line but once —when tl.ey
fumbled to lose the ball.
