### ED LUCE 
Thrusting at will for huge chunks
of yardage by ground and air, Phi
Psi, El Toro, El Cuadro and Delta
Upsilon rolled to one-sided victories
in the opening round of Farm intra
mural grid competition Friday.
The Phi Psi seven, sparked by the
end play of Howie Dallmar and
Johnny Malloy and the passing of
former frosh back Keith Pinion, had
little trouble taking a 32-0 decision
fro Medical School.
Malloy scored three touchdowns,
two on passes from Pinion and one
on a pass interception, while sub back
Joe Mardesich accounted for Phi Psi's
other two touchdowns on running
plays. Dallmar converted twice from
placement.

way in El Toro's 25-0 win over Los
Arcos. Brown, operating at tailback
in a man-in-motion-single-wing set
up. tallied three times on runs of 30
and 5 yards, and a pass interception
runback of 20.
Toro Passer George Tolman also
I turned in an excellent performance,
j rifling one to Brad Morrison for the
fourth Toro touchdown.
Impressive as Phi Psi's win was,
El Cuadro and Delta Upsilon, also in
League 2, kept pace by turning in
lopsided triumphs.
SIG ALPHS FALL

25-yard marker and sprinting 75

Joe Mignola and Joe Barbieri, Fair
heaved for two touchdowns and
three conversions. Bob Hughey
scored Cuadro's final six points, in
tercepting a S.A.E. pass on his own
25-yard marker and sprinting 75
yards down the sidelines.
Long runs were the trend in DU's
30-0 win over Theta Chi. Terry Coo
nan topped the scoring parade with
two touchdown runs through the
whole Theta Chi team. All other D.U.
counters came on lengthy gallops.
Feature of the day's play was the
sharp blocking turned in by players
on all teams, especially that of Phi
Psi's Bill Nourse and Bill Quacken
bush, and Toro-men Lucian Rice and
Louis Sloss.
Thrusting at will for huge chunks
of yardage by ground and air, Phi
Psi, El Toro, El Cuadro and Delta
Upsilon rolled to one-sided victories
in the opening round of Farm intra
mural grid competition Friday.
The Phi Psi seven, sparked by the
end play of Howie Dallmar and
Johnny Malloy and the passing of
former frosh back Keith Pinion, had
little trouble taking a 32-0 decision
fro Medical School.
Malloy scored three touchdowns,
two on passes from Pinion and one
on a pass interception, while sub back
Joe Mardesich accounted for Phi Psi's
other two touchdowns on running
plays. Dallmar converted twice from
placement.

TOROS WIN, 25-0
Little Carlos Brown showed the
way in El Toro's 25-0 win over Los
Arcos. Brown, operating at tailback
in a man-in-motion-single-wing set
up. tallied three times on runs of 30
and 5 yards, and a pass interception
runback of 20.
Toro Passer George Tolman also
I turned in an excellent performance,
j rifling one to Brad Morrison for the
fourth Toro touchdown.
Impressive as Phi Psi's win was,
El Cuadro and Delta Upsilon, also in
League 2, kept pace by turning in
lopsided triumphs.
SIG ALPHS FALL
The Cuadros, featuring former
I S.F.U. basketballer Bob Fair in a
Sammy Baugh role, drubbed S.A.E.,
