sea Saturday, as the Stanford var
sity and junior varsity water polo
teams defeated the St. Mary's Pre
flight School A and B squads 4 to 2 ,
and 8 to 1 respectively in Encina j
pool.
Despite the fact that the Navy '
men have been in the water for five j
weeks, the Stanford boys, whose j
practices were curtailed by "Hell i
Week" and other campus activities, j
led all the way in both games. The j
varsity held a 2-1 margin at half !
time, and the junior varsity was on ;
the front end of a 4-1 half-time
score.
Both Farm teams were praised ;
for their play by Coach Ernie <
Brandsten.
TEAMWORK TOPS
"Even though we weren't in very
good condition we had an experi
enced bunch whose teamwork is ex
cellent," said Brandsten, who was
particularly impressed with his
team's passing ability.
"We were in enemy territory
most of the time, and the scores
came close to being higher than
they were," he added.

The coach mentioned Captain
Hedley Bacon, Emmett Cashin, and
Dick Narvar as boys whose playing
was especially notable in the varsity
game. In the junior varsity game
he liked Robert (Pete) Hetch, Paul
Egeler, Bud Carpenter and Chet
Newman.
WILL PLAY NAVY
The Indians will challenge the
Navy in its own waters next Sat
urday at Moraga. Games are sched
uled to be played with San Jose
State this Thursday, but Brandsten
has not heard definitely that the
games will be played.
If they are played, he believes
they will be tough, for the Spartans
offered the highly regarded Olympic
Club a strong battle last week.

The Indians will challenge the
Navy in its own waters next Sat
urday at Moraga. Games are sched
uled to be played with San Jose
State this Thursday, but Brandsten
has not heard definitely that the
games will be played.
If they are played, he believes
they will be tough, for the Spartans
offered the highly regarded Olympic
Club a strong battle last week.
The Navy lost a double-header at |
sea Saturday, as the Stanford var
sity and junior varsity water polo
teams defeated the St. Mary's Pre
flight School A and B squads 4 to 2 ,
and 8 to 1 respectively in Encina j
pool.
Despite the fact that the Navy '
men have been in the water for five j
weeks, the Stanford boys, whose j
practices were curtailed by "Hell i
Week" and other campus activities, j
led all the way in both games. The j
varsity held a 2-1 margin at half !
time, and the junior varsity was on ;
the front end of a 4-1 half-time
score.
Both Farm teams were praised ;
for their play by Coach Ernie <
Brandsten.
TEAMWORK TOPS
"Even though we weren't in very
good condition we had an experi
enced bunch whose teamwork is ex
cellent," said Brandsten, who was
particularly impressed with his
team's passing ability.
"We were in enemy territory
most of the time, and the scores
came close to being higher than
they were," he added.

The coach mentioned Captain
Hedley Bacon, Emmett Cashin, and
Dick Narvar as boys whose playing
was especially notable in the varsity
game. In the junior varsity game
he liked Robert (Pete) Hetch, Paul
Egeler, Bud Carpenter and Chet
Newman.
