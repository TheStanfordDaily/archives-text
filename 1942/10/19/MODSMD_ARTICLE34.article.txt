# Opening Quarter Tallies Give Pre-Flighters Win Over Frosh
## 
### 
Two quick thrusts in the first i
quarter by the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
B team proved enough to defeat the
Stanford Freshmen last Saturday
morning, 13-6, in the Stadium be
fore a handful of faithful frosh.
Miller Cameron, flashy halfback
from Kansas University, ran and
passed the ball over, around, and
straight through the frosh through
out the game. He was ably assisted
in the backfield by D. B. Smith,
formerly of the University of Wash
ington.
In the first quarter, with the ball
resting on the frosh 31, Willard Dun
lap took a reverse from Cameron,
swung out toward his own lcit end,
and just when he was tackled, lat
eraled to Smith, who raced to the
score. Carl Merritt converted.
PASSES FOR SCORE
Minutes later, after a sustained
drive, Cameron again set up a
touchdown when he threw a bullet
pass over center into the end zone to
right end Leo Cantwell, who made
a diving catch.
It was not until the fourth quar
ter that the frosh were able to score.
Jack Brownson threw to right half
i back Mark Heffelfinger along the
I Stanford sideline. Heffelfinger was
behind the defender and caught the
j ball over his shoulder and went the
' rest of the way for the score. The
j play was good for G5 yards.
AGNEW REIN JI RED
Bill Agnew, playing his first game
! at halfback for the frosh, re-injured
his leg early in the first quarter,
| and had to be helped off the field.
In the first scrimmage of the year.
Agnew. playing at fullback, injured
his leg and did not play in the Menlo
Junior College game.
Steve Tish was hitting the line
J for consistent gains and looked im

pressivo on his inside end bucks.
Brownson and Jay McKie passed
well, and several times had tosses
that were labeled touchdowns, but
the receivers were never quite able
to handle them.
Homer Hamlin, playing his first
game at right half, showed plenty of
speed and deception on offense and
was more than adequate on defense.
In the line, game-captain Dick
Madigan turned in another good
performance, as did Bill Hachten,
Ed Gunderson, and Bob Rohrer.
Carson Rasmussen and Frank Hef
felfinger played good ball in sub
stituting for Rohrer and Frank Wig
more at ends.
At the present time, no game has
been scheduled for next week.
