# Turkey Leans Toward Allies
## Istanbul Says Nazis Weakened by Losses 
### 
ISTANBUL. Monday, Oct. 19. UP—
The third anniversary of the Turkish
alliance with Britain and France to
day finds Turkey strongly pro-
Allied and convinced that the turn- I
!
ing point of the war in favor of the !
United Nations has been reached, i
diplomatic quarters reported.
These quarters believe that Ger
many, her manpower and morale |
i weakened by losses in Russia, will j
be unable for months to launch an- |
other grand offensive and will at- j
tempt to consolidate Europe as a j
great fortress to withstand Allied as
saults.
Highly placed Germans visiting
in Turkey recently are said to have
admitted to neutral friends that the
"offensive spirit" has faded in the
J Reich and that the bloody losses at
! Stalingrad, even if that city even
t tually falls, will prevent the full
! weight of the Nazi forces from being
thrown into a Caucasus drive against
Batum, Baku and Iran.
j With a "second front" threat di- j
verting German forces to the west
| this winter, it was believed likely that j
! German ambitions for a southward
drive through the Caucasus or
j against Turkey might be ended.
The delicate question of Turkish
i chrome is constantly being consid
i ered by Turkish authorities. Despite i
Turkey's agreement to ship 90,000 !
j tons of the vital metal to Germany !
} beginning next year. Allied diplomats
are confident a plan will be worked
out for Britain and the United States
to continue to receive their share.
