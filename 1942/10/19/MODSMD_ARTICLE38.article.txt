Singing, dancing, and specialty acts |
I for the 1942 Gaieties will be audi
tioned in the main auditorium of the j
War Memorial Theater at 8 tonight, j
Bob O'Neill, director of the 1942
Gaieties, urges everyone who has
ever been told by anyone that they |
could sing, dance, act, or amuse j
people in any way, to try out.
"In the specialty acts we will hear I
everything from magicians to musi- j
cians," stated O'Neill.
BRING OWN MUSIC
Singers are urged to bring their
own music. Solos, or groups from
| two to a dozen, will be heard. This
! applies to any field—singing, dancing
or skits. Short skits which people
have created for their own amuse
ment will also be welcome. "We
want to give everyone a fail
chance," said O'Neill.
Not to be forgotten is the Ram's
Head plaque, given each year to the
organization contributing the most
to the Gaieties, which has been in
| the S.A.E. house since the last two
productions.
RAM'S HEAD JUDGE
Ram's Head, in judging who is to
I receive it, considers every aspect
jof the Gaieties, from writing to
technical work. This plaque itself is
a carved ram's head overlooking a
bronze scroll on which is engraved
the names of the winners of the past
i 10 years.

According to O'Neill, the success
of the show depends largely on the
number trying out, and he stresses
the fact that those with heretofore
hidden talents should come to the
meeting tonight.
