TODAY you may be approached by someone
and asked to sign a petition. Before either
signing or refusing, read the petition and con
sider it closely. It is a petition which calls to
the attention of Chancellor Wilbur the feelings
of Stanford students about the "ruling regarding
the awarding of degrees in a School instead of
in a major subject as has previously been the
case."
The petition which is being circulated is a
"straw vote" to tabulate the feelings of the
students, not a demand to change the opera
tion of the University, nor a stand against the
administration.
If a sufficient number of students sign the
petition, and thus express their interest in the
problem of graduating in a School and not a
major subject, the problem will probably be
reopened at the faculty meeting Tuesday with
some definite idea as to the extent and the feel
ings of the students, and not just the feeling
that a few malcontents are causing trouble. If
an insufficient number sign, the matter will stay
closed as representing the feelings of both
students and faculty.
If you are not approached, and if you have
a strong feeling about receiving a "specialized
degree" from the University, go to the Cellar
between 8 and 12 today and sign.
But before signing your name remember to
read and consider the petition carefully, be
cause to be of any value as a test of student
feeling, it must be the true expression of your
opinion.â€”A1 Hampson
