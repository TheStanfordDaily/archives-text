# Let It Fail
## 
### 
TN the weekly meeting of the Stanford War
-L Board last Thursday night, it was suggested
that the board be reorganized to make it operate
more efficiently, that it cut down its many
committees, and that it better co-ordinate itself.
Like a company in business, the War Board
should fail before being reorganized, and failed
it has not.
The War Board, with its many committees
under the co-ordination, is large, but then it
must be remembered that it has a large job to
do. It handles salvage and fruit picking, the
Blood Bank and U.S.O. and consumer education,
and War Stamps.
To handle these duties, and many more, vital
to Stanford s war effort, the War Board must
have people sincerely interested in their vari
ous divisions, and these the War Board has.
It cannot be too large as long as the people who
make it up are interested in their jobs.
As for its having too many committees, the
same statement holds. Committees like politi
cians are good or bad. Those of the War Board
are good because they are mobile, easily
changed to suit conditions, and above all they
do their job.
Supporting the charge of poor co-ordination
there stands the example of the Stanford men
were turned away from the canneries be
cause there was no labor shortage. This should
not be laid directly at the feet of the War Board,
which was misadvised as to the seriousness
of the labor shortage and did admirably on its
limited information. Later the board investi
gated the problem itself and set up an organi
zation to meet it.
While these many activities are going on, the
War Board has ever been trying to consolidate
and better co-ordinate itself. Divisions have
been combined and the diverse efforts of the
organization are now better co-ordinated. Let
this conciliation and co-ordination increase rath
er than a reorganization take place.
So before the cry for a reorganization grows
loud, let the \AAir Board fail. A1 Hampson

While these many activities are going on, the
War Board has ever been trying to consolidate
and better co-ordinate itself. Divisions have
been combined and the diverse efforts of the
organization are now better co-ordinated. Let

So before the cry for a reorganization grows

TN the weekly meeting of the Stanford War
-L Board last Thursday night, it was suggested
that the board be reorganized to make it operate
more efficiently, that it cut down its many
committees, and that it better co-ordinate itself.
Like a company in business, the War Board
should fail before being reorganized, and failed
it has not.
The War Board, with its many committees
under the co-ordination, is large, but then it
must be remembered that it has a large job to
do. It handles salvage and fruit picking, the
Blood Bank and U.S.O. and consumer education,
and War Stamps.
To handle these duties, and many more, vital
to Stanford s war effort, the War Board must
have people sincerely interested in their vari
ous divisions, and these the War Board has.
It cannot be too large as long as the people who
make it up are interested in their jobs.
As for its having too many committees, the
same statement holds. Committees like politi
cians are good or bad. Those of the War Board
are good because they are mobile, easily
changed to suit conditions, and above all they
do their job.
Supporting the charge of poor co-ordination
there stands the example of the Stanford men
were turned away from the canneries be
cause there was no labor shortage. This should
not be laid directly at the feet of the War Board,
which was misadvised as to the seriousness
of the labor shortage and did admirably on its
limited information. Later the board investi
gated the problem itself and set up an organi
zation to meet it.
