Some weeks ago, the United States carried out
a \ery neat attack on the southern islands of the
Solomon group, an attack well planned and well
executed. Principal strategic advantages to the
United Stales of the seizure of Tulagi, Guadalcanal,
etc., were l l I the protection of the sea-lanes to Aus
tralia, and (21 the potentialities of the Jap-built
air base on Guadalcanal for smashing al the Jap
forces to the north. From the point of view of the
Nipponese, these advantages to the Allies made it
imperative that the Sacred and Imperial Sun rise
again over the Solomons and that quickly.
So it was not difficult for even military experts to
predict that the battle in the Solomons was not
over, and that the second round could be expected
at any time. And the news of the past week has con
firmed their predictions. Large Jap forces have
been landed on Guadalcanal; Jap bombers have at
tacked the air base, named Henderson Field by (he
Marines; a large Jap naval force, a battle fleet, has
been reported in southern waters. Indeed, naval
warfare in that vicinity has been continuous and
whatever the enemy losses have been, we have had
four cruisers sunk.
Our original beach-heads have been expanded
and reinforcements have arrived. Our naval forces
have been strengthened considerably. An all-out
enemy attack has not as yet been opened but the
stage is set. Oflicial statements from Washington are
not over optimistic, and all we can do is abide the
issue.

A couple of weeks ago, 1 wrote a brief sketch of
the situation that might exist after the war between
the Western Allies and Russia. 1 said that Russia
had been one of the aggressor nations until put
on the defensive bv Hitler, and posed the question.
"How can we maintain our principles as expressed
in the Atlantic Charter and yet permit Russia to
keep those portions of non-Russian territory an
nexed by the Soviets in the last few years?" In
other words, would we surrender our principles or
force Russia to restore these territories?
This question provoked considerable comment
here and there and I was involved in controversy
up to my knees. The following points were urged
on me: (1) Russia had It) lake these areas in her
own defense; (2) some of them were Russian be
fore the last war; (3) after occupation, the in
habitants had asked to be annexed to the USSR
by plebiscite. This is all to prove that in the first
place Russia was never an aggressor. The best re
buttal that I can make is that Hitler has excused
some of his Nazi aggression on much the same
grounds. "But, protest my worthy opponents.
"Russia is different." And I concede that Russia
is very different; she is fighting for us and Germany
against us.
We are told by our national leaders that we are
fighting a war for principle, a war to establish law
among the nations. One of the principles we have
published as fundamental is that seizure of territory
by force is never justified. How can we establish a
just and lasting peace if we begin by meekly con
ceding to the Soviets all that they have taken
by force?
As long as nations are guided by their own
immediate interests, without due regard to the
interest of others, there can be no lasting peace.
Therefore, we cannot allow that Russia was right
in seizing parts of Poland, Finland, and Rumania,
and all of Latvia, Lithuania, and Eslhonia. Either
she submits to an international decision on their
future, or she retains them by force. We cannot
leave a job half done.

A couple of weeks ago, 1 wrote a brief sketch of
the situation that might exist after the war between
the Western Allies and Russia. 1 said that Russia
had been one of the aggressor nations until put
on the defensive bv Hitler, and posed the question.
"How can we maintain our principles as expressed
in the Atlantic Charter and yet permit Russia to
keep those portions of non-Russian territory an
nexed by the Soviets in the last few years?" In
other words, would we surrender our principles or
force Russia to restore these territories?
This question provoked considerable comment
here and there and I was involved in controversy
up to my knees. The following points were urged
on me: (1) Russia had It) lake these areas in her
own defense; (2) some of them were Russian be
fore the last war; (3) after occupation, the in
habitants had asked to be annexed to the USSR
by plebiscite. This is all to prove that in the first
place Russia was never an aggressor. The best re
buttal that I can make is that Hitler has excused
some of his Nazi aggression on much the same
grounds. "But, protest my worthy opponents.
"Russia is different." And I concede that Russia
is very different; she is fighting for us and Germany
against us.
We are told by our national leaders that we are
fighting a war for principle, a war to establish law
among the nations. One of the principles we have
published as fundamental is that seizure of territory
by force is never justified. How can we establish a
just and lasting peace if we begin by meekly con
ceding to the Soviets all that they have taken
by force?
As long as nations are guided by their own
immediate interests, without due regard to the
interest of others, there can be no lasting peace.
Therefore, we cannot allow that Russia was right
in seizing parts of Poland, Finland, and Rumania,
and all of Latvia, Lithuania, and Eslhonia. Either
she submits to an international decision on their
future, or she retains them by force. We cannot
leave a job half done.
Some weeks ago, the United States carried out
a \ery neat attack on the southern islands of the
Solomon group, an attack well planned and well
executed. Principal strategic advantages to the
United Stales of the seizure of Tulagi, Guadalcanal,
etc., were l l I the protection of the sea-lanes to Aus
tralia, and (21 the potentialities of the Jap-built
air base on Guadalcanal for smashing al the Jap
forces to the north. From the point of view of the
Nipponese, these advantages to the Allies made it
imperative that the Sacred and Imperial Sun rise
again over the Solomons and that quickly.
So it was not difficult for even military experts to
predict that the battle in the Solomons was not
over, and that the second round could be expected
at any time. And the news of the past week has con
firmed their predictions. Large Jap forces have
been landed on Guadalcanal; Jap bombers have at

the Western Allies and Russia. 1 said that Russia
had been one of the aggressor nations until put
on the defensive bv Hitler, and posed the question.
"How can we maintain our principles as expressed
in the Atlantic Charter and yet permit Russia to
keep those portions of non-Russian territory an
nexed by the Soviets in the last few years?" In
other words, would we surrender our principles or
force Russia to restore these territories?
This question provoked considerable comment
here and there and I was involved in controversy
up to my knees. The following points were urged
on me: (1) Russia had It) lake these areas in her
own defense; (2) some of them were Russian be
fore the last war; (3) after occupation, the in
habitants had asked to be annexed to the USSR
by plebiscite. This is all to prove that in the first
place Russia was never an aggressor. The best re
buttal that I can make is that Hitler has excused
some of his Nazi aggression on much the same
grounds. "But, protest my worthy opponents.
"Russia is different." And I concede that Russia
is very different; she is fighting for us and Germany
against us.
We are told by our national leaders that we are
fighting a war for principle, a war to establish law
among the nations. One of the principles we have
published as fundamental is that seizure of territory
by force is never justified. How can we establish a
just and lasting peace if we begin by meekly con
ceding to the Soviets all that they have taken
by force?
As long as nations are guided by their own
immediate interests, without due regard to the
interest of others, there can be no lasting peace.
Therefore, we cannot allow that Russia was right
in seizing parts of Poland, Finland, and Rumania,
and all of Latvia, Lithuania, and Eslhonia. Either
she submits to an international decision on their
future, or she retains them by force. We cannot
leave a job half done.
