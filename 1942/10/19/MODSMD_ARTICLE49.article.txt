The Editor, Sir:
Last week, during the frivolities which were
occupying the minds of a large proportion of Stan
ford's student body, a group of British seamen
played a soccer game with the varsity and frosli
squads. After the game, the visitors were taken up
to various fraternity houses for dinner.
Five of these young sailors were guests of honor
of one house at which a "program was being
carried out. Although somewhat mystified by the
ways of American college life, they joined in the
fun with considerable enthusiasm.
During the evening, someone remarked to one
of the visitors that "of course these boys were 100
young to go to war." The man to whom the re
mark was made suddenly became quite serious and
replied:
"7 hey wouldn I he too young over there.
Ihe speaker was 1 ( ) years old. It would he in
teresting lo observe what changes would take place
in the average Stanford attitude, if he were as close
to the present world situation as many people are
today.
