# Sea-Bees Build U.S. Bases To Rid South Pacific of Japs
## 
### 
AN ADVANCED U.S. BASE IN
THE SOUTH PACIFIC, Oct. 4 (De
layed)—UP—The Sea-Bees are hard
at work in the South Pacific islands.
They are fighting construction
workers organized by the Navy to
build airparts and installations on the
small islands from which America's
bombers and fighter planes take off
to attack Japanese shipping.
On this island. H. P. (Red) Martin,
a tough Mississippi road builder, is
a foreman of one gang of Sea-Bees.
"We'll build a thousand air fields
if necessary to beat those fellows
and we'll fight alongside the Army
and Navy to hold them, too," he
drawled.
FLYING FORTRESSES
He jerked his thumb toward the
runway where flying fortresses were
roaring off to attack Jap shipping
north of the Solomons.
"Those are the babies that give
them hell," he said, "but we make
it possible for them to get into the
air.
For 17 years Martin worked for
the Mississippi Highway Department.
He is an expert on all types of con
struction. When the war broke out,
he offex-ed his services to the govern
ment.
His first job, he said, was at a sea
plane base on a small island.
"It was a cinch," he said. "Within
a week we put in a clearing and put
in a ramp for the seaplanes."
Then the Sea-Bees tackled the job
of clearing a spot for a main air
field, hacking away trees and jungle
growth, killing snakes and battling
mosquitoes.
TROPICAL RAINSTORMS
The land, when it is cleared, is
like something out on the Mississippi
delta, Martin said, pointing to the
soil.
"The worst job is to arrange drain
age for the tropical rainstorms. It
rains as much as two inches in a very
few minutes. Last night we had a
cloudburst but the water swiftly
drained into prepared channels filled
with coral and almost immediately
afterward the fighter planes were
using the runway to take off. But
just a short distance away in the
jungle the mud is knee deep," Mar
tin said.
One of Martin's assistants is Tom
A. Bowen, a tough, wiry man who
came out here after seven years ex
perience as general superintendent
of WPA construction work at Troy,
N.Y. Both have a Navy rating of
chief petty officer.

"We'll have this field completed
pretty soon now and move on to
another job," Martin said. "Maybe
we'll get to do some fighting if the
Japs ever attack a base where we
are working. But in the meantime
we'll keep those fortresses flying."

chief petty officer.

"We'll have this field completed
pretty soon now and move on to
another job," Martin said. "Maybe
we'll get to do some fighting if the
Japs ever attack a base where we
are working. But in the meantime
we'll keep those fortresses flying."
AN ADVANCED U.S. BASE IN
THE SOUTH PACIFIC, Oct. 4 (De
layed)—UP—The Sea-Bees are hard
at work in the South Pacific islands.
They are fighting construction
workers organized by the Navy to
build airparts and installations on the
small islands from which America's
bombers and fighter planes take off
to attack Japanese shipping.
On this island. H. P. (Red) Martin,
a tough Mississippi road builder, is
a foreman of one gang of Sea-Bees.
"We'll build a thousand air fields
if necessary to beat those fellows
and we'll fight alongside the Army
and Navy to hold them, too," he
drawled.
FLYING FORTRESSES
He jerked his thumb toward the
runway where flying fortresses were
roaring off to attack Jap shipping
north of the Solomons.
"Those are the babies that give
them hell," he said, "but we make
it possible for them to get into the
air.
For 17 years Martin worked for
the Mississippi Highway Department.
He is an expert on all types of con
struction. When the war broke out,
he offex-ed his services to the govern
ment.
His first job, he said, was at a sea
plane base on a small island.
"It was a cinch," he said. "Within
a week we put in a clearing and put
in a ramp for the seaplanes."
Then the Sea-Bees tackled the job
of clearing a spot for a main air
field, hacking away trees and jungle
growth, killing snakes and battling
mosquitoes.
TROPICAL RAINSTORMS
The land, when it is cleared, is
like something out on the Mississippi
delta, Martin said, pointing to the
soil.
"The worst job is to arrange drain
age for the tropical rainstorms. It
rains as much as two inches in a very
few minutes. Last night we had a
cloudburst but the water swiftly
drained into prepared channels filled
with coral and almost immediately
afterward the fighter planes were
using the runway to take off. But
just a short distance away in the
jungle the mud is knee deep," Mar
tin said.
One of Martin's assistants is Tom
A. Bowen, a tough, wiry man who
came out here after seven years ex
perience as general superintendent
of WPA construction work at Troy,
N.Y. Both have a Navy rating of
chief petty officer.
