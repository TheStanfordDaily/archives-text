# Big U.S. Convoy Lands in Africa
## New AEF Menaces French Possessions 
### 
VICHY, Oct. 18, UPâ€”French offi
cials heaved sighs of relief today
when it was officially announced
that the big United States convoy
sighted off Dakar last week had
iinally landed its American troops
at Monrovia, Liberia.
Madrid and Paris newspapers, tak
ing their cue from Berlin and Rome,
had been insisting that an Allied at
tack on Dakar was imminent. The
sighting of the American convoy in
the Atlantic west of the Cape Verde
Islands, had lent credence to these
reports and there was considerable
official and public nervou'sness here.
The presence of a new AEF in
West Africa, however, still consti
tutes, according to French opinion,
a menace to the loyal colonies of
French West and Equatorial Africa.
Liberia and British Sierra Leone to
the north lie as insets on the French
African coast, being surrounded on
the land side by French Guinea and
the French Ivory Coast. Unless the
Americans intend to remain in Li
beria or Sierra Leone as protective
police, the only place they could go
by land would be across French soil.
Liberia's chief value to Americans
is as an air-naval base. Monrovia is
a much poorer port than Free Town,
Sierra Leone, but would make a good
seaplane base.
It gives the Allies a chair of bases
from Bathurst to Free Town, Mon
rovia, Ankra, on the British Gold
Coast. Lagos and Douala, in the
French Cameroons, and Libreville,
in French Gabon. The Cameroons
and Gabon have been in the hands of
the '"Free French" for two years.
