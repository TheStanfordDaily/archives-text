# Second 'Dimes' Drive Tonight
## 
### 
Aficr a record-breaking perform
ance which set a new Farm record
of $131.80 last week, Rally Com
members will visit living groups to
night in the second "Dimes for Di
plomas" drive.
The success of the first try was
largely due to splendid co-operation
by house and hall collection chair
men who had their donations al
ready prepared for the collectors.
Tonight's drive should exceed the
first mark since several houses which
were not visited last week will be
contacted.
Seven living groups made 100 per
cent contributions to the record
total. Phi Gamma Delta, Sigma Nu,
Alpha Tau Omega, the Co-op House,
Medrona, AOPi, Delta Delta Delta,
Delta Gamma, Kappa Kappa Gamma,
Pi Phi, and El Tore gave the strong
est support.
Chairman Ted Barr emphasized
last night that the program will be
even more inclusive this week, with
special care taken to visit groups
which were missed in the first pro
gram.
"Dimes for Diplomas" is a scholar
ship fund designed to provide one
quarter tuition payments for Stan
ford men who enter the service with
only a quarter's work left for a de
gree.
