## 
### 
PORTLAND. Ore., Oct. IS UPâ€”
The policy of the Portland Boiler
makers' Union in turning down
Negroes for membership was scored
today in a sermon by Rev. Richard
M. Steiner, pastor of the Unitarian
Church of Our Fathers, who de
clared disbarment of Negroes a libel
on human nature, democratic insti
tutions and faith in God.
Rev. Steiner, a member of the
selective service board of appeals,
declared he would start voting
against deferment of workers who
could be replaced by Negroes.
