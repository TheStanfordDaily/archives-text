# Dining Halls Director Tells Difficulties of Cellar Service
## 
### 
"The problem of putting the lowly
hamburger on its paper plate is the
same story as the man behind the
man behind the gun," said Miss
Christine Ricker, Director of Dining
Halls, in an interview concerning
the recent uproar caused by the
closure of the Cellar.
Stanford students are still not will
ing to accept the first real sacrifice
to the war which plays a major part
in their social life. However, the
problems which closed the Cellar are
only a fraction of all the difficulties
which face eating groups all over
the campus.
MANY DIFFICULTIES
Reasons for this problem are the
lack of food supply, and delivery;
professional preparation and serv
ice; as well as a shortage of labor to
keep the facilities clean and in con
dition.
Stanford is situated in an area con
centrated with defense centers which
have first access to the food supply.
Food orders are usually not filled,
and the Civilian Proviso limits the
buyers in regard to canned goods and
meat. Because of the shortage of
pickers, fresh fruit and vegetables
are not to be had.
If an order is filled it is rarely de
livered on time. Companies which
formerly delivered every day of the
week, now deliver only twice a week.
OLD COOKS LEAVE
Once the food is in the kitchen the
problem of preparation arises. Pro
fessional hands which once cooked
the food, have now found higher
paying defense jobs. Students have
taken over the work of putting the
food on the table almost entirely.
Hashing is the least of the dining hall
difficulties.
Cleaning up has never been a pop
ular job, and now it presents the
greatest problem of all. Paper plates
have lessened the number of dirty
dishes, but an adept hand is still
needed to run the dish-washing ma
chine. The Cellar must be scrubbed
daily, and constant cleaning and re
pair is necessary to keep it in running
condition. This is true of every cam
pus kitchen.
CLASSES INTERFERE
The whole problem of campus
cleaning will have to be brought to
the students as a civic duty, however,
they are unable to work at the Cel
lar at the times they are particularly
needed because of classes," said Miss
Ricker.
Once the garbage has been emptied
and the cans cleaned, its collection
enters the question. Manuel and his
one truck arc now doing the work
of several drivers and several
trucks.
As the war progresses all these dif
ficulties will increase. It is not just
the question of a soda jerk pouring a

coke behind the counter. The man
agement of a dining hall takes in
numerable experienced hands and a
vast number of supplies.
"Dining halls all over the campus
will continue to the best of their
ability," said Miss Ricker. "In the
meantime the Cellar is remaining
open during the times that it is
needed most."
