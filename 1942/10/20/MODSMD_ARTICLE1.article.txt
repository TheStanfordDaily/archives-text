# War Board Seeks Many Nut Pickers
## Employment Bureau Tells Rancher's Need Of Student Workers 
### 
The War Board has received its
first emergency call since its re
organization last week. Walnut pick
ers neededâ€”men and women.
The call came from the U.S. Em
ployment Bureau which reports
that two walnut ranches need 30
student workers Saturday and Sun
day. Men are equipped with long,
hooked poles to knock walnuts from
the trees, while women are needed
to pick walnuts from the ground.
They are loaded into small fruit
boxes and workers are paid 15 cents
per box. Pickers average about five
boxes an hour.
Volunteers will report to desig
nated representatives of the living
groups, who will relay the list of
names to the War Board.
Several species of walnuts are
grown locally and as soon as the
first crop is harvested, the next crop
will be ripe. Consequently, walnut
pickers will be in demand for a
month or so.
Fifty-five students, including eight
men from Law School, gathered to
matoes this weekend. Buses trans
ported 22 to a Morgan Hill farm, and
33 to a ranch behind Moffett Field.
Betty-Lou Horton set a mark for
Stanford women by filling six to
mato lugs within a few hours. This
practically finishes tomato harvest
ing until next season.
However, a few tomato fields near
Santa Clara are not entirely de
nuded, and workers are needed dur
ing the week, announced Miss Helen
Vincent, Employment Bureau. Vol
unteers are referred to the War
Board.
