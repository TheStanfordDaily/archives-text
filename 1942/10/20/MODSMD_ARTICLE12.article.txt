# SWB, Rallycom Move In on Each Other
## 
### 
Yesterday was a busy day for
Rosemary Cross. Her expanded
War Board luid iust grown too big
for its office, so she trundled her
files, war posters, sub-committees
and a receptionist over to what
was formerly the debaters' room.
It is located in the Union, up the
hall from the old War Board suite.
No sooner had the SWB evacu
ated, than Jim Mc√ürier and his
Rally Committee moved in. To
make the cycle complete, Jim Fro
lick and bis elocutionists bundled
their trophies down the hall into
the old Rally Com office. All
three offices are on the Union's
second floor.
