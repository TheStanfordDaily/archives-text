# Action on Draft Bill Postponed
## No-Liquor Proposal Looms for New Bill 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (U.R)-A
proposal to amend the Senate's
pending 'teen-age draft bill by es
tablishing prohibition in areas near
military posts probably will be
adopted if "it gets to a roll call vote,"
Senate Democratic Leader Alben W.
Barkley said today.
He made this prediction after an
nouncing the chamber will not take
up the bill to lower the draft age to
18 until Thursday as a concession to
Senators who left the capital on the
understanding that no important
legislation would be passed during
their absence.
The proposal, previously turned
down by the Senate Military Af
fairs Committee, would prohibit
sale, possession, use or gift of all
alcoholic beverages, including beer,
in Army and Navy posts and within
surrounding areas designated by the
Secretary of War.
The 'teen-age draft bill—similar
to the one passed by the House Sat
urday—also brought a proposal from
Sen. Arthur H. Vandenberg (R„
Mich.) to amend the Constitution
so that the legal voting age—now 21
—be reduced to coincide with the
lowered draft age.
"If young men are to be drafted to
fight for the government," he de
clared, "they ought to be given a
say in the kind of government they
want to fight for."
