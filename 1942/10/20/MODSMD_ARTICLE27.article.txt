WASHINGTON, Oct. 19 (U.R) —
American, warships,, joining. th<-
battle of Guadalcanal, have bon)
barded enemy positions on that key
island and the vital airfield there is
still in American hands, the Navy
disclosed tonight.
It is revealed that 33 more enemy
planes have been destroyed by far
ranging American fliers, 19 of them
over Henderson field—the main
prize sought by the Japanese in
their new attempt to recapture lost
positions in the Southeasterly Solo
mons.
FIELD STILL IN USE
Target of a heavy sea and air
bombardment last week, the field
still was in use as recently as Sat
urday (Washington time) by the
Americans who intercepted a wave
of 20 Jap bombers and 20 fighters
and shot down 19 of them—eight
bombers and 11 Zeros.
A Navy communique also con
tained the encouraging news that
"no recent troop activity or enemy
landings on Guadalcanal have been
reported" in the area where the Japs
have concentrated a large invasion
force.
INSTALLATIONS SHELLED
It also reported that Japanese
warships again shelled American
shore installations—presumably the
air field—last Friday night (Wash
ington time) a few hours before the
wave of 40 enemy planes was cut
in half.
The communique was the most
encouraging since the Japs moved
down in force on the island last
week. But it was still too early to
determine the outcome of the strug
gle since the American and Jap war
ships and land forces apparently had
not yet joined in a major battle.
The action by the American war
ships was the first reported since
the enemy, backed by a formidable
naval force that included battleships
and cruisers, launched his big push
last Monday.
U.S. VESSELS ACTIVE
The U.S. surface vessels laid down
a barrage against war positions on
the northwestern tip of Guadalcanal.
They scored hits on enemy ammuni
tion dumps. Heavy explosions and
fires followed. This heartening news
indicated the Jap navy does not con
trol the sea in the Solomons area.
