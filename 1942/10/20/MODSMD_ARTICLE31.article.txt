.;,i I «ff Patin Drive set back among the trees is a building that began
over 60 years ago because of a young boy's hobby of collecting historical
relies and today stands as a memorial to his profound interest and to the
unselfish devotion of his parents. +

The Leland Stanford Junior Mu
seuir. built in 1891 by Gov. and Mrs.
Stanford in memory of their son
who died seven years before, was
the first re-inforced concrete build
ing in the United States. During the
earthquake of 1906 it was one of
two buildings on the campus that
remained intact, though several
priceless collections of Egyptian pot-
In y were destroyed.
I t: YPI lAN COLLECTION
Housing art and historical relics
from every country in the world
the Museum boasts of three par
ticularly unique and valuable col
lodions. One collection from an
cient Egypt includes pottery, hiero
glyphic tablets, and genuine mum
mies. Another group consists of
priceless oriental antiques including
rare porcelain and jade.
following the deaths of her son
r;nd husband Mrs. Stanford began
Iter world tours where she collected
most of the museum's art objects.
She visited Tibet, India, Russia, and
many of the countries in the Middle
East buying priceless treasures as
.she went. It was on her return trip
from Japan in 1905 that she was
.suddenly taken ill and died in Hono
lulu.
05.5) LOCOMOTIVE
One of the most popular exhibits
in the museum, according to the
( urate, is the 80-year-old Central
Pacific locomotive. An entire wall
of the museum was knocked out in
order to get the engine in and, com
plete in every detail, it occupies a
whole room.
The personal Stanford family col
lection on the second floor affords
;i fascinating study of the life and
history of one of California's great
families. Dresses worn by Mrs. Stan
ford at inaugurations and state
functions are preserved in glass
cases as well as personal letters she
received from Mrs. Benjamin Har
rison, Mrs. Grover Cleveland, and
M»s. Ulysses Grant.
RACING TROPHIES
Also preserved in this collection
are the racing colors and trophies
won by Gov. Stanford's stables. The
ears of Palo Alto, one of his greatest
race horses, are mounted in one of
Ihe cases, as well as a statue of
Electioneer, another great horse.

Though all the exhibits of the
Museum are open to the public, sev
eral science departments have taken
over one wing and the basement for
their private collections. Geological
and zoological specimens are now
housed in the museum for the bene
fit of science students and professors.
MANY NEW DONATIONS
The main collections are by no
means completed, according to mu
seum officials. Private collections
are constantly being donated or
loaned.
The Stanford Museum is indeed an
object of pride and magnificence on
the campus. It is a monument to
the University's history and tradi
tion. as well as to the great civiliza
tions of the world.
