### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Oct. 19 (UP).
â€”Gulifornia will become the cen
ter of the post-war rubber growing
industry. L. A. McQueen vice-pres
ident of General Rubber Company,
predicted today.
"Hundreds of thousands of acres
of guayule will be planted in Cali
fornia instead of the 600 growing
last March," McQueen said.
Proof of the government's faith in
the production of guayule in Cali
fornia was evident, McQueen said,
in the 570.000.000 appropriation for
next year.
He said 132.000 pounds of seed
would be planted in January and
would be ready for harvest by the
fall of 1044.
