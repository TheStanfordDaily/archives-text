## Sammy Lee To Headline 'Aquacade' 
### BOB SONTAG 
Headlined by Sammy Lee, the
"world's greatest springboard and
high diver," swimming Coach Ernie
Brandsten has wrapped up a bundle
of aquatic extravaganza that will
make heads swim and hearts thrill
on the afternoon of Oct. 30 at the
Encina pools.
For Army and Navy relief Brand
sten has lined up a show that in
cludes the sensational Korean diver,
along with national champions right
here at Stanford in the persons of
Brenda Helser, Marjorie Gestring,
Jim Gamble, and Emmett Cashin.
Kin CROSS TAKES PART
Splashed in with the swimming
stars will be a pair of snappy dem
onstrations, one by the Stanford Red
Cross in life saving technique, the
other by the aquatics division of the
St. Mary's Aviation Pre - Flight
School. Top that off with a quick
water polo match featuring the Stan
lord first and second teams in a real
grudge match and a waterfin show
ing by the four fastest Cardinal
sprinters, and you've got more than
a mouthful of entertainment and in
struction.
Sammy Lee, 19-year-old young
ster who cavorts from the high tower
with the ease and grace of a bird,
is coming especially for the show
from Occidental College.
OCCIDENTAL STAR
Lee won the NCAA springboard
diving championship this year and is
the American record holder in both
low and high-board departments.
Brandsten, who has coached many
Olympic divers, thinks of Lee as the
best of 'em all. Aside from the reg
ulation dives. Lee makes a specialty
of "specialty" dives.
He is one of the few men now in
competition who can execute a 3V2
from both the springboards and
tower. That's a forward somersault
Ihree and a half times, brother, and
he can do a 2V2 back somersault
from either board.
You'll be amazed to see him do a
2M> forward somersault in two sec
tions, stopping in the middle of the
first pike position and ending in a
tuck.
GESTRING DIVES
Miss Gestring, who gave up her
strenuous diving activities on enter
ing Stanford was Olympic spring
board champion in 1936 and Amer
ican champion in both 10-foot and
high boards in 1937, 38, and 40. Last
summer she appeared in many ex
hibitions and practiced at Santa
Barbara.
Miss Helser, Stanford freshman,
is the American half-mile titlist and
swims during the summer for the
Multnomah Athletic Club in Port
land.
Gamble is the American freshman
and varsity holder of the 50-yard
freestyle—time 23.3—fastest ever re
corded. Cashin, among other things,
is' the Pacific Coast Conference
champ in distance events.
DURABLE RUBBER RAFTS
The St. Mary's Pre-Flighters will
bring one of the collapsible rubber
rafts of the same type in which three
Navy men recently completed a
3000-mile trip to land after they
were forced to abandon their plane
for lack of fuel.

Admission to Stanford students
and all high school and grammar
school student body card holders
will be 25 cents. Adults will be
charged 50 cents and absolutely no
complimentary tickets will be given.
Only those who actually participate

Sammy Lee, 19-year-old young

with the ease and grace of a bird,
is coming especially for the show
from Occidental College.
OCCIDENTAL STAR
Lee won the NCAA springboard
diving championship this year and is
the American record holder in both
low and high-board departments.
Brandsten, who has coached many
Olympic divers, thinks of Lee as the
best of 'em all. Aside from the reg
ulation dives. Lee makes a specialty
of "specialty" dives.
He is one of the few men now in
competition who can execute a 3V2
from both the springboards and
tower. That's a forward somersault
Ihree and a half times, brother, and
he can do a 2V2 back somersault
from either board.
You'll be amazed to see him do a
2M> forward somersault in two sec
tions, stopping in the middle of the
first pike position and ending in a
tuck.
GESTRING DIVES
Miss Gestring, who gave up her
strenuous diving activities on enter

DURABLE RUBBER RAFTS
The St. Mary's Pre-Flighters will
