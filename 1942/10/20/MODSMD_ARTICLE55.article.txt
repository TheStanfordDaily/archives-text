# A 						Bad Tradition
## 
### 
FRESHMEN are funny people. Their minds
are far more complex than those of the
upper classmen—at least the workings of their
minds are more exposed to the public.
To use the present class as an example, Wed
nesday night some very energetic first-year
men conceived the idea of having a freshman
rally for Saturday's frosh football game. After
working up a lot of steam and excitement, the
idea went over in a big way. We thought then
that we had the makings of a very lively and
very valuable freshman class.
Then reports came into the Daily office about
certain Encinamen who swear at passers-by
from secluded windows high above the street.
This made us wonder whether this class is such
a good one or not. Now we are inclined to be
lieve that this class has either been vastly over
rated or sabotaged by a few of its members.
Before we support this argument, we wish to
point out that that we don't want to make "sis
sies" out of our under classmen, but we do want
to make them realize that swearing out of En
cina windows—or any other windows—should
be discouraged as "conduct unbecoming a
Stanford man."
1. The matter of good taste should be con
sidered. Those Encinamen who have the habit
of swearing out of their windows every time
smoeone yells at them should put themselves
in the position any woman would be in when
she hears this kind of language.
2. Encinamen are misinformed. It is not true
that it is a necessary tradition to yell back at
thsoe who love to taunt the men who live in
Encina.
3. This practice puts Encinamen and Stanford
in a bad light. When we have crowds at our
football games, many persons have to park by
Encina. Many of the citizens of Palo Alto who
attend the Tuesday Evening Series have to park
there, also. They don't like to come to Stanford
to hear a bunch of rowdy frosh swear.

We believe that the most serious of these of
fenders are those fellows whose parents live
many miles from Stanford. They are quite sure
that they won't embarrass any of their rela
tives, but they don't seem to care about the
other fellow's girl, sister, or mother.

It isn't too much of a matter of honor to let
a little "To hell with '46" go by unanswered.

Encina.
3. This practice puts Encinamen and Stanford
in a bad light. When we have crowds at our
football games, many persons have to park by
Encina. Many of the citizens of Palo Alto who
attend the Tuesday Evening Series have to park
there, also. They don't like to come to Stanford
to hear a bunch of rowdy frosh swear.

We believe that the most serious of these of
fenders are those fellows whose parents live
many miles from Stanford. They are quite sure
that they won't embarrass any of their rela
tives, but they don't seem to care about the
other fellow's girl, sister, or mother.

It isn't too much of a matter of honor to let
a little "To hell with '46" go by unanswered.
FRESHMEN are funny people. Their minds
are far more complex than those of the
upper classmen—at least the workings of their
minds are more exposed to the public.
To use the present class as an example, Wed
nesday night some very energetic first-year
men conceived the idea of having a freshman
rally for Saturday's frosh football game. After
working up a lot of steam and excitement, the
idea went over in a big way. We thought then
that we had the makings of a very lively and
very valuable freshman class.
Then reports came into the Daily office about
certain Encinamen who swear at passers-by
from secluded windows high above the street.
This made us wonder whether this class is such
a good one or not. Now we are inclined to be
lieve that this class has either been vastly over
rated or sabotaged by a few of its members.
Before we support this argument, we wish to
point out that that we don't want to make "sis
sies" out of our under classmen, but we do want
to make them realize that swearing out of En
cina windows—or any other windows—should
be discouraged as "conduct unbecoming a
Stanford man."
1. The matter of good taste should be con
sidered. Those Encinamen who have the habit
of swearing out of their windows every time
smoeone yells at them should put themselves
in the position any woman would be in when
she hears this kind of language.
2. Encinamen are misinformed. It is not true
that it is a necessary tradition to yell back at
thsoe who love to taunt the men who live in
Encina.
