# Hail Fraternity
## 
### 
WE hope the fraternities enjoyed their last
Hell Week for the duration. We hope the
pledges got plenty tired, and we hope they
could all take their punishment. Then we hope
they got initiated and learned all about their
fraternity.

This was to be one week-end of work and
sleep and study for the pledges. How much
uninterrupted sleep and study did they get?
That would be hard to determine, but it would
throw a lot of interesting light on some of the
houses.
In about two months how many pledges will
be able to look at those grades in amazement
and say, "I got all of those good grades because
I went through Hell Week"?
But it isn't a good idea to howl about some
thing after it has happened. The days of Hell
Week have passed out of the picture, and with
the passing of Hell Week will be the drifting
away from school of many good fraternity men
who found that their grades weren't good
enough for Army reguirements.

It will take the fraternities until the begin
ning of next guarter to realize that they lost
some good investments just because they didn't
choose to follow the constructive suggestions
outlined by Dr. Wilbur in his speech just be
fore the beginning of Hell Week.
