Why are we fighting Germany? Because it would
not he possible to live on the same planet with
the Nazis unless we fought them or joined them.
The United States has known of cities under gang
ster domination, hut Germany presents the spec
tacle of a whole nation taken over by a "mob."
And we insult American gangsters by comparing
them with Hitler s outfit.
A government such as Hitler's requires constant
agitation to justify its existence. The people, liter
ally. must not be given time to think. New organi
zations, with meetings, rituals, and other foofaraw,
are set up, and these keep the populace occupied
for a while. Then internal danger is announced
and attacked. I And the pogroms instituted by the
Nazis under this head are not the lightest charges
in the indictment humanity is preparing against
them.) Eventually the Jews are all dead, or in con
centration camps, worse than dead. So the only
object left to attack is a foreign nation, a small one,
for choice. One by one the small nations are swal
lowed up, and they must progress to larger and
larger nations.

Remember, they cannot stop! There must always
be some new danger, some emergency to justify the
existence of the New Order. Once war opened with
Lngland, the INazis had to fight arid keep fighting.
If we had not come in when we did. they might have
won. and as we were told, we might well have been
next. If we were not attacked directly, we would
have been so entangled, according to "Mein
Kampf, that we could only submit.
In their progress from nation to nation, the Nazis
came face to face and gun to gun with Great Brit
ain and then Russia. It was far better for the
I nited States to join with two valiant allies, than
to meet the enemy alone, and, acting on the excuse
the Japanese provided at Pearl Harbor, that we did.
I hose are some of the reasons.

Why are we fighting Germany? Because it would

the Nazis unless we fought them or joined them.
The United States has known of cities under gang
ster domination, hut Germany presents the spec
tacle of a whole nation taken over by a "mob."
And we insult American gangsters by comparing
them with Hitler s outfit.
A government such as Hitler's requires constant
agitation to justify its existence. The people, liter
ally. must not be given time to think. New organi
zations, with meetings, rituals, and other foofaraw,
are set up, and these keep the populace occupied
for a while. Then internal danger is announced
and attacked. I And the pogroms instituted by the
Nazis under this head are not the lightest charges
in the indictment humanity is preparing against
them.) Eventually the Jews are all dead, or in con
centration camps, worse than dead. So the only
object left to attack is a foreign nation, a small one,
for choice. One by one the small nations are swal
lowed up, and they must progress to larger and
larger nations.

Remember, they cannot stop! There must always
be some new danger, some emergency to justify the
existence of the New Order. Once war opened with
Lngland, the INazis had to fight arid keep fighting.
If we had not come in when we did. they might have
