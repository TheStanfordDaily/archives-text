# BULL SESSION

### Bill Steif 
just sitting in a room on the third floor above
the Cellar and looking down, I suddenly decided
what 1 have suspected for a long time. Stanford is

a charming place.
I'or instance: down there just standing still were
the trees. Astounding deduction, you say. Well,
no exactly, but there they were, quite big and mostly
green and a couple of them getting red and yellow
on top and most of them dropping their leaves.
The grass was temptingly green, too. I felt like
walking down there and lying on it. Then there
is that wooden sign saying "The Cellar, Lunch,
etc., ' which looked fine hanging from the green
lamp-post. Also, there were the bushes and the
wide, grey, patched-up street. But those are all
static for instances.

The dynamic for instances were even finer.
1 here were lots of well-scrubbed young men walk
ing past the corner. Most of them had books and
they ambled along either singly or in twos and

threes talking. 'I hey had long strides and infor
mality. Ihe young women were pretty, too. Yes,
they really were. Most of them were wearing sweat
ers and skirts (those that weren't were wearing
dresses) and these sweater-skirt combos were all
different colors like white plus navy blue and tan
plus red and Scotch plaid plus yellow. Very, very
nice.
for instance there were professors, also, and
even they looked nice and human and were smiling
some. Ihe Dean of the School of Humanities and
one of the history department's leading lights rode
by 011 bicycles. They were going at a leisurely pace
and almost exemplified that easy goodness which
I like to see in people. Other people on bicycles
pedaled by and some cars, old, new, and indifferent,
drove along. In a shiny green convertible was a
blond young man with a pair of the laughingest
eyes 1 have ever seen.
These are all little things that made me decide
that Stanford is a charming place, indeed, a very
wonderful place. Naturally, there are things you
or I don t like about it. Certain conservatisms here
are, perhaps, deplorable. Certain snobberies and
squeamishnesses are deplorable. The Cellar's clos
ing at 8 p.m. might be remedied. Some classes
might be undulled.
But just the same, this is a pretty fine spot. That
is largely an emotion on my part, but it's legitimate.
I think. And I think the Senator and his Mrs. would
be pretty happy about their Farm, 100, if the\ could
see it today.

eyes 1 have ever seen.
These are all little things that made me decide
that Stanford is a charming place, indeed, a very
wonderful place. Naturally, there are things you
or I don t like about it. Certain conservatisms here
are, perhaps, deplorable. Certain snobberies and
squeamishnesses are deplorable. The Cellar's clos
ing at 8 p.m. might be remedied. Some classes
might be undulled.
But just the same, this is a pretty fine spot. That
is largely an emotion on my part, but it's legitimate.
I think. And I think the Senator and his Mrs. would
be pretty happy about their Farm, 100, if the\ could
see it today.
just sitting in a room on the third floor above
the Cellar and looking down, I suddenly decided
what 1 have suspected for a long time. Stanford is

a charming place.
I'or instance: down there just standing still were
the trees. Astounding deduction, you say. Well,
no exactly, but there they were, quite big and mostly
green and a couple of them getting red and yellow
on top and most of them dropping their leaves.
The grass was temptingly green, too. I felt like
walking down there and lying on it. Then there
is that wooden sign saying "The Cellar, Lunch,
etc., ' which looked fine hanging from the green
lamp-post. Also, there were the bushes and the
wide, grey, patched-up street. But those are all
static for instances.

The dynamic for instances were even finer.
1 here were lots of well-scrubbed young men walk
ing past the corner. Most of them had books and
they ambled along either singly or in twos and

threes talking. 'I hey had long strides and infor
mality. Ihe young women were pretty, too. Yes,
they really were. Most of them were wearing sweat
ers and skirts (those that weren't were wearing
dresses) and these sweater-skirt combos were all
different colors like white plus navy blue and tan
plus red and Scotch plaid plus yellow. Very, very
nice.
for instance there were professors, also, and
even they looked nice and human and were smiling
some. Ihe Dean of the School of Humanities and
one of the history department's leading lights rode
by 011 bicycles. They were going at a leisurely pace
and almost exemplified that easy goodness which
I like to see in people. Other people on bicycles
pedaled by and some cars, old, new, and indifferent,
drove along. In a shiny green convertible was a
blond young man with a pair of the laughingest
eyes 1 have ever seen.
