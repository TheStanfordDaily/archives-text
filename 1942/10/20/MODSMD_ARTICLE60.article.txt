# No Hold Barred In Movie Exploiting Gable, Turner
## 
### 
"Somewhere I'll Find You," starring Clark Gable and Lana Turner, now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
The sexiest show ever to play in the thriving little town of Palo Alto,
not even barring the Gaieties, is now scorching the screen and melting the
audiences at the Stanford.

Hays must have taken the day off
to play golf the afternoon they cen
sored this one.

The love scenes between Gable
and Turner are passionate, torrid,
sexy, and completely uninhibited.
In between the necking (there was
very little in-between, it was mostly
necking) the script writers man
aged to cook up some of the juciest
double-meaning dialogue it has ever
been our immense pleasure to hear.

There is a plot. You'll never notice
it, but there is a plot. The story
casts Gable as a smooth, fast-talking
foreign correspondent who has a
way (jeez, what a way!) with wom
en. Turner is the girl friend of his
brother, played by competent Bob
Sterling. As soon as Turner crosses
Gable's path, the fun starts and
keeps going from there on in.

Along toward the end of the film,
the trio wander off to the more tor
rid .setting of mysterious China and
its conflict with Japan. Then along
comes Dec. 7 (Dec. 7 manages to
come along in just about every film
they make these days). The Japs
conveniently knock off the brother,
who had been getting in the way,
leaving Turner to Gable and vice
versa.
Then comes a little propaganda
and one of the most abrupt endings
we've ever seen. They must have
run out of film. Or else Gable and
Turner got tired of necking. They
probably ran out of film.
If you like your shows on the red
hot side, see this one. It has the
Follies and the Liberty beat a mile.
The other picture on the bill is
"Fly by Night," with Richard Carl
son and Nancy Kelly, a B mystery
that turned out surprisingly well.
