# Car Owners Told Of Gas Economy
## 
### 
Suggestions for increasing the
number of miles they can get to a
gallon were given car owners yes
terday by the California State Auto
mobile Association.

Gasoline mileage will be lowered
considerably when driving is re
duced to short trips, the association
stated.

Frequent starts and stops, use of
automatic or manual choke, and
idling at traffic signals were said to
waste fuel and lower the average
number of miles per gallon.

Accurate knowledge of fuel mile
age will be necessary in planning
for restricted use of a car under
gasoline rationing, it was pointed
out. To check gasoline mileage, the
association suggested filling the tank
up to the filler spout, recording the
speedometer reading, and when gas
oline is needed again checking the
speedometer to determine miles trav
eled and noting the number of gal
lons required to fill the tank again
to the same point. The mileage per
gallon is found by dividing the
number of miles by the number of
gallons used.
