# Historian To Show Ancient Collection
## 
### 
A famous collection of European
and American garments, "Men's
Fashions Throug (he Ages," owned
by a New York historian, Charles
Lederman, is now being shown in
San Francisco for the first time.

This exhibit, which is being shown
at Hastings', discloses the fact that
men took the leading part in fash
ions rather than women of the past.
This exhibit shows that men not
only wore clothing as a body cover
ing but also to show their taste, in
dividuality, and position in life.
