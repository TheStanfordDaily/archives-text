# Davis Lauds Quad Bicycle Cooperation
## 
### 
Police Chief Gordon R. Davis has
announced that students are co
operating more fully with the re
quest to keep their bikes off the
Quad. The arcades and walks are
being cleared of bikes. However,
he says the situation is not perfect
and a continued effort must be made
to keep the Quad clear of bikes.

An effort has been made to pro
cure additional racks. These racks
are on order, but due to wartime
transportation conditions there will
be some delay in delivery. Also a
survey is being made to determine
the point where there is heaviest
congestion.

In the meantime cyclists are asked
to bear with the existing situation
and park their bikes near the racks
which are located at strategic points
near the Quad.

The practice of riding on running
boards is disappearing. Here, too,
there is room for improvement.
Riders' and drivers' attention is again
called to the fact that this practice
is forbidden by state law. More
care is being exercised by motorists
and passengers concerning the over
loading of cars, but there are still a
few which continue to carry over
capacity loads.

General traffic conditions are
favorable, Davis states, and he ap
preciates the co-operation students
have given. Nevertheless, an effort
must be made to keep up the good
work.
