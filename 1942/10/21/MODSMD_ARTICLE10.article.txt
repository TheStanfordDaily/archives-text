# Plans Made For SC Rally
## 
### 
The annual Pajamarino Rally will
begin tomorrow night at 7:15 with
the traditional march of the pajama
clad freshmen starting at the Fiji
house and moving down the row
into the pavilion where the USC
rally will be held.
Led by the Stanford band, the
freshmen will arrive at the pavilion
at 7:30. Filling the floor between the
upperclassmen and women, they will
sit for a program of yells, speeches,
and skits prepared by Bob Ashley
and Pat George for the USC game
Saturday. The program will feature
president and grid star Ed Stamm.
After the rally the boys from En
cina will proceed by any means at
hand to Roble where with the aid of
the band they will serenade the girls
in the freshman hall. Usually this is
an occasion for a race between the
men and women of the freshman
class to see who can get to Roble
first.
After the serenade there will be
a free show for the pajama-clad
frosh down at the Varsity Theater.
No one will be admitted who is not
in pajamas.
