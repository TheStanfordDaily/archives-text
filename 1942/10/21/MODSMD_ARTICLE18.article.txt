## 
### 

THIS IS TIIE STRATEGIC Guadalcanal air base U.S. Marines and
Army forces are holding- from the newest Jap onslaughts. Captured
from the Nipponese when nearly completed, the flying field has proved
an effective jumping off point for American fighting and bombing
planes which have been blasting enemy invasion units trying to regain
lost territory in the Solomons.
