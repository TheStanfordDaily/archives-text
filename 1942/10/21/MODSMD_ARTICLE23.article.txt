# Page Mill Men To Have Dance
## 
### 
Saturday evening a group of 75
girls will entertain at a dance at
Page Mill Road. The dance will be
sponsored by the Palo Alto U.S.O.
and hostesses will be selected from
volunteer lists circulated by living
group representatives.
"We hope that volunteers will re
alize the importance of attending any
functions for which they have of
fered their services," said Virginia
Kirkland, campus USO head. "The
success of the Stanford USO will
depend on the co-operation of every
one."
Campus women who have signed
up to help or who are interested in
volunteering will meet Monday at
2:15 in the auditorium of the Wom
en's Clubhouse.
Because an estimate of available
girls has not been made, all women
who have signed up on volunteer
lists are asked to contact Pat Thures
son if they are unable to attend the
Monday meeting. Mrs. Hoagland,
Palo Alto USO representative will
speak. June Ellis will discuss the
duties of the Junior Hostesses who
are to assist campus women in home
entertainment for the soldiers. Vir
ginia Kirkland will outline the gen
eral organization plans for an ex
tensive program through the co
operation of Stanford and Palo Alto
chapters.
