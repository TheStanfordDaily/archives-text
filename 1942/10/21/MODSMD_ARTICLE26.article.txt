# Congress Sends FDR Unprecedented Tax Bill For 10 Billion Revenue
## New Victory Tax Put on Incomes Over $12 a Week 
### 
The largest revenue bill in history—
designed to increase the govern
ment's income by $59,724,200,000 a
year through unprecedented taxes
on individuals and corporations —
was passed hy Congress today and
sent to the White House.
The huge measure, which calls for
a new 5 per cent "Victory Tax" on
individual earnings over $12 a week
as well as increases in regular indi
vidual income and corporation levies,
was made ready for the President's
signature when the House, and then
the Senate, speedily approved a
conference report on a compromise
bill.
TWO DISSENTING VOTES
The House accepted the measure
by a standing vote of 130 to 2, with
Reps. John Robison (R., Ky.), and
Carl Hinshaw (R., Calif.), the only
dissenters. Senate action was by
voice vote.
Mr. Roosevelt said he expected to
sign the bill before midnight to
morrow so new, increased excise
taxes can become effective Nov. 1.
If his signature is delayed beyond
that time the levies will not become
operative for another month, thereby
depriving the government of some
$20,000,000.
Chairman Walter F. George (D.,
Ga.), of the Senate Finance Com
mittee estimated the gross yield of
the bill at $9,724,200,000 and the net.
yield at $7,951,500,000 after deduc
tion of revenues earmarked for re
turn to individuals and corporations
as tax credits or post war refunds.
The Treasury estimates the net yield
at about $6,881,800,000.
MORE FROM INDIVIDUALS
Approximately two-thirds of the
new revenues will come from indi
viduals, with total taxes for persons
in the lower and middle-income
brackets to be multiplied many times
as compared to present levels.
The bill alnd its staggering tax
load thus will drive home to the pub
lic as never before the gigantic costs
of the global war.
The measure reduced income lax
exemptions from $1500 to $1200 for
married couples and from $750 to
$500 for single persons. The deduc
tions for dependents is lowered from
$400 to $350.
The net effect will be that 44,-
000,000 persons will pay federal
taxes as against 27,000,000 now.

new revenues will come from indi
viduals, with total taxes for persons
in the lower and middle-income
brackets to be multiplied many times
as compared to present levels.
The bill alnd its staggering tax
load thus will drive home to the pub
lic as never before the gigantic costs
of the global war.
The measure reduced income lax
exemptions from $1500 to $1200 for
married couples and from $750 to
$500 for single persons. The deduc
tions for dependents is lowered from
$400 to $350.
The net effect will be that 44,-
000,000 persons will pay federal
taxes as against 27,000,000 now.

The largest revenue bill in history—
designed to increase the govern
ment's income by $59,724,200,000 a
year through unprecedented taxes
on individuals and corporations —
was passed hy Congress today and
sent to the White House.
The huge measure, which calls for
a new 5 per cent "Victory Tax" on
individual earnings over $12 a week
as well as increases in regular indi
vidual income and corporation levies,
was made ready for the President's
signature when the House, and then
the Senate, speedily approved a
conference report on a compromise
bill.
TWO DISSENTING VOTES
The House accepted the measure
by a standing vote of 130 to 2, with
Reps. John Robison (R., Ky.), and
Carl Hinshaw (R., Calif.), the only
dissenters. Senate action was by
voice vote.
Mr. Roosevelt said he expected to
sign the bill before midnight to
morrow so new, increased excise
taxes can become effective Nov. 1.
If his signature is delayed beyond
that time the levies will not become
operative for another month, thereby
depriving the government of some
$20,000,000.
Chairman Walter F. George (D.,
Ga.), of the Senate Finance Com
mittee estimated the gross yield of
the bill at $9,724,200,000 and the net.

tion of revenues earmarked for re
turn to individuals and corporations
as tax credits or post war refunds.
