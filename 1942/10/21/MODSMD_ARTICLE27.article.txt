WASHINGTON, Oct. 20 (U.R)
American airmen continue to ham
mer away at Jap troop and supply
concentrations on Guadalcanal, the
Navy reported tonight in a com
munique which also said "large
numbers" of Jap warships still are
massed in the Solomons area but
there have been no further enemy
landings.
It said there had been no report
of a land offensive by enemy troops
which were put ashore on Guadal
canal last week in the opening phase
of a big Japanese drive to recapturc
lost bases in the Solomons.
The communique was issued a few
hours after Secretary of the N;ivy
Frank Knox told a press conference
the Japs have not yet swung thrir
big punch in the battle of the Solo
mons, which "is still a good, stiff
hard fight."
The blows apparently are aimed at
preventing the enemy from consoli
dating for a major land assault on
Ihe key island and at disrupting the
Jap time-table of attack.
