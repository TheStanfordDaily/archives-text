# Grade School Boy Earns Top Honors in Scrap Drive
## 
### 
Top honors in the scrap metal drive for Stanford and the surrounding
Community went to a grammar school lad who uncovered a wealth of over
five tons of scrap metal which has been hidden for over 15 years near the
end of Mayfield Ave.
The bov, Teddy Giese. son of Prof. Arthur C. Giese, associate professor

of the Biology Department, made
the discovery recently.
The metal fills a ditch near the
end of Mayfield Avenue on the left
side, and is partially covered by
young poplars which have grown up
among the rusted metal.
GALVANIZED METAL
According to Police Chief Gordon
Davis, who inspected the find, the
metal is composed of galvanized
sheeting and drain pipes from roofs,
and wire mesh used in plastering.
Davis, who has been on campus for
13 years, stated he had never heard
of the metal before but he felt sure
it had been there before his time.
When Teddy first reported his dis
covery to Principal Allan Beach of
the Stanford Grammar School, it
was suggested that the metal had
been dumped there by the Univer
sity after the earthquake of 1906.
However, investigation showed the
scrap was used by the University on
several buildings before tile roofing
replaced it. It was given away when
it was torn off and dumped in the
ditch near Mayfield Ave. where it
was to have been melted.
MOVING PROBLEM
The only problem that faces Teddy
and the members of the Scrap Metal
Committee now is to find a scrap
drive committee with facilities to
haul away the tons of metal. The
school Scrap Iron Committee has re
fused the job because of lack of fa
cilities to handle it, although it is
thought the State Scrap Organiza
tion will haul it away.
A great deal of the metal will re
quire de-galvanizing, and with the
nearest, de-galvanizing plant still in
the construction stage in San Jose,
the potential bullets and tanks must
remain in the ditch.

replaced it. It was given away when
it was torn off and dumped in the
ditch near Mayfield Ave. where it
was to have been melted.
MOVING PROBLEM
The only problem that faces Teddy
and the members of the Scrap Metal
Committee now is to find a scrap
drive committee with facilities to
haul away the tons of metal. The
school Scrap Iron Committee has re
fused the job because of lack of fa
cilities to handle it, although it is
thought the State Scrap Organiza
tion will haul it away.
A great deal of the metal will re
quire de-galvanizing, and with the
nearest, de-galvanizing plant still in
the construction stage in San Jose,
the potential bullets and tanks must
remain in the ditch.
Top honors in the scrap metal drive for Stanford and the surrounding
Community went to a grammar school lad who uncovered a wealth of over
five tons of scrap metal which has been hidden for over 15 years near the
end of Mayfield Ave.
The bov, Teddy Giese. son of Prof. Arthur C. Giese, associate professor

of the Biology Department, made
the discovery recently.
The metal fills a ditch near the
end of Mayfield Avenue on the left
side, and is partially covered by
young poplars which have grown up
among the rusted metal.
GALVANIZED METAL
According to Police Chief Gordon
Davis, who inspected the find, the
metal is composed of galvanized
sheeting and drain pipes from roofs,
and wire mesh used in plastering.
Davis, who has been on campus for
13 years, stated he had never heard
of the metal before but he felt sure
it had been there before his time.
When Teddy first reported his dis
covery to Principal Allan Beach of
the Stanford Grammar School, it
was suggested that the metal had
been dumped there by the Univer
sity after the earthquake of 1906.
However, investigation showed the
scrap was used by the University on
several buildings before tile roofing
replaced it. It was given away when
it was torn off and dumped in the
ditch near Mayfield Ave. where it
was to have been melted.
