# Men's Garments To Be Exhibited
## 
### 
"Men's Fashions Through the
| Ages," a world-famous collection of
European and American garments,
will be shown for about 10 days in
San Francisco at Hastings, Post at
I Kearney St.
A specimen of an old Egyptian
fabric of a man's garment 4000 years
! old, earliest sewing needles made
j from bones and bronze, a gold bro
! cade waistcoat of the French Louis
XIV period, and an authentic Amer
ican soldier's uniform from the Rev
olutionary War are included in the
collection owned by Charles Leder
man, New York historian.
This exhibit shows that in the
past men, more than women, took
I the leading part in all matters con-
I nected with fashion. In Roman
J times men made the toga the high
| est symbol of the pride of free citi
-1 zens. In the 18th century men's
clothcs were so glamorous that
French cavaliers actually spent
I thousands of dollars for a single out
fit.
