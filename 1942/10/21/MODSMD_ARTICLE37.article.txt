## Dean Yost Donates Bedsprings to Drive 
### 
From Dean Mary Yost's old bed
springs down to the stray tin cans
in back of Roble it was a sad week
end for Stanford scrap as a hard- :
working SWB committee collected ;
nearly a ton and a half of salvage
metal.
Out of the efforts of Corporation
Yard officials alone, the committee j
received 1350 pounds of heavy scrap |
metal in Sunday's drive.
Fraternity pledges rounded up
another 1250 pounds Saturday.

In the tin can drive, 200 pounds of
vital material for the war effort cyme
out of Stanford, and officials esti
mate that between 800 and 1000
pounds in tin cans will be collected j
on the campus when the program
gets fully underway.
Under the direction of Chairmen
Joan Penberthy and Fred McGuire, 1
the salvage committee recently an- i
nounced a reorganized program |
which divides all salvage into five
divisions: heavy metal, light metal,
rubber, kitchen grease, and work
shop material.
Light metal collections come on
the third Saturday of every month i
through living groups. The next |
such drive occurs Nov. 17.

should give the grease to butchers
in one-pound lots.
