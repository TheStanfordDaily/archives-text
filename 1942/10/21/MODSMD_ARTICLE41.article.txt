4 Had i( occurred t«> you that Washington State College is getting away
with murder while many of the other I*CC football teams are taking on
lethal schedules? California and UCLA, especially the Bruins because
they're so hot at this point, are both off the Cougars' playing list this
season. This means that Washington State could win the conference if
certain things happen without coming up against what now looks like the
best team. Babe Horrell's Westwoodians.
Fer instance, we want to see Stanford knock off the Trojans Saturday
and UCLA the following week. If Marchie Schwartz' boys did such as
that and went through the season undefeated, Washington might still get
the Rose Bowl nomination — the

Cougars hold a win over Stanford,
6-0. Of course Washington State
would have to go on beating all in
its path, and there are two more
tough conference teams that may
easily put the Cougars right out of
the picture, Washington and Ore
gon State.
But should Washington State get
by unscathed against the last two
named, its conference record would
look pretty nice, taking in a sure
thing over Idaho Nov. 7. The Cou
gars would have compiled six wins
and one loss. Reason why Babe
Hollingbery's men don't play Cali
fornia is only because Idaho and
Montana are both on the Cougar
docket.
Check three of the other elevens
on the Cougar slate and you'll see
how they can take a real drub
bing from teams outside the con
ference. St. Mary's Pre-Flighters.
still the only undefeated squad
among the pre-flight schools;

Michigan State, which lost to Marquette last week but is still a team
capable of beating WSC, and Texas A.& M., one of the southern stalwarts.
Supposing Stanford beat both UCLA and Southern California and the
Bruins went on from there to win all their games while Washington State
was doing likewise. The pair would tie for the conference title with six
wins and one loss apiece and would never meet each other to decide the
issue.
If that happened, it wouldn't do Stanford any good to blast all its op
ponents just because of that win the Cougars hold over the Indians.
Right now UCLA looks as if it will do things the Bowl way, but the five
week-old season has been so full of upsets and surprises that there's no
reason in the world to believe that Stanford still couldn't go Bowling—
if this beats that., and if that beats this, if all the "ifs" could just unravel
themselves now while we're still waiting.

Supposing Stanford beat both UCLA and Southern California and the
Bruins went on from there to win all their games while Washington State
was doing likewise. The pair would tie for the conference title with six
wins and one loss apiece and would never meet each other to decide the

If that happened, it wouldn't do Stanford any good to blast all its op
ponents just because of that win the Cougars hold over the Indians.
Right now UCLA looks as if it will do things the Bowl way, but the five
week-old season has been so full of upsets and surprises that there's no
reason in the world to believe that Stanford still couldn't go Bowling—

themselves now while we're still waiting.
