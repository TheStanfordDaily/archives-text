After printing a horrible mistake to the effect that Esquire ran no
article on Everett Dean, Stanford's basketball coach, in its November issue,
it has been called to our attention and noted by us that the article is there,
to be exact, on Page 170.
One good excuse to offer as to how we missed it was that our eyes got
as fas as the Vargas au Nuda and that they were compelled by sense of
beauty to stop and rest.
Actually the story was not labeled in the Table of Contents, so we just
took it for granted that there was none. In deference to Dean, it must be
said that the writer made two mistakes, obvious, however, only to tnose
who know something about the game and those who saw Stanford win the
NCAA title over Dartmouth.
Bob Cook, the author, stated that Dean used three types of defense:
man-to-man, zone, and switching. It happens that the last two named
are exactly the same. Also Cook noted that Dean spell-bound and hog
tied the Dartmouth club by inserting a different man in the pivot posi
tion every two or three minutes, including Don Burness.
It so happens that Burness' trick knee had been particularly painful all
the way along, hence his non-participation in either the Rice or Colorado
games. He did play against Dartmouth, but only for about three minutes
actual time.
The article, aside from the above-mentioned miscues, is a fine tribute to
basketball-wise Dean, who has already started priming for next January,
when the Indians open a defense of their championship.
