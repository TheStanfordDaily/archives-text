# WATER FIN TORPEDOES:
## 
### 
A week from next Friday you'll get a chance to see a couple of
human torpedoes flashing through the waters of the Encina pools.
It all goes back to a south sea island and a clever idea conceived by
Samoan natives who wanted something to propel themselves through the
water faster than mere man.
Owen Churchill, a Stanford graduate and Southern California yachts
man, was at the Samoas on vacation and he saw a pair of web-like con
traptions made out of fish bladder stretched across bamboo sticks that
were attached to the swimmer's feet. The ersatz fins seemed to fairly shoot
one through the water.
Churchill brought the idea back home with him. and about four years
ago there appeared on the market the Churchill-backed water fins,
made out «if rubber. They're about a foot long with the ends shaped
like a duck's webbing. The added surface area of the swimmer's foot
enables him to ply the water like paddles of a river-steamer, and the
resulting speed i> nothing short of astounding.
See for yourself Oct. 30.
Incidentally, Churchill participated in the 1932 Olympic sailing races in
the eight-meter class. In 1928 he traveled to the Olympic races at Amster
dam, where only rough water and weather kept him from placing.
At Berlin, in 193 G. Churchill's "Angelita" gained the semi-finals.
Those fins that Churchill invented are now a part of all life guard
equipment along the California coast and in the East. They enable res
cuers to reach their objectives faster and to tread water for a great
length of time in long distance swims.
Churchill recently wrote Swimming Coach Ernie Brandsten that lie had
finally found a plastic material to take the place of the priorities-rubber,
which formerly was used in makjng the fins.
