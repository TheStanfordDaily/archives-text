If you like adjectives heaved into a conglomeration which makes the
best football player of all-time (if the guy who wrote i( is right), then
just tread your way through the following press release from Mississippi
Sta(e. Reading time .'5l seconds wi(h timeouts for breathing between
participial sketches.
It's all about Blondy Black, to wit:
"195 pounds of brawn and muscle packed in a 5-foot 11-inch frame.
Travels at the rate of 9.6 seconds per 100 yards . . . driving, slashing, slicing,
lunging, hurdling and fighting madly. Has the neck of a professional
wrestler, powerful legs, a barrel chest (any beerâ€”not the author's paren
thesis but mine. Take another breath, bub), blond curly hair, green eyes
that flash fire and a never-say-die spirit."
State has won two out of four games.
Wish Stanford had a guy like that.
He would certainly do plenty.
From that write-up. he could do anything.
I would like to know him.
