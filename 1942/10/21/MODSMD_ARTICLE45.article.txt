# Intramural Men Needed As Watchers
## 
### 
Intramural football managers will |
discuss an appeal from a nearby de
fense area for aircraft spotters at a i
meeting with Director Harry Wolter [
in the B.A.C. tonight at 7:15. a few
hours after mural fans learn the
extent of Delta Kappa Epsilon's sup
posed grid power.
At 4 p.m. the Dekes present their !
star performer, Bill Joslyn, sup
ported by passer Jack Clark, ends )
Dick McDonough and John Leddy, j
center Bill Hooper, and fullback
Tom Fuller. Opposition is fur
nished by Sigma Chi which relies
on a sophomore nucleus to meet the j
experienced Dekes.
The other 4 p.m. matchings in- j
elude Phi Delta Theta's running at
tack against Alpha Kappa Lambda,
and El Capitan against the Betas. J
One of the questions of the season I
will be answered when the Phi Delts j
find out if the track prowess of sophs
Bob Sears and John Fulton spells ;
anything worth while on the grid- j
iron. (Dekes supposedly topped the |
Phi Delts by some 40-0 in a practice j
game last week.)
ALPHA DELTS
Alpha Delta Phi plays Fiji at 5, i
at the same time that Biz School ]
opens against El Tigre. The latter
should be some sort of crystal ball |
for the Alpha Delts since the Biz j
School is probably their top compe- j
tition.
Delta Chi and ATO will fight a
neighborly battle for the champion- j
ship of the upper half of their block. I
A stirring epic.

At the managers' meeting tonight, j
Harry Wolter will try to line up j
different houses for service on an ;
all-night shift at a spotting tower
near here. The project was men
tioned at the organization meeting I
earlier in the quarter, Wolter feel- j
ing that the intramural set-up was j
a logical organization to take over j
the watchman duties.
Student pairs would take two- J
hour shifts throughout the night if
plans originally outlined are fol- !
lowed. Wolter urges a good turnout |
for tonight's discussion.
