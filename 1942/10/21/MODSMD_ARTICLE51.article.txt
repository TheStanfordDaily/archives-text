# Stanford Trains for Trojans; Norberg Named Game Captain
## 
### 
transfer fullback who looked so
good during the first few days of
| practice before the season only to
■ injure his left shoulder and be de
! clared out for a time that resembled
| the duration until yesterday.
Frisbee is a fine passer and yes
j terday he and Dr. Fritz Roth, team
j physician, were seeking special
i equipment to pad up the injured
! member and still allow the big full
back to fit into his uniform.
NORBERG NAMED
Big Hank Norberg, starting left
end, was named to pilot the Indians
j against Southern California next
i Saturday at Kezar Stadium. Nor
j berg has apparently shaken off his
former Waterloo of brittleness and
! comes out of every game in shape
to go right back for more.
! Ross Dana, who was moved from
I right to left half, found the new po
j sition to his liking. Ben Morrison,
j utility backfielder, looks as if he
| is permanently stationed at right
half, but he may still be called to
| take any and all of the four back
field positions.
Schwartz had a fourth string team
I going through Southern California
plays all afternoon in one corner of
the field under the direction of
Husky Hunt and Louis Vincenti,
Stanford graduate who helped Vic
Lindskog scout the Trojans last Sat
j urday.
SCRIMMAGE TODAY
That "Trojan" team will work
1 against the varsity in a scrimmage
j either today or tomorrow.
An interesting sidelight on the
! Southern California victory over
| Washington State given by Vincenti
j is the fact that out of 12 passes at
| tempted, the Trojans completed only
I two.
That may mean a rest for the sup
i posedly weak Stanford pass-defense,
! but no doubt the Trojans will come
| northward with plenty of aerial
plays to try along with the Mickey
McCardle-headed running offensive.
—Hit "em Again Harder—
YA N K REPLA CEMENTS
New York's Yankees will return
j to St. Petersburg, Fla., for spring
training with Newark's Bill Johnson
! and George Stirnweiss listed as re
, placements for shortstop Phil Riz
j zuto, in the Navy, and third-baseman
Red Rolfe, who becomes coach at

A shot in the arm at fullback came with the return of Rob Frisbee,

MONTREAL, Oct. 20 (U.R) —
Lieut. Jack Dempsey of the United
j States Coast Guard today was named
referee of the Dave Castilloux-Al
Lust fight for the Canadian welter-
J weight championship at Montreal,
i Nov. 2.
Castilloux, the titleholder, is a
| member of the Royal Canadian Air
Force. Lust is an army private.
—Destroy Troy—
The Chi Omegas walloped the
Gamma Phis 12-5 in the first intra
| mural basketball game of the quar
; ter. Nancy Duckett was the high-
I point woman.

For once in his life as Stanford's football coach, Marchie Schwartz
last night could say that he had enough quarterbacks.
Running through a dummy scrimmage yesterday two teams worked
out, and signal callers Ray Ilammett and Bobby Andrews tossed passes
and ran the teams in potent fashion.
A shot in the arm at fullback came with the return of Rob Frisbee,


HANK NORBERG
transfer fullback who looked so
good during the first few days of
| practice before the season only to
■ injure his left shoulder and be de
! clared out for a time that resembled
| the duration until yesterday.
Frisbee is a fine passer and yes
j terday he and Dr. Fritz Roth, team
j physician, were seeking special
i equipment to pad up the injured
! member and still allow the big full
back to fit into his uniform.
NORBERG NAMED
Big Hank Norberg, starting left
end, was named to pilot the Indians
j against Southern California next
i Saturday at Kezar Stadium. Nor
j berg has apparently shaken off his
former Waterloo of brittleness and
! comes out of every game in shape
to go right back for more.
! Ross Dana, who was moved from
I right to left half, found the new po
j sition to his liking. Ben Morrison,
j utility backfielder, looks as if he
| is permanently stationed at right
half, but he may still be called to
| take any and all of the four back
field positions.
Schwartz had a fourth string team
I going through Southern California
plays all afternoon in one corner of
the field under the direction of
Husky Hunt and Louis Vincenti,
Stanford graduate who helped Vic
Lindskog scout the Trojans last Sat
j urday.
SCRIMMAGE TODAY
That "Trojan" team will work
1 against the varsity in a scrimmage
j either today or tomorrow.
An interesting sidelight on the
! Southern California victory over
| Washington State given by Vincenti
j is the fact that out of 12 passes at
| tempted, the Trojans completed only
I two.
That may mean a rest for the sup
i posedly weak Stanford pass-defense,
! but no doubt the Trojans will come
| northward with plenty of aerial
plays to try along with the Mickey
McCardle-headed running offensive.
