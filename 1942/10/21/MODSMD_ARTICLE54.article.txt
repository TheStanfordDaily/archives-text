forward to team with another soph
omore, Alan Weeden. Sure to see
action are Don Smith and Ted Mun

Strengthened by the return of big
Bob Jones, veteran eenterback,
Stanford's varsity water polo teams
will battle the San Jose State var
sity and two teams of United States
Navy Pre-Flight mermen this week
end.
Jones, who received an O.K. from
his doctor yesterday afternoon,
should see action in one and possibly
two of the contests.
Coach Ernie Brandsten's varsity
will face the San Jose Staters Thurs
day afternoon at 4:20 in the Stan
ford pools. They then get up early
Saturday morning for their journey
to Moraga to play the Pre-Flight re
serves at 9:30 and the varsity at
10:30,
Stanford's power-packed swim
mers should have little trouble dis
posing of the Spartans Thursday.
The Staters lost their old coach this
year and weren't even sure they
would have a team ready for the
game until a few days ago. The Pre-
Flight varsity, which yielded 4-2
last week after a tough struggle,
| will be a lot tougher.
Brandsten's forward line remains
j intact with Captain Hadley Bacon,
i Emmett Cashin, and Bill Mapel hold
[ ing down their jobs safely. Goalie
j Pete Lee will start Saturday, al
though Bud Carpenter, sophomore,
has shown great improvement re
cently.
