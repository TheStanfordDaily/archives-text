AS the war grows older every day, new dis
ussion groups spring up on the campus.
There are many official organizations such as
the International Relations Club, and there are
many more unofficial "bull clubs" which meet
when the occasion arises. Both of these types
of discussion groups have their merits.
Yesterday the International Relations Club
held its first meeting of the quarter. Although
one of the main speakers apparently forgot
about the meeting, the other leader took over,
and with the assistance of several learned mem
bers of the audience, a very intelligent and en
lightening discussion was carried on.
The later meetings may be restricted to the
members of the club; so we believe it would
be a good idea for all those interested in partici
pating in these round tables to contact Dr. Philip
Buck in the Political Science Department so as
not to be excluded from the sessions.
But if you do not find the meetings of the
International Relations Club and similar or
ganizations convenient, contact your roommate
and talk things over. An exchange of healthy
ideas never did anyone any harm.
A bicycle can be almost as dangerous as
an automobile in some siutations. It isn't fun
to walk down the Quad and have some mad
'cyclist tear around the corner and drive into
you. Bicycles are wonderful things now, but
they can be misused. Protect yourself and
the pedestrians; we don't want to walk around
on crutches.
