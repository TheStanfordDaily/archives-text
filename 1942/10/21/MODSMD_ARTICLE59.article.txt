# Rumor Trains
## 
### 
MAYBE you have heard the rumor that Stan
ford will close early this quarter to ease
the transportation. This is not just an idle rumor.
It is a serious problem which is vitally tied up
with the war. With the gasoline rationing and
the tire shortage, it will fall to the railroads to
provide transportation. All over the country
the railroads are staggering under the burden
the war has placed upon them. This is espe
cially true of the Southern Pacific Company,
which must handle all the freight for the Pa
cific war theater.
In fact, so serious is this shortage, in the case
of the S.P., that the Northern Pacific has loaned
it six locomotives and the Pennsylvania has
loaned the company coaches.
With this shortage so acute now, think what
it will be during the holiday season when the
Army, Navy, and Marine Corps give home
leaves to their men. Nearly all the colleges and
preparatory schools have vacations at this
same time. This sharp increase in travel pre
sents a serious problem which must be solved.
At Stanford a special committee comprised
of Registrar Mitchell and Professors Cottrell
and Robinson was appointed by the Committee
of the University to look into the problem.
This committee will meet with Ed Stamm and
try to find out means of solving it in relation to
the University.
Stanford could let out before the leaves are
granted and convene after they expire. This
staggers the transportation burden, but at the
same time it takes valuable college time none
of us can afford to give.
Another alternative is to keep some of the
dormitories and houses open during the vaca
tion so those who have a long way to travel may
remain here. If entertainment and diversion
can easily be provided this plan is not without
merit.
These plans are only suggestions which have
been considered, but other serious suggestions
are needed. This is an invitation for anyone
who has an idea on the subject to give it to Ed
Stamm or wiite a Campus Opinion to Daily.
