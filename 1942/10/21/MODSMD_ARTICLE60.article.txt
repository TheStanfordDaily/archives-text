There lias been no moderation of batlle on the
actual Second Front, the underground movements
of the Continent. The Free Austrian movement in
London reports that an anti-German campaign is
under way even in that ancient German land.
Begun by deserters from the former Austrian
army, the movement has gathered many recruits,
and has armed them by wrecking German supply
trains. Nazi garrisons in Austria have been in
creased and reinforced, so serious is the patriot
menace.
Germany has requisitioned 150,000 laborers
from Vichyfrance, and armed resistance to this
conscription has broken out in Lyons and other
towns. Laval spoke yesterday urging the French
to submit, telling them ihe discipline would be
good for them, and threatening strong measures
against those who resist. Laval was hauled on the
carpet by Hitler lust week and has doubtless been
told what will happen to him if he fails to deliver.
I hope it does.

Among our Latin American neighbors are two
lhat cannot be included in the list of our Latin
American friends. Alone of the 21 republics. Chile
and Argentina have failed to break oIT relations
with the Axis and. indeed, have allowed pro-Axis
groups and Fascist agents to operate under their
jurisdiction without hindrance. Sumner Welles,
a'ting Secretary of State, blasted this attitude in a
speech the other day. Ihe first reaction came from
the President of Chile, who canceled a scheduled
trip to the United Stales. The second reaction came
yesterday when the Chilean cabinet resigned. There
has, as yet, been no particular reaction from the
Argentine government, a reactionary plunderbund
which frankly admires the !\ew Order and whose
political corruption keeps il in power, apparently
against the wish of the Argentine people. Prob
ably nothing less than the Atlantic Fleet would pro
duce any reaction favorable to the United Stales
from ihe government.
