# BULL SESSION

### H. D. Thoreau 
Every now and then we have to run a column
of odds and ends to fill in with when no epic comes
to mind. It's also handy in cleaning out one's
mental cubbyholes.
DON'T PROCRASTINATE
If you plan on going south the week-end of the
U.C.L.A. game, which is the one following this one,
and if you plan to ride the Stanford-Crocker-Hun
tington-Hopkins deluxe coach railways, you had
better come to some agreement with the afore
mentioned corporation pretty soon or they won't
be able to take your trade. In the parlance of the
layman, have you made your reservation yet?
SO WHAT
I purchased a haircut yesterday afternoon.
NOTE FROM BARKER
Got a note in the mail the other day. Merits
mention:
Dear Mr. Thoreau (that's me) :
And on second thought, how about the campus
plays, as well as the campus concerts?â€” See at
tached announcement (a clipping from a recent Bull
Session by 11. D. Thoreau (no relation) concern
ing the opportunity afforded the student body by
the Concert Series, but to gel back to the letter).
For less than the price of a Palo Alto movie (it is
presumed that Mayfield is included also) the stu
dents can save both tires, gas, and money and see
these recent New York plays ''in the flesh," so to
speak! All six for $2. 75! Appreciate your cour
tesy and interest. Thanks.

I think that speaks for itself.
WORK IT OUT
Did you ever slop to think thai maybe Mene
Mene Tekel Upharsin meant Frankie Albert, spelled
sideways?
POST HELL WEEK QUIZ
Now that pre-initiation period is over there is
one question which many young men up the Row
should be asked: "What does fiat mean to you?'
THE STRAIGHT DOPE
The I Diversity of Southern California's football
team, picked by The Daily's grid expert to win the
Coast Conference crown, will defeat those stalwarts
from this school, but it will be the last loss of the
season for the Indians, who are a real good team,
no matter what anybodv says.
