# Gaieties Calls For Musicians
## Show Will Feature Student Orchestra 
### 
Tryouts for the Gaieties all
student orchestra, to be conducted
by Dick Rabbett, will be held Fri
day afternoon at 4:30 in the Educa
tion Auditorium.
For the first time in the history of
the Gaieties, the music will be
played by a student non-profes
sional outfit. This move is a further
effort to keep activities centered on
the campus in accord with the war
program, Rabbett said.
All those interested are urged to
try out, especially saxophone, trum
pet, and drum players, for which
there is a definite need. The job will
pay each person in the 24-piece or
chestra approximately $18.
"Students trying out should bring
their own instruments," Rabbett
said, "however, if anyone doesn't
have his now, but can get it in the
near future, he should come to the
tryout anyhow."
A session for string instrument
tryouts will be announced soon.
Both men and women may try out.
"The music looks good," Rabbett
remarked, "and we've got several
exceptional numbers."
Musical arrangements will be made
by a professional arranger in a pop
ular style such as that employed by
Tommy Dorsey and Glenn Miller.
