## 
### 
. Dr. Hermane Tavares de Sa sought to wake Americans to the erroneous
information which they have absorbed about Brazil in his Tuesday evening
lecture entitled "The Brazilian Way of Life," last night in the Memorial
Auditorium.
"Americans want their information in pills, and then ask that the country

please remain unchanged in order
that they will not have to take more
pills. Once more, they want to be
thrilled rather than informed," Dr.
Tavares declared.
If the decisive phase of the Good
Neighbor Policy is to be realized, re
liable and accessable information on
Latin America should be put before
the U.S. public. Dr. Tavares pointed
out the exotic, unrealistic description
which American authors, including
John Gunther, have made of South
America.
The Brazilian professor went on
to describe the amazingly rapid
changes which have occurred in the
economic pattern. The importance of
coffee, although it is still being ex
ported at the same rate, has been
lost to the new cotton and mineral
industries. Brazil's great economic
contribution to the war will be iron.
In regard to the question of Chile
and Argentina, Dr. Tavares ex
pressed the wish that they would
sign with us soon. As he said, it
would be better to lose together than
to win only in part.
Dr. Tavares made light of the Axis
minority problem, saying that it had
been exaggexated in the American
press.
"This war is the supreme test of
Pan-Americanism, and only sincere
consideration of reliable information
will produce the desired end," fin
ished the lecturer.
