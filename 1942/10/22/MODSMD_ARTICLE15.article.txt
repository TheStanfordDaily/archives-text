# Farm Speakers' Service Sets Wednesday Sign-up Deadline
## 
### 
Deadline for sign-ups with the Stanford Speakers' Service, an organiza
tion which furnishes a variety of speakers and topics to schools, clubs, and
groups in neighboring communities, will he next Wednesday, according to
Mrs. Claire Loftus, faculty advisor to the Service.
"Speaking for the service is a good way to gain first hand experience in

addressing public audiences
making possible job contacts," Mrs. I
Loftus explained.
In addition, enrollment in the |
service carries either one or two
units. Enrollment is still open at
this date due to the fact that a topic
roster could not be formulated until
the public demands are known.
TOPICS SCHEDULED
"If anyone has traveled, has any
sort of interesting experiences or
hobby he or she would like to speak
on, please contact Jim Kessler, man
ager of the service; or me in Room
209 of Memorial Auditorium," Mrs.
Loftus said.
Topics now scheduled include talks
on popular subjects ranging from
radio, modern drama, photography
and fishing to experience in service
organizations.
Other talks will be on current
topics dealing mostly with war and
peace, for which there is a large de
mand.
TRAVEL LECTURES
Lectures on travel in various
countries will cover such places as
England, the West Indies, Quebec,
and Australia. The service would
especially like more students to
speak on travels in other countries.
Another section of topics to be in
cluded in the roster includes sub
jects on various forms of education,
such as explaining how to do some
thing and telling of different aspects
of Stanford and college life.
