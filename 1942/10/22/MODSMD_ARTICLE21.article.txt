## 
### 
Jim Kessler, Stanford senior de
lator and freshman debate coach,
will face one of his pupils, frosh
Frank Church, in the All-University
debate to be hold Wednesday at 7:150
p.m. in the Educational Auditorium,
according to Dr. Lee Chapin, var
isty debate coach who supervised
the tryouts.
Kessler's reputation at Stanford is
quite well known. Last Spring
Quarter he and Lawrence Grannis
represented Stanford in a nation
wide tour which took them to 25 dif
ferent universities. Kessler was also
a member of the team which defeat
ed California in the Commonwealth
debate last year.
Surprisingly, Frank Church, a
freshman from Boise, Ida., chal
lenged and defeated all upper class
men to place opposite Kessler.
Church has three years of high school
varsity debate behind him, and was
the winner of the American Legion
National Oratorical Contest.
FOUR DELEGATIONS
The debate will be much different
from the usual affairs and quite
dramatic. Four delegations of 25
members, students in Dr. Chapin's
speech classes, will offer amend
ments to the question, Resolved, that
labor and capital should be con
scripted for the duration, and each
of these amendments will be dis
cussed for a two-minute period by
the two feature speakers.
A panel of students representing
nearly every major nation will judge
each amendment. Introducing the
chairman of the program will be Ed
Stamm, student body president.
Traveling to San Francisco today
to the English Speaking Union to
discuss the subject, "Youth Faces
the Future," are four Stanford stu
dents, Jim Kessler, who will repre
sent North America; Gris
wold, a transfer from Westminster
School in London, who will repre
sent Great Britain; Roy Vanit, rep
resentative of Asia; and J. Domingo
Shelton-Vasquez," representing Latin
America.
