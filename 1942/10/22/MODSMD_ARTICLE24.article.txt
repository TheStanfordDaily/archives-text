# Japs Sink Two US Destroyers, But American Flyers Smash Ship, Shore Bases in Solomons
## 'Meredith' and 'O'Brien' Lost By Enemy Action, But Majority Of Ships' Personnel Is Rescued 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (UP). —The raging battle of the Solomon is
lands has cost the United States two more destroyers—the Meredith and
the O'Brien—the Navy disclosed today, hut the Japs also arc suffering
from heavy and continuous U.S. aerial blows and the main ground forces
have not yet come to grips.
Disclosure that the destroyers had been lost within the ''last few days"

and frequent reference to "naval
aircraft" as opposed to land-based
fighters and bombers led to specula
tion that a U.S. naval task force
again had moved into the area with
one or more aircraft carriers.
MAJOR CLASH NEAR
Should this be true, a major navm I
clash probably could not long be
averted.
The Navy did not disclose how the
two new destroyers were lost, ex
cept that it was by "enemy action."
"It is believed that all personnel
of the O'Brien and many of the per
sonnel of the Meredith were res
cued," the communique said.
Normal complement of each ves
sel is about 175 oflicers and men.
JAPS BLASTED
Meanwhile, the Navy gave re
newed proof that our Grumann
"Wildcat" fighters and Douglas dive
bombers still are utilizing the Gua
dalcanal airport for attacks on Jap
ships and shore positions.
The dive bombers damaged one
enemy destroyer to the west of Gua
dalcanal and one enemy cruiser.
The planes also bombed enemy sup
ply dumps and positions on north
west Guadalcanal, scene of reccnl
Jap troop landings.
