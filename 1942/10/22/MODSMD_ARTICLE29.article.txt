# Crippled Boy Needs Books for Studies
## 
### 
Giphaned and hopelessly crip
pled for the last 10 years with in
fantile paralysis, a young boy in
the Community Hospital in San
Mateo is lying in a hospital bed
studying to become a teacher in a
school for crippled children.
This boy doesn't have a family
to write tuition checks every
quarter or buy expensive text
books. He is entirely dependent on
generosity of a few people to give
or lend him his supplies.
And now, through the Stanford
Daily, he is asking for the loan of
two bocks: Harper's LATIN
DICTIONARY and the Concise
CAMBRIDGE HISTORY of ENG
LISH LITERATURE by George
Sampson.
It takes just a few minutes to
look through your books and if
you have a copy of either, to turn
it in to the DAILY. It's not much
of an effort when you think of
the one that boy is making.
