"Skiing and the War Effort" was
the subject of a talk by Albert Sigal,
chairman of the California division
of the National Ski Patrol, to the
Stanford Ski Club in the Educa
tional Auditorium last night.
Mr. Sigal said that the activity of
the National Ski Patrol System to
establish ski safety has been ex
tended ana that they are working
closely in many ways with the War
Department under a directive issued
by General Marshall.
'"The Stanford Ski Club could well
use this as a major objective of its
ski season," said Mr. Sigal. "To con
tinue the work of the ski patrol
would be a worthy undertaking for
your club, and one which we would
like to develop as a pattern for other
colleges."
Fred Bell of the Union Pacific in
troduced Mr. Sam F.eid, the Sun
Valley representative, who explained
the facilities which Sun Valley will
offer to college students this coming
season.
