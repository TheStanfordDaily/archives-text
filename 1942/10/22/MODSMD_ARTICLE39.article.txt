### BOB SONTAG 
d ETCHING TIIE EARLY B1KI):
4 The department goes out limbing two days early with Saturday's do
or-diers in the Pacific Coast Conference games. In direct opposition to
what Henry David Thoreau said in his Bull Session yesterday, the lirst
score picked may seem somewhat revolutionary, but it's straight from the
shoulder.
Anything said here is strictly ex parte evidence, since we have a great
vested interest influencing our homeground pix.
STANFORD OVER USC BY 1
Getting off to what is considered a very upsettish start. Stanford gets
the nod because: (1) the Indian line will hold down Mel Bleelcer, Mickey
McCardle, Paul Taylor, and Bob Musick like they have never been held
down before, (2) Stanford only lost to Washington State by six points, one
touchdown, when the Redskins played their worst game, and the Trojans
blasted the Cougars into a 26-12 submission. Washington State could score
twice against USC but only once against Stanford, and (3) the Stanford
offensive is now primed to score a little for itself after seeing how its plays
should work against Idaho.
UCLA OVER SANTA CLARA BY fi
This is strictly home-grown. With all their class, Beals and Freitas, et
cetera, the Broncos will be up against Bob Waterfield, possibly the best
passer on the Coast, which doesn't have many real pitchers. The aerial
contest featuring Freitas vs. Waterfield also matches the running ability
of little A1 Solari against Santa Clara's backfield aces, Bill Prentice and
Paul Vinolla. The Bruins have found themselves and should not be stopped
by any Coast team this yearâ€”even Santa Clara.
WASHINGTON OVER CALIFORNIA BY 14
California can go through this season of football without winning a single
game, and light now it looks as if Stubber Allison is going to have his
Bears do just that very thing. Washington slammed little Montana around
last week, 35-0, while two weeks earlier holding what is now considered
"mighty" Southern California to a scoreless tie.
Jim Jurkovich, poison to any opponent if he is in shape, will ride the
bench Saturday. Walt Harrison, the gigantic Husky center, will do a little
Mack-trucking to bolster the Washington line against any and all "funda
mental" threats Allison may have to offer, while Pete Susick and Sammy
Robinson, the Husky halfback twins, will be very offensive to Bear backs
Gene Pickett and Frank Porto.
OSC OVER WASHINGTON STATE BY 7
This will be termed by most prognosticators as an "upset of the week,"
but actually the Washington State Cougar is turning into a fading comet
that promises to fade right into a loss to Oregon State Saturday. The Ducks,
defending PCC champs, have had bad luck all the way along this season,
losing to UCLA and Santa Clara while beating Idaho and California. The
Oregon Staters don't show much on form, but yours truly thinks that the
Cougars are due for a rude awakening, just as they were against Southern
California last week.
IDAHO OVER OREGON BY 1
Oregon has beaten no one this year while the Vandals whipped Eastern
Washington and scored once on Stanford. That's enough for us in a game
that means nothing to nobody except Oregon and Idaho.
MONTANA OVER MONTANA STATE BY 12
Don't know who plays for Montana State, but three big ones for the
Missoulans who last year trampled their State brothers, 23-13. Last year
the Staters scored once by centering the ball to a guy who lateraled to
another guy on the sidelines, who in turn heaved a forward to another guy
in the end zone. It won't happen this year.

( ll'R MISTAKE AGAIN:
Yesterday's tick-off to the Esquire backfired slightly, but can't be
called a complete blowout.
Everett Dean uses two defensive setups, a zone and a man-to-man. That
defense spoken of as a "switching" is merely a variation of the strict man
to-man type. If the defensive man is caught in a block he "switches" and
guards another man, but as soon as he can goes back to guarding his orig
inal opponent. Still confused?
