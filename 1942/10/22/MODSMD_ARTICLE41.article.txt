# Injury May Keep Hoisch On Sidelines
## 
### BILL GLIKBARG 
Little A1 Hoisch. one of Stanford's
fleet left halfbacks, revived an old
arch injury during Saturday's game
and, after trying to run at top
speed yesterday, found himself
J slewed up considerably and may be
j out of Saturday's game with Sputh
j ern California at Kezar Stadium.
Hoisch, who pushed Jim Pettit to
a 9.9 hundred against the California
I frosh last spring, would have been
| a certain starter or second-stringer.
The position now goes to Ross Dana
for sure, with Don Zappettini to
I back him up.
HOPES BOOSTED
Stanford's football hopes were
j boosted with the return of quarter
back Mark Caffall and fullback Bob
Frisbee. Caffall has been out .since
J the Santa Clara game with an in
fected leg, but he was able to run
in practice yesterday.
Frisbee's shoulder injury is well
' protected with a pad. and he was
passing well in practice. If Frisbee
I does not play against Southern Cali
i fornia, he will be ready for UCLA.
PI.AYS SCOUTED
The first team scrimmaged against
a dummy USC team formed by the
third squad. The plays were scouted
by Vic Lindskog at the USC-Wash
ington State game which Washing
ton State won 26-13. Shipkel helped
the starting line-up work out some
good defenses for Saturday's game.
