# Fijis Pull First Upset Of Mural Grid Season
## 
### 
Phi Gamma Delia engineered the fir.l real upset in Stanford's 1!)42 intra
mural football race yesterday afternoon when a six-point victory pass
from Bill Harms to Frank Tsbhctts honged the Alpha Delts, 6-0.
The l ijis scored early in .the first half and then retrenched. Whether or
not they were pushed around for the rest of live game—there's some con-

troversy about that—the Doud-+
| Gadd-McClean-Crary-Etc. crow d
i that practiced faithfully could not
jet anywhere.
Bill Brokaw, Don Dillon, Kenny
Horth, Bob Haffner, and Eric Hauser
! for the Phi Gams made up the start
ing squad with Harms and Tibbetts.
DEKES WIN
! Instead of the Sigma Chis, as was
wrongly announced, the Chi Psis, as
I was right and proper, appeared as
dish number one on the Deke menu.
Final: Dcke 20. Chi Psi (i. Most of
the scores came on running plays.
Spot passing kept the Lodge Boys on
: their heels most of the game. i
First score came on a 50-yard run i
by Carlisle Barringer. A lateral
pass to Bill Hooper who ran 40 yards •
brought the second, and Bowman
Lamport, the Dekes' reserve team, |
smothered a Chi Psi fumble in the ,
end zone for the last.
The Chi Psi's scored a 30-yard !
pass from Hind to Sonnenberg. Al
-1 though the Deke attack was clearly

| superior yesterday and probably
I won't suffer much trouble in its own
j bailwick, League 4. observers felt
i that some polish is in order. If
; either the Zetes or Phi Psis appear
ion the scene as playoff opponents
for Bill Joslyn's crew, such polishing
I won't be missed.
BIZ SCHOOL FORFEITS
The graduates v>f the Biz School
did not appear, handing El Tigre a
1-0 gift and disappointing followers
who expected another strong squad
from the administrators this year.
The Betas combined to run up a
26-0 win over El Capitan. Despite
! the efforts of the Capitan's Smiley
Cameron, the Beta runners pushed
: over two scores in the first half and
two in the second. Doug Balthus and
Phil Shean, the latter collecting two
scores, were main Beta performers.
The team that will not be using
i sophomore trackmen this year de-
I spite what this source reports, the
Phi Delta Thetas, outlasted the
AKL's, 6-0. The score came on a
! pass. Bu Guynan to Jack Grey, with
i mountainous Phil Prince blocking
' effectively. AKL passer Evans
found his receivers well.
DELTA CHI WIN
Delta Chi's Wolf caught a scorings
| pass from Scott in the first half for
j six points and followed by receiving
I a conversion flip for a 7-0 win over
j the ATO's. The Delta Chi slate is
I clean, despite the close margin, for
| future meetings with the Fijis and
; Alpha Dolts.
