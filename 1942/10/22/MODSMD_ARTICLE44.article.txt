# Chicago Bears Lead Pro Clubs

CHICAGO. Oct. 21 (UP).—The
world champion Chicago Pears to-
I day set about to blast the popularly
held theory that professional teams
devote their entire offensive talents j
| to passing.
The Bears are Ihe only undefeated
| team in the National Football
League and latest official statistics
show that the title-bound proteges
rof Coach George Halas owe their j
top rank primarily to the power of j
j their running attack.
In Sid Luckman, the former Co
! lumbia great, and "Chuckin' Char
-1 ley" O'Rourke, late of Boston Col
lege, the Bears have two great pass
| ers but they've preferred to grind J
J their way along the ground.
As they rolled over Green Bay, I
j Cleveland, the Chicago Cards and |
j New York, the Bears made 19 touch- j
downs. Thirteen of the scores have
come through the running attack as
; against six on passes.
Only one team in the league, the
Giants, has thrown fewer passes than
Halas' outfit. The New Yorkers have
| tossed but 39 passes as against the
i Bears' 59. The "passingest" team in
the loop is Cleveland, which has at
tempted 135 aerials.
The infrequent use the Bears have
I made of their passing attack this
j season is a bit surprising for twice
in the past three years the chain
! pions have led the league in yards
| gained by use of aerials. Last sea
son they set a new record with 2002
| yards gained on passes.

NEVADA VS. SANTA ANA
RENO, Nev„ Oct. 21 (U.R)—Al
though his team will be outweighed,
man for man, Coach Jim Aiken was
! optimistic today as the University of
Nevada football team practiced for
its game with the Santa Ana Air
Base here Saturday.
A diamond field of 73 acres is
i being worked in the state of Ar
kansas. The prize find in the field
was a stone weighing more than 40
i carats.
