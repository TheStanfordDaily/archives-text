# Aquatic Lineup Gets Addition
## 
### 
A new name has been added to
the galaxy of swimming talent lined
up by Coach Ernie Brandsten for
his aquatic extravaganza scheduled
for the afternoon of Oit. 30.
The old meets the new when A1
White, Stanford '24, joins Sammy
Lee, considered the world's greatest
diver in Bransten's swimming show.
Lee is great now, but White in his
day was rated the equal of the grace
ful Korean boy from Occidental
College.
White, one of Stanford's greatest
divers, was American champion for
four years, 1922-25, and climaxed
his career by scoring a double win
in the 1924 Olympic Games. Head
and shoulders above his competitors,
White won both the high and spring
board diving, a feat equalled by very
few men since then.
In Brenda Helser, American 880-
yard free style tit list; Marge Ge
string, Olympic Games diving cham
pion in 193G and American champ
for three years; Emmett Cashin, one
of the finest all around swimmers in
the country; and Jim Gamble, na
tional freshman 50-yard free style
record holder, Stanford has stars ol
her own to add to the talents o(
| White and Lee for the Army and
; Navy relief show.
Tickets will go on sale Oct. 28 and
29 at the B.A.C. at 25 cents for stu
dents and 50 cents for adults.
