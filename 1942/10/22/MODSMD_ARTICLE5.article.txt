# Alaskan Colonel Has Unique Plan

### 
SEATTLE, Oct. 21 (U.R)—From a
large Army base somewhere in
Alaska on his first leave in 14
months, Col. C. M. Tuck was in
Seattle today with a unique plan to
"kill two birds with one stone."
Col. Tuck was conducting a per
sonal scrap drive of the city—look
ing for lumber, furniture and used
wood-working machines and tools
to take back to soldiers at his post.
"Our base is so large and cargo
space so limited, I can't take back
all the furniture we need," he ex
plained. "So I'm taking back a few
articles of furniture for the boys to
copy. They can build all the furni
ture needed, and at the same time
learn a useful hobby."
