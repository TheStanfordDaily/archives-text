						Bad Tradition, II

### 
WE appreciate the many letters we have re
ceived from Encinamen concerning Tues
day's editorial "A Bad Tradition." We have
printed in today's Campus Opinion column the
first of the letters we received. We regret that
space does not permit the printing of all of
them.
We realize that the editorial was one-sided
and did not go far enough. After the editorial
was written, many students came to the Daily
office and told us the reason v/hy the frosh
continue to swear indiscriminately out of their
windows, and we wish to state that the argu
ment is well chosen.
It is the upperclassmen, the women, and stu
dents from Palo Alto and Menlo who are behind
this whole problem. They think it is funny to
hear a bunch of angry frosh swear in unison;
they are the ones who don't care what they or
anyone else hear. As for those women who
proudly and bravely yell "To hell with '46,"
we obviously weren't referring to them when
we said, think of the "position any woman
would be in when she hears this kind of lan
guage." They don't care.
But it is poor taste on the part of upperclass
men to speed by Encina and taunt the frosh.
Stanford doesn't appreciate that attitude.
To guote from another letter we would have
liked to print, "Would you call these upper
classmen honorable and uphloding the Stanford
ideals when they are the true root of the evil?
. . . This noise goes on when we are trying
to study. Having just entered the University,
we are trying to make good marks and set a
precedent for future freshmen. What type of
precedent do you classify this which the upper
classmen are setting?"
This comment was written in all sincerity and
hits the nail right on the head. If upperclassmen
can't refrain from yelling at the frosh, why don't
they drive downtown via the Museum?
Before letting the matter drop and placing
the blame solely upon the upperclassmen's
shoulders, there is one more point from the
Encina side to be considered. Now that the
matter has been aired, couldn't you frosh show
some common sense and leave the taunts un
answered at least for the rest of this week? If
you feel like swearing, cuss at your roommate
and then turn around to> your books.
If the upperclassmen continue to heckle,
write to The Daily and we'll air the guestion
again. But bear in mind the fact that maybe
those loud voices aren't those of Stanford men.
We hope not.
Enjoy the Pajamarino tonight, but remem
ber fruit and eggs are luxuries in other coun
tries, and soon will be in the United States.
Leave those eggs and tomatoes home; we
don't want to have any costly riots like the
ones which have occurred in the past
