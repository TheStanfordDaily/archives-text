# Keep Them Rolling
## 
### 
ONCE again wc wish to pat Rally Committee,
and especially Ted Barr. on the back for
the excellent upswing in interest in the Dimes
for Diplomas campaign. At first many persons
were doubtful as to whether this was really a
worthy, cause, but now most of us realize that
a good many freshmen and sophomores won't
be able to finish school until after the war.
If the campaign helps only one person after
the war, we believe that it will have done a
great service to that student and to the country,
for the work that that man will do when he
returns will make him better fitted to be a leader
for the postwar world.
Keep those Dimes rolling; they're insurance
for the future.
