WIN WITH WILLKIE
Two statesmen of the I nited Nations have re
cently raised their voices for a Second Front. In
Russia, on the lour of inspection from which he has
just returned, Wendell Willkie raised his voice. To
day, speaking before a special session of the Lords
and Commons, Field Marshal Jan Christian Smuts.
72-year-old Premier of the I uion of South Africa,
said that the time for an Allied offensive is near
and hinted that he knew more of the subject than
he would tell.
Is there anyone in the I nited Stales or Great
Britain today who is not convinced that an invasion
of the Continent is the imperative need of the
hour? Russia has not crumbled, and indeed, such
a fight as she has given the Nazis at Stalingrad si
lences any suspicion that she is on the verge of
crumbling, but Stalingrad is a defensive action.
The war will not be won by defense. Already the
Russians have lost large percentages of their popu
lation, resources, and territory. The United States
was driven out of the Philippines, Britain lost Singa
pore and a year ago was driven from France. We
aren't winning this war anywhere! We won't win
it as long as we pile up troop concentrations and
supply bases here and there, while an American
force battles in ihe Solomons, a British army marks
time in Africa, Russia defends the line of the Volga,
and China inches back toward the sea. If we won
every action now in progress or anticipated, we
would still have no more than started to win the
war. The war will be won by invading Germany
and crushing her resistance and not otherwise!
Ihe U.S. Stalf has not failed us so far in the
war and we may presume that they will not fail us
now. And there is the further calculation to be
made, "What if we lose? * For a comparison, re
member the Louis-Conn fight. Conn might have
held Louis off and tired him, but he decided on
frontal attack instead. And lost. To that considera
tion, we can oppose this, "'What if we fail to attack,
and so lose opportunity? ' Then Hitler has the in
itiative again; the Germans can strike wherever we
are prepared, Russia will be isolated. Japan
will have a free hand elsewhere, and, hysterical as I
may sound, we may have lost the war. You pays
your money and you takes your choice.
