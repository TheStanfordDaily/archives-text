Various esoteric hits of information wandering
through my head:

There have been nebulous rumors floating around
campus for some time to the effect that school is
going to be let out a week early and convene several
weeks late in January because the overtaxed rail
roads will become even more overtaxed around
Christinas by service men going home on leave.
1 his, at least, is one rumor. Another rumor is that
the administration may attempt to keep as many
students on campus as possible to do war work
during vacation. This also would relieve the rail
roads. It seems that the railroads really are having
a tough time keeping their lines open for civ ilian
passengers, which is understandable, but I. as an
outsider, trying to make plans for vacation, would
like to know what the administration's policy is go
ing to be. It is rumored I ah. those rumors) that
both of these plans are before the board or council
or committee or whatever it is that makes those de
cisions in (lie administration, but does it take so
terrifically long to decide on the policy that is going
to be observed? This isn't meant to be deroga
lorily critical, just critical. I, and I think some
other people, would just like to know what's brew
ing.

A clever young lady is the Pi Phi (oh God. let's
not go into that) who tied three hat elastics to
gether, attached one end of the string to the bar
underneath the seat of her bicycle, and tied a clip
to the other end. The idea is that she attaches the
clip to the forward part of her skirl and can ride
along with rut worry about her skirl flying to places
where skirts aren't supposed to be.

At a meeting the other night one young man who
had played a sparkling game against Idaho except
for one slijilil miseue. got up and said, "And there's
just one more point—whereupon one of his
friends interjected. "You didn't drop the pass —you
just kicked it with your knee."
