# Students Excess Tires Must Be In by Nov. 9
## 
### BILL COUGHLIN 
Stanford students with more than five tires for their cars must turn in
their excess tires by Nov. !) in order to comply with the new government
ruling limiting each car to five tires. Motorists not doing this will not
receive gas ration books.
Tires may be turned in to the Railway Express Agency at 41!) High street

in Palo Alto. The agency will
open every day of the week, except- I
ing Sundays, from 8-5.
Railway Express will give the j
motorist a receipt for the tires, and i
they will then be sent to a San Fran- ;
cisco warehouse where they will be
appraised by a government tire man.
The appraisal value will depend
upon need for repairs, and mileage
remaining on the tire.
PAYMENT OFFERED
After the appraisal, the govern
ment will send the motorist a check,
or the value of the tires in war
stamps or bonds, according to his
preference. Gifts of tires will be
accepted.
The Railway Express Agency in I
Palo Alto has already received more i
than 250 tires, some of them gifts.
One woman attempted to turn in j
her entire car.
When registering on Nov. 9 for
gas ration booklets, motorists must j
also file tire inspection certificates \
and a list of all the tires they own. j
If in possession of more than five |
tires, the motorist will receive no
ration book until he has sold the j
excess to the federal government.
There is no information at this j
time regarding the questions of turn
ing in inner tubes and tires on j
trailers.
TIRE INSPECTION
Nor has the place for tire inspec
tions been announced, although it !
is likely service stations will handle '
the job. The service stations on j
campus have received no informa
tion on this as yet.
The campus service stations are
recording the serial numbers of all
tires which they change, valuable
information in case of theft of tires. J
According to the attendants, Stan
ford students are taking much bet
ter care of their tires now.
"Almost every guy that comes in
now has his tires checked," Leo Mc- !
Caffrey, attendant, stated." Whether
he buys one gallon of gas or 10, he
has his tires checked."
When the new rationing system
goes into effect on Nov. 22, every car
will be subject to periodic tire in
spections.
