## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 21 (U.R) —
Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson
today urged Congress to reject a
proposed ban on liquor sales in and
around service camps because the
Army otherwise would be compelled
to enforce prohibition in New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles, San Francisco
and any other community adjacent
to military camps.
Target of Stirnson's attack was a
proposed amendment to the 'teen
age draft bill barring the sale of all
liquor — even near-beer —in and
a round service camps. Author of
the proposal is Sen. Josh Lee (D.,
Okla.), who says that "prospects of
passage look better evei'y day."
The explosive amendment is the
major stumbling block in Senate
age from 20 to 18.
