Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
yesterday declared that any student
who fulfills departmental require
ments may request his diploma and
transcript to list him as having been
awarded a degree in that depart
ment.
This, in effect, voids the petitions
signed by more than 400 students
who have asked that diplomas and
transcripts list degrees by depart
ments rather than schools.
Dr. Wilbur pointed out that dur
ing wartime it is much easier for the
undergraduate to fulfill the general
requirements of a school, than the
specific requirements of a depart
ment within a school. Often, he
said, a student doesn't have time to
take the required courses within a
department before being called into
service, but has the time to complete
the more broad requirements of a
school because of greater selectivity
and range of subjects.
According to the Chancellor, this
transfer of Undergraduates into
schools is in line with the general
trend of education throughout the
country. He further declared that
the A.B. degree has come to mean a
broad, general education, and that
the student does not usually special
ize until he enters graduate work. .
College education is being intensi
fied, explained the Chancelllor in
stressing the fact that students now
have only two and one-half years
to three years to complete college.
Therefore, they will not usually
have the time to fulfill rigid de
partmental requirements, he went
on to say.
Dr. Wilbur also declared that the
decision to transfer the students
from departments to schools had
been passed by the Board of Trust
ees in 1938.
