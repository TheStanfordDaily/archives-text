# Rejuvenated Cards Ready For Trojans
## Cold Weather May Boost Stanford's Chances Tomorrow 
### 
If the weather stays cold tomor
row afternoon between the hours of
2:150 and 4:45 p.m. at Kezar Stadium,
Stanford should upset Southern
California.
Yesterday for the first time since
the season started, a chilly day
sprang up, and that undefinable
something called "spirit" flashed
through the Indians in abundance
enough to knock the pins from un
der El Trojan and send him back to
Los Angeles gasping for sunny
Southern California.
CRAV ATI I NOT PLEASED'
Meanwhile down at Bovard Field
where the Trojans took their last
workout yesterday, Coach Jeff Cra
vath said he was still "not pleased"
with the third successive scrimmage
against Stanford's T-formation plays.
On the advice of the team physician,
Cravath decided to leave halfback
Hal Finney home to rest his sprained
leg.
Feature of the Trojans' final prac
tice was the precision of Mickey Mc-
Cardle's passes, since McCardle in
jured his arm a week ago and threw
no aerials against Washington State
last Saturday.
lIOISCII'S LOSS HURTS
Stanford will be at full strength
except for the lefthalf position, where
A1 Hoisch's injury will cut down the
available reserve material to Don
Zappettini and Ben Morrison. Dana
will start with Zappettini next in
line and Morrison ready to play any
backfield position Coach Marchie
Schwartz desires.
Stanford is once again three-deep
at quarterback with Ray Hammett
the leading lady and Bobby An
drews and Mark Caffall just off
stage and ready for action.
FORWARDS ALL SET
Bob Frisbee, hard-driving Sacra
mento transfer who returned to the
practice field two days ago, will be
a certain starter against UCLA but
won't play tomorrow. Fullback Buck
Fawcett, who has compiled a mark
slightly in excess of five yards per
try since the season's start, will head
the Indians' ground offensive.
The mighty Stanford line was at
peak form in yesterday's dummy
scrimmage and promises to stop Paul
Taylor, Mickey McCardle, Bob Mu
sick, and Mel Bleeker, the Trojan
backfield quartet. From left to right
they're veterans Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Loren La-
Prade, and Bruno Banduc-ji.
Alternating behind Taylor at left
guard are Drive Patterson and Har
vey Bernhard.
TROUT FEARED
At the other guard to back up La-
Prade is sophomore Bill Young,
while tackles Fred Boensch and Jim
Cox are ready, willing and able to
replace Stamm and Banducci.
Game Captain Hank Norberg at
left end and Roger Laverty at right
complete the lineup.
If Stanford keeps a wary eye on
pass receivers Howard Callanan and
Jack Trout, runners McCardle and
Musick. if Stanford's own offense
goes anything like it did against
Idaho, and if it's a cold day at Kezar,
watch the scoreboard for the biggest
surprise package of the 1942 foot
ball season, Stanford winning over
Southern California.

On the advice of the team physician,
Cravath decided to leave halfback
Hal Finney home to rest his sprained
leg.
Feature of the Trojans' final prac
tice was the precision of Mickey Mc-
Cardle's passes, since McCardle in
jured his arm a week ago and threw
no aerials against Washington State
last Saturday.
lIOISCII'S LOSS HURTS
Stanford will be at full strength
except for the lefthalf position, where
A1 Hoisch's injury will cut down the
available reserve material to Don
Zappettini and Ben Morrison. Dana
will start with Zappettini next in
line and Morrison ready to play any
backfield position Coach Marchie
Schwartz desires.
Stanford is once again three-deep
at quarterback with Ray Hammett
the leading lady and Bobby An
drews and Mark Caffall just off
stage and ready for action.
FORWARDS ALL SET
Bob Frisbee, hard-driving Sacra
mento transfer who returned to the
practice field two days ago, will be
a certain starter against UCLA but
won't play tomorrow. Fullback Buck
Fawcett, who has compiled a mark
slightly in excess of five yards per
try since the season's start, will head
the Indians' ground offensive.
The mighty Stanford line was at
peak form in yesterday's dummy
scrimmage and promises to stop Paul
Taylor, Mickey McCardle, Bob Mu
sick, and Mel Bleeker, the Trojan
backfield quartet. From left to right
they're veterans Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Loren La-
Prade, and Bruno Banduc-ji.
Alternating behind Taylor at left
guard are Drive Patterson and Har
vey Bernhard.
TROUT FEARED
At the other guard to back up La-
Prade is sophomore Bill Young,
while tackles Fred Boensch and Jim
Cox are ready, willing and able to
replace Stamm and Banducci.
Game Captain Hank Norberg at
left end and Roger Laverty at right
complete the lineup.
If Stanford keeps a wary eye on
pass receivers Howard Callanan and
Jack Trout, runners McCardle and
Musick. if Stanford's own offense
goes anything like it did against
Idaho, and if it's a cold day at Kezar,
watch the scoreboard for the biggest
surprise package of the 1942 foot
ball season, Stanford winning over
Southern California.
If the weather stays cold tomor
row afternoon between the hours of
2:150 and 4:45 p.m. at Kezar Stadium,
Stanford should upset Southern
California.
Yesterday for the first time since
the season started, a chilly day
sprang up, and that undefinable
something called "spirit" flashed
through the Indians in abundance
enough to knock the pins from un
der El Trojan and send him back to
Los Angeles gasping for sunny
Southern California.

Meanwhile down at Bovard Field
where the Trojans took their last
workout yesterday, Coach Jeff Cra
vath said he was still "not pleased"
with the third successive scrimmage
against Stanford's T-formation plays.
