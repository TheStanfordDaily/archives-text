Reviewing one of Mr. Bacon's re
cent compositions, the San Francisco
Chronicle said, "Bacon has a flair
little short of genius for bringing out
the full flavor of American melody,

allied to an accompaniment that is
invariably alive and simple to the
nth degree."
Miss Camp and Mr. Bacon; will
open the program with a duet en
titled "Sonata for Violincello and
Piano" by Corelli. Mozart's "An
dante in F." played by Mr. Bacon,
will be the second number. The final
piece before the intermission will be
a solo by Miss Camp of Bloch's

tions. They are Chopin's "Nocturne
in D Flat Major" and "Mazurka,"
and "Capricrcio in B Minor" and
"Rhapsody in E Flat Major" by
Brahms.
Miss Camp will conclude the pro
gram with five cello solos. The first
two are both Mr. Bacon's own com
positions. They are entitled "The
Welcome Suite" and "Buncombe
County." The other three composi
tions are. "Intermezzo" by Grana
dos, Chopin's famous "Nocturne"
