# Farm To Debate Big War Issue
## 
### 
"Resolved: That both capital and
labor be conscripted for the dura
tion of the war," announces the
chairman. "Mr. Kessler will rep
resent the affirmative, and Mr.
Church the negative. Have the del
egates from the south an amend
ment to offer?"
This somewhat typifies the scene
that will take place in the Edu
cation Auditorium Wednesday night
at 7:30 in the all-University de
bate. The delegations, four in
number representing the four di
rections of the compass, and con
sisting of members of Dr. Lee Cha
pin's speech classes, will offer
amendments; the one from the
north may be something like this:
QUESTION AMENDED
"Mr. Chairman, the delegates
from the north would like to have
it written into the question before
the house, that labor to be drafted
should include all forms of labor,
which means management also."
Mr. Kessler would immediately
rise without any preparation what
soever, and defend the proposed
amendment. He would speak about
two minutes and would retire for
Mr. Church's rebuttal.
JUDGED BY PANEL
The delegates from the cast will
then offer an amendment and they
will be followed by those from the
south, then the west. The two
speakers will each speak for ap
proximately two minutes on the
pro and con respectively. Each
speech will be judged by a panel
of students representing every ma
jor nation on the globe. Before the
tontAston of the program, the
speakers will summarize their case
with a lengthy argument.
The chairman for the event will
be announced in Monday's Daily.
