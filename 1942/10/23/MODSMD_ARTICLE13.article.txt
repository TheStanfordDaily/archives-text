# Students' Help Asked in Union
## 
### 
Hoping to ease critical labor short
ages in the Cellar, Miss Christine
Ricker, director of dining halls, yes
terday appealed to Cellar patrons to
clear their own tables.
Students were urged to put their
dishes in the square receptacle in
the center of the Cellar on bus trays
provided for the purpose when they
leave.
"There is a real need for this serv
ice." Miss Ricker said, "and it is up
to the students to take it on and
take it seriously." She declared that
no bus boys would remove dishes
from the tables.
The Stanford War Board, headed
by Rosemary Cross, backed Miss
Ricker's plea arid urged that students
cooperate in keeping the Cellar open.
