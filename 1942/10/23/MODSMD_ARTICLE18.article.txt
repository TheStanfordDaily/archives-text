# Senate Kills Prohibition Amendment on 18-19 Draft Bill by a Vote of 49-25
## Refers Liquor Rider to Committee As Last Major Obstacle to Passage Of Conscription Measure Eliminated 
### 
WASHINGTON. Oct. 22 (U.R)—The one-man crusade of Sen. Josh
(I)., Okla.) to "dry up" army camps suffered a crushing setback tonight
when the Senate adopted an administration motion to refer his amendment
linking prohibition with the 'teen-age draft hill to the hostile Military

Affairs Committee.
The vote was 49 to 25.
The vote —on a motion by Demo
cratic Leader Alben W. Barkley
climaxed four hours of turbulent de
bate and removed the last major ob
stacle to passage, probably tomor
row, of the 18-19 conscription meas
ure.
FORCED ItOLL-CALL
The committee flatly rejected the
amendment at pre-debate hearings
and Lee, determined to force con
sideration by a roll-call vote, intro
duced it from the floor.
The roll-call would have had the:
effect of putting his colleagues on
record on prohibition in advance of
the Nov. 3 elections, a situation dis
tasteful to most of them.
The amendment, because of the
committee's antipathy, is certain to
be pigeon-holed. The maneuver,
however, does not prevent the Okla
homan from sponsoring a substitute
or introducing separate legislation.
THREAT TO MORALE
Barkley stepped into the broach
after high Army and Navy leaders,
including Secretary of War Henry
L. Stimson, undersecty. Robert P.
Patterson and Secty. of the Navy
Frank Knox denounced the measure
as a threat to the Army's and Navy's
morale.
Lee stood almost alone in his fight,
but he had outside support in the
Women' s Christian Temperance
Union and other dry organizations.
