# Red Relief Army Nears Stalingrad

### 
MOSCOW, Oct. 22 (UP). —Rus-
sian relief forces driving toward
Stalingrad under cover of a howl
ing winter wind carrying mixed
snow and rain have crashed through
the second line of German defenses
and captured a height commanding
a broad sweep of the city's north
westerly approaches, field dis
patches said tonight.
The bitter gales put a further
crimp in the German attacks which
for a full week had dwindled
steadily as exhaustion grew on the
siege army. Now the thrusts were
limited to narrow sectors, and they
had produced no appreciable gains
for four days.
The initiative appeared to be
weakening or slipping from the
German grasp in all the key sec
tors of the Volga-Caucasus front.
Front reports told of limited Red
Army successes in Stalingrad, the
big drive to the northwest, ag
gressive thrusts south of the city,
and defensive victories at both ends
of the Caucasus.
