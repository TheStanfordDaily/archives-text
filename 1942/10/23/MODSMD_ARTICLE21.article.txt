## 
### 
Headed by the passing combina
tion of Howie Dal 1 mar and Keith
Pinion, the Phi Psi's meet El Cua
dro today at 5 p.m. in the second
loUnd of intramural football.
Other games opening the second
round for teams in Leagues 1 and
2 pit El Toro against Page Mill,
Brainier against Los Arcos, and the
Co-ops against Theta Xi at 4. Delta
Up.silon meets the Med School and
Theta Chi plays SAE in two other
contests.
Last night's volleyball matches
were called off because of the rally
and will be played next week.
(A.K.L. boat Kappa Alpha Tues
day. The Daily misstated the re
sult and gave the win to K.A.)
One of today's best football games
should be Toro vs. Page Mill. The
soldiers defaulted their first start
last week and are an unknown fac
for while the Toros slammed Los
Arcos hard for a 25-0 victory.
Toro annexed a 7-0 win yesterday
over Breakers in a practice tilt.
The bull club's score came on a
nifty pass from George Tolman to
Tom Morton, who scored a sensa
tional catch on the play. Tolman
drof.kicked the extra point.
