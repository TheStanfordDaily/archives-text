## 
### 
£' ncling .o£f a last-minute rally,
Stanford's varsity water polo team
tucked in a 7-4 victory over San
Jose State yesterday and prepared
to eni age the U.S. Navy Pre-Flight
School mermen in a pair of practice
s tomorrow morning at Moraga.
Leading the Card point-makers
Was Captain Hadley Bacon, veteran
forward, who scored three goals.
Jack Carpenter, Emmett Cashin, A1
Weeden, and Dick Narver each
shoved in one score apiece to com
plete the Stanford scoring.
FIRST-QUARTER LEAD
Coach Ernie Brandsten's mermen
jumped into a 3-0 first-quarter lead,
increased it to 4-1 in the second per
iod. and then added another goal in
the third quarter.
Two scores by Bacon and Stan
lord had an apparently safe 7-1 lead,
but the Spartans shoved in three
quick goals in a rally ended by the
timer's gun.
Coach Brandsten particularly liked
the play of sophomores Weeden and
Narver and that of Captain Bacon.
"We made some mistakes." he said,
' but on the whole, we played pretty
well."
WIN OVER PRE-FLIGHT
The Indians hold a 4-2 win over
the Pre-Flight varsity and 7-6 over
the reserves. The Navy men have a
pair of strong players in Bob Keeler
and DeVere Christensen, former all
conference swimmer from U.C.L.A.
Brandsten plans to start a team of
Bacon, Cashin, and Bill Mapel, for
wards; Weeden and Narver, guards;
Jones, centerback; and Lee, goalie.
