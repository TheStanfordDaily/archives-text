# Huskies Practice For Bear Passes
## 
### 
SEATTLE. Oct. 22 (U.R)—Those 27
passes—lo of them complete for a
total of 158 yards—which the Cali
fornia Bears unleashed against
UCLA last Saturday have Coach
Ralph Welch and his University of
Washington squad concentrating on
air defense these days.
Welch gathered his regulars
around him today and read a few
significant statistics from the Bear-
Uclan game, and then sent them
into their second hard scrimmage
against California pass plays.
