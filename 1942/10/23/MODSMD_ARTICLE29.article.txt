# Southern California Seeking Revenge for 1940-41 Defeats
## 
### BILL CARTER 
Sports Editor. Daily Trojan
LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22—Open up that Golden Gate! Here they come,
those Rose Bowl-bound Trojans. Murder Stanford, revenge for the 1940
defeat and last year's humiliation.
That's the spirit around here as the varsity goes through the tapering
off process before hoarding the train for Kezar Stadium tomorrow.

A last minute change in plans was +
necessitated by the loss of Hal Finney
Mickey McCardle's substitute, who '
suffered a leg injury in Tuesday's '
varsity-frosh scrimmage. Jim Har
dy, a sophomore who has performed i
creditably in all of SC's starts, will
move into the halfback position.
A few starters still retain marks
from the Washington State victory, j
but nothing that will hinder them j
Saturday. Although the SC student
body is confident of a triumph, the i
team is reserved after Stanford's
showing against Idaho.
NEVER BEATEN T
Last week, the Cardinal and Gold j
gridders hit the victor's circle in no |
uncertain terms, annihilating unde- j
feated, untied Washington State, j
26-12.
SC has never beaten the T forma- i
tion, but Oct. 24 may be the day. J
With a bevy of broken-field runners !
and an excellent passing attack to j
choose from, Troy's attack may be
enough to overcome any defensive
disadvantage.
Leading the sudden-death run
runners is Mickey McCardle, SC's j
triple-threat star. After two dismal
showings, Mick threw two scoring j
passes against Ohio State, and j
chalked up runs of 51, 50, and 25
yards in the Cougar battle. The j
sophomore sensation also handles j
the punting duties when Ralph Hey- !
wood is resting on the sidelines.
NOT ONLY McCARDLE
You may say, "Stop McCardle and
you stop Troy." But this season, the
theory doesn't hold water. Howie j
Callanan, 9.6 hundred man. is dyna- '
mite when he holds the pigskin. His
average for the season is well above ;
the five-yard-per-crack mark.
Jack Trout, Bob Musiek. and Dar- j
rell Kroll do most of the plunging, j
and this trio makes the fullback spot
the strongest point in the lineup,
i Kroll is an ace on pass protection,
having eight interceptions to his
credit.
If it's a passing attack you want |
to see. watch McCardle, Tim Hardy,
! Paul Taylor, or Musick. All are ex- I
pert marksmen, and if the ends have
! recovered from last week's poor
| showing, action aplenty will come
| forth from this department.
NO WEAK SISTERS
The weak Trojan line is a thing of j
| the past. Although Cravath has lost j
j an even dozen tackles since spring
j practice, things look bright in the
forward wall, as the Washington and
Washington State games proved.

Adelman form a trio of hard-fighting
guards. All three were subs when
the season started, but showed so
much improvement that Cravath
was forced to demote Bill Noble and
Ron Thomas.
Steve Bianchi and Joe Wolf share
the center responsibilities, Steve op
erating in the first half, and Joe
working during the third and fourth
quarters. Wolf was a teammate of
A1 Hoisch at Los Angeles High
School.
EXAMS SCUTTLED
The Trojan caravan pulls out to
night minus the student special. But
a couple of hundred rooters, who
braved cutting exams will head north
on this morning's daylight, eager to
be in on the kill of the hated Indian.
Good luck to the Indians. After
you get through with us Saturday
you can come down and face our
litle cross-town friends who really
have a team.

Joe Davis and Ralph Heywood
rank among the best ends in the
business. Heywood is an excellent
punter, having an average. of 40
yards per kick. Backing these boys
up are Doug Eassick, a letterman,
and Pete McPhail, a Bay Area
product.

At the tackle slots, big Norm
\ Verry, who has only missed seven
j minutes in the first four games, is
ready for his part in a Stanford de
feat. Last week Washington State,
after failing to gain through Norm's
position, gave it up as a bad job in
the second half.
SLBS PROMOTED
Fred McCall is slated to start at
left tackle, but most of the heavy
j duty will be shouldered by Sy
| Fuhrman. Both tackles are con
sistent men, and Fuhrman turned in
his best Trojan performance last
week.

EXAMS SCUTTLED
The Trojan caravan pulls out to
night minus the student special. But
a couple of hundred rooters, who
braved cutting exams will head north
on this morning's daylight, eager to
be in on the kill of the hated Indian.
Good luck to the Indians. After
you get through with us Saturday
you can come down and face our
litle cross-town friends who really
have a team.

Joe Davis and Ralph Heywood
rank among the best ends in the
business. Heywood is an excellent
punter, having an average. of 40
yards per kick. Backing these boys
up are Doug Eassick, a letterman,
and Pete McPhail, a Bay Area
product.

At the tackle slots, big Norm
\ Verry, who has only missed seven
j minutes in the first four games, is
ready for his part in a Stanford de
feat. Last week Washington State,
after failing to gain through Norm's
position, gave it up as a bad job in
the second half.
SLBS PROMOTED
Fred McCall is slated to start at
left tackle, but most of the heavy
j duty will be shouldered by Sy
| Fuhrman. Both tackles are con
sistent men, and Fuhrman turned in
his best Trojan performance last
week.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22—Open up that Golden Gate! Here they come,
those Rose Bowl-bound Trojans. Murder Stanford, revenge for the 1940
defeat and last year's humiliation.
That's the spirit around here as the varsity goes through the tapering
off process before hoarding the train for Kezar Stadium tomorrow.

A last minute change in plans was +
necessitated by the loss of Hal Finney
Mickey McCardle's substitute, who '
suffered a leg injury in Tuesday's '
varsity-frosh scrimmage. Jim Har
dy, a sophomore who has performed i
creditably in all of SC's starts, will
move into the halfback position.
A few starters still retain marks
from the Washington State victory, j
but nothing that will hinder them j
Saturday. Although the SC student
body is confident of a triumph, the i
team is reserved after Stanford's
showing against Idaho.
NEVER BEATEN T
Last week, the Cardinal and Gold j
gridders hit the victor's circle in no |
uncertain terms, annihilating unde- j
feated, untied Washington State, j
26-12.
SC has never beaten the T forma- i
tion, but Oct. 24 may be the day. J
With a bevy of broken-field runners !
and an excellent passing attack to j
choose from, Troy's attack may be
enough to overcome any defensive
disadvantage.
Leading the sudden-death run
runners is Mickey McCardle, SC's j
triple-threat star. After two dismal
showings, Mick threw two scoring j
passes against Ohio State, and j
chalked up runs of 51, 50, and 25
yards in the Cougar battle. The j
sophomore sensation also handles j
the punting duties when Ralph Hey- !
wood is resting on the sidelines.
NOT ONLY McCARDLE
You may say, "Stop McCardle and
you stop Troy." But this season, the
theory doesn't hold water. Howie j
Callanan, 9.6 hundred man. is dyna- '
mite when he holds the pigskin. His
average for the season is well above ;
the five-yard-per-crack mark.
Jack Trout, Bob Musiek. and Dar- j
rell Kroll do most of the plunging, j
and this trio makes the fullback spot
the strongest point in the lineup,
i Kroll is an ace on pass protection,
having eight interceptions to his
credit.
If it's a passing attack you want |
to see. watch McCardle, Tim Hardy,
! Paul Taylor, or Musick. All are ex- I
pert marksmen, and if the ends have
! recovered from last week's poor
| showing, action aplenty will come
| forth from this department.
NO WEAK SISTERS
The weak Trojan line is a thing of j
| the past. Although Cravath has lost j
j an even dozen tackles since spring
j practice, things look bright in the
forward wall, as the Washington and
Washington State games proved.

Adelman form a trio of hard-fighting
guards. All three were subs when
the season started, but showed so
much improvement that Cravath
was forced to demote Bill Noble and
Ron Thomas.
Steve Bianchi and Joe Wolf share

erating in the first half, and Joe

You may say, "Stop McCardle and
you stop Troy." But this season, the
theory doesn't hold water. Howie j
Callanan, 9.6 hundred man. is dyna- '
mite when he holds the pigskin. His
average for the season is well above ;
the five-yard-per-crack mark.
Jack Trout, Bob Musiek. and Dar- j
rell Kroll do most of the plunging, j
and this trio makes the fullback spot
the strongest point in the lineup,
i Kroll is an ace on pass protection,
having eight interceptions to his
credit.
If it's a passing attack you want |
to see. watch McCardle, Tim Hardy,
! Paul Taylor, or Musick. All are ex- I
pert marksmen, and if the ends have
! recovered from last week's poor
| showing, action aplenty will come
| forth from this department.
NO WEAK SISTERS
The weak Trojan line is a thing of j
| the past. Although Cravath has lost j
j an even dozen tackles since spring
j practice, things look bright in the
forward wall, as the Washington and
Washington State games proved.

Adelman form a trio of hard-fighting
guards. All three were subs when
the season started, but showed so
much improvement that Cravath
was forced to demote Bill Noble and
Ron Thomas.
Steve Bianchi and Joe Wolf share
the center responsibilities, Steve op
erating in the first half, and Joe
working during the third and fourth
quarters. Wolf was a teammate of
A1 Hoisch at Los Angeles High
School.
EXAMS SCUTTLED
The Trojan caravan pulls out to
night minus the student special. But
a couple of hundred rooters, who
braved cutting exams will head north
on this morning's daylight, eager to
be in on the kill of the hated Indian.
Good luck to the Indians. After
you get through with us Saturday
you can come down and face our
litle cross-town friends who really
have a team.

Joe Davis and Ralph Heywood
rank among the best ends in the
business. Heywood is an excellent
punter, having an average. of 40
yards per kick. Backing these boys
up are Doug Eassick, a letterman,
and Pete McPhail, a Bay Area
product.

At the tackle slots, big Norm
\ Verry, who has only missed seven
j minutes in the first four games, is
ready for his part in a Stanford de
feat. Last week Washington State,
after failing to gain through Norm's
position, gave it up as a bad job in
the second half.
SLBS PROMOTED
Fred McCall is slated to start at
left tackle, but most of the heavy
j duty will be shouldered by Sy
| Fuhrman. Both tackles are con
sistent men, and Fuhrman turned in
his best Trojan performance last
week.

LOS ANGELES, Oct. 22—Open up that Golden Gate! Here they come,
those Rose Bowl-bound Trojans. Murder Stanford, revenge for the 1940
defeat and last year's humiliation.
That's the spirit around here as the varsity goes through the tapering
off process before hoarding the train for Kezar Stadium tomorrow.

A last minute change in plans was +
necessitated by the loss of Hal Finney
Mickey McCardle's substitute, who '
suffered a leg injury in Tuesday's '
varsity-frosh scrimmage. Jim Har
dy, a sophomore who has performed i
creditably in all of SC's starts, will
move into the halfback position.
A few starters still retain marks
from the Washington State victory, j
but nothing that will hinder them j
Saturday. Although the SC student
body is confident of a triumph, the i
team is reserved after Stanford's
showing against Idaho.
NEVER BEATEN T
Last week, the Cardinal and Gold j
gridders hit the victor's circle in no |
uncertain terms, annihilating unde- j
feated, untied Washington State, j
26-12.
SC has never beaten the T forma- i
tion, but Oct. 24 may be the day. J
With a bevy of broken-field runners !
and an excellent passing attack to j
choose from, Troy's attack may be
enough to overcome any defensive
disadvantage.
Leading the sudden-death run
runners is Mickey McCardle, SC's j
triple-threat star. After two dismal
showings, Mick threw two scoring j
passes against Ohio State, and j
chalked up runs of 51, 50, and 25
yards in the Cougar battle. The j
sophomore sensation also handles j
the punting duties when Ralph Hey- !
wood is resting on the sidelines.
