# Stanford Girl, Chinese Fliers, Work Together
## Aviators From China Are Highly Praised By Janice La Prade 
### LUCY THOMPSON 
Chinese aviation cadets are "the
best, cleanest, nicest bovs I've ever
met," according to Janice LaPrade,
and she ought to know because she
worked with 53 of them for a month
this summer.
Officially, Janice, who is foot
ball-player Loren LaPrade's little
sister, was secretary to Lt. Col,
Kanaga and Major Yang, who head
ed one of the Chinese Units in Ari
zona. Unofficially, Janice did a little
of everything not connected with the
actual planes, including even in
terpreting sometimes.
"You see, we have to teach them
everything, English, math, physics,
American customs, military customs,
as well as flying. But they learn
quickly, just like that," she said,
snapping her fingers, "and they go
through in the same time the' Ame
ricans take."
STUDENTS SELECTED
"They're intelligent, they have to
be to get over here because only the
best ones are selected to come, and
they have to be physically almost
perfect as well. They had to march
500 miles on foot with everything
on their backs to get out of China
on their way over here."
"They are military, much more
military than our boys ever think
of being. They are more awake to
what is going on in the world.
They're more courteous, too. Every
time I turned around they bowed
and saluted. I just saluted right
back."
Janice didn't speak Chinese when
she started to work there, but some
ol the interpreters started teaching
her Chinese in between teaching the
cadets English, and she ran off the
daily dictionary, which was a sheet
with American flight terms trans
kited into Chinese, on the mimeo
graph machine.
NEWSPAPERS IN CHINESE
But even so, "it was awful, every
one was speaking Chinese but me.
Even the newspapers were Chinese."
Once she had to sort out pages of
Chinese writing to get the dupli
cate copies together. "I just picked
out a character'l thought I could
recognize and went through the pile
trying to lind all of the ones with
that character in the same place. I
got a headache."
The unit of cadets she was with
was in its pre-flight training. Later
they will go on to primary, basic and
advanced training. They they will
be sent to an American squadron
for a while, either in Arizona or in
the East.
SENSE OF lIUMOR
"They alwaVs looked so shiny,
like they had just been scrubbed
hard, and they always had a big grin
on their faces."
"The Chinese have a marvelous
sense of humor, but you have to
know when to joke and when not to
joke. You see, they put American
women on a plane a little below
them. You have to prÂ»ve yourself,
but when you do there isn't any
thing they won't do for you."
The cadets have two periods of
physical training a day, but they
love American swimming pools.
"When they get back to China they're
all going to build swimming pools,"
she concluded.
