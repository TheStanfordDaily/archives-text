# Cal Students Throw Fruit; Few Pickers
## 
### 
The California student body is be
ing naughty bad again.
They just won't take this war ser
iously. And the Daily Californian's
editorial column gave them an awful
scolding the other day. So they had
better be good now—or else.
The whole thing started with an
attempt to recruit some fruit pickers
from among the Bears. Twelve
crates of spoiled fruit were put on
display on the Cal campus to im
press the students with the fact that
it was spoiling in the fields.
Placing crates of spoiled fruit in
front of the Cal student body is
nothing but murder, brother,
M-U-R-D-E-R! A pitched battle
resulted, strewing the mud flats and
Cal students with slightly spoiled
tomatoes, et al.
So now somebody is busy trying
to think up a recruiting stunt that
won't be quite so messy.
