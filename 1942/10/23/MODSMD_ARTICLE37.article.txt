announcement from the Stanford
War Board.
In explaining the War and Peace

Chairman Dick McClure declared,
j "The purpose of this committee is
to encourage spontaneous campus
5 discussions on any and all topics."
"If anybody wants to let off steam
on some subject," continued Mc-
Clure, "all he has to do is see Jim
{ Kessler or myself and we'll arrange
{ for a discussion group. And if the
| person thinks there should be a little
I technical light thrown on the mat
i ter we'll invite a professor to sit in
j with us."
DUTIES OP" COMMITTEE
"Our committee," explained Mc-
Clure, "is not just another commit
tee, but rather it is a mere admin-
I istrative organ. All we do is ar
range the place, time and date and
any other details."
It was also explained that the SWB
has in its office lists of magazines
and pamphlets which may be help
j ful to persons interested in war and
| post-war peace problems for refer
| ence purposes.
INFORMAL SETUP
"One last thing," concluded Mc-
J Clure, "I'd like to stress that this
[ setup is not formal by any means.
| To be successful it must be informal
I and spontaneous."
j The committee held five experi
; mental meetings Summer Quarter
| and has held one meeting so far this
! quarter on the Russian question.
