# Ten Women To Tell Job Experiences
## 
### 
Ten women were named yester-
S day by Women's Vocom to present
I five-minute talks on their summer
! jobs at Vocom's Summer Job meet
ing which has been moved from
Oct. 28 to Nov. 4.
In addition to relating their ex
j periences, each speaker who was
| chosen by the Summer Job Commit
| tee, headed by Helen Knight, will
emphasize the college courses which
aided her in her work.
All Stanford women are invited to
attend the meeting and may ques
tion the speakers after their talks.
Vocom approved the suggestion of
| Miss Anastasia Doyle, sponsor of
Vocom, that WAACS, WAVES;.
WAAFS, and other such organiza
tions be discussed at a future meet
ing. Nov. 11, Armistice Day, was
i set as the date for such a meeting,
for which representatives of various
women's war services will be invited
j to speak.
In order to publicize the physical
therapy course for war service, a
| committee was formed which will
i seek prospects for this course. The
course, which consists of highly
specialized instruction in nutrition,
| home economics, and euthenics of
better living, requires many science
fulfillments.
Virginia Stoddard, chairman of
Vocom, announced the "Y" would
offer all possible help with this plan.
