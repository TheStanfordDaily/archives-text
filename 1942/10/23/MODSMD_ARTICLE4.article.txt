# 'Rose Bowl Fever' Seizes Stanford Gridders at Rally
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
"We're looking forward to spending Christmas vacation in Huntington
Hotel in Los Angeles,*' said big Hank Norberg, impromptu speaker at
last night's frenzied Pajamarino rally in the Pavilion.
Called from the ranks of the Stanford football team by popular
acclaim, Big Hank, first string end, expressed the dreams of Farm foot-

ball fanatics, Rose Bowl-conscious i
after last Saturday's 54-7 touch
i down parade over Idaho.
He re-echoed the words of his
coach, handsome Marchie Schwartz,
who declared, "I'd hate to be on the
Southern California football team
the way the boys feel now. U.S.C.
is plenty good but we've got the
spirit to win."
j PLENTY OF SPIRIT
It was the same old Pajamarino,
fewer freshmen, but lots of enthu
siasm from rally-starved Stanford
ites. There was no slogan to fol
low, "Roar with '44" or "Jive with
'45," but their "Strong as oxes, hard
as bricks; Stanford, Stanford, forty
six"—was a capable substitute.
But the war was not forgotten. It
appeared in the popularity of the
martial songs, and feature speaker
Harry Maloney, grizzled veteran of
two wars and Stanford's oldest
coach in line of service, struck
home when he said, "As Stanford
men and women, you will do well
to put yourself in a sttae of mind
I and body ready to be called when
I your country needs you."
Support your team and the great
• athletic reputation of Stanford, but
| remember that football now is just
| part of the preparation for an even
! greater battle, emphasized Maloney.
PARADE DOWN ROW
As in past years, howling fresh-
I men in their many-hued pajamas
assembled at the Fiji house and
followed the band down the famed
Stanford Row, while the rest of the
[ campus howled its disapproval.
Led by a screaming infant in a
baby bonnet and night shirt on a
bed supported by stalwart frosh,
I they poured into the gym and
j yelled f6r Stanford and for their
■ team; listened with enthusiasm to
Coach Marchie, with admiration to
Ed Stamm, and with respect to
Coach Maloney.
Afterward, they serenaded Roble,
i accompanied by a few firecrackers
i and water bags, and then left for
the Varsity Theater and a movie.
Rally Com Co-chairman Jim Mc-
Brier pronounced himself very well
| satisfied with the rally and empha
i sized that all men wear their root
i ers' caps and white shirts, and
I women carry pompoms at tomor
i row's game. Pompoms will be par
ticularly important since stunts with
pompoms will replace the card
stunts of the past, he said.

PARADE DOWN ROW
As in past years, howling fresh-
I men in their many-hued pajamas
assembled at the Fiji house and
followed the band down the famed
Stanford Row, while the rest of the
[ campus howled its disapproval.
Led by a screaming infant in a
baby bonnet and night shirt on a
bed supported by stalwart frosh,
I they poured into the gym and
j yelled f6r Stanford and for their
■ team; listened with enthusiasm to
Coach Marchie, with admiration to
Ed Stamm, and with respect to
Coach Maloney.
Afterward, they serenaded Roble,
i accompanied by a few firecrackers
i and water bags, and then left for
the Varsity Theater and a movie.
Rally Com Co-chairman Jim Mc-
Brier pronounced himself very well
| satisfied with the rally and empha
i sized that all men wear their root
i ers' caps and white shirts, and
I women carry pompoms at tomor
i row's game. Pompoms will be par
ticularly important since stunts with
pompoms will replace the card
stunts of the past, he said.
"We're looking forward to spending Christmas vacation in Huntington
Hotel in Los Angeles,*' said big Hank Norberg, impromptu speaker at
last night's frenzied Pajamarino rally in the Pavilion.
Called from the ranks of the Stanford football team by popular
acclaim, Big Hank, first string end, expressed the dreams of Farm foot-

ball fanatics, Rose Bowl-conscious i
after last Saturday's 54-7 touch
i down parade over Idaho.
He re-echoed the words of his
coach, handsome Marchie Schwartz,
who declared, "I'd hate to be on the
Southern California football team
the way the boys feel now. U.S.C.
is plenty good but we've got the
spirit to win."
j PLENTY OF SPIRIT
It was the same old Pajamarino,
fewer freshmen, but lots of enthu
siasm from rally-starved Stanford
ites. There was no slogan to fol
low, "Roar with '44" or "Jive with
'45," but their "Strong as oxes, hard
as bricks; Stanford, Stanford, forty
six"—was a capable substitute.
But the war was not forgotten. It
appeared in the popularity of the
martial songs, and feature speaker
Harry Maloney, grizzled veteran of
two wars and Stanford's oldest
coach in line of service, struck
home when he said, "As Stanford
men and women, you will do well
to put yourself in a sttae of mind
I and body ready to be called when
I your country needs you."
