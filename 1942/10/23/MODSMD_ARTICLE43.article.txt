# Y.W.C.A. Service Set for Sunday
## 
### 
The annual Y.W.C.A. service in |
recognition of the organization's
new members will be held this Sun
day in Memorial Chapel.
With reports from living groups
still coming in, the Y last night had j
! reached a membership high of 353
! and is expecting 400 before Sunday.
So far Adelpha in Lagunita has
the greatest number of members,
while Hawthorne, surprisingly
enough, has a membership of 108
per cent. Gamma Phi with 20 worn- '
en in the Y is tops for houses on the I
Row.
The Y is especially proud of the
154 women who have joined from
j Roble and represent the largest
| freshman membership group in over |
| a decade.
The Sunday service has been
planned by Charlotte Jackson in
collaboration with Dr. Thomas Oli
ver, acting chaplain. Members of the
Y will read the Litany and scrip- ;
tures for the service.
