# Exchange Dinners
## 
### 
MANY persons have been misinformed as
to Excom's stand on the granting of dates.
This was clarified and revised Wednesday
night, but there is one point which should be
remembered by all living groups. Dates are no
longer necessary for exchange dinners. The
only restriction is that they must close by 8 p.m.
This saves a lot of red tape, and will probably
encourage many more of these evening get
togethers.

The canneries still need workers; the wal
nut qrowers need help; there are box cars to
be loaded in San Francisco. In other words,
there is lots that Stanford students can do
this week-end to help bring victory.
