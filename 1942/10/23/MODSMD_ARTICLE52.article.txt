The Kditor, Sir:
M\ room-male and I holli live quite a distance
avvav from (lie campus, lie lives in Idaho, and I
live in Indiana. Ihe proposed < aneeliii" of the
Christmas \acations would prexenl holli of it
from going home, prohahlv our last clianee until
the end of the summer.
It is our thought that if the Thanksgiving and
Spring \aeations were canceled. 12 davs would
he gained. This would make it possible to com
mence the vacation a week earlier, and to cud it a
Week later.
We hclieve that there are many others on the
campus who are in the same position ;i- v\e are. I
know that all o! these who live at a distance from
the campus would he plad to forfeit their I hank*-
giv imii and spring v,n ations, in older tluit thev
niiiiht he ahle to vi-it their homes before the end
o! the summer. l,eHo\ li Ihown.
