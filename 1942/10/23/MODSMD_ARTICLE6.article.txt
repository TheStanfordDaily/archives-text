# Monday Set For Tryouts In Gaieties
## 
### 
Gaieties acting tryouts will be
held Monday evening between 7
and 10 in Memorial Auditorium,
Director Bob O'Neill announced,
wilh a special request that fresh
men and transfers appear and dem
onstrate their talents.
"The Gaieties of 1935 were a suc
cess mainly through the efforts of
freshmen, and we feel there's lots
of undiscovered talent lying idle,"
he remarked.
Actual production .skits, termed
"riotous" by Ram's Head big-wigs,
will be used for the tryouts.
COMICS NEEDED
"Comics, both m. and f„ are nat
urally most important, but there are
.lust as many straight acting parts
in the Gaieties, so everyone, re
gardless of particular talents, has
a good chance of being an impor
tant part of a show that promises
more sparkling humor and terrific
music than any within the last five
years." the director said, unbiascd
ly, of course.
Taking acting parts in the Gaie
ties is one of the main aspects of
group participation in rolling up
points for the Ram's Head plaque,
awarded to the organization having
the most persons in the show.
NEED FOR PUIXIIRITUDE
In the myriad spots for actors is
a definite need for pulchrilude on
the stage, which has not yet been
adequately fulfilled. As John Bou
cher, who has inherited the title of
campus funny-man, neatly put it,
"In wartime we need beauty—for
morale."
Despite a slow and misleading
beginning, the Gaieties is now roll
ing along at a rollicking clip, and
production officials see the out
look growing increasingly brighter.
"The campus has brought forth
some of the most brilliant produc
tion possibilities in skits, .special
ties. and staged musical numbers
this staff of old-timers has ever
seen," quoth O'Neill.
