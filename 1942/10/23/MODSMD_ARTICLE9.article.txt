RUN BY CARDINALS
Cardinals were made responsible
for running the Nitery by Excom in
its meeting Wednesday night. Ver
nice Hines and Bill Moran made ar
rangements to open the Nitery, and
brought the matter before Cardinals
for its approval.
The need for a center for informal
entertainment to keep students on
the campus at nights became acute
with the closing of the Cellar at 8
p.m., Miss Hines said. Students are
expected to use it as a place to get
cokes after the Cellar closes or after
studying at the Libe.
The Nitery lounge has been open j
for student use before, but the coke
machine was not installed until last
nit>ht, and the juke-box not until
tonight. Cardinal plans include re- !
decorating the lounge.
COOPERATION ASKED
Cooperation is urged by Student '
Manager Moran in keeping hours \
posted on the juke box and in re
turning empty coke bottles. "Tam
pering with either the coke machine !
or the juke box is a Men's Council !
offense." Moran declared. He said
both would be removed at any sign
of damage.
Moran also issued a call for stu
dents interested in employment
cleaning up the Nitery to see him in
the A.S.S.U. office.
