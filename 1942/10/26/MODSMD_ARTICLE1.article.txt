# New Dim-Out Regulations Go Into Force Last Night; Stanford Campus Warned
## Students Asked to Observe Rules; Window Blinds Must He Shielded To Level of Lowest Light in Room 
### 
New Army dim-out regulations went into effect Saturday midnight on
the Stanford campus, in accordance with a proclamation of the Western
Defense Command.
Every student is involved. The following eight rules should he followed
closely:

1. Don't forget to draw your win
dow blinds down to the level of the
lowest light within the room at
night. Venetian blinds should have
their vanes pointed downward to
the outside. If you have no shades
or blinds on your windows, you
should shield lights on the window
side with opaque material so that no
light goes outdoors.
2. Don't forget to shield your
porch, garage and other outside
lights. All lights must shine down
ward.
OUTDOOR LIGHTS
3. Don't permit any light to shine
outside your home or business
greater than one-foot candle power
on the grounds or sidewalk. One
foot candle power is about the same
as the light from ordinary street
lights.
4. Don't forget that all outdoor
light signs are barred. Interior signs
must be shielded down to the level
of the bottom light bulb or neon or
fluorescent tube.
5. Don't forget that skylights must
be covered. No light may shine up
ward.
SPECIAL ZONES
6. Don't forget that there are spe
cial restrictions for those areas vis
ible from the sea, requiring dimmed
headlights on cars. No exposed
lights are permitted seaward.
7. Don't forget that Proclamation
No. 12 (new dim-out regulations)
affects all lights within the zone of
restricted lighting in California,
Oregon, and Washington. Ignorance
is no excuse. Maps are available
from your air raid warden or local
defense council.
8. Don't wait for a police officer
to inform you of your dim-out vio
lations. You will be arrested and
fined if you do.
These regulations will remain in
effect for the duration, unless altered
by the Defense Command.
