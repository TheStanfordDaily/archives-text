# Trojan Upset Boosts Cardinal Victory Spirit
## 
### 
All was glorious football madness and Rose Bowl fever as Saturday's
locker room gang rang out (he aftermath of a thrilling 14-6 Stanford vic
tory over favored Southern California. Coach Marchic Schwartz had more
smiles than usual, and big Charles "Red" Taylor had the biggest of cm all
—you remember, he was the man who stole the ball from Mickey McCardle
and romped over the goal line for +

the Indians' second touchdown.
Taylor, who's been a non-titled [
ail-American for three years any- j
way, grabbed the pigskin and tallied j
in a heads-up play that should tip j
off the experts to their first-string
left guard position on the 1942 na
tional choice list.
Buck Fawcett, Stanford's offen
sive spearhead, has an injured nerve j
in that ailing ankle of his. Buck i
said he heard something go "pop"
when he was hit hard in the" fourth
quarter, but apparently it was only
a nerve popping off a little. Buck is
okeh.
CRAV ATI I IRKEI)
Jeff Cravath, the Trojan coach,
was slightly irked at the decision on
Taylor's touchdown. Cravath said he
thought McCardle's forward prog
ress had been stopped but Taylor's
hadn't! McCardle was definitely still
trying to duck out from under Hank
Norberg's bear hug when Taylor
took the ball and made for pay dirt.
Norberg played a crashing game,
worried Troy's passers no end, and
came out of the fray solid as a rock.
Roger Laverty, Norberg's partner at
right end, couldn't be fooled after he
once got on to the Trojan's end runs
and stopped the Southern California
ball carriers cold.
LINE OUTSTANDING
No one in the magnificent Stan
ford line can be singled out unless
it is Taylor for his smartness in do
ing something that has only been
done once before in Coast football
history, or Bruno Banducci, who
Dlayed the game of his life, probably
the best since his sophomore year.
As for the others, Ed Stamm,
Loren LaPrade, and Milt Vucinich—
they were all one could ask for. The
much-talked-about line proved be
yond a doubt that Stanford must
have the best forwards in the con
ference, bar none.
FRISBEE SHIFTED
Stanford used four tackles, four
guards, four ends, one center, and a
single backfield replacement, Ben
Morrison.
Schwartz said last night hr
planned to put Bob Frlsbee at left
half, holding Ross Dana. Al Hoiseh.
and Don Zappettini in reserve. Fris

son got under way and is now ready
to play after being sidelined with a
shoulder injury. He will also play J

1 fine minutes they were. Hammett j

j Southern California's 30. which J

went unscouted as far as UCLA is
concerned for next Saturday.

All was glorious football madness and Rose Bowl fever as Saturday's
locker room gang rang out (he aftermath of a thrilling 14-6 Stanford vic
tory over favored Southern California. Coach Marchic Schwartz had more
smiles than usual, and big Charles "Red" Taylor had the biggest of cm all
—you remember, he was the man who stole the ball from Mickey McCardle
and romped over the goal line for +

the Indians' second touchdown.
Taylor, who's been a non-titled [
ail-American for three years any- j
way, grabbed the pigskin and tallied j
in a heads-up play that should tip j
off the experts to their first-string
left guard position on the 1942 na
tional choice list.
Buck Fawcett, Stanford's offen
sive spearhead, has an injured nerve j
in that ailing ankle of his. Buck i
said he heard something go "pop"
when he was hit hard in the" fourth
quarter, but apparently it was only
a nerve popping off a little. Buck is
okeh.
CRAV ATI I IRKEI)
Jeff Cravath, the Trojan coach,
was slightly irked at the decision on
Taylor's touchdown. Cravath said he
thought McCardle's forward prog
ress had been stopped but Taylor's
hadn't! McCardle was definitely still
trying to duck out from under Hank
Norberg's bear hug when Taylor
took the ball and made for pay dirt.
Norberg played a crashing game,
worried Troy's passers no end, and
came out of the fray solid as a rock.
Roger Laverty, Norberg's partner at
right end, couldn't be fooled after he
once got on to the Trojan's end runs
and stopped the Southern California
ball carriers cold.
LINE OUTSTANDING
No one in the magnificent Stan
ford line can be singled out unless
it is Taylor for his smartness in do
ing something that has only been
done once before in Coast football
history, or Bruno Banducci, who
Dlayed the game of his life, probably
the best since his sophomore year.
As for the others, Ed Stamm,
Loren LaPrade, and Milt Vucinich—
they were all one could ask for. The
much-talked-about line proved be
yond a doubt that Stanford must
have the best forwards in the con
ference, bar none.
FRISBEE SHIFTED
Stanford used four tackles, four
guards, four ends, one center, and a
single backfield replacement, Ben
Morrison.
