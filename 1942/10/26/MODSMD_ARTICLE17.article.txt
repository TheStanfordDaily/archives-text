WASHINGTON, Oct. 25 (U.R)—Ad
ministration leaders, still holding
faint hope for final action on the
'teen-age draft bill befoi'e the No
vember elections, tonight foresaw a
"good chance" that Senate-House
conferees will eliminate a contro
j versial amendment requiring one
! year's pre-combat training for 18
| and 19-year-old soldiers.
The restriction, proposed by Sen.
Lee O'Daniel (D., Tex.) was adopted
by a 39-31 vote in the Senate despite
vigorous opposition from President
Roosevelt and his high military
command.
Congressional chieftains pointed
out that the House once rejected a
; similar proposal and that all five
i senators named to the conference
committee voted against it in the
upper chamber.
The House is expected to send the
j Bill to conference tomorrow but final
| action appeared doubtful until after
the Nov. 3 congressional elections.
Only a "corporal's guard" of House
members are in town and a quorum
call at any stage of final proceedings
would put off a decision until a ma
jority can be summoned back.
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barklcy of Kentucky promised ev
i cry effort to speed final action, but
the three House leaders who will
handle the bill—Speaker Sam Ray
burn (D., Tex.), Majority John W.
McCormack (D.. Mass.), and Chair
man Andrew J. May (D.. Ky.), of the
i Military Affairs Committee — were
reported "out of the city."
One or more, however, may return
! tomorrow, when the bill is sched
uled to go to conference. May prob
ably will head the House conferees.
Besides the compulsory training
restriction, the Senate also wrote in
a plan by Sen. Millard E. Tydings
(D., Md.) to defer farmers and farm
labor from army service, wherever
their induction would curtail agri
cultural production, until replace
l ments can be found.

The restriction, proposed by Sen.
Lee O'Daniel (D., Tex.) was adopted
by a 39-31 vote in the Senate despite
vigorous opposition from President
Roosevelt and his high military
command.
Congressional chieftains pointed
out that the House once rejected a
; similar proposal and that all five
i senators named to the conference
committee voted against it in the
upper chamber.
The House is expected to send the
j Bill to conference tomorrow but final
| action appeared doubtful until after
the Nov. 3 congressional elections.
Only a "corporal's guard" of House
members are in town and a quorum
call at any stage of final proceedings
would put off a decision until a ma
jority can be summoned back.
Senate Majority Leader Alben W.
Barklcy of Kentucky promised ev
i cry effort to speed final action, but
the three House leaders who will
handle the bill—Speaker Sam Ray
burn (D., Tex.), Majority John W.
McCormack (D.. Mass.), and Chair
man Andrew J. May (D.. Ky.), of the
i Military Affairs Committee — were
reported "out of the city."
One or more, however, may return
! tomorrow, when the bill is sched
uled to go to conference. May prob
ably will head the House conferees.
Besides the compulsory training
restriction, the Senate also wrote in
a plan by Sen. Millard E. Tydings
(D., Md.) to defer farmers and farm
labor from army service, wherever
their induction would curtail agri
cultural production, until replace
l ments can be found.
