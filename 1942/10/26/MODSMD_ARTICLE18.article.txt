### 
CAIRO, Oct. 25 (UP). â€”Allied desert troops hurled hack the first enemy
counter-attacks in the new battle for North Africa today and pressed on
through the barbed wire and mine fields of the El Alamein line while
United States. British and South African planes routed the Nazis from the
sky and British submarines reported torpedoing 12 more ships in the
Mediterranean.
Repercussions of the battle raging on a 40-mile stretch of desert be-

tween the Mediterranean and the
Qattara salt bogs were rocking all
of western Europe as giant RAF
bombers based in Britain raced
across the Alps four times in three
days to blast the industries and
ports of northern Italy, which sup
ply the Axis armies in Egypt.
U.S. fliers had their biggest day
so far in Africa Saturday, bombing
and shooting up Axis troop camps,
gun emplacements and motor car
avans, and by dusk smoke rose 3,000
feet in the air from blazing ammu
nition dumps, tanks, trucks and oil
depots. German and Italian planes
were scarce and reluctant to accept
battle. Only one enemy plane was
shot down all day. Enemy anti
aircraft fire was fierce, however,
and the Allies lost 12 planes over
the desert and Malta,
A communique said that Allied
shock troops who blasted their way
through some of the main Axis po
sitions in their first assaults Friday
night had "maintained our gains
despite enemy counter-attacks" Sat
urday, and that "fighting continues."
Meanwhile the British Admiralty
announced in London that subma
rines of the Mediterranean fleet
sank five more Italian supply ships,
probably sank a destroyer and an
armed merchant cruiser, and dam
aged five more supply ships. The
Admiralty said 24 enemy ships have
been sunk or damaged by subma
rines in that area this month.
Air battles of "maximum inten
sity" are raging over the desert
front, today's communique re
ported. It said "the whole opera
tions are covered by strong fighter
sweeps and little enemy opposition
is reported." Of the 12 Allied planes
shot down, the crews of two bomb
ers and the pilots of four fighters
were reported saved.
