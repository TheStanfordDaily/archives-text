MOSCOW, Monday, Oct. 20 (UP).
—German assault troops captured
two streets in the factory area of
North Stalingrad Sunday while a
Russian relief army bearing down
from the northwest swept through
an inhabited locality and seized a
stronghold where 3,000 German
dead were found lying in trenches
and dugouts, the high command an
nounced today.
Numerous assaults inside the city
were beaten back, one Soviet unit
withstanding five successive at
tacks without giving ground, but
the Germans drove ahead with a
now burst of fury and "at a price
of heavy losses succeeded in oc
cupying two streets of the factory
settlement," the midnight commu
nique reported. It was the third
day of a new Stalingrad offensive
which cost the Nazis 9,000 men the
first two days.
Northwest of Stalingrad, the com
munique said, the Red Army force
which captured the inhabited lo
cality killed 600 Rumanians and
captured many prisoners. Another
Russian unit stormed the strong
hold and came upon the heaps of
Nazi dead after repulsing a counter
attack.
The Russians occupied the corpse
choked trenches where the Germans
evidently had dug in to spend the
winter on the steppes that soon will
be swept by blizzards.
