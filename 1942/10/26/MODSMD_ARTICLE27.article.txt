# Mural Howling With 220 Game
## 
### 
Alpha Sigma Phi's Joe Byrne led the field with a 220 high game as intra
mural bowling got under way yesterday at the Indian Bowl.
Byrne's effort brought the Alpha Sigs into a four-way tic with the S.A.E..
Fiji, and I'rosh quintets, each of whom wiuv three and dropped one.
The highly touted Bianner team failed to get rolling untii the issue was

already settled by the Sigs. The
I Frosh contingent, led by Alan
Baldwin's 201 total, dropped the first
[ game to Toyon, but overhauled them
in the next two encounters.
Bill Harms with 203, second high
j est score of the day. helped the Fijis
j smother the Beta five into submis
! sion, while S.A.E. trounced Sigma
! Nu.
Beginning next Sunday the teams
will work under the handicap sys
| tern, thus giving the weaker teams a
| better chance to win. The handicaps
will be figured by teking the indi
| vidual bowler's average for the
three games yesterday and taking
two-thirds the difference between
, his average and 200.
The league will continue for a
period of 21 weeks, after which the
\ winning team will be presented with
. a trophy.
