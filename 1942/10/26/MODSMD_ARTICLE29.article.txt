# Farm Swordsmen Downed by Funke
## 
### 
Battling a far more experienced
team, Stanford's fencers were de
feated by the Funke Fencing Acad
emy 20-5 at Encina Gym, Friday
night.
"The Funke team is a loosely
knit organization composed of men
who have been fencing many years,"
explained Coach Elwyn Bugge.
"They don't have any eligibility
rules which keeps the two best
fencers at school off our team," he
said.
The fact that the Funke team in
cludes a former member of an
American Olympic fencing team
presents some notion of their ex
perience. Coach Bugge said Funke
would probably take the Herron
Trophy.
Alan Hedden led the Stanford
team, composed of first and second
year men. with two victories in his
five matches. Harvard Lomax, John
Carr, and Bill Perkins contributed
one victory each to the Indians'
score. Jack Reese was the other
Stanford fencer, but was unable to
tally.
An average door pull contains
enough copper to make one shell
case for a 37-mm. anti-tank gun.
