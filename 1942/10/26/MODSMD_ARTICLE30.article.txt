### ED LUCE 
High and mighty Phi Psi toppled
from intramural gridiron heights
Friday when battery mates Bob Fair
and Bob Hughey and their El Cuadro
teammates turned the trick, 20-19
in the "thrillingest" game of the yet
young competition.
Three times Fair rifled lengthy
heaves which Hughey, after maneu
vering behind a supposedly strong
Phi Psi secondary, grabbed for
touchdowns. Conversions on pass
plays following the last two tallies
gave Cuadro their one point margin.
Except for Fair's and Hughey's
"Albert-to-Kmetovic" act, the game
was all Phi Psi. After passing for
Cuadro's first touchdown. Fair
kicked off to Phi Psi's Athertonized
captain Bill Nourse, who took the
ball near the sidelines and with
Howie Dal 1 mar booming Hughey out
of the way, went some 60 yards to
score. . Dalfmar converted from
placement.
El Cuadro came right back in the
second half and before Phi Psi
could get its pass defense organized,

I had executed a couple of Fair to
Hughey touchdown aerials, both
| converted on passes to make the
J score 20-7.
P x hi Psi scored twice late in the
game on passes from Keith Pinion
to Johnny Malloy and Ralph Kie
wiet. Cuadro's rushing of Dallmar
on his tries for conversions, forcing
the big end to kick wide, left Fair,
Hughey and Co. still on top, how
ever.

Three times Fair rifled lengthy
heaves which Hughey, after maneu
vering behind a supposedly strong
Phi Psi secondary, grabbed for
touchdowns. Conversions on pass
plays following the last two tallies
gave Cuadro their one point margin.
Except for Fair's and Hughey's
"Albert-to-Kmetovic" act, the game
was all Phi Psi. After passing for
Cuadro's first touchdown. Fair
kicked off to Phi Psi's Athertonized
captain Bill Nourse, who took the
ball near the sidelines and with
Howie Dal 1 mar booming Hughey out
of the way, went some 60 yards to
score. . Dalfmar converted from
placement.
El Cuadro came right back in the
second half and before Phi Psi
could get its pass defense organized,

I had executed a couple of Fair to
Hughey touchdown aerials, both
| converted on passes to make the
J score 20-7.
P x hi Psi scored twice late in the
game on passes from Keith Pinion
to Johnny Malloy and Ralph Kie
wiet. Cuadro's rushing of Dallmar
on his tries for conversions, forcing
the big end to kick wide, left Fair,
Hughey and Co. still on top, how
ever.
