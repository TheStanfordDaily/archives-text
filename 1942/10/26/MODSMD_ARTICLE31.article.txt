# Farm Crews Praised for Harvesting
## Women Forsake S.C. Tilt to Aid Farmers With Fruit Picking 
### 
Under the control of the War
li< ard, Stanford students did their
share in harvesting the tomato and
walnut crops lust weekend. Satur
day, 2H students made their last
trip to Frost's Santa Clara tomato
field and definitely finished the crop
for the season in that area. Other
tomato patches were picked on Sun
day by a group of 2'.i students, most
of whom were girls.
The student help for both days
was greatly appreciated by the
growers. Rancher Frost paid a com
pliment to the "Stanford spirit" of
volunteers who, with little experi
ence, "picked tomatoes in a rough
field like true veterans."
REFUSE PAY
Another patriotic note was struck
by last week's student tomato pick
ers who refused pay for a day's
work. With the Mother's Club pack
ing lunches for the workers, and the
ranchers supplying transportation,
the whole picture is one of harmony
between employers and student vol
unteers.
Nevertheless, response from the
men to demands for local farm help
has been faltering, reported Janet
McClanahan, crop crew supervisor.
The task of "walnut knocking" is
primarily a man's jobâ€”it's done with
hooked poles. Several score "knock
ers" are needed this weekend.
ASKS FOR NAMES
The War Board asks that house
representatives turn in a list of
names to the SWB by Wednesday,
for weekend work. This request is
directed primarily to the fraternities,
most of which have had poor show
ings as compared to the turnout of
the girls' living groups.
Tomato pickers are paid 14 cents a
lug, and, consequently, earn their
worth. Women students will find
that walnut picking is relatively
easy, since they are only required to
scoop the nuts off the ground into
boxes for which they are paid 15
cents per fruit box, and can easily
average four or five boxes an hour.
The need for fruit pickers is con
tinuous, and it is hoped that students
will answer the call weekly in groups
until the end of the season. Watch
for the calls from the Stanford War
Board.
