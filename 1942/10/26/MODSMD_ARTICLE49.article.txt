A YEAR ago now Stanford was just another
college holding big dances on and off the
campus. A year ago now Stanford students
voted that they thought "aid to the Allies" was
necessary. A year ago Stanfordites were here
to have a good time feeling sure that our friends
across the Atlantic would take care of the world
situation.
A year ago cars could be driven at any
speed. A year ago we could type and study
and work without fear of blackouts. A year ago
we thought any attack upon the United States
would be impossible.
Yes, our lives have been changed for us. We
have not taken the initiative; we have waited
until circumstances forced the changes upon
us. But our minds are slowly coming around to
realize that while these changes are not pleas
ant, there will be many more to come which will
continue to cut down on our personal pleasures.
It's much more pleasant to look back these
days than to think about the future, but these
things, to mention a few, are sure to happen:
(1) Cars will be gone as a method of trans
portation. (2) A man with a four-year college
education will be a rarity. (3) Food will be
harder to get. (4) Clothes styles will be stand
ardized.
But there is a pleasant side about the future.
We all know now that the more we help at
home by picking fruit, buying War Stamps,
canning, and working for the War Board, the
sooner this conflict will end and we shall all be
able to plan for a far-sighted future rather than
assume the day-by-day outlook we are forced
to take now.
