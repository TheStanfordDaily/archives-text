# It Isn't Too Much to Ask

### 
RUNNING any responsible organization is
difficult, especially when it must depend
upon volunteer labor to get things done. When
the volunteer labor does not keep its appoint
ments, the job is almost impossible.
This seems to be the problem the War Board
is facing. It never has a lack of volunteers who
will go out and pick fruit or walnuts, or give
blood, or help entertain the soldiers, but when
the time comes, the volunteers seem to have
forgotten, gotten other dates, or feel that be
cause they have volunteered they have done
their bit, and needn't bother to show up.
In the case of the Blood Bank, it is especially
important that appointments be kept since Stan
ford and Palo Alto share the same mobile unit
which serves the entire Bay Area. If someone
doesn't appear for his appointment, it deprives
the war effort of vitally needed blood plasma.
It isn't much to ask to come at the right time.
Although U.S.O. isn't as stirring to the imagi
nation as the Blood Bank, it, too, is important.
Not showing up when you promised that you
would is hard for the service men to take. They
have been told that you are coming, and when
they realize that the people for whom they are
fighting aren't sufficiently interested to show up
at their parties, it is hard on morale. It isn't
much to ask to make some soldier happy by
dancing and talking to him for an evening.
The same trouble concerning those who sign
up but don't keep their appointments has
plagued the fruit and nut picking projects. The
farmers count on so many coming to help them
and when they don't arrive, fruit that might
have been picked goes to waste. Two weeks
ago the "Y" and the SWB lost S8 worth of
lunches bought for people who never arrived.
This is quite a loss for the small budgets of the
two organizations to absorb. It isn't much to
ask, when the War Board sees that you get a
lunch at cost, to help pick fruit when you say
you will.
It is not that we don't realize and appreciate
the sacrifices that these donors of their services
and blood are making, but then too war work
has a mundane and practical side which de
pends upon the keeping of these appointments.
