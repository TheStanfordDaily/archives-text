### BY BILL STEIF 
There's an old Vale drinking song lite lines of
which include ihe words, "poor lillle sheep who
have lost our way." In a sense, I believe, litis typi
fies Stanford and. taking the larger view, all of
American youth.
For American youth, 1 fear, is a disillusioned
class. Those of us who are a little past college
aye are children of the disillusionment which fol
lowed the First World War—a disillusionment
which found its expression in Dadaism, Surreal
ism, and the Chicago gang era, a disillusionment
which found the French marching into the Ruhr in
1923, which found the dictatorial Stalin tossing
I rolzky overboard at Lenin's death, which found
the flapper and the ku klux Klan and bathtub gin
and short skirts nourishing in America.
We—Stanford men and women —are children of
the depression. We weren't bit hard by the depres
sion—we wouldn t be at Stanford if we had been—
but we, nevertheless, knew what it was like to see
bread lines, knew what it was like to move from
large to smaller homes, knew what il was like to
have fathers come home with stomach ulcers and
gray tired faces. And you can magnify these lillle
inconveniences a hundred times and then perhaps
imagine a little bit what some of lite kids you went
through grammar and high school v\ itli went
through.
■* * # *
Why is this, some may ask. I got what I believe
is an answer to this question talking lo a ver\ wise
professor lite other day. He said that youth craves,
above all else, security.
And security is the one thing, il would seem,
that youth has not had in the past 20 or 25 years.
I lie materialists confront one with the great scien
tific advances which have made li\ing so much
easier in ihe past 25 years, but has this, I should
like to ask, made this era any happier? To me il
seems that no matter how many material goodnesses
man possesses he cannot find any true happiness
—and security, perhaps, is ihe keystone of happi
ness—until he has a faith in which he can believe
wholeheartedly.
Do you see what I mean? Failh. security, happi
ness, each are complements of the other and all are
abstractions for which youth longs pitifully.
Now the most important word of those important
three, it seems to me, is Faith. Since the last war
we have found very little to believe in. This is the
large part of our predicament.
We, as a group, are almost incurably optimistic.
We would swallow almost anything that showed
some promise, that seemed lo lead out of the bitter
chasm of life as il is, that seemed to indicate change.
If you doubt my word, ask the youth of Germany
or Russia or Italy.

But American youth has found nothing which
is templing enough to believe in en masse. Il hardly
believes in itself. And yet we are asked now lo give
all our support to democracy. Well, we know that
fascism is bad. we know that communism, in many
of ils phases, is pretty poor. But we have also lived
through 25 years in the United Stales in which
democracy has been pretty disillusioning. Even be
lief in so reeent an ideal as ihe Atlantic Charter lias
been shattered, for example, by Mr. Churchill's
stalenient that that Charter does nol apply lo India.
The whole thing, 1 fear, is that we don't have
any ideals, either group or individual, to follow, to
live up to. W ; e just seem lo be singing, and to be
fighting, in the dark. Youth would, I ihink, like
to believe in the essential goodness of all men but
cannot because of history's last 25 years. Youth
cannot believe in man's essential e\ il because, I
hope, of its incurable optimism.

And security is the one thing, il would seem,
that youth has not had in the past 20 or 25 years.
I lie materialists confront one with the great scien
tific advances which have made li\ing so much
easier in ihe past 25 years, but has this, I should
like to ask, made this era any happier? To me il
seems that no matter how many material goodnesses
man possesses he cannot find any true happiness
—and security, perhaps, is ihe keystone of happi
ness—until he has a faith in which he can believe
wholeheartedly.
Do you see what I mean? Failh. security, happi
ness, each are complements of the other and all are
abstractions for which youth longs pitifully.
Now the most important word of those important
three, it seems to me, is Faith. Since the last war
we have found very little to believe in. This is the
large part of our predicament.
We, as a group, are almost incurably optimistic.
We would swallow almost anything that showed
some promise, that seemed lo lead out of the bitter
chasm of life as il is, that seemed to indicate change.
If you doubt my word, ask the youth of Germany
or Russia or Italy.

But American youth has found nothing which
is templing enough to believe in en masse. Il hardly
believes in itself. And yet we are asked now lo give
all our support to democracy. Well, we know that
fascism is bad. we know that communism, in many
of ils phases, is pretty poor. But we have also lived
through 25 years in the United Stales in which
democracy has been pretty disillusioning. Even be
lief in so reeent an ideal as ihe Atlantic Charter lias
been shattered, for example, by Mr. Churchill's
stalenient that that Charter does nol apply lo India.
The whole thing, 1 fear, is that we don't have
any ideals, either group or individual, to follow, to
live up to. W ; e just seem lo be singing, and to be
fighting, in the dark. Youth would, I ihink, like
to believe in the essential goodness of all men but
cannot because of history's last 25 years. Youth
cannot believe in man's essential e\ il because, I
hope, of its incurable optimism.
There's an old Vale drinking song lite lines of
which include ihe words, "poor lillle sheep who
have lost our way." In a sense, I believe, litis typi
fies Stanford and. taking the larger view, all of
American youth.
For American youth, 1 fear, is a disillusioned
class. Those of us who are a little past college
aye are children of the disillusionment which fol
lowed the First World War—a disillusionment
which found its expression in Dadaism, Surreal
ism, and the Chicago gang era, a disillusionment
which found the French marching into the Ruhr in
1923, which found the dictatorial Stalin tossing
I rolzky overboard at Lenin's death, which found
the flapper and the ku klux Klan and bathtub gin
and short skirts nourishing in America.
We—Stanford men and women —are children of
the depression. We weren't bit hard by the depres
sion—we wouldn t be at Stanford if we had been—
but we, nevertheless, knew what it was like to see
bread lines, knew what it was like to move from
large to smaller homes, knew what il was like to
have fathers come home with stomach ulcers and
gray tired faces. And you can magnify these lillle
inconveniences a hundred times and then perhaps
imagine a little bit what some of lite kids you went
through grammar and high school v\ itli went
through.

democracy has been pretty disillusioning. Even be
lief in so reeent an ideal as ihe Atlantic Charter lias
been shattered, for example, by Mr. Churchill's
stalenient that that Charter does nol apply lo India.
The whole thing, 1 fear, is that we don't have
any ideals, either group or individual, to follow, to
live up to. W ; e just seem lo be singing, and to be
fighting, in the dark. Youth would, I ihink, like
to believe in the essential goodness of all men but
cannot because of history's last 25 years. Youth
cannot believe in man's essential e\ il because, I
hope, of its incurable optimism.
There's an old Vale drinking song lite lines of
which include ihe words, "poor lillle sheep who
have lost our way." In a sense, I believe, litis typi
fies Stanford and. taking the larger view, all of
American youth.
For American youth, 1 fear, is a disillusioned
class. Those of us who are a little past college
aye are children of the disillusionment which fol
lowed the First World War—a disillusionment
which found its expression in Dadaism, Surreal
ism, and the Chicago gang era, a disillusionment
which found the French marching into the Ruhr in
1923, which found the dictatorial Stalin tossing
I rolzky overboard at Lenin's death, which found
the flapper and the ku klux Klan and bathtub gin
and short skirts nourishing in America.
We—Stanford men and women —are children of
the depression. We weren't bit hard by the depres
sion—we wouldn t be at Stanford if we had been—
but we, nevertheless, knew what it was like to see
bread lines, knew what it was like to move from
large to smaller homes, knew what il was like to
have fathers come home with stomach ulcers and
gray tired faces. And you can magnify these lillle
inconveniences a hundred times and then perhaps
imagine a little bit what some of lite kids you went
through grammar and high school v\ itli went
through.

Why is this, some may ask. I got what I believe
is an answer to this question talking lo a ver\ wise
professor lite other day. He said that youth craves,
above all else, security.
And security is the one thing, il would seem,
that youth has not had in the past 20 or 25 years.
I lie materialists confront one with the great scien
tific advances which have made li\ing so much
easier in ihe past 25 years, but has this, I should
like to ask, made this era any happier? To me il
seems that no matter how many material goodnesses
man possesses he cannot find any true happiness
—and security, perhaps, is ihe keystone of happi
ness—until he has a faith in which he can believe
wholeheartedly.
Do you see what I mean? Failh. security, happi
ness, each are complements of the other and all are
abstractions for which youth longs pitifully.
Now the most important word of those important
three, it seems to me, is Faith. Since the last war
we have found very little to believe in. This is the
large part of our predicament.
We, as a group, are almost incurably optimistic.
We would swallow almost anything that showed
some promise, that seemed lo lead out of the bitter
chasm of life as il is, that seemed to indicate change.
If you doubt my word, ask the youth of Germany
or Russia or Italy.

But American youth has found nothing which
is templing enough to believe in en masse. Il hardly
believes in itself. And yet we are asked now lo give
all our support to democracy. Well, we know that
fascism is bad. we know that communism, in many
of ils phases, is pretty poor. But we have also lived
through 25 years in the United Stales in which
democracy has been pretty disillusioning. Even be
