The Editor, Sir:
I was rather taken aback upon reading History
1942 in last Monday's Daily. Willi the war not one
ihird won, Mr. Morion devotes half of his column
to a discussion of how we are going to deal with
the Russian annexations I 1939 1911 i after the war
is over. I'm sure there is not much need lo go over
the So\ iet contributions to our cause in this war.
Most Americans I including —I hope Mr. Nor
ton I realize that the Red army is the only one which
has been able to stand up to the best the Ma/is can
tin "ow; that, without the Russian front, upwards of
four million German soldiers and the main force
of the Luftwaffe would be free to attack at any point
Hitler might choose, from the Near Last and Africa
lo Britain itself. Our lask of defeating Germany
on the continent would become almost impossible.
I might also remind him that Russia has as good
a claim on Lslonia. Latvia, and Lithuania as Britain
has on India. (At least tlicy had a plebiscite in the
Raltic countries! t Some of the parts of Poland
seized in 1939 were never intended to be Polish b\
ihe post-war peace conferences, but were seized b\
the Poles in 1920 22.
In general. I think that Mr. Norton ini<:lil well
devote his comments to current news and refrain
from stirring up unrest and suspicion between two
of the leading I nited Nations. There will be plenl\
of time for speculation njlcr ue hare icon the tear
and all the facts are known.
