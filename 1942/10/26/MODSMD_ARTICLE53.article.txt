# Anderson Play Tells True Tale Of Army Life
## Farm Players Slate 'Eve of St. Mark' For Nov. 4-9 Showing 
### 
Maxwell Anderson, Stanford's own
playwright, knew whereof he spoke
when he wrote his latest success,
"The Eve of S(. Mark," which will
lie presented by the Stanford Play
ers Nov. 4, 5, (i. 7, and !) in the Little
Theater.
Before writing this story of pres
ent day army life and its effect upon
soldiers and the ones they love, Mr.
Anderson obtained special permis
sion from army officials to visit Fort
Bragg, N.C.
Critics have Called the play vivid
and truthful, and it is, for Anderson
caught the spirit of army life as he
gathered his material.
UNDISGUISED TRUTH
Say Time reviewers, "The story it
tells is unvarnished in its simplicity
and is unbeatable in its appeal."
Mr. Anderson wrote the truth un
disguised, using his models as he
found them, and part of the great
appeal of "The Eve of St Mark" is
its sincerity.
It is an average story of an aver
age citizen, not made up, not fiction
alized, and it is recognizable as life
today by soldiers.
REAL EXPERIENCES
Anderson wrote many of his ex
periences at Fort Bragg into his play,
and many of the persons he met are
barely disguised. A Private Bus
chami appears as Private Buscami,
and the actual Rainbow Restaurant
in Fayettville, N.C., enters the story
as the Moonbow.
Anderson wrote the introduction
to Private Hargraves' best-seller,
"Look Here, Private Hargraves," and
in it tells of his meeting with Har
graves at Fort Bragg. In his play,
Anderson has used the same episode,
transferring his position to a Private
Marion.
The only character whose identity
is masked is that of Private Quizz
West, the leading character. He is a
nobody who is anybody, he is so ail-
American.

soldiers and the ones they love, Mr.
Anderson obtained special permis
sion from army officials to visit Fort
Bragg, N.C.
Critics have Called the play vivid
and truthful, and it is, for Anderson
caught the spirit of army life as he
gathered his material.
UNDISGUISED TRUTH
Say Time reviewers, "The story it
tells is unvarnished in its simplicity
and is unbeatable in its appeal."
Mr. Anderson wrote the truth un
disguised, using his models as he
found them, and part of the great
appeal of "The Eve of St Mark" is
its sincerity.
It is an average story of an aver
age citizen, not made up, not fiction
alized, and it is recognizable as life
today by soldiers.
REAL EXPERIENCES
Anderson wrote many of his ex
periences at Fort Bragg into his play,
and many of the persons he met are
barely disguised. A Private Bus
chami appears as Private Buscami,
and the actual Rainbow Restaurant
in Fayettville, N.C., enters the story
as the Moonbow.
Anderson wrote the introduction
to Private Hargraves' best-seller,
"Look Here, Private Hargraves," and
in it tells of his meeting with Har
graves at Fort Bragg. In his play,
Anderson has used the same episode,
transferring his position to a Private
Marion.
The only character whose identity
is masked is that of Private Quizz
West, the leading character. He is a
nobody who is anybody, he is so ail-
American.
