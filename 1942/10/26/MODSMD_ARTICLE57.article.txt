# Russian War Film Impresses With Battle, Atrocity Shots
## 
### 
"Moscow Strikes Back," now playing at the Varsity Theater.
This is the best picture of modern war that the United Nations have yet
produced. There are lots of omissions and the actual combat is not shown
with anywhere near the vividness and completeness of the Nazi films.
The picture does show, however, magnificent shots of the Russian army,

and also pictures of Russians dead
from battle, from firing squads, from
hanging, from Nazi reprisals.
The best shot of the picture was
the showing of big guns being aimed
and finally being fired. There is no
other sound than that of the guns.
The atrocity shots aren't exactly
forgettable. They are shots of some
thing which shouldn't happen, but
which does. They aren't pleasant,
but they have to be seen to be be
lieved. No one would believe them
otherwise.
It is a picture which everyone
should see if only to find out what
is happening to the rest of the world.
