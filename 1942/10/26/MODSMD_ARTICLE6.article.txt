dropping "several" incendiary
bombs in the first air raid on the
former British crown colony since
its occupation by the Japanese, the
Tokyo radio announced today.
A Japanese broadcast said Jap
fighters repulsed the raiders. "The
Japanese planes immediately shot
down one enemy plane," Tokyo

in a trail of black smoke."
