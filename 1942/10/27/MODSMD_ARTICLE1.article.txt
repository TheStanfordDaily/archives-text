# Third of Stanford Men Are Unfit for Service, Physical Tests Reveal
## Fitness Survey Finds 20 Per Cent Superior, 50 Passable, 30 Per Cent Poor; Bob Ullman Gets High Score 
### BILL HORNBY 
For nearly a third of Stanford's men, entrance into World War II combat
in their present physical condition would be "almost suicide," Dr. A. A.
Esslinger of the School of Health said last night in releasing the results of
the recent physical fitness testing program.
"There are a lot of Stanford men who couldn't pull themselves out of a

trench—there are some who couldn't,
get into a boat out of the sea if their
life depended upon it," Esslinger
warned.
Although 20 per cent of the 1300
Farm men who were tested are in
superior shape, and another 50 per
cent passable, the lower 30 per cent
are in a position of "life and death"
seriousness.
TESTING POINTS
The test—designed to test strength,
endurance, power, agility, balance,
and coordination—presented the fol
lowing physical portrait of the aver
age Stanford man.
He can chin seven times, pushup
23, run the 300 in 45 seconds, sit-up
37 times, broad-jump 97 inches,
Burpee 10 times, shuttle-run 37
yards, and cover 45 yards in six
seconds.
Generally speaking, Stanford arms
and shoulders are weak, as revealed
by uniformly low scores in chinning
and push-up tests. Only 25 per cent
can chin enough to meet what Es
slinger considers necessary stand
ards for military service. 50 per cent
lack military endurance, and be
tween 30 and 40 per cent lack the
agility requirements for quick re
flex action and emergency adapta
tions.
CUMULATIVE SCORES
The cumulative scores on the tests
ranged from 660 to an actual 0, based
on 800 as perfect. Stanford's aver
age was 400.
Robert Ullman rates the title of
"most physically fit boy" on campus,
Esslinger said. Here's the top rec
ord: Pull-up, 14; Burpee, 13; broad
jump (standing), 111 inches; push
ups, 60; shuttle run, 40 yards; 6-sec
ond run, 51 yards; 300-yard run, 37
seconds; sit-ups, 75.
In contrast to this perfect picture,
many men could only chin once or
twice, push-up seven or eight times,
sit-up perhaps 20 times, and do six
or seven Burpees.
REAL PROBLEM
"It's these boys whom we are
really worried about," Esslinger said.
The intense physical training now
beginning aims at guaranteeing that
no Stanford man shall leave for the
service without a decent chance for
his life. He will face fighting men
of the Axis powers who have had
superior physical training for many
years.
To aid in this task, the test scores
of every man in gym classes have
been given to their instructors
That's why for the first time in many
years a badminton or tennis playei
has to go through a push-up and
chinning session to qualify for his
lighter activity.
The whole Stanford coaching stafJ
will be dedicated to a body-building
campaign this year. The qualities
measured by the test, plus adequate
nutritional status and freedom fron
actual physical defect, make up the
man which the trainers want the
rule and not the exception on the
campus.
In the words of a report by Es
slinger, the tests were an inventory
of Stanford's physical assets and lia
bilities. They were also an invest
ment in the future of Stanford, foi
School of Health authorities fee
strongly that the ratio of Stanforc
men returning from war will b<
proportionate to the time they tak<
now to cure defects revealed
their test scores.

flex action and emergency adapta
tions.
CUMULATIVE SCORES
The cumulative scores on the tests
ranged from 660 to an actual 0, based
on 800 as perfect. Stanford's aver
age was 400.
Robert Ullman rates the title of
"most physically fit boy" on campus,
Esslinger said. Here's the top rec
ord: Pull-up, 14; Burpee, 13; broad
jump (standing), 111 inches; push
ups, 60; shuttle run, 40 yards; 6-sec
ond run, 51 yards; 300-yard run, 37
seconds; sit-ups, 75.
In contrast to this perfect picture,
many men could only chin once or
twice, push-up seven or eight times,
sit-up perhaps 20 times, and do six
or seven Burpees.
REAL PROBLEM
"It's these boys whom we are
really worried about," Esslinger said.
The intense physical training now
beginning aims at guaranteeing that
no Stanford man shall leave for the
service without a decent chance for
his life. He will face fighting men
of the Axis powers who have had
superior physical training for many
years.
To aid in this task, the test scores
of every man in gym classes have
been given to their instructors
That's why for the first time in many
years a badminton or tennis playei
has to go through a push-up and
chinning session to qualify for his
lighter activity.
The whole Stanford coaching stafJ
will be dedicated to a body-building
campaign this year. The qualities
measured by the test, plus adequate
nutritional status and freedom fron
actual physical defect, make up the
man which the trainers want the
rule and not the exception on the
campus.
In the words of a report by Es
slinger, the tests were an inventory
of Stanford's physical assets and lia
bilities. They were also an invest
ment in the future of Stanford, foi
School of Health authorities fee
strongly that the ratio of Stanforc
men returning from war will b<
proportionate to the time they tak<
now to cure defects revealed
their test scores.
For nearly a third of Stanford's men, entrance into World War II combat
in their present physical condition would be "almost suicide," Dr. A. A.
Esslinger of the School of Health said last night in releasing the results of
the recent physical fitness testing program.
"There are a lot of Stanford men who couldn't pull themselves out of a

trench—there are some who couldn't,
get into a boat out of the sea if their
life depended upon it," Esslinger
warned.
Although 20 per cent of the 1300
Farm men who were tested are in
superior shape, and another 50 per
cent passable, the lower 30 per cent
are in a position of "life and death"
seriousness.
TESTING POINTS
The test—designed to test strength,
endurance, power, agility, balance,
and coordination—presented the fol
lowing physical portrait of the aver
age Stanford man.
He can chin seven times, pushup
23, run the 300 in 45 seconds, sit-up
37 times, broad-jump 97 inches,
Burpee 10 times, shuttle-run 37
yards, and cover 45 yards in six
seconds.
Generally speaking, Stanford arms
and shoulders are weak, as revealed
by uniformly low scores in chinning
and push-up tests. Only 25 per cent
can chin enough to meet what Es
slinger considers necessary stand
ards for military service. 50 per cent
lack military endurance, and be
tween 30 and 40 per cent lack the
agility requirements for quick re
flex action and emergency adapta
tions.

actual physical defect, make up the
man which the trainers want the
rule and not the exception on the
campus.
In the words of a report by Es
slinger, the tests were an inventory
of Stanford's physical assets and lia
bilities. They were also an invest
ment in the future of Stanford, foi
School of Health authorities fee
strongly that the ratio of Stanforc
men returning from war will b<
proportionate to the time they tak<
now to cure defects revealed
their test scores.
For nearly a third of Stanford's men, entrance into World War II combat
in their present physical condition would be "almost suicide," Dr. A. A.
Esslinger of the School of Health said last night in releasing the results of
the recent physical fitness testing program.
"There are a lot of Stanford men who couldn't pull themselves out of a

trench—there are some who couldn't,
get into a boat out of the sea if their
life depended upon it," Esslinger
warned.
Although 20 per cent of the 1300
Farm men who were tested are in
superior shape, and another 50 per
cent passable, the lower 30 per cent
are in a position of "life and death"
seriousness.
TESTING POINTS
The test—designed to test strength,
endurance, power, agility, balance,
and coordination—presented the fol
lowing physical portrait of the aver
age Stanford man.
He can chin seven times, pushup
23, run the 300 in 45 seconds, sit-up
37 times, broad-jump 97 inches,
Burpee 10 times, shuttle-run 37
yards, and cover 45 yards in six
seconds.
Generally speaking, Stanford arms
and shoulders are weak, as revealed
by uniformly low scores in chinning
and push-up tests. Only 25 per cent
can chin enough to meet what Es
slinger considers necessary stand
ards for military service. 50 per cent
lack military endurance, and be
tween 30 and 40 per cent lack the
agility requirements for quick re
flex action and emergency adapta
tions.
CUMULATIVE SCORES
The cumulative scores on the tests
ranged from 660 to an actual 0, based
on 800 as perfect. Stanford's aver
age was 400.
Robert Ullman rates the title of
"most physically fit boy" on campus,
Esslinger said. Here's the top rec
ord: Pull-up, 14; Burpee, 13; broad
jump (standing), 111 inches; push
ups, 60; shuttle run, 40 yards; 6-sec
ond run, 51 yards; 300-yard run, 37
seconds; sit-ups, 75.
In contrast to this perfect picture,
many men could only chin once or
twice, push-up seven or eight times,
sit-up perhaps 20 times, and do six
or seven Burpees.
REAL PROBLEM
"It's these boys whom we are
really worried about," Esslinger said.
The intense physical training now
beginning aims at guaranteeing that
no Stanford man shall leave for the
service without a decent chance for
his life. He will face fighting men
of the Axis powers who have had
superior physical training for many
years.
To aid in this task, the test scores
of every man in gym classes have
been given to their instructors
That's why for the first time in many
years a badminton or tennis playei
has to go through a push-up and
chinning session to qualify for his
lighter activity.
The whole Stanford coaching stafJ
will be dedicated to a body-building
campaign this year. The qualities
measured by the test, plus adequate
nutritional status and freedom fron
actual physical defect, make up the
man which the trainers want the
rule and not the exception on the
campus.
