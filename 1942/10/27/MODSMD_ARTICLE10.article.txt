approved it already.
Under the proposed change, 1:30.,
late leaves will replace present
2:3o's, and Friday night will be con
sidered a week night. Distribution
of late leaves will depend on upper
and lower division standings rather
than a class basis.
COMMITTEE ELECTED
If adopted, the new regulations
will go into effect next quarter and
will apply at least for the duration
of the war to all women residing in
undergraduate residences from reg
istration day to the day of the stu
dent's last final.
A committee from Women's Con
ference elected by members of that
group, which includes the presidents
of all campus living groups, drew up
the new regulations. Serving on the
committee were Sue Stevens, Chris
Moody, Joan Hill, Betty Lee Luh
now, Lucy Terrell and Ruth Atkins.
10:30's WEEK NIGHTS
As in the past, residences will
close at 10:30 every night except
Friday, Saturday and before a Uni
versity holiday, when they may stay
open until 12. Residences will close
one-half hour after the Reg Dance
or a dance given on campus by a
living group. However, in the case
of a disaster signal, the residence
shall comply with the regulations of
the Civilian Defense Council.
Overnight leaves shall count as
1:30 leaves. Permission for such
leaves from Sunday to Friday in
clusive must be obtained by all
women with less than 132 units from
the chairman of Women's Council
or from the residence director in
j case of an emergency onlyâ€”if the
chairman cannot be reached. Stu
dents are exempt from this require
ment if they have 132 units and at
least a C average.
Realizing that many , women will
be requesting Friday night over
| night leaves, Ruth Atkins has an
nounced that Council will probably
grant them whenever the student
has no Saturday classes and has the
late leave privilege.

leaves.)

Long awaited and much debated, the revised wartime social regulations
came up for general discussion at house meetings in all the women's living
groups last night. Final decision on the new plan will not be made until
next Monday's meeting of Women's Conference, which has tentatively
