The two lecturers, who graduated
from the University last year, met
as freshmen at Encina Hall. Work
has been interested in birds and had
taken many bird pictures. Wool
lived on a ranch near San Jose and
had studied birds for many years.
They decided to form a partnership
and follow their hobby together.
They enrolled together in a class
in Ornithology and as sophomores
started working on a study of the
"Nest Life of the Turkey Vulture."
Their subsequent work in this field
has been rated as an original contri
bution.
As their work together progressed,
plans for the filming of the story of
"The Golden Eagle" took shape.
With the help of Professor Willis H.
Rich, they carried on their research
under the direction of the Natural
History Museum. At first they used
for illustrations black and white
stills, then colored stills, and finally
colored motion pictures.
The program will begin promptly
at 7:30. Work will give some intro
ductory .words of explanation about
the Golden Eagle and he will be
assisted by Wool in the narration of
the film.
