# O'Neil To Hold Final Tryouts
## 
### 
Well pleased with the turnout at j
last night's tryout session, hut hop- |
ing to see even more talented fresh- '
men and transfers. Bob O'Neill, the
man of hopes who directs the 1942 \
Big Game Gaieties, announces that
final tryouts for acting parts in the
show will he held tonight from 7:30
to 10 in the Education Auditorium.
"Last night's tryouts brought
forth many capable newcomers as
well as some of the old favorites,"
the chief said, "but the Gaieties
staff hopes for even more and
wants to double its array of campus
queens."
Those interested in chorus work
only and who have not yet signed
up will have their last opportunity
at tonight's session in the Educa
tion Auditorium.
TECHNICAL WORKERS
All those who would like to work
on the big production technically
rather than dramatically should
contact Technical Director Hal Lev
itt at the Kappa Alpha house, or see
Paul Hostetler, production manager,
in the Memorial Theater workshop
by the end of the week.
Technical jobs include construc
tion and staging, make-up, lighting,
costume crews, property men,
script girls, and various other work.
Orchestra musicians are still be
ing auditioned. Tryoutees should
get in touch with Dick Rabbett,
musical director, at Palo Alto 22942.
ASKS FOR WORKERS
Urging students with any sort of
ability or inteerst to turn out and
work on the show, O'Neill said,
"Anyone who has ever worked on
the Gaieties in any capacity knows
what that word means. It's three
weeks of fun and invaluable ex
perience," and he should know,
having weathered three seasons.
"Now that we're seniors, there's
nothing we'd rather be than fresh
men, just so we could go knock
ourselves out at the Gaieties for sev
eral more years," the headman re
marked, speaking for the staff.
With that he left the exclusive
interview, screaming impercep
tibly.
