# New Dim-Out Rules in Effect
## CD Head Discusses Important Phases 
### 
Commenting on the latest procla
mation issued by the Western De
fense Command and Fourth Army
in regard to new and stricter dim
out regulations, which went into ef
fect yesterday, Alfred R. Masters,
executive head of Stanford's Civilian
Defense, yesterday pointed out sev
eral phases of the proclamation that
are particularly important to cam
pus residents.
"The resolution in the proclama
tion states that all interior light
sources which emit direct rays above
the horizozntal out-of-doors must be
extinguished or shades must be
drawn to prevent these direct rays
from being emitted above the
horizontal out-of-doors," Mr. Mas
ters stated.
In order to be sure that everyone
complies with this rule, Mr. Masters
urged all campus residents to pull
their window shades down every
evening before turning on their in
terior lights.
"In this manner," he said, "every
one will be absolutely positive that
he is on the right side and doesn't
have to worry about 'horizontal'
rays and certain 'candle power'."
In regard to outside lighting, the
proclamation orders:
"All outside lighting such as porch
lights and floor lights shall not ex
ceed one foot candle at any point
when measured on a horizontal
plane at any level at such outdoor
areas, and all outdoor light sources
shall be shielded so that no direct
rays from the light sources are emit
ted above the horizontal."
Clarifying this rule, Mr. Masters
said that for all practical purposes
this regulation means that all out
door flood lights and outdoor porch
lights shall be extinguished unless
they are carefully shielded and the
candle power of the bulbs is reduced
to the bare minimum to comply with
the regulations.
According to the proclamation,
any person failing to comply with
these provisions arc subject to im
mediate exclusion from the territory
of the Western Defense Command
and to the criminal penalty provided
under law.
