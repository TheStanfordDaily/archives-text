# Willkie Asks Second Fronts, Hits Lack of Aid to Allies
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Oct, 26 (U.R)—"Wen
dell L. Willkie, in a report to the
American people on his recent world
tour, tonight reiterated his demands
for second fronts in Europe and
Burma to relieve enemy pressure on
Russia and China and urged Amer
ican leadership of a post-war world
in which all nations will be freed of
"economic injustices" and "political
malpractices."
In a radio address broadcast
throughout the nation and the world
the former Republican presidential
candidate said he believes that "in a
military sense we can win this war"
despite the fact that, so far, "in many
respects we are not doing a good
job."
CONDEMNED CENSORSHIP
He condemned censorship, urged
greater use of "the whip-lash of
public opinion" to force the admin
istration and its military leaders to
more vigorous action, and deplored
the fact that "we have made great
promises" to some of our Allies—
presumably Russia and China —
which so far have not been satisfac
torily fulfilled.
Willkie emphasized that he spoke
as a free agent and said that while
he performed "certain specific acts"
for the President while abroad he
was free of official fetters.
Some of his criticism of the ad
ministration was extremely blunt.
FEW BOMBERS TO CHINA
"If I were to tell you how few
bombers China has received from us
you simply would not believe me,"
he said. "If I were to tell you how
far Russia feels we are from fulfill
ing our commitments, you would
agree with me that we have little
reason to boast about our per
formance."
The question of when American
supplies will begin reaching our Al
lies in sufficient volume, he said,
"depends, I think, on how quickly
we, and our leadei's, can begin to
think and act offensively, can begin
to mobilize, not for defense but for
attack.
MUST no MORE TO WIN
"It is my reasoned judgment that
we cannot win this war 40 per cent
mobilized ... it is up to us to make
our leaders give us more to do."
The speaker described a dwindling
reservoir of good will towards the
United States which has existed in
Russia and China and said that "If
we fail to deliver to our Allies what
they are entitled to expect of us or
what we have promised them, our
reservoir of good will will turn into
one of resentment . . . five million
Russians and five million Chinese
have given their lives in this strug
gle . . . we owe them more than
boasts and broken promises."

The speaker deplored the admin
istration's failure clearly to define
American war aims and to give as
surances to our Allies in Asia and
Eastern Europe as to "what we are
fighting for."
PACIFIC AN!) WORLD CHARTER
The Chinese and the Russians, he
said, are "bewildered and anxious"
and feel that the Atlantic Charter
declared by President Roosevelt and
the British Prime Minister should be
supplemented by a Pacific "Charter
and a World Charter.
A specific date should be set for
the freedom of India, Willkie im
plied, and the United States should
have a voice in India's future.
EASTERN PEOPLE DOUBTFUL
"People of the East who would
like to count on us are doubtful,"
Willkie said. "They cannot ascer
tain from our government's wishy
washy attitude towards the problem
of India what we are likely to feel
at the end of the war about all the
other hundreds of millions of East
ern peoples. They cannot tell from
our vague and vacillating talk
whether or not we really do stand
for freedom, or what we mean by
freedom."
The speaker criticized American
policy toward the Eastern peoples,
asserting the administration has
failed to send to these countries
"representatives with authority to
discuss such problems intelligently
and to take realistic steps toward
their solution."
CENSORSHIP 'UNDEMOCRATIC'
The speaker described the work
ing of the present censorship as
"stupid, arbitrary and undemocratic"
and asserted the people should not
remain silent on the military, indus
trial. economic and political conduct
of the war.
This position of silence, he said,
threatens "to become a tight wall
which will keep the truth out and
lock misrepresentation and false
security within ... in many respects
we are not doing a good job: . . . we
are on the road to winning the war,
but . . . we run a heavy risk of
spending tar more in men and mate
rials than we need to snend."

American people on his recent world
tour, tonight reiterated his demands
for second fronts in Europe and
Burma to relieve enemy pressure on
Russia and China and urged Amer
ican leadership of a post-war world
in which all nations will be freed of
"economic injustices" and "political
malpractices."
In a radio address broadcast
throughout the nation and the world
the former Republican presidential
candidate said he believes that "in a
military sense we can win this war"
despite the fact that, so far, "in many
respects we are not doing a good
job."
CONDEMNED CENSORSHIP
He condemned censorship, urged
greater use of "the whip-lash of
public opinion" to force the admin
istration and its military leaders to
more vigorous action, and deplored
the fact that "we have made great
promises" to some of our Allies—
presumably Russia and China —
which so far have not been satisfac
torily fulfilled.
Willkie emphasized that he spoke
as a free agent and said that while
he performed "certain specific acts"
for the President while abroad he
was free of official fetters.
Some of his criticism of the ad
ministration was extremely blunt.
FEW BOMBERS TO CHINA
"If I were to tell you how few
bombers China has received from us
you simply would not believe me,"
he said. "If I were to tell you how
far Russia feels we are from fulfill
ing our commitments, you would
agree with me that we have little
reason to boast about our per
formance."
The question of when American
supplies will begin reaching our Al
lies in sufficient volume, he said,
"depends, I think, on how quickly
we, and our leadei's, can begin to
think and act offensively, can begin
to mobilize, not for defense but for
attack.
MUST no MORE TO WIN
"It is my reasoned judgment that
we cannot win this war 40 per cent
mobilized ... it is up to us to make
our leaders give us more to do."
The speaker described a dwindling
reservoir of good will towards the
United States which has existed in
Russia and China and said that "If
we fail to deliver to our Allies what
they are entitled to expect of us or
what we have promised them, our
reservoir of good will will turn into
one of resentment . . . five million
Russians and five million Chinese
have given their lives in this strug
gle . . . we owe them more than
boasts and broken promises."

The speaker deplored the admin
istration's failure clearly to define
American war aims and to give as
surances to our Allies in Asia and
Eastern Europe as to "what we are
fighting for."
PACIFIC AN!) WORLD CHARTER
The Chinese and the Russians, he
said, are "bewildered and anxious"
and feel that the Atlantic Charter
declared by President Roosevelt and
the British Prime Minister should be
supplemented by a Pacific "Charter
and a World Charter.
A specific date should be set for
the freedom of India, Willkie im
plied, and the United States should
have a voice in India's future.
EASTERN PEOPLE DOUBTFUL
"People of the East who would
like to count on us are doubtful,"
Willkie said. "They cannot ascer
tain from our government's wishy
washy attitude towards the problem
of India what we are likely to feel
at the end of the war about all the
other hundreds of millions of East
ern peoples. They cannot tell from
our vague and vacillating talk
whether or not we really do stand
for freedom, or what we mean by
freedom."
The speaker criticized American
policy toward the Eastern peoples,
asserting the administration has
failed to send to these countries
"representatives with authority to
discuss such problems intelligently
and to take realistic steps toward
their solution."
CENSORSHIP 'UNDEMOCRATIC'
The speaker described the work
ing of the present censorship as
"stupid, arbitrary and undemocratic"
and asserted the people should not
remain silent on the military, indus
trial. economic and political conduct
of the war.
This position of silence, he said,
threatens "to become a tight wall
which will keep the truth out and
lock misrepresentation and false
security within ... in many respects
we are not doing a good job: . . . we
are on the road to winning the war,
but . . . we run a heavy risk of
spending tar more in men and mate
rials than we need to snend."

Burma to relieve enemy pressure on
Russia and China and urged Amer
ican leadership of a post-war world
in which all nations will be freed of
"economic injustices" and "political
malpractices."
In a radio address broadcast
throughout the nation and the world
the former Republican presidential
candidate said he believes that "in a
military sense we can win this war"
despite the fact that, so far, "in many
respects we are not doing a good
job."
CONDEMNED CENSORSHIP
He condemned censorship, urged
greater use of "the whip-lash of
public opinion" to force the admin
istration and its military leaders to
more vigorous action, and deplored
the fact that "we have made great
promises" to some of our Allies—
presumably Russia and China —
which so far have not been satisfac
torily fulfilled.
Willkie emphasized that he spoke
as a free agent and said that while
he performed "certain specific acts"
for the President while abroad he
was free of official fetters.
Some of his criticism of the ad
ministration was extremely blunt.
FEW BOMBERS TO CHINA
"If I were to tell you how few
bombers China has received from us
you simply would not believe me,"
he said. "If I were to tell you how
far Russia feels we are from fulfill
ing our commitments, you would
agree with me that we have little
reason to boast about our per
formance."
The question of when American
supplies will begin reaching our Al
lies in sufficient volume, he said,
"depends, I think, on how quickly
we, and our leadei's, can begin to
think and act offensively, can begin
to mobilize, not for defense but for
attack.
MUST no MORE TO WIN
"It is my reasoned judgment that
we cannot win this war 40 per cent
mobilized ... it is up to us to make
our leaders give us more to do."
The speaker described a dwindling
reservoir of good will towards the
United States which has existed in
Russia and China and said that "If
we fail to deliver to our Allies what
they are entitled to expect of us or
what we have promised them, our
reservoir of good will will turn into
one of resentment . . . five million
Russians and five million Chinese
have given their lives in this strug
gle . . . we owe them more than
boasts and broken promises."

The speaker deplored the admin
istration's failure clearly to define
American war aims and to give as
surances to our Allies in Asia and
Eastern Europe as to "what we are
fighting for."
PACIFIC AN!) WORLD CHARTER
The Chinese and the Russians, he
said, are "bewildered and anxious"
and feel that the Atlantic Charter
declared by President Roosevelt and
the British Prime Minister should be
supplemented by a Pacific "Charter
and a World Charter.
A specific date should be set for
the freedom of India, Willkie im
plied, and the United States should
have a voice in India's future.
EASTERN PEOPLE DOUBTFUL
"People of the East who would
like to count on us are doubtful,"
Willkie said. "They cannot ascer
tain from our government's wishy
washy attitude towards the problem
of India what we are likely to feel
at the end of the war about all the
other hundreds of millions of East
ern peoples. They cannot tell from
our vague and vacillating talk
whether or not we really do stand
for freedom, or what we mean by
freedom."
The speaker criticized American
policy toward the Eastern peoples,
asserting the administration has
failed to send to these countries
"representatives with authority to
discuss such problems intelligently
and to take realistic steps toward
their solution."
CENSORSHIP 'UNDEMOCRATIC'
The speaker described the work
ing of the present censorship as
"stupid, arbitrary and undemocratic"
and asserted the people should not
remain silent on the military, indus
trial. economic and political conduct
of the war.
This position of silence, he said,
threatens "to become a tight wall
which will keep the truth out and
lock misrepresentation and false
security within ... in many respects
we are not doing a good job: . . . we
are on the road to winning the war,
but . . . we run a heavy risk of
spending tar more in men and mate
rials than we need to snend."
