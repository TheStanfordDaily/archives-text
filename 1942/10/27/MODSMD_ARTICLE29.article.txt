### 

Enlisted men in medical training at the San Antonio Cadet Center—only such center in ihe
U.S. Army Air Force—are shown here drilling in proper methods of carrying wounded,
under actual wartime conditions.


Simulating actual war conditions on their training field at Fort Bragg, N.C., parachute
troops land, pass through a smoke screen, and plunge into a shell hole. Bayonets are
ready for the enemy. Paratroopers must get out of their chutes and secure their weapons
with unbelievable swiftness.


American Rangers are using the blitzed areas of London to learn the technigue of street
fighting. Upper left, Ranger scales perpendicular wall. Upper right, Rangers peppered
these targets from 100 yards away while on the run. Note pasted-over bullet holes. Bottom,
high explosive has just been detonated and Rangers advance out of cover to inspect their
work. Secrecy in placing the explosives and speed in getting away from the scene are
essential.
