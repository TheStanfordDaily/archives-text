# Orchestra Needs Able Musicians
## 
### 
Students or faculty members who
can play any orchestra instrument
have been asked to turn out for the
Stanford Symphony Orchestra by
Director Ferenc Molnar. Rehearsals
are held once weekly, this week's
meeting being held on Wednesday
instead of Thursday night because of
the Concert Series.
The orchestra, which now includes
.'5B students and 27 faculty and out
| side members, will play its first full
concert on Tuesday Series Jan. 26.
A chamber group to be selected from
the orchestra will play on Nov. 11,
and a string group will participate
! in an Oratio to be given the first
week in December in Memorial
| Church.
According to both Manager Ellwyn
; Bugge and Director Molnar, the or
; chestra is showing promise and may
well turn out to be one of Stanford's
best symphony groups in recent
years.
