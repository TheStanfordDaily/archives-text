### BOB SONTAG 
CATURDAY'S LEFTOVERS:
k Stanford had two extra coaches at Kezar, Ensign Frankie Albert,
and Lieut. James Lawscn. The pair handled the phone communications
between the press box and the bench . . . This dept. had the distinction
of being the only football prognosticant to pick our Indians over Southern
California (also picked Idaho over Oregon—Oregon won, 28-0. but who

cares, the home victory really meant
something) . . . Washington State
dumped Oregon State and now only
Washington, loser to California, and
Idaho, stands in the Cougars' way of
ending the season with a six won,
one lost record . . . Stanford can tie
that record by beating the Bruins,
Huskies, Ducks, and Bears, in that
order . . . It's a big order . . . Ray
Hammett, top quarterback, received
a letter yesterday from the Phila
delphia Eagles, pro club, asking that
he join their National Football
League Draft list —Ray is signed up
with Uncle Sam and the army en
listed reserve, but he wrote 'em any
way. If the war should be over
sooner than the most optimistic per
son thinks it will be, you may see
Hammett sporting an Eagle jersey
. . . One paper called Chuck Taylor's
Saturday touchdown "grand lar
ceny"—we call it heads-up football,
Prescott ... A United Press dis
patch rolled into The Daily Shack
Sunday night about 11 bells, giving
all-American mention to Ed Stamm
and "Vic" Vucinich. Don't worry,

we wised him up by mail. The report said nil about Taylor, not even a
mention. We thought (hat a definite oversight and said so in the afore
mentioned communique . . . 'Tain't official yet, but if you want to see
Taylor steal the ball from Micky McCardle again—and in slow motion
too—watch The Daily for an announcement of the game pictures. They'll
probably be shown Thursday afternoon at the Education Building . . . We
are all ready to pick Stanford over UCLA by ? points, but consider the
passing ability of one Bub Waterfield first. The Cards' pass-defense must
triple in effectiveness by next Saturday afternoon . . . Some said Marchie
Schwartz couldn't do it—maybe—when Clark Shaughnessy left Stanford
holding the bag of football material that had lost most of its satelliles like
Albert, Kmetovie, Meyer, et al. But patience was more than rewarded and
those who thought it couldn't be done now have more respect for Schwartz.
With an undermanned coaching staff, he's doing a magnificent job . . .
Don Selby, former Daily sports editor and managing editor, left the Farm
Sunday to a little enlightening in Los Angeles. Don's Stanford publicity
director and he's got something to talk about for our friends, and enemies,
too, who live down South way . . . Washington State and Oregon State, it
is reported, have canceled their games with the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
School. That was before the Cougars met Southern California and lost.
Neither wanted a dent in its record, but Stanford's record will be far bet
ter than the Cougars' if it licks the Bruins, and anyway, who wants to play
a record with a 2G-12 hole in it? Professor William Owen, while in San
Diego on business, will contact the naval station there to arrange a football
game for the fight-starved Papoose gridders, who haven't got another con
test lined up until Nov. 7 and that's with the California freshipen . . .
When El Cuadro upset Phi Psi we knew Stanford could upset Southern
California . . . there's no telling what a spirited team can do on the grid
iron . . . Maybe, as forecast, it was the slight chill in the Saturday air that
gave the Indians that extra "oomph." Whatever it was, hope the weather
man in Los Angeles can plan it that way again.
Just heard that Bruno Banducci also received a letter from the Eagles
recently, as did several other Stanford seniors . . . checkup tomorrow will
reveal all.
