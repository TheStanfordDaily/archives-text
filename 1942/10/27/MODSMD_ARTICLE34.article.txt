# Brooke's Pass Keeps Kappa Sigs in Running
## 
### 
Johnny Brooke of Kappa Sigma
produced a touchdown pass to
Blaine Murray on the last play of
their intramural grid mix with the
Delts yesterday to bring the sea
son's first tie score, 13-13.
In a way it was retribution for
the Delts, who pulled the same
shenanigan to win over Sigma Nu,
6-0, last week. Doc Mason, the boy
who was responsible for the Delts'
first win, sparked them again.
He passed to Pete Bosche for the
first score, then connected with
baseball teammate Ward Walkup
for another in the second half.
Brooke had previously put his
brothers in the game with a scoring
pitch to Bob Henry, followed by
one of George Heinzie's shoeless
conversions.
THE PAY-OFF
After many frantic passes in the
second half, with the Delts still
leading, 13-7, the Kappa Sigs finally
connected. The tie will be played
off at Director Harry Wolter's dis
cretion.
Meanwhile, as Firehouse rolled
over the Phi Kaps to no one's great
surprise, 19-0, Sigma Nu popped
back into the picture with a 12-0
win over the Breakers. Bob Slater
wheeled 25 yards after an intercep
tion to cinch the game. Elongated
Bob Dean had blocked a Breaker
kick in the end zone for a six-point j
lead early in the first quarter.
For the record, the blaze chasers' j
scores against the Phi Kaps were |
the efforts of Frank Wheeler, 12 |
points, and Jerry Roinsteadt, (5 I

points.
The Zetes got all possible breath
out of a scheduled breather when
El Campo didn't show up. Another
gift by forfeit: Theta Delt 1, Phi
Sig 0.
Sigma Chi beat the Kappa Alphas,
6-0, on a first half touchdown by
Don Smith. He loped 25 yards for
the lone score. The Kappa Alphas
popped back to threaten in the sec
ond half but the gun ended it be
fore they got within praying dis
tance.
ZETES BREATHE
Each team has three games left
before the title play-offs start. The
following tilts are left for the more
prominent teams: El Cuadro (whose
Bob Fair has tossed them right into
the favorite limelight) still faces
D.U., Med School, and Theta Chi;
the humiliated Phi Psi's have the
Sig Alphs, D.U.'s, and Theta Chi's.
In the close play of League 4,
the Firehouse has its three tough
est left, the Sigma Nil's, Dolts, and
Kappa Sigs. Zetes must meet Theta
Delt, Sigma Chi, and Kappa Alpha.
The Dekes have A.K.L.. Phi Delt,
El Capitan, and Beta on the list.
For our money, a good play-off
would match Cuadro-Toro, Zcte-
Firehouse, and Deke-Fiji.

Sigma Chi beat the Kappa Alphas,
6-0, on a first half touchdown by
Don Smith. He loped 25 yards for
the lone score. The Kappa Alphas
popped back to threaten in the sec
ond half but the gun ended it be
fore they got within praying dis
tance.
ZETES BREATHE
Each team has three games left
before the title play-offs start. The
following tilts are left for the more
prominent teams: El Cuadro (whose
Bob Fair has tossed them right into
the favorite limelight) still faces
D.U., Med School, and Theta Chi;
the humiliated Phi Psi's have the
Sig Alphs, D.U.'s, and Theta Chi's.
In the close play of League 4,
the Firehouse has its three tough
est left, the Sigma Nil's, Dolts, and
Kappa Sigs. Zetes must meet Theta
Delt, Sigma Chi, and Kappa Alpha.
The Dekes have A.K.L.. Phi Delt,
El Capitan, and Beta on the list.
For our money, a good play-off
would match Cuadro-Toro, Zcte-
Firehouse, and Deke-Fiji.
Johnny Brooke of Kappa Sigma
produced a touchdown pass to
Blaine Murray on the last play of
their intramural grid mix with the
Delts yesterday to bring the sea
son's first tie score, 13-13.
In a way it was retribution for
the Delts, who pulled the same
shenanigan to win over Sigma Nu,
6-0, last week. Doc Mason, the boy
who was responsible for the Delts'
first win, sparked them again.
He passed to Pete Bosche for the
first score, then connected with
baseball teammate Ward Walkup
for another in the second half.
Brooke had previously put his
brothers in the game with a scoring
pitch to Bob Henry, followed by
one of George Heinzie's shoeless
conversions.
THE PAY-OFF
After many frantic passes in the
second half, with the Delts still
leading, 13-7, the Kappa Sigs finally
connected. The tie will be played
off at Director Harry Wolter's dis
cretion.
Meanwhile, as Firehouse rolled
over the Phi Kaps to no one's great
surprise, 19-0, Sigma Nu popped
back into the picture with a 12-0
win over the Breakers. Bob Slater
wheeled 25 yards after an intercep
tion to cinch the game. Elongated
Bob Dean had blocked a Breaker
kick in the end zone for a six-point j
lead early in the first quarter.
For the record, the blaze chasers' j
scores against the Phi Kaps were |
the efforts of Frank Wheeler, 12 |
points, and Jerry Roinsteadt, (5 I

points.
The Zetes got all possible breath
out of a scheduled breather when
El Campo didn't show up. Another
gift by forfeit: Theta Delt 1, Phi
Sig 0.
