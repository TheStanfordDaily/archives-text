# Champs To Play Farm Mermen
## 
### 
Fresh from a pair of solid wins
over the Navy Pre-flight teams,
Stanfox*d's undefeated varsity water
polo team will battle the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club team in its
toughest contest of the season to
date here Saturday afternoon.
Northern California champions
for many years and undefeated for
three years, the Clubmen are for
midable opponents for the high
flying Indian mermen. The Post
Streeters defeated the Pre-flight
men 12-7 and 13-6, while Stanford
defeated them 12-7 and 17-0 in a
pair of contests last week.
Great improvement has been
shown by Coach Ernie Brandsten's
reserves until he now has two full
teams of very capable players.
Jack Carpenter, who showed up
very well against the Navy last
week, is pushing Bill Mapel, a
1941 regular, for his forward posi
tion. Captain Hadley Bacon and
Emmett Cashin seem to be retaining
their grip on their jobs.
Bob Jones has returned to the
squad and has shown up well at
centerback although Chet Newman
has developed into a very capable
reserve. Ted Munroe, varsity swim
star, is threatening one of the guard
jobs of A1 Wecden and Dick Nar
ver, a pair of sophomores.
