Put unused Concert Scries tickets
in the hands of service men—don't
let them go to waste! There are al
ways a few students who buy tickets
to Concert Series events and find al
the last minute that they are unable
to use them. To those students tht
USO committee of the War Boarc
is sending out a special appeal foi
tickets to the Jascha Heifetz conceri
scheduled for this Thursday night
Committee members are anxious tc
have as many tickets as possible
j turned into the War Board to giv«
I to service men in nearby camps.
