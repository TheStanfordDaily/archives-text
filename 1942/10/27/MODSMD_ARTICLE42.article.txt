# Second Front Aims
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: This editorial was written by
Ray Hayes, '46. We teel that it demonstrates
active and intelligent thinking on a problem
which concerns all of us.)
WITH the Nazis apparently still gaining
ground in Russia, and with the Commu
nists and many others, including Mr. Willkie,
boiling throughout the United Nations, this Sec
ond Front business is becoming an increasingly
heated matter each day. It appears that unless
Allied leaders make a straightforward an
nouncement of unified Second Front aims—at
least before the year is out—a serious United
Nations split may eventually occur.
The Communists and other leading Second
Front agitators are by no means trying to hide
their distrust of the men running the British
government and of the combined Second Front
aims of the United Nations. They claim that
Allied leaders still won't help themselves, until
they absolutely have to, if helping themselves
means also helping Russia.
In support of this last statement, it is recalled
that the Allies on past occasions have been wont
to injure their own welfare, in a large degree
because they thought Russia and Communism
were their real enemies.
The Allies, fearful of Communistic aims, re
fused to help Russia and the others fighting the
Fascists in Spain. Russia was snubbed in the
Munich affair because it alone of the nations
that had promised to defend Czechoslovakia
suggested that the promise be kept.
The type of people responsible for Allied
conduct in each of these situations have been
aptly called the "Munich Leftovers." They now
claim, because of Russia's aggressive teamwork
with Germany, and because of Russia's refusal
to announce precise post-war intentions, noth
ing should be done now which will enable
Moscow to occupy a stable post-war position.
In view of Allied instability in the Spanish
and Czech affairs, however, it should have jolted
no one that the shunned Russians agreed to the
Nazi non-aggression pact. This pact and Rus
sia's subsequent aggression in the Baltic area
are merely the clever moves of a nation which
knew it couldn't be sentimental with ANYONE
in the same world with the tricky Nazis. Surely
Russia's great resistance against the Nazis is
indicative that the realistic Stalin was prepared
for the Nazis to break their word.
Because this matter of aggression is men
tioned, and is being pressed, however, it is ap
propriate to comment that Russia doesn't par
ticularly like the situation in India. And neither
does anyone else.
Answering charges that they are discriminat
ing against Russia, some Allied leaders use the
screen that until sufficient air power and supply
ships are obtained, a Second Front is imprac
tical. This might be true, but it seems acutely
strange, then, that the Allies continue to employ,
and thereby deplete, large numbers of planes
and ships in order to send comparatively mea
ger supplies to Russia.
Russia's need for supplies is vital. If genu
inely assured, however, that the Allies would
concentrate materials on opening a Second
Front, the Russians would hardly ask one more
tank or can of peaches from the Allies.
It it also answered in Allied quarters that
military leaders do not yet advise a Second
Front. True, many of them don't (some of them
do!), but Mr. Willkie's statement that the mili
tary men may need some "political prodding"
presents us with some enlightenment as to just
what the situation is among our leaders.
The latter have told us that the United Nations
are finished making mistakes. One of the most
serious, as we now admit, was waiting. Hitler
may never actually lick the Russians, but given
time, he is going to see that the United Nations
have a hell of a time trying to kick him out of
Europe.
At present we're still giving him that time.

tank or can of peaches from the Allies.
It it also answered in Allied quarters that
military leaders do not yet advise a Second
Front. True, many of them don't (some of them
do!), but Mr. Willkie's statement that the mili
tary men may need some "political prodding"
presents us with some enlightenment as to just
what the situation is among our leaders.
The latter have told us that the United Nations
are finished making mistakes. One of the most
serious, as we now admit, was waiting. Hitler
may never actually lick the Russians, but given
time, he is going to see that the United Nations
have a hell of a time trying to kick him out of
Europe.
At present we're still giving him that time.

which concerns all of us.)
WITH the Nazis apparently still gaining
ground in Russia, and with the Commu
nists and many others, including Mr. Willkie,
boiling throughout the United Nations, this Sec
ond Front business is becoming an increasingly
heated matter each day. It appears that unless
Allied leaders make a straightforward an
nouncement of unified Second Front aims—at
least before the year is out—a serious United
Nations split may eventually occur.
The Communists and other leading Second
Front agitators are by no means trying to hide
their distrust of the men running the British
government and of the combined Second Front
aims of the United Nations. They claim that
Allied leaders still won't help themselves, until
they absolutely have to, if helping themselves
means also helping Russia.
In support of this last statement, it is recalled
that the Allies on past occasions have been wont
to injure their own welfare, in a large degree
because they thought Russia and Communism
were their real enemies.
The Allies, fearful of Communistic aims, re
fused to help Russia and the others fighting the
Fascists in Spain. Russia was snubbed in the
Munich affair because it alone of the nations
that had promised to defend Czechoslovakia
suggested that the promise be kept.
The type of people responsible for Allied
conduct in each of these situations have been
aptly called the "Munich Leftovers." They now
claim, because of Russia's aggressive teamwork
with Germany, and because of Russia's refusal
to announce precise post-war intentions, noth
ing should be done now which will enable
Moscow to occupy a stable post-war position.
In view of Allied instability in the Spanish
and Czech affairs, however, it should have jolted
no one that the shunned Russians agreed to the
Nazi non-aggression pact. This pact and Rus
sia's subsequent aggression in the Baltic area
are merely the clever moves of a nation which
knew it couldn't be sentimental with ANYONE
in the same world with the tricky Nazis. Surely
Russia's great resistance against the Nazis is
indicative that the realistic Stalin was prepared
for the Nazis to break their word.
Because this matter of aggression is men
tioned, and is being pressed, however, it is ap
propriate to comment that Russia doesn't par
ticularly like the situation in India. And neither
does anyone else.
Answering charges that they are discriminat
ing against Russia, some Allied leaders use the
screen that until sufficient air power and supply
ships are obtained, a Second Front is imprac
tical. This might be true, but it seems acutely
strange, then, that the Allies continue to employ,
and thereby deplete, large numbers of planes
and ships in order to send comparatively mea
ger supplies to Russia.
Russia's need for supplies is vital. If genu
inely assured, however, that the Allies would
concentrate materials on opening a Second
Front, the Russians would hardly ask one more
tank or can of peaches from the Allies.

Answering charges that they are discriminat

and thereby deplete, large numbers of planes

what the situation is among our leaders.

WITH the Nazis apparently still gaining
ground in Russia, and with the Commu
nists and many others, including Mr. Willkie,
boiling throughout the United Nations, this Sec
ond Front business is becoming an increasingly
heated matter each day. It appears that unless
Allied leaders make a straightforward an
nouncement of unified Second Front aims—at
least before the year is out—a serious United
Nations split may eventually occur.
The Communists and other leading Second
Front agitators are by no means trying to hide
their distrust of the men running the British
government and of the combined Second Front
aims of the United Nations. They claim that
Allied leaders still won't help themselves, until
they absolutely have to, if helping themselves
means also helping Russia.
In support of this last statement, it is recalled
that the Allies on past occasions have been wont
to injure their own welfare, in a large degree
because they thought Russia and Communism
were their real enemies.
The Allies, fearful of Communistic aims, re
fused to help Russia and the others fighting the
Fascists in Spain. Russia was snubbed in the
Munich affair because it alone of the nations
that had promised to defend Czechoslovakia
suggested that the promise be kept.
The type of people responsible for Allied
conduct in each of these situations have been
aptly called the "Munich Leftovers." They now
claim, because of Russia's aggressive teamwork
with Germany, and because of Russia's refusal
to announce precise post-war intentions, noth
ing should be done now which will enable
Moscow to occupy a stable post-war position.
In view of Allied instability in the Spanish
and Czech affairs, however, it should have jolted
no one that the shunned Russians agreed to the
Nazi non-aggression pact. This pact and Rus
sia's subsequent aggression in the Baltic area
are merely the clever moves of a nation which
knew it couldn't be sentimental with ANYONE
in the same world with the tricky Nazis. Surely
Russia's great resistance against the Nazis is
indicative that the realistic Stalin was prepared
for the Nazis to break their word.
Because this matter of aggression is men
tioned, and is being pressed, however, it is ap
propriate to comment that Russia doesn't par
ticularly like the situation in India. And neither
does anyone else.
