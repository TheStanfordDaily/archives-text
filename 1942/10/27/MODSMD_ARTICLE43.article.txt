The United Nations are on the offensive. For
the |>ast few months, specific details not being avail
able, we have prepared our offensive, and now, on
more than one front, it has been launched.
The first period of the war was more apparent t<>
most people, including myself, as a period of crush
ing military and naval defeats. Asia and Africa
both saw the banners of the United INations over
borne. But, less obviously, it was a period of prepa
ration. We were building our war machine, putting
the nation on a war footing. The only encouraging
news was of increased production, of supplies and
expeditionary forces reaching the fronts, of im
proved tanks and airplanes.
Then there were the battles of the Coral Sea and
Midway, which marked the end of our Pacific de
fensive. There we stopped the japs, cold. We
bombed Tokyo; the Chinese began to roll back to
the coast. The Navy and Marines seized the south
ern Solomons, forcing Japan's attention to those
outposts, away from the inviting coasts of Siberia
where, experts predicted widely, the sons of the Sun
were about to strike. A major force has been con
centrated against the American forces on Guadal
canal; the J\ips are held to that one effort. If they
succeed, it would seem, they have not destroyed
our cause; if they fail, they will have been them
selves seriously damaged.
And now on the other outpost of the Allied war
effort, we are driving forward. The target of our
united war effort must always be Germany and
Japan themselves, those hexenkesselen wherein the
war was compounded. But the prelude lo the great
offensive, the Second Front, must be the clearing of
our flanks. And the most exposed of our flanks was
Africa. In the best style of the last war, artillery
barrages, hand-to-hand seizure of each strong point
and foxhole, British, American, Polish, Free French,
Greek. South African, New Zealand, the whole ros
ter of outraged civilization, have advanced against
the Axis in the Sahara, and are still advancing.
We are not neglecting the Continent in our global
strategy, which, I am beginning lo be convinced,
actually exists. France, simmering over the latest
German demands, is being exhorted by every Allied
broadcast to revolt. Allied planes are dropping arms
and explosives lo the captive peoples. And the raids
on Germany and her subject lands are increasing
both in quantity and quality.
Once our flanks are clear, il is not hard to predict
that we will open the Second Front, if our present
efforts do not constitute an acceptable substitute.
