## DEFENDS NORTON 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
A letter in yesterday's Campus Opinion by Mr.
Seoyen represents an attitude of mind that is un
fortunate to say the least. He criticizes History 1942
for attempting some constructive thought regarding
the post-war world. Most informed people, and Mr.
Norton in particular, will acknowledge llie very
great debt which we owe to the Russian armies in
this war. But to say that because of this there is
no Russian problem which must be faced is ex
tremely illogical.
Russia is one of the three countries (Italy and
Japan) which have been on both sides of this war in
the past thirty years. Russia does have a totalitarian
form of government. Russia did take territory
(which may or may not have been rightly hers) by
acts of aggression. Russia is now our partner, and
a signatory to the Atlantic Charter. Thus there arc
two things which must be squared: our idealism
and Russian ability. r l he sooner these are squared
the better we will be able to wage war as a United
Nation. If they are not squared there will ajways
be an element of suspicion in our relations with the
Soviet I nion. Mr. Norton's article was an intelli
gent attempt to face this problem.
Mr. Scoyen goes on to state that we should de
vote our energies now toward winning the war and
"there will be plenty of time for speculation after
we have won the war. Everyone knows, including
Mr. Scoyen, the haste with which the Peace of
Versailles was made, the reasons for that speed, and
the problems it fostered. There is not "plenty of
time after the war to plan the peace for which we
all are hoping. Should any one of us be asked to
{jive up his life without any knowledge of what
lasting good that sacrifice will bring?
If there is any point in fighting Ihis war besides
the desire to build a world where people may live
in "freedom from fear and want" I would like Mr.
Scoyen to state it. And if he should decide that after
all it is not the means but the ends which are most
important â€”well then, should not those ends be as
carefully planned as the means taken to achieve
them ?
