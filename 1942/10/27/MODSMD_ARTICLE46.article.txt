# 'Gay Sisters' Complicated But Amusing
## 
### 
"The Gay Sisters," starring Bar
bara Stanwyck, George Brent, and
Gefaldine Fitzgerald, is now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
This is not the ordinary Holly
wood production. It has a plot
worthy of the name—very compli
cated at times, to be sure, but it's a
nice fantasy, and after a good many
terrific messes when one wonders if
the actors can possibly pull through,
everything manages to end happily.
The story concerns three little
sisters who are left orphans with
nothing to cling to except a half mil
lion dollars. Everything looks rosy
for them (their well stocked wine
cellar occupied many yards of film)
when their father's will and conse
quent lettuce gets tied up.
MATRIMONIAL SNARES
Twenty-three years pass while
stolid judges and lawyers haggle
over technicalities, and the little
sisters, who really aren't very gay
at all, grow more and more broke.
In the meantime, they have all
managed to entangle themselves in
the bonds of matrimony, with none
too happy results.
Fiona, the elder, who promised her
father she would never sell the Gay
lord land, needed some money one
day, and married Geofge Brent on
a one-night stand.
ENDS lIAI'PILY, AS USUAL
Six years later when Brent de
cides he wants their land, and en
counters Fiona's stubborn refusal,
he finds out about his son.
While this is going on, Evelyn the
middle sister, is making eyes at her
younger sister's man, and everyone
is unhappy.
It took a miraculous script writer
to iron out all the difficulties, but he
did and made "The Gay Sisters" a
much better than average entertain
ment feature.
Also playing is "Pierre of the
Plains"—ha-ha.—Glasson.

Fiona, the elder, who promised her
father she would never sell the Gay
lord land, needed some money one
day, and married Geofge Brent on
a one-night stand.

Six years later when Brent de

counters Fiona's stubborn refusal,
he finds out about his son.
While this is going on, Evelyn the
middle sister, is making eyes at her
younger sister's man, and everyone

It took a miraculous script writer
to iron out all the difficulties, but he

much better than average entertain

"The Gay Sisters," starring Bar
bara Stanwyck, George Brent, and
Gefaldine Fitzgerald, is now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
This is not the ordinary Holly
wood production. It has a plot
worthy of the name—very compli
cated at times, to be sure, but it's a
nice fantasy, and after a good many
terrific messes when one wonders if
the actors can possibly pull through,
everything manages to end happily.
The story concerns three little
sisters who are left orphans with
nothing to cling to except a half mil
lion dollars. Everything looks rosy
for them (their well stocked wine
cellar occupied many yards of film)
when their father's will and conse
quent lettuce gets tied up.
MATRIMONIAL SNARES
Twenty-three years pass while
stolid judges and lawyers haggle
over technicalities, and the little
sisters, who really aren't very gay
at all, grow more and more broke.
In the meantime, they have all
managed to entangle themselves in
the bonds of matrimony, with none
