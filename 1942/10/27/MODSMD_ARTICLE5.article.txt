SENDING OUT A WIIALEBOAT, this U.S. destroyer whose guns and crew are shown in the foreground
rescued the crew of this American seaplane patrol bember which had been forced down by engine trouble
"somewhere in the Pacific." The crew, seen on the plane's wing and bow, had bailed all night to prevent the
craft's sinking after the hard landing.
