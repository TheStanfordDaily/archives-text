### 
MOSCOW, Tuesday, Oct. 27
(UP). —German forces have stormed
close to Tuapse on the Caucasus
coast in a drive menacing one of the
last havens for the Soviet Black
Sea fleet, but in Stalingrad the Red
Army has erased the third Nazi
advance in 36 hours with fierce
counter-attacks, it was announced
today.
Mentioning Tuapse, the secondary
naval base 80 miles below Novoros
sisk, for the first time as an area of
operations, a Soviet communique
said that in fighting northeast of
there an attacking Red Army unit
wiped out up to a company of
German officers and men.
Tuapse lies at the head of a
railroad from the great oil port of
Batum, 250 miles to the southeast
near the Turkish border, and is on
a branch of the Trans-Caucasian
railway from Baku on the Caspian.
Tuapse's usefulness was greatly
reduced when the Germans cap
tured the Maikop oil fields and the
pipeline junction of Amavir to the
east but is still virtually the only
good Red Fleet harbor north of
Batum.
Voluntary restraint by consumers
in buying unnecessary goods will
reduce the number of cases in which
rationing is required.
