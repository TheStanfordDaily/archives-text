# Who's Got Amphenol? Asks EE Department

### 
They're about as close to noth
ing as anything can be, yet they're
holding up one of Stanford's most
important research projects.
They're worth about $2, mostly
postage at that. They're practically
invisible, for they're but four thin
sheets of amphcnol, a celluloid
like material.
The EE Department, with an
AIA priority, had to wait three
weeks to get them from San
Francisco, and the material, used
as insulation in precision instru
ments, may be impossible to re
place.
The sheets, two of them 4x4xl't
inches, and two 4x4xl/16, were in
a box in the back of a Corp Yard
truck, and the box, amphcnol and
all, bounced off into the street in
front of Encina. The driver, dis
covering his loss later, dashed
back to find the empty box, but
no amphcnol.
Whoever has it can't be having
much fun with it; it won't burn
very well, you can't see through
it too well, and you can't cat it.
All it docs is melt, and then only
at a high temperature.
But it would make the EE or the
Physics Departments very, very
happy if someone would only give
it back to them.
