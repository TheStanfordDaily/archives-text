# Plumbing Building Parking Banned
## 
### 
After a short meeting yesterday
afternoon, Men's Council decided to
continue meeting on Monday af
ternoon at 5 in the Nitery. At yes
terday's meeting, the group heard
several traffic cases.
George Tolman, council chair
man, issued a request to students
to stop parking in front of the
plumbing building across from the
B.A.C. Three violators have been
cited for parking in this spot, but
their sentences were suspended be
cause it was their first offense, and
because the new ruling is not gen
erally known.
