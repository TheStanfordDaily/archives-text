# All-Student Gaieties Band Passed
## Excom Recommends Big Game Dance Be Held at Stanford 
### JOHN HORRALL 
What usually is a routine passing
of Dramatic Council minutes turned
into a warm discussion at last night's
Excom meeting when Student Man
ager Bill Moran questioned the ad
visability of having a 24-piece stu
dent orchestra for the Gaieties as
recommended by Dramatic Council.
Dick Rabbett, head of the orches
tra. and Bob O'Neill, Gaieties' di
rector, maintained that only a 24-
piece orchestra could produce the
desired effects and that the expense
would actually be much less than
that entailed last year by hiring an
outside orchestra.
Excom unanimously agreed to ap
prove the minutes, which gave an
automatic sanction to the 24-piece
student orchestra.
BIG GAME DAME
Hays Busch and Shelly Parker
presented the completed plans to
date of the proposed Cardinals
sponsored Big Game dance. Ted
Eberle's skeleton committees were
approved with the suggestion that
more students other than juniors be
included.
Excom went on record as recom
mending that Cardinals go ahead
with the present plans of holding
the dance on the campus. Trans
portation problems presented Cardi
nals with practically no other choice,
Busch explained.
Busch announced that Cardinals
will sponsor a jolly-up Nov. 20, the
day before the Big Game, in the
Nitery from 4 to 6 p.m.
