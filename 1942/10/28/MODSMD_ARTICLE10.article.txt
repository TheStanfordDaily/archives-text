# Talent Crowds Acting Try outs
## 
### 
A goodly crowd turned out for
the final acting tryouts for the 1942
Big Game Gaieties last night, and
Ram's Head was pleasantly sur
prised and well satisfied with the
new faces which usher in a raft of
new talent to the Stanford stage.
Those who are chosen from the
tryoutees as members of the cast
will be individually notified this
afternoon in time to attend a general
cast assembly tonight at 8 in Me
morial Auditorium.
Correcting an error in yesterday's
daily, musicians interested in trying
out for the Gaieties orchestra should
contact Dick Rabbett at Palo Alto
22492, instead of 22942.
Technical Director Hal Levitt is
still in need of persons to work be
hind stage on the construction,
staging, make-up, lighting, costume,
property, and script work, and other
important jobs. He may be reached
at the Kappa Alpha house, or per
sons interested may see Paul Hos
teller in the Memorial Theater work
shop.
With the cast chosen and scripts
virtually completed, production of
the Gaieties is gaining momentum,
rolling along at a fine clip, and the
director, Bob O'Neill, says "things
are just dandy."
