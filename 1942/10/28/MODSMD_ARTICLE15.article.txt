CAIRO, Oct. 27 (UP). â€” Allied
troops advanced slowly but steadily
on the Egyptian battlefront today,
picking their way through deep
mine and barbed wire defenses and
mopping up isolated Axis units at
bayonet point, while protecting Al
lied fliers claimed 21 more Axis
planes shot down, two supply ships
sunk and two desert truck cara
vans scattered.
The Allied advance already had
carried as much as four and a half
miles into the north, central and
south sectors of the El Alamein
line, and mop-up detachments were
fast obliterating the enemy pockets
of resistance left behind by the ad
vance guard.
A new burst of violence in the
air resulted from the appearance of
considerable numbers of Italian
planes over the desert and from
Rommel's desperate attempts to land
sea-borne supplies at ports dan
gerously near the front.
Allied heavy and light bombers,
long range fighters and torpedo
planes intercepted a south-bound
Axis convoy between Derna and
Tobruk and sank a tanker and a
large merchant ship. Two escorting
Heinkel bombers were shot down in
that battle.
One of yesterday's outstanding
feats was performed by U.S. fliers
who shot down four Italian Macchi
fighters. The American squadron's
businesslike report read: "We saw
four Macchi-202's below us. We
dived at them and shot them all
down. All four were seen to hit
the ground. All our aircraft re
teturned safely."
