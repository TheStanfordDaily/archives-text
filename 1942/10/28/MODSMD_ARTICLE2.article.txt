# Minute Maids Set For Debut Tonight
## 
### 
The All-University debate to be
held this evening at 7:30 in the Edu
cation Auditorium will mark the
first appearance of a new campus
war group, the Minute Maids.
The Minute Maids are a volunteer
group of Stanford women which has
been organized for the sole purpose
of selling war stamps at all large
campus gatherings. Stanford's first
group consists of six regulars and
six alternates, all of whom will ap
pear briefly during the debate in
rotating order. Each woman will
wear a white collar and a blue halo
so that she will be easily recogniz
able.
The idea, first tried out in Idaho
last spring, was so successful that
it has since spread throug most of
the nation. The Stanford group,
however, will be California's first
division of Minute Maids.
All Stanford women interested in
becoming Minute Maids should ap
ply to the office of the Stanford War
Board.
