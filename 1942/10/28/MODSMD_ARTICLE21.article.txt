Some thinking points as yon pass
a Stanford War Stamp Booth to

. . . one jeep might mean the
losing or winning of a hattle in
which Stanford men are living or
dying—today as a student hody
you can buy three more jeeps.
... the government may buy
those jeeps anyway, BUT, if you
and the other 129,999,999 people
like you don't foot the bill by con
sistent. proportionate donations,
inflationary currency must,
... when you contribute you are
giving the government money
hacked by actual bank deposits
. . . if you buy a coke instead, the
government must create "printing
press" money to fight your war.
... an excellent article, "In
visible Greenbacks" by Harry
Schcrman puts it this way—"cold
arithmetic leads to the simple,
soher, cold truth . . . only personal
savings can save our civilization
now, the savings of tens of mil
lions of little people all garnered
together and thrown into the
breech."
. . . by little people he means
college students as well as busi
nessmen. undertakers, opera stars,
and a million etceteras.
. . . Stanford's quota today calls
for one stamp from each of you
. . . no matter what your military
standing, your job today is—
stumped out for you.
