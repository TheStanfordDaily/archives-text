# American Navy Sinks Two Jap Destroyers; Allies Advance In Egypt
## U.S. Forces Hurt 3 Enemy Vessels; Hurt Enemy Back 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 27 (UP).—
American forces, fighting back fu
riously in the Battle of the Solo
mons—have sunk two Japanese de
stroyers, damaged three other en
emy warships and hurled back Jap
ground troops who had succeeded
in piercing American lines on Gua
dalcanal, the Navy announced to
night.
A Jap battleship was among tlio
three vessels damaged. The others
were a destroyer and a cruiser.
Additionally, hits were scored on
two cruisers and an aircraft car
rier which may have been damaged
previously.
Only new losses for the Ameri
cans were the U.S.S. Seminole, a
fleet tug, and a small harbor patrol
boat which were sunk near the is
land of Tulagi by a Jap destroyer.
U.S. shore batteries opened up
and scored three hits on the attack
ing destroyer, which later was fur
ther damaged by Grumman "Wild
cat" fighter planes from the U.S.
airport on Guadalcanal.
Indications, meanwhile, that the
land fighting was progressing at a
savage tempo were seen in the terse
disclosure:
POSITIONS REGAINED
"During the night of Oct. 25-2(5,
enemy troops were active on Gua
dalcanal and succeeded in piercing
our lines on the south side of the
airfield. Army troops threw back
the attack and regained their posi
tions."
While the Army troops were
hurling back the enemy in the
south, Marines on the west flank
"reported small gains in heavy
fighting."
There still was no indication that
the main fleet units of the opposing
forces had come to grips and it ap
peared that each still was jockey
ing for a position from which to de
liver the death blow, leaving tor
pedo planes and bombers to carry
the burden meanwhile.
U.S. OUTNUMBERED
On the outcome of the sea battle
—greatest of World War II and
with the American forces appar
ently outnumbered — depends the
fate of soldiers and Marines on Gua
dalcanal and perhaps control of the
whole southwest Pacific.
The Seminole and the U.S. patrol
boat were .sunk Sunday morning, at
about the same time that U.S. mine
sweepers near Guadalcanal en
gaged three enemy destroyers.
Navy and Marine Corps dive bomb
ers joined the attack and two of
the destroyers were sunk.
On Friday morning, U.S. bombers
and fighters from Guadalcanal again
attacked enemy cruisers and de
stroyers previously attacked Sun
day afternoon near Florida Island,
about 30 miles north of Guadalca
nal. A direct hit was scored on an
enemy cruiser.
BATTLE ALL OVER
These actions in and around Gua
dalcanal were only part of the vast,
battle raging over hundreds of
square miles of the Solomons.
Some 400 miles to the northeast
of Guadalcanal—east of the Stewart
Islands—American and Japanese sea
and air forces were locked in a sav
age battle.
There, one enemy cruiser was
"badly damaged" and a Jap battle
ship was hit by American forces,
presumably air as well as sea units,
during the vicious fight in which
two Jap carriers previously had
been damaged.
