# FARMERS TURN CLIMBERS
## 
### AL HEDDEN 
To put it mildly, rock-climbing is
he story of rope and steel and guts.
IVilh a rope the climber is safe; with
steel he can cling to the vertical
faces; and only with guts can he
ever win.
Some people call it nerve: others,
idiocy. Yet whichever it is, there is
a fatal fascination to scaling cliffs
for those who have it. Possibly I
should not say "fatal," for 99 per
cent of all rock-climbers die from
auto accidents, bathroom falls, etc.
But the fascination of climbing
where none has been before and of
seeing the untamed beauty of moun
tain nests splashed with snow is in
deed fatal to 99 per cent of the peo
ple who once try it.
Unknown to most Stanfordites is
the fact that two of the outstanding
rock-climbers in California are here
at Stanford. Bruce Meyer, '45. won
the 1941 presidency of the Polo
nvmium Club, which is composed of
rocl: - climbers of the Sierra Club.
1" addition, he led the first ascent of
the w<: st face of lower Yosemite Falls
thi pa. t summer. Take a look at
thai west face some time.
AS IST ANT AS CLIMBER
i'r. Morgan Harris, research as
si :..nt in the Anatomy Department,
is the other outstanding Farm
clim'.er. Many difficult piton climbs
in Yosemite Valley and various
parts of the high Sierra have been
pioneered under his leadership. This
la : summer he and Bruce, with two
other Sierra Club members, made
the I 'r.'t ascent of the north wall of
Cm. ker Point, in Yosemite.
I■ i the adjoining picture, Morgan
can he seen climbing the rugged
f; of Yosemite's Higher Cathedral
Sj/ra. This type of climbing is the
mo ! difficult, since he must literally
'di his way up the solid granite."
Because of the high angle of the
roe!;, this Class 6 climbing is ex
tremely tiring and exceedingly slow,
for each piton must be hammered
into a suitable crack with a good
deal of care and thoroughly tested
before it can be trusted. But even
so one pulls out now and then, and
from this group the 1 per cent fa
cility is derived.
Today, however, rock-climbing is
going out of the local picture. There
is no longer any time for such a lux
ury on the home front. Instead,
thert ■ is only time to become doctors,
enainers, and officers. Yet, through
the peace-time enthusiasm of these
Stanford men and of others like
them, the United States has some of
the best trained and the most highly
experienced mountain troops in the
world.
