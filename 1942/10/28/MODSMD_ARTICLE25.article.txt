# Dallas Pilot Shoots Down Seventh Plane In Egypt
## 
### 
WITH THE ALLIED AIR FORCES
IN EGYPT Oct. 26 (Delayed) (U.R)—
The Messerschmitt-109 was squarely
in the spitfire's gun sights and pilot
Jack Curry, Dallas, Tex., turned
loose a fairly short burst. It punched
a hole in the right wing.
A second burst tore off the Hun's
landing gear. A third started smoke
pouring from the engine and mo
ments later the Messerschmitt spun
crazily to earth, wrecked and in
flames. The German pilot died with
the plane.
It was the seventh Axis plane shot
down by Lieut. Curry since he ar
rived in the desert from Malta last
July and he told about it in his Texas
drawl as he unfastened his para
chute straps.
His Spitfire squadron, he said, was
on a "delousing expedition" to clear
the skies of Axis planes to make way
for Allied bombers which were to
follow.
"We sighted the Hun at 10.000
feet and our squadron pounced on
him. We dived and chased him to
5,000 feet when suddenly I got right
in behind him. My first burst crashed
through his wing and he jerked up
as if trying to climb out of range. I
caught him again and his landing
gear fell off. My third burst set him
afire."
Curry is a veteran airman who
fought in the battle of Britain and
then spent several months downing
Axis raiders over Malta. Now he's
doing his part in the African of
fensive to keep the air clear of en
emy planes.
In addition to the Messerschmitt
be bagged today, he has downed
four other German fighters and two
Italian Macchis since arriving from
Malta. He also got a third credit for
shooting down a German Junkers
transport.

"We got that Junkers one day
when we were out to 'clobber' an
Axis supply train," he said. "Three
of us were cruising along when we
sighted the transport plane. All
three of us got squirts at him and
he went down in flames."
JUNKERS DOWNED
Curry belongs to the crack '"Coun
ty of London" Spitfire squadron
whose leader is A. V. Clowes of |
Nottingham, Eng.
During the battle of Britain, the
squadron performed the remarkable
feat of destroying 43 enemy aircraft
in one day and thereby won the
coveted crest—the Sword of London
engraved in wings.
In Egypt, the squadron has shot
down 18 planes, probably downed 13
more and damaged 22.

caught him again and his landing
gear fell off. My third burst set him
afire."
Curry is a veteran airman who
fought in the battle of Britain and
then spent several months downing
Axis raiders over Malta. Now he's
doing his part in the African of
fensive to keep the air clear of en
emy planes.
In addition to the Messerschmitt
be bagged today, he has downed
four other German fighters and two
Italian Macchis since arriving from
Malta. He also got a third credit for
shooting down a German Junkers
transport.

"We got that Junkers one day
when we were out to 'clobber' an
Axis supply train," he said. "Three
of us were cruising along when we
sighted the transport plane. All
three of us got squirts at him and
he went down in flames."
JUNKERS DOWNED
Curry belongs to the crack '"Coun
ty of London" Spitfire squadron
whose leader is A. V. Clowes of |
Nottingham, Eng.
During the battle of Britain, the
squadron performed the remarkable
feat of destroying 43 enemy aircraft
in one day and thereby won the
coveted crest—the Sword of London
engraved in wings.
In Egypt, the squadron has shot
down 18 planes, probably downed 13
more and damaged 22.

The Messerschmitt-109 was squarely
in the spitfire's gun sights and pilot
Jack Curry, Dallas, Tex., turned
loose a fairly short burst. It punched
a hole in the right wing.
A second burst tore off the Hun's
landing gear. A third started smoke
pouring from the engine and mo
ments later the Messerschmitt spun
crazily to earth, wrecked and in
flames. The German pilot died with
the plane.
It was the seventh Axis plane shot
down by Lieut. Curry since he ar
rived in the desert from Malta last
July and he told about it in his Texas
drawl as he unfastened his para
chute straps.
His Spitfire squadron, he said, was
on a "delousing expedition" to clear
the skies of Axis planes to make way
for Allied bombers which were to
follow.
"We sighted the Hun at 10.000
feet and our squadron pounced on
him. We dived and chased him to
5,000 feet when suddenly I got right
in behind him. My first burst crashed
through his wing and he jerked up
as if trying to climb out of range. I
caught him again and his landing
gear fell off. My third burst set him
afire."
