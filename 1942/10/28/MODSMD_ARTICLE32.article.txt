# HELSER CALLS SWIMMING WORK
## Review Five-Year Career of Champ 
### KAY SCHWARTZ

"Competitive swimming is the
most nerve-wracking and gruelling
business in the world. A swimmer
works like a demon to become a
champion and then in just one race
all the fame and glory he or she
has worked to achieve can be swept
away as quickly as it came."
Brenda Reiser, dark curly haired
freshman, climbed out of the Wom
en's Pool and shook her head bit
terly as she spoke those words.
She's Brenda Helser, Stanford
freshman, now, but in the last five
years she has posted the fastest 100-
yard time of any woman swimmer in
the United States and has tied the
world's 100-yard record set by Hel
ene Madison.
She began her career as a cham
pion swimmer five years ago in Port
land, Ore., when she was just a pig
tailed kid who loved to swim. That
love for swimming didn't come to
her naturally, she admits, for when
she was seven she was frightened of
the water. But rather than admit
ting it to anyone she made herself
learn to swim.
"When I was about 12, people be
gan telling me that I should take up
swimming seriously. So one day in
the Portland Athletic Club I walked
up to Mr. Cody, the famous swim
ming coach, and told him I wanted
to swim on his team. I swam one
lap for him and have been one of
his 'kids' ever since."
Being one of the "Cody Kids" has
brought Brenda nationwide fame
and the realization of all her ambi

tions in the five years since she
started with the team.
In 1940 when she was 15 she was
elected to the No. 1 position on the
mythical Olympic team. But her
greatest thrill, she says, came last
May in Seattle when she tied the
world's record for the 100-yard free

style set by the great Helene Mad
ison. She also holds the Junior Na
tional Title in the freestyle sprint.
But along with the fame and glory
I of a national champion come the
| heartaches and headaches, accord
