# Sophs May Play Mural Football
## 
### 
Intramural football managers will
discuss wartime rule changes at a
meeting with Director Harry Wol
ter tonight in the B.A.C. at 7:15.
Because of the acceleration of
school schedules, managers may
decide at the meeting to allow soph
omores who won frosh football nu
merals to play intramural sports.
Under present laws, either fresh
man numeral winners or Atherton
ized gridders must stay out of mural
play a full year.
A new ruling, if adopted, might
also allow transfer students to en
ter the race even if they have a
varsity letter from their original
school.
This afternoon Delta Kappa Ep
silon and Phi Gamma Delta, two of
the stronger teams of the league,
have their second tests. Bill Joslyn's
Deke outfit meets A.K.L. The
Dekes, picked as a probable win
ner since the start of the season,
topped Chi Psi by three touchdowns
last week.
The Fijis were surprise winners
over Alpha Delta Phi, with Bill
Brokaw and Frank Tibbetts produc
ing a strong passing combine. The
Biz School, their foe tonight, should
not offer much opposition. Their
first appearance, scheduled against
El Tigre last week, was canceled.
Other matchings today include
El Capitan-Chi Psi, Phi Delt-Beta,
El Tigre-Delta Chi, and A.T.0.-
Alpha Delt.
The 12-13 tie between Kappa
Sigma and Delta Tau Delta, Mon
day, will be played off Thursday
at 4:30 p.m. The two teams ended
their first tilt last year, 0-0, but the
Kappa Sigs pulled a 30-point mas
sacre in the playoff. Es
Snedecor was on the receiving end
of the pass which tied the Kappa
Sigs back into the running in the
Monday thriller.
