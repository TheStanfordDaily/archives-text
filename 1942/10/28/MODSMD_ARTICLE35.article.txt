# Marion Falconer In Swim Extravaganza
## 
### 
An acceptance to perform received yesterday from Marion Falconer,
nationally known backstroke swimmer, added yet another star to Coach
Ernie Brandsten's stellar list of performers for his swimming extrava
ganza Friday afternoon.
Miss Falconer joins a galaxy of champions, which includes Sammy

Lee, sensational world champion,
diver; Marge Gestring, Olympic
champion in 1936; Brenda Helser,
co-holder of the world record for
the 100-yard free style (see above
feature story); A1 White, 1924
Olympic Games double winner and
national diving champion for four
years; and Stanford's own Emmett
Cashin, Alan Weeden, and Jim
Gamble.
Coach Brandsten's show for Army
and Navy Relief will be held in the
Encina pools Friday afternoon from
4 to 5:40.
Far Western backstroke cham
pion for two years and named on
the All-American women's swim
team, Miss Falconer swims for the
Crystal Plunge pool in San Fran
cisco. She will give an exhibition
of backstroke swimming.

In addition to the individual
stars, a group of officers from the
St. Mary's Pre-flight School will
give an exhibition of the swimming
training given to Navy airmen.
They will demonstrate the value
of their collapsible rubber raft,
similar to the one used by a trio of
fliers on a 3000-mile ocean trip to
land after their plane ran out of
fuel.
They will show the use of their
life belts—both the regular kapok
jacket and the new chemically self
inflating jacket—and the tricks of
swimming with a full pack on while
carrying a gun, and dodging burn
ing oil.
