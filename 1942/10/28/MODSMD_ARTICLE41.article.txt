# Indians Polish Ground, Air Attack; Banducci Is Captain
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Looking U.C.L.A.'s homb tosser, Holt Waterfield, square in tin* eye.
Coach Marchie Schwartz yesterday sent the Indians through two hours'
worth of running plays, mostly passes, from the Indians' quarterback trio,
Kay Hamniett, Bobby Andrews, and Mark CalTall. Bruno Banducci. first
string right tackle, was named to cuptniu the Redskins next Saturdayl
against the Bruins at Los Angeles.4

Hammett's firing arm was par
ticularly adept as he unfurled a
bevy of passes straight to their re
spective targets. Hammett tried
only one pass against Southern Cali
fornia, and unlimbered for the first
time since the Trojan upset.
FAWCETT RESTS ANKLE
While Buck Fawcett rested a sore
ankle at the hospital, little Ben
Morrison took over the fullback
chores and ran like a Pete Kmeto
vic, cutting in sharply at times and
showing nice speed afoot.
Ross Dana and newcomer Bob
Frisbee worked at left half on the
first team, both exhibiting lots of
drive during the dummy scrimmage.
Dependable Bill Sheller was at
right half along with Dick Munroe,
who was shifted to right half from
fullback last week.
Over in another corner of the
field Husky Hunt formed a "Bruin"
team which will take the plays
brought north from Westwood by
Vic Lindskog and Louis Vincenti
and use them against the varsity
regulars today.
BRUINS DRILL
Down at Los Angeles Coach Babe
HorreU drilled his Bruins behind
locked gates yesterday, first show
ing them pictures of their work
against Santa Clara and then letting
them hear scout Cece Hollings
worth, who said Stanford's line is
"the best in the country."
Hollingsworth is one of the game's
best scouts and that praise coming
from him is quite a feather in the
hat of the Stanford forwards.
To the minds of most persons who
call themselves football "experts"
and even to Sunday morning quar
terbacks, next Saturday's Stanford-
U.C.L.A. tussle looms as the Rose
Bowl decider.
As things stack up now Stanford
must defeat the Bruins to remain in
the running for the anual Pasadena
game. A loss for U.C.L.A. would
move Stanford right up to a tie with
them for second behind Washington
State.
TOUGH SCHEDULES
* Both Bruins and Indians have
tough schedules facing them for
the remainder of the season, while
the Cougars are already over the
hump of the easiest slate any team
on the Coast had this year. Babe
Hollingbery's eleven has beaten

Stanford, Oregon, Montana, and
Oregon State, and has yet to play
Idaho and Washington.
The Cougars don't plaj' either
California or U.C.L.A. Should Stan
ford heat U.C.L.A. and both teams
go through undefeated from there,
then all three, U.C.L.A., Washing
ton State, and Stanford would dead
lock for the P.C.C. championship.
But since that's up to fate and
two football teams who will prove
it one way or the other next Sat
urday, the question is hereby
shelved until the following Mon
day.
For Stanford to go through the
remainder of its schedule unde
feated after the U.C.L.A. encounter
is another Gordian knot in itself.
You untie it.

Head Coach Lon Stiner overhauled
his Oregon State backfield today in
a search for halfbacks to replace
Everett Smith and Bill Mclnnis,
who have not lived up to expecta

Gustafson, still unrecovered from
injuries.

STINER CHANGES BACKS
CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 27 (U.R)—
Head Coach Lon Stiner overhauled
his Oregon State backfield today in
a search for halfbacks to replace
Everett Smith and Bill Mclnnis,
who have not lived up to expecta
tions, according to Stiner, and Lee
Gustafson, still unrecovered from
injuries.
The Palo Alto redwood tree is
Stanford's official emblem.

We "eat" a lot of water. Half of
every loaf of bread, two-thirds of
every egg, and 75 per cent of every
potato and steak is made up of
water.


BRUNO BANDUCCI
Looking U.C.L.A.'s homb tosser, Holt Waterfield, square in tin* eye.
Coach Marchie Schwartz yesterday sent the Indians through two hours'
worth of running plays, mostly passes, from the Indians' quarterback trio,
Kay Hamniett, Bobby Andrews, and Mark CalTall. Bruno Banducci. first
string right tackle, was named to cuptniu the Redskins next Saturdayl
against the Bruins at Los Angeles.4

Hammett's firing arm was par
ticularly adept as he unfurled a
bevy of passes straight to their re
spective targets. Hammett tried
only one pass against Southern Cali
fornia, and unlimbered for the first
time since the Trojan upset.
FAWCETT RESTS ANKLE
While Buck Fawcett rested a sore
ankle at the hospital, little Ben
Morrison took over the fullback
chores and ran like a Pete Kmeto
vic, cutting in sharply at times and
showing nice speed afoot.
Ross Dana and newcomer Bob
Frisbee worked at left half on the
first team, both exhibiting lots of
drive during the dummy scrimmage.
Dependable Bill Sheller was at
right half along with Dick Munroe,
who was shifted to right half from
fullback last week.
Over in another corner of the
field Husky Hunt formed a "Bruin"
team which will take the plays
brought north from Westwood by
Vic Lindskog and Louis Vincenti
and use them against the varsity
regulars today.

HorreU drilled his Bruins behind
locked gates yesterday, first show
ing them pictures of their work
against Santa Clara and then letting
them hear scout Cece Hollings
worth, who said Stanford's line is
"the best in the country."
Hollingsworth is one of the game's
best scouts and that praise coming
from him is quite a feather in the
hat of the Stanford forwards.
To the minds of most persons who
call themselves football "experts"
and even to Sunday morning quar
terbacks, next Saturday's Stanford-
U.C.L.A. tussle looms as the Rose
Bowl decider.
As things stack up now Stanford
must defeat the Bruins to remain in
the running for the anual Pasadena
game. A loss for U.C.L.A. would
move Stanford right up to a tie with
them for second behind Washington
State.
TOUGH SCHEDULES
* Both Bruins and Indians have
tough schedules facing them for
the remainder of the season, while
the Cougars are already over the
hump of the easiest slate any team
on the Coast had this year. Babe
Hollingbery's eleven has beaten

Stanford, Oregon, Montana, and
Oregon State, and has yet to play
Idaho and Washington.
The Cougars don't plaj' either
California or U.C.L.A. Should Stan
ford heat U.C.L.A. and both teams
go through undefeated from there,
then all three, U.C.L.A., Washing
ton State, and Stanford would dead
lock for the P.C.C. championship.
But since that's up to fate and

on the Coast had this year. Babe
Hollingbery's eleven has beaten

Stanford, Oregon, Montana, and
Oregon State, and has yet to play
Idaho and Washington.
The Cougars don't plaj' either
California or U.C.L.A. Should Stan
ford heat U.C.L.A. and both teams
go through undefeated from there,
then all three, U.C.L.A., Washing
ton State, and Stanford would dead
lock for the P.C.C. championship.
But since that's up to fate and
two football teams who will prove
it one way or the other next Sat
urday, the question is hereby
shelved until the following Mon

For Stanford to go through the
remainder of its schedule unde
feated after the U.C.L.A. encounter
is another Gordian knot in itself.
You untie it.

STINER CHANGES BACKS
CORVALLIS, Ore., Oct. 27 (U.R)—
Head Coach Lon Stiner overhauled
his Oregon State backfield today in
a search for halfbacks to replace
Everett Smith and Bill Mclnnis,
who have not lived up to expecta
tions, according to Stiner, and Lee
Gustafson, still unrecovered from
injuries.
The Palo Alto redwood tree is
Stanford's official emblem.

We "eat" a lot of water. Half of
every loaf of bread, two-thirds of
every egg, and 75 per cent of every
potato and steak is made up of
water.


BRUNO BANDUCCI
Looking U.C.L.A.'s homb tosser, Holt Waterfield, square in tin* eye.
Coach Marchie Schwartz yesterday sent the Indians through two hours'
worth of running plays, mostly passes, from the Indians' quarterback trio,
Kay Hamniett, Bobby Andrews, and Mark CalTall. Bruno Banducci. first
string right tackle, was named to cuptniu the Redskins next Saturdayl
against the Bruins at Los Angeles.4

Hammett's firing arm was par
ticularly adept as he unfurled a
bevy of passes straight to their re
spective targets. Hammett tried
only one pass against Southern Cali
fornia, and unlimbered for the first
time since the Trojan upset.
FAWCETT RESTS ANKLE
While Buck Fawcett rested a sore
ankle at the hospital, little Ben
Morrison took over the fullback
chores and ran like a Pete Kmeto
vic, cutting in sharply at times and
showing nice speed afoot.
Ross Dana and newcomer Bob
Frisbee worked at left half on the
first team, both exhibiting lots of
drive during the dummy scrimmage.
Dependable Bill Sheller was at
right half along with Dick Munroe,
who was shifted to right half from
fullback last week.
Over in another corner of the
field Husky Hunt formed a "Bruin"
team which will take the plays
brought north from Westwood by
Vic Lindskog and Louis Vincenti
and use them against the varsity
regulars today.
BRUINS DRILL
Down at Los Angeles Coach Babe
HorreU drilled his Bruins behind
locked gates yesterday, first show
ing them pictures of their work
against Santa Clara and then letting
them hear scout Cece Hollings
worth, who said Stanford's line is
"the best in the country."
Hollingsworth is one of the game's
best scouts and that praise coming
from him is quite a feather in the
hat of the Stanford forwards.
To the minds of most persons who
call themselves football "experts"
and even to Sunday morning quar
terbacks, next Saturday's Stanford-
U.C.L.A. tussle looms as the Rose
Bowl decider.
As things stack up now Stanford
must defeat the Bruins to remain in
the running for the anual Pasadena
game. A loss for U.C.L.A. would
move Stanford right up to a tie with
them for second behind Washington
State.
TOUGH SCHEDULES
* Both Bruins and Indians have
tough schedules facing them for
the remainder of the season, while
the Cougars are already over the
hump of the easiest slate any team
on the Coast had this year. Babe
Hollingbery's eleven has beaten

Stanford, Oregon, Montana, and
Oregon State, and has yet to play
