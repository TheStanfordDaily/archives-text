# To Be Prepared
## 
### 
A RUDE awakening came to one-third of the
men of Stanford yesterday when they dis
covered that they were unfit for service as a
result of the findings of the physical fitness tests
given at the first of the quarter.
Now that the actual condition of many of the
men is known, the School of Health is not
merely making a statement and letting the situ
ation remain untouched; it is actively working
on a program whereby the weaknesses can be
corrected.
The School of Health has a large order on its
hands, for the proper all-around training of Stan
ford men and the development of strong arms
and shoulders is not something which can be
done in one gym course.
The main objection to the entire program is
that it wasn't started soon enough. Those men
who are now seniors and who will be in the
armed forces in a few months did not have to
take the tests. Those who did merely discov
ered their weaknesses and have very little time
to correct them.
The others can start now and build for them
selves strong and healthy bodies so that our
fighting men of the future will be the best in the
world.
There will be many groans and lots of stiff
muscles before Stanford men get into shape, but
we can't let those little things stop us.
Why practice the exercises only in gym
classes; why not work out a home schedule of
exercises learned in the regular classes? This
is another way we at home can help bring vic
tory.
When your War Stamp representative taps
you on the shoulder tonight, give out with at
least twenty-five cents. You won't regret it.
Greetings
THERE are good and bad traditions at Stan
ford; there are dead and living traditions at
Stanford.
Have you ever walked down the Quad and
started to speak to a person you are sure you
have met at least 100 times, only to have your
friendly spirits dampened by a weak, toothy
smile? Have you ever had the same experience
with a professor? Discouraging, isn't it?
Technically, we have a "hello" tradition on
the Farm. We don't believe a formal introduc
tion a prerequisite for a friendly greeting, be it
"hello," "hi," or just "ugh." This doesn't mean
that a student has to keep up a fancy line of
chatter wherever he may go; that would lead to
confusion.
Just remember to say "hello," whether it be
8 a.m. or 10 p.m.
