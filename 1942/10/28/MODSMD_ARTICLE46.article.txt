# On with the Band
## 
### 
T N the past the Stanford Band has been the ob-
J. ject of all sorts of abuse. Now everybody
seems to like the band and the good job that it
is doing.
This year it is a strictly student managed job
with Dick Rabbett as the volunteer bandmaster.
All the tricks are planned by the band itself
and are practiced in spare time. This is quite
a sacrifice since the members of the band, like
everyone else, are carrying 18 units and having
to study.
But even under these conditions the band is
doing a fine job, more members have turned
out than in the past four years, the music and
the spirit are better.
As students, we should know these facts
about our band and cheer when its efforts com
plement a winning football team to make a
Saturday complete. A1 Hampson
