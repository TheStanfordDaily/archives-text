Obviously the only solution is to move dinner up
to 5 or 5:30.
This is the answer to that distressing problem cre
ated by the new late-leave regulations. This problem,
specifically, is how are we going lo accomplish by
10:30 and 1:30 what used to take us until 12 and
2:30?
Now, with dales in the city and Santa Cruz elimi
nated (theoretically), traveling time can be lopped
olf. That adds up to a couple of hours, and with
dinner moved up 30 minutes—there you are left
with as much time to accomplish what you need to
accomplish as you used to have.
If you never had 2:30"5, you'd never miss them.
11 is merely the Stanfordites' reluctance lo give up
anything they've had in the past. When you were
at home, your mother was sorely grieved when you
came in after 2 a.m. All refreshment stands are
closed at 2. Shows close even earlier.
See if the following schedule doesn't satisfy your
idea of a good date:
7:oo—Pick her up, or get picked up, depending
on how you wear your clothes. This is easily an
hour after your 5 o'clock meal.
7:ls—Get there. No matter where you're going,
your car can't afford more than a 15-minute drive.
7:2o—You start doing whatever you intend to do,
see a show, drink, dance, etc. That five-minute lapse
is for buying the tickets, hanging the coals, and
other miscellaneous tasks.
10:20—By this time you've been doing whatever
you've been doing for three hours. You're getting
bored with this.
10:30—You start home. There is another ten
minute period of miscellany. Now, you have an
hour and a half to make a 15-minute trip. If that
isn t enough lime. I'll personally arrange ot get you
a floating over-night.
■» * * *
As a final consideration, think how much easier
it will be to gel up for that 7 o'clock class —don't
forget war savings time is still the vogue. And think
how many more raisins you can pick, or how many
cans of raspberry juice you can pack on the Sunday
after your big date.
Why don't you as a student of Stanford Univer
sity wise up to the fact that in these times the Farm
can't remain static while the rest of the world
changes according to the whimsies of war. Wise up,
I'm going to pretty soon.

2:30?
Now, with dales in the city and Santa Cruz elimi
nated (theoretically), traveling time can be lopped
olf. That adds up to a couple of hours, and with
dinner moved up 30 minutes—there you are left
with as much time to accomplish what you need to
accomplish as you used to have.
If you never had 2:30"5, you'd never miss them.
11 is merely the Stanfordites' reluctance lo give up
anything they've had in the past. When you were
at home, your mother was sorely grieved when you
came in after 2 a.m. All refreshment stands are
closed at 2. Shows close even earlier.
See if the following schedule doesn't satisfy your
idea of a good date:
7:oo—Pick her up, or get picked up, depending
on how you wear your clothes. This is easily an
hour after your 5 o'clock meal.
7:ls—Get there. No matter where you're going,
your car can't afford more than a 15-minute drive.
7:2o—You start doing whatever you intend to do,
see a show, drink, dance, etc. That five-minute lapse
is for buying the tickets, hanging the coals, and
other miscellaneous tasks.
10:20—By this time you've been doing whatever
you've been doing for three hours. You're getting
bored with this.
10:30—You start home. There is another ten
minute period of miscellany. Now, you have an
hour and a half to make a 15-minute trip. If that
isn t enough lime. I'll personally arrange ot get you
a floating over-night.
■» * * *
As a final consideration, think how much easier
it will be to gel up for that 7 o'clock class —don't
forget war savings time is still the vogue. And think
how many more raisins you can pick, or how many
cans of raspberry juice you can pack on the Sunday
after your big date.
Why don't you as a student of Stanford Univer
sity wise up to the fact that in these times the Farm
can't remain static while the rest of the world
changes according to the whimsies of war. Wise up,
I'm going to pretty soon.
Obviously the only solution is to move dinner up
to 5 or 5:30.
This is the answer to that distressing problem cre
ated by the new late-leave regulations. This problem,
specifically, is how are we going lo accomplish by
10:30 and 1:30 what used to take us until 12 and
2:30?
