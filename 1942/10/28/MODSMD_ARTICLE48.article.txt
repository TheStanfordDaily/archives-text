The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the supposedly vulgar idea
that the more you know the more ignorant you be
come is often true.
'I ake the case of some of the professors in our
I niversitv, for example. Here we are in a struggle
for existence, in need of complete unity and support
of our policies, and yet a great many of the pro
fessors use their position to spend their time hiking
cracks at the American system. 1 realize that the
basis of the American system is free speech and
free thought. Nebertheless, in times like this the
general opinion is that unity is more important. It
has been well said that free speech doesn't give one
the right lo shout "Fire" in a crowded theater.
On the way to school this morning I got a ride
from a defense worker. He wanted to know what I
was learning down at Stanford and if it was actual
ly doing much good and helping the war effort. I
said that 1 thought college was doing a great many
things to equip me for the future. After 1 had left
him, though, I started thinking, '"Is college making
me a better American or not?"
In my Political Science classes it is taught that
our present system of government is wasteful and
its inevitable conclusion, considering the manner
in which the facts were presented, is that Socialism
is preferable. Yet, where has a practical Socialistic
government ever existed? They soon depart from
straight Socialism.
In Educational Sociology it is taught that adver
tising is nothing but a fraud, \aluable only for the
satisfaction that it gives the gullible buyer. Yet ad
vertising is likr medicine or law. It depends on how
you use it. After all, it is merely mass communica
tion. Advertising is also the basis <»f free speech and
free thought, for without it the press and radio would
have to be run by the government. Also, adver
tising by introducing new products such as auto
mobiles, frigidaires, and thousands of other com
modities has made us the greatest and best equipped
country in the world with thousands of factories
and millions of skilled workers on whom we are de
pending to win this war of mechanized might.
It seems to me that now is the time to buckle
down and eliminate this theorizing which can never
be evaluated until it is tested, and this is certainly
not the time to lest new theories.
Our system is again showing that it has the flexi
bility to meet any demand upon it. which is win we
j are not only the arsenal of democracy but the hope
of the world.
When I think that it is m\ patriotic duty to go
into the army and fight while these men are sitting
; at home coollv blasting all that I am fighting for. il
I almost seems like a stab in the back

The Editor, Sir:
It seems to me that the supposedly vulgar idea
that the more you know the more ignorant you be
come is often true.
'I ake the case of some of the professors in our
I niversitv, for example. Here we are in a struggle
for existence, in need of complete unity and support
of our policies, and yet a great many of the pro
fessors use their position to spend their time hiking
cracks at the American system. 1 realize that the
basis of the American system is free speech and
free thought. Nebertheless, in times like this the
general opinion is that unity is more important. It
has been well said that free speech doesn't give one
the right lo shout "Fire" in a crowded theater.
On the way to school this morning I got a ride
from a defense worker. He wanted to know what I
was learning down at Stanford and if it was actual
ly doing much good and helping the war effort. I
said that 1 thought college was doing a great many
things to equip me for the future. After 1 had left
him, though, I started thinking, '"Is college making
me a better American or not?"
In my Political Science classes it is taught that
our present system of government is wasteful and
its inevitable conclusion, considering the manner
in which the facts were presented, is that Socialism
is preferable. Yet, where has a practical Socialistic
government ever existed? They soon depart from
straight Socialism.
In Educational Sociology it is taught that adver
tising is nothing but a fraud, \aluable only for the
satisfaction that it gives the gullible buyer. Yet ad
vertising is likr medicine or law. It depends on how
you use it. After all, it is merely mass communica
tion. Advertising is also the basis <»f free speech and
free thought, for without it the press and radio would
have to be run by the government. Also, adver
tising by introducing new products such as auto
mobiles, frigidaires, and thousands of other com
modities has made us the greatest and best equipped
country in the world with thousands of factories
and millions of skilled workers on whom we are de
pending to win this war of mechanized might.
It seems to me that now is the time to buckle
down and eliminate this theorizing which can never
be evaluated until it is tested, and this is certainly
not the time to lest new theories.
Our system is again showing that it has the flexi
bility to meet any demand upon it. which is win we
j are not only the arsenal of democracy but the hope
of the world.
