# Players Will Present "Eve Of St. Mark"
## 
### 
. When the Stanford Players pre
sent "The Eve of St. Mark" next
week, they will be participating in
an experiment which is new to the
theater, for almost simultaneously
with the opening of this drama,
Maxwell Anderson's latest success
on Broadway, 66 university and com
munity groups from coast to coast
will have produced it.
It has been the custom for authors
to release their plays to smaller
groups only after a period of two or
three years has proved successful.
But this is a play of the present.
It is this war's first serious show of
American soldiers in action, and the
problems it deals with are typical
of our youth today.
LIFE REVIEW
As Life magazine says, "Dealing
simply and sincerely with the prob
lems of a youth who goes to war and
is forced to make the decision be
tween living and dying, it is a good
play to show on Main Street."
And Mr. Anderson must have
thought so too, for the GG groups
presenting "The Eve of St. Mark"
during October and November em
brace all sections of the United
States.
PASSION PLUS
Mark Barron, famed New York
drama critic reviewing the play's
opening on Broadway, commented,
"There is tenderness in this new
play, and passion, and a plea to
audiences to understand the things
a man fights for and the impulses
that make him want to be an honor
able soldier."
And F. C. Strictland, director of
dramatics, says the play is written
with the idea to entertain and thrill
—and that it does.—Glasson.
