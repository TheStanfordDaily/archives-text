# Frosh Debater Beats Coach In Fiery Inhibit of Oratory
## 
### ED CONN 
The heart-rending desire of every
student from Oregon to Maine to
defeat his own professor in an argu
ment finally came true —Frank
Church, freshman, defeated his
coach, Jim Kessler, last night in the
All-University debate held in the
Educational Auditorium.
Taking the negative side of the
question, Resolved, that the Federal
Government should conscript capi
tal and labor for the duration, j
Church not only proved that the |
present system of meeting ihe in- j
flation problem is being satisfac- j
torily carried out, but also that the j
Manpower Commission's program is
adequately meeting today's labor
shortage.
Church not only upheld the pres
ent plan administered by the United
States Government, but he met
squarely every argument offered by
Kessler.
MORE ARGUMENT
Kessler claimed that at the pres
ent time there is a $9,000,000 surplus
which is leading us to inflation, and
that compulsory savings would be
the only solution. Church coun
tered that the price and wage regu-

| lation, production regulation, and
j the present tax system is attempting
to meet the problem; if this plan is
insufficient, the tax can always be
increased without necessitating con
scription.
Previous to the actual debate, dele
gations of students from Dr. Lee
Chapin's speech classes proposed
rider amendments to be added to
the question which the debaters
were to discuss. These riders were
voted on by an international panel
I of six students. On the basis of their
j decision, the riders were placed be
! fore Church and Kessler.
AMENDMENT PASSES
Of the amendments, one, Resolved,
that all workers be required to take
i an aptitude test to determine their
abilities, was accepted by the inter
national panel. Both debaters agreed
that this was necessary whether con
scription took place or not.
The other amendments proposed:
That all University students be ex
empt from the conscription, that
Stanford women should work a min
imum of two hours a week in some
war project, andthat state socialism
war project, and that state socialism
I iected by the panel.

imum of two hours a week in some
war project, andthat state socialism
war project, and that state socialism
I iected by the panel.
The heart-rending desire of every
student from Oregon to Maine to
defeat his own professor in an argu
ment finally came true —Frank
Church, freshman, defeated his
coach, Jim Kessler, last night in the
All-University debate held in the
Educational Auditorium.
Taking the negative side of the
question, Resolved, that the Federal
Government should conscript capi
tal and labor for the duration, j
Church not only proved that the |
present system of meeting ihe in- j
flation problem is being satisfac- j
torily carried out, but also that the j
Manpower Commission's program is
adequately meeting today's labor
shortage.
Church not only upheld the pres
ent plan administered by the United
States Government, but he met
squarely every argument offered by
Kessler.
MORE ARGUMENT
Kessler claimed that at the pres
ent time there is a $9,000,000 surplus
which is leading us to inflation, and
that compulsory savings would be
the only solution. Church coun
tered that the price and wage regu-

| lation, production regulation, and
j the present tax system is attempting
to meet the problem; if this plan is
insufficient, the tax can always be
increased without necessitating con
scription.
Previous to the actual debate, dele
gations of students from Dr. Lee
Chapin's speech classes proposed
rider amendments to be added to
the question which the debaters
were to discuss. These riders were
voted on by an international panel
I of six students. On the basis of their
j decision, the riders were placed be
! fore Church and Kessler.
AMENDMENT PASSES
Of the amendments, one, Resolved,
that all workers be required to take
i an aptitude test to determine their
abilities, was accepted by the inter
national panel. Both debaters agreed
that this was necessary whether con
scription took place or not.
The other amendments proposed:
That all University students be ex
empt from the conscription, that
Stanford women should work a min
imum of two hours a week in some
war project, andthat state socialism
war project, and that state socialism
