# Solomons Crisis Looms As U.S. Troops Hold Off Reinforced Jap Forces
## American Forces Outnumbered on Land, Sea and Air 
### 
PEARL HARBOR, Oct. 28 (U.R)â€”
The battle of the Solomon Islands
probably is ncaring a crisis, but our
out-numbered and under-supplied
Marine Corps and Army units ap
pear still to be holding Henderson
Field and a small area around it on
Guadalcanal Island, authoritative in
formants said today.
The informants described strong
Japanese forces attacking our posi
tions on Guadalcanal and elsewhere
as well trained, determined, wcll
supplied with excellent equipment,
and apparently in position to re
ceive large reinforcements.
They said the Japanese had naval
superiority and were believed to be
using the bulk of their sea forces not
needed for guarding their home
waters.
Japanese land forces attacking
our positions on Guadalcanal Island
were estimated at between 15,000 and
20,000, including about 10,000 men
landed on Oct. 15. This number was
said to be considerably larger than
the total number of defending U.S.
Marines and Army units.
The Japanese also were said to
have more planes in action than our
forces and to be in position to re
inforce their aerial strength as de
sired from their bases at Rabaul and
Buka, which, in turn, are reinforced
from Nippon's big base on Truk Is
land, in the Carolines.
American forces, it was said, now
must depend largely on air power
available in the immediate area of
the fighting.
