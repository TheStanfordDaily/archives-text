# New Version of Victory Bike To Aid Strap Metal Shortage
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Stanford's Dave Baer has his own version of a Victory bike. One day
last summer he took a few yards of oak timber, a hinge and a pipe tlange
into his garage workshop and in three days came out—pedaling his wooden
Victory hike.
In normal times a wooden frame would be a mere curio, hut in times

when steel frames are on priority, +
Baer's ingenuity has significance.
This Victory bike is simply con- j
structed and, with the exception of |
the wheels and procket, is w.ooden. j
It weighs less than a standard model j
and consequently rides easier. Mate
: rials cost $10, minus the wheels.
ORIGINAL PURPOSE
Baer's original purpose was mainly
! experimental; he wanted to see if a
home-made bike was possible. But
with the success and simplicity of
the invention, possibilities loom for
Baer's wooden bike.
"Next month's gas rationing will !
bring the problem of transportation I
j home to all of us at Stanford," Baer
' emphasized, "and with new bikes
{ off the market, a solution may lie in
I home-made bikes."
Baer added that steel frames could
be thrown on Victory scrap piles and
could be replaced by wooden ones.
ARTIFICIAL TIRE
Necessity was the mother of an
i other Baer invention. His brother's
j bicycle tire was worn through and
a new one was unobtainable. It
i looked as if that was the end of the
| bike for the duration, until Baer [
I came across a box of old wine corks. [
He slit the old tire and filled it with
50 corks. Taping up the tire, he tried ;
it out and found the corks elastic [
enough to serve the purpose. Baer
I estimates that the improvised tire
: will be good for at least 300 miles.
He also believes the same principle
might be utilized in reservicing auto
mobile tires.
Dave Baer is a senior Industrial
Engineering student. He will be in- 1
ducted into Army Ordnance next 1
spring and hopes to be transferred j
! into Aeronautical Engineering.

"Next month's gas rationing will !
bring the problem of transportation I
j home to all of us at Stanford," Baer
' emphasized, "and with new bikes
{ off the market, a solution may lie in
I home-made bikes."
Baer added that steel frames could
be thrown on Victory scrap piles and
could be replaced by wooden ones.
ARTIFICIAL TIRE
Necessity was the mother of an
i other Baer invention. His brother's
j bicycle tire was worn through and
a new one was unobtainable. It
i looked as if that was the end of the
| bike for the duration, until Baer [
I came across a box of old wine corks. [
He slit the old tire and filled it with
50 corks. Taping up the tire, he tried ;
it out and found the corks elastic [
enough to serve the purpose. Baer
I estimates that the improvised tire
: will be good for at least 300 miles.
He also believes the same principle
might be utilized in reservicing auto
mobile tires.
Dave Baer is a senior Industrial
Engineering student. He will be in- 1
ducted into Army Ordnance next 1
spring and hopes to be transferred j
! into Aeronautical Engineering.
Stanford's Dave Baer has his own version of a Victory bike. One day
last summer he took a few yards of oak timber, a hinge and a pipe tlange
into his garage workshop and in three days came out—pedaling his wooden
Victory hike.
In normal times a wooden frame would be a mere curio, hut in times

when steel frames are on priority, +
Baer's ingenuity has significance.
This Victory bike is simply con- j
structed and, with the exception of |
the wheels and procket, is w.ooden. j
It weighs less than a standard model j
and consequently rides easier. Mate
: rials cost $10, minus the wheels.
ORIGINAL PURPOSE
Baer's original purpose was mainly
! experimental; he wanted to see if a
home-made bike was possible. But
with the success and simplicity of
the invention, possibilities loom for
Baer's wooden bike.
