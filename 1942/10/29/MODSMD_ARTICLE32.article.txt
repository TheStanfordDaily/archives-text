# St. Mark' Set Crew Solves Scene Problems
## 
### 
In ordinary times with ;>n ordinary play, the construction crew working
on "The Eve of St. Mark," first production of the Stanford Players, opening
next Wednesday, would run into considerable difficulties, for although the
drama is written in two acts, it involves 12 scene changes.
The play is so constructed that each act plays without interruption and
there must be a rapid movement in +

scene changes.
ROLLING PLATFORMS
The technical directors have solved
this problem by constructing an in
genuous seres of rolling platforms
on which the properties for each
scene are set up. Then the whole
affair is simply rolled onto the stage
as it is needed.
This system requires no elaborate
sets meaning lengthy waits while
scenery changes are made. And
materials for such sets have become
scarce and even impossible to ob
tain.
The properties for each scene
have been chosen with the idea of
suggesting rather than depicting, for
Maxwell Anderson has used the
Shakespearian technique of writing
time, place, and atmosphere into his
dialogue.
LITTLE SCENERY
Since the rolling platform system
requires little use of regular scenery,
and the acting is done against a
drapery backdrop, the illusions are
carried out by the properties and
players alone.
"We have done an extensive prop
erty job for the 12 scenes," said Paul
Hosteller, working on the construc
tion angle, "and the small suggestive
props create an adequate atmos
phere."
The use of drapes and lights prom
ises to be effective. Space-void
lighting will play an important role
in heightening the eerie, supernat
ural quality of the ghost scenes.
