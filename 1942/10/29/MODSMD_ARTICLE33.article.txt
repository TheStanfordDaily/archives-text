### 
NEW YORK. Oct. 27 (U.R)â€”The
Associated Press filed its answer to
the government's anti-trust suit to
day, denying that it is a monopoly
and asserting that a government
victory in the suit would abridge
the freedom of the press.
The answer also declared that the
failure of Marshall Field's Chicago
: Sun to be elected to the Associated
Press was "largely, if not entirely
; due to the three obstacles" erected
by Field himself and by representa
| tives of the anti-trust division of
' the Department of Justice.
The 7.000-word answer, filed in
the federal court for the Southern
' District of New York, declared the
A.P. had never attempted to be a
: monopoly and that "the sources of
i news are as freely open to anyone or
I everyone who may desire access 1o
them as they are to the A.P."
