### 
Pouring in five goals in the sec
ond half, Stanford's varsity soccer
squad overwhelmed a game but
outclassed Menlo J.C. team yester
day afternoon, 6-1.
John Gertridge led all scoring
with three goals in the final period.
Henry Sidwell playing his first var
sity game counted two scores to
establish himself as another future
offensive threat.
Louis Chang booted in Stanford's
first goal and it proved to be the
only score of the first half.
But in the final period Sidwell
booted one right between the Menlo
goalie's legs. Gertridge scored from
in close, and then counted another
on a penalty kick. The final score
came a few minutes before the final
whistle when Dave Bills booted one
right to the goal stripe and Gert
ridge tipped it in.
