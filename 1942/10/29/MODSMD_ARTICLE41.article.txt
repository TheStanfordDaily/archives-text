### BOB SONTAG 
/JETTING TIIE EARLY BIRD AGAIN:
Taking a hint from mister 14 to 13, brother of mister 5 by 5. following j
are Saturday's football picks, as annotated from our can't miss grid labora
tory in the corner of Stanford's practice field:
STANFORD OVER U.C.L.A. BY 1
Last week 'by 1" was great for S.C.-Stanford, except that Chuck Taylor
spoiled it by making the final score 14-6 instead of 7-6. Anyway, Saturday's
game at Los Angeles should be the closest contest of any this season.
It will take all Stanford's pass defense and then some to halt the lethal
tosses of Bob Waterfield. On the ground the Redskins' line should be able
to get in the way of anything Ken Snelling and A1 Solari have to offer,-
while Stanford's own backs, with the addition of Bob Frisbee, should
score one or two themselves. If Stanford can stop Waterfield's great
throwing arm, it can stop the Bruins. It's definitely a one-sided offense
that will give the Bruins their scoring threat, and Stanford must touch off
those bombs before they hit home.
CALIFORNIA OVER OREGON BY 13
Jim Jurkovich is back on the Bear roster and playing in the style he was J
built up to play. Oregon is fresh from a rout victory over Idaho, but still
can't match the Bears. Rather than give Sarge Allison a top-heavy score, |
two touchdowns will be enough for the man who likes "fundamentals" so 1
much.
IDAHO OVER MONTANA BY 12
Idaho scored against Stanford, and that's good enough to rale them over
the Grizzlies. Pitcher Howard Manson of the Vandals will be there to help j
pass out aerial bouquets.
WASHINGTON OVER O.S.C. BY 7
Clearly victim of what is called an "upset" last week, Washington gets
the nod over O.S.C. Sammy Robinson and Neil Brooks of the Huskies,
along with Walt Harrison at center to hold back the Beavers, should bring
Washington another conference victory. O.S.C. was pummeled around by
Washington State last week and will be gunning, but so will their op
ponents â€”we'll take Washington.
NAVY PRE-FLIGHT AVER W.S.C. BY MILLIONS
Oops, we forgot, that one was called off. Our mistake.
(Last week we batted two for five and one called off . . . stance changed
for Saturday.)
