### 
'In preparation for their southern
1 rip to phiy the San Diego Naval
Training Station, the Stanford frosh
ran through pass offense and de
fense drills yesterday afternoon.
Coach Francis Wilcox has al
ready named 22 men to make the
trip, and hopes to he able to add
three more players to the list, which
is now before the Board of Athletic
Control for official confirmation.
Line coach Arnie Meiners spent
the afternoon sending the line
through its blocking assignments on
offensive plays and defensive for
mations.
Tuesday Wilcox had his reserves

playing the single wing formation
with the regulars on defense. It is
believed that the Navy team will
use the single wing formation. The
frosh have already met this type
of offense when they played the St.
Mary's Pre-flight B team here Oct.
17, losing 13-6, on two quick first
quarter passes.
