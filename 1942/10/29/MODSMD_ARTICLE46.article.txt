U.C.L.A. REPORT
Down in Bruin land, Coach Babe
Horrell got some ominous advice
from Scout Cece Hollingsworth who
watched the Cards humble S.C. at
Kezar. Said Hollingsworth in efi'ect,
"You can't go through the Injun
line, so you'd better go over it or
around it."
So Bob Waterfield was wai'ming
up his pitching arm last night for
a passing attack which must be con
sidered inevitable.
He, and replacement Ev Riddle,
were hitting with deadly accuracy,
the pair forming perhaps the strong
est passing threat that Stanford has
faced all season excepting Bertelli
of Notre Dame.
