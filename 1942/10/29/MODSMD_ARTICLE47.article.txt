# Water Polo Team To Face Clubmen
## 
### 
Hard hit by the loss of several
key men, Stanford's varsity water
polo team will face the powerful
San Francisco Olympic Club in one
of its toughest games of the year
Saturday afternoon in the Encina
pools.
Coach Ernie Brandsten's forward
wall is in a very shaky condition
at present with Emmett Cashin,
first string sprint, definitely out
and possibly Don Smith. Bill Mapel,
and Hadley Bacon. The starting
line-up has been composed of
Cashin, Mapel, and Bacon.
Cashin must be best man at his
sister's wedding so he will be lost
for the game, while Smith broke
his rib recently and may or may
not be allowed to play. Bacon was
in good shape until he twisted his
back in an intramural football
game. He has been taking heat
treatments and may be okeh.
