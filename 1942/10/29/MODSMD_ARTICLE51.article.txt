# 'World's Finest Diver' To Star In Swim Show
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
'"In my opinion, Sammy Lee is the greatest diver in the world today,"
said Ernie Brandstcn, Stanford swimming coach, and Brandstcn has seen
the finest divers of the world in his 25 years of coaching.
"Lee is the only diver in the world who has done a 3 1 :* forward somer- I
sanlt from the 112-foot platform, and one of the three in the world able to

I do it from the 10-f'oot springboard,"
j continued Brandsten, coach of four
| Olympic Games champion diving
teams.
"It may look easy, but it takes
guts to somersault from a 32-foot
platform into the water," he added.
| "A diver can open just a little bit
wrong and kill himself."
LEE'S PROGRAM
The 19-year-old Korean boy, who
will appear tomorrow afternoon in
Coach Brandsten's Army and Navy
relief swim show, is so good, he is
almost unbelievable. For the benefit
of tomorrow's spectators, Lee will
not only do his 3 x /2, but many other
spectacular dives in the 30 minutes
allotted him on Brandsten's star
studded program.
He will do his amazing backward
| spring. Facing the platform, Lee
does a back jack-knife coupled with
I a 21/2 forward somersault. You won't
j believe it until you see it.

Lee can do the 2V2, difficult for j
most top divers, from the 3 and 10- I
foot springboards as well as the 32- ;
foot platform. But to make it tough j
for himself, he does it in two sec- J
tions, starting out his first spin in
the pike (open) position ond ending |
in a tuck (closed) position before
entering the water.
HALF GAINER
He will do his spectacular half 1
gainer and half twist with a forward
somersault, a* dive in three sections i
requiring tremendous skill and con- !
; trol. "One of his most striking '
! dives," says Brandsten.
Born a native of California of j
Korean parents, Lee was first dis
i covered in a high school near Po
mona by Jim Ryan, former diving
I star. Ryan, now a wealthy Los An
j geles businessman, saw great possi
bilities in Lee's amazing agility and 1
j cat-like balance.

Under Ryan's tutelage, Lee im- j
proved rapidly and at 15 was con- j
tender for national honors. Brilliant
but inconsistent, Lee was runner-up |
for the national title for three years I
before he scored his grand slam this
year.
WINS TITLES
Lee won everything he entered j
this year—both springboard titles j
at the National Collegiates at New
Haven, both springboard honors at j
the American A.A.U. indoor meet, I
and three wins in the A.A.U. out- |
door meet—and is still improving. [

! dives," says Brandsten.
Born a native of California of j
Korean parents, Lee was first dis
i covered in a high school near Po
mona by Jim Ryan, former diving
I star. Ryan, now a wealthy Los An
j geles businessman, saw great possi
bilities in Lee's amazing agility and 1
j cat-like balance.

Under Ryan's tutelage, Lee im- j
proved rapidly and at 15 was con- j
tender for national honors. Brilliant
but inconsistent, Lee was runner-up |
for the national title for three years I
before he scored his grand slam this
year.
WINS TITLES
Lee won everything he entered j
this year—both springboard titles j
at the National Collegiates at New
Haven, both springboard honors at j
the American A.A.U. indoor meet, I
and three wins in the A.A.U. out- |
door meet—and is still improving. [
'"In my opinion, Sammy Lee is the greatest diver in the world today,"
said Ernie Brandstcn, Stanford swimming coach, and Brandstcn has seen
the finest divers of the world in his 25 years of coaching.
"Lee is the only diver in the world who has done a 3 1 :* forward somer- I
sanlt from the 112-foot platform, and one of the three in the world able to

I do it from the 10-f'oot springboard,"
j continued Brandsten, coach of four
| Olympic Games champion diving
teams.
"It may look easy, but it takes
guts to somersault from a 32-foot
platform into the water," he added.
| "A diver can open just a little bit
wrong and kill himself."
LEE'S PROGRAM
The 19-year-old Korean boy, who
will appear tomorrow afternoon in
Coach Brandsten's Army and Navy
relief swim show, is so good, he is
almost unbelievable. For the benefit
of tomorrow's spectators, Lee will
not only do his 3 x /2, but many other
spectacular dives in the 30 minutes
allotted him on Brandsten's star
studded program.
He will do his amazing backward
| spring. Facing the platform, Lee
does a back jack-knife coupled with
I a 21/2 forward somersault. You won't
j believe it until you see it.

Lee can do the 2V2, difficult for j
most top divers, from the 3 and 10- I
foot springboards as well as the 32- ;
foot platform. But to make it tough j
for himself, he does it in two sec- J
tions, starting out his first spin in
the pike (open) position ond ending |
in a tuck (closed) position before
entering the water.
HALF GAINER
He will do his spectacular half 1
gainer and half twist with a forward
somersault, a* dive in three sections i
requiring tremendous skill and con- !
; trol. "One of his most striking '
! dives," says Brandsten.
