# Changes Made In Mural Rules
## 
### 
One important change in intra-
I mural eligibility rules was made last
night in a meeting of intramural
managers.
It was decided that freshmen who
( have made their numerals in any
j frosh sport will be eligible for com
petition in mural activities upon be
coming sophomores. This new rul
ing will go into effect at the begin
ning of next quarter. Transfers
from another university, college, or
junior college, who made a letter
while attending it, will not be elig
ible to play.
Transfers, however, who are non
j lettermen are eligible to compete
upon enrolling at Stanford. The rule
I that block S winners are barred
I from competition in that sport in
j which they made their letter was
I not changed.
Harry Wolter. director of intra
mural activities, announced that of
the 28 club entries in golf, only one
match has been played while seven
I other teams drew byes into the sec
; ond round. He also emphasized that
! teams not playing their matches by
j the start of the second round, Nov.
| 27, would be dropped from the tour
j nament by default.
