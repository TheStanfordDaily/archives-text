# The 						Cardinal Isn't Waving
## 
### 
ONLY an efficient, wide-awake student ad
ministration could have done what was
done at last Tuesday's Excom meeting. After
years of struggle and worry, a committee was
appointed to look into a possible reorganization
of Cardinals in regard to additional efficiency.
This is only a step toward a problem which
needs a lot of wrinkles ironed out of it. Cardi
nals is an organization which carries a great
deal of prestige. Prestige can be a stimulant to
ward better service to the students or it can be
abused and used as an excuse for doing very
little work.
The reorganization committee is not particu
larly interested in this year's Cardinals; it is
interested in Cardinals as a name and as an
organization which has not been functioning
properly. This conclusion is based upon past
and present observations and is not meant as
a direct slam to the present members. The point
isâ€”we had to start sometime.
According to the A.S.S.U. Constitution, Car
dinals is composed of 10 members plus the two
Rally Committee chairmen, the A.S.S.U. presi
dent, and the head yell leader. The 10 regular
members of the organization are not ordinary
students; they have all distinguished them
selves for service rendered to the school. Ob
viously, the other four are probably the busiest
persons in the school.
Referring to the Constitution again, Cardinals'
duties are:
1. The president shall appoint a committee to
meet and welcome visiting celebrities, speak
ers, athletic teams, coaches, etc.
2. The appointment of chairmen to handle
A.S.S.U.-sponsored dances is well taken care of
at the present.
3. The president shall appoint a Cardinal to
handle all high school programs coming under
the jurisdiction of Cardinals, and to represent
the organization of the Student-Faculty Review
Board.
4. The president shall appoint a Cardinal to
handle the annual Red Cross Drive. This is
done.
5. Cardinals shall appoint a general chairman
for the annual Convalescent Home Drive. This
is always done, and done well.
6. At the recommendation of Executive Com
mittee and of the A.S.S.U. president, Cardinals
shall undertake to promote any campus activity
in need of assistance. Members shall aid the
president of Cardinals in promoting campus
welfare, and will head emergency committees
formed for this purpose.
That, in slightly condensed form, is Cardinals'
program. Some of the points are being taken
care of; others are being neglected. To be an
entirely efficient organization deserving of a
good name on campus, a group should fulfill
all of its duties well.
Point 6 is the most neglected. To cite an ex
ample of something which almost went wrong
this week, Cardinals was appointed by Excom !
to handle the Nitery facilities to see that all was
kept in order. Somehow signals were crossed,
and the coke machine ran out and the juke box
broke down the same evening. After scurrying
around and asking a lot of questions, one of the
more efficient members of the student govern- 1
ment system discovered the leasons for the
confusion and solved the problem.

It shouldn't have been the job of the Student
Manager to look up Cardinals; a Cardinals mem
ber should have been there on the spot to rem
edy the situation immediately. That isn't un
reasonable because Cardinals asked to take
over the Nitery.
What we wish to point out is that Cardinals
should be an efficient, dependable organization
working for the students and not a resting place
for campus "big shots." We don't object to the
"big shots" belonging to Cardinals, but we do
object when they are the only members and
can't possibly find the time to do the work
which is expected of them.
