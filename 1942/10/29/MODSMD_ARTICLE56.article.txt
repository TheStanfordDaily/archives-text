NOV. 3 ELECTION
Nov. 3 is ilie regular biennial general election.
War news has toned down the usual How of political
lava, boiling inud covering the shining peak of
democracy, but an election there is, and tlie exist
ence of the war and the increased powers conferred
on government by a war situation, make it reason
ably important to give some consideration to the
affair, in the intervals left us between buying stamps,
donating blood, working for the Sl*, etc. For an
intelligent vote is just as important a contribution
to the war effort as any of the above activities.
Ihe most attention is naturally focused on the
race for Governor, in which Culbert L. Olson, in
cumbent, Democrat, defends his title against Karl
Warren, at present Attorney-General, Republican.
Warren charges Olson and his administration with
playing politics with stale relief and slate institu
tions, and more politics with slate defense measures,
with incidental accusations of corruption and ex
travagance. He is supported in his attacks by a
number of Democrats throughout Ihe stale as well
as Republicans, and has announced a non-partisan
campaign and administration. Olson has strongly de
nied Warren's charges and made counter-charges of
his own. but ihe latest odds are 2ViÂ» to 1 for Warren.
Around the campus lately, copies of ihe '"Con
gress for Victory" pamphlet have been placed. As
ffir as ill is district, the Eighth, goes, this is too late
to have any effect. Jack Anderson, incumbent,
cleaned up his opposition at the primary and is un
opposed. For slate Attorney-General, second most
important stale office, Robert W. Kenny, Democrat,
opposes Wallace L. Ware, Republican.
California is a slate afflicted with direct legisla
tion, ihe initiative and the referendum. There are
18 propositions on the ballot for Nov. 3. No. 1, pro
hibiting '"hot cargo" and ihe secondary boycott in
labor disputes during the war, is violently attacked
by organized labor as the "Slave Bill." and defended
as a necessary measure for war efficiency by I hose
less immediately interested. No. 3 requires that
all practitioners in the "healing art" pass an exami
nation in basic sciences. The organized medical
profession is for it; others, chiropractors, osteo
paths, etc., against.
No. 4 abolishes ihe personal income lax. There is
considerable controversy over this, but those who
pay the state income tax seem firm in their reso
lution not to do so any longer. No. 2 provides for
annual sessions of the legislature and annual budgets
I both are now biennial), and No. 16 regulates court
review of administrative decisions.
There is one other item. For sheriff of Santa
Clara County, Win. J. Emig opposes Lloyd Skeels.
Both are supported by powerful local groups, and
little can be expected from eilher.
