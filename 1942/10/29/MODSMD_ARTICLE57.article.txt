The Editor, Sir:
In answer to those who want some tangible con
crete suggestions for a "Stanford War Program,"
I have carefully gleaned the campus for the follow
ing points, which will be unanimously accepted by
certain quarters:
1. Eliminate the noon rush in the Cellar by clos
ing the Cellar doors between the hours of 11:30 and
12:30.
2. Comply with the dim-out regulations in the
Library reading room by turning off all the lights
after dark. Under no circumstances use drawn
shades. Later on in the quarter, if the need is sulli
ciently great, there should be some arrangements
for distributing reserve books in Braille.
3. Women's social regulations should be re
stricted to an after dinner curfew, but allow one
o o'clock for Daily night editors.
4. Permanently abolish llie "Hello"' tradition
for the duration, because in times of war one should
be particularly careful'of whom he talks to.
An Admirer
llie Editor, Sir:
All that has been heard for llie past few weeks is
llie war effort. 1 believe that keeping lit physically
has been one of the prime concerns. Aren't the eyes
of the students important?
In other words, can't something be done about
the lights in the library at night? If we continue
studying in the library with the lights the way they
are now, we will all be sure of coming out with very
weak eyes. The lights were bad enough before, but
now .
Why couldn't we have curtains on the windows
instead of those awful papers wrapped around the
lights?
