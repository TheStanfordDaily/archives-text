# Beauty of "Oedipus Rex" Revealed in Farm Staging
## 
### 
"Oedipus the King." classic Greek tragedy, has survived through the cen
turies with all its beauty of structure and expert dramatic touches.
One by one the events are revealed that reveal Oedipus, King of Thebes,
as murderer of his father and husband of his mother, which is complicated
enough, even for the Greeks.

Sophocles' masterpiece was read ♦
with considerable understanding at i
Memorial Theater, Wednesday eve- j
ning. A. Grove Day, as Oedipus, j
made an easily appreciated hero. He !
gave fine emotion and voice to the '
difficult role.
To simulate for modern audiences j
the play as presented in its original
form is, of course, impossible. |
Three hundred years B.C. would be
a stretch of the imagination even
for Hollywood.
The thought and beauty of the
expression, however, convey the
dignity of the Greek theater where
the actors literally masked their
emotions to portray the starkness of
these legendary plots. A notable
feature preserved is the chorus
chanting an endless background of
lyric to heighten suspense and build
mystery in the consciousness of the j
audience.
Pat Peteler as Jocasta, Allan
Armer as Creon, and Paul Hostetler
as Stranger abetted Day admirably
in unveiling the cruel fate of Oedi
pus, King.—Giannini.
