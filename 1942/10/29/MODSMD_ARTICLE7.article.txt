# Dancers Try For Gaieties Parts Today
## 
### 
Only chance to try out for dancing
parts in the Big Game Gaieties will
be held this afternoon between 4
and 6 in the Ram's Head Room, lo
cated in the basement of Memorial
Auditorium, announces Jacques
Poley Ogg, dancing director.
All those who have already signed
up to be in any dance numbers, as
well as others who are interested,
should appear at the tryouts, she
said. The tryouts are open to every
one, but those who have expressed
their desire to take dancing parts
must appear for consideration.
THINGS LOOK GOOD
Things really look good along the
music line, according to Musical Di
rector Dick Rabbett, but the drum
mer spot in the all-student orches
tra is still open. Copyists are also
needed; applicants for the positions
should contact Rabbett at Palo Alto
22492.
"The string section is exceptional,''
Rabbett commented enthusiastically,
"and we're fortunate to have Harry
Strick, one of the best amateur vio
linists on the Coast, in the spot of
concert master. Another excellent
musician in the orchestra is Rosa
mund Fuller, flutist."
CASTING COMPLETE
Casting of the acting parts for the
Gaieties is complete, and roles were
distributed at a cast assembly last
night. Many freshmen and transfers
were chosen, bringing to light new
talent. Members of the cast will be
announced in tomorrow's Daily.
There is still an opportunity to
work backstage on technical jobs,
and interested persons should con
tact Hal Levitt or Paul Hostetler.
