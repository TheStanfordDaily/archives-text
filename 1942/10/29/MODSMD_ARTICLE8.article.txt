# Nitery Activities Need Student Aid
## 
### 
Cardinals' new campus meeting
place, the Nitery, will be open every
night of the week except Sundays,
announces Vernice Hines, Cardinal
head.
Monday through Thursday the
hours will be from 8 to 10:30, but at
this time no dancing will be per
mitted. Students may listen to the
records and drink coke. On Friday
and Saturday nights the hours are
from 8 to 12 and dancing will be
allowed.
In order to keep the Nitery activi
ties going, Cardinal asks students to
be especially careful about cigar
ette burns and slugs in both the
"juke" box and coke machine. They
also request that all bottles be re
turned to the machine.
