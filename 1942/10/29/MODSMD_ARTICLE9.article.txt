"Is Germany Exhausting Her Man
Power?" has been acclaimed by the
National Board of Librarians as one
of the 10 best articles appearing in

far better situation as regards man
power than she was at a similar
period in World War I.
The article asserted also that the
food situation in Germany probably
is slightly bettor than it is in Eng
land now.
