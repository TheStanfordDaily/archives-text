This Reversible Jacket
comes in mighty handy
around the campus
... because you can wear it
both sides
It's really two jackets in one. One side is
a wind-repellent, water-resistant cotton
poplin. The other is a good-looking sub
dued plaid. It's the kind of jackct that's
perfect for campus wear —and just about
anything you can think of, includ- $£95
ing just plain loafing. "
