# Japs Beaten Off Again In Solomons
## Soldiers, Marines Thrust Bark Three Guadalcanal Attacks 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (U.R) —
Japanese forces broke through
American lines on Guadalcanal for
the second time in two days Tues
day, hut counter-attacking Marines
and Army troops drove them back
and also repulsed two subsequent
enemy thrusts, the Navy announced
today.
As the Japs continued their re
lentless drive to capture Henderson
Air Field, key to the American de
fenders, U.S. planes took off from
the precious little strip of jungle
clearing and pounded Jap gun posi
tions to the westward of Henderson
Field and also winged their way to
Rekata Bay—nearly 200 miles to the
north—where they hammered shore
installations and destroyed four sea
planes on the water.
The communique added that "no
report of any recent action at sea or
landing of enemy troop reinforce
ments (on Guadalcanal) has been
received."
NOT A LULL
This did not necessarily mean a
lull had developed in the sea battle
which raged furiously in the Guad
alcanal area Sunday and then shift
ed 400 miles to the eastward in the
general direction of American sup
ply lines to the Solomons and Aus
tralia.
Latest developments in the savage
battle for control of Guadalcanal
were revealed a few hours after the
Army high command here shoul
dered a share of the responsibility
for the decision which launched the
American offensive in the Solomons
Aug. 7.
RECORD STRAIGHT
Setting the record straight, Secre
tary of War Henry L. Stimson said
the decision was made by the joint
Army and Navy chiefs of staff in ac
cordance with an agreed-upon plan
"and was not purely a naval de
cision."
The statement—in response to a
press conference query whether the
campaign was purely a Navy ven
ture—appeared designed to silence
rumors there is friction or contro
versy over command in the battle
area. Stimson said last week there
is closest cooperation between the
Army and Navy.
The Japs succeeded in piercing
the American lines Tuesday after
noon. But the defenders, though
weary from constant fighting, coun
ter-attacked. hurled the enemy back
and regained their original positions.
