# Military Trial Right Upheld by Justice
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 29 (U.R)â€”
President Roosevelt's right to order
military trials for enemy invaders,
even when they are American citi
zens, was upheld by the Supreme
Court today in a formal opinion on
the historic German saboteur case.
The decision, written by Chief
Justice Harlan Fiske Stone, sup
planted an informal ruling in which
the court on July 31 rejected the
habeas corpus pleas of the eight Nazi
agents who landed on American soil
from German submarines.
