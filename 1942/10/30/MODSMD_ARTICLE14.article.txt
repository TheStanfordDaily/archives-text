### CYCLONE COVEY 
J a.sch a Heifetz played in Memorial
Hall last night, opening the 1942-43
Stanford Concert Series.
Were I conventional, I would go
on to say what critics have been
saying of Heifetz since he made his
debut in Russia at the age of five—
that his technique is incredible, his
tones brilliant, his double stops ac
curate, his harmonics clear, his bow
ing nervelessly controlled, his shifts
sure, etc.
But all these things would be re
dundant; for they have long since
become synonymous with the simple
statement, "Heifetz played."
Why go on, and say that he played
with a positive dearth of lily-gilding,
that he played in every important
style period from baroque to neo
classical, or rhapsodize at all—when
"Heifetz played" covers everything?
Still probably the most appro
priate of all critical comments on
this musical phenomenon is the sug
gestion of G. B. Shaw long ago in
London that Heifetz play just one
wrong note every night before go
ing to bed. lest out of jealousy for
j such perfection the gods destroy him.
