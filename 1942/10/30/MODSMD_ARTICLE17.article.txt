# Big Game Ball To Be in Gym
## War Shifts Affair To Campus Location 
### 
Ted Eberle, chairman of this
year's Big Game Dance, last night
announced that the annual dance
will take place in the Women's Gym
on campus and that the price of
dance tickets will be $2.75, a sub
stantial reduction from last year's
tariff.
Eberle, in explaining why "The
Red and White Ball," as the 1942
affair has been dubbed, was moved
from the country club at which it
is usually held, said, "We have a
lot of cutting down to do this year
and an off-campus dance is one of
those things we can just as well
forget—especially when the dance
we are planning foj- Big Game night
this year promises to be bigger, bet
ter and more enjoyable than any of
the previous affairs."
WILL SAVE GAS
Eberle further stated that having
(he dance on campus will save many
Stanford!tes a precious tank of gas,
since gas rationing goes into effect
the day after Big Game, and that
Farm men and women who find
themselves stuck in Del Monte or
San Francisco the day after the game
will probably not be too happy about
burning a full tank of gasoline to get
back to school.
The dance, sponsored by Cardi
nals, will carry out the red and
white motif completely, according to
Eberle, and will last from 9 p.m. to
1 a.m.
BAND NOT YET CHOSEN
"A band for the dance has not yet
been chosen," said Eberle, "but we
are corresponding with the Music-
Corporation of America right now
and have several fine outfits on the
line. At any rate, we are certain
that we shall have a band—and a
good one, too,"
The $2.75 ticket price includes
tax. Dress for the big occasion will
be optionally formal.
Tickets will shortly go on sale at
the A.S.S.U. office.
The various committees of the
dance will be announced Monday.
