Although it is certain that (1) trains are crowded; (2) tickets arc hard
to get; (3) additional sections and cars are unavailable; and (4) automobiles
will he practically useless for transportation, additional information is still
: needed before Stanford's Christmas vacation schedule can definitely he
| formulated.

This was decided at a meeting of
students and faculty members yes
terday morning. Dr. J. P. Mitchell,
registrar and chairman of the com
mittee, was appointed to obtain the
necessary information so that a rec
ommendation can be made by next
week.
LETTER FROM RAILWAYS
The uncertainty of the vacation
became apparent last week when the
University received a letter from the
Railroad Associations recommending
that all schools start their vacations
not later than Dec. 15 and begin
school not sooner than Jan. 15.
The main difficulty in having such
a long vacation, it was pointed out
by University officials, is that those
men who arc trying to finish their
educations as soon as possible before
being called into the service will be
handicapped by every day lost when
they are not attending school.
Another minor difficulty is that
many persons still would be unable
to get home and would be forced to
stay here on the campus. There is
a possibility, however, that one each
of the men and women's dormitories
could be opened to save on operating
costs.
CLASSES MAY BE OPEN
There would be no social enter
tainment for such a period, but an
intersession has been discussed which
would allow those students who arc
interested to take independent study
work in their major subject or enroll
in civilian defense, first aid, and sim
ilar courses. Work would be avail
able for some in Palo Alto, San Fran
cisco, and San Jose.
A tentative program which would
solve practically all of these diffi
culties was outlined at the prelimi
nary meeting held last week. Dras
tic, but practical for almost all
problems, are its six points:
1. Omit Thanksgiving recess ex
cept for Thanksgiving Day.
2. Schedule finals for Dec. 11, 12,
14, and 15 instead of Dec. 15-18.
3. Register for Winter Quarter
Dec. 19 instead of Jan. 4.
4. Start classes for Winter Quar
ter Dec. 21 instead of Jan. 5.
5. Recess Dec. 25, 26, 27.
6. Holiday Jan. 1.
The scheduled University recess
starts Dec. 18 (the last day of finals)
and ends Jan. 4. It. has been suggest
ed that students try to obtain rail
road reservations for this regular
vacation, and if a change of program
is necessary, reservations may be
cancelled.
Those attending the meeting were
Miss Anastasia Doyle, Dean of Wom
en Mary Yost, Professor Edgar Eu
gene Robinson, Dean of Men John
Bunn, Professor Edwin A. Cottrcll,
Dr. Mitchell, Leslie Langneckcr,
Rosemary Cross, Ed Stamm, Bill
Moran, Bob Crary, and John Horrall.
