MOSCOW, Friday, Oct. ."JO (U.R)—
The Germans, at a cost of 1,500 men
and 11 tanks, pushed 50 to 100 yards
deeper into North Stalingrad Thurs
day, it was announced today, but
that fourth Soviet setback in the
Volga city in two days was offset by
reports that blizzards sweeping
th rough the Western Caucasus al
ready have frozen to death hundreds
of Germans.
The German momentum appeared
to be diminishing in Stalingrad—the
last previous gain having been from
100 to 200 yards—and additional
cause for Soviet optimism came in
front reports that the Red relief
army bearing down from the north
west to lift the siege has seized a
large town and routed the 13th Ru
manian Division.
