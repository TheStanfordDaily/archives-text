Gaily colored war posters hung on !
he walls of the sunny room, a radio
played softly in the background, and j
15 girls sat at two long tables rolling
bandages and wrapping sterile dress- j
ings.
Every afternoon between 1 and 5
scenes like this are being enacted in
the new Stanford War Workshop.
Located in the building behind the
Quad office, the Workshop is a co
operative student project carrying on
important war work for the Red
Cross and the Stanford Health
Services.
Organized under the auspices of i
the Stanford War Board, the Work- I

| shop was opened last Tuesday when
i volunteers from three living groups
| worked on two-hour shifts, accord
! ing to Beanie Naffziger, general
i chairman. Since Tuesday, various
i living groups have supplied their
j quota of workers each afternoon.
"We have the volunteers to carry
on the various projects of the Work
shop," emphasized Chairman Naff
ziger, "but we do need materials.
If students will bring in their old
silk stockings, small books, playing
cards, and especially steel needles,
j the Workshop can really do an im
portant job toward making life a lit
| tie more comfortable for the men
] overseas."
