### 
Frosh intramural grid squads
went into action for the first time
yesterday on a mixed-up menu fea
turing three unscheduled upper
class contests, a shortage of referees
and yardsticks, and lots of sloppy
but interesting touch football.
Action was most plentiful in En
cina League 8 games. 4W forced
3W into a playoff before the lat
ter's Johnny Petrozini went 60
yards down the sidelines to break a
6-6 tie. Petrozini took a pass from
Jerry Stanley for 3W's first tally,
and Don Bates later scored the 4W
touchdown by taking an aerial in
the end zone.
Minus a referee, 1W nevertheless
squeezed out a 7-0 decision over 2W,
when Dick Pfiefer took a pass from
Rod Fowler to score.
WOODY SCORES TWICE
Only League 7 skirmish found
Bernie Woody leading 2E to a 12-0
win over lE. Woody caught a pass
for one score, and ran 20 yards for
the other. 3E and 4E defaulted to
each other.
Two undefeated sevens, El Toro
and Kappa Sig, kept their records
clean while once beaten Phi Psi
scored their second win in the day's
other contests.
Carlos Brown took to the air for
Toro's lone touchdown against
Branner, passing to Tommy Morton
In the end zone, for a 6-0 win. Kap
pa Sig projected itself into title
contention by winning its playoff
tussle from the Dells, 12-0. Ralph
Ashton scored first on a sensational
run around left end, and Carrol
Byrd tallied the final counter on a
30-yard pass interception.
PHI PSI REVIVES
Slightly deflated Phi Psi came to
life in the closing minutes of their
battle with D.U. to drive for two
quick touchdowns and a 12-0 ver
dict. Keith Pinion scored the first
on a run and passed to Bill Nourse
for the second.
Today's games have been called
off because a number of mural grid
ders are going south for the Indian-
Uclan clash, according to tourna
ment director Harry Wolter. The
| revised sked will be found in Mon
day's Daily.
