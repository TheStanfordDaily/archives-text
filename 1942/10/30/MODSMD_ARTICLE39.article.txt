# Frosh To Meet Navy Gridders At San Diego
## 
### 
Coach Francis Wilcox's freshman I
gridders play their second service J
team tomorrow at San Diego when
they meet the U.S. Naval Training •
Station at 1:30 p.m. Twenty-five,
players will make the trip.
At press time, Information from j
the naval team was siill forthcom- j
ing, but Wilcox is expecting any- j
thing—a single wing, double wing, |
or a Notre Dame box formation. I
He has drilled his team on defensive
tactics for all possible formations.
The frosh played against the single
wing in the St. Mary's Pre-flight B
team game several weeks ago, with
the line and backs able to cope
with the running attack but weak
on pass defense.
Wilcox expects to find the oppo
sition much older and matured men,
and possibly some with a great deal
of college experience. The Navy
team can't be too bad, for they have
a game scheduled with the varsity
of a Central California college.

the naval team was siill forthcom- j
ing, but Wilcox is expecting any- j

He has drilled his team on defensive
tactics for all possible formations.
The frosh played against the single
wing in the St. Mary's Pre-flight B
team game several weeks ago, with
the line and backs able to cope
with the running attack but weak
on pass defense.
Wilcox expects to find the oppo
sition much older and matured men,
and possibly some with a great deal
of college experience. The Navy
team can't be too bad, for they have
a game scheduled with the varsity
of a Central California college.
