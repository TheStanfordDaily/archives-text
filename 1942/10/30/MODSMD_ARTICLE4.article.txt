# War Board Needs Beet Harvesters
## 
### 
The War Board was callcd upon
to handle one of its toughest emer
gency calls yesterday, when the
owner of local sugar beet fields per
sonally made a request for a corps
of student workers.
Urgency of the situation was told
by Mr. Harley Jenecke, beet rancher.
"America's sugar supply looks very
meager and Secty. of Agriculture
Wickard has asked us to produce 10
per cent more sugar this year than
we did in 1941," he said.
Jenecke added that he had an
ample crop of beets in the fields, but
that harvest was a different matter,
in view of the labor shortage. He
pointed out that prowling subma
rines in the Caribbean have cut off
a large portion of our normal im
portation of Cuban sugar.
LIVING GROUP TEAMS
The matter was thus laid before
the SWB and arrangements are now
being made to organize teams of 10
men from every living group to
harvest the beets.
President Ed Stamm has called
representatives of men's groups to
meet this afternoon at 1 p.m. in the
Education Building to hear Jenecke
and Herbert J. Cornish of the Cham
ber of Commerce, who will explain a
new program for team workers.
Four teams of 10 men will work
on a competitive basis during after
noons for four hours. A bonus will
be awarded to each afternoon's most
productive team. At the end of the
harvest, in two or three weeks, a
trophy will be given to the group
harvesting the greatest beet tonnage.
BEGINS TUESDAY
This program will being next Tues
day. Workers will be excused from
afternoon gym classes and, according
to Harry Maloney, gym instructor,
"the hard work in the fields will be
a great aid in the physical fitness
program."
Living group representatives are
urged to cooperate to the fullest ex
tent in organizing their labor teams.
AFTERNOON SHIFTS
Teams will work from 1 to 5 p.m.,
and will be rotated so that a team
will work once a week. A morning
shift will be effective on Sundays.
The S.W.B. also announced that
paychecks for last week's tomato
pickers are ready to be picked up. A
bonus was awarded to the workers
for their productive work.
Women are asked to sign up as
usual with their living group cap
tains for work on Saturday and Sun
day picking walnuts. The workers
will leave at 8:15 Saturday morning
and 9:15 Sunday morning from
Roble.

The War Board was callcd upon
to handle one of its toughest emer
gency calls yesterday, when the
owner of local sugar beet fields per
sonally made a request for a corps
of student workers.
Urgency of the situation was told
by Mr. Harley Jenecke, beet rancher.
"America's sugar supply looks very
meager and Secty. of Agriculture
Wickard has asked us to produce 10
per cent more sugar this year than
we did in 1941," he said.
Jenecke added that he had an
ample crop of beets in the fields, but
that harvest was a different matter,
in view of the labor shortage. He
pointed out that prowling subma
rines in the Caribbean have cut off
a large portion of our normal im
portation of Cuban sugar.

the SWB and arrangements are now
being made to organize teams of 10
men from every living group to
harvest the beets.

Education Building to hear Jenecke
and Herbert J. Cornish of the Cham
ber of Commerce, who will explain a
new program for team workers.

on a competitive basis during after
noons for four hours. A bonus will
be awarded to each afternoon's most
productive team. At the end of the
harvest, in two or three weeks, a
trophy will be given to the group
harvesting the greatest beet tonnage.
