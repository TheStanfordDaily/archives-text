# Christmas and Stanford
## 
### 
THE ever-threatening transportation problem
is now knocking at the gates of the Farm.
Will we or will we not be able to obtain trans
portation home for Christmas? That is the gues
tion in a nutshell.
Rumors have been floating around campus
for two weeks insinuating that Stanford is hav
ing something pushed down its throat. Stan
ford is merely trying to figure out a solution
before it is too late so that we shall have some
kind of a choice to make if we find that we will
be definitely unable to get home for vacation.
The letter the University received from the
Railroad Association was sent before the gaso
line rationing was announced, which means
that the situation is more acute now than it was
several weeks ago.
The railroads have to allow men of our armed
forces first place in ticket reservations; govern
men men come next. In other words, it's a
catch-as-catch-can proposition for civilians.
We know that this is the last Christmas that
many of the men will be able to see their fami
lies for some time; we also know that many of
us have worked straight through Summer Quar
ter and have had little or no rest from studies
for almost a year. But we also know, and have
been warned, that sooner or later we would
have to make sacrifices. This would be a very
small sacrifice when we realize that it is much
more important that the men who are fighting
this war for us get to see their friends and fami
lies. They are in the war. The rest of us are
merely on the verge of it.
It isn't asking too much that we give up our
long vacation, if this is necessary, because
studies and intensive training, and not lounging
and drinking, are the important things today.
The Daily invites and expects many contri
butions to the Campus Opinion column on this
subject. A problem like this needs a lot of
airing, and we promise to print all signed letters.
Idaas are important now before any final
recommendation is made. Everyone will be
affected by this change if it is put into effect;
everyone should have something to say
about it.
