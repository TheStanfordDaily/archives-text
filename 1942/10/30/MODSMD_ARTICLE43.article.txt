# Try the Nitery

WE all agree that the campus needs a place
to gather in the evenings. Most of us who
have been to the Nitery realize that it does not
quite fill the bill. This can be explained in
several ways.
First, the Nitery is not kept clean. Coke
bottles should be returned and cigarettes should
be put out in ash trays.
Second, the campus hasn't gotten into the
Nitery habit. In the "good old days" a student
could go to the Cellar and find at least one
friend there from opening to closing time. That
isn't the case with the Nitery.
Those are the two main reasons. We feel
that the Nitery shouldn't be condemned with
out first having a legitimate trial.
