# Good Entertainment
## 
### 
WHAT to do this week-end? Leave your car
at home tonight and tomorrow night, for
there's plenty of entertainment on hand. Noth
ing sensational; nothing terrific; but lots of fun.
Walk to the Y.W.C.A. juke-box jolly-up to
night in the revamped Nitery. Although the
new transfers will be the guests of honor, every
one on campus is invited. There's nothing more
inexpensive than a juke-box dance.
And tomorrow night, Cardinals will sponsor
a Hallowe'en dance for students who are not
going south for the U.C.L.A. game. Among
other things, novel decorations are planned.
It's this type of entertainment which we need.
After Big Game, when gas rationing goes into
effect, we will be forced to stay at school. So,
keep those ideas rolling, and keep the A.S.S.U.
vice president's calendar filled with dates.
