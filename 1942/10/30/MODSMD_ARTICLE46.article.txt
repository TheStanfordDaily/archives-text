# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
If it wasn't such u serious matter I would be
grei illy amused at tlit* recent Campus Opinion let
ter from a student who complained that the free
speech and free thought of a few Stanford profes
sors were sabotaging the war effort. I can see
him now, charging the enemy lines shouting,
"I'raisc the Lord, get Homestead Mread instead. Il
does the work of Calomel without the danger of
Calomel." at which a ferocious Kducational Soci
ology prof runs up and slabs him in the back with
a copy of "I()().()()().()()() Guinea Pigs." I've heard
main ingenuous remarks made concerning what
we are lighting for. but this is the first time I have
ever heard anyone claim he was going to give his
all for the sake of American advertising.
I his student s other remarks are also most mi
enlightening. Having been a Political Science ma
jor for more than three \ears. I question his infer
ence thai this department is a hot-bed of Socialism.
If an\one who attacks boss rule, red tape, pressure
group politics, bureaucratic extravagance, \oler
apathy, and $1 a \ear chicanerv is a Socialist, then
Comrades, you've jiol another recruit.
Ihe whole trouble is that thi* student has ihe
wrong idea about education. He seems to think
that a university should turn out not trained >lu
denls. but robots little machines with a slide rule
in one hand, a set o| super-nationalistic pseudo
patriotic dogmas in the other, and no ideas in his
head. All stupid things like theories would be
tossed into the lake; evervlhing would be pniclical
and realistic a brave new world of unil\ and uni
formity.
Thank God the winds of freedom are -till blow
ing around Stanford. \\ . I'. \orberjr.
