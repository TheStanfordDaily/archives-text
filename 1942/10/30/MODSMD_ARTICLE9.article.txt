# Fawcett Listed As Doubtful Starter In Tomorrow's Tilt
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford's football team had all the symptoms of a bad cold yesterday
when it was learned that Randall "Buck" Fawcett would be listed as a
doubtful starter against U.C.L.A. at Los Angeles tomorrow. Coach Marchie
Schwartz said last night that Fawcett may play but his ailing ankle would
have to mend much more if the crashing fullback expects to play at top
+shape.

The team leaves this morning on
the Daylight.
With Fawcett an unknown quan
tity, little Ben Morrison, jackrabbit
of all trades in the Redskin back
field, will probably take over at full
back. The switch necessarily weak
ens the squad as Fawcett is the In
dians' greatest running threat.
FAWCETT MIGHT GO
For all that is known at this writ
ing Fawcett may be perfectly ready
to go to town all over the Coliseum,
so don't count on anything until you
turn on the radio, or if you're going
to the game, until you start to yell.
Down at Westwood the United
Press report indicated the Bruins
had reached "their training peak
yesterday." A1 Solari and Vic Smith
did most of the day's passing, with
their work approaching the mark
made by Bob Waterfield Wednesday.
Stanford's squad will arrive to
night in Los Angeles and go into
Saturday's game without a local
workout.
BETTING FAVORS UCLANS
As to the Cards' chances, betting
favors the Uclans at 10-8, showing
the wagering bosses' reluctance to
quote the game at even money al
though Stanford upset one of the
Coast's best teams, Southern Cali
fornia, in its last encounter.
The Bruins will show a terrific
passing game. Stanford's own of
fensive should go mostly via the
ground, but now that its best runner
may be sidelined, quarterback Ray
Hammett may take to the air and
meet the Bruins' Bob Waterfield on
even ground.
If Stanford's line can hold down
all the Bruins have to offer along
the ground, if its pass defense can
hold down Waterfield, if its own of
fense is worth a touchdown or two,
the Indians can be rated a 50-50
chance.

fensive should go mostly via the
ground, but now that its best runner
may be sidelined, quarterback Ray
Hammett may take to the air and
meet the Bruins' Bob Waterfield on
even ground.
If Stanford's line can hold down
all the Bruins have to offer along
the ground, if its pass defense can
hold down Waterfield, if its own of
fense is worth a touchdown or two,
the Indians can be rated a 50-50
chance.
Stanford's football team had all the symptoms of a bad cold yesterday
when it was learned that Randall "Buck" Fawcett would be listed as a
doubtful starter against U.C.L.A. at Los Angeles tomorrow. Coach Marchie
Schwartz said last night that Fawcett may play but his ailing ankle would
have to mend much more if the crashing fullback expects to play at top
+shape.

The team leaves this morning on
the Daylight.
With Fawcett an unknown quan
tity, little Ben Morrison, jackrabbit
of all trades in the Redskin back
field, will probably take over at full
back. The switch necessarily weak
ens the squad as Fawcett is the In
dians' greatest running threat.
FAWCETT MIGHT GO
For all that is known at this writ
ing Fawcett may be perfectly ready
to go to town all over the Coliseum,
so don't count on anything until you
turn on the radio, or if you're going
to the game, until you start to yell.
Down at Westwood the United
Press report indicated the Bruins
had reached "their training peak
yesterday." A1 Solari and Vic Smith
did most of the day's passing, with
their work approaching the mark
made by Bob Waterfield Wednesday.
Stanford's squad will arrive to
night in Los Angeles and go into
Saturday's game without a local
workout.
BETTING FAVORS UCLANS
As to the Cards' chances, betting
favors the Uclans at 10-8, showing
the wagering bosses' reluctance to
quote the game at even money al
though Stanford upset one of the
Coast's best teams, Southern Cali
fornia, in its last encounter.
The Bruins will show a terrific
passing game. Stanford's own of
fensive should go mostly via the
ground, but now that its best runner
may be sidelined, quarterback Ray
Hammett may take to the air and
