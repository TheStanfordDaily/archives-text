"The Coke's in"
"That's the happy greeting heard today when a
new supply of Coke arrives at a cooler. Folks
wait for it... wait because the only thing like
Coca-Cola is Coca-Cola itself. Customers smile
and start moving up to pause and be refreshed.
"There's a cheerful spirit about this way of
accepting wartime restrictions. Morale is high."
