# SWB Seeks Workshop Materials
## 
### 
The Stanford War Board has
opened a drive for materials to be
used in the recently opened War
Workshop. Representatives have
been delegated in each living group
to make a week-long search for
needed articles. Collections must be
in front of the living group quausrs
by 9 o'clock on Saturday morning,
November 9.
Beginning today, the campus will
be combed for such items as maga
zines, particularly those of lighter
content, featuring cartoons and
jokes, to be used in making up
scrapbooks for soldiers; silk and
Nylon stockings for use in stretch
er pads; old sheets, which will be
torn into bandage wrappings; cot
ton and flannel material and any
clothes too old for practical use,
which will go to stuff pillows; and
the AB coats of medical students,
to be worn in surgical dressing
rooms.
Students are asked to co-operate
individually in the drive by con
ducting private searches among
their own resources and turning in
any of the articles listed above to
their living gi'oup representatives.
The War Workshop, a new proj
ect sponsored by the War Board,
has already accomplished a week's
good work. Volunteers from wom
en's living groups meet, in rotating
order, every afternoon in Wood
pecker Lodge, behind the Quad
shack. Bandage - rolling and the
making of scrapbooks are their
chief activities. The organization
must have large supplies of mate
rial to keep going, and War Board
officials hope for a good haul from
the piles of junk and unused mate
rial stored away in the campus liv
ing groups.
