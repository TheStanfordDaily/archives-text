# SWB Calls Farm Men Into Fields
## Field Work To Aid Stanford's Physical Fitness Program 
### 
Stanford students arc again being
called to the fields to do their part
in relieving a shortage of experi
enced labor to top beets. Farmers
in surrounding localities, who have
welcomed the cooperation of Stan
ford men and women in recent
crises of the harvesting season, now
urge a vital need for volunteers in
this work.
The attention of the men students
is called to two main points of the
program, which should insure a
large sign-up. First, the work is de
sirable on the score of promoting
physical fitness. Second, there is
bound to be a favorable psychologi
cal effect on government officials
who are now holding the drastic
Manpower Bill under consideration.
STANFORD KNOWS lIOW
If a large number of students turn
out to aid in this latest farm emer
gency, the result will be a further
recognition of Stanford's ability to
appraise a situation and act upon it
without being told.
Students are to sign up from their
living groups. Each group will be
assigned a day and required to pro
vide ten men for duty on that day.
This number is not held exorbitant
in proportion to the size of the liv
ing groups and considering the fact
that all men signing up will be ex
cused from gym.
MEET AT BOOKSTORE
The group assigned to each day
will meet in front of the Bookstore
at 12:45 to await transportation pro
vided by Mr. Jenecke. The men will
spend the afternoon in the fields,
between the houx-s of 1 and 5 or 5:30.
Arrival back on campus in plenty of
time for dinner is guaranteed.
The Stanford War Board is or
ganizing the program and making
arrangements for carrying it
through, but it is emphasized that
each living group is being depended
upon to react individually and take
upon itself the responsibility of meet
ing the situation.
Five living groups already have
responded to the call. These include
four fraternities; Delta Tau Delta,
Zeta Psi, Alpha Delta Phi. and Phi
Gamma Delta. Encina Hall is on
the nrohnhilitv list
