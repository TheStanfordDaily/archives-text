# 'Dimes' Drive Gathers Speed
## 
### 
"Dimes for Diplomas" collectors
start their fourth rounds tonight en
couraged by a quota-breaking re
sponse from Stanfordites, which has
already added $377.71 to the "after
the-war" scholarship fund this
quarter.
As the $5,500 goal of the drive
draws nearer the 50 per cent mark,
(substantial donations from summer
and spring quarter students opened
the campaign) about ten living
groups remain its most consistent
performers.
This quarter, Fiji, Sigma Nu. ATO,
Co-Op, Tri-Delt, and El Toro have
three straight 100 per cent contri
butions to their credit. Madrona,
AOPi, Elm and Hawthorne units
from Union, Delta Gamma, and
Kappa Kappa Gamma have uni
formly high totals.
Roble's three contributions, high
lighted by the 100 per cent donation
last Monday, have been $17.63,
$28.51, and $25.83. Their Encina con
temporaries have had three contri
butions of $27 16, $19.64, and $15.86.
Only slip-ups in the fall drive thus
far have been along the Lower Row
where fraternity collections have
been especially low. New efforts to
increase support of the program in
this section will be made this week,
committee sponsors stated.
The "Dimes for Diplomas" which
arc collected form a scholarship fund
to provide post-war grants to Stan
ford men in the armed services. To
receive such a grant, a man must
have only one quarter of work re
maining for his degree. About 50
scholarships will be available if the
original goal is not increased.
