### 
All possible Army, Navy, and Ma
rine Cisrps enlistment programs
available to University students will
be presented at a men's assembly
this morning between !) and 11 a.m.
in Memorial Hall by a joint services
Procurement Committee which will
be on campus for three days. Men
attending the meeting will be ex
cused from !) a.m. and 10 a.m.
classes.
The committee will not carry on
enlistment activities during its
three-day visit, Dr. Karl M. Cow
dery, associate registrar, said when
announcing the assembly. The men
are here merely for the purpose of
presenting the details of enlistment
plans, he said, and for answering
students' questions. However, a re
cruiting board will call on the cam
pus Nov. 23 to accept applications
for enlistment.
FIVE REPRESENTATIVES
The joint board of the armed
services includes five representa
tives, one each from the Army, the
Army Air Corps, the Marine Corps,
Naval Aviation, and the Navy V-l
and V-7 programs. Each of these
men will present briefly their plan
of enlistment, which will be fol
lowed by a discussion period.
During the balance of today and
for the next two days members of
this committee will be available for
consultations by students in Rooms
50-60 of the B.A.C. Each repre
sentative will have a separate room
and the men of the campus are
welcome to drop in on any one or
more of the men for discussion, Dr.
Cowdery stated.
At the close of the committee's
visit each service will leave descrip
tive material and application blanks
with the Stanford armed service
representative, Dr. Cowdery. These
blanks may be retained for presen
tation to the recruiting board which
will be on campus Nov. 23, or may
be presented to the service head
quarters on campus or in San Fran
cisco.
JOINT PROGRAM
The program this morning is pari,
of a joint program agreed upon by
the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps,
on a basis which, for universities
which have an R.0.T.C., prohibited
other services from carrying on re
cruiting programs on that campus
until one month after the opening
of the Autumn Quarter. During the
first month of the quarter at Stan
ford the Army was free to make
direct or indirect approaches to .stu
dents soliciting their enlistment,
either in the R.O.T.C. or in the En
listed Reserves.
The meeting today is the first ap
proach of the school year by the
other services, but will include the
Army and R.O.T.C. representatives
also.
CLARIFIES POSITIONS
The assembly is particularly de
signed for those men not already
enlisted in one of the armed serv
ices, but is an opportunity for all
men to clarify their positions in the
armed forces, Dr. Cowdery said.
Prior to today, information re
garding branches of the service
other than the Army was available
| only through the Armed Service
! Representative or by request of the
.student from an outside recruiting
agency. The meeting today is a
| prelude to the special recruiting
; board which will call at the Univct -
| sity during the month of November
to enlist men in the various reserve
I clasifications.
The University urges all Stanford
men to consider one of these groups.
