# 'Turkish Neutrality Jeopardized'-Inonu

### 
LONDON. Nov. 1 (U.R)â€”President
Ismet Inonu told the Turkish Par
liament today that Turkey is "near
er to war than she was at the open
ing of hostilities" and the govern
ment is finding it more and more
difficult to adhere to its policy of
neutrality, the Exchange Telegraph
News Agency reported from Ankara.
Inonu took a grave view of his
country's problems and prospects in
a speech opening the autumn ses
sion of parliament.
"Above all it is necessary to in
crease the power of resistance of our
people," he was quoted by the dis
patch.
The maintenance of Turkish neu
trality becomes harder as the enmity
between the belligerents increases,
the president said, and "a wave of
confusion is sweeping the country."
Of potential significance in the
Turkish neutrality issue was a United
Press dispatch from Ankara, delayed
since Saturday. It said Russian Am
bassador Sergei Vinogradoff was
returning to Ankara soon, evidently
reflecting the re-establishment of
cordial relations between Russia and
Turkey. He left Turkey last June.
