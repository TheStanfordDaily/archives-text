# Culbertson To Speak on Peace
## 
### 
Ely Culbertson, noted contract
bridge authority, will be the next
speaker on the Tuesday Evening
Series tomorrow night at 7:30 in the
Memorial Hall Auditorium. Mr.
Culbertson's subject will be "A
Practical Blueprint for World
Peace."
Although he is widely known as
a celebrated figure in the field of
intellectual games, his real voca
tion is in the field of political sci
ence and mass pyschology.
According to Mr. Culbertson, his
real interest has been the creation
of a comprehensive and practical
system for a sane world order. That
system, he believes, is the recently
completed World Federation Plan.
He will discuss this plan and the
possibilities for its adoption in his
lecture tomorrow night.
Mr. Culbertson is a strong be
liever in the total defeat of Nazi
Germany and her militaristic al
lies. Yet he is a strong supporter of
a post-war world which will offer
equal opportunities for the victor
and vanquished alike.
