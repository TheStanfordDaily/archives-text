# GOP Congress Gain Seen In First Wartime Election
## 
### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 1 (U.R)—'The
1942 political campaign — the first
wartime by-election struggle in 24
years—moved into the final stages
tonight amid signs that Republicans
will make gains in the national legis
lature but not in sufficient force to
wrest control from the Democrats.
Some 30,000,000 Americans in 47
states will vote to elect 31 full term
and lour short term Senators, 432
full term and two short term repre
sentatives, and 32 governors. Maine
voted on Sept. 14. electing five Re
publicans to top offices—a governor,
a senator, and three representatives.
The anticipated light vote—so,ooo,-
000 cast ballots in the 1940 presi
dential election—probably will in
fluence close contests and there are
many of them. Leaders of both ma
jor political parties are urging all to
vote, and arrangements have been
made to give war workers an oppor
tunity to go to the polls.
Barring a sweep unforeseen to
night by political experts, Democrats
will retain control of Congress. Hold
over Democratic strength makes it
impossible for Republicans to cap
ture the Senate. Best estimate is
that the GOP will win from two to
six seats.
To take over the House, Republi
cans must win 52 seats. Frank E.
Gannett, vice chairman of the Re
publican National Committee, pre
dicted that the GOP will win a min
imum of 35 seats. But House Speak
er Sam Rayburn (D., Tex.), and
other Democratic leaders, believe
this figure is far too high.
In the 1938 by-election, the New
Deal lost six senators and 80 repre
sentatives.
NEW YORK IN SPOTLIGHT
Thousands or stale and local of
fices are involved in Wednesday's
balloting. But the national spot
light has turned on comparitively
few and among them is the New
York gubernatorial struggle between
former District Attorney Thomas E.
Dewey, who carries the Republican
colors, and John J. Bennett, New
York attorney general and Demo

cratic candidate.
The outcome of this contest may
have loud reverberations in 1944.
Bennett, backed by State Democratic
Chairman James A. Farley, was
nominated over opposition from
President Roosevelt who preferred
U.S. Senator James Mead, a New
Dealer. Mr. Roosevelt belatedly en
dorsed Bennett's candidacy but some
politically wise here believe that it
may have come too late.
A Bennett triumph would fasten
Farley's control over the big New
York delegation to the Democratic
nominating convention in 1944. He
split with the President over the
third term, and it is not regarded
likely here that he would support a
fourth term —if the President seeks
one—or a hand-picked New Dealer
as Mr. Roosevelt's successor.
WILLKIE FOR GOP
Wendell L. Willkie. who wore the
GOP toga in 1940 presidential cam
paign, also has entered the New
York clash. He has followed much
the same course as the President.
He opposed Dewey's nomination and
only yesterday got around to an
nouncing that he would vote for the
entire Republican ticket on Tuesday.
Another nationally known figure,
Sen. George V. Norris, Ind„ is in a
nip-and-tuck race. He is opposed
by Republican State Leader Kenneth
Wherry and by Foster May, Demo
crat, a radio commentator. The Pres
ident has endorsed Norris' candi
dacy and to this extent the Nebras
kan's defeat would be an adminis
tration reversal.
A defeat also would be chalked up
against the Now Deal if Sen. Pren
tiss M. Brown loses in Michigan. He
sponsored the recently enacted anti
inflation bill and an interpretation
of its scope, as regards the fixing of
agricultural prices, which has
brought down upon him the wrath
of the big farm organizations.
Two of the most potent political
machines in the nation—the Hague
organization in New Jersey and the
Kelley-Nash group in Illinois—
have been active in the campaign.
