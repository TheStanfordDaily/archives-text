### BILL HORNBY 
In relation to a certain football
encounter between Stanford and
IJCLA, played Saturday in Los An
geles. the following items are pre
served for the record:
The opinion of Coach Marchie
Schwartz: that Stanford's game was J
well-played except for pass defense I
on a certain play. This play, execut
ed three times, was the death of the I
Indians. "I'd like to see that team in
the Rose Bowl. They're the best
we've faced on the coast, and com
pare with Notre Dame in everything ;
but reserve strength."
Schwartz and a weary squad I
reached Palo Alto yesterday after- J
noon at 5:47. About 100 Stanford j
students, counting those who were
down there for other reasons, met
the returning team.
UCLA AT PKAK
According to Schwartz, southern
fans think that UCLA was at its |
peak against the Cards. "They re a j
spirited ball club, "Schwartz said,
"and their kicking and passing at- i
tack was marvelous."
On our own .side of the ledger,
Loren La Parde is number one mis
misfortune. A badly wrenched knee
will keep the Phoenix Arizona guard
in wraps for at least a week. Harvey
Bernard who's been playing left
guard will move over to right guard
to back up Bill Young in the spot j
against Washington, Saturday.
SONTAG COMMENTS
Daily Sports Editor Bob Sontag,
in a five-line wire which was sup
posed to have been five reams of
victory chortles, . . . No pictuies.
Who wants to see pictures of that
game? No story. Damm Waterfield."
UC L A's perhaps-to-be-a-Rose-
Bowl-daddy Babe Horrell, in com
menting on a pass play that caught
the Indians flatâ€”not once, not twice,
but three times . . . "Our boys were
in the right place and Stanford's
weren't." An added Horrell com
ment: Fred Boensch, Indian reserve
tackle, was the best Farm lad on the
field.
A FEW DETAILS
The audience numbered 55,000.
UCLA had two players named
Waterfield and Solari who were very,
very good. Mr. Waterfield kicked
and passed and Mr. Solari caught and
ran. Three times they arranged
themselves in the same positions on
the field. Three times it worked.
With Stanford leading 7-0, as op
timism floated by all the radio re
ceivers in Palo Alto and environs,
Waterfield passed from his own 46
to Solari on the Card 17 yard line
who scored. Snelling converted.
Right back down the field, with a
minute and a half remaining for the
gun, Waterfield threw a 23-yard flip
to Stanford's 14. Again receiving the
pass, Solari field-marshalled his
team to a score in five plays.
PASS WORKS AGAIN
In the fourth quarter it worked
again,^this time for 33 yards. The
Stanford touchdown came after Lav
erty recovered UCLA's fumble of
the opening kickoff. The Cards were
over in eight plays.
Some statistics:
Bruins had 154 yards from scrim
mage to Stanford's 84. The UCLA
passers netted 174 yards, Stanford,
(51. Stanford had nine first downs to
the winners 14.
Buck Fawcett, whose ankle is not
re-injured but merely still-injured,
Chuch Taylor, Stamm, Vucinich,
La Parde, and Boensch kept up the
fine record of the tackle-to-tackle
wall.
In the backfield, Bobby Andrews
did a good job at quarter in sparking
some belated drives. Except on pass,
defense, the Stanford backfield corps
can have a fairly good feeling. In
cidentally, not one of the bench
players appreciated the attitude of
the Farm rooters in trying to tell
Schwartz the why's-and-wherefores
of substituting.
