IKYING A SLOW DEATH AT THE
LOS ANGELES COLISEUM?
Oct. 31 —One thing, UCLA was the
first team to score through the Indian
forward wall this season. But the
trouble was the Bruins also went
through the air three times during
the game, scoring on two of the
passes and setting up the third
touchdown the same way. A long
pass from Bob Waterfield did the
trick each time. When Vic Smith
gathered in that last one there wasn't
an Indian within 20 yards of him—
the guy even had time to wave to a
few admirers in the stands and then
walk on over the goal line.
SWISS CHEESE'
Stanford's pass defense rivaled the
best quality of swiss Cheese—there
were so many holes in it.
Babe Horrell said after the game
was over that "his receivers were in
the right places and Stanford's pass
defenders weren't." Seems like the
Redskin backs just followed the
wrong man.
Perhaps Marchie Schwartz will
shift to a strict man-to-man pass
defense setup ... It may be a heaven
for quick kickers, but it would sure
save some touchdowns.
DINKY SECTION
The Stanford rooting section, in its
smallest size ever seen at the game
here, was a great help during the
last quarter when Stanford trailed,
20-7. There wasn't a peep out of
'em. When we're winning it's okeh
by this dept. if they shut up like
clams, but when the Indians are be
hind that's when the section should
yell. That's when the team needs
some yelling.
The Stanford line as usual out
played its backfield. If that happens
much more this season maybe the
two can be just switched, putting
the backfield in the line and the line
in the backfield. They sure need
sumpin'.
