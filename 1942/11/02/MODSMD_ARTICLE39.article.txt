### BOB POTTER 
Sammy Lee, national champion springboard and high diver, stood out as
the star of the Autumn Aquacade Friday afternoon in the men's pool.
Following a program of diving and swimming by champions in various
types of water sports, Lee did his famous dives which made him collegiate
and American champion this year and earned for him the title of "The
World's Greatest Diver." *

Other stars of the show wei'e Stan
ford's Marjorie Gestring, Olympic
and American diving champion and
freshman here: A1 White, '24. Olym
pic diving champion; and Jim Gam

with a half twist. Another of his
combinations executed with perfect
control was a half gainer with a half
twist and a one and a half forward
somersault.
LEE EXHIBITS PROWESS
Although the 28 foot tower at the
men's pool is five feet short of the
standard 33 foot tower, Lee did his
famous running three and one half
forward somersault, a dive which
only he is able to perform. He also
did his two and one half forward
somersault from the high tower with
a split. That is, he opened into the
layout position after a one and a half
somersault and then closed into the
tuck for another somersault before
he hit the water.
Speaking of Sammy Lee, Coach
Ernie Bransten declared, "I think he
is the greatest diver in the world
today without a doubt! I don't think
any other diver can touch him, and
I've seen all the professional diving
talent in the last 30 years. A1 White
was the champion in his day, but no
divers then attempted the dives this
boy does now."

NAVY DEMONSTRATES
Under the direction of Lieutenant
Jack Torney officers from the Navy
staged a demonstration of the kind j
of swimming needed by men in dis
asters at sea. The men showed how
to make life preservers of their j
clothing by inflating them with air |
and even how to make a temporary j
life raft for a wounded man at sea.
The need for knowledge of how to
take care of oneself in the water was
emphasized by Lt. Torney when he
quoted a seaman rescued from a
sinking aircraft carrier who wired
home: "Thank God I knew how to
swim!"
Coming last on the program, Sam
my Lee did a series of dives from
the high board and the high tower
which brought loud applause from
the audience of 1.500. One of his
most difficult dives and one which
he repeated upon demand was Lee's
"commando" in which he started
with a full gainer landing on the
board. Then he completed the dive !
with a one and a half somersault
