# Griswold Calls Extra Election
## 
### 
Bob Griswold, head of the elec
tion board, announced last night
that there will be a special election
this Friday, November 5. It was
found necessary to call this election
because of students leaving school
in order to join some branch of the
armed services.
Two positions have opened on
the B.A.C. Any man is eligible for
the posts opened by Frank Hewitt
and Larry Dee. Frank Hev/itt left
school this summer to join the
Army. Dee is planning on joining
the Navy this January.
The Army has also taken away
one man, Vic Horgon, from Excom.
His post may be filled by any grad
uate student, either man or woman.
Bob Griswold said that nomina
tions will be open all day Wednes
day from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. A box
will be placed in the main library
for petitions. All petitions must be
signed by 15 A.S.S.U. students.
A meeting is being called Tues
day afternoon at 5 o'clock in the
Nitery for all of the election board
members. Bob Griswold says,
"Since this is our first meeting this
quarter, it is absolutely imperative
that all members attend."
