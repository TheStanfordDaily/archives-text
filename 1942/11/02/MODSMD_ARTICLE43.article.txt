# Freshmen Lose To Bluejackets
## 
### 
Two Stanford Freshman fumbles,
i deep in their own territory, and a
first play pass were all the San Diego
j Naval Training Station needed to
win, 20-13, last Saturday at San Di-
I ego.
The Frosh scored in the first
quarter after four finutes. Quarter
j back Jack Brownson drove from the
! two-yard line for the tally after he
threw a 20 yard pass to right half
back Mark Heffelfinger.
On the first play after the kickoff,
a Bluejacket halfback, Special De
livery Jones tossed a pass into the
end zone to former U.S.F. star, A1
Braga.
In the third quarter the service
j men recovered a Stanford fumble on
the Frosh 14. Seconds later Braga
bucked over from the four yard line.
Moments later the Bluejackets re
covered another Stanford fumble on
j the 13 yard stripe. On the first play
Braga passed to right end Corwin
Piatt for the score.
