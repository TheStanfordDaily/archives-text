# Cardinal Soccer Team Ties Dons
## 
### 
Johnie Lazar, center forward of
the University of San Francisco Dons,
scored two late goals to give his team
a 2-2 tie with the Stanford Univer
sity Cardinal soccer team last Sat
urday morning.
As the result of the game, Stan
ford is still undefeated in three
league games with two ties and a
win.
John Gertridge scored the first
goal of the game from his inside right
position to give Stanford a 1-0 lead
in the second quarter. Tommy Trent,
inside left, tipped in another one in
the third period after a mad scramble
around the San Francisco goal. It
was brought about by a nice center
shot by left wing Dave Bills.
Then with the Indians leading 2-0,
Lazar scored twice to tie the game
up. Both teams played a furious
last quarter, and although Stanford
dominated the play and kept the ball
in Don territory most of the time,
they were unable to put in the win
ning goal.
