### 
Approximately 5,500 persons have
been stopped and warned or charged
with speed violations in California
since the 35 mile speed limit was
put into effect October Ist, the Cali
fornia Highway Patrol revealed to
day.
Speed violation reports are segre
gated by county and sent to county
tire rationing boards twice a week.
An occasional violator is found to
have a priority rating on tires, but
such instances are exceptional. Al
though violation cards are arriving
at the rate of 100 per day, public
compliance with the new victory
limit has been exceptionally good,
according to Patrol officers.
