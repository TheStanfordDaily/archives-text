# Indian Mermen Whip Olympians
## 
### 
It took two overtime periods to
do it, but Stanford's varsity water
polo team managed to squeeze out
a 10-8 victory over the powerful
Olympic Club Saturday afternoon
in the Encina pools.
For the first time in four years,
the Indian mermen topped the Club
men, perennial Northern California
champions, who walloped California,
17-9 recently. And they did it with
out the services of Emmett Cashin,
first-string sprint.
Hadley Bacon recovered from a
sprained back to score four points,
followed by Dick Narver with 3, A1
Weeden with 2, and Bill Mapel with
1. Mapel, shifted from forward to
sprint in Cashin's absence, did a
very creditable job.
It was a tight game all the way. It
was tied up 4-4 at halftime, 6-6 at
the end of the regular contest. Goals
by Mapel and Narver made it 8-8,
