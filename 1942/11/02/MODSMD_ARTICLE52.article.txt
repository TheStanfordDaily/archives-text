# Business as Usual
## 
### 
PHILADELPHIA, Oct. 29 (UP).—Passing a
resolution that colleges "are not interested in
business as usual," the American Association
of Colleges today placed their entire re
sources at the service of the nation.
The association, taking the attitude that the
Army and Navy best know the manpower
needs ot the nation, rejected by an over
whelming vote a resolution asking that 18-
and 19-year-olds be deferred until the end
of the present academic year.
The 500 college executives who attended
the one-day session urged the selection of
youth for college education on the basis of
demonstrated ability and democratic equal
ity.
During today's meeting, the association ap
proved the plan advanced by the committee
on the relationships of higher education to the
federal government. The plan called for a
more extensive use of colleges as training
centers for specialists and officers in the
armed forces and asked the establishment of
enlisted training corps at colleges and uni
versities.
A resolution adopted by the council also
urged that a program be prepared to fit
women students and men students physi
cally unqualified for military service to par
ticipate in the war effort and in auxiliary civil
ian activities.
nnHE above story came over the United Press
x wire after Friday morning's Daily had gone
to bed. Since the decisions made at this con
ference of the American Association of Coleges
are so important to our lives as college students
and since they are vitally connected with our
continued stay at college, we are printing it in
today's editorial column.
Although the story speaks for itself in re
gard to its scope, it might be wise to consider
ourselves in relation to it and how we as a
University and as individuals stack up against
the ideas of the convention.
With our early change to a four-quarter sys
tem, with the breaking down of academic bar
rires, and with the increased emphasis placed
upon physical fitness, the University certainly
is not interested in "business as usual."
With the taking of 18 units, and the organiza
tion of the Stanford War Board, the students
have made moves to abandon "business as
usual."
True, there is much left for the students to do.
The War Board and its achievements might be
come the product of the united student body
and not the accomplishment pf an interested
few. But that day is coming and the veneer of
sophistication that once kept patriotism, and
even thought and work, from our Ivory Tower
is cracking.
The action of the members of the American
Association of Colleges, whose judgment as
educators cannot be doubted, has swept away
the last vestiges of hope for deferment on the
ground that "someone educated will have to
be left to rebuild society after the war." Wisely
the convention refused to ask for deferment of
18- and 19-year-olds.
The war is a short-range venture and we have
to win it before we can speculate with peace—
a long-range plan. Men are needed to win the
war, and no one is better qualified to know
these needs than the Army and the Navy them
selves.
Less closely associated with us as under
graduates, but still very much a part of the
college problem, is the use of colleges as
training centers "for specialists and officers in
the armed forces." Harvard has been a leader
in this field, until now almost as many blue and
khaki uniforms are seen in the Yard as tweed
coats and grey flannels. Stanford has a Civilian
Defense School, and with excellent facilities,
both scholastic and physical, we are not far from

a logical choice as a school to train Army and
Navy specialists.
Yesterday Secretary of Labor Perkins an
nounced that women will have to fill 3,000,000
jobs in the immediate future. The war is for
women too. It is not a war for them to sit at
home and wait and knit; it is a war in which they
must weld, file, and share executive burdens.
At Stanford we must realize this. More women
must come to college to learn something and to
equip themselves to help carry the burden of a
warring government, and not as a four-year
interim between high school and life.
As a University and as individuals we should
try to see that no part of us is interested in
"business as usual." A1 Hampson
