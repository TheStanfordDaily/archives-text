The Editor, Sir:
The railroads have requested that school should
l>e dismissed before December loth and not taken
up before January 15th. There should be some
better way of compl)iug with ibis request than b\
abandoning vacation altogether. Those of us who
are taking engineering, business, law, medicine and
other professional or pre-professionul courses need
some rest between finals and the beginning of
( lasses. 'I his is necessary so that we can do our
best work for the following quarter.
None of us wish to overcrowd the railroads nor
to deprive service men of their opportunity to get
home for Christmas, but still there should be some
method of allowing the railroads their space from
December 15th to January 15th and still allow us
some rest period.
Several solutions occur, which would seem to be
satisfactory:
1. To let out school on the fifteenth and lake it
up again on the fifteenth of January. Then
there occur a number of ways to make up the
two weeks that lias been lost.
a. Extend the spring quarter two weeks.
b. Make more use of Saturday classes,
c. Shorten winter quarter and only give four
units for a course meeting fixe days a week
etc.
d. Cut oul the Thanksgiving vacation (ex
cept for Thursday) and do the same with all
of the intervening one day vacations.
2. Let the railroads handle the problem by re
fusing to sell students tickets on the oxer
crowded trains and maintain the present
schedule of vacation. Then the students who
are unable to get home would at least have an
opportunity to get a rest while staying at
school.
3. Allow a xveek study period before finals and
have finals end on Dec. 24th, then give the
week from Christmas to JN'ew Year's as vaca
tion.
Any of these methods would scent better than
abandoning all vacations entirely. All of them
would seem to conform perfectly lo ihe request
made by the raid roads.
Chancellor \\ ilbur has asked that we all lake
heavy programs and try to get through school as
soon as possible. If we are to do this it is neces
sary to haxe some rest between quarters.
Respectfully yours,
A Student.

The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the proposed elimination of
Christmas vacation, 1 have a few ideas which I
am certain are shared by a large percentage of
Stanford students.
First, by elimination of Thanksgiving recess,
we could terminate the present quarter in time to
permit train and bus travel before tlie days of
heaviest travel. This would give many of us time
to get vacation jobs, which would contribute a
good deal to relieve the labor shortage which is
certain to become even more acute just before the
holidays than it is now. Also, many of us have been
depending heavily on these vacation jobs to help
finance our next quarter's schooling. A large
number of jobs will be available in stores, Post
Offices, railroad yards, and numerous other con
cerns. My opinion is that the great majority of
the students, both men and women, would work
this vacation, rather than lounge around and drink
as seems to be the Editor s idea of Christmas va
cation.
Then too, regarding those Stanford students who
will soon enter the service—which would mean
more to them, seeing their parents, brothers, sis
ters, and friends for perhaps the last time, or the
few days schooling which could be gained by
elimination of Christmas vacation?
Many of us are carrying more units of work
than ever before to shorten our schedules. How
many students could begin the new quarter imme
diately after taking finals in eighteen or nineteen
units work and still be in the proper slate of mind
to settle down to hard work from the start?
Again my guess is that very little in the way of
serious study could be accomplished until after
the first of the new year. Celling behind the pro
verbial eight-ball al the start of a new quarter is
serious business, but there would be many instances
of it under the proposed plan.
Altlu •ugh there is no doubt that the new plan
has ils merits, the disadvantages seem to outweigh
the advantages, and sticking to the old plan of
having a vacation seems the wise thing to do. A
vote of the students on the question might even be
the answer to the problem.
Respectfully,
A Student.
