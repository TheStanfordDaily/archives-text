# Baccaloni Is Outstanding In 'Coq d'Or'
## 
### 
"Le Coq d'Or" was almost a one
man show at the San Francisco Op
era House Friday night with Basso
Baccaloni doing everything right in
the role of King Didon.
But Baccaloni and the full-blown
voice of Thelma Votipka, Rimsky-
Korsakoff's orchestration, and Push
kin's fairy plot were not enough to
deliver the score's intended punch—
the other characters being but so-so,
and continual chatter by the
prompter betraying the production's
lack of practice. (Norm Ross: "the
most under-rehearsed opera of the
season.")
Looking back over the season,
which has been popular but unspec
tacular, which has seen no Mozart,
no Wagner, no Puccini, and no Rus
sian operas except "Coq d'Or," the
perennial questians again arise . . .
Will the European-steeped opera
managements ever realize the possi
bilities of more natural, less operatic,
opera; will the ridiculous traditions
of 200 years ago ever be cast aside in
favor of modern theater; and has not
the time come for opera to be sung in
the language we understand?
—Covey.
