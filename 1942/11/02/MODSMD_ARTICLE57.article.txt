## 
### 
Dean Mary Yost and Hank Wal
lace, president of Panhellenic Coun- j
cil, will speak to all new lower divi
sion women and junior transfers to
night at 7:30 in the Education Audi
torium.
Dean Yost and Miss Wallace will
discuss sororities at Stanford, the
rushing system, and the schedule.
Junior transfers who have been
and are being entertained by sorori
ties this quarter are encouraged to
attend, because this discussion will
answer any questions which they
may have.
Tonight's meeting will be followed
by registration Nov. 3 and 4 from 1
to 5 in the Panhellenic office. Invi
tations to Autumn Quarter teas will
be extended only to those persons
who have registered. Each girl will
receive at least one invitation.
The majority of those registering
will be new lower division women, j
but those girls ineligible last year
because of grades, and also former
students who have returned after an
absence are also urged to register.
The invitational fall quarter teas
will be held Nov. 13, 14, and 15.
