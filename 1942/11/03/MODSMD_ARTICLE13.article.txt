# Lagunita, Union Merge Formals
## 
### BETTY TREMAYNE 
This Saturday night, Nov. 7, ev
ery woman on campus will have a
chance to get into the swing of
the back to the Farm movement at
the combined Lagunita-Union dance
in the Women's Gym.
Pointing out that the dance will
be one of the two formal dances
with orchestras on campus this
quarter, Ada Lee Kinard and Berna
Cilker, co-chairman of the entire
dance committee, said that the af
fair will be open to all women on
campus. In this way the two living
units are making it possible to
have an all-University backward
danceâ€”girls inviting the men.
500 EXPECTED
Approximately 500 couples will
dance to Eddie Murphy's orchestra,
which will feature some of the
smoothest tunes of the season, the
chairmen said.
Additional features will be the
fantastic forest which will change
the gym into a clearing surrounded
by trees, and the false iridescent
ceiling which creates a virtual dim
out by its black spotlight and spi
der webs.
For the past three years Lagunita
has given a Court Ball every au
tumn in its dining hall. The tradi
tional dance has been changed and
Union and Lagunita have combined
their efforts in the interests of an
all-University dance.
BID PRICES
Bids for the dance are now being
sold for $1.50 at the A.S.S.U. office
and in all of the women's resi
dences on campus.
At a previous time the date of
the dance was erroneously stated
to be in December, but next Sat
urday night from 9 to 1 is the offi
cial date.
