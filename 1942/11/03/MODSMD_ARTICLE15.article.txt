CAIRO, Nov. 2 (U.R) â€” German
tanks have run through a heavy Al
lied air and artillery barrage to re
inforce Axis troops trapped against
the Egyptian coast by Australian
tafanirymln. but all attempts to
break out of the pocket have been
j beaten back, it was announecd to
! night.
(The Berlin radio said Monday
j night that British forces broke
i through the Axis lines during the
afternoon and established a narrow
sallient where a furious tank battle
is in progress. It said a British at
tempt to land, apparently by sea,
behind the German lines west of
J El Alamein Sunday night was re-
I pulsed.)
COUNTER-ATTACK DESPERATE
The Axis Afrika Korps was coun
j ter-attacking desperately all along
the 40-mile desert front, fearing that
the break-through by Australians
at the north end of the line might
result in a disastrous turning of the
entiie German left flank. Berlin
reports sand Field Marshal Erwin
Rommel had gone into the battle
field personally to direct strategy.
A British communique said that
two Axis supply ships, the first to
dare entry into bombed-out Tobruk
harbor in a week, were promptly
j sunk by RAF torpedo planes. Uni-
I ted States heavy bombers delivered
j a devastating bombardment on the
airfield at Maleme, Crete, take-off
point for most of Rommel's air re
inforcements.
STUKAS ROUTED
A large German stuka dive bomber
formation attempted to raid Allied
forward positions but never got
close, being intercepted by Allied
I fighters which shot down seven and
I forced the rest to jettison their
| bombs on Axis troops, the com
munique said.
The Axis force was isolated be-
I tween the embattled "Hill of Jesus,"
just west of El Alamein, and Sidi
I Abd-el-Rahman, 13 miles to the
j northwest on the curving Mediter
ranean shore, front dispatches said.
