### BOB FISHER 
"A Practical Blueprint for World
Peacc" will be the theme that Ely
Culbertson, noted contract bridge
authority, will discuss tonight at
7:30 in the Memorial Hall Auditor
ium as the fifth speaker in the cur
rent Tuesday Evening Series.
Although Mr. Culbertson is widely
known as a celebrated figure in the
field of intellectual games, his real
vocation is political science and mass
psychology.
According to Mr. Culbertson, his
real interest has been the creation of
a comprehensive and practical sys
tem for a sane world order. That
system, he believes, is the recently
completed World Federation Plan.
VILLARD'S COMMENT
Of this plan, Oswald Garrison Vil
lard, noted authority on the subject,
has said: "Of the many plans for
_____
The War and Peace Discussion
Group of the SWB will hold a fol
low-up meeting on Mr. Culbertson's
talk Wednesday night at 7:30 in the
Women's Clubhouse.
the post-war world which I have
read and studied, Ely Culbertson's
by all odds is the best. It is brilliant
in its conceptions, startling in its
solutions, original at many points,
and so actuated by a desire for jus
tice and fair play for all the peo
ples of this war-torn earth as to
compel my complete admiration.
. . . For the United Nations such a
charter, if they will adopt and pro
claim it, should be worth far more

| than all their bombers and battle
ships put together."
Many feel that this plan may be
very useful as an instrument which,
through its appeal to the nations of
the world, may hasten the advent of
peace.
"STRAIGHT-JACKET" WAR
When asked if his plan was the
outgrowth of pacifism, he said, "I
should like to be a pacifist, if I could
afford to be one, but I don't believe
in individual pacifism. It gets one
nowhere. There is no use in trying
to convince war lords. It is a waste
of time and effort. Take away their
opportunities for profit and they dis
appear. What I have tried to do is
to put war in a straight-jacket."
TOTAL NAZI DEFEAT
Having lived all his early life in
Europe, Culbertson has first hand
knowledge of the situation there. He
was educated in Russia, at the Uni
versity of Geneva, and at L'Ecole
Superieure des Sciences Econo
miques in Paris. His father was an
American geologist and mining en
gineer who founded the Grozny oil
fields in the Caucasus; his mother
the daughter of a Cossack general.
He is a strong believer in the total
! defeat of Nazi Germany and her
militaristic allies, yet he advocates
a post-war world that will offer
! equal opportunities for the victor and
j vanquished alike.
MACHINE DRUNK
It is Mr. Culbertson's contention
| that humanity is drunk with ma
chines. He states, "Unless the war
j of machines is put into a merciless
I straight-jacket, it will destroy free
1 civilization. Either war itself must
be conquered or it will finally con
quer the world." The only way to
| conquer war. he says, is to create
a machine of peace more powerful
than the machine of war.
Can such a machine of peace be
built? Can the long hatreds of the
world be neutralized and the seeth
ing conflicts within it be harmonized
for the foundation of a new and last
ing world order? In his discussion
of "A Practical Blueprint for World
Peace" Mr. Culbertson will attempt
| to answer these questions and to
, outline his plan for World Federa
tion
