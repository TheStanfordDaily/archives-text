WASHINGTON, Nov. 2 (U.R) —
American forces have seized the in
itiative on Guadalcanal and are
forcing the Japs into retreat, tin-
Navy reported today after reveal
ing that U.S. submarines pounding
away at enemy supply lines have
sunk seven more Jap ships and dam
aged three others—including a con
verted aircraft carrier.
Paced by fighter planes and dive
bombers which silenced enemy artil
lery, the American ground forces
sprung a small-scale offensive and
at one point a band of Marines made
a two-mile advance.
The attack was launched to the
west of Henderson airfield and a
"small force" of Marines succeeded
in driving across the Matanikau
River.
JAPS RETREATING SLOWLY
". . . The Japanese were reported
to be retreating slowly," a com
munique said.
The retreat came Sunday after
day-long attacks by fighter planes
and bombers which hammered en
emy positions in the northwest sec
tor of Guadalcanal.
The Navy revealed that U.S. sub
marines hammering away at Jap
anese supply lines extending
from Japan to the northern Solo
mons, had added 10 more ships to
the toll of destruction and damage
wrought against the enemy.
BIGGEST AND FIERCEST
The underseas blows were inde
pendent of those struck in the Solo
mons area last week by American
planes and warships which probab
ly saved Guadalcanal by hammer
ing seven Jap men-o-war and de
stroying more than 100 planes in
the biggest and fiercest sea battle
since Midway.

Last week's sea battle forced a
huge Jap invasion armada to retire
to bases in the northern Solomons
and left the Americans with at least
temporary control of waters around
Guadalcanal.
