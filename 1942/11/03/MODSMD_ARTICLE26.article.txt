dead reptile specimens in the Uni
versity's Natural History Museum
got into the museum's bottles.

the Galapagos, the jungles of Brazil,
and the Peruvian Amazon to ob
tain the specimens. Two expedi
tions financed by Timothy Hopkins,
California financier, one io Sinaloa,

sion on the Amazon had been an
other source.
