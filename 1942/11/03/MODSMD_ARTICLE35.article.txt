### BOB SONTAG 
pOST MORTIMER:
With apologies to nobody, the '
Coaster coach is the worst train ride â– 
of all time as a quick straw vote that
broke the camel's back and ours so j
adequately proved . . .the all-night i
bridgefest which would have been
just grand was blacked out by the j
porter, who shut off the car lights
just as our partner started a slam i
convention, the first of the evening ;
. . . the weather in Los Angeles was
wonderfully warm. Maybe the heat
had something to do with the in
ability of Stanford's backs to keep
track of Herr Solari . . . nothing to |
the contrary, the Indians were "in" j
Saturday's ball game all the way
along until Vic Smith gathered in
the third Watcrficld heave . . . pass- I
defenseless as it appeared against j

UCLA, two of Stanford's lesser backs
backs came up with sparkling bits
of running, namely Art Shipkcy and
Don Zappettini. both of whom almost
were off to touchdowns in the latter
stages . . . Bobby Andrews, whose
adept passing arm geared the Caxds
to a second-half rally that never
culminated, is heir to a right thumb
as big as a house. He took it on
sometime during Saturday's game,
no one knows when . . . Coach Ed- j
win C. "Babe" Ilorrell was high on j
Fred Boensch, saying he thought the
hefty San Matean outcharged some
of his regulars . . . one good thing
about the game was the 55,000 per- [
sons in attendance. Maybe the BAC
will break even on the season off j
that one . . . crowd figures for next
week's contest at Kezar should hit j
an all-time low for the Huskv-Red- ;
skin game . . . Washington won Sat
urday and will be tough to beat, al- j
though Ralph "Pest" Welch boasts
of no passer quite like friend Wat
erfield . . . nuff stuff sed.
