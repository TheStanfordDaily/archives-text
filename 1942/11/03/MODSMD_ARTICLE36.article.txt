Though it's been straightened out
now, the dept. was madder than nails
at not being given a passout chock at
the aquacade last Friday.
Couldn't beg. borrow, or steal one
from one of the doughty BAC

;uards, who maintained that it was
trict policy not to give out passout
hecks at "benefit" performances.
There just ain't no such rule, never
las been, and according to A1 Mas

To read the Los Angeles write
lps of Saturday's game you'd think
Stanford's line, backfield, personnel,
md Farm had crumbled beneath the
:runching drive of brother Bruin.
Don't believe it, for Stanford
was every bit as good as the
Bruins except for that glaring pass
defense. When the second half
started the boys seemed on their
way to a score only to have an
unfortunate fumble cob the works.
A fumble is something that's called
a "break" in football. Then again
when Waterfield had punted with
fourth and two a little over
zealous rushing knocked him flat
and the Bruins got a first down.
Later on, something that hap
pened several times, was a series of
.lipping penalties inflicted by a lit—
le over-playing on the part of a
:ouple of sophs.
There's always the absence of Buck
which made a big differ
ence. Bob Frisbee played a good ball
game for his first attempt in an In
dian uniform. He should improve
with the going.
