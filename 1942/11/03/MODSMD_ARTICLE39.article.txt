By ED LUCE
Powerhouses Zeta Psi, Kappa
Sig, and Firehouse kept unblem- |
ished records clean yesterday, but j
in all but one case showed little or
nothing in doing it.
The rule - breaking performance j
was turned in by the classy blaze
chasers, last year's titleholders, j I
who sprung Jerry Roinestad across j j
Sigma Nu's goal twice aiid grabbed j
two other tally by by air for a 26-0
victory. Roinestad passed to Walt
Farrell for the third touchdown and
Frank Wheeler fired one to Farrell j
for the fourth.
THETA DELIS BOW
Small but tough, Theta Delta Chi j
showed up Zete no end before
bowing, 19-0. Zete scoring came 1
solely through Frank McCann's af
finity for passing. McCann heaved
to basketballer Jack Dana for two
tallies, and to Bill Symes for the !
third.
Breakers were the victims of |
Kappa Sig's attack as Johnny
Brooke passed to Blaine Murray for
the feature touchdown of the 13-0
win.
SIGMA CHI ROUTS
Rout honors for the day went to
Sigma Chi, which showed little i
mercy in running up 33 points j
against the Phi Sig Kap seven. !
Larry Hudson ran for the first two !
touchdowns, and passed to Paul j
Taylor for a third. Don Smith
passed to Bob Grainger for another
touchdown, and Clarence Harvey j
threw to Taylor for the final coun- j
ter.
The Delts beat Phi Kap by de
fault, and K.A. defeated El Campo I
by the same method in the other i
two games scheduled.
