# Spartans To Meet Farm Splashers
## 
### 
Fresh from last Saturday's 10-8
victory over the powerful San Fran
cisco Olympic Club, Stanford's var
sity water polo team prepared to
day for their return game against
San Jose State tomorrow night at 8
in the Spartan plunge.
The Spartans, led by forwards
Doug Bacon and Frieller, put up a
surprisingly good fight against the
Indians in their first game before
yielding, 7-4. However, with visions
of an undefeated season before them,
Coach Ernie Brandsten's men will
be hard to stop.
The return of Emmett Cashin to
the lineup restores the Cards to their
full strength. Starting Indian lineup
probably will be Cashin and Hadley
Bacon, forwards; Bill Mapel, sprint;
Dick Narver and A1 Weeden, guards;
I Bob Jones, center back; and Pete
; Lee, goalie.
