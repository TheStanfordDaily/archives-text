# Big League Clubs Select 20 Minors

### 
CHICAGO, Nov. 2 (UP).â€”Major
league club owners today rushed
baseball's "bargain counters" and
selected 20 players from the minors
at the annual draft meeting.
The total of players selected was
one of the highest in recent years
; and the heavy draft of diamond
talent was traceable directly to the
reduction military service calls
have made on club rosters.
