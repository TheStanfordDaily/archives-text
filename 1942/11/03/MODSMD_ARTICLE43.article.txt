# Naval Air Team Beats Papeese
## 
### 
With their big game just a few
days off, Fritz Wilcox's freshman
football team reported to practice
today after playing what was prob
ably their best game of the season
last Saturday in going down to a
20-13 defeat to the Naval Air Sta
tion at San Diego.
The frosh played against a much j
heavier team, and a squad of men j
than had much more experience. The
Bluejacket halfback, Special De- 1
livery Jones, for example, was the !
one that ran 98 yards for Pittsburgh 1
last year against Fordham, to knock
the Rams out of national contention.
Jones is exceptionally fast and shifty,
and oftentimes, being caught behind j
the line of scrimmage, would reverse !
his field for yardage.
OTHER STARS
Navy fullback Presto Johnson |
hails from Southern Methodist Uni- j
I versity, and was known as the best '
! kicker in the South. Quarterback A1 J
i Braga, formerly of U.S.F., has an i
87-yard kick to his credit at Kezar
j Stadium, but did very little of the
| kicking, leaving it to the talented |
| Johnson. Amby Schindler, formerly I
of U.S.C., did not play.
The next opponent for the frosh,
the California Freshman, beat the
St. Mary's Pre-Flight B Team Sat
urday, 6-0. The fliers hold a 13-6
win over the Cardinal babes.
PASSES ACCURATE
Quarterbacks Jack Brownson and
Jay McKie were throwing passes
with accuracy against the Navy. In
the first drive to a score, Brownson
tossed one for 12 yards to Mark Hef
felfinger, who was stopped on the
2-yard line. In the last quarter
Brownson threw from his own 15
to Morriman on the 35. who snake
hipped two would-be-tacklers, and
then outran the other defenders for
the score.
Game Captain Steve Tish played
exceptional ball in the backfield. On
the 65 yard first quarter drive, every
time he carried the ball he was good
for about 10 yards. He also looked
good on defense, as did linemen Dick
Madigan. Bill Hachten, and Ed Gun
derson.

With their big game just a few
days off, Fritz Wilcox's freshman
football team reported to practice
today after playing what was prob
ably their best game of the season
last Saturday in going down to a
20-13 defeat to the Naval Air Sta
tion at San Diego.
The frosh played against a much j
heavier team, and a squad of men j
than had much more experience. The
Bluejacket halfback, Special De- 1
livery Jones, for example, was the !
one that ran 98 yards for Pittsburgh 1
last year against Fordham, to knock
the Rams out of national contention.
Jones is exceptionally fast and shifty,
and oftentimes, being caught behind j
the line of scrimmage, would reverse !
his field for yardage.
OTHER STARS
Navy fullback Presto Johnson |
hails from Southern Methodist Uni- j
I versity, and was known as the best '
! kicker in the South. Quarterback A1 J
i Braga, formerly of U.S.F., has an i
87-yard kick to his credit at Kezar
j Stadium, but did very little of the
| kicking, leaving it to the talented |
| Johnson. Amby Schindler, formerly I
of U.S.C., did not play.
The next opponent for the frosh,
the California Freshman, beat the
St. Mary's Pre-Flight B Team Sat
urday, 6-0. The fliers hold a 13-6
win over the Cardinal babes.
PASSES ACCURATE
Quarterbacks Jack Brownson and
Jay McKie were throwing passes
with accuracy against the Navy. In
the first drive to a score, Brownson
tossed one for 12 yards to Mark Hef
felfinger, who was stopped on the
2-yard line. In the last quarter
Brownson threw from his own 15
to Morriman on the 35. who snake
hipped two would-be-tacklers, and
then outran the other defenders for
the score.
Game Captain Steve Tish played
exceptional ball in the backfield. On
the 65 yard first quarter drive, every
time he carried the ball he was good
for about 10 yards. He also looked
good on defense, as did linemen Dick
Madigan. Bill Hachten, and Ed Gun
derson.
