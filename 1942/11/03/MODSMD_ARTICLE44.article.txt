# Soph Bill Young To Hold Down Right Guard Berth Saturday
## 
### 
I
The right guard link in Stan
ord's forward wall will be filled
ay sophomore Hill Young next Sat
jrday against Washington with the ;
announcement yesterday that Lo- ,
ren LaPrade, defensive signal caller
and first stringer, would be out for I
at least a week with a wrenched !
knee.
LaPrade sustained his first in- !
jury of the year by pure accident
when his cleats stuck in the turf
as he pivoted sharply during the
U.C.L.A. game in Los Angeles.
Young, a sophomore, played most
of the second half when LaPrade j
wrenched his knee in the first pe
riod.
FAWCETT DUE BACK
Buck Fawcett watched yesterday's I
light passing workout in street ,
clothes but is expected to return
to practice this afternoon. Fawcett ;
played little more than five min- |
utes against the Bruins, his pain- !
ful ankle injury pulling him to the
sidelines after two separate at
tempts to remain on the field. |
While in, Buck carried the ball for |
two nice gains and helped set up 1
the Indians' only score of the after- j
noon after recovery of a Bruin
fumble on the opening kickoff.
DANA PRACTICES
Coach Mai'ehie Schwartz gave !
the regulars the day off yesterday, j
with all remaining out of practice
excepting Ross Dana.
Perhaps planning a passing dis- ;
play of his own for the Huskies,
Schwartz had Mark Caffall and
Bob Frisbee passing to a long string
of ends and backs.
Bobby Andrews, second - flight
quarterback, was in suit bul nurs
ing a sprained thumb which will
keep him off the firing line for a
couple of days.
Stanford now stands fourth in the
Pacific Coast Conference standings
, with the Huskies holding third
! place and a mathematical chance
at the Rose Bowl. Washington has
three wins and a loss to its credit
and could make the Bowl with a
J victory over U.C'.L.A., now atop
| the Conference with three wins and
i no losses.
