(Editor's Note: Because of the tremendous
flew ot Campus Opinion letters concerning
Christmas vacation and other vital issues, The
Daily is devoting both of the editorial columns
to Campus Opinion today.)

The Editor, Sir:
I was shocked and then angry at the discov
ery of the plan for no vacations, either Thanks
giving or Christmas, set forth in Friday's Daily.
The loss of Thanksgiving is relatively unimpor
tant compared to the loss of Christmas, for I,
being in the Air Force, and so many other stu
dents of this University are going to be called
in the very near future, and as this Christmas
will be my last at home with my family just as
every soldier's leave will be his last Christmas
with his dear ones, I feel that to deprive me of
the holidays is a crime.
Certainly the administration does not feel that
it will be able to have five quarters a year. Cer
tainly, the administration does not feel that by
adding a few days at school the national War
Effort will be aided and abetted. Certainly, the
administration can have no obections if the
movement of students complies with the mili
tary regulations issued by the Army concerning
troop movements at Christmas — little or no
travel between Dec. 15 and Jan. 15. Certainly,
the extra days can be made up at a later date!
Then, I ask, "Why can't I go home for perhaps
my last Christmas?" I ask the administration,
"Why?"
Interested

The Editor, Sir:
I know that The Daily is not in any way re
sponsible for the action by the committee on
the Christmas recess; but this is the best me
dium of expressing my opinion and, I believe,
that of quite a number of students.
If the proposal of the committee is accepted,
it will mean that it will be some time before
some students get home. These students, and
there is quite a number, live close enough to
get home for a normal Christmas vacation but
far enough to make week-end trips home out
of the question. Naturally such students look
forward to vacations between quarters. They
particularly look forward to Christmas.
I realize this is war: but surely there is a less
drastic solution to this distressing problem. I
am sure it can be found.

The Editor, Sir:
To us, a pair of perhaps ignorant seniors, it
seems that there has been quite a wave of
pseudo-patriotic loose thinking. We feel that the
Powers, in their commendable anxiety to aid
the War Effort in any possible way, have lost
sight of the basic problem, which seems to be
that students going home for Christmas will
overcrowd the already rushed transportation
systems.
We have yet to see any really valid reason
for shortening the Christmas vacation, except
the lost time involved in any vacation whatever.
The great majority of students live in California;
these students will undoubtedly go home for
Christmas, no matter how short a vacation we
have. We believe they will do this even if they
are unable to get reservations on a raiload—
there are always busses, private cars, and the
thumb. The right to be with his family on
Christmas Day is a privilege that no student will
lightly cast aside.
We feel that the solution offered by the rail
roads in their letter is the soundest of all. They
plan to throw the college rush entirely outside
the dates of the normal Christmas rush. If the
University canceled the spring vacation and
three out of the four days of the Thanksgiving
vacation, they could come within a week of
making up the lost time involved. By returning

the students on the eighth or tenth of January,
they could make it all up, and still accomplish
the railroads' purpose.
We feel that the Christmas vacation is by far
the hardest to dispense with. To many out-of
state students, it is the only time until next Sep
tember that they will be able to go home any
way. To men students the possibility that this
may be the last Christmas at home anyway
looms very large. We feel that those unable to
go home anyway have always been able to find
housing and recreation in the past during vaca
tions, and can still do so.
We feel that there are limits to the intensive
ness of any training program, and that we
should not be "carried away" with any such
drastic scheme.

The Editor, Sir:
I am much surprised and bewildered at the
idea of even considering no vacation for the
Christmas holiday. I can well understand that
transportation after the fifteenth of December
will be difficult for students but this can be so
well remedied by letting school out before the
fifteenth and making this possible by the can
cellation of Thanksgiving.
Instead of commencing on the fourth of Janu
ary the school could so easily begin the tenth
or fifteenth and make it possible by doing awav
with the spring vacation. It seems to me that
Christmas is much more important a vacation
than spring. In fact so few of us boys will be
back after the winter quarter that a spring vaca
tion will mean nothing at all to us. It may sound
selfish but none the less it is true, that as it is
the last Christmas for many soldiers, it is the
last Christmas too for many of us students.
If it meant that to take a vacation at Stanford
kept soldiers from going home, I would be the
first to advocate doing away with vacation, but
since it can so well be taken care of and since,
too, it will mean a great deal for those boys
facing active duty soon, I see no reason to
cancel entirely the Christmas holidays.

The Editor, Sir:
Why doesn't this school wake up to the fact
that there is a war going on? The Army lately
proclaimed that 12 a.m. Sunday would be the
day on which the new dim-out would become
effective. At 1 a.m. on that Sunday, I happened
to see several lights plainly visible on the cam
pus. This place even now seems to be a beacon
in the darkness. The A.S.S.U. offices are the
worst offenders. Encina Hall runs a close sec
ond. I will say that the conditions in Encina Hall
have improved lately, but there is plenty of
room for improvement.
The street lights on the campus have not been
painted over as they should have been before
Sunday. The only one on the campus that
would come near the requirements of the Army
would be the one in front of the Hoover War
Libe.
I don't see why the school can't wake up and
do something before the Army moves in a
clamp-down. I would personally favor very
strict enforcement of the proclamation, and I
hope that someone will hand the penalty pro
vided by law for the violation of the dim-out
regulations. This place doesn't seem to care
about the defense and protection of the civilian
population.
I would rather take my chances in a ditch in
one of the nearby fields than remain around this
place during a bombing. Most people seem to
think that we won't be bombed; there is always
a possibility. It is much better to be prepared
for any such emergency than to wait until the
emergency arises. Let's try and get off the dime
around here and BE PREPARED!!!!!
Worried

The Editor, Sir:
In regards to the article on "Christinas and Stan
ford'' 1 thought I might add my little piece. Most
of the students who live outside the state of Cali
fornia or even within the state are already applying
for train reservations and meeting with some suc
cess. I hey want to geL home not just to have some
fun l»ul to talk over with their parents things con
cerning their enlistment in reserves, etc.
I his to me is just as vital as the days which we
would he studying in case there were no vacation.
If we were not to go home at Christmas, the next
time our folks would see us might very well he
after we were in the army and had been given one
week before actual training commenced. Thus one
of the main purposes for seeing "Mother and Dad"
would be done away with.
We all know very well the acule transportation
problem which confronts us and above all we do
not want to appear undemocratic in our wants,
but I do believe if there is no Christinas vacation
some consideration should he given to those indi
viduals who simply have to gel home. Those who
get an opportunity to leave should not have to
worry about the school missed, for they are con
scientiously trying to better themselves for the
needs of our armed forces.
Above all this problem should he solved imme
diately one way or the other, for the days which
everyone argues take up valuable time which could
be used for communication with our folks on this
subject.
Sincerely.
Jack Dietrich.
