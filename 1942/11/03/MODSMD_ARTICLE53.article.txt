# Farm Financial Report Shows $28,614 Surplus for 1941-42
## 
### 
Although the 1941-42 budget of
Stanford University indicated an
operating deficit of $129,000, the
University ended the fiscal year on
Aug. 31 with an excess of $28,614 of
income over expenditures, according
to preliminary unaudited figures re
ported by Frank F. Walker, finan
cial vice-president, to the trustees.
Mr. Walker said that Stanford was
able to overcome the deficit through
a combination of economies in op
eration of the University and
through somewhat better than anti
cipated earnings on the endowment.
At the end of the fiscal year, an
amount of $62,000 actually remained
in excess of budget expenditures,
but unusual expenditures, not fore
seen when the budget was adopted,
reduced the net surplus to $28,614.
These unanticipated expenditures
include construction work in the
School of Humanities and the Regis
trar's Office, road repairs, and an
unbudgetted amount for the Civilian
Defense Council.
DEFENSE BILLS
"Considerable expenses were nec
essitated in connection with the Ci
vilian Defense Council for such
matters as the preparation of air raid
shelters, installation of emergency
telephones, sirens, and the employ
ment of personnel to operate the
Control Center. Expenditures for
this account during the past fiscal
year totalled $22,000," Mr. Walker
said.
As a result of certain operating
controls the University has been able
to save sufficient funds in the past
two years to provide costs of unusual
road construction, as well as im
provement expenditures in Encina
Hall and in Stanford University
Hospitals in San Francisco.
"During the past two years certain
improvements have been made in the
Stanford and Lane Hospitals, includ
ing the renovation of the laundry
and the installation of new equip
ment, the installation of a large
amount of new floor covering, con
siderable painting, and the construc
tion of a new maternity ward."

Operation savings, the financial
vice-president said, have also per
mitted the re-roofing of the domestic
water reservoir on the campus, the
reconstruction of the political sci
ence department quarters, and other
minor matters to be repaired.
OTHER SAVINGS
"While operating results for the
past fiscal year were better than an
ticipated, uncertainties of the present
and future as a result of the war in
dicate that extreme care and re
sourcefulness will be required," Mr.
Walker said.
"Costs of operation have increased
substantially since the entrance of
this country into the war for such
matters as war risk insurance, heat
ing cost, goods and material costs,
and wages."
