# Rooney Stars On Eton Field
## 
### 
"A YANK AT ETON," now playing
at the Stanford Theater, starring
Mickey Rooney.
In short, this picture, the latest
of the "Yank doing something in
England" series, uses the same old
plot, the same old Rooney, plus
some beautiful shots of Eton proper,
in an attempt at subtle Anglo-
American flag waving.
In only one sequence is this flag
waving odious, but even this one
transparent effort was enough to
cause a majority of patrons to wrig
gle in their seats.
The plot is simple. Mickey wants
to go to Notre Dame, but finds that
his widowed mother has married
an Englishman. Mickey and sister
go to England and start out to hate
step-father. Sister is converted
quickly, but Mickey holds out for
a time. Mickey is maneuvered into
going to Eton for six months. Mick
ey hates Eton and particularly the
top hats (can't blame him either),
but in the end gets the old United
Nations spirit and covers himself
with glory on the "playing fields of
Eton."
But my date liked the pictureâ€”
she's English.
The second feature. "Calling Dr.
Gillespie," is a converted "Dr. Kil
dare" film using newcomer Philip
Dorn in the spot formerly occupied
by Lew "Dr. Kildare" Ayres.
Lionel Barrymore is his usual
testy Gillespien self, Philip Dorn
is medically but not romantically
convincing, and Nat Pendleton
faints twice with elephantine grace.
