# WARREN WINS; NO. 1 'YES' LEADING
## 
### 
Republican Attorney General Earl Warren was
elected Governor of California early this morning
over incumbent Democrat Culbert L. Olson.
Warren took an early lead in the first returns
and gradually increased it as heavier reports
began to pour in from all over the state. At 1 a.m.
this morning he had 494,083 votes to Olson's 386,-
755 from more than 8,000 of California's 14,494
precincts.
It appeared probable that Warren would top
Olson in almost every one of the state's 58 coun
ties, including Olson's home county of Los An
geles, a two-to-one Democratic stronghold.
Olson conceded his defeat shortly before mid
night, although Warren issued a victory statement
almost two hours earlier. In his statement Warren

pledged support of the Roosevelt administration
furthering the war effort, and promised non-parti
san representation in his government.
From the executive mansion in Sacramento, Ol
son said:
"I am not unhappy over this result from the
stand point of my own personal well-being. But
I naturally regret this Republican party victory
and the defeat of the democratic principles and
policies which my record as Governor presents."
A phenomenally close race developed in the
contest for Lieutenant Governor with Republican
Fred Houser leading incumbent Democrat Ellis
Patterson by only 41 votes at 1 a.m. this morning
with more than half of the precincts reported.
Houser's total was 387,873 to Patterson's 387,832.

Also too close for prediction was the vote on
the "hot cargo" proposition No. 1 which would
outlaw for the duration organized boycotting of
goods because of labor disputes. With more than
8,000 precincts reporting, there were 149,984 votes
favoring the measure, "Yes," and 129,740 votes
against it.
Organized labor fought the "hot cargo" meas
ure, which was passed by 1941 legislature over
Governor Olson's veto. The AFL State Federation
of Labor secured enough signatures to force a
referendum on the labor measure. Labor charged
the act was unconstitutional and abridged rights
of labor unions, while proponents of the act al
leged labor was hurting the war effort with strikes.
Democrat Robert Kenny was apparently elected

Attorney General after a close race with Republi
can Ware. Kenny was graduated from Stanford
in 1920, and was Daily editor here.
In a radio address early this morning, Kenny
said he would set up several special services in
the Attorney General's office to aid newly elected
Governor Warren and to facilitate California's role
in the war effort.
Another Stanford graduate, Will Rogers, Jr., ap
peared to have lost his campaign against Republi
can Leland M. Ford for Congress in the 16th Dis
trict. Democrat Rogers was in the Army and his
friends conducted the campaign for him.
In the other state congressional contacts, Repub
licans held a slight lead, indicating that they will
probably control California's 23-member delega

tion in Congress.
In Santa Clara County, William Emig was lead
ing Lloyd Skeels in a close race for the position of
county sheriff. According to latest reports from
San Jose, Emig had 2,043 votes to Skeels' 1,826
votes.
California had been solidly Republican since
the days of Governor James "Buckboard Jim" Budd
in 1894, until Olson was elected four years ago.
Only once in California history has any Governor
been re-elected to office.
The chief issue in Warren's campaign was criti
cism of Olson's state defense policies and con
stant bickering with the state legislature.
At press time, the race for Secretary of State was
not decided, although Jordan led in early returns.

Democrat Robert Kenny was apparently elected

Attorney General after a close race with Republi
can Ware. Kenny was graduated from Stanford
in 1920, and was Daily editor here.
In a radio address early this morning, Kenny
said he would set up several special services in
the Attorney General's office to aid newly elected
Governor Warren and to facilitate California's role
in the war effort.
Another Stanford graduate, Will Rogers, Jr., ap
peared to have lost his campaign against Republi
can Leland M. Ford for Congress in the 16th Dis
trict. Democrat Rogers was in the Army and his
friends conducted the campaign for him.
In the other state congressional contacts, Repub
licans held a slight lead, indicating that they will
probably control California's 23-member delega

tion in Congress.
In Santa Clara County, William Emig was lead
ing Lloyd Skeels in a close race for the position of
county sheriff. According to latest reports from
San Jose, Emig had 2,043 votes to Skeels' 1,826
votes.
California had been solidly Republican since
the days of Governor James "Buckboard Jim" Budd
in 1894, until Olson was elected four years ago.
Only once in California history has any Governor
been re-elected to office.
The chief issue in Warren's campaign was criti
cism of Olson's state defense policies and con
stant bickering with the state legislature.
At press time, the race for Secretary of State was
not decided, although Jordan led in early returns.
Republican Attorney General Earl Warren was
elected Governor of California early this morning
over incumbent Democrat Culbert L. Olson.
Warren took an early lead in the first returns
and gradually increased it as heavier reports
began to pour in from all over the state. At 1 a.m.
this morning he had 494,083 votes to Olson's 386,-
755 from more than 8,000 of California's 14,494
precincts.
It appeared probable that Warren would top
Olson in almost every one of the state's 58 coun
ties, including Olson's home county of Los An
geles, a two-to-one Democratic stronghold.
Olson conceded his defeat shortly before mid
night, although Warren issued a victory statement
almost two hours earlier. In his statement Warren

pledged support of the Roosevelt administration
furthering the war effort, and promised non-parti
san representation in his government.
From the executive mansion in Sacramento, Ol
son said:
"I am not unhappy over this result from the
stand point of my own personal well-being. But
I naturally regret this Republican party victory
and the defeat of the democratic principles and
policies which my record as Governor presents."
A phenomenally close race developed in the
contest for Lieutenant Governor with Republican
Fred Houser leading incumbent Democrat Ellis
Patterson by only 41 votes at 1 a.m. this morning
with more than half of the precincts reported.
Houser's total was 387,873 to Patterson's 387,832.

Also too close for prediction was the vote on
the "hot cargo" proposition No. 1 which would
outlaw for the duration organized boycotting of
goods because of labor disputes. With more than
8,000 precincts reporting, there were 149,984 votes
favoring the measure, "Yes," and 129,740 votes
against it.
Organized labor fought the "hot cargo" meas
ure, which was passed by 1941 legislature over
Governor Olson's veto. The AFL State Federation
of Labor secured enough signatures to force a
referendum on the labor measure. Labor charged
the act was unconstitutional and abridged rights

ties, including Olson's home county of Los An
geles, a two-to-one Democratic stronghold.
Olson conceded his defeat shortly before mid
night, although Warren issued a victory statement
almost two hours earlier. In his statement Warren

pledged support of the Roosevelt administration
furthering the war effort, and promised non-parti
san representation in his government.
From the executive mansion in Sacramento, Ol
son said:
"I am not unhappy over this result from the
stand point of my own personal well-being. But
I naturally regret this Republican party victory
and the defeat of the democratic principles and
policies which my record as Governor presents."
A phenomenally close race developed in the
contest for Lieutenant Governor with Republican
Fred Houser leading incumbent Democrat Ellis
Patterson by only 41 votes at 1 a.m. this morning
with more than half of the precincts reported.
Houser's total was 387,873 to Patterson's 387,832.

Also too close for prediction was the vote on
the "hot cargo" proposition No. 1 which would
outlaw for the duration organized boycotting of
goods because of labor disputes. With more than
8,000 precincts reporting, there were 149,984 votes
favoring the measure, "Yes," and 129,740 votes
against it.
Organized labor fought the "hot cargo" meas
ure, which was passed by 1941 legislature over
Governor Olson's veto. The AFL State Federation
of Labor secured enough signatures to force a
referendum on the labor measure. Labor charged
the act was unconstitutional and abridged rights
of labor unions, while proponents of the act al
leged labor was hurting the war effort with strikes.
Democrat Robert Kenny was apparently elected

Attorney General after a close race with Republi
can Ware. Kenny was graduated from Stanford
in 1920, and was Daily editor here.
In a radio address early this morning, Kenny
said he would set up several special services in
the Attorney General's office to aid newly elected
Governor Warren and to facilitate California's role
in the war effort.
Another Stanford graduate, Will Rogers, Jr., ap
peared to have lost his campaign against Republi
can Leland M. Ford for Congress in the 16th Dis
trict. Democrat Rogers was in the Army and his
friends conducted the campaign for him.
In the other state congressional contacts, Repub
licans held a slight lead, indicating that they will
probably control California's 23-member delega

tion in Congress.
In Santa Clara County, William Emig was lead
ing Lloyd Skeels in a close race for the position of
county sheriff. According to latest reports from
San Jose, Emig had 2,043 votes to Skeels' 1,826
votes.
California had been solidly Republican since
the days of Governor James "Buckboard Jim" Budd
in 1894, until Olson was elected four years ago.
Only once in California history has any Governor
been re-elected to office.
The chief issue in Warren's campaign was criti
cism of Olson's state defense policies and con
stant bickering with the state legislature.
At press time, the race for Secretary of State was
not decided, although Jordan led in early returns.
