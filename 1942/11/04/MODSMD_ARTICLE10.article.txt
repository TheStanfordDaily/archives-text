DRIVE TIIEME
The theme of the drive is simple:

i pus activities as thoroughly typical
Stanford students only a year ago.
Today in their new jobs they should
be supported, not only as service
men in general, but as Stanford men
in particular.

representatives in the Nitery, Mon
day afternoon, the system for com
puting house and hall totals was
revised. Stamp sales will go on a
weekly basis, and contributions from
the various sources will not be com
puted or published until the end of
the week.
GOAL STILL lIIGII
This docs not change the signifi
cance of Wednesday as Stamp Day,
sponsors emphasized. The goal is
still one stamp from every Stanford
resident on Wednesday when Quad
booths and special house campaigns
will be made. But contributions will
now be accepted on any day.
Later in the quarter, Stanford stu
dents will be given an opportunity
to support other branches of the
service which have taken Stanford
