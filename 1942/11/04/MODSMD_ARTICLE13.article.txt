# Japs Pour Reinforcements Into Solomons on U.S. Flank

### 
\Y ASIIINGTON, Nov. II (U.R)—The Japanese have landed reinforcements
to the east of American positions on Guadalcanal while Marines and Army
troops, supported by bombarding destroyers and dive bombers, continue
The announcement came a few hours after Navy Secretary Frank Knox
their offensive against the enemy to the west, the Navy disclosed today

warned "We haven't any doubt
(the Japs) will come back" despite 1
the American success in the first
round of the battle of the Solomons
last week. He said both sides were
taking advantage of the current lull
to "strengthen their lines for what
will come."
LANDED FROM EAST
There was no indication of the
strength of enemy reinforcements,
but the fact the Japs had landed east
of Henderson Field represented a
peril from a new direction.
Hitherto, Jap thrusts have been
limited to the west and south —all
of which were repulsed.
The new landings appeared to bear
out another warning by Knox—that
"There is no warrant for optimism"
in the Guadalcanal situation despite
last week's withdrawal of a big Jap
invasion armada and the current
small-scale air-land offensive which
forced enemy troops to retreat
slowly from the western approaches
to Henderson airdrome.
HARD FIGHTING AHEAD
Knox told a press conference the
laps still have a formidable fleet to
th row back at the Solomons and that
"desperately hard fighting" lies
ahead.
