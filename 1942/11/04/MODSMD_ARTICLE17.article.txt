# Wilbur Hits 18-Year-Old Draft Bill
## 
### 
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
called the proposed draft of 18 and
19-year-olds a "national disgrace,"
before a meeting of Stanford alumni
in New York last Monday.
He added that there had been a
10 per cent reduction in Stanford's
student body and if the bill draft
ing 'teen-age "children" passed,
there would probably be no enroll- j
ment at all for the summer semes- j
ter.
Nevertheless, last week's Time re
ports that leaders of the American
Council on Education applauded
Congress' lowering the draft age to
18, deciding that any policy was
better than no policy. These edu
cators were determined, however,
to keep control of their universities,
despite efforts on part of the Army
and Navy to take over colleges, pick
the studefits, prescribe their courses
and eliminate everything from the
curriculum but technical and essen
tial professional studies.
The educators agreed to let mili
tary authorities and colleges jointly
to pick from the nation's ablest
high school graduates members of
an Enlisted Training Corps. Under
this plan, students would be allowed
to choose their own college and re
ceive one and a half years of basic
officer training. No definite action
has been taken along this line.
In protesting the lowered draft
age, Wilbur asked "where will we
get our engineers, and doctors for
the winning of this most technical
war? Why haven't there been dele
[ gat ions to Washington to protest this
i taking of our youth?"
