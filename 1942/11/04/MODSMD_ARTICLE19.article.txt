CAIRO, Nov. 15 (U.R)—Allied tanks
have rammed a spearhead through
(he Axis minefields in Egypt and
swept 17 miles into open country
where they are fighting a showdown
battle with the Nazi Afrika Korps,

The fighting is concentrated in the
scrubby desert between El Aqqaqir
Ridge, 17 miles due west of Alamein
station, original anchor of the Egyp
tian line, and Bir Abur Gubeir, three
miles to the north and slightly west
of the ridge, the dispatches said.
BEHIND FORTIEICATIONS
The area is well beyond the Axis
fortifications in depth, it was report
ed, and with the Imperial Eighth
Army challenging Field Marshal
Erwin Rommel's tanks in open coun
try for the first time in this cam
paign, a new phase of the battle be
gins in which decisive results may
be achieved within days or hours.
Climaxing a 10-day drive, pains
taking at first as the imperials groped
through the minefields, the Allies
finally burst into the open desert
where it was tank against tank and
gun against gun and swept straight
west to El Aqqaqir.
EXPAND SALIENT
Then, expanding their salient, they
moved toward Bir Abu Gubeir and
the Afrika Korps met them in a
swirling battle.
A number of enemy tanks wore
knocked out and many prisoners
were taken in the new advance, *
British communique said, "and heavy
fighting continues."
