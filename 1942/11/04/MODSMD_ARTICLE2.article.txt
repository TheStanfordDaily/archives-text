# Farm Faces Air Disaster Tonight at 7
## Ten Raid Incidents To Confront Civilian Defense Workers 
### 
Stanford will hold its first dis- j
aster test drill since Spring Quarter j
tonight at 7 p.m. when more than
300 members of the civilian defense ;
organization move to combat simu- j
lated incidents in one area of the
campus.
Ten incidents—ranging from fires |
and explosions to casualties—will be [
simulated on the campus west of J
Lasuen and north of the Chancellor J
Ray Lyman Wilbur home. This area j
includes all of the main quad, Roble,
Lagunita, women's gym, Carnegie j
Laboratory, Casa Ventura, Sequoia
and the Chemistry building.
At 7 p.m. when the drill begins,
air raid wardens will be informed I
of the simulated incidents in their j
area. The air raid wardens will make j
out their reports, and eommunica- j
tions wardens will telephone the I
control center, the necessary dis- j
aster squads will be dispatched to j
the scene. These squads—first aid, j
auxiliary fire and police—will go j
through the mqtions of treating the
injured and combating the disaster
incidents.
A1 Masters, Civilian Defense ad
ministrator. said the drill is planned I
so that imperfections in the civilian j
defense organization can be brought |
out under actual test. He said that ]
a similar drill will be held in another !
area of the campus next Wednesday i
and in last area on the following j
Wednesday. After separate tests I
have been conducted in each area, I
an all-campus drill will be conduct- i
ed, he said.
