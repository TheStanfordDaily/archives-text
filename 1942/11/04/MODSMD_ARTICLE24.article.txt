# Culbertson Proposes System For International Federation
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Ely Culbertson. whom thousands know as tiie systematizer of contract
bridge, became known to last night's Tuesday Series as an architect—a
conceiver of World Federation.
History records the world federations of scores of idealists, from Grotius
to the Atlantic Charter, but Culbertson last night drew a blueprint of col
lective security which had a

note—practicability.
The plan admittedly lacks perfec
tion, but as Mr. Culbertson puts it,
"It is a Model T that works."
BUT IT WORKS
It is a Model T which can be
cranked into action today by any |
two of the five leading powers, he
declared. Keynote of the world
mechanism is the inalienable sov
ereignty of every nation. The only
limitation on sovereignty is the pro
hibition of war and armament, he
added.
If Germany, as a leading power,
were to consent to the immediate

: operation of the federation, it would
I be obliged to comply to five pro
j visions:
1. To join the world federation
and submit to the world constitu
tion.
2. To disarm completely.
3. To restore all territory not
i German and resettle all expelled
peoples.
4. To restore all loot.
5. To surrender to the world
Supreme Court any decision on
violation of international law.
With the principles of world or
ganization respected, a provisional
world government could be formed
i immediately. The only catch is that
i public opinion today is not en
, lightened to force its adoption. For
this reason, Culbertson said, it would
be a great disaster if Hitler were, by
! some misfortune, to collapse today.
MUSCULAR SYSTEM'
The practicability of Culbertson's
world structure lies in more than
five years of systematic research
from every feasible angle of history,
economics, politics, and psychology.
| It resides in what he terms a "mus-
J cular system.' This he elaborates in
his Quarter Force Principle, which
| encircles the arbitrary global politi
| cal structure with the force of an
j intricate military organization.
It is a problem which intellects
| have pondered over for generations,
I without practical success, and which
defies any serious criticism to date.
Bertram Russell, Albert Einstein and
} others have mulled over Culbert
j son's proposed system and have
found it essentially flawless.
Although Culbertson's fame has
arisen from his popularization of
bridge, the intellectual game has
been only a hobby, a by-product of
a politically scientific mind. He was
[ born in Russia of an American geolo
gist who founded the Grozny oil
fields.
He returned from Russia intending
to become a professor of political
science in a small midwestern col
lege. But then he met the future
Mrs. Culbertson, a bridge authority,
who said, "Ely. there are hundreds
of mediocre political scientists, but
j only one man can create a great
' bridge system."
To avoid danger of contracting
any of the 70 dire diseases, a Mo
hammedan rule of life requires each
of the faithful to begin each meal
! with salt.
