# Biz School Head Discusses Course
## 
### 
Mrs. Wright MacMahon of the
Wright Mac Mason Secretarial School
of Beverly Hills will be at the Presi
dent Hotel in Palo Alto today to give
information to college women who
arc interested in business training.
Appointments may be made by tele
phone.
Women interested should have a
college degree as the school is con
ducted primarily for graduates. The
purpose of the school is to train
women to take executive positions in
the business world as well as to now
aid in the war effort. The emphasis
is on executive training rather than
on stenographic training.
