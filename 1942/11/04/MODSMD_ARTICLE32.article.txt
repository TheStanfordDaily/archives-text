jyi USING:
The British ships that send soc
cer teams to the Farm carry their
own equipment. That shows how a
country follows its national game—
and how . . . Glenn Scobey "Pop"
YVa rner, who coached Stanford to
three Rose Bowl championships in
the years 1924-1932, will speak at
tomorrow's Washington rally. Drop
around to see a man that all foot
ball men know and respect . . . Some
Say "Pop" doesn't advocate the T
formation for any team that doesn't
have what he calls T material. His
idea on the subject, which may be
contrary to the statement, will be
very interesting indeed for those who
go around wishing to change things
around here . . . Thank Gawd the
Huskies have no sensational passer
to speak of, but their running game

is something else again . . . South
ern California has a great chance to
beat UCLA when the two clubs meet
Dec. 12. The Trojans were as bad
against Stanford as Stanford was
against UCLA, no kiddin' . . . Ben
Morrison, smallish and speedy man
who plays any position in the Stan
ford backfield, will be heard from
more next Saturday than usual.
Just a hunch . . . Joe Gordon yester
day was voted most valuable player
in the American League. Gordon
just couldn't do a thing against the
Cardinals. He batted a nifty .095,
was caught out of position on several
fielding plays, and topped off his
poorest Series appearance by being
caught off second in the final game
when the Yanks might have still
won the game . . . (The poll was
taken before the Series) . . . For the
first time this season save the Idaho
game, Harry Borba of the San Fran
cisco Examiner picked Stanford over
UCLA. Boy, there are more reasons
why the Fieds lost that thing . . .
Yours truly collected three for four
with one "passed" out, that one be
ing last Saturday at the Coliseum
. . . Washington will probably be
favored next week. Great, for Stan
ford upset Southern Cal with the
odds 2-1 against them. This time
the Huskies will go in favored about
10-8. Try agin'.
