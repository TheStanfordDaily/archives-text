# Fawcett Out Of Saturday Husky Game
## 
### LATE WILLIAMS 
Injuries continued to plague
Stan f or d's footballers yesterday !
when Coach Marchie Schwartz an- |
; nounced that fullback Fawcett I
I would stay on the sidelines when !
the Indians meet Washington Sat- |
urday. Fawcett's ailing ankle and |
kiif-e will be given one long chance
to heal for the Oregon State game,
which follows the week after.
Bob Frisbee, who played in his
first encounter of the season last
| Saturday, will move into the po
| sition.
Quarterback Ray Hammett will
pilot the team against the Huskies.
AUGUST SHIFTED
Chuck Taylor turned an ankle ;
during yesterday's practice but that j
won't stop Stanford's big left guard.
Hank Norberg carried along a char- j
ley horse left over from the U.C.- j
L.A. game. Both are expected to be \
back in shape by Saturday.
In a surprise move to bolster I
center, soph end Pete August was
shifted to center behind Milt Vu- j
cinich. August handled the pivot |
position when a freshman.
PASSING DRILL
Yesterday's practice was devoted j
mainly to improving the Indians'
sorely weak pass defense. Schwartz
had his backs alternating on offense
and defense, with Hammett, Bob
Andrews, and Mark Caffall doing
most of (he throwing. At the same
time, the line was practicing its
offensive duties on tackling dum
mies. Closing the session, Schwartz
combined his backs and line, and
ran a series of offensive line plays.
NO WATERFIELDING
As far as is known Washington
i will do no Waterfielding. But the
Huskies have Sammy Robinson at
right half who is all that Bob Bar
rett was last season. Barrett was
Bob Eriekson's running mate last
year, but recently joined the coast
guard.
Center Walt Harrison, candidate
for all-American as far as the Hus
kies are concerned, personally halt
ed crashing fullback Joe Day of
Oregon State last week. Harrison
weighs in at 215. His position as
backer-upper will be tough to crack.
At one of the tackles is Bob Fried
man, experenced senior. Another is
Dmitri Tadich. There isn't a hair
J on his head.
RIVALS BAUMGARTNER
Bill Baumgartner of Minnesota is
; rivaled by the Huskies' Arnie Wein
i meister at right end. Weinmeister
! replaced Earl Younglove.
Neil Brooks, the hard-driving
| Washington fullback, was hit hard
! Saturday and had to be helped off
j the field. He may not make the trip
down today from Seattle.
