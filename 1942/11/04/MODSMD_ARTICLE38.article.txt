### 
NEW YORK, Nov. 3 (UP). â€”
Handling his top-weight of 123
pounds with little difficulty, Allen
T. Simmons' Blue Swords romped
to a four length victory in the $10.-
000 Ardsley Handicap at Empire to
day before an election day crowd
of 22,786.
The son of Blue Larkspur, under
Johnny Longden, came with a rush
entering the final furlong to draw
away from his six rivals. He was
timed in 1:44 3-5 for mile and 70
yards over a sloppy track and
earned $8,750.
