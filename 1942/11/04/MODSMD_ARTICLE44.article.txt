# Transport Troubles Threaten
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Nov. 3 (U.R)—Notes
from the football press-boxes:
Transportation problems, which
already have played havoc with the
pre-flight teams' schedules, threaten
more trouble soon . . . one casualty
may be the game between Bernie
Bierman's lowa fliers and Jimmy
Crowley's North Carolina Pre-
Flighters scheduled for Chapel Hill,
N.C., Dec. 12. . . . Details of Wiscon
sin's upset triumph over Ohio State
last Saturday were short-waved to
service men through three Austra
lian, three British, two South Amer
ican, two Alaskan, two Hawaiian,
two Irish and one Iceland station.
NAVY OVER PENN
Navy ranks as a hot tip to topple
Penn this week. . . . Navy lost its
last two starts but went out of its
class in both. .„. . Georgia Tech
won from Navy mainly on the
potent passing of Prokop and Penn
has no one in his class at flipping
the ball. . . . Notre Dame defeated
the Middies in a stubborn battle
played in the mud at Cleveland—
but who isn't losing to Notre Dame
now? . . . Frankie Sinkwich, the
Georgia star who fell on Alabama
in the fourth period last Saturday,
looks like a cinch to cop the Heis
man Trophy this year.
How the Mighty Have Fallen De
partment—Each of last year's three
undefeated, untied major college
teams have been beaten at least
Uvice this season —Duke, Minne
sota and Duquesne.
PIIELAN: 'CHEATED'
Credit the crack of the week to
St. Mary's football coach, Jimmy
Phelan. . . . After Fordham's 7-0
victory over the Gaels at the Polo
Grounds Saturday, Phelan said: "I
think the customers were cheated a
little." The fluent fellow who auc
tioned off the football for $77,000
between halves of the Giants-Steel
ers pro game at the Polo Grounds
4ast Sunday was Carl Waite of
White Plains, N.Y., who played end
and fullback at Rutgers and later
under Lou Little at Georgetown in
the 1920'5. . . . Center Chuck Che
rundolo of the Steelers played 60
minutes against the Giants and has
played all but three minutes of the
Steelers' seven games so far.
THE LEADERS
Only two teams have kept their
goal line uncrossed this season—
Tulsa University and Idaho. South
ern Branch; three teams—Georgia,
Dubuque of lowa and Augustana of
South Dakota — have won seven
games while five others, in addition
to Tulsa, have won six. . ~. St.
Mary's Gaels hint they may not
be back east next year. . . . The
report is that St. Mary's plans an
all-coast schedule.
