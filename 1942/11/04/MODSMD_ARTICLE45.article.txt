# Frosh To Find Cubs Powerful
## 
### ZIP WALT 
When Stanford's Freshman foot
ballers trek to Berkeley to meet the
Bear Cubs next Saturday they are
going to find a team that has a pow
erful reputation.
The California Frosh hold a 6-0
victory over the St. Mary's Pre-
Flight B team, while the latter squad
nipped the Papeese 13-0. It is only
fair to say, however, that a much
different lineup faces the Bears than
the Stanford Frosh. Last week the
Navy Cadets were in scoring posi
tion twice. The California score came
on an intercepted pass.
The Bear season has been good. Its
only loss was to the USC Frosh.
Clint Evans' yearlings opened the
season with a crushing 33-0 win
over the Treasure Island Navy Base.
Then came a 13-7 nosedive to USC,
followed by a 26-7 victory over Min
ter Field Soldiers and last week's
6-0 win over St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
KECKLEY STANDOUT
Paul Keckley, a hard-plunging
fullback, is one of the standouts in
the Cub backfield. He has been the
main sparkplug in all touchdown
marches and is also an excellent
converter.
Archie Wilson, better than average
passer, intercepted a toss against St.
Mary's Pre-Flight B's and went 47
yards for the only score.
In the line, left-end Dave Hirshler
has been a thorn to many a team.
DALPORTO BACK
Returning to the Bear lineup is
Bob Dalporto, halfback, who has
been on the sidelines with a broken
wrist since the first scrimmage.
Newel] Oestrich has been hailed as
the coining star for the Blue and
Gold, but he may find a little diffi
culty with the strong Stanford Frosh
, line. Others who are outstanding
are Loyal Tracy, Carr Rowland, Tom
Fleischman, and Louis Jurkovich.

are Loyal Tracy, Carr Rowland, Tom
Fleischman, and Louis Jurkovich.

When Stanford's Freshman foot
ballers trek to Berkeley to meet the
Bear Cubs next Saturday they are
going to find a team that has a pow
erful reputation.
The California Frosh hold a 6-0
victory over the St. Mary's Pre-
Flight B team, while the latter squad
nipped the Papeese 13-0. It is only
fair to say, however, that a much
different lineup faces the Bears than
the Stanford Frosh. Last week the
Navy Cadets were in scoring posi
tion twice. The California score came
on an intercepted pass.
The Bear season has been good. Its
only loss was to the USC Frosh.
Clint Evans' yearlings opened the
season with a crushing 33-0 win
over the Treasure Island Navy Base.
Then came a 13-7 nosedive to USC,
followed by a 26-7 victory over Min
ter Field Soldiers and last week's
6-0 win over St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
KECKLEY STANDOUT
Paul Keckley, a hard-plunging
fullback, is one of the standouts in
the Cub backfield. He has been the
main sparkplug in all touchdown
marches and is also an excellent
converter.
Archie Wilson, better than average
passer, intercepted a toss against St.
Mary's Pre-Flight B's and went 47
yards for the only score.
In the line, left-end Dave Hirshler
has been a thorn to many a team.
DALPORTO BACK
Returning to the Bear lineup is
Bob Dalporto, halfback, who has
been on the sidelines with a broken
wrist since the first scrimmage.
Newel] Oestrich has been hailed as
the coining star for the Blue and
Gold, but he may find a little diffi
culty with the strong Stanford Frosh
, line. Others who are outstanding
are Loyal Tracy, Carr Rowland, Tom
Fleischman, and Louis Jurkovich.
