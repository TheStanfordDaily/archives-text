# Secret Scrimmage Held at Westwood
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 3 (UP).â€”
Coach Bribe Horrell drew the tra
ditional Tuesday cloak over his Uni
versity of California at Los Ange
les Bruins today, barring the prac
tice from all outside eyes. Reports
from within, however, indicated a
tough scrimmage with emphasis
laid on aerial offense. Bob Water
field and Ev Riddle shared passing
duties, while Vic Smith and A1 Iz
mirian starred in the ball packing
department. Fullback George Phil
lips, recuperating from an injured
knee which has shelved him all
season, began showing signs of his
own power, though he did not par
ticipate in any line-smashing for
mations.
