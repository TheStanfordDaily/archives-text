# Farm Mermen Meet Spartans
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
With its sights set on an unbeaten
season, Stanford's varsity water polo
team takes on the San Jose State
mermen in a return match tonight
at 8 in the Spartan pools.
"We have one of the finest teams
in many years —perhaps the best of
all time," said Coach Ernie Brand
sten who has seen a lot of top-flight
Stanford water polo teams in his
time.
"The men are all good swimmers,
they swim high and ihey know how
to play water polo," continued Coach
Brandsten. "They're able to play a
fast, continually shifting game which
would be impossible for a team
without their ability."
STATIONARY (SAME
Most college teams are forced to
play a fairly stationary type of game
because their men are not experi
enced enough or fast enough to keep
moving throughout the game. A de
fense pattern can almost always be
worked out to stop this sort of game,
he said.
But the Card team this year has
fast men who know water polo
thoroughly and who have enough
endurance to keep up an elastic,
constantly shifting attack. If this
atack can be maintained, no offense
can stop it indelinitely—a man is
bound to break through sooner 01
later, he added.
"If Stanford can keep up the
alert, fast moving offense it has
shown this year," he said, "there is
no. reason why we can't have un
| defeated season."
CASHIN OUT
