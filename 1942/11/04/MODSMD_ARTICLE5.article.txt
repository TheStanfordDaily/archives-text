### 
NEW YORK. Wednesday, Nov. 4 (U.R)—Substantial Republican congres
sional and gubernatorial gains were made Tuesday in the nation's first
war-time general election since 1918. on the basis of incomplete returns
early today, but the GOP effort fell short of winning control of the House

of Representatives. ■*
Control of the Senate was not at \
stake in this general election and the
upper house will remain safely Dem- j
ocratic.
Thomas E. Dewey, the gang bust
er, was elected governor of New
York by a fat margin, the first Re
publican to win that office since i
Nathan L. Miller defeated Alfred E. j
Smith in 1920.
REPUBLICANS LEAD
Outside New York the Republi
cans won a governorship in Con
necticut and were leading in Idaho,
Michigan and California, where
Democrats now hold the office.
Incomplete returns showed Re- |
publicans leading in contests for
Senate seats now held by Democrats
in Colorado, Delaware, lowa, Michi
gan, Nebraska, New Jersey, Okla
homa, South Dakota and West Vir
ginia. Some of these returns were
rather skimpy, notably in Oklahoma, j
and easily could be reversed as the ;
counting proceeds.
But it appeared that the veteran
Independent, Sen. George W. Norris,
had been defeated in Nebraska by i
Kenneth S. Wherry, Republican. !
Foster May, the Democratic candi- j
date in a three-man race, conceded
Wherry's election shortly before mid- j
night.
In Massachusetts, Joseph E. Casey, j
Democrat, was leading Sen. Henry
Cabot Lodge, Republican, on the
basis of incomplete returns.
With counting still going on, Re- j
publicans appeared to be picking up
at the expense of Democrats, four
House seats in Connecticut, two in
Maryland, three in New York, two in
Ohio, two in Pennsylvania and one
each in Delaware, Illinois, Massa
chusetts, Kansas, West Virginia, and
Wisconsin.
Democrats were ahead on the
basis of incomplete counts, for one
House seat now held by a Democrat
in each of the following states: Illi
nois, Indiana, and New Hampshire.
On the basis of the foregoing par
tial returns, there was a net indicated
gain of 16 Republican House seats,
eight Senate seats and four gov
ernorships.
