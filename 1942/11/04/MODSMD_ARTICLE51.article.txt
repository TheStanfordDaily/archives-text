WHERE was Bull Session today? Where was
History? Actually, the omission of both of
these columns yesterday and today was not for
the purpose of conducting a readership survey
of the back page of The Daily. We feel that a
complete, impartial airing of the Christmas vaca
tion question is fair and necessary.
According to a rather loose survey of new
and old students, last Friday's story was one of
the best read The Daily has run for several
years. It created much controversy, and we
have kept the columns open to those who want
to express their views in letter form.
The Daily explained the situation last Friday
and commented upon the various alternatives.
We are sorry that more persons have not voiced
opinions in favor of the proposed plan; it is diffi
cult to believe that there aren't a few persons
on campus who favor it.
We have printed all letters received to date
and shall continue to do so as long as the re
sponse warrants the space. We believe that
many of the authors have suggested many
worthwhile reasons why Christmas vacation
should not be changed.
A final decision will probably be reached
Thursday by the committee which met last
week. That decision will be printed and com
mented upon in Friday's Daily.
Letters are still welcome; keep them coming.
