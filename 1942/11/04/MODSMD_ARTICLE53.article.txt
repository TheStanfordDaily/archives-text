# Responsibility

### 
RESPONSIBILITY is a valuable asset —espe-
cially today when there are fewer persons
able to assume large responsibilities. At Stan
ford most of the fraternity houses have agreed
to help with the beet-cutting project by offering
crews of 10 men each on certain afternoons.
There is a certain amount of labor needed
every day to get the crop out in time; the owner
counts on this amount and expects it because it
has been promised to him. Yesterday at least
two houses fell down on the job and did not ap
pear. If we were positive which houses failed
to co-operate and who was responsible, we
would not hesitate to print names. We are only
sure that several houses shirked their respon
sibilities.
This lack of backbone not only puts a black
mark on the houses that failed—it represents a
loss in energy and time. A large truck has been
hired to take care of transportation; the owner
counts on about 40 boys an afternoon to help
him; so he does not worry about hiring more
men.
All is ready for the students. But what hap
pens? A half-filled truck limps in, and more of
the crop is lost. The farmer then thinks that
Stanford students are not capable of assuming
responsibility.
The point is that if you sign to work and do
not appear, you are doing more harm than not
signing at all. Think before making commit
ments, and then show for work.
