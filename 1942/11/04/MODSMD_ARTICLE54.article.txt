The Editor, Sir:
Apparently the student body of Stanford does
nothing hut drink, dance, wear tuxes, and drive
*12 model cars on their vacations at home. At least
the outside reader of The Daily would gather this
after reading ihe past issues. Such a case probably
applies to a small minority; but does that small
minority warrant the articles that have been appear
ing recently in the Daily?
It is true that men are dying by the hundreds on
lhe battlefronts of the world. It is also true that the
citizenry at home must give up the majority of the
peacetime pleasures and pastimes, but they can't
give up everything. Morale at home has to be up
held as in the Army. We can point out here that
dances and home leaves are not forbidden in the
Army. As a matter of fact they are a most important
factor in keeping up the morale of the soldier.
Doesn't it seem to be a little unreasonable to forbid
students home leaves-
It might be possible to dispense with the trans
portation problem in the following manner: Regu
late the dates on which students would leave for
home, i.e. those living lhe farthest be allowed to
leave the first day and graduate the rest according
to where they have their homes.
Wouldn't it be possible to eliminate all other va
cations except Christmas, including betwecn-quar
ter holidays? I believe that we all would gladly give
up all our other vacations if allowed to spend Christ
mas with our families.
Very truly yours,
G. H. Raines.
The Editor, Sir:
At Encina we lay out our cash,
And expect some half-way good hash.
But for lunch we get a tomato
That's been fried for a minute or so.
Oh yes, they're in season, we know!
A real good lunch
Is the kind you can munch—
Not hang out your tongue in dismay,
And wish that the cook you could slay.
How's for a lunch
That'll carry a punch
And will take away all our woe?
A Gourmand.
The Editor, Sir:
One evening in New York down to lhe Stage
Door Canteen walked the soldier boys, tall, slender
and happy. They drank cokes; and smoked and
stretched. The music played and pretty girls
smiled. Yes. they relaxed too.
Of course on Guadalcanal men were dying.
''I may never see my girl again," the soldier said.
He jumped camp the night before his furlough
commenced. "See her with cocktails, Christmas,
trees and snow."
That day, as on others, airmen crashed and
died.
California played Washington and had a root
ing section of none but service men. The students
couldn't go. The soldiers roared and yelled for
the warriors on the field, lhe game WAS impor
tant, and lhe defenders of America rah-rahed.
* # « «
It is trite, Mr. Steif, to say that it is for these
very pleasures of the body and mind that men are
dying; but no triter than you have been, Mr. Steif.
It is a truism to say that the morale of the fighting
front mirrors the morale of lhe home front.
Mr. Steif. this country has a selective service.
You and we are listed, and the minute our leaders
feel we can do better sen ice elsewhere we believe
no lime will be wasted in moving us.
What we do at Stanford; how we work and play,
is no secret. If this were not approved we hope to
God something will be done about it. If we are
fools because we trust our leaders, at least we are
lhe kind of fools who win wars.
On Friday, Mr. Steif, you appeared to be very
immature.—Three Reservists.
The Editor, Sir:
In the few weeks that I have been at Stanford,
I have learned to love the school, its people, and
its traditions. There are a few things that baffle
me, though, as most freshmen are baffled. They
are, simply: Why don't some of the freshmen
wise up? We have no hazing of frosh, which
fact I appreciate; but the upper classmen have
some traditions that have been handed down
for years which they ask us to observe.
No smoking on the Quad, no cords for frosh,
and removal of caps and singing of the Hvmn
after games. After upper classmen have volun
j teered to be our sponsors, after they have gone
out of their way to show us that the Farm is
"the" place, why don't the frosh shelve their
cords, quit their smoking on the Quad, and be
damned proud when they doff their caps to
sing the Hymn?
A Freshman
The Editor, Sir:

lhe Quad. Liltlc did we realize, until we saw him
burn to a crisp, that lie was on fire, litis has got to

It is trite, Mr. Steif, to say that it is for these
very pleasures of the body and mind that men are
dying; but no triter than you have been, Mr. Steif.
It is a truism to say that the morale of the fighting
front mirrors the morale of lhe home front.
Mr. Steif. this country has a selective service.
You and we are listed, and the minute our leaders
feel we can do better sen ice elsewhere we believe
no lime will be wasted in moving us.
What we do at Stanford; how we work and play,
is no secret. If this were not approved we hope to
God something will be done about it. If we are
fools because we trust our leaders, at least we are
lhe kind of fools who win wars.
On Friday, Mr. Steif, you appeared to be very
immature.—Three Reservists.
The Editor, Sir:
In the few weeks that I have been at Stanford,
I have learned to love the school, its people, and
its traditions. There are a few things that baffle
me, though, as most freshmen are baffled. They
are, simply: Why don't some of the freshmen
wise up? We have no hazing of frosh, which
fact I appreciate; but the upper classmen have
some traditions that have been handed down
for years which they ask us to observe.
No smoking on the Quad, no cords for frosh,
and removal of caps and singing of the Hvmn
after games. After upper classmen have volun
j teered to be our sponsors, after they have gone
out of their way to show us that the Farm is
"the" place, why don't the frosh shelve their
cords, quit their smoking on the Quad, and be
damned proud when they doff their caps to
sing the Hymn?

The Editor, Sir:
Apparently the student body of Stanford does
nothing hut drink, dance, wear tuxes, and drive
*12 model cars on their vacations at home. At least
the outside reader of The Daily would gather this
after reading ihe past issues. Such a case probably
applies to a small minority; but does that small
minority warrant the articles that have been appear
ing recently in the Daily?
It is true that men are dying by the hundreds on
lhe battlefronts of the world. It is also true that the
citizenry at home must give up the majority of the
peacetime pleasures and pastimes, but they can't
give up everything. Morale at home has to be up
held as in the Army. We can point out here that
dances and home leaves are not forbidden in the
Army. As a matter of fact they are a most important
factor in keeping up the morale of the soldier.
Doesn't it seem to be a little unreasonable to forbid
students home leaves-
It might be possible to dispense with the trans
portation problem in the following manner: Regu
late the dates on which students would leave for
home, i.e. those living lhe farthest be allowed to
leave the first day and graduate the rest according
to where they have their homes.
Wouldn't it be possible to eliminate all other va
cations except Christmas, including betwecn-quar
ter holidays? I believe that we all would gladly give
up all our other vacations if allowed to spend Christ
mas with our families.

At Encina we lay out our cash,
And expect some half-way good hash.
But for lunch we get a tomato
That's been fried for a minute or so.
Oh yes, they're in season, we know!
A real good lunch
Is the kind you can munch—
Not hang out your tongue in dismay,
And wish that the cook you could slay.
How's for a lunch
That'll carry a punch
And will take away all our woe?
A Gourmand.

One evening in New York down to lhe Stage
Door Canteen walked the soldier boys, tall, slender
and happy. They drank cokes; and smoked and
stretched. The music played and pretty girls
smiled. Yes. they relaxed too.
Of course on Guadalcanal men were dying.
''I may never see my girl again," the soldier said.
He jumped camp the night before his furlough
commenced. "See her with cocktails, Christmas,
trees and snow."
That day, as on others, airmen crashed and
died.
California played Washington and had a root
ing section of none but service men. The students

peacetime pleasures and pastimes, but they can't
give up everything. Morale at home has to be up
held as in the Army. We can point out here that
dances and home leaves are not forbidden in the
Army. As a matter of fact they are a most important
factor in keeping up the morale of the soldier.
Doesn't it seem to be a little unreasonable to forbid
students home leaves-
It might be possible to dispense with the trans
portation problem in the following manner: Regu
late the dates on which students would leave for
home, i.e. those living lhe farthest be allowed to
leave the first day and graduate the rest according
to where they have their homes.
Wouldn't it be possible to eliminate all other va
cations except Christmas, including betwecn-quar
ter holidays? I believe that we all would gladly give
up all our other vacations if allowed to spend Christ
mas with our families.

At Encina we lay out our cash,
And expect some half-way good hash.
But for lunch we get a tomato
That's been fried for a minute or so.
Oh yes, they're in season, we know!
A real good lunch
Is the kind you can munch—
Not hang out your tongue in dismay,
And wish that the cook you could slay.
How's for a lunch
That'll carry a punch
And will take away all our woe?
A Gourmand.

One evening in New York down to lhe Stage
Door Canteen walked the soldier boys, tall, slender
and happy. They drank cokes; and smoked and
stretched. The music played and pretty girls
smiled. Yes. they relaxed too.
Of course on Guadalcanal men were dying.
''I may never see my girl again," the soldier said.
He jumped camp the night before his furlough
commenced. "See her with cocktails, Christmas,
trees and snow."
That day, as on others, airmen crashed and
died.
California played Washington and had a root
ing section of none but service men. The students
couldn't go. The soldiers roared and yelled for
the warriors on the field, lhe game WAS impor
tant, and lhe defenders of America rah-rahed.

It is trite, Mr. Steif, to say that it is for these
very pleasures of the body and mind that men are
dying; but no triter than you have been, Mr. Steif.
It is a truism to say that the morale of the fighting
front mirrors the morale of lhe home front.
Mr. Steif. this country has a selective service.
You and we are listed, and the minute our leaders
feel we can do better sen ice elsewhere we believe
no lime will be wasted in moving us.
What we do at Stanford; how we work and play,
is no secret. If this were not approved we hope to
God something will be done about it. If we are
fools because we trust our leaders, at least we are
lhe kind of fools who win wars.
On Friday, Mr. Steif, you appeared to be very
immature.—Three Reservists.
The Editor, Sir:
In the few weeks that I have been at Stanford,
I have learned to love the school, its people, and
its traditions. There are a few things that baffle
me, though, as most freshmen are baffled. They
are, simply: Why don't some of the freshmen
wise up? We have no hazing of frosh, which
fact I appreciate; but the upper classmen have
some traditions that have been handed down
for years which they ask us to observe.
No smoking on the Quad, no cords for frosh,
and removal of caps and singing of the Hvmn
after games. After upper classmen have volun
j teered to be our sponsors, after they have gone
out of their way to show us that the Farm is
"the" place, why don't the frosh shelve their
cords, quit their smoking on the Quad, and be
damned proud when they doff their caps to
sing the Hymn?

the outside reader of The Daily would gather this
