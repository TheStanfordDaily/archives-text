# Union Requests Farm Cooperation
## 
### 
Miss Christine Ricker, director of
dining halls and the Stanford Union,
again has asked students to cooperate
in clearing their dishes in the Stan
ford Union.
"We still have a shortage of help
at the Union," said Miss Ricker, "and
we would certainly appreciate it if
students would cooperate in clearing
tables. During the 9 and 10 o'clock
rush hours in the morning we espe
cially ask student cooperation."
The Union is still unable to hire
dishwashers or other full-time help.
Until the help situation can be
cleared up students are asked to co
operate in piling their dishes on the
side stands so the tables can be
cleared for further use.
