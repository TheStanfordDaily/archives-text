# Cardinals Urge 'Get Nitery Habit'
## 
### 
"Get the Nitery Habit," urges
Vernice Hines, Cardinals member.
Dances are held in the Nitery Fri
day and Saturday nights, and with
the emphasis on on-the-campus ac
tivities, they have attracted large
crowds of students.
The Nitery, which is located in the
Old Union Building, is open week
day evenings from 6 p.m. to 10:30,
and students are urged to drop in
for cokes and record playing. Since
the Cellar closes at 8. the Nitery has
become especially popular for aftcr
the-libe relaxation.
