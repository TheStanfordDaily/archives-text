loaned the cast by the quartermas

Searching for realistic costumes
and equipment for the eight soldiers
in the cast. Hazel Brain, head cos
tumor, contacted Sergeant Croll and
Chaplain Mathews at the camp.
"They very generously and graci
ously consented to loan us uniforms,

| packs, cartridge belts and other
items of equipment," she said. "The
; men portraying soldiers simply went
out to the camp and were completely
I outfitted by the quartermaster."
The guests at the dress rehearsal
made sure the cast performed with
military finesse and they commented
on and corrected the manner in
which they handled their equipment,
their precision at drilling, and so on.
"The Eve of St. Mark." Maxwell

Broadway last month and has gained
nationwide approval as a realistic
story of American youth and the

tenderness, and undisguised strife.
