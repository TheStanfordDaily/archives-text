FIJI PURCHASE
Of special note was the Fiji Dur

earned by their sophomore class in
recent cannery work. Alpha Kappa
Lambda sold the highest amount of
stamps, garnering $16.
A complete list of donations by
living groups will be mailed to
members of the "Flying Indian"
squadron next Monday after the
drive closes, sponsors stated. Al
though Wednesday is the official
stamp day, purchases may be made
throughout the rest of the week,
and they will be included in the
final total mailed to the squadron
at Corpus Christi.
Toyon Hall, through eating club
units, contributed $246.50. Sales on
Quad amounted to $564.50. Of the
total, about $300 was in bonds.
Based on estimates of last week,
about $80 can be expected from
