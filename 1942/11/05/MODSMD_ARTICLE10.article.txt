# Student Squads Function Well For 'Air Raid'
## Fire, First Aid Units, Ambulances Rush to Casualties 
### 
Last night's "air raid" resulted in
five casualties, four incendiary fires
and a bomb crater in Lomita drive,
reported Edwin A. Cottrell, acting
supervisor of emergency defense.
Student disaster squads, supple
mented by fire and police depart- |
ments, functioned smoothly, with the
exception of a few minor details.
Chief Warden Dodds reported "high
morale and good spirit" in Casa Ven
tura, which was ripped by a high
explosive.
EVACUATED
The "raid'' began at 7:02, when
Lagunita was completely blacked
out and its residents were exacuated
to basement shelters. The only com
plaint made by Alfred Masters, who
checked efficiency of incident, was
that the girls were "rather slow" but
added that a real bomb would "send
them scampering."
A demolition bomb hit Roble, in
flicting three casualties. Within 10
minutes a warden had arrived with
seven medical aids. An ambulance
for shock and burned arm, and a t a
appeared a few moments later to
transport a girl with a broken leg to
the hospital. Another "victim" was
treated for shock and a burned arm,
and a third was given first aid for
a gashed forehead and an arm wound
by a four-inch splinter.
THREE FIRES
Three fires broke out on the Quad
simultaneously. With axes, buckets
and garden hose, student fire fight
ers were able to extinguish Iwo. But ,
the third, in the Business libe blazed i
out of control and a fire truck was j
called. Within five minutes, it roared
to the scene, rolled out hoses, hoist
ed. ladders and had Ihe fire under
control.
A 20-foot bomb crater on Lomita
drive interfered with a fire truck's
run to a blaze in the Kingscote
Apartments. Repair crew had the
"crater" filled within 10 minutes.
Last night's drill was the first in
a sequence which will be held on
Wednesday nights.
