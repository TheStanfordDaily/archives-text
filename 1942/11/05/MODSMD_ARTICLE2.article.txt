# D.A.R. Wins Tiff With Negro Singer
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 4 (UP).â€”
Marian Anderson, famed Negro con
tralto, today lost her second skir
mish with the Daughters of the
American Revolution.
The Daughters gave not an inch
1o the noted artist, who said she
would sing at their Constitution Hall
provided there was no segregation
of whites and Negroes. Swinging
with a tradition in one hand and a
by-law in the other, the Daughters
notified Miss Anderson, in effect,
that she will sing on their terms or
not at all.
