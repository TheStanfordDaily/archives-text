CAIRO, Nov. 4 (U.R)â€”Axis forces are in full and disorderly retreat ac ross
Egypt before the greatest Allied drive of more than two years of desert
war and the Italians have taken such h heating on one sector that they
have asked for an armistice to hury their dead, it was announced tonight.
There was no indication whether the unprecedented Italian request would
4.be granted.

LOSE THOMPSON'S POST
Late front dispatches said that the
Germans had been "driven" from
Thompson's Post, a strong point they
had held behind the British lines 011
the Coastal sector. It was not imme
diately known whether the 2,500
Germans had broken through and
joined their main retreating forces.
A British communique, revealing
the massive blows the British have
struck in their 12-day offensive, said
that Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's
second in command has been killed
and that Allied land and air forces
are hammering the retreating Axis
forces relentlessly by day and night.
20-MILE CHASE
Earlier front dispatches said the
Allies had shattered Rommel's Egyp
tian defense line and chased his
troops back 20 miles along the coast
al road, attempting to turn his re
treat into panic.
As the Allied forces pushed for
ward seeking to strike a death blow
to the reeling enemy, it was re
vealed officially that 7,000 fresh
American troops have arrived in
Egypt to join the battle.
The Americans, consisting of air
and ground forces, technical units,
more than 100 nurses and a com
pany of military police, arrived Sat
urday after a safe crossing from a
U.S. East Coast port aboard a former
trans-Atlantic liner converted to a
transport, an official announcement
said. Not a life was lost.
2,500 ENEMY TRAPFEI)
Except for a pocket along the
coast, where 2.500 Axis troops were
trapped, not a single enemy remained
east of Abd El Rahman as both ends
and the center of Rommel's line
buckled under Allied air, tank, artil
lery and infantry assaults, the dis
patches said.
As their north wing fled west,
Axis forces holding the center and
south sectors of the 40-mile line
abandoned the strongholds of Den-
El Angar, Menasseb and Hemciniat.
Imperial troops quickly occupied
them.
