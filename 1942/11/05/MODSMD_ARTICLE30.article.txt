# H.G. Wells Movie To Show Sunday
## 
### 
The Ham Howard Hits will feature
"Things to Come" Sunday night at
7:15 in Memorial Hall.
One of the greater successes of H.
G. Wells. "Things to Come," starring
Raymond Massey, is a prophecy of
a future super world after war.
This is the picture for which Miss
Howard has been bargaining ever
since she took over the bi-weekly
Sunday series. "It is a marvelous
movie," she says.
Chapter one of "The Clutching
Hand" and a cartoon will complete
the bill. Admission is 20 cents.
