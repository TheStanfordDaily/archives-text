# 'New' Card Team Girds for Huskies
## 
### 
There'll he a "new" Stanford football team taking the field Saturday as
the Redskins and Huskies tangle at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco. New
because of injuries and new because a shot-in-the-arm pass defense hopes
to make itself heard when the air is filled with the flying tosses of Boh
Erickson and Sammy Robinson, Musky aerial duo, who operate from the
two halfback positions. ♦

Pete August, switched Tuesday
from end to center, was discovered
to be retaining a mild brain con
cussion, aftermath of a hard sock on
the chin last Saturday. August will
probably be out of uniform until the
Oregon State game.
Hank Norberg's shoulder pointer
became painful enough last night to
give the big fellow a respite from
first-string duties. Roger Laverty
moves over from right to left end,
while Bob Hall, who has been out
since the Washington State game,
will move in at right end.
With Loren LaPrade a non-par
ticipant, Harvey Bernhard has been
.shifted from tackle to guard behind
Bill Young, who will occupy the
starting berth. Bill Mannon is now
No. 1 replacement for Milt Vucinich
at center.
In the backfield Art Shipkey goes
in at fullback in place of the in
jured Buck Fawcett, with Bob Fris
bee right behind.
Saturday it's brilliant pass defense
on Stanford's part or else—or else
another game will go the way of
UCLA, a team that Stanford might
have taken into camp with adequate
barriers to a passing offense.
Coach Marehie Schwartz said last
night Washington could be just as
much a passing team as the Bruins.
Schwartz thinks that Walt Harrison,
groomed for all-American by the
Washington tom-tom beaters, is 40
per cent of the Husky defense and
one of the best centers in the busi
ness.

Washington uses much the same
style offense it has in past years un
der Jimmy Phelan. flankers and
power football. Neil Brooks at full
back, 205 pounds, is a hard, driving
runner, according to basketball
Coach Everett Dean and Vic Lind
skog, who scouted last week's Wash
ington game.
Ericksen looms as the triple
threater in the Washington back
field, and while no speed demon,
will nevertheless make plenty of
trouble.

per cent of the Husky defense and
one of the best centers in the busi
ness.

Washington uses much the same
style offense it has in past years un
der Jimmy Phelan. flankers and
power football. Neil Brooks at full
back, 205 pounds, is a hard, driving
runner, according to basketball
Coach Everett Dean and Vic Lind
skog, who scouted last week's Wash
ington game.
Ericksen looms as the triple
threater in the Washington back
field, and while no speed demon,
will nevertheless make plenty of
trouble.


PETE AUGUST
There'll he a "new" Stanford football team taking the field Saturday as
the Redskins and Huskies tangle at Kezar Stadium in San Francisco. New
because of injuries and new because a shot-in-the-arm pass defense hopes
to make itself heard when the air is filled with the flying tosses of Boh
Erickson and Sammy Robinson, Musky aerial duo, who operate from the
two halfback positions. ♦

Pete August, switched Tuesday
from end to center, was discovered
to be retaining a mild brain con
cussion, aftermath of a hard sock on
the chin last Saturday. August will
probably be out of uniform until the
Oregon State game.
Hank Norberg's shoulder pointer
became painful enough last night to
give the big fellow a respite from
first-string duties. Roger Laverty
moves over from right to left end,
while Bob Hall, who has been out
since the Washington State game,
will move in at right end.
With Loren LaPrade a non-par
ticipant, Harvey Bernhard has been
.shifted from tackle to guard behind
Bill Young, who will occupy the
starting berth. Bill Mannon is now
No. 1 replacement for Milt Vucinich
at center.
In the backfield Art Shipkey goes
in at fullback in place of the in
jured Buck Fawcett, with Bob Fris
bee right behind.
Saturday it's brilliant pass defense
on Stanford's part or else—or else
another game will go the way of
UCLA, a team that Stanford might
have taken into camp with adequate
barriers to a passing offense.
Coach Marehie Schwartz said last
night Washington could be just as
much a passing team as the Bruins.
Schwartz thinks that Walt Harrison,
groomed for all-American by the
Washington tom-tom beaters, is 40
per cent of the Husky defense and
one of the best centers in the busi
ness.
