### BOB SONTAG 
JETTING BETTER:
Batting a slam-bang .750 after last week's games, the dept. comes up
against five toughies this week. Last Saturday's goodies included Califor
nia over Oregon by 13 (score: Cal 20-7), Idaho over Montana by 12 (score:
Idaho 20-0), Washington over OSC by 7 (score: Washington 13-0). One
other pick missed the boat.
Take it away, to wit:
STANFORD OVER WASHINGTON BY 1
For two weeks straight we tried the Cards by a single point and were
once rewarded with a 14-6 win over Southern California and were once
stumped by a 20-7 loss to UCLA. Third time's the charm, they always say,
and without Buck Fawcett and Loren LaPrade, don't think the Redskins
will have any easy time with a team just winners over OSC, 13-0. One
point in the home club's favor is that Fred Olson, the Huskies' ace drop
kicker, was left at home last night when Coach Ralph "Pest" Welch's club
entrained for San Francisco. Maybe that'll give the Stanfords that extra
placement point.
use OVER CALIFORNIA BY 7
Southern California is still perhaps the best ball club on the coast despite
its loss to Stanford. If the Trojans pour loose flashy Mickey McCardle with
a few blockers, he'll go through the entire Bear outfit to score. Cal's Jim
Jurkovich is fast approaching all-coast and will be the only man the
Trojans must halt.
UCLA OVER OREGON BY 13
No more than two touchdowns for Babe Horrell's boys. Any club that
can stop Waterfield will stop UCLA, but the Bruins are better all-around,
so they take it by a couple. Tommy Roblin looked good enough against
the Bears last week to score through the Uclan line.
MICHIGAN- STATE OVER VVSC BY 0
The Cougars irk our ire mightily for dropping their game with the Pre-
Flighters of St. Mary's. At any rate, any club east of the Rockies including
Slipery Rock and Whipcord State Dental has a nice chance against Wash
ington State.

point in the home club's favor is that Fred Olson, the Huskies' ace drop
kicker, was left at home last night when Coach Ralph "Pest" Welch's club
entrained for San Francisco. Maybe that'll give the Stanfords that extra
placement point.
use OVER CALIFORNIA BY 7
Southern California is still perhaps the best ball club on the coast despite
its loss to Stanford. If the Trojans pour loose flashy Mickey McCardle with
a few blockers, he'll go through the entire Bear outfit to score. Cal's Jim
Jurkovich is fast approaching all-coast and will be the only man the
Trojans must halt.
UCLA OVER OREGON BY 13
No more than two touchdowns for Babe Horrell's boys. Any club that
can stop Waterfield will stop UCLA, but the Bruins are better all-around,
so they take it by a couple. Tommy Roblin looked good enough against
the Bears last week to score through the Uclan line.
MICHIGAN- STATE OVER VVSC BY 0
The Cougars irk our ire mightily for dropping their game with the Pre-
Flighters of St. Mary's. At any rate, any club east of the Rockies including
Slipery Rock and Whipcord State Dental has a nice chance against Wash
ington State.
JETTING BETTER:
Batting a slam-bang .750 after last week's games, the dept. comes up
against five toughies this week. Last Saturday's goodies included Califor
nia over Oregon by 13 (score: Cal 20-7), Idaho over Montana by 12 (score:
Idaho 20-0), Washington over OSC by 7 (score: Washington 13-0). One
other pick missed the boat.
Take it away, to wit:
STANFORD OVER WASHINGTON BY 1
For two weeks straight we tried the Cards by a single point and were
once rewarded with a 14-6 win over Southern California and were once
stumped by a 20-7 loss to UCLA. Third time's the charm, they always say,
and without Buck Fawcett and Loren LaPrade, don't think the Redskins
will have any easy time with a team just winners over OSC, 13-0. One
point in the home club's favor is that Fred Olson, the Huskies' ace drop
kicker, was left at home last night when Coach Ralph "Pest" Welch's club
entrained for San Francisco. Maybe that'll give the Stanfords that extra
