# 'Pop' Warner Returns For Washington Rally
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
"Pop" Warner comes back to Stanford tonight, nine years after he turned
over Farm football destinies to "Tiny" Thornhiil and started down the hack
stretch of one of America's greatest coaching careers.
As guest speaker at the Washington rally ::t 7::>0 tonight. Glenn Warner
will Ite facing a scene which was an old story in the l!)24-:>2 days when

Stanford to a lot of the outside world
was the "place where Pop Warner
coaches."
In those days he could tell students
about players like Ernie Nevers, the
Shipkey brothersâ€”Ted and Harry,
Walt Heinecke, All-American cen
ter, "Dynamite" Post, and Don Ro
besky. Tonight he may be recalling
the rallies in the years of his three
Rose Bowl teams of 1924, '26. and 27.
LONG RECORD
When he came to Stanford, War
ner had already covered the football
world, coaching, writing, picking
All-American teams, and building
up his knowledge of the game * Stan
ford itself was only four years old
when Warner led his first team at
the University of Georgia in 1895.
Then down through the years at
Cornell Carlisle Indian School
(where he developed the greatest
player of all time, Jim Thorpe) and
the University of Pittsburgh, Warner
built up a record of wins that
brought him to the Farm to replace
Andy Kerr in 1923. His Farm teams
won 71, lost 17, tied 8.
Now 71-year-old Warner lives in
Palo* Alto. I found him yesterday
looking at a new edition of his best
book, "Pop Warner's Book for Boys,"
published in 1934. Somehow this
formed a keynote for the interview,
because Warner's main emphasis in
45 years of coaching has been on the
individual's physical betterment and
upon getting younger boys inter
ested in sports.
SHOULDN'T CRITICIZE
This feeling for students and the
"boys on the team" still exists; as an
example, when Warner was talking
about modern styles of play, he
pointed out that no coach, old time
or otherwise, should ever give inter
views which are critical of team
methods during an actual season.
Nothing can break down a team's
confidence more than hearing its
fundamental style criticized.
Perhaps it wasn't smart to pop
back with a question about Stan
ford's present squad, but that's
! where campus interest lies.
"The present Stanford squad has
! an especially good defensive bal!
club," Warner said, "particularly ir
the line. 'I'm always watching Stan
ford teams and this one is a gooc
one."
Of course it developed that he
thought UCLA was pretty good, too
Over his reign in coaching circles
football technique changed. Ir
blocking and tackling, the funda
mentals which Pop has preachec
first, last, and always, the shift wa:
most noticeable.
THEY ALL HELPED
In the old days, "anyone coulc
j help the ball carrier along from be-
I hind. Flying blocks were used too
and beefier players were even mor<
useful than now." The teams ir
Warner's first day all considered th<
! forward march as a team task, anc
| they moved along as a unit, with th<
j ball carrier being pushed when hi:
| own steam failed.
Two Warner books. "Football fo
j Players and Coaches," published ii
1912, and "Football for Coaches am
Players," published at Stanford ii
| 1927, made fundamental contribu
tions to the faster, more strategic
type of football which evolved it
post war days.
While he talks of these things
I Warner gives the impression of ai

exceptionally keen interest in all
things athletic. But there's another
side to him. He has a law degree
from Cornell, and was admitted to
the New York bar. With his active
football days gone, he paints, fishes,
and works in his shop.
He hasn't been back to Stanford
much. From 1933 to 1938 he coached
at Temple University in Pennsyl
vania. Then he helped Dud DeGroot
at San Jose until 1940. Now and
then he watches a Stanford practice.
So tonight you'll be seeing a man
who knows the inside of football
like few men in the United States.
When that knowledge is added to an
admiration of Stanford that is built
on long service, ''Pop'' Warner looms
as one of the larger milestones in
this school's history.
