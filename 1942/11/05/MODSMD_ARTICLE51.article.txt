# Let Us Be Trained

GREAT BRITAIN has been in the war for
more than two years longer than we have
and has thereby been able to figure out more
sensible ways of drafting men into the armed
forces.
In 1939 there were 50,000 students in British
universities; now there are 37,000. Seventy-eight
per cent of the students were men—22 per cent
women. Now 72 per cent are men and 28 per
cent women—not a sizeable drop considering
the hardships the English have suffered.
This remarkable record can be attributed to
a logical, reasonable approach to the manpower
problem. Men students in non-technical sub
jects are allowed one year's deferment above
the calling-up age—lBV2—provided that they
undertake fairly rigorous military training. Sci
ence and technical students are given defer
ment for two or more years, and medical stu
dents for five years. A "war degree" is granted
by most universities after two years' attendance,
plus satisfactory subseguent national service.
What do we have in this country? College
men can sign with several of the reserves and
assure themselves of deferment for a little
while, but the status of each of these reserves
changes from month to month. There is that
feeling of insecurity on the part of the college
student which is not conducive to good study
ing.
Those who do not sign with a reserve are
practically sure of being called before they are
20. In other words, our system is not as thor
oughly organized as that in England.
In the United States women are not affected
by the draft. Service is voluntary. In England
women at the age of 20 are now subject to con
scription as auxiliaries in the armed forces.
They are normally granted deferment only until
the end fo the academic year in which they
reach their twentieth birthday. They may stay
for one more year if they proceed immediately
after graduation to an approved technical or
higher course.
Both men and women students at teachers'
training colleges receive the same deferments
as for scientists.
Another strong point in favor of the British
efficiency is the fact that all students and staff
members are liable for 12 hours of fire-watching
or other air raid protection work per week. Be
sides the required work, many are known to
have put in heavy additional volunteer duties.
As we are now beginning to do in this coun
try, special courses have been added at the
request of the British government, ranging from
six months to two years, and from radio physics
to Oriental languages, There are also special
short courses in statistics, personnel manage
ment for women, tropical and wartime medicine,
and special preparatory work for students wish
ing to enter the engineers, artillery, signal, or
armored corps.
We are approaching a similar system, but
officials in Washington, as pointed out by Chan
cellor Wilbur last Monday, have to take into
consideration the fact that engineers, techni
cians, and doctors receive their training in the
colleges and universities and should be al
lowed to get as much education as possible.
We can t afford to send out a poorly trained,
badly equipped army; we are fighting a tech
nical war which needs technically trained fight
ing men to win it. Our students should not
be forced into the service without an education
which can carry us to victory.
As Dr. Wilbur said about university students,
"They have courage and vision, and no un
willingness to take part in the war. They only
want the opportunity to be trained for this most
highly technical of all wars."
