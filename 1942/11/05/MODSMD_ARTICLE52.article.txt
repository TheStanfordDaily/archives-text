The election is still big news. But the news
is not as clear as some would make it. There
have been Republican gains; there is still a
possibility (remember, I wrote this last night)
that the Grand Old Party will have a clear
majority of the House. One explanation of the
results is that Americans do not like the way
the war is being run; that their vote is a protest
against the Administration. In some measure
this is true. Jim Farley, who nominated his can
didate but could not elect him, maintains that
there was a Republican trend, that the back
swing confidenlty predicted by every Republi
can since the 1932 election has begun.
There is clearly dissatisfaction about the war,
nothing general, but we aren't winning. It may
not be the Administration's fault, but Hoover
didn't cause the Depression, either. The small
percentage of variable vote changed sides here
and there; Republicans voted with determina
tion; the prosperity of war-time has nullified the
political effect of relief measures, and so on.
In California, there was very definite opposi
tion to Olson, Warren's candidacy and victory
being foreseeable a matter of years ago. Cul
bert L. was never more than a politician, was
elected on a wave of Roosevelt and Thirty-
Thursday enthusiasm, and will not be mourned
very deeply by anyone. In Oklahoma, New
Dealer Josh Lee was defeated. Part of his op
position was the result of his prohibition pro
posal which the Senate smothered a few weeks
ago, and the local politicians provided the rest
by nominating a Democrat on the Republican
ticket, thus splitting Lee's party support. The
re-election of Ham Fish, ornament to the House
that he is, is not to be taken to prove that Duch
ess County is an isolationist stronghold, only
that much as the good people of the Hudson
Valley hate Hitler, they hate neighbor Roosevelt
too. All this is to show that the people of Amer
ica did not unite to reprimand the Administra
tion for its conduct of the war. It was not a
repudiation of what Life calls the Roosevelt
party, but a mild protest combined with a lot
of local politics and the recidivism of some
wandering Republicans.
The election of Thomas Dewey as Governor
of New York poses the guestion whether or
not he can deliver the goods. He was an able
district attorney and may be an able Governor.
If he is, then there is a contender for the Re
publican nomination in 1944.
My thoughts on the election of Clare Boothe
Luce are not printable. She may be a capable
parliamentarian and serve her constituency
well, but, on the other hand, she may serve
only as a sounding-board and pipe-line for the
Luce publications. I don't think there is any
place for a magazine, much less for three, in
the House of Representatives.

A week ago, I announced that the United
Nations were on the offensive. The news from
Egypt is that our offensive is really rolling. It is
early to talk about the complete defeat of the
Afrika Korps, and the Allies may end up in
the Red Sea yet, but so far Rommel is retreating.
In the Solomons, our troops hold their positions
and are slashing at the Japs, while Mac Arthur's
men pour over the mountains toward the Japs'
New Guinea base of Buna. The Germans have
not yet slowed up in Russia, and it may be that
they are willing to give up North Africa if
they think they can force Russia into a separate
peace, a remote possibility, I think.

It is curious to think that there may be a
major reshuffling in Congress, just after Con
gress had started to work in earnest. I refer
particularly to the revenue bill just passed.

parliamentarian and serve her constituency
well, but, on the other hand, she may serve
only as a sounding-board and pipe-line for the
Luce publications. I don't think there is any
place for a magazine, much less for three, in
the House of Representatives.

A week ago, I announced that the United
Nations were on the offensive. The news from
Egypt is that our offensive is really rolling. It is
early to talk about the complete defeat of the
Afrika Korps, and the Allies may end up in
the Red Sea yet, but so far Rommel is retreating.
In the Solomons, our troops hold their positions
and are slashing at the Japs, while Mac Arthur's
men pour over the mountains toward the Japs'
New Guinea base of Buna. The Germans have
not yet slowed up in Russia, and it may be that
they are willing to give up North Africa if
they think they can force Russia into a separate
peace, a remote possibility, I think.

It is curious to think that there may be a
major reshuffling in Congress, just after Con
gress had started to work in earnest. I refer
particularly to the revenue bill just passed.
PENDULUM
The election is still big news. But the news
is not as clear as some would make it. There
have been Republican gains; there is still a
possibility (remember, I wrote this last night)
that the Grand Old Party will have a clear
majority of the House. One explanation of the
results is that Americans do not like the way
the war is being run; that their vote is a protest
against the Administration. In some measure
this is true. Jim Farley, who nominated his can
didate but could not elect him, maintains that
there was a Republican trend, that the back
swing confidenlty predicted by every Republi
can since the 1932 election has begun.
There is clearly dissatisfaction about the war,
nothing general, but we aren't winning. It may
not be the Administration's fault, but Hoover
didn't cause the Depression, either. The small
percentage of variable vote changed sides here
and there; Republicans voted with determina
tion; the prosperity of war-time has nullified the
political effect of relief measures, and so on.
In California, there was very definite opposi
tion to Olson, Warren's candidacy and victory
being foreseeable a matter of years ago. Cul
bert L. was never more than a politician, was
elected on a wave of Roosevelt and Thirty-
Thursday enthusiasm, and will not be mourned
very deeply by anyone. In Oklahoma, New
Dealer Josh Lee was defeated. Part of his op
position was the result of his prohibition pro
posal which the Senate smothered a few weeks
ago, and the local politicians provided the rest
by nominating a Democrat on the Republican
ticket, thus splitting Lee's party support. The
re-election of Ham Fish, ornament to the House
that he is, is not to be taken to prove that Duch
ess County is an isolationist stronghold, only
that much as the good people of the Hudson
Valley hate Hitler, they hate neighbor Roosevelt
too. All this is to show that the people of Amer
ica did not unite to reprimand the Administra
tion for its conduct of the war. It was not a
repudiation of what Life calls the Roosevelt
party, but a mild protest combined with a lot
of local politics and the recidivism of some
wandering Republicans.
The election of Thomas Dewey as Governor
of New York poses the guestion whether or
not he can deliver the goods. He was an able
district attorney and may be an able Governor.
If he is, then there is a contender for the Re
publican nomination in 1944.

very deeply by anyone. In Oklahoma, New
Dealer Josh Lee was defeated. Part of his op
position was the result of his prohibition pro
posal which the Senate smothered a few weeks
ago, and the local politicians provided the rest
by nominating a Democrat on the Republican
ticket, thus splitting Lee's party support. The
re-election of Ham Fish, ornament to the House
that he is, is not to be taken to prove that Duch
ess County is an isolationist stronghold, only
that much as the good people of the Hudson
Valley hate Hitler, they hate neighbor Roosevelt
too. All this is to show that the people of Amer
ica did not unite to reprimand the Administra
tion for its conduct of the war. It was not a
repudiation of what Life calls the Roosevelt
party, but a mild protest combined with a lot
of local politics and the recidivism of some
wandering Republicans.
The election of Thomas Dewey as Governor
of New York poses the guestion whether or
not he can deliver the goods. He was an able
district attorney and may be an able Governor.
If he is, then there is a contender for the Re
publican nomination in 1944.
My thoughts on the election of Clare Boothe
Luce are not printable. She may be a capable
parliamentarian and serve her constituency
well, but, on the other hand, she may serve
only as a sounding-board and pipe-line for the
Luce publications. I don't think there is any
place for a magazine, much less for three, in
the House of Representatives.

A week ago, I announced that the United
Nations were on the offensive. The news from
Egypt is that our offensive is really rolling. It is
early to talk about the complete defeat of the
Afrika Korps, and the Allies may end up in
the Red Sea yet, but so far Rommel is retreating.
In the Solomons, our troops hold their positions
and are slashing at the Japs, while Mac Arthur's
men pour over the mountains toward the Japs'
New Guinea base of Buna. The Germans have
not yet slowed up in Russia, and it may be that
they are willing to give up North Africa if
they think they can force Russia into a separate
peace, a remote possibility, I think.

It is curious to think that there may be a
major reshuffling in Congress, just after Con
gress had started to work in earnest. I refer
particularly to the revenue bill just passed.
