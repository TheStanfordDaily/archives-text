The Editor, Sir:
Is there no one to come to the defense of the
proposed plan to eliminate vacations? What
kind of people make up the student body of
this University? Are we not mature young
men and women? Or are we little children who
at the slightest imposition made on us must
cry out, "I want my Mama"?
The students who will have to withdraw from
the University before June are certainly in a
small minority; a vast majority of those will
have a week's leave before being sent into
training. Now we have to speed up production
(and that includes trained men and women). A
month s time lost now could not be made up.
We are still trying to catch up for the years we
were behind when this war started. Even with
out the transportation difficulties the vacation
elimination plan has much good merit.
As far as the necessity for "talking it over
with the folks" is concerned, an exchange of
letters is a much more objective and rational
way of deciding an issue. Perhaps some of us
haven't been told that Santa Claus is a myth;
the spirit of Christmas may be kept wherever
we are or whatever we are doing.
