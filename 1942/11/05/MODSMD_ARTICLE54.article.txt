# THE 						SHIP THAT BOMBED JAPAN

JAPANESE RADIO announced that damage done to several principal
Japanese cities, including Tokyo, in air raids was caused by North
American medium bombers like the one shown above. The planes
made a 4,000-mile hop from Australia to sock Jap targets in the Philip
pines once before. Japs say the Tokyo raiders were carrier-based, but
Washington has kept mum.
