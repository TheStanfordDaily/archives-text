# Grad Post On Excom Still Open
## Nominations Re-Open Friday; Elections To Be Held Tuesday 
### 
Since but one man was nominated
to fill the graduate vacancy on Ex
com in yesterday's filing, and that
man was declared ineligible for in
sufficient units, the election sched
uled for Friday will be postponed till
Tuesday and nominations for that
one position will be reopened to
morrow from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. at the
same place.
Decision for postponement was
reached by President Ed Stamm and
Election Board Chairman Bob Gris
wold after weighing the importance
of filling the Excom office with a
good man.
Time is too short to arrange fil
ings today, Griswold explained, and
the constitution stipulates that nom
inations must be at least two days
before elections. Hence, Friday for
filing and Tuesday for voting were
the days appointed.
Nominations for the B.A.C. posi
tion vacated by Frank Hewitt are of
course closed. For the graduate
position formerly held by Vic Hor
gon, who has entered the service,
all graduate men and women are
eligible to file. Fifteen signatures by
student body members are required
on petitions, which are obtainable
at the voting box on the Outer Quad
near the Law Steps.
