# Excom Unifies Campus Drives
## 
### JOHN HORRALL 
The recommendation by the
Drives Committee that all on
campus drives be organized under a
War Chest Board was referred to a
committee last night by Excom.
Carlos Brown was named chairman
to work with Ned Gates, Mary Helen
Bergman, Patty Bouchard, and Bill
Moran.
The Drives Committee suggested
that all drives, Red Cross, Conva
lescent Home, World Student Service
Fund, Family Call and possibly
Dimes for Diplomas, be put together
on the order of a Community Chest
plan.
This idea would eliminate daily
and weekly days for collection for
drives and consolidate all into one
week each quarter. Under this plan,
according to A.S.S.U. Vice-President
Leslie Langneckcr, each student
would makcÂ»a definite contribution
rather than a "change in the pocket"
offering.
The Excom-appointed committee
will look into the plan and present
a recommendation next week.
Excom also passed on the follow
ing business last night:
1. Agreed that the War Board
should dispose of Red Cross service
kits through the women's living
groups.
2. Allowed Cardinals to sign a
"medium big name" band for the
campus Big Game dance.
3. Awarded Block "S" cards to
varsity golfers Dave Doud, Frank
McCann, George Traphagen, and
John Wilson.
4. Discussed the organization of
men students. Further discussion
will be held next week.
