### BILL STEIF 
With the signing of Gary Nottingham's smooth hand, plans for Stan
ford's traditional Big Game Dance last night neared perfection, according
to dance chairman Ted Ebcrle.
Eberle and Hays Busch of the dance committee had been negotiating,
lo obtain Nottingham's well-known 12-piece outfit for several weeks, but

it was only yesterday that
necessary contracts were signed. ,
The result, according to chairman
Eberle, "gives Stanford one of the
coast's ace bands for one of Stan
ford's biggest nights."
CAL TRIED TOO
At the same time the dance chair- j
man acknowledged that Cal had also j
been attempting to get Nottingham ;
for its Big Game cotillion, but that
a little prompt action on the part [
of the Farm's Big Game dance com
mittee had stolen a march on the
Berkeleyites and obtained Netting- j
ham for Stanford.
"Gary Nottingham's band," said 1
Eberle, "has played at the Bal Ta- ]
barin in San Francisco and has also
had several engagements at the |
St. Francis. In addition, thus band
has had long stays at Jansen Beach
in Portland and Sweets' in Oak
land, and has played at Tahoe and
Salt Lake City."
IN WOMEN'S GYM
This year's Big Game dance, the
Red and White Ball, is scheduled
for Big Game night, Nov. 21, in the

"The Women's Gym," stated Eb
erle, "was selected for this year's
dance so that Stanford men and
women might enjoy a 'real' Big
Game night without worrying how
to get gas for their cars in order to
get home. The fact that gas ra
tioning goes into effect the day after
the Big Game will undoubtedly
change the plans of many who have
hitherto spent Big Game night at
Del Monte or in the city—and that
is why the Farm's dance is going to
be on-campus."

Ball go on sale at the A.S.S.U. office,
just above the Cellar, this morn
ing. The price of tickets this year
is $2.75, including the 10 per cent
government amusement tax. This,
according to Eberle, is a substantial
reduction over last year's Big Game
dance tariff.
Dress for the affair will be op
tionally formal.
The dance is from 9 p.m. to 1
a.m.
With the signing of Gary Nottingham's smooth hand, plans for Stan
ford's traditional Big Game Dance last night neared perfection, according
to dance chairman Ted Ebcrle.
Eberle and Hays Busch of the dance committee had been negotiating,
lo obtain Nottingham's well-known 12-piece outfit for several weeks, but

it was only yesterday that
necessary contracts were signed. ,
The result, according to chairman
Eberle, "gives Stanford one of the
coast's ace bands for one of Stan
ford's biggest nights."
CAL TRIED TOO
At the same time the dance chair- j
man acknowledged that Cal had also j
been attempting to get Nottingham ;
for its Big Game cotillion, but that
a little prompt action on the part [
of the Farm's Big Game dance com
mittee had stolen a march on the
Berkeleyites and obtained Netting- j
ham for Stanford.
"Gary Nottingham's band," said 1
Eberle, "has played at the Bal Ta- ]
barin in San Francisco and has also
had several engagements at the |
St. Francis. In addition, thus band
has had long stays at Jansen Beach
in Portland and Sweets' in Oak
land, and has played at Tahoe and
Salt Lake City."
IN WOMEN'S GYM
This year's Big Game dance, the
Red and White Ball, is scheduled
for Big Game night, Nov. 21, in the
Women's Gym.
"The Women's Gym," stated Eb
erle, "was selected for this year's
dance so that Stanford men and
women might enjoy a 'real' Big
Game night without worrying how
to get gas for their cars in order to
get home. The fact that gas ra
tioning goes into effect the day after
the Big Game will undoubtedly
change the plans of many who have
hitherto spent Big Game night at
Del Monte or in the city—and that
is why the Farm's dance is going to
be on-campus."
