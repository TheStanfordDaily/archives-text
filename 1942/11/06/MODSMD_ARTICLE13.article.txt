# Phi Psi Beet Toppers Bet Day's Wages
## War Board To Seek More Group Rivalry In Beet Harvesting 
### 
The Stanford spirit was injected
into the heel-topping program yes
terday when I'hi I'si watered its af
ternoon's paycheck that it could top
a greater ' >ct> l tonnage than the
A.T.O.'s. The challenge was accept
ed and the harvesting tilt will begin '
this afternoon at 12:45.
Kappa Alpha and S.A.E. teams will
also top beets this afternoon, but on
a non-competitive basis.
The War Board reports that until
today the scheduled four teams for
afternoon shifts have not turned out.
Response from Encina's 450 men has ]
been meager, remarked Luana Fork
ner of the S.W.B. It was suggested
that Encina take a lesson from the
Phi Psi-A.T.O. rivalry and encour
age corridors to challenge each other
and create a "round robin" to height- j
en the competitive spirit.

Although the number of Stanford
beet-toppers has been slim this
week, the quality of work produced
by the few men at hand brought
high commendation from Harley
Jenecke, ranch owner.

Yesterday, ten-man teams from
the Kappa Sig and Chi Psi houses
averaged approximately one ton of
topped beats per man during the
four-hour shift.
Mr. Jenecke has offered a bonus
to the most productive team at the
end of the season which ends a week
from Sunday. He has also provided
trucks to pick up crqp crews at the
Bookstore each afternoon. No work
is scheduled for Saturday, but a
morning shift is programmed this
Sunday.
