### 
"If Taylor and his assistants rip
up the opposing line and secondary
and our backfield operates at full
force, Washington will be all washed
up," was the prediction of Pop War
ner as he concluded his remarks at
the rally last night in the Pavilion.
The famed former Farm football
coach told an audience that included
a delegation of British sailors that
good coaching, fine material, and
excellent conditioning don't mean a
thing without spirit in the stands and
on the turf. And Stanford has the
same fine spirit now as in his time,
Warner said.
Reading letters of advice he had
received during his coaching career,
he quoted a slogan suggested by one
alumnus to guarantee victory, "Let
every man get down to the spot and
let the game wax hot."
After Marchie Schwartz had de
clared some teams may have been
finer in games won but no one could
be finer in courage and fight than
the present group of boys, he intro
duced the squad. Assistant Coach
Vic Lindskog was called to the
microphone by shouts from the
stands and predicted a Stanford
victory.
Something new was added in the
musical line when a group from the
band gave forth with a combination
of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" and
"She Done Him Wrong" in pseudo
Dixiland style. The shouts for more
were answered with "The Darktown
Strutters Ball."
