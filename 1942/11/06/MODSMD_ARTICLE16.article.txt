Stanford will have a real Christmas vacation.
This was decided yesterday at a meeting of a committee composed of
Stanford students and faculty members after hearing Registrar J. P.
Mitchell's report from the Southern Pacific Company.
In order to meet traffic problems involved, the following changes have
made in the University ealen

I dar:
1. End quarter examinations this
quarter will be held Dec. 14-17 in
stead of Dec. 15-18.
2. Registration day Winter Quar
ter will be changed to Jan. 5 instead
of Jan. 4.
These two changes will divert the
| traffic from the weekend period
j when traffic problems are greatest.
The changes will be adequate only
if those students who need railroad
accommodations co-operate with th<>
railroad company in making early
reservations and in accepting minor
disappointments and discomforts.
When students make reservations,
they should be sure that they are
kept, it was pointed out by the com
mittee.
RAILWAY CO()PERATES
Claude E. Peterson, T. Louis
j Chess, and Emil te Gruen of the
; Southern Pacific Company cooper
i ated with Dr. Mitchell in making this
j new arrangement possible.
Thanksgiving vacation will re
main the sameâ€”from Nov. 26 to 29.
A week ago the committee pro
posed an idea whereby Thanksgiv
ing recess would be eliminated, regis
tration day for Winter Quarter would
be only four days after Autumn
j Quarter finals, three days would be
; taken off at Christmas and one off at
New Year's; but this plan was dis
carded yesterday.
FIFTY LETTERS
One week of fevered debate fol
j lowed the idea with close to 50 let -
! ters being written to the Campus
: Opinion column in The Daily. Still
in the iiles are .10 letters which
could not be printed because of
space shortage.
Miss Anastasia Doyle has an
nounced that women's residences will
be opened 48 hours before Winter
Quarter registration day to accom
modate those girls who will be re
turning early.

posed of Miss Doyle, Dean of Women
