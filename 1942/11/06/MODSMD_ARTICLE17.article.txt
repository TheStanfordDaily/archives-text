# Campus Favors Long Vacation
## 
### BILL COUGHLIN 
Campus opinion on the Christmas
vacation decision, which will give
students a Dec. 17-Jan. 4 holiday,
varied yesterday from hearty agree
ment (in the majority) to complete
disapproval.
An informal, "man-in-the-street"
poll, taken yesterday afternoon hy
The Daily, revealed the following
opinions:
Betty Jane Tweedy, Alpha Phi:
"I'm just so pleased that student
opinion was taken into consideration,
after all."
Lewis Mumford, School of Hu
manities professor: "A war is in
existence and not a single thing in
our lives can remain untouched. I
am against a vacation. The world
has changed completely, the demands
are new. Clinging to a symbol like
Christmas vacation is a sign we are
not ready to face reality."
Ed Stamm, student body president:
"I think it's marvelous that so many
kids going into the services in the
spring will get a chance to be with
their folks one more Christmas. It
will also give them a chance to talk
plans for enlistments over with their
parents. We have to have a vaca
tion sometime and Christmas is the
best time."
Barbara Templeton, Pi Phi: "It is
good that we are continuing in nor
mal lines and not losing our heads."
Roscmaric Cross, SWB head: "The
comittee did the right thing in view
of campus opinion but I'm sorry stu
dents aren't facing the situation.
Stanford is a war plant and other
war plants are not shutting down
for a holiday."
Peggy Boothc, Excom member. "If
the way they've decided this is all
right with the Army and the rail
roads, it's all right with me."
Bruce McClelland. Chappie biz.
manager: "Too bad! Think of the
Christmas advertising the Chappie
is missing out on!"
Russ Collier, Delta Chi: "I feel
that this vacation is far too short!
After finals, I need a lot longer than
that to recuperate."
Marge Gcstring, The Oaks: "It's
swell. I'm all for it."
And now a parting holiday
thought: DON'T FCm GET TO
NOTIFY YOUR LOCAL DRAFT
BOARD OF CHANGE OF AD
DRESS. Merry Christmas!
