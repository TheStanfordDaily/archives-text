"FRIENDLY ENE M I E S," now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
The two comedy stars, "Charlies" ]
Winninger and Ruggles, both at
tempt to turn dramatic in the same j
picture and it is too much. Adopted i
from a stage play of the World War
I era, it deals with the attitudes of j
two old German gentlemen, who j
have come to the land of oppor- I
tunity, in regard to the war against
their fatherland. One is thoroughly
Americanized, but the other thinks
the whole thing is a darn shame and
is taken in on a deal to support a
German spy ring.
Throughout the entire picture, in
thick German accents. Ruggles, the
Americanized, attempts to convince ,
Winninger that the American way
is best. Also thrown in with this is ■
a romance between Ruggles' daugh
ter and Winninger's son. When the
son joins the American forces, this
is too much for the old German and
he leaves his happy family. But then
the German spy ring is responsible
for the sinking of the transport on
which his son is going to Paris, and
Winninger's change of heart takes j
place with much drama, flag waving, j
and the eventual capture of the spy
ring. The picture ends with the
singing of "America" and a glimpse
of Old Glory.
The second feature, "Little Annie
Roonie," stars Shirley Temple as the
jitter-buggin?r, puppy-loving, drama
struck gal whose father is all for
the "get-rich-quick" system which
always leads to difficulties. The jit
ter-bugging and loving all take place |
with the kid star. Dickie Moore, who
has a rather clever part if you go
for that sort of thing.—Martin.
