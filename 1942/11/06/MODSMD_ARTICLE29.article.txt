# Farm Drama Group Will Play 'Eve of St. Mark' Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford Players couldn't have chosen a heller play with which to
epen their season than "The Eve of St. Mark," for it is timcl.\ in topic and
appeal, and they couldn't have done this show in a more convincing
manner.
it will continue to play in the Little Theater tonight, tomorrow, and

Monday at 8:15 p.m.
The entire cast seemed to grasp
the mood—the passion and tender
ness of the love scenes, the lusty,
coarse quality of Army life, the plea
to understand the motives that make
men want to be honorable soldiers,
were all handled with finesse.
STANFORD DEBUT
Particularly outstanding was Moo
fie Faris, in her debut on the Stan
ford stage, as the fiancee. She han
dled her sophisticated, intimate lines
delicately, sincerely, and with a lyr
icism that immediately won the sup
port of the audience.
Not quite so sure and positive in
his romantic scenes, Malcolm Me-
Killop. nevertheless, made a good
average American soldier.
Outstanding among the soldiers
was Russ Bryan, the southern poet,
partly because of the character Max
well Anderson gave him. but mostly
because of his deep poetic voice and
his unhesitating confidence.
Jaeque Poley, in her eternal role
of a "misled woman," was excellent.
Good in her character role, too, was
Gloria Olivi as Quizz's mother
MOODS CREATED
But the most outstanding element
was the manner in which the whole
cast cooperated to put across Ander
son's message and to creat a mood,
a rollicking comic mood in the bar
rooms and barracks, a knowing,
soberminded, simple mood in the
scenes at home and between Quizz
and his sweetheart.
As usual, F. C. Strickland, direc
tor has turned out an excellent show,
better than some we'v seen on the
professional stage. Glasson.
The number of German gram
mar schools and pupils decreased at
the rate of 0.7 per cent and 1.4 per
cent respectively in 1939.

of a "misled woman," was excellent.
Good in her character role, too, was
Gloria Olivi as Quizz's mother
MOODS CREATED
But the most outstanding element
