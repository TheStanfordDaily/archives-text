# Allies Smash Afrika Korps
## Nazis, Italians Lose Most of Their Tanks 
### 
CAIRO, Nov. 5 (U.R)â€”British des
ert troops urged on by their com
manders report that "complete vic
tory is almost in sight." They are
smashing relentlessly at the fleeing
Afrika Korps and advising it by
leaflet to surrender and avoid use
less massacre, front reports said to
night.
Latest dispatches said that Field
Marshall Erwin Rommel was threat
ened with the loss of his remaining
tanks. He now has less than 250
which he has thrown into a des
perate rear guard covering maneuver
as the imperial troops, supported by
heavy artillery, pick them off one
by one.
ALLIED PLANES HAMMER
Allied planes are hammering con
stantly at the mafn body of the flee
ing forces and heavy American
bombers are ranging nearly 500 miles
ahead of the Axis road of flight.
They have scored hits on four and
possibly five enemy supply ships at
Bengazi.
Dispatches reveal that as the Brit
ish troops in the field received Lt.
B. L. Montgomery's "victory incit
ing" message they came to grips with
the Axis rear guard and mowed
down the fleeing enemy in some of
the grimmest slaughters that desert
warfare has seen.
DROP LEAFLETS
Most of the Axis covering troops
were Italians manning Italian tanks
whereas Rommel usually employs
veteran German troops to cover
withdrawals, the reports said. As the
slaughter continued, British planes
flew over the Axis lines and dropped
leaflets calling on the Germans and
Italians to lay down their arms and
prevent more bloodshed.
The Germans were reported to
have sufferd heavily in motor trans
port and were apparently bent on
saving what they could of their own
troops at the expense of their tlalian
allies.
