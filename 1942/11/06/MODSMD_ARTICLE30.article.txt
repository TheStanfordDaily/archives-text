# Stanford Player Group to Form
## 
### 
In order to give the students who
make up the Stanford Players, the
personnel of campus shows, more
authority and responsibility in con
nection with the drama program, the
Players have decided to organize
into a more formal group.
"By doing this, a way will be pro
vided for those who are not mem
bers of the drama department to
stay in touch with the drama program
and its needs and problems, and to
hold the loyalty of people who have
taken part in our shows now and
after they graduate." commented F.
C. Strickland, dramatic director.
After tonight's performance of
"The Eve of St. Mark." Ihe first get
together of the Players will be held
in the Little Theater about 10:30 in
lieu of a cast party, formerly held
off campus. Everyone who has ever
worked on a Stanford show is wel
come.
