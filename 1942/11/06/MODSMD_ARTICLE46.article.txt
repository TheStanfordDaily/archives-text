# Christmas and Stanford II
## 
### 
ONE week of letting off steam proved one
thing to The Daily—many Stanford stu
dents are narrow-minded and unwilling to
change opinions. When the proposed short
Christmas vacation plan was introduced in The
Daily a week ago today, it was specifically
pointed out that this was not a pressure job from
the University; it was merely a demonstration
by a committee composed of students and fac
ulty members that we were ready to meet the
transportation emergency in case it should hit
the University seriously.

There was absolutely no attempt on the
part of the administration to keep students here
for a long time. Everyone realized that "this is
probably the last Christmas many of us will be
able to see our parents." Everyone realized that
many have to work to get money to return to
school next guarter. Everyone realized that the
best job couldn't be done when students return
to school only four days after taking from 18 to
21 units of finals.

But many of the authors of letters to The Daily
couldn't understand that the committee (not the
administration) was actually trying to relieve
the problem as much as possible. The reasons
for the plan were presented in last Friday's
Daily and need not be repeated, but we are sure
now that hundreds of Stanford students read
into the explanation what they wanted to be
lieve and not what was actually the truth.

To quote but one of the several quaint letters
which were not printed this week would show
a typical attitude.

"Where's the backbone of our student repre
sentatives on the board which is settling this
problem? Come on, don't let the administra
tion put words into your mouths and tell you
what to do. Talk back to them and do what
you're supposed to do—represent the students!"

This was merely signed "A Disgruntled Stu
dent," which is very novel. The following ex
planation for the lack of a signature was given:

"If you want a signed signature on this state
ment, I am sure that I wouldn't have much
trouble in getting about 3500 of them for you."

The author of the letter is supposed to be a
college student, a person with common sense
and reasoning powers. Yet, because he is so
blinded with his hate of any authority over him,
he writes a scathing letter and then does not
have the intestinal fortitude to sign it.

This student obviously thinks he is intelligent.
One more paragraph from his letter would re
fute that statement.

". . . We are willing to take our chances on
getting home somehow; but to have the chance
taken away unfairly (showing just how much
he read of the true explanation of the proposed
change) by the school is a little too much to sit
back and take lying down. Surely, the many
alternatives suggested by the students—who
show considerably more brains than our illus
trious administration—offer a better solution."

That is a Stanford student talking. He with
"more brains than our illustrious administra-

tion" probably got caught water-bagging at
Encina one day and couldn't understand why it
was dangerous.

If he learned his narrow way of thinking at
Stanford, then we are at fault; if he learned it
elsewhere and has not been able to shake it
while attending one of the top universities in
the country, then he should go back to kinder
garten and start working with sandpiles again;
that's probably what he will be doing all of his
life, anyway.

That's only one man. He's not alone, but we
hope his type is in the minority.

With elections and the coming banquet the
featured attractions, all Daily staff members
will trek to the Shack Sunday at high noon
for a half-hour session with the Editorial
Board. Attendance will be compulsory. See

Stanford, then we are at fault; if he learned it
elsewhere and has not been able to shake it
while attending one of the top universities in
the country, then he should go back to kinder
garten and start working with sandpiles again;
that's probably what he will be doing all of his
life, anyway.

That's only one man. He's not alone, but we
hope his type is in the minority.

ONE week of letting off steam proved one
thing to The Daily—many Stanford stu
dents are narrow-minded and unwilling to
change opinions. When the proposed short
Christmas vacation plan was introduced in The
Daily a week ago today, it was specifically
pointed out that this was not a pressure job from
the University; it was merely a demonstration
by a committee composed of students and fac
ulty members that we were ready to meet the
transportation emergency in case it should hit
the University seriously.

There was absolutely no attempt on the
part of the administration to keep students here
for a long time. Everyone realized that "this is
probably the last Christmas many of us will be
able to see our parents." Everyone realized that
many have to work to get money to return to
school next guarter. Everyone realized that the
best job couldn't be done when students return
to school only four days after taking from 18 to
21 units of finals.

But many of the authors of letters to The Daily
couldn't understand that the committee (not the
administration) was actually trying to relieve
the problem as much as possible. The reasons
for the plan were presented in last Friday's
Daily and need not be repeated, but we are sure
now that hundreds of Stanford students read
into the explanation what they wanted to be
lieve and not what was actually the truth.

To quote but one of the several quaint letters
which were not printed this week would show
a typical attitude.

"Where's the backbone of our student repre
sentatives on the board which is settling this
problem? Come on, don't let the administra
tion put words into your mouths and tell you
what to do. Talk back to them and do what
you're supposed to do—represent the students!"

This was merely signed "A Disgruntled Stu
dent," which is very novel. The following ex
planation for the lack of a signature was given:

"If you want a signed signature on this state
ment, I am sure that I wouldn't have much
trouble in getting about 3500 of them for you."

The author of the letter is supposed to be a
college student, a person with common sense
and reasoning powers. Yet, because he is so
blinded with his hate of any authority over him,
he writes a scathing letter and then does not
have the intestinal fortitude to sign it.

This student obviously thinks he is intelligent.
One more paragraph from his letter would re
fute that statement.

". . . We are willing to take our chances on
getting home somehow; but to have the chance
taken away unfairly (showing just how much
he read of the true explanation of the proposed
change) by the school is a little too much to sit
back and take lying down. Surely, the many
alternatives suggested by the students—who
show considerably more brains than our illus
trious administration—offer a better solution."

That is a Stanford student talking. He with
"more brains than our illustrious administra-

tion" probably got caught water-bagging at
Encina one day and couldn't understand why it
was dangerous.

If he learned his narrow way of thinking at
Stanford, then we are at fault; if he learned it
elsewhere and has not been able to shake it
while attending one of the top universities in
the country, then he should go back to kinder
garten and start working with sandpiles again;

taken away unfairly (showing just how much
he read of the true explanation of the proposed
change) by the school is a little too much to sit
back and take lying down. Surely, the many
alternatives suggested by the students—who
show considerably more brains than our illus
trious administration—offer a better solution."

That is a Stanford student talking. He with
"more brains than our illustrious administra-

tion" probably got caught water-bagging at
Encina one day and couldn't understand why it
was dangerous.

If he learned his narrow way of thinking at
Stanford, then we are at fault; if he learned it
elsewhere and has not been able to shake it
while attending one of the top universities in
the country, then he should go back to kinder
garten and start working with sandpiles again;
that's probably what he will be doing all of his
life, anyway.

That's only one man. He's not alone, but we
hope his type is in the minority.

With elections and the coming banquet the
featured attractions, all Daily staff members
will trek to the Shack Sunday at high noon
for a half-hour session with the Editorial
Board. Attendance will be compulsory. See
ya!
