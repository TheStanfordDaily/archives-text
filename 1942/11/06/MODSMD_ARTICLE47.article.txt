# BULL SESSION
## WARNING NOTE TO MR. MASTERS 
### 
With building materials at such a premium
and labor even more costly, the Board of Athletic
Control would do well to take good care of our
Stadium.
Maybe it is only made out of wood and con
crete and only holds 90,000 people, but it is the
best we have and we're going to have to make
it last for a long time.
As an example of the heads-up ball Arnold
Eddy is playing in watching out for the interests
of the City of Los Angeles, he locks up the L.A.
Coliseum immediately after every ball game.
* # * #
Several gentlemen of the press and their tele
graph operators worked late, until about 8 p.m.,
after last Saturday afternoon's game down there.
When they went to leave after sending their
stories, naturally all the gates in the high wire
fence surrounding the structure were closed.
But these men headed for the one slim gate down
at the peristyle end that was always left open —
at least so they thought.
They arrived, panting, at the gate only to
find it closed and locked securely. Since the
fence was about 20 feet high with several strands
of barbed wire strung along the top of it, and
since Mr. Borba and Mr. Connolly were not
commandos, they availed themselves of a pay
telephone on the premises, and within 40 min
utes time got out of the place.
Now I'm not saying anything about the great
inconvenience that caused all of those men, I'm
not even mentioning the fact that one of them
missed a wedding he'd driven 400 miles to see,
because all of that is relatively unimportant,
compared to the job of seeing that someone
didn't come through an'open gate and walk off
with the Coliseum.

Think what a spot it would put the City of Los
Angeles, the University of Southern California,
and the University of California at L.A, in if
a couple of guys drove in with say maybe a
half-ton truck, loaded the Coliseum onto the
back of it, and drove off. They could probably
get rid of it through some "fence" and clear guite
a piece of change on the deal.

Mind you, Mr. Eddy, who is manager of the
place, and his assistants didn't even leave a
narrow gate open so that any burglars could
carry the Coliseum outside and load it onto the
truck. Very commendable action.

My point is that should we perhaps post a
couple of B.A.C. guards around the Stanford
Stadium at night, because with it being smaller
than the Coliseum, it would take only one big
man in a pick-up or a large sedan to make off
with it, playing field and all.

As an example of the heads-up ball Arnold
Eddy is playing in watching out for the interests
of the City of Los Angeles, he locks up the L.A.
Coliseum immediately after every ball game.

Several gentlemen of the press and their tele
graph operators worked late, until about 8 p.m.,
after last Saturday afternoon's game down there.
When they went to leave after sending their
stories, naturally all the gates in the high wire
fence surrounding the structure were closed.
But these men headed for the one slim gate down
at the peristyle end that was always left open —
at least so they thought.
They arrived, panting, at the gate only to
find it closed and locked securely. Since the
fence was about 20 feet high with several strands
of barbed wire strung along the top of it, and
since Mr. Borba and Mr. Connolly were not
commandos, they availed themselves of a pay
telephone on the premises, and within 40 min
utes time got out of the place.
Now I'm not saying anything about the great
inconvenience that caused all of those men, I'm
not even mentioning the fact that one of them
missed a wedding he'd driven 400 miles to see,
because all of that is relatively unimportant,
compared to the job of seeing that someone
didn't come through an'open gate and walk off
with the Coliseum.

Think what a spot it would put the City of Los
Angeles, the University of Southern California,
and the University of California at L.A, in if
a couple of guys drove in with say maybe a
half-ton truck, loaded the Coliseum onto the
back of it, and drove off. They could probably
get rid of it through some "fence" and clear guite
a piece of change on the deal.

Mind you, Mr. Eddy, who is manager of the
place, and his assistants didn't even leave a
narrow gate open so that any burglars could
carry the Coliseum outside and load it onto the
truck. Very commendable action.

My point is that should we perhaps post a
couple of B.A.C. guards around the Stanford
Stadium at night, because with it being smaller
than the Coliseum, it would take only one big
man in a pick-up or a large sedan to make off
with it, playing field and all.

With building materials at such a premium
and labor even more costly, the Board of Athletic
Control would do well to take good care of our
Stadium.
Maybe it is only made out of wood and con
crete and only holds 90,000 people, but it is the
best we have and we're going to have to make
it last for a long time.
