The Editor, Sir:
An article appeared in the Campus Opinion
section condemning some of the professors in
our University for engaging in criticism of our
American system. In this article the author said,
"Our system is again showing that it has the
flexibility to meet any demand upon it."
If this is true, our system surely cannot flinch
at criticism even if it evolves, as the author so
fears, socialistic thinking. If we, a democracy,
can't defend ourselves against arguments that
are based upon sound reasoning perhaps we
are wrong in certain of our assumptions.
Had we engaged in more theorizing during
the last war and less at the peace table the Ver
sailles Treaty might have proven more practi
cable. If we refrain from criticism of the present
war effort and refuse to think about the future,
we are running the risk of losing the peace for
the second time.
Perhaps the statement made in the article,
"The more you know the more ignorant you
become," is not so valid in the light of the 12
million or so deaths that are already a reality
because of nations knowing too little.—Sid Levin.

The Editor, Sir:
"Hello," said the smiling freshman to the
senior as they passed each other on the Quad.
In just as cheerful a tone the upperclassman
returned the greeting, and each went on his
way. The fact that neither of the boys had ever
seen each other was immaterial, because they
were merely carrying out the spirit of friendli
ness pervading the Stanford campus.

I have been told that the situation described
above is supposed to be a respected tradition
at Stanford, but in the three weeks that I have
been here the tradition appears to have been
forgotten. Although traditions ordinarily mean
little to me, I feel that in the custom, "Everybody
Speaks," we have a habit which everyone can
adopt for the benefit of all.
In uncertain times like these we live in today
there is greater need for a closer feeling of
campus unity than ever existed before—espe
cially with gasoline rationing soon to start.
If we are to have a really friendly atmosphere
on the Farm, it is high time that we revitalize the
old Stanford custom of speaking to everyone
we meet on the campus whether the person be
boy or girl, or professor or visitor.—Louis Silver.
