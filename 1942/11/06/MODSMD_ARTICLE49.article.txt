# Women's Halls Sell Prom Bids
## Murphy's Orchestra Will Play Saturday 
### 
With 300 bids sold, women from
every residence on campus will get
into the swing of the back to Farm
movement at the Lagunita-Union
formal tomorrow night in the Wom
en's Gym from 9 to 1 a.m.
Bids for the dance are available
at the A.S.S.U. office until tomor
row noon, Ada Lee Kinard, L;igunita
chairman of the dance, stated. Bids
sell for $1.50.
ALL WOMEN
According to Miss Kinard, bids
will not be sold at the dance. The
sororities have already turned in
their bids and women living on the
row who want bids will now have
to buy them at the A.S.S.U. office.
Bids may also be purchased at the
desk of the Union, and in the other
women's residences until Friday
night.
Pointing out that the dance will
be one of the few formal dances
with an orchestra on campus this
quarter, Miss Kinard and Berna
Cilker, Union chairman of the dance,
emphasized that the affair is open
to all women on campus.
SMOOTH TUNES
"One of the outstanding features
of the dance will be Eddie Murphy's
orchestra—in person—" Miss Kinard
said. "And," she added, "he will play
some of the smoothest tunes of the
season."
Besides brange punch, cookies and
finger sandwiches will be served
during the evening, according to |
Natalie Towle, chairman of the re
freshments committee.
For the past three years Lagunita
has given a Court Ball every autumn
quarter in its dining hall. The tra
ditional dance has been changed and j
Union and Lagunita have combined
their efforts in the interests of an
all-University dance.
