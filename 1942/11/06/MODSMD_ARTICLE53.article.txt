Fidel Liißarba of the United States

that Laßarba, a fighting man if there
ever was one, would be forced to

Even before Pearl Harbor he tried
to enlist, but impaired sight in his
left eye, an aftermath of a bout with
Kid Chocolate in 1932, kept him
out. Finally he was drafted last

he has been assigned to the athletic
oHice as boxing instructor.
