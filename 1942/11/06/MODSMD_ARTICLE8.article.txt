# Strong Air Defense Should Stop Huskies
## 
### 
Stanford's pass defense seems the only barrier between Washington
retaining its slim chance to stay in the Pacific Coast Conference race with
a victory tomorrow at Kczar Stadium in San Francisco.
Coach Marchie Schwartz worked on the Indian barrage balloons all last
week, while giving the Card offense a lesser place in workouts.

The backfield that goes in to stop
) the Huskies' passes will be Fay
Hammett, Bill Sheller, Ross Dana,
; and Art Shipkey. Sophomore Bob
Andrews will start at quarterback
with game captain Hammett occupy
j ing a bench seat to get an inkling on
| Coach Ralph "Pest" Welch's club
i from the sidelines.
Replacing Buck Fawcett at full
back is Shipkey, nephew of line
Coach Harry Shipkey. Art was
nearly off to a touchdown against
UCLA last wek, and off that game,
gets the starting berth in place of
| Bob Frisbee.
I Sheller drew a slight shoulder in
i jury at practice yesterday, but is
j expecting to be ready for full-time
j kicking and plunging duty. Sheller
J has been the team's most consistent
i man since the season started and has
played close to every game the
j whole 60 minutes.
( Hank Norberg bounced back into
j a starting spot at left end when he
j appeared at practice, his shoulder
pointer apparently healed enough to
allow the big boy to play.
Chuck Taylor will call defensive
; signals from left guard now that
! Loren LaPrade will ride the bench
with Bill Young playing right guard.
Schwartz got a scare yesterday
j when an unidentified player landed
! on Sheller's shoulder and knocked
it out of place. A quick trip to the
chiropractor put the misplaced
member back together.
Odds quote Washington a slight
favorite, since the Huskies over
powered Oregon State last week.
13-0, and Stanford loses LaPrade
and Fawcelt for the game, plus the
added hangover of a 20-7 lons to
I UCLA.
