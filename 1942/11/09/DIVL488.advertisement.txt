YOUR BOOKSTORE ANNOUNCES that because of
a better-than-expected final showing on last year's op
erations, it is returning to the faculty and students an
additional rebate of 5 per cent on their purchase tickets
from June 1, 1941, to May 31, 1 942. With the 8 per cent
paid last spring, this makes a total rebate of 13 per cent
for the year.
The Stanford Bookstore is a co-operative enterprise,
conducted solely for the benefit of the students and fac
ulty of the University. All profits earned —beyond the
amounts necessarily held in reserve to insure the con
tinued successful operation of the business —are returned
0
in the form of rebates or are given to the University for
scholarships and other financial aid to students. During
the year in question, the sum of $5,000 was applied to
the latter purpose.
Students and faculty in residence may collect their
extra cash bonus at the office of the store; checks will
be mailed to all others. Continue to save your current
purchase tickets and share in future rebates.
