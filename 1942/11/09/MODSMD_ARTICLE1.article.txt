of the emergency's demands on I
scholarship and physical fitness, all ]
fraternities would conduct sane in

Dean John Bunn.
He also emphasized that the initia- j
tion rulings are not made by the |
University, but by the Interfraternity '
Board, composed mostly of students.
It was Board President Bob Moulton
and Dick Hoover who suggested
these new rulings last year. After
being fairly discussed, they were
passed by the Interfraternity Board.

early; Phi Delta Theta of beginning ;
Pre-Initiation early and hazing; and j
Theta Chi of holding a "quest," an j
illegal action in itself, and of holding j
the quest a week before the com- j
mencement of Pre-Initiation.
FINES LISTED
Fines for Phi Delta Theta and j
Theta Chi are $2.25 a man, including
sophomores, and $1.50 a man includ

However, in an effort to help the j
War Effort, the Interfratcrnity Board j
of Control made it mandatory that !
the fines be worked off in the beet
fields, or on other agrarian work be
tween Nov. 5 and 30. This definitely
excludes working in the canneries,
Southern Pacific, or similar relative- !
ly earlier and high paid jobs.
