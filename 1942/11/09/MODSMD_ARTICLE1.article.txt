# Interfraternity Council Penalizes Three Houses For Hell Week Violations
## A.T.O., Phi Delt, Theta Chi to Pay For Early Pre-Initiations, 'Quest', By Working to Harvest Beet Crop 
### 
Penalization of three Stanford fraternities for violation of Pre-Initiation
(Hell Week) regulations was disclosed last night by Interfratcrnity Presi
dent Lee Peake.
The fraternities listed as guilty were Alpha Tan Cmega, Phi Delta Theta,
and Theta Chi. 1

Alpha Tau Omega was found
guilty of beginning Pre-Initiation
early; Phi Delta Theta of beginning
Pre-Initiation early and hazing; and
Theta Chi of holding a "quest," an
illegal action in itself, and of holding
the quest a week before the com-
mencement of Pre-Initiation.
FINES LISTED
Fines for Phi Delta Theta and
Theta Chi are $2.25 a man, including
sophomores, and $1.50 a man includ
ing sophomores for Alpha Tau
Omega.
However, in an effort to help the
War Effort, the Interfraternity Board
of Control made it mandatory that
the fines be worked off in the beet
fields, or on other agrarian work be
tween Nov. 5 and 30. This definitely
excludes working in the canneries,
Southern Pacific, or similar relative-
ly earlier and high paid jobs.
The decisions on the infractions of
these rules were reached in a meet-
ing of Interfraternity Board of Con-
trol late last week.
COUNCIL MAKES RULES
"The violation of these three fra-
ternities was a disappointment to
the other houses and the adminis-
tration who had hoped that, in view
of the emergency's demands on
scholarship and physical fitness, all
fraternities would conduct sane in
itiations for the duration," remarked
Dean John Bunn.
He also emphasized that the initia-
tion rulings are not made by the
University, but by the Interfraternity
Board, composed mostly of students.
It was Board President Bob Moulton
and Dick Hoover who suggested
these new rulings last year. After
being fairly discussed, they were
passed by the Interfraternity Board.
