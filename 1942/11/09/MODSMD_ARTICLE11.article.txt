# Taylor Looms as All-American; Indians Trounce Huskies, 20-7
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford won't go to the Rose Bowl in January of 1943, but you can bet
your last defense stamp that the Redskins have an all-American player
and that they'll wage a terrific battle with California to regain the coveted
axe, now resting in the halls of Berkeley. Oregon State is Stanford's next
foe on the calendar, but the following week Coach Marchie Schwartz'

footballers point for the Big Game. ■>
As if you didn't know by this time,
that all-American hunk of gridiron
dynamite is Charles Albert Taylor,
the Indians' prize left guard who at
one game past the mid-season mark
is fast gaining himself consideration
on all the all-American teams that
always flood the nations' sporting
pages and magazines every year
around the middle of December.
ALL-AMERICAN BATTLE
It was the fiery red-haired Taylor
who swept aside Pete Susick for
fullback Art Shipkey's 23-yard
ramble to the 3-yard line, just be
fore Stanford bucked over to tie
Washington, 7-7, at the half, in Sat
urday's contest in San Francisco.
Again it was Taylor who won a
battle of all-Americans to be sure,
against center Walt Harrison of the
Huskies.
Taylor worked on Harrison as the
big Husky will never be worked on
again. Charles Albert had his day,
but it was not all his.
There was Captain Ray Hammett,
pitching a perfect strike to Roger
Laverty, who scurried to the goal
line and a 13-7 lead in the third
quarter.
HAMMETT PASSES
Hammett was just another wall
flower when the game started, sit

| ting on the bench. But when he had
| a good look at the Huskies' 7-man
j defense, he trotted in to perform
lethal footballery that dispelled
Washington's faint hope of staying
in the coast race.
Not only did Hammett pass well,
as in his best days on the practice
field, but his generalship and ball
handling brought to the game that
old sock and smash that seemed
lacking in all his former efforts.
To a muscular Mr. Shipkey, kin to
: the Ted and Harry of Stanford, go
the plaudits of a great game at full
back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
DANA INTERCEPTS
Shipkey suffered a split lip toward\
| the finish and had several stitches
! taken to close the injured kisser.
Sophomore Ross Dana clinched
the left halfback position for him
self with a rousing exhibition that
was topped off when he intercepted
Bob Erickson's heave in the flat just
short of the goal line and raced 42
yards back up the field.
Ralph "Pest" Welch's boys were
threatening at the time, had been
held twice on the three-yard line,
and were knifed to the quick when
Dana grabbed the ball to put Stan
ford back in possession.
TOUCHDOWN PLAY
The touchdown play that was pre
ceded by Shipkey's burst had an
other prologue. That was Hammett
hurling to end Dave Brown, who
really had to run to catch up and
hold the pigskin that finally settled
in his arms as he half fell, half
stumbled and was finally downed on
the Washington 26-yard line for a
gain of 31 yards.
On the fourth down that followed
Schwartz sent in his screen pass that
Shipkey look from Hammett and
barrelled to the three.

From the three it was Hammett
; himself who scored on a quarter
back sneak behind the forward roll
i of center Milt Vucinich, who snapped
the ball and look Hammett with him
right through the Husky middle.
HUSKIES ROLL
After Stanford manufactured its
second touchdown from Hammett
| to Laverty, the Husky started to roll
j but Dana's interception stymied
{ that, and the Indians went on to their
| final score.
That clinching pay dirt nugget
I came from the piston-driving legs of
| right half Bill "Rock" Shcller. It j
! was Shcller who had coolly tackled
j Arnold Weinmeister on the Stanford
four when he had taken a pass from
I Erickson and was headed for the
promised land.
i After Bruno Banducci recovered
J Susick's fumble and Shipkey and
; Don Zappettini had trembled the :
| Washing forwards to the four- j
! yard mark, Shelter boomed on and
' over Harrison's goal-line tackle for
j six points.
Hank Norberg, improving again ;
j and even better than he appeared
j against Southern California, split
I the uprights for the second time and
I Stanford won, 20-7.
It was difficult to single out even
| those mentioned, for every Indian
! on the field Saturday played cham
; pionship football, and that is not a
4iJniVfrs»t> ir> >si •< v«. (his infor
one-sidcd view.
REGULARS REST
Perhaps, as we once forecast, it
; was the chill weather of San Fran-
I cisco that gave Stanford its added
| oomph to win its second city game.
! Had the Indians played all their
' games for San Francisco fans they

might be topping the conference
right now. As it is Stanford occupies
third place.
Schwartz said last night those who
did not play Saturday would work
out today, while the regulars would
have a much deserved day off from
duty.
Buck Fawcett, who gave a much
needed eight-yard burst during the
second touchdown drive Saturday,
will start next Saturday only if he
is absolutely ready to go full force.
Otherwise Shipkey will remain lead
ing lady at fullback.
LaPRADE OUT
Loren LaPrade, who was sidelined
with a wrenched knee, will remain
hospitalized until the California
game.
Next Saturday Stanford meets
Oregon State, winner Saturday over
Montana, 33-0. The Beavers have
been twice scouted by assistant
Coach Vic Lindskog and once by
cameraman - coach Husky Hunt.
There'll be an unveiling of Beaver
antics this week.
Stanford won't go to the Rose Bowl in January of 1943, but you can bet

ALL-AMERICAN BATTLE
It was the fiery red-haired Taylor
who swept aside Pete Susick for
fullback Art Shipkey's 23-yard
ramble to the 3-yard line, just be
fore Stanford bucked over to tie
Washington, 7-7, at the half, in Sat
urday's contest in San Francisco.
Again it was Taylor who won a
battle of all-Americans to be sure,
against center Walt Harrison of the
Huskies.
Taylor worked on Harrison as the
big Husky will never be worked on
again. Charles Albert had his day,
but it was not all his.
There was Captain Ray Hammett,
pitching a perfect strike to Roger
Laverty, who scurried to the goal
line and a 13-7 lead in the third
quarter.
HAMMETT PASSES
Hammett was just another wall
flower when the game started, sit

| ting on the bench. But when he had
| a good look at the Huskies' 7-man
j defense, he trotted in to perform
lethal footballery that dispelled
Washington's faint hope of staying
in the coast race.
Not only did Hammett pass well,
as in his best days on the practice
field, but his generalship and ball
handling brought to the game that
old sock and smash that seemed
lacking in all his former efforts.
To a muscular Mr. Shipkey, kin to
: the Ted and Harry of Stanford, go
the plaudits of a great game at full
back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
DANA INTERCEPTS
Shipkey suffered a split lip toward\
| the finish and had several stitches
! taken to close the injured kisser.
Sophomore Ross Dana clinched
the left halfback position for him
self with a rousing exhibition that
was topped off when he intercepted
Bob Erickson's heave in the flat just
short of the goal line and raced 42
yards back up the field.
Ralph "Pest" Welch's boys were
threatening at the time, had been
held twice on the three-yard line,
and were knifed to the quick when
Dana grabbed the ball to put Stan
ford back in possession.
TOUCHDOWN PLAY
The touchdown play that was pre
ceded by Shipkey's burst had an
other prologue. That was Hammett
hurling to end Dave Brown, who
really had to run to catch up and
hold the pigskin that finally settled
in his arms as he half fell, half
stumbled and was finally downed on
the Washington 26-yard line for a
gain of 31 yards.
On the fourth down that followed
Schwartz sent in his screen pass that
Shipkey look from Hammett and
barrelled to the three.

From the three it was Hammett
; himself who scored on a quarter
back sneak behind the forward roll
i of center Milt Vucinich, who snapped
the ball and look Hammett with him
right through the Husky middle.
HUSKIES ROLL
After Stanford manufactured its
second touchdown from Hammett
| to Laverty, the Husky started to roll
j but Dana's interception stymied
{ that, and the Indians went on to their
| final score.
That clinching pay dirt nugget
I came from the piston-driving legs of
| right half Bill "Rock" Shcller. It j
! was Shcller who had coolly tackled
j Arnold Weinmeister on the Stanford
four when he had taken a pass from
I Erickson and was headed for the
promised land.
i After Bruno Banducci recovered
J Susick's fumble and Shipkey and
; Don Zappettini had trembled the :
| Washing forwards to the four- j
! yard mark, Shelter boomed on and
' over Harrison's goal-line tackle for
j six points.
Hank Norberg, improving again ;
j and even better than he appeared
j against Southern California, split
I the uprights for the second time and
I Stanford won, 20-7.
It was difficult to single out even
| those mentioned, for every Indian
! on the field Saturday played cham
; pionship football, and that is not a
4iJniVfrs»t> ir> >si •< v«. (his infor
one-sidcd view.
REGULARS REST
Perhaps, as we once forecast, it
; was the chill weather of San Fran-
I cisco that gave Stanford its added
| oomph to win its second city game.
! Had the Indians played all their
' games for San Francisco fans they

might be topping the conference
right now. As it is Stanford occupies
third place.
Schwartz said last night those who
did not play Saturday would work
out today, while the regulars would
have a much deserved day off from
duty.
Buck Fawcett, who gave a much
needed eight-yard burst during the
second touchdown drive Saturday,
will start next Saturday only if he
is absolutely ready to go full force.
Otherwise Shipkey will remain lead
ing lady at fullback.
LaPRADE OUT
Loren LaPrade, who was sidelined
with a wrenched knee, will remain
hospitalized until the California
game.
Next Saturday Stanford meets
Oregon State, winner Saturday over
Montana, 33-0. The Beavers have
been twice scouted by assistant
Coach Vic Lindskog and once by
cameraman - coach Husky Hunt.
There'll be an unveiling of Beaver
antics this week.
Stanford won't go to the Rose Bowl in January of 1943, but you can bet
your last defense stamp that the Redskins have an all-American player
and that they'll wage a terrific battle with California to regain the coveted
axe, now resting in the halls of Berkeley. Oregon State is Stanford's next
foe on the calendar, but the following week Coach Marchie Schwartz'

footballers point for the Big Game. ■>
As if you didn't know by this time,
that all-American hunk of gridiron
dynamite is Charles Albert Taylor,

is fast gaining himself consideration
on all the all-American teams that

line and a 13-7 lead in the third
quarter.
HAMMETT PASSES
Hammett was just another wall
flower when the game started, sit

| ting on the bench. But when he had
| a good look at the Huskies' 7-man
j defense, he trotted in to perform
lethal footballery that dispelled
Washington's faint hope of staying
in the coast race.
Not only did Hammett pass well,
as in his best days on the practice
field, but his generalship and ball
handling brought to the game that
old sock and smash that seemed
lacking in all his former efforts.
To a muscular Mr. Shipkey, kin to
: the Ted and Harry of Stanford, go
the plaudits of a great game at full
back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
DANA INTERCEPTS
Shipkey suffered a split lip toward\
| the finish and had several stitches
! taken to close the injured kisser.
Sophomore Ross Dana clinched
the left halfback position for him
self with a rousing exhibition that
was topped off when he intercepted
Bob Erickson's heave in the flat just
short of the goal line and raced 42
yards back up the field.
Ralph "Pest" Welch's boys were
threatening at the time, had been
held twice on the three-yard line,
and were knifed to the quick when
Dana grabbed the ball to put Stan
ford back in possession.
TOUCHDOWN PLAY
The touchdown play that was pre
ceded by Shipkey's burst had an
other prologue. That was Hammett
hurling to end Dave Brown, who
really had to run to catch up and
hold the pigskin that finally settled
in his arms as he half fell, half
stumbled and was finally downed on
the Washington 26-yard line for a
gain of 31 yards.
On the fourth down that followed
Schwartz sent in his screen pass that
Shipkey look from Hammett and
barrelled to the three.

From the three it was Hammett
; himself who scored on a quarter
back sneak behind the forward roll
i of center Milt Vucinich, who snapped
the ball and look Hammett with him
right through the Husky middle.
HUSKIES ROLL
After Stanford manufactured its
second touchdown from Hammett
| to Laverty, the Husky started to roll
j but Dana's interception stymied
{ that, and the Indians went on to their
| final score.
That clinching pay dirt nugget
I came from the piston-driving legs of
| right half Bill "Rock" Shcller. It j
! was Shcller who had coolly tackled
j Arnold Weinmeister on the Stanford
four when he had taken a pass from
I Erickson and was headed for the
promised land.
i After Bruno Banducci recovered
J Susick's fumble and Shipkey and
; Don Zappettini had trembled the :

j six points.
Hank Norberg, improving again ;
j and even better than he appeared
j against Southern California, split
I the uprights for the second time and
I Stanford won, 20-7.
It was difficult to single out even

Schwartz said last night those who
did not play Saturday would work
out today, while the regulars would
have a much deserved day off from
duty.
Buck Fawcett, who gave a much
needed eight-yard burst during the
second touchdown drive Saturday,
will start next Saturday only if he
is absolutely ready to go full force.
Otherwise Shipkey will remain lead
ing lady at fullback.

Loren LaPrade, who was sidelined
with a wrenched knee, will remain

game.

Oregon State, winner Saturday over
Montana, 33-0. The Beavers have

Coach Vic Lindskog and once by
cameraman - coach Husky Hunt.
There'll be an unveiling of Beaver

back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
DANA INTERCEPTS
Shipkey suffered a split lip toward\
| the finish and had several stitches
! taken to close the injured kisser.
Sophomore Ross Dana clinched
the left halfback position for him
self with a rousing exhibition that
was topped off when he intercepted
Bob Erickson's heave in the flat just
short of the goal line and raced 42
yards back up the field.
Ralph "Pest" Welch's boys were
threatening at the time, had been
held twice on the three-yard line,
and were knifed to the quick when
Dana grabbed the ball to put Stan
ford back in possession.
TOUCHDOWN PLAY
The touchdown play that was pre
ceded by Shipkey's burst had an
other prologue. That was Hammett
hurling to end Dave Brown, who
really had to run to catch up and
hold the pigskin that finally settled
in his arms as he half fell, half
stumbled and was finally downed on
the Washington 26-yard line for a
gain of 31 yards.
On the fourth down that followed
Schwartz sent in his screen pass that
Shipkey look from Hammett and
barrelled to the three.

From the three it was Hammett
; himself who scored on a quarter
back sneak behind the forward roll
i of center Milt Vucinich, who snapped
the ball and look Hammett with him
right through the Husky middle.
HUSKIES ROLL
After Stanford manufactured its
second touchdown from Hammett
| to Laverty, the Husky started to roll
j but Dana's interception stymied
{ that, and the Indians went on to their
| final score.
That clinching pay dirt nugget
I came from the piston-driving legs of
| right half Bill "Rock" Shcller. It j
! was Shcller who had coolly tackled
j Arnold Weinmeister on the Stanford
four when he had taken a pass from
I Erickson and was headed for the
promised land.
i After Bruno Banducci recovered
J Susick's fumble and Shipkey and
; Don Zappettini had trembled the :

j six points.
Hank Norberg, improving again ;
j and even better than he appeared
j against Southern California, split
I the uprights for the second time and
I Stanford won, 20-7.
It was difficult to single out even

; pionship football, and that is not a
4iJniVfrs»t> ir> >si •< v«. (his infor

REGULARS REST
Perhaps, as we once forecast, it

I cisco that gave Stanford its added
| oomph to win its second city game.
! Had the Indians played all their
' games for San Francisco fans they

might be topping the conference
right now. As it is Stanford occupies
third place.
Schwartz said last night those who
did not play Saturday would work
out today, while the regulars would
have a much deserved day off from
duty.
Buck Fawcett, who gave a much
needed eight-yard burst during the
second touchdown drive Saturday,
will start next Saturday only if he
is absolutely ready to go full force.
Otherwise Shipkey will remain lead
ing lady at fullback.
LaPRADE OUT
Loren LaPrade, who was sidelined
with a wrenched knee, will remain
hospitalized until the California
game.
Next Saturday Stanford meets
Oregon State, winner Saturday over
Montana, 33-0. The Beavers have
been twice scouted by assistant
Coach Vic Lindskog and once by
cameraman - coach Husky Hunt.
There'll be an unveiling of Beaver
antics this week.
Stanford won't go to the Rose Bowl in January of 1943, but you can bet
your last defense stamp that the Redskins have an all-American player
and that they'll wage a terrific battle with California to regain the coveted
axe, now resting in the halls of Berkeley. Oregon State is Stanford's next
foe on the calendar, but the following week Coach Marchie Schwartz'

footballers point for the Big Game. ■>
As if you didn't know by this time,
that all-American hunk of gridiron
dynamite is Charles Albert Taylor,
the Indians' prize left guard who at
one game past the mid-season mark
is fast gaining himself consideration
on all the all-American teams that
always flood the nations' sporting
pages and magazines every year
around the middle of December.
ALL-AMERICAN BATTLE
It was the fiery red-haired Taylor
who swept aside Pete Susick for
fullback Art Shipkey's 23-yard
ramble to the 3-yard line, just be
fore Stanford bucked over to tie
Washington, 7-7, at the half, in Sat
urday's contest in San Francisco.
Again it was Taylor who won a
battle of all-Americans to be sure,
against center Walt Harrison of the
Huskies.
Taylor worked on Harrison as the
big Husky will never be worked on
again. Charles Albert had his day,
but it was not all his.
There was Captain Ray Hammett,
pitching a perfect strike to Roger
Laverty, who scurried to the goal
line and a 13-7 lead in the third
quarter.
HAMMETT PASSES
Hammett was just another wall
flower when the game started, sit

| ting on the bench. But when he had
| a good look at the Huskies' 7-man
j defense, he trotted in to perform
lethal footballery that dispelled
Washington's faint hope of staying
in the coast race.
Not only did Hammett pass well,
as in his best days on the practice
field, but his generalship and ball
handling brought to the game that
old sock and smash that seemed
lacking in all his former efforts.
To a muscular Mr. Shipkey, kin to
: the Ted and Harry of Stanford, go
the plaudits of a great game at full
back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
