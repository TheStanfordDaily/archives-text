# Taylor Looms as All-American; Indians Trounce Huskies, 20-7
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford won't go to the Rose Bowl in January of 1943, but you can bet
your last defense stamp that the Redskins have an all-American player
and that they'll wage a terrific battle with California to regain the coveted
axe, now resting in the halls of Berkeley. Oregon State is Stanford's next
foe on the calendar, but the following week Coach Marchie Schwartz'

footballers point for the Big Game. ■>
As if you didn't know by this time,
that all-American hunk of gridiron
dynamite is Charles Albert Taylor,
the Indians' prize left guard who at
one game past the mid-season mark
is fast gaining himself consideration
on all the all-American teams that
always flood the nations' sporting
pages and magazines every year
around the middle of December.
ALL-AMERICAN BATTLE
It was the fiery red-haired Taylor
who swept aside Pete Susick for
fullback Art Shipkey's 23-yard
ramble to the 3-yard line, just be
fore Stanford bucked over to tie
Washington, 7-7, at the half, in Sat
urday's contest in San Francisco.
Again it was Taylor who won a
battle of all-Americans to be sure,
against center Walt Harrison of the
Huskies.
Taylor worked on Harrison as the
big Husky will never be worked on
again. Charles Albert had his day,
but it was not all his.
There was Captain Ray Hammett,
pitching a perfect strike to Roger
Laverty, who scurried to the goal
line and a 13-7 lead in the third
quarter.
HAMMETT PASSES
Hammett was just another wall
flower when the game started, sit

| ting on the bench. But when he had
| a good look at the Huskies' 7-man
j defense, he trotted in to perform
lethal footballery that dispelled
Washington's faint hope of staying
in the coast race.
Not only did Hammett pass well,
as in his best days on the practice
field, but his generalship and ball
handling brought to the game that
old sock and smash that seemed
lacking in all his former efforts.
To a muscular Mr. Shipkey, kin to
: the Ted and Harry of Stanford, go
the plaudits of a great game at full
back. Shipkey picked up a three
j yard per play average in 11 tries
I while illustrating a hard-driving
running technique remindful of the
days when Norm Standlee full
backed Stanford.
DANA INTERCEPTS
Shipkey suffered a split lip toward\
| the finish and had several stitches
! taken to close the injured kisser.
Sophomore Ross Dana clinched
the left halfback position for him
self with a rousing exhibition that
was topped off when he intercepted
Bob Erickson's heave in the flat just
short of the goal line and raced 42
yards back up the field.
