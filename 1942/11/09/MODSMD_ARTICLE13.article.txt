# Beet Topping Crews Harvest 304,200 Lbs.
## Money Winner Still Unknown in SAE, Phi Psi, ATO Wager 
### 
The first week of Stanford beet
harvest ended yesterday, with stu
dent teams topping a grand total of
304,200 pounds of beets.
Suspense reigned last night, when
Harley Jenecke, ran c h owner,
brought the figures of the Phi Psi-
ATO-SAE competition into the SWB
officeâ€”and suspense still reigns, as
interpretation of the facts is dis
puted.
The problem rests with a verbal
agreement made between the three
houses, who wagered a day's wages
on their afternoon's work. The
agreement purportedly was that the
team topping the greatest tonnage of
beets by 5 p.m. would be the v/inner.
SMALLER FIELD
But an unexpected factor was the
fact that the ATO's, who topped
more beets per hour, were given a
smaller field than the Phi Psi's, and
consequently topped a smaller day's
total. The SAE team fell behind both
teams, and there is definitely elimi
nated from consideration.
The most productive team, re
gardless of the three-way contest, is
the Zete crew, which topped 28.000
pounds of beets yesterday, and thus
holds the lead for a trophy to be
awarded to the best team at the end
of the season by ranch owner Je
necke. Running second are the Al
pha Delts (25,315 pounds) and the
Alpha Sigs (25,000 pounds).
SECOND ROUND BEGINS
The second round of beet topping
will begin today, when the Theta
Chi and Breaker teams will leave
for the fields. According to Olaf
Moline, ranch foreman, the harvest
will last at least another week, and
perhaps longer, depending upon the
work done this week.
Sandwiches have been made for
the boys each afternoon by Mrs.
Jenecke. Teams leave each after
noon at 12:45 by trucks provided by
the ranch. Another 100 acres re
main to be harvested.
