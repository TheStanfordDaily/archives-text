# Diploma Dimes Roll Tonight
## Quota-Breaking Drive Has Reached $1,400 
### 
Collectors will be calling on living
groups again tonight to support the
Stanford of post-war years.
"Dimes for Diplomas" is based on
the maxim that a Stanford man who
thinks enough of his country to
leave his school for the armed serv
ices should have a school that thinks
enough of him to aid his return when
his job is over.
Seemingly none in Stanford dis
agrees with this proposition. Every
week this quarter the $100 quota
has been broken, if not by much, by
a quotable margin; about $1,400 of
the $5,500 sum desired has already
been donated in two and one-half
quarters.
Computed on existing tuition
rates, nine and eight-tenths Stan
ford men have been assured of a
ticket along the road back, i.e., a
Stanford degree.
By the quarter's end, Ted Barr
and his committee expect about
$1,900 in the fund.
