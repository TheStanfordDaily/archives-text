# Stocks Hit Peak In Active Trading

NEW YORK, Nov. 8 (UP).
Stocks advanced last week to the
highest general level since Nov. 24.
1941, in the most active trading of
the year to date.
Impressiveness of the rally was
marked, however, by sluggish tend
encies in the rails and by the fact
that stocks "celebrated" the Re
publican sweep in Tuesday's elec
tions to a much lesser extent than
had been anticipated by most trad
ers.
