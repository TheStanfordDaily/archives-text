# ALGIERS SURRENDERS TO AMERICANS
## Battles Rage as U.S. Troops Drive Deep into French Africa 
### 
ALLIED NORTH AFRICAN HEADQUARTERS, Nov. S (UP).â€”Hos
tilities ceased in Algiers today and American forces will occupy the key
points in the city and its immediate defenses at dawn tomorrow, Allied
headquarters announced tonight.
An armistice was negotiated by the French garrison commander at

.Algiers and Major General Charles
W. Ryder of the U.S. forces. De
tails of the armistice will be worked
out tomorrow.
Earlier reports said that heavy
fighting raged at some points dur
ing the American landings in North
Africa, but that everywhere the
operations were proceeding rap
idly.
STIFI EST RESISTANCE
The initial assaults were made on
Algiers, Oran and the Atlantic coast
of Morocco. Admiral Jean Francois
Darlan's naval units put up the
stifTest resistance at all three places.
But there was no indication the
bulk of the French navy yet had
entered the picture.
Reports to headquarters indicated
that the resistance was concen
trated at three points, but there was
none whatever elsewhere and as
soon as the Americans landed they
thrust on into the interior.
The first objectives of the entire
assult, Fort Side, Faeeuba and Ain
taya west of Algiers where Maj.
Gen. Lloyd R. Fredendall was com
manding the eastern forces, were
taken without a struggle.
That was followed immediately
by an assault on the Maison
Blanche and Blida airdromes. The
Maison Blanche surrendered, and
Blida was taken by a United States
combat force including the famous
American Rangers.
AIR COVER GOOD
The United States Army Air
Force and the Royal Air Force
moved in, giving the American
troops cover with fighter planes.
' Air officials reported no intense
; Axis air activity in the entire bat
tle area, though there was some
bombing of shipping.
At Algiers and Oran in the cen
tral area under the command of
American General Ryder, still op
position was encountered from the
coastal defenses. French colonial
navy units came out of th e harbors
| and were fired upon immediately,
! after which they retired, suffering
"some" losses.
The British navy lost two small
j craft, but the personnel presumably
reached shore.
