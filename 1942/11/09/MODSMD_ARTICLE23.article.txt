# Battered Nazis Flee Across Libyan Border
## 
### 
CAIRO. Nov. 8 (UP).—The sur
viving bulk of Field Marshal Er
win Rommel's shattered Africa
Corps has crossed the border into
Libya and the battle for Egypt has
ended in a smashing Allied triumph
assuming greater proportions each
hour, it was announced tonight.
It was estimated that of his origi
nal 140,000 troops, Rommel now
had but 25,000 to 30,000 available
to him for future action, all the
others having been killed or cap
tured or awaiting capture as quick
ly as the Imperials get around to
picking them up.
(A British broadcast heard by
United Press in New York said that,
"it is now known that the British
have captured six entire Italian in
fantry divisions"—probably around
75,000 men.)
A straggling Axis tank force had
tried to fight a delaying action at
Mcrsa Matruh, 125 miles cast of
the border, but it was quickly
flanked and the Allied advance
spearhead is now well westward of
that point in its pursuit of the fast
disintegrating enemy, a British
communique said.
