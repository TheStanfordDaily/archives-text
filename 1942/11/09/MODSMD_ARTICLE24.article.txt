Right behind in the scoring came the First Moor and Basement, en-

tcred as one team, with 38 points,
followed by Second Floor with 28.
the Fifth with 21, and the Third
with 18.
Aside from Fesss speedy cen
tury, efforts were mediocre, the
only exception being in the broad
jump where R. Carr leaped 21 ft.
2\j in. for first place. Carr also
won the 180-yard low hurdles in
19.7 seconds.

freshmen out for track did not
compete.
