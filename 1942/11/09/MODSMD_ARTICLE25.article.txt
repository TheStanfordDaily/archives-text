# Toros Retain Clean Record
## 
### 
A last-minute touchdown by
Carlos Brown kept El Toro in the
rapidly diminishing intramural un
defeated ranks Friday. Theta Xi
was the victim, 7-0, as Brown, with
George Tolman throwing a key
block on the one-yard line, scored
on an end run from the four. Tol
man drop-kicked the extra point.
El Cuadro likewise remained un
defeated, whipping Medical School
19-0. Bob Fair, as usual, passed the
Cuadros to victory.
In a game featured by a new
style of officiating, Branner de
feated Co-op House 13-0. The Co-

op seven, in launching a protest,
stated that the referee was not a
regular one and therefore was not
fully acquainted with intramural
grid rules.
In the other scheduled Friday
games, D.U. received a default de
cision from S.A.E. as did Los Arcos
from Page Mill Road. Phi Psi and
Theta Chi rescheduled their con
test for Tuesday because of beet
picking.
Two Encina teams went into ac
tion in the mud and rain Sunday.
Three E defeated 4E, 14-7, in a re
seheduk'd battle. George Jones and
Don Duncan scored the two 3E
touchdowns, while Bob Seff went
over for 4E's lone counter.
