# Stanford Fencers Lose Two Bouts
## 
### 
Stanford's fencing team lost a
double-header in San Francisco
Friday night, losing to the Olympic
Club 5-4 and to the Oakland Ath
letic Club 7-2. Coach Elwyn Bugge
said both opponents were too ex
perienced for the Indians to have
much of a chance. Stanford's team
included Harvard Lomax, Alan Hed
den, John Carr. and Jack Rees.
"Despite these losses, we are
pointing for Cal whom we meet
Nov. 20," the coach declared, adding
that experience wouldn't be against
the Farm men when they face the
Bears.
