# Good Omen: Papooses Scuttle Cubs, 14-7
## Merriman Scores Both Touchdowns 
### ED LUCE 
There were only 3000 persons
watching, but Stanford's frosh
gridders turned in a real "Big
Game" performance Saturday in
California Memorial Stadium, out
playing completely the California
frosh for a 14-7 victory in the 36th
renewal of the classic.
The San Francisco Chronicle
called the outcome an upset, and
said that two quick scoring thrusts
"gave" the Papeese their win. The
Chronicle was wrong both times.
True, somebody had picked the
Cubs. They were supposed to have
a better record, but no one in En
cina ever gave the Cubs a chance,
and the football team certainly
didn't.
MERRIMAN SCORES TWICE
Stanford did garner its two
touchdowns on thrusts. Lloyd
Merriman (the Cal program listed
him as Frank "Merriwell" Merri
man) spun off right guard on the
Cards' first scrimmage play for 28
yards and a touchdown. "Merri
well" also scored the other, taking
a 30-yard pass from Buck Brown
son and straight-arming his way
across the goal.
But we can't say, as the Chronicle
did. that these two offensive mas
terpieces, and they were beauts,
"gave" the Papeese the win. What
about the great line play of Dick
Madigan and Ed Gunderson, and
that of Dick Flatland until he was
knocked out with a slight concus
sion and removed to the hospital?
WHOLE TEAM SHINES
The backs, particularly Steve
Tish and Brownson along with
Merriman, played fine ball as did
every Papoose on the field. In other
words, everybody was in on the
victory.
The story of the game, the 15th
time the Stanford frosh have
whipped the Cal Cubs in 36 years
of trying, goes something like this.
On the strength of Merriman's
28-yard gallop and Tish's subse
quent conversion, Stanford led, 7-0,
near the end of the second quarter.
With sub Archie Wilson and Cap
tain Newell Oestrich leading the
way, the Cubs started to move from
their own 46.
CUBS' PASS TALLIES
The drive went to the nine on a
combination of passes and plunges,
where Wilson heaved to end Carr
Rowland in the end zone. Oestrich
converted with 30 seconds left in
the half, and the two clubs had to
start all over.
The Papeese did, after Tish had
brought the second half kickoff
back to the Stanford 49. Here
Brownson faded, threw to Merri
nwm and the count, with Tish con
verting, was 14-7.
THIRD GOAL RECALLED
The official scoring was over, but
a few fireworks still remained.
Driving for a game - clinching
touchdown, the Papeese went to the
Cal 26 in the fourth period, where
Jay McKie pitched to Merriman in
the end zone. The play was called
back, however, and the ball given
to the Cubs be cause McKie was
not live yards behind the scrim
mage line.
A few minutes later Cal half Paul
Keckley swept the Papoose right
end from his own 14, was out in the
clear until Merriman ran him out
of bounds on the Stanford 38. But
the Cub threat was stopped here
and the teams pushed back and
forth at midfield until the final gun.

man) spun off right guard on the
Cards' first scrimmage play for 28
yards and a touchdown. "Merri
well" also scored the other, taking
a 30-yard pass from Buck Brown
son and straight-arming his way
across the goal.
But we can't say, as the Chronicle
did. that these two offensive mas
terpieces, and they were beauts,
"gave" the Papeese the win. What
about the great line play of Dick
Madigan and Ed Gunderson, and
that of Dick Flatland until he was
knocked out with a slight concus
sion and removed to the hospital?
WHOLE TEAM SHINES
The backs, particularly Steve
Tish and Brownson along with
Merriman, played fine ball as did
every Papoose on the field. In other
words, everybody was in on the
victory.
The story of the game, the 15th
time the Stanford frosh have
whipped the Cal Cubs in 36 years
of trying, goes something like this.
On the strength of Merriman's
28-yard gallop and Tish's subse
quent conversion, Stanford led, 7-0,
near the end of the second quarter.
With sub Archie Wilson and Cap
tain Newell Oestrich leading the
way, the Cubs started to move from
their own 46.
CUBS' PASS TALLIES
The drive went to the nine on a
combination of passes and plunges,
where Wilson heaved to end Carr
Rowland in the end zone. Oestrich
converted with 30 seconds left in
the half, and the two clubs had to
start all over.
The Papeese did, after Tish had
brought the second half kickoff
back to the Stanford 49. Here
Brownson faded, threw to Merri
nwm and the count, with Tish con
verting, was 14-7.
THIRD GOAL RECALLED
The official scoring was over, but
a few fireworks still remained.
Driving for a game - clinching
touchdown, the Papeese went to the
Cal 26 in the fourth period, where
Jay McKie pitched to Merriman in
the end zone. The play was called
back, however, and the ball given
to the Cubs be cause McKie was
not live yards behind the scrim
mage line.
A few minutes later Cal half Paul
Keckley swept the Papoose right
end from his own 14, was out in the
clear until Merriman ran him out
of bounds on the Stanford 38. But
the Cub threat was stopped here
and the teams pushed back and
forth at midfield until the final gun.
There were only 3000 persons
watching, but Stanford's frosh
gridders turned in a real "Big
Game" performance Saturday in
California Memorial Stadium, out
playing completely the California
frosh for a 14-7 victory in the 36th
renewal of the classic.
The San Francisco Chronicle
called the outcome an upset, and
said that two quick scoring thrusts
"gave" the Papeese their win. The
Chronicle was wrong both times.
True, somebody had picked the
Cubs. They were supposed to have
a better record, but no one in En
cina ever gave the Cubs a chance,
and the football team certainly
didn't.
MERRIMAN SCORES TWICE
Stanford did garner its two
touchdowns on thrusts. Lloyd
Merriman (the Cal program listed
him as Frank "Merriwell" Merri
man) spun off right guard on the
Cards' first scrimmage play for 28
yards and a touchdown. "Merri
