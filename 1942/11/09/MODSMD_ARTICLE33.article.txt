# Spartans Down Card Kickers
## 
### 
San Jose State took a long step in
its march to the California State
Soccer Conference when they de
feated Stanford University last Sat
urday morning on Harry Maloney
playing field 2-0.
Don Racoosin, center forward,
paced the Spartans to victory by
scoring the two goals, both in the
first half. Stanford's offense was not
up to par, but was further hindered
by the great goal guarding of the San
Jose captain who booted the ball
constantly over 60 yards in the air.
Louis Chang, center forward on
the Indians, injured his leg and had
to be helped off the field. Outstand
ing for Stanford was the defensive
combination of George Koffer, cen
ter half, fullback Hank Peters, and
goalie Keith Pinion.
Friday afternoon Menlo Junior
College whipped the Stanford frosh
by two goals in the final period for a
4-2 victory.
Bob DeMott, scored both the frosh
goals, one on a penalty kick to give
Stanford a 1-0 lead and one on a
short shot from center to tie the
game up at 2-2 before the end of the
half. Ronny Bishop at center half
and the fullbacks Carl long and
Fritz Hertzog played great defensive
games for the frosh.
