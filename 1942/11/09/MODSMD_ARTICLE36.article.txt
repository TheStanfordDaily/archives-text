# S.A.E. Drubs Toyon Bowlers

### 
S.A.E.'s keglers showed little
mercy to the rest of the field as they
swept to a 4-0 shutout over a com
pletely outclassed and undermanned
Toyon five in yesterday's College
Bowling League.
The four-point margin of victory
lengthened the S.A.E.'s lead in the
standings, as two deadlocked second
place teams, Frosh and Alpha Sigs,
split their match in the feature battle
of the day.
The Frosh grabbed an early lead
by taking the first game, while Al
pha Sigs came right back with a
strong 800 game total to nab the sec
ond, and continued, with a 23 pin
margin victory in the final game.
The Frosh gained an even break by
taking total pins. Gene Foster's 196
was high for the Sigs, while A1
Baldwin's 187 line topped the Frosh.
Sigma Nu came out of their leth
argy long enough to take a 3-1 de
cision away from the Betas. Feature
of this math was a 540 series by Hal
Lamb of Sigma Nu.
Branner came into contention by
completely outclassing the Fiji team
3-1 in a drab contest. Cal Antrum's
175 was high game for the Fiji's,
while the best Branner could do was
a 164 game rung up by A1 Olech.
