# ACTION ON AFRICAN FRONT

### 

AUSTRALIAN SOLDIERS "dropped to earth in a hell of a hurry" when the ammunition bin
in this captured German tank caught fire and exploded in the smoldering ruins. Although
there's no cover higher than the tallest sand-dune in the desert fighting, the Aussies made
good use of that, for none of them was injured.
