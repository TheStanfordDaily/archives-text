# Perfect Physical Specimen Discovered in 'Zeteland' Haunt
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ Daily Feature Editor 
Once upon a time up in that forbidden territory! known as "Zeteland"
there lived a member of that almost extinct species, the Perfect Physical
Specimen. His name was liob Ullman. 5 feet 8 inches and 185 pounds
of solid muscle.
And one day Bob took bis 185 pounds of muscle over to the B.A.C.

and ran through Dr. Esslinger's,
Physical Fitness Tests. He not only
. ran ihrough the tests, but ran over
all the other participants. He came
out with a score of (560, which was
higher than any turned in by the
men and football players of Stan
ford University.
Through his exhibition in the Fit
ness Tests Bob has earned his de
served title of "Superman of Zete
land." Quiet and unimpressed by
the fame his physical prowess has
brought him, Bob insists that he
was just lucky. "I played a lot of
football and ran the low hurdles
when I was in high school, but
! since I've been at Stanford I haven't
i had much time to do a lot of train-
I ing." â™¦
FIRST LOVE'
Athletics are Enb's filrst love,
j however, and he's equally at home
on the football and track field. To
him ;i 11 sports are games and should
| be played for the sheer enjoyment
1 of them and the thrill of competi
j tion.
"Intramural football is my main
I interest right now," Bob said, and
I think it's wonderful training for
I any man interested in competitive
j athletics."
The story of Bob and Uncle Sam
| is a real paradox and there was a
! look of irony on his face as he told
J it. "I made high score in the tests
here at school, but flunked all my
physicals for the Army and Navy
reserve." He went on to explain
I that an early injury playing foot
ball caused him to have lower than
I average vision in one eye. He's
[ trying for the Marine Corps now
and thinks he'll be able to pass the
! physical for that branch of the
l service.
LEADS NORMAL LIFE
When asked about the origins of
j his excellent physical condition Bob
I stated that athletics have always
come easy to him. He likes to par
i ticipate in sports and thinks that
j the co-ordination necessary is an
i inborn trait. He leads a perfectly
normal life, doesn't live on Wheat
, ies, and is not above an occasional
1 night out.
His favorite athletes are Jim
i Thorpe and Kenny Washington. He
j thinks women in competitive ath
letics are silly. And he still doesn't
, understand how he made the high-
I est score in the Physical Fitness
I Tests.
