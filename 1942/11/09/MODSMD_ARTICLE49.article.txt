# Road to Victory
## 
### 
THE Allied offensive in Africa is the first real
heartening news we've had since the war
broke out in 1939. Many people think that we're
already marching well along on the road to
victory, and that in a few more months the
war will be over.
Those people are mistaken. We've only be
gun to set foot on the road to victory. It's a
long road and we're going to have to fight every
inch of the way.
The African invasion is not a second front,
but is the necessary prerequisite to a second
front. When all resistance is shattered in Af
rica, then we can hope to establish a second
front in Europe. For only by beating the Ger
man armies in Europe can we hope to knock
the Nazis out of the war.
That job, and the job of beating the Japs in
the Pacific, will take lots of time and the cost
will be enormous. For we have just undertaken
the offensive—American losses have been very
small compared to what we can expect before
the war is won.
There is no reason for us to pat ourselves on
the back and claim a great military triumph
when we conquer French West Africa and fi
nally dispose of Rommel. The credit for making
these campaigns possible goes to the Russians
and Chinese who have been shouldering the
brunt of the Allied war effort for years.
The Russians have held in check the might
of the best German armies for two years, the
Chinese have withstood the Jap onslaughts for
ten years. By the sacrifice of more than 10,000,-
000 men, women and children killed, the Rus
sians and Chinese have held the fort until we
were ready to fight.
Now we are ready—the African campaign
proves that. With the British, we must furnish
the men and materials for the drive down the
road to final victory.
Although the victories of the past few weeks
are sweet music to the ears of a people who
have been constantly on the defensive, we
should not magnify them so much that we dis
tract our attention from the main job ahead.
We are finally starting on the road to victory;
we must let nothing hinder us from our final
goal.—Charlie Allen

we must let nothing hinder us from our final
goal.—Charlie Allen
THE Allied offensive in Africa is the first real
heartening news we've had since the war
broke out in 1939. Many people think that we're
already marching well along on the road to
victory, and that in a few more months the
war will be over.
Those people are mistaken. We've only be
gun to set foot on the road to victory. It's a
long road and we're going to have to fight every
inch of the way.
The African invasion is not a second front,
but is the necessary prerequisite to a second
front. When all resistance is shattered in Af
rica, then we can hope to establish a second
front in Europe. For only by beating the Ger
man armies in Europe can we hope to knock
the Nazis out of the war.
That job, and the job of beating the Japs in
the Pacific, will take lots of time and the cost
will be enormous. For we have just undertaken
the offensive—American losses have been very
small compared to what we can expect before
the war is won.
There is no reason for us to pat ourselves on
the back and claim a great military triumph
when we conquer French West Africa and fi
nally dispose of Rommel. The credit for making
these campaigns possible goes to the Russians
and Chinese who have been shouldering the
brunt of the Allied war effort for years.
The Russians have held in check the might
of the best German armies for two years, the
Chinese have withstood the Jap onslaughts for
ten years. By the sacrifice of more than 10,000,-
000 men, women and children killed, the Rus
sians and Chinese have held the fort until we
were ready to fight.
Now we are ready—the African campaign
proves that. With the British, we must furnish
the men and materials for the drive down the
road to final victory.
Although the victories of the past few weeks
are sweet music to the ears of a people who
have been constantly on the defensive, we
should not magnify them so much that we dis
tract our attention from the main job ahead.
We are finally starting on the road to victory;
we must let nothing hinder us from our final
goal.—Charlie Allen
