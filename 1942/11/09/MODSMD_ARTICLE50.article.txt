With an ear to Stanford's dramatic grounds,
I discovered that the Drama Department is this
year determined to present plays concerned
primarily with the war. "The Eve of St. Mark,"
it seems, is only the opening shot in what is
supposed to turn into a year-long barrage. Now,
maybe I don't know very much about the thea
ter, and I know darn well that I know nothing
about Stanford's dramatic department, but it
would seem to me that the tossing of a lot of
direct propaganda at the Farm's student body
is something of a mistake. I sort of have a
hunch that the functions of the theater—in war
just as much as in peace are entertainment
and intellectual stimulation.
Entertainment, I think, is the emotional satis
faction which one derives from a play; intel
lectual stimulation is the thought which a play
provokes.

Now, I don't know just how to say this, but
I have the feeling that throwing a lot of propa
ganda at Stanford men and women is neither
particularly entertaining nor mentally stimu
lating. Certainly a propaganda play, if it is ef
fective, cannot be intellectually stimulating, for
the whole point of propaganda, I think, is to
stultify the mental processes. But if the play is
not effective propaganda, then it probably is
not good entertainment. Under either circum
stance, a propaganda play does not fulfill the
full functions of the theater.
That is why I, for one, would like to see a
little of the old-time good stuff. Some Ibsen or
Shakespeare, perhaps, maybe even Sophocles
or Euripides. And in the modern line, how
about G. B. Shaw or Gerhardt Hauptmann or
Clifford Odets. And in the comedy line, per
haps the high moguls of the drama department
might even be able to throw in a little Wycher
ley or Congreve or Shadwell or Sheridan or
Goldsmith.
These £re just ideas.

Of interest is the Stanford fraternity which
has just recently decided to give $2.50 a week
as a house to the purchase of war stamps. Con
sidering that previous to this time, the house
had bought no war stamps at all, this indicates
real improvement. The house now can each
week boast that instead of making 0 per cent
of its possible weekly quota, it is now making
33 1/3 per cent. I'll bet brothers Albert and
Burness, both serving with the Navy now, are
real proud of this achievement.
