## A 						DANCE, PLEASE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I'm a last quarter senior. There must be a
hundred others of you who also graduate at
the end of this quarter, but so far there isn't a
single event planned to mark our graduation. I
think a dance exclusively for last quarter seniors
is in order. I know a lot of other kids in my
position feel the same way, so let's have one.
If you're interested, we could get a committee
working on it right away. Please let me know
what you think about it.—lrving Fine, Box 1196.
