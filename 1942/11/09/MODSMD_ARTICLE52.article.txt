# WILBUR SPEECH
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
With one 18-year-old exception, all the Stan
ford students with whom I have spoken are
struck by the reckless way in which the Chan
cellor sounds off when he gets to the big city.
Already there is sufficient cause for people
feeling that college students are dodging the
war; families with money can enlist their sons
in comfortable army and navy reserves and
send them off to college; whereas, the poor must
send junior to war. The college is thrown in
an even more unfavorable light when Dr. Wil
bur calls the draft of 18 and 19-year-old a "na
tional disgrace" and adds that the measure
would cause a drop in the Stanford enrollment.
I have not seen the full text of the address, but
it sounds as if the Chancellor considers the
enrollment of this school an issue of impor
tance as compared with the war effort.
Dr. Wilbur asks, "Where will we get our
engineers and doctors for the winning of this
most technical war?" As for the doctors at least,
it is very improbable that any of 1943's 18 and
19-year-olds could be trained for this war un
less it lasts past 1948.
If the professors are worried about their jobs,
let them busy themselves with Dr. Wilbur's
make-work projects for intellectuals rather than
keep an army of the best young material out of
action. â€”William C. Garrett. ,
