# ERROL OR EGYPT?

### 
The Editor, Sir:
There has been some recent talk that Stan
ford students are not as sufficiently interested
in the progress of the war as they should be.
I'm not going to try to settle the argument, but
last week I overheard something which may
provide some hint as to just how we stand on
this matter.
One of Encina's serious-minded freshmen
approached one of Encina's serious-minded
sponsors early last Friday morning. With a
frown on his face the serious-minded freshman
complained that he hadn't received his morning
paper.
"What's so terribly bad about that?" the
serious-minded sponsor asked.
"Well, heck, I wanted to find out how things
are coming out," was the reply.
The now less serious sponsor then said, "Oh,
you mean the Errol Flynn case?"
The still serious-minded freshman, still frown
ing, answered, "NO, EGYPT."
Admitedly, this response is a pretty jolting
surprise. It is a bigger and more pleasant sur
prise, however, to hear that some of the students
may be keeping up with the war by means
other than by following Terry and the Pirates
and Smilin' lack in the papers, and Errol Flynn
who does a pretty good job of chasing the Nazis
in the movie houses.—Ray Hayes, '46.
