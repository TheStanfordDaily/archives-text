# Skelton, Sothern Do Not 'Dood It' in New Musical
## 
### 
"Panama Ilattie" now playing at the Stanford.
Ann Southern and Keel Skelton. supported by many known entertainers
including Hen lilue. Hags Ragland, Marsha Hunt, the Berry Brothers, and
Virginia O'Brien have tried to make a musical comedy into a good picture
but they didn't "dood it." As in many musicals, the plot was very weak,

the song and dance routines at
tempted to make up for the defi
ciency.
Three spy-conscious sailors, Red,
Rags, and Ben, whose chief object is
to protect Hattie succeed only in
bawling up her love affair with Dan
Daily Jr., a soldier who happens to
wander into the picture because he
is stationed in the Canal Jone.
HUMOROUS EPISODES
The unholy three discover a note
which leads them to the capture of a
spy ring but only after a number of
rather humorous episodes common
to the Skelton brand of picture, in
cluding secret panels, swinging wall
sections, and general confusion.
In the song and dance department,
the audience is continually amazed
at the contortions exhibited in the
dancing style of the Berry Brothers.
In a very amusing haunted house
episode, Ben, Rags, and Red do a
nice routine based on the good
neighbor policy, and in this number,
each dances in his own style which
proves to be an unusual and comic
combination.
SECOND FEATURE
Throughout the entire picture,
whenever these three are together,
things seem to roll along. Singing is
adequately handled by Lena Horne,
the "dead pan" Virginia O'Brien,
and Miss Southern.
In *the inevitable second feature,
"Spy Ship," enough gun powder is
wasted to supply a Marine in a busy
week. In this melodramatic plot
spies sabotage the U.S.; newspaper
men sabotage spies, and then some
body gets the girl. 'Twas ever thus.
