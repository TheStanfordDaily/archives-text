# U.S. Troops Drive Deep Wedges Into Algeria; FDR Censures Laval
## President Accuses French of Acting At Nazis' Bidding 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. !) (UP).—
President Roosevelt tonight ac
cuscd French Chief «if Government
Pierre Laval of doing Hitler's bid
ding in breaking off relations with
the United States, but declared that
"no act of Hitler, or any of his
puppets, can sever relations be
tween the American people and the
people of France."
The President's statement came
as a climax to a series of decisive
diplomatic steps taken by this gov
ernment on the home front while
the armed forces pressed the inva
sion of North Africa.
"We have not broken relations
with the French," Mr. Roosevelt
said in a statement. "We never
will.
SYMPATHY FOR FRENCH
"This government will continue
as heretofore to devote its thought,
its sympathy and its aid to the
rescue of the 45,000,000 people of
France from enslavement and from
a permanent loss of their liberties
and free institutions."
Mr. Roosevelt placed the blame
for the severance squarely upon
Laval.
"He is evidently still speaking
the language prescribed by Hitler."
he declared. He added that he re
gretted Laval's action severing re
lations but that "the government of
the United States can do nothing
about this severance of relations
on the part of the Vichy govern
ment."
NO DECLARATION
Secretary of State Cordell Hull
said significantly that for the time
being a declaration of war was not
involved.
Further emphasizing United
States contempt for Nazi-domi
nated Vichy, Hull did not even wait
for Henry-Haye to call for his pass
port. He sent George S. Summer
lin, chief of protocol, to deliver it
even before the envoy's govern
ment had notified him that rela
tions were broken.
But the scope of current opera
tions goes beyond North Africa.
Hull said at a press conference that
the American campaign "is the
first and preliminary step in our
plans ... to come to the relief of
all enslaved peopjes in Europe, in
cluding France."
ENEMY TERRITORY
Immediately after the break with
Vichy there were these develop
ments:
1. The Treasury designated un
ocupied France as "enemy terri
tory."
2. The United States began tak
ing protective custody of Vichy
merchant ships in American ports.
3. Hull said the invasion of North
Africa has had no effect on current
negotiations for the demilitariza
tion of Martinique and other
French colonies.
4. Hull said it was too early to
I discuss the question of an exchange
lof diplomatic personnel between
j Vichy and the United States but
I he indicated the question would be
taken up very soon.
| 5. He was somewhat evasive
| whether American diplomatic rec-
I ognition now would be extended to
I the Fighting French movement
headed by Gen. Charles de Gaulle.

as heretofore to devote its thought,
its sympathy and its aid to the
rescue of the 45,000,000 people of
France from enslavement and from
a permanent loss of their liberties
and free institutions."
Mr. Roosevelt placed the blame
for the severance squarely upon
Laval.
"He is evidently still speaking
the language prescribed by Hitler."
he declared. He added that he re
gretted Laval's action severing re
lations but that "the government of
the United States can do nothing
about this severance of relations
on the part of the Vichy govern
ment."
NO DECLARATION
Secretary of State Cordell Hull
said significantly that for the time
being a declaration of war was not
involved.
Further emphasizing United
States contempt for Nazi-domi
nated Vichy, Hull did not even wait
for Henry-Haye to call for his pass
port. He sent George S. Summer
lin, chief of protocol, to deliver it
even before the envoy's govern
ment had notified him that rela
tions were broken.
But the scope of current opera
tions goes beyond North Africa.
Hull said at a press conference that
the American campaign "is the
first and preliminary step in our
plans ... to come to the relief of
all enslaved peopjes in Europe, in
cluding France."
ENEMY TERRITORY
Immediately after the break with
Vichy there were these develop
ments:
1. The Treasury designated un

2. The United States began tak

merchant ships in American ports.
3. Hull said the invasion of North
Africa has had no effect on current
negotiations for the demilitariza
tion of Martinique and other
French colonies.
