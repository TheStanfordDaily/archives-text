## Dickason to Lecture On Nias, Isle of Gold 
### 
A colored motion picture entitled
"Nias: Isle of Gold" will be present
ed tonight at 7:30 in the Memorial
Hall Auditorium by Deane Dicka
son, traveler, photographer, author,
and radio news commentator as the
next program of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series.
There is a very interesting story
behind this little island located just
above the equator in the South Pa
cific. According to legend, prior to
the year 200 B.C. Phoenician traders
frequently visited the island to bar
ter for shells and other island prod
ucts. Except for a few vagrant
Portuguese adventurers in the early
16th century, Nias has had few visi
tors since.
HEAVY GOLD JEWELRY
Although thex*e ai'e no gold mines
in this "Isle of Gold," thousands of
dollaxs' worth of heavy gold jewelry,
necklaces, eai'rings, headdresses, and
bracelets are worn by the natives.
How they acquix-ed this gold, the
largest per capita accumulation on
eai-th, is a mystery which has never
been solved.
Located in the Dutch East Indies
80 miles west of Summatra, Nias is
of more interest today as it is the
middle of the Pacific War Zone. It
is about the size of the state of Del
awaxe and is inhabited by some
200,000 light-skinned natives.
TWENTY WORLD TOURS
The lecturer, Deane Dickason, has
(raveled around the world 20 times.
His photographic record of Nias is
one of many he has made in the Far
East. He will be remembered for his
program last year on the Tuesday
Evening Series when he lcctured on
"The Coveted East Indies" accom
panied by another of his motion
pictures. This was before Pearl
Harbor, and his prediction that the
East Indies would be one of the ma
jor goals of the coming war in the
Pacific became a i-eality.
Since returning to California a
year ago, Mr. Dickason has been
bi â€¢oadcasting programs over one of
the major networks on matters con
cerning the Pacific Area.
