# Allied Offensive Shoots Eastward For Tunis, Libya
## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. !) (U.R)â€”American
shock troops have driven deep
wedges into French Algeria on both
sides of Oran, capturing three air
fields and more than 2,000 prisoners,
North African headquarters an
nounced tonight as another arm of
the Allied offensive shot eastward
toward Tunis and Libya,
Allied casualties have been light
everywhere in North Africa despite
stiff local resistance at some points,
a communique from the front an
nounced.
The heaviest fighting was in prog
ress around Oran, key base 230 miles
west of captured Algiers. Troops
under Maj. Gen. Lloyd R. Freden
dall have "penetrated a considerable
distance to the rear of the city" on
either side of it, the headquarters
announcement said.
ATTACK FROM REAR
As the Allied offensive to rid
Africa of the Axis developed with
lightning speed, it became evident
that the Americans, probably with
out waiting for a final decision in Al
geria and Morocco, intend to cut
through Tunisia and attack Tripoli
from the rear.
Meanwhile. Allied reinforcements
: were pouring asTiore and expanding
j a dozen or more firmly held bridge -
j heads which in effect gave them con
i trol of hundreds of miles of coast
! line except for a few concentrated
| points of French resistance.
The developments made Marshal
Ei-win Rommel's position in Libya
virtually hopeless, and emphasized
the scope and daring of Lieut. Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower's plan of at
tack and how closely it was in
grated from the start with the British
offensive from the valley of the Nile.
LANDINGS NEAR TUNISIA
Already American landings were
reported within 60 miles of Tunisia,
backdoor to Libya, while Vichy ac
knowedged the establishment of an
Allied bridgehead at Philippeville,
100 miles from the frontier, and a
bombing raid on Bone, 60 miles from
the border.
President Roosevelt's message
warning of a push through Tunisia
cleared up the Allied plan of attack.
It appeared that if Rommel were
able to salvage the remnants of his
Afrika Korps from Eastern Libya, he
would find the Americans at Tripoli
long before him.
Military observers considered it
likely that the United Nations forces
stationed in West and Equatorial
Africa would join the offensive with
a drive against Dakar, strategic na
val base on the African hump.
The United States has massed an
unknown number of troops in Li
beria, while Free French forces hold
the Lake Chad area. Experts doubted
that the Allies would try to bridge
the 1,000 miles of jungle and diffi
cult terrain between Morocco and
Dakar.
Resistance appears to be meager
and largely of a token nature except
at sea and around the key French
bases in Morocco and Algeria.
Rommel was 700 miles from Tri
poli and the American vanguard
about 475. He was leading a tired
force which had been hammered
| mercilessly for 18 days, and much
! of his essential transport was gone.
The only Allied sea losses in the
initial action were to small craft lost,
in forcing an entry into Oran Har
bor, Adm. Sir Andrew Browne Cuni
mingham, commander of the joint,
naval force, reported from African
headquarters.
