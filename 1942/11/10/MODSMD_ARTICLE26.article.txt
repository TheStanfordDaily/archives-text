and dialects of the Far East.
They will do work in the prepara
tion and broadcasting of material to
the people in the Far East. The
languages most desired are Chinese
(Mandarin, Shanghai, Cantonese,
Amoy), Japanese, Siamese, Malayan,

pine Islands, Mongolian, Burmese
and Anamese, which is spoken in
French Indo-China. There is a need,
