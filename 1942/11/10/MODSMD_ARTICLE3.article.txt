# Eberle Outlines 'Big' Game Ball
## 
### 
Ted Eberle, Big Game Dance
chairman, said last night that he
believes "success of the Lagunita-
Union Formal last Saturday night is
indicative of the type of dance that
Stanford wants more ofâ€”and this is
the type of dance that the Big Game
committee is planning for a week
from Saturday night.
"A good, danceable band, hand
some decorations, sparkling refresh
ments, and a reasonable price," con
tinued Eberle, "are the elemenls
which make for a successful, a really
enjoyable dance, and these are pre
cisely the things we are putting into
our Red and White Ball Big Game
night."
The Big Game dance, a traditional
Stanford affair, has departed some
what from the precedent sot by pre
vious dances in that this dance, be
cause of war-time conditions, is be
ing held on-campus in the Women's
Gym. The fact that gas rationing
goes into effect the day after Big
Game should, according to Eberle.
keep many people on-campus who
otherwise would go down to Del
Monte. "This," says Eberle, "is the
main reason why we are holding
this dance at Stanford."
The Big Game committee pulled
one of the neatest stunts of the week
last Thursday when it got Gary Not
tingham's band for the night of Big
Game. Cal was on the verge of sign
ing up Nottingham when the Farm's
dance committee quietly contacted
and contracted him.
Tickets for the Red and White Ball
are now on sale at the A.S.S.U. of
fice. Price of tickets is $2.75, in
cluding the 1 per cent government
tax. This is a substantial reduction
under last year's tariff.
Dress for the dance, which will
last from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.. is option
ally formal.
