What will probably be the greatest array of football talent bumping
heads on an American gridiron this year will go sight unseen by most
Stanford students and the greater part of those who might want to see the
game but will be forced to stay at home because of gas rationing.
What game? Stanford vs. St. Mary's Pre-Flight in the Stanford Stadium
the week following Big Game.
The contest follows Turkey Day by two full 24-hour shifts, and with most
students at home gorging themselves and little gas to be had by those who

! want to drive, a slim crowd will.
| probably be in attendance at what
would draw—in pre-wartime days—
anywhere near the 50,000 mark.
Just to mention a scant few from
the Navy: Frankie Albert, Vic Bot
tari, Nello Felaschi, Bobby Grayson,
et cetera, vs. Stanford's own varsity
contingent, its frosh, and those who
got the Atherton Axe, namely Bill
i Joslyn and Jim Ellis. Also there's
j Hoot Armstrong, ineligible this year

but okeh against a service team.
For those who are around the
Farm on Nov. 28, there'll be a turkey

Slightly in advance of Collier's,

the dept. sends out what later should
prove to be a unanimous choice—
it'd better be—for left guard. That
being Chuck Taylor, the guy who's
been one of those potential national
grid heroes for three years now but
somehow didn't quite make the
grade. This being Taylor's final slam
at college football, he'll no doubt
get that ail-American nomination.
From which of the many we don't
know, but we've a hunch that the
Christy Walsh all-American Board
will have him on its list.
