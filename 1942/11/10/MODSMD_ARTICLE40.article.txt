# REFS NEEDED:
## 
### 
Harry Wolter. who's teaching a
baseball class of 61 while in his spare
time trying to run an accelerated
mural sports program, is asking for
referees. Seems as if one team had
to use a sort of pseudo-ref the other
day and finished the game under
protest because the fellow appar
ently wasn't acquainted with the
rules governing the touch game.
No beefs to him, but anybody in

terested in keeping the mural foot
ball leagues alive and kicking is
asked to see Harry right away at
the BAC, Encina Gym, or at home.
P.A. 5729.
