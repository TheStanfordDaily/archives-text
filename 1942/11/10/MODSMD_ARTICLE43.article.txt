# Splashers to Face Cal Team In Matched Struggle Friday
## 
### 
In what should be a very evenly
! matched struggle, Stanford's var
j sity water polo team will face Cali
] fornia Friday afternoon in the first
J of a two game series against their
| traditional rivals from across the
! bay.
The frosh will play at 3 and the
varsity at 4.
Off their comparative scores
against the Olympic Club, the two
teams should put on a ding-dong
battle. Stanford upset the Clubmen,
10-8, for their first victory in four
years against the powerful Post
Streeters. But Olympic Club came

back last Friday to edge the Indians,
8-5, in the fast contest. i
The Bears were trounced, 17-8, in
their first game, but bounced in the
second game to pound out a clean
cut 8-5 win, their first triumph over
the Club team in many years.
Instrumental in the second win
was Johnny Norris, veteran forward
speedster from last year, who scored
5 points and was outstanding in the
Bear victory. Two men from last
year's strong frosh team, Stan Mor
ketter and Don Beanston, also
payed good ball. Marketter was a
one-man cyclone in freshman com
petition last year.
