# Athertonized Gridsters May Also Co Into Action Against Ex-Card Stars

### H.D. THOREAU 
appears that almost everybody is.,
going to play.
Eric Armstrong, veteran right
halfback, who has spent this fall
making a scholastic recuperation,
has already started a workout sched
ule that should bring him to top
shape for the game.
DOUBTFUL PLAYERS
Schwartz had planned for Bill
Joslyn and Jim Ellis, Athertonized
former frosh gridders, to play against
the Navy team, but it is rather
doubtful now whether or not they
will be able to get into playing
shape.
Since the Frosh season ended with
last Saturday's impressive win over
the Cal Frosh, the first-year men
will be available this week to learn
Cal varsity plays which they will
run against the varsity the follow
ing week in pre Big Game practice
sessions.
Those boys on the Frosh team who
shine in the work against the older
boys will get a chance to work with
the team for the Pre-Flight game,
and possibly several of them will see
action against the Naps.
Such backs as Lloyd Merriman,
Buck Brownson, Steve Tish, and
Jay McKie may be just what the
varsity has needed all quarter. If
they see any action it will serve as a
preview of what Farm opponents for
! next year have to face.
Leading the Pre-Flight attack will
be Frankie Albert and Bobby Gray
son, both former Stanford ail-
Americans, while the chief scouter
and end coach for the Navy is Jim
Lawson, short time boss-man for the
Cards.
NEARER AT HAND
However, nearer at hand for the
up-an-down Indians to train their
sights on are the defending confer
ence champion Oregon State Bea
vers who will battle the locals in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday aft
ernoon.
Art Shipkoy's split lip and Boh
! Hall's re-turned ankle are the only
injuries that have cropped up after
the Huskie win, but both should be
in good condition by the end of the
week. Schwartz says that he will
play Buck Fawcett Saturday if the
"Los Banos scourge" is in top shape,
but that factor has not been settled
as yet.

The following intramural volley
hall games will he played in the
Encina Gym tonight:
7 p.m.
Kappa Sig vs. A.T.O.
Phi Psi vs. Sigma Chi
8 p.m.
Theta Xi vs. EI Capitan
Encina 4E vs. Encina 3W

It won't be the Stanford varsity that the St. Mary's Naval Pre-Flight
team will play here Nov. 28. It will he an all-University football team, if
Coach Marchie Schwartz' plans work out.
Since conference and N.C.A.A. eligibility rules will not he in effect in
the game with the Naps, anybody in school can technically plav, and it

action against the Naps.
Such backs as Lloyd Merriman,
Buck Brownson, Steve Tish, and
Jay McKie may be just what the
varsity has needed all quarter. If
they see any action it will serve as a
preview of what Farm opponents for
! next year have to face.
Leading the Pre-Flight attack will
be Frankie Albert and Bobby Gray
son, both former Stanford ail-
Americans, while the chief scouter
and end coach for the Navy is Jim
Lawson, short time boss-man for the
Cards.
NEARER AT HAND
However, nearer at hand for the
up-an-down Indians to train their
sights on are the defending confer
ence champion Oregon State Bea
vers who will battle the locals in
the Stanford Stadium Saturday aft
ernoon.
Art Shipkoy's split lip and Boh
! Hall's re-turned ankle are the only
injuries that have cropped up after
the Huskie win, but both should be
in good condition by the end of the
week. Schwartz says that he will
play Buck Fawcett Saturday if the
"Los Banos scourge" is in top shape,
but that factor has not been settled
as yet.

The following intramural volley
hall games will he played in the
Encina Gym tonight:
7 p.m.
Kappa Sig vs. A.T.O.
Phi Psi vs. Sigma Chi
8 p.m.
Theta Xi vs. EI Capitan
Encina 4E vs. Encina 3W

It won't be the Stanford varsity that the St. Mary's Naval Pre-Flight
team will play here Nov. 28. It will he an all-University football team, if
Coach Marchie Schwartz' plans work out.
Since conference and N.C.A.A. eligibility rules will not he in effect in
the game with the Naps, anybody in school can technically plav, and it
appears that almost everybody is.,
going to play.
Eric Armstrong, veteran right
halfback, who has spent this fall
making a scholastic recuperation,
has already started a workout sched
ule that should bring him to top
shape for the game.
DOUBTFUL PLAYERS
Schwartz had planned for Bill
Joslyn and Jim Ellis, Athertonized
former frosh gridders, to play against
the Navy team, but it is rather
doubtful now whether or not they
will be able to get into playing
shape.
Since the Frosh season ended with
last Saturday's impressive win over
the Cal Frosh, the first-year men
will be available this week to learn
Cal varsity plays which they will
run against the varsity the follow
ing week in pre Big Game practice
sessions.
Those boys on the Frosh team who
shine in the work against the older
boys will get a chance to work with
the team for the Pre-Flight game,
and possibly several of them will see
action against the Naps.
Such backs as Lloyd Merriman,
