# Hell Week and Beets
## 
### 
YESTERDAY the Interfraternity Board of Con
trol announced that three fraternities had
been fined for violation of the Pre-Initiation
regulations and also made it mandatory that
these fines be worked off in the beet fields.
By taking this action the Interfraternity Board
accomplished two very important ends.
One, it showed that it meant what it said in
regard to the control of the fraternities, and
showed that it had the power to enforce its rules
and regulations and showed that it intended
to enforce them.
Two, it in part eased the pressing need for
agricultural workers in the beet fields in the
area immediately surrounding Stanford.
By taking this action, the Interfraternity Board
has definitely established itself as a power ca
pable of dealing with the problems that rush
ing under war time conditions will foster, and
it has showed that it is capable of taking care
of those who don't stick to the rules.â€”Al Hamp
