# Students Pitch Into War Work
## 
### 
Substantial figures are proving
that this quarter has the car marks
of being a period of the greatest
volunteer man-hours in Stanford's
history. Since Reg Day, men and
women have pitched into the civil
ian war effort by toiling in local
tomato, beet, and walnut crops, and
by rolling bandages in the War
Workshop .
It has all proceeded in the spirit
of competition, which has brought
commendation from ranch owners.
The rivalry between fraternities
reached a high point last week
when the Phi Psi's, A.T.O.'s and
S.A.E.'s wagered an afternoon's
wages on the most productive beet
topping crew, and "slaved for four
hours to win.
MEN VS. WOMEN
Meanwhile, the SWB, under
Rosemary Cross, has been super
vising the programs and recording
figures on student output. Last
night, the War Board released fig
ures on hours put in by women's
dorms, sororities, and men's halls
and fraternities, giving birth to a
new rivalry—men vs. women.
According to War Board figures,
men hold a distinct lead, having
contributed 591 hours, compared
with the 276 hours volunteered by
women.
But the whole story is not told in
these numbers. Thee week-ends
that Roble and other women's
groups put into tomato and walnut
harvests are not included in the
figure. Considering this, the SWB
is calling it a draw. But the quar
ter is not over, much less the war,
and Rosemary Cross is urging stu
dents "to keep up the spirit and
good work."
WOMEN'S "BIG FOUR"
Of the women's living groups, the
"Big Four" are Roble, Gamma Phi,
Tri-Delt and Hawthorne. Roble
has contributed 37 hours to the
Workshop, Gamma Phi 24 hours,

when the Phi Psi's, A.T.O.'s and
S.A.E.'s wagered an afternoon's
wages on the most productive beet
topping crew, and "slaved for four
hours to win.
MEN VS. WOMEN
Meanwhile, the SWB, under
Rosemary Cross, has been super
vising the programs and recording
figures on student output. Last
night, the War Board released fig
ures on hours put in by women's
dorms, sororities, and men's halls
and fraternities, giving birth to a
new rivalry—men vs. women.
According to War Board figures,
men hold a distinct lead, having
contributed 591 hours, compared
with the 276 hours volunteered by
women.
But the whole story is not told in
these numbers. Thee week-ends
that Roble and other women's
groups put into tomato and walnut
harvests are not included in the
figure. Considering this, the SWB
is calling it a draw. But the quar
ter is not over, much less the war,
and Rosemary Cross is urging stu
dents "to keep up the spirit and
good work."
WOMEN'S "BIG FOUR"
Of the women's living groups, the
"Big Four" are Roble, Gamma Phi,
Tri-Delt and Hawthorne. Roble
has contributed 37 hours to the
Workshop, Gamma Phi 24 hours,
Tri Delts 23, and Hawthorne 20
hours.
Substantial figures are proving
that this quarter has the car marks
of being a period of the greatest
volunteer man-hours in Stanford's
history. Since Reg Day, men and
women have pitched into the civil
ian war effort by toiling in local
tomato, beet, and walnut crops, and
by rolling bandages in the War
Workshop .
It has all proceeded in the spirit
of competition, which has brought
commendation from ranch owners.
The rivalry between fraternities
reached a high point last week
when the Phi Psi's, A.T.O.'s and
S.A.E.'s wagered an afternoon's
wages on the most productive beet
topping crew, and "slaved for four
hours to win.
