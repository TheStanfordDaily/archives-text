# On Being Represented
## 
### 
TODAY the students of Stanford will have a
chance to express themselves at the polls
and to choose those who will represent them
for the next few quarters, those who will formu
late the policy of the students, and those who
will pass the rules that will either restrict stu
dent activity or enlarge it.
Maybe this election will be different from
those in the past. Maybe the student body will
take a sincere interest and turn out to vote for
the candidates they think best qualified.
There isn't much hope that this will be the
case, since only one man was nominated for the
Excom post in last Tuesday's nominations and
nominations were reopened last Friday.
Since these are the people who are to rep
resent you and protect you, come out and vote
for them today. It doesn't take much time. —A1
