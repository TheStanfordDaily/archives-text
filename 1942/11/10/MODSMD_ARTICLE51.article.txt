# Late Leaves and Stalingrad
## 
### 
LIKE the Big Game Bonfire and the high
powered cars, so the 2:30 late leaves have
fallen before the pressure of the war.
To be said in favor of these earlier hours for
women is the fact that they give more time for
sleeping and thus better enable the women to
carry the burdens that war demands.
Not only are the week-end late leaves cut
down but also the midweek ones. This keeps
the girls on the campus more and thus eases
the problem created by the possibility of a
blackout.
But just as privilege carries with it responsi
bility, so the restricting of the late leaves of the
Stanford women carries with it an obligation.
Even though we are in a desperately serious
war which enters every phase of our lives, we
must not lose or lightly sacrifice our sense of
humor or our ability to relax.
Relaxing does not necessarily carry with it
the idea of hotel dancing or expensive and
impressive displays of emotion. When we do
relax it might be well to keep in mind the 56-
hour week that the English are working or the
conditions of life under which the Russians in
Stalingrad are living. A1 Hampson
