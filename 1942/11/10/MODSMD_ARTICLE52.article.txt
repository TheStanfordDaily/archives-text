The United Nations are winning this war.
How long the pay streak will last I don't know.
The end of the war is not in sight. But the Axis
is meeting defeat on all fronts. Hundreds of
miles of the coast of French North Africa are
in Allied possession. At Stalingrad, the Ger
man attack has abated, and Russian forces are
shoving hard. In the Caucasus, the Red Army
has thrown the Nazis back. On Guadalcanal,
the Marines are advancing. In New Guinea,
Mac Arthur's troops drive toward the Jap base
of Buna. In Europe, Allied bombs are smashing
at vital German installations. The Eighth Army
in Egypt is rolling ahead.
The big news is still the African double-play.
While I expected that the United Nations would
concentrate on the southern front as a necessary
preliminary to any Second Front, I frankly did
not think that we had the moral self-confidence
to attack nominally neutral French territory.
But, knowing that "our cause it is just," we made
an attack on French North Africa that will go
down in military history, in my inexpert opin
ion, as a tactical masterpiece. Consider, first,
the problems of getting approximately 140,000
men on ship, moving them through enemy-in
fested waters, bringing them into position with
out warning the enemy, and conducting more
than a dozen simultaneous and successful land
ings. Consider, second, the co-ordination with
the British advance out of Egypt. The details
of the attack would would seem to be these:
landings were made, against some resistance
from French shore batteries, at Algiers, near
Oran, Casablanca, and Rabat, and a number
of other points. If you have a map handy, you
will notice that we are attacking both the Medi
terranean and the Atlantic coasts, from our base
at Gibraltar. Algiers capitulated, Oran is sur
rounded from beach-heads above and below the
city, and two towns commanding Casablanca,
as well as three out of four airfields there, have
been taken.
There was some naval action against the
Allied fleet, but the Anglo - American forces
brushed it aside. The French fleet at Toulon
has had steam up since the attack began, but
has not as yet come out to meet the British.
Hitler may yet force a naval battle, in which
Germany has nothing to lose, with the French
and Italian fleets combined against the United
Nations. But the Italian fleet has not yet been
able to stand up to the British, and the loyalty
of Vichy's navy is questionable.
The remnants of the Afrika Korps and asso
ciated forces have fled across the border into
Libya and the Allies are hot on their heels, al
ready past Sidi Barrani, with thousands of Axis
supermen captured or pocketed behind them.
The Eighth Army is reported to have destroyed
most of Rommel's tanks, and the Allied air
forces are in undisputed command of the atmos
phere. The aid and comfort available to the fas
cists around Tripoli appears to be limited; Roo
sevelt sent a note yesterday to the Bey of Tunis,
titular ruler under French protection, advising
him that the United Nations intended to cross
the protectorate toward Libya's western border.
Axis forces in Libya, it is deducible, will be
subject to attack from two sides, and, remem
bering reports of Free French concentrations
at Lake Tchad to the south, perhaps from three.
Another chapter has been added to the mys
tery of General Henri Giraud. You will remem
ber that he allegedly escaped from a German
prison down a sheer cliff to reach France and
that Vichy refused to surrender him to the
Nazis. That was a mystery in itself. Last night
an announcement from General Eisenhower
informed the world that Giraud had arrived in
North Africa and was asuming command of the
Free French forces there. How he left France,
crossed the Mediterranean, etc., is a second
mystery.
