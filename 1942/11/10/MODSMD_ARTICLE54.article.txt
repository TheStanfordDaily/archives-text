# Cleverness Is Shown In Musical
## Carol Stone Stars In 'Adamant Eve', Lavish Musical Play 
### 
ADAMANT EVE, a musical com
edy now playing at the Curran in
San Francisco.
In stage productions, San Fran
cisco theater-goers show a prefer
ence for music and sex. This musi
cal comedy offers the latter, pure
and unadulterated—or perhaps that's
not the right word. At times, espe
cially at the second act climax when
the maid's skirt does a counter
march to the curtain, one has to gaze
mightily at the expanse of boiled
shirts in the front row to make sure
one hasn't strayed into the Liberty
by mistake.
BRITTLE LINES
The production is often witty,
never humorous; it has a lot of those
brittle brilliant lines modern plays
thrive on, and some nonsensical little
ditties whose alliteration is, at least,
clever.
The comedy, however, certainly
does not deserve the appellation
"musical." There's not a song, not
a tune in it anyone would desire to
hear again, discounting an adopted
medley of old favorites.
Paul Schoop and Nilo Menendes
at the twin pianos upstage did an
excellent if pointless duet at the be
ginning of the third act, and pro
vided good mood music throughout,
although their presence on the stage
violated the dramatic precept that
no personages should be on the stage
if they are not going to have a part
in the play—but after all it was a
musical comedy and not a play.
FRIVOLOUS WIFE
Perhaps that was the difficulty;
without music it had to try to be
both. Carol Stone was excellent as
the frivolous wife, Cyprienne; and
Barry Norton gave a very natural
performance as Maurice, the sympa
thetic husband.
But Rex O'Malley succumbed to
the dilemma; he did some excellent
half-hearted musical comedy ham
ming. And Fred Essler went all out
for musical comedy, doing the con
ventional caricature of a head
waiter well.
ELABORATE SETTINGS
Settings and costumes were elab
orate and expensive, and in all quite
beautiful; this particular version of
an 1890 night club reached a new
high for swankness.
So, as a musical comedy "Adam
ant Eve" is not momentous, but it
is fairly enjoyable.—Dillinger.

mightily at the expanse of boiled
shirts in the front row to make sure
one hasn't strayed into the Liberty
by mistake.
BRITTLE LINES
The production is often witty,
never humorous; it has a lot of those
brittle brilliant lines modern plays
thrive on, and some nonsensical little
ditties whose alliteration is, at least,
clever.
The comedy, however, certainly
does not deserve the appellation
"musical." There's not a song, not
a tune in it anyone would desire to
hear again, discounting an adopted
medley of old favorites.
Paul Schoop and Nilo Menendes
at the twin pianos upstage did an
excellent if pointless duet at the be
ginning of the third act, and pro
vided good mood music throughout,
although their presence on the stage
violated the dramatic precept that
no personages should be on the stage
if they are not going to have a part
in the play—but after all it was a
musical comedy and not a play.
FRIVOLOUS WIFE
Perhaps that was the difficulty;
without music it had to try to be
both. Carol Stone was excellent as
the frivolous wife, Cyprienne; and
Barry Norton gave a very natural
performance as Maurice, the sympa
thetic husband.
But Rex O'Malley succumbed to
the dilemma; he did some excellent
half-hearted musical comedy ham
ming. And Fred Essler went all out
for musical comedy, doing the con
ventional caricature of a head
waiter well.
ELABORATE SETTINGS
Settings and costumes were elab
orate and expensive, and in all quite
beautiful; this particular version of
an 1890 night club reached a new
high for swankness.
So, as a musical comedy "Adam
ant Eve" is not momentous, but it
is fairly enjoyable.—Dillinger.
ADAMANT EVE, a musical com
edy now playing at the Curran in
San Francisco.
In stage productions, San Fran
cisco theater-goers show a prefer
ence for music and sex. This musi
cal comedy offers the latter, pure
and unadulterated—or perhaps that's
not the right word. At times, espe
cially at the second act climax when
the maid's skirt does a counter
march to the curtain, one has to gaze
mightily at the expanse of boiled
shirts in the front row to make sure
one hasn't strayed into the Liberty
by mistake.
