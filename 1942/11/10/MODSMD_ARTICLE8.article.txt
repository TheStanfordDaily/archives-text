With the statement that "there
should be no trouble getting reser
vations for travel this Christmas,"
Mr. Emil te Groen, Southern Pacific
passenger agent last night virtually
guaranteed that Stanford students
would he able to get home this
Christmas.
Mr. te Groen, however, emphasized
that it is necessary that reservations
be made early for all vacation travel.
He also said many students who had
made reservations prior to the Uni
versity's decision to give a Christmas
holiday, "still have reservations on
which the dates are not correct, and
it would be advisable that students
with these reservations correct these
dates."
Concerning travel to Los Angeles
Mr. te Groen states that he did not
believe there would be any diffi
culty in caring for students on the
Daylight if reservations were ob
tained early, and he added that
even though the Daylight was sold
out there are several slower trains
which could undoubtedly take care
of any student overflow.
Eastern travel will also be rela
tively easy, Mr. te Groen said, al
though he added that the lines east
of Chicago are assigning no spaces
after Dec. 6. This, he said, might be
a foreboding of a government order
giving priorities to military and gov
ernment men on the railroads, but
as yet, he concluded, the Southern
Pacific has had no word of such a
move.
Concerning th e transportation
problem, it was also pointed out that
the Greyhound Bus lines and the
Santa Fe valley route arc facilities
which Stanford students might well
take advantage of.
