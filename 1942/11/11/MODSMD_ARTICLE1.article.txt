Elections Board Chairman Bob
Griswold was disappointed in the
relatively meager number of votes
cast, only a fourth as many as in
the Spring Quarter A.S.S.U. elec
tions.
Narver was elected to the Excom
post vacated by Frank Horton and
will take office immediately. "I
never expected to find myself doing
this, but I've watched Excom meet
ings for six years and I think I can
handle it," he said yesterday.
Candidates for the B.A.C. post
were nominated by petition Tuesday
of last week. All men students were

clared ineligible for insufficient

Friday, when five men and two
women were named.

Dave Narver was elected graduate
member on Excom and Chuck Tay
lor to membership on the B.A.C. in
a special election yesterday which
brought out only 438 votes.
Narver, a Chemical Engineering
graduate, won by 53 votes over his
nearest competitor, Otway Pardee.
He was elected on the sixth count.
Stanford's contender for All -
American guard. Taylor, was an easy
victor over Hank Norberg and four
other candidates on the fifth count.
He had a lead of 103 ballots.
FEW VOTES CAST
Elections Board Chairman Bob
Griswold was disappointed in the
relatively meager number of votes
cast, only a fourth as many as in
the Spring Quarter A.S.S.U. elec
tions.
Narver was elected to the Excom
post vacated by Frank Horton and
will take office immediately. "I
never expected to find myself doing
this, but I've watched Excom meet
ings for six years and I think I can
handle it," he said yesterday.
Candidates for the B.A.C. post
were nominated by petition Tuesday
of last week. All men students were
eligible to file.
ONLY ONE NOMINATED
Since only one man was nominated
for the position on Excom in the
nominations then, and he was de
clared ineligible for insufficient
units, nominations were reopened
Friday, when five men and two
women were named.
