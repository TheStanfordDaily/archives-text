# Diploma Fund Collections Fall
## Five Men's Groups Hold Perfect Record 
### 
Reporting the lowest total of Fall
Quarter, although it still breaks the
$100 per week quota, "Dimes for
Diplomas" committee members an
nounced a $109.41 contribution in
Monday's drive.
Five men's living groups again
maintained their perfect record of
100 per cent contributions. ATO,
Fiji. Co-op, and Theta Delta Chi
formed the major contributing group
among Stanford men, with three eat
ing clubs, El Toro, El Campo, and
Los Arcos, also making perfect rec
ords for the week.
Sorority percentages were not
listed in this week's drive.
The tabulated returns gathered by
Chairman Ted Barr and his commit
tee listed the following gifts to the
post-war scholarship fund:
Eating Clubs, $11.15; Lagunita,
$16.12; Union Unit, $8.15; Roble,
$22.62; Ventura, $2.50; Encina, $14.49.
Fraternities, $16.81; Sororities,
$13.10.
Compared to last week's contribu
tions, most of the living groups' do
nations fell off. Roble and Encina
increased their gifts by a few cents,
and fraternities were up one dollar.
The contribution brought the total
Fall Quarter fund to $602.52.
