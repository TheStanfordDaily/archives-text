# Farm Will keep Platters Clean
## 
### 
Clean Your Plate Day, taking its
place with Defense Stamp and Dimes
for Diplomas Day, will bo inaugu
rated next Thursday by the Stan
| ford War Board.
The shortage of dairy products has
made it imperative that students
practice food conservation. Too j
! many students have been indulging
1 in such wasteful practices as taking {
j two glasses of milk and leaving one j
half-full, and leaving unused butter
on their plates. Although the short- |
age of dairy products is most acute, j
j there is also a danger of waste in I
| other foods, and members of living ]
groups should aid the conservation
I policy by eating all the food served
them.
Students should clean their plates ;
every day, but Thursday has been !
set aside as the day to remind every- j
one of the policy. Blackboard and
poster notices similar to those ad- i
vertising the Defense Stamp Drive j
will be put up on Thursday.
This week speakers will visit all j
the living groups on campus to dis- ;
cuss the importance of observing
Clean Your Plate Day, according to [
Anne Van Dyke, who is in charge of '
the campaign.
