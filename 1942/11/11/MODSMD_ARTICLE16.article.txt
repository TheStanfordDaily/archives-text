# Two Stanford Living Groups Burglarized by Female Prowler
## 
### 
Two campus sororities were burglarized last Friday and investigations
proved a women's residence hall had been entered.
About Friday morning a woman was discovered on the second floor
landing of the Pi Phi House. Mrs. J. McLcod Gardiner, the housemother,
was advised of her presence. She went to investigate and met the un
identified woman in the hallway. +

She asked her whom she wished
to see and the woman replied that
she was looking for Frances Harri
son, whose name she obtained from
a letter in the room.
ROBBERY DISCOVERED
The burglar brushed by Mrs.
Gardiner and left the building.
Early in the afternoon it was dis
covered that a gold bracelet, gold
wristwatch and $6 cash from Frances
Harrison's room was missing. Bar
bara Mordecai reported the loss of
a large diamond dinner ring and a
small diamond ring.
The woman thief then went to
Kappa Alpha Theta where she stole
$3 cash from Doris Dreusink and $3
from Jerry Hughes. When she was
surprised at the door of on? of the
girl's room, the prowler stated that
she was looking for Miss Dennis.
The prowler complained of a cinder
in her eye and asked for assistance.
This ruse to prevent further ques
tioning led to an opportunity for her
departure.
MADRONO ENTERED
Subsequent investigations proved
that Madrono was entered, but on
meeting with a resident, the prowler
said she wanted to phone and left.
On receiving the complaint, Police
Chief Gordon R. Davis issued a
statewide teletype description to all
police departments in an effort to
apprehend the burglar.
The description is as follows:
About 25 years old; height, 5 feet
5 inches; weight. 110-115 pounds;
blonde y hair; receding cheeks; up
swept hair-do. She was wearing a
brown plaid shirt and twin yellow
sweaters.
ON ANOTHER CAMPUS
Chief of Fresno Police Raymond
T. Wallace reported in a letter to
Davis that a girl of identical descrip
tion committed two thefts at Fresno
State College on Thursday, the day
prior to her arrival on this campus.
A statewide search for the thief
was in progress, according to Wal
lace. ,
Chief of Police Davis warns all
living groups not to leave their
houses completely vacant without
locking them or providing other
means of protection. These precau
tions should be taken especially on
football game afternoons.
Davis urges students to watch all
strangers and not direct them to
friends' rooms without accompany
ing them. The last scries of rob
beries occurred several months ago
when Ent'ina and several fraternities
were entered illegal Iv.
