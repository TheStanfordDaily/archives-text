# OPA Delays Gas Rationing
## 
### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. 10 (U.R)—
Postponement of nationwide gaso
line rationing from Nov. 22 to Dec.
1 was announced today by the Office
of Price Administration because of
delay in distributing forms and cou
pons caused largely by the wartime
congestion of America's transporta
tion system."
OPA said that "wherever neces
sary," schoolhouse registration of
motorists and commercial users for
j gasoline coupons will be set back
i from Nov. 12 to 14 to Nov. 18 to 20
and that any delays will be an
nounced locally.
A spokesman said registration will
proceed as originally scheduled "in
all places where the forms and
| books have been received."
| "DEFINITELY NOT"
He replied "definitely not" when
asked if the postponement resulted
in any way from reported letter
writing campaigns demanding a
thorough trial for voluntary conser
vation before rationing is instituted.
Some 1,000.000,000 pieces of printed
matter are necessary to put the na
tionwide program into effect, the
i OPA said, but to date delivery
schedules have been met on only
one-third of this vast amount of
i material.
Motorists in states outside the
rationed East Coast who receive "A"
books entitling them to approxi
mately four gallons a week will be
given a bonus of "little more than a
coupon's worth since no coupons will
be deducted to allow for the change
in dates, officials said.
ICKES WARNS EAST
Petroleum Coordinator Harold L.
Ickes warned East Coast motorists
to cut their consumption to an "ir
! reducible minimum" or face a pos
sible reduction in the value of ration
coupons.
The landing of American forces in
North Africa, he said, has placed
new demands on American petrol
eum supplies which, while ample
for all needs, can not be brought to
the East Coast for unnecessary ci
vilian use.
He said that tank cars brought
753.51)4 barrels of petroleum products
daily into the Atlantic Seaboard area
'during the week ended Oct. 31.

WASHINGTON. Nov. 10 (U.R)—
Postponement of nationwide gaso
line rationing from Nov. 22 to Dec.
1 was announced today by the Office
of Price Administration because of
delay in distributing forms and cou
pons caused largely by the wartime
congestion of America's transporta
tion system."
OPA said that "wherever neces
sary," schoolhouse registration of
motorists and commercial users for
j gasoline coupons will be set back
i from Nov. 12 to 14 to Nov. 18 to 20
and that any delays will be an
nounced locally.
A spokesman said registration will
proceed as originally scheduled "in
all places where the forms and
| books have been received."
| "DEFINITELY NOT"
He replied "definitely not" when
asked if the postponement resulted
in any way from reported letter
writing campaigns demanding a
thorough trial for voluntary conser
vation before rationing is instituted.
Some 1,000.000,000 pieces of printed
matter are necessary to put the na
tionwide program into effect, the
i OPA said, but to date delivery
schedules have been met on only
one-third of this vast amount of
i material.
Motorists in states outside the
rationed East Coast who receive "A"
books entitling them to approxi
mately four gallons a week will be
given a bonus of "little more than a
coupon's worth since no coupons will
be deducted to allow for the change
in dates, officials said.
