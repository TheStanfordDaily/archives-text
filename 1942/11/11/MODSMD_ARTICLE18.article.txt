LONDON, Wednesday, Nov. 11
(U.R)—Adolf Ilitlcr has ordered
German troops to occupy the re
mainder of France and the Medi
terranean island of Corsica,
miles north of the coast of Africa,
to counter the United States in
vasion of French possessions in
Northern Africa, the Paris radio
announced today.
•LONDON, Nov. 10 (U.R)—Ameri
can shock forces captured Oran to
day and smashed into Casahlanca,
where French naval resistance was
crushed, as signs piled up that re
sistance in North Africa was col
lapsing and Allied control of the
entire South Mediterranean Coast
was near at hand.
The fall of Oran, ancicnt city of
200.000 commanding Northwest Al
geria, was announced in a com
munique from North African head
quarters, which said the Moroccan
coastal bases of Safi, Fedala and
Media also were in American hands.
FRENCH SHIP BURNS
The new 35,000-ton French battle
ship Jean Bart which led the fleet
in action off Casablanca, is aflame
in the port, the Allied Command re
vealed, and naval resistance in that
sector had crumpled like a punc
tured balloon.
Vichy reported that three United
States tank columns had crashed
into Casablanca, and the city was
under heavy attack by superior
American forces and was being
bombarded violently. Gov. Gen. Au
guste Nogues of Morocco had fled
Rabat to the interior.
U.S. SPEEDS EASTWARD
On the opposite flank, a fast Amer
ican mobile column sped eastward
toward Tunisia, and it was believed
that the big Bizerte naval base might
be brought into the area of opera
tions momentarily. An otherwise
unsubstantiated Buenos Aires radio
report said the Americans already
had marched into Tunisia.
Meanwhile, dramatic develop
ments were afoot which may bring
Adm. Jean Francois Darlan, former
commander of the French armed
forces, into the Allied camp. He whs
in American hands at captured Al
giers and "being entertained with all
dignity due his rank and record," a
spokesman said, adding significantly
that "I use 'entertain' advisedly."
