### 
PIMLICO, Md., Nov. 10 (UP).â€”
Mrs. John Hertz's Count Fleet
jumped into the lend in the open
ing yards of the $10,000 Walden
Stakes at Pitnlico today and drew
away with every ward thereafter,
finishing with a 30 -length lead over
Uncle Billies who was 15 length?;
before Rouph Doc.
Only four started and Ascertain
was the last horse to finish as the
Count scored by the greatest mar
gin in a fiat stake race since Man o'
War won the Lawrence Realization
of 1020 by 100 lengths.
After a certain speed is attained
by an airplane in a power dive, the
propeller acts as u brake.
