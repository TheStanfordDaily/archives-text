# TROJAN VARSITY DRILL
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 10 (UP).â€”
The University nf Southern Cali
fornia Trojans didn't shine against
"Oregon" today. Coach JefT Cra
vath sent his regulars against the
Spartans, running Oregon plays,
and the ineligibles made his varsity
look bad. The Sparts made huge
gains around and over the first
team, if not through the line, and
Cravath kept his backfield "after
school" to show them their errors.
