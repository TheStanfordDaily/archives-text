## 
### 
Loren LaPradc, light guard; Fin
ney Cox, left guard; Buck Faw
cett. fullback, and Will Sheller,
halfback, were named game co-cap
tains for the Oregon State clash
Saturday by Head Coach Marchie
Schwartz at practice last night.
The four juniors have been out
standing members of the Indian
football machine this fall, all ex
cept Cox holding down regular
starting berths. LaPrade will be
out of the game with the Beavers,
but the other co-captains should
see action.
Stanford's linemen received an
intensive workout last night on the
dummies. Schwartz apparently i.s
taking no chances with the O.S.C.
running attack. The backfield ran
through some passing and reverse
routines. Ray Hammett and Bobby
Andrews alternated at the quarter
spot.

Buck Fawcett was rambling again
at the fullback spot with seemingly
no ill effects from his knee injury
sustained at U.C.L.A. Bob Grisbee
also worked out with the first
string. Art Shipkey, nursing a
slightly wrenched ankle, was run
ning off-tackle plays with the third
I squad.
In the line the loss of LaPrade
; stands out like a sore thumb, but
! he should be ready for the Big
Game and Bill Young looks, and
has proven himself as of Kezar last
week-end, capable of handling the
assignment.

BEAVER DRILL
Mcenwhile in Corvallis Coach
Lon Stiner emphasized defensive
play and anti-T formation tactics in
his drill yesterday. Except for Bob
Libbee and Choc Shelton, his squad
is at full strength after an easy
week-end against Montana.
At the Card practice. Hoot Arm
strong was back with his quick
starts and showing speed which
may embarrass Frank Culling Al

in the tilt. But just to show that

make much difference, Joslyn calm

cett. fullback, and Will Sheller,
halfback, were named game co-cap
tains for the Oregon State clash

Schwartz at practice last night.
The four juniors have been out

starting berths. LaPrade will be
out of the game with the Beavers,
but the other co-captains should
see action.
Stanford's linemen received an
intensive workout last night on the
dummies. Schwartz apparently i.s
taking no chances with the O.S.C.
running attack. The backfield ran
through some passing and reverse
routines. Ray Hammett and Bobby
Andrews alternated at the quarter
spot.
FAWCETT BACK
Buck Fawcett was rambling again
at the fullback spot with seemingly
no ill effects from his knee injury
sustained at U.C.L.A. Bob Grisbee
also worked out with the first
string. Art Shipkey, nursing a
slightly wrenched ankle, was run
ning off-tackle plays with the third
