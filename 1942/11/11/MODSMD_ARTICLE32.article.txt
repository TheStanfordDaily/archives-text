# Merman Captain Injured Sunday
## 
### 
Chances for Stanford's victory
against the powerful California
water polo team were cut down yes
terday with news that Hadley Ba
! :on. team captain and first string
forward, may be 10.-l for one and
possibly both games.
Bacon fell from a horse Sunday
and broke three ribs. If he plays at
all Friday, his effectiveness will be
limited. His place probably will be
taken by Jack Carpenter, junior,
who has turned in some good re
! placement jobs this year.
Stanford's ether cripples, A1
Weedon and Dick Narver, sopho
more guards. should be ready to go.
