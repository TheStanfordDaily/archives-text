# Frosh to Seek Man on Excom
## Class of '46 to Hold Discussion in Roble 
### 
A discussion concerning Freshman
representation on Ex Com will be
j held at 7:30 tonight at Roble. Frank
I Church is getting this group together
| so that ideas can be exchanged and
' something definite can be estab-
I lished on which the class can work.
This meeting is the result of such
I ideas as Dave Bluford's: "How can
| one speak of democracy in Stanford
when such a vast minority goes un
represented year after year in a
university which considers itself a
[ leader in furthering those self-same
ideals."
Another freshman, Carl Burke,
says, "Out of the entire student body
approximately one-fourth of those
students are denied the right of
participation on Ex Com."
"In order to have true student
| government all the students must be
| represented; yet the entire Freshman
j Class is denied representation on
j Ex Com!" is the opinion of Frosh
1 Bill Glikbarg.
It is the hope of Frank Church
that through the collection of every
one's ideas a plan will be formulated
| to get a freshman representative on
Ex Com.
