Joke.' and cartoons that once made .
Stanford laugh, shirts and silk stock
ings that aren't holding their owners
together anymore, old sheets and j
pillow cases, and all the other im
pedimenta that traditionally collects !
behind the coke machine or under j
the bed are now becoming a part of
(he nation's war effort in the Stan
ford War Workshop.
This latest addition to the Stan
lord War Board family is strictly a
female proposition. Here the Stan
ford woman has a definite job to do.
She makes bandages and stretcher j
pads, sterile towels, joke books, and
any other thing which can be put j
together for men at the fornt from
ordinary odds and ends.
ONE QUOTA FILLED
Alfready the group, which works i
behind the Quad office, has filled
its quarter's quota for sterile towels.
"The Palo Alto Chapter of the Amer
ican Red Cross expects Stanford
women to help fill their quota. This j
workshop is one thing that the Stan- j
ford women can do. They should
feel that they must give their time
to it." said Anne Alton, committee
chairman in charge of the project.
The working conditions: Any girl
j can volunteer to help between 1 and
: 5 p.m., Monday through Thursday,
and in addition, each women's living
j group is asked to provide a certain
: quota of girls to fill out the shifts
j every afternoon.
CHART OF HOURS
A chart of hours spent is being
made for each of the living groups.
