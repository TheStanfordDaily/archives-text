THE Bookstore has done it 'again. Monday
morning, out of a clear sky, came the an
nouncement that an additional five per cent re
bate was to be tacked onto the eight per cent
received last year. Rebates are wonderful
things. We go along for days and weeks and
months trying to find a way to earn money; then
the Bookstore comes to our rescue.
That is the selfish angle. Unknown to many
students is the fact that the Bookstore gave over
$5000 to the University for scholarships last
year. That is one of the beauties of such a
well-organized co-operative group. Needy and
worthy students are provided for by the money
we spend for books and supplies.
As we purchase materials from the store, we
are helping ourselves and others. That should
be incentive enough to buy all supplies here
on campus. The little inconveniences expe
rienced the first week of each quarter are com
pensated for several-fold later.
Now we've got some good war news to
sweeten the bad we have been hearing lately.
Americans are "going to town" in Africa. But
all won't be sweet news from now on. We
still have to win everything in Africa, con
quer most of Europe, and win back large ex
panses and little islands in Asia. Things are
turning, and it looks like we are on the win
ning side, but we at home have to keep going
all of the time so that we can keep winning.
