"W"ESTERDAY Stanford's so-called democracy
1 fell flat on its face. Very few students
turned out to vote for persons to fill positions
on the Board of Athletic Control and the student
Executive Committee, two of the most important
groups on the campus.
Students love to complain about their gov
erning bodies; many of the complaints are
legitimate, many unfair. Any complaints made
this guarter about the newly elected members
should fall in the unfair category because the
students didn't see fit to come to the polls to
express their opinions.
Possibly The Daily can be blamed for this
lack of spirit. This year we have abandoned,
as nearly as possible, the custom of mention
ing living group affiliations with candidates'
names because we feel that if a person is a
Stanford student, that is sufficient identification.
We have also felt it unnecessary to mention
all the past offices held by candidates. In other
words, we are trying to make the elections as
democratic as possible without going to ex
tremes.
In the case of the graduate man on Excom,
it was difficult to make more than two or three
choices, for very few of the candidates were
well known. Maybe a short assembly should be
held just before each election to introduce all
of the candidates to interested students. ' This
is the least that should be done.
Stanford's mid year election system needs
a definite boost. The Daily would appreciate
any ideas on this line. There should be some
brainchildren drifting around the heads of elec
tion-conscious students. Let's hear from you.
