# BULL SESSION
## 
### H. D. Thoreau 
Since the announcement of the results of yes
terday's election are adequately covered on the
first page, and since the fact that only 438 of
2,000,000,000 people in the world voted in this
election has been more than adequately cov
ered in the adjoining column of editorials, all

that is left for me to say is that Errol Flynn got
two votes as write-in candidate for grad man
on Excom.
However, since he has not received his de
gree yet these votes cannot be counted. Every
body on Excom is over 18, anyway, so there's
no great loss.
* * * *
But after all, what business is it of mine
whether or not he gets elected to Excom? As
a matter of fact, what business is it of yours
whether or not he gets sent away for a stretch
or not?
Little girls at Roble who have read nothing
but the funnies for years are now rushing down
stairs every morning to read the front page. And
they are giggling, they are giggling at stories
about Mr. Flynn and friends.
This may be the first mention of the Flynn
case in The Daily, since we over here have a
policy, formulated by somebody some time
ago, never to print such things in the paper,
because they're bad.
Now it stands to reason that if this story
doesn't get into The Daily because it is wicked,
the Roble girls shouldn't be allowed to read it,
-especially before breakfast. But the situation
has been going on for two days now and noth
ing is being done to halt this disgrace.
But even if these little stories were carefully
clipped from the sheets of Roble's papers early
every morning, a few enterprising and par
ticularly curious girls would probably hunt out
the missing stories in the Library.
The news services absolutely refuse to quit
sending stories of the trial to the San Francisco
and Peninsula papers.
From now on we should make it an honor
code offense to read about Errol Flynn and
friends.
