# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
Mr. Norton in "History—l 942" on Nov. 5 ac
cuses Mrs. Clare Boothe Luce of beinq a "sound
inq-board and pipe-line for the Luce publica
tions," inferrinq that her election to Conqress is
adverse to the welfare of the nation. Does he
recall that sometime in Auqust Mrs. Luce re
signed from the Conqressional race by her
own wishes, and later ran because she was
drafted by the Republican party in Connecticut
as their Representative from the Fourth Dis
trict? I believe this proves she is not now, nor
ever intends to be, a tool for qatherinq news
scoops for her husband's three maqazines.
An Interested Republican
The Editor, Sir:
A little delayed perhaps, but nevertheless
we want to acknowledqe the fine success of one
of the better on-campus dances of this quarter —
that qiven by the Y.W.C.A. in the Nitery on
October 30, with eaqer-to-qet-acquainted trans
fers as quests of honor. Especially we want to
thank Sally Burke for the thorouqhly swell job
she did of handlinq all arranqements, and our
appreciation, too, to the campus men who qave
their complete co-operation in one of the biq
qest blind date moves in history. All in all, it
couldn't have been a better expression of Stan
ford's new policy of stickinq close to home for
social affairs, and the old policy of friendships
for all.
It was a successful eveninq—couldn't it be
repeated? In other words, we are solidly be
hind a proqram that would include more all-
University dances in the Nitery. No qas ration
inq or lockouts to worry about, and plenty of
cokes and impromptu fun for everybody.
A Group of Well-Pleased Transfers
The Editor, Sir:
Last Saturday niqht I think Laqunita did some
thinq for campus morale. We tried to put on a
qood dance. Even a professor was eaqer enouqh
to help the students have a qood time to lend
us some valuable and practically irreplaceable
liqhtinq equipment for our luminescent deco
rations. One of those expensive pieces of liqht
inq, namely a black liqht qlobe which belonqs
to the Department of Electrical Enqineerinq,
seems to have disappeared. Maybe it qot up
and walked away after the liqhts went out.
Whatever happened to it, I'd like to tell any
one who make have seen it wanderinq around
that it is useless except in its own socket. It
just doesn't fit and what's more it needs a
special transformer to make it work and be
useful to anyone.
I don't know whether it can even be re
placed by the ten dollars and fifty cents it cost.
Althouqh the committee is more than willinq
to make this up to Mr. Brown, he needs the bulb
riqht away for experiments. I have hopes that
someone who has seen the elusive liqht will
feel thankful enouqh to trudqe the few extra
steps to the illumination lab and stick the thinq
in the keyhole.
Don't let the faculty show the students up
in thinqs like qenerosity and thinqs the "younq
er qeneration" always claim to have when they
arque that they are just as qood as their com
plaininq parents. Thanks.
