Throw a dollar out
of the window
There's a certain amount of pleasure in throwing a dol
lar bill out of the window (we suppose—we've never
tried it) ... watching it float through the air . . . guess
ing where it's going to land . . . seeing it finally settle on
a curbstone . . . and perhaps seeing some surprised indi
vidual pick it up.
At least, it's certainly more fun than throwing away
a dollar bill by paying one hundred cents extra for some
thing you're buying. Yet every year we all part with a
goodly sum of hard-earned cash that we might otherwise
save —"if we knew how to buy!"
The quickest, easiest, simplest way to learn how to
$
buy is to read the advertisements in this newspaper.
