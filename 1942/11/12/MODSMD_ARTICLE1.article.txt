# Volunteers Fail to Show At 'Air Raid'
## Lack of Cooperation Hampers Success Of Disaster Drill 
### 
The failure of many student vol
unteers to report for duty ham
pered last night's disaster drill, re
ported Prof. Edwin A. Cottrell, head
of the campus Civilian Defense dis
aster organization.
"The R.O.T.C. units responded
very well," said Cottrell, "but the
student volunteers who man most
of the disaster squads failed to
show up."
Civilian Defense heads reported
that the drill was executed much
more smoothly than was last Wed
nesday's drill, and they expressed
satisfaction with most of the units
which performed during the drill.

Several disasters were simulated
at various portions of the southeast
corner of the campus. These simu
lated disasters ranged from bomb
hits and fires to casualties. When
these incidents were reported to the
Control Center, disaster squads
were dispatched to the scene.

Last night's drill was the second
in a series of three drills, designed
to perfect the campus Civilian De
fence organization. After the third
drill next Wednesday night, a com
plete all-campus drill will be held,
according to Alfred Masters, Ci
vilian Defense administrator.
