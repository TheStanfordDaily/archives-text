# Wilbur Back From East; Cites War Situation Facing Youth
## 
### NOEL YOUNG 
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur, home after spending 10 clays in New
York and Chicago discussing war education with eminent educators and
Stanford alumni, has crystallized the situation with three convictions:
1. The armed services will fulfill their present deferment obligations to
students in the various enlisted reserves;

2. With passage of 18-year-old 4
conscription, the Army will take
complete charge of the new man
power resources, and will dictate t
who will continue college and who j
will be put into uniform;
3. Stanford University, with both j
its men and women students, stands
ready to aid the war effort with j
respect to any new demand.
CHRISTMAS VACATION
Speaking on Christmas vacation, ]
Dr. Wilbur said that "Now with stu
dents scattering across the country |
for three weeks, they will be given
the golden opportunity to aid war
occupations needing helpâ€”particu
larly the farmers."
On trains, in hotel lobbies and on
Chicago streets, Dr. Wilbur encoun
tered uniformed Stanford alumni.
One main question was on all their
lips: "What is Stanford doing to
adapt its curriculum to the war?"
Not one of the score of former stu
dents asked Dr. Wilbur about the
fraternities or the football team.
This pleased Dr. Wilbur who be- i
lieved this indicated that the peace
time conception of college life should
be and is being subordinated to the
war effort.
4-QUARTER YEAR
The question that occupies the
minds of most lower division stu
dents today is whether they will be
permitted to finish their courses be
fore going into active service. To <
this, Dr. Wilbur said that all men
students will be expected to take
advantage of the continuous four- I
quarter scholastic year.
The men already enlisted in de- i
ferment programs, he believes, are j
relatively assured they will be per- I
mitted to finish their courses, unless j
a dire emergency should arise. As j
for the younger boys falling within
scope of the new conscription, all he
could say was the Army will dictate j
their destiny.
Dr. Wilbur spoke to a convention !
of medical educators in Chicago re
garding the need for medical stu
dents in the war.
