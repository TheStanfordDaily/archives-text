# Frosh Discuss Excom Post
## 
### 
A large group of freshmen met at
Roble last night to discuss fresh
man representation on Excom. The
meeting opened with an explanation
of the purpose to all the freshmen
who came as a result of yesterday's
article in The Daily.
Because of the interest shown
and the importance of the topic it
was evident that the idea should
be presented to the whole fresh
man class. It has been arranged for
the boys to meet at Encina at 7
tonight. Similar meetings will be
held at Roble, Lagunita, Union, and
Ventura for the girls.
At these meetings it will be de
cided whether or not the class is in
favor of having the idea presented
at the next meeting of Excom. If
the interest shown at these meet
ings is great enough it is planned to
circulate a petition.
At the boys' meeting Big Game
activities will also be discussed by
Ed Stamm and representatives from
Rally Committee, the Gaieties, and
the Big Game parade.
