# FRENCH FLEET FLEES GERMAN GRASP
## Petain and Weygand Reported with Allies Swift U.S. Forces Sweep to Tunis To Intercept Air-Borne Axis Troops 
### 
LONDON, Thursday, Nov. 12 (UP). —Axis troops were
completing their occupation of France and Corsica today but
the rich prize which Adolf Hitler had hoped to gain—the
main French fleet—appeared to have eluded their grasp.
Following appeals by Allied leaders, including Lieut. Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, American commander of the North
African forces, the warships were reported to have steamed
from the French Mediterranean base of Toulon to join the
United Nations navy.
The force at Toulon was said to include three battleships,
10 cruisers and upwards of 50 destroyers. In addition, it was
reported that 17 vessels which have been interned at Alexan
dria have joined or will join the growing British and Ameri
can fleets.
The reports came from Fighting French sources in Cairo
which also said they had definite word that Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain and Gen. Maxime Weygand had left France
for Algiers to offer their services to the Allied North African
command.
Manwhile, United States forces had won full control of
Algeria and Morocco yesterday, after a lightning 76-hour
campaign, when Admiral Jean Francois Darlan ordered the
French to lay down their arms.
The cease fire order was given simultaneously on Armi
stice Day by Darlan, signing himself commander in chief of
French forces in North Africa—though he had been in Amer
ican hands since the fall of Algiers—and by Admiral Miche
lier, commander at Casablanca.
Michel ier's order ended resistance at Casablanca, chief port of Morocco
and the last point of resistance along a coastline stretching more than
1,000 miles. The fall of Rabat, capital of Morocco, had been revealed
earlier.
The sudden end of the hostilities freed the powerful American forces
to swing their full weight eastward, and swift mobile units were striking
across the desert toward a prospective collision with air-borne Axis troops
rushed to Tunis.
"Steps now are being taken to meet the German landings in Tunis,"
a spokesman said significantly.
In the Egyptian desert, the Axis air force went back into action Wed
nesday in a desperate bid to cover the Nazi retreat into Libya but British,
South African and American fliers routed it by shooting down 22 planes
and continued their merciless pounding of the shattered enemy columns.
The Axis main body is now well into Cyrenaican Libya where it faces
destruction or a hazardous evacuation from Tobruk or Benghazi, front
reports said today.

completing their occupation of France and Corsica today but
the rich prize which Adolf Hitler had hoped to gain—the
main French fleet—appeared to have eluded their grasp.
Following appeals by Allied leaders, including Lieut. Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, American commander of the North
African forces, the warships were reported to have steamed
from the French Mediterranean base of Toulon to join the
United Nations navy.
The force at Toulon was said to include three battleships,
10 cruisers and upwards of 50 destroyers. In addition, it was
reported that 17 vessels which have been interned at Alexan
dria have joined or will join the growing British and Ameri
can fleets.
The reports came from Fighting French sources in Cairo
which also said they had definite word that Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain and Gen. Maxime Weygand had left France
for Algiers to offer their services to the Allied North African
command.
Manwhile, United States forces had won full control of
Algeria and Morocco yesterday, after a lightning 76-hour
campaign, when Admiral Jean Francois Darlan ordered the
French to lay down their arms.
The cease fire order was given simultaneously on Armi
stice Day by Darlan, signing himself commander in chief of
French forces in North Africa—though he had been in Amer
ican hands since the fall of Algiers—and by Admiral Miche
lier, commander at Casablanca.
Michel ier's order ended resistance at Casablanca, chief port of Morocco
and the last point of resistance along a coastline stretching more than
1,000 miles. The fall of Rabat, capital of Morocco, had been revealed
earlier.
The sudden end of the hostilities freed the powerful American forces
to swing their full weight eastward, and swift mobile units were striking
across the desert toward a prospective collision with air-borne Axis troops
rushed to Tunis.
"Steps now are being taken to meet the German landings in Tunis,"
a spokesman said significantly.
In the Egyptian desert, the Axis air force went back into action Wed
nesday in a desperate bid to cover the Nazi retreat into Libya but British,
South African and American fliers routed it by shooting down 22 planes
and continued their merciless pounding of the shattered enemy columns.
The Axis main body is now well into Cyrenaican Libya where it faces
destruction or a hazardous evacuation from Tobruk or Benghazi, front
reports said today.
