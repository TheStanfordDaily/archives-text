WITH THE U.S. FLEET IN THE
SOUTH PACIFIC, Oct. 26 (De
layed) (UP). â€”A United States ail
craft carrier, riddled with bombs
and torpedoes in the battle of the
Santa Cruz Islands and listing
badly, keeled over and sank in the
Pacific late today.
The carrier's name cannot now be
revealed but she was the fourth
American ship of her type to be
sunk in the Pacific, following the
Lexington, Yorktown and Wasp to
the bottom. Her command and crew

i watched silently from the decks of
j rescue ships as she took her final
plunge.
(The loss of the fourth aircraft
carrier in the Battle of the Pacific
and the second during the Solo
mons campaign was announced by
the Navy in Washington on Oct. 31.)
The carrier was the victim of a
furious enemy aerial assault, as the
Japanese sent wave after wave of
dive-bombers and torpedo planes
against the American carrier and
her escort ships.
