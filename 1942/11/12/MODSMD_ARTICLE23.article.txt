### 
LONDON. Nov. 11 (UP).—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill today
pledged that "in due course" the
Allies will open a second front
across the Channel or North Sea—
perhaps even sooner than now
.seems possible — and that mean
while, with United States aid, a
death blow has been struck at the
Axis in Egypt.
His assertion was taken as defi
nite proof that the Allies have not
abandoned plans to strike at the
Axis through France, Denmark or
the Lowlands, and in some quarters
even was interpreted as meaning
that a many-pronged offensive was
planned, striking through Italy or
the Balkans as well.
Preparations for a second front
are proceeding, he said, "but should
the enemy become demoralized at
any moment, the same careful prep
arations won't be needed."
