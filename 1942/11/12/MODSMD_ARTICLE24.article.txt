VViit'll the season started Oregon Stale was defending Rose Bowl
rhampion. l! has swept through a 1941 slate nicely, ending up with two
Ideals hit( whipping Wuke at Durham. N.C. in the transplanted Pasadena
'.ante. Now, after dropping four and winning three, the Beavers are seek
ng their fourth victory. The last was a Montana rout, 33-0.
Only three starting regulars remain from the lineup that went against
the Blue Devils: Lloyd Wickett, left tackle; George Zellick. left end; and
Joe Day, fullback.
Alter winning over Idaho, 32-0, and California, 13-8, Coach Lon Stiner's
crew folded four times straight, losing to UCLA, Santa Clara, Washington
State, and Washington on consecutive weekends.

r J'.e one man who is expected to be a trouble-maker for the Cards is
Da . Some writers boom Day for all-Coast and say he is the hardest- '
hilt;ig fullback in the conference. Against weak sister Montana he carried
the l:a!l 14 times for 143 yards, averaging 10.2 per try. Not bad—against
Montana.
A. Ide from the three who started the Bowl contest, the remainder of the |

THE FIRST TIME, A CINCH:
A p'.ekcr's dream conies up in this week's football games, when such
worn! i teams as Montana and Idaho make themselves available, a tasty
disli to tlu.se who prognosticate. If these picks do not turn out 100 per cent
we will eat lots of hats for free. (The points given may not be exact, but
the winners should go 1.000. Last week's batting average was three for
five with cue win picked lying with some old lead in The Daily hackshop—
Oregon State o.er Montana by .'{s: Score—the Beavers, 33-0).
STANFORD OVER OREGON STATE BY 1
This cannot fail. Starting with the Southern California game, a one
point margin netted an upset over the Trojans, a loss to UCLA, and a win
over Washington. No ouija boards were needed for this pick, but if there
is any Daylight between the two scores we came there to talk for Joe. ;
Stanford grows by leaps and jeeps Saturday after Saturday. This should i
be no exception except that "by 1 point" is lucky.
WASHINGTON STATE OVER IDAHO BY 50
There is no use going into this pick any deeper. If Bob Kennedy couldn't
do things with the aid of one Jay Stoves, it would be different. It's just a 1
question of how long the regulars stay in.
PRE-FLIGHT OVER WASHINGTON BY 20
This should be much more conservative, but a hunch gives the Pre-
Flit',liters a three-touchdown margin with Ensign Frankie Albert retaining
a few of the tricks he showed last week against Santa Ana Air Base. Albert
handled the ball four times and scored three touchdowns or some such
ethereal nonsense. Pete Susick and his friends weren't bad against Stanford, !
but the Pre-Flighters won't even allow them to score.
use OVER OREGON BY 21
Oregon may have stopped UCLA cold, but it was only because of that j
Very adjective, plus rain and other homegrown climatic conditions. This i
.vamp will be played in sunny Southern Cal, where the Trojans level in
weet sunlight, something that puts the Ducks at a disadvantage. The |
Trojans still have the best ball club in the league from our pointed view. ;
With Tommy Roblin and all, Troy by 3 touchdowns.
CALIFORNIA OVER MONTANA BY 50
Same goes for this game that goes for Idaho. No dice for the grizzlies. J
Grover Klemmer will do the 100-yard dash in this game, deserting his
usual distance event.

THE FIRST TIME, A CINCH:
A p'.ekcr's dream conies up in this week's football games, when such
worn! i teams as Montana and Idaho make themselves available, a tasty
disli to tlu.se who prognosticate. If these picks do not turn out 100 per cent
we will eat lots of hats for free. (The points given may not be exact, but
the winners should go 1.000. Last week's batting average was three for
five with cue win picked lying with some old lead in The Daily hackshop—
Oregon State o.er Montana by .'{s: Score—the Beavers, 33-0).
STANFORD OVER OREGON STATE BY 1
This cannot fail. Starting with the Southern California game, a one
point margin netted an upset over the Trojans, a loss to UCLA, and a win
over Washington. No ouija boards were needed for this pick, but if there
is any Daylight between the two scores we came there to talk for Joe. ;
Stanford grows by leaps and jeeps Saturday after Saturday. This should i
be no exception except that "by 1 point" is lucky.
WASHINGTON STATE OVER IDAHO BY 50
There is no use going into this pick any deeper. If Bob Kennedy couldn't
do things with the aid of one Jay Stoves, it would be different. It's just a 1
question of how long the regulars stay in.
PRE-FLIGHT OVER WASHINGTON BY 20
This should be much more conservative, but a hunch gives the Pre-
Flit',liters a three-touchdown margin with Ensign Frankie Albert retaining
a few of the tricks he showed last week against Santa Ana Air Base. Albert
handled the ball four times and scored three touchdowns or some such
ethereal nonsense. Pete Susick and his friends weren't bad against Stanford, !
but the Pre-Flighters won't even allow them to score.
use OVER OREGON BY 21
Oregon may have stopped UCLA cold, but it was only because of that j
Very adjective, plus rain and other homegrown climatic conditions. This i
.vamp will be played in sunny Southern Cal, where the Trojans level in
weet sunlight, something that puts the Ducks at a disadvantage. The |
Trojans still have the best ball club in the league from our pointed view. ;
With Tommy Roblin and all, Troy by 3 touchdowns.
CALIFORNIA OVER MONTANA BY 50
Same goes for this game that goes for Idaho. No dice for the grizzlies. J
Grover Klemmer will do the 100-yard dash in this game, deserting his
usual distance event.
