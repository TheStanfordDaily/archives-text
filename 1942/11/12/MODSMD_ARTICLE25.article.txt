# El Capitan Interception Nets 7-0 Win
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Intercepting Phi Delta Theta's
last-play desperation pass, Don Ga
briel of El Capitan yesterday clawed
his way 85 yards to a touchdown and
a 7-0 victory in the most dramatic
upset of the 1!)42 intramural foot
ball season.
The Phi Delts, previously unde
feated and marked as a possible
finalist, had been bounced off the
Capitan line all afternoon. With one
play left they finally got into scor
ing position. The crucial touchdown
pass was rifled toward the goal,
heading straight for home, to a Phi
Delt end seemingly in the clear.
Then came Gabriel's finger-tip catch
and the 85-yard surge.
HIT SIX TIMES
The Capitan president was hit at
least six times on his journey, losing
one "T" shirt along the way. But he
finally broke into the clear, and
Smiley Cameron converted to make
the job complete.
Meanwhile, Delta Kappa Epsilon's
Bill Joslyn fired two touchdown
passes to John Leddy and Dick Mc-
Donough in the opening minutes of
their game with the Betas, and then
the powerhouse bogged down. The
Betas threatened at least twice in
the rest of the tilt, while the Dekes,
either fagged or disinterested, lasted
it out. Joslyn converted.
Final score: DKE, 13; Beta, 0.
FIJIS PULL MASSACRE
The Fijis pulled the massacre of
the afternoon, smashing the luckless
ATO's 35 to 0. Bill Harms was the

scores, and Cal Antrim converted
three of his tries.

gre and Biz School respectively, Al-
pha Delta Phi and Delta Chi en
gaged in an off-the-record match.

Both winners of forfeits from Ti
gre and Biz School respectively, Al-
pha Delta Phi and Delta Chi en
gaged in an off-the-record match.
The Alpha Delts pushed over a 6-0
win. Chi Psi beat AKL, 6-0.
Intercepting Phi Delta Theta's
last-play desperation pass, Don Ga
briel of El Capitan yesterday clawed
his way 85 yards to a touchdown and
a 7-0 victory in the most dramatic
upset of the 1!)42 intramural foot
ball season.
The Phi Delts, previously unde
feated and marked as a possible
finalist, had been bounced off the
Capitan line all afternoon. With one
play left they finally got into scor
ing position. The crucial touchdown
pass was rifled toward the goal,
heading straight for home, to a Phi
Delt end seemingly in the clear.
Then came Gabriel's finger-tip catch
and the 85-yard surge.
HIT SIX TIMES
The Capitan president was hit at
least six times on his journey, losing
one "T" shirt along the way. But he
finally broke into the clear, and
Smiley Cameron converted to make
the job complete.
Meanwhile, Delta Kappa Epsilon's
Bill Joslyn fired two touchdown
passes to John Leddy and Dick Mc-
Donough in the opening minutes of
their game with the Betas, and then
the powerhouse bogged down. The
Betas threatened at least twice in
the rest of the tilt, while the Dekes,
either fagged or disinterested, lasted
it out. Joslyn converted.
Final score: DKE, 13; Beta, 0.
FIJIS PULL MASSACRE
The Fijis pulled the massacre of
the afternoon, smashing the luckless
ATO's 35 to 0. Bill Harms was the
passing engineer of the win. He got
three scores on passes, two to Eric
Hauser and one to Don Dillon.
The backfield ace also ran for two
scores, and Cal Antrim converted
three of his tries.
