## Cards Out to Revenge '41 Beaver Drowning 
### 
Oregon State comes to town tomorrow, bringing with it unhappy re
membrances of an abrupt stop on Stanford's 1941 Hose Bowl trail which
ended with the Beavers upsetting the Redskins, 10-0. on a wet field at
Corvallis.
Rain poured down on the Redskins, then coached by Clark Shaughnessy.
Pete Kmetovic, fleet left half who

was such a sensation when Stanford |
licked Nebraska at the Pasadena |
oval, the year before, was injured l
early in the game and had to be !
taken out.
CARDS DROWNED OUT
The weather stayed wet, and the
Cards were drowned out. The skies
around Palo Alto have been gener
ous with sunshine so far this season
and Saturday should be no excep- |
lion.
Stanford is quoted 10-6 favorites j
by those who make the odds, and ;
strictly off form charts the Indians
are a good touchdown Qr two better, j
Coach Lon Stiner sent his charges J
through their final workout at Cor
vallis yesterday. Optimistic over the !
improvement his club showed in j
whipping Montana, 33-0, last week.
Stiner said "The men are pepping it
up more than they have all season."
BEAUCHAMP. LEFT HALF
An unexpected change in the
Beaver backfield moved Johnny f
Beauchamp, a sophomore end, to
left halfback. Beauchamp has shown
much passing possibility, and pass
ing has been something of a Water
loo for Stanford.
Coach Marchie Schwartz said last
night Buck Fawcett would not play
unless needed. Art Shipkey, who
played a bang-up game against
Washington, will start at fullback.
Schwartz will again insert Bobby
Andrews at quarterback at the
game's start, with Ray Hammett
taking, notes from the sidelines.
