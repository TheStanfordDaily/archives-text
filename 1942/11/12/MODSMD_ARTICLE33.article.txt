# Frosh Mermen Face Cal
## 
### 
With three straight victories to
their credit, Stanford's undefeated
freshman water polo team faces its
big test tomorrow afternoon when it
tangles with the California frosh at 2
o'clock in the Encina pools.
Boasting an aggressive, fast mov
ing attack, the Encinamen have had
little trouble subduing Palo Alto
High School, 6-1 and 8-2, and Se
quoia High, 8-2.
High point man for the squad is
Hugh West, forward from Palo Alto,
who scored four points in the second
game against his old alma mater.
West also plays a mean game of
basketball. Another Palo Alto prod
uct. Russell Lee, plays the other for
ward position. Lee makes up a real
brother act with one brother, Phil
Lee, a sophomore playing second
string varsity forward, and another,
Pete Lee, a junior in his second year
as first string varsity goalie.
Captain Jim Livingston joins Lee

and West in the forward rank at
sprint. He comes from Lowel! High
School and has played with the
Olympic Club. All three boys are
consistent scoring threats.
Walter Lull, center back; Barrett
Weber and Clyde Burch. guards; and
Dick Stanwood, goalie complete the
first string lineup. Gordon Farrar
and John Rhodes are capable sub
stitutes.

memory.
