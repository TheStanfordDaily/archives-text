# No Time Like the Present

WHEN the 18- and 19-year-old students are
called into the service in the early part of
1943, the government will have to drastically
change its short-sighted policy of taking college
men without discrimination. There is time now
for the government to set up an agency for the
study of the problem and to come to a sensible
conclusion.
Our government might look into the agency
set up by the War Department in 1918, which
handled the matter adeguately and efficiently.
Originally the functions of the so-called Com
mittee on Education and Special Training were
as follows:
To study the needs of the various branches of
the service for skilled men and technicians;
to determine how such needs shall be met,
whether by selective draft, special training in
educational institutions or otherwise; to secure
the co-operation of the educational institutions
of the country and to represent the War De
partment in its relations with such institutions;
to administer such plan of special training in
colleges and schools as may be adopted.
This program was put under the War Depart
ment because the bulk of the military opera
tions in 1917-18 were carried out on the ground.
If such a committee were to be set up today,
the Navy and Marine Corps would have to be
included, which would undoubtedly lead to at
least a little red tape.
At the time of the committee's appointment in
1918, it was estimated that the various corps of
the Army needed 200,000 more trained techni
cians than were available. The shortage could
not be made good through the draft without
withdrawing from the essential supporting in
dustries such large numbers of trained men
as to cripple these industries and thus to de
prive the Army of eguipment and supplies.
According to The Educational Record for Oct.,
1942, "It was also apparent that the special
schools established by the Army for the train
ing of technical specialists could not furnish the
number reguired unless they were greatly ex
panded. To meet this urgent need for additional
trained personnel by enlisting the aid of civilian
educational institutions was the first task of
the Committee on Education and Special Train
ing, indeed the principal reason for its creation.
"The committee secured the co-operation of
the technical schools and engineering depart
ments of universities which had the necessary
facilities, and arranged to send to these schools
for instruction drafted men who were volun
tarily inducted into the service on special calls
by the Provost Marshal General.
"The men were under military discipline.
They lived in barracks and drilled three hours
a day. Since speed was essential, the courses
of study were concentrated into a period of
eight weeks. They consisted chiefly of six or
seven hours of vocational training a day, con
ducted mostly in the shops. They were de
signed to prepare men to practice the mechani
cal trades reguired by the Army. Contracts
were made with the co-operating institutions
covering the costs of instruction and mainte
nance."
This is at least a starting point from which
our government officials can workâ€”that is, if
the dust can be removed from the original plan.
Now we realize the problem, but have we
done enough about it to insure victory for our
selves and to guarantee a better post-war world?
As stated before, now, before the 18- and 19-
year-olds are inducted, we should establish a
definite policy and stick to it.
