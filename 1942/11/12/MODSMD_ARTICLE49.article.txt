# History, 1942
## WHERE WE LEFT OFF 
### TED NORTON 
Yesterday was Armistice Day. As my room
mate pointed out, it also marked the beginning
of actual combat between German and Ameri
can troops in World War 11, and on French soil

The news continues good, except that the
Japs have moved back to Attu islet in the Aleu
tians, which they vacated some weeks ago.
Casablanca and Oran have capitulated, and
Admiral Darlan, who is in Allied hands, has
ordered the French in North Africa to cease all
resistance to the United Nations. We are only
260 miles from Bizerte in Tunisia; Rommel is
still running and the British have crossed into
Libya hot on his heels.
Prime Minister Churchill told Parliament to
day that an actual Second Front in Europe was
on the way, that men and materials were being
assembled for a drive across the Channel or the 1
North Sea. Churchill's comment on the African
campaign, that Roosevelt had planned it, is also
worthy of note; worthy of note because it leads
up to one of the few compliments I have ever
paid President Roosevelt. The President is a
politician, and an astute one. He deserves the
greatest credit for not having hurried, perhaps
disastrously, the African invasion as a political
gesture, with an eye on last week's elections. I
don't know the details; maybe Mr. Roosevelt
couldn't have interfered even if he wanted to
interfere. But it looks to me as though he had
this time put the welfare of the nation above
that of the Democratic party, and for that he
gets History's medal of honor.
There has been considerable controversy
over the British Empire lately. Yesterday, Sena
tor Pepper of Florida was "chilled" by Prime
Minister Churchill's declaration that the British
Empire would stand. Furthermore, there have
been pronouncements by leaders of the North
African invasion forces, that the French Empire
would be safeguarded. Although I am not as
melodramatically impressed as Senator Pepper,
still, if we are going around maintaining em
pires, what is the object of fighting the war?
One of the principles we are fighting for is self
determination, and one we should be fighting
for is a general limitation of national sover
eignty, and empire "and all that that implies"
doesn't sit well with either.
Nathan Bedford Forrester, C.S.A., once made
a remark on military science, that victory went
to the one who "got there fustest with the most
est."
The events of this war in general and of the
last few days in particular have done nothing to
upset his point.
