## FROSH ON EXCOM 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
According to your paper of yesterday, a
group of freshmen seem to advocate a change
in Stanford policy. It seems that they want to
make a change in a carefully planned consti
tution by having a freshman elected to Excom.
In my opinion a change of this sort is not neces
sary as the meetings are open to the public
and any student may voice an opinion on any
subject." The right of vote is not necessary as
I have found the Excom to be very considerate
of freshman problems as well as their others.
If this group would attend an Excom commit
tee meeting they might see just how democratic
and efficiently run it is. Of course, the student
government has certain policies, but these you
will find to be best for the average Stanford
student. We have had two "frosh only" affairs,
dates for which had to be granted through Ex
com. In both cases the frosh were given the
go ahead signal with some wise advice from
the Excom.
With these points in mind I do not think any
situation warrants a change. Perhaps too many
of the freshmen are not too well acguainted with
campus policies, but it does not justify having
another member of Excom created when the
problems of the freshman class are considered
with no little interest.
