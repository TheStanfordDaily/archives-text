# SMOKING ON QUAD
## 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
I have been taught since grammar school that
the older students always set the example for
the younger. Well, it seems to work out that
way very nicely around here.
I read an article in The Daily a few days ago
written by three seniors concerning smoking in
the Quad. Today I saw one of them merrily
puffing away on a nice long fag. What I would
like to know is how the hell is a fine tradition
like that (the one about no smoking in the Quad)
going to last with seniors and juniors setting
such examples.
These aforementioned are not the only vio
lators; the sophomores and freshmen are also
to blame. I smoke cigarettes myself, an(i I don't
seem to have any difficulty waiting until I'm off
the Quad to start smoking.
The main offenders are the law students, the
physics problem sections, the defense classes
near the engineering corner, and some of the
professors.
It is a disgrace to those of us in this Univer
sity that we can't observe a tradition. It's not
asking too much to wait until you are off the
Quad to start smoking, is it?
I hope in the future (meaning tomorrow) that
this situation will clear up.
Sincerely,
Theo. C. Tennant
