# 'Bambi' Gay, Delightful, Make-Believe
## 
### 
BAMBI. 1 ast times tomorrow at
the Varsity Theater.
"Bambi" is a monument in 20th
Century art and 20th Century tech
nology. It is also as delightful a
motion picture as you would ever
hope to see.
Animation's rapid development
has yet some way to go. but few pic
tures, drawn or otherwise, could
hardly come nearer the goal of per
fect integration than the lavishly
colored, choral-accompanied, simply
plotted ''Bambi."
The inherent gaiety of its make
believe, of humanized animals in the
forest, is nowhere more hilariously
illustrated than in the "twitter
pated" sequence, wherein the skunk
("You can call me Flower if you
want to"), Thumper the rabbit, and
Prince Bambi are each in turn snared
by the female of their species.—
Covey.

There is plenty of learning in the
universities. The freshman brings
some with him and the senior takes
nothing away with him—so there's
quite an accumulation.
