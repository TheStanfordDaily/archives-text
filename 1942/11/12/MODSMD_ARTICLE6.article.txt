## 
### 
Rumbas! Tangos! Joropas Congas!
â€”rhythm in any language but "los
tipicos of Spain. Thursday evening
a group of people from the Univer
sity's Spanish classes will gather to
hear Spanish records from all Latin-
American countries. Everyone is
wclcome to attend this social gather
ing: the only requirement is that
Spanish alone be spoken.
Among things to be discussed will
be the rapidly growing demand for
tickets to Saturday evening's per
formance of "La Liga de las Can
ciones," Mexican musical comedy
which has been pronounced the
ideal vehicle for Stanford's inter
ested language students. Tickets are
available from members of all Span
ish classes.
