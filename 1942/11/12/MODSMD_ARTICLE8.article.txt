# New Plan Submitted To Excom
## Reorganization Will Adapt Government To 4-Quarter Year 
### 
A proposed scheme for reorgani
zation of the Executive Committee
was given a vote of confidence last
night by Excom members.
The plan was submitted by a
committee headed by Bob Hammett.
Tlie reorganization, in brief, will
be an adaption of student govern
ment to the four-quarter year and
will provide for adequate student
government in Summer Quarters
for the duration. Under the pres
ent system, Excom members are
elected for a year, which normally
includes a term of three quarters,
but which necessitates a four-quar
ter term with the inclusion of a
regular Summer Quarter.
Another feature of the scheme is
a provision for alternate officers to
fill in for Excom members who may
be drafted or unable to attend Sum
mer Quarter. The reorganization
involves constitutional amendment
and is being referred to Marion
Kirkwood, Law School Dean, who
will investigate legal implications.

In a move to improve relations
with foreign students attending
Stanford, Excom appropriated $40
to Janet Snelling, International
Club. The fund will be used to pro
vide social affairs for foreign stu
dents during the current year.
