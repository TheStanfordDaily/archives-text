The council has yet to decide
whether there will be a single pledge
dance for all the houses, or whether
| each house will give its own dance.
At the meeting, Lee Peake, Inter
fraternity Council president, said
that thus far the fraternities have
co-operated with rushing rules. He
warned the members, however, that
"Inasmuch as the rules were estab
lished through action of the Inter
j fraternity Council, the Inter-frater
j nity Board would find it necessary
to enforce the rules to the letter.
PLEDGE LISTS
During the course of the meeting,
Peake asked that the names of ail
men who have been pledged since
last year's formal pledging be sent
to the Interfraternity office.
The new year's rushing was orig
inally scheduled for the present
quarter, but was postponed until
Winter Quarter at an earlier meet- i
ing.
