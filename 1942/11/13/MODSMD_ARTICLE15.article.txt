# Allies Roll To Border Of Tunisia As R.A.F. Smashes Axis Planes
## Allies Sweep Into Bone As British Battleships Land Reinforcements; French Flotilla Remains at Toulon 
### 
LONDON, Nov. 12 (U.R)—Powerful Allied forces swept tonight to the
threshold of Tunisia, strategic French protectorate over which a struggle
for control of the skies already was raging, after driving past the Algerian
port of Bone where American reinforcements were landing.
The Vichy radio reported that Bone, 50 miles west of the frontier, fell

at lOioO a.m. to the swift Allied mo
torized and armored columns which
by now were believed very close to
the border if some advance units had
not already crossed for the show
down with the Axis.
RAF bombers from Malta had
eased the way for the Allies with a
crushing raid on the airport*near
Tunis which wrecked or crippled 3K
planes, and the Rome radio reported
a tangle between Italian and Allied
fighter planes over Cape j Bon, 145
miles inside Tunisia from Algeria.
This indicated Allied fighters were
operating from new forward bases
in Algeria or that long-range fight
ers from Malta had joined the fray.
YANKS LAND AT BONK
Vichy said the American rein
forcements at Bone were landing
from British warships.
The stakes of the impending bat
tle were the excellent Bizerte naval
base, dominating the vital Sicilian
Straits, and Adolf Hitler was be
lieved gambling every man and
machine he could ,'fpare in an ef
fort to hold one strong point on his
crumbling Mediterranean flank.
The Allied army, now believed
nearing the frontier at La Calle, is
spearheaded by the crack British
First Army, made up of reorganized
and re-equipped veterans of Dun
kirk who are regarded as the finest
fighters in the Empire. Their com
mander, Lt. Gen. K. A. N. Anderson,
is in charge of the entire Allied ex
pedition in Tunisia.
TO JOIN U.S. TROOPS
The First Army was reported
pouring ashore along the eastern Al
gerian coast to join the two U.S.
Army columns, one of which was
advancing along the coast and the
other inland to the southeast toward
central Tunisia and on a direct line
with the Axis base of Tripoli belond.
The British First Army numbers
around 150,000 men and includes an
armored division while a large part
of the original A.E.F. in North Africa
—estimated by the French at 140,-
000 men—plus American reinforce
ments were believed taking part in
the drive.

The stakes of the impending bat
tle were the excellent Bizerte naval
base, dominating the vital Sicilian
Straits, and Adolf Hitler was be
lieved gambling every man and
machine he could ,'fpare in an ef
fort to hold one strong point on his
crumbling Mediterranean flank.
The Allied army, now believed
nearing the frontier at La Calle, is
spearheaded by the crack British
First Army, made up of reorganized
and re-equipped veterans of Dun
kirk who are regarded as the finest
fighters in the Empire. Their com
mander, Lt. Gen. K. A. N. Anderson,
is in charge of the entire Allied ex
pedition in Tunisia.
TO JOIN U.S. TROOPS
The First Army was reported
pouring ashore along the eastern Al
gerian coast to join the two U.S.
Army columns, one of which was
advancing along the coast and the
other inland to the southeast toward
central Tunisia and on a direct line
with the Axis base of Tripoli belond.
The British First Army numbers
around 150,000 men and includes an
armored division while a large part
of the original A.E.F. in North Africa
—estimated by the French at 140,-
000 men—plus American reinforce
ments were believed taking part in
the drive.
LONDON, Nov. 12 (U.R)—Powerful Allied forces swept tonight to the
threshold of Tunisia, strategic French protectorate over which a struggle
for control of the skies already was raging, after driving past the Algerian
port of Bone where American reinforcements were landing.
The Vichy radio reported that Bone, 50 miles west of the frontier, fell

at lOioO a.m. to the swift Allied mo
torized and armored columns which
by now were believed very close to
the border if some advance units had
not already crossed for the show
down with the Axis.
RAF bombers from Malta had
eased the way for the Allies with a
crushing raid on the airport*near
Tunis which wrecked or crippled 3K
planes, and the Rome radio reported
a tangle between Italian and Allied
fighter planes over Cape j Bon, 145
miles inside Tunisia from Algeria.
This indicated Allied fighters were
operating from new forward bases
in Algeria or that long-range fight
ers from Malta had joined the fray.

forcements at Bone were landing
