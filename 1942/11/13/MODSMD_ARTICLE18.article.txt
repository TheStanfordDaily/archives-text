# Big Game's Late Leave Plan Altered
## 
### 
Plans for Big Game weekend are
going into the final week with the j
news that all women's late leaves I
have been changed from the Big j
Game night 3:.'io's to the regular j
2:3o's. This move has been taken in
an endeavor to keep students on the
campus, instead of going to San [
Francisco or to Del Monte.
Highlighting Big Game weekend j
activities will be the Pied and White {
Bail scheduled for the evening after ;
the game in the Women's Gym to j
the music of Gary Nottingham.
The changing of the late leaves
should keep more of the student
body on campus, while tire short- j
ages will keep many off the high- j
ways. In an effort to comply with j
the war program, the Big Game i
committee voted to have this year's I
celebration on-campus instead of at j
a country club, as has been the cus
tom in former years.
The hours of the affair have been
set from 9 to 1, and dress is option
ally formal. Tickets may be pur
chased now at the A.S.S.U. office
for the price of $2.75, which is quite
a reduction from last year's bid
price.
Ted Eberle, chairman of the Big
Game dance plans, promises excel
lent refreshments and decorations in
keeping with the nominal price.
