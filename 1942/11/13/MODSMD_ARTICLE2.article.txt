# Indians Favored Over O.S.C. By 2-1 Odds; Kickoff at 2:30
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
San Francisco odds makers, tired
of losing their best shorts by mak
ing Stanford a short-ender every
Saturday, tumbled over'ooard in
their wild goodness this week and
slapped the Indians into the role
of 2-1 favorite for their game with
Oregon State tomorrow. It's the
first time the Cards have been pub
lic choices since the Idaho contest.
Why the wgaer wags quote Mar
chie Schwartz' eleven so highly
seems apparent at first, but then
again the bettors have been mis
taken before. Here's how they fig
ure it out, simple as Simon: Wash
ington licked Oregon State and
Stanford dumped the Huskies. Pure
and simple logic, but logic lately has
gone haywire in this football
FOOLED EM TWICE
Stanford, the bookmakers figured,
shouldn't have beaten Southern
California or Washington or U.C.-
L.A. Well, the Indians fooled 'em
twice when underdogs but couldn't
quite do it the third when made
10-6 short-ender against the Bruins.
So Stanford is favored. A new
era is upon us. Last time Stanford
was favored it won, but who would
n't be favored over Idaho?
Now, in their new position of
favorite, what will the Redskins do?
USE FAWCETT SPARINGLY
They'll have Buck Fawcett, but
only sparingly. They'll miss Loren
LaPrade, sidelined until Big Game
with a wrenched knee. Loren will
sit in by remote control as one of
the four junior captains along with
Fawcett, Bill Sheller and Jim Cox.
LaPrade's spiritual uplift may be
worth its weight in hard knocks to
Bill Young, who takes his place.
Because Fawcett is temporarily
slowed down, Art Shipkey will play
boomer from the middle of the T
formation. Shipkey is capable. He
ripped off lots of yardage against
Washington, once almost scoring.
The remainder of Stanford's club
is intact, including its stalwart line
of Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Young, Bru
no Banducci, and Roger Laverty,
reading from left to right.
Stanford's pass defense bugaboo,
a major calamity when pitted
against a good passing opponent,
was worked on all day yesterday
at the final practice. It is now up
lo those who defend to make good.





THE FOUR JUNIORS above will co-captain the Stanford team Sat
urday in the game against the Oregon State Beavers: Hill Shelter,
upper left; Lorcn LaPrade, upper right: Buck Fawcett, lower left; and
Jim Cox ; lower right.
Lon Stiner's Beavers aren't con
sidered as a team that uses an aerial
offense greatly, but their optional
end run-pass set-up can mean plen
ty of air fireworks. John Beau
champ will be the Orange tailback
tomorrow, taking the . ball from
center most of the time. Watch
him for passing, running, and any
thing else the wily Stiner may have
cooked up recently.
As usual — Stiner-coached teams
always use them —the Beavers will
probably amaze the skimpy popu
lace in attendance with some
.screwy defensive tactics, such as
three- and four-man lines and
seven- and eight-man backftelds.
For the last two years, as evi
denced by movies of the game, those
crazy lop-sided defenses were used
and used in advantageous manner
too.
It's an outright cinch that no dia
mond defense will give Ray Ham
mett a chance to breeze his passes
to receivers with no defenders
around them.
Result: Stanford by one point.

tomorrow, taking the . ball from
center most of the time. Watch
him for passing, running, and any
thing else the wily Stiner may have
cooked up recently.
As usual — Stiner-coached teams
always use them —the Beavers will
probably amaze the skimpy popu
lace in attendance with some
.screwy defensive tactics, such as
three- and four-man lines and
seven- and eight-man backftelds.
For the last two years, as evi
denced by movies of the game, those
crazy lop-sided defenses were used
and used in advantageous manner
too.
It's an outright cinch that no dia
mond defense will give Ray Ham
mett a chance to breeze his passes
to receivers with no defenders
around them.
Result: Stanford by one point.
San Francisco odds makers, tired
of losing their best shorts by mak
ing Stanford a short-ender every
Saturday, tumbled over'ooard in
their wild goodness this week and
slapped the Indians into the role
of 2-1 favorite for their game with
Oregon State tomorrow. It's the
first time the Cards have been pub
lic choices since the Idaho contest.
Why the wgaer wags quote Mar
chie Schwartz' eleven so highly
seems apparent at first, but then
again the bettors have been mis
taken before. Here's how they fig
ure it out, simple as Simon: Wash
ington licked Oregon State and
Stanford dumped the Huskies. Pure
and simple logic, but logic lately has
gone haywire in this football
FOOLED EM TWICE
Stanford, the bookmakers figured,
shouldn't have beaten Southern
California or Washington or U.C.-
L.A. Well, the Indians fooled 'em
twice when underdogs but couldn't
quite do it the third when made
10-6 short-ender against the Bruins.
So Stanford is favored. A new
era is upon us. Last time Stanford
was favored it won, but who would
n't be favored over Idaho?
Now, in their new position of
favorite, what will the Redskins do?
USE FAWCETT SPARINGLY
They'll have Buck Fawcett, but
only sparingly. They'll miss Loren
LaPrade, sidelined until Big Game
with a wrenched knee. Loren will
sit in by remote control as one of
the four junior captains along with
Fawcett, Bill Sheller and Jim Cox.
LaPrade's spiritual uplift may be
worth its weight in hard knocks to
Bill Young, who takes his place.
Because Fawcett is temporarily
slowed down, Art Shipkey will play
boomer from the middle of the T
formation. Shipkey is capable. He
ripped off lots of yardage against
Washington, once almost scoring.
The remainder of Stanford's club
is intact, including its stalwart line
of Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Young, Bru
no Banducci, and Roger Laverty,
reading from left to right.
Stanford's pass defense bugaboo,
a major calamity when pitted
against a good passing opponent,
was worked on all day yesterday
at the final practice. It is now up
lo those who defend to make good.





THE FOUR JUNIORS above will co-captain the Stanford team Sat
urday in the game against the Oregon State Beavers: Hill Shelter,
upper left; Lorcn LaPrade, upper right: Buck Fawcett, lower left; and
Jim Cox ; lower right.
Lon Stiner's Beavers aren't con
sidered as a team that uses an aerial
offense greatly, but their optional
end run-pass set-up can mean plen
ty of air fireworks. John Beau

tomorrow, taking the . ball from

against a good passing opponent,
was worked on all day yesterday
at the final practice. It is now up
lo those who defend to make good.





THE FOUR JUNIORS above will co-captain the Stanford team Sat
urday in the game against the Oregon State Beavers: Hill Shelter,
upper left; Lorcn LaPrade, upper right: Buck Fawcett, lower left; and
Jim Cox ; lower right.
Lon Stiner's Beavers aren't con
sidered as a team that uses an aerial
offense greatly, but their optional
end run-pass set-up can mean plen
ty of air fireworks. John Beau
champ will be the Orange tailback
tomorrow, taking the . ball from
center most of the time. Watch
him for passing, running, and any
thing else the wily Stiner may have
cooked up recently.
As usual — Stiner-coached teams
always use them —the Beavers will
probably amaze the skimpy popu
lace in attendance with some
.screwy defensive tactics, such as
three- and four-man lines and
seven- and eight-man backftelds.
For the last two years, as evi
denced by movies of the game, those
crazy lop-sided defenses were used
and used in advantageous manner
too.
It's an outright cinch that no dia
mond defense will give Ray Ham
mett a chance to breeze his passes
to receivers with no defenders
around them.
Result: Stanford by one point.
