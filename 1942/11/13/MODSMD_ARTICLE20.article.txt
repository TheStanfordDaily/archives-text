# WAVES In Training Find Midshipman Life Rigerous
## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
So you had to get up for an S ,
j o'clock this morning . . . tough! j
i You're not going to take any more
8 o'clock classes because if it's this
cold now . . . it'll be freezing at 7
a.m. (Win the War Time) Winter
Quarter.
Yet in the Army . . . where men
are men and Stanford rough means
rough . . . the men are getting up at
dawn . . . not to stumble onto Quad
I to relax in an 8 o'clock . . . but to
drill for hours. They are putting
' every ounce of energy into learning
| military tactics and subjects vital to
their work. Not for an A or B or C
j . . . but for their livesâ€”and ours.
Stanford women, too, are subject
' ing themselves (and here it is purely
i voluntary) to early rising. Reveille j
sounds at 6:15 for the WAVES.
Breakfast . . . not just coffee, on the
run, but breakfast designed to give
strength and stamina to the midship
i men is served half an hour before
j 99 per cent of campus alarm clocks
j sound off for 7:15 risers.
Lt. Elizabeth B. Crandall, on leave
! of absence from the Farm where she
j acted as assistant, dean of women is
the executive officer of the Women's J
Reserve, U.S.N., stationed at Smith 1
College.
Stanford names in V-!) listings that
echoed on the Quad and in Farm
; committee rooms just a short time j
ago include Sylvia Berry, Marilyn
Scott, Mary Elizabeth Miller. Elaine
Stone, B a r b a r a Smith, Virginia \
Rooney, Harriet Caroline Leon. Bet
ty Burroughs, Barbara Tackaberry, !
Jane Eaton, Kathleen Patricia Mc- |
Murty, and Virginia Adams Marvin.
These are women who took an ac
tive part in American life.
In their regimented day the
i WAVES rise at "6:15, breakfast at i
6:45 and have classes from 8 to 10. j
\ They drill from 10 to 10:30 and take i
: cart in physical education and ath- [
I letics from 10:30 to 12 . . . (this is I

I every day . . . and we scream about
1 the new 3-hour per-week gym re
j quirements!) Lunch is from 12 to
! 12:30. They study from 1 to 2 and
| hold classes from 3 to 5.
Recreation is from 5 to 6 . . . (this
! percentage cf recreational time
would stack up poorly against what
| the local co-eds generously allow
} themselves) . . . Dinner is from 6 to
0:30 . . . they study from (i:45 to
7:30. From 7:45 to 9 the time is de
voted to evening lectures, educa
tional film and discussion periods.
From !) to 10 is free and at 10 . . .
Taps.
Of course this isn't always so bad
I . . . Reveille sounds at 7:05 on the
i Sabbath.
! After four months of this regi
mentation ... a life entirely new to
them . . . the women graduate as
ensigns and lieutenants to take over
jobs relieving men on shore duty.
They are trained as technicians,
and for general administrative and
communications assignments as
! meteorologists, physicists, lab. ex
| perts, radio engineers, assistant plant
j managers, important confidential of
| t'ices, cvyptanalysts, code and signal
1 workers, administrative assistants,
{ and executive officers.
The snappy navy costumes of
I these women in the navy with pow
der blue insignia and cocked hats
have been designed by Mainbocher
| who did the wardrobes of the
I Duchess of Windsor. This may glad
den the hearts of those who occas
ionally yearn for high heels and vel
| vet and taffeta combines.
Extra-curricular activities has
j taken on a new term for midship
men ... at least for those who came
, from Stanford. Northampton offers
i the Trvon Art Gallery, three movie
j houses, and riding at the Smith Col-
I lege Stables.
But then, these midshipmen don't
I need extra-curricular activities.
