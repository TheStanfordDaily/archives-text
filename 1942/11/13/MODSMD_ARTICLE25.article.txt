# Card Mermen Face Cat Today; Bacon Injured
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Faced by the loss of Captain Hadley Bacon, starting forward. Stanford's
varsity water polo team will battle California here this afternoon in the
first of a two-game series against their traditional rivals from across the
Bay.
The varsity contest will start at 4 and the frosh game at 3 o'clock in the

Encina pools. 4
There was temporary hope that j
Bacon, who broke three ribs in a fall
l from a horse last Sunday, would be ,
I able to play, but Coach Ernie
Brands ten reported him definitely
| out yesterday.
CARPENTER PLAYS
His place will be taken by Jack
Carpenter, a junior, who has seen a |
lot of action as a reserve this year
on Stanford's once-beaten team. ;
Emmett Cashin and Bill Mapel al- j
ternate at sprint and the other for
ward position.
Mapel, a senior, played first l
! string sprint last year and has proven
himself a fast, capable player. J
Cashin, a transfer eligible for the
first time this year, is even faster
than Mapel but lacks his experience. '
Between the two, they have given
I Stanford a consistent advantage at
this position.
Bob Jones, another senior, will
I start at centerback, while sopho
mores Dick Narver and Al Weeden
I will start at guards. Jones, one of j
the top performers on the 1941 team,
j was bothered by an operation at the '
| start of the year, but has turned in |
consistently good performances in
I the past few weeks.
TEAM INJURIES
Narver has had a bad leg and Al
| Weeden has had ear trouble recent- !
ly, but they seem to be recovered
| now. Don Smith, rugged senior, may |
start in Weeden's place. Pete Lee I
j will play goalie.
Upon them will fall the job of
stopping Johnny Norris, California

scoring ace. Don Beanston and Hal
Morketter, two former freshman
stars, play forward and sprint, re
spectively, but Norris is the big
scoring threat.
In contrast to Stanford's con
stantly shifting offense, California
plays the man-in-the-hole game
trying to break Norris into the clear
for a shot. And the system seems to
have worked well. After losing their
first contest, 17-8, to the powerful
Olympic Club, the Bears came back
to beat the Clubmen, 8-5, and then
trounced San Jose State last Tues
day, 17-5.
NORRIS RECORD
Norris scored five points against
the club team and eight points
against the Spartans.
Since California's present coach,
Al Dowden, has been with the
Bears, the Bears have won 9. Stan
lord 12. After three years of split
series, Stanford won both Big
Games, 7-4 and 7-6, last year. The
final game saw Bert Singer, reserve
forward, put in the winning goal in
the final minute of play.
Captain Jim Livingston will lead
his undefeated fresh ma n team
against the Bear Cubs in the pre
liminary. Starting frosh lineup will
be Livingston, sprint; Hugh West
and Russell Lee, forwards; Walt
Lull, centerback; Barrett Weber,
and Clyde Burch; guards; and Dick
Stanwood, goalie.
