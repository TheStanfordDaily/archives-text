# Stanford-San Mateo to Mix In Important Soccer Match
## 
### BOB FISHER 
Retaining a slim chance for the conference championship, Stanford's
once-defeated soccer team takes on San Mateo J.C. tomorrow morning at
10:."Â»() on Harry Maloney Field.
Since San Mateo discontinued football this year, her soccer team is
made up chiefly of ex-football men. This will insure some rugged if not
too dextrous competition for the In- +

dian varsity.
San Mateo's conference record up
to date includes two close defeats,
and they will be gunning for their
first win against Stanford. Al An
derson, outside left, and a shifty
center forward from Madrid, Spain,
are the two chief scoring threats.
WILLIAMS O.K.
Dave Williams, who transferred
from San Mateo this fall, has been
declared eligible for Stanford and
will probably start at center for
ward in place of Louis Chang who
was hurt last week against San Jose
State. Chang will see some action
if his leg gets in shape by game
time. Williams will be flanked by
John Gertridge and Tommy Trent
as inside forwards and Dave Bills
and Bud Crary at the wings.
The same three halfbacks who
have been doing most of the play
ing this season will start again to
morrow. George Koffer will be at
center half, with Russ Bryan at left
and Tom Ohliger at right.
WILBUR GOALIE
Dick Wilbur will probably see
some action in the goalie's net with
Frank Jameson and Chris Cusack
available as fullbacks. Joe Welsh,
Jim Boswell, and Bob Mills are
three experienced halfs who will
probably be assigned to consider
able duty. Reserve forwards are the
chief problem, but Bob Barker and
Art Sweetzer should be able to fill
any gaps.
Stanford's record this season is
not as impressive as last year, but
they still retain third place in the
league standings behind San Jose
State and San Francisco State with

one victory, one defeat, and two ties
to their credit. A week from to
morrow, the Maloneymen face Cali
fornia in the first of a bitter two
game series.
CAL TO PLAY
Cal gets its first big test of the
season tomorrow morning against
the San Francisco State Gaters.
Both teams are undefeated and the
game will be crucial in the league
standings. Stanford tied State ear
lier in the season and the results
of tomorrow's game will give some
indication of the Bears' strength.
The Stanford frosh have a return
game with Menlo J.C. next Wed
nesday afternoon at 4. The fresh
men will also meet California a
week from tomorrow, the day of the
Big Game, in the morning at Berke
ley. The following week, Califor
nia will journey to Stanford for the
second game of the series.
Tomorrow's varsity game with
San Mateo will begin at 10:30 sharp.
