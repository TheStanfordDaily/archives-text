# Face the Facts

### 
STANFORD students don't give a damn about
responsibility. Two weeks ago over 20
persons failed to show for work in orchards
and in the beet fields. Before that cannery
workers volunteered but mysteriously disap
peared when they were needed for work.
Wednesday Stanford had a disaster drill,
believe it or not. For the last two weeks the
Civilian Defense Council has been training
campus units individually instead of taking the
entire campus at once in order to perfect the
organization.
Wednesday night could have been tragic for
Stanford. When all of the preparations had been
completed for the drill only the R.O.T.C. stu
dents and a few volunteers appeared to meet
the emergency. The R.O.T.C. men appeared
because they are under orders; the volunteers
didn't show because they had other things to
do or just forgot.
Obviously, it would be easy to say things
wouldn't be that way if a real attack occurred,
but we can't afford to take chances. If we can
act smoothly under mock conditions, we prob
ably will work fairly well under pressure; at
least we will know our duties. If we aren't
interested enough to participate in a mock
emergency, what would happen if the real
thing came along?
We are a great bunch of shirkers. We don't
seem to care what happens to the other fellow
just as long as we are satisfied and able to
live our own lives without any sense of respon
sibility for the safety and well-being of others.
At the first of the quarter, The Daily had the
feeling that Stanford's "Ivory Tower" was
crumbling in a stumbling sort of way. Now we
have our doubts. Drills of this sort are far more
important than intramural athletics, dates, and
even studies. We have to be ready, and we
have to face the facts.
Our professors, among them Professor Cot
trell and Mr. Masters of the 8.A.C., have been
working hard getting the Civilian Defense pro
gram outlined and in good working order. Their
method of training part of the campus at a time
is excellent; their spirit and responsibility has
been something to be admired.
We can't save this campus from attack with
out manpower. Potentially, we have that man
power. But it is so dormant that is practically
dead. Many have siad, "All we need to wake
us up is a real attack."
That's rather cruel and heartless, but we
can't be wishy-washy now.
Next week we will have another chance to
redeem ourselves. We shouldn't have to re
deem ourselves at a time like this, but that's
the way things stack up.
Wake up, Stanford, and face your responsi
bility. Today's mistakes will mean losses to
morrow losses which we can't afford to have.
That Ivory Tower had better crush its founda
tions soon, or we will be lost, lost in a world
of reality which we have not seen fit to face.
