# BULL SESSION

### H. D. THOREAU 
What were you doing Wednesday morning
at 11 a.m.?
I was walking by the Engineering corner
with Russ Bryan discussing the problems of
the world on my way to Mr. Lievsay's class.
At that moment 24 years ago a pact was
signed ending a war, but I did not think of that
last Wednesday. Ever since 1918, it has been
a tradition in this country, and in others, to stop
at 11 a.m., Nov. 11, for an entire minute in mem
ory of all those who died in that war-to-end-all
wars.
But this year those unknown soldiers, who
fought and died to save the world for democ
racy a quarter of a century ago, did not get that
one minute of tribute that had been set aside
for them once every 12 months.
People did not pay much attention to that
tradition that says we are to have a moment of
silence for those men, but then, people haven't
been paying much attention to what those men
tried to do when they were alive either, so why
be hypocritical?
The president of a large defense plant issued
a statement to the effect that his men would not
stop work for that minute because of the tre
mendous loss that would mean when multiplied
by 5,000 workers. He said instead his men
would work all the harder at that time, because
he was sure that was what those unknown sol
diers would want, were they alive today.
But they aren't alive today.
Twenty-five years from today will some un
thinking student not stop and pay tribute to me,
because he's engrossed in getting himself
through school so he can go out and help fight
the war that has just sprung up?
Will he look back and scoff at me because I
fought and died in the war "in which for the
first time in history, there is no question of
who's right and who's wrong"?
Will he say that I wouldn't have wanted him
to stop and remember me, that 1 would rather
have him keep going every minute in order to
defeat the enemy?
Oh, I don't know. If I'm going to die pretty
soon, I would just as soon have someone re
member me in 25 years, rather than go out and
get himself killed.

the world on my way to Mr. Lievsay's class.
At that moment 24 years ago a pact was
signed ending a war, but I did not think of that
last Wednesday. Ever since 1918, it has been
a tradition in this country, and in others, to stop
at 11 a.m., Nov. 11, for an entire minute in mem
ory of all those who died in that war-to-end-all
wars.
But this year those unknown soldiers, who
fought and died to save the world for democ
racy a quarter of a century ago, did not get that
one minute of tribute that had been set aside
for them once every 12 months.
People did not pay much attention to that
tradition that says we are to have a moment of
silence for those men, but then, people haven't
been paying much attention to what those men
tried to do when they were alive either, so why
be hypocritical?
The president of a large defense plant issued
a statement to the effect that his men would not
stop work for that minute because of the tre
mendous loss that would mean when multiplied
by 5,000 workers. He said instead his men
would work all the harder at that time, because
he was sure that was what those unknown sol
diers would want, were they alive today.
But they aren't alive today.
Twenty-five years from today will some un
thinking student not stop and pay tribute to me,
because he's engrossed in getting himself
through school so he can go out and help fight
the war that has just sprung up?
Will he look back and scoff at me because I
fought and died in the war "in which for the
first time in history, there is no question of
who's right and who's wrong"?
Will he say that I wouldn't have wanted him
to stop and remember me, that 1 would rather
have him keep going every minute in order to
defeat the enemy?
Oh, I don't know. If I'm going to die pretty
soon, I would just as soon have someone re
member me in 25 years, rather than go out and
get himself killed.
What were you doing Wednesday morning
at 11 a.m.?
I was walking by the Engineering corner
with Russ Bryan discussing the problems of
the world on my way to Mr. Lievsay's class.
