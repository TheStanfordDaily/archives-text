# Campus Opinion
## CAMPUS FAVORS LONG VACATION 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
So reads the headline over an article in the
Stanford Daily. Reading on, one discovers that
such is really the opinion of the "Stanford
Family." For the first time in my life I am bit
terly ashamed to be a member of this Family.
The Russian soldiers at Stalingrad "favored"
a long vacation too; but, realizing that the most
desirable things are not always the most ex
pedient, they spent their 24-hour leave unload
ing supply ships up the Volga. The heroic
Marines on Guadalcanal "favored" a long va
cation too; but they realize that the honorable
Japanese were even more strongly in favor of
the American Marines taking a much-needed
vacation. The doughboys at desolate Dutch
Harbor "favored" a long Christmas vacation
too —(after all, they had important matters to
discuss with the folks at home)—but they knew
that someone had to prevent the wily Jap from
creeping down the coast to Seattle.
For shame, you pleasure-loving Stanford en
gineer who has to learn how to build bridges
instead of being blown to bits on the shore near
Dieppe!
For shame, you selfish Economics major who
has to study the peaceful art of Accounting
under spreading oak trees while your fellow
men are sweating in tanks on the Libyan desert!
For shame, you short sighted Reservist who
has to learn high school trigonometry so that
the gob rescued from the sinking "Wasp" may
someday take orders from your lips!
And for shame, you frivolous Stanford woman
who has become adept at arranging class sched
ules to fit in with late evening hours, while your
British sisters are up at 6 to direct traffic in
crater-marked London!
Yes, we have been given our "sorely needed"
vacation. We have been granted our month of
play. But are you proud of this Mr. Engineer?
Are you proud of your accomplishments Mr.
Economist and Mr. Reservist? Are you, Miss
Stanford Woman, are you not secretly ashamed
of your piteous outcries against a necessary
elimination of Christmas merrymaking?
And you, all of you Stanford men and women,
faculty members and students: Do you now
feel justified in proclaiming from the roof tops
that American universities are "doing more than
their share in the all-out war effort"?
The elimination of Christmas vacation this
year might have served a worthy purpose: The
security of future vacations.
Although it cannot be that he is alone, this
physicist is ashamed; ashamed of his Stanford
family which is not content with its enviable
lot, but above all, ashamed of his elected repre
sentatives who wilted in the face of whole
heartpdly selfish opposition to their noble plan.
War-Scientist.
