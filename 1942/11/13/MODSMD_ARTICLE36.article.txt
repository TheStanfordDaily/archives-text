# Movies' Version of Iceland Mixes Heine and Marines
## 
### 
"Iceland," now playing at the I
Stanford Theater.
The Marines have landed and it's j
cause for celebration in 20th Cen- I
tury style. Starring Sonja Henie as
the Iceland maid and John Payne as
the Marine, you can expect anything,
and it turns out to be very enter
taining though slightly exaggerated.
It seems that the Icelandish have
a strange custom that the oldest
daughter must marry before the
other daughters can take the step.
Sonja's younger sister is all ready
and her man is waitingâ€”in fact
they are both waiting for Sonja to
find her mate. Then come the Ma
rines!

Payne pulls a good American line, j
works faster than anything ever |
seen, and the poor girl has the wed- i
ding planned. And then he tries to 1
take back everything he said, but !
Sonja wins in the end.
As in every Henie picture, the
skating scenes are spectacular but
these are even better than that. |
The Icelandish outdo themselves
with costumes and scenery that is
better than Madison Square for a
Red Cross benefit. These include
scenes from China, Panama, and
Hawaii and until you have seen a
hula on ice, you haven't lived.
