# Beet Field Work Lauded By Official
## 
### 
Stanford's beet-topping activities
have brought commendation from
Roland Tognizzani, president of the
Union Sugar Co. Rosemary Cross,
SWB chairman, has received a tele
gram on behalf of the sugar beet in
dustry which reads:
"The wonderful work you and
your associates have done in re
cruiting Stanford students to assist
with the harvest of sugar beets has
been called to my attention. I hope
to express on behalf of my com
pany, and I am sure on behalf
also of the industry, our keen ap
preciation for this most worth
while service which you are rend
ering the country in this time of
need. That sugar is scarce is not
to be questioned in as much as
the Department of Agriculture
has asked an increased acreage to
be planted to sugar beets in 1943.
Since wc are fast approaching the
winter season and since many
beets still remain in the fields I
sincerely trust that your fine ef
fort will continue unabated.
(Signed)."
The beet-toppers turned out ac
cording to schedule this week, ac
cording to Luana Forkner, super
visor of crop crews. Tuesday, crews
from the Beta, Delta Chi, and Sigma
Chi houses worked in Harley Jen
ecke's beet fields.
Wednesday, teams from Encina,
Sigma Chi, and ATO topped beets.
Yesterday, 31 men from El Toro, El
Capitan, Phi Delts, and El Campo
turned out. The Sigma Nu's and
Thcta Chi's arc scheduled to work
today.
Luana Forkner commented that
response from the eating clubs has
been excellent, but that Encina's 500
men have given relatively poor sup
port.
Beet-topping will probably be
finished by the end of next week. A
trophy will be awarded to the most
productive team at the Big Game
rally.
