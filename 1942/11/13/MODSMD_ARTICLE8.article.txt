# Freshmen Hear Stamm Explain Peace Pact
## War Restrictions Cut Out Spirited Berkeley Excursions 
### 
ASSU President Ed Sin mm ex
plained the Peace Pact (.see below)
with Cal to several hundred frosh
in the Encina lobby last night, ask
ing them "to save their Big Game
exuberance for 2 p.m. next Satur
day."
"The restrictions of war —with the
tire situation and all—make it all
the more urgent to cut out those
spirited 'excursions' to Berkeley,"
reminded Stamm.
The Peace Pact, was signed by
President Stamm, on behalf of the
Stanford students, and the Cal pres
ident. It is a mutual agreement by
both campuses to suspend any pie
game hostilities, and let the ball
teams battle it out on the field.
PUNISHMENT SURE
Stamm added that punishment
! will be "mighty stiff" on any student
who violates the Pact. With many
students enlisted in deferment pro
grams, any conflict with the law will
jeopardize their deferment status,
warned Stamm.
"The Big Game Parade will give
the campus a chance to utilize their
spirit to a more constructive and
patriotic end," Stamm said.
STUNTS HELP
Jim Mcßrier, Rally Com chairman,
further emphasized this point by
saying that card stunts, arranged for
1.300 rooters, will divert excess en
thusiasm from destructive purposes.
The parade was outlined by Louis
Sloss, Rally Com, who suggested that
living groups, * planning to enter
floats, obtain their wagons soon, as
trucks are banned due to the tire
shortage.
