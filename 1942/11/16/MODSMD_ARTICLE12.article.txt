# 'So 8 Out of 60 Showed'

### 
"So 8 out of (50 showed to top
beets this afternoon," It was Rose
mary Cross, chairman of the Stan
ford War Board, commenting on the
fact that there is now a large field of
sugar beels which must yet be
topped just south of Stanford.
It seems that 40 young men from
Encina pledged that they would
work in the beet field yesterday
afternoon. It seems that 10 young
men from the Theta Xi house
pledged that they would work in
beet field yesterday afternoon. It
seems that. 10 young men from the
A.T.O. house pledged that they
would work in the beet field.
OS the owner of the field, Mr. Carl
Jenecke, went out into his field yes
terday morning and loosened the
beets so that they would be easier
to get out of the ground and to top.
And Mrs. Jenecke made between
150 and 200 sandwiches for her
Stanford beet toppers.
But only 6 young men from Encina
and 2 young men from the Theta Xi
house showed up yesterday after
noon. The loosened beets, according
to Mr. Jenecke, will rot in three or
four days.
Miss Cross, in commenting on the
istuation, said she believed it is "up
to Stanford to save the beets"
