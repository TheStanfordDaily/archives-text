LONDON, Nov. 15 (UP). — U.S.
and British forces have moved into
lunisia and with the Americans in
the vanguard have already clashed
with the Axis in the vicinity of the
great Bizerte naval base, 70 miles
east of the Algerian border, African
front reports said tonight.
The fighting at Bizerte, which
loomed as the first major action
pitting Americans against Germans
in this war, was reported by the
reliable Morocco radio at Rabat,
which said Axis reinforcements
were pouring into Tunis—Germans
by air and Italians by sea.
The same source said the Tunis
airdrome had been "attacked with
success despite attacks by the Axis
air force," without specifying the
nature of the attack on the Tunisian
capital.

in an Algiers dispatch, quoted Lieut.
Gen. Kenneth A. N. Anderson, com
mander of the British First Army,

at German Marshal Erwin Rommel
as soon as possible "and help put
him in the bag." The dispatch said
the army moving into Tunisia was
composed of !)0 per cent British
troops and 10 per cent American.
