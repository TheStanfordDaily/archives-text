# Indians Sink Beavers As Cal Scout Watches
## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz served the strongest T Saturday ever
brewed in Stanford Stadium since the advent of Frankie Albert and the
Clark Shaughnessy eleven that beat everything on the coast and went
to the Rose Bowl two years ago.
And from upstairs where the sports reporters watch the ball game

there sat a nasty man with blue and
gold feathers in his hat and blue
and gold blood in his veins—run
ning cold and slowly as the Indians
erupted violently and smeared Ore
gon State, 49-13.
What that California scout took
back to his boss, Leonard B. "Stub"
Allison, was a distorted picture of
an amazing passing and running of
fense, combined with an aerial de
fense just its antithesis — Oregon
State completed 20 out of 34 aerial
attempts!
IS FIRST DOWNS
Maybe those passes, of the "hook"
variety, didn't gain the Beavers any
touchdowns, but they helped pile
up 18 first downs to the Redskins'
17. Eleven of the Beavers' 18 first
downs came as a direct result of
passing, according to the official
game statistics.
Schwartz said afterward his boys
had been instructed to watch for a
long toss to O.S.C. ends. That par
ticular play, which called for a pro
digious heave deep into the ter
tiary, was the one that beat Stan
ford last year at Corvallis.
The rapid - fire series of short
passes over the middle wasn't ex
pected, and even at that they were
not sufficient ground gainers to
worry the Indian coaching staff.
That is precisely why so many of
them were completed: Stanford was
defending against a play that could
have materialized into a touch
down, and not against a play that
rewarded only short pecks of yard
age.
STUBBER'S THOUGHT?
So much for pass defense. What
the Bear scout tells the "Stufcber,"
and what the "Stubber" does about
it, is something else again.
Though the game was in the ice
box after the first half, the confer
ence ruling limiting home teams to
using only 28 players kept a bunch
of reserves out of the game. Their
absence kept the score mounting
higher and higher, but there was
something else that kept the Red
men hell bent to lambaste Oregon
State for all the Beavers could bear.
Perhaps it was the cold weather
again. A better guess was the spe
cial revival showing of "Oregon
State 10, Stanford 0," filmed at
Beaver town last season. The show
was for players only, and appar
ently there was enough in the pic
tures to make the Cards mentally
"high" for the game. And they
rode, high and mighty.
ATTACKS BLEND
They were all over the Beavers.
There never was a time in Stan
ford Stadium when a home team
looked so good and an opponent so
bad. Not to take away from the
efficiency of the Schwartzmen's
blocking, passing, and running, but
all three blended so well that many
an Oregon State man never knew
where the ball was until a Redskin
had either helped himself to a
chunk of yardage or had crossed
the goal line with another T.D.
Next week CALIFORNIA!
