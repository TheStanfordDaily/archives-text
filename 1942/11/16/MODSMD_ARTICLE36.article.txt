### BOB SONTAG 
{ JN TO THE 1943 810 GAME:
"Stanford by 1" goes out the window from now on. We don't need
any luck charms to win next Saturday's Big Game. When our peerless
pick comes out for the weekend it'll be for blood, nothing else.
* * * *
y\VV SHOULD WIN lIATS. ETC.:
Before seeing who wins the Hatlo hat, the Wiley Smith traveling
bag, et cetera, the dept. sends out a mythical Kmetovic shoe to Don Zappet
tini—who looked mre like the speedy Kmetovic while racing around at
left half last Saturday than any other half Stanford has had since Pete
joined the Navy. That one-time Zapp shot between two Beavers while
spurting down the far sidelines, it appeared that only two quick movements
faked the two OSC boys right off their feet. Zapp really swung a mean
hip.
Send out another pork pie topper to quarterback Ray Hammett, who left
many of the 10.000 fans in attendance, plus enough OSC players, looking
for the ball while an Indian scored. The way Ray faked the ball, as if to

pass with one hand while giving the leather to a Redskin back coming in
the opposite direction vvith the other, was a superior point in the Stanford
ground game. ,
Incidentally, the same play that was so obvious to some and so well
masked to others, went three times for T.D.'s.
Dave Brown, the sophomore end, had another hangup day, taking a
Hammett pass for a touchdown and once slithering across the turf to pull
down a Beaver back for a big loss.
The sum total of Stanford's adeptness at everything that makes a foot
ball team look like championship material was there—in every player on
the field. To name the outstanding ones would be to list every single man
that got by the official scorer's pencil up in the press coop.
There was a cooperative movement out oh tne field Saturday, and that
gave Stanford a well-earned revenge for last year.
* * * *
TROJANS NOW:
With Washington State held to a mere touchdown by Idaho and Wash
ington holding St. Mary's Pre-Flight to a scoreless tie—Southern California
looms as the Rose Bowler as the turbulent and upsettish 1943 season draws
near its finis.
The Huskies can beat Washington State, Southern California can take
UCLA—and thereby land themselves right smack in Pasadenaland. Right
now Troy has a defeat and a loss against it, while Washington has only one
defeat against itself—that to Southern California.
In holding the Pre-Flighters to a tie, Washington showed it could easily
dispose of Washington State.
This hectic season will be decided when the Huskies either do or don't.

\V ISF UP, ROLLERS:
Why don't those who "roll" persons at a football game think. You'd
think the average Stanford man had more brains than to take a chance of
seriously injuring a fellow student.
Remember, it's that very fooling around, needless fooling around, that
brought a fatal injury to a Stanford man last year.
Stop and think!
