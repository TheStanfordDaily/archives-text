# Soccer Team Shows Power In 3-0 Victory
## 
### BOB FISHER 
Stanford's varsity soccer team
showed that it is ready for the big
Cal game next week by trouncing a
strong San Mateo team last Saturday
morning on Maloney field 3-0 in
their best showing of the season.
Jim Boswell, playing his first game
as starting halfback played an out
standing game both at defense and in
setting up scoring opportunities. His
alert stops considerably strengthened
the already strong Stanford defense.
Playing with both legs slightly in
jured, Louis Chang scored two of
the three goals. He started at cen
ter forward and later shifted to in
side right to make room for Dave !
Williams. These two teamed with |
Gertridge, Trent, Bills, and Crary I
was the best offensive combination |
that Stanford has put together all j
season. Keith Pinion in scoring his
first shutout played an excellent
game in the goalie's net.
HARD FIGHT
San Mateo's ex-football players
put up a hard fight, but Stanford's !
experience and greater ball control
was too much for them. The game
; was one of the cleanest contests this ■
! year, and the San Mateo men proved
themselves to be great sportsmen in :
I defeat.
Bud Crary set up the first goal on ,
| an exceptional center shot from his i
j right wing position. The San Mateo ;
! goalie was able to stop the ball, but
was unable to hang onto it. It
bounced a few feet away from him
and Louie Chang drove it home on a I
short jab shot.
SECOND TALLY
Stanford's second tally came in the !
i second period on a solid kick from
about 30 feet out by Tommy Trent. I
Chang scored the final goal after the
[ intermission on a fast breaking play.
Coach Maloney used substitutes
during most of the final quarter.
Wednesday afternoon at 4 the
| Stanford frosh will have a return ■
game with Menlo JG. The last game '<
resulted in a 4-2 victory for Menlo, !
but the frosh are determined to even |
the score this time. Both varsity and ;
I frosh lace California Saturday at '
I Berkeley in the highlight games of !
the year.
