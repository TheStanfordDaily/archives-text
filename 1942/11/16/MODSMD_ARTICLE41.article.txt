to Hadley Bacon and Dick Narver combined to beat the Indians in a tight

game. Norris scored two points and
Bob Griffin one for the winners,
while Eob Jones made both of the
Indian goals.
Jones and goalie Pete Lee were
outstanding for Stanford. Jones was
the only man able to hit his shots,
while Lee played an excellent game
at goalie. Jones also looked good on
defense.
Big Bob put the Cards out in front
in the lirst quarter with a backhand
hook shot, the outstanding shot of the
game. But Norris and Griffin came
back in the third period to score
three quick goals. Jones scored again
with a shot from a free throw in the
final quarter, but it was a lost cause.
"We kept possession of the ball
most of the time," commented Coach
Ernie Brandsten, "but our goal shots
were either too slow or just off the
cage. We made just 2 goals in 19
attempts."
Morketter at sprint was able to
take the ball consistently from Em
melt Cashin and Bill Mapel, who
alternated at this position. Morket
