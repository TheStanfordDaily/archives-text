### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 15 (U.P)
Halfback Jesse Freitas engineered
two sparkling last-quarter touch
down drives today to give Santa
Clara a 20 to 7 victory over St.
Mary's before 40,000 fans at Kezar
Stadium.
I The two clubs—battling for the
supremacy of the West Coast Inde
pendents and at least a share in the
title of the top team in the Far West
—played on fairly even terms in the
scoreless first period.
Freitas and Johnny Podesto from
Modesto, the Gaels' top man in the
1 aerial department, engaged in a
i pitching duel with neither team
j getting within scoring distance.
In the second period, however,
each team ran up a touchdown and
converted in the space of little more
than two minutes.
The Broncos scored first. Full-
I back Bill Prentice cut w ide around
end. reversed his field and aided by
beautiful downfieid blocking raced
85 yards for a touchdown. Center A1
Santucci converted.
Santa Clara then kicked off to the
| Gaels who returned to their own 32.
I On the first play from scrimmage,
halfback Jack Verutti swept end and
sallied 68 yards into the Santa Clara
end zone. Podesto converted.
St. Mary's playing its first year
under Jimmy Phelan, twice drove to
Santa Clara's five«-yard line in the
third period but lacked the punch
to score in the face of hard line play
by the Broncos. Podesto dominated
the period with long passes to Ve
rutti and end Tom Coll which
thrust the Gaels deep into enemy
territory.
Freitas personally took over the
game midway through the final

quarter. Pitching passes to Verutti
and Alyn Beals, Santa Clara's all -
American end candidate, he moved
the Broncos from their own 31 to
the St. Mary's 17.
Then he flipped a pass to half
back Max Sailor in the end zone to
give the Broncos a lead. Santucei's
kick was wide.
But the Bronco sta> - wasn't satis
fied. A few plays later, when Santa
Clara took over on the midfield
stripe, Freitas ran and passed the
hall to the four-yard line and
plunged it across the goal. Then he
held the hall while Santucci kicked
goal.
Coach Buck Shaw's team, which
lost only to UG.L.A. this season,
ran up a total of 322 yards rushing
and passing and made 13 first downs.
The Gaels, meanwhile, gained 241
yards and five first downs.

down drives today to give Santa
Clara a 20 to 7 victory over St.
Mary's before 40,000 fans at Kezar
Stadium.
I The two clubs—battling for the
supremacy of the West Coast Inde
pendents and at least a share in the
title of the top team in the Far West
—played on fairly even terms in the
scoreless first period.
Freitas and Johnny Podesto from
Modesto, the Gaels' top man in the
1 aerial department, engaged in a
i pitching duel with neither team
j getting within scoring distance.
In the second period, however,
each team ran up a touchdown and
converted in the space of little more
than two minutes.
The Broncos scored first. Full-
I back Bill Prentice cut w ide around
end. reversed his field and aided by
beautiful downfieid blocking raced
85 yards for a touchdown. Center A1
Santucci converted.
Santa Clara then kicked off to the
| Gaels who returned to their own 32.
I On the first play from scrimmage,
halfback Jack Verutti swept end and
sallied 68 yards into the Santa Clara
end zone. Podesto converted.
St. Mary's playing its first year
under Jimmy Phelan, twice drove to
Santa Clara's five«-yard line in the
third period but lacked the punch
to score in the face of hard line play
by the Broncos. Podesto dominated
the period with long passes to Ve
rutti and end Tom Coll which
thrust the Gaels deep into enemy
territory.
Freitas personally took over the
game midway through the final

quarter. Pitching passes to Verutti
and Alyn Beals, Santa Clara's all -
American end candidate, he moved
the Broncos from their own 31 to
the St. Mary's 17.
Then he flipped a pass to half
back Max Sailor in the end zone to
give the Broncos a lead. Santucei's
kick was wide.
But the Bronco sta> - wasn't satis
fied. A few plays later, when Santa
Clara took over on the midfield
stripe, Freitas ran and passed the
hall to the four-yard line and
plunged it across the goal. Then he
held the hall while Santucci kicked
goal.
Coach Buck Shaw's team, which
lost only to UG.L.A. this season,
ran up a total of 322 yards rushing
and passing and made 13 first downs.
The Gaels, meanwhile, gained 241
yards and five first downs.
