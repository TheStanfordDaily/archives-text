# A 						Contest with Cal
## 
### 
THIS Saturday Stanford will not only meet
California in football, but also in crew. For
the first time since 1921 Stanford will row
against California as an egual and not as a prac
tice jaunt for the v/orld champions.
The fact that we are now qualified to row
against Cal represents a great deal of time and
effort on the part of a few men. Three years
ago crew was started on Lake Lagunita. The
crew then moved to Redwood City and built a
practice barge.
Now the crew has moved to the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor, has three shells which are gifts
of California and the University of Washington,
a practice scow, a boat house with showers, and
probably the most important, the best natural
rowing course on the Pacific Coast.
The Stanford Boat Club, which is the crew,
has acquired all this property itself. The mem
bers have built the scow, which represents at
least $250, and this year they have added the
boat house which they built themselves. These
have been paid for by collecting dues from the
members, anyone interested in rowing, and
by the generous gifts of alumni.
This year crew has been re-established as
a gym course with University credit. Three
hours a week are required to meet the gym
requirements. The members of the crew prac
tice seven days a week and put in at least 16
to 18 hours a week. It is a tough body-building
sport, low on injuries, and certainly has a place
in the physical fitness program of the Univer
sity.
In all the universites where there is rowing
it is a major sport. If a major sport is judged on
the time, the effort, the strenuousness and
the good derived from it, crew qualifies high.
But the members of the Stanford Boat Club
who have re-established crew here at Stanford
and who will row against California on Sat
urday don't want a Block S. They are too new
and want to establish themselves first.
Next Saturday when they are stoking the mile
and a half course, they won't be rowing for the
Stanford Boat Club, but for the name of Stan
ford University, and a Circle Sis a small enough
reward to give them.—Al Hampson

Next Saturday when they are stoking the mile
and a half course, they won't be rowing for the
Stanford Boat Club, but for the name of Stan
ford University, and a Circle Sis a small enough
reward to give them.—Al Hampson
THIS Saturday Stanford will not only meet
California in football, but also in crew. For
the first time since 1921 Stanford will row
against California as an egual and not as a prac
tice jaunt for the v/orld champions.
The fact that we are now qualified to row
against Cal represents a great deal of time and
effort on the part of a few men. Three years
ago crew was started on Lake Lagunita. The
crew then moved to Redwood City and built a
practice barge.
Now the crew has moved to the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor, has three shells which are gifts
of California and the University of Washington,
a practice scow, a boat house with showers, and
probably the most important, the best natural
rowing course on the Pacific Coast.
The Stanford Boat Club, which is the crew,
has acquired all this property itself. The mem
bers have built the scow, which represents at
least $250, and this year they have added the
boat house which they built themselves. These
have been paid for by collecting dues from the
members, anyone interested in rowing, and
by the generous gifts of alumni.
This year crew has been re-established as
a gym course with University credit. Three
hours a week are required to meet the gym
requirements. The members of the crew prac
tice seven days a week and put in at least 16
to 18 hours a week. It is a tough body-building
sport, low on injuries, and certainly has a place
in the physical fitness program of the Univer
sity.
In all the universites where there is rowing
it is a major sport. If a major sport is judged on
the time, the effort, the strenuousness and
the good derived from it, crew qualifies high.
But the members of the Stanford Boat Club
who have re-established crew here at Stanford
and who will row against California on Sat
urday don't want a Block S. They are too new
and want to establish themselves first.
