# Roll Him Correctly
## 
### 
TUST like taking off "that blue hat" and other
J pieces of blue wearing apparel, rolling some
soul has always been part of sitting in the
rooting section.
At Saturday's football game there were a
number of rollings, and each one got more out
of hand. On the last one the poor boy was not
handed from tier to tier; he was thrown. It was
only because luck happened to be with the
rollee that he was not seriously injured when
he came down out of the substratosphere and
landed on the seats.
As long as we have football and organized
rooting sections we will have rollings, but if
you can't control the urge to push someone who
is walking in front of you and shout "roll him,"
at least see that he is carefully rolled and not
thrown.â€”Al Hampson
