# Farm to Have Card Stunts
## 
### 
Stanford rooters will have card I
stunts for the Big Game next Satur- j
day afternoon in Berkeley.
Some 1,300 cards in six colors have
been borrowed from the University
of California for use by the Indian
rooting section in the game, Martha
Thurmond and Jim Mc√ürier, Rally
Committee co-chairmen, announced
yesterday.
Beacuse of shift to war production
no more cards for stunts are manu
factured. Stanford was unable to
buy any more this year and its ex
isting stock of cards was far too
small to be of any practical use.
But California's Rally Committee,
under the direction of Margaret Mc-
Mullin and Bob Dreher, dipped into j
its reserve supply, cut down on the j
size of its own card section, and of
fered the 1,300 cards for Stanford's
own use.
"Because, we can't buy cards any
more, we've promised to return them
after the game. We hope everyone
will cooperate with us in allowing
Stanford to keep its word," she
added.
White shirts and rooters' caps for
the boys and pompoms for the girls
will be required for admittance to
the rooting section Saturday as
usual.
