# A 						Stone in the Wall of Progress
## 
### 
THIS year's Peace Pact with California, which
rules out inter-campus raids, has more sig
nificance than those of past years. When the
presidents of the student bodies of the two uni
versities signed the pact, they piled another
stone on the wall of progress and tradition.
This year we cannot afford to break the
Peace Pact. Colleges can no longer be thought
of as "country clubs" in which to spend a
period of extended youth. They must bear the
name of what they are—places where serious
work must be done if they are to continue as
we have known them in the past and not gov
ernment-operated schools for journeymen or
barracks for soldiers.
Each year we move farther away from the
days of hazing, freshman-sophomore feuds, and
now from raiding Cal there is less temptation,
or social pressure in the form of "The sopho
mores did, why can't we?"
It might be well for those who are toying with
the idea of wasting their time and tires, and
of bringing Stanford's name into an unfavorable
light by raiding Cal to paint the C—it might
be well for them to stop and consider and to
re-read the Peace Pact which Howard Holmes of
California and Ed Stamm of California signed.—
