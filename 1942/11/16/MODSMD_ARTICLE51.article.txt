Now I think there are a lot of good things at
Stanford which we students pass up. And one
of these little things came to my attention the
other day.
It seems that the very fine San Francisco
Symphony begins its season very shortly. Now
it also seems that Bay Area students have a
chance to purchase season tickets for the per
formances of the symphony at very reduced
rates. The cost, I believe, is $9.90 per ticket,
which is pretty reasonable considering the
facts that the seats are in the Grand Tier and
that the music of the San Francisco Symphony
is probably the best to be heard west of Chi
cago.
While I'm on this turn it might be a good idea
also to mention the fact that our Big Game
victory (?) is going to be celebrated in the
Women's Gym Big Game night this year. Judg
ing from the success of the Lagunita-Union for
mal of a little over a week ago this is just the
type of dance Stanford wants and needs. At
least that was the thought of Ted Eberle's Big
Game Dance Committee in planning to hold the
traditional Big Game Dance, the Red and White
Ball, in the Women's Gym.
This, however, is one good deal that I don't
think Stanford is going to pass up. The com
parative cheapness of dance ducats (compared
to Del Monte or a bust in the city), the saving
in tires, gas and oil, the fact that women's late
leaves extend to only 2:30 this year, and the
intrinsic excellence of Garry Nottingham's band
and the setup at the Women's Gym all seem to
point to a large and glorious success for the Red
and White Ball.
