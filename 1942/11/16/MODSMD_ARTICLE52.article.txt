The Editor, Sir:
It was with an appalled amusement that we
read the letter of "War-Scientist" in last Friday's
Stanford Daily. There is no brief for unpatriot
ism in our time. But neither is there a substan
tial case for the adolescent hysteria displayed
in that breast-beating letter. On the contrary,
it would seem that the dignity of patriotism
should be loaned only to the genuine and good
causes. The sacrifices of our troops in this war
are noble and heroic.
There are at least four reasons which prompt
ed the granting of the Christmas vacation:
1). There was no over-all academic plan
which indicated that the elimination of vacation
would insure an earlier graduation.
2). Vacation war work will aid not only Stan
ford's working students, but also the war plants
in this region.
3). The transportation of students is a railroad
problem; it is assumed that the railroads will
grant reservations on a strict preferential basis.
4). There is an efficiency value in the varia
tion from routine involved in a short vacation.
These arguments are mentioned with no in
tent of flogging the dead horse of the vacation
issue. However, they indicate that the deciding
committee acted with good sense; apparently
Mr. War-Scientist was in no manner interested
in the arguments, but only in the poetry of the
issue.
The thing at stake is not the Christmas vaca
tion. It is the critical danger of allowing our
interest in the war effort to become synonymous
with irrational thinking and hyper-dramatic ed
itorialism.â€”R. H. Colvin.
The Editor, Sir:
The "War-Scientist" scatches the Stanford
Student Body!
The Stanford student body cringes under the
reality set forth by the "War-Scientist"; the stu
dent representatives blush because they "wilt
ed in the face of whole-hearted opposition to
their noble plan." No doubt about it, especially
when one member, at least, is ashamed of them
all, of being a member of the "Family." Perhaps
he has cause to be ashamed; perhaps the three
weeks leave from studying will mean the dif
ference between life and death at some future
time, who knows?
But what I'm wondering is, why is the "War-
Scientist" here? Is he an engineer? An ac
countant? A reservist? Unnecessary crowd,
these! We don't need any bridges built, and
university-trained commanders for the Marines
at Guadalcanal, for the doughboys at the gates
of Tunis, or any regulators of post-war eco
nomics. All that we need is our valiant fighters,
and we'll win the war, sure. For what? We
don't need a vacation from Stanford so that we
can spend perhaps our last holiday with the
family. Neither do the boys at Ord, at Fort
Lewis, or at Fort Lee. They are being trained
as the fighters, companions, and successors to
the boys mentioned above. They are doing
their work in their field; we are, I hope, doing
ours here. And yet their commanders believe
that leave for the Christmas holiday is a neces
sary and good thing for the morale of the fight
ers. Might it not be a good thing for those in
other fields. No! says our scientist! Well!
A catastrophe has struck: Stanford has a va
cation! Praise the Lord and pass me a gun.
A Layman.
