# Betty Grable Best Reason To See Film
## 
### 
SPRINGTIME IN THE ROCKIES,
now playing at the Stanford Thea
ter.
(1). There is a class of people, a
large class, in fact—called "males"
—who like to look at Betty Gable.
This picture will gratify them. Her
contours photogi'aph very well in
technicolor.
(2). And this will be about as close
as most Stanfordites are going to get
to a name band for the duration.
Harry James turns out his full col
lection of juke-box favorites, and
there are some excellent shots of the
band.
GRABLE CAN'T ACT
Of course Grable can't act. No one
expects her to. She does enough as
it is. And John Paine has to try too
hard to be handsome to have any
energy left over for acting.
The real star is Edward Everett
Horton, who portrays the best in
ebriated intellectual since that wire
haired lad in "Johnny Eager."
Charlotte Greenwood is still
screamingly funny with her gro
tesque dancing; and her long legs
have increased utility now that
Grable uses them for match-lighters.
IMIRANDA NOISY
Noisy, gaudy Carmen Miranda is
in this one too, giving her version of
a Spanish Chattanooga Choo-choo.
Then there's the really beautiful
redhead who pops into the agents',
says, "Good morning Mr. 8., good
morning Mr. B."—diff Mr. B.—and
then disappears for the duration.
Don't doze off till you've seen this
bit.
The second feature is as good as
the first, in a different sort of way.
Edgar Allen Poe was quite a man.
—Dillineer.
