# Palo Alto Motor Corps Needs Station-Wagons
## 
### 
The Palo Aiio Chapter of the Red
Cross Motor Corps is in urgent need
of two used station-wagons in good
condition. The corps is eager to pur
chase and equip them for Red Cross
service. Red Cross has sufficient
priorities to keep the station-wagons
in good running order and anyone
interested in disposing of a station
wagon before gas-rationing is urged
to call Red Cross headquarters; Palo
Alto 22144, as soon as possible.
