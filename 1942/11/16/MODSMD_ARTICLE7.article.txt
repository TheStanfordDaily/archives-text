A Physical Therapy meeting, ;
sponsored by Women's Vocom, will j
be held in Roble Clubroom tomor
row at 7:30 p.m. Pan Hellenic Coun
cil has granted permission for so
rority women to go to Roble on that
night. Women's Vocom urges all
women students to attend.
The five speakers for the meeting
will be: Jane Minor and Marian
Manners, former Stanford students
who are working in the field of
Physical Therapy in San Francisco;
Hazel Dehy of Fort Old; Miss Lu
cille Daniels, assistant professor of
Physical Therapy at Stanford; Miss
Catherine Worthingham, director of
physical therapy at Stanford.
Students may enter the field of
Physical Therapy as late as their j
junior or senior year. Freshmen and
sophomores, who have not decided j
on their major, would probably find J
Physical Therapy well worth inves- j
tigating, according to Miss Anastasia |
Doyle, Vocom chairman.
