"You can't tell
the players without
a scorecard"
The cry goes out to the millions in the nation's grand
stands. Actually it is echoing a simple but fundamental
principle of modern advertising.
Advertising is the scorecard for intelligent shoppers.
It does more than identify a product, however. It tells
where this product is available, and at what price. About
thousands of products, thousands of necessities and con
veniences, it gives accurate information instantly-infor
mation that one individual could not secure, even after
the most painstaking and wearying search.
You can t tell the values without reading the adver
tisements in this newspaper!
