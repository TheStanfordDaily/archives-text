# Beet Topping Bet Awarded to ATO
## 
### 
The winner of the beet topping
contest between the ATO's, Phi Psi's,
and SAE's has finally been decided
by Mr. Jenecke, beet-ranch owner,
and his verdict is in favor of the
ATO's.
Owing to a misunderstanding of
how the contest was to be judged,
there was a tic between the Phi Psi's
and ATO's. Since neither fraternity
wanted to split the money, it was de
cided to let Mr. Jenecke award first
place after reading the arguments of
both houses. After his idea of hav
ing a playoff was vetoed, he gave
the ATO's the money.
There is still a large field of the
beets to be picked, and their sugar
content is decreasing with each rain
fall. If more help is not provided
soon, the rest of the field will have
to be abandoned.
According to the heads of the War
Board, most of the help has come
from the men's living groups, but
Encina Hall still needs a better rep
resentation on the fields. Crews will
be leaving today, Friday, and Sun
day, and Encinamen are particu
larly wanted.
