# GREATEST NAVY VICTORY
## U.S. Fleet Sinks 23 Jap Ships in Enemy Attempt To Recapture Solomons 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 16 (UP)- —The United States Navy fought and won
the mightiest sea battle sinee Jutland last week-end—a smashing triumph that
wiped out 23 Jap ships, including a battleship and five cruisers, and frustrated
the most ambitious enemy attempt so far to recapture lost positions in the Solo
mon Islands. Japanese casualties were estimated unofficially at between 25,000
and .'50,000 men.
The historic victory was reported tonight by the Navy Department, which

said another Jap battleship and six destroyers also were
damaged in a three-day slugfest that cost the United States
two light cruisers, six destroyers sunk and an undetermined
number of men.
The man of the hour in the thunderous triumph was Vice-
Admiral William F. Halsey, Jr., hard-hitting American com
mander whose brilliant direction of the battle may rank him
among the nation's greatest naval heroes.
All told, 11 Jap men-o'-war (one battleship, five cruisers
and five destroyers) and 12 auxiliaries (eight troop trans
ports and four cargo transports) were wiped out.
Guadalcanal Struggle ISot lie inn tod
This damage was done in action of Friday, Nov. 13, and
tonight's communique said that details of further naval fight
ing in the great struggle for Guadalcanal Island in the Solo
mons on the night of Nov. 14-15 have not yet been received.
The fierce fighting began Friday morning, shortly after
midnight Thursday, and by Sunday morning the surviving
ships of the Japanese armada were reported retreating to
their bases to the north.
No mention was made in the communique of use of air
craft carriers by either side. Both the U.S. and Japanese
navies have lost heavily in this category in other battles.
All Enemy Forces Driven Hack
In a supplementary communique issued at Pearl Harbor
tonight, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, commander-in-chief of
the Pacific Fleet, said that the transport force was so riddled
that "little, if any, assistance reached Japanese land forces
on Guadalcanal." He added that "Major Gen. A. A. Vander
grift, U.S.M.C., with his Army, Navy and Marine forces con
tinues to have the situation (on the island) well in hand."
Nimitz said that the great naval struggle ended with all
enemy forces either "destroyed or driven back, and a major
victory was obtained by our gallant forces."
lI,S. Now Holds Balance of Power
The victory would seem to indicate that the United Stales
now holds the balance of power, or at least parity, in the
Southwest Pacific.
The back of the Jap assault probably was broken when
American warships, employing a ruse used effectively in the
Battle of Macassar Straits, rushed between two Jap columns
and fired broadsides into both groups. The surprised Japs
became so confused they fired at each other.
From a numerical standpoint the smashing triumph was
far greater than that achieved at Midway last June when
American air and naval forces combined to batter an 80-ship
Jap invasion armada into defeat.
Enemy I essels iSow Sunk
Destruction of 23 Jap ships and damage to seven others
raised to 502 the number of enemy vessels sunk, probably
sunk, or damaged by American forces alone since Pearl Har
bor. The Solomons campaign has cost the Japanese 35 ships
sunk, four probably sunk and 72 damaged—for a total of 111.
American losses in the Solomons thus far total 24 ships
sunk, including three heavy cruisers and two aircraft car
riers, and at least four ships damaged.
