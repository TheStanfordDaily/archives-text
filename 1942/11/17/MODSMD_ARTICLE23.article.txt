# Food Conservation Drive Disappoints
## 
### 
Not much immediate improve
ment in the Stanford War Board
campaign to educate diners in food
conservations was evident in the
first Clean Your Plate day Thurs
day, Miss Christine Ricker, director
of Union dining halls, said, but held
I hope that students would become
more conscious of shortages, espe
cially in dairy products.
Speakers in all campus eating
groups yesterday urged cooperation
in taking only what one could eat
and not wasting milk or butter.
Miss Ricker asked also that Cellar
patrons clear their tables when they
finish eating and leave the dishes in
the trays in the center of the Cellar.
