# Dr. Menke Doing Cancer Research

Further investigations in produc
ing cancers in mice by injecting a
fatty substance dissolved from hu
man breast cancers were reported
from incomplete research by Dr.
John F. Menke of the School of
Medicine in the current issue of
Cancer Research.
Dr. Menke' reported he had pro
duced cancer in mice only when he
injected them with cancerous tissue
or extract from a human bone can
cer. No cancers occurred in tests
with fat from non-cancerous tissues.
Stanford medical scientists pur
sued the research hoping to discover
that the human cancerous tissue con
tained a chemical substance similar
to substances in coal tar that have
been found by other investigators to
produce cancer.
Results of the investigation sug
gested. however, that the tissue was
not related to the tar substances,
and that there is a more unstable
type of chemical substance active,
which can be destroyed by heating
to a moderately high temperature.
Out -of - state consumption
throughout the rest of the United
States of California wines rose dur
ing the first four months of 1942 by
21 per cent as compared with the
same period in 1941.
