### 
SAN FRANCISCO, Nov. 16 (UP).
â€”Married women with children
should seek only part-time em
ployment in war industries because
too many other persons must be
hired to take over their normal
household duties if they work full
time, Lady Kathleen Simon, active
in day nursery work in England,
said tonight.
