# Varsity Gridders Warned Against Over-Confidence; Sanderman Back on Team
## 
### CHARLES ALLEN 
Stanford's varsity gridders broke precedent to work out yesterday as
Coach Marchie Schwartz warned the team against ovcr-confidencc for the
coming Big Game with California next Saturday at the Berkeley Stadium.
Usually, most of the first-string players arc excused from Monday prac
tices, hut yesterday they were alf working out in uniform as three teams
ran through signal dr ills for an hour. +

The squad was in good shape after
the Oregon State game. Big Buck
Fawcett, the Indians' speedy full
back, ran through plays easily al
though he favored his leg, which was
re-injured in the Oregon State game.
However, Schwartz said, he expected
Fawcett to be in top form by Satur
day.
SIIIPKEY, FIUSBEE OKEH
Stanford's two other fullbacks who
were injured in the Oregon State
game, Art Shipkey and Bob Frisbee,
were declared to be in shape. Fris
bee showed no traces of the pulled
muscle he suffered Saturday, and
Shipkey was declared recovered
from a leg injury.
Neither Shipkey nor Bill Sheller,
hard-hitting right halfback, were at
practice as both were out of town.
They will be in suits and working
out today, however.
The only other noticeable absentee
was big Loren La Prade, first string
right guard, who will definitely not
play in the Big Game. La Prade's
knee, which he wrenched in the
U.C.L.A. game three weeks ago,
hasn't responded to treatment and
the big guard is probably out for the
rest of the season.
SANDERMAN BACK
The Indians were bolstered by the
return of Fred Sanderman, speedy
halfback, who broke his shoulder in
the Notre Dame game at South
Bond. Sanderman, a first string left
halfback at the time of his injury,
was switched to right halfback and
working out yesterday in that spot.
Schwartz declared the sophomore
speedster would probably see action
against the Bears.
Despite poor weather conditions,
all three teams handled the ball well
during the signal drills. The first
team, sparked by center Milt Vuci
nieh's lively chatter, showed lots of
spirit and drive.
However, varsity coaches were
worried about the psychological
angle of the Big Game.
BEARS UNDER WRAPS
They feel that California is a lot
better than its 13-0 margin of vic
tory over Montana indicated, and re
peatedly pointed out that Stanford
over-confidence cost the Indians
last year's Big Game.
Last year, Stanford was a heavy
favorite to beat the Bears, who had
a spotty record, but the aggressive
California line tore the Indian attack
to shreds and scored an amazing
16-0 upset victory.
The coaches expressed the fear
something like that may happen
again this year. They pointed out
that the Bears always seem more
keyed up for the Bigrr(
the Indians. This psychological edge
more than offsets a slight advantage
in ability or a better record.
INDIANS NOT STALE
It is unlikely that the Indians will
be stale for this year's Big Game.
Schwartz has stuck rigidly to his
word nbout practice sessions begin
ning and ending on time, and there
is always plenty of zip left in the
squad.
But the over-confidence may well
be another story. Recent successes
over Washington and Oregon State
have lifted the Indians to the same
position they occupied before the
California shellacking last year.
It is probable that by game time
Stanford will be approximately a
2-1 favorite over California,, about
the same margin the "experts" gave
the Indians last year.
STUBBEER'S TEAM 'HIGH'
And. as last year, Coach Stub Alli
son of the Bears will depend on be
ing the underdog to gear his team
psychologically for the Big Game.
If the Bears are as "high" this
year as they were last year, the In
dians will have to play their best
game of the season to win.
The California strategy will prob
ably be built around outfighting the
Indians. Kecent Big Games show
that the Bears always seem to play
a more "rock-'em, sock-'em" type of
football than do the Indians, and
California supporters will depend on
the Bears playing harder football to
upset the intricacies of the Indian
"T" formation attack.
•IURKOVICH SPEARHEAD
The Bear line will attempt to out
drive Ihe Indian line, as it did so
effectively last year, to smash the
Stanford attack. And the Bears will
pin their offensive hopes on joltin'
Jim Jurkovich. a much greater all
around back than the Bears had last
ye»»r. A sprinter ;ind a good passer.
"Jurk s speed and accurate passing
to Johnny Ferguson, second in the
county in number of passes caught,
may puncture the weak Stanford
pass defense.
The Indians will workout today in
further preparation for the Big
Game and probably will begin
dummy scrimmage against Califor
nia plays tomorrow.

better than its 13-0 margin of vic
tory over Montana indicated, and re
peatedly pointed out that Stanford
over-confidence cost the Indians
last year's Big Game.
Last year, Stanford was a heavy
favorite to beat the Bears, who had
a spotty record, but the aggressive
California line tore the Indian attack
to shreds and scored an amazing
16-0 upset victory.
The coaches expressed the fear
something like that may happen
again this year. They pointed out
that the Bears always seem more
keyed up for the Bigrr(
the Indians. This psychological edge
more than offsets a slight advantage
in ability or a better record.
INDIANS NOT STALE
It is unlikely that the Indians will
be stale for this year's Big Game.
Schwartz has stuck rigidly to his
word nbout practice sessions begin
ning and ending on time, and there
is always plenty of zip left in the
squad.
But the over-confidence may well
be another story. Recent successes
over Washington and Oregon State
have lifted the Indians to the same
position they occupied before the
California shellacking last year.
It is probable that by game time
Stanford will be approximately a
2-1 favorite over California,, about
the same margin the "experts" gave
the Indians last year.
STUBBEER'S TEAM 'HIGH'
And. as last year, Coach Stub Alli
son of the Bears will depend on be
ing the underdog to gear his team
psychologically for the Big Game.
If the Bears are as "high" this
year as they were last year, the In
dians will have to play their best
game of the season to win.
The California strategy will prob
ably be built around outfighting the
Indians. Kecent Big Games show
that the Bears always seem to play
a more "rock-'em, sock-'em" type of
football than do the Indians, and
California supporters will depend on
the Bears playing harder football to
upset the intricacies of the Indian
"T" formation attack.
•IURKOVICH SPEARHEAD
The Bear line will attempt to out
drive Ihe Indian line, as it did so
effectively last year, to smash the
Stanford attack. And the Bears will
pin their offensive hopes on joltin'
Jim Jurkovich. a much greater all
around back than the Bears had last
ye»»r. A sprinter ;ind a good passer.
"Jurk s speed and accurate passing
to Johnny Ferguson, second in the
county in number of passes caught,
may puncture the weak Stanford
pass defense.
The Indians will workout today in
further preparation for the Big
Game and probably will begin
dummy scrimmage against Califor
nia plays tomorrow.
Stanford's varsity gridders broke precedent to work out yesterday as
Coach Marchie Schwartz warned the team against ovcr-confidencc for the
coming Big Game with California next Saturday at the Berkeley Stadium.
Usually, most of the first-string players arc excused from Monday prac
tices, hut yesterday they were alf working out in uniform as three teams
ran through signal dr ills for an hour. +

The squad was in good shape after
the Oregon State game. Big Buck
Fawcett, the Indians' speedy full
back, ran through plays easily al
though he favored his leg, which was
re-injured in the Oregon State game.
However, Schwartz said, he expected
Fawcett to be in top form by Satur
day.
SIIIPKEY, FIUSBEE OKEH
Stanford's two other fullbacks who
were injured in the Oregon State
game, Art Shipkey and Bob Frisbee,
were declared to be in shape. Fris
bee showed no traces of the pulled
muscle he suffered Saturday, and
Shipkey was declared recovered
from a leg injury.
Neither Shipkey nor Bill Sheller,
hard-hitting right halfback, were at
practice as both were out of town.
They will be in suits and working
out today, however.
The only other noticeable absentee
was big Loren La Prade, first string
right guard, who will definitely not
play in the Big Game. La Prade's
knee, which he wrenched in the
U.C.L.A. game three weeks ago,
hasn't responded to treatment and
the big guard is probably out for the
rest of the season.
SANDERMAN BACK
The Indians were bolstered by the
return of Fred Sanderman, speedy
halfback, who broke his shoulder in
the Notre Dame game at South
Bond. Sanderman, a first string left
halfback at the time of his injury,
was switched to right halfback and
working out yesterday in that spot.
Schwartz declared the sophomore
speedster would probably see action
against the Bears.
Despite poor weather conditions,
all three teams handled the ball well
during the signal drills. The first
team, sparked by center Milt Vuci
nieh's lively chatter, showed lots of
spirit and drive.
However, varsity coaches were
worried about the psychological
angle of the Big Game.

The Indians will workout today in

Game and probably will begin

Stanford's varsity gridders broke precedent to work out yesterday as
Coach Marchie Schwartz warned the team against ovcr-confidencc for the
coming Big Game with California next Saturday at the Berkeley Stadium.
Usually, most of the first-string players arc excused from Monday prac
tices, hut yesterday they were alf working out in uniform as three teams
ran through signal dr ills for an hour. +

The squad was in good shape after
the Oregon State game. Big Buck
Fawcett, the Indians' speedy full
back, ran through plays easily al
though he favored his leg, which was
re-injured in the Oregon State game.
However, Schwartz said, he expected
Fawcett to be in top form by Satur
day.
SIIIPKEY, FIUSBEE OKEH
Stanford's two other fullbacks who
were injured in the Oregon State
game, Art Shipkey and Bob Frisbee,
were declared to be in shape. Fris
bee showed no traces of the pulled
muscle he suffered Saturday, and
Shipkey was declared recovered
from a leg injury.
Neither Shipkey nor Bill Sheller,
hard-hitting right halfback, were at
practice as both were out of town.
They will be in suits and working
out today, however.
The only other noticeable absentee
was big Loren La Prade, first string
right guard, who will definitely not
play in the Big Game. La Prade's
knee, which he wrenched in the
U.C.L.A. game three weeks ago,
hasn't responded to treatment and
the big guard is probably out for the
rest of the season.
SANDERMAN BACK
The Indians were bolstered by the
return of Fred Sanderman, speedy
halfback, who broke his shoulder in
the Notre Dame game at South
Bond. Sanderman, a first string left
halfback at the time of his injury,
was switched to right halfback and
working out yesterday in that spot.
Schwartz declared the sophomore
speedster would probably see action
against the Bears.
Despite poor weather conditions,
all three teams handled the ball well
during the signal drills. The first
team, sparked by center Milt Vuci
nieh's lively chatter, showed lots of
spirit and drive.
However, varsity coaches were
worried about the psychological
angle of the Big Game.
BEARS UNDER WRAPS
They feel that California is a lot
better than its 13-0 margin of vic
tory over Montana indicated, and re
peatedly pointed out that Stanford
over-confidence cost the Indians
last year's Big Game.
Last year, Stanford was a heavy
favorite to beat the Bears, who had
a spotty record, but the aggressive
California line tore the Indian attack
to shreds and scored an amazing
16-0 upset victory.
The coaches expressed the fear
something like that may happen
again this year. They pointed out
that the Bears always seem more
keyed up for the Bigrr(
the Indians. This psychological edge
more than offsets a slight advantage
in ability or a better record.
INDIANS NOT STALE
It is unlikely that the Indians will
be stale for this year's Big Game.
Schwartz has stuck rigidly to his
word nbout practice sessions begin
ning and ending on time, and there
is always plenty of zip left in the
squad.
But the over-confidence may well
be another story. Recent successes
over Washington and Oregon State
have lifted the Indians to the same
position they occupied before the
California shellacking last year.
It is probable that by game time
Stanford will be approximately a
2-1 favorite over California,, about
the same margin the "experts" gave
the Indians last year.
STUBBEER'S TEAM 'HIGH'
And. as last year, Coach Stub Alli
son of the Bears will depend on be
ing the underdog to gear his team
psychologically for the Big Game.
If the Bears are as "high" this
year as they were last year, the In
dians will have to play their best
game of the season to win.
The California strategy will prob
ably be built around outfighting the
Indians. Kecent Big Games show
that the Bears always seem to play
a more "rock-'em, sock-'em" type of
football than do the Indians, and
California supporters will depend on
the Bears playing harder football to
upset the intricacies of the Indian
"T" formation attack.
•IURKOVICH SPEARHEAD
The Bear line will attempt to out
drive Ihe Indian line, as it did so
effectively last year, to smash the
Stanford attack. And the Bears will
pin their offensive hopes on joltin'
Jim Jurkovich. a much greater all
