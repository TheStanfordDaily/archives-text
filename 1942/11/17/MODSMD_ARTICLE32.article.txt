# Frosh Gridders Name Captains

### ZIP WALT 
Lloyd Merriman and Ed Gunder
son have been elected co-captains
of the Freshman football team, j
Coach Francis Wilcox announced, i
As is the custom, a backfield and !
lineman share the honorary posi- I
tions.
Merriman, formerly a star at Clo
vis High Schol, has been a sparkplug
at the speedy left half spot, and is
definitely labeled as a promising
candidate for the varsity eleven next J
season.
During the Cal Frosh game, in
which the yearlings upset the fav- j
ored Bear Cubs, 14-7, Merriman j
broke through center for 28 yards
and a score on the first play of the
game. Then, on the first scrimmage j
play in the second half, with the ball
on the Papoose 45, quarterback Jack
Brownson passed to Merriman on !
the Cal 25. He rambled over for !
the other touchdown.
CALLED BACK
In the fourth quarter, a touchdown
pass from Brownson to Merriman !
was nullified because the passer was
not five yards behind the line of
scrimmage.
Gunderson was all-city guard last j
year at Polytechnic High School in
San Francisco. The big 192 pounder
is also a good swimmer and track |
man.
He was a standout in a very strong I
line, and his number 52 was usually
seen crashing through the opposing [
line or leading a long gain running s
play.
GIFTS FOR COACHES
During the banquet after the game
the team presented coaches Wilcox
and Arnie Meiners with gifts.
This week the frosh will run Cali- j
fornia plays against the varsity, and ;
will probably engage them in a
scrimmage session. The yearlings
know the single-wing system well, i
for all the teams they played against,
save one, used that style.
Varsity Coach Mfirchie Schwartz
may name several of the frosh squad j
to practice with the varsity after the
Big Game, for the first year men are j
eligible for the St. Mary's Pre- !
Flight game on Nov. 28.
VARSITY PROSPECTS
There are several members of the
squad that may do well with the
varsity. However, if they don't even
get a chance to play, Schwartz can
get a look at some of the prospects
for next season.
Coach Wilcox will aid Schwartz
for the rest of the season.

broke through center for 28 yards
and a score on the first play of the
game. Then, on the first scrimmage j
play in the second half, with the ball
on the Papoose 45, quarterback Jack
Brownson passed to Merriman on !
the Cal 25. He rambled over for !
the other touchdown.
CALLED BACK
In the fourth quarter, a touchdown
pass from Brownson to Merriman !
was nullified because the passer was
not five yards behind the line of
scrimmage.
Gunderson was all-city guard last j
year at Polytechnic High School in
San Francisco. The big 192 pounder
is also a good swimmer and track |
man.
He was a standout in a very strong I
line, and his number 52 was usually
seen crashing through the opposing [
line or leading a long gain running s
play.
GIFTS FOR COACHES
During the banquet after the game
the team presented coaches Wilcox
and Arnie Meiners with gifts.
This week the frosh will run Cali- j
fornia plays against the varsity, and ;
will probably engage them in a
scrimmage session. The yearlings
know the single-wing system well, i
for all the teams they played against,
save one, used that style.
Varsity Coach Mfirchie Schwartz
may name several of the frosh squad j
to practice with the varsity after the
Big Game, for the first year men are j
eligible for the St. Mary's Pre- !
Flight game on Nov. 28.
VARSITY PROSPECTS
There are several members of the
squad that may do well with the
varsity. However, if they don't even
get a chance to play, Schwartz can
get a look at some of the prospects
for next season.
Coach Wilcox will aid Schwartz
for the rest of the season.
Lloyd Merriman and Ed Gunder
son have been elected co-captains
of the Freshman football team, j
Coach Francis Wilcox announced, i
As is the custom, a backfield and !
lineman share the honorary posi- I
tions.
Merriman, formerly a star at Clo
vis High Schol, has been a sparkplug
at the speedy left half spot, and is
definitely labeled as a promising
candidate for the varsity eleven next J
season.
