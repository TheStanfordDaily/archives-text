# Beaten Beavers Take Needed Rest
## 
### 
CORVALLIS, Ore., Nov. 1G (UP). |
j â€”The Oregon State Beavers rested i
i at home today after their 49 to 13
| shellacking by the Stanford Indians,
with the team as a whole in pretty j
good physical condition, Lon Stiner, j
| Beaver coach, said today.
Later in the week the Orangemen I
j will work out strategy for piercing |
the Webfoot defense. Stiner said he j
was relying on the Beavers' higher {
I scoring record so far this season to
| help O.S.C. over the top in a game j
| whose outcome was a toss-up.
