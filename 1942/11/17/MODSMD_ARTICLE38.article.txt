# Rose Bowl Heads To Speed up Bids
## 
### 
Members of the conference Rose
! Bowl committee met in San Fran
cisco Sunday to study ways of speed
ing up the invitation of an eastern
team to New Year's Day gridiron
classic at Pasadena.
The committee may decide within
the next 10 days whether to make its
selection ahead of the usual mid-
December date.
Heretofore, since the conference
entered into an agreement with the
original Tournament of Roses com
mittee, the team selected to repre
sent the conference in the Pasadena
classic was permitted to invite its
own opponent.
Speculation centered on the prob
ability that the conference Rose
Bowl committee had decided to ask
authority to issue the invitation to
the eastern team which will play in
ihe game.
