# Farm to Hear Gallup Editor Speak Tonight
## "Common Man" to Be Topic of Tonight's Tuesday Series Talk 
### 
"Can We Trust the Common
Man?" will be the subject of a lec
ture to be given tonight on the
Tuesday Evening Series program
at 7:30 in the Memorial Hall Audi
torium by William A. Lydgate, edi
tor of the American Institute of
Public Opinion.
There have always been two op
posing views of the capacity of the
common people to govern them
selves, particularly in times of cri
sis. The principle upon which our
democratic government rests is the
idea of America's great statesmen
that the people are able to make
decisions for themselves. Today
the totalitarian powers are chal-

lenging that principle, and accord
ing to Mr. Lydgate this challenge
is the basic issue of the present
war.
DEMOCRATIC WAY
He will support in his lecture
those who believe in the democratic
way by giving evidence from the
American Institute of Public Opin
ion, commonly known as the Gal
lup Poll.
One of the significant facts that
Mr. Lydgate will stress is that as
the war progresses and America be
comes more and more deeply in
volved in the struggle, American
public opinion continues to stay
ahead of its leaders.
FRONT IN EUROPE
If the American people had their
way. according to Mr. Lydgate and
the Gallup Poll, they would open a
second front in Europe now with
out waiting until the Allies are
stronger, they would draft for war
work single women between 21 and
35. they would set up a United Na
tions War Council, which would in
clude Russia, to direct the war, they
would forbid strikes in war indus
tries, and they would enforce a 10
per cent pay deduction for defense
bonds.
Mr. Lydgate will also discuss the
place of morale in our war effort.
He will attempt to answer such
questions as: How unified is our
country? Where are the danger
spots? What can be done to
strengthen morale?
