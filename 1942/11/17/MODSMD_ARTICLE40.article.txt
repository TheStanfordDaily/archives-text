# Zetes Edge Sigma Chis, 7-2; Firehouse Downs Kappa Sigma
## 
### 
Running power and shattering blocks brought the Firehouse to the
threshold of another Stanford intramural football playoff round yesterday
when they defeated a tricky Kappa Sigma team, (i-0. Even then, the prom
inence usually due to the winner of Ibis classic battle was somewhat over
shadowed by the antics of an underdog Sigma Chi team which almost

pulled the "upset of all upsets",
against Zeta Psi.
The Sigma Chi team spilled Zete
back Frank McCann for two points
worth of safety early in the first half,
and from then until late in the sec
ond the Zetes came very near to
being "out." The Sigma Chi's,
sparked by defense expert Bill
Ritchie, had trouble once when Mc-
Cann got to their 20-yard line, but
a bad lateral stopped the drive.
ELLIS FUNCTIONS
With only a few minutes to go and
the undefeated Zetes nearer this
fate worse than death, Jim Ellis
pulled a "Chuck Taylor" sneak into
the Sigma Chi backfield, intercepted
a lateral and rambled 50 yards for a
score.
The win also puts the Zetes into
the playoffs.
But back to the Kappa Sig-Fire
house mix. It was played in a driz
zling rain which took some of the
accuracy away from the passing of
Kappa Sig's back Johnny Broke. In
all fairness it must be admitted that
Broke was the only Kappa Sig player
of caliber comparable to the players
who almost beat the Firehouse in
the championship game last year,
losing in the last few minutes, 9-7,
The Firehouse, it appears, perpetu
ally are rugged and fast.
PLAY YESTERDAY
For the first half, yesterday, it was
the same story as last year. Neither
team could shake off the tenacious
defense of the other. Broke began
his long afternoon of being every
where he was needed by batting
down the only Firehouse first hall
threat of any consequence, a pass
over the goal intended for Kruger.
Flat passes, especially between
Broke and Tommy Doyle, kept the
blaze chasers back on their heels,
The line runs and blocking of the
Firemen was superior, but it looked
at hulftime as if the Kappa Sigs
might win through on passing.
Firehouse steamed through the
; Kappa Sig center at the opening ol
j the second half for several firsl
j downs. Then about halfway through
| Jerry Roinsted followed a perfecl
fan of blockers—Bill Berreyssa, Torr
Kruger in particular—over the Kap
! pa Sigma left tackle. He was off or
I a 45-yard gallop that meant victory
The Kappa Sigs started their besl
! variety of a rally, but a 70-yard booi
| by the Firehouse and a 15-yard clip
' ping penalty put them back on theii
j heels once, and a sloppy lateral end
| ed the last chance of Johnny Brooke
I to break clear. His epitaph for the
i afternon—almost but not quite.
1 It was the second straight vr>n

that the Kappa Sig-Firehouse game
matched two potential champions. It
was the second straight year that
careful blocking and ground power
won. But neither Cuadros or Dekes
to whom we talked were impressed.
The Phi K;.ps defeated the Sigma
Nu's, 6-0. Neither team scored until
the last two minutes of the final
period when Harry Dyck threw a
long pass to Harry Hicks for the win
ning touchdown.

PLAY YESTERDAY
For the first half, yesterday, it was
the same story as last year. Neither
team could shake off the tenacious
defense of the other. Broke began
his long afternoon of being every
where he was needed by batting
down the only Firehouse first hall
threat of any consequence, a pass
over the goal intended for Kruger.
Flat passes, especially between
Broke and Tommy Doyle, kept the
blaze chasers back on their heels,
The line runs and blocking of the
Firemen was superior, but it looked
at hulftime as if the Kappa Sigs
might win through on passing.
Firehouse steamed through the
; Kappa Sig center at the opening ol

j downs. Then about halfway through

fan of blockers—Bill Berreyssa, Torr

1 It was the second straight vr>n

that the Kappa Sig-Firehouse game
matched two potential champions. It
was the second straight year that
careful blocking and ground power
won. But neither Cuadros or Dekes
to whom we talked were impressed.
The Phi K;.ps defeated the Sigma
Nu's, 6-0. Neither team scored until
the last two minutes of the final
period when Harry Dyck threw a
long pass to Harry Hicks for the win
ning touchdown.
Running power and shattering blocks brought the Firehouse to the
threshold of another Stanford intramural football playoff round yesterday
when they defeated a tricky Kappa Sigma team, (i-0. Even then, the prom
inence usually due to the winner of Ibis classic battle was somewhat over
shadowed by the antics of an underdog Sigma Chi team which almost

pulled the "upset of all upsets",
against Zeta Psi.
The Sigma Chi team spilled Zete
back Frank McCann for two points
worth of safety early in the first half,
and from then until late in the sec
ond the Zetes came very near to
being "out." The Sigma Chi's,
sparked by defense expert Bill
Ritchie, had trouble once when Mc-
Cann got to their 20-yard line, but
a bad lateral stopped the drive.
ELLIS FUNCTIONS
With only a few minutes to go and
the undefeated Zetes nearer this
fate worse than death, Jim Ellis
pulled a "Chuck Taylor" sneak into
the Sigma Chi backfield, intercepted
a lateral and rambled 50 yards for a
score.
The win also puts the Zetes into
the playoffs.
But back to the Kappa Sig-Fire
house mix. It was played in a driz
zling rain which took some of the
accuracy away from the passing of
Kappa Sig's back Johnny Broke. In
all fairness it must be admitted that
Broke was the only Kappa Sig player
of caliber comparable to the players
who almost beat the Firehouse in
