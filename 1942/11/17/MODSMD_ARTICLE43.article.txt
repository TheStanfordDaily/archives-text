THREE years ago today the Nazi conquerors
inflicted yet another outrage on broken
Czechoslovakia. In Prague they murdered 160
Czech students. Then they sealed indefinitely
the doors of the universities throughout the
land, and that was the end of higher education
in Czechoslovakia.
For there was no place in Hitler's Order for
education and for militant, aspiring youth.
There was no place for the free, untrammeled
spirit, the uncompromising mind, the aspiring
intellect. The quest for truth was officially done
to death, and violently, that day three years ago
in Prague. It had already been pronounced
dead by the Nazis in Germany and in Austria,
and it was yet to be written off the books in
all of Western Europe.
It was to youth that the Germans looked for
their fiercest opposition. Youth which was not
hemmed in, caught in the paralysis of fear or
drugged with apathy. Youth which had yet its
world to conquer and to claim. Youth which
still sought truth and still cherished freedom.
And so the Nazis tortured and murdered the
students, silenced the professors, locked fast
the doors of the universities.
In Britain, France, and in this country, the
winds of freedom blew still, but to little avail to
stem the Nazi threat. A new Dark Age settled
down over Europe.
Today, this day, our newspapers bring us
reports of victory on all fronts. In Russia, in
the Pacific, and in North Africa. But, while the
road we are traveling leads surely to victory,
we are still a long way from it.
Today the free and freedom-loving youth of
all countries is going off to war to lift and light
the darkness that has settled down and engulfed
the youth of Europe. It is our challenge and
our hope. A heritage of freedom has armed us
well for the fight.
This day has been dedicated to the memory
of those murdered Czech students and is being
observed in lands all over the world as Inter
national Students Day. As last year there will
be meetings and demonstrations in England,
Russia, China, India, Canada, New Zealand,
South America, and the United States. Perhaps
in Paris the students will march under the Arc
de Triomphe, as they did last year, singing the
Marseillaise, and some will be killed by German
soldiers.
But the biggest youth demonstration of all
will be in the ruins of Stalingrad, on the sands
of North Africa, and the battle-churned waters
of the Pacific.â€” Amie Reichert
