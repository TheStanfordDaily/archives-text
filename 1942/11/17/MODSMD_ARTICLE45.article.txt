### TED NORTON 
PRAISE THE LORD!
I am privileged to record a great day for the
United Nations. In the Solomons, the Navy has
smashed a Japanese battle fleet, and with it the
second Nipponese attempt to recapture the
southern Solomons. In Africa, the pincers are
closing around Rommel. Before Stalingrad, the
Russians have stamped out the last flames of
the renewed Nazi offensive against that valiant
city. Allied bombs are raining down on Europe.
On New Guinea, Mac Arthur's forces are at
tacking the last troops blocking the way to
Buna. In the Caucasus, the Red Army is moving
forward.
There is only one question: is it Victory?
The answer is, no, not yet. This is only the
preliminary, the necessary prelude.
The Axis position in North Africa has been
compared to that of the British in the ill-fated
campaign in Greece: the enemy moving in from
all sides, the sea at their back, the air under
enemy control. It seems clear that Hitler has
decided to make a last-ditch stand, that he is
pouring all the men and machines possible
across the Mediterranean. There have been re
ports that Hitler has shoved the Italian fleet to
sea, a desperate measure.
The most resounding naval victory of the war
has just been won in the Solomons. What can
we expect from that victory? It seems clear
that the Japanese will not be able again to at
tack Guadalcanal in the immediate future, and
that we will be able to crush the Nip forces
already there. As far as I can see, the Solomons
will represent a stalemate unless the United
Nations continue their advance.
There is one other possibility, that the Japs
will press their offensive elsewhere, Alaska,
China, Siberia, either as a feint, to draw us from
the Solomons, or seriously. The opportunities
opened to the United Nations by the Axis de
feat on the sea, and the impending fall of Buna,
Jap base in eastern New Guinea, are many and
obvious. My own choice for the next objective
is one of the bases in the Marshall Islands,
Truk, Ponape, or Wotje.
Again, when Africa is cleaned up, and it
seems certain that it will be, I can only see an
other period of stalemate.
The point is, that the initiative will be with
the United Nations, and that we will do nothing
until we are good and ready. Our high com
mands, it appears, would rather be safe than
sorry. I do not believe that there will be any
new offensive even if it were possible imme
diately; time will be taken to play, muster, and
supply.

tack Guadalcanal in the immediate future, and
that we will be able to crush the Nip forces
already there. As far as I can see, the Solomons
will represent a stalemate unless the United
Nations continue their advance.
There is one other possibility, that the Japs
will press their offensive elsewhere, Alaska,
China, Siberia, either as a feint, to draw us from
the Solomons, or seriously. The opportunities
opened to the United Nations by the Axis de
feat on the sea, and the impending fall of Buna,
Jap base in eastern New Guinea, are many and
obvious. My own choice for the next objective
is one of the bases in the Marshall Islands,
Truk, Ponape, or Wotje.
Again, when Africa is cleaned up, and it
seems certain that it will be, I can only see an
other period of stalemate.
The point is, that the initiative will be with
the United Nations, and that we will do nothing
until we are good and ready. Our high com
mands, it appears, would rather be safe than
sorry. I do not believe that there will be any
new offensive even if it were possible imme
diately; time will be taken to play, muster, and
supply.
PRAISE THE LORD!
I am privileged to record a great day for the
United Nations. In the Solomons, the Navy has
smashed a Japanese battle fleet, and with it the
second Nipponese attempt to recapture the
southern Solomons. In Africa, the pincers are
closing around Rommel. Before Stalingrad, the
Russians have stamped out the last flames of
the renewed Nazi offensive against that valiant
city. Allied bombs are raining down on Europe.
On New Guinea, Mac Arthur's forces are at
tacking the last troops blocking the way to
Buna. In the Caucasus, the Red Army is moving
forward.
There is only one question: is it Victory?
The answer is, no, not yet. This is only the
preliminary, the necessary prelude.
The Axis position in North Africa has been
compared to that of the British in the ill-fated
campaign in Greece: the enemy moving in from
all sides, the sea at their back, the air under
enemy control. It seems clear that Hitler has
decided to make a last-ditch stand, that he is
pouring all the men and machines possible
across the Mediterranean. There have been re
ports that Hitler has shoved the Italian fleet to
sea, a desperate measure.
The most resounding naval victory of the war
has just been won in the Solomons. What can
we expect from that victory? It seems clear
that the Japanese will not be able again to at
tack Guadalcanal in the immediate future, and
that we will be able to crush the Nip forces
already there. As far as I can see, the Solomons
will represent a stalemate unless the United
Nations continue their advance.
