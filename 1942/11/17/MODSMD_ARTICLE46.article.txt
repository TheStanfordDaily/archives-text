The Editor, Sir:
I only hope that my letter will be the first to
reach your hands in answer to the one which
appeared in this column last. Allow me to
express my views on the subject.
For shame, Mr. Moaning War Scientist, with
your vitriloic words for students and faculty!
Never has it been my misfortune to see a more
perfect example of a narrow mind. It seems,
Mr. Physicist, that you seek to override almost
two thousand years of Christmas tradition in
one fell swoop. How can your conscience per
mit such a thought?
I wonder if you ever heard of the first Christ
mas during World War I. A spirit which will
make sworn enemies leave the trenches and
exchange greetings is certainly too fine to be
abolished overnight.
Do not misunderstand me—my admiration
for our armed defenders is as great as yours,
but how can you, who share our comforts and
security, censure us for not being blown to bits
on the beach at Dieppe? When I see you, Mr.
Physicist, sweating in a tank on the Libyan
desert, I will retract my remarks; but until that
time, they will stand unchanged.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been feeling this coming on for sev
eral weeks now. Since the appearance of our
War-Scientist," and the replies to his letter, I
have felt more and more like baring my soul
to public gaze. I am not a "War-Scientist" and
I am not inclined to follow him off the plank into
deep water. On the other hand, when I hear
certain persons rejoicing over the fact that "300
people will be able to get to Del Monte this
year because gas rationing has been postponed
for a couple of weeks" and that "it's too bad that
we can t have a Big Game bonfire this year,"
I am inclined toward retching.
We are lucky to be in school now. The great
majority of us are doing what we are told and
the best we can with the orders we are given.
There is no need for hysterical screaming about
playing while our comrades are blown up in
Africa and at Dieppe. The war will not be won
by hysterics, but cool scientific skill. Surely
the scientific mind should realize this.
I think that we are, by and large, doing a fair
job of preparing for a greater task which is just
beyond us.

job of preparing for a greater task which is just
beyond us.
The Editor, Sir:
I only hope that my letter will be the first to
reach your hands in answer to the one which
appeared in this column last. Allow me to
express my views on the subject.
For shame, Mr. Moaning War Scientist, with
your vitriloic words for students and faculty!
Never has it been my misfortune to see a more
perfect example of a narrow mind. It seems,
Mr. Physicist, that you seek to override almost
two thousand years of Christmas tradition in
one fell swoop. How can your conscience per
mit such a thought?
I wonder if you ever heard of the first Christ
mas during World War I. A spirit which will
make sworn enemies leave the trenches and
exchange greetings is certainly too fine to be
abolished overnight.
Do not misunderstand me—my admiration
for our armed defenders is as great as yours,
but how can you, who share our comforts and
security, censure us for not being blown to bits
on the beach at Dieppe? When I see you, Mr.
Physicist, sweating in a tank on the Libyan
desert, I will retract my remarks; but until that
time, they will stand unchanged.

The Editor, Sir:
I have been feeling this coming on for sev
eral weeks now. Since the appearance of our
War-Scientist," and the replies to his letter, I
have felt more and more like baring my soul
to public gaze. I am not a "War-Scientist" and
I am not inclined to follow him off the plank into
deep water. On the other hand, when I hear
certain persons rejoicing over the fact that "300
people will be able to get to Del Monte this
year because gas rationing has been postponed
for a couple of weeks" and that "it's too bad that
we can t have a Big Game bonfire this year,"
I am inclined toward retching.
We are lucky to be in school now. The great
majority of us are doing what we are told and
the best we can with the orders we are given.
There is no need for hysterical screaming about
playing while our comrades are blown up in
Africa and at Dieppe. The war will not be won
by hysterics, but cool scientific skill. Surely
the scientific mind should realize this.
I think that we are, by and large, doing a fair
job of preparing for a greater task which is just
beyond us.
