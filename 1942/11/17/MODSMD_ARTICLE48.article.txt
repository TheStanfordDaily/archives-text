# Professor Bailey Writes Two New Historical Books
## 
### 
Two new historical books about subjects of present day interest have re
cently been published by Thomas A. Bailey, professor of the Stanford
history department.
The first, his "Diplomatic History of the American People," is a revised
and expanded edition of the original published in 1!)40. The most important

new feature is the addition of two
illustrated chapters on the develop
ments between the invasion of
Poland in 1939 and the assault on
Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The second, a 500-page mono
graph published by the Johns Hop
kins University Press, is entitled
"The Policy of the United States
Toward the Neutrals, 1917-1918." It
is an expansion and documentation
of the six lectures which Professor
Bailey delivered on the Albert Shaw
Foundation before the Walter Hines
Page School of International Rela
tions at the Johns Hopkins Univer
sity last spring.
The book was read in manuscript
form by most of the officials who had
a hand in shaping of our policy dur
ing the last war, and many of their
comments and recollections are in
cluded in the footnotes.
MANY CONTRIBUTORS
Some who contributed informa
tion in this way were Geoi'ge Creel,
chairman of the Committee on Public
Information; Vance C. McCormick,
chairman of the War Trade Board;
Frank L. Polk, acting Secretary of
State; and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor,
then a member of the War Trade
Board, later head of the Stanford
Food Research Institute. Professor
Bailey also had access to the private
papers of Woodrow Wilson and Sec
retary of State Robert Lansing.
TIMELY STUDY
This study has an unusual timeli
ness, because all of the important
neutrals today except Turkey were
neutral in 1917-18.
Professor Bailey concludes that on
the whole the United States took
few liberties with the strict letter of
neutral rights under international
law, although a number of legal
weapons, such as the embargo and
the blacklist, worked hardships on
small neurtal countries.—Ryan.

the whole the United States took
few liberties with the strict letter of
neutral rights under international
law, although a number of legal
weapons, such as the embargo and
the blacklist, worked hardships on
small neurtal countries.—Ryan.
Two new historical books about subjects of present day interest have re
cently been published by Thomas A. Bailey, professor of the Stanford
history department.
The first, his "Diplomatic History of the American People," is a revised
and expanded edition of the original published in 1!)40. The most important

new feature is the addition of two
illustrated chapters on the develop
ments between the invasion of
Poland in 1939 and the assault on
Pearl Harbor in 1941.
The second, a 500-page mono
graph published by the Johns Hop
kins University Press, is entitled
"The Policy of the United States
Toward the Neutrals, 1917-1918." It
is an expansion and documentation
of the six lectures which Professor
Bailey delivered on the Albert Shaw
Foundation before the Walter Hines
Page School of International Rela
tions at the Johns Hopkins Univer
sity last spring.
The book was read in manuscript
form by most of the officials who had
a hand in shaping of our policy dur
ing the last war, and many of their
comments and recollections are in
cluded in the footnotes.
MANY CONTRIBUTORS
Some who contributed informa
tion in this way were Geoi'ge Creel,
chairman of the Committee on Public
Information; Vance C. McCormick,
chairman of the War Trade Board;
Frank L. Polk, acting Secretary of
State; and Dr. Alonzo E. Taylor,
then a member of the War Trade
Board, later head of the Stanford
Food Research Institute. Professor
Bailey also had access to the private
papers of Woodrow Wilson and Sec
retary of State Robert Lansing.
TIMELY STUDY
This study has an unusual timeli
ness, because all of the important
neutrals today except Turkey were
neutral in 1917-18.
Professor Bailey concludes that on
the whole the United States took
few liberties with the strict letter of
neutral rights under international
law, although a number of legal
weapons, such as the embargo and
the blacklist, worked hardships on
small neurtal countries.—Ryan.
