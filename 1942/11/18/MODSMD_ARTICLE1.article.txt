# Editor Says People Have Horse Sense
## Lydgate Emphasized Thai Leaders Lag Behind Public Opinion 
### 
"By and large the common people
of this country have an amazing
amount of good old fashioned horse
.sense, and they don't need totalitar
ian leadership to tell them what to
do." This was the answer William A.
Lydgate gave to the question of his
lecture "Can We Trust the Common
Man?" last night on the Tuesday
Evening Series program.
As editor of the American Insti
tute of Public Opinion, Mr. Lydgate
stated that public opinion is one of
the most powerful forces at work to
day in forming the policy of our na
tion's war effort. The only trouble
is that the leadership of the country
lags way behind the public in de
termining and changing war policy.
As an example he mentioned that
the tragic fate of Wake Island might
have been prevented had Congress
listened to the force of public opin
ion. Ninety-one per cent of the peo
ple were in favor of expanding the
air force as far back as 1939, yet
Congress would not appropriate
enough money to even keep up the
standard of the year before. As a
result the marines on Wake Island
had only four airplanes to protect
them against the Jap onslaught.
As far back as 1938, the public was
overwhelmingly in favor of placing
an embargo on the export of scrap
iron and oil to Japan. Yet the State
Department continued to allow
American business concerns to ship
these vital war materials in an at
tempt to appease the Nipponese.
He also showed how Congress has
lagged in putting through the re
cently passed 18-19 year old draft
law. The general public had for a
long time supported this more, but
it is significant that even the ma
jority of 18 and 19-year-olds were
in favor of it.
Quoting the results of the Gallup
Poll, Mr. Lydgate stated that the
American people, if they had their
way. would set up a United Nations
War Council, would draft women
between 21 and 35 for war work,
would forbid strikes in war indus
tries, and would submit to the com
plete control of a manpower mobil
ization commission.
