# Dance to Give Free Tickets
## Farm Gets Chances For Bids at Rally 
### 
Plans to give away several free
tickets to the Big Game dance at the
Big Game rally tomorrow night
were completed yesterday, Ted
Eberle, chairman of the dance, an
nounced last night.
The big raffle will be conducted
on the same basis that the Palo Alto
theaters hold their Pot-O-Gold
nights. That is, a page in the Bawl
out will be selected by a drawing
and then a number on the selected
page will spot the individual to
whom the free ticket goes. "This
method," said chairman Eberle, "was
picked because it gives everyone at
Stanford that goes to the Rally a
chance to win the tickets."
AXE TO BE THERE—IF
Another item of interest on the
Big Game dance is that IF Stanford
wins the Axe Saturday afternoon,
the Axe will be on display at the
dance Saturday night. A special ar
rangement with the Rally Commit
tee has made this possible.
Almost 100 tickets to Ihe Ball have
been sold, according to Eberle. Tick
ets are selling in the A.S.S.U. office
from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. at $2.75, which
is a considerable reduction from the
price of last year's bids.
SMOOTH DECORATIONS
June Ellis and Jack Monteverdc,
co-chairmen of the dance's decora
tions committee, are now hard at
work to make this Red and White
Ball an attractive affair as possible,
and the decorations, according to
Eberle, are one of the features of th®
dance which should make it one of
the most distinctive events which
has yet taken place on the Stanford
campus.
Chairman Eberle further pointed
out that "the possibility of bad
weather and the fact that women's
late leaves have been cut an hour
should draw more Stanford men and
women than ever to the Ball."
The dance, featuring Gary Not
tingham's danceable band, will be
optionally formal and will last from
9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Orange punch and
little cakes will be served free.
