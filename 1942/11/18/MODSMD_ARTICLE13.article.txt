# Gaieties Gain Last Polish; Musicals Termed Brilliant
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
With iiist two days left until the Big Game Gaieties opens all over Me
morial Auditorium, the production staff, headed by Director Bob O'Neill,
is rapidly whipping the brilliant, fast-moving show into fitting shape for
a pre-Big Game activity climax.
Spectacular and extravagantly done are the staged musicals.

"The Morocco number, which
didn't expect to be so timely, is turn- |
ing out marvelously," says O'Neill, |
"and the mood set by the music alone
looks really authentic. We expect '
this to be one of the top numbers."

What might be considered a de
parture from regular Gaieties tech
nique is the colorfully staged polka.
"AMERICAN CAN"
"American Can," a production
number in the Earl Carroll tradition,
bounces along in a style that is ab
solutely nothing but modern Amer
icana.
"Stanford's version of the inter
national started out to be a simple
song by Dick Lyons, entitled 'Do I.'
What happens to it on its world tour
becomes more amazing each time it
is rehearsed," commented Dick Rab
bett, musical director.
Another staged musical, "Rainy
Afternoon," will be something to re
member long after the last curtain,
for it blends a swell tune with a
setting familiar to every college
student.

COPYISTS IJSTEI)
Copyists for the orchestra are j
Keast, Shaw, Brow, and Morrison, j
Rehearsal pianist and accompanist i
is Don O Neil 1, and Carl Weininger ;
has done the orchestrations.
Director Rabbett has modestly
stated, "A piano specialty is being
planned that'll bring the house down,
followed closely by another surprise
that will level the place."

Although there are only a few
scattered tickets left in the 85-
cent section for the evening per- !
formance of Friday's Gaieties, ex
cellent seats remain for the mat
inee. These tickets will be sold
today in the A.S.S.U. office from
9 to 12 and from 1 to 5.
With iiist two days left until the Big Game Gaieties opens all over Me
morial Auditorium, the production staff, headed by Director Bob O'Neill,
is rapidly whipping the brilliant, fast-moving show into fitting shape for
a pre-Big Game activity climax.
Spectacular and extravagantly done are the staged musicals.

"The Morocco number, which
didn't expect to be so timely, is turn- |
ing out marvelously," says O'Neill, |
"and the mood set by the music alone
looks really authentic. We expect '
this to be one of the top numbers."

What might be considered a de
parture from regular Gaieties tech
nique is the colorfully staged polka.
"AMERICAN CAN"
"American Can," a production
number in the Earl Carroll tradition,
bounces along in a style that is ab
solutely nothing but modern Amer
icana.
"Stanford's version of the inter
national started out to be a simple
song by Dick Lyons, entitled 'Do I.'
What happens to it on its world tour
becomes more amazing each time it
is rehearsed," commented Dick Rab
bett, musical director.
Another staged musical, "Rainy
Afternoon," will be something to re
member long after the last curtain,
for it blends a swell tune with a
setting familiar to every college
student.
