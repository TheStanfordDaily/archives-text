## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (U.R)
President Roosevelt tonight sharply
rebuked those who speak about the
war "from guesswork based on in
formation of doubtful accuracy."
Speaking from Washington to the
annual Herald Tribune Forum in
New York City, he explained, in
time of war, the government "can
not always give spot news ot the
people."
PRECLUDED FROM TALK
"This means," he said, "that those
relatively few people who do have
the facts from all over the world, not
only every day but every hour of the
day, are precluded from discussing
these facts publicly, except in the
most general of terms. If they did
they would almost inevitably say
tilings which would help the people
who arc trying to destroy us."
"Loose talk delays victory," he
said. "Loose talk is the damp that
gets into powder. We prefer to keep
our powder dry."
'GIGANTIC JOB' AHEAD
Ho told of the "gigantic job" ahead
of the United Nations in fighting the
was and cautioned against undue
exaltation at the present stage of
the global conflict.
"During the past two weeks," he
said, "we have had a great, deal of
good news and it would seem that
the turning point of this war has at
last been reached. But this is no
time for exaltation. This is no time
for anything but fighting and work
ing to win.
"We have had an uphill fight, and
it will continue to be uphill, all the
way. There can be no coasting to
victory."
