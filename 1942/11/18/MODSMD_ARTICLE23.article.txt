## Redskins Must Remain 'High' To Sink Bears in '42 Big Game 
### BOB SONTAG Sports Editor, Stanford Daily 
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison, the
of' sarge to his intimates, and vet
eran coach of the California foot
ball corps, opines that 90 per cent
of a winning team's punch results
from mental attitude in the game.
Well, out on the Stanford practice
field yesterday was enough of the
Stubber's ointment to quash all
ideas that the Indians won't be be
| "high" for the game, whilst the
Bears will.
Mr, Allison isn't the only man in
the world that goes for this mental
attitude stuff. ,
There's a soft-spoken gent who's
keeping his word with the Red
skins, and that's Stanford's own
coach, one Marchmont "Marchie"
Schwartz.
The Schwartz solution to keeping
his lads fit is a two-hour practice,
no more, no less. That was Mar
chie's promise when the season be
gan, and no one can say that the
Indians ever went into a ball game
in stale condition.
Keeping that system in use, two
days of working out have brought
the squad to mid-week "highness"
—now all the local club has to do
is to hang onto that highness and
take it into next Saturday's Big
Game.
That's one of the biggest orders
any football coach ever had, or any
team ever had. If Schwartz knew
exactly how to keep the Indians to
! their highest level, he'd be a mil
j lionaire. He'd sell the idea to every
I other mentor in the country, and
I sit back to watch games turn out
I all ties—because each eleven would
I have just the right attitude, and
| each would then be on even terms.
But so far, Marchie hasn't figured
jit out. and neither has any other
| football coach.
BUT: California always has it
Big Game time. Seems as if Alli
| son pushes the high button, and
the Bears give it on the button
with a slam-bang type of game that
carries a team along to victory even
when its material, stacked up
against its opponents, is far infe
rior.
The player who's going to mean
everything as far as California is
concerned is one Jim Jurkovich.
They call him jolting Jim, and
though he hasn't made all the
Bears' touchdowns this year, he
| has figured in every one of 'em.
Last Big Game, jolting Jim took
one on the chin and was removed
from the game. Stanford didn't
meet Mr. Jurkovich much on the
playing field. In fact, at most Jur
kovich has met the Stanford Red
I but for a few minutes.
So we don't know exactly what
■he can do. But we do know he
( hasn't suffered any injuries the
likes of those that stopped him last
year. He's wearing a special hel
met to protect his cranium.
Jurkovich is an "A' 'student in
engineering, according to Allison.
The guy is just plain smart, that's
•'-ill. And he isn't going to IJe
I knocked out of the 1942 game. He'll
i be in there all the way, and he'll
■ be one halfback the big Stanford
line must stop, to stop California.
If Cal wins this Big Game, its
season may be considered a dis
tinct success, including four losses
to Oregon State, Southern Cali
fornia, U.C.L.A., and Santa Clara.
