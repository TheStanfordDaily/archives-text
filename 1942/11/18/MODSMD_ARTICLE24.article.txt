# Dekes to Gash With Phi Delts
## 
### 
Last of eight intramural grid
titles Will be decided this after
noon barring rain when Deke pits
its fabled power against once beaten
but dangerous Phi Delta Theta, and
the unbeaten Fijis mix with strong
Delta Chi.
According to mural director
Harry Wolter, games will be played
if Jupe Pluvius permits; if not, they
will be rescheduled for Friday.
League playoffs will be held after
Thanksgiving.
Already holders of league cham
pionships are El Toro, El Cuadro,
Zete, Firehouse, Encina Basement,
and Encina 2W, with the Cuadros
and the blaze chasers looming as
favorites.
The Dekes, with Bill Joselyn and
Ches Saroyan ready to go again
after sustaining injuries in last

week's play, should stop the Phi
Delts. A trio of passers, Phil Prince,
Bud Youker, and Bob Guinan, plus
a dependable defense may not be
enough for a Phi Delt upset, how
ever.
Comparative scores indicate a
close tussle. The Dekes topped Chi
Psi, 19-7, while the Phi Delts whip
ped the same club by a 20-7 score.
In all other comparisons there is a
decided advantage with D.K.E.
An offensive duel between Fiji
Bill Harms and Delta Chi Scotty
Scott looms in the other of the
day's features. Although Fiji is fa
vored, Delta Chi has turned in im
pressive performances in all their
contests and may well pull the sur
prise of the day.
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 17 (UP).â€”
Coach Jeff Cravath indicated to
day ho will spend the greater part
of the next ten days drilling his
University of Southern California
backs in pass defense.
