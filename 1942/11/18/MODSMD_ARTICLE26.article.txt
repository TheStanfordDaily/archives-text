LOS ANGELES. Nov. 17 (UP). —
A counterpart of the famous Stan
ford-California Axe and the Mich
igan-Minnesota Little Brown Jug
was born today as officials of U.S.C.
and U.C.L.A. designated the Bruin
Victory Bell, "kidnapped" last year
by the Trojans, as a trophy for the
annual football winner.

and tolled out each U.C.L.A. score.
After one game last year, how
ever, the bell turned up missing
and a series of inter - campus
