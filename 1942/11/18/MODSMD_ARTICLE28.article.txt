# Georgia-Georgia Tech Winner To Play in Rose Bowl Classic
## 
### 
PASADENA, Nov. 17 (UP).—The
winner of the Georgia - Georgia |
Tech football game Nov. 28 is al
most certain to be invited to repre
sent the East in the Rose Bowl here
Jan. 1, an excellent source reported
tonight.
Speculation on which team will
represent the East was given im
petus today by the announcement
of Col. H. E. Beal of the Western
Defense Command that the Army
"has no objections" to the game
being played.
Although Pacific Coast Confer
ence officials refused to divulge
any action taken in their secret
meeting held last Sunday, authori
ties close to the subject believe the
Coast moguls have decided to dis
card their former practice of wait
ing until the season is over before
choosing an Eastern opponent to
meet the Western representative.
The reason for the change is ap
parent:
Sentiment on the West Coast
strings with either Frankie Sink
wich and his Georgia teammates
or the "wrambling wreck" from
Georgia Tech.
Georgia has played on the Coast
before—in 1931 and 1933 with the
University of Southern California.
Georgia Tech participated in a
Rose Bowl game in 1929, defeating
California 8-7 featured by the fa
mous '"wrong way" run by Roy Rie
gels of the Bears.
Secondly, conference officials are
certain the winner of the Georgia-
Georgia Tech clash will receive
bids to other bowl games and that
the first invitation received will ob
tain the most consideration.
There are three teams on the
West Coast which are "possibili
ties" for the Rose Bowl classic—
University of California at Los An
geles, Washington State and the
University of Southern California.
Washington State has only to
meet the University of Washington
to complete its conference play. If
the Cougars win they'll have six
wins, one loss (to U.S.C.) and no
ties.
U.C.L.A. has three games remain
ing—Washington, Idaho and U.S.C.
The last game with the Trojans
could be the deciding championship
game but it is not until Dec. 12.
That Dec. 12 date is the stum
bling block that experts believe
will bring about the early invita

tion to one of the two Southern
teams.
The Trojans meet Montana on
Dec. 5 in what should be a com
paratively easy victory and then
tangle with U.C.L.A. in that all
important clash.
The Army's announcement of
permission to stage the most color
ful of the Bowl games cleared the
way lor the re-staging of the spec
tacle which was transplanted from
the Rose Bowl last Jan. 1 to Dur
ham, N.C., where Oregon State de
feated Duke.
Since that time, military condi
tions on the West Coast have im
proved to the extent that the West
ern Defense Command has per
mitted most big sports events to be
held, including horse racing at Tan
foran, the regular Pacific Coast
Conference football schedule and
the East-West football game at San
Francisco on Jan. 1.

meet the Western representative.
The reason for the change is ap
parent:
Sentiment on the West Coast
strings with either Frankie Sink
wich and his Georgia teammates
or the "wrambling wreck" from
Georgia Tech.
Georgia has played on the Coast
before—in 1931 and 1933 with the
University of Southern California.
Georgia Tech participated in a
Rose Bowl game in 1929, defeating
California 8-7 featured by the fa
mous '"wrong way" run by Roy Rie
gels of the Bears.
Secondly, conference officials are
certain the winner of the Georgia-
Georgia Tech clash will receive
bids to other bowl games and that
the first invitation received will ob
tain the most consideration.
There are three teams on the
West Coast which are "possibili
ties" for the Rose Bowl classic—
University of California at Los An
geles, Washington State and the
University of Southern California.
Washington State has only to
meet the University of Washington
to complete its conference play. If
the Cougars win they'll have six
wins, one loss (to U.S.C.) and no
ties.
U.C.L.A. has three games remain
ing—Washington, Idaho and U.S.C.
The last game with the Trojans
could be the deciding championship
game but it is not until Dec. 12.
That Dec. 12 date is the stum
bling block that experts believe
will bring about the early invita

tion to one of the two Southern
teams.
The Trojans meet Montana on
Dec. 5 in what should be a com
paratively easy victory and then
tangle with U.C.L.A. in that all
important clash.
The Army's announcement of
permission to stage the most color
ful of the Bowl games cleared the
way lor the re-staging of the spec
tacle which was transplanted from
the Rose Bowl last Jan. 1 to Dur
ham, N.C., where Oregon State de
feated Duke.
Since that time, military condi
tions on the West Coast have im
proved to the extent that the West
ern Defense Command has per
mitted most big sports events to be
held, including horse racing at Tan
foran, the regular Pacific Coast
Conference football schedule and
the East-West football game at San
Francisco on Jan. 1.
PASADENA, Nov. 17 (UP).—The
winner of the Georgia - Georgia |
Tech football game Nov. 28 is al
most certain to be invited to repre
sent the East in the Rose Bowl here
Jan. 1, an excellent source reported
tonight.
Speculation on which team will
represent the East was given im
petus today by the announcement
of Col. H. E. Beal of the Western
Defense Command that the Army
"has no objections" to the game
being played.
Although Pacific Coast Confer
ence officials refused to divulge
any action taken in their secret
meeting held last Sunday, authori
ties close to the subject believe the
Coast moguls have decided to dis
card their former practice of wait
ing until the season is over before
choosing an Eastern opponent to
