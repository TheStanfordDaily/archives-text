# Farm Student, War Widow, To Christen Navy Destroyer
## 
### KAY SCHWARTZ 
A dark slender girl standing on a
dock at the Navy Yard in Orange,
Tex., will christen one of the Navy's
newest destroyers next January and
send it out to fight in a war that
came so close to this girl when Pearl
Harbor was attacked.
She's Mrs. Joanne Jones, widow
of Ensign Herbert Jones, who was
posthumously awarded the Con
gressional Medal of Honor for his
extreme valor at Pearl Harbor last
Dec. 7. But now she is also *"Joby,
Jones, an undergraduate student
here at Stanford.
Notified by the Navy Department
several weeks ago that one of its
new destroyers was to be named for
her husband, Mrs. Jones was also
invited to christen the ship at
launching ceremonies to be held in
Texas after Christmas.
REAL WAR TO HER
War to most college students is
still a rather ominous unreality, for
it's hard to comprehend something
that doesn't actually touch you. But
to that girl who saw the Japs bomb
Pearl Harbor and the ship on which
her husband was stationed de
stroyed. war is all the tragedy and
suffering that we read about and
forget.
The beginning of her story is like
that of so many young girls in peace
time but the end of it is one of the
consequences of war that some of
those girls who married men in the
armed forces may have to face in the
ensuing months.
She was married in Honolulu in
the spring of 1941 as her husband
was stationed at Pearl Harbor. The
glamor of navy life in peacetime is
definitely not overrated, according
to Mrs. Jones. "Young officers'
wives were treated like royalty and
at least once a week there were
parties on board the ships stationed
in the harbor," she said. That was a
thrill I'll never forget, those ships
riding at anchor blazing with lights
on the dark water."
HUSBAND'S DEATH
But Dec. 7 came and the lights
weren't there anymore for Joanne
Jones and thousands like her. News
of her husband's death reached her
several days after the attack, and he
was buried at Pearl Harbor with full
military honors.
Securing a seat on one of the first
clippers to leave the islands, Mrs.
Jones arrived back in this country
about Dec. 20. She decided to re
sume her college studies and en

rolled in Stanford last spring quar
ter.
After her return to this country
Mrs. Jones was notified by the War
Department that her husband had
been posthumously awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor, the
highest honor the U.S. bestows on a
member of the armed forces. Life
magazine carried an article on En
sign Jones' heroic exploits as have
several other national publications.
HARD ADJUSTMENT
In a few weeks a whole year since
our entrance into the war will have
passed. It's been a hard year for
Joanne Jones and many like her, but
she has made her adjustment and is
carrying on her new way of life.
She's learned the hardest lesson of
all; that the world doesn't stop mov
ing and you've got to keep up with
it no matter what happens.
And when a bottle of champagne
is broken over the bow of the de
stroyer, U.S.S. Herbert C. Jones, and
it slides out into the water next Jan
uary, the prayers of a lot of people
will be going with it. The very spe
cial ones, however, will be from that
dark, slender girl standing on the
dock.

of Ensign Herbert Jones, who was
posthumously awarded the Con
gressional Medal of Honor for his
extreme valor at Pearl Harbor last
Dec. 7. But now she is also *"Joby,
Jones, an undergraduate student
here at Stanford.
Notified by the Navy Department
several weeks ago that one of its
new destroyers was to be named for
her husband, Mrs. Jones was also
invited to christen the ship at
launching ceremonies to be held in
Texas after Christmas.
REAL WAR TO HER
War to most college students is
still a rather ominous unreality, for
it's hard to comprehend something
that doesn't actually touch you. But
to that girl who saw the Japs bomb
Pearl Harbor and the ship on which
her husband was stationed de
stroyed. war is all the tragedy and
suffering that we read about and
forget.
The beginning of her story is like
that of so many young girls in peace
time but the end of it is one of the
consequences of war that some of
those girls who married men in the
armed forces may have to face in the
ensuing months.
She was married in Honolulu in
the spring of 1941 as her husband
was stationed at Pearl Harbor. The
glamor of navy life in peacetime is
definitely not overrated, according
to Mrs. Jones. "Young officers'
wives were treated like royalty and
at least once a week there were
parties on board the ships stationed
in the harbor," she said. That was a
thrill I'll never forget, those ships
riding at anchor blazing with lights
on the dark water."
HUSBAND'S DEATH
But Dec. 7 came and the lights
weren't there anymore for Joanne
Jones and thousands like her. News
of her husband's death reached her
several days after the attack, and he
was buried at Pearl Harbor with full
military honors.
Securing a seat on one of the first
clippers to leave the islands, Mrs.
Jones arrived back in this country
about Dec. 20. She decided to re
sume her college studies and en

rolled in Stanford last spring quar
ter.
After her return to this country
Mrs. Jones was notified by the War
Department that her husband had
been posthumously awarded the
Congressional Medal of Honor, the
highest honor the U.S. bestows on a
member of the armed forces. Life
magazine carried an article on En
sign Jones' heroic exploits as have
several other national publications.
HARD ADJUSTMENT
In a few weeks a whole year since
our entrance into the war will have
passed. It's been a hard year for
Joanne Jones and many like her, but
she has made her adjustment and is
carrying on her new way of life.
She's learned the hardest lesson of
all; that the world doesn't stop mov
ing and you've got to keep up with
it no matter what happens.
And when a bottle of champagne
is broken over the bow of the de
stroyer, U.S.S. Herbert C. Jones, and
it slides out into the water next Jan
uary, the prayers of a lot of people
will be going with it. The very spe
cial ones, however, will be from that
dark, slender girl standing on the
dock.
A dark slender girl standing on a
dock at the Navy Yard in Orange,
