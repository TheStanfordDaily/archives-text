# Eastern Gas Cut To Three Gallons
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).â€”
Reduction in the value of the basic
"A" gasoline ration coupon from
four to three gallons in 16 of the
17 now rationed Eastern Seaboard
states was ordered tonight by the
Office of Price Administration, ef
fective Nov. 22 . Only the rationed
section of West Virginia is exempt.
Today's order will not change the
basic four-gallon allowance for the
rest of the country when nation
wide gasoline rationing goes into
effect on Dec. 1.
Price Administrator Leon Hen
derson pointed out that the cut was
necessitated because the African
campaign put a new drain on sup
plies hitherto available for the
East.

Income from all major sources ex
cept inheritance taxes, horse racing
revenue and the "in lieu" tax was
greater in 1941-42 than the preceding
year.
