# Few Colleges Shift Vacations To Comply With ODT Request

(Editor's Note: The following story is a release from the Office of War
Information and was a part of their University News Letter.)
Response from colleges and universities-that were requested to shift their
vacation dates in order to relieve Christmas travel jams has been poor, the
Office of Defense Transportation reports.

â€¢ Early in September, regional pas-,
senger associations with the endorse
ment of the ODT sent letters to all
colleges and universities asking that
they start their Christmas vacations
on or around Dec. 15, and not call
their students back until Jan. 15.
From the 1050 letters sent to colleges
in the Eastern area, 125 replies have
been received to date. Some of the
institutions that answered agreed to
modify their vacation schedules, but
the major part stated that because
their calendars were already made
up, and because they were working
on accelerated war schedules, they
did not feel that they could comply
with the railroads' request. The ODT
reports that this reaction from east
ern colleges is fairly typical of col
leges all over the country.
With railroad schedules frozen so
that no special vacation trains can
be put on to relieve the seasonal
rush, the ODT predicts that people
attempting to travel in the Christ
mas week may find themselves
standing on the platform unable to
get accommodations.
The American Association of Rail
roads reports that passenger travel
on the railroads has increased by
50 per cent since last year; 40 per
cent of Pullman train facilities and
15 per cent of the space on day

coaches is being used to move troops,
and Christmas furloughs for the
armed forces will still further in
crease the burden on the trains.
In a second effort to persuade
American colleges and universities
to cooperate in the Christmas trans
portation problem, passenger asso
ciations will send personal represen
tatives on a campus-to-campus can
vass starting about November.
