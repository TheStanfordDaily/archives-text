# Bob and Charlie:
## 
### 
SIX months ago Harold Shafer sat in this chair
and wrote an editorial to the losing asso
ciate editor. Now, with two quarters of Daily
editorship behind, the outgoing Daily editor tra
ditionally has a little ditty to write to the losing
candidate.
Sometimes it's harder to say something than
it is to write, but today the opposite is the case.
Bob Sontag did not lose today; he won for him
self the position of managing editor for Volume
103. To the innocent public, the position of
managing editor bears little glamour—the editor
gets all of the glory. To the managing editor
goes the job of assigning stories to staff mem
bers and of bawling out delinquent reporters.
His position is definitely not glamorous but THE
most essential one on The Daily.
The forgotten man today is not the losing can
didate or the outgoing editor, but one Charlie
Allen. It has been the tradition of The Daily
to elect one of the two associate editors; this
year the war made the circumstances different.
Charlie, like many of us, has a bigger job to
do than working on The Daily. He is going to
be one of those fighters from the ranks of the
college V-7 class who are going to help keep
this country free.
Charlie will graduate in March as a middle
of-the-year-man who will get his diploma at
the postoffice and walk out of the University
without a formal graduation, a Senior Week,
or a Senior Ball. There are many of us who
would complain because of that, but not Char
lie. His job in Uncle Sam's fighting forces will
be in good hands.
Fortune has allowed Bob Sontag another two
quarters in Stanford. But after graduation he
will join his Enlisted Reserve "classmates" at
some induction center and become a member
of the United States Army.
So, to Bob, we say we know you will handle
your job with the same beautiful efficiency and
interest which was characteristic of your regime
as sports editor. And to Charlie, we'll see you
in the Libe until March, and then we'll just have
to take it for granted that you will be doing
your part—and that isn't wishful thinking—two
years with you on The Daily has convinced us.
