IT'S usually foolish to fight with rival news
papers, and we believe a recent editorial and
letter in the Daily Californian preset 'a not al
together untrue picture of the Stanford rooting
section and offer a challenge to the students of
this University.
Monday we were accused of being spiritless.
This was not unfair because we are and usually
have been fair-weather rooters for our football
teams. We can't deny the charge made by the
Daily Californian, but we can accept the chal
lenge and show the Cal rooting section and the
Stanford football team that we can support a
team whether it wins or loses.
Whether we have spirit or not, we deserve to
be complimented upon our clean yells. We at
Stanford have the ability to keep within our
desires to challenge the ancestry of the referee
and to scatter waste paper, etc., throughout the
rooting section. True, the morals of the Bear
rooting section have improved, but they still
bear the tinge of downright dirt from last year
and years past.
We are not trying to set up the Stanford
rooting section as an ideal place for your grand
mother to sit, but we do feel that we at least
realize certain things should not be said and
done when a questionable decision is made.
Naturally, this is not printed as a challenge
for an answer from the Daily Californian, but
we v/ould hate to see this argument go with
out rebuttal.
