# BULL SESSION
## 
### H. D. Thoreau 
If only the administration could somehow
condescend to move finals up to this week-end,
it could be truly said that the apex of the quar
ter, in every respect, would be reached during
the coming four days. As it is, there are going
to be quite a few real vital things going on:
SPORTING CONTESTS
There's the Cal-Stanford crew race Saturday
morning up on the Berkeley estuary. It should
be a tight battle all the way, now that we have
our new boat house, new shells, new spirit, etc.
In the water, also, but not the same water, will
be the Cal-Stanford water polo match across the
Bay. Although we dropped the first of the two
Bear tilts, 3-2, a win this time is not out of the
question.
There will be a State U.-Stanford football
match Saturday too, I think.
ENTERTAINMENT
Friday afternoon and evening Ram's Head
will put on the 131 st annual Big Game Gaieties,
the funniest show you'd ever want to see. The
director spent three days in the rest home a
couple of weeks ago, after splitting his sides at
the first rehearsal of the show. I dropped in
Monday night at a rehearsal of the entire show,
and I can safely say that it was the most pleas
ant eight hours I have ever spent. Along the
same line, the dramatic manager wanted to get
something in Bull Session about these "George
says . . . !" signs that are around the campus.
Anyone who wants to know what George does
say, call PA 7712.
Also in the way of entertainment over the
week-end, "Get Hep to Love," starring Jane
Frazee, is being held over at the Mayfield.
PUBLICATIONS
To tie in with the general hilarity of the week
end and also so that they will be in good shape
to take to the game Saturday, the Chaparral pub
lication date is being held up until Friday. This
gives the pressmen plenty of time to read the
mag, and it boosts circulation by keeping the
people waiting longer. The editor took time
off to go to a class last week, which is another
reason for the tardy release.
But competing with the Big Game Chappie
for prominence Friday morning will be the Big
Game Daily. The biggest issue of the quarter,
it will include ten pages of colorful stories about
everything you might want to read about on a
Friday morning. And there is no increase in
price either.
MISCELLANEOUS
How many chintzes do you know who are
going down to Del Monte Saturday morning,
and spend the afternoon imbibing, basking, or
golfing? I know several. I hide my face for
them.
I don't insist on everyone being rabid football
fans, but if they are going to take the week-end
off, spend lots of money, and have a good time
because it's Big Game week-end, they should
at least have have the decency to go to the Big
Game.
But if you insist on being a chintz, I know
where you can sell your ticket.

everything you might want to read about on a
Friday morning. And there is no increase in
price either.
MISCELLANEOUS
How many chintzes do you know who are
going down to Del Monte Saturday morning,
and spend the afternoon imbibing, basking, or
golfing? I know several. I hide my face for
them.
I don't insist on everyone being rabid football
fans, but if they are going to take the week-end
off, spend lots of money, and have a good time
because it's Big Game week-end, they should
at least have have the decency to go to the Big
Game.
But if you insist on being a chintz, I know
where you can sell your ticket.
If only the administration could somehow
condescend to move finals up to this week-end,
it could be truly said that the apex of the quar
ter, in every respect, would be reached during
the coming four days. As it is, there are going
to be quite a few real vital things going on:
SPORTING CONTESTS
There's the Cal-Stanford crew race Saturday
morning up on the Berkeley estuary. It should
be a tight battle all the way, now that we have
our new boat house, new shells, new spirit, etc.
In the water, also, but not the same water, will
be the Cal-Stanford water polo match across the
Bay. Although we dropped the first of the two
Bear tilts, 3-2, a win this time is not out of the
question.
There will be a State U.-Stanford football
match Saturday too, I think.
ENTERTAINMENT
Friday afternoon and evening Ram's Head
will put on the 131 st annual Big Game Gaieties,
the funniest show you'd ever want to see. The
director spent three days in the rest home a
couple of weeks ago, after splitting his sides at
the first rehearsal of the show. I dropped in
Monday night at a rehearsal of the entire show,
and I can safely say that it was the most pleas
ant eight hours I have ever spent. Along the
same line, the dramatic manager wanted to get
something in Bull Session about these "George
says . . . !" signs that are around the campus.
Anyone who wants to know what George does
say, call PA 7712.
Also in the way of entertainment over the
week-end, "Get Hep to Love," starring Jane
Frazee, is being held over at the Mayfield.
PUBLICATIONS
To tie in with the general hilarity of the week
end and also so that they will be in good shape
to take to the game Saturday, the Chaparral pub
lication date is being held up until Friday. This
gives the pressmen plenty of time to read the
mag, and it boosts circulation by keeping the
people waiting longer. The editor took time
off to go to a class last week, which is another
reason for the tardy release.
But competing with the Big Game Chappie
for prominence Friday morning will be the Big
Game Daily. The biggest issue of the quarter,
it will include ten pages of colorful stories about
everything you might want to read about on a
Friday morning. And there is no increase in
price either.
