The Editor, Sir:
The action taken by the representatives of
the various living groups to drop plans for the
Big Game Parade in order that time and energy
which would be consumed in building floats
might be turned to war work is highly com
mended. The man-power hours thus released
should do a lot of good war work. The writer
sincerely hopes that "war work" was not mere
ly used as a subterfuge by those who were
merely too lazy to do a little work and round
up a wagon for a float. May Friday's Daily re
port many tons of beets saved by those who
made up the float committees of the living
groups represented!

The Editor, Sir:
As a student I have been annually disgusted
at the showing of our team in the Big Game.
Why is it that Cal manages to outfight us and
beat us regardless of which is the better team?
We have lost five of the last six Big Games—
the one Stanford victory being that of the 1940
season, and even that one was close. Stanford
players invariably display a disinterested atti
tude and fail to become aroused, while Cal al
ways seems to rise to the heights for this game.
(The classic example of this was last year's
debacle.)
Ten or twenty years ago, especially during
Warner's regime, the Big Game really meant
something to the Stanford players. Then it was
one of the sole ambitions of each and every
player to wax Cal—refer you to about 1924 or
25 when we scored two touchdowns in the last
minute of play to tie the Bears, 20-20.
This season we again, as last year, have a
good chance of defeating Cal. Why can't we
snap out of our lethargy and not only beat them
but virtually knock the hell out of 'em? Where
is the real spirit of Stanford?

one of the sole ambitions of each and every
player to wax Cal—refer you to about 1924 or
25 when we scored two touchdowns in the last
minute of play to tie the Bears, 20-20.
This season we again, as last year, have a
good chance of defeating Cal. Why can't we
snap out of our lethargy and not only beat them
but virtually knock the hell out of 'em? Where
is the real spirit of Stanford?
