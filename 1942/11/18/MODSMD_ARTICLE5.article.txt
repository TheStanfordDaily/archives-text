# Parade for Cal Game Canceled
## 
### 
Voting to call off the Big Game
Parade and to leave the arrangement
of substitute war work to the War
Board, representatives of campus
men's organizations met yesterday
afternoon to decide whether or not
to follow the action of Women's Con
ference in deciding not to partici
pate in the parade.
After the women had decided to
devote the time to the Red Cross and
War Board workrooms instead of
preparing floats, a meeting was
called by Jim Mcßrier, Rallycom
chairman, to decide whether the men
wished to carry on alone.
MOTION CARRIED
Although some of those at the
meeting protested at sacrificing a
traditional event without being sure
it would be replaced by worthwhile
activity, the motion to cancel the
parade carried by a 15-10 vote.
When the question came up as to
what war work the men could do in
the time that would have been taken
by the parade, Ben Miller suggested
they whitewash and clean the work
room where the women are rolling
bandages and making USO kits. He
called its present condition, "ratty
from the word go."
MILLER IN AGAIN
A scrap drive was also suggested,
but it was decided that it should not
be held during Big Game Week as
it required more time and organiza
tion. Both Miller's idea and the scrap
drive suggestion will be referred to
the War Board, which will call upon
the men whenever they decide to use
them.
"Although the Big Game Parade
will not be held, students will have
plenty of opportunity to show that
Stanford spirit by using the time
saved constructively and by turning
outenthusiastically for the big rally
Thursday night," Mcßrier said in
commenting on the decision.
