Mr. Sievers stated that one part in
the play is still open—that of a Ger
man dachshund. Tryoutees for the
part are still wanted, but since there
are several barking cues, a talented
actor must fill this spot.
"This play is not a war tragedy or
heavy piece," commented Mr. Siev
ers," but a delightful comedy of a
very human family, who face the
London blitz by keeping their sense
of humor."
