WASHINGTON, Nov. 17 (UP).
President Roosevelt today pro
claimed as a major victory the bril
liant American naval triumph over
the Japs at Guadalcanalâ€”a tribute
joined in by Admiral Ernest J.
King, commander-in-chief of the
fleet, who sent messages of con
gratulation to all naval forces in the
Southwest Pacific.
The President made a brief state
ment at his press conference after
Secretary of the Navy Frank Knox
had declared U.S. forces were in
complete control at Guadalcanal
but cautioned that the Japs will
be back. Knox said "we are mak
ing plans" accordingly.
"We can lick 'em again," Knox
told reporters. "I won't say in what
action or when, but we will."
