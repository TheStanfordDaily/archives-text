"The Aircraft Warning System gives a single plane on ground
alert the equivalent striking power of 16 planes on air patrol.*'
This startling statement comes from England.
Our country's Aircraft Warning Service — quite similar to
England's — keeps a constant check on the flight of all aircraft.
Should the need arise, it is prepared to send fighter pianos aloft,
to mobilize and direct ground defense forces, to warn endangered
areas. Every step in its operation requires tin; fast, accurate
communication of the telephone.
This is just one of the many wartime johs that are keeping
telephone lines busier than ever before. To help us keep lines
clear for vital military and industrial calls, please avoid u>in»
Long Distance to war activity centers unless the call is urgent. And
please keep all your telephone calls as brief as you can. Thank \ ou.
