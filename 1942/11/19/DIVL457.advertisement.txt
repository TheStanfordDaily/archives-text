Cash is a dangerous companion. Ir tempts thieves or it
may be lost.
It is both wise and inexpensive to turn this cash into
AMERICAN EXPRESS TRAVELERS CHEQUES. Then
if these Cheques are misplaced or stolen (bef ore you have
affixed your identification signature) their value is re
funded to you.
You spend them as you do cash. They remain good so
long as you carry them around unspent.
You can buy them at Ranks and Railway Express offices.
They cost 75£ for each $100.00.
