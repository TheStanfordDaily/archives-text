## Boat Club's Proposal Unanimously Passed At Excom Meeting 
### JOHN HORRALL 
Crew was unanimously granted
Circle "S" status by Excom last
night.
The motion, as proposed by Don
Dillon, carried with it the reserva
tion that requirements for a Circle
"S" be submitted to Excom next

School of Health; Dave Doud, pres
ident of the Circle "S" Society, and
Al Masters, graduate manager of
the 8.A.C., representatives of the
Stanford Boat Club Bob Hampton
and Bud Clary told Excom that
crew participants have received
little recognition in the past.
"For many hours of work a week,
we receive merely one unit of gym

Crew was unanimously granted
Circle "S" status by Excom last

The motion, as proposed by Don
Dillon, carried with it the reserva
tion that requirements for a Circle
"S" be submitted to Excom next

.In a well-organized proposal,
which carried with it the support

ident of the Circle "S" Society, and
Al Masters, graduate manager of
the 8.A.C., representatives of the
