WASHINGTON, Nov. 18 (U.R) —
Registration of all youths who have
attained the age of 13 since July 1
was ordered by President Roosevelt
today as Selective Service Director
Lewis B. Hershey cleared the way
for induction—probably within 40 or
60 days—of 'teen-agers already en
rolled.
NEXT REGISTRATIONS
The next registration, the sixth
ordered by Mr. Roosevelt, will be
the first since Congress authorized
the drafting of 18 and 19 year olds
for military service. It will be
spread over the last three weeks of
December, following this schedule:
Dec. 11-17—Youths born between
July 1, 1924, and Aug. 31, 1924.
Dec. 18-24—Those bom between
Sept. 1, 1924, and Oct. 31, 1924.
Dec. 26-31—Those born between
Nov. 1, 1924, and Dec. 31, 1924.
The executive order also provides
for continued registration of youths
attaining their 18th birthday after
the first of next year. They will be
enrolled on their birthdays.
HERSIIEY'S MACHINERY
Hershey, moving to set in motion
machinery of the new 'teen-age draft
law signed by the President only last
Friday, issued directives to state se
lective service headquarters to guide
local draft boards in carrying out its
provisions. He ordered:
Distribution of questionnaires to
18 and 19 year olds who will be called
up according to their birthdays, ob
viating a national lottery.
Deferment of high school students
on request if they are in the last
half of the autumn-to-spring school
year.
