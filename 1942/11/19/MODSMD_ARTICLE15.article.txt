# Rally-Goers to Win Free Ball Ducats
## 
### 
"Tickets are going rapidly for the
Big Game dance, the "Red and
White Ball,'' Ted Eberle, chairman
of the dance, stated yesterday, "but
those that turn out for the Rally to
night will have the unique chance of
getting free tickets. Those that are
not quite so lucky better purchase
them quickly." Eberle pointed out
that Pot-O-Gold method of giving
away the free tickets tonight will
give every person at the Rally a
chance to win a free trip to the
dance.
The dance, to be held Saturday
evening from 9 to 1 o'clock in the
Women's Gym will feature the music
of Gary Nottingham's daticeable
band.
