# Gaieties Dancing Creations Sparkle With New Rhythm
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
The atmosphere was as businesslike as a hilarious show will permit at
the Memorial Auditorium last night as the Big Game Gaieties of 1942
rolled into nearly the last rehearsal period before the opening Friday.
Bigwigs of the production were getting quite a work-out, efficiently
handling a huge cast and grinding remarkable talent from an all-student
1 j 4.show.

Jacques Poloy Ogg, composer and
director of the dance numbers, was
cornered for a moment and Rave a
little advance infoimation on her
dance creations and crew.
Something new and different in
this year's Gaieties is a polka, a def
inite folk dance, turning out to be
tremendously effective in a musical.
The exciting rhythm and speed of
the music, getting away from swing
fits well into the show, although no
self-respecting peasant would be
caught in the modern interpretation.
Dancing in the number are Maria
Real, Julius Buckler, Gloria Kellogg,
Bob Phillips, Sam Knowles, Lottie
Martins, Ken Jones, Millie Turnbull,
A1 Cleveland, Luana Forkner, Jo
anne Benedict, and A1 Miosi.
VARIED RHYTHMS
The other character dance ac
companies the song, "Do I." Music
is played in different rhythms
waltz, conga, schuplattler, bolero,
and jive—which arc variations on
the same theme, creating a montage
effect of dancing.
In "Do I" are Jacques Poley Ogg,
Dick Ogg, Margaret Rcpetto, Carl
Spangenberg, Jean Johnstone, Sam
Knowles, Virginia Claggett, Al
Cleveland, Maria Real, and Julius
Buckler.
The other two dances follow a
strictly modern vein, modified only
as stage compositions, and were
composed by Mrs. Ogg.
"The Morocco number, danced to
the music 'Sundown,' is the wiggly,
poury, ripply typo, swinging lovely
bodies in the twilight," she re
marked. "with definite modern dance
technique built into musical comedy
medium instead of continuous mod
ern jive."
MOROCCO DANCERS

bard. Gerry Lloyd, Gloria Olivi, and

Martins, Ken Jones, Millie Turnbull,
A1 Cleveland, Luana Forkner, Jo
anne Benedict, and A1 Miosi.
VARIED RHYTHMS
The other character dance ac
companies the song, "Do I." Music
is played in different rhythms
waltz, conga, schuplattler, bolero,
and jive—which arc variations on
the same theme, creating a montage
effect of dancing.
In "Do I" are Jacques Poley Ogg,
Dick Ogg, Margaret Rcpetto, Carl
Spangenberg, Jean Johnstone, Sam
Knowles, Virginia Claggett, Al
Cleveland, Maria Real, and Julius
Buckler.
The other two dances follow a
strictly modern vein, modified only
as stage compositions, and were
composed by Mrs. Ogg.
"The Morocco number, danced to
the music 'Sundown,' is the wiggly,
poury, ripply typo, swinging lovely
bodies in the twilight," she re
marked. "with definite modern dance
technique built into musical comedy
medium instead of continuous mod
ern jive."
MOROCCO DANCERS
Dancing in the Morocco number
arc Joyce Glassman, Johnny Hub
bard. Gerry Lloyd, Gloria Olivi, and
Jeanice Shaughnessy.
In the "Lockout Blues," a singer
dancer number, arc Charlotte Cecil,
Mary Buckner, Nancy Dole, Shepley
Nourso, Louise Kaiser, and Jeanice
Shaughnessy.
The atmosphere was as businesslike as a hilarious show will permit at
the Memorial Auditorium last night as the Big Game Gaieties of 1942
rolled into nearly the last rehearsal period before the opening Friday.
Bigwigs of the production were getting quite a work-out, efficiently
handling a huge cast and grinding remarkable talent from an all-student
1 j 4.show.

Jacques Poloy Ogg, composer and
director of the dance numbers, was
cornered for a moment and Rave a
little advance infoimation on her
dance creations and crew.
Something new and different in
this year's Gaieties is a polka, a def
inite folk dance, turning out to be
tremendously effective in a musical.
The exciting rhythm and speed of
the music, getting away from swing
fits well into the show, although no
self-respecting peasant would be
caught in the modern interpretation.
Dancing in the number are Maria
Real, Julius Buckler, Gloria Kellogg,
Bob Phillips, Sam Knowles, Lottie
Martins, Ken Jones, Millie Turnbull,
A1 Cleveland, Luana Forkner, Jo
anne Benedict, and A1 Miosi.
