ALLIED NORTH A FRICAN
HEADQUARTERS, Nov. IK (U.R>â€”
I Ameri c a n, British, a n d French
troops are sweeping in force across
the border from Algeria into Tunisia,
i and seized Tunisian airdromes are
being consolidated rapidly, it was
revealed tonight.
It was evident the drive into Tu
nisia was in full swing although there
was as yet no indication as to how
many miles it had penetrated.
But there was every indication
that the land forces were driving
swiftly into the French protectorate,
buffer between the Allies and Ital
ian Libya.
PARATROOPS GET AIRPORTS
Parachute troops had blazed the
way with sudden descents on stra
tegic Tunisian airdromes, and their
success was attested by the dis
closure that, footholds at those points
were being strengthened steadily.
Headquarters sources neither con -
firmed nor denied unofficial reports
that Marshal Erwin Rommel, chief
of the Afrika Korps driven out. of
Egypt, was in Tunisia to direct Axis
resistance against the Allied onrush.
Thousands upon thousands of
French North African troops were
revealed to have joined the Allies
in the grand march on Tunisia.
The army was bent on putting out
of action the not more than 10,000
German and Italian troops in Tunisia
and sweeping on to Italian Tripoli
tania.
The march probably was the
greatest display of American-French
solidarity since Armistice Day of the
First World War.
Throughout the entire North Af
rican coastal area bands played
American and French war songs,
and once again throaty voices chant
ed "The Yanks are coming . . . we
won't be back till it's over over
there."
French enthusiasm rivaled that of
the Americans. For them the word
was "We're off to the fight again."
THRUST INTO TUNISIA
Indications were that the main
thrusts into Tunisia were aimed
along the coast and into the middle
of the protectorate. At the same
time strong forces on the southern
flank were believed pushing east
ward as rapidly as possible in an
effort to reach the sea and trap the
Axis garrisons from the west, south
west, and southeast.
Meanwhile a relentless U-boat
chase was going on day and nighl by
air and sea, the Allied patrols achiev
| ing repeated successes.
