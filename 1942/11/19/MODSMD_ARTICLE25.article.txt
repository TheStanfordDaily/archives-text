PLAY REVIEWED
In a review of the play appearing
in The Stanford Daily for July 213.
1942, it was said:
" 'Daisies on the Cartracks' is
excellent light entertainment, well
written and well acted. It doesn't
pretend to solve any big problems,
but it does present its story of the
difficulties of a small town family
in a fast-moving laugh-crammed
comedy, which is all that is asked of
it."
