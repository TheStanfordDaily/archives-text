# Argentine Acts To Suppress Axis Activities
## U.S. Federal Report Results in Sweeping Investigation, Arrests 
### 
BUENOS AIRES. Nov. 13 (U.R)â€”
The Argentine government, which
still maintains diplomatic relations
with Germany, Italy, and Japan, to
day ordered a nationwide cleanup of
Axis espionage and propaganda ac
tivities.
Minister of Interior Miguel Cula
ciati sent recommendations to the
governors of all provinces urging
suppression of activities of foreigners
and foreign-inspired groups. The
recommendation was sent out 15
days after the United States had
submitted to Argentina the first of
three memoranda on the work of
Axis spies in Argentina based on
information collected by U.S. Secret
Service men, the Federal Communi
cations Commission and other
agencies.
Foreign Minister Enrique Ruiz
Guinazu revealed last week that a
sweeping investigation was under
way as a result of the United States
report, and it was reported that
about 40 persons, suspected of es
pionage, had been arrested within
the last fortnight.
Culaciati's notes today, however,
contained the first concrete indica
tion that the Argentine government
had found evidence justifying the
statements by Under-Secretary of
State Sumner Welles that Argen
tina was used as a base for Axis es
pionage against other American re
publics.
Culaciati's note urged "intensifi
cation of repression of all activities
designed to propagate political ex
tremists or foreign infiltrations con
trary to the political institutions of
the American Republics, and in ac
cordance with recommendations of
recent inter-American conferences."
