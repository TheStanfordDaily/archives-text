### 
AKRON. 0., Nov. 18 (U.R)â€”A pre
maturely born 14-ounce baby girl,
who lived for four days under vigi
lant care, died tonight at Children's
Hospital where she had been fed
with an eye dropper every two
hours. She gained no weight during
her short life.
The baby was born at five and a
half months to Mrs. John Twynham,
the 23-year-old wife of a truck
driver, last Saturday. The birth of
the child, who was no larger than a
small doll, was unattended. She was
kept alive on a hot water bottle until
she was removed to the hospital last
night.
