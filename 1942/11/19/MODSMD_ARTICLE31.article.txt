# Team Spirit High for Big Game as Schwartz Gives Varsity Fast Workout
## 
### 
Stanford's (cam spirit reached a new high this season during yester
day's workout in preparation for this Saturday's California-Stanford
IJig Game at the California Memorial Stadium.
the Indians ran through their plays on offensive dummy scrimmage
fast and accurately, with flawless Imll-handling. Several members of the

"knot - hole gang" who
watched practices all season con- [
curred in claiming that yesterday's
workout was the team's befet, and
that they had never seen such j
spirit.
Coach Marchy Schwartz used
Ray "Duke" Hammett at quarter- |
back, Ross Dana and Willard
"Rock" Shellcr at halves, and Ran
dall "Buck" Fawcett at fullback in
the first unit. Bobbie Andrews
quarterbacked the second unit, with I
Fred Sanderman and Don Zappet
tini at halves and Art Shipkey at j
full.
I'ASS DEFENSE
The varsity went through a pass I
defense drill against the frosh, I

The Golden Bears wound up their

Game here Saturday against

pretty good hut the reserves were
weak.

sity ran through offensive forma
tions.
Hammett was showing the same
brilliant passing that has made him
the Coast's outstanding passer, and
the type of passing that led to wins
over the University of Washington
and Oregon State. Bobbie Andrews
worked with the second unit, and
he too was throwing well.
Fawcett was running at top speed
in his fullback spot, and is ready to
turn in his season's best perfor
mance this Saturday.
TAYLOR NURSES COLD
The team was at full strength,
save for Charles "Chuck" Taylor,
Stanford's All-American candidate,
who spent the day and night at the
Rest Home nursing a cold. Dave
Patterson was showing lots of fight
in taking over the left guard as
signment.
In the pass defense drill, only the
defensive backfield men partici
pated, while the whole frosh team
opposed them. Freshman quarter
back Jack Brownson, hailed last
year as the nation's outstanding
prep passer, was completing about
five out of six of his throws—main
ly to speedy left half Lloyd Merri
man. However, since no one was
rushing Brownson, he had lots of
time to pick out his receivers, and
could take lots of time in passing.
Tonight the frosh will run Bear
plays against the entire varsity
squad.
