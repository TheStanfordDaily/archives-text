# War-to-War Big Games Highlight Farm History
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Dink Templeton. one of the Farm's all-time all-mightys, kicked a 50-
yard field goal to open the scoring on a November afternoon in 1919 as
California and Stanford men came home from World War I to open a new
era in the history of Bin Games.
On that 1919 afternoon the story of the really BIG Big (lames was begun

dismally for Stanford. Cal was
heavy favorite, and the field goal
was soon matched by the rambles of
the great "Dummy' Wells and Deeds
j who made it 14-3.
Cal's powerhouse of 1920 which
j later beat Ohio State in the Rose
: Bowl, 28-0, murdered Stanford,
38-0. It was the first of the
i Wonder Teams built around Berky,
Muller ("The Brick") and Toomy.
NEW STADIUM
1921 — Stanford opened the new
stadium that no one thought could
be filled, and an unbelievable 50.00U
persons filed down the Peninsula to
watch the Wonder Team wax Stan
ford, 42-7. But Art Wilcox and Jack
Patrick maintained our honor by
! christening the stadium with a touch
down drive in the first quarter.
While Cal was catching up with
Memorial Stadium in embryo form,
the Golden Bears came down to
Paly again in 1922. It was the last
appearance „t great Brick Muller
and he made the most of it . . . 28-U
' for Cal. .
Babe Horrell, now U.C.L.A. coach,
blocked Ernie Nevers' punt behind
goal for the keynote of a 9-0 Cal
victory in 1923, despite Nevers ram-
I page of 84 yards that came in the
fading minutes to tell ot better times
to come.
POP COMES WEST
For out of the East came Glenn
Set)bey Warner.
It's 1921. the Big Game of all Big
Games. Pop Warner is facing a
heavily favored Cal team, and Cal
is leading 20-6 in the last minutes of
quarter four. Our present Art Ship
key's Uncle Theodore turns up m
the end zone to collect one scoring
pass. The people who had already
started to leave sit down, fast. Right
back again are Stanford's Ed Walker-
Murray Cuddeback combination for
another six points. And then Cudde
back calmly converts the 20th point
that ties Cal. Said Glenn Scohey
Warner, "It will be a long time be
fore California wins another Big
Game."
And he was right! In 1925 Ernie
Nevers utterly smashed the Bears,
27-14, and in 1926 "Tricky Dick" Hy
land scored on a 53-yard run off the
first Card scrimmage play. Final:
Stanford 41, California 6.
GOING ROUGHER
In 1927 the going was getting
rougher for the "Old Fox" and his
charges, but "Tricky Dick and Biff
(.Hoffman pulled a sneak play—the
i famous "bootlegger" or "ball-behind
| the-leg-sneak"—which won out 13-
i 6 for the waving Cardinal.
1928—Still tougher. Cal is leading
i 13-7 with 30 seconds to go when the
, Card huddle dreams up a miracle
■ play that puts Lud Frentup in the
i end zone for a 13-13 tie pass. In
! 1929, the Indians are leading 14-6
| when the referee boots tackle Art
! man, making the Sons of the Red so
| mad that they surge down the field
! for a 62-yard, 9-play drive that
I scores, topping Cal 21-6. Moffett,
I Hillman, Smalling, and Caglieri
| functioned plus.
In 1930. after a 41-0 whipping by
Warner's Cards, Nibs Pruce gave up
the ghost of Cal to wily Bill Ingram,
j which was bad medicine.
Rusty Gill and Hank Schalbach

1 licked Stanford for the first time in
eight tries this year, 6-0. In 1932,
| Stan Anderson booted from behind
' his end zone a 73-yard kick that
! helped gain a 0-0 tie.
"Owl Eyes" Alusti/.a "just hap
i pened to see" Card end Norgaard
clear for a touchdown throw after
Stanford had been liberally pushed
around in 15/33. Cal already had a
field goal, and they popped right
i back for what looked like a cinch
I score. But the touchdown pass,
rifling for home, was intercepted by
"Bones" Hamilton who cruised out
to safety on the 50. Stanford 7. Cal
3. The first of the VOW TEAMS had
come through.
In 1934 with Moscrip and Grayson
out, Hamilton and Carl Schott beat
' Cal, 9-7. Schott had to boot a 23-
| yard field goal.
LAST OF VOW BOYS
Cal, in 1935, had won nine straight
until Bobby Grayson and Jimmy
Coffis crushed through Berkeley's
| "invincible" forward wall for an 80-
yard drive. Stanford won 13-0.
1936—The Vow Boys are gone
I from Stanford land. Cal 20. Stan
ford 0.
| 1937—Cal has Bottari, Chapman,
i and Meek. Cal 13, Stanford 0.
1938—Stanford kicks Cal around
from the underdog spot for three
quarters, but Bottari-Reginato have
one touchdown pass ready. Cal 6,
j Stanford 0.
1939—Cal walks away, 32-14, and
"Tiny" Thornhill is through.
Then the win-hungry Stanfordites
i found a new Warner-like leader,
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy. Rags be
came riches. Frank Culling Albert,
Hugh Gallarneau, Pete Kmctovic,
and Norm Standlce, we think, were
the greatest of all Stanford backs
collected at any one time. For 58.
then 35, then at will they trampled
through the Cal line. Jim Jurlcovich
was out of that game, as he saw his
teammates beaten 13-6. Bob Rein
hard also rode the bench.
Last year, if you will remember,
Bob Reinhard settled his score with
the "T".
Saturday. Big Game 1942 brings
Jim Jurkovich in a long-awaited
meeting with the men of (he "T".
You'll be there.

LAST OF VOW BOYS
Cal, in 1935, had won nine straight
until Bobby Grayson and Jimmy
Coffis crushed through Berkeley's

yard drive. Stanford won 13-0.
1936—The Vow Boys are gone
I from Stanford land. Cal 20. Stan

1938—Stanford kicks Cal around
from the underdog spot for three
quarters, but Bottari-Reginato have
one touchdown pass ready. Cal 6,
j Stanford 0.
1939—Cal walks away, 32-14, and
"Tiny" Thornhill is through.
Then the win-hungry Stanfordites
i found a new Warner-like leader,
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy. Rags be
came riches. Frank Culling Albert,
Hugh Gallarneau, Pete Kmctovic,
and Norm Standlce, we think, were
the greatest of all Stanford backs
collected at any one time. For 58.
then 35, then at will they trampled
through the Cal line. Jim Jurlcovich
was out of that game, as he saw his
teammates beaten 13-6. Bob Rein

Dink Templeton. one of the Farm's all-time all-mightys, kicked a 50-
yard field goal to open the scoring on a November afternoon in 1919 as
California and Stanford men came home from World War I to open a new
era in the history of Bin Games.
On that 1919 afternoon the story of the really BIG Big (lames was begun

dismally for Stanford. Cal was
heavy favorite, and the field goal
was soon matched by the rambles of
the great "Dummy' Wells and Deeds
j who made it 14-3.
Cal's powerhouse of 1920 which
j later beat Ohio State in the Rose
: Bowl, 28-0, murdered Stanford,
38-0. It was the first of the
i Wonder Teams built around Berky,
Muller ("The Brick") and Toomy.
NEW STADIUM
1921 — Stanford opened the new
stadium that no one thought could
be filled, and an unbelievable 50.00U
persons filed down the Peninsula to
watch the Wonder Team wax Stan
ford, 42-7. But Art Wilcox and Jack
Patrick maintained our honor by
! christening the stadium with a touch
down drive in the first quarter.
While Cal was catching up with
Memorial Stadium in embryo form,
the Golden Bears came down to
Paly again in 1922. It was the last
appearance „t great Brick Muller
and he made the most of it . . . 28-U
' for Cal. .
Babe Horrell, now U.C.L.A. coach,
blocked Ernie Nevers' punt behind
goal for the keynote of a 9-0 Cal
victory in 1923, despite Nevers ram-
I page of 84 yards that came in the
fading minutes to tell ot better times
to come.
POP COMES WEST
For out of the East came Glenn
Set)bey Warner.
It's 1921. the Big Game of all Big
Games. Pop Warner is facing a
heavily favored Cal team, and Cal
is leading 20-6 in the last minutes of
quarter four. Our present Art Ship
key's Uncle Theodore turns up m
the end zone to collect one scoring
pass. The people who had already
started to leave sit down, fast. Right
back again are Stanford's Ed Walker-
Murray Cuddeback combination for
another six points. And then Cudde
back calmly converts the 20th point
that ties Cal. Said Glenn Scohey
Warner, "It will be a long time be
fore California wins another Big
Game."
And he was right! In 1925 Ernie
Nevers utterly smashed the Bears,
27-14, and in 1926 "Tricky Dick" Hy
land scored on a 53-yard run off the
first Card scrimmage play. Final:
Stanford 41, California 6.
GOING ROUGHER
In 1927 the going was getting
rougher for the "Old Fox" and his
charges, but "Tricky Dick and Biff
(.Hoffman pulled a sneak play—the
i famous "bootlegger" or "ball-behind
| the-leg-sneak"—which won out 13-
i 6 for the waving Cardinal.
1928—Still tougher. Cal is leading
i 13-7 with 30 seconds to go when the
, Card huddle dreams up a miracle
■ play that puts Lud Frentup in the
i end zone for a 13-13 tie pass. In
! 1929, the Indians are leading 14-6
| when the referee boots tackle Art
! man, making the Sons of the Red so
| mad that they surge down the field
! for a 62-yard, 9-play drive that
I scores, topping Cal 21-6. Moffett,
I Hillman, Smalling, and Caglieri
| functioned plus.
In 1930. after a 41-0 whipping by
Warner's Cards, Nibs Pruce gave up
the ghost of Cal to wily Bill Ingram,
j which was bad medicine.
Rusty Gill and Hank Schalbach

1 licked Stanford for the first time in

' his end zone a 73-yard kick that
! helped gain a 0-0 tie.

California and Stanford men came home from World War I to open a new

On that 1919 afternoon the story of the really BIG Big (lames was begun

the end zone to collect one scoring
pass. The people who had already

back again are Stanford's Ed Walker-

another six points. And then Cudde
back calmly converts the 20th point
that ties Cal. Said Glenn Scohey
Warner, "It will be a long time be

And he was right! In 1925 Ernie

Memorial Stadium in embryo form,
the Golden Bears came down to
Paly again in 1922. It was the last
appearance „t great Brick Muller
and he made the most of it . . . 28-U
' for Cal. .
Babe Horrell, now U.C.L.A. coach,
blocked Ernie Nevers' punt behind
goal for the keynote of a 9-0 Cal
victory in 1923, despite Nevers ram-
I page of 84 yards that came in the
fading minutes to tell ot better times
to come.
POP COMES WEST
For out of the East came Glenn
Set)bey Warner.
It's 1921. the Big Game of all Big
Games. Pop Warner is facing a
heavily favored Cal team, and Cal
is leading 20-6 in the last minutes of
quarter four. Our present Art Ship
key's Uncle Theodore turns up m
the end zone to collect one scoring
pass. The people who had already
started to leave sit down, fast. Right
back again are Stanford's Ed Walker-
Murray Cuddeback combination for
another six points. And then Cudde
back calmly converts the 20th point
that ties Cal. Said Glenn Scohey
Warner, "It will be a long time be
fore California wins another Big
Game."
And he was right! In 1925 Ernie
Nevers utterly smashed the Bears,
27-14, and in 1926 "Tricky Dick" Hy
land scored on a 53-yard run off the
first Card scrimmage play. Final:
Stanford 41, California 6.
GOING ROUGHER
In 1927 the going was getting
rougher for the "Old Fox" and his
charges, but "Tricky Dick and Biff
(.Hoffman pulled a sneak play—the
i famous "bootlegger" or "ball-behind
| the-leg-sneak"—which won out 13-
i 6 for the waving Cardinal.
1928—Still tougher. Cal is leading
i 13-7 with 30 seconds to go when the
, Card huddle dreams up a miracle
■ play that puts Lud Frentup in the
i end zone for a 13-13 tie pass. In
! 1929, the Indians are leading 14-6
| when the referee boots tackle Art
! man, making the Sons of the Red so
| mad that they surge down the field
! for a 62-yard, 9-play drive that
I scores, topping Cal 21-6. Moffett,
I Hillman, Smalling, and Caglieri
| functioned plus.
In 1930. after a 41-0 whipping by
Warner's Cards, Nibs Pruce gave up
the ghost of Cal to wily Bill Ingram,
j which was bad medicine.
Rusty Gill and Hank Schalbach

1 licked Stanford for the first time in
eight tries this year, 6-0. In 1932,
| Stan Anderson booted from behind
' his end zone a 73-yard kick that
! helped gain a 0-0 tie.
"Owl Eyes" Alusti/.a "just hap
i pened to see" Card end Norgaard
clear for a touchdown throw after
Stanford had been liberally pushed
around in 15/33. Cal already had a
field goal, and they popped right
i back for what looked like a cinch
I score. But the touchdown pass,
rifling for home, was intercepted by
"Bones" Hamilton who cruised out
to safety on the 50. Stanford 7. Cal
3. The first of the VOW TEAMS had
come through.
In 1934 with Moscrip and Grayson
out, Hamilton and Carl Schott beat
' Cal, 9-7. Schott had to boot a 23-
| yard field goal.
LAST OF VOW BOYS
Cal, in 1935, had won nine straight
until Bobby Grayson and Jimmy
Coffis crushed through Berkeley's
| "invincible" forward wall for an 80-
yard drive. Stanford won 13-0.
1936—The Vow Boys are gone
I from Stanford land. Cal 20. Stan
ford 0.
| 1937—Cal has Bottari, Chapman,
i and Meek. Cal 13, Stanford 0.
1938—Stanford kicks Cal around
from the underdog spot for three
quarters, but Bottari-Reginato have
one touchdown pass ready. Cal 6,
j Stanford 0.
1939—Cal walks away, 32-14, and
"Tiny" Thornhill is through.
Then the win-hungry Stanfordites
i found a new Warner-like leader,
Clark Daniel Shaughnessy. Rags be
came riches. Frank Culling Albert,
Hugh Gallarneau, Pete Kmctovic,
and Norm Standlce, we think, were
the greatest of all Stanford backs
collected at any one time. For 58.
then 35, then at will they trampled
through the Cal line. Jim Jurlcovich
was out of that game, as he saw his
teammates beaten 13-6. Bob Rein
hard also rode the bench.
Last year, if you will remember,
Bob Reinhard settled his score with
the "T".
Saturday. Big Game 1942 brings
Jim Jurkovich in a long-awaited
meeting with the men of (he "T".
You'll be there.
Dink Templeton. one of the Farm's all-time all-mightys, kicked a 50-
yard field goal to open the scoring on a November afternoon in 1919 as
California and Stanford men came home from World War I to open a new
era in the history of Bin Games.
On that 1919 afternoon the story of the really BIG Big (lames was begun

dismally for Stanford. Cal was
heavy favorite, and the field goal
was soon matched by the rambles of
the great "Dummy' Wells and Deeds
j who made it 14-3.
Cal's powerhouse of 1920 which
j later beat Ohio State in the Rose
: Bowl, 28-0, murdered Stanford,
38-0. It was the first of the
i Wonder Teams built around Berky,
Muller ("The Brick") and Toomy.
NEW STADIUM
1921 — Stanford opened the new
stadium that no one thought could
be filled, and an unbelievable 50.00U
persons filed down the Peninsula to
