# Let's Be Sensible

IN past editorials The Daily has tried to point
out ways in which the drafting of the youth
of America can be done in a sensible way.
The following is a condensation of the British
system in reference to students 18 years old
and up.
On several points, British manpower control
is in contrast with ours. For example, the Amer
ican practice of decentralizing draft authority
to local boards is the opposite from Britain's.
British practice vests the drafting power in a
central office, the Ministry of Labor and Na
tional Service, under a uniform general policy,
but leaves to local committees authority to pass
on hardship cases under that general policy.
The ministry is responsible not only for sup
plying men (and now women) to the armed
services and to industry, but also for retaining
in their civilian employment those who, in the
national interest, ought to be retained. Under
this policy the British universities are offically
recognized as essential training mechanisms for
the nation's war effort, and their function in edu
cation and research is clearly defined and rigor
ously supported.
In Britain, when a boy reaches the age of IBV2
years he is liable for service, and on the first
appointed day thereafter registers at the local
office of the Ministry of Labor and National
Service. If he has begun his university course,
or has been accepted by a university for admis
sion, he records that fact on his registration
form.
He also indicates the nature of his course—
whether it is in the arts, science and technology,
or medicine. The ministry checks his state
ment with the university, and on confirmation
treats him according to the established rules
for each category of student. It is the university
and no one else that decides who are to become
students, and the normal procedures for selec
tion and admission are still in operation.
If he is a student of arts—including the lib
eral arts, law, theology, commerce, social sci
ences, music, and architecture—he is allowed
to remain in the university for one academic
year. If he has already had a year, he is granted
no further deferment.
If he is a scientific or technological student—
in agriculture, biology, chemistry, engineering,
forestry, geology, mathematics, metallurgy, na
val architecture, or physics—his case is passed
on by a joint recruiting board. If this board
finds that the student is likely to make good in
his subject, and so certifies, he is held at the
university until he completes his course. His
case is reviewed at intervals of six months, and
if any of these check-ups show his university
marks to be unsatisfactory, the man is imme
diately called up for service.
Each university has its joint recruiting board,
of which a university representative is chair
man with members, generally retired officers,
representing the army, the navy, and the air
service. This is also a subcommittee for each
of the recognized fields of science and tech
nology, and it is these committees that recom
mend which are to be retained. When the
student comes to the end of his course, which
ordinarily does not take more than three years,
the joint recruiting board interviews him and
discusses with him his future service.
It then sends to the central office of the min
istry a report giving its recommendation as to
how best the man can be used. Final responsi
bility for assigning these trained scientific and
technical men, whether to industry or to the
forces, rests with this central office of the min
istry.
There is still another category, the medical
students. If the draft registrant is already ac
cepted by a medical school, there is no special
procedure. When the medical school certifies
that he is a student, the registrant's papers are
placed in a special file. Every six months the
school renders a report to the ministry, and so
long as the report says "satisfactory" he re
mains. The routine here covers a five-year
course which a student ordinarily enters upon
at age 18.

It has not been necessary to give any insignia
to men retained in the British universities. The
public knows that all citizens are at the dispo
sition of the Ministry of Labor and Natonal Serv
ice, assumes that all are in service according to
its uniform general policy, therefore there is no
question asked as to why a young man is in
civilian clothes.

of the recognized fields of science and tech
nology, and it is these committees that recom
mend which are to be retained. When the
student comes to the end of his course, which
ordinarily does not take more than three years,
the joint recruiting board interviews him and
discusses with him his future service.
It then sends to the central office of the min
istry a report giving its recommendation as to
how best the man can be used. Final responsi
bility for assigning these trained scientific and
technical men, whether to industry or to the
forces, rests with this central office of the min
istry.
There is still another category, the medical
students. If the draft registrant is already ac
cepted by a medical school, there is no special
procedure. When the medical school certifies
that he is a student, the registrant's papers are
placed in a special file. Every six months the
school renders a report to the ministry, and so
long as the report says "satisfactory" he re
mains. The routine here covers a five-year
course which a student ordinarily enters upon
at age 18.

It has not been necessary to give any insignia
to men retained in the British universities. The
public knows that all citizens are at the dispo
sition of the Ministry of Labor and Natonal Serv
ice, assumes that all are in service according to
its uniform general policy, therefore there is no
question asked as to why a young man is in
civilian clothes.
IN past editorials The Daily has tried to point
out ways in which the drafting of the youth
of America can be done in a sensible way.
The following is a condensation of the British
system in reference to students 18 years old
and up.
On several points, British manpower control
is in contrast with ours. For example, the Amer
ican practice of decentralizing draft authority
to local boards is the opposite from Britain's.
British practice vests the drafting power in a
central office, the Ministry of Labor and Na
tional Service, under a uniform general policy,
but leaves to local committees authority to pass
on hardship cases under that general policy.
The ministry is responsible not only for sup
plying men (and now women) to the armed
services and to industry, but also for retaining
in their civilian employment those who, in the
national interest, ought to be retained. Under
this policy the British universities are offically
recognized as essential training mechanisms for
the nation's war effort, and their function in edu
cation and research is clearly defined and rigor
ously supported.
In Britain, when a boy reaches the age of IBV2
years he is liable for service, and on the first
appointed day thereafter registers at the local
office of the Ministry of Labor and National
Service. If he has begun his university course,
or has been accepted by a university for admis
sion, he records that fact on his registration
form.
He also indicates the nature of his course—
whether it is in the arts, science and technology,
or medicine. The ministry checks his state
ment with the university, and on confirmation
treats him according to the established rules
for each category of student. It is the university
and no one else that decides who are to become
students, and the normal procedures for selec
tion and admission are still in operation.
If he is a student of arts—including the lib
eral arts, law, theology, commerce, social sci
ences, music, and architecture—he is allowed
to remain in the university for one academic
year. If he has already had a year, he is granted
no further deferment.
If he is a scientific or technological student—
in agriculture, biology, chemistry, engineering,
forestry, geology, mathematics, metallurgy, na
val architecture, or physics—his case is passed
on by a joint recruiting board. If this board
finds that the student is likely to make good in
his subject, and so certifies, he is held at the
university until he completes his course. His
case is reviewed at intervals of six months, and
if any of these check-ups show his university
marks to be unsatisfactory, the man is imme
diately called up for service.
Each university has its joint recruiting board,
of which a university representative is chair
man with members, generally retired officers,
representing the army, the navy, and the air
service. This is also a subcommittee for each
of the recognized fields of science and tech
nology, and it is these committees that recom
mend which are to be retained. When the
student comes to the end of his course, which

form.
He also indicates the nature of his course—
whether it is in the arts, science and technology,
or medicine. The ministry checks his state
ment with the university, and on confirmation
treats him according to the established rules
for each category of student. It is the university
and no one else that decides who are to become
students, and the normal procedures for selec
tion and admission are still in operation.
If he is a student of arts—including the lib
eral arts, law, theology, commerce, social sci
ences, music, and architecture—he is allowed
to remain in the university for one academic
year. If he has already had a year, he is granted
no further deferment.
If he is a scientific or technological student—
in agriculture, biology, chemistry, engineering,
forestry, geology, mathematics, metallurgy, na
val architecture, or physics—his case is passed
on by a joint recruiting board. If this board
finds that the student is likely to make good in
his subject, and so certifies, he is held at the
university until he completes his course. His
case is reviewed at intervals of six months, and
if any of these check-ups show his university
marks to be unsatisfactory, the man is imme
diately called up for service.
Each university has its joint recruiting board,
of which a university representative is chair
man with members, generally retired officers,
representing the army, the navy, and the air
service. This is also a subcommittee for each
of the recognized fields of science and tech
nology, and it is these committees that recom
mend which are to be retained. When the
student comes to the end of his course, which
ordinarily does not take more than three years,
the joint recruiting board interviews him and
discusses with him his future service.
It then sends to the central office of the min
istry a report giving its recommendation as to
how best the man can be used. Final responsi
bility for assigning these trained scientific and
technical men, whether to industry or to the
forces, rests with this central office of the min
istry.
There is still another category, the medical
students. If the draft registrant is already ac
cepted by a medical school, there is no special
procedure. When the medical school certifies
that he is a student, the registrant's papers are
placed in a special file. Every six months the
school renders a report to the ministry, and so
long as the report says "satisfactory" he re
mains. The routine here covers a five-year
course which a student ordinarily enters upon
at age 18.

It has not been necessary to give any insignia
to men retained in the British universities. The
public knows that all citizens are at the dispo
sition of the Ministry of Labor and Natonal Serv
ice, assumes that all are in service according to
its uniform general policy, therefore there is no
question asked as to why a young man is in
civilian clothes.
IN past editorials The Daily has tried to point
out ways in which the drafting of the youth
of America can be done in a sensible way.
The following is a condensation of the British
system in reference to students 18 years old
and up.
On several points, British manpower control
is in contrast with ours. For example, the Amer
ican practice of decentralizing draft authority
to local boards is the opposite from Britain's.
British practice vests the drafting power in a
central office, the Ministry of Labor and Na
tional Service, under a uniform general policy,
but leaves to local committees authority to pass
on hardship cases under that general policy.
The ministry is responsible not only for sup
plying men (and now women) to the armed
services and to industry, but also for retaining
in their civilian employment those who, in the
national interest, ought to be retained. Under
this policy the British universities are offically
recognized as essential training mechanisms for
the nation's war effort, and their function in edu
cation and research is clearly defined and rigor
ously supported.
In Britain, when a boy reaches the age of IBV2
years he is liable for service, and on the first
appointed day thereafter registers at the local
office of the Ministry of Labor and National
Service. If he has begun his university course,
or has been accepted by a university for admis
sion, he records that fact on his registration
form.

whether it is in the arts, science and technology,
or medicine. The ministry checks his state
