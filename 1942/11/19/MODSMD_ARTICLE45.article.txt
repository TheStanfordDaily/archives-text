### TED NORTON 
The United Nations' vein of good fortune
hasn't pinched out yet. We're still rolling on all
fronts. But the war isn't over yet, and the boys
won't be out of the trenches by Christmas. As
those of age 18-19 have doubtless already
gathered.
A bill was introduced in Congress the other
day which would give authority to the Presi
dent to suspend tariff and immigration laws in
the interests of the war effort for the duration.
The bill was very broadly drawn, and would
have given the President vast powers. But
power per se was not the point of Congressional
attack; verily they "strained at a gnat and swal
lowed a camel." The House refused to pass
the bill because the House or some of it likes
tariffs, and felt that this would be tantamount
to repealing the tariff and immigration laws. I
am not going to argue the tariff question here,
beyond saying that I'm against 'em. (If any
reader really wants to argue, I refer him to Pro
fessor Boggs, who'll make a good free-trader
out of him or become "inebriated with his own
verbosity" in trying.)
The argument in Congress has a larger sig
nificance than U.S. economic policy. If Con
gressmen are unwilling, even during the war, to
permit tampering with tariffs and immigration
laws, barriers to trade among nations, will they
be willing-to agree to any form of post-war in
ternational organization, which must involve
abolition of trade barriers almost by definition?
I have no poll figures at hand, but I know that
many Americans favor some form of interna
tional organization, "world state," "federal un
ion," a strengthened League of Nations, and my
advice to them is that they write their Congress
men early and often to bring their segment of
public opinion to official attention. (In this dis
trict, lohn Z. Anderson, House of Representa
tives, Washington, D.C.)

There is a real old-fashioned, knock-down,
drag-out, mud-slinging, flag-waving political
fight going on right now in the Senate. A bill
passed the House some time ago which would
abolish the poll tax as a voting requirement at
Federal elections. The Southern states have poll
taxes for the avowed reason of keeping the
negro and poor white from voting, and they are
fighting tooth and nail against what they con
sider an overdose of democracy.
Whether the bill is desirable or not, and many
people not from the South think that it is, there
is a larger question, its constitutionality. Even
if the bill passes, it will be tested in the courts.
And even if it were constitutional, it would be
almost impossible to prevent some form of re
striction. The battle will not be won on the
floors of Congress.

There is a real old-fashioned, knock-down,
drag-out, mud-slinging, flag-waving political
fight going on right now in the Senate. A bill
passed the House some time ago which would
abolish the poll tax as a voting requirement at
Federal elections. The Southern states have poll
taxes for the avowed reason of keeping the
negro and poor white from voting, and they are
fighting tooth and nail against what they con
sider an overdose of democracy.
Whether the bill is desirable or not, and many
people not from the South think that it is, there
is a larger question, its constitutionality. Even
if the bill passes, it will be tested in the courts.
And even if it were constitutional, it would be
almost impossible to prevent some form of re
striction. The battle will not be won on the
floors of Congress.
The United Nations' vein of good fortune
hasn't pinched out yet. We're still rolling on all
fronts. But the war isn't over yet, and the boys
won't be out of the trenches by Christmas. As
those of age 18-19 have doubtless already
gathered.
A bill was introduced in Congress the other
day which would give authority to the Presi
dent to suspend tariff and immigration laws in
the interests of the war effort for the duration.
The bill was very broadly drawn, and would
have given the President vast powers. But
power per se was not the point of Congressional
attack; verily they "strained at a gnat and swal
lowed a camel." The House refused to pass
the bill because the House or some of it likes
tariffs, and felt that this would be tantamount
to repealing the tariff and immigration laws. I
am not going to argue the tariff question here,
beyond saying that I'm against 'em. (If any
reader really wants to argue, I refer him to Pro
fessor Boggs, who'll make a good free-trader
out of him or become "inebriated with his own
verbosity" in trying.)
The argument in Congress has a larger sig
nificance than U.S. economic policy. If Con
gressmen are unwilling, even during the war, to
permit tampering with tariffs and immigration
laws, barriers to trade among nations, will they
be willing-to agree to any form of post-war in
ternational organization, which must involve
abolition of trade barriers almost by definition?
I have no poll figures at hand, but I know that
many Americans favor some form of interna
tional organization, "world state," "federal un
ion," a strengthened League of Nations, and my
advice to them is that they write their Congress
men early and often to bring their segment of
public opinion to official attention. (In this dis
trict, lohn Z. Anderson, House of Representa
