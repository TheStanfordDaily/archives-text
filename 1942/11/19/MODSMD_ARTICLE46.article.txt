The Editor, Sir:
As the result of the friendly spirit and close
co-operation maintained between Stanford and
California, card stunts v/ill be presented by
the Stanford rooting section between the halves.
At the beginning of the football season it was
decided to forego the expense of card stunts.
However, a meeting with Bob Dreher, California
Rally Committee chairman, resulted in the loan
of 5,000 cards to the Stanford Rally Committee,
so that both rooting sections could compete
against each other in thei-r stunts and give the
usual color to this game.
The loan of these cards is one of the best ex
amples of co-operation between the universities
that has appeared in many years. Such action
is to be encouraged.
The Rally Committee is concluding two
weeks' work on card stunts and sixteen stunts,
including many flips and animated action,
which will give Cal a run for its money.
The cards must not be torn up. They are
only a loan. Cardboard is now a war scarcity,
and each card MUST be returned.

With all their beet-topping, scrap-gathering,
etc., Stanford living groups are not doing all
they can to help the war effort. With all the
news of impending meat rationing, shortages,
and the widely publicized program to share the
available meat with two meatless days a week,
a number of living groups with independent
kitchens go merrily on their way serving meat,
good cuts and plenty of it, every day in the
week.
The remedy for such activity is ready at hand.
The commissary need only stop meat deliveries
in the appropriate amounts. And I hope they
do it soon.
