# Bear, Indian Fight to End In Chaparral
## 
### 
THE BEAST OF BERKELEY, by
Cal Thayer in the November Chap
arral.
Surely destined to take a place in
the field of epic poetry beside
Homer's "Iliad," and equalled only
by Milton's "Paradise Lost" in the
surging sonority of its lines, "The
Beast of Berkeley" by Cal Thayer
will be made public for tire first
time tomorrow when it appears in
the Big Game Chaparral.
This, Thayer's blank verse master
piece, is a tale of "the golden bear,
the yellow bear of Cal, which did
sweep from out his hideous cave in
grim and bare Berkeley."
"For 30,000 years and seven days,"
the prologue relates, "This monster
raged, and slew who came his way."
At last, however, in a momentous,
horrible encounter, the great bear
comes to grips with "A noble nat
ural, a man unschooled, a savage
from the wilds, an Indian." And
Thayer's metre resounds from its
own climactic momentum.
At length the death struggle sub
sides, and the epilogue grows calm:
"The battle now is done, the savage
won. Peace reigneth supreme, and
no more war." And so in noble,
striding verse, the epic draws to its
fitting close.—Covey.
