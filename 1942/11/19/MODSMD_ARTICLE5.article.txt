# Muheim Will Conduct Big Game Rally Tonight
## 
### 
It's somewhat curtailed by the
war, but it's still the Big Game Rally,
and Stanford students, as in the past,
will jampack the Pavilion at 7:30 to
night for the rally preceding the
48th renewal of California-Stanford
football rivalry.
There's no Parade this year and no
Big Game Bonfire, both are sacri
ficed to the war, so Stanford's
famed spirit must be compressed
into 60 minutes of the fast-moving
rally, initial event of the Big Game
weekend program.
Harry Muheim, Ram's Head mem
ber and former ace Gaieties funny
man, will set the pace as master of
ceremonies. Several times director
of the Gaieties, Muheim wrote last
spring's Spring Show and edited the
movie "Spirit of Stanford" for
Columbia Pictures last summer.
BILL LEISER?
There is an as yet unconfirmed
possibility that Bill Leiser, San
Francisco Chronicle sports expert
and a supporter of Stanford's teams,
will be feature speaker. However,
Rally Committee won't know until

sometime this afternoon whether or
not he will be able to appear.
There is also an unconfirmed
rumor that Sergeant Casey, guest
speaker and song leader at the 1941
rally, will return to deliver another
inspiring oration.
Shorty "The Man" Grannis, an
other ace funny man, now an Encina
sponsor, will put on a skit for the
rally. Another dramatic interlude
will be presented by the freshman
members of the Rally Committee.
STAMM WILL SPEAK
The team will be on hand headed
by Coach Marchie Schwartz. Big
Ed Stamm, first string tackle and
student body president, will be one
of the feature speakers.
Stanford's band will be there to
supply plenty of noise for the oc
casion. The band members have
worked up arrangements of service
songs and popular numbers.
Last, but not least, head yell lead
er Doc Colyear with his assistants
Jack Rieser and Kenny Anderson
will direct student efforts to blast
the roof off the Pavilion with their
lungpower.
