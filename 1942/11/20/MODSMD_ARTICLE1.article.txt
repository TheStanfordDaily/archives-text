# Bear, Indian Crews Clash At Oakland
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Achievements of two years of
thankless work will he recorded to
morrow oil the Oakland Estuary at
11 a.m. when Stanford and Cali
fornia meet in the first official race
between the schools since 1!)21.
(The Crew is not officially repre
senting Stanford University, because
it is not recognized by the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control. Other
than that, the race may be consid
ered "official.")
When Farm Coach Carl Pedersen
sends his men against veteran Ky
Ebright's crew on the 2,000-meter
course, it won't be in the spirit of
bitter competition. Second only to
the day-in and day-out work of
students who wanted the shell sport
back on the Farm, Stanford owes
its crew to the University of Cali
fornia.
Through Ebright and interested
Cal oarsmen, Stanford received two
of its three shells. (The other was
a gift from Washington Husky
Al Ulbrickson.)
Cal brought the Washington shell
all the way from Seattle for Stan-

Stanford students have two
routes to follow to the crew race
tomorrow: (1) across Dumbarton
or San Mateo Bridge, up the Bay
to Oakland on Highway 17, which
becomes East 14th Street in Oak
land. Turn left toward the es
tuary at 29th street. At the es
tuary turn left. (2) Cross the

struggling Stanfordites.
CREW ROSTER
So tomo'rrow when the following
crews clash, the meeting realizes
hopes of both schools.
Tlie lineups:
Stanford California
Drake Coxswain Meyer |
Clary Stroke Watson j
Grunwald No. 7 Bernay |
Henderson No. 6 Moller
Hampton No. 5 Sortille
Young No. 4 Wolf
Foster No. 3 Chappell j

Schute No. 1 Rockwell |
In the spring of 1940, a group of !
Stanford men built their own scow. J
formed a club, and combined the
two on Lake Lagunita in the first 1
crew Stanford had seen since the 1
last Farm-Cal race 22 years ago. I
The following fall, the group moved i
down to Redwood City where, aug- !
mented by the first .shell gift from j
Cal, they began their long climb
upward to recognition as Stanford I
athletes.
No little part of their success is
due to Carl Pedersen, a former Cal
crew star, who has coached the or
ganization on a voluntary basis
since its start. This fall he was ap
pointed acting crew coach by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
With equipment of a sort, a self
made boat house, and lonesome af
ternoons of practice on the windy
bay behind them, the crew started
its fight for gym credit. Here the
war effort came to their aid.
GYM CREDIT
With the new emphasis on physi
cal education for wartime, crew
became a regular School of Health
course this fall, and the classes have
been training seven days a week —
drowsy Sundays included since
then.
Tomorrow they go into their race
with the official benediction of their
schoolmates in the form of Excom':; ;
Wednesday night grant of Circle S
letters to crew members. Cal's Ky i
Ebright when informed of the rul
ing said in Berkeley, "I'm awfully
glad to hear that Stanford boys
are at last being rewarded for their
years of effort to bring crew back."
MEMBERS' EXPERIENCE
Cox Walt Drake has directed ev
ery race of the group since its start.
A senior, Drake has had to learn to
steer a straight race because their
Redwood City practice course is
"damned crooked." Bvid Clary, sen
ior and the guiding force of the
crew movement since its start, has
stroked every Stanford raco in the
new era.
Gerry Grunwald, a sophomore
who rowed on the Cal crew, came
to Stanford Winter Quarter — a
smooth rower with more than usual
experience. Sid Henderson is a
newcomer to crew. A senior, his
combination of strength and speed
has filled out a weak spot in the
Pedersen lineup.
Bob Hampton, former wrestler,
changed to the oar sport this fall,
and is the biggest "hulk" on the
roster, with the hardest pull. Ken
ny Young, a rangy sophomore, has
! stroked the second and first boats,
| but seems to fit in best at No. 4.
FOSTER EXPERIENCED
Bill Foster, a newcomer soph,
has been out part of the season but
has had previous experience. Bill
Dodd is another sophomore who
has shown exceptional fight in the
No. 2 spot, according to crew spon
sors. Paul Schute in the bow spot
has excellent timing. He is a new
■ comer and a senior.

In the spring of 1940, a group of !
Stanford men built their own scow. J
formed a club, and combined the
two on Lake Lagunita in the first 1
crew Stanford had seen since the 1
last Farm-Cal race 22 years ago. I
The following fall, the group moved i
down to Redwood City where, aug- !
mented by the first .shell gift from j
Cal, they began their long climb
upward to recognition as Stanford I
athletes.
No little part of their success is
due to Carl Pedersen, a former Cal
crew star, who has coached the or
ganization on a voluntary basis
since its start. This fall he was ap
pointed acting crew coach by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
With equipment of a sort, a self
made boat house, and lonesome af
ternoons of practice on the windy
bay behind them, the crew started
its fight for gym credit. Here the
war effort came to their aid.
GYM CREDIT
With the new emphasis on physi
cal education for wartime, crew
became a regular School of Health
course this fall, and the classes have
been training seven days a week —
drowsy Sundays included since
then.
Tomorrow they go into their race
with the official benediction of their
schoolmates in the form of Excom':; ;
Wednesday night grant of Circle S
letters to crew members. Cal's Ky i
Ebright when informed of the rul
ing said in Berkeley, "I'm awfully
glad to hear that Stanford boys
are at last being rewarded for their
years of effort to bring crew back."
MEMBERS' EXPERIENCE
Cox Walt Drake has directed ev
ery race of the group since its start.
A senior, Drake has had to learn to
steer a straight race because their
Redwood City practice course is
"damned crooked." Bvid Clary, sen
ior and the guiding force of the
crew movement since its start, has
stroked every Stanford raco in the
new era.
Gerry Grunwald, a sophomore
who rowed on the Cal crew, came
to Stanford Winter Quarter — a
smooth rower with more than usual
experience. Sid Henderson is a
newcomer to crew. A senior, his
combination of strength and speed
has filled out a weak spot in the
Pedersen lineup.
Bob Hampton, former wrestler,
changed to the oar sport this fall,
and is the biggest "hulk" on the
roster, with the hardest pull. Ken
ny Young, a rangy sophomore, has
! stroked the second and first boats,
| but seems to fit in best at No. 4.
FOSTER EXPERIENCED
Bill Foster, a newcomer soph,
has been out part of the season but
has had previous experience. Bill
Dodd is another sophomore who
has shown exceptional fight in the
No. 2 spot, according to crew spon
sors. Paul Schute in the bow spot
has excellent timing. He is a new
■ comer and a senior.

MEMBERS' EXPERIENCE
Cox Walt Drake has directed ev
ery race of the group since its start.
A senior, Drake has had to learn to
steer a straight race because their
Redwood City practice course is
"damned crooked." Bvid Clary, sen
ior and the guiding force of the
crew movement since its start, has
stroked every Stanford raco in the
new era.
Gerry Grunwald, a sophomore
who rowed on the Cal crew, came
to Stanford Winter Quarter — a
smooth rower with more than usual
experience. Sid Henderson is a
newcomer to crew. A senior, his
combination of strength and speed
has filled out a weak spot in the
Pedersen lineup.
Bob Hampton, former wrestler,
changed to the oar sport this fall,
and is the biggest "hulk" on the
roster, with the hardest pull. Ken
ny Young, a rangy sophomore, has
! stroked the second and first boats,
| but seems to fit in best at No. 4.
FOSTER EXPERIENCED
Bill Foster, a newcomer soph,
has been out part of the season but
has had previous experience. Bill
Dodd is another sophomore who
has shown exceptional fight in the
No. 2 spot, according to crew spon
sors. Paul Schute in the bow spot
has excellent timing. He is a new
■ comer and a senior.

CREW ROSTER
So tomo'rrow when the following
crews clash, the meeting realizes
hopes of both schools.
Tlie lineups:
Stanford California
Drake Coxswain Meyer |
Clary Stroke Watson j
Grunwald No. 7 Bernay |
Henderson No. 6 Moller
Hampton No. 5 Sortille
Young No. 4 Wolf
Foster No. 3 Chappell j
Dodd No. 2 Chain j
Schute No. 1 Rockwell |
In the spring of 1940, a group of !
Stanford men built their own scow. J
formed a club, and combined the
two on Lake Lagunita in the first 1
crew Stanford had seen since the 1
last Farm-Cal race 22 years ago. I
The following fall, the group moved i
down to Redwood City where, aug- !
mented by the first .shell gift from j
Cal, they began their long climb
upward to recognition as Stanford I
athletes.
No little part of their success is
due to Carl Pedersen, a former Cal
crew star, who has coached the or
ganization on a voluntary basis
since its start. This fall he was ap
pointed acting crew coach by Dr.
Ray Lyman Wilbur.
With equipment of a sort, a self
made boat house, and lonesome af
ternoons of practice on the windy
bay behind them, the crew started
its fight for gym credit. Here the
war effort came to their aid.
GYM CREDIT
With the new emphasis on physi
cal education for wartime, crew
became a regular School of Health
course this fall, and the classes have
been training seven days a week —
drowsy Sundays included since
then.
Tomorrow they go into their race
with the official benediction of their
schoolmates in the form of Excom':; ;
Wednesday night grant of Circle S
letters to crew members. Cal's Ky i
Ebright when informed of the rul
ing said in Berkeley, "I'm awfully
glad to hear that Stanford boys
are at last being rewarded for their
years of effort to bring crew back."
MEMBERS' EXPERIENCE
Cox Walt Drake has directed ev
ery race of the group since its start.
A senior, Drake has had to learn to
steer a straight race because their
Redwood City practice course is
"damned crooked." Bvid Clary, sen
ior and the guiding force of the
crew movement since its start, has
stroked every Stanford raco in the
new era.
Gerry Grunwald, a sophomore
who rowed on the Cal crew, came
to Stanford Winter Quarter — a
smooth rower with more than usual
experience. Sid Henderson is a
newcomer to crew. A senior, his
combination of strength and speed
has filled out a weak spot in the
Pedersen lineup.
Bob Hampton, former wrestler,
changed to the oar sport this fall,
and is the biggest "hulk" on the
roster, with the hardest pull. Ken
ny Young, a rangy sophomore, has
! stroked the second and first boats,
| but seems to fit in best at No. 4.
FOSTER EXPERIENCED
Bill Foster, a newcomer soph,
has been out part of the season but
has had previous experience. Bill
Dodd is another sophomore who
has shown exceptional fight in the
No. 2 spot, according to crew spon
sors. Paul Schute in the bow spot
has excellent timing. He is a new
■ comer and a senior.
