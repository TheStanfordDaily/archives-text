# REDSKINS GO A-CHOPPIN': ODDS ARE 2-1
## Dopesters Favor Cards, But Teams Are Even Steven Bears Keep Playing Worse; Base Hopes On 'Big Game Spirit' 
### DAVE WAY 
Sports Editor, Daily California!)
For the last two weeks, the
California Bears have been play
ing progressively worse. Stan
ford has been playing progres
sively better.
But over at Berkeley, where the
Indians and the Bears meet for their I
annual clash Saturday in Memorial
Stadiunj, we're conceding Stanford
absolutely nothing.
The Big Game spirit which has
won for California every year but
one since 1936 has again gripped
the campus. The Bears are hot and
rarin' to go.
This has been a rough season for
the Bears. After a creeping start,
the Bears finally got going long
enough to smack down Washington
and Oregon, before the Trojans
knocked them back in the doldrums
with a 21-7 defeat in Los Angeles.
STANFORD GETS EDGE
As everyone has pointed out,
Stanford has defeated nearly every
body that the Bears have defeated,
and a few more besides.
Yes, and Stanford, on an off day,
waxed Idaho who in turn waxed
Montana, while California defeated,
(not waxed) the Grizzlies by only
two touchdowns.
On the face of the thing it sounds
pretty convincing, doesn't it? It
sounded pretty convincing last year,
too, but yet the Bears won a com
paratively easy victory, in point of
scoring at least.
Last season, before the Big Game,
it was our duty to interview sev
eral of the California football play
ers. Never had we seen such a de
termined lot of men. Never, that
is, until this year.
PICKED FOR BOWL
We don't talk much about the
season over here at Cal. The play
ers don't either. After all, they were
the bunch that was picked to end
up in the Rose Bowl before the sea
son started.
But Saturday is the Big Game.
We don't give a rap about what has
happened before as long as we can
scalp the Indians.
In a way, the pickers were right.
