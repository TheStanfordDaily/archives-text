# REDSKINS GO A-CHOPPIN': ODDS ARE 2-1
## Dopesters Favor Cards, But Teams Are Even Steven Bears Keep Playing Worse; Base Hopes On 'Big Game Spirit' 
### DAVE WAY 
Sports Editor, Daily California!)
For the last two weeks, the
California Bears have been play
ing progressively worse. Stan
ford has been playing progres
sively better.
But over at Berkeley, where the
Indians and the Bears meet for their I
annual clash Saturday in Memorial
Stadiunj, we're conceding Stanford
absolutely nothing.
The Big Game spirit which has
won for California every year but
one since 1936 has again gripped
the campus. The Bears are hot and
rarin' to go.
This has been a rough season for
the Bears. After a creeping start,
the Bears finally got going long
enough to smack down Washington
and Oregon, before the Trojans
knocked them back in the doldrums
with a 21-7 defeat in Los Angeles.
STANFORD GETS EDGE
As everyone has pointed out,
Stanford has defeated nearly every
body that the Bears have defeated,
and a few more besides.
Yes, and Stanford, on an off day,
waxed Idaho who in turn waxed
Montana, while California defeated,
(not waxed) the Grizzlies by only
two touchdowns.
On the face of the thing it sounds
pretty convincing, doesn't it? It
sounded pretty convincing last year,
too, but yet the Bears won a com
paratively easy victory, in point of
scoring at least.
Last season, before the Big Game,
it was our duty to interview sev
eral of the California football play
ers. Never had we seen such a de
termined lot of men. Never, that
is, until this year.
PICKED FOR BOWL
We don't talk much about the
season over here at Cal. The play
ers don't either. After all, they were
the bunch that was picked to end
up in the Rose Bowl before the sea
son started.
But Saturday is the Big Game.
We don't give a rap about what has
happened before as long as we can
scalp the Indians.
In a way, the pickers were right.
: Potentially, California has a great
I team. The line started slow and
I finally developed the charge which
| enabled the Bears to outgain prac
| tically every opponent they have
met this season.
The backs have always been
I strong—especially with Joltin' Jim
Jurkovich carrying the mail. With
i Frank Porto at fullback, the start
! ing quartet packs some extra wal
| lop. Porto is a fast starter, and runs
| hard.
JURKOVICH STAR
Nobody has to be told about Jurk.
i In one sentence, he's big, fast, and
deceptive. Without doubt, he is the

greatest halfback to play for the
Bears since Vic Bottari.
The right half is a problem.
Johnny Graves is a whale of a
blocker, but is really too slow to
make the old Sam Chapman re
verse work with any consistency.
Walt Cordon doesn't pack quite
enough punch for regular duty at
the position but is best defensively.
The improvement of Dan Mc-
Carthy at quarter has been phe
nominal. He replaced Joe Merlo,
when the latter was on the shelf,
and has kept the position ever since.
Most of the season, injuries have
kept the Bears from using their
best combinations. Billy Reinhard,
half, and Russ Messner, full, are
still out with arm injuries.
All-American candidate Johnny
Ferguson, who was two weeks ago
the second-best pass catcher in the
country, is the standout for the
Bears in the line.
PASS DEFENSE WEAK
We've heard rumors that the In
dian pass defense is weak. If that
is so, Fergie will be giving the
Cards plenty of trouble all after
noon.
The line was further bolstered a
few weeks ago when Brunei Chris
tensen was shifted from tackle to
center, a spot which he played with
linesse last season.
At tackles are Chuck DeCoudres
and Don Scaver. Both are capable
enough, for each, this is his first
year of first string competition.
Jack Herrero at right guard is
steady and dependable, The othet
guard has caused a little trouble.
Pint-sized Ernie Centner will start
although he is pressed plenty by
Toby Frcedman.
AGLER OK Ell TOO
A word about Harry Agler at
left end. Without a doubt, Agler i.l
- of the most underrated men on
the squad. Actually he is nearly as
good a pass receiver as Ferguson.
He has overcome the handicap of
inexperience and is now a hard man
to fool.
If the Bears win, it will be all

their own doing. They know the
theory backwards and forwards.
With the margin of spirit in their
favor, it may be in the books for
another Golden Bear vietorv.

dian pass defense is weak. If that
is so, Fergie will be giving the
Cards plenty of trouble all after
noon.
The line was further bolstered a
few weeks ago when Brunei Chris
tensen was shifted from tackle to
center, a spot which he played with
linesse last season.
At tackles are Chuck DeCoudres
and Don Scaver. Both are capable
enough, for each, this is his first
year of first string competition.
Jack Herrero at right guard is
steady and dependable, The othet
guard has caused a little trouble.
Pint-sized Ernie Centner will start
although he is pressed plenty by
Toby Frcedman.
AGLER OK Ell TOO
A word about Harry Agler at
left end. Without a doubt, Agler i.l
- of the most underrated men on
the squad. Actually he is nearly as
good a pass receiver as Ferguson.
He has overcome the handicap of
inexperience and is now a hard man
to fool.
If the Bears win, it will be all

their own doing. They know the
theory backwards and forwards.
With the margin of spirit in their
favor, it may be in the books for
another Golden Bear vietorv.

For the last two weeks, the
California Bears have been play
ing progressively worse. Stan
ford has been playing progres
sively better.
But over at Berkeley, where the
Indians and the Bears meet for their I
annual clash Saturday in Memorial
Stadiunj, we're conceding Stanford
absolutely nothing.
The Big Game spirit which has
won for California every year but
one since 1936 has again gripped
the campus. The Bears are hot and
rarin' to go.
This has been a rough season for
the Bears. After a creeping start,
the Bears finally got going long
enough to smack down Washington
and Oregon, before the Trojans
knocked them back in the doldrums
with a 21-7 defeat in Los Angeles.
STANFORD GETS EDGE
As everyone has pointed out,
Stanford has defeated nearly every
body that the Bears have defeated,
and a few more besides.
Yes, and Stanford, on an off day,
waxed Idaho who in turn waxed
Montana, while California defeated,
(not waxed) the Grizzlies by only
two touchdowns.
On the face of the thing it sounds
pretty convincing, doesn't it? It
sounded pretty convincing last year,
too, but yet the Bears won a com
paratively easy victory, in point of
scoring at least.
Last season, before the Big Game,
it was our duty to interview sev
eral of the California football play
ers. Never had we seen such a de
termined lot of men. Never, that
is, until this year.
PICKED FOR BOWL
We don't talk much about the
season over here at Cal. The play
ers don't either. After all, they were
the bunch that was picked to end
up in the Rose Bowl before the sea
son started.
But Saturday is the Big Game.
We don't give a rap about what has
happened before as long as we can
scalp the Indians.
In a way, the pickers were right.
: Potentially, California has a great
I team. The line started slow and
I finally developed the charge which
| enabled the Bears to outgain prac
| tically every opponent they have
met this season.
The backs have always been
I strong—especially with Joltin' Jim
Jurkovich carrying the mail. With
i Frank Porto at fullback, the start
! ing quartet packs some extra wal
| lop. Porto is a fast starter, and runs
| hard.
JURKOVICH STAR
Nobody has to be told about Jurk.
i In one sentence, he's big, fast, and
deceptive. Without doubt, he is the

greatest halfback to play for the
Bears since Vic Bottari.
The right half is a problem.
Johnny Graves is a whale of a
blocker, but is really too slow to
make the old Sam Chapman re
verse work with any consistency.
Walt Cordon doesn't pack quite
enough punch for regular duty at
the position but is best defensively.
The improvement of Dan Mc-
Carthy at quarter has been phe
nominal. He replaced Joe Merlo,
when the latter was on the shelf,
and has kept the position ever since.
Most of the season, injuries have
kept the Bears from using their
best combinations. Billy Reinhard,
half, and Russ Messner, full, are
still out with arm injuries.
All-American candidate Johnny
Ferguson, who was two weeks ago
the second-best pass catcher in the
country, is the standout for the
Bears in the line.

Sports Editor, Daily California!)
For the last two weeks, the
California Bears have been play
ing progressively worse. Stan
ford has been playing progres
sively better.
But over at Berkeley, where the
Indians and the Bears meet for their I
annual clash Saturday in Memorial
Stadiunj, we're conceding Stanford
absolutely nothing.
The Big Game spirit which has
won for California every year but
one since 1936 has again gripped
the campus. The Bears are hot and
rarin' to go.
This has been a rough season for
the Bears. After a creeping start,
the Bears finally got going long
enough to smack down Washington
and Oregon, before the Trojans
knocked them back in the doldrums
with a 21-7 defeat in Los Angeles.
STANFORD GETS EDGE
As everyone has pointed out,
Stanford has defeated nearly every
body that the Bears have defeated,
and a few more besides.
Yes, and Stanford, on an off day,
waxed Idaho who in turn waxed
Montana, while California defeated,
(not waxed) the Grizzlies by only
two touchdowns.
On the face of the thing it sounds
pretty convincing, doesn't it? It
sounded pretty convincing last year,
too, but yet the Bears won a com
paratively easy victory, in point of
scoring at least.
Last season, before the Big Game,
it was our duty to interview sev
eral of the California football play
ers. Never had we seen such a de
termined lot of men. Never, that
is, until this year.
PICKED FOR BOWL
We don't talk much about the
season over here at Cal. The play
ers don't either. After all, they were
the bunch that was picked to end
up in the Rose Bowl before the sea
son started.
But Saturday is the Big Game.
We don't give a rap about what has
happened before as long as we can
scalp the Indians.
In a way, the pickers were right.
: Potentially, California has a great
I team. The line started slow and
I finally developed the charge which
| enabled the Bears to outgain prac
| tically every opponent they have
met this season.
The backs have always been
I strong—especially with Joltin' Jim
Jurkovich carrying the mail. With
i Frank Porto at fullback, the start
! ing quartet packs some extra wal
| lop. Porto is a fast starter, and runs
| hard.
JURKOVICH STAR
Nobody has to be told about Jurk.
i In one sentence, he's big, fast, and
deceptive. Without doubt, he is the

greatest halfback to play for the
Bears since Vic Bottari.
The right half is a problem.
Johnny Graves is a whale of a
blocker, but is really too slow to
make the old Sam Chapman re
verse work with any consistency.
Walt Cordon doesn't pack quite
enough punch for regular duty at
the position but is best defensively.
The improvement of Dan Mc-
Carthy at quarter has been phe
nominal. He replaced Joe Merlo,
when the latter was on the shelf,
and has kept the position ever since.
Most of the season, injuries have
kept the Bears from using their
best combinations. Billy Reinhard,
half, and Russ Messner, full, are
still out with arm injuries.
All-American candidate Johnny
Ferguson, who was two weeks ago
the second-best pass catcher in the
country, is the standout for the
Bears in the line.
PASS DEFENSE WEAK
We've heard rumors that the In
dian pass defense is weak. If that
is so, Fergie will be giving the
Cards plenty of trouble all after
noon.
The line was further bolstered a
few weeks ago when Brunei Chris
tensen was shifted from tackle to
center, a spot which he played with
linesse last season.
At tackles are Chuck DeCoudres
and Don Scaver. Both are capable
enough, for each, this is his first
year of first string competition.
Jack Herrero at right guard is
steady and dependable, The othet
guard has caused a little trouble.
Pint-sized Ernie Centner will start
although he is pressed plenty by
Toby Frcedman.
AGLER OK Ell TOO
A word about Harry Agler at
left end. Without a doubt, Agler i.l
- of the most underrated men on
the squad. Actually he is nearly as
good a pass receiver as Ferguson.
He has overcome the handicap of
inexperience and is now a hard man
to fool.
If the Bears win, it will be all

their own doing. They know the
theory backwards and forwards.
With the margin of spirit in their
favor, it may be in the books for
another Golden Bear vietorv.
