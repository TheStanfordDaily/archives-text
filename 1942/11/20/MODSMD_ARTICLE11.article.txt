## 
### BOB SONTAG 
Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
They tall it the "Big Game."
And it will be born again tomor
row afternoon at Berkeley by Stan
ford and California, rivals supreme,
in a football clash that promises
to be one of the greatest heartfelt
thrills during that time known lo
most of us as "the duration."
Starting at 2:30 Marchmont "Mar
c-hie" Schwartz of Stanford and
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison of Cali
fornia will culminate long hours of
planning and send two evenly
matched clubs on the field—though
odds favor the Indians, 2-1.
Stanford wound up practice yes
terday with fire and liveness, in
dicating the Redmen will be at their
peak both mentally and physically
for what is always year by year
a bruising and psychologically
shrouded ball game.
STANFORD REAI) Y
Questions keep popping up as
field time approaches. Is Stanford's
weak pass defense mended? Is
Buck Fawcett ready to run full

blast? Can Stanford stop Jurko
vich, the spearhead of the Bear
running and passing attack? Are
the Cards at full strength?
There is but one answer: Stan
ford IS ready on all fronts.
Fawcett can turn on speed like
the "Scourge of Los Banos" once
did before he was injured earlier
in the season.
The hole in Stanford's defense
against passing has been worked on
during half of the week's workouts
: and now stands ready to be tested
against the aerials of Jim Jurko
| vich and Gene Pickett. It remains
to be seen whether or not the two
Bear aces can puncture the barrage
balloons set up by Messrs. Schwartz,
Shipkey, and Lindskog.
SEVEN GAME CAPTAINS
Headed by seven senior game
captains and four other first-string
potenters, the Stanford lads arc
asked to carry the weight of 2-1
favoritism placed on their shoulders
by oddsmakers. If they can over
come the distinct disadvanatge of
being public choices, half the Big
Game battle is won.
Here they are, the starters, read
ing from left to right on the line:
Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Bill Young,
Bruno Banducci, and Roger Lav
erty.
In the backfield it's Ray Hammett
at quarter; RoSs Dana at left half;
Bill Sheller at right half; and Buck
Fawcett at fullback.
Taylor stayed in the men's Rest
Home yesterday but was reported
rarin' to go. It will be quite a test
for Taylor, who is trying to convince
the All-American board that he's
the brand of player for their selec
tions this year. And he'll get his best
chance to show them how tomorrow.
Big Game spirit waxed hotter on
yesterday's practice field than it
had all week, and no one can say
that Stanford is not ''high" for the
1942 test.
The squad is bolstered by the re
turn of Freddie Sanderman to right
half, Fritzie is now playing right be
hind Sheller at the position.
Though this may or may not be
the last Big Game for the duration,
each and every one of these men is
out to regain the axe for Stanford,
be it for only one year, or until
Hirohito, Hitler, and Mussolini are
blasted to bits—and even then the
Big Game may go on during war
time.
Others who are bound to see ac
tion in the Pacific Coast's football
titanic are such as Art Shipkey,
pounding fullback, who'll stand
ready to relieve Fawcett; Don Zap
pettini. speedy left half, who per
formed so remarkably against Ore
gon State last week; and a host of
others: Dave Brown, Al Hoisch,
Dave Patterson, Harvey Bernhard,
and many others.
God bless 'em all.

Fawcett can turn on speed like
the "Scourge of Los Banos" once
did before he was injured earlier
in the season.
The hole in Stanford's defense
against passing has been worked on
during half of the week's workouts
: and now stands ready to be tested

SEVEN GAME CAPTAINS
Headed by seven senior game
captains and four other first-string
potenters, the Stanford lads arc
asked to carry the weight of 2-1
favoritism placed on their shoulders
by oddsmakers. If they can over
come the distinct disadvanatge of
being public choices, half the Big
Game battle is won.
Here they are, the starters, read
ing from left to right on the line:
Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Bill Young,
Bruno Banducci, and Roger Lav
erty.
In the backfield it's Ray Hammett
at quarter; RoSs Dana at left half;
Bill Sheller at right half; and Buck
Fawcett at fullback.
Taylor stayed in the men's Rest
Home yesterday but was reported
rarin' to go. It will be quite a test
for Taylor, who is trying to convince
the All-American board that he's
the brand of player for their selec
tions this year. And he'll get his best
chance to show them how tomorrow.
Big Game spirit waxed hotter on
yesterday's practice field than it
had all week, and no one can say
that Stanford is not ''high" for the
1942 test.
The squad is bolstered by the re
turn of Freddie Sanderman to right
half, Fritzie is now playing right be
hind Sheller at the position.
Though this may or may not be
the last Big Game for the duration,
each and every one of these men is
out to regain the axe for Stanford,
be it for only one year, or until
Hirohito, Hitler, and Mussolini are
blasted to bits—and even then the
Big Game may go on during war
time.
Others who are bound to see ac
tion in the Pacific Coast's football
titanic are such as Art Shipkey,
pounding fullback, who'll stand
ready to relieve Fawcett; Don Zap
pettini. speedy left half, who per
formed so remarkably against Ore
gon State last week; and a host of
others: Dave Brown, Al Hoisch,
Dave Patterson, Harvey Bernhard,
and many others.
God bless 'em all.

Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
They tall it the "Big Game."
And it will be born again tomor
row afternoon at Berkeley by Stan
ford and California, rivals supreme,
in a football clash that promises
to be one of the greatest heartfelt
thrills during that time known lo
most of us as "the duration."
Starting at 2:30 Marchmont "Mar
c-hie" Schwartz of Stanford and
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison of Cali
fornia will culminate long hours of
planning and send two evenly
matched clubs on the field—though
odds favor the Indians, 2-1.
Stanford wound up practice yes
terday with fire and liveness, in
dicating the Redmen will be at their
peak both mentally and physically
for what is always year by year
a bruising and psychologically
shrouded ball game.
STANFORD REAI) Y
Questions keep popping up as
field time approaches. Is Stanford's
weak pass defense mended? Is
Buck Fawcett ready to run full

blast? Can Stanford stop Jurko
vich, the spearhead of the Bear
running and passing attack? Are
the Cards at full strength?
There is but one answer: Stan
ford IS ready on all fronts.
Fawcett can turn on speed like
the "Scourge of Los Banos" once
did before he was injured earlier
in the season.
The hole in Stanford's defense
against passing has been worked on
during half of the week's workouts
: and now stands ready to be tested
against the aerials of Jim Jurko
| vich and Gene Pickett. It remains
to be seen whether or not the two
Bear aces can puncture the barrage
balloons set up by Messrs. Schwartz,
Shipkey, and Lindskog.
SEVEN GAME CAPTAINS
Headed by seven senior game
captains and four other first-string
potenters, the Stanford lads arc
asked to carry the weight of 2-1
favoritism placed on their shoulders
by oddsmakers. If they can over
come the distinct disadvanatge of
being public choices, half the Big
Game battle is won.
Here they are, the starters, read
ing from left to right on the line:
Hank Norberg, Ed Stamm, Chuck
Taylor, Milt Vucinich, Bill Young,
Bruno Banducci, and Roger Lav
erty.
In the backfield it's Ray Hammett
at quarter; RoSs Dana at left half;
Bill Sheller at right half; and Buck
Fawcett at fullback.
