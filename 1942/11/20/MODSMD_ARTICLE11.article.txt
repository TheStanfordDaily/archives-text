They tall it the "Big Game."
And it will be born again tomor
row afternoon at Berkeley by Stan
ford and California, rivals supreme,
in a football clash that promises
to be one of the greatest heartfelt
thrills during that time known lo
most of us as "the duration."
Starting at 2:30 Marchmont "Mar
c-hie" Schwartz of Stanford and
Leonard B. "Stub" Allison of Cali
fornia will culminate long hours of
planning and send two evenly
matched clubs on the field—though
odds favor the Indians, 2-1.
Stanford wound up practice yes
terday with fire and liveness, in
dicating the Redmen will be at their
peak both mentally and physically
for what is always year by year
a bruising and psychologically
shrouded ball game.
STANFORD REAI) Y
Questions keep popping up as
field time approaches. Is Stanford's
weak pass defense mended? Is
Buck Fawcett ready to run full

blast? Can Stanford stop Jurko
vich, the spearhead of the Bear
running and passing attack? Are
the Cards at full strength?
There is but one answer: Stan
ford IS ready on all fronts.
Fawcett can turn on speed like
the "Scourge of Los Banos" once
did before he was injured earlier
in the season.
The hole in Stanford's defense
against passing has been worked on
during half of the week's workouts
: and now stands ready to be tested
against the aerials of Jim Jurko
| vich and Gene Pickett. It remains
to be seen whether or not the two
Bear aces can puncture the barrage
balloons set up by Messrs. Schwartz,
Shipkey, and Lindskog.
SEVEN GAME CAPTAINS
Headed by seven senior game
captains and four other first-string
potenters, the Stanford lads arc
asked to carry the weight of 2-1
