BERKELEY, Nov. 19 (U.R)—
Coach Stub Allison said today the
California football team's spirit is
"good" for the "Big Game" with
Stanford here Saturday—but "not
as good as last season," when the
Bears handed the heavily favored
Stanford eleven its worst defeat of
the season.
"If California's going to win this
'Big Game'," Allison told the team,
"it's going to have to make up for
the disadvantages of Stanford's
senior line and fast backfield. The
California line is going to have to
play like the Rcinhards and the
Herreros played last year."
The Bears went through their
last heavy drill this afternoon.
