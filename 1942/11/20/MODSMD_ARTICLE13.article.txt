# Axe, Symbol of Farm Spirit, Celebrates Its 43rd Birthday

### KAY SCHWARTZ 
The Stanford Axe, probably (he most picturesque symbol of rivalry
anywhere in U.S. college life, will celebrate its forty-third birthday to
niorrow. This is the fiftieth anniversary of the Big Game, the first being
played in 1892, but it was not until seven years later in 1899 that the Axe
was born.
In that year came the turning point of the great Starrford-Cal rivalry.
Tragedy struck the Farm in 1899 when George Beckett, captain and star
pitcher on the baseball team, died before the season started. A symbol of
some kind had to be found to rekindle the spirit of a student body stunned
by the death of its great college hero.
And so on April 13, 1899, the Axe was born. Three years before, Iwo
members of the student body, Will Irwin find Chris Bradley, had intro
duced the Axe yell which inspired the introduction of the huge red and
white hatchet. The Axe appeared on the eve of the Cal series when it
was sharpened on a tremendous grindstone and then used to chop off the
head of an effigy of the Golden Bear. This was just the incentive needed,
for the student body went wild with revamped enthusiasm.
The day of the California game the big red Axe was guarded by
four strong men who had been entrusted with it by Billy Erb and
Frank English, who had originated the idea. Stanford lost the gam«-
but a far greater tragedy was the loss of the Axe.
Cal stole the Axe and a fight for it raged over San Francisco for seven
hours. Tom McFadden, 200-pound tackle, was the last man to have his
hands on the Axe. Cal men started relaying the Axe through Chinatown
and across town to the ferry. Once Frank Strout, a Stanford hurdler, was
unwittingly handed the Axe by a Cal man and started to run, but the
California quarterback caught Strout from behind with a flying tackle
in the middle of San Francisco.
After several unsuccessful raids on the Berkeley campus by Stanford,
Cal put the Axe in the vaults of the Berkeley Americnn Trust. At one
time Stanford stole California's famous trophy, the Senior Fence, and
planned to hold it as a hostage, but for some strange reason the men of
Berkeley allowed them to keep it while the Axe remained in the vaults.
For thirty-three years, it was imprisoned there despite ingenious
schemes and brute force raids launched on the Cal caretakers.
