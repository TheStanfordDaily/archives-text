# SCHWARTZ SAYS BIG GAME TOSS-UP
## Coach Derides Odds; Fears 'Jurk,' Porto 
### BOB SONTAG 
Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
' Tomorrow's Big Game must be
onsidered a tossup. A fighting team
jacked up by a fighting rooting sec
ion will win for either school."
That was the sageful comment
>f Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz,
Stanford football coach, a short 48
lours before California and Stan
ord prepared to lock horns at
Berkeley.
Marchie was serious. You could
ell that the game will mean as
nuch to him as it will to every
member of the Stanford family.
"You know," he said, "this fellow
Jim Jurkovich can break up a ball
game any minute. And for that
h alter so can Frankie Porto."
FEARS JURKOVICH
Schwartz admitted that he feared
Jurkovich more than any other
member of the Bear backfield but
put forth strong indication that the
Indians can match Jurkovich gain
for gain, if they are ready to play
heady and mindful football.
Sizing up the 2-1 favoritism of
fered on his lads, Schwartz insisted
that the odds-makers had gone
awry.
"Why those guys ought to know
better," he exclaimed. "Anybody
who's followed Stanford and Cali
fornia through (he Big Games of
yea is cone hv kifows that there's
really no favorite. If one team had
gone through the season unde
ieatrd and the other had won all its
panics, Big Game would still be a
toss-UD."
NO REAL UPSETS
Like others who analyze this
thin ? called Eig Game down to its
component parts, Marchie knows
past records have indicated the
ability of either team to "upset"
the other at will when quoted a
shortender.
Then, almost confidently, Marchie
leaned back in his chair and prom
ised that the Stanford eleven was
going to fieht every inch of the
way through this 48th Big Game.
"Up at Berkeley, they say we
Won't have the spirit. Well I say
we will hnVe it. This team has
shown a hig upsurge in mental pre
paredness and from that angle we
are pretty well off."
NEED ROOTERS
Schwartz emphatically upheld
the point that a poorly handled,-
lion-aggressive rooting section
could ruin the Indians faster than
a Bear touchdown.
"Our kids want a packed root
ing section," he continued, "and
they want it 100 per cent behind
them throughout the game, win,
lose, or draw."
Marchie thumbed through a thick
scrapbook that bloused over at the
corners, full of clippings of Cali
fornia's previous games.
He couldn't quite fathom the
Bears' showing against Oregon
State. It's a tough problem for any
one.
NEED T.D. DRIVE
Those Beavers, just last Saturday
given the lacing of their lives by
Stanford, licked California near the
season's beginning, 13-8.
"How do you account for that?"
we queried.
"I can't account for it in any rea
sonable way," Marchie replied.
"But I can tell you one fact, cold
and invincible: California has a po
tentially championship squad, but
the Bears just don't seem to have
the extra scoring punch that wins
football games."
JURKOVICH AGAIN
"But you never know when
Jurkovich or some other Blue and
Gold gent will break loose and start
that scoring punch that's been
missing so far," he explained.
"Look what the Bears did to
Washington. They won, 19-7, and
Stanford only beat that score by
one point, 20-7," Marchie went on
"Figure out that reversal of form
if you can," he demanded.
From our discussion it seemed
that Marchie is still pretty much
up in the air about who will win
tomorrow. He can't say the Indians

will for sure. He knows they should.
Strictly on form the Cards show an
advantage in most departments, and
the only real thing keeping Marchie
from stamping a victory on his club
is that he knows better than anyone
a wrong prediction before the game
is far worse than the congratula
tions that come to a winning coach

| who makes no specific stand.
So we wandered on* out of the
' coach's room with hope and sin
j cereness from one of the most won
| derful teachers of football we've
| ever met.
A soft-voiced man who's bring
ing Stanford back up the trail to
Big Game after a disastrous start

in the 1942 gridiron season.
And he doesn't stop tomorrow,
after Big Game, or after the follow
ing Saturday when Stanford meets
the Pre-Flight school here, hut he
goes on, joining the Stanford Rugby
coaching staff, helping to keep the
Stanford sporting picture alive and
glowing.

Marchie thumbed through a thick
scrapbook that bloused over at the
corners, full of clippings of Cali
fornia's previous games.
He couldn't quite fathom the
Bears' showing against Oregon
State. It's a tough problem for any
one.
NEED T.D. DRIVE
Those Beavers, just last Saturday
given the lacing of their lives by
Stanford, licked California near the
season's beginning, 13-8.
"How do you account for that?"
we queried.
"I can't account for it in any rea
sonable way," Marchie replied.
"But I can tell you one fact, cold
and invincible: California has a po
tentially championship squad, but
the Bears just don't seem to have
the extra scoring punch that wins
football games."
JURKOVICH AGAIN
"But you never know when
Jurkovich or some other Blue and
Gold gent will break loose and start
that scoring punch that's been
missing so far," he explained.
"Look what the Bears did to
Washington. They won, 19-7, and
Stanford only beat that score by
one point, 20-7," Marchie went on
"Figure out that reversal of form
if you can," he demanded.
From our discussion it seemed
that Marchie is still pretty much
up in the air about who will win
tomorrow. He can't say the Indians

will for sure. He knows they should.
Strictly on form the Cards show an
advantage in most departments, and
the only real thing keeping Marchie
from stamping a victory on his club
is that he knows better than anyone
a wrong prediction before the game
is far worse than the congratula
tions that come to a winning coach

| who makes no specific stand.
So we wandered on* out of the
' coach's room with hope and sin
j cereness from one of the most won
| derful teachers of football we've
| ever met.
A soft-voiced man who's bring
ing Stanford back up the trail to
Big Game after a disastrous start

in the 1942 gridiron season.
And he doesn't stop tomorrow,
after Big Game, or after the follow
ing Saturday when Stanford meets
the Pre-Flight school here, hut he
goes on, joining the Stanford Rugby
coaching staff, helping to keep the
Stanford sporting picture alive and
glowing.


MARCHMONT "MARCHIE" SCHWARTZ
Head Football Coach, Stanford University
Sports Editor, Stanford Daily
' Tomorrow's Big Game must be
onsidered a tossup. A fighting team
jacked up by a fighting rooting sec
ion will win for either school."
That was the sageful comment
>f Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz,
Stanford football coach, a short 48
lours before California and Stan
ord prepared to lock horns at
Berkeley.
Marchie was serious. You could
ell that the game will mean as
nuch to him as it will to every
member of the Stanford family.
"You know," he said, "this fellow
Jim Jurkovich can break up a ball
game any minute. And for that
h alter so can Frankie Porto."
FEARS JURKOVICH
Schwartz admitted that he feared
Jurkovich more than any other
member of the Bear backfield but
put forth strong indication that the
Indians can match Jurkovich gain
for gain, if they are ready to play
heady and mindful football.
Sizing up the 2-1 favoritism of
fered on his lads, Schwartz insisted
that the odds-makers had gone
awry.
"Why those guys ought to know
better," he exclaimed. "Anybody
who's followed Stanford and Cali
fornia through (he Big Games of
yea is cone hv kifows that there's
really no favorite. If one team had
gone through the season unde
ieatrd and the other had won all its
panics, Big Game would still be a
toss-UD."
NO REAL UPSETS
Like others who analyze this
thin ? called Eig Game down to its
component parts, Marchie knows
past records have indicated the
ability of either team to "upset"
the other at will when quoted a
shortender.
Then, almost confidently, Marchie
leaned back in his chair and prom
ised that the Stanford eleven was
going to fieht every inch of the
way through this 48th Big Game.
"Up at Berkeley, they say we
Won't have the spirit. Well I say
we will hnVe it. This team has
shown a hig upsurge in mental pre
paredness and from that angle we
are pretty well off."
NEED ROOTERS
Schwartz emphatically upheld
the point that a poorly handled,-
lion-aggressive rooting section
could ruin the Indians faster than
a Bear touchdown.
"Our kids want a packed root
ing section," he continued, "and
they want it 100 per cent behind
them throughout the game, win,
lose, or draw."

onsidered a tossup. A fighting team
jacked up by a fighting rooting sec
ion will win for either school."
That was the sageful comment
>f Marchmont "Marchie" Schwartz,
Stanford football coach, a short 48
lours before California and Stan
ord prepared to lock horns at
Berkeley.
Marchie was serious. You could
ell that the game will mean as
nuch to him as it will to every
member of the Stanford family.
"You know," he said, "this fellow
Jim Jurkovich can break up a ball
game any minute. And for that
h alter so can Frankie Porto."
FEARS JURKOVICH
Schwartz admitted that he feared
Jurkovich more than any other
member of the Bear backfield but
put forth strong indication that the
Indians can match Jurkovich gain
for gain, if they are ready to play
heady and mindful football.
Sizing up the 2-1 favoritism of
fered on his lads, Schwartz insisted
that the odds-makers had gone
awry.
"Why those guys ought to know
better," he exclaimed. "Anybody
who's followed Stanford and Cali
fornia through (he Big Games of
yea is cone hv kifows that there's
really no favorite. If one team had
gone through the season unde
ieatrd and the other had won all its
panics, Big Game would still be a
toss-UD."
NO REAL UPSETS
Like others who analyze this
thin ? called Eig Game down to its
component parts, Marchie knows
past records have indicated the
ability of either team to "upset"
the other at will when quoted a
shortender.
Then, almost confidently, Marchie
leaned back in his chair and prom
ised that the Stanford eleven was
going to fieht every inch of the
way through this 48th Big Game.
"Up at Berkeley, they say we
Won't have the spirit. Well I say
we will hnVe it. This team has
shown a hig upsurge in mental pre
paredness and from that angle we
are pretty well off."
NEED ROOTERS
Schwartz emphatically upheld
the point that a poorly handled,-
lion-aggressive rooting section
could ruin the Indians faster than
a Bear touchdown.
"Our kids want a packed root
ing section," he continued, "and
they want it 100 per cent behind
them throughout the game, win,
lose, or draw."
Marchie thumbed through a thick
scrapbook that bloused over at the
corners, full of clippings of Cali
fornia's previous games.
He couldn't quite fathom the
Bears' showing against Oregon
State. It's a tough problem for any
one.
NEED T.D. DRIVE
Those Beavers, just last Saturday
given the lacing of their lives by
Stanford, licked California near the
season's beginning, 13-8.
"How do you account for that?"
we queried.
"I can't account for it in any rea
sonable way," Marchie replied.
"But I can tell you one fact, cold
and invincible: California has a po
tentially championship squad, but
the Bears just don't seem to have
the extra scoring punch that wins
football games."
JURKOVICH AGAIN
"But you never know when
Jurkovich or some other Blue and
Gold gent will break loose and start
that scoring punch that's been
missing so far," he explained.
"Look what the Bears did to
Washington. They won, 19-7, and
Stanford only beat that score by
one point, 20-7," Marchie went on
"Figure out that reversal of form
if you can," he demanded.
From our discussion it seemed
that Marchie is still pretty much
up in the air about who will win
tomorrow. He can't say the Indians

will for sure. He knows they should.
Strictly on form the Cards show an
advantage in most departments, and
the only real thing keeping Marchie
from stamping a victory on his club
is that he knows better than anyone
a wrong prediction before the game
is far worse than the congratula
tions that come to a winning coach

| who makes no specific stand.
So we wandered on* out of the
' coach's room with hope and sin
j cereness from one of the most won
| derful teachers of football we've
| ever met.
A soft-voiced man who's bring
ing Stanford back up the trail to
Big Game after a disastrous start

in the 1942 gridiron season.
And he doesn't stop tomorrow,
after Big Game, or after the follow
ing Saturday when Stanford meets
the Pre-Flight school here, hut he
goes on, joining the Stanford Rugby
coaching staff, helping to keep the
Stanford sporting picture alive and
glowing.
