# Eight Mural Teams to Clash In Season's Gridiron Finish
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Zeta Psi,
Firehouse, and El Cuadro will fight
it out for the 1942 Stanford intra
mural football championship when
they and four other teams—El Toro,
Encina 2W, Encina Basement, and
Phi Gamma Delta—enter the play
off rounds after Thanksgiving vaca
tions.
The fall race for entrance into
these playoffs has not been particu
larly close. Tbe eight teams which
won the league titles with perfect
records, 5-0, were generally con
ceded to be the "cream" when Harry
Wolter first released the schedules
in October.
There were two major upsets of
the quarter as far as these teams
were concerned—El Cuadro's 21-19
defeat of Phi Psi, and the Fiji's 3-0
upset of the Alpha Delts.
TOROS, FIJIS OUT?
There will be many followers who
object to our wholesale discounting
of the Toro and Fiji clubs. But on
the basis of competition faced, they
have had an easier time in reaching
the playoffs, and their attack hasn't
appeared to be the calibre of the
other four.
In re Encina, a late start has
robbed this league of interest that
is its normal receipt. It is seldom,
however, that an Encina team lasts
through to the title round, and this
year should not be the exception.
SUPPOSED MATCHING
Suppose that Harry Wolter de
cides to spot winner of League 1
against League 2, etc. (This is pure
conjecture.) The lineup would then
be Fiji-Deke, El Cuadro-El Toro,
Firehouse-Zeta Psi, Encina 2W-
Encina Basement. In this sort of a
set-up, the key match would be
Zete-Firehouse in the first round,
with Deke over Fiji, Cuadro over
Toro. In this setup, the Zete-Fire
house winner hits the finals versus
the winner of Deke-Cuadro.
Even though this is only guess
work. the last four teams should be
the semi-finalists. What have they
to offer?
FIREHOUSE CHANCES
firehouse, perennial winner, has
had to meet the claims that all
champs face . . . "they're slip
ping. They're not the same old
team."
But combine their obvious run
ning talents and their record of
wins over Kappa Sigs. Delts, Sigma
Nu, and Breakers. Add in that lit
tle quarter Jerry Roinsted, and the
very-potent Tom Krug e r, Bill
Berryessa, and Frank Farrell. These
men learned their ball with Monte
Pfyl, one of the sharpest mural
players in Stanford history.
Delta Kappa Epsilon is engi
neered by Bill Joslyn, a profession
ally trained man, and boasts a crew
from an athletic house. Bill Hooper
is an excellent pass-receiving line
man, and John Leddy, Ches Saroyen
and the others are fast. If they

By BILL HORNBY

j meet (he Firehouse, it will be a
! classic fight.
El Cuadro has Bob Fair and Bob
Hughey, perhaps the best pass com
bination in the league. If their re
serves were as well-rounded, there
would be no question as to their
; superiority. But Deke or Firehouse
I will be a mighty different story for
| these boys than DU. SAE. Med
School. That Phi Psi defeat is noth
| ing to laugh at, but 20-19 is still
J not too conclusive.
The Zetes are in much the same
position as the Dekes. Jim Ellis is
an exceptional football player, but
his squad can be stopped as dem
onstrated by the Sigma Chi's, who
would have had them except for a
j last minute bad break.
WINNERS PICKED
Therefore this observer nominates
I Delta Kappa Epsilon and the Fire-
I house to play for the 1942 trophy,
j (If they meet in the prelims, the
j winner should meet the Cuadros for
j the title.)
The outcome will be nearly a
! toss-up. But if you want to toss it
| up, and since it must come down
| either heads or tails, the Firehouse,
because this game is their sole
hobby, and because they know
blocking and running, will win their
fourth crown this year.

Encina Basement. In this sort of a
set-up, the key match would be
Zete-Firehouse in the first round,
with Deke over Fiji, Cuadro over
Toro. In this setup, the Zete-Fire
house winner hits the finals versus
the winner of Deke-Cuadro.
Even though this is only guess
work. the last four teams should be
the semi-finalists. What have they
to offer?
FIREHOUSE CHANCES
firehouse, perennial winner, has
had to meet the claims that all
champs face . . . "they're slip
ping. They're not the same old
team."
But combine their obvious run
ning talents and their record of
wins over Kappa Sigs. Delts, Sigma
Nu, and Breakers. Add in that lit
tle quarter Jerry Roinsted, and the
very-potent Tom Krug e r, Bill
Berryessa, and Frank Farrell. These
men learned their ball with Monte
Pfyl, one of the sharpest mural
players in Stanford history.
Delta Kappa Epsilon is engi
neered by Bill Joslyn, a profession
ally trained man, and boasts a crew
from an athletic house. Bill Hooper
is an excellent pass-receiving line
man, and John Leddy, Ches Saroyen
and the others are fast. If they

By BILL HORNBY

j meet (he Firehouse, it will be a
! classic fight.
El Cuadro has Bob Fair and Bob
Hughey, perhaps the best pass com
bination in the league. If their re
serves were as well-rounded, there
would be no question as to their
; superiority. But Deke or Firehouse
I will be a mighty different story for
| these boys than DU. SAE. Med
School. That Phi Psi defeat is noth
| ing to laugh at, but 20-19 is still
J not too conclusive.
The Zetes are in much the same
position as the Dekes. Jim Ellis is
an exceptional football player, but
his squad can be stopped as dem
onstrated by the Sigma Chi's, who
would have had them except for a
j last minute bad break.
WINNERS PICKED
Therefore this observer nominates
I Delta Kappa Epsilon and the Fire-
I house to play for the 1942 trophy,
j (If they meet in the prelims, the
j winner should meet the Cuadros for
j the title.)
The outcome will be nearly a
! toss-up. But if you want to toss it
| up, and since it must come down
| either heads or tails, the Firehouse,
because this game is their sole
hobby, and because they know
blocking and running, will win their
fourth crown this year.
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Zeta Psi,
Firehouse, and El Cuadro will fight
it out for the 1942 Stanford intra
mural football championship when
they and four other teams—El Toro,
Encina 2W, Encina Basement, and
Phi Gamma Delta—enter the play
off rounds after Thanksgiving vaca
tions.
The fall race for entrance into
these playoffs has not been particu
larly close. Tbe eight teams which
won the league titles with perfect
records, 5-0, were generally con
ceded to be the "cream" when Harry
Wolter first released the schedules
in October.
There were two major upsets of
the quarter as far as these teams
were concerned—El Cuadro's 21-19
defeat of Phi Psi, and the Fiji's 3-0
upset of the Alpha Delts.
TOROS, FIJIS OUT?
There will be many followers who
object to our wholesale discounting
of the Toro and Fiji clubs. But on
the basis of competition faced, they
have had an easier time in reaching
the playoffs, and their attack hasn't
appeared to be the calibre of the
other four.
In re Encina, a late start has
robbed this league of interest that
is its normal receipt. It is seldom,
however, that an Encina team lasts
through to the title round, and this
year should not be the exception.
SUPPOSED MATCHING
Suppose that Harry Wolter de
cides to spot winner of League 1
against League 2, etc. (This is pure

| these boys than DU. SAE. Med
School. That Phi Psi defeat is noth
| ing to laugh at, but 20-19 is still
J not too conclusive.
The Zetes are in much the same
position as the Dekes. Jim Ellis is
an exceptional football player, but
his squad can be stopped as dem
onstrated by the Sigma Chi's, who
would have had them except for a
j last minute bad break.
WINNERS PICKED
Therefore this observer nominates
I Delta Kappa Epsilon and the Fire-
I house to play for the 1942 trophy,
j (If they meet in the prelims, the
j winner should meet the Cuadros for
j the title.)
The outcome will be nearly a
! toss-up. But if you want to toss it
| up, and since it must come down
| either heads or tails, the Firehouse,
because this game is their sole
hobby, and because they know
blocking and running, will win their
fourth crown this year.
Delta Kappa Epsilon, Zeta Psi,
Firehouse, and El Cuadro will fight
it out for the 1942 Stanford intra
mural football championship when
they and four other teams—El Toro,
Encina 2W, Encina Basement, and
Phi Gamma Delta—enter the play
off rounds after Thanksgiving vaca
tions.
The fall race for entrance into
these playoffs has not been particu
larly close. Tbe eight teams which
won the league titles with perfect
records, 5-0, were generally con
ceded to be the "cream" when Harry
Wolter first released the schedules
in October.
There were two major upsets of
the quarter as far as these teams
were concerned—El Cuadro's 21-19
defeat of Phi Psi, and the Fiji's 3-0
upset of the Alpha Delts.
TOROS, FIJIS OUT?
There will be many followers who
object to our wholesale discounting
of the Toro and Fiji clubs. But on
the basis of competition faced, they
have had an easier time in reaching
the playoffs, and their attack hasn't
appeared to be the calibre of the
other four.
In re Encina, a late start has
robbed this league of interest that
is its normal receipt. It is seldom,
however, that an Encina team lasts
through to the title round, and this
year should not be the exception.
SUPPOSED MATCHING
Suppose that Harry Wolter de
cides to spot winner of League 1
against League 2, etc. (This is pure
conjecture.) The lineup would then
be Fiji-Deke, El Cuadro-El Toro,
Firehouse-Zeta Psi, Encina 2W-
Encina Basement. In this sort of a
set-up, the key match would be
Zete-Firehouse in the first round,
with Deke over Fiji, Cuadro over
Toro. In this setup, the Zete-Fire
house winner hits the finals versus
the winner of Deke-Cuadro.
Even though this is only guess
work. the last four teams should be
the semi-finalists. What have they
to offer?
FIREHOUSE CHANCES
firehouse, perennial winner, has
had to meet the claims that all
champs face . . . "they're slip
ping. They're not the same old
team."
But combine their obvious run
ning talents and their record of
wins over Kappa Sigs. Delts, Sigma
Nu, and Breakers. Add in that lit
tle quarter Jerry Roinsted, and the
very-potent Tom Krug e r, Bill
Berryessa, and Frank Farrell. These
men learned their ball with Monte
Pfyl, one of the sharpest mural
players in Stanford history.
Delta Kappa Epsilon is engi
neered by Bill Joslyn, a profession
ally trained man, and boasts a crew
from an athletic house. Bill Hooper
is an excellent pass-receiving line
man, and John Leddy, Ches Saroyen
and the others are fast. If they

By BILL HORNBY

j meet (he Firehouse, it will be a
! classic fight.
El Cuadro has Bob Fair and Bob
Hughey, perhaps the best pass com
bination in the league. If their re
serves were as well-rounded, there
would be no question as to their
; superiority. But Deke or Firehouse
I will be a mighty different story for
| these boys than DU. SAE. Med
