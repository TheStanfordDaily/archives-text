# Iowa Pre-Flighters Shun Post-Seasons
## 
### 
lowa Navy Pre-Flight School Sea
hawks, humblers of once-potent
Minnesota, announced yesterday
that they will be party to no post
season football games, unless other
wise notified by the Navy Depart
ment.
The announcement ended rumors
that the Seahawks might be matched
with another Pre-Flight team, or
possibly a collegiate champion, in
one of the bowl games on New
Year's Day.

"I was robbed by the referee," Jim
Casey said when consenting to a re
match with Jack (Sockeye) Mc-
Donald. Casey will meet McDonald
next Tuesday.
