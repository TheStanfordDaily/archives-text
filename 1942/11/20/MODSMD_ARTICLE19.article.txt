# ON CAMPUS AFFAIR
## 
### 
The Big Game was first made an
"on campus" affair in 1906. There
was a great deal of anxiety as to
the financial outcome of this game,
but the net returns exceeded all
expectations. Approximately $29,-
000 was cleared. This money was
shared equally by California and
Stanford.
