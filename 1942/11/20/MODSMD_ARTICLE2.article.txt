# Li'l Injun Tells Thoreau, '61-3 Cal Massacre'
## 
### LI'L INJUN 
(As Told to 11. D. Thorcau)
MEMORIAL STADIUM, BERKE
LEY, Nov. 21.—Most of the 65,000
damp spectators left the stadium
this afternoon still not believing
what they had seen, but the sta
tistics don't lie, and Stanford did
defeat California here today, 61-3.
The Bears' only tally came in the
fourth period when Jim Jurkovich,
after booting away the Bears'
chances all afternoon, finally booted
one through the goal posts for three
points. But other than this, Cali
fornia's eleven might just as well
have been in the stands for all the
good they did on the field.
When Stanford's left halfback
Ross Dana took the opening kick
ofT and ran it 87 yards to a touch
down through the entire Blue and
Gold team, no one in the stadium,
except for perhaps Marchie
Schwartz, realized that that would
be only one of nine—yes, nine
touchdowns scored by the Stanford
team.
There was no stopping thf In
dians as they rolled lip 2'.i first
downs, and 530 yards from scrim
mage. Every one of the 2H Cards
allowed to play in the game
looked like Supermen next to the
bedraggled Bears.
Stanford held a slight pre-game
edge, but even the boys on the team
didn't know what an easy time
they'd have in running through the
Cal line. Many thought it was the
Chicago Bears playing Berkeley j
High, in fact it might have been a
better game if Berkeley High had j
played.
Stanford was never on the de- I
fense at any point in the game. As
soon as Cal would get the ball, the
Indian forwards would charge at |
the Cal backs with such speed and
force, that the latter didn't even get
time to hold on to the ball, much
less execute either of the two plays
they had planned for the game.
As soon as Stanford got the ball, |
no matter who was running—Faw- ;
cett, Sheller, Shipkey, Dana, Zap- j
pettini, Sanderman, Frisbee, Mor
rison, Munroe, or Hoisch, he made
substantial yardage on each play.
But what was more surprising,
the Cal passing attack was com
pletely bottled up by fast rushing

and eagle-eyed covering, while ]
the little-used Cardinal passing
game was being run at perfection.
Long ones, short ones, Duke
Hammctt hit his receiver on every
pass.
Six long down-the-field marches
and three quick scores told the story
on the potent Stanford offense. Only
man that stood between the Indians
and 100 points was the man in the ,
striped shirt—the referee. Twice '
touchdown runs were nullified by
penalties. Three times touchdown
drives were stopped short by penal
lies, only to have the Indians surge
back again in two or three minutes.
Not once did Stanford punt the
hall. Not once did California get
into Stanford territory. Only
once did Cal make a first down—
that coming on a penalty. Only
once did Cal complete a pass—

| that one going for a three-yard
loss. Not once did California give
the Impression that they could
play varsity football.
How did today's Stanford team '
I stack up with the 1940 Shaugh- i
I nessy-coached outfit? This 1942
team surpassed the '41 Rose Bowl j
champs in every department. How
did today's Indians compare with
the Stanford eleven that took the
! field against Washington State in the
first game of this season. Only the
names of the players were the same.
1 The players themselves were en
! tirely different.
How Stanford can be kept out of
the Rose Bowl now, no matter what
the conference standings are, I don't
j know. But as it stands now. there
isn't a team on the coast capable of
beating the Stanford Indians, going
by today's performance.

MEMORIAL STADIUM, BERKE
LEY, Nov. 21.—Most of the 65,000
damp spectators left the stadium
this afternoon still not believing
what they had seen, but the sta
tistics don't lie, and Stanford did
defeat California here today, 61-3.
The Bears' only tally came in the
fourth period when Jim Jurkovich,
after booting away the Bears'
chances all afternoon, finally booted
one through the goal posts for three
points. But other than this, Cali
fornia's eleven might just as well
have been in the stands for all the
good they did on the field.
When Stanford's left halfback
Ross Dana took the opening kick
ofT and ran it 87 yards to a touch
down through the entire Blue and
Gold team, no one in the stadium,
except for perhaps Marchie
Schwartz, realized that that would
be only one of nine—yes, nine
touchdowns scored by the Stanford
team.
There was no stopping thf In
dians as they rolled lip 2'.i first
downs, and 530 yards from scrim
mage. Every one of the 2H Cards
allowed to play in the game
looked like Supermen next to the
bedraggled Bears.
Stanford held a slight pre-game
edge, but even the boys on the team
didn't know what an easy time
they'd have in running through the
Cal line. Many thought it was the
Chicago Bears playing Berkeley j
High, in fact it might have been a
better game if Berkeley High had j
played.
Stanford was never on the de- I
fense at any point in the game. As
soon as Cal would get the ball, the
Indian forwards would charge at |
the Cal backs with such speed and
force, that the latter didn't even get
time to hold on to the ball, much
less execute either of the two plays
they had planned for the game.
As soon as Stanford got the ball, |
no matter who was running—Faw- ;
cett, Sheller, Shipkey, Dana, Zap- j
pettini, Sanderman, Frisbee, Mor
rison, Munroe, or Hoisch, he made
substantial yardage on each play.
But what was more surprising,
the Cal passing attack was com
pletely bottled up by fast rushing

and eagle-eyed covering, while ]
the little-used Cardinal passing
game was being run at perfection.
Long ones, short ones, Duke
Hammctt hit his receiver on every
pass.
Six long down-the-field marches
and three quick scores told the story
on the potent Stanford offense. Only
man that stood between the Indians
and 100 points was the man in the ,
striped shirt—the referee. Twice '
touchdown runs were nullified by
penalties. Three times touchdown
drives were stopped short by penal
lies, only to have the Indians surge
back again in two or three minutes.
Not once did Stanford punt the
hall. Not once did California get
into Stanford territory. Only
once did Cal make a first down—
that coming on a penalty. Only
once did Cal complete a pass—

| that one going for a three-yard
loss. Not once did California give
the Impression that they could
play varsity football.

lies, only to have the Indians surge
back again in two or three minutes.
Not once did Stanford punt the
hall. Not once did California get
into Stanford territory. Only
once did Cal make a first down—
that coming on a penalty. Only
once did Cal complete a pass—

| that one going for a three-yard
loss. Not once did California give
the Impression that they could
play varsity football.
How did today's Stanford team '
I stack up with the 1940 Shaugh- i
I nessy-coached outfit? This 1942
team surpassed the '41 Rose Bowl j
champs in every department. How
did today's Indians compare with
the Stanford eleven that took the
! field against Washington State in the
first game of this season. Only the
names of the players were the same.
1 The players themselves were en
! tirely different.
How Stanford can be kept out of
the Rose Bowl now, no matter what
the conference standings are, I don't
j know. But as it stands now. there
isn't a team on the coast capable of
beating the Stanford Indians, going
by today's performance.

MEMORIAL STADIUM, BERKE
LEY, Nov. 21.—Most of the 65,000
damp spectators left the stadium
this afternoon still not believing
what they had seen, but the sta
tistics don't lie, and Stanford did
defeat California here today, 61-3.
The Bears' only tally came in the
fourth period when Jim Jurkovich,
after booting away the Bears'
chances all afternoon, finally booted
one through the goal posts for three
points. But other than this, Cali
fornia's eleven might just as well
have been in the stands for all the
good they did on the field.
When Stanford's left halfback
Ross Dana took the opening kick
ofT and ran it 87 yards to a touch
down through the entire Blue and
Gold team, no one in the stadium,
except for perhaps Marchie
Schwartz, realized that that would
be only one of nine—yes, nine
touchdowns scored by the Stanford
team.
There was no stopping thf In
dians as they rolled lip 2'.i first
downs, and 530 yards from scrim
mage. Every one of the 2H Cards
allowed to play in the game
looked like Supermen next to the
bedraggled Bears.
Stanford held a slight pre-game
edge, but even the boys on the team
didn't know what an easy time
they'd have in running through the
Cal line. Many thought it was the
Chicago Bears playing Berkeley j
High, in fact it might have been a
better game if Berkeley High had j
played.
Stanford was never on the de- I
fense at any point in the game. As
soon as Cal would get the ball, the
Indian forwards would charge at |
the Cal backs with such speed and
force, that the latter didn't even get
time to hold on to the ball, much
less execute either of the two plays
they had planned for the game.
As soon as Stanford got the ball, |
no matter who was running—Faw- ;
cett, Sheller, Shipkey, Dana, Zap- j
pettini, Sanderman, Frisbee, Mor
rison, Munroe, or Hoisch, he made
substantial yardage on each play.
But what was more surprising,
the Cal passing attack was com
pletely bottled up by fast rushing

and eagle-eyed covering, while ]
the little-used Cardinal passing
game was being run at perfection.
Long ones, short ones, Duke
Hammctt hit his receiver on every
pass.
Six long down-the-field marches
and three quick scores told the story
on the potent Stanford offense. Only
man that stood between the Indians
and 100 points was the man in the ,
striped shirt—the referee. Twice '
touchdown runs were nullified by
penalties. Three times touchdown
drives were stopped short by penal
lies, only to have the Indians surge
back again in two or three minutes.
Not once did Stanford punt the
hall. Not once did California get
into Stanford territory. Only
once did Cal make a first down—
that coming on a penalty. Only
once did Cal complete a pass—

| that one going for a three-yard
loss. Not once did California give
