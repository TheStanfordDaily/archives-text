# WE'LL' PLAY FOOTBALL NEXT YEAR'
## 'Stub' Predicts Grid To Last for Duration 
### BILL STEIF 
The big, brown man tilted back in
his chair and in a slow, deep voice
ventured the opinion that, war or
no war, football would continue to
be played throughout the United
States.
"The Stubber," as Leonard B. Al
lison is known throughout the na
tion, was in a philosophical mood.
He was trying to explain his atti
tude toward football and he was
thinking each word as he said it.
It was the morning of the Montana
game and Stanford was just around
the corner, but "Stub" was talking
not so much about specific football
games as about the game in gen
eral, about the game's greatness,
and its benefits to the country.
He started talking again and one
couldn't help but listen to him be
cause one could hear the intense
feeling with which Allison regarded
the whole subject in the utter sin
cerity of his words.
PERSHING LIKES GAME
"You know," he said, "I was over
in France when the Armistice was
signed in 1918 and do you know
what one of General Pershing's first
orders to his troops was?" We
didn't know, but we didn't have to.
"The ol' Sarge" answered the ques
tion himself.
"Pershing ordered all American
divisions in France to organize into
football leagues and he had the
two top teams in the service play
for the AEF championship in Paris.
That," continued Allison, "is what
HE thought of football."
He looked at us a little quizzi
cally, thinking, perhaps, we still
weren't convinced as to the bene
fits of football. Then he said, "Now
there have been a lot of sports
writers in the country, and on the
coast, and even in this Bay area
who have taken a negative atti
tude to football. They've said it's a
'racket' and that it hurts the boys
and that in wartime it takes too
much time and energy not only
from it's active participants but also
from the rest of the student body.
And that's especially true when
your team doesn't win every week."
He added, with a gleam of humor,
"I know."
POSITIVE VIEW
"But," he went on, "what would
happen if they looked at football in
a positive way?
"They would see that with all this
emphasis on physical fitness foot
ball is the one thing that really
enables a school to physically fit
its students. A little 130-pounder
may sit at his typewriter in the
school paper's office and carp at the
game, but that same little ISO-
Founder gets an awful kick out of
pounding a badminton bird all over
the gym. And what gives your
130-pounder a chance to wallop
that badminton bird? The gate re
ceipts from football.
"And it's the same thing for ten
nis and baseball and crew and soc
cer and whatever else you've got.
It's the gate from football that
builds those gyms and swimming
pools and tennis courts and, in fact,
often allows the school to get its
top-notch professors in the class
rooms."
lIAS HIS SAY
Then the man who rose from
sergeant to captain overseas in the
last war paused for a breath. He
had had this thing on his chest
and he wanted to have his say.
He pointed out that football was
the one thing that formed a real
rallying point for all of a student
body.
"It's important," he said, "be
cause at Big Game time, for in
stance, every student without ex
ception merges all his or her differ
ences. All over California, Stanford
men and women and California
men and women are no longer rich
or poor, row or hall, black or white,
Jew or Gentile, they're just Stan
ford men and women or California
men and women. And when that
Big Game afternoon rolls around
there's just one thing that counts—
win that game. It's American, dem
ocratic."
FOOTBALL GOES ON
"The Stubber" was relieved. He
had had his say. The intensity on
his weather-beaten, ruddy face
melted away and he smiled.
"You see," he continued, "one
man doesn't make any difference.
When I'm gone from Cal someone

else will take my place just as when
'Pop' Warner left Stanford and ev
eryone started moaning how irre
placeable he was and then some
one else came up with winning
football teams."
There was no egotism in his
statement. It was made calmly, al
most complacently.
And then Allison added, "I think
football is bigger than any ope
man or any one thing—and I do
think we'll keep right on playing it
because it has so many benefits."
When questioned about the ef
fect of gas rationing on football
next year Allisftn pointed out
that within a 50-mile radius right

i in the Bay Area are enough good
football teams to start a league
which would rate with any in the
, nation. And he added that "just
j a couple of hundred miles south
are three more top teams, USC,
UCLA, and Loyola."
We talked a little more, for there
j were still a couple of questions in
J our minds. Jurkovich? "In fine
1 shape," replied Allison, "and not
j 'goofy'—'A' students in Engineering
j are rarely 'gool'y.' "
Material next year? "Probably
| poorer," he said, "because a lot of
the best material Will go right into
! the Army or the Navy. But all
I football teams will notice the same

thing." Mental attitudes before
games? "Ninety per cent of a team's
'punch," ventured Allison, "comes
from a team's mental attitude be
fore a game. If I knew how to 'fire'
my boys up before every game I'd
retire with a couple of million
bucks."
Then it was time for us to leave.
It was a hard thing to do, because
we had found in 40 minutes a man
whose belief in football is sincere,
is honest, and is at the same time
admirably rational. At the same
time we knew this man is a fighter,
is one who won't shrink from a
scrap anywhere when he knows he
is right.

LEONARD B. "STUB" ALLISON
Head Football Coach, University of California
The big, brown man tilted back in
his chair and in a slow, deep voice
ventured the opinion that, war or
no war, football would continue to
be played throughout the United
States.
"The Stubber," as Leonard B. Al
lison is known throughout the na
tion, was in a philosophical mood.
He was trying to explain his atti
tude toward football and he was
thinking each word as he said it.
It was the morning of the Montana
game and Stanford was just around
the corner, but "Stub" was talking
not so much about specific football
games as about the game in gen
eral, about the game's greatness,
and its benefits to the country.
He started talking again and one
couldn't help but listen to him be
cause one could hear the intense
feeling with which Allison regarded
the whole subject in the utter sin
cerity of his words.
PERSHING LIKES GAME
"You know," he said, "I was over
in France when the Armistice was
signed in 1918 and do you know
what one of General Pershing's first
orders to his troops was?" We
didn't know, but we didn't have to.
"The ol' Sarge" answered the ques
tion himself.
"Pershing ordered all American
divisions in France to organize into
football leagues and he had the
two top teams in the service play
for the AEF championship in Paris.
That," continued Allison, "is what
HE thought of football."
He looked at us a little quizzi
cally, thinking, perhaps, we still
weren't convinced as to the bene
fits of football. Then he said, "Now
there have been a lot of sports
writers in the country, and on the
coast, and even in this Bay area
who have taken a negative atti
tude to football. They've said it's a
'racket' and that it hurts the boys
and that in wartime it takes too
much time and energy not only
from it's active participants but also
from the rest of the student body.
And that's especially true when
your team doesn't win every week."
He added, with a gleam of humor,
"I know."
POSITIVE VIEW
"But," he went on, "what would
happen if they looked at football in
a positive way?
"They would see that with all this
emphasis on physical fitness foot
ball is the one thing that really
enables a school to physically fit
its students. A little 130-pounder
may sit at his typewriter in the
school paper's office and carp at the
game, but that same little ISO-
Founder gets an awful kick out of
pounding a badminton bird all over
the gym. And what gives your
130-pounder a chance to wallop
that badminton bird? The gate re
ceipts from football.
"And it's the same thing for ten
nis and baseball and crew and soc
cer and whatever else you've got.
It's the gate from football that
builds those gyms and swimming
pools and tennis courts and, in fact,
often allows the school to get its
top-notch professors in the class
rooms."
lIAS HIS SAY
Then the man who rose from
sergeant to captain overseas in the
last war paused for a breath. He
had had this thing on his chest
and he wanted to have his say.
He pointed out that football was
the one thing that formed a real
rallying point for all of a student
body.
"It's important," he said, "be
cause at Big Game time, for in
stance, every student without ex
ception merges all his or her differ
ences. All over California, Stanford
men and women and California
men and women are no longer rich
or poor, row or hall, black or white,
Jew or Gentile, they're just Stan
ford men and women or California
men and women. And when that
Big Game afternoon rolls around
there's just one thing that counts—
win that game. It's American, dem
ocratic."
FOOTBALL GOES ON
"The Stubber" was relieved. He
had had his say. The intensity on
his weather-beaten, ruddy face
melted away and he smiled.
"You see," he continued, "one
man doesn't make any difference.
When I'm gone from Cal someone

else will take my place just as when
'Pop' Warner left Stanford and ev
eryone started moaning how irre
placeable he was and then some
one else came up with winning
football teams."
There was no egotism in his
statement. It was made calmly, al
most complacently.
And then Allison added, "I think
football is bigger than any ope
man or any one thing—and I do
think we'll keep right on playing it
because it has so many benefits."
When questioned about the ef
fect of gas rationing on football
next year Allisftn pointed out
that within a 50-mile radius right

i in the Bay Area are enough good
football teams to start a league
which would rate with any in the
, nation. And he added that "just
j a couple of hundred miles south
are three more top teams, USC,
UCLA, and Loyola."
We talked a little more, for there
j were still a couple of questions in
J our minds. Jurkovich? "In fine
1 shape," replied Allison, "and not
j 'goofy'—'A' students in Engineering
j are rarely 'gool'y.' "
Material next year? "Probably
| poorer," he said, "because a lot of
the best material Will go right into
! the Army or the Navy. But all
I football teams will notice the same

thing." Mental attitudes before
games? "Ninety per cent of a team's
'punch," ventured Allison, "comes
from a team's mental attitude be
fore a game. If I knew how to 'fire'
my boys up before every game I'd
retire with a couple of million
bucks."
Then it was time for us to leave.
It was a hard thing to do, because
we had found in 40 minutes a man
whose belief in football is sincere,
is honest, and is at the same time
admirably rational. At the same
time we knew this man is a fighter,
is one who won't shrink from a
scrap anywhere when he knows he

my boys up before every game I'd
retire with a couple of million
bucks."
Then it was time for us to leave.
It was a hard thing to do, because
we had found in 40 minutes a man
whose belief in football is sincere,
is honest, and is at the same time
admirably rational. At the same
time we knew this man is a fighter,
is one who won't shrink from a
scrap anywhere when he knows he
is right.


LEONARD B. "STUB" ALLISON
Head Football Coach, University of California
The big, brown man tilted back in
his chair and in a slow, deep voice
ventured the opinion that, war or
no war, football would continue to
be played throughout the United
States.
"The Stubber," as Leonard B. Al
lison is known throughout the na
tion, was in a philosophical mood.
He was trying to explain his atti
tude toward football and he was
thinking each word as he said it.
It was the morning of the Montana
game and Stanford was just around
the corner, but "Stub" was talking
not so much about specific football
games as about the game in gen
eral, about the game's greatness,
and its benefits to the country.
He started talking again and one
couldn't help but listen to him be
cause one could hear the intense
feeling with which Allison regarded
the whole subject in the utter sin
cerity of his words.
PERSHING LIKES GAME
"You know," he said, "I was over
in France when the Armistice was
signed in 1918 and do you know
what one of General Pershing's first
orders to his troops was?" We
didn't know, but we didn't have to.
"The ol' Sarge" answered the ques
tion himself.
"Pershing ordered all American
divisions in France to organize into
football leagues and he had the
two top teams in the service play
for the AEF championship in Paris.
That," continued Allison, "is what
HE thought of football."
He looked at us a little quizzi
cally, thinking, perhaps, we still
weren't convinced as to the bene
fits of football. Then he said, "Now
there have been a lot of sports
writers in the country, and on the
coast, and even in this Bay area
who have taken a negative atti
tude to football. They've said it's a
'racket' and that it hurts the boys
and that in wartime it takes too
much time and energy not only
from it's active participants but also
from the rest of the student body.
And that's especially true when
your team doesn't win every week."
He added, with a gleam of humor,
"I know."
POSITIVE VIEW
"But," he went on, "what would
happen if they looked at football in
a positive way?
"They would see that with all this
emphasis on physical fitness foot
ball is the one thing that really
enables a school to physically fit
its students. A little 130-pounder
may sit at his typewriter in the
school paper's office and carp at the
game, but that same little ISO-
Founder gets an awful kick out of
pounding a badminton bird all over
the gym. And what gives your
130-pounder a chance to wallop
that badminton bird? The gate re
ceipts from football.
"And it's the same thing for ten
nis and baseball and crew and soc
cer and whatever else you've got.
It's the gate from football that
builds those gyms and swimming
pools and tennis courts and, in fact,
often allows the school to get its
top-notch professors in the class
rooms."
lIAS HIS SAY
Then the man who rose from
sergeant to captain overseas in the
last war paused for a breath. He
had had this thing on his chest
and he wanted to have his say.
He pointed out that football was
the one thing that formed a real
rallying point for all of a student
body.
"It's important," he said, "be
cause at Big Game time, for in
stance, every student without ex
ception merges all his or her differ
ences. All over California, Stanford
men and women and California
men and women are no longer rich
or poor, row or hall, black or white,
Jew or Gentile, they're just Stan
ford men and women or California
men and women. And when that
Big Game afternoon rolls around
there's just one thing that counts—
win that game. It's American, dem
ocratic."
FOOTBALL GOES ON
"The Stubber" was relieved. He
had had his say. The intensity on
his weather-beaten, ruddy face
melted away and he smiled.
"You see," he continued, "one
man doesn't make any difference.
When I'm gone from Cal someone

else will take my place just as when
'Pop' Warner left Stanford and ev
eryone started moaning how irre
placeable he was and then some
one else came up with winning
football teams."
There was no egotism in his
statement. It was made calmly, al
most complacently.
And then Allison added, "I think
football is bigger than any ope
man or any one thing—and I do
think we'll keep right on playing it
because it has so many benefits."
When questioned about the ef
fect of gas rationing on football
next year Allisftn pointed out
that within a 50-mile radius right

i in the Bay Area are enough good
football teams to start a league
which would rate with any in the
, nation. And he added that "just
j a couple of hundred miles south
are three more top teams, USC,
UCLA, and Loyola."
We talked a little more, for there
j were still a couple of questions in
J our minds. Jurkovich? "In fine
1 shape," replied Allison, "and not
j 'goofy'—'A' students in Engineering
j are rarely 'gool'y.' "
Material next year? "Probably
| poorer," he said, "because a lot of
the best material Will go right into
! the Army or the Navy. But all
I football teams will notice the same

thing." Mental attitudes before
games? "Ninety per cent of a team's
'punch," ventured Allison, "comes
from a team's mental attitude be
fore a game. If I knew how to 'fire'
my boys up before every game I'd
retire with a couple of million
bucks."
Then it was time for us to leave.
It was a hard thing to do, because
we had found in 40 minutes a man

I football teams will notice the same

thing." Mental attitudes before
games? "Ninety per cent of a team's
'punch," ventured Allison, "comes
from a team's mental attitude be
fore a game. If I knew how to 'fire'
my boys up before every game I'd
retire with a couple of million
bucks."
Then it was time for us to leave.
It was a hard thing to do, because
we had found in 40 minutes a man
whose belief in football is sincere,
is honest, and is at the same time
admirably rational. At the same
time we knew this man is a fighter,
is one who won't shrink from a
scrap anywhere when he knows he
is right.


LEONARD B. "STUB" ALLISON
Head Football Coach, University of California
The big, brown man tilted back in
his chair and in a slow, deep voice
ventured the opinion that, war or
no war, football would continue to
be played throughout the United
States.
"The Stubber," as Leonard B. Al
lison is known throughout the na
tion, was in a philosophical mood.
He was trying to explain his atti
tude toward football and he was
thinking each word as he said it.
It was the morning of the Montana
game and Stanford was just around
the corner, but "Stub" was talking
not so much about specific football
games as about the game in gen
eral, about the game's greatness,
and its benefits to the country.
He started talking again and one
couldn't help but listen to him be
cause one could hear the intense
feeling with which Allison regarded
the whole subject in the utter sin
cerity of his words.
PERSHING LIKES GAME
"You know," he said, "I was over
in France when the Armistice was
signed in 1918 and do you know
what one of General Pershing's first
orders to his troops was?" We
didn't know, but we didn't have to.
"The ol' Sarge" answered the ques
tion himself.
"Pershing ordered all American
divisions in France to organize into
football leagues and he had the
two top teams in the service play
for the AEF championship in Paris.
That," continued Allison, "is what
HE thought of football."
He looked at us a little quizzi
cally, thinking, perhaps, we still
weren't convinced as to the bene
fits of football. Then he said, "Now
there have been a lot of sports
writers in the country, and on the
coast, and even in this Bay area
who have taken a negative atti
tude to football. They've said it's a
'racket' and that it hurts the boys
and that in wartime it takes too
much time and energy not only
from it's active participants but also
from the rest of the student body.
And that's especially true when
your team doesn't win every week."
He added, with a gleam of humor,
"I know."
POSITIVE VIEW
"But," he went on, "what would
happen if they looked at football in
a positive way?
"They would see that with all this
emphasis on physical fitness foot
ball is the one thing that really
enables a school to physically fit
its students. A little 130-pounder
may sit at his typewriter in the
school paper's office and carp at the
game, but that same little ISO-
Founder gets an awful kick out of
pounding a badminton bird all over
the gym. And what gives your
130-pounder a chance to wallop
that badminton bird? The gate re
ceipts from football.
"And it's the same thing for ten
nis and baseball and crew and soc
cer and whatever else you've got.
It's the gate from football that
builds those gyms and swimming
pools and tennis courts and, in fact,
often allows the school to get its
top-notch professors in the class
rooms."
lIAS HIS SAY
Then the man who rose from
sergeant to captain overseas in the
last war paused for a breath. He
had had this thing on his chest
and he wanted to have his say.
He pointed out that football was
the one thing that formed a real
rallying point for all of a student
body.
"It's important," he said, "be
cause at Big Game time, for in
stance, every student without ex
ception merges all his or her differ
ences. All over California, Stanford
men and women and California
men and women are no longer rich
or poor, row or hall, black or white,
Jew or Gentile, they're just Stan
ford men and women or California
men and women. And when that
Big Game afternoon rolls around
there's just one thing that counts—
win that game. It's American, dem
ocratic."
FOOTBALL GOES ON
"The Stubber" was relieved. He
had had his say. The intensity on
his weather-beaten, ruddy face
melted away and he smiled.
"You see," he continued, "one
man doesn't make any difference.
When I'm gone from Cal someone

else will take my place just as when
'Pop' Warner left Stanford and ev
eryone started moaning how irre
placeable he was and then some
one else came up with winning
football teams."
There was no egotism in his
statement. It was made calmly, al
most complacently.
And then Allison added, "I think
football is bigger than any ope
man or any one thing—and I do
think we'll keep right on playing it
because it has so many benefits."
When questioned about the ef
fect of gas rationing on football
next year Allisftn pointed out
that within a 50-mile radius right

i in the Bay Area are enough good
football teams to start a league
which would rate with any in the
, nation. And he added that "just
j a couple of hundred miles south
are three more top teams, USC,
UCLA, and Loyola."
We talked a little more, for there
j were still a couple of questions in
J our minds. Jurkovich? "In fine
1 shape," replied Allison, "and not
j 'goofy'—'A' students in Engineering
j are rarely 'gool'y.' "
Material next year? "Probably
| poorer," he said, "because a lot of
the best material Will go right into
! the Army or the Navy. But all
I football teams will notice the same

thing." Mental attitudes before
games? "Ninety per cent of a team's
'punch," ventured Allison, "comes
from a team's mental attitude be
fore a game. If I knew how to 'fire'
