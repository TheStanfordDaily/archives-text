# Another 'Big Game': Cardinal, California Bowlers to Meet
## 
### LEIGHT WILLIAMS 
Although many people don't real
ize it, there will be more than one
Big Game tomorrow. At 10:30 a.m.
the Stanford Varsity will renew
their yearly bowling feud with the
Cal Varsity at the College Bowl in
Oakland. It will be the first of
three matches that will be played
this year with the Bears.
The odds at the present time
seem to favor the Cal five, but the
men from Stanford are not to be
counted out of the match by any
means.
The Cal Varsity has Ed Von
Bronkhurst, a veteran and one of
the steadiest and best bowlers in
the northwest. Von Bronkhurst up
to a week ago had a 191 league
average, however, this week he hit
an unexpected slump wfhich
dragged the figure down to 185. He
will take to the alleys with the
highest average of the two teams.
WILKIE VETERAN
Floyd Wilkie; a veteran of last
year's team, is an in-and-out keg
ler with a 177 average. When in
form Wilkie is a hard man to top.
Either Wilkie or Von Bronkhurst
will anchor the Cal team, however,
the honor will probably fall to the
latter.
Rounding out the Bear team are
Captain D; n Brodie, a veteran, with
a 155 mark, Ed Winters, another
member of the 1941 team, with 168,
and Don Penner, a newcomer to
the list, with IGS.
This year Stanford will face Cal
with three new additions to their
squad. The only veterans that are
held over are Joe Byrne and Bill
Harms.
HOOK DELIVERY
Byrne, using a fast hook ball de
livery, proved to be a valuable
asset last year, and his steadiness
broke up many dubious matches.
At present Joe is carrying a 172
average, but this does not tell all
of the story. He will carry the
burden of the team's success from
the anchor position.
Harms joined the Varsity in the
latter part of the 1941 season and
bowled against Cal. At present he
Ls one of the mainstays of the Fiji
quintet in the College Intramural
Bowling League and has a 165 aver
age.
Guiding the Varsity will be Cap
tain Bill Allen who is bowling at a
160 clip. Allen has not as yet
reached his peak, and his average
is due for a sudden rise. He is new
to the squad, but received valuable
experience last year while captain
ing the Frosh team.
TIBBETTS AT 171
Completing the roster are Frank
Tibbctts, another Fiji man with 171,
and Don Richards with 165. Both
of these men are dangerous when
under pressure.
A composite total brings the Cal
team average to 850, while Stan-

ford holds an 832 team total. The
difference of 28 pins gives the ad
vantage to the Bears, but such a
slim margin means that the victory
can go either way.
The Stanford-California bowling
matches began in 1939, when a su
perior Farm team succeeded in tak
ing total pins and the first series.
The Indian Varsity has the honor
of being undefeated in complete
series games since the tournament
beginning.
STANFORD AGAIN
In 1940 Stanford again humbled
the Golden Bear, and concluded its
performance by annexing the then
new College Classic League. Roy
Terry, who captained the team, j
probably did more than any other
man in organizing the College Clas
sic, the first organized college bowl
ing tournament ever to take place
on the Pacific Coast.
Last year Stanford came up with
the most powerful collegiate bowl
ing contingent in the country, sunk
Cal once again, 2-1, to win the Col
lege Classic. In the latter match
the team shot a sensational 1033
game series which adds up to a 207
average per man. This should be
some sort of a collegiate record.
