# Cards Lead Cal In Game Wins
## 
### 
Stanford's lately amazing Big
Red team has met the so far un
impressing Bears from Berkeley in
47 Big Games. The Cardinals have
defeated Cal in 21 of the contests,
lost 18, while 8 games were fought
to a draw.
Nine of the classics, from 1906 to
1914, were rugby games, and the
rest were American football.
