# Card Swimmers To Battle Bears
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Strengthened by the return of
Captain Hadley Bacon, Stanford's
varsity water polo team heads for
Berkeley and revenge against the
California mermen tomorrow morn
ing. The game starts at 10:30. im
mediately following the freshman
game.
Bacon, who, cracked three ribs
two weeks ago, and the other two
cripples, Al Weeden and Dick Nar
ver, worked out most of the week
and seem to be in good shape.
Bacon, a senior, will start at one
forward position, while the two
other front rank swimmers will be
chosen from Emmett Cashin, Jack
Carpenter, Bill Mapel, and Don
Smith. Cashin and Mapel have been
playing first string this year, but
Carpenter, a junior, has shown up
very well in practice and is sure to
sec action.
SMITH SHIFTED
Smith, another senior, was shifted
to forward from a reserve guard
capacity to forward this week and
did very well. A fast, rugged swim
mer, Smith has great potentialities.
The probable starting backfield
will be composed of Narver and
Weeden, sophomore guard duo; Bob
Jones, senior center back; and Pete
Lee, goalie.
'The backfickl has been looking
much better in practice this week,"
said Coach Ernie Brandsten.
"They're in better shape now than
at any other time this season."
JONES OUTSTANDING
Upon Jones, considered to be the
outstanding man on the team, will
be the job of stopping Johnny Nor
ris, main California scoring threat.
Jones held Norris to one point, his
lowest point score in any game this
year, and then flipped in two goals
himself.
California won, 3-2, in a tight
game, but the Indians haven't done
any worse than split series since
1937, and they don't plan to make
1942 an exception.
