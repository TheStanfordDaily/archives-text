# Harriers Travel Against Cal In Strawberry Canyon Today
## 
### 
Stanford's cross-country squad travels to Berkeley this afternoon to
engage the California runners on the four-mile Strawberry Canyon
course at 4:15 p.m.
Coach Pitch Johnson will take an eleven-man team that also includes
three freshmen. Under a new conference rule, freshmen may compete in

varsity cross-country without en-,
dangering their eligibility. They
may run varsity for four years.
John Fulton, freshman half-mile
sensation of last year, injured a
tendon qn ' the inside of his left
ankle 10 days ago, and will not run.
He was rounding into shape very
nicely, and would have given the
Bear runners lots of contention.
Also missing from, the squad are
two men who scored against Cali
fornia here last year. They are Bob
Compton, varsity milor, and Russ
Collier.
Johnson is unable to determine
just who his number one runner
is, for different men have been
crossing the finish line during the
workouts. Little Bob Raitt has
bested the field, as have two sopho
mores, Bruce Meyer and Larry
Gray. Big Jim Disher has always
been in a contending position, and
may find the hilly California course
to his liking.
Jim Chamberlain, a transfer from

Chico State, is also showing lots of
promise, as is George Grimes.
Lloyd Cuff leads the freshman com
petitors.
The squad is: Jim Disher, Bob
! Raitt, George Grimes, Bruce Meyer,
i Larry Gray, A1 Rosenfeld, Jim
Chamberlain, Bob McLean, Lloyd
Cuff. Frank Nichols, and Bob
j Adam.
California Coach A1 Ragan has
I good men in Bill McCampbell, who
! won a time trial over the course
in impressive time last week, and
George Stein, A1 Johnson, and Tom
Brown.
