### BOB SONTAG 
OK NEVER. STANFORD FOREVER:
For the last time this Volume, or any other, we feather the Stanford
nest with a brace uf gridiron picks that scoff at form charts, laugh at
longshots, and boo at Beary pickers.
With the aid of seven swamis, six crystal balls, five ouija boards, four
Yoga, three fortune-telling machines, and five million goofy guys with
sensational picks of their own, we tab tomorrow's football winners:
STANFORD OVER CALIFORNIA BY 14
This 1942 Big Game could actually be a rout in favor of Marchic
Schwartz' Indians. Standing in the rain and watching the Redskins prac
tice in the last four days, we've arrived at the belief that their "highness"
will be held, and that California is in for the licking of the year. Still,
when one remembers the terrific upset last year, when the Cards were
favored around 1, caution and conservatism shroud this pick, which
if it were against any other team in the conference tomorrow, would read
"Stanford by millions."
WASHINGTON OVER UCLA BY (i
Taking a cue from the rainy weather, an upset is culled from the week's
menu with the Huskies figured to win by a touchdown—if it rains in Los
Angoles. Last Saturday Washington held none other than the St. Mary's
Pre-Flighters to a scoreless tic on a soggy field. Same conditions prevail
ing, the Huskies can defeat UCLA. Remember what Tommy Roblin and
his gang did to the Bruins on an off track? Same goes for Susick, Erick
son, et al.
OREGON OVER OREGON STATE BY 7
The Oregon-Oregon State clash presents as much possible upset as
does the California-Stanford game. Though Stanford walloped the Beav
ers, 49-13, home grounds will help the Staters a great deal. In this situa
tion Oregon State is analogous to California and Oregon to Stanford. The
analogy is a pip, but the outcome remains to be fought out.
SANTA CLARA OVER I'RE-FLIGIIT BY IS
This pick only counts if it rains for the Sunday battle at Kezar Stadium.
(Such reservation is capital and might go for the aforementioned Wash
ington tiff.) The Broncos are turning out to be the best team on the coast,
except for our own eleven and Southern California, also Washington State.
But that may start an argument, so on with the Broncos. II Washington
could keep Frankie Albeit, Nello Felashi, Vic Bottari and the remainder
uf the star-studded Pre-Flight roster from the goal line, the Broncos can
do it too and at the same time drive home for a couple T.D.'s themselves.

But that may start an argument, so on with the Broncos. II Washington
could keep Frankie Albeit, Nello Felashi, Vic Bottari and the remainder
uf the star-studded Pre-Flight roster from the goal line, the Broncos can
do it too and at the same time drive home for a couple T.D.'s themselves.
OK NEVER. STANFORD FOREVER:
For the last time this Volume, or any other, we feather the Stanford
nest with a brace uf gridiron picks that scoff at form charts, laugh at
longshots, and boo at Beary pickers.
With the aid of seven swamis, six crystal balls, five ouija boards, four
Yoga, three fortune-telling machines, and five million goofy guys with
sensational picks of their own, we tab tomorrow's football winners:
STANFORD OVER CALIFORNIA BY 14
This 1942 Big Game could actually be a rout in favor of Marchic
Schwartz' Indians. Standing in the rain and watching the Redskins prac
tice in the last four days, we've arrived at the belief that their "highness"
will be held, and that California is in for the licking of the year. Still,
when one remembers the terrific upset last year, when the Cards were
favored around 1, caution and conservatism shroud this pick, which
if it were against any other team in the conference tomorrow, would read
"Stanford by millions."
WASHINGTON OVER UCLA BY (i
Taking a cue from the rainy weather, an upset is culled from the week's
menu with the Huskies figured to win by a touchdown—if it rains in Los
Angoles. Last Saturday Washington held none other than the St. Mary's
Pre-Flighters to a scoreless tic on a soggy field. Same conditions prevail
ing, the Huskies can defeat UCLA. Remember what Tommy Roblin and
his gang did to the Bruins on an off track? Same goes for Susick, Erick
son, et al.
OREGON OVER OREGON STATE BY 7
The Oregon-Oregon State clash presents as much possible upset as
does the California-Stanford game. Though Stanford walloped the Beav
ers, 49-13, home grounds will help the Staters a great deal. In this situa
tion Oregon State is analogous to California and Oregon to Stanford. The
analogy is a pip, but the outcome remains to be fought out.
SANTA CLARA OVER I'RE-FLIGIIT BY IS
This pick only counts if it rains for the Sunday battle at Kezar Stadium.
(Such reservation is capital and might go for the aforementioned Wash
ington tiff.) The Broncos are turning out to be the best team on the coast,
except for our own eleven and Southern California, also Washington State.
