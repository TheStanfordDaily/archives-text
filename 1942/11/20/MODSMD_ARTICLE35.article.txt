# Card Netsters Outlook Good
## 
### 
Although Emery Neale is the
only returning man of the first six
of last year's varsity, the prospects
for this year's team are very good
according to Coach Elwyn Bugge.
Paul Wilson and Chuck Hutchi
son are the only other veterans re
turning to the squad.
Bob Rutledge and Ted Myers are
the two best players from last year's
frosh, but Bob Forbes, Dick Thom
as, Emery Rogers, Zook Sutton,
Bruce Wvlie, Jerry Fine, Terry
Mullin, and Jim Redding are also
out for the team.
TWO GOOD FROSII
Tom Van Fleet and Bob Keenan,
both of whom entered Summer
Quarter, are good players, and they
may be eligible for play in the
Spring Quarter.
Those men will probably make
up the roster of the varsity, but
John Thayer, Ralph Hays and Don
Salisbury may be added.
Although last year's team was
outstanding, Bugf>e expects the
squad this year to be very good.
No definite schedule has been
drawn up yet. League play will
begin sometime in the Spring Quar
ter.
LADDER TO BE MADE
As soon as the varsity tennis
tournament, which is now being
played, is finished, a ladder will
be made up.
The tentative line-up for doubles
includes Neil and Wilson, Thomas
and Myers, Rutledge and Van Fleet,
Hutchison and Sutton, Forbes and
Wylie. A doubles tournament v/ill
be played off after the singles.
Bugge has nothing to report con
cerning the frosh team, but there
seem to be a number of prospects.
