# American Bowling Congress Cancelled
## 
### 
The American Bowling Congress
for 1943 has been cancelled in an ac
tion taken yesterday due to the war
emergency. The decision halted
plans being made in Buffalo, New
York, for the March 18-May 19
meeting.
Transportation difficulties were
the main factor in the decision. News
of the group's action will be trans
mitted to National Director of De
fense, Joseph Eastman.
