## 
### 
Hoping to salvage some glory
out of a none too successful sea
son, Stanford's fencers close their
fall season tonight when they
cross swords with the California
Bears at Berkeley.
"For the first time this season
we'll lie up against a team ni our
own class," says Coach Elwyn
Bugge. With one exception when
they notched their only win of the
season, the Indians have been
outclassed by teams who were far
more evpericnccd than they were.
Because both teams are on the
same experience level, Bugge.
who has heard no exceptional
tales of C'al greatness, figures to
night's contest a tosMip cither
way.
Stanford's five-man team in
cludes Harvard Lomax, Al Ho
dden. Jack Recs. Bill Perkins and
John Carr.
Lomax was selected captain of the
Stanford team yesterday.
