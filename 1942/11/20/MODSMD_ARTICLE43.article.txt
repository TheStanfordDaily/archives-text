# Frosh Mermen To Meet Cal
## 
### 
Aiming for an undefeated sea
son, Stanford's freshman water polo
team journeys to Berkeley tomor
row morning to tangle with the
California freshmen at 9:30 o'clock
in the second game of their tjvo
game scries.
The Papeese swimmers made a
partial atonement for two Stan
ford frosh defeats by Cal in 1941
by dumping the Bear Cubs, 8-5, last
week-end. Another victory tomor
row will mean an undefeated sea
son for the Encinamen.
STOP ARMSTRONG'
"Stop Armstrong and you stop
California" might be the Indian
slogan for Bob Armstrong, Cub for
ward, scored all 5 of his team's
noints. Walt Lull, Stanford center
back, has worked all week on de
fense to stop Armstrong, and Coach
Ernie Brandsten thinks he can do it.
Stanford's more diversified attack
should be enough to top Cal. Judg
ing from past results, every man on
the team is a potential scoring
threat. Five men contributed to the
Indians' 8 points last week.
LIVINGSTON AT SPRINT
Captain Jim Livingston at sprint,
Hugh West and Russell Lee at for
wards, Lull at center back, Barrett
Weber and Clyde Bruch at guards,
and Dick Stanwood at goalie are
the probable starters.
Livingston, Lee, and West each
scored two points against Caliior
nia ,and have scored consistently
in games this year.
Gordon Farrar and John Rhodes
are two reserves who should see
action.
