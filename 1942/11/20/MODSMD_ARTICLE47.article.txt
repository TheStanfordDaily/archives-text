# Packed House Previews Last Gaieties Rehearsal; Exhibits Loud Approval
## Quick-Hitting Skits, Perfect Timing Was Interrupted Only by Applause, Laughter of Enthusiastic Audience 
### JANE GLASSON 
A nearly parked house previewed the Big Game Gaieties of li>42 at the
final dress rehearsal last night.
An "in-group" of soldiers and football stalwarts vigorously enjoyed
I lie round of quick-hitting skits, the brilliantly staged musicals, and
audibly exhibited approval of the Ram's Head brain-baby.

Director Bob O'Neill ostensibly*
ran the final rehearsal according
to perfect timing and running
.schedule, but even this motive was
upset by interruptions of hilarious
laughter and applause, and the
production crew realized the need
for something they hadn't yet
counted on—encores.
We watched Dick Rabbett,
sleeves rolled up, baton in hand,
drawing amazing things from the
orchestra; wc noticed the pleased
expressions on the faces of Hal
Levitt and Joyce Henderson as the
rich drapes registered the soft
lighting; and we were pleased with
the smooth way Paul Hosteller kept
the behind-stage-pace rolling.
But most of al! we watched "Rob
in" O'Neill on his flights up and
down the aisles, firing notes to his
secretary, Pat Palmer, and keeping
tab on each person in the huge
production. Once we heard him
murmur:
NO WORRIES
"I'm going mad—after all these
weeks—the performance is tomor
row and the way the show is going
I don't have a single thing to worry
about!"
This year's show has enjoyed
many more advantages than pre
vious Gaieties.
First of all, the production staff
agrees that this all-student or
chestra is not only sensational, but
is also a terrific rehearsal asset, be- j
cause it has been able to rehearse i
for weeks with the singers and !
dancers, when previous bands had
only three rehearsals before per
formance.
Another thing, the Gaieties has
an excellent technical staff and
smoothly working integration of
jobs in the various technical de
partments, which keeps the show
rolling at the desired fast pace.
SURPLUS OF MATERIAL
"We've had a surplus of good ma-
cohimented O'Neill, "and
one of the hardest jobs was decid
ing what to cut. Constant tailor
ing and balancing has finally
brought us just the show the cam
fill, tuneful, and fast."
Among surprises for Gaieties
goers arc the talents of several [
newcomers, comics and singers.
Harry Dyck is the kind of come
dian that becomes a tradition al- |
most overnight, and he is being ,
joined in his riots by the old cam- J
pus favorites, John Lawry and John
Boucher, who cavort throughout j
Ihe show.
New voices to Ram's Head pro- ■
ductions arc those of Kathic Bax
ter, Nan Tillson, Gini Lacy, and
Don Landale, which seem a veri- !
table shower of beautiful, pear
shaped tones to add to the singing ;
of Barbara Moore and Dick Payne. !
lIUCiE CAST
Beamed O'Neill, "We've got a
huge east in this Gaieties, and the
noticeable thing about it is the
way the people co-ordinate their
changes and meet their strict run- ;
ning schedules, a pleasant surprise, |
that, but one of many.
One of the most important fac- j
tors in the rapid-fire pace is the i
unit set, a Levitt masterpiece, al
lowing complete freedom of move- j
mcnt and lighting and doing away j
with ponderous set changes.
