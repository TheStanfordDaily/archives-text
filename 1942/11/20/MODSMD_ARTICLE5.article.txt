# 'Man on Street' Backs Indians; Connolly, Sullivan in Bear Rut
## 
### BILL HORNBY ED LUCE 
Eight of the twelve leading San
Francisco sportswriters arc back
ing Stanford's rejuvenated T to win
the 1942 Big Game in convincing
fashion.
From the nests of the critics a
few, notably Will Connolly of the
Chronicle and Prescott Sullivan of
the Examiner, arc viewing Stan
ford's present activities as a "flash
in the pan." They're looking for
another edition of the 194.1 upset.
But the swingback of the Mar
ohie Schwartz charges in the Wash
ington and OSC games, especially
the new fire picked up by the back
field in the Beaver game, pushes
Big Game 1942 odds behind Li'l In
jun as he goes after the mangy bear
of Berkeley for the 48th time.
Here are the eight death knells
for Cal and the four warnings for
Stanford:
Bill I ,ciscr. San Francisco Chron
icle: "Stanford will win by 20
points, with Buck Fawcett and Don
Zappctini clicking and Bay Ilam
mett's passes connecting."
Will Connolly, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Cal wins, 13-7, Passes
from Frankie Porto and Jim Jurko
vieh to Johnny Ferguson and Harry
Agler will hit Stanford's weak
point, pass defense. Stanford will
find more trouble running here
than against OSC, which hadn't
worked up much interest for the
game."
Bob Slovens, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Stanford, 20-0. Stan
ford speed and Hammett's new
found ability to pass will be the
main victory points. Cal'a passes
won't click against the Indians."

For posterity or whatever you
wish, I tramped the streets of San
Francisco Wednesday afternoon in
search of a solution to the question
of the day, "Who will win the Big
Game?"
1 picked San Francisco because I i
figured I would get unbiased opin
ions from neutral natives. They
weren't neutral, and they weren't
natives, but they offered some
mighty choice ideas on the subject,
and thus this yarn.
The consensus, while worth ab
solutely nothing, gives the Farm
hands a 16 to 12 advantage, but there
are some mighty powerful Bear
statements in the collection.
You want to know what they
said? Here are 21] of the choicer
gems in original, uncensored form.
San Francisco's picks for 1942's Big
Game champion.
A1 Tassi, football coach, Univer
sity of San Francisco: "I've seen the
two teams in action only once this
year, but if there is an edge, it
would have to go to Stanford on its
strong line. It's going to be a \tcry
close ball game, and I wish both
teams and their coaches the best
of luck."
Arthur Brown, Jr., supervisor at
large of the city of San Francisco:
"Cal showed last year that they
could master the T, and I think they
can do it again."
I-. Molinar, bartender, Dawn
Club: "I don't know why but I just
like Stanford. Call it a hunch if
you like."
IVfciricl Keller, flower saleslady,
Palace Hotel: "I want Cal to win,
but everybody says Stanford will
win, so I guess they will."
Elevator man. Palace Hotel:
"Don't know, don't care. I'm in this
; damn thing all day and all night.
Never see a paper, how the hell
j should I know who's going to win!"
Murray MU Williams, salesman,
Roos Bros.: "I'll take Stanford. The
Indians have played good bail all
| year and seem to have more fire
j lhan Cal."
Hubert Jones, bootblack, Palace
Hotel: "Ah lost five bucks on last
week's game so ah rightly don't
i know. Who's playing, anyway?
Well, in that case ah guess nh'll
have to take California, but ah
wouldn't bet any money on it."
Henry Bu.vso, orchestra leader:
"Stanford. The Indians started
poorly, you'll have to admit that,
but in the last two games they
have really been marvelous. Cal.
