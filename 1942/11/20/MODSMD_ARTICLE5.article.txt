# 'Man on Street' Backs Indians; Connolly, Sullivan in Bear Rut
## 
### BILL HORNBY ED LUCE 
Eight of the twelve leading San
Francisco sportswriters arc back
ing Stanford's rejuvenated T to win
the 1942 Big Game in convincing
fashion.
From the nests of the critics a
few, notably Will Connolly of the
Chronicle and Prescott Sullivan of
the Examiner, arc viewing Stan
ford's present activities as a "flash
in the pan." They're looking for
another edition of the 194.1 upset.
But the swingback of the Mar
ohie Schwartz charges in the Wash
ington and OSC games, especially
the new fire picked up by the back
field in the Beaver game, pushes
Big Game 1942 odds behind Li'l In
jun as he goes after the mangy bear
of Berkeley for the 48th time.
Here are the eight death knells
for Cal and the four warnings for
Stanford:
Bill I ,ciscr. San Francisco Chron
icle: "Stanford will win by 20
points, with Buck Fawcett and Don
Zappctini clicking and Bay Ilam
mett's passes connecting."
Will Connolly, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Cal wins, 13-7, Passes
from Frankie Porto and Jim Jurko
vieh to Johnny Ferguson and Harry
Agler will hit Stanford's weak
point, pass defense. Stanford will
find more trouble running here
than against OSC, which hadn't
worked up much interest for the
game."
Bob Slovens, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Stanford, 20-0. Stan
ford speed and Hammett's new
found ability to pass will be the
main victory points. Cal'a passes
won't click against the Indians."

For posterity or whatever you
wish, I tramped the streets of San
Francisco Wednesday afternoon in
search of a solution to the question
of the day, "Who will win the Big
Game?"
1 picked San Francisco because I i
figured I would get unbiased opin
ions from neutral natives. They
weren't neutral, and they weren't
natives, but they offered some
mighty choice ideas on the subject,
and thus this yarn.
The consensus, while worth ab
solutely nothing, gives the Farm
hands a 16 to 12 advantage, but there
are some mighty powerful Bear
statements in the collection.
You want to know what they
said? Here are 21] of the choicer
gems in original, uncensored form.
San Francisco's picks for 1942's Big
Game champion.
A1 Tassi, football coach, Univer
sity of San Francisco: "I've seen the
two teams in action only once this
year, but if there is an edge, it
would have to go to Stanford on its
strong line. It's going to be a \tcry
close ball game, and I wish both
teams and their coaches the best
of luck."
Arthur Brown, Jr., supervisor at
large of the city of San Francisco:
"Cal showed last year that they
could master the T, and I think they
can do it again."
I-. Molinar, bartender, Dawn
Club: "I don't know why but I just
like Stanford. Call it a hunch if
you like."
IVfciricl Keller, flower saleslady,
Palace Hotel: "I want Cal to win,
but everybody says Stanford will
win, so I guess they will."
Elevator man. Palace Hotel:
"Don't know, don't care. I'm in this
; damn thing all day and all night.
Never see a paper, how the hell
j should I know who's going to win!"
Murray MU Williams, salesman,
Roos Bros.: "I'll take Stanford. The
Indians have played good bail all
| year and seem to have more fire
j lhan Cal."
Hubert Jones, bootblack, Palace
Hotel: "Ah lost five bucks on last
week's game so ah rightly don't
i know. Who's playing, anyway?
Well, in that case ah guess nh'll
have to take California, but ah
wouldn't bet any money on it."
Henry Bu.vso, orchestra leader:
"Stanford. The Indians started
poorly, you'll have to admit that,
but in the last two games they
have really been marvelous. Cal.

Jimmy McGee, San Francisco
Call-Bulletin: "Stanford will win
about three touchdowns to one. j
They've got so much new that I
don't know where to pick the win
ning points. Hammett. Fawcett, and
Art Shipkey will figure largely."
Nelson Cullenward, San Francis
co Call-Bulletin: Cullenward, al
though not available for question
ing, has watched Cal in every game i
this year and is listed as picking j
them to win.
Frnie Cope, San Francisco News:
Away on vacation, Cope is reported
to favor Stanford.
Marry Botha, San Francisco Ex
aminer: "I like Stanford, probably
a close one, about 14-7."
Prescott Sullivan, San Francisco
Examiner: "I'll pick Cal. They'll do j
at least as well as last year, about I
16-0. Jurkovich is better this year, I
and Stanford hasn't got 100 much." j
Curly Grieve, San Francisco Ex- [
aminer: "California's Jurkovich will j
pass 'em and run 'em dizzy to com- i
plete an upset in a season of big
upsets."
Tom Laird, San Francisco News:
"Stanford's riding high. I stick to a j
fast-coming team."
Ed Neal, San Francisco News: [
"If the Indians are up to their OSC j
performance, i( will be a rout. I'd
say about 21-7 now, but if they
get going it will be better than
that."

game."
Shipyard worker (wouldn't give j

about it. I just came out here from
Oklahoma a couple of weeks ago."
Fred Fox, bartender, Top o' the
Mark: "Cal always seems to be
more fired up for the Big Game
than Stanford. Neither team is very
good, in fact I call it 'the battle of
the bums,' but I think Cal will win."
Waily Brady, member Henry
Busse orchestra: "If Marchie
Schwartz is operating the way he
used to at Creighton, nnd I hear he
is, Stanford can't lose."
Betty Brownell, vocalist, Henry
Busse orchestra: "All the boys in
the band seem to like Stanford, so
I'll pick Cal on general principles."
Rube Leonard, operator Sterling

Division: "I guess Stanford will
take 'em.
Edward Royers, sailor, Treasure

ter backfield, good line, and lots
of power."
Fddie Ladner, bellboy, Palace
Hotel: "Stanford ought to be in top
shape for this one. Besides, they
have a lot better record than Cal,
don't they?"
It. Hogle, taxi driver: "I've got a
hunch Cal will win. I don't think
we ever play anything but hunches.
We get the hunch then build the
argument around it, at least I do."
Florence She id, flower saleslady,
Palace Hotel: "Cal always wins. It
would be nice to see Stanford win,
but I doubt if they can; they never
do."
Bruce Collins, high school stu
dent at Lick Wilmerding: "Stanford
has the best team, so I think they
will come out on top."
Larry Backus, salesman, Roos
Bros.: "Stanford by 20 points. I
can't see anybody picking Cal this
time."
Jim Martin, newsboy, corner of
Kearny and Market: "Cal can't lose
for two reasons. One is that I've got
two sons going there, and the other
is that they have the better team."
Edith Turner, gift shop proprie
tress, Joe Di Maggio's cafe: "I think
I'll pick Stanford. They've been
improving all the time. Anyway, I
like Stanford better."
Bob Brown, shuffle rhythm spe
cialist, Henry Busse orchestra:
"Stanford will win this time. Cal
is disorganized."
Drunk on the corner of Fifth and

For posterity or whatever you
wish, I tramped the streets of San
Francisco Wednesday afternoon in
search of a solution to the question
of the day, "Who will win the Big
Game?"
1 picked San Francisco because I i
figured I would get unbiased opin
ions from neutral natives. They
weren't neutral, and they weren't
natives, but they offered some
mighty choice ideas on the subject,
and thus this yarn.
The consensus, while worth ab
solutely nothing, gives the Farm
hands a 16 to 12 advantage, but there
are some mighty powerful Bear
statements in the collection.
You want to know what they
said? Here are 21] of the choicer
gems in original, uncensored form.
San Francisco's picks for 1942's Big
Game champion.
A1 Tassi, football coach, Univer
sity of San Francisco: "I've seen the
two teams in action only once this
year, but if there is an edge, it
would have to go to Stanford on its
strong line. It's going to be a \tcry
close ball game, and I wish both
teams and their coaches the best
of luck."
Arthur Brown, Jr., supervisor at
large of the city of San Francisco:
"Cal showed last year that they
could master the T, and I think they
can do it again."
I-. Molinar, bartender, Dawn
Club: "I don't know why but I just
like Stanford. Call it a hunch if
you like."
IVfciricl Keller, flower saleslady,
Palace Hotel: "I want Cal to win,
but everybody says Stanford will
win, so I guess they will."
Elevator man. Palace Hotel:
"Don't know, don't care. I'm in this
; damn thing all day and all night.
Never see a paper, how the hell
j should I know who's going to win!"
Murray MU Williams, salesman,
Roos Bros.: "I'll take Stanford. The
Indians have played good bail all
| year and seem to have more fire
j lhan Cal."
Hubert Jones, bootblack, Palace
Hotel: "Ah lost five bucks on last
week's game so ah rightly don't
i know. Who's playing, anyway?
Well, in that case ah guess nh'll
have to take California, but ah
wouldn't bet any money on it."
Henry Bu.vso, orchestra leader:
"Stanford. The Indians started
poorly, you'll have to admit that,
but in the last two games they
have really been marvelous. Cal.
with that boy Jurkovich, will be
Jimmy McGee, San Francisco
Call-Bulletin: "Stanford will win
about three touchdowns to one. j
They've got so much new that I
don't know where to pick the win
ning points. Hammett. Fawcett, and
Art Shipkey will figure largely."
Nelson Cullenward, San Francis
co Call-Bulletin: Cullenward, al
though not available for question
ing, has watched Cal in every game i
this year and is listed as picking j
them to win.
Frnie Cope, San Francisco News:
Away on vacation, Cope is reported
to favor Stanford.
Marry Botha, San Francisco Ex
aminer: "I like Stanford, probably
a close one, about 14-7."
Prescott Sullivan, San Francisco
Examiner: "I'll pick Cal. They'll do j
at least as well as last year, about I
16-0. Jurkovich is better this year, I
and Stanford hasn't got 100 much." j
Curly Grieve, San Francisco Ex- [
aminer: "California's Jurkovich will j
pass 'em and run 'em dizzy to com- i
plete an upset in a season of big
upsets."
Tom Laird, San Francisco News:
"Stanford's riding high. I stick to a j
fast-coming team."
Ed Neal, San Francisco News: [
"If the Indians are up to their OSC j
performance, i( will be a rout. I'd
say about 21-7 now, but if they
get going it will be better than
that."

tough. Looks like a tight ball I
game."
Shipyard worker (wouldn't give j
his name): "Don't know nuthin !
about it. I just came out here from
Oklahoma a couple of weeks ago."
Fred Fox, bartender, Top o' the
Mark: "Cal always seems to be
more fired up for the Big Game
than Stanford. Neither team is very
good, in fact I call it 'the battle of
the bums,' but I think Cal will win."
Waily Brady, member Henry
Busse orchestra: "If Marchie
Schwartz is operating the way he
used to at Creighton, nnd I hear he
is, Stanford can't lose."
Betty Brownell, vocalist, Henry
Busse orchestra: "All the boys in
the band seem to like Stanford, so
I'll pick Cal on general principles."
Rube Leonard, operator Sterling
Service Station, corner of 10th and
Division: "I guess Stanford will
take 'em.
Edward Royers, sailor, Treasure
Island: "Stanford. They have a bet
ter backfield, good line, and lots
of power."
Fddie Ladner, bellboy, Palace
Hotel: "Stanford ought to be in top
shape for this one. Besides, they
have a lot better record than Cal,
don't they?"
It. Hogle, taxi driver: "I've got a
hunch Cal will win. I don't think
we ever play anything but hunches.
We get the hunch then build the
argument around it, at least I do."
Florence She id, flower saleslady,
Palace Hotel: "Cal always wins. It
would be nice to see Stanford win,
but I doubt if they can; they never
do."
Bruce Collins, high school stu
dent at Lick Wilmerding: "Stanford
has the best team, so I think they
will come out on top."
Larry Backus, salesman, Roos
Bros.: "Stanford by 20 points. I
can't see anybody picking Cal this
time."
Jim Martin, newsboy, corner of
Kearny and Market: "Cal can't lose
for two reasons. One is that I've got
two sons going there, and the other
is that they have the better team."
Edith Turner, gift shop proprie
tress, Joe Di Maggio's cafe: "I think
I'll pick Stanford. They've been
improving all the time. Anyway, I
like Stanford better."
Bob Brown, shuffle rhythm spe
cialist, Henry Busse orchestra:
"Stanford will win this time. Cal
is disorganized."
Drunk on the corner of Fifth and
Mission: "Huh? Leave me alone,
can't you see I'm busy?"
Eight of the twelve leading San
Francisco sportswriters arc back
ing Stanford's rejuvenated T to win
the 1942 Big Game in convincing
fashion.
From the nests of the critics a
few, notably Will Connolly of the
Chronicle and Prescott Sullivan of
the Examiner, arc viewing Stan
ford's present activities as a "flash
in the pan." They're looking for
another edition of the 194.1 upset.
But the swingback of the Mar
ohie Schwartz charges in the Wash
ington and OSC games, especially
the new fire picked up by the back
field in the Beaver game, pushes
Big Game 1942 odds behind Li'l In
jun as he goes after the mangy bear
of Berkeley for the 48th time.
Here are the eight death knells
for Cal and the four warnings for
Stanford:
Bill I ,ciscr. San Francisco Chron
icle: "Stanford will win by 20
points, with Buck Fawcett and Don
Zappctini clicking and Bay Ilam
mett's passes connecting."
Will Connolly, San Francisco
Chronicle: "Cal wins, 13-7, Passes
from Frankie Porto and Jim Jurko
