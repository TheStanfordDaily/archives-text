# Nottingham Plays for Dance Tomorrow
## 
### 
The Big Game dance, to be pre
sented in the Women's Gym to
morrow night from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.,
promises to be the finest formal
that Stanford has seen in many
years, according to Ted Eberle,
chairman of the dance.
Eberle, elaborating on this state
ment, said: "I believe the success
of the Lagunita-Union Formal of
several weeks ago is indicative of
the type of dance which Stanford
wants and needs. Our committee
has put in many hours of hard work
on this dance, and I believe it will
fully come up to the expectations
of every Stanford student."
It was decided to hold this year's
Big Game dance, the Red and White
Ball, in the Women's Gym in order
to conform with Stanford's wartime
policy of having as many big func
tions on campus as possible and also
to afford students an opportunity to
save tires and gas. In addition, the
traditional dance this year has the
added advantage of allowing Stan
ford men more time with their
dales, because of the fact that one
hour has been sliced from women's
Big Game night late leaves.
The dance committee received a

I great stroke of luck when it signed j
! up Gary Nottingham's band for the
| dance. Cal's Big Game dance com
; mittee had been dickering with
[ Nottingham for some weeks before |
| the Farm committee heard that j
Nottingham had not yet been signed |
up, and, acting swiftly and surely, i

Ward Cooper and Mary Jane
j Sumner were the winners of the
two free Big Game dance tickets
j given away by the "Pot-O-Goid
method'' at last night's Big Game
j rally. The name of Majorie Lou
ise Hastings was called also, but
she was not present.

Stanford's Big Game dance com- i
mittee stepped l ight, in and signed
iNottingham right under Cal's col
lective noses.
Gary Nottingham's band is one
of the best-known "name" bands
on the West Coast and is noted for i
j the danceablc music which it i
I plays.
Bids to this year's dance are j
j priced at $2.7. r >, a sizeable reduc
tion from the price of last year's
I tickets. Bids may be obtained at
the A.S.S.U. office from 5) a.m. to r>

p.m. today or may be purchased at
the door of the Women's Gym to
morrow night. However, since over
100 tickets have already been sold
to the dance, chairman Eberle ad
vises that "those who plan to go to
the Ball better get their tickets
quickly."
Another feature of this dance will
be the war corsages that, will br
sold for the dance at the A.S.S.U.
office today and at the door lead
iny into the Women's Gym. These
will he composed of war stamps and
are being made up by the Stanford
War Board.
June Ellis and Jack Monteverdc,
co-chairmen of the dance's decora
tions committee, are working on
the dance's decorations and expect
to have the gym in stunning shape
by tomorrow night. An arrange
ment has also been made with Rally
Committee whereby the Axe will
be on display in the gym, if Stan
ford wins tomorrow's game.

MOUNTAIN VIEW, Nov. 19 (U.R)-
F'ublisher Samuel H. Winklebleek of
the Redwood' City Tribune died to
day at the age of 42. He had been ill
for two years.

The Big Game dance, to be pre
sented in the Women's Gym to
morrow night from 9 p.m. to 1 a.m.,
promises to be the finest formal
that Stanford has seen in many
years, according to Ted Eberle,
chairman of the dance.
Eberle, elaborating on this state
ment, said: "I believe the success
of the Lagunita-Union Formal of
several weeks ago is indicative of
the type of dance which Stanford
wants and needs. Our committee
has put in many hours of hard work
on this dance, and I believe it will
fully come up to the expectations
of every Stanford student."
It was decided to hold this year's
Big Game dance, the Red and White
Ball, in the Women's Gym in order
to conform with Stanford's wartime
policy of having as many big func
tions on campus as possible and also
to afford students an opportunity to
save tires and gas. In addition, the
traditional dance this year has the
added advantage of allowing Stan
ford men more time with their
dales, because of the fact that one
hour has been sliced from women's
Big Game night late leaves.
