# Stanford Spirit Will Win 1942 Big Game, Predicts Coach Marchie Schwartz
## Vagabonds, Freshmen Skit, Muheim, Highlight Tumultous Pavilion Rally Attended by 3,500 Stanford Rooters 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
"The leam thai will win Saturday will be the one wil.li the moM ipirit
and that team I predict will be Stanford."
So said handsome Head Coach IVTanhte Schwartz, opening last night's
tumultuous Big Game rally in the Pavilion, and if the two hours of nol.se
that followed is any indication, ho is entirely right I
Minus bonfire and minus parade, it was still Stanford spirit in full

voice and it found expression in
the conglomerate activities of Har
ry Muheim, Ed Stamm, Hairy
Shipkey, Milt Vucinich, Doe Col
year, the Med School singers, the
Vagabonds, Sparky Allyn and his
Encinamen and all those who con
tributed to the fast-moving show.
OPTIMISM IS KEYNOTE
Optimism and faith in the Stan
ford team and the Stanford spirit
was the keynote from the two-min
ute ovation given Coach Marchie at
the start to a thundering Axe Vol!
and a solemn Stanford Hymn at
the finish.
Speeches, ~.£ig*s, yells, skits, and
music were combined in a fast
moving rally pattern for the 350U
Stanford rooters jampacklng the
Pavilion.
Rally Committee uncovered a
surprise package for its feature at
traction by bringing the Vaga
bonds, popular radio and screen
singing quartet, from San Francisco
for the occasion. They appeared as
Roble hashers and Stanford stu
dents in the "Spirit of Stanford,"
recently released Columbia pic
ture on the life of Frankie Albert.
TWO ENCORES
Their rendition of the Hawaiian
War Chant, "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot," and "Dark Eyes" brought,
them back for two encores when
they gave out with "You Are My
Sunshine' and a new number,
"Glory Be."
Failure of the lights almost
nipped Coach Schwartz's speech in
its infancy. Introduced by Master
of Ceremonies Harry Muheim, he
said, "This makes us feel awfully
, good (most of the Pavilion lights
promptly went out) to know you're
behind us 100 per cent (the lights
promptly came on). But he re
covered beautifully.
CAE IIAS THE AXE
"Remember we've got the Axe;
i we hope you can still yell 'Poor
Cal' when our team comes march
ing down the field," said Bob Dro
ller, co-chairman of Cal's rally
committee, precipitating a hail of
good-natured opposition.
Ed Stamm, student body presi
dent, added a slightly different
note as bo awarded prizes for sugar
beet topping to El Capitan, Alpha
| Delta Phi, and Zeta Psi. An indi
vidual prize, a brand new sugar
beet knifo, was awarded to John
| Gabriel, El Capitan.
"A pretty taciturn cookie," Mu
heim said of Milt Vucinich, var
sity center, "but he plays a lot of
football."
VUCINICH SPEAKS
"We've had a lot of fun and a few
disappointments in our four year ,
of football here—we sure want to
end up everything with a victory,"
said Voos, seconding the sentiment.;
of Harry Shipkey, line coach, who
preceded him.
Next came a freshman group
with a .skit written by Jack Davis
and Bill Piatt, cleverly satirizing the
California rooting section. Led by
Sparky Allyn, they combined sox,
card stunts, and football players, in
an entertaining performance.
MED SCHOOL PERFORMS
Stanford's professional amatein
singers from the Med School put.
on their usual polished performaneo
on "Songs of the Stanford Red,"
"Oralee," and "Fair Stanford."
They were followed by the Vaga
bonds, who brought down the
house.
"Strictly as an anti-climax," Mu
heim introduced "the saddest man
on the Stanford entertainment
scene. Next time you hear Presi
dent Roosevelt, notice how much
he sounds like Shorty Grannis."
"The Great Man" reciprocated
with one of the best of his Presi
dent Roosevelt monologues. "I feel
close to Stanford because I am a
Harvard man, and Harvard is
known as the Stanford of the East,"
he said, bringing enthusiastic ap
plause.
Another Big Game tradition was
continued as Joe Messina, 1941 yell
leader, presented Doc Colyear with
his red socks for Game yell
leading.
"The leam thai will win Saturday will be the one wil.li the moM ipirit
and that team I predict will be Stanford."

Failure of the lights almost

Minus bonfire and minus parade, it was still Stanford spirit in full

voice and it found expression in
the conglomerate activities of Har

Shipkey, Milt Vucinich, Doe Col

Vagabonds, Sparky Allyn and his
Encinamen and all those who con
tributed to the fast-moving show.
OPTIMISM IS KEYNOTE
Optimism and faith in the Stan
ford team and the Stanford spirit
was the keynote from the two-min
ute ovation given Coach Marchie at
the start to a thundering Axe Vol!
and a solemn Stanford Hymn at
the finish.
Speeches, ~.£ig*s, yells, skits, and
music were combined in a fast
moving rally pattern for the 350U
Stanford rooters jampacklng the
Pavilion.
Rally Committee uncovered a
surprise package for its feature at
traction by bringing the Vaga
bonds, popular radio and screen
singing quartet, from San Francisco
for the occasion. They appeared as
Roble hashers and Stanford stu
dents in the "Spirit of Stanford,"
recently released Columbia pic
ture on the life of Frankie Albert.
TWO ENCORES
Their rendition of the Hawaiian
War Chant, "Swing Low, Sweet
Chariot," and "Dark Eyes" brought,
them back for two encores when
they gave out with "You Are My
Sunshine' and a new number,
"Glory Be."
Failure of the lights almost
nipped Coach Schwartz's speech in
its infancy. Introduced by Master
of Ceremonies Harry Muheim, he
said, "This makes us feel awfully
, good (most of the Pavilion lights
promptly went out) to know you're
behind us 100 per cent (the lights
promptly came on). But he re
covered beautifully.
CAE IIAS THE AXE
"Remember we've got the Axe;
i we hope you can still yell 'Poor
Cal' when our team comes march
ing down the field," said Bob Dro
ller, co-chairman of Cal's rally
committee, precipitating a hail of
good-natured opposition.
Ed Stamm, student body presi
dent, added a slightly different
note as bo awarded prizes for sugar
beet topping to El Capitan, Alpha
| Delta Phi, and Zeta Psi. An indi
vidual prize, a brand new sugar
beet knifo, was awarded to John
| Gabriel, El Capitan.
"A pretty taciturn cookie," Mu
heim said of Milt Vucinich, var
sity center, "but he plays a lot of
football."
VUCINICH SPEAKS
"We've had a lot of fun and a few
disappointments in our four year ,
of football here—we sure want to
end up everything with a victory,"
said Voos, seconding the sentiment.;
of Harry Shipkey, line coach, who
preceded him.
Next came a freshman group
with a .skit written by Jack Davis
and Bill Piatt, cleverly satirizing the
California rooting section. Led by
Sparky Allyn, they combined sox,
card stunts, and football players, in
an entertaining performance.
