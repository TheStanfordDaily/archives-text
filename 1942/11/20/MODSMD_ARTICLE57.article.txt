### 
CAIRO, Nov. 1!) (Ul*). â€”A British Hying column of tanks and motor
ized infantry sprung a new trap today on German Marshal Ervvin Rom
mel's Hoeing armies, slashing into the enemy flank 50 miles south of
Benghazi and threatening to cut off thousands more of his battered troops.
Hurtling 115 miles southwest across the Libyan hump in 24 hours, the

The largest windmill ever built,
with a capacity of 40,000 gallons an
hour, stands in Golden Gate Park at
San Francisco.

British spearhead yesterday col- j
lided with the Axis columns along
a 25-mile escarpment paralleling
ihe Gulf of Sirte between Soelei
dima, 50 miles south of Benghazi,
and Antelat.
It was believed probable that the
first large-scale fighting since the
British crashed through the Ala
mein line more than 500 miles to
the east a fortnight ago was under
way in the 15-to-20-mile-wide cor
ridor and the gulf coast.
FINAL STAND SEEN
Rommel's tattered Africa Corps
and their Italian allies were racing
desperately through the corridor j
for the Agheila line, more than 100 |
miles to the southwest, where they i
are expected to make a final at
tempt to halt the Brkish Eighth
Army just short of the Tripolitania
border.
Some of the estimated 50,000 Axis j
troops already have reached El I
Agheila, but the remainder are be
lieved to stretch back along the
curving Gulf of Sirte coast as far
as Benghazi, which the British Hy
ing column by-passed in its race to
cut off the enemy.
The British advance brought the
eastern prong of the Allied North
African pincers to within 525 miles
of Tunisia.
.11! NKE It S REPORTED
Several score German Junkers 52 j
troop transport planes were re- I
ported at airdromes between Ben- j
ghazi and Sidi Ahmed El-Magrun, |
45 miles to the south on the coastal ,
road, yesterday, but British gen- j
eral headquarters did not say j
whether they were being used to j
speed the Axis evacuation or to
bring in reinforcements.
The British forces advancing 1
along the coast were believed in
the vicinity of Barce, 60 miles
northeast of Benghazi. However,
the Germans still were in posses
sion of the Barce airdrome as lately
as Tuesday.
YANKS' BOMBING
American heavy bombers last
night raided Benghazi, starting fires
in the dock area, an American com
munique reported. Two ships re
ported burning of the mole near
the harbor entrance were believed
to have been towed there by evac
uating Axis forces in an attempt to
block the entrance.
Naval planes also were support
ing the British advance. A squad
ron Tuesday night sank an 8,000-
ton tanker moving westward along
the Tripolitania coast with fuel for
Rommel's tanks.
