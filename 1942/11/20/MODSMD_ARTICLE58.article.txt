QUARTERS. Australia, Nov. 19
(UP). â€”The appearance of eight
enemy destroyers off Buna aroused
speculation tonight that the Japa
nese, who have suffered upwards
of 3,000 casualties in that area in
less than three weeks, might be
preparing to evacuate their beach
head on the northeastern New Gui
nea coast.
Front dispatches reported that
neither the Americans nor the Aus
tralians, closing in on Buna from
two sides, were meeting any oppo
sition. The Aussies last were re
ported between 20 and 25 miles
west of Buna, beyond the town of
Isivita.
