# Big Game Traffic Must Heed Dim-Out
## 
### 
Students driving to and from
the Big Game are cautioned to
watch dim-out regulations closely
during the trip home in the dark
after the game.
The San Francisco police are
particularly stringent about dim
out regulations on the bridge and
in the city itself. All parts of the
city which can he seen from the
sea. or which are not sheltered,
are clearly marked with dim-out
signs.
Motorists should check their
parking and dim lights to he sure
they are in perfect working order.
