# Distribution of Gas Books Ends Today
## 
### 
Today is the last day for per
sons to submit their applications
and obtain their gas ration books.
The sole campus registration cen
ter is the elementary school and
it will be open from 9 a.m. to
7 p.m.
Persons are reminded that in
order to get their ration books
they must present their applica
tion and all the data it requires,
their automobile registration cer
tificate (white slip), and the
number of their federal use tax
stamp.
Contrary to what the ration
book says, rationing will begin
Dec. 1. "A" books are good until
July 21, 1943. Persons seeking
additional gas should apply to the
local rationing board.
