## 
### 
Stanford's 1042 beet-topping champs are the El Capitan boys who, in
two weeks, topped :>fi,ol4 pounds of beets and loaded another 20,000, the
SWB announced yesterday.
Last night President Ed Stamm awarded El Capitan President Don
Gabriel an engraved beet knife, with the compliments of Harlcy Jcncckc,
. 4-ranch owner, at the Big Game rally.

A $25 Wctr bond was also presented
to the club.
Runner-up was the Alpha Delt
team, which loaded and topped 25,315
pounds of beets. In third place, is
the Zete crew, which topped 28,000
pounds. Bonuses are in the mail
for the runners-up.
Additional bonuses will be sent to
all the participating teams, who
helped the farmers make the sugar
quota set by Secretary of Agricul
ture Wickard.
Beets topped and loaded, 642,760
pounds; living group teams, 26; num
ber of workers, 210; average beets
topped per man, 2,670 pounds, hours
worked, 1,084.
Rain prevented the Stanford beet
toppers from harvesting the last 100
acres of the ranch this week. How
ever, the three penalized fraterni
ties are scheduled to work off their
fines in the beet fields next Monday
and Tuesday.
"This will mark the end of Stan
ford's first large scale response to
a labor shortage,'' Luana Forkner,
SWB, commented. ''But more calls
will be issued next quarter, and
we're organized to meet the de
mands."
