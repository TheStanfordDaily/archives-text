# 'Maids' Will Sell Stamps at Game
## 
### 
Stanford's roving War Stamp
peddlers, the Minute Maids, will be
on hand at the Big Game to sell
stamps between the halves.
The Minute Maids, organized this
quarter by Harriet Driscoll, are
Stanford women who sell War
Stamps at all large gatherings on
the campus.
