## 
### 
In a personal plea to Excom Wed
nesday night, A1 Masters, Civilian
Defense administrator, warned the
committee that lack of student co
operation had seriously hampered
the campus Civilian Defense pro
gram.
He pointed out that many stu
dents had failed to show up for the
last "disaster" drill on November
11, and that many students who had
signed up for civilian defense work
had not reported for training.
STRESSES SERIOUSNESS
Masters stressed the seriousness
of the situation by emphasizing
the chaos and destruction that
could come from an air raid on a
poorly organized campus. He as
serted that most of the strength of
the civilian defense organization is
made up of student volunteers, and
their failure to take an active in
terest in the necessary training and
drills completely hampers the ef
fectiveness of the campus defense
organization.
After discussion of the problem
by members of Excom, it was de
cided that faculty members of
the Civilian Defense organization
would speak on the necessity of
student volunteer co-operation at
lunches and dinners at all campus
living groups during the next week.
FACULTY TO SPEAK
Masters said the Executive Com
mittee of the Civilian Defense Com
mittee would meet next Tuesday,
and that he expected the speakers
would start from that point.
He declared that many students
do not understand the campus de
fense situation and that the dis
cussions by faculty members of
the Civilian Defense organization
should clear this up.
Masters also pointed out that
physical education credit will be
given those student volunteers for
time spent in defense training.
