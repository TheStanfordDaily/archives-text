# Big Came Recalls Fifty Years of Stanford, Cal Grid Rivalry Traditions
## Cardinals Won First Tussle, 14-10; Axe Had Debut Seven Years Later; First Gaieties Curtain Rose in 1898 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Fifty years ago Stanford and
Berkeley met for the first time on
the football field . . . unfortunately
neither team remembered the es
sential football . . . nevertheless
the game got under way and Stan
ford won with a 14-10 score . . .
Seven years later Ihe Stanford
Axe was sharpened and painted
and introduced to Big Game life
. . . in 1898 the Gaieties first scin
tillated across the stage to take an
important part in Indian-Bear tra
dition . . . and gradually over the
years Big Game week - end has
come to represent . . . the Cardi
nal at its reddest . . . the Axe at
its sharpest . . . the rally at its
biggest and loudest . . . the time
when enthusiastic Stanford spirit
soars just a little higher than it

did the year before.
Waaaaaay back at the turn of
the century . . . on Thanksgiving
Day, Nov. 25), 1900 . . . Stanford i
met Cal for the tenth annual Big !
Game and came out of the tilt with i
a 5-0 victory.
