# PRE-RALLY PRACTICE
## 
### 
On (ho Friday before the game a
song practice and jolly-up pre
pared the rooters for the '00 Big
Rally which reverberated through
out the Assembly Hall four days
later . . . the expanding student
body had outgrown the Chapel
where the spirit of Roar, Roar,
Roar, Roar, etc., . . . had been in
itiated.
The first 25 or 30 rows were
reserved especially for Che men
who sat together to get a "har
monious effect from their yells"
.... the women were relegated
to the balcony lest they be
knocked down by •the rousing
spirit of the Rough. After the
Rally the crowd . . . "adjourned
to the baseball field where a
monster bonfire blazed."
Mrs. Stanford . . . missing her
first Thanksgiving game . . . sent
the following cablegram from Eu
rope after the victory: "Dr. Jordan:
Extend my congratulations to the
boys on their victory. Jane L. Stan
ford."
In 1917 Big Game was rugby
and was between Stanford and
Santa Clara. For the first time
it placed second to a bigger Big
Game . . . the United States was
at war.
Stanford's varsity had all other
varsities defeated for fighting spir
it .. . coming to the front from an
almost hopeless outlook at the be
ginning of the year . . . with Dink
Templeton, greatest fullback ever
developed on the coast, as captain
. . . the victory wasn't a complete
surprise.
FOOTBALL JUBILEE
Ram's Head presented the Foot
ball JubiJee . . . comparable to the
Gaieties . . . the "jazziest jazz ever
jazzed with the best saxies, banjos
and drums to be found south of the
Palace."
Afterward, the rooters followed
the band to serpentine through the
Inner Quad to the huge bonfire
erected by the freshmen which
when touched off . . . sent flames
that "shot to the top and cremated
!hc California spirit."
Oh, yes . . . rallies were still
being held in the Assembly Hall
. . . but students had to buy tickets
of admission . . . the student body
was expanding again.
The frosh made two raids on
Santa Clara . . . painted L.S.J.U.
all over the enemy campus on
the first raid . . . and lit the rally
pyre on the second trip.
War had hit the athletic programs
in Eastern colleges that year. Foot
ball had been given up entirely . . .
but the feeling at Stanford con
sidered athletics invaluable physi
cal training as a war benefit ... I
"should be continued as nearly as
possible according to last year's
program."
DINK TEMPLETON
Dink Templeton . . . applied for
admission to the aviation school,
passed the examination . . . and
was awaiting the government's call,
which by the grace of Uncle Sam j
didn't conflict with the Big Game.
Twenty years ago the 18th Big |
Game . . . between Cal and Stan
ford again . . . was played Nov. 25, >
1922. Said tile Daily Palo Alto . . . j
"Stanford has the greatest oppor
tunity in three decades of Stanford-
California football history tomor
row. There never has been, and
there never will be. for many years
to come, a Big Game in which the
Cardinal varsity has been accorded
so little chance of winning."
Said Tiny Thornhill . . . "Al
though we're apparently outclassed,
we're going in to win, not to lose, j
It will be a real battle, not just a i
side-show for the rooting sections." I
"Cabbages and Things" offered '
the following rhymes of courage '
and support to a rooting section '
that kept repeating over and over
. . . "Stanford is never defeated |
until the game is over. Stanford is j
never defeated until the game is j
over:
"Eleven men are down there giving l
all they have to win,
A thousand in the bleachers fight-,
ing too.

they never will give in.
Yet, isn't that the proper thing to 1
do?
Is there any vise in fighting till i
you're tired, and sick and worn. 1
When it's easy to give up, and take
a rest?
There is but a single answer to this
question, and we scorn
Any man who cannot answer with
the rest.
If you think the game is rotten.
and the referee's forgotten
How to penalize the errors you can

If the spii its start to oozing just be

PERFIDIOUS UMPIRES
Or the umpire's soul is bathed in
perfidy . . .
That's the time the team needs
backing, and no rooter should lie
lacking
In the yells and in the pep all
through the fight.
So don't quit because we're losin',
and it's a foregone conclusion
j That someday the game is going to
come out right."
Maybe it was because Harry
! Shipkey . . . Stanford's present as
[ sistant varsity coach . . . was play
ing his first Big Game and making
"sensational tackles" . . . maybe
j it was because of the poem . . .
! Anyway after the game the Stan
ford rooters breathed a sigh of re
lief.
FOOTBALL FROTHIES
Ram's Head added a little levity
to the serious situation . . . and
presented the Football Frothies
which bubbled and foamed their
way through two acts of local satire
. . . with burlesque in acting con
trasting with beauty in stage set

no victory to celebrate and no sor

Abe Mellinkoff . . . famed Bull
sessioner . . . commented on the
Gaieties: "There is that homey,

The Daily editor reported on Ihe

spent his 27th birthday at the con
trols of a big Liberator bomber over
the German submarine base of Lo
rient on the French Bay of Biscay
coast.
On (ho Friday before the game a
song practice and jolly-up pre
pared the rooters for the '00 Big
Rally which reverberated through
out the Assembly Hall four days
later . . . the expanding student
body had outgrown the Chapel
where the spirit of Roar, Roar,
Roar, Roar, etc., . . . had been in
itiated.
The first 25 or 30 rows were
reserved especially for Che men
who sat together to get a "har
monious effect from their yells"
.... the women were relegated
to the balcony lest they be
knocked down by •the rousing
spirit of the Rough. After the
Rally the crowd . . . "adjourned
to the baseball field where a
monster bonfire blazed."
Mrs. Stanford . . . missing her
first Thanksgiving game . . . sent
the following cablegram from Eu
rope after the victory: "Dr. Jordan:
Extend my congratulations to the
boys on their victory. Jane L. Stan
ford."
In 1917 Big Game was rugby
and was between Stanford and
Santa Clara. For the first time
it placed second to a bigger Big
Game . . . the United States was
at war.
Stanford's varsity had all other
varsities defeated for fighting spir
it .. . coming to the front from an
almost hopeless outlook at the be
ginning of the year . . . with Dink
Templeton, greatest fullback ever
developed on the coast, as captain
. . . the victory wasn't a complete
surprise.
FOOTBALL JUBILEE
Ram's Head presented the Foot
ball JubiJee . . . comparable to the
Gaieties . . . the "jazziest jazz ever
jazzed with the best saxies, banjos
and drums to be found south of the
Palace."
Afterward, the rooters followed
the band to serpentine through the
Inner Quad to the huge bonfire
erected by the freshmen which
when touched off . . . sent flames
that "shot to the top and cremated
!hc California spirit."
Oh, yes . . . rallies were still
being held in the Assembly Hall
. . . but students had to buy tickets
of admission . . . the student body
was expanding again.
The frosh made two raids on
Santa Clara . . . painted L.S.J.U.
all over the enemy campus on
the first raid . . . and lit the rally
pyre on the second trip.
War had hit the athletic programs
in Eastern colleges that year. Foot
ball had been given up entirely . . .
but the feeling at Stanford con
sidered athletics invaluable physi
cal training as a war benefit ... I
"should be continued as nearly as
possible according to last year's
program."
DINK TEMPLETON
Dink Templeton . . . applied for
admission to the aviation school,
passed the examination . . . and
was awaiting the government's call,
which by the grace of Uncle Sam j
didn't conflict with the Big Game.
Twenty years ago the 18th Big |
Game . . . between Cal and Stan
ford again . . . was played Nov. 25, >
1922. Said tile Daily Palo Alto . . . j
"Stanford has the greatest oppor
tunity in three decades of Stanford-
California football history tomor
row. There never has been, and
there never will be. for many years
to come, a Big Game in which the
Cardinal varsity has been accorded
so little chance of winning."
Said Tiny Thornhill . . . "Al
though we're apparently outclassed,
we're going in to win, not to lose, j
It will be a real battle, not just a i

LONDON. Nov. 19 (U.R) — Capt.
"KO" Dessert of El Segundo, Calif.,
spent his 27th birthday at the con
trols of a big Liberator bomber over
the German submarine base of Lo
rient on the French Bay of Biscay
coast.
On (ho Friday before the game a
song practice and jolly-up pre
pared the rooters for the '00 Big
Rally which reverberated through
out the Assembly Hall four days
later . . . the expanding student
body had outgrown the Chapel
where the spirit of Roar, Roar,
Roar, Roar, etc., . . . had been in
itiated.
The first 25 or 30 rows were
reserved especially for Che men
who sat together to get a "har
monious effect from their yells"
.... the women were relegated
to the balcony lest they be
knocked down by •the rousing
spirit of the Rough. After the
Rally the crowd . . . "adjourned
to the baseball field where a
monster bonfire blazed."
Mrs. Stanford . . . missing her
first Thanksgiving game . . . sent
the following cablegram from Eu
rope after the victory: "Dr. Jordan:
Extend my congratulations to the
boys on their victory. Jane L. Stan
ford."
In 1917 Big Game was rugby
and was between Stanford and
Santa Clara. For the first time
it placed second to a bigger Big
Game . . . the United States was
at war.
Stanford's varsity had all other
varsities defeated for fighting spir
it .. . coming to the front from an
almost hopeless outlook at the be
ginning of the year . . . with Dink
Templeton, greatest fullback ever
developed on the coast, as captain
. . . the victory wasn't a complete
surprise.
FOOTBALL JUBILEE
Ram's Head presented the Foot
ball JubiJee . . . comparable to the
Gaieties . . . the "jazziest jazz ever
jazzed with the best saxies, banjos
and drums to be found south of the
Palace."
Afterward, the rooters followed
the band to serpentine through the
Inner Quad to the huge bonfire
erected by the freshmen which
when touched off . . . sent flames
that "shot to the top and cremated
!hc California spirit."
Oh, yes . . . rallies were still
being held in the Assembly Hall
. . . but students had to buy tickets
of admission . . . the student body
was expanding again.
The frosh made two raids on
Santa Clara . . . painted L.S.J.U.
all over the enemy campus on
the first raid . . . and lit the rally
pyre on the second trip.
War had hit the athletic programs
in Eastern colleges that year. Foot
ball had been given up entirely . . .
but the feeling at Stanford con
sidered athletics invaluable physi
cal training as a war benefit ... I
"should be continued as nearly as

Dink Templeton . . . applied for

the German submarine base of Lo

coast.
On (ho Friday before the game a
song practice and jolly-up pre
pared the rooters for the '00 Big
Rally which reverberated through
out the Assembly Hall four days
later . . . the expanding student
body had outgrown the Chapel
where the spirit of Roar, Roar,
Roar, Roar, etc., . . . had been in
itiated.
The first 25 or 30 rows were
reserved especially for Che men
who sat together to get a "har
monious effect from their yells"
.... the women were relegated
to the balcony lest they be
knocked down by •the rousing
spirit of the Rough. After the
Rally the crowd . . . "adjourned
to the baseball field where a
monster bonfire blazed."
Mrs. Stanford . . . missing her
first Thanksgiving game . . . sent
the following cablegram from Eu
rope after the victory: "Dr. Jordan:
Extend my congratulations to the
boys on their victory. Jane L. Stan
ford."
In 1917 Big Game was rugby
and was between Stanford and
Santa Clara. For the first time
it placed second to a bigger Big
Game . . . the United States was
at war.
Stanford's varsity had all other
varsities defeated for fighting spir
it .. . coming to the front from an
almost hopeless outlook at the be
ginning of the year . . . with Dink
Templeton, greatest fullback ever
developed on the coast, as captain
. . . the victory wasn't a complete
surprise.
FOOTBALL JUBILEE
Ram's Head presented the Foot
ball JubiJee . . . comparable to the
Gaieties . . . the "jazziest jazz ever
jazzed with the best saxies, banjos

Afterward, the rooters followed
the band to serpentine through the
Inner Quad to the huge bonfire
erected by the freshmen which
when touched off . . . sent flames
that "shot to the top and cremated
!hc California spirit."
Oh, yes . . . rallies were still
being held in the Assembly Hall
. . . but students had to buy tickets
of admission . . . the student body
was expanding again.
The frosh made two raids on
Santa Clara . . . painted L.S.J.U.
all over the enemy campus on
the first raid . . . and lit the rally
pyre on the second trip.
War had hit the athletic programs
in Eastern colleges that year. Foot

LONDON. Nov. 19 (U.R) — Capt.
"KO" Dessert of El Segundo, Calif.,
spent his 27th birthday at the con
trols of a big Liberator bomber over
the German submarine base of Lo
rient on the French Bay of Biscay
coast.
On (ho Friday before the game a
song practice and jolly-up pre
pared the rooters for the '00 Big
Rally which reverberated through
out the Assembly Hall four days
later . . . the expanding student
body had outgrown the Chapel
where the spirit of Roar, Roar,
Roar, Roar, etc., . . . had been in
itiated.
The first 25 or 30 rows were
reserved especially for Che men
who sat together to get a "har
monious effect from their yells"
.... the women were relegated
to the balcony lest they be
knocked down by •the rousing
spirit of the Rough. After the
Rally the crowd . . . "adjourned
to the baseball field where a
monster bonfire blazed."
Mrs. Stanford . . . missing her
first Thanksgiving game . . . sent
the following cablegram from Eu
rope after the victory: "Dr. Jordan:
Extend my congratulations to the
boys on their victory. Jane L. Stan
ford."
In 1917 Big Game was rugby
and was between Stanford and
Santa Clara. For the first time
it placed second to a bigger Big
Game . . . the United States was
at war.
Stanford's varsity had all other
varsities defeated for fighting spir
it .. . coming to the front from an
almost hopeless outlook at the be
ginning of the year . . . with Dink
Templeton, greatest fullback ever
developed on the coast, as captain
. . . the victory wasn't a complete
surprise.
FOOTBALL JUBILEE
Ram's Head presented the Foot
ball JubiJee . . . comparable to the
Gaieties . . . the "jazziest jazz ever
jazzed with the best saxies, banjos
and drums to be found south of the
Palace."
Afterward, the rooters followed
the band to serpentine through the
Inner Quad to the huge bonfire
erected by the freshmen which
when touched off . . . sent flames
that "shot to the top and cremated
!hc California spirit."
Oh, yes . . . rallies were still
being held in the Assembly Hall
. . . but students had to buy tickets
of admission . . . the student body
was expanding again.
The frosh made two raids on
Santa Clara . . . painted L.S.J.U.
all over the enemy campus on
the first raid . . . and lit the rally
pyre on the second trip.
War had hit the athletic programs
in Eastern colleges that year. Foot
ball had been given up entirely . . .
but the feeling at Stanford con
sidered athletics invaluable physi
cal training as a war benefit ... I
"should be continued as nearly as
possible according to last year's
program."
DINK TEMPLETON
Dink Templeton . . . applied for
admission to the aviation school,
passed the examination . . . and
was awaiting the government's call,
which by the grace of Uncle Sam j
didn't conflict with the Big Game.
Twenty years ago the 18th Big |
Game . . . between Cal and Stan
ford again . . . was played Nov. 25, >
1922. Said tile Daily Palo Alto . . . j
"Stanford has the greatest oppor
tunity in three decades of Stanford-
California football history tomor
row. There never has been, and
there never will be. for many years
to come, a Big Game in which the
Cardinal varsity has been accorded
so little chance of winning."
Said Tiny Thornhill . . . "Al
though we're apparently outclassed,
we're going in to win, not to lose, j
It will be a real battle, not just a i
side-show for the rooting sections." I
"Cabbages and Things" offered '
the following rhymes of courage '
and support to a rooting section '
that kept repeating over and over
. . . "Stanford is never defeated |
until the game is over. Stanford is j
never defeated until the game is j
over:
"Eleven men are down there giving l
all they have to win,
A thousand in the bleachers fight-,
ing too.
The odds are all against them yet
they never will give in.
Yet, isn't that the proper thing to 1
do?
Is there any vise in fighting till i
you're tired, and sick and worn. 1
When it's easy to give up, and take
a rest?
There is but a single answer to this
question, and we scorn
Any man who cannot answer with
the rest.
If you think the game is rotten.
and the referee's forgotten
How to penalize the errors you can
SCO.
If the spii its start to oozing just be

cause the team is losing
PERFIDIOUS UMPIRES
Or the umpire's soul is bathed in
perfidy . . .
That's the time the team needs
backing, and no rooter should lie
lacking
In the yells and in the pep all
through the fight.
So don't quit because we're losin',
and it's a foregone conclusion
j That someday the game is going to
come out right."
Maybe it was because Harry
! Shipkey . . . Stanford's present as
[ sistant varsity coach . . . was play
ing his first Big Game and making
"sensational tackles" . . . maybe
j it was because of the poem . . .
! Anyway after the game the Stan
ford rooters breathed a sigh of re
lief.
FOOTBALL FROTHIES
Ram's Head added a little levity
to the serious situation . . . and
presented the Football Frothies
which bubbled and foamed their
way through two acts of local satire

trasting with beauty in stage set

fudge sundaes during the evening.
Then ten years ago . . . Nov. 19,
1932 . . . Big Game ended up with
a disheartening scoreless game . . .
no victory to celebrate and no sor
rows to drown. But every student
[ from both campuses was in the
j City that night on one pretext or
another.
Abe Mellinkoff . . . famed Bull
sessioner . . . commented on the
Gaieties: "There is that homey,
folksy, dominantly agrarian appeal
to every Gaieties which won't be
lacking tonight. Every Gaieties
strikes at least one high spot which

for the ensuing year. In fact . . .
if you don't see the Gaieties your

miss all your friends' sly attempts

The Daily editor reported on Ihe
same topic . . . "Reliable advance
