This will be the last Cal game for
the men who in 1940 brought the ;
Axe back after a five-year absence,
and then rolled on to the Rose Bowl ;
and a smashing victory over Ne- ]
braska. This will be a chance at re
venge for the men who last year |
lost to an upstart team from across |
the Bay which upset the odds with |
a 16-0 surprise win.
