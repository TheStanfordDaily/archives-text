# Rooters Reminded To Lock All Doors
## 
### 
As the campus will be virtually
deserted tomorrow afternoon, the
Stanford Police Department recom
mends that all persons living in
men's and women's residence halls
be sure and lock their rooms and
take their keys with them.
The department also recommends
that all fraternity and sorority
houses have someone left in the
house to greet all callers. In past
years when this precaution has been
taken, there have been no losses.
New steel requires pig ifon and
scrap iron in equal parts. Scrap
comes from worn-out and useless
iron and steel articles lying around
your home.
