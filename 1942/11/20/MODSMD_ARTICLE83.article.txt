# Senior Reminisces Over Ups and Downs With Cal; Wants Axe Back for Good
## Bears Hurt Pride as Frosh, Proud Of 'T' as Soph, Chagrined When Junior, Will Yell Loudly as Senior 
### ZIP WALT 
In J93!) T came to the sandstone buildings of Stanford, and sat many
an afternoon in the hujfe Stadium on Galves street and El Camino. and
watched our team go down to defeat.
In that year, 1939, we went down to an inglorious defeat by California.
31-14. That really hurt, and my pride was hurt, as I sat there, watching

our team throw long prayer passes. >
My pride was hurt when the center j
threw the ball back, and there was !
no backfield man around to re- i
ceive it.
It hurt to see the California root
ers. not the most gentle souls in the
world by a long shot, flaunt the
Axe in front of the rooting section.
I FORMATION
Then things changed—we had the
great T formation, and a flu-ridden j
team climaxed the scheduled sea- !
son with a 13-ti victory over Cali- |
fornia in Memorial Stadium. I was 1
proud of Clem Tomerlin, Ed
Stsmm, and Chuck Taylor as they
stopped the Cal attack four times
on the goal line. That left side of !
the line was terrific, as Orv Hatch
er tried to bust it open.
It was a great year, and every- j
one wondered just' how long it j
could last. The Shaughnessy T
looked invincible as they rolled to j
17 straight wins over good compe
tition. Then a Rose Bowl-bound
Oregon State team tripped us in the !
mud at Corvallis.
But it didn't stop there, for after !
Washington State came the Big
Game, and as a junior I once again |
went into our big Stadium confi
dent of another Cardinal victory.
CAL GETS AXE
But something happened that day
and we went down ingloriously j
again, in our own Stadium, 16-0. j
Once again I was chagrined as my
California friends came serpentin
ing across the green, screaming
their unexpected victory.
Then we had to give the Axe
back to Cal for another season. To
a team that was just kicked around
by most every team in the Confer
ence, while our squad had to meet
all of their opponents in top spirit.
Now I'm a senior, and soon will 1
be gone from the cool cloisters of !
the Quad, and the Lake, the Li be, j
Cellar coffee and cokes, and Gov- f
ernor's Lane will be just a cher- '
ished memory of Ihe best years of \
my life. But what will always be [
lecalled are the Big Games we had !
with California.
It's Big Game again, and now I'm j
a senior.
DAMN THE BERKELEYITES
I'm going over to Berkeley to
morrow and I'm just going to scream
and yell and howl and cheer mv
team on to a decisive win. I don't
want our team to show any mercy
for the opponent. I want them to
win like I've never seen our banner
raised on high before.
I want all of our players to show
what a great spirit is, how the game
should be played as a team unit,
playing hard and fierce every min
ute they are in the game, for I know
that every minute thai I'm sitting
up in the stands, just waiting for
the cheer leader to lead the Axe
Yell, I'm going to give everything
I have for my school and my team. !
The few more months I have left j
at Stanford, I want to see that Axe
resting where it should: in the tro
phy case in the Union.

team on to a decisive win. I don't
want our team to show any mercy
for the opponent. I want them to

raised on high before.
I want all of our players to show
what a great spirit is, how the game
should be played as a team unit,
playing hard and fierce every min
ute they are in the game, for I know
that every minute thai I'm sitting
up in the stands, just waiting for
the cheer leader to lead the Axe
Yell, I'm going to give everything
I have for my school and my team. !
The few more months I have left j
at Stanford, I want to see that Axe
resting where it should: in the tro
phy case in the Union.
"The Berkeleyites be damned!"
In J93!) T came to the sandstone buildings of Stanford, and sat many
an afternoon in the hujfe Stadium on Galves street and El Camino. and
watched our team go down to defeat.
In that year, 1939, we went down to an inglorious defeat by California.
31-14. That really hurt, and my pride was hurt, as I sat there, watching

our team throw long prayer passes. >
My pride was hurt when the center j
threw the ball back, and there was !
no backfield man around to re- i
ceive it.
It hurt to see the California root
ers. not the most gentle souls in the
world by a long shot, flaunt the
Axe in front of the rooting section.
I FORMATION
Then things changed—we had the
great T formation, and a flu-ridden j
team climaxed the scheduled sea- !
son with a 13-ti victory over Cali- |
fornia in Memorial Stadium. I was 1
proud of Clem Tomerlin, Ed
Stsmm, and Chuck Taylor as they
stopped the Cal attack four times
on the goal line. That left side of !
the line was terrific, as Orv Hatch
er tried to bust it open.
It was a great year, and every- j
one wondered just' how long it j
could last. The Shaughnessy T
looked invincible as they rolled to j
17 straight wins over good compe
tition. Then a Rose Bowl-bound
Oregon State team tripped us in the !
mud at Corvallis.
But it didn't stop there, for after !
Washington State came the Big
Game, and as a junior I once again |
went into our big Stadium confi
dent of another Cardinal victory.
CAL GETS AXE
But something happened that day
and we went down ingloriously j
again, in our own Stadium, 16-0. j
Once again I was chagrined as my
California friends came serpentin
ing across the green, screaming
their unexpected victory.
Then we had to give the Axe
back to Cal for another season. To
a team that was just kicked around
by most every team in the Confer
ence, while our squad had to meet
all of their opponents in top spirit.
Now I'm a senior, and soon will 1
be gone from the cool cloisters of !
the Quad, and the Lake, the Li be, j
Cellar coffee and cokes, and Gov- f
ernor's Lane will be just a cher- '
ished memory of Ihe best years of \
my life. But what will always be [

be gone from the cool cloisters of !
the Quad, and the Lake, the Li be, j
Cellar coffee and cokes, and Gov- f
ernor's Lane will be just a cher- '
ished memory of Ihe best years of \
my life. But what will always be [
lecalled are the Big Games we had !
with California.
It's Big Game again, and now I'm j
a senior.
DAMN THE BERKELEYITES
I'm going over to Berkeley to
morrow and I'm just going to scream
and yell and howl and cheer mv
team on to a decisive win. I don't
want our team to show any mercy
for the opponent. I want them to
win like I've never seen our banner
raised on high before.
I want all of our players to show
what a great spirit is, how the game
should be played as a team unit,
playing hard and fierce every min
ute they are in the game, for I know
that every minute thai I'm sitting
up in the stands, just waiting for
the cheer leader to lead the Axe
Yell, I'm going to give everything
I have for my school and my team. !
The few more months I have left j
at Stanford, I want to see that Axe
resting where it should: in the tro
phy case in the Union.
"The Berkeleyites be damned!"
