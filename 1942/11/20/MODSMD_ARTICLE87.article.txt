# Cal Rally Com Lends Stunt Cards To Stanford Rooters
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Thanks to California's Rally Com
mi tee, Stanford rooters will have
card stunts between the halves of
tomorrow afternoon's Big Game in
Berkeley.
Some 1.300 cards in six colors have
been borrowed from the University
of California for use by Indian root
ing section. Rally Committee re
ceived the cards last week and on
short notice have worked out a full
program of stunts honoring the Army
and Navy and Stanford football
nen.
Eecause of the shift to war pro
duction, no more cards for card
stunts are manufactured. Stanford
was unable to buy any more this
year and its existing stock was far
too small to be of any practical use.
CAL OFFERS CARDS
But California's Rally Committee,
led by Margaret McMullin and Bob
Dreher, co-chairmen, dipped into its
reserve supply, cut down on the size
of its own card section, and offered
the 1,300 cards for Stanford's use.
"Please cooperate with us and re
turn tltese cards in good shape be
cause it is impossible to get any
more. The Rally Committee at Cal
has been swell to lend them to us
and we want to keep our part of the
bargain," said Martha Thurmond,

Rally Committee co-chairman, yes
terday.
Members of Rally Committee will
be on the steps beside the rooting
section to collect the cards when the
stunts are completed.
DIRECTIONS GIVEN
For the benefit of freshmen and
others who haven't ever participated
in card stunts, Miss Thurmond gave
the following directions.
Cards will be tacked to the seats
with the number of the stunt and
the color of the card for that par
ticular seat on it. Rooters bend down
with the card underneath them, the
correct color face down. As the
whistle from the Rally Committee
member directing the stunt, all root
ers sit erect with their cards at eye
level.
FOR FLIP STUNT
In the case of a flip stunt, rooters
should make sure that the color card
for the next number is facing them
so that they can flip their cards si
multaneously on the whistle. At
ihe end of the stunt, rooters bend
down and find the card color for the
next stunt.
"We haven't had card stunts at
any time before this game so we
haven't had a chance to practice on
them. We hope everyone will co
operate with us to make these stunts

work," commented Miss Thurmond.
If the directions above can be fol
lowed closely, a great deal of con
fusion can be avoided, shp added.
WAlt STAMP CORSAGES
Corsages made of war stamps will
be sold at the game instead of flow
ers. This has been the style of cor
sages sold at most football games in
the East and the idea has the en
dorsement of both schools.
Rally Committee members di
rected by Miss Thurmond worked
yesterday afternoon in the Stanford
War Work Shop helping the regular
workers to fix the corsages.
As in most games, girls will be re
quired to wear white shirts and
carry pompoms and boys must wear
white shirts and rooters' caps for
admittance to the rooters' section.

ceived the cards last week and on
short notice have worked out a full
program of stunts honoring the Army
and Navy and Stanford football
nen.
Eecause of the shift to war pro
duction, no more cards for card
stunts are manufactured. Stanford
was unable to buy any more this
year and its existing stock was far
too small to be of any practical use.
CAL OFFERS CARDS
But California's Rally Committee,
led by Margaret McMullin and Bob
Dreher, co-chairmen, dipped into its
reserve supply, cut down on the size
of its own card section, and offered
the 1,300 cards for Stanford's use.
"Please cooperate with us and re
turn tltese cards in good shape be
cause it is impossible to get any
more. The Rally Committee at Cal
has been swell to lend them to us
and we want to keep our part of the
bargain," said Martha Thurmond,

Rally Committee co-chairman, yes
terday.
Members of Rally Committee will
be on the steps beside the rooting
section to collect the cards when the
stunts are completed.
DIRECTIONS GIVEN
For the benefit of freshmen and
others who haven't ever participated
in card stunts, Miss Thurmond gave
the following directions.
Cards will be tacked to the seats
with the number of the stunt and
the color of the card for that par
ticular seat on it. Rooters bend down
with the card underneath them, the
correct color face down. As the
whistle from the Rally Committee
member directing the stunt, all root
ers sit erect with their cards at eye
level.
FOR FLIP STUNT
In the case of a flip stunt, rooters
should make sure that the color card
for the next number is facing them
so that they can flip their cards si
multaneously on the whistle. At
ihe end of the stunt, rooters bend
down and find the card color for the
next stunt.
"We haven't had card stunts at
any time before this game so we
haven't had a chance to practice on
them. We hope everyone will co
operate with us to make these stunts

work," commented Miss Thurmond.
If the directions above can be fol
lowed closely, a great deal of con
fusion can be avoided, shp added.
WAlt STAMP CORSAGES
Corsages made of war stamps will
be sold at the game instead of flow
ers. This has been the style of cor
sages sold at most football games in
the East and the idea has the en
dorsement of both schools.
Rally Committee members di
rected by Miss Thurmond worked
yesterday afternoon in the Stanford
War Work Shop helping the regular
workers to fix the corsages.
As in most games, girls will be re
quired to wear white shirts and
carry pompoms and boys must wear
white shirts and rooters' caps for
admittance to the rooters' section.
Thanks to California's Rally Com
mi tee, Stanford rooters will have
card stunts between the halves of
tomorrow afternoon's Big Game in
Berkeley.
Some 1.300 cards in six colors have
been borrowed from the University
of California for use by Indian root
