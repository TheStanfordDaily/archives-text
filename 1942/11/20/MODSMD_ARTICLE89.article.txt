# Band to Strut, Play at Game
## 
### 
Seventy members of the Stanford
Band will be on hand at the Berke
ley stadium tomorrow to add more
color to the Big Game festivities.
Under the direction of Loring Clark
the band will strut its stuff at half
time and lead the Card section in
songs that should scare the Beiir
into submission.
As usual the Indian band, to
gether with the California musi
cians, will open the game with the
Star Spangled Banner."
The b;;nd has been rehearsing
throughout the week, brushing up
on old Cal-Stanford songs and run
ning through some new numbers
bought especially for l!*e Big Game.
A special practice session will be
held tomorrow morning to work
and perfect stunts to be shown on
the field during half-time.
"I won't tell you what the stunts
will be," said Ed Carpenter, band
manager, "but I can promise you
they will be something new and
different. We have worked awfully
hard this past week during rehear
sals to get something th;it will be
in the spirit of the present war ac
tivities."
Loring Clark will lead the band
aided by Hank Lew, Ted and Bill
Eberle and Ed Luce. Loring was
elected leader before the Southern
California game.
