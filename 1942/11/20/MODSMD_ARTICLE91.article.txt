# The 						Spirit of Big Game
## 
### 
EVEN with the war and its many complica
tions, Stanford's gridmen and rooters will
carry on with the same spirit tomorrow at
Berkeley. We rooters have an obligation to
fulfillâ€”a challenge from our Berkeley rivals.
They have accused us of being a spiritless
bunch. How true that accusation is will only
be known tomorrow.
It will be tough matching lungs with a root
ing section four times bigger than ours, but with
the swell cheer leadership and excellent vocal
possibilities in the stands, we have a good
chance of out-yelling the Bears from State Uni
versity.
In the old days of frosh-soph brawls, rivalry
reached its peak a week before the game and
showed itself in every play on the field. Then
the Axe was put up as a Big Game trophy to
avoid the raids which v/ere so common and
dangerous. Two years ago raids on the Cal
campus were banned. Today we have neither
the bonfire nor the parade.
We aren't turning "sissy"; we have come to
realize that the right kind of spirit is not that
prompted by mob rule as was the case in re
gard to the Axe stealing and raids on Berkeley.
Our parade and bonfire were abandoned out of
necessity.
All we have left now out of the old tra
ditions are the rally and the Gaieties. The Gaie
ties cannot exactly be called a spirit-promoting
show, but it does add to a big week. Everything
has to be based on the rally; its effectiveness
or lack of effect will be known tomorrow.
For many years our rivalry bordered on in
tense hatred. Red sweaters and blue sweaters
were ripped off students sitting in the wrong
sides of the stadium. Bitter fist fights were com
mon.
Much of that has changed now. The loan of
several thousand cards for card stunts from the
California rally committee demonstrates this
point. Such a move several years ago would
have been called foolish. Both sides want to
see color added to the game, and the Cal people
realized that they held the controlling interest
this year.
To date raids have not taken place. Violators
will be dealt with severely, but we are in
clined to think that any move made to deface
property at Berkeley will not be prompted by
Stanford students. The old adventure is gone,
but in its place we have the "safe and sane"
generation of 1942 realizing that studies are
more important than hectic trips up the Penin
sula.
One thing won't change as long as there
is a Big Game. The players of both teams point
for this game all season; they are always ready
to play the best game of their lives. That spirit
has been instilled by the respective coaches and
by the players.
Big Game spirit for the alumni always re
mains the same. There are always those guys
who "hate to admit it, but that team back in
'06 had a lot more stuff." They get as much
kick out of the game as many of the students
do. Theirs is a never-failing loyalty to the alma
mater which comes after years of separation
from the old stamping grounds.
From the top of Tightwad Hill to the players'
benches, that ever-present Big Game spirit will
be there tomorrow. Hard to define but easy to
identify, that same Big Game spirit will carry
us through an afternoon free from worry about
the cares around us. Saturday night and Sun
day we will all get back to normal and find
that war talk and Big Game talk mix well if not
given an overdose of the latter.
