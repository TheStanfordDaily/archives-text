# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL STEIF 
This is Big Game week-end, and, for some rea
son, I am really getting all excited about it. Now
I know that isn't exactly the attitude to take, be
cause I know darn well that there are a lot more
serious things to worry about.
But somehow the old Big Game spirit has
once again reared its head and cannot be re
pressed. Maybe it all started last Saturday with
the tremendous show our football team put on.
Or maybe, for me, it started even before the
game itself last Saturday. You see, Salty (that's
Bob Sontag) and myself traveled up to Berkeley
last Saturday morning with the primary purpose
of interviewing one Leonard B. Allison.
Now Leonard 8., "the old Stubber" as he is
more affectionately known, has been maligned
a lot by the local scandal-sheets this season and
we wanted to know what this was all about. In
addition, I, having been somewhat anti-football
(or perhaps I should say anti-rahrah) all season,
wanted to know if my attitude was in any sense
justified. In other words, after having done a
lot of shouting all season I decided it was about
time to get some facts.
Yes, this is a frank admission.
Anyway, we got up to Berkeley and after
wandering about and getting lost several times
in the wilds of the California campus, we dis
covered Allison right in his office unperturbed
by the fact that his fooball team was playing a
game that afternoon.
Well, I came out of a 40-minute session with
"Stub" feeling like a lead two-bits.
Allison told Salty and myself a lot of things
that I, at least, just hadn't bothered to recog
nize. The rest was that he was sort of griped at
the attitude of a lot of sportswriters. He said
they were always taking a "negative attitude"
toward football. And then he explained that
football, despite the carping of a lot of critics,
is the basis for the expanded physical training
programs in almost every school in the coun
try. The cash made from football is the one
thing which has built for schools like Stanford
and Cal swimming pools and gyms and tennis
courts and all the rest of the elaborate para
phernalia which helps to keep physically fit the
million or so American students that go to col
lege.
Furthermore, without football's gate receipts
money that is now spent for the academic side
of a university would have to be diverted to
building gyms, tracks, and swimming pools.
Furthermore, men like General De Witt and
General Pershing are all for football. Further
more, football is the one thing that draws a
student body together, regardless of race, re
ligion, or affiliation.
From this you can get the general drift of
"Stub's" arguments. And they are really con
vincing. These were his reasons for his belief
that there will be football next year. They're
rational.
Now the result of all this brought me to the
conclusion that something (besides his job) is
worrying "Stub. It sort of seems to me as if
he is afraid that perhaps there is some big in
terest that is trying to put bigtime intercolle
giate football on the rocks. He didn't say any
thing at all about this but nevertheless from
the way he talked it appeared as if he thought
there was some interest that was trying to
muscle in on the money mat lies in college
football—on the money which goes right back
to the students in the form of better eguipment
and instruction.
Then coming back from Berkeley for our
game last Saturday afternoon we passed Bay
Meadows race track. There were a lot of people
there and a lot of cars—just as many, probably,
as were parked around our Stadium for our
game. And it occurred to me that this might be
one of the interests, or maybe the interest, that
was trying to clip football's wings. Now this
is just a vague hypothesis and I'll admit that I
don't know any facts that could back this idea
up, but I have sort of had a feeling, made a little
more definite by talking to "the Stubber" last
Saturday, that there are a lot of people through
out the nation who are trying to cut football off
at the knees.
I think this is a lot worse than some of the
intrinsic evils of rahrah football themselves, be
cause this will hit the colleges, and that sure
doesn't exclude Stanford, hard.
Anyway, I'm coming to appreciate football
a little more than I ever did before and maybe
that's why I'm so excited about this Big Game.

(or perhaps I should say anti-rahrah) all season,
wanted to know if my attitude was in any sense
justified. In other words, after having done a
lot of shouting all season I decided it was about
time to get some facts.
Yes, this is a frank admission.
Anyway, we got up to Berkeley and after
wandering about and getting lost several times
in the wilds of the California campus, we dis
covered Allison right in his office unperturbed
by the fact that his fooball team was playing a
game that afternoon.
Well, I came out of a 40-minute session with
"Stub" feeling like a lead two-bits.
Allison told Salty and myself a lot of things
that I, at least, just hadn't bothered to recog
nize. The rest was that he was sort of griped at
the attitude of a lot of sportswriters. He said
they were always taking a "negative attitude"
toward football. And then he explained that
football, despite the carping of a lot of critics,
is the basis for the expanded physical training
programs in almost every school in the coun
try. The cash made from football is the one
thing which has built for schools like Stanford
and Cal swimming pools and gyms and tennis
courts and all the rest of the elaborate para
phernalia which helps to keep physically fit the
million or so American students that go to col
lege.
Furthermore, without football's gate receipts
money that is now spent for the academic side
of a university would have to be diverted to
building gyms, tracks, and swimming pools.
Furthermore, men like General De Witt and
General Pershing are all for football. Further
more, football is the one thing that draws a
student body together, regardless of race, re
ligion, or affiliation.
From this you can get the general drift of
"Stub's" arguments. And they are really con
vincing. These were his reasons for his belief
that there will be football next year. They're
rational.
Now the result of all this brought me to the
conclusion that something (besides his job) is
worrying "Stub. It sort of seems to me as if
he is afraid that perhaps there is some big in
terest that is trying to put bigtime intercolle
giate football on the rocks. He didn't say any
thing at all about this but nevertheless from
the way he talked it appeared as if he thought
there was some interest that was trying to
muscle in on the money mat lies in college
football—on the money which goes right back
to the students in the form of better eguipment
and instruction.
Then coming back from Berkeley for our
game last Saturday afternoon we passed Bay
Meadows race track. There were a lot of people
there and a lot of cars—just as many, probably,
as were parked around our Stadium for our
game. And it occurred to me that this might be
one of the interests, or maybe the interest, that
was trying to clip football's wings. Now this
is just a vague hypothesis and I'll admit that I
don't know any facts that could back this idea
up, but I have sort of had a feeling, made a little
more definite by talking to "the Stubber" last
Saturday, that there are a lot of people through
out the nation who are trying to cut football off
at the knees.
I think this is a lot worse than some of the
intrinsic evils of rahrah football themselves, be
cause this will hit the colleges, and that sure
doesn't exclude Stanford, hard.
Anyway, I'm coming to appreciate football
a little more than I ever did before and maybe
that's why I'm so excited about this Big Game.
This is Big Game week-end, and, for some rea
son, I am really getting all excited about it. Now
I know that isn't exactly the attitude to take, be
cause I know darn well that there are a lot more
serious things to worry about.
But somehow the old Big Game spirit has
once again reared its head and cannot be re
pressed. Maybe it all started last Saturday with
the tremendous show our football team put on.
Or maybe, for me, it started even before the
game itself last Saturday. You see, Salty (that's
Bob Sontag) and myself traveled up to Berkeley
last Saturday morning with the primary purpose
of interviewing one Leonard B. Allison.
Now Leonard 8., "the old Stubber" as he is
more affectionately known, has been maligned
a lot by the local scandal-sheets this season and
we wanted to know what this was all about. In
addition, I, having been somewhat anti-football
(or perhaps I should say anti-rahrah) all season,
wanted to know if my attitude was in any sense

toward football. And then he explained that
football, despite the carping of a lot of critics,
is the basis for the expanded physical training
programs in almost every school in the coun
try. The cash made from football is the one
thing which has built for schools like Stanford
and Cal swimming pools and gyms and tennis
courts and all the rest of the elaborate para
phernalia which helps to keep physically fit the
million or so American students that go to col
lege.
Furthermore, without football's gate receipts
money that is now spent for the academic side
of a university would have to be diverted to
building gyms, tracks, and swimming pools.
Furthermore, men like General De Witt and
General Pershing are all for football. Further
more, football is the one thing that draws a
student body together, regardless of race, re
ligion, or affiliation.
From this you can get the general drift of
"Stub's" arguments. And they are really con
vincing. These were his reasons for his belief
that there will be football next year. They're
rational.
Now the result of all this brought me to the
conclusion that something (besides his job) is
worrying "Stub. It sort of seems to me as if
he is afraid that perhaps there is some big in
terest that is trying to put bigtime intercolle
giate football on the rocks. He didn't say any
thing at all about this but nevertheless from
the way he talked it appeared as if he thought
there was some interest that was trying to
muscle in on the money mat lies in college
football—on the money which goes right back
to the students in the form of better eguipment
and instruction.
Then coming back from Berkeley for our
game last Saturday afternoon we passed Bay
Meadows race track. There were a lot of people
there and a lot of cars—just as many, probably,
as were parked around our Stadium for our
game. And it occurred to me that this might be
one of the interests, or maybe the interest, that
was trying to clip football's wings. Now this
is just a vague hypothesis and I'll admit that I
don't know any facts that could back this idea
up, but I have sort of had a feeling, made a little
more definite by talking to "the Stubber" last
Saturday, that there are a lot of people through
out the nation who are trying to cut football off
at the knees.
I think this is a lot worse than some of the
intrinsic evils of rahrah football themselves, be
cause this will hit the colleges, and that sure
doesn't exclude Stanford, hard.
Anyway, I'm coming to appreciate football
a little more than I ever did before and maybe
that's why I'm so excited about this Big Game.
This is Big Game week-end, and, for some rea
son, I am really getting all excited about it. Now
I know that isn't exactly the attitude to take, be
cause I know darn well that there are a lot more
serious things to worry about.
But somehow the old Big Game spirit has
once again reared its head and cannot be re
pressed. Maybe it all started last Saturday with
the tremendous show our football team put on.
Or maybe, for me, it started even before the
game itself last Saturday. You see, Salty (that's
Bob Sontag) and myself traveled up to Berkeley
last Saturday morning with the primary purpose
of interviewing one Leonard B. Allison.
Now Leonard 8., "the old Stubber" as he is
more affectionately known, has been maligned
a lot by the local scandal-sheets this season and
we wanted to know what this was all about. In
addition, I, having been somewhat anti-football
(or perhaps I should say anti-rahrah) all season,
wanted to know if my attitude was in any sense
justified. In other words, after having done a
lot of shouting all season I decided it was about
time to get some facts.
Yes, this is a frank admission.
Anyway, we got up to Berkeley and after
wandering about and getting lost several times
in the wilds of the California campus, we dis
covered Allison right in his office unperturbed
by the fact that his fooball team was playing a
game that afternoon.
Well, I came out of a 40-minute session with
"Stub" feeling like a lead two-bits.
Allison told Salty and myself a lot of things
that I, at least, just hadn't bothered to recog
nize. The rest was that he was sort of griped at
the attitude of a lot of sportswriters. He said
they were always taking a "negative attitude"
toward football. And then he explained that
