The Editor, Sir:
In response to "I-Eat-at-the-Union." Certainly
some of our eating groups have meat and feel
no qualms of conscience either. They usually
have meatless lunches and feel that a single
meat meal a day lives up to the spirit of the
government's request completely.
I am reasonably sure that "I-E-A-T-U" usually
has two meat meals a day (even Union meat
counts) except for those days when the Union
policy forces him to abstain. Even a Law stu
dent can see that "I-U" has not figured this out
mathematically.
