# Professor Lewis Terman Suffers Severe Burns As Blaze Sweeps Home
## Fire; Demolishes One Entire Wing Of House; Two Students Rescue Psychology Head, Summon Firemen 
### DICK KEUSINK 
Professor Lewis M. Tennan, emeritus professor of psychology, was re
ported "much improved" last night after he suffered serious injuries when
a fire of unknown origin swept through the upper south wing of his resi
dence, 7(» 1 Dolores, at 4:154 Sunday morning. Dr. Thomas A. Storey, Ter
man's physician, told the Stanford police department that Dr. Terman was

suffering from "first and
degree burns on the back and was ,
overcome by smoke from the fire."
Two Stanford students, Verne
Freeman and Art Weller, perhaps
may be credited with saving Ter
man's life, according to reports.
Freeman and Weller were returning
from San Jose early Sunday morn
ing when they noticed a blaze in
back of the Sigma Nu house. Reach
ing the house, the two students found
Professor Terman lying unconscious
at the bottom of the stairs which led
upstairs to Terman's sleeping room.
"We could see the fire from the
Fiji house," said Weller. "When we
got there the whole upper story
seemed to be on fire. We dragged
Terman to the library and tele
phoned for the fire department;
that was all there was to it."
FELL DOWN STAIRS
Evidently Dr. Terman had awak
ened in the fire and attempted to
reach safety and had fallen down
stairs. According to Sergeant Head
ley who received the police report
on the fire, Freeman and Weller
broke into the house through the
French doors, called the fire depart
ment and then summoned the am
bulance.
Mrs. Terman was asleep at the
time of the fire and was only awak- :
ened when firemen entered the room
with the fire hoses.
The fire had traveled underneath i
a slate roof that covered the house |
and had mushroomed in the attic to 1
Professor Terman's study room. Only i
prompt action by the fire department
prevented the blaze from destroying
the whole house.
BURNED DOWNSTAIRS
When the firemen reached the j
scene, the fire had reached the i
downstairs and had burned the in- i
side of the door leading to the down- I
stairs library. By this time Dr. j
George Barnett of GG2 Mirada and j
his wife had arrived at Terman's 1
home and were caring for Dr. Tcr- j
man.
The whole Stanford fire depart- j
rnent responded to the call and got
the fire under control quickly. Part j
of the house was damaged by smoke
and water from fire hoses. All of
Professor Terman's books were saved j
although a considerable number of
them were damaged by the water.
The entire sleeping room was
(•leaned out by the blaze and clothes
and personal belongings were de
stroyed.
Mrs. Mclita H. Odcn, who was j
Working with Dr. Terman in his!
study of gifted children, declared ■
that she did not know the whole '
extent of the damage but "the gifted
study was not damaged as most of j
it was in the psychology department -
at the University." Most of the books
and other papers remained un- j
touched as they were in the study j
and the fire was mostly confined to |
the sleeping room.
Professor Terman recently retired
as acting head of the psychology dc- |
partment to work on projects con- :
cerning intelligence.
