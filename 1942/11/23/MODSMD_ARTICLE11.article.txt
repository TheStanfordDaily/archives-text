WASHINGTON, Nov. 22 (U.R) -
American losses in the big naval
battle off Guadalcanal were in
creased today to a total of nine ships
lost, with the announcement by the
Navy of the sinking of another U.S.
destroyer—but the score remained
lop-sided in our favor.
Sinking of the destroyer, which
was torpedoed, was disclosed in a
Navy communique which said the
ship—her name was not disclosed—
was damaged by an enemy torpedo
during the action on the night of
Nov. 14-15 and sank while en route
to an American base.
The entire personnel aboard the
ship including officers and crew
were reported rescued by another
destroyer and there was believed to
have been no loss of life.
Previously the Navy had an
nounced the loss of two light cruis
ers and six destroyers in the engage
ment which began the morning of
Nov. 13 and continued intermittently
until the morning of the 15th when
the giant Japanese invasion armada
turned tail in full retreat. Compared
with our losses, which now total
nine ships, the Japs lost 28 sunk, in
cluding certainly one and possibly
two battleships, and 10 damaged.
In the first announcement last
Monday of the naval engagement,
which for the first time in the war
in the Pacific brought together capi
tal ships of the Ameiican and Jap
anese navies, it was disclosed that
the Japs lost 2.'J ships including one
battleship, and seven were damaged.
Subsequently it was determined
that five more J;;p ships were sunk
and three damaged in the Nov. 14-15
action.
