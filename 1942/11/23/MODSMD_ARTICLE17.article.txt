# REDS RUIN BEARS, 26-7; AXE IS HOME
## Stanford Victory Personal Triumph For Indian Coach

Stanford's 26-7 Big Game win was a personal victory for Marchmont
"Marchie" Schwartz, the Indians' head football man.
It was personally engineered and personally achieved with the aid of
what appeared to he the Pacific Coast's best football team of Saturday,
Nov. 21.
On the fourth down in the initial quarter Marchie sent Dave Brown in
with a play that netted the Cards' first touchdown, slamming Don Zap
petini 14 yards inside left end and down the sidelines to the goal.
Again it was Schwartz, during the halftime period, telling Ray Hammelt
that Bear Frankie Porto would be a country cousin for the aerial thai
gained Stanford's third score.
As it happened in the iliird quarter, Hammett smacked Roger Lave) ly
with a perfect strike as Laverty gathered the ball in behind Grover
Klemmer.
Schwartz had the California pass defense figured and the play clicked,
although not exactly in toto.
Some San Francisco newspapers term Schwartz "Stanford's boy coach."
Marchie may be "boy" because it's his first year as football mentor, but
for a guy who lost stars such as Pete Kmetovic and Frankie Albert, and

would-be stars Jim Pettit and Hoot Armstrong, Schwartz is a he-man
coach, and a real good football man too.
But no one could credit the Stanford coach with all Ihe glory that w< i>l
into smothering the Bears and regaining the Stanford Axe for the Stanford
family.
To tell how complete the shellacking was would lie to say that ill,
that's right, !Jl, Rcdmcn found their way into the 1942 Big Game.
For the seven Big Game captains, lid Stamm, Hank Norberg, Chuck
Taylor. Bruno Banducci, Milt Vucinich, I.averty, and Ilammctt, it was
the glory road finish of intercollegiate football with the seven mugging
their way into a picture with the Stanford Axe.
And were they happy to have that Axe back home again! A host of
players stayed on the field when the gun sounded ending the game, and
were swept right along with student crowd that swarmed to the California
rooting section to claim its rightful dessert, that Stanford Axe.
The whole thing was deliriously wonderful.
To sec that California club beaten beyond a doubt was tops.

A San Francisco sportswriter had the stubbornness to say in his Ira I
yesterday that the Bears were "leaderless after they had lost their key
player." Although he tempered the statement by noting that the Bears wen
"pretty hopeless even when tiiey had him," elsewhere the conviction w;
that Jurkovich or no, Stanford won the most convincing Biy Game victors
in years. Incidentally, Grover Klemmer, who replaced Jurkovich, collec ted
a 5.7 gained yardage average.
San Francisco Chronicle Sporting Green pictures show that Fawo tt
never touched Jurkovich after Taylor had nailed him with a tackle aioun'i
the ankles—and not "amidships."
The particular play that sent Jurk out was hard football, nothing mot-
