# Gaieties Exceed Expectations Even of Its Publicity Agent
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
t'e Ti: i lies! If we'd been around sinee IS!!X, we might be able to
sav i last Friday's production was the best of the lot. But we can say
ll it \ \\;:s tremendously and even unexpectedly good, and after spend
in;: :» weekend trving to find something to pan, all we can do is go over-
I i •)!) per cent f«i the 1942 conglomeration.

And here are several bows to Bob :
O'Neill and company.
They brought forth two new defi
nitely brilliant stars, they made the
most of basically good material, and j
they produced a Gaieties we've been |
waiting for for a long time.
PUBLICITY NO EAKE
In fact, if you want to know what |
we really think, go back and read the |
gigantic publicity story in Friday's !
Daily—and believe every word of it!
After the matinee we had begun to
think we'd gone off the deep end
with advance superlative adjectives
and praise, but very early in the
evening performance all the predic
tions were ringing true.
The two new stars have become
traditions by now. Harry Dyck and
Bob Rockwell will get our laughter
and applause anytime—and how for
tunate their appearances in the show
were not infrequent.
Rockwell and cohorts were riot
ously successful as the personnel of
radio broadcasts, and Dyck was here,
there, and everywhere, an inebriated
ace who never failed to steal his
scenes.
NO POOR SKITS
The skits were all remarkable—
not a stinker in the lot—and although
dialogue was sparce, it was not
needed; one of the more effective
acts was the perfectly silent "Silent
Night.''
Special comment goes to the danc
ers in "Sundown"; they were "rip
ply. poury, wiggly" and good. We
could probably say something very
nice about the singers if we'd been
able to hear them—but those poor
accoustics.
O'NEIE'S ALBERT NEAT
The Big Game even got in the
show, and that authentic Albert
pose by O'Neill, grin, left arm and
all, was a fitting climax to a darn
good show.
The 1 per cent we didn't take
overboard with us was that dele
gated to some rather poor spotting. '
We can almost forget that, however, !
because we were really entertained.
