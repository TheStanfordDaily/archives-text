## 
### 
Intramural grid playoffs Open this
afternoon when heavily favored
Firehouse goes up against El Toro,
League 1 champion, at 4 p.m. on the

row with the rest of the playoff
clashes, the contest was moved up
because several blaze chasers are
leaving Tuesday for Thanksgiving
vacation. The other three quarter
final games will be run off tomor
row.
Firehouse, last year's champions,
are expected to drop the Toros with
out too much trouble, although Toro
backlield aces Carlos Brown and
George Tolman might log things up
a bit, especially if the Toros get
their tricky man-in-motion offense
going.

threater Jerry Roinestad. Newcomer
to the blaze chaser seven, Roinestad,
behind the blocking of veterans Tom
Krueger and Frank Wheeler, has
scored the majority of Firehouse's
points this season.

records to date, the Toro outfit has
had close calls in three of their five
contests, while the Firehouse, play
ing in a tougher league, was in dan
ger of defeat only once.
