# Frosh Poloists Stop California
## 
### 
Stanford's freshman water polo
team wound up an undefeated sea
son by defeating the California
freshmen, 8-5, Saturday morning at
Berkeley. The score was exactly the
same as last week's Stanford win
over the Bears.
"Stop Armstrong and you stop
California" was the keynote of the
Indian defense, and they .stopped
Armstrong, high-scoring California
forward. It was Walt Lull, Stanford
center back, who limited Armstrong
to one measly point in the first
quarter.
Meanwhile, Lull and his team
mates Hugh West, Jim Livingston,
Clyde Burch, Russell Lee, and Bar
rett Weber were running up the
Card point totals. Lull and Weber
scored two each, while Bruch, Liv
ingston, West, and Lee scored one
apiece. Â«
Lee took the train to Berkeley and
missed the first quarter of the game.
His presence was one of the reasons
Stanford pulled away in the second
half.
After Stanford had taken an early
first quarter lead, the Bears came
back to tie up the game, 4-4, at half
time. But the second half found the
Indians "outplaying them complete
ly," according to Coach Ernie
Brandsten.
