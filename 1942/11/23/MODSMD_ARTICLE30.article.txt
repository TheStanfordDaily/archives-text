# Cat Beats Spirited Card Crew

### BILL HORNBY 
By a scanty four and one-half
feet Stanford's first varsity crew
j since 1921 lost to California Satur
j day morning over a 2,000-meter
course on Oakland Estuary.
If any sports event ever deserved
! the term "moral victory," this was
it. Both shells were off to an even
J start, and most of the race was on
j a neck-to-neck basis. Only at the
finish line did Cal's longer back
j ground of experience in the rhythm
j of stroking inch them into a vic
! tory.
"We had the crew all right," said
I Coach Carl Pedersen after the race.
[ "But Ihey got sort of tangled up on
their stroking and Cal got in one
j extra stroke before the finish. If
j we had gotten in our final stroke, it
J would have been a different story."
After the even start, the Stanford
, shell rowed at 29 strokes a minute. ,
This was a drop of a stroke from I
their predetermined program, and
I Cal led for about a quarter of the 1
J way.
Then the Stanfords pulled even,
! and Cal had to row at 35 strokes a
minute to match a powerhouse
Stanford 29. At the finish Stanford
j was more than matching the Cal 35
| with a 31 count. Evidently there
! was some timing "tie-up" since
: Stanford rowers thought that their
j count was higher, as it ea.sily could
jhave been.
An added difficulty was the float
| ing driftwood which marred the
course.
But perhaps these are minor de
tails compared to this basic fact: a
I Stanford crew which two years ago
began with an oarlock and a prayer,
as the hobby of some shell enthu
siasts, has become a strong enough
organization to come within an ace
lof trimming Cal. And with two
more quarters of training under
their belts, they'll do it this spring.
It is another proof that a group
of determined students can make
what they want become an actu
ality. Crew members now have
j Circle S's, three shells, gym credit,
j scheduled races with most of the
important racing schools on the
Coast, and. most important of all,
i the knowledge that they are ca
| pable of playing in the "big time."
