STANFORD'S rooters should be compli
mented on the way that they supported the
team during the game. They seemed to have
felt much as the team did and did not lose in
terest in the game after our victory seemed cer
tain.
Stanford's rooters should be complimented
on the way they cheered for California's Jim
Jurkovich as he walked off the field after being
injured. It was a sincere cheer of a worthy rival.
The rooter's knew that Stanford would win and
they would rather have had Jurkovich in the
game.
But most of all the Stanford rooters should
be complimented for the way they co-operated
with the rally committee both in giving the card
stunts and in returning the cards to California.
Last year at the Santa Clara game Rally Com
mittee tried to have card stunts but received
no co operation and they had to be abandoned.
All that was asked of the students was that they
pass the color cards over. Even with the use of
public address system this simple request was
not granted by the rooters.
V/ith no public address system to guide them,
the rooters co-operated with Jim Mcßrier's hand
language very well and did an admirable job
on the stunts.
After the stunts were over no one started to
tear up the cards but passed them to the aisle.
It is a sign that the rooters appreciated Cal's
lending us the cards and also a sign that we
can co-operate and be mature. —A1 Hampson
