# How Well Did We Do?
## 
### 
WITH the giving of the engraved beet knife
at the Big Game Rally Thursday night, the
call on Stanford's reservoir of labor has stopped
for the guarter.
How well did Stanford meet this call? Some
26 livirg groups gave 240 workers who worked
a total of 1,084 hours and topped and loaded
642,760 pounds of beets with each man averag
ing 2,670 pounds.
When tabulated this seems like a lot of hours
and a lot of time taken from studying. But then
also when tabulated it doesn't seem like too
many hours to be given toward the easing of
the sugar shortage.
Stanford met the call. Maybe not 100 per
cent because there were men who signed up
and never came and there were those who
didn't sign up at all, but we will have a chance
next guarter to again meet the challenge when
another labor shortage develops.—Al Hampson
