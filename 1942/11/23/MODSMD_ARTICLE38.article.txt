HIT 'EM AGAIN . . . !
And the United Nations roll on! While the
advance continues in Africa, and increased lap
losses are announced from the sea-fight off
the Solomons, new and genuine gains are an
nounced from Russia and the East. Before Sta

lingrad, the Soviets are hammering hard and ef
rectively at the Nazis, and London reports that
a German withdrawal may be expected. The
recent break-through to Leningrad and the suc
cessful holding of the Caucasus, with this, set
the stage for another successful winter offen

Sir Stafford Cripps has just been demoted
from the British War Cabinet. No satisfactory
reason is given. His three positions, Vice-Pre
mier, Leader of Commons, and Lord Privy Seal
have been divided up and Cripps is now Min
ister of Aircraft Production, a member of the
Cabinet, but not the War Cabinet, the policy
making seven-man group around Churchill.
The Prime Minister's official announcement was
that the demotion was "solely to meet a most
serious war need." Opposition circles in Eng
land are reported as saying that, now that the
victory in Africa has so strengthened Church
ill's position, he no longer needs Cripps' po
litical support. Cripps, as the reader doubtless
knows, is a leftist of the left, so radical that he
was expelled from the Labor party. Churchill
is a Conservative of the Conservatives.

For the information of male Stanford, I guote
from Time the interesting item that it is a "good
bet" that the students now in college as mem
bers of a reserve will be called soon. Maybe
the 900-odd Stanfordites at Del Monte for the
week-end can regard it as a last bust.

The Allied air forces have been raising hell
in Italy. The port of Genoa is reported as vir
tually destroyed. This, however, apparently
does not indicate an immediate invasion of Italy.
Genoa is one of the principal ports of supply
for North Africa and it would seem that the
object is not so much to soften up the Boot for
invasion but, more practically, to cut off sup
plies to Tripoli. Incidentally, Genoa is the tra
ditional birthplace of Christopher Columbus,
and its destruction by American planes should
doubtless be significant of something.
The bombing of Italy raises, as noted, the
question of the eventual invasion. Invasion
there must be; it is inconceivable that Hitler
will accept our terms of unconditional surren
der, which must be our terms, without bringing
the war a lot physically closer to Germany than
it has yet come. My own pet theory is an in
vasion of Italy and then into the Balkans, across
the Adriatic; but any invasion would be wel
come, very welcome, and it won't hurt my
feelings wherever it is.

Sir Stafford Cripps has just been demoted
from the British War Cabinet. No satisfactory
reason is given. His three positions, Vice-Pre
mier, Leader of Commons, and Lord Privy Seal
have been divided up and Cripps is now Min
ister of Aircraft Production, a member of the
Cabinet, but not the War Cabinet, the policy
making seven-man group around Churchill.
The Prime Minister's official announcement was
that the demotion was "solely to meet a most
serious war need." Opposition circles in Eng
land are reported as saying that, now that the
victory in Africa has so strengthened Church
ill's position, he no longer needs Cripps' po
litical support. Cripps, as the reader doubtless
knows, is a leftist of the left, so radical that he
was expelled from the Labor party. Churchill
is a Conservative of the Conservatives.

For the information of male Stanford, I guote
from Time the interesting item that it is a "good

The Allied air forces have been raising hell
in Italy. The port of Genoa is reported as vir
tually destroyed. This, however, apparently
does not indicate an immediate invasion of Italy.
Genoa is one of the principal ports of supply
for North Africa and it would seem that the
object is not so much to soften up the Boot for
invasion but, more practically, to cut off sup
plies to Tripoli. Incidentally, Genoa is the tra
ditional birthplace of Christopher Columbus,
and its destruction by American planes should
doubtless be significant of something.
The bombing of Italy raises, as noted, the
question of the eventual invasion. Invasion
there must be; it is inconceivable that Hitler
will accept our terms of unconditional surren
der, which must be our terms, without bringing
the war a lot physically closer to Germany than
it has yet come. My own pet theory is an in
vasion of Italy and then into the Balkans, across
