# BULL SESSION
## 
### H. D. THOREAU 
Nothing could have given me any more pleas
ure last Saturday than did the 26-7 beating our
football team gave California's, unless it might
be a 126-7 beating.
It's fun to win football games by large mar
gins, but in most games as long as we win it
doesn't matter about the score. In the Cal game,
however, it's a different matterâ€”at least it is to
me. The more we pile it on, the better I like it.
Occasionally I forget for a moment why I feel
this way about Cal, but then I go up to Berkeley
and I see and hear and smell the Cal rooters
and I remember again, vividly.
Last Saturday those 15,000 sons of the Blue
and Gold were in rare form. They came with
their rolls of bathroom stationery and other simi
lar eguipment. They came, not so much intent
on watching and helping their football team win
the game, as they were determined to make as
much noise as they could at all times and, evi
dently, make as big fools of themselves as
possible.
Therefore, it was with great pleasure that I
took time out from celebrating the scoring of
our first touchdown to look across the stadium
at that temporarily silent group. And they be
came more silent as the game went on.
I remembered last year's Big Game played at
our stadium when I was unfortunately sitting
directly above their rooting section. I remem
bered the rough afternoon we three Stanford
students had being on the short end of a 16-0
score and facing the jeers of the entire Bear
rooting section all day as they turned around to
taunt us.
For this reason I hated to see them get even
one touchdown Saturday, and hated to see them
celebrating after it as if they had won the game.
But it wasn't until after the game when Stan
ford went across the field that I really got the
full blast of "Cal spirit.'' We went up into the
Cal section while the Axe-changing-hands cere
mony and singing were going on. The three
guys behind us are noisily finishing off a guart
of cheap bourbon. The paper is flying all over.
Up the section goes the red megaphone. Every
body is shouting and cheering while we are
singing our hym. Soon everybody is running
out on the field swiping little girls' pom-poms.
All of which is great sport, no doubt.
Undoubtedly these impressions will stay with
me until February when again I will see the
Cal rooters, only at closer range, in their basket
ball pavilion where fruit, fish, and birds are
standard equipment.
