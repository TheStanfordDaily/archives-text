political, economic, and cultural in
alienable rights rest upon the unique
value attached to the human per
sonality.
The practical demonstration will j
include a study of the "Natural Law" j
as outlined by Cicero, the Stoics, the
poets and moralists of Greece and
Rome, Vittoria, Suarez, and the mor
alists and theologians of the Whig
Party, and accepted by the founding
fathers to serve as a moral form of
social and political endeavor.
This course will be offered simul
taneously at the Extension Division
of the University of California, San
Francisco Center, in the section
"Philosophy," according to Profes
sor Reinhardt.
