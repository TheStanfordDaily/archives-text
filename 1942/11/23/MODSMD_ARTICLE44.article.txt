# Current Film Poor Version Of Hit Play

IVIY SISTER EILEEN, now playing
at the Stanford.
I am surprised that, of all people,
Alexander Hall and staff should not
have realized there is an essen
tial difference "oetween a play and
a motion picture. You cannot take
a play, even as successful a play as
"My Sister Eileen," photograph it,
and call it a successful motion pic
ture.
Here is a set, here is a character.
A knock; another character enters;
dialogue; a character goes out; dia
logue; another character is seen
arriving out the window; he enters;
dialogue; various things happen;
the scene does not change; nobody
moves but in a restricted range;
everybody talks too much and tries
hard. This is a play on the screen.
And what was on the stage a
sparkling comedy hit is on the
screen a drab series of scenes with
but occasional spurts.
Now "The Male Animal" and
"The Man Who Came to Dinner"
were successful plays made into
movies; but their production jobs
were still skillful enough to make
the pictures successful in spite of
incomplete transformations from
play to movie. Both these pictures
suffered from not being made to
conform to the motion picture me
dium, but "My Sister Eileen" falls
almost as flat as "Room Service" for
failure of transformation.
A motion picture possesses possi
bilities hardly realized in the best
of productions. Yet material as first
rate as "My Sister Eileen" contin
ues presented with limitations
of the stage.
Not that the picture does not still
have some moments. And the act
ing is fine.
Being a Lone Wolf fan from way
back, in spite of Warren Williams'
over-long sideburns and washed
out appearance, I thought the sec
ond feature was better than the
first. It was notably superior in at
least one aspect: it was a movie.
The omission of the Bach-Sto
kowski Toccata and Fugue is re
grettable, as is the slicing of other
numbers, and the impossibility of
hearing the original Fantasound.
But the show is still one of the
most magnificent productions of
modern art and modern theater,
whatever Dr. Allen's statements to
the contrary.â€”Covey
