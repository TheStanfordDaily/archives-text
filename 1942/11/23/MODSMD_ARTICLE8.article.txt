### 
i LONDON, Monday, Nov. 23 (U.R) !
| â€”British advance forces in Tunisia I
have inflicted heavy damage on a j
German armored column, Allied
headquarters announced today, and
the zero hour was believed near for
a mass Anglo-American assault on
j Axis positions around Tunis and Bi
zerte.
Madrid dispatches said a big battle
j already was under way at Mateur,
| 20 miles south of the great Bizerte
j naval base.
Softening up the Axis defenses in i
| preparation for the Allied onslaught,
j American flying fortresses, escorted
by P-38 Lockheed Lightning fight
! ers, smashed at the Tunis airfield
j Saturday, destroying five planes on
! the ground, damaging others and
j scoring hits on hangars and ware
houses. Four German fighters were
| shot down in dogfights.
NAZI CLAIMS
The Nazi Parts radio said that
j "the ceaseless arrival" of reinforce
ments at Bizerte and Tunis had en
abled the Axis forces to take up
positions according to plan.
The latest Allied communique gave
no clue to the locale of the engage
ment in which the British blasted at
the German armored column Satur
-1 day, but it was presumed to be some- j
where along the coast west of Bi- j
zcrte.
French garrisons are resisting the j
Axis forces despite Marshal Henri
Philippe Petain's orders not to hin
der the Germans and Italians, the
! communique said.
One French force already has
| withstood two "vigorous" German
attacks despite relatively severe
| losses, the communique said.
PATROLS OPERATING
French patrols are operating far ;
j to the rear of Axis advanced posi
tions, it added.
(The German radio claimed that
Junkers 88 dive bombers destroyed
10 flying fortresses on the ground
j near Bone, 50 miles west of Tunisia,
j and set fire to hangars at the Algiers
airdrome.)
A French communique quoted by
the Morocco radio said the desperate
I Nazis had dispatched troops from
i Tripolitania to try to blast their way
1 through the Allied siege lines and
; relieve the Axis garrisons in Tunis
and Bizerte, but if this was true
I there was no indication that they
j had made any progress.
