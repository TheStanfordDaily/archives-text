## Limit of —6 to —30 Set by Committee For Lower Division 
### PAT CLARY 
Rules governing probation and dis
qualification because of gradepoint
deficiency have been revised and
simplified, Professor Pbilip W. Buck,
chairman of the Committee on
Scholarship, announced yesterday.
The new rules apply to all students
registered in lower division and take
effect at once.
A flat limit of —6 to —30 points
has been fixed for all lower division
students, regardless of how long they
have been in attendance.
When a student's accumulated de
ficiency reaches —6, he will be
placed on probation to warn him
that his work is unsatisfactory. If
the deficiency persists, and his grade
points fall as low as —31, the stu
dent will be disqualified from fur
ther attendance at Stanford, Dr.
Buck said.
No provision has been made for
immediate reinstatement and con
ditional registration. When a stu
dent is disqualified, he must leave
the University. If, in spite of his
efforts, a student's deficiency reaches
—31, the committee said it would
consider this evidence that further
effort to meet Stanford standards
was unwarranted and that disquali
fication was justified.
The new rules replace the sliding
scale of gradepoint deficiency ad
justed according to the student's
quarter in the University, on which
basis probation and disqualification
formerly were imposed.
Mrs. Olivia Byler, scholarship
secretary, will answer questions on
the application of the rules in the
Registrar's Office Monday to Friday
mornings.
