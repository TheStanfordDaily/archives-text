### BOB FISHER 
"Twelve Months After Pearl Har
bor" will be the subject of a leelure
to be given tonight hy Howard
Pierce Davis, author, news commen
tator, and lecturer, at 7:30 in the
Memorial Hall Auditorium in the |
Tuesday Evening Series program. |
Concerning the topic of his lecture, f
Mr. Davis recently said, "For a time |
we were under the illusion that the I
war was a European war. That il- |
lusion was soon dispelled. Pearl
Harbor completed the disillusion
ment. The issues of battle are now
world issues. A global war involv
ing world issues can only be satis
factorily terminated and settled in
terms of global terms. No local ap
plication of superficial remedies will
suffice. The whole global habitat of
mankind is now under surgery, and
post-war treatments must be uni
versal in scope."
ANNUAL TOUR
Until the outbreak of war in 1939
Mr. Davis toured Europe each year.
In 1931 he sat in the Brown House
at Munich and heard Adolf Hitler
predict his rise to power. When the
prediction was fulfilled in 1933, the
Fuhrer mailed Davis a reminder of
the interview.
Concerning the future, Mr. Davis
believes that America must begin
now to think and plan for the kind of
world she wants after the war, or we
may again lose the peace.
"World organization will be no
push-over," he states. "Page the
politicians of 1919 and see what we
mean. Only an irrational optimist
will ignore the probability of the
appearance, even on the American
stage, of a flock of demagogues, re
actionaries, and isolationists who
will try to browbeat the American
electorate into a repudiation of the
i Four Freedoms and the Atlantic
Charter."
OBJECTIVES CLEAR
The lecturer will be remembered
for his talk last fall in the Tuesday
Evening Series on "History or Hys
teria." He has recently written a
book with that title which will be
published soon.
'Mr. Davis states that the objectives
of this war are crystal clear. He
names as the five objectives of the
United Nations: Liberation, freedom,
salvation of the democratic concept,
peace, and some form of world or
ganization.
His interpretation of freedom is
one which will insure the freedom
of all nations to share on equal terms
in the distribution of the world's
goods. "The attainment of this ob
jective involves more than the de
feat of the Axis. It means the defeat
of powerful elements within the
United Nations who are still plan
ning to retain a monopolistic control
of commodities and economic privi
lege."

to be given tonight hy Howard
Pierce Davis, author, news commen
tator, and lecturer, at 7:30 in the
Memorial Hall Auditorium in the |
Tuesday Evening Series program. |
Concerning the topic of his lecture, f
Mr. Davis recently said, "For a time |
we were under the illusion that the I
war was a European war. That il- |
lusion was soon dispelled. Pearl
Harbor completed the disillusion
ment. The issues of battle are now
world issues. A global war involv
ing world issues can only be satis
factorily terminated and settled in
terms of global terms. No local ap
plication of superficial remedies will
suffice. The whole global habitat of
mankind is now under surgery, and
post-war treatments must be uni
versal in scope."
ANNUAL TOUR
Until the outbreak of war in 1939
Mr. Davis toured Europe each year.
In 1931 he sat in the Brown House
at Munich and heard Adolf Hitler
predict his rise to power. When the
prediction was fulfilled in 1933, the
Fuhrer mailed Davis a reminder of
the interview.
Concerning the future, Mr. Davis
believes that America must begin
now to think and plan for the kind of
world she wants after the war, or we
may again lose the peace.
"World organization will be no
push-over," he states. "Page the
politicians of 1919 and see what we
mean. Only an irrational optimist
will ignore the probability of the
appearance, even on the American
stage, of a flock of demagogues, re
actionaries, and isolationists who
will try to browbeat the American
electorate into a repudiation of the
i Four Freedoms and the Atlantic
Charter."
OBJECTIVES CLEAR
The lecturer will be remembered
for his talk last fall in the Tuesday
Evening Series on "History or Hys
teria." He has recently written a
book with that title which will be
published soon.
'Mr. Davis states that the objectives
of this war are crystal clear. He
names as the five objectives of the
United Nations: Liberation, freedom,
salvation of the democratic concept,
peace, and some form of world or
ganization.
His interpretation of freedom is
one which will insure the freedom
of all nations to share on equal terms
in the distribution of the world's
goods. "The attainment of this ob
jective involves more than the de
feat of the Axis. It means the defeat
of powerful elements within the
United Nations who are still plan
ning to retain a monopolistic control
of commodities and economic privi
lege."
