# Oral Poliomyelitis Infection Shown
## 
### 
The Stanford University School of
Medicine has demonstrated that the
dreaded infantile paralysis virus may
enter the body through the nerves of
the mouth. This is the first conclu
sive evidence of poliomyelitis infec
tion by the mouth in the early, pre
paralytic stage. Other' suspected
portals have been the nose and the
intestinal tract.
Dr. Harold K. Faber, Stanford pro
fessor of pediatrics, and his assistant,
Rosalie J. Silberberg, state in the
current issue of Science that the
mouth and pharynx arc readily vul
nerable to penetration by the virus,
but this does not exclude other por
tals of entry. However, he says, it is
pertinent to note the very frequent
occurrence of headaches, vomiting,
neck pains, and other symptoms in
the early stage of the human disease
strongly suggest early involvement
of the brain system which is better
accounted for by entry through the
mouth and pharynx than from the
more distant intestines.
The discovery is considered im
portant because the mouth is the
first surface to be exposed to food
and drink contaminated with virus,
and, especially in the case of chil
dren, to fingers similarly contami
nated and put in the mouth.
