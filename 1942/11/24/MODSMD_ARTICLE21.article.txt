he was feeling "about the same."

being rescued from the fire by Art

not yet been estimated; insurance

Department estimates the damage
will run "somewhere between $2,000
and $2,500."

when the fire completely wiped out
his upstairs sleeping room. Most of
the books in his study were saved,
although some were badly damaged
by water from the fire hoses. Rooms
directly beneath his bedroom were
flooded with water.
