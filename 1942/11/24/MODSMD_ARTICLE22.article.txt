Headquarters announced yesterday.
Owners of binoculars of the Zeiss

7x50 type, who wish to lend (hem to
the Navy for the duration are now
asked to send or bring them to the
Office of Public Relations, Room 105,
Federal Office Building, San Fran

returned promptly to the owners.
The Navy Department has given
assurance that all glacces accepted

Washington, the Navy Department
will forward the donor a check for
$1 in formal acknowledgment of the
transaction.
