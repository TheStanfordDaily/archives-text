# Americans Near Conquest of All French Africa

LONDON, Tuesday. Nov. 24 (UP)
—The Allies appeared close to the
climax of their campaign Jo con
trol all French Africa today, with
their reported acquisition of Dakar
opposite the bulge of Brazil and
further penetration toward Bizerte
and Tunis, which command the Si
cilian narrows.
Admiral Jean Darlan, nominal
French leader under the Allied oc
cupation of French North Africn,
announced over the Algiers radio
that Dakar and French West Af
rica have placed themselves "under
my orders." Neither London nor
Washington confirmed the report at.
once, but Allied spokesmen saw no
reason to doubt it.
The Morocco radio reported that
the Allies, having launched a pow
erful drive to crush the last Axis
positions in northeast Tunisia, were
advancing in the Suk El Arba re
gion 80 miles southwest of Tunis in
a frontal assault against Axis po
sitions.
ALLIES NEAR BIZERTE
However, they appeared much
nearer their goals in drives on the
flanks. Madrid dispatches said An
glo-American forces were within
20 miles of Bizerte on the north Tu
nisia coastal road and Berlin ad
mitted that a heavy battle was rag
ing over a harbor 30 miles from
Tunis, presumably southeast of the
city on the Gulf of Hammamet.
Axis forces tried to counter-at
tack in the Suk El Arba area but;
were hurled back, losing 10 of their
precious tanks and many prisoners,
the Morocco radio said, quoting a
French high command communi
que.
ACCORDING TO PLAN
An Allied communique said the
concentration of American and
British troops in Tunisia was con
tinuing according to plan and that
in one engagement Allied forces
took 40 Axis prisoners. Other
ground fighting was minor, the
communique said, but Allied fight
er planes have downed nine enemy
aircraft in new offensive sweeps.
As interpreted here, Darlan's an
nouncement could only mean that
Dakar and French West Africa were
putting themselves fully at the dis
posal of the Allies and that pos
sibly the 50,000 French troops and
powerful French fleet units based
at Dakar might actively join the
fight against the Axis.
Dakar is 2,600 miles around the
curving African coast line from the
Tunisian fighting front but its
bloodless capitulation is expected to
free valuable Allied strength for
the campaigns against Bizerte and
Tunis and other objectives in the
Mediterranean.
Thus the Allies now control all
of French Africa except the nar
row corner of northeast Tunisia
I and the coast line of all the rest of
| the Dark Continent except Spanish

LONDON, Tuesday. Nov. 24 (UP)
—The Allies appeared close to the
climax of their campaign Jo con
trol all French Africa today, with
their reported acquisition of Dakar
opposite the bulge of Brazil and
further penetration toward Bizerte
and Tunis, which command the Si
cilian narrows.
Admiral Jean Darlan, nominal
French leader under the Allied oc
cupation of French North Africn,
announced over the Algiers radio
that Dakar and French West Af
rica have placed themselves "under
my orders." Neither London nor
Washington confirmed the report at.
once, but Allied spokesmen saw no
reason to doubt it.
The Morocco radio reported that
the Allies, having launched a pow
erful drive to crush the last Axis
positions in northeast Tunisia, were
advancing in the Suk El Arba re
gion 80 miles southwest of Tunis in
a frontal assault against Axis po
sitions.
ALLIES NEAR BIZERTE
However, they appeared much
nearer their goals in drives on the
flanks. Madrid dispatches said An
glo-American forces were within
20 miles of Bizerte on the north Tu
nisia coastal road and Berlin ad
mitted that a heavy battle was rag
ing over a harbor 30 miles from
Tunis, presumably southeast of the
city on the Gulf of Hammamet.
Axis forces tried to counter-at
tack in the Suk El Arba area but;
were hurled back, losing 10 of their
precious tanks and many prisoners,
the Morocco radio said, quoting a
French high command communi
que.
ACCORDING TO PLAN
An Allied communique said the
concentration of American and
British troops in Tunisia was con
tinuing according to plan and that
in one engagement Allied forces
took 40 Axis prisoners. Other
ground fighting was minor, the
communique said, but Allied fight
er planes have downed nine enemy
aircraft in new offensive sweeps.
As interpreted here, Darlan's an
nouncement could only mean that
Dakar and French West Africa were
putting themselves fully at the dis
posal of the Allies and that pos
sibly the 50,000 French troops and
powerful French fleet units based
at Dakar might actively join the
fight against the Axis.
Dakar is 2,600 miles around the
curving African coast line from the
Tunisian fighting front but its
bloodless capitulation is expected to
free valuable Allied strength for
the campaigns against Bizerte and
Tunis and other objectives in the
Mediterranean.
