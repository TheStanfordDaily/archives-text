# WMC Encourages Majors in Physics
## 
### 
Paul V. McNutt, director of the i
War Manpower Commission, last
week amended the student war loan
plan to give special encouragement
to students majoring in physics.
The rule specifying that a college
must have 10 qualified majors in a
certain field before any student in
that field was eligible to receive a
war loan, has been abolished for
physics majors.
