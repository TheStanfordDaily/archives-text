QUARTERS. Australia, Tuesday,
Nov. 24 (UP). â€”Australian troops
have stormed into Gona Mission on
the northeastern coast of New Gui
nea and now are mopping up the
remnants of its Japanese defenders,
while American forces, smashing
ahead despite heavy resistance,
pushed to within a mile of Buna,
15 miles down the coast from Gona,
Allied headquarters announced to
day.
The Australians have not yet
taken Gona and fighting still is in
progress inside the village, but
all Japanese positions in the 15-mile
stretch between Buna and Gona
were reported in serious peril as
the joint forces hit at them from
all directions but north.
Climaxing a drive that had car
ried them some 100 miles across
the waist of eastern New Guinea
in two months, the Australians
stormed into Gona yesterday and
some of them then began fanning
down the coast towai'd Sanananda,
nine miles away, to join other Al
lied troops smashing in from the
west.
The Americans, pushing on Buna
from the south and southeast, have
occupied Cape Endaiadere, two and
a half miles south of the village,
said the mid-day communique from
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur's main
headquarters here.
