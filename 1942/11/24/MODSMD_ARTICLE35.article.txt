# Upset! Toros Tumble Firehouse
## Fijis Beaten in Overtime By Dekes, 7-0 
### BILL HORNBY 
The Firehouse finally lost its hold
on the Farm intramural football title
yesterday afternoon.
An aggressive El Toro squad end
ed a four-year reign in the grid
sport for the blaze chasers with an
aggressive and deserved 1-0 over
time victory, after holding the ex
champ's running attack to a stale
mate during the regular period.
Dekes slipped by Fiji, 7-0.
The Toro upset has been a goal of
many Row and Hall teams, but it
was achieved by a squad which was
not even considered to be under
consideration as a possibility.
CONVINCING VICTORY
No rationalization can alter the
fact that Firehouse was convincingly
beaten. Their blocking and running
were still in evidence, but the Toro
line tightened up and the Toro back
field backed 'em up, and it was no
go.
During the regular period, both
teams kept each other in the mid
portions of the field. End sweeps by
Toro speedster Carlos Brown almost
materialized twice, but the defense
of men like Tom Kruger always
turned up just in time for the blaze
chasers.
Late in the fourth period two flips
by Toro's Doug Marshall and George
Tolman brought the blaze chasers
back on their heels, but a fumble
ended the threat.
PLAYOFF SUMMARY
Here's what happened in the play
off: (The ball was placed on the 50
and both teams were given five al
ternate plays—the yardage advan
tage wins.)
Firehouse was put behind imme
diately when quarterback Jerry
Roinsted was nabbed by slashing
Louis Sloss on his own 41.
George Tolman got nowhere on a
wide right-end sweep for Toro.
Roinsted faked a pass and flashed
through center to the 49, lacking a
yard of being on the healthy side of
the middle.
PASS DISALLOWED
A Tolman pass which bounced out
of Sloss' arms to Tom Morton was
disallowed. A long pass by Roinsted
was knocked down by Bob Sontag
in the Toro backfield.
Another Toro pass was knocked
down, and a Firehouse drive bogged
at the line. Then Doug Marshall un
leashed a 40-yard pass to Carlos
Brown and it was all over for Fire
house.
The Dekes and Fijis agreed that
should their game end in a tie, the
game would be extended 10 minutes.
It was fatal for the latter. After
holding the famed Joslyn-Hooper
passes and the supposedly rested
from - the - weekend De k e line
throughout the regular period, the
Fijis finally gave up in the second
overtime period.
HARMS IS FIJI STAR
Bill Harms was the whole Fiji
team, submarining into the best of
the Deke efforts. But a pass from
Bill Joslyn to Chuck Hooper in the
second overtime connected over the
"shot" Fiji secondary.
Harry Wolter. mural director, an
nounced last night that all playoffs
for the rest of the series will be J}y
the official 50-yard-line method. No
more mutual agreement changes.
Today Zete meets 2W, and El
Cuadro meets Encina Basement.

Dekes slipped by Fiji, 7-0.
The Toro upset has been a goal of
many Row and Hall teams, but it
was achieved by a squad which was
not even considered to be under
consideration as a possibility.
CONVINCING VICTORY
No rationalization can alter the
fact that Firehouse was convincingly
beaten. Their blocking and running
were still in evidence, but the Toro
line tightened up and the Toro back
field backed 'em up, and it was no
go.
During the regular period, both
teams kept each other in the mid
portions of the field. End sweeps by
Toro speedster Carlos Brown almost
materialized twice, but the defense
of men like Tom Kruger always
turned up just in time for the blaze
chasers.
Late in the fourth period two flips
by Toro's Doug Marshall and George
Tolman brought the blaze chasers
back on their heels, but a fumble
ended the threat.
PLAYOFF SUMMARY
Here's what happened in the play
off: (The ball was placed on the 50
and both teams were given five al
ternate plays—the yardage advan
tage wins.)
Firehouse was put behind imme
diately when quarterback Jerry
Roinsted was nabbed by slashing
Louis Sloss on his own 41.
George Tolman got nowhere on a
wide right-end sweep for Toro.
Roinsted faked a pass and flashed
through center to the 49, lacking a
yard of being on the healthy side of
the middle.
PASS DISALLOWED
A Tolman pass which bounced out
of Sloss' arms to Tom Morton was
disallowed. A long pass by Roinsted
was knocked down by Bob Sontag
in the Toro backfield.
Another Toro pass was knocked
down, and a Firehouse drive bogged
at the line. Then Doug Marshall un
leashed a 40-yard pass to Carlos
Brown and it was all over for Fire
house.
The Dekes and Fijis agreed that
should their game end in a tie, the
game would be extended 10 minutes.
It was fatal for the latter. After
holding the famed Joslyn-Hooper
passes and the supposedly rested
from - the - weekend De k e line
throughout the regular period, the
Fijis finally gave up in the second
overtime period.
HARMS IS FIJI STAR
Bill Harms was the whole Fiji
team, submarining into the best of
the Deke efforts. But a pass from
Bill Joslyn to Chuck Hooper in the
second overtime connected over the
"shot" Fiji secondary.
Harry Wolter. mural director, an
nounced last night that all playoffs
for the rest of the series will be J}y
the official 50-yard-line method. No
more mutual agreement changes.
Today Zete meets 2W, and El
Cuadro meets Encina Basement.
The Firehouse finally lost its hold
on the Farm intramural football title
yesterday afternoon.
An aggressive El Toro squad end
ed a four-year reign in the grid
sport for the blaze chasers with an
aggressive and deserved 1-0 over
time victory, after holding the ex
