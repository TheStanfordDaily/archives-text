# Two Gridders May Not Start
## 
### 
Milt Vucinich and Don Zappet
tini, a couple of football first string
ers who helped Stanford regain the
Axe Saturday, may be missing from
the lineup when the Redskin eleven
takes on St. Mary's Pre-flight
school next week. Both were in
jured in the Big Game to the ex
tent that team physician Fritz Roth
doesn't know yet if the pair can
make it.
Vic Lindskog and Fritz Wilcox
took five freshmen in tow yester
day and ran them through plays for
Stanford's final game of the season.
FROSH QUINTET
The quintet of Papeese who will
probably be seen in action are Jack
Brownson, Lloyd Merriman, Steve
Tish, Mark Heffelfinger, and Jay
McKie, all backs.
With Zappettini on the doubtful
list, Merriman may do quite a bit
of running at left half. Since all of
the five will graduate to the var
sity next spring practice, the Stan
ford coaching staff will want to see
just what they can do against a top
flight football team.
Right now next Saturday's ball
game looms as a little Rose Bowl
in itself.
SCOUT COMMENTS
A former Chicago Bear scout,
who's now in the Army, said Sat
urday the Reds were the best team
he'd seen all year. And the Pre-
Flighters just knocked off Santa
Clara Sunday to remain unbeaten,
although tied by Washington in a
Seattle cloudburst.
Hoot Armstrong, ineligible half
back, will move into a right half
spot for the game. Jim Ellis and
Bill Joslyn, Athertonized gridders
who were expected to play, are
both giving intramural football
their time and will not be on the
roster.
