# Today Is Last Workshop Day
## War Board Wants More Blood Donors 
### 
"Judging from the number of
people who turned out at the War
Workshop last Thursday instead of
decorating their floats, the Big
Game parade would have been very
poor," commented Beanie Naffziger,
chairman of the Workshop Board.
Today is the very last opportunity
this quarter for women to help cut
down the remainder of work on
scrapbooks and U.S.O. kits that
must be done before the Workshop
closes its doors tonight.
REALIZE IMPORTANCE
"Women's living units have got
to realize how important this war
work is and individuals have got
to want to do their part," said Miss
Naffziger in urging every living
group to take part of the responsi
bility in clearing up the work left
on the Workshop tables.
Workshop volunteers have made
142 war stamp corsagcs that will
be sold for a dollar and for 55 cents
ot\ the Quad today honoring Wom
en'& War Stamp and Bond Week.
BLOOD BANK DONORS
According to a letter received
from San Francisco by Dean Yost
there is a definite need for more
volunteers at all blood banks. Ro
samund Fuller, head of the campus
Blood Bank, urges every student to
realize this need, and especially
asks that over the vacation students
under 21 years of age take home the
slips that their parents must sign
before they can volunteer.
Slips may be gotten at the Red
Cross room in the Old Union or by
calling Miss Fuller, 8747.
