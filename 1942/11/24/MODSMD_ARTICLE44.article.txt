### BOB SONTAG 
rilE KISS-OFF:
As it does to all tilings, death comes to this colyoom with tomorrow's i
issue of The Daily. One day in advance of the death notice we make the
bi-annual bouquet throwing carnival to the members of the sports staff,
who have faithfully helped record Stanford's athletic doings.
So to "the boys" go thanx:
Zip Walt, The Daily's new sports editor. Zip handled frosh football this
| fall and did a fine job. The Zipper knows plenty about sports, much more
j than we could ever muster, even in an "on" moment. He can even tell you
! correctly who invented the Rockne shift. A guy by the name of Jess Harper
| had something to do with, Zip sez. Zip knows sports characters like Parkey
! Sharkey, the former prizefighter who attended Stanford for a while and
I won fame in the ring. Zip knows anything. Ask him.
Bill Hornby, now a night editor and top member of the staff, has been i
j great. Bill's going to handle basketball next January when Everett Dean's
boys defend their championship. For a sophomore, Hornby is way ahead
of normalcy, and he'll put color and dash into that Winter Quarter sport 1
| page. Thanks to you. Bill, for everything.
| Boh Fisher, our soccer man, who played frosh soccer and in his spare
| time handled the writeups for The Daily, gets praise for a nice, steady
! piece of work. The squad hasn't done too well this season, but Fisher has
| helped keep 'em where they are.
Ed Luce, a freshman, did that snappy man-in-the-street yarn that ap
| peared in the Big Game edition Friday. It was a pip, and a couple of
orchids to him for it. and for everything else he did this quarter, helping |
j Hornby cover murals.
Ferris Bootiic, our water polo expert, went the way of greater things on
the news side by getting an associate editor appointment after staying with
: the sports side for two years and giving all the aquatic stuff good coverage. J
Charlie Allen, our grid man pro tem, was a great filler-inner when we
begged off. Charlie's the best newspaperman to come around The Daily
Shack in years. Be it football, murder, or wedding announcements, Charlie
| is tops.
Leight "Late" Williams, The Daily's bowling pooh-bah, has put Card |
keglers back on the sports page with some perfect strike stories. You'll
hear more from him.
Ilenry Coultrap did a little of everything for this volume. He'll probably
be bringing you news of Stanford's tennis squad next spring.
Bill Steif, strictly a newsman, deserted the front page and Bull Session
i one day for us. turning out a grand story on "Stub" Allison for the Big
Game edition. Thanks for that swell story, Mister.
There {hey are, and if we've left anyone out, congratulations to them too.
All these boys write for The Daily strictly on their own time and
receive nothing at all for their work save a little notoriety and a little
thrill at seeing their stuff in type.
This sounds awful, full of lush sentiment, and nobody will read it, prob
j ably, except those concerned. But the boys deserve it, so that's it, the kiss
i off to the staff.

So to "the boys" go thanx:
Zip Walt, The Daily's new sports editor. Zip handled frosh football this
| fall and did a fine job. The Zipper knows plenty about sports, much more
j than we could ever muster, even in an "on" moment. He can even tell you
! correctly who invented the Rockne shift. A guy by the name of Jess Harper
| had something to do with, Zip sez. Zip knows sports characters like Parkey
! Sharkey, the former prizefighter who attended Stanford for a while and
I won fame in the ring. Zip knows anything. Ask him.
Bill Hornby, now a night editor and top member of the staff, has been i
j great. Bill's going to handle basketball next January when Everett Dean's
boys defend their championship. For a sophomore, Hornby is way ahead
of normalcy, and he'll put color and dash into that Winter Quarter sport 1
| page. Thanks to you. Bill, for everything.
| Boh Fisher, our soccer man, who played frosh soccer and in his spare
| time handled the writeups for The Daily, gets praise for a nice, steady
! piece of work. The squad hasn't done too well this season, but Fisher has
| helped keep 'em where they are.
Ed Luce, a freshman, did that snappy man-in-the-street yarn that ap
| peared in the Big Game edition Friday. It was a pip, and a couple of
orchids to him for it. and for everything else he did this quarter, helping |
j Hornby cover murals.
Ferris Bootiic, our water polo expert, went the way of greater things on
the news side by getting an associate editor appointment after staying with
: the sports side for two years and giving all the aquatic stuff good coverage. J
Charlie Allen, our grid man pro tem, was a great filler-inner when we
begged off. Charlie's the best newspaperman to come around The Daily
Shack in years. Be it football, murder, or wedding announcements, Charlie
| is tops.
Leight "Late" Williams, The Daily's bowling pooh-bah, has put Card |
keglers back on the sports page with some perfect strike stories. You'll
hear more from him.
Ilenry Coultrap did a little of everything for this volume. He'll probably
be bringing you news of Stanford's tennis squad next spring.
Bill Steif, strictly a newsman, deserted the front page and Bull Session
i one day for us. turning out a grand story on "Stub" Allison for the Big
Game edition. Thanks for that swell story, Mister.
There {hey are, and if we've left anyone out, congratulations to them too.
All these boys write for The Daily strictly on their own time and
receive nothing at all for their work save a little notoriety and a little
thrill at seeing their stuff in type.
This sounds awful, full of lush sentiment, and nobody will read it, prob
j ably, except those concerned. But the boys deserve it, so that's it, the kiss
i off to the staff.
rilE KISS-OFF:
As it does to all tilings, death comes to this colyoom with tomorrow's i
issue of The Daily. One day in advance of the death notice we make the
bi-annual bouquet throwing carnival to the members of the sports staff,
who have faithfully helped record Stanford's athletic doings.
