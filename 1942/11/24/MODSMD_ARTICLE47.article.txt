### 
LOS ANGELES, Nov. 23 (UP).—
1 Coach Jeff Cravath of the Univer
sity of Southern California returned
j today from a scouting trip and told
his Trojans they haven't met any
thing nearly as potent as Notre
Dame all season, Ohio State in
cluded. Although he saw Bertelli
complete four passes in seven tries,
two ior touchdowns, against North
western, Cravath said he was more
impressed by Irish fullback Corwin
Clatt, whose line-smashing drives
into the Wildcat forward wall kept
up all afternoon. The coach went
into a huddle with his backfield and
scheduled scrimmage for tomorrow.

One reason we need lead: The
guns of a pursuit plane vomit bul
lets at the rate of 300 pounds per
minute.
