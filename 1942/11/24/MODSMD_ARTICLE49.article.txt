# News and Our Future
## 
### 
GOOD NEWS is conducive lo better educa
tion. Last week the headlines screamed
the Allied victory in Africa. Our faces lit and
we forgot about Terry and the Pirates and quit
wondering about what had happened to the
Errol Flynn case. We wanted more good medi
cine; it made us feel better.
Several months ago many of us would have
had trouble locating Tunisia on the proper con
tinent, but now most of us know the location
of all of the important strategic battle centers.
We are becoming an informed generation hav
ing knowledge.
We can talk about the industries, the climate,
the population, and the strengths and weak
nesses of our enemies and allies. We realize
that a mere knowledge of the weather outside
and the name of the best book seller of the
week will not carry much weight in an intelli
gent conversation today. We hate to be labeled
as ignorant.
However, we are bound to be faced with dis
heartening news before long. The good is al
ways followed by the bad. If we allow our
minds to become stagnant again with the first
sign of bad luck, we will return to the shadows
of ignorance. An intelligent race will always
come out on top. Intelligence will bring us vic
tory; intelligence will bring us hope and new
life.
When a person is involved in a newspaper
story or a magazine article, he doesn't want to
miss it. Such is the case in the matter of war
news.
No one can force us to read about what is hap
pening around us, but we should be interested
in our fate; it's being unfolded for us in good,
clear English in every newspaper in the world.
Don't forget! Tomorrow is the last day oi
publication for The Daily for the guarter. In
formation from departments and organizations
should be turned in to The Daily office be
fore dinner tomorrow to assure publication.
