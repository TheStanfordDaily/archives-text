# BULL SESSION

### BILL STEIF 
In confusion I think that I am beginning to
find reason. The confusion is emotional. The
confusion is that caused by being a civilian
in wartime.
For I think that the civilian in wartime is one
of God's most bewildered creatures. If the ci
vilian were in the army or the navy or the ma
rines it would be different, it would be much
simpler. This is because a soldier or a sailor

or a marine, I think, is dedicated. He is dedi
cated to the single purpose of helping to win
the war and no matter how much he may re
sist the idea of fighting, no matter how much
he may hate the martial life, he goes on and
does fight. If the service man cannot adapt
himself to army or navy or marine life then he
just has a mental breakdown and, though this
has happened, the cases of it, thank God, are
comparatively rare.
The fact, however, that men in the services
are dedicated to a single purpose, can, in large
part, forget themselves and all the rest of their
past lives, is important. It is important because
precisely the opposite is true of the civilian.
On the one hand the civilian feels the all
pervading influence of the war. It touches him
a little because gasoline and tires and butter and
maybe meat are being or will be rationed. It
touches him pretty deeply because he has a
brother or a husband or a cousin in the service.
It touches him because he is asked to give and
give and give for war bonds or war stamps. It
touches him because he works in a shipyard or
a steel mill. It touches him, perhaps most of all,
because he feels deeply that he would like to
be in there fighting with the rest of the boys.
And yet he is told to stick where he is. He
is told to concentrate on what he is doing and
to try to forget about the war. And at the same
time he is not affected by the war deeply
enough to want to change his way of living. He
still likes to take drives into the country. He
still likes his bacon and eggs in the morning.
He doesn't think that the war is very personally
related to him—it is all sort of an abstraction, a
feeling, but hardly a reality.

Stanford is this way I think. I regret to say it,
but I know I am that way. For Stanford and
for myself this is particularly understandable.
Those of us on the Farm right now (including
some of the women, even) will soon be going
into the army or the navy or the marines. So
let's have our fun while we can. That's the atti
tude of a lot of us, at least. Now a month ago
I think I would have deprecated this attitude
entirely. I would have said that there are no
excuses for it. Well, I think that I am beginning
to see excuses for it. That still doesn't justify
the attitude, just makes it a bit more under
standable.
I can see also that this is an attitude of help
lessness, that is, in the sense that here we are
(excluding the women for the moment) healthy
young men who are, with the possible excep
tion of the engineers and doctors, doing vir
tually nothing to help win the war.
We may be taking a math course or two that
will help us when we get to one of the V-7
training schools or we may be picking up a
little navigation or we may even be taking some
R.O.T.C. courses, but still these are very little
compared to that actual training that we could
get and will get when we do get into one of
the services. And so we feel rather helpless
and at the same time a little ashamed of the
fact that we are having the good times that we
do have.
★ * * *
And there's another facet to this complex
mess. We feel sort of ashamed of the good
times we are having and yet we don't exactly
want to leave school. School is so nice and
sheltered and we do have a lot of fun here and
it is always hard to give up sure good times for
something that is sure to be strange and entire
ly different from anything we have ever known.
There is a battle, I think, in every one of Stan
ford's civilian souls. One side says "Let's get
into it" and the other side says "Let's not let this
fun out of our grasp so quickly—we are a little
afraid."
And another thing. One must think just a
little of the post-war world. We must stay in
school to get as much training as possible for
that. And then there is also the question of the
parents. They will not be exactly happy to see
us in the services.
Yes, it is very confusing.

I have received several letters from a young
man who by some chance got hold of a Bull
Session I happened \b write. Yesterday I re
ceived another letter from him, part of which
I believe is worth reprinting. George is in ad
vanced flight training at Turner Field, Albany,
Ga. Here is what he says:
"I wish you'd tell the Stanford men, women,
and children (take your pick) something for
me.
"Tell them to enoy this vacation for me. Tell
them to enjoy it for all of us who don't, in fact
—that takes a lot of enjoyment. Tell them to
enjoy it for themselves, too, for some day they
may be shaken out of their dream to find that
Time is the dearest thing on earth. Some day
it will become apparent to them that a 24-hour
respite means more than 24 days dawdled away
—as most of them will do, I dare say. You might
also tell them that there is a war going on and
they'd better look out because they might get
caught in it. That would ruin their vacations."
That is what George, whom I have never met,
has to say. Time, War, Enjoyment—they're all
mingled in those sentences. Maybe George has
a greater perception of what proportion those
three elements should be in than most of us to
day. I feel sure that he has greater perception
than I.
And that's the kiss-off.
