# Irwin Writes Of Stanford In New Book
## 
### 
THE MAKING OF A REPORTER,
by Will Irwin. G. P. Putnam's, New
York, $3.75.
A book about Stanford by a Stan
ford man should hit the spot on this
campus. Will Irwin's recently re
leased autobiography starts on the
front steps of Encina and continues
through the '30's. Tritely but truly,
Will Irwin's writing may be called
sparkling. It carried him through
many campus productions, through
the editorship of The Daily Palo
Alto, through jobs on many news
papers and magazines. In other
words this is a book about a writer
by a writer.
The stories about Stanford life in
the '90's will undoubtedly do much
to turn men's thoughts away from
the war (this is not intentional, just
a passing observation) and make
them turn back to the good old days.
Irwin has many interesting com
ments to make on prominent mem
bers of the Stanford Family who are
still with us. You may have heard
of Ray Lyman Wilbur or Herbert
Hoover (who used to come down
from San Francisco on weekends to
see his bride-to-be).
You may wonder how many of the
famous Stanford traditions started.
You will find the most prominent
authority on traditions of the Farm
in this book, for Will Irwin started
most of them.
This book would serve as a guide
to young newspapermen because be
sides the wild stories, it dishes out
good advice in B. Franklin style.
Bill Irwin did himself proud.—
Horrall.
