# Novel Sound Effects Secured For 'Wookey'
## 
### 
Records from the original recordings made in London during a German
blitz have been obtained to create realistic sound effects for "The Wookey,"
dramatic comedy of an English family under Stuka bombardment, to be
presented by the Stanford Players Dec. 3, 4, and 5.
The drama department has purchased these records to obtain the authn-
sound of English air raid sirens,

pom-poms of anti-aircraft fire,
whistling shells, screaming Stuka
dive bombers, and bomb explosions.
SOUND DEVICES
However, these records alone did
not satisfy David Sievers, director,
who was afraid they mght sound
I tiny and scratchy, so he and Skip
Athey worked out a series of in
genuous sound devices, using a
beauty shop scalp vibrator and an
old screen door, which they believe
will make the audience think the
dive bombers are right overhead.
Sievers commented that after the
performances, those intrested may
I go back stage and look at the con
traptions.
Taking part in his father's play,
"The Wookey," is Frederick Hazlitt
Brennan Jr., who served as a model
for one of the characters in the dra
matic comedy.
AUTHOR'S SON
Brennan, a freshman here, takes
a small role of a factory worker in
the production, but the antics of
Ernie Wookey, a 'teen-age character,
were written from the antics of
Brennan as a boy.
Rehearsals for the show are roll
ing along with rad bad effects on
Bob Ashley, who gets spanked four
or five times a night at rehearsal to
the cue of F. C. Strickland's "Bend
over, son." N
It has been said that "Strick" loves
| to rehearse this scene completely.
FOUR SETS USED
Although the play was written in
three acts utilizing three sets, four
sets must be constructed, since the
Wookey backyard is shown before
and after a bombing.
"The Wookey living room, from a
properties point of view, is almost as
crazy as the set for 'You Can't Take
It With You'," Sievers remarked,
"for Mr. Wookey is always bringing
home 'ousehold improvements rang
ing from a grave-stone monument to
; a large withered wreath dedicated to
'Our Noble King George Vl', atid
finally, a real china bathtub from
France."
Other scene is the basement air
raid shelter of the Wookey residence
! where Aunt Jen, former strip-teaser,
hands out soup to the Thames River
) dock workers.
REAL BOMB USED
Incidentally, the incendiary bomb
which falls into the Wookey living
room will be the real thing, with a
little magnesium powder removed,
I donated by the Civilian Defense
j training school.
Sievers said the procedure fol-
I lowed by the family in extinguishing
1 the bomb as it burns on the stage
| will be exactly what not to do.
Another important sound effect
i the directorial staff is taking great
; pains to make realistc is the sound
[ of a toilet flushing.
