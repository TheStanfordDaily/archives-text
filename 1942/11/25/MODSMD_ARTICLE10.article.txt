# History Teachers To Convene Here
## 
### 
More than 40 teachers of Ameri
can history will meet on the Stanford
campus Friday and Saturday to dis
cuss the question, "Should Ameri
can history be required in the jun
ior colleges of California, and if so,
what should be the content of the
course?"
This is the second in a series of
history conferences for the purpose
of discussing the approach to the
teaching of American history in
California. The first conference met
last August and recommended that
h general survey course in American
history be required for graduation
from every four-year institution of
higher learning.
Dr. Robinson will present the
problem to the visitors at the open
ing meeting of the conference at
dinner Friday night. The Saturday
morning session will take up the
topic of how American history is
now taught in the junior colleges.
At the afternoon meeting, the ad
vantages of the various types of
courses will be reviewed, and at the
evening dinner meeting a summary
of the finding of the conference will
be made.
