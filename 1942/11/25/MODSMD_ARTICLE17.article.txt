of getting home for Christmas, since
the December 17 and 18 Daylights
arc 75 per cent sold out to students.

ing Southern Pacific trains: the
Coast Daylight, the San Joaquin
Daylight, the City of San Francisco
and the Beaver (only from Port
land south). The Daylights will be
reserved exclusively for armed
service personnel.

ing accepted and the company an

tions. Students, by this, will bo
able to travel on the Lark to South
ern California.

dents may take their chance by
buying a chair ticket and hop
