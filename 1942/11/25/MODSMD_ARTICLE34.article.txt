# Director Strickland to Take Leading Role in 'The Wookey'
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
Playing the lead in "The Wookey" is F. C. Strickland, who came to
Stanford in 15)40 as director of dramatics after a brilliant career in drama
fields over the United States.
"The Wookey," last production of the Stanford Players for the quar
! ter, will open for a three-night run on Dec. 15 in Memorial Auditorium.

Tickets are on sale in the office of
! the theater.
In his two years at Stanford,
"Strick" has become one of the
more authentic "props" around the
theater, and more than that, he has j
j proved a tremendously likeable and
profitable person to work with—
witness the many successes he has
drawn from Stanford Players.
His part in the new production,
which furthers the long-standing
tradition of students and faculty j
working together on Stanford
; shows, is that of Mr. Wookey, an
| intensely entertaining English
: codger, gruff and unconquerable,
yet kind-hearted and sincere.
SJEVERS DIRECTS
Directing the show is David Sic
vers, who is one of Strickland's re- I
cent proteges and students discov-
I ered while working with the St.
j Louis Little Theater and is now
i directing his teacher.
"David's giving me a much need
ed lesson in directing. Since it's
I been so long since I've been in an
[ actor's seat, I'm rediscovering how
necessary it is for a director to give
! an actor pointers at the right time,"
commented Strick.
DIRECTS RAINS
Asked what big names he has
directed, Strick rolled off a list, in
cluding such persons as Ina Claire,
Ethel Barrymore, Earnest Truex,
Claude Rains, and Walt Connolly.
"If they were acting in the theater
10 years ago, I betcha I directed
1 them," he grinned.
His last role before the part in
I "The Wookey" was as the father
1[ in "George and Margaret." After
| directing "The Mikado," he took a
role in the show simply to be near
' I his future wife.
"I've really done very little act
-1 ing and have absolutely maintained
Ii my amateur standing," he re-
I marked.
