# Director Strickland to Take Leading Role in 'The Wookey'
## 
### JANE GLASSON 
Playing the lead in "The Wookey" is F. C. Strickland, who came to
Stanford in 15)40 as director of dramatics after a brilliant career in drama
fields over the United States.
"The Wookey," last production of the Stanford Players for the quar
! ter, will open for a three-night run on Dec. 15 in Memorial Auditorium.

Tickets are on sale in the office of
the theater.
In his two years at Stanford,
"Strick" has become one of the
more authentic "props" around the
theater, and more than that, he has
proved a tremendously likeable and
profitable person to work withâ€”
witness the many successes he has
drawn from Stanford Players.
His part in the new production,
which furthers the long-standing
tradition of students and faculty
working together on Stanford
shows, is that of Mr. Wookey, an
intensely entertaining English
codger, gruff and unconquerable,
yet kind-hearted and sincere.
SIEVERS DIRECTS
Directing the show is David Sic
vers, who is one of Strickland's re-
cent proteges and students discov-
ered while working with the St.
Louis Little Theater and is now
directing his teacher.
"David's giving me a much need
ed lesson in directing. Since it's
been so long since I've been in an
actor's seat, I'm rediscovering how
necessary it is for a director to give
an actor pointers at the right time,"
commented Strick.
DIRECTS RAINS
Asked what big names he has
directed, Strick rolled off a list, in
cluding such persons as Ina Claire,
Ethel Barrymore, Earnest Truex,
Claude Rains, and Walt Connolly.
"If they were acting in the theater
10 years ago, I betcha I directed
them," he grinned.
His last role before the part in
"The Wookey" was as the father
in "George and Margaret." After
directing "The Mikado," he took a
role in the show simply to be near
his future wife.
"I've really done very little act
ing and have absolutely maintained
my amateur standing," he re-
marked.
