# Renewed Jap Guadalcanal Activity Seen
## Nipponese Believed Preparing Artillery Attack on Air Field 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 24 (U.R)—
Japanese activities in a new sector
of Guadalcanal, possibly presaging
an artillery attack on vital Hender
son Airfield, were reported by the
navy today as Secretary Frank Knox
told a press conference that he be
lieves it unlikely the enemy will be
able to get additional reinforcements
on the island.
Details of the new Jap activity, in
a mountainous region overlooking
the airfield from the southwest, were
lacking but it was likely the enemy
was drawing up field artillery pre
paratory to shelling the airdrome.
Further advances by American
troops on the west of the airfield
were reported in today's navy com
munique.
AI It FORCE PATROLS
Knox said American naval and air
ldrces are maintaining such a tight,
round-the-clock patrol of the island
that it is "improbable" the Japs will
be able to put additional troops
ashore, even at night.
The area of new Jap activity—in
the Mambulo and upper Matanikau
River region—is some three miles
inlaid and has an elevation of about
1,500 feet. It would make an ideal
gun emplacement.
The Japs apparently planned to
attempt with their field guns what
their bombers have been unable to
do—knock out the airport which is
the key to American defenses in the
southern Solomons.
U.S. PLANES POUND JAPS
Meanwhile, American planes based
at the field pounded away at Jap
positions on the island. Attacks were
carried out late Sunday night and
early Monday.
On the western front, where sol
diers and Marines extended their
positions more than five miles since
launching an offensive Nov. 1, they
continued what the communique de
scribed as "limited advances." This
suggested the Japs were putting up
stern resistance. The enemy is be
lieved concentrated, for the most
part, in that area.

Knox offered a brighter picture of
the situation, indicating the Japs
now are virtually cut off from rein
forcements and supplies as a result
of the smashing American naval
victory a fortnight ago and constant
patrol of the area.
