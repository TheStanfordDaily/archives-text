# Drama Department Adds Two Plays to Schedule
## 
### 
Changing the tentative schedule
of plays for Winter Quarter, Hu
bert HefTner, head of the drama de
partment, has announced that "In
Time to Come" and "The Gondo
liers" will be played for the winter
season.
Opening Feb. 3, "In Time to
Come," a show about Woodrow
Wilson, replaces "Letters to Lu
cerne." Dr. Heffner explained the
department was planning to do the
play as an experiment in epic the
ater with projection of documentary
film. David Sievers will direct the
show.
"In Time to Come" was written
by Howard Koch; production of
the play will depend on securing
an adequate cast, Dr. Heffner said,
since it requires the participation
of mature people.

Gilbert and Sullivan's "The Gon
doliers" replaces "Hay-foot, Straw
foot."

"We are substituting this musical
because we think the show will be
of more interest to our audience,
and educationally it offers more,
giving the music department a
chance for participation."

F. C. Strickland and Jan Popper
will direct the musical.

An extra feature to be presented
by the Stanford Players is the new
film "One Third of a Nation," one
of the leading newspaper shows
coming out of the Federal theater.
This presentation will be open

free of charge to season ticket hold
ers and to certain students in so
cial science classes. It will be shown
Jan. 22, and includes outstanding
Holywood stars and contains a fine
musical score, according to Dr.
Heffner.
