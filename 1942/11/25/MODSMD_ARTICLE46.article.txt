# War Board Unites Demands For Contributions to Defense
## 
### 
Dimes drive, stamp sales, crop
crews, workshop work, and the
hlood bank have confronted the
campus with a confusion of war de
mands this quarter, but the Stanford
War Board has done a good job of
crystallization and delegation.

The efficiency of the SWB's or
ganization, under Rosemary Cross,
that has placed Stanford as one of
the leading contributing universities
to the war effort, is evidenced by
the following figures released by
the SWB:
1. Stanford has invested $9,792
in War Stamps and Bonds;
2. $1,383 has been collected in
the Dimes for Diplomas drive;
3. Sixty-eight students have
spent 502 hours in tomato can
neries;
4. 241 beet toppers have de
voted 1,084 hours in the fields;
5. In two drives, salvagers have
amassed 2,552 pounds of heavy
metals;
6. In 16 days, 250 Workroom vol
unteers have made 144 dressings
for campus casualty stations, as
well as stretchers, stamp corsages,
and wool dresses;
7. Women tomato and walnut
harvesters, numbering 392, have
picked 1,104 boxes of walnuts,
3,108 lugs of tomatoes. (Seventy
six girls saved 20 per cent of a
walnut crop at a local ranch.)
8. Forty-seven stamp booth
salespeople have spent 376 hours
selling stamps.
9. Ninety-four students have
spent 376 hours in aiding the USO
program by entertaining soldiers.
This is Stanford's war contribu
tion for the quarter, and it gives a
picture of the scope of the SWB's ac

tivities, since it was revitalized by
Rosemary Cross last October.

"But this is only one side of the
picture," emphasized Rosemary
Cross. "We haven't functioned with
out a blemish. There were students
who didn't show up at the work
room, and beet fields; and let crops
rot that could have been saved by a
few score of volunteers."
There is much room for improve
ment, and the SWB intends to per
fect the campus war effort to full
effectiveness next quarter.
"There has been a lot of experi
mental organization and groping in
the dark this quarter," Miss Cross
continued, "and I believe we can
learn a lot from this autumn's mis
takes."

Rosemary Cross last October.

"But this is only one side of the
picture," emphasized Rosemary
Cross. "We haven't functioned with
out a blemish. There were students
who didn't show up at the work
room, and beet fields; and let crops
rot that could have been saved by a
few score of volunteers."
There is much room for improve
ment, and the SWB intends to per
fect the campus war effort to full
effectiveness next quarter.
"There has been a lot of experi
mental organization and groping in
the dark this quarter," Miss Cross
continued, "and I believe we can
learn a lot from this autumn's mis
takes."
Dimes drive, stamp sales, crop
crews, workshop work, and the
hlood bank have confronted the
campus with a confusion of war de
mands this quarter, but the Stanford
War Board has done a good job of
crystallization and delegation.

The efficiency of the SWB's or
ganization, under Rosemary Cross,
that has placed Stanford as one of
the leading contributing universities
to the war effort, is evidenced by
the following figures released by
the SWB:
1. Stanford has invested $9,792
in War Stamps and Bonds;
2. $1,383 has been collected in
the Dimes for Diplomas drive;
3. Sixty-eight students have
spent 502 hours in tomato can
neries;
4. 241 beet toppers have de
voted 1,084 hours in the fields;
5. In two drives, salvagers have
amassed 2,552 pounds of heavy
metals;
6. In 16 days, 250 Workroom vol
unteers have made 144 dressings
for campus casualty stations, as
well as stretchers, stamp corsages,
and wool dresses;
7. Women tomato and walnut
harvesters, numbering 392, have
picked 1,104 boxes of walnuts,
3,108 lugs of tomatoes. (Seventy
six girls saved 20 per cent of a
walnut crop at a local ranch.)
8. Forty-seven stamp booth
salespeople have spent 376 hours
selling stamps.
9. Ninety-four students have
spent 376 hours in aiding the USO
program by entertaining soldiers.
This is Stanford's war contribu
tion for the quarter, and it gives a
