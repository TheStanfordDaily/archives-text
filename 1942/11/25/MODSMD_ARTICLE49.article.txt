# Gridders Point for Pre-Flight Tilt With 'Win This One for Marchie'
## Low Spirit of Team After Big Game May Result in Defeat 
### 
Stanford discovered a new vow boy team yesterday.
Though most of the Indian footballers were either absent, missing, or
sluggish at yesterday's practice, there was a definite undercurrent of "let's
win litis one for Marchie" as the squad pointed for Saturday's game with
St. Mary's Pro-Flight School. Although it may be the greatest anti-climax

The Pre-Flighters, seeking to get
a Rose Bowl bid, could get that bid,
if they get over Saturday. On the
other hand, if the Indians hurdle
! the Navy lads, they could very well
J ask for a Bowl bid themselves, al
though Washington State still holds
; the upper hand—if it can knock
j over Washington Saturday.
Yesterday's practice let - down
| was unapproachable by line coach
| Harry Shipkey, taking Schwartz'
| position.
"Our team will take the licking
t of its life if the after Big Game let
[ down doesn't let up pretty soon,"
jhe said as yesterday's workout
brought far from satisfactory re
j suits.
Though the game might draw up
| ward of 50,000 persons if it were
played in Kezar Stadium, Graduate
Manager Al Masters reported last
night that the game would defi
nitely remain at the Stanford Sta-
I dium. Kickoff time is 2 p.m.

in Coast rootball history, the tilt
all the earmarks of being a little i
Rose Bowl—if the Redskins could I
make themselves believe winning J
any game after the Big Game was
important.
Right now they don't feel that j
way, and the Pre-Flighters will j
crush them under foot if the l'eel- |
ing doesn't depart, before 2 p.m. I
next Saturday.
SCHWARTZ ON TRAIN
Schwartz is on the train, going to |
B.iy St. Louis, Miss., to attend fu- |
neral rights for his father, who died j
Monday of a heart attack. Since he j
will not arrive in Mississippi until
tomorrow, there is little chance j
that he will be able to return in
time for the Saturday game.
What makes this game good is the |
presence of two former Stanford J
AM-Americans, Frankie Albert and
Bobby Grayson, Coach Tex Oliver
of the Navy has Grayson and Vic
Bo I taii of California teamed up at
left half, with Albert slated to play I
right half in box right and box left |
offenses.
Oliver used the T formation only j
slightly last Saturday when the I
NAPS licked Santa Clara. In the T
Albeit goes to quarterback, the po
sition the little passing ace per
formed so well last year and in
1940 when Stanford wound up in
the Rose Bowl.
Two important cogs in the Big
Red Machine have slipped out of
gear. Their places will be taken by
Pete August at center and Ross
Dana at left half.
The Broncos' coach, Buck Shaw,
told the annual Northern California
Press Writers' luncheon tenders
that Stanford was "the best team
I've seen this year." ,
Buck, of course, was speaking of I
the Cards' performance against Cal- I
ifornia.
There is much doubt in mid-week
whether or not the terrific "high
ness" that the Indians took into
that Bear game will show again.
