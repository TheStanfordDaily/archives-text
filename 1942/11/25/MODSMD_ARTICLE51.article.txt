# Ensign Frankie Albert Swears Gridders Into Naval Reserve
## 
### BILL HORNBY 
Most of the bulwarks on Stanford's 1042 football rosier ami 25 other Farm
men were sworn into the reserve forces of the United States Navy yester
day afternoon by Ensign Frankie Albert of the Pre-Flight Training Station
at Moraga.
Stanford's two-time Ail-American football quarterback was calling the

signals again for fellows like Ed"
Stamm, Milt Vucinich, Chuck Tay
lor, Willard Sheller—bringing them
into the military services just as he
once brain-waved them into na
tional prominence as the "rags to
riches" Rose Bowl machine of 1940.
The changed situations of the
principal characters in yesterday's
scene was perhaps the most striking
example in recent weeks of the war's
effect on Stanford.
Saturday, when Albert will meet
T with T as quarterback of the Pre-
Flight football squad against the
Cards in Stanford Stadium, he will
face practically another all-service
team.
THREE INDIAN ENDS
At ends, Bob Hall, Dave Brown,
Rog Laverty are all in the Navy V-l
and V-7 programs. (V-l is for under
classmen and V-7 for upperclass
men.)
Tackles Bill Mannon and Ed
Stamm participated in the ceremony
yesterday, Stamm as a Naval Ord
nance enlistee and Mannon in V-7,
Jim Cox is a Marine Reserve.
All-American-to-be, Charles Ed
ward Taylor, hopes to be in a tor
pedo boat squadron by next year.
His enlistment yesterday in V-7
will bring his entrance into the
armed forces in March.
Other guards in the service include
Bill Young, Harvey Bcrnhard, and
Dave Kofahl—all Navy men after
yesterday—and advanced R.O.T.C.
cadet Dave Patterson.
VUCINICH IN V-7
Milt Vucinich is now V-7, and
backfield men taking the oath yes
terday included quarterback Bob
Andrews, halfbacks Bill Sheller, Don
Zappetini, and Poss Dana; fullback
Bob Frisbee. Mark Caffall, Buck
Fawcett. and Ben Morrison are ad
vanced R.0.T.C., and Ray Hammett
is in the Enlisted Reserve.
Many of the men had enlisted pre
viously this quarter, officials said,
but the ceremony yesterday com
pleted their routine of entrance.
Other gridders enlisting were Jack
Sogorka, Bob Saleeby, Sandy Banks,
Tvler Norton, and Harry Feri'is.
OFFICERS TRAINING
From Stanford they go to Notre
Dame, Northwestern, or Columbia
for officer's training. V-l cadets
may choose upon graduation between
V-7 schools or the aerial branch,
V-5.
Thus Stanford athletes who just a
week ago brought the Axe home,
who learned their T football in part
from Albert, who will be trying their
level best to knock him and his un

defeated teammates out of the Sta
| dium, Saturday, and who will be
with him in the Navy soon, brought
the school even closer to the war in
one sweep.
ASSISTS TAGGERT
Albert appeared at the ceremony
to assist Lt. Comdr. Harold Taggert,
head of the recruiting board on the
campus, and Lieut. Cliff Burnhill,
former president of the Stanford
Alumni Association.

ENSIGN FRANKIE ALBERT
Most of the bulwarks on Stanford's 1042 football rosier ami 25 other Farm
men were sworn into the reserve forces of the United States Navy yester
day afternoon by Ensign Frankie Albert of the Pre-Flight Training Station
at Moraga.
Stanford's two-time Ail-American football quarterback was calling the

signals again for fellows like Ed"
Stamm, Milt Vucinich, Chuck Tay
lor, Willard Sheller—bringing them
into the military services just as he
once brain-waved them into na
tional prominence as the "rags to
riches" Rose Bowl machine of 1940.
The changed situations of the
principal characters in yesterday's
scene was perhaps the most striking
example in recent weeks of the war's
effect on Stanford.
Saturday, when Albert will meet
T with T as quarterback of the Pre-
Flight football squad against the
Cards in Stanford Stadium, he will
face practically another all-service
team.

Rog Laverty are all in the Navy V-l

ENSIGN FRANKIE ALBERT
Most of the bulwarks on Stanford's 1042 football rosier ami 25 other Farm
men were sworn into the reserve forces of the United States Navy yester
day afternoon by Ensign Frankie Albert of the Pre-Flight Training Station
at Moraga.
Stanford's two-time Ail-American football quarterback was calling the

signals again for fellows like Ed"
Stamm, Milt Vucinich, Chuck Tay
lor, Willard Sheller—bringing them
into the military services just as he
once brain-waved them into na
tional prominence as the "rags to
riches" Rose Bowl machine of 1940.
The changed situations of the
principal characters in yesterday's
scene was perhaps the most striking
example in recent weeks of the war's
effect on Stanford.
Saturday, when Albert will meet
T with T as quarterback of the Pre-
Flight football squad against the
Cards in Stanford Stadium, he will
face practically another all-service
team.
THREE INDIAN ENDS
At ends, Bob Hall, Dave Brown,
Rog Laverty are all in the Navy V-l
and V-7 programs. (V-l is for under
classmen and V-7 for upperclass
men.)
Tackles Bill Mannon and Ed
Stamm participated in the ceremony
yesterday, Stamm as a Naval Ord
nance enlistee and Mannon in V-7,
Jim Cox is a Marine Reserve.
All-American-to-be, Charles Ed
ward Taylor, hopes to be in a tor
pedo boat squadron by next year.
His enlistment yesterday in V-7
will bring his entrance into the
armed forces in March.
Other guards in the service include
Bill Young, Harvey Bcrnhard, and
Dave Kofahl—all Navy men after
yesterday—and advanced R.O.T.C.
cadet Dave Patterson.
VUCINICH IN V-7
Milt Vucinich is now V-7, and
backfield men taking the oath yes
terday included quarterback Bob
Andrews, halfbacks Bill Sheller, Don
Zappetini, and Poss Dana; fullback
Bob Frisbee. Mark Caffall, Buck
Fawcett. and Ben Morrison are ad
vanced R.0.T.C., and Ray Hammett
is in the Enlisted Reserve.
Many of the men had enlisted pre
viously this quarter, officials said,
but the ceremony yesterday com
pleted their routine of entrance.
Other gridders enlisting were Jack
Sogorka, Bob Saleeby, Sandy Banks,
Tvler Norton, and Harry Feri'is.
OFFICERS TRAINING
From Stanford they go to Notre
Dame, Northwestern, or Columbia
for officer's training. V-l cadets
may choose upon graduation between
V-7 schools or the aerial branch,
V-5.
Thus Stanford athletes who just a
week ago brought the Axe home,
who learned their T football in part
from Albert, who will be trying their
level best to knock him and his un

defeated teammates out of the Sta
| dium, Saturday, and who will be
with him in the Navy soon, brought
the school even closer to the war in
one sweep.
ASSISTS TAGGERT
Albert appeared at the ceremony
to assist Lt. Comdr. Harold Taggert,
head of the recruiting board on the
campus, and Lieut. Cliff Burnhill,
former president of the Stanford
Alumni Association.
