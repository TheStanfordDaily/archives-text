# El Cuadro, Zetes Win In Playoffs
## 
### ED LUCE 
Encina was literally bombed out
of the intramural grid playoffs yes
terday afternoon as the Cuadros and
Zetes passed their way to 25-0 and
24-0 wins over 2W and Basement
respectively.
Figured as a leading dark horse
contender, 2W was unable to muster
a pass defense that could stop Bob
Fair and mates, while the Cuadros
in turn easily throttled 2W's aerial
thrusts.
El Cuadro scored first on one of
the three running plays they tried in
the game, Fair going over after
passes had carried his team to the 3-
yard line.
FERGUSON TALLIES
Tex Ferguson made a great catch
of a Fair pass to tally the next coun
ter, three plays after the second half
opened. Still using the "everybody
out" system to advantage, Fair
passed to tricky Bob Hughey a few
minutes later, Hughey cutting dia
gonally across the field to score
from 20 yards out.
Fair then looped the pigskin to
Bill Barbieri for the conversion, and
on a similar play a few seconds be
fore the gun threw again to Bar
bieri for the final touchdown.
Surpassing the Cuadro-2W clash
in ferocity if not in excitement was
the Zete-Basement mixup. Again il
was the inability to defend agains
passes that sent the Encina sevei
out of contention.

After Zete Frank McCann had
passed to Bill Symes on the Base
ment 2-yard line, the upperelass
men resorted to trickery, sending
Bob Ullman of physical fitness fame
over on the end of a fake reverse
and lateral. Slick Northern took an
aerial from Symes for the point after
touchdown. â€ž
McCANN" TO SYMES
Basement managed to stave off
further Zete threats till midway in
the. second half when McCann passed
to Symes on the Basement 30. With
Jack Reynolds, Ullman, and Symes
throwing key blocks, McCann then
went the route around his own right
end to make the score 13-0.
Ullman came back a couple of
plays later to snatch a Basement
aerial out of the air and ramble up
to the 20. Again McCann faded and
heaved to Symes hiding out on the
far sidelines. The lanky end went
all the way untouched.
Zete's final touchdown came in
the waning moments, when, for the
third time, the McCann-Symes com
bination clicked for a score.
