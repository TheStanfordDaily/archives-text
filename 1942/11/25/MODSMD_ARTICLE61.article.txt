# Hank Luisetti to Play For Pre-Flighter Team Against Cardinals Here
## 
### 
Hank l.tiisrUi is the greatest basketball player that Stanford has ever
produced, and he has been placed as the first hurdle in the path of Ever
ett Dean's 1!)42 Indian varsity toward a second national crown.
Luisctti will play forward for the St. Mary's Prc-flight quint which
opens the basketball season here next Wednesday night at N::5() in the

Pavilion. It will probably be the
last chance for Angelo to show his
form in the Pavilion which was his
All - American background, and
Stanford's squad will have the
toughest opener of many years to
face.
After this "breather," the Cards
travel to Berkeley, Dec. 21, to meet
the Pre-flighters again as Cal plays
Santa Clara in the other half of a
double-header. The next night the
Cards tackle the Broncs.
GREAT LAKES TEAM
Dean and a 12-man squad, plus
manager Jim Gault, will travel to
New Orleans during Christmas va
cation, meeting the Great Lakes
Naval Training Station team there
on Dec. 30 in a massive Navy Re
lief show in the Sugar Bowl.
II it's what he wanted, Stanford's
coach did a wonderful job of se
lecting tough early season games
for its squad. At forward for Great
Lakes will be Fordy Anderson,
Dean's smooth Stanford forward of
two years ago.
DAVIS TO PLAY
His companion at the other for
ward spot will be Seton Hall's ex
player, Bob Davis, second - string
AU-Amei'ican last year.
Victories in both the Navy tilts
would go a long way toward meet
ing the inevitable cracks of skep
tics which are on their way—the
"Stanford can't repeat without
Burness, Pollard, Cowden" talk
that's going to appear as soon as
football arguments have collapsed.
Stanford opens tho» 1843 confer
ence race against Southern Cal here
Jan. 8 and 9.
