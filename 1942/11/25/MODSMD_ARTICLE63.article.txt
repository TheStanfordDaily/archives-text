# Mermen Beat California, 6-4
## 
### FERRIS BOOTHE 
Scoring 55 points to 43 for their
opponents, Stanford's varsity water
polo team won 6 and lost 2 of the 8
games on their schedule this year.
The Indian mermen wound up their
season by defeating California, 6-4,
avenging an earlier defeat.
Individual scoring honors were
taken by Captain Hadley Bacon,
senior forward, with 15 points in 37
attempts at the goal. One of the
most consistent men on the team,
Bacon was kept out of the first Cal
game with three cracked ribs* but
came through last Saturday with one
of the best games of his life.
Emmett Cashin, a transfer from
San Francisco, became eligible this
year and proved himself valuable by
scoring 12 points in 29 attempts. He
played forward and alternated at
sprint with Bill Mapel. Mapel and
A1 Weeden, sophomore guard, fol
lowed with 7 goals in 29 and 21 at
tempts,, respectively.
CARPENTER FOLLOWS
Jack Carpenter with 6 points in 11
tries, Dick Narver and Don Smith
with 3 goals, and Bob Jones with 2
points followed.
Jones, a senior, played center back
and although his point total isn't as
high as others, he was perhaps the
most outstanding member of the
team. Handicapped by an operation
at the start of the season, he came
back in a convincing manner.
Included in Stanford's point total
were a pair of victories over the U.S.
Navy Pre-Flight School at Moraga,
who fell 4-2 and 12-7: and a pair of
wins over San Jose State, 7-5 and
9-6.
UPSET OLYMPIANS
The Indians pulled one of the up
sets of the year in rudely dumping
the Olympic Club. Northern Cali
fornia champions for four years, in
the first of two games. The score
was 10-8. But the Clubmen came
back in the second contest to win
8-5.
Failure to find their shooting eye
and a red-hot California offense
combined to edge Stanford, 3-2, in
the first game of the Big Game
series. But the Indians came back to
even the series Saturday.
Not to be overlooked are the jay
vees, who won 3 games and lost 1.
They scored 33 points to 17 for their
foes in defeating the Pre-Flight re
serves twice and splitting a series
with the Olympic Club reserves.
Graduating members of the team
are Jones, Don Smith, Mapel, Bacon,
Chet Newman, Darrell Ritter. Paul
Egeler, and Don Dillon.
