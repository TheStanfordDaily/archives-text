# Transportation Difficulties May Split Up Coast Football
## 
### 
Round robin football may become a thin*,' of the past when Pacific Coasi
Conference faculty and athletic representatives meet to discuss next year':
gridiron plans in San Francisco Dec. 14 in the annual winter get-together
Noimal schedules are already being disrupted due to gas rationing an<
transportation difficulties, and it is possible that the conference may lu

split up into a northern and south- +
ern division, or even three separate
units, a northern, Bay Area, and
southern division.
The question ot retaining regular
schedules during wartime has been
prevalent all the way along this sea
son, and as A1 Masters, Stanford's
graduate manager, said last night:
"We'll have to cut down on schedules
ourselves or the government will
do it for us."
Masters also will bring up at the
conference the frosh eligibility rul
ing, which has been bandied about
by all the coast schools for two years
now, with only U.S.F. allowing its
first-year men to compete.
There are enough Bay Region j
teams within easy traveling distance
of each other to form a strong, |
evenly matched league right in Stan- ;
ford's own football backyard.
BAY LOOP
A Bay loop could be composed of j
the following teams: Stanford, St. j
Mary's, Santa Clara, California, j
University of San Francisco, and San
Jose State.
In the Los Angeles Area three J
powerful teams, Southern Califor
nia, U.C.L.A., Loyola, would have j
few opponents worth playing. It
may still be feasible to include the
southern teams in the conference, j
There will undoubtedly be a swing
toward taking Santa Clara, St. |
Mary's, and Loyola, three non-con- j
ference schools, into the P.C.C.
Right now this trio, especially j
Santa Clara and St. Marj's, would
give the regular teams more games j
and at the same time provide the
conference with a drawing card of
its own.
Masters favors dropping the Ore
gon and Washington trips from
Stanford's 1943 slate. If the north- ;
ern and southern halves of the con- !
ference had to be separated, they j
could be matched in a championship
game between the two at the end of
the season.

ALFRED MASTERS
Round robin football may become a thin*,' of the past when Pacific Coasi
Conference faculty and athletic representatives meet to discuss next year':
gridiron plans in San Francisco Dec. 14 in the annual winter get-together
Noimal schedules are already being disrupted due to gas rationing an<
transportation difficulties, and it is possible that the conference may lu

split up into a northern and south- +
ern division, or even three separate
units, a northern, Bay Area, and
southern division.
The question ot retaining regular
schedules during wartime has been
prevalent all the way along this sea
son, and as A1 Masters, Stanford's
graduate manager, said last night:
"We'll have to cut down on schedules
ourselves or the government will
do it for us."
Masters also will bring up at the
conference the frosh eligibility rul
ing, which has been bandied about
by all the coast schools for two years
now, with only U.S.F. allowing its
first-year men to compete.
There are enough Bay Region j
teams within easy traveling distance
of each other to form a strong, |
evenly matched league right in Stan- ;
ford's own football backyard.
BAY LOOP
A Bay loop could be composed of j
the following teams: Stanford, St. j
Mary's, Santa Clara, California, j
University of San Francisco, and San
Jose State.
In the Los Angeles Area three J
powerful teams, Southern Califor
nia, U.C.L.A., Loyola, would have j
few opponents worth playing. It
may still be feasible to include the
southern teams in the conference, j
There will undoubtedly be a swing
toward taking Santa Clara, St. |
Mary's, and Loyola, three non-con- j
ference schools, into the P.C.C.
Right now this trio, especially j
Santa Clara and St. Marj's, would
give the regular teams more games j
and at the same time provide the
conference with a drawing card of
its own.
Masters favors dropping the Ore
gon and Washington trips from
Stanford's 1943 slate. If the north- ;
ern and southern halves of the con- !
ference had to be separated, they j
could be matched in a championship
game between the two at the end of
the season.
