# New Sports Editor Receives Fan Mail
## 
### 
Stanford has some real football
fans. Here's a letter received yes
terday by Bob Walt, The Daily's
new sports editor, who replaces
Bob Sontag next January:
Dear Bob.
My mother let me stay up late
last night to hear the Big Game
program. I am 8 years old. I want
to play football when I grow up at
Stanford. You were sure swell in
your talk over the radio. You
must sure know a lot about foot
hall.
Your fan,
Billy Schaffer.
