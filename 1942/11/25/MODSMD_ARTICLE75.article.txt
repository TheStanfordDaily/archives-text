I'VE dreaded this moment from the time I took
over The Daily editorship last summer. Good
byes aren't fun. I've had the privilege of being
editor of The Daily for a longer term than most
persons have—two full quarters.
We had our difficulties. The draft and heavy
class schedules took a big bite out of our man
power. We've been accused of being every
thing from "tools of the Administration" to "rad
icals." But we have found that it's much better
to be criticized from many sources than not be
criticized at all. We've had our share of favor
able comments; it's been nice to know that our
mothers and fathers are not the only ones who
have read and enjoyed The Daily.
The staff, from the editor down to the last of
the cub reporters, have not been able to put the
amount of time into the paper which we would
have had it not been for the war. But we've had
fun and feel proud that we've been able to work
on The Daily.
To run through the edit board and all of the
staff members to point out the hard work each
individual has done would be foolish. It's been
done in the past, but not today. Everyone
knows whether or not he has done a good
job. Personal satisfaction is reward enough.
My job is to tell you about Volume 103, what
it holds in store for you. No matter who tells
you differently, on this campus we have more
than our share of pressure groups. We have
those persons who want to see their names in
print whether they warrant it or not. You have
been chosen editor because your fellow staff
members believe that you have the intelligence
to see through these little people and play the
news as it should be played.
You will find that you are an ex-officio mem
ber of many boards and committees. You can
talk your fool head off at the meetings, but you
can't vote or make motions. Most of these meet
ings v/ill bore the hell out of you, but you will
meet a lot of fine people who will be able to
help you and give you valuable advice.
Crackpots will write choice letters to the Cam
pus Opinion column. Crackpot letters should
be printed but should not go uncriticized. You
will have to help some of these persons see the
right side; you will have to open their minds
for them.
We haven't carried on any terrific campaigns.
Like every other Daily editor in the past, we
have tried to discourage smoking on the Quad.
It hasn't worked, but it's worthanother attempt.
We believe that is one of the more worthwhile
traditions around the Farm.
We've tried to get people to give students
rides into Paly. You won't have to worry too
much about that because of the coming gas
shortage, but you should encourage those who
are able to secure gasoline to pick up hikers.
We have tried to encourage on-campus social
functions. That plan has worked fairly well.
You also won't have much trouble with this;
organizations won't have any choice but to keep
their functions on campus.
We have stretched out into the field of na
tional politics by suggesting several ways by
which the youth of America can be drafted
into the armed forces and still be educated.
We have advocated an educated race of fight
ers; we want an educated race after the war.
Well, Al, the green desk and the swivel chair
are yours for two quarters. We are sorry to
leave, but a change—a good change—never
did any newspaper harm. You will do well as
editor, but don't let that swivel chair throw you;
it's tricky that way.
I'll still be around for another quarter stick
ing my nose into your office. Printer's ink is a
funny thing. I've got a bad case of printer's
inkitis which will undoubtedly stay with me
for lifo.
