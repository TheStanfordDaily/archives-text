# History, 1942

### TED NORTON 
I have been privileged to record in this col
umn what I believe to have been the turning
point of the war.
When the quarter and I started, the United
Nations were not winning. The British were
licking their wounds with their backs to the
Nile, Mac Arthur was isolated in Australia, the
Marines on Guadalcanal seemed stranded on a
mere beach-head, the Red Army had been
driven back to the Volga, and so on. All we
had wherewith to console ourselves were Mid
way, Tokyo, and the news of convoys sailing
and arriving.
Now, after a period of less than two months,
let me tell over the beads again. The Medi
terranean is now very nearly the Mare Nostrum
of the United Nations. Those convoys that
sailed to Britain have sailed on to North Africa;
the lion who huddled in his Egyptian lair has
turned and rent his hunters; Dakar, knife in
our ribs, is ours. The lap fleet has been routed
and in the Solomons "the situation is well in
hand." At Stalingrad, the Axis eagles lie in a
pool of stagnant blood as the valiant Russ press
westward. From India, Ailed bombers harass
the Nipponese flank, and American airmen are
aiding the long-suffering Chinese to drive the
invader from the ancient fields of the Middle
Flowery Kingdom.
As I have said before, and as must be said
for months and years to come, we haven't won
yet. The cesspools of Berlin and Tokyo, whose
evil vapors have poisoned the world, are not
yet cleansed, and until they are scoured with
bayonets, there can be no peace. Can there be
peace afterward? There is much talk, I have
contributed to it myself, of international organi
zation and the outlawry of war. Can it be done?
In our time, yes. We can force the lid on the
seething passions of men for a time, but war is
too easy an answer to too many problems that
vex the aggrieved and ambitious to be banished
by solemn signatures with red seals and rib
bons. What we can do is to try to establish
liberty, the essential of the Four Freedoms,
wherever we can, and educate those on whom
liberty is imposed to appreciate and maintain it.
If we can do that, or even put such a program
on the ways, the effort of the United Nations
will have put another stone in the arch of civili
zation.
I am no military expert, but I have one thing
to say on the conduct of the war. Our admirals
and generals, our joint staffs and theater com
mands, are experts in their work, and they have
made remarkably few mistakes so far. I think
that they want to win the war, and I'm willing
to trust them to do their best. Criticism has its
place, but to criticize without the facts is imbe
cilic. I would like to see an invasion of Europe,
and I am reasonably sure that we will have one
when it is possible.

And that, ladies and gentlemen, is thirty-
See ya!
