The Editor, Sir:
Much has been said about the attitude of the
Stanford students toward the war. As we are
fighting for our inalienable rights, freedom of
speech, press, etc., I feel that even I, a freshman,
can contribute my two cents to the already
overflowing fund of opinions concerning the
matter.
A house meeting in Roble last Monday night
has caused much conversation since it dealt,
primarily, with the girls' attitudes toward this
war. It is constantly crammed down our throats
that we, the girls, are not doing anything to con
tribute to the war effort. We were told that we
should take a specialized course to prepare our
selves for these critical times. We were also
told how lax we are in contributing to Dimes for
Diplomas and buying War Stamps.
What I want to know is: What are the boys
doing toward the war effort?
Do you ever see the percentage of stamps
sold in Encina higher than that of Roble? Do
you find the boys better informed about the war
than the girls? Do you find the boys spending
time doing outside war work such as girls do
in the surgical dressing room? No, you do not.
The thing I find most discouraging of all is that
there is so much crying about the boys getting
their education so that they can be helpful in
the reconstruction of the world after the war
is over.
I, sir, am not aware of any increasing thirst
for knowledge exhibited by the Stanford boys
of today. Do you see the academic standing of
the boys scoring high above that of the girls?
If the male population of this campus can't hold
up its end of the contribution for Dimes for
Diplomas, War Stamps, or civilian war work, it
is my opinion that the least they could do is
make themselves worthy of the opportunity of
a good education.
So I say let's have an ALL CAMPUS "all out
effort for the war'' instead of placing the total
burden on the girls.

of today. Do you see the academic standing of
the boys scoring high above that of the girls?
If the male population of this campus can't hold
up its end of the contribution for Dimes for
Diplomas, War Stamps, or civilian war work, it
is my opinion that the least they could do is
make themselves worthy of the opportunity of
a good education.
So I say let's have an ALL CAMPUS "all out
effort for the war'' instead of placing the total
burden on the girls.

The Editor, Sir:
Much has been said about the attitude of the
Stanford students toward the war. As we are
fighting for our inalienable rights, freedom of
speech, press, etc., I feel that even I, a freshman,
can contribute my two cents to the already
overflowing fund of opinions concerning the
matter.
A house meeting in Roble last Monday night
has caused much conversation since it dealt,
primarily, with the girls' attitudes toward this
war. It is constantly crammed down our throats
that we, the girls, are not doing anything to con
tribute to the war effort. We were told that we
should take a specialized course to prepare our
selves for these critical times. We were also
told how lax we are in contributing to Dimes for
Diplomas and buying War Stamps.
What I want to know is: What are the boys
doing toward the war effort?
Do you ever see the percentage of stamps
sold in Encina higher than that of Roble? Do
you find the boys better informed about the war
than the girls? Do you find the boys spending
time doing outside war work such as girls do
in the surgical dressing room? No, you do not.
The thing I find most discouraging of all is that
there is so much crying about the boys getting
their education so that they can be helpful in
the reconstruction of the world after the war
is over.
I, sir, am not aware of any increasing thirst
for knowledge exhibited by the Stanford boys
of today. Do you see the academic standing of
the boys scoring high above that of the girls?
