To clarify the role of university
women in the war program. North
western University called a confer
ence last month on the basis of the
Bulletin 35 of the American Council
on Education. Miss Anastasia Doyle,
director of vocational advising, rep
resented Stanford at the meeting.
When she reported to Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur that the confer
ence felt the necessity for prompt
and definite action on the pai't of
universities and colleges to meet the
needs he agreed that the
women should get a report from her
as soon as possible.
At this assembly on Nov. 30, Miss
Doyle told of the discussions at the
Northwestern conference and the
vivid impressions they had made on
her. Separate meetings of upper
and lower division students were
held afterwards to discuss new
courses and changes suggested at
the conference.
As the next step in putting their
programs on a wartime basis, women
were given questionnaires last week
in which they stated the amount and
type of work they had completed,
their normal vocational objectives
and their wartime vocational objec
tives. The results of this survey
have been useful to both students
and faculty members.
CONSULT ADVISER
"No one is advised to change her
major without carefully consulting
her adviser. Our purpose is to put
at the disposal of students and fac

attention," the Dean of Women
stated.
To supply information on war
training courses and assistance in
changing programs, academic ad
visers and Miss Yost and Miss Doyle

"Our object is not to protect Stan
ford women, for they don't want
that, but to help them to place them
selves where they are most useful.
Having seen the facts, they should
make a decision and hold to it," Miss
Yost emphasized.
To prepare Stanford women for
service to their country during the
war and afterwards, faculties of the
schools and departments are ar

beginning next quarter, according
to Dean of Women Mary Yost.
Realizing the urgency of the need
for trained women, the University
determined to supplement and adapt
the regular curriculum so that the
women who wish to could prepare

themselves for specific war jobs.
Moreover, work which will be
useful to the individual and to the
country in post war reconstruction
days will be emphasized. It is hoped
that by preparing and stating such a
definite program, the University will
meet the requirements of the gov
ernment and that women will be al
lowed to remain in the University
and take their war training at Stan
ford.
With the greater demands for
manpower in the services and the
greater demands for. production in
industry, the drafting of women may
be necessary if women do not work
where most needed. Miss Yost said
that unless a student is in a pro
gram which the government feels is
valuable she may be placed in one
the government does regard as use
ful.
"Although we believe a course in
the Humanities is as important and
valuable to an individual as, for ex
ample, a course in chemistry, the
government may not believe it to be
equally essential." she said. '"As long
as the colleges are left free to act,
however, we must not forget that in
tangible values are as desirable as
tangible ones."
NORTHWESTERN MEETING
To clarify the role of university
women in the war program. North
western University called a confer
ence last month on the basis of the
Bulletin 35 of the American Council
on Education. Miss Anastasia Doyle,
director of vocational advising, rep
resented Stanford at the meeting.
When she reported to Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur that the confer
ence felt the necessity for prompt
and definite action on the pai't of
universities and colleges to meet the
needs he agreed that the
women should get a report from her
as soon as possible.
At this assembly on Nov. 30, Miss
Doyle told of the discussions at the
Northwestern conference and the
vivid impressions they had made on
her. Separate meetings of upper
and lower division students were
held afterwards to discuss new
courses and changes suggested at
the conference.
As the next step in putting their
programs on a wartime basis, women
were given questionnaires last week
in which they stated the amount and
type of work they had completed,
their normal vocational objectives
and their wartime vocational objec
tives. The results of this survey
have been useful to both students
and faculty members.
CONSULT ADVISER
"No one is advised to change her
major without carefully consulting
her adviser. Our purpose is to put
at the disposal of students and fac
ulty the facts that have come to our
attention," the Dean of Women
stated.
To supply information on war
training courses and assistance in
changing programs, academic ad
visers and Miss Yost and Miss Doyle
will be available next week for in
terviews.
"Our object is not to protect Stan
ford women, for they don't want
that, but to help them to place them
selves where they are most useful.
Having seen the facts, they should
make a decision and hold to it," Miss
Yost emphasized.
