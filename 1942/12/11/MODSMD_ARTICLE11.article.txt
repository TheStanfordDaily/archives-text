# Grant to Head Navy Teachers
## Navigation Will Be Cadets Main Course By NOEL YOUNG 
### 
By March, 90 Stanford professors
will be presenting 600 naval trainees
a curriculum steeped in aerology,
navigation, physics and mathematics,
Professor of Economics of Engineer
ing Eugene L. Grant announced yes
terday.
Thirty instructors will open classes
for the first cadet contingent in Jan
uary, in addition to their student
program. Professor Grant will act
as faculty chairman of the Naval
Flight Preparatory School and, in
conjunction with a naval officer, will
administer the academic program.
The cadets will attend classes six
days a week, eight hours a day. The
12-week program is staggered so that
only one-third of the cadets graduate
at once.
DEAD ROCIvONING
Navigation, including dead reck
oning and physical geography, will
be the biggest dose of studyâ€”two
hours daily for 12 weeks.
Other courses include:
Aerology, Principles of Flight, em
phasizing aerodynamics, Physics,
Mathematics, including trigonometry
and geometric mensuration, Air
Craft Engines, explaining the inter
nal combustion theory, and Com
munication. with instruction in radio
code, blinker and semaphore signals.
Especially adapted texts, prepared
by the Navy, will be used by the
professors. Standard naval cadet
records will supplant student tran
scripts.
PHYSICAL TRAINING
Cadets will be put through one
hour of daily physical training by
naval instructors.
"The Stanford faculty offers its
wholehearted co-operation to the
Navy program," Grant said, "for it
gives us an opportunity to aid in
training the armed forces."
Professor Grant will relinquish
his Assistant Directorship of Stan
ford's off-campus war production
training program, the ESMWT to
Professor Goode, when he assumes
his position in the Navy program,
but will continue his regular Engi
neering classes. Professor Grant is
just beginning instruction of his
ninth group of after-hours Signal
Corps, which began early last spring.
