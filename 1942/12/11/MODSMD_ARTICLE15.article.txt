# Humanities School Offers War Courses
## Stanfordites Adjust Work for Intensive Study of Nations 
### 
The School of Humanities is giving
much attention in the planning of its
program to courses and programs
which will be an immediate contri
bution to the training of men and
ious phases of the present emerg
ency.
In a war of this dimension isolated
specialized training alone will not
fill all of its needs. For this reason,
in addition to certain courses of im
mediate value, the School is empha
sizing a number of very important
school programs and departmental
programs.
Certainly one of the greatest needs,
both in the war effort and in the
post-war world, will be for indi
viduals who have a definite knowl
edge of one or more foreign coun
tries. Thus individuals who have a
sound understanding of France and
the French language, of Germany
and the German language, of Rus
sia, and the Russian language are
going to be of high value now and
later.
KNOWLEDGE OF JAPAN
For example, one of the greatest,
needs felt by the Army at the pres
ent time is for trained individuals
who have an adequate knowledge ol
the Japanese language and Japan.
In order to equip such individuals the
School has set up a program of re
gional majors.
These majors will concentrate the
student's attention and effort upon
the language of the country, its his
tory and traditions, its people, land,
and its resources. Regional majors
have been set up in Germany,
France, Hispanic America, Russia,
and the Far East.
These major concentrations are
open to students from the beginning
of their first quarter at Stanford.
All students interested in beginning
regional majors in the Winter Quar
ter should see the Dean of the School
of Humanities immediately.
LANGUAGE MAJORS
In addition to the regional majors
as such, important majors are being
offered in the language departments
â€”German, French, Spanish, Modern
Greek. Russian. Chinese, Arabic,
Portuguese, and Italian. A very im
portant new course is being offered
in Intensive Japanese, which will
absorb a student's complete time for
the Winter Quarter, and for en
trance to which students should ap
ply to the Dean of Humanities.
Adjusted majors for students of
special aptitudes are being offered in
Graphic Arts, Music, and Speech and
Drama to equip these students for
various professional duties and va
rious services. For example, work
in radio and music, commercial de
sign, children's theater, and special
teacher programs are being offered.
All of the departments of the
School, including English, History,
and Philosophy, are adapting their
programs for war needs. Students
interested in departmental programs
are urged to consult the heads of
departments.
