# P.E. Courses Designed to Aid Men Prep for Armed Forces
## 
### 
Since practically all Stanford men face the prospect of serving in the
armed forces, they should begin to prepare themselves by registering for
the physical education courses which will be of most value to them.
Since we must travel over the water, under the water, and on the water
to meet our enemies, every Stanford man should learn (o swim. This does

not mean to swim across the
but rather to swim long distances ,
with the back, breast, and side I
strokes. They should learn how to j
swim in burning oil. in shark-infested
waters, and under conditions when 1
enemy airplanes are strafing the sur
viors.
SHOULD PREPAIIE
All Stanford men who are contem
plating enlisting in the air forces or
the paratroops should register for
apparatus and tumbling activities.
These activities develop balance, j
which is so important in pilots, in
addition to strength, agility, and co
ordination. Tumbling skills are also
esesntial for those using parachutes.
Soccer and rugby which involve foot
and leg skills are also highly recom- :
mended for those who enter an
aviation branch of service.
BENEFITS
Whatever branch of service one
contemplates, he will benefit, from
boxing and wrestling. Skills in these
sports carry over to personal com
bat, particularly bayonet fighting. In
addition, wrestling develops the arm
and shoulder girdle, which repre
sents the greatest weakness of our j
men.
Army and Navy authorities have
also recommended track and field
activities for the endurance, strength,
and agility they develop: team
sports, such as basketball, football, j
soccer, and baseball, for their con- j
tribution to speed, agility, coordina- i
tion, teamwork, and aggressiveness. '
