# Travel Trouble Threatens Farm Athletics
## Masters to Urge Trip Slash; Favors Frosh Participation 
### BOB SONTAG 
Stanford faces gradual curtailment of all intercollege athletic programs
for the winter and spring quarters because of impending transportation
difficulties, it was revealed at the Board of Athletic Control meeting
Monday.
A1 Masters, Stanford graduate manager, will go before southern division

faculty representatives and
representatives next Monday and
Tuesday in San Francisco with an
appeal to entirely cut out all road i
trips to Los Angeles for baseball and i
track.
The Office of Defense Transporta- ]
tion two days ago asked Bowl fol- 1
lowers to remain at home if their j
team was to travel across country to j
play in one of the New Year's Day !
contests.
BASKETBALL SCHEDULE
Foreseeing even further action re- 1
garding regular winter and spring ;
sports schedules throughout the na- j
tion. Masters will also suggest to the |
conference that the basketball slate ;
be cut from 12 games to eight, elim- |
inating the necessity of making two
trips to Los Angeles.
The new plan calls for a single |
junket to the south, with Stanford j
and California each meeting South- j
ern California and UCLA once. The
two southern teams would also make '
but one trip to the Bay area, meet- I
ing Stanford and California once.
Stanford-California and UCLA-
Southern California rivalry would
be kept at a maximum, however,
with four games scheduled between j
the two pairs of rivals. This would
give each school in the southern di
vision an eight-game schedule with
room remaining for service teams !
and perhaps other local schools.
MORE LOCAL GAMES
Stanford now has non-conference '
games scheduled with St. Mary's.
, Santa Clara, and the University of
San Francisco. To this may be added
other nearby teams, such as the j
Olympic Club, St. Mary's Pre-Flight, j
the Coast Guard, San Jose State, etc.
Stanford meets the Pre-Flighters!
and Hank Luisetti once again Dec. i
21 on its present schedule, but the |
Navy may seek more engagements '
for its five, and Masters would be
only too happy to schedule them.
RUGBY MAY BE DROPPED
Rugby, although not discussed by
| the Board, will probably be aban
doned because Jim Wylie and Wil
lard Classen, who coached the sport
last year, are in the service, and
minor sports director Harry Ma- j
loney is busy with boxing and soccer.
Indications are that a team will
| be formed and coached by the play
| ers themselves, if equipment can be
obtained from the Board.
It is difficult to say what will be
come of the California Intercollegi
ate Baseball Association, but it is
Masters' contention that enough
games can be scheduled in the Bay
J area to complete a normal number
of games. Santa Clara, California,
i and St. Mary's are within accessible
traveling distance. while other
I schools, as in the case of basketball,
may be added to fill out the prob
able loss of the UCLA and Southern
| California series.
Football schedules for next season
. will also be brought up at the meet
ing. and Masters will favor the aban
i doning of all northern trips.
Also on the agenda is the fresh
man eligibility question, which is
j usually shelved every time the con
| ference meets.
"It is almost a necessity that
we allow the freshmen to com
pete on varsity teams," Masters
[ commented. "I'm in favor of it."
