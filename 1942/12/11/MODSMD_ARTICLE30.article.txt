# Some Said This

BESIDES presenting the news faithfully and
unbiasedly every day, a newspaper has an
additional obligation to its readers. It, like any
other public utility, must help out in an emer
gency.
That is what this special edition is trying to
do. Since The Daily ceased publication on No
/ember 25 lots of things have happened that
Â£ igure large in life at Stanford.
It was announced that the Navy would move
nto Stanford. Nobody seemed to know much
about it. Some said this, and some said that;
and with each retelling the rumors pyramided.
On November 30 Miss Anastasia Doyle, As
sistant Dean of Women, gave a vivid report on
he convention of the American Council on Edu
cation concerning the part women must play
in the war program. A great many Stanford
vomen did not understand the program or get
any of the details straight, and again rumors
to mount.
The government's closing enlistments and ihe
effect of this action on the enlisted reserve be
came a springboard for rumors. The same was
:rue of the sports situation at Stanford. Would
ravel shortages destroy the Pacific Coast Con
ference? All these subjects have been loosely
oatted around by the Idle tongue of rumor.
In an effort to spike these rumors this special
edition of The Daily is being put out. The re
oorters have taken valuable time from their
studies to put the paper out. They have been
especially careful in the writing and collecting
of the facts of these stories.
If The Daily acts as an agent to precipitate
some of the rumors at Stanford and to clear the
air for exams, it has been worth the time and
effort.
