# Gasoline Hoarding
## 
### 
"A FIRE early Monday morning destroyed the
J"~?L off-campus home of two Stanford students,
besides destroying the home, the fire unearthed
145 gallons of gasoline which had been illegally
stored.
This is not the only evidence that Stanford
students have been hoarding gasoline without
;he necessary permits. Approximately 300 gal
ianos of gasoline has already been found on the
:ampus and has been confiscated.
From these facts it seems that the two stu
dents are not alone in the storing of gasoline.
From the story that appeared on the front page
Df the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday morn
ing Stanford is not the only college where the
students have thoughtlessly stored gasoline.
Even though this is true, we should not ex
cuse ourselves because everyone is doing it.
That is all the more reason we should abide by
v.he government's regulations.
It might be that these violations stem from a
basic misunderstanding of the object in having
gasoline rationing. The rationing is designed
not to save gasoline but to save tires. It is a
:nileage rationing plan.
Since transportation is vital to a nation as
spread out as is the United States, the tires upon
which it runs must be preserved. Gasoline ra
ioning was not gone into in an ill-considered
manner. It was thought out and well planned
as being the only v/ay to achieve the end of
.saving the nation's tires.
The hoarding of gasoline is not only unpa
triotic since it defeats the government's plan,
but it is also dangerous.
The Stanford men who did store this gasoline
did not mean to be unpatriotic or to go againsl
the government's best interests. They jusl

didn't think beyond having the extended use of
their cars. They didn't think beyond being able
to go to the movies more often, going down to
the highway or driving home.
They didn't think beyond the date when they
will go into the Army or the Navy when they
will no longer have use for their car. Any car
is part of a national reservoir of potential trans
portation and from this they were preparing to
steal.
But in a nation at war, faced with the prob
lems that a war brings with it, there is no place
for the unthinking college student.

:nileage rationing plan.
Since transportation is vital to a nation as
spread out as is the United States, the tires upon
which it runs must be preserved. Gasoline ra
ioning was not gone into in an ill-considered
manner. It was thought out and well planned
as being the only v/ay to achieve the end of
.saving the nation's tires.
The hoarding of gasoline is not only unpa
triotic since it defeats the government's plan,
but it is also dangerous.
The Stanford men who did store this gasoline
did not mean to be unpatriotic or to go againsl
the government's best interests. They jusl

didn't think beyond having the extended use of
their cars. They didn't think beyond being able
to go to the movies more often, going down to
the highway or driving home.
They didn't think beyond the date when they
will go into the Army or the Navy when they
will no longer have use for their car. Any car
is part of a national reservoir of potential trans
portation and from this they were preparing to
steal.
But in a nation at war, faced with the prob
lems that a war brings with it, there is no place
for the unthinking college student.
"A FIRE early Monday morning destroyed the
J"~?L off-campus home of two Stanford students,
besides destroying the home, the fire unearthed
145 gallons of gasoline which had been illegally
stored.
This is not the only evidence that Stanford
students have been hoarding gasoline without
;he necessary permits. Approximately 300 gal
ianos of gasoline has already been found on the
:ampus and has been confiscated.
From these facts it seems that the two stu
dents are not alone in the storing of gasoline.
From the story that appeared on the front page
Df the San Francisco Chronicle yesterday morn
ing Stanford is not the only college where the
students have thoughtlessly stored gasoline.
Even though this is true, we should not ex
cuse ourselves because everyone is doing it.
That is all the more reason we should abide by
v.he government's regulations.
It might be that these violations stem from a
basic misunderstanding of the object in having
gasoline rationing. The rationing is designed
not to save gasoline but to save tires. It is a
:nileage rationing plan.
