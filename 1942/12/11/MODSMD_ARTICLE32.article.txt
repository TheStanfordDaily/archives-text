A YEAR ago today The Daily put out an extra
edition to advise the students of the Uni
versity about the blackout restrictions and other
changes that war had brought to Stanford.
Pearl Harbor had come and gone; many stu
dents had left the Union with tears in their eyes
after hearing President Roosevelt deliver his
address to Congress when he asked for war.
We had gone through our first blackouts and
were about to experience some more in the
middle of finals.
The Japanese troops had started their almost
invincible march southward, and we were still
speculating on what had happened at Pearl Har
bor.
War was yet unreal.
Now maybe war is still unreal. We are still
in college, a few of our friends have been killed,
a large number of them are in either the Army,
the Navy or the Marines, and we ourselves are
in one or another of the reserve programs, are
too young to be drafted, or at least are taking
heavier courses.
With the coming of the Navy to Stanford the
war may become real. Not only will we know
in a vague way that our professors are working
on military secrets or are in Washington doing
government work but on our own campus will
be men in the service. We will be sharing our
buildings and classrooms with the men who are
going to fly our Navy's planes.
Stanford is nearer the war now than in the
first days of shock after Pearl Harbor.
All of us feel that maybe the turning point in
the war has come.
A lot has happened since the extra last year,
but now it seems possible to say that it no
longer has to grow darker before it again grows
lighter.
