# Stanford's Honor Code
## 
### 
WITH the coming of final examinations the
question of the Honor Code again comes
up. This year, because of the Army Enlisted
Reserve program and the Navy's V-l and V-7
programs, the pressure on Stanford men will be
greater than ever in the past.
As in the past the responsibility to observe
the Honor Code falls on the shoulders of the
student, both to see that he himself observes
the code and to see that others do not break it.
Although the prospect of turning in someone
for cheating is not attractive, if Stanford is to
continue to enjoy the freedoms afforded by an
Honor Code, then we must turn in those who do
not observe it. The best way to keep from run
ning afoul of the Honor Code, is not to cheat.
