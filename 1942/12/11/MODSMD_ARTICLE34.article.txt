# Merry Christmas
## 
### 
IN less than a week exams will be over. We
will no longer be rushed for time. No longer 1
will we have a tired feeling all the time, and
the books that we didn't read and the facts that
we didn't memorize will drop into a mist we will
soon call "the halcyon days of our youth."
Soon the crowded trains for those who are
going home will be forgotten and the joy of
seeing one's family will be experienced.
Although there may be oleomargarine in
stead of butter on the Christmas table, and not
enough sugar and butter, and maybe not even
a turkeyâ€”although a brother may be in the
Army or the Navy, and although life may seem
fast and hectic, relax a moment and wish your- !
self and your friends a Merry Christmas.
