### BILL COUGHLIN 
Students who want jobs during
Christmas vacation should check
with the student employment service
in the Ad building. Positions are
available in both Northern and
Southern California.
"There are more openings than we
have students to put in those open
ings," commented Miss Adelaide
Palmer, head of the employment
service. "Any one who wants a job
should have no trouble getting one."
lii Northern California and the
Bay area, there are positions open
with Railway Express, department
stores, and post offices. There are
also manual labor jobs with canner
ies, steel mills, and Southern Pacific
Railroad.
The main positions open in south
ern California are with Railway Ex
press and post offices. Department
store jobs in that area are scarce,
unless arrangements have already
been made or the student has worked
for the store before.
Students should check with the
employment service just before leav
ing campus.
"We have calls for student help
coming in all the time and it is pos
sible that we may not have been
able to contact those who have ap
plied." Miss Palmer declared.
The employment service is located
in room 164 of the Ad building. Of
fice hours are from 8:30 a.m. to
4:30 p.m.
