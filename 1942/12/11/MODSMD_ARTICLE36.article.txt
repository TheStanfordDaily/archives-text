# Pan-Hell Moves Up Rushing
## 
### 
Margaret Wallace, President of
Pan-Hellenic Council, last night an
nounced that women's rushing had
been moved up two days from
Thursday, Jan. 7, to Saturday, Jan.
9.
"This was done," Miss Wallace
stated, "because of the uncertainty
of all women returning by Thurs
day and also in order to allow all
rushees to focus attention on vital
program changes."
Another change in ther ushing
program, according to Miss Wallace,
is the cutting-down of time allowed
for rushing from the usual two hours
to an hour and a half. In addition,
Pan-Hellenic has decided that no
rushing dinners will be served until
the last period of the three rushing
periods. This last period will consist
of just one dinner.
The reasons that most of the rush
ing dinners were cut out. said Miss
Wallace, were to to make the periods
less formal, to save money, and to
create a better spirit amongst both
rushees and rushers.
Pledging date will remain as pre
viously announced.
Another decision of last night's
Pan-Hellenic meeting was to make
all incoming frosh women who have
not received their high school di
plomas ineligible for rushing. The
reasons for this action, said Miss
Wallace, "were because entrance
into Stanford and adjustments to
college life will be difficult enough
without immediately plunging these
young women into a rushing pro
gram."
