# The 						War Is Moving In On The Universityâ€”Wilbur
## 
### 
The war is moving in on the university in some expected
and some unexpected ways. Practically all of the emphasis
up to the present time has been on the men. It is evident that
most of them must be preparing for some form of national
service and that their preparation must be shortened as much
as possible. It is now becoming more evident all of the time
that many of the young women of the country will have to
take up many activities abandoned by men and will also have
to carry on functions of society in which they have already
had the general responsibility: for instance, such as nursing.
While in the university we are endeavoring to offer courses
so that many of our young women can study typewriting,
stenography, nutrition, diatetics, map-making and so on, it is
anticipated that the best way in which many of our women
students can prepare is to continue with their present activ
ities in the various schools and departments.
Our general cultural and social life must go on. We will
need many women who can speak in public. Those who have
skill in drama will have real functions to perform, and we will
need trained experts in all of the modern languages. We need
more teachers and women in social service. We must have
women informed on the cultures, history, religion and cus
toms of the various peoples involved in the war. Any woman
who has a particular capacity in such a field as communica
tions, chemistry, physics, mathematics or geology should get
just as much training as possible.
We anticipate that there will be a steady increase in the
number of young women in industry, which means that we
must have women students in psychology, in personnel, in
management and in that sort of thing. It will probably be
some time before we have manpower legislation that will
involve our young women but. judging from the British ex
perience, that well may come in the not distant future. It is
very important for our women students to blild on what they
have already done and carry to completion work that is ap
propriate for the manifold opportunities that all of our edu
cated women will have.
