## 
### 
Expecting to get the Academic
Council's approval at the Council's
regular meeting next Wednesday
afternoon, Stanford is now making
plans to admit qualified high school
seniors to the University beginning
Winter Quarter.
The plan, according to a statement
released to The Daily by Dr. J. P.
Mitchell. University Registrar, "is
based on the need for starting . . .
training in the University before
reaching the age of 18 years." In
elaborating upon this, the statement

' said, ''This plan will give both men
| and women an opportunity to com
plete a reasonable amount of uni
versity work and thus have a chance
i to qualify for consideration for fur
ther training before entering active
service." It is also thought that by
giving high school students at least
! one year of college life, these stu
dents will be more likely to com
plete their education after the war.
According to Dr. Mitchell. Stan
i ford will require that those who
wish to gain admission to the Uni
versity must have completed at
least three years of high school
work, must have earned seven units
of recommending quality during the
tenth and eleventh grades, and must
have the recommendation of the
high school principal. In addition,
these new students will be required
to pass the regular aptitude test.
POSTWAR REQUIREMENTS
All new students will be expected
to carry regular first year courses
and will be asked to select a definite
field in which they wish 10 prepare
for active service as soon as pos
sible.
This plan, according to Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur, will give the
University an earlier opportunity to
locate for the military and other war
services young people best qualified
in such technical fields as medicine,
engineering, chemistry, physics,
mathematics, military science, in
dustrial management, bacteriology,
nursing, geology, mining, foreign
languages, government economics,
and nutrition.
These curricula, Dr. Wilbur ex
plained, will be coordinated with the
needs of the Army. Navy, and other
governmental services, and will par
ticularly be directed toward the re
quirements of the postwar world.
The plan has already received the
approval of the University's War
Council, where the idea originated,
and has also been okayed by Stan
ford's Board of Trustees and the Ex
ecutive Committee of the faculty.
Dr. Mitchell believes that the plan
will meet little opposition at Wed
nesday's Academic Council meet
ing.

In commenting upon this plan, Dr.
Mitchell stated that "it is necessary
that we prepare our 16- and 17-
year-olds for the best possible serv
ice in this wartime world." He added
that "the words 'freshman, sopho
more, junior, and senior' were sunk
at Pearl Harbor" and that he had
no idea of how many new freshmen
would enter the University Winter
Quarter.
Concerning the rushing status of
the incoming frosh, Dean of Women
Mary Yost said, "I know nothing at
all about it. It's entirely up to In
terfraternity Council and Pan-Hel
lenic." John Bunn, Dean of Men,
strted that he assumed "the new
freshmen's standing would be the
same as the rest of the frosh during
rushing."

In commenting upon this plan, Dr.
Mitchell stated that "it is necessary
that we prepare our 16- and 17-
year-olds for the best possible serv
ice in this wartime world." He added
that "the words 'freshman, sopho
more, junior, and senior' were sunk
at Pearl Harbor" and that he had
no idea of how many new freshmen
would enter the University Winter
Quarter.
Concerning the rushing status of
the incoming frosh, Dean of Women
Mary Yost said, "I know nothing at
all about it. It's entirely up to In
terfraternity Council and Pan-Hel
lenic." John Bunn, Dean of Men,
strted that he assumed "the new
freshmen's standing would be the
same as the rest of the frosh during
rushing."
Expecting to get the Academic
Council's approval at the Council's
regular meeting next Wednesday
afternoon, Stanford is now making
plans to admit qualified high school
seniors to the University beginning
Winter Quarter.
The plan, according to a statement
released to The Daily by Dr. J. P.
Mitchell. University Registrar, "is
based on the need for starting . . .
training in the University before
reaching the age of 18 years." In
elaborating upon this, the statement

' said, ''This plan will give both men
| and women an opportunity to com
plete a reasonable amount of uni
versity work and thus have a chance
i to qualify for consideration for fur
ther training before entering active
service." It is also thought that by
giving high school students at least
! one year of college life, these stu
dents will be more likely to com
plete their education after the war.
According to Dr. Mitchell. Stan
i ford will require that those who
wish to gain admission to the Uni
versity must have completed at
least three years of high school
work, must have earned seven units
of recommending quality during the
tenth and eleventh grades, and must
have the recommendation of the
high school principal. In addition,
these new students will be required
to pass the regular aptitude test.
POSTWAR REQUIREMENTS
All new students will be expected
to carry regular first year courses
and will be asked to select a definite
field in which they wish 10 prepare
for active service as soon as pos
sible.
This plan, according to Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur, will give the
University an earlier opportunity to
locate for the military and other war
services young people best qualified
in such technical fields as medicine,
engineering, chemistry, physics,
mathematics, military science, in
dustrial management, bacteriology,
nursing, geology, mining, foreign
languages, government economics,
and nutrition.
These curricula, Dr. Wilbur ex
plained, will be coordinated with the
needs of the Army. Navy, and other
governmental services, and will par
ticularly be directed toward the re
quirements of the postwar world.
The plan has already received the
approval of the University's War
Council, where the idea originated,
and has also been okayed by Stan
ford's Board of Trustees and the Ex
ecutive Committee of the faculty.
Dr. Mitchell believes that the plan
will meet little opposition at Wed
nesday's Academic Council meet
