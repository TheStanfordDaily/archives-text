The cadet gym instruction is not
a hardening-up process, according to
Mr. Walker, as is the St. Mary's
Flight School program, but will be
merely to keep the men in condition
during their 12-week study period.
FIVE OFFICERS
The Navy will provide 5 officers;
a commanding officer, an executive
officer, an assistant on education, and
two officers on physical education.
There will also be 20 enlisted men, or

Quarters for administration of the
school will be established in the
B.A.C. The unit will also provide
its own books and syllabii.
Mr. Walker said yesterday the
establishment of the Naval Flight
Preparatory School at Stanford is
further evidence of Stanford's help

quarter when they will double up
j to make room for the first contin
' gent of 200 cadets, part of the Naval
Flight Preparatory School being
j established here, who will move into
