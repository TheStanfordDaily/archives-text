Butter and meat shortages, severe
in city areas because of government
quota restrictions, have affected
Stanford's commissary seriously for
the first time, Elliott Ayres, com
missary manager, revealed yester
day.
Ayres, who serves as purchasing
agent for 33 campus living groups,
announced that meat supplies are
very short. Fish, poultry, and meat
less Monday, in addition to supplies
of meat expected early next week,
will probably fill campus tables for
the rest of the quarter, but students
must realize '"that the days of hav
ing meat twice a day are over."
The commissary has had plenty of
butter until this week, but smaller
amounts are to be expected. From
the normal consumption of 6 to 8
pounds per day per house, Ayres ex
pects a drop to one or two pounds.
.Plenty of substitute oleomargarine is
available, he said, and its a case of
"eating oleo or going without."
The commissary has established a
definite policy of pro-rating the
short-stocked goods on the basis of
house populations. "We appreciate
the co-operation of most of the
cooks and managers in resizing our
problem," Ayres said, "but the stu
dents themselves must grasp the sit
uation."
"There are going to be other short
ages. I expect things to be better in
respect to meat next quarter when
government quotas should be read
justed. but things that once came in
cans but can be homemade, such
is baked beans, maple syrup, mayon
naise, are going to be non-existent."
