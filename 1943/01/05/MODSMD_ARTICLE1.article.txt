### 
MOSCOW, Tuesday, Jan. 5 (UP).
— Russian troops have captured
Chernyshkovsky, in the Don bend
110 miles west of Stalingrad, a spe
cial communique said today, and
field dispatches reported that farther
south the Red Army was closing in
on Prokhladnenski, key rail junction
in the Caucasus.
Chernyshkovsky, on the east-west
railway bisecting the Don ben, ap
parently fell to Red Army forces
pushing westward along the line
from Oblivskaya, 12 miles to the
east, which was captured last week.
Iluge Spoils Stores
Huge stores of spoils passed into
Russian hands with the conquest
of Chernyshkovsky, including 17
planes, 2,000.000 shells and 500,000
air bombs, the brief special com
munique of the Soviet high com
mand said.
Unless the Nazis speed up their
retreat back through Prokhladnen
ski, military sources said, they face
the threat of entrapment. Besides
the two main Soviet arms reaching
for the rail junction, a third group
securing the left Soviet flank south
east of Nalchik was reported ad
vancing northwestward toward the
trunk railway, perhaps to swing in
behind Prokhladnenski.
Germans Retreat
The German invaders of the east
central Caucasus were reported fall
ing back rapidly before hard-hitting

Mozdok and Elkhotovo in the direc
tion of Prokhladnenski.
