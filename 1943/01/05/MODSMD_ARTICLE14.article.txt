Stanford's R.O.T.C. courses are
open to all undergraduate men, Col.
Harry B. Allen, head of the military
department has announced.
Recent orders from Washington
have authorized R.O.T.C. units to
enroll civilian members of the Naval,
Marine, and Coast Guard reserves in
the regular military courses.
Col. Allen pointed out that the
. new regulations require that men
who enlisted in Naval. Marine, and
Coast Guard reserves while enrolled
in R.O.T.C. must continue to take
military training.
Facilities of the military depart
ment at Stanford are sufficient to
. take care of all students interested,
it was stated.
"I believe that every college man
j should take advantage of all his op
portunities for both academic and
military training," Col. Allen said.
He advised that members of the
Army Enlisted Reserve, in particu
lar, enroll in R.O.T.C. this quarter.
