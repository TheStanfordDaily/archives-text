# Stanford Plans Courses To Meet Wartime Needs
## 
### COMPILED BY NOEL YOUNG 
Additions of new and revised war-toned courses to the curricula of most
Stanford departments, designed to keep tlic university abreast of swelling
wartime demands, have been made since publication of the Time schedule.
In many departments, whole programs have been adapted to the tune of
war. The political science department, for example, has drawn up a number

of courses to prepare students
post war administration, in conjunc
tion with departments of sociology,
history, economics, the Hoover li
brary and humanities who will round
put the political aspect with a cul
tural background of foreign countries
that will come under post war ad
ministration.
These new courses are specially
significant for men reservists. How
ever, it is emphasized that women
students be encouraged to take
mathematics and nursing courses.
Here is a list of the new and re
vised courses to supplement the
Time schedule:

Recent executive orders enlarging

schedule so that posts in the new
foreign service may be held by per
sons without private incomes, and
providing for appointments upon the
basis of merit alone, has brought
numerous requests of the Political
Science Department to make prep
arations for foreign service require
ments. The character of the exam
inations is to qualify students as
commercial and cultural representa
tives for export-import firms in for
eign trade.
