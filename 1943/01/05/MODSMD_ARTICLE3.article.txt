# Graham Stuart Is Series Speaker
## Series Spotlight Hits N. Africa Situation 
### 
In 1871 the United States was
asked to protect Morocco by the sul
tan, who was worried by the hover
ing, over-interested European pow
ers," said Graham Stuart, who has
just returned from a three months'
stay in Washington where he served
as analyst for the American Hemi
sphere Division of the Board of Eco
nomic Warfare.
Dr. Stuart, professor of political
science, will open the Tuesday Eve
ning Series for the Winter Quarter
when he spenks on "North Africa"
tonight at 7:30 in the Memorial Hall.
Visited Africa
Dr. Stuart is well qualified to give
this address, having visited North
Africa in 1030 and again in 1934. He
has written two books on North
Africa, "French Foreign Policy" and
"The International City of Tangier."
Tangier, which is one of the
world's two international cities (be
fore Japan's invasion. Shanghai was
the other one), is now very much in
the world's news, according to Dr.
Stuart. His book about Tangier is
the only one in any language that
has treated the city thoroughly.
"In the news about North Africa
which we read in the daily papers,
we often forget the type of people,"
Dr. Stuart said.
"They are Berbers and are a very
highly civilized race. For the most
part these people just want to b(> left
alone and the French were wise
enough to realize that."
Remarkable Land
It is truly a remarkable land, he
said. Only in Africa can one find a
modern city side by side with a city
of the Middle Ages. This phenome
non is true because the French try
not to disturb the native way of liv
ing and build their cities outside the
native ones.
"There are great possibilities for
North Africa," he said, "since they
have a climate like that of coastal
California."

"In the news about North Africa
which we read in the daily papers,
we often forget the type of people,"
Dr. Stuart said.
"They are Berbers and are a very
highly civilized race. For the most
part these people just want to b(> left
alone and the French were wise
enough to realize that."
Remarkable Land
It is truly a remarkable land, he
said. Only in Africa can one find a
modern city side by side with a city
of the Middle Ages. This phenome
non is true because the French try
not to disturb the native way of liv
ing and build their cities outside the
native ones.
"There are great possibilities for
North Africa," he said, "since they
have a climate like that of coastal
California."
