# Monte Pfyl Stars For Stinson Field
## 
### 
Monte Pfyl, Ihe ol' firehousei* and
intramural star of many sports at
Stanford, was Stinson Field's out
standing gridiron hero of the past
season. Pfyl was assigned to the
station complement at the San An
tonio Air Depot Training Station.
Pfyl's spectacular passing and
kicking enabled the soldier team to
go through an almost undefeated
season.
Monte's brother, George Pfyl, is
in the Army Air Corps.
