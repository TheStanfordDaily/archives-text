# FRATERNITIES
## Houses Plan 1943 Rushing 
### 
Fraternity rushing will begin to
morrow night when all of Stanford's
24 fraternities hold open houses foi
the freshmen from 7-10 p.m. This
open house period will be followed
by a second on Thursday night at
the same time. A third open house
will be held Saturday afternoon
from 3-6 p.m.
One hundred and five freshmen
who are on probation will be in
eligible for rushing or pledging.
No contact of any kind will be
permitted between fraternity men
and rushees in the period between 9
p.m. of the night ol preference din
ners and formal pledging the follow
ing day. Pledging will be held in
the basement of the Women's Club
house.
Due to the difficulty raised by the
four-quarter system, the term
"freshman" has been re-defmed as
a "new student who has been ad
mitted to Stanford on the basis of his
high school credentials." New lower
division students who join a fra
ternity must remain in Encina until
the end of Spring Quarter unless they
have at least 87 units of credit.
No pledge is binding until formal
pledge day. No student on probation
may be rushed or allowed to pledge.
No house may pledge more than 14
freshmen. Informal contact between
new lower division men and frater
nity men will be permitted after
