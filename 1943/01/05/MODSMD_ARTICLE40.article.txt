# ELIGIBLE FROSH HELP TRACK
## Running Events Look Strong; Stamm's Loss Weakens Field 
### 
"The prospects for the coming,
season are much brighter than in
the past," track coach Franklin
"Pitch" Johnson said yesterday.
With freshman athletes eligible for
varsity competition, due to a deci
sion of the graduate managers and
faculty representatives of the PCC
schools, it is expected to give the
squad more depth, . . but the ad
dition of frosh will not necessarily
improve the performances of the
team, as a whole," Johnson said.
At the present time, the team's
strength lies in the track events,
with not too much power in the field
events. Ed Stamm, outstanding
weightman, will not be here in the
spring, and no one is a prospective
candidate to fill his shoes.
Other losses to the squad through
graduation and entrance into the
service are Ed Hertel, Jim Petit,
Russ Peck, Captain Gene Kern, Ed
Tomaso, Vern Hart," and Wyland
Cripe.
As yet, no schedule has been re

leased.
Johnson urged all freshmen who
I have had some experience in track
| and field to sign up for track for
j their physical education require
| ment.
In the sprints, Johnson has foot
; bailers A1 Hoisch and Randall Faw
| cett, with Bill Quackenbush and
I Fred Sanderman as possible point
| winners; also frosh Ken Sharp and
| Jim Fess.
Prospects for a good mile relay
team are found among the middle
distance runners, for all can do 50
flat or better for the quarter-mile.
Floyd Cuff, Dud Cramer, John Ful
ton, Bruce Meyer, Bob Seals, Larry
Norwood, Bob McLean, Ralph
| Schafferzick, Wayne Girdner, Jim
Doty, and George Grimes are stand
' outs.
At the longer distances, there are
Bob Compton, Larry Gray, Dave
Bills, Bill Eberle, Bob Raitt, Jim
! Chamberlain, and Jim Disher to
carry the Stanford colors. Bob Ad
j ams is a good frosh prospect.

faculty representatives of the PCC
schools, it is expected to give the
squad more depth, . . but the ad
dition of frosh will not necessarily
improve the performances of the
team, as a whole," Johnson said.
At the present time, the team's
strength lies in the track events,
with not too much power in the field
events. Ed Stamm, outstanding
weightman, will not be here in the
spring, and no one is a prospective
candidate to fill his shoes.
Other losses to the squad through
graduation and entrance into the
service are Ed Hertel, Jim Petit,
Russ Peck, Captain Gene Kern, Ed
Tomaso, Vern Hart," and Wyland
Cripe.
As yet, no schedule has been re

leased.
Johnson urged all freshmen who
I have had some experience in track
| and field to sign up for track for
j their physical education require

In the sprints, Johnson has foot
; bailers A1 Hoisch and Randall Faw

I Fred Sanderman as possible point
| winners; also frosh Ken Sharp and
| Jim Fess.
Prospects for a good mile relay
team are found among the middle
distance runners, for all can do 50
flat or better for the quarter-mile.
Floyd Cuff, Dud Cramer, John Ful
ton, Bruce Meyer, Bob Seals, Larry
Norwood, Bob McLean, Ralph
| Schafferzick, Wayne Girdner, Jim
Doty, and George Grimes are stand
' outs.
At the longer distances, there are
Bob Compton, Larry Gray, Dave
Bills, Bill Eberle, Bob Raitt, Jim
! Chamberlain, and Jim Disher to
carry the Stanford colors. Bob Ad
j ams is a good frosh prospect.
