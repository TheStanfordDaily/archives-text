## 
### 
7T LOT has changed since September when
II the class of '46 entered Stanford. Some
}f these changes, like the 'teen-age draft, have
brought forth serious questions. Should youth
go to college during the war?
To Mrs. Samuel Morris, president of the
Stanford Mothers' Club, Dr. Wilbur said:
"All young men and women who can should
get into college as soon as possible and start
specialized training in courses relating to the
var effort."
Ralher than bring up a generation of journey
men, technicians, and craftsmen who have none
of the benefits of a liberal arts education, even
one cut short, Dr. Wilbur's policy should, be
followed.
As many young men as possible should be
given a chance to master engineering and phys
ics and the basic rules that govern them rather
than the rules of thumb for drafting and ar
illery.
In the case of women, should they go on and
get their degrees as usual, or should they take
courses relating only to the war?
In answering this, we must remember that
the war will not go on forever. But then, too,
we must remember that the war must be won
before we can forget the relative speeds of
Zeros and P-38's and remember that Chaucer
was a great poet and Eugene O'Neill wrote ex
cellent plays.
