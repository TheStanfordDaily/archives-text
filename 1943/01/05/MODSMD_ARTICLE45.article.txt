# There've Been Some Changes
## 
### 
TODAY'S Daily is a streamlined five-column
paper. There are some things in it that are
different from other Dailies; some things we
will carry on.
We will have different heads and a different
display of news. We will have more pictures
of local news events. With an enlarged photo
graphic staff of capable photographers, The
Daily is better equipped to carry the news in
pictures.
We have adopted two new columns. One,
OFFICIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS, is a column for
announcements from the University to the stu
dents. These announcements will be run just
as received, thus guaranteeing their accuracy.
The other column, WAR FRONTS, is a sum
mary of United Press war news with no inter
pretation. It will be carefully selected and pre
pared.
We hope that our Tabby will be well written,
that it will be accurate and concise, and that it
will be interesting and wide awake; but, above
all, we hope that it will always exercise good
taste and be honest and sincere.
