# Army Not Navy
## 
### 
SINCE December 11 when The Daily put out
an extra edition to announce that the Navy
was to occupy Branner Hall, the picture of Stan
ford and the War has been sponged out and re
painted with new khaki uniforms.
The Army and not the Navy will train men
at Stanford in a specialized school yet to be
eshtablished.
Although the Navy had issued a letter of in
tent and shipped furniture to the University, the
War Manpower Commission made the change
to accommodate to its over-all plan for the use
of colleges and universities in its training pro-!
gram.
Although much thought and work had been
expended to make Stanford ready for the Naval
Flight Preparatory School, we feel certain that |
Stanford, with its fine equipment and facilities,
will serve the Army just as well as it would
have served the Navy.
