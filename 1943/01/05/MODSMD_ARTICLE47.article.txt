# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
(Editor's note—ln 1935 The Daily had a hasher
who had something to say and so they ran a
column "Our Hasher Sez."
Again The Daily has a hasher who we think
has something to say. What he says will not
necessarily be funny, not necessarily be seri
ous.
It will just be observations on life from the
wrong side of a tray of Jello.)
Everybody is happier because rushing in the
next few days is rushing. Everybody is not
quite as happy, however, as are the Hashers,
who are right now probably not jumping up
and down in anticipation.
Our Hasher is probably even not happier than
any of the rest, because he has an allergy to
warmc-d-over tea, stale cookies, stiff jackets, and
above all Roble women, who, incidentally, are
not as good this season as they have ever been
before at that ivy-decked hall. This is the signal
for a blast of campus opinion letters to come in
from anonymous Roble women, who claim they
are prettier than the girl in 313 last year, so
there.

If any faculty members feel they could handle
more duties this quarter, Our Hasher can let
them in on an opening for a second cook's posi
tion. It is better if they can produce letters of
recommendation from their department heads
as to their dependability, as the head cook is
quite particular.
While on the subject Our Hasher is ac
quainted with a second cook or two who might
fill a spot on the faculty.

Joe Stalin nosed out Frank Sinkwich as Time's
man-o'-the-year. This is undoubtedly a great
setback for the Associated Mac Arthur Clubs of
America and Outlying Possessions, but then Joe
is not only recording and corresponding secre
tary of the Comintern, but he's a Rushin, and
don't forget, girls—this is Rushin' Season.
