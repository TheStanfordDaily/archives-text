# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
The Campus, Dear Sirs:
The Daily staff may write the rest of this paper
but this column is for your use alone. In it you
may air your grievances to The Daily, to the
Administration, to the world in general. In it,
you can write any opinion you wish on any
subjectâ€”that's why it's called Campus Opin
ion. To get your opinion in this column just
write what you want, sign your name, and drop
it by the Daily shack or give it to any Daily
staff member. Be sure and sign your name even
though you may not want your name published.
If you wish, we will not print your name but
we must have your name for our records to
know that the letter is authentic. Hoping to hear
from you in the near future.
