# HIGH SCHOOL SENIORS ARRIVE
## Bunn Expects 50 High School Seniors to Register Today 
### 
Another wartime adjustment in Stanford's educational program will
result this quartet: in the entrance of some 50 high school seniors into
Stanford.
These new students have answered most of the normal requirements for
college entrance except for the completion of a sufficient number of units
to receive a high school diploma. +

Seven recommended units of high i
school work and the usual number j
of personal recommendations are re- j
quired as well as successful comple- !
tion of the Stanford Aptitude Tost. '
Most of the students took their tests
yesterday and they were graded last j
night.
More Men
A preliminary check yesterday
ifternoon showed that more men
than women students were taking
this opportunity to enter college a
year sooner. Twenty-six boys and j
four girls had made room reserva- i
tions yesterday afternoon. Accord- !
ing to Dean John Bunn, from 30 to j
50 may be expected befoi'e registra- |
.ion is completed.
"The chance to go to college a year j
earlier is particularly important to I
high school seniors near the draft
age, who might be drafted immedi
ately after finishing high school,"
Dean Bunn said.
If these boys can enter college
and sign up in a reserve now, they
may get an educational deferment.
And even if they don't, they have
had a taste of college education .
which might otherwise be denied j
i hem.
Superior Students
"Although these boys are younger
than most freshmen we think they
can make the grade scholastically.
