## Present Farm Ratio of 1.9 May Decline Still Further Today 
### 
Little change is expected in the
total registration at Stanford this
quarter, according to Dr. J. P. Mitch
ell, Registrar. And if last quarter's
trend is continued, the 1.9 ratio o£
men to women students may be de
creased further.
New and old students will register
from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. today in the
Administration Building. Advisors
will be in the building to talk with
students. A fee of $2 a day is charged
to late registrants.
"There are so many conflicting
forces entering into decisions to
enter college in these times that it is
difficult to predict what the regis
tration will be," Dr. Mitchell said.
"We expect very little change from
last quarter, however."
Last quarter, 2,197 men and 1.32S
women enrolled on Registration Day,
a 10 per cent drop from the previous
year. The ratio dropped from 2 to 1
to 1.9 to 1. Preliminary figures on
the number of men and women re
turning indicate a further decrease
in the ratio although more men than
women high school seniors or grad
uates have signified their intention?
to enter Stanford.
