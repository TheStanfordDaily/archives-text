Why we have to
Peninsula Trains
effective Jmumy 10
Every locomotive we have or can rent is working overtime to handle
the traffic that is pouring over our lines. Many times we have to use two
or more of our very smallest engines to move a troop train or war freight
that should be handled by one bigger engine.
On the other hand some of our biggest "Pacific" engines (P-B's and
P-10's) are pulling local trains on the Peninsula where smaller Parities
(p-r s to P-4's) could do the job, though not as fast.
So we are going to trade some of our biggest Peninsula engines for the
smaller Pacifics in use elsewhere. We will make the trade January 10,
and new Peninsula train schedules will go in effect at 12:01. a.m. that
day. The new schedules will be somewhat slower, because the smaller
engines can't pull trains as fast. Also, trains must have more time to load
and unload at stations, because of the increased train travel caused by
gasoline rationing.
We dislike to make these changes, but there just isn't any other solution
to the problem because of the acute shortage of locomotives.
For the majority of commuters the slower times will add but a few min
utes to their present trips. Trains with the fewest stops will be affected
least of all.
We have been checking Peninsula traffic very closely and, to meet the
changing conditions, some further adjustments will be made in train
service on January 10. We are discontinuing one late morning train each
Avay (trains 114 and l4l) and adding one early morning commutation
train into San Francisco. The schedule of train 106 out of San Francisco
after midnight will be shortened 35 minutes, by relieving this train of
baggage and express, which will be handled on a separate train. Two
trains will be added out of San Francisco Saturday afternoon.
We expect that the new schedules will enable us to provide a better "on
time" performance.
New Peninsula timetables will be at all Peninsula stations before the
effective date, January 10. Be sure to get a new timetable.
