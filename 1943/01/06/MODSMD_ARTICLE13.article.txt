# TUESDAY SERIES
## Advantage of North African Invasion Discussed by Stuart 
### 
Climaxing liis talk with a presentation of recent military developments
Dr. Graham Stuart opened the Tuesday Evening Series for the Winter
Quarter with a talk on North Africa.
In discussing the advantages of the recent North African invasion, Dr.
Stuart advised his audience just to take a glance at the map. American

forces are now within very short*
striking distances of Sardinia and j
Sicily, which opens the way for an j
attack upon the continent through 1
Italy.
Another advantage that the pro- j
fessor mentioned was the relief it
would afford ot the battered island
of Malta. North Africa has many I
excellent airplane fields and these
can be put to use in bombing raids
upon Italy and Vichy France. Land
based planes from here can also be
used to protect convoys and for
other defensive purposes. In sum
ming up the invasion Dr. Stuart
stated that "although it is not a sec- i
ond front in Europe, it is a long step
in that direction."
Secret Campaign
He told how the campaign was
planned and carried out in absolute j
secrecy. All hough .850 ships took j
part in the raid, very few of even I
those who were directly connected
with it, knew where the ships were I
headed. He holds the opinion that ;
the Dieppe raid might have been j
carried out to confuse the Germans. I
He explained how the troops were j
outfitted in winter clothing to create |
the illusion that they were bound j
for Norway instead.
As a background to his later dis
cussion, Dr. Stuart talked about the
international settlement at Tangier
upon which he is a distinguished
authority. He traced its long history j
and the background of its inter- I
national status up to the time that j
General Franco invaded it and took
over in 1940. If the Germans at
tempted to march through Spain,
Dr. Stuart feels that the British and
U.S. forces will quickly occupy all
the Spanish territory in North
Africa including Tangier.
Sidelights
The speaker presented some inter- i
esting sidelights about the natives j
of North Africa, the Berbers, whom
he considers a very highly civilized
race. As a bit of a contrast to the i
American practice North African j
teachers are recruited from the j
ranks. Any student who can gather J
enough listeners about him, is ap- !
pointed a professor and he retains !
that status as long as he can hold his
listeners' interest.

The revenues of the State of Cali
fornia for the year 1916-17 was only
9 per cent of last year's income.

in that direction."
Secret Campaign
He told how the campaign was
planned and carried out in absolute j
secrecy. All hough .850 ships took j
part in the raid, very few of even I
those who were directly connected
with it, knew where the ships were I
headed. He holds the opinion that ;
the Dieppe raid might have been j
carried out to confuse the Germans. I
He explained how the troops were j
outfitted in winter clothing to create |
the illusion that they were bound j
for Norway instead.
As a background to his later dis
cussion, Dr. Stuart talked about the
international settlement at Tangier
upon which he is a distinguished
authority. He traced its long history j
and the background of its inter- I
national status up to the time that j
General Franco invaded it and took
over in 1940. If the Germans at
tempted to march through Spain,
Dr. Stuart feels that the British and
U.S. forces will quickly occupy all
the Spanish territory in North
Africa including Tangier.
Sidelights
The speaker presented some inter- i
esting sidelights about the natives j
of North Africa, the Berbers, whom
he considers a very highly civilized
race. As a bit of a contrast to the i
American practice North African j
teachers are recruited from the j
ranks. Any student who can gather J
enough listeners about him, is ap- !
pointed a professor and he retains !
that status as long as he can hold his
listeners' interest.

The revenues of the State of Cali
fornia for the year 1916-17 was only
9 per cent of last year's income.


DR. GRAHAM STUART
Climaxing liis talk with a presentation of recent military developments
Dr. Graham Stuart opened the Tuesday Evening Series for the Winter
Quarter with a talk on North Africa.
In discussing the advantages of the recent North African invasion, Dr.
Stuart advised his audience just to take a glance at the map. American

forces are now within very short*
striking distances of Sardinia and j
Sicily, which opens the way for an j
attack upon the continent through 1
Italy.
Another advantage that the pro- j
fessor mentioned was the relief it
would afford ot the battered island
of Malta. North Africa has many I
excellent airplane fields and these
can be put to use in bombing raids
upon Italy and Vichy France. Land
based planes from here can also be
used to protect convoys and for
other defensive purposes. In sum
ming up the invasion Dr. Stuart
stated that "although it is not a sec- i
ond front in Europe, it is a long step
in that direction."
