# Cellar Labor Shortage Acute
## 
### 
With the increased uncertainty of
ood supplies added to its troubles,
he Union Cellar, lucky to % stagger
hrough Fall Quarter with a war
educed staff, is in extreme need of
tudent help, Miss Christine Ricker,
)irector of Dining Halls, declared
esterday.
Miss Ricker is again pleading for
elp with the hope that "the stu
ents, having experienced uncom-
Drtable conditions in the Cellar last
uarter will now realize the ad- ]
ersity of the situation and will do |
imcthing about it."
It is possible, Miss Ricker ex
lains, for those who have one or two j
ays free from classes to work an
ight-h our shift one or both of those
ays. Although most students prob
bly are carrying heavier classroom
â€¢ads, the director hopes that some
udents will be able to work ac

cording to that plan. This scheme
works better than one or two hours'
work each day, hut any kind of help
is naturally acceptable. Miss Ricker |
; suggests that a staggering of eating
hours would be of more than a little j
help. She referred particularly to ;
conditions at noon when many who
are accustomed to a 12 o'clock or |
thereabouts meal are forced to wait j
longer. "I don't believe that those
: students without IX o'clock classes
necessarily have to wait until noon
for their lunches," she said. "At
least I don't see why EVERYONE
j has to rush in at 12."
In connection with the jittery i
food situation she said, '"We'll have j
to sit tight," until rationing begins ;
'next month.
Tuesdays will be meatless and the !
ice cream supply has been cut 40 j
per cent so a la modes are OUT. i
Unless conditions get worse the Cel
lar will open at 7:30 a.m. and close
at 8 p.m. every day except Sundays. I
