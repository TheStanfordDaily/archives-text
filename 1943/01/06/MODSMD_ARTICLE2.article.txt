# Winter Quarter Registration Off 388
## Farm Ratio Hits New Low of 1.6 As Total Enrollment Falls 456 
### 
Three hundred and eighty-eight [
fewer students registered yesterday j
than registered on the first day of
Winter Quarter in 1942, according
to Dr. J. P. Mitchell, Registrar.
And Stanford's far famed man
woman ratio dropped to 1.6 from
1.7 last autumn and 1.9 last winter.
The first day's registration for
1943 totalled 3,188 —1,962 men and j
1,226 women—compared with a total
of 3,576 —2,361 men and 1,251 women
—for the first day of Winter Quar
ter in 1942.
"We feel that we have been fortu
| nate in holding registration to such
i a slight drop in these unsettled '
times. The decrease is not much j
j greater than the ordinary drop from
; Autumn to Winter quarters," com
mented Dr. Mitchell.
This year's drop from Autumn to
Winter quarters totalled 456 in com
parison with a drop of exactly 300
last year.

"We cxpect a larger late registra
tion this year than in past years be
cause of difficult transportation con
ditions. One group of students came
in too late to register today because
the Challenger was delayed. We
last year. And, surprisingly enough,
the drop is proportionately about
the same for men and women.
This year's Autumn to Winter drop
totalled 318 men and 138 women
compared with a decrease last year
of 209 men and 91 women students,
expect another group of late regis
trants from Los Angeles tomorrow,"
I he added.
Fee for late registration is S2 per
| day.
Looking back through the years

Looking back through the years
I to registration for Winter Quarter
j in 1917, several comparisons may be
j shown. This quarter 456 fewer stu
i dents registered. For the same quar
j ter in 1917 the enrollment dropped
< only 17.
Three hundred and eighty-eight [
fewer students registered yesterday j
than registered on the first day of
Winter Quarter in 1942, according
to Dr. J. P. Mitchell, Registrar.
And Stanford's far famed man
woman ratio dropped to 1.6 from
1.7 last autumn and 1.9 last winter.
The first day's registration for
1943 totalled 3,188 —1,962 men and j
1,226 women—compared with a total
of 3,576 —2,361 men and 1,251 women
—for the first day of Winter Quar
ter in 1942.
"We feel that we have been fortu
| nate in holding registration to such
i a slight drop in these unsettled '
times. The decrease is not much j
j greater than the ordinary drop from
; Autumn to Winter quarters," com
mented Dr. Mitchell.
This year's drop from Autumn to
Winter quarters totalled 456 in com
parison with a drop of exactly 300
last year.

"We cxpect a larger late registra
tion this year than in past years be
cause of difficult transportation con
ditions. One group of students came
in too late to register today because
the Challenger was delayed. We
last year. And, surprisingly enough,
the drop is proportionately about
the same for men and women.
