# Majors Abandon Spring Training
## 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 5 (U.R). â€”Major-
League baseball clubs today aban
doned their extravagant spring train
ing as a war-time "sacrifice" but
retained their full championship
schedule of 154 games.
The action was taken at a special
joint meeting called by Baseball
Commissioner Kenesaw M. Landis
to straighten out a muddle which has
existed since the close of last season.
The groundwork for the action here
was laid a week ago at a conference
between Landis and Defense Trans
portation Director Joseph B. East
man at Washington.
The solution of baseball's emer
gency woes was far less drastic than
many observers expected. The action
was regarded as a "middle of the
road" approach of the various "cure
all" plans that had been suggested
for the game's future operation.

Of the 51 piers of the Oakland Bay
Bridge, the largest is 92x197 feet.
