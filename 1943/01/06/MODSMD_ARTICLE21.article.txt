# Farm Grad Describes Life As WAAC Lt.
## 
### BY BARBARA STEVENS 
"We love the work, hate loafing,
and are crazy to get overseas,"
writes Mary Judson, '41, former
Daily night editor and now a Lieu
tenant in the WAACS, in a letter to
Miss Lucy Lataillade, Ventura.
Miss Judson, second in command
Jn the advance guard of the officer's
training center at Daytona Beach,
Fla., outlines a day in the regiment.
Special officers' courses take up the
morning and latter part of the after
noon. For two hours after we drill
. . . "and how."
She says, ''The morning classes are
;n specialized courses. We are learn
ing to teach, about which I know
nothing. But I have found that in
the army, when you must you must,
and oddly enough I can."
Barracks Life
Though Miss Judson shares an ex
pensive but "gorgeous" apartment
off the post with four other girls
(only setback is the necessity to do
the cooking themselves or eat out),
women from the Auxiliary ranks
]ive in barracks. ". . . . tougher life
than having the made-over dormi
tories enjoyed by the WAVES."
The barracks are bare except for
Wall lockers, footlockers, army drab
chairs and beds.
Alarm Clock
The roar of a cannon at 5:30 a.m.
serves as an alarm clock for these
strong-minded, hardy women. Rev
eille follows, then back to make beds
(army style, meaning NO wrinkles),
and to the mess hall for a cafeteria
style breakfast on eight-section
trays. The newer smaller WAAC
messes have set tables and food
served on dishes. The food is real
and good.
Fortified WAACS return to the
barracks to dust, mop, sweep, scrub,
with ''gigs" hanking over their
heads for any lapses in schedule.
The day begins with close-order drill
and ends with physical education.
Retreat is sounded to close the work
ing day. Evenings are free except
for those on KP or special company
'duties.
Uniform Complete
"We are issued clothes from the
skin out," reports the new Lieu
tenant, "and get gasmasks (when
sent overseas) canteens and mess
kits." Summer uniforms are khaki
cotton gabardine and poplin shirts;
winter issue is dark green wool.
Besides khaki colored unmention
ables the lady soldiers have two
pairs of fine army russet service
shoes, one pair of sneakers and ga
loshes, one pair maroon leather bed
zoom slippers, six pair hose, assorted
skirts, hats, jackcts, shirts, a wool
princess-style) overcoat and a green
silk raincoat.
1 lousecoats
For winter nights the WAACS are
Issued maroon corduroy housecoats
and black and white checked flannel
pajamas.
"We can wear civvie clothes for
social life or week-ends and free
hours, says Miss Judson, "but never
on duty or if in an army building
and il we are made part of the army
(attached now) we shall wear uni
forms all of the time."
"Sure there are gripes, but what
ife is free of them? And there are
aughs, fun, comradeship, teamwork,
and a feeling of selflessness for the
U.S., which is fine. It is a hard life,
every mintue of it is worth the
effort and will last a lifetime."

Uniform Complete
"We are issued clothes from the
skin out," reports the new Lieu
tenant, "and get gasmasks (when
sent overseas) canteens and mess
kits." Summer uniforms are khaki
cotton gabardine and poplin shirts;
winter issue is dark green wool.
Besides khaki colored unmention
ables the lady soldiers have two
pairs of fine army russet service
shoes, one pair of sneakers and ga
loshes, one pair maroon leather bed
zoom slippers, six pair hose, assorted
skirts, hats, jackcts, shirts, a wool

"We can wear civvie clothes for
social life or week-ends and free
hours, says Miss Judson, "but never
on duty or if in an army building
and il we are made part of the army
(attached now) we shall wear uni
forms all of the time."
"Sure there are gripes, but what
ife is free of them? And there are
aughs, fun, comradeship, teamwork,
and a feeling of selflessness for the
U.S., which is fine. It is a hard life,
every mintue of it is worth the
effort and will last a lifetime."
"We love the work, hate loafing,
and are crazy to get overseas,"
writes Mary Judson, '41, former
Daily night editor and now a Lieu
tenant in the WAACS, in a letter to
Miss Lucy Lataillade, Ventura.
Miss Judson, second in command
Jn the advance guard of the officer's
training center at Daytona Beach,
Fla., outlines a day in the regiment.
Special officers' courses take up the
morning and latter part of the after
noon. For two hours after we drill
. . . "and how."
She says, ''The morning classes are
;n specialized courses. We are learn
ing to teach, about which I know
nothing. But I have found that in
the army, when you must you must,
and oddly enough I can."
Barracks Life
Though Miss Judson shares an ex
pensive but "gorgeous" apartment
off the post with four other girls
(only setback is the necessity to do
the cooking themselves or eat out),
women from the Auxiliary ranks
]ive in barracks. ". . . . tougher life
than having the made-over dormi
tories enjoyed by the WAVES."
The barracks are bare except for
Wall lockers, footlockers, army drab
chairs and beds.
Alarm Clock
The roar of a cannon at 5:30 a.m.
serves as an alarm clock for these
strong-minded, hardy women. Rev
eille follows, then back to make beds
(army style, meaning NO wrinkles),
and to the mess hall for a cafeteria
style breakfast on eight-section
trays. The newer smaller WAAC
messes have set tables and food
served on dishes. The food is real
and good.
Fortified WAACS return to the
barracks to dust, mop, sweep, scrub,
with ''gigs" hanking over their
heads for any lapses in schedule.
