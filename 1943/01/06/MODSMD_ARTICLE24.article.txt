# DR. TRUEBLOOD
## Chaplain Returns from Tour Of Militarized Schools in East 
### 
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, chaplain
of the University, returned recently
from a tour of eastern colleges made
during Autumn Quarter. Dr. True
blood spoke at colleges and univer
sities throughout the East and chiefly
at Yale, Harvard, Dartmouth, Con
necticut, Haverford, Earlham, and
Rollins colleges.

The colleges in the East are much
more militarized than Stanford, ac
cording to Dr. Trueblood. "Harvard
has loudspeakers on the campus over
which martial music is played and
the students march to class," he
said.

The predominance of dark blue
because of the Naval indoctrination
School was evident at Dartmouth,
according to Dr. Trueblood. The
larger schools have been more
changed by the war, he said. He also
said that Rollins College in Florida,
the least changed of those he visited
is much like Stanford.
'"The most universal opinion I
found among the college sultieiTts
was their agreement that we must
put as much effort into the peace as
into the war," he said. "Without this
effort the sacrifices made will Jje
wasted, and the young people of the
nation are eager that their sacrifices
are not wasted," he added.
The eastern schools seem to be
more conscious of what's happening
but the people are curious about
what Stanford is doing in the war.
The stress given to courses on the
Far East is admired, according to
Dr. Trueblood, and they think that
is what schools facing the Pacific
should do.
Nearly all the colleges thought
there would be no men students but
the enrollments have not decreased
so fast as expected, according to Dr.
Trueblood. The smaller men's col
leges which can not obtain any gov

eminent support may close when the
reserves are called, he said.

The prospect of the establishment
of a reconstruction unit at Swarth
more College under a committee of
which New York's Governor Lehman
is the chairman was the most inter
esting thing on the trip, according
to Dr. Trueblood.

Among the persons to whom Dr.
Trueblood spoke while on tour was
Lowell Thomas, commentator, who
was present at an address given at
Dartmouth.

Dr. Trueblood will give the sermon
at the Memorial Chapel this Sun
day. The topic will be "What Men
Live By." The sermon will be Dr.
Trueblood's first since his return.
