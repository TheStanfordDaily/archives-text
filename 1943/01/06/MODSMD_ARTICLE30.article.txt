# Stanford Scientist Discovers Stimulant to Prevent Sleep
## 
### 
Although it isn't meant to be used
during finals week, Stanford scien
tists have discovered a powerful
"pep" pill that will keep a man so
wide awake, stimulated and alert,
that sleep is impossible for at least
18 hours.
Research on the chemical —methyl-
benzedrine—was conducted by Dr.
Maurice Tainter of the Stanford
Medical School and Dr. Armando
Novelli, who conducted his share of
the experiments at the Faculty of
Medicine in Buenos Aires, Argen
tina.
The new pep pill is roughly twice
potent as adrenalin and ordinarv

i benzedrine, 80 times more effective
than caffein in coffee.
According to Dr. Tainter, a 10-
! thousandth of an ounce of methyl
benxedrine produces unmistakable
stimulation and alertness. With this
; dosage, a man will be able to think
| and react faster. When the effect of
' the drug wears off, the user falls
j into normal sleep. The two men
i claim that this dosage, when taken
after 10 o'clock in the morning, will
! prevent sleep during the following
night.
Work on methyl-benzedrine, Dr.
j Tainter said, began in 1938 at Stan
' ford and in Germany and Denmark.
