# Survey Ranks Farm Libe High

### 
The Stanford University Libraries
rank twelfth among American col
lege libraries and fourteenth in the
country at large, according to a re
cent study in "The Library Quar
terly."
The study, conducted by Robert
B. Downs, lists the number of times
specific libraries are mentioned by a
panel of 500 persons. Stanford's re
ported position is considered un
usually high, according to the "Stan
ford Univeristy Bulletin," in view of
its comparative youth and the fact
that Stanford offers no instruction
in 19 of the 75 fields surveyed.
Dr. Nathan Van Patten, Director
of University Libraries, believes that
Stanford ranks unusually high in at
least .'5O fields.
Stanford has the seventh fastest
growing university libraries in the
country, only six other institutions
having more accessions annually.
