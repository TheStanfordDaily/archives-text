# Disastrous Oregon Flood Retreating
## 
### 
PORTLAND. Jan. 5 (U.R).—The
end of Western Oregon's most de
structive flood in half a century was
in sight tonight as the turbulent
Willamette River, which swept wild
ly through valley lowlands in a tor
rent of destruction, subsided slowly
but steadily.
In the wake of the roaring waters
were the reminders of the tragic
heights it reached—lo persons dead
or missing and untold millions in
property damage.
Weather observers predicted the
river would continue its recession
with no further outbreaks.

Tlie longest span of the Bay Bridge
is 2,310 feet.
