"Heap on more wood!—the wind is
chill.
But let it whistle as it will.
We'll keep our Christmas merry
still!"
—Scott.
the big feasts of cranberry
and what goes with it, it is time to
start a column, and like most things,
there are some good points in start
ing right after Christmas, and too,
some bad points.
Perhaps the worst feature is that
unlike beginning a column alter the
long summer vacation, you have met
very few sport personalities. How
ever, I did manage to grip the Hesh
of a few big fellows that once were
stars in their own right. But I'll save
them for later.
Sincc this is the first attempt of
Volume 103, let s give thanks to
Boh "Salty" Sontag. He's a tough
man to follow, and his knowledge
and anal.vsisof the sporting situa
tion should he respected. His "Salty
Sez" used to say much, and he
often got off some very funny
yarns.
The policy of SIDELINE SLANTS
should be recorded for posterity in
the initial attempt. The policy is
(*". As soon as I think up
a good code of principles to follow,
I'll let you know. The only thing that
SLANTS will try to do this quarter
is to keep it as informal as possible,
talk once in awhile about things
other than sports, compliment some
body now and then, and pan every
body now and then. Perhaps when
things get rather lean, 1 11 dig up a
few old columns by ex-sports editors
and run them.
Keeping with the old traditions
of Stanford, the column has gone
hack to the archaic name it has
had for 52 years.
Oh yes, that poem at the top of
the column has absolutely no con
nection with what follows, but if
"Our Hasher Sez" can make up
original stanzas, certainly SLANTS
can steal three lines from some guy
that got paid for it.

But let it whistle as it will.
We'll keep our Christmas merry

the big feasts of cranberry
and what goes with it, it is time to
start a column, and like most things,
there are some good points in start
ing right after Christmas, and too,
some bad points.
Perhaps the worst feature is that
unlike beginning a column alter the
long summer vacation, you have met
very few sport personalities. How
ever, I did manage to grip the Hesh
of a few big fellows that once were
stars in their own right. But I'll save
them for later.
Sincc this is the first attempt of
Volume 103, let s give thanks to
Boh "Salty" Sontag. He's a tough
man to follow, and his knowledge
and anal.vsisof the sporting situa
tion should he respected. His "Salty
Sez" used to say much, and he
often got off some very funny
yarns.
The policy of SIDELINE SLANTS
should be recorded for posterity in
the initial attempt. The policy is
(*". As soon as I think up
a good code of principles to follow,
I'll let you know. The only thing that
SLANTS will try to do this quarter
is to keep it as informal as possible,
talk once in awhile about things
other than sports, compliment some
body now and then, and pan every
body now and then. Perhaps when
things get rather lean, 1 11 dig up a
few old columns by ex-sports editors
and run them.
Keeping with the old traditions
of Stanford, the column has gone
hack to the archaic name it has
had for 52 years.
Oh yes, that poem at the top of
the column has absolutely no con
nection with what follows, but if
"Our Hasher Sez" can make up
original stanzas, certainly SLANTS
can steal three lines from some guy
that got paid for it.
