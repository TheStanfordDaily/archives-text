Stanford's 1043 varsity basketball team returned to the Farm today, ar
riving in San Francisco on the 7:20 a.m. "Challenger" minus Coach Everett
Dean, who is visiting relatives in Indiana, to practice for S.C. game.

ers who could only see huge holes
left by Burness, Cowden, and Pol
lard.
In the Sugar Bowl, Great Lakes
led at halftime 22-17, followed
through for a 57-41 win. Likewise
Illinois led 24-9 at halftime, capped
it off 38-26. Accuracy of Freddy
Linari and Jack Dana at forwards
seemingly wasn't supported by the j
famed airtight defense which scut- !
tied Dartmouth in the NCAA final i
last year.
On the other hand the caliber of
opposition was definitely tough for
opening play. St. Mary's had Lui
setti, and the Navy in the Sugar
Bowl had a roster knee-deep in All 1
American material—Forrest Ander- j
son. Bob Davies, George Glamack,
etc.
