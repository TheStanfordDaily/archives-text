Engineering, Science, and Management War Training courses offered by
Stanford have been attended by (1.000 students since their inauguration in
1041, al! but 500 of these having been enrolled in the department during
1942,
Stanford is one of 200 universities over the United States (including lo-

cally, Santa Clara and California),

sorship of the U.S. Office of Educa
tion, these courses of college grade
intended for persons employed or
employable in war industries.
No Tuition

for living quarters for the women.
Plans are being made to house the
men in University dormitories if

mended a course in Elementary En
gineering Mathematics for women

satisfactory completion of each
course. Regularly enrolled Stanford
students are not admitted to the
courses unless they intend to go into
war industry employment or the
armed forces at the conclusion of a
course or shortly afterward and un
less they are not planning to enroll
in a college or university again dur
ing the next academic year.
A large number of the courses are
given in the evening and will not
conflict with regular classes. The
War Training Office has recom
mended a course in Elementary En
gineering Mathematics for women
students who wish a review of math
and an extension of their mathe
matics training preparatory to tak
ing full time programs (8-hour day,
10-15 weeks).
