						New Stanford Rough

### 
STANFORD is not a university of weaklings
or undernourished men. In fact, 20 per cent
Df the male students who took the physical
fitness test were in such excellent condition
that they might easily go into the commando
or paratrooper divisions which demand the
best physical condition.
Dr. A. A. Esslinger, director of the Division
of Physical Fitness Education, in the capacity
of special consultant to the War Department
developed the Army Physical Fitness Test and
discovered this fact. In developing this test he
checked more than 8,000 soldiers.
On a physical fitness test which is almost
dentical with that of the Army and which is
?h& most thorough given by any Pacific Coast
aniversity, it was discovered that the Stanford
man is much more physically fit than the av
erage civilian who is inducted into the Army.
Although 30 per cent of the students were
termed unfit for modern war, a 20 per cent im
provement in physical condition was noted for
♦he ten-week training period.
It is easy to see that the rough is rapidly be
coming really rough.
