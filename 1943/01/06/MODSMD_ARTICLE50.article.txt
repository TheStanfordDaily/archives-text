# Hashers Wanted!
## 
### 
7\ N article in The Daily today restates the
Jt\ acute labor shortage which the Union
Cellar and dining halls have been feeling in
creasingly during the last quarter.
Miss Christine Ricker, Director of Dining
Halls, issued a plea for more help with the
hope that "the students, having experienced un
comfortable conditions in the Cellar last quar
ter, will now realize the adversity of the situ
ation and will do something about it."
This situation is vastly different from the days
vvhen hashers hitchhiked into Paly twice a
day to work for their meals.
Hashing jobs are plentiful enough now so
that all who need to hash can do so with a
minimum of time spent in going to and from
the job.
The demand for hashers is becoming so
great that those who have never hashed before
should consider it seriously, not only as an
aid to themselves, but to the University as well.

New Stanford Men and Women
FOR the first time high school seniors have
been admitted into Stanford University
without diplomas.
We hope that they make themselves at home;
that they corne to enjoy and appreciate Stan
ford for all that it is worth; that they will be
happy; and that they will realize today they are
no longer high school seniors of outstanding
merit. They are men and women of Stanford.
With the countless name signing that is reg
istration, they assumed a new status in life—
that of being a member of the Stanford Family
and with it they were guaranteed certain obli
gations and given certain privileges.
On signing the bright orange card, they as
sumed both the advantages and the disadvan
tages of the Honor Code and promised to up
hold it.
On signing the study cards, they opened the
way to higher education. With this goes both
good and bad—the joys of knowledge; and
the responsibility of getting it—of being the
first, the trail-breakers for other high school

seniors. With these new Stanford men and
women rests the success of the University's
decision to admit students without a high
school diploma.
These new men and women will have been
deprived of some of the traditions of Stanford.
But more important than this is the part
of Stanford that they will become. What they
will give Stanford and what Stanford will give
them.
To the new Stanford men and women, the
ex-high school seniors, welcome. We are glad j
to have you.
