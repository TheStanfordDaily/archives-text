SCHOOL DURING WAR?
The Editor, Sir:
In reading the article "Should Youth Go to
School During the War?" this thought v/as
brought to mind.
There are many other things to learn be
sides Engineering and Medicine. Think of the
damage that this war will bring about. There
will be a great need for people to help these
conquered countries readjust themselves after
the war is finished. There will be people to
feed and clothe, new forms of government to
set up, and many other such jobs. That is the
reason for our going to college.
We will have to build many new buildings
to replace the ones that have been bombed,
we will have to cure the diseases that have
afflicted the countries under Nazi domination.
To those who have asked so many times: why
are we going to college and what good will
it do to study, this is the answer. There will be
many readjustments to be made in this coun
try to assure the fact that this peace will be a
lasting one.
We will need to make many changes in our
social system so that we may live at peace with
the rest of the world. We have many prob
lems to*face: what will we do with Germans,
Italians, and Japanese after this mess is cleared
up; what will be the needed changes in our
economic system; what changes will be needed
in our social system?
W r e don't need to know just how to be en
gineers, doctors, scientists, but we need to
know the right steps to take tp make this peace
stick, and not become the brewing pot of an
other world war. It will be up to this genera
tion in college now to assure that our children
and theirs to follow will not see the situations
that we face today.
