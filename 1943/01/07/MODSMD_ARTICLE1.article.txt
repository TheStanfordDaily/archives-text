## SHORTAGE Treasury Calls In Small Coins 
### 
Pennies and nickels hoarded in the
piggy banks and pockets of Stanford J
students were called back to circu- j
lation by the Treasury Department
as a move to reclaim the strategic J
copper and nickel they contain.
Mint officials estimated that 4,600
tons of copper, enough for 1,250,000
shells for field guns, were used in !
pennies made last year, as well as
sizeable supplies of tin and zinc, all
needed for war production.
Students were requested to trade j
their pennies and nickels for coins j
of larger denominations and to urge j
their families and friends to do like- ]
wise. No outright donation of the !
coins was asked.
Although it was expected that
Congress would authorize a change
in the content of the penny as it has j
of the nickel, substitute materials i
were declared to fce hardly less j
scarce.
Increased demand for the small 1
coins, caused by state sales taxes,
federal excise taxes, vending ma
chines, and other factors, has in- j
creased the need for them in spite
of the materials shortage.
