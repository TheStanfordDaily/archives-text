# NEW CONGRESS
## Texas Democrat Rayburn Chosen for House Speaker 
### 
WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (U.R).— I The
Seventy-eighth Congress—dedicated
by its leaders to uncompromising
victory in the global war against the
Axis but sharply divided on political
and domestic issues — convened at
noon today and the house re-elected
Democrat Sam Rayburn of Texas as
speaker.
Taking the rostrum after defeating
Republican Leader Joseph W. Mar
tin, Jr., of Massachusetts, 217 to 206
in the closest speakership vote since
1931. Rayburn told the new Congress
it will have the "most important
session since Washington's time."
"This must not be a war without
victory but a war with victory," he
said. "There must be no stopping
until the vandalism of Rome, Berlin
and Tokyo is wiped from the earth.
Civilization cannot stand another
war like this."
Martin, leader of enlarged forces
nearly equal to Democratic member
ship for the first time in a decade,
underscored Rayburn's plea.
Victory Congress
"The last session was known as the
War Congress," he said. "This will
be the Victory Congress. Victory is
our common goal. As leader of the
opposition I pledge us toward that
end. There will be no division so
far as winning the war is concerned."
Rayburn announced his "unwaver
ing determination to protect and de
fend the rights and prerogatives and
power of the House of Representa
tives."
Unflinching Fight
Martin, charting the Republicans'
course, echoed Rayburn by pledging
the minority party to an unflinching
fight against "arrogant bureaucracy."
The independent mood of Congress
coupled with the imposing strength
of the Republican delegations in both
House and Senate constitute the
stiffest challenge to President Roose
velt in his entire White House
career.
President Speaks
His state of the Union message, to
be delivered to Congress in person
at 12:30 p.m. EWT tomorrow, is ex
pected to mirror his recognition of
this test.
He has had advance warning that
the Congress is bent on severe gov
ernment economy, independent ac
tion for equitable taxation, a larger
voice in the conduct of the war and
the planning of the peace, and strict
examination of all new attempts to
win for the executive branch more
blanket powers in the name of the
war effort.
Rayburn's re-election came on
his 61st birthday, and a score of
House members broke out spon
taneously at one point with "Happy
birthday, Dear Speaker."

Sen. t Pat McCarran (D., Nev.),
served notice that if legislation to
permit the sale of silver for consump
tive use is reintroduced he will fili
buster as he did last session. He
said he would give his colleagues a
week's warning and read "Gone
with the Wind."
The 1942 general elections aligned
the new Congress as follows:
House—Democrats 222; Republi
cans 208; American Labor 1; Pro
gressives 3; vacancy 1.
Senate—Democrats 37. Republi
cans 38; Progressive 1.
The Democrats' slim edge of only
10 votes more than a bare majority
in the House is not considered an
adequate working margin.

The 1942 general elections aligned
the new Congress as follows:
House—Democrats 222; Republi

WASHINGTON, Jan. 6 (U.R).— I The
Seventy-eighth Congress—dedicated
by its leaders to uncompromising
victory in the global war against the
Axis but sharply divided on political
and domestic issues — convened at
noon today and the house re-elected
Democrat Sam Rayburn of Texas as
speaker.
Taking the rostrum after defeating
Republican Leader Joseph W. Mar
tin, Jr., of Massachusetts, 217 to 206
in the closest speakership vote since
1931. Rayburn told the new Congress
it will have the "most important
session since Washington's time."
"This must not be a war without
victory but a war with victory," he
said. "There must be no stopping
until the vandalism of Rome, Berlin
and Tokyo is wiped from the earth.
Civilization cannot stand another
war like this."
Martin, leader of enlarged forces
nearly equal to Democratic member
ship for the first time in a decade,
underscored Rayburn's plea.
Victory Congress
"The last session was known as the
War Congress," he said. "This will
be the Victory Congress. Victory is
our common goal. As leader of the
opposition I pledge us toward that
end. There will be no division so
far as winning the war is concerned."
Rayburn announced his "unwaver
ing determination to protect and de
fend the rights and prerogatives and
power of the House of Representa
tives."
Unflinching Fight
Martin, charting the Republicans'
course, echoed Rayburn by pledging
the minority party to an unflinching
fight against "arrogant bureaucracy."
The independent mood of Congress
coupled with the imposing strength
of the Republican delegations in both
House and Senate constitute the
stiffest challenge to President Roose
velt in his entire White House
career.
President Speaks
His state of the Union message, to
be delivered to Congress in person
at 12:30 p.m. EWT tomorrow, is ex
pected to mirror his recognition of
this test.
He has had advance warning that
the Congress is bent on severe gov
ernment economy, independent ac
tion for equitable taxation, a larger
voice in the conduct of the war and
the planning of the peace, and strict
examination of all new attempts to
win for the executive branch more
blanket powers in the name of the
war effort.
Rayburn's re-election came on
his 61st birthday, and a score of
House members broke out spon
taneously at one point with "Happy
birthday, Dear Speaker."

Sen. t Pat McCarran (D., Nev.),
served notice that if legislation to
permit the sale of silver for consump
tive use is reintroduced he will fili
buster as he did last session. He
said he would give his colleagues a
week's warning and read "Gone
