# RED-TAPE
## Rationing Stamp Headaches Hit Accounting Department 
### 
Over 3,000 rationing books owned
by patrons of Stanford dining halls
and eating clubs have added up to
a "thankless policing job" for the
University's accounting department,
and more red-tape trouble may be
ahead with increasingly stringent
restrictions on wartime purchasing,
according to Frank Walker, Finan
cial Vice-President.
To the staff of Lee L. Y;uicey, head
accountant, the ration stamps are
just another hurdle to lick. Because
Stanford as an institution buys its
coffee and sugar under a government
regulation which permits mass pur
chase of a certain quota of previous
consumption, student stamps are
never used in actual buying.
But another regulation requires
that any person taking 12 or more
consecutive meals at a certain place
surrender his book.
At the accounting department,
however, the collected books must
be deposited in a locked file, record
ed, and guarded like bullion. When
a certain series of rationing stamps
become outdated, staff tongues de

posit the thousands of stamps on
gummed sheets, whence they arrive
at the Palo Alto rationing headquar
ters.
With this wartime administrative
"extra," the accounting department
has inherited assorted laughs and
grouches. One mother refused or was
unable to send her son's book, but
she sent her heir to Stanford
equipped with six pounds of sugar.
With rationing of many other food,
clothing, and general items probably
on the way, the accounting depart
ment will find it "nearly impossible''
to handle the books, unless separate
books are issued for each com
modity.
Seemingly no alternative appears
except to have the student sign out
for his book at each purchase, which
means inevitable lost coupons, or,
possibly, a mass trip to the clothiers
for all of Stanford, led by harried
bookkeeper Yancey, when war wears
student soles thin.
