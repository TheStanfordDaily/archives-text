# Farm Women Aid War Effort And Join WAVES, WAACS
## 
### 
[ When 13 women were admitted for
! the first time in history to the Coast
| Guard Academy of the United States
I at New London, Conn., as members
| of SPARS, it was not known defi
! nitely whether any one of them
! could qualify as a member of the
Stanford Family.
And, so far there is no report of
a Stanford WAAF. But if the re
j sponse of our women to the ranks of
j the WAVES and WAACS is an indi-
I cation, the Farm will soon be repre
• sented in these two newer auxiliary
j branches of the service.
Maybe it's the glamour of wearing
a uniform, maybe it's the fulfillment
of a desire to get in and pitch with
I the Army or the but whatever
! their motive, Stanford women have
I shown a marked desire to do their
I part.
An incomplete report at the middle
of Fall Quarter listed 10 Stanford
WAVES and 5 Stanford WAACS.
Since then a still incomplete list
names 27 WAVES and 10 WAACS.
When complete reports are made the
Dean's Office estimates that the num
ber will be doubled again.
