# REG DANCE
## Profit Cancels Boathouse Debt 
### 
More than enough profit ot cancel
the boathouse debt to the University
was gained by the Reg Dance Tues
day night. Bill Moran, student man
ager, estimated yesterday.
Any excess funds will go to a boat
house improvement fund, he said.
Net profit was between $140 and
$200.
Jack Reynolds, dance chairman,
judged that more than 400 couples
danced to recorded music in the
Women's Gym. making the dance one
of the most successful ever held dur
ing Winter Quarter and almost
measuring up to last fall's attendance.
Assisting with decorations, refresh
ments, and other arrangements for
the dance, which was sponsored by
Cardinals, were Pauline Holcomb,
John Finch, Bruce Meyer, Louis
Sloss, Carl Livingston, and Georgi
ana Fitzgerald, and freshmen women
who sold tickets on Registration Day.
The first edition of Shakespeare's
