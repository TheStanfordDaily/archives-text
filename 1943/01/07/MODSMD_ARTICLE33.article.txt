## Stanford Graduate Devises New Means to Rescue Fliers 
### 
Major Don D. Flickinger, Army
flight surgeon and graduate of Stan
ford Medical School in has been
transferred to Mather Field in Sac
ramento after two and a half years
at Wheeler Field in Hawaii. While
at Wheeler, Major Flickinger gained
wide popularity among all the men
and officers.
Major Flickinger is known best for
his efforts to make flying safer for
Army pilots. He has over 800 hours
in the air himself and works con
stantly developing methods of meas
uring resistance to blackout and
making new tests of pilot ability.
New Dye
He has introduced a dye for pilots
to carry and open if they land in
water. This dye will discolor the
water so that rescue planes will sight
the pilots from a distance of five
miles. Major Flickinger has been
dropped out in the water and spent
hours waiting to be picked up in
order to test his new methods of
rescue.
Many pilots owe their lives to the
courage and industry of the flight
surgeon who can do (and does) all
the things his men must do. Last
spring Major Flickinger was the first
to make a parachute jump along with
.11 enlisted men from the parachute
department.
Flight Surgeon
In September 1941 Major Flick
inger was selected as the flight sur
geon for the pioneer flight of a
squadron of B-17's to the Philip
pines. For this action he was
awarded the Distinguished Flying
Cross. On December 7 the major
was on the job with his men at
Wheeler Field while Jap bombs were
falling.

After graduating from Stanford
Medical School in 1932, Major Flick*
inger specialized for two years in
internal medicine and cardiology at
Vanderbilt University Hospital in
Nashville, Tenn.

Entering the service in 1934, he
qualified as fight surgeon in 1937 a ; ;
Randolph Field, Texas. In 1941 Ma
jor Flickinger was elected to the
