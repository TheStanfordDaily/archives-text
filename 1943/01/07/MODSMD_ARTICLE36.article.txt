Things are starting to pop on the
baseball front, and their effect may
s.eriously hamper the quality of ball
to be played in the big leagues this
season.
The night before last Joe Di Mag
gio dropped a hint to a telephone in
terviewer when he said, "Spring
training won't concern me this
year." He did not elaborate fur
ther. Perhaps the most famous son
of the San Francisco crab fisherman
is goins; into the service, following
such piesent-day greats of Amer
ica's pastime as Ted Williams, Sam
Chapm; n, Red Ruffing, Hank
Greenb. rg, Bob Feller, and his little
brother Dom.
The other item of interest comes
from Commissioner Kenesaw M.
Landis, stating: "All clubs will
train either in their home city or
as near there as possible."
This may injure the players, and
the type of game that they play.
Naturally, it is the only patriotic
thing to do, and their transporta
tion should he cut down as much
as possible. But a report read that
some of the clubs are trying to
block a cut in the total number of
games for the season, and also
opposing a late opening.
Training at home instead of the
sunny climes of California, Texas,
and Florida will hurt such teams as
Boston. A little bean from that city
told me that there is nothing but
cold weather and rain there, so the
training season will be shortened by
acts of God. You can't expect a
pitcher to throw his best curve or
burning fast ball unless he is in
tip-top shape, and he certainly
won't get into shape playing in the
rain.

To date, our basketball team has
not been showing too much. By
showing much, I mean not winning
many games. To be correct, they
have won but one game this season
—that a 46-44 triumph over Santa
Clara.
But don't be downhearted. We
have lost to (he best teams in the
nation. Any team that has Hank
Luisetti on it is a good team, and
St. Mary's Pre-Flight has him.
Therefore, the Pre-Flight team is
good.
Then we dropped our Sugar
Bowl game to Great Lakes Naval
Training Station. This team has
nothing hut All-Americans on it.
They have so many AH-Ameri
cans that George Glamack, the
wonder hoy from North Carolina
who broke Luisetti's scoring mark,
doesn't even rate a starting po
sition.
On the; return trip we stopped off
and got beat by the "Whiz Kids" of
the University of Illinois. These fel
lows won the Big Ten championship
.'ast year, and beat Great Lakes, 57-
53, when the latter was en route to
New Orleans.
So things really aren't too bad,
and we should win our share of the
games. But to win the Southern
Division title three years in a row
is a big order. U.S.C. did very well
on its swing through the East, and
looked like the tops in the confer
ence.
California is improving fast. Nibs
Price is apparently teaching his
green team an awful lot of basket
ball. U.C.L.A. looks impotent as
ever.
Among (he Independents, U.S.F.
can't he taken lightly, for they
tripped up Santa Clara. St. Mary's
has a strong club too.
So the outlook for the season is
a big mixup. U.S.C. is hot at the
present time. Stanford has lost
Bill Cowden, Don Burness, and
Jim Pollard from an NCAA cham
pionship team. Cal is improving.
The Independents look good. The
service teams are great.
It would be hard to pick a top
team, but (ho basketball fan can be
certain (hat he is going to see a lot
of good basketball, and whatever
your favorite team is, it is bound to
get knocked over somewhere along
the line.
