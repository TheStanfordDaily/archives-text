# 16 Major League Clubs Are in Dither Over Finding Spring Training Sites
## Baseball Chiefs Cast Aside Calif. Camps 
### 
NEW YORK, Jan. (> (UP).—The
lfi major league clubs went all-out
in the big hunt for ersatz spring
training camps today.
From St. Loo —habitat of the
Browns and Cards on the banks of
OF Man River—to Boston's frigid
Common, the baseball brass hats
sought conditioning sanctuaries near
home for their surviving athletes—
sanctuaries, indoors or out, to re
place those in Florida, Texas and
California where they have been ac
customed to work out the kinks.
This hunt was bounded by the
lines set at Tuesday's Chicago meet
ing of club owners—north of the
Ohio and Potomac rivers and east
of the Mississippi river, excepting,
of course, the St. Louis clubs, which
may condition any place in Missouri.
When the first day's dust settled
upon the scramble only four clubs
had decided definitely upon their
training sites. At Detroit, the Tigers'
general manager, Jack Zeller, an
nounced that the Bengals would do
their training at Bosse Field. Evans
ville, Ind., starting March 15. Mean
while the two Chicago clubs —the
Cubs and White Sox — announced
that they definfyely would condition
at French Lick, Ind., even though
they had decided upon the Tufts
College cage, Medford, Mass.
Elsewhere all was chaos: even in
the usually ordered precinct of
Branch Rickey, president of the
Brooklyn Dodgers. Prexy Branch
said he was virtually certain that the
Dodgers could train at New Haven,
Conn., in the Yale U. field house.
Rickey understood that the Army
aviation had decided not to take
over the field house. But Ogden
Miller, chairman of the Yale Ath
letic Association, told the United
Press that the Army student fliers
are virtually certain to take over the
field house.
Meanwhile the other two merto
politan clubs—the Yankees and the
Giants—were scurrying around New
Jersey, seeking sites. The Giants'
manager, Mel Ott, came up from
New Orleans to join the hunt. The
Yanks were considering three Jer
sey spots: Atlantic City, Wildwood
by-the-Sea, and Asbury Park. The
Giants were considering those three
and an overnight entry, Lakewood,
N.J.
Sam Breadon, owner of the world
champion St. Louis Cardinals, said,
"There's a possibility we may settle
on Springfield, Mo., because there is
a park available." William DeWitt
of the St. Louis Browns said his lads
migh ttrain "right at home."
The situation as to other clubs
follows: Cincinnati Reds—have no
idea; their own park is under water.
Washington Senators—won't know
for a day or so, now that South
Carolina is out. Pittsburgh Pirates
—completely up in the air. Boston
Braves—angling for the field house
at Phillips Academy, Andover, Mass.
Cleveland Indians—considering field
houses at Marietta, Wittenberg and
Ohio University, and the Indianapo
lis Association park.
