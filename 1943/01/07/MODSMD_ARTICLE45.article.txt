## Son Cuts Fancy Capers on Ice to Equal Father's Fame 
### 
CHICAGO, Jan. 6 (U.R).—Willie
Ritchie cut fancy capers in the ring
while winning the world's light
weight boxing championship and to
day his son is on his way to gaining
equal fame as a figure skater.
The skater in question is Geary
Steffen, Jr., the skating partner of
the ice's glamor girl, Sonja Henie, in
a rink revue now playing here and
which has engagements scheduled at
Detroit and New York before head
ing for Hollywood and movie work.
Willie Ritchie merely is a name
adopted for ring purposes by the
elder Steffen who is now chief in
spector for the California Boxing
Commission.
Young Geary had ambitions to fol
low in the footsteps of his famed
father as a boxer, but parental ob
jections stifled those hopes and he
had to turn to another line of ath
letic endeavor to win acclaim.
When he was 14 years old Geary
won a city amateur championship at
San Francisco in the 93-pound divi
sion. Shortly after taking the title he
pulled a "Tunney" and retired as the
unbeaten ruler of the division.

"Although he'd been a boxer D;.d
I didn't look with favor upon my light
ing either as an amateur or profes
| sional," Geary said. "He instructed
me i>n some - fine points of the game
simply so 1 would be' able to protect
myself and then told me to give up
boxing."
Now 19 years old, Geary never
skated until three years ago. "When
| my family moved from San Fran
cisco to Los Angeles I was lonely
I because I knew only a few people."
j he recalled. "There was an ice rink
near our home and I took to hang
; ing around there. Naturally I be-
I came interested and finally got a
| job working around the place.
"The fellows around the rink be
gan to show me things about skating
, and then I set about to putting my
| self through long daily practices. I
don't think my development was es
pecially unusual because 1 believe
; anyone who'll practice faithfully can
accomplish the same thing."
Geary's modesty is too great on
that point for his quick mastery of

weight boxing championship and to
day his son is on his way to gaining
equal fame as a figure skater.
The skater in question is Geary
Steffen, Jr., the skating partner of
the ice's glamor girl, Sonja Henie, in
a rink revue now playing here and
which has engagements scheduled at
Detroit and New York before head
ing for Hollywood and movie work.
Willie Ritchie merely is a name
adopted for ring purposes by the
elder Steffen who is now chief in
spector for the California Boxing
Commission.
Young Geary had ambitions to fol
low in the footsteps of his famed
father as a boxer, but parental ob
jections stifled those hopes and he
had to turn to another line of ath
letic endeavor to win acclaim.
When he was 14 years old Geary
won a city amateur championship at
San Francisco in the 93-pound divi
sion. Shortly after taking the title he
pulled a "Tunney" and retired as the
unbeaten ruler of the division.

"Although he'd been a boxer D;.d
I didn't look with favor upon my light
ing either as an amateur or profes

me i>n some - fine points of the game
simply so 1 would be' able to protect
myself and then told me to give up
boxing."
Now 19 years old, Geary never
skated until three years ago. "When
| my family moved from San Fran
cisco to Los Angeles I was lonely
I because I knew only a few people."
j he recalled. "There was an ice rink
near our home and I took to hang

I came interested and finally got a

"The fellows around the rink be
gan to show me things about skating
, and then I set about to putting my
| self through long daily practices. I
don't think my development was es
pecially unusual because 1 believe
; anyone who'll practice faithfully can
accomplish the same thing."
Geary's modesty is too great on
that point for his quick mastery of
