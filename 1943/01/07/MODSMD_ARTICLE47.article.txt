LAST night the men from Encina walked out
of their hall and up the Row and got their
first taste of rushing and their first legal view
of the inside of a fraternity house since they
came to Stanford.
This taste of rushing and view of the interior
of the various houses may be the last for some
time, because according to Lee Peake "the en
tire rushing setup may be changed."
The possibility of the reserve classifications
being called up and the nearness of the war
with the 'teen-age draft have changed the pic
ure of fraternities very much since the begin
ling of the quarter.
Ihe fraternities like the rest of civilian life
are adapting themselves to the war. The
changes in the rushing program are ample
proof of this.
Those freshmen who are interested in join
ng a fraternity should go up the Row during
he open houses and see as many of the houses
as possible. He should give them all a chance
and then make his own decision.
More important than this are his studies. The
.freshman can no longer afford to spend all
night in bull sessions as to the various merits
of the different houses. They are in college on
oorrowed time which they must repay with
interest.
