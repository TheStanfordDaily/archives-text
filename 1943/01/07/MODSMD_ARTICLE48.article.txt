YESTERDAY'S Daily ran a caption about the
death of Dr. George Washington Carver,
aged Negro scientist.
Some people come to symbolize things.
When I was a little boy, George Washington
Carver always symbolized hope and freedom.
Born as a slave during the Civil War, he
raised himself up by his own energy. He did
much for humanity and much for the Negroes
of the South by his work with plants and es
pecially soy beans.
The death of George Washington Carver in
a way is like the tearing down of the Sixth Ave
nue Elâ€”the passing of a landmark of an age.
