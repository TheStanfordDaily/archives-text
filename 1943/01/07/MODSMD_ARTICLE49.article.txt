# Stanford's Ratio
## 
### 
DIMMING hopes of Stanford women for a
happy quarter this winter shone anew this
morning as a flood of men registering late
checked the nose-diving men-to-women ratio
and forced it up once again until it now ap
proaches the Autumn Quarter figure.

The once-proud ratio dropped to 1.60 at
the conclusion of Tuesday's registration and
the future seemed dark to those Farm women
who could recall the happy days of 2 and even
3 to 1. But 120 valiant males leaped into the
breach yesterday and forced it up to 1.65, half
way up to the 1.7 mark of last quarter. And

Stanford women, poignant little faces looking
heavenward with a new anticipation, are pray
ing dutifully every night for more of the same.
