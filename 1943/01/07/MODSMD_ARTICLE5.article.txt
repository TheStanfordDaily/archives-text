# RUSHING
## New Program May he Planned 
### 
Interfraternity Council will meet
at 5 p.m. today in the Nitery to de
cide the fate of Stanford's 1943 war
time rushing program. Sitting in on
the meeting with the fraternity
presidents will be house managers
and rushing chairmen.
Probable changes include elimina
tion of some or all rush meals and
a possible shortening of the 212-
week-long schedule. The need for
revising the program set up last fall
was caused by a shortage of labor
in fraternity kitchens and has been
accentuated by the food shortage.
Since no change is expected in
the schedule for tonight's open
houses, the frosh will again roam
the Row seeing what the inside of
the Farm's 24 fraternities looks like.
Last night the freshmen, minus 105
of their members on probation who
are ineligible for rushing, took their
first look at Stanford's fraternity
setup.
There was no indication that un
certainty of wartime conditions had
resulted in a slackening of interest
in the rushing program. The frosh,
apparently heeding Dean of Men
John Bunn's advice to see as many
organizations as possible during
these open house periods, crowded
all 24 houses and the flow of traffic
between fraternities was rapid.
There were, of course, the usual
comic sidelights of frosh wandering
into sorority houses and standing on
fraternity front steps ringing un
connected doorbells.
