# On-Campus Dances
## 
### 
TUESDAY night's highly successful Reg dance
was important—it marked a real change in
the campus attitude toward social conditions in
wartime. It proved that inexpensive on-campus
entertainment has finally arrived.
Many persons walked to the dance, they
danced to records, they didn't pay much money
but 450 couples of them still had a good time.
War has finally forced Stanford to lose its for
mer sophisticated nose elevation to things in
expensive and proved that we can have a good
time at simple campus functions.
The autumn Reg dance was also inexpensive
and well attended, but then almost all autumn
Reg dances have been successful. In compari
son, some of the past Winter Quarter Reg
dances have reminded students vaguely of
certain stretches of the upper Sahara Desert.
Light attendance has been the rule and not the
exception. But Tuesday night's affair reversed
the trend.
Cardinal Jack Reynolds was frankly surprised
at the way Stanford students turned out for the
dance. The available supply of tickets was
exhausted in the morning and couples stood
15 minutes to half an hour to buy them at the
door. Dance receipts retired the Boathouse debt.
"This was the cheapest Reg dance ever put
on . . . our only real cost was in renting the
gym and getting the music," Reynolds added.
"It shows that we can get a good crowd and
have a good time at an inexpensive dance on
campus."
Excom first stated its social policy of on
campus dances almost a year ago—too soon
for campus attitude to be favorable. But events
since then have proved that it is not only de
sirable but absolutely necessary to keep social
functions on campus and inexpensive.
Like gas rationing and food rationing, it meant
that some of the comforts and luxuries of the
past are gone for the duration. Excom won
dered when the campus would realize this.
And if Tuesday's dance is typical, the Stan
ford student body has shown that it has real
ized. They have shown a willingness to accept
the situation before them and have a good time
under restricted conditions. If this excellent
co-operation is maintained, the biggest barrier
to a successful though restricted social pro
gram is removed. Now it remains for Excom,
Cardinals, and other organizations to give us
well-timed, inexpensive campus entertainment.

Cardinal Jack Reynolds was frankly surprised
at the way Stanford students turned out for the
dance. The available supply of tickets was
exhausted in the morning and couples stood
15 minutes to half an hour to buy them at the
door. Dance receipts retired the Boathouse debt.
"This was the cheapest Reg dance ever put
on . . . our only real cost was in renting the
gym and getting the music," Reynolds added.
"It shows that we can get a good crowd and
have a good time at an inexpensive dance on
campus."
Excom first stated its social policy of on
campus dances almost a year ago—too soon
for campus attitude to be favorable. But events
since then have proved that it is not only de
sirable but absolutely necessary to keep social
functions on campus and inexpensive.
Like gas rationing and food rationing, it meant
that some of the comforts and luxuries of the
past are gone for the duration. Excom won
dered when the campus would realize this.
And if Tuesday's dance is typical, the Stan
ford student body has shown that it has real
ized. They have shown a willingness to accept
the situation before them and have a good time
under restricted conditions. If this excellent
co-operation is maintained, the biggest barrier
to a successful though restricted social pro
gram is removed. Now it remains for Excom,
Cardinals, and other organizations to give us
well-timed, inexpensive campus entertainment.

TUESDAY night's highly successful Reg dance
was important—it marked a real change in
the campus attitude toward social conditions in
wartime. It proved that inexpensive on-campus
entertainment has finally arrived.
Many persons walked to the dance, they
danced to records, they didn't pay much money
but 450 couples of them still had a good time.
War has finally forced Stanford to lose its for
mer sophisticated nose elevation to things in
expensive and proved that we can have a good
time at simple campus functions.
The autumn Reg dance was also inexpensive
and well attended, but then almost all autumn
Reg dances have been successful. In compari
son, some of the past Winter Quarter Reg
dances have reminded students vaguely of
certain stretches of the upper Sahara Desert.
Light attendance has been the rule and not the
exception. But Tuesday night's affair reversed
the trend.
