# Farm Firemen Douse Blaze in Sequoia Room
## 
### BY NEWTON WISE 
Quick and efficient action by the Stanford Fire Department early yester
day morning stopped an unexplained blaze which gutted a fourth floor
Sequoia room, belonging to Grant Fletcher and Rol>ert Burwick, Med stu
dents. and threatened to spread to the entire floor. Three (ire trucks and 18
tiremen rushed to the lire which broke out at 7:59 a.m.

Both students were out. of the room
, at the time.
Flames spurting from the front
| windows caught the attention of
I girls from Ventura, and soldiers liv
j ing on the first floor of the hall. The
| soldiers fought the fire with cx
| tinguishers before the firemen ar
i rived.
Fire Chief John M. Marston said
| he is not certain just how the blaze
originated although he believes it
started in a waste basket near the
windows, and then spread to the
rest of the room.
Neither Burwick nor Fletcher had
I been smoking in the room. Burwick
J had left the room a half hour before
the fire, and Fletcher just 15 minutes
before.
The fire caused $500 damage to
the room itself, and burned six
I tables and chairs, a radio, type-
I writer, two bureaus, two desk lamps,
one floor lamp, a large floor rug, and
longing to the occupants. Burwick
also lost cyrite a bit of clothing.
Saved from the blaze were two
$500 microscopes which were sit
ting under desks and were untouched
by the flames.
A can of rubber cement, containing
ether and which was quite inflam
! mable, sitting on the window sill,
; split open due to the heat, and
sprayed nearby desks, quickly
spreading the fire.
I "We got the fire out just in time or
: we would have had a real blaze on
our hands," Mr. Marston stated.
The head janitor of the hall turned
in the alarm which came just as
shifts were changing at the firehouse.
thus enabling the entire fire crew
to answer the call.
