Stanford women are invited to
meet Dr. Ida S. Scudder, head of the
Union Medical College in Vellore,
South India, at an informal tea in
the lounge of the Women's Club
house today from 4 to 5 o'clock this
afternoon.
Scheduled to speak tonight in Palo
Alto, Dr. Scudder will give a brief
talk at the tea describing the work
of the college, which is located 80
miles from Madras in S*>uth India.
Its nursing school, medical college,
X-ray and radium department,
pharmacy school, out-patient clinic,
and village hospitals serve the vast
population of that area.
The meeting this afternoon was
arranged by Dean Mary Yost, Dr.
Eloise Jameson, and Mrs. Paul Op
penhiser.

As late as 1929, Englishmen have
been fined for including "No ques

Because dry air lets heat leak away
j much faster than does moist air.
desert air loses heat very rapidly
