# Afternoon Rush Plans Cut by Men
## 
### 
Interfraternity Council decided in
a special meeting yesterday to elim- j
inate afternoon rushing (2-5 p.m.) |
from the 1943 rushing program after j
voting down a motion to defer rush- 1
ing until Spring Quarter but made ,
no other change in the schedule.
The Council voted to retain both
lunch and dinner rush periods, leav- j
ing it to the individual fraternities j
to overcome food and labor short- j
ages however they can. A motion to
make all rush lunches "meatless" was !
also voted down.
Cuts Six Periods
The change in the program elimi
nates six regular rush periods. The
revision was made in response to the
feeling that rushing was taking too
much time from studies. It was de
cided to cancel this period since its
rushing value was the lowest.
The revision leaves only 12 regular
rushing periods, in addition to pref
erence dinners and tomorrow's open
houses. Regular periods now remain
ing are lunch and dinner on Tues
day, Wednesday, Friday, and Satur
day of next week, and Tuesday and
Thursday of the following week.
Preference dinners will be on Friday
night, Jan. 22, and formal pledging
will take place the following day.
Kiewit Appointed
The Council unanimously voted
Ralph Kiewit to fill a vacant position
on Interfraternity Council.
Lee Peake, Interfraternity presi
dent, pointed out that fines would be
levied for the pledging of freshmen
on probation but the Council took
no definite stand on whether these
men might be rushed or not.
It has not yet been determined
how rush bids for the regular periods
will be distributed to the frosh. The
campus post office is overtaxed and
the fraternities may vary their usual
procedui'e of mailing the invitations
to the freshmen. Possible substitutes
include distribution through Encina
sponsors or through a central office.
There will be no rushing tonight as
frosh and Row men take a night off
following open houses last night and
Wednesday night. Another open
house will be held tomorrow after
noon from 3-6 p.m.
