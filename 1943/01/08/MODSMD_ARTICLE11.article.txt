# Freshmen Grades Reach Low Level
## 
### 
One hundred five freshmen, more
than twice as many as in past quar
ters, have been placed on probation,
Dean John Bunn declared last night.
Speaking before an Encina meet
ing. Dean Bunn pointed out that
while outside influences and heavy
programs were partly to blame, the
student himself is mainly respon
sible for his scholarship.
