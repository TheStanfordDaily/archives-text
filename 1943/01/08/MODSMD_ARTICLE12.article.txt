# New Women To Get Bids On Saturday
## 
### 
All women registered for rushing
must pick up their invitations to the
first period in the Panhellenic office
on Saturday afternoon between L
and 2:30.
These invitations must be answered
and returned between 2:30 and 4 on
Saturday afternoon. The success of
the rushing plan depends upon the
cooperation of the new women in
picking up and returning invitations
within the designated time, accord
ing to Hank Wallace, head of Pan
hellenic.
There are four dates in the first
lushing period. The first date be
gins Saturday night at 7:30 and lasts
until 9 o'clock. The other three dates
follow from 3:30 to 5 Sunday after
noon, 7:30 to 9 Sunday night, and
7:30 to 9 on Monday evening.
To Be Informal
The first rushing period will be
very informal. Sports clothes will
be worn by both house girls and
rushees. Light refreshments such as
cokes or hot chocolate will be served
buffet style by the houses. The time
has been cut to IV2 hours.
Panhellenic Council requests the
cooperation of both Row and regis
tered women in creating an informal
rush season in keeping with present
conditions. Miss Wallace asks that
distraction from studies in time and
effort be as little as possible.
Panhellenic officers met with the
sponsors and directors of Lagunita,
Union, and Roble last night to in
struct them in all the changes in the
year's rushing schedule so that they;
can answer any questions new worn-*
en may wish to ask.
