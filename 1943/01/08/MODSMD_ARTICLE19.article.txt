# Head of Indian Medical School Lectures on Missionary Work
## 
### 
If it had not been for the work of
Dr. Ida Scudder, 18,135 people in
India would not have received needed
medical treatment. Speaking in the
Women's Clubhouse yesterday after
noon, she told of the amazing work
her hospital and medical school had
accomplished.
Women in India are so secluded
that although the country has one
of the highest disease rates in the
world, it is impossible for women to
receive medical treatment except
from women doctors.
In 1918 Dr. Ida, as she is called,
founded the Vellore Medical School
for Women in Southern India. Pre
viously, although born in India, she
had come to America to study.
Knew <if Hardships
Well acquainted with the hard
ships a medical missionary must face
in India, she swore that she would
not enter medicine. Then three
women died in one night because
she was not trained to aid them, and
her father was not permitted in the
house. "God came to me that night,"
she said. And Ida Scudder left to
study medicine.
She has been decorated twice by
the British government, and the gov
ernment recently asked her to raise
the requirements of her school to
train post graduate nurses for all of
India. In July 1942, Vellore was
affiliated with the university at
Madras and became Vellore Medical
'College.
Medical Practitioners
In India there have been two
classes of doctors: medical practi
tioners, who are trained after they
have completed high school, and
doctors who have received full medi
cal training. The Indian government
is working to abolish the medical
practitioners, and as a result Vel
lore must double in size to be able
to continue. Dr. Scudder is touring
the United States lecturing to raise
money for this project.
"It is wonderful, inspiring work,"
said Dr. Ida. "Our young girls are

as full of enthusiasm as college girls.
And in competition with the men in
the final examinations, it was one of
our Indian girls who won the gold
medal."

Medical Practitioners
In India there have been two
classes of doctors: medical practi
tioners, who are trained after they
have completed high school, and
doctors who have received full medi
cal training. The Indian government
is working to abolish the medical
practitioners, and as a result Vel
lore must double in size to be able
to continue. Dr. Scudder is touring
the United States lecturing to raise
money for this project.
"It is wonderful, inspiring work,"
said Dr. Ida. "Our young girls are

as full of enthusiasm as college girls.
And in competition with the men in
the final examinations, it was one of
our Indian girls who won the gold
medal."
If it had not been for the work of
Dr. Ida Scudder, 18,135 people in
India would not have received needed
medical treatment. Speaking in the
Women's Clubhouse yesterday after
noon, she told of the amazing work
her hospital and medical school had
accomplished.
Women in India are so secluded
that although the country has one
of the highest disease rates in the
world, it is impossible for women to
receive medical treatment except
from women doctors.
In 1918 Dr. Ida, as she is called,
founded the Vellore Medical School
for Women in Southern India. Pre
viously, although born in India, she
had come to America to study.
Knew <if Hardships
Well acquainted with the hard
ships a medical missionary must face
in India, she swore that she would
not enter medicine. Then three
women died in one night because
she was not trained to aid them, and
her father was not permitted in the
house. "God came to me that night,"
she said. And Ida Scudder left to
study medicine.
She has been decorated twice by
the British government, and the gov
ernment recently asked her to raise
the requirements of her school to
train post graduate nurses for all of
India. In July 1942, Vellore was
affiliated with the university at
Madras and became Vellore Medical
'College.
