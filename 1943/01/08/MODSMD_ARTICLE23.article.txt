# Hoopmen Gun S.C. for As Trip Glamor Lingers
## 
### 
Main activity for Stanford's varsity basketball players remains the
vpreaduig of the pood word about their marvelous treatment during the
vacation trip to New Orleans, as Woody Weir sends the 1942 national
champs through a practice session this afternoon in the Pavilion.
Coach Everett Dean is expected back Monday to put full steam behind

practice for the opening
game against U.S.C. here Jan. 15.
WELL ENTERTAINED
In New Orleans the players were
wined and dined by the Sugar Bowl
Committee with a tour of the city,
free show tickets, top-flight "South
ern" meals. The game with the
(Great Lakes Navy was followed by
te massive dinner party at the swank
Hotel Roosevelt, complete with Ted
Lewis' orchestra and sports celebri
ties of the Grantland Rice strata.
At Champaign, where the team
was again thrown off schedule by
train delay, arriving at 4 a.m., the
festivities were restrained to a tour
of the Illini campus. In Chicago a
ten-hour layover took most of the
squad on the rounds of relatives,
tourist spots, and the like.
Both games received top publicity
from Mid-Western sports pages.—
Stanford the national champs
against the Navy's best and the Big j
Ten's cream.
ODDS AND ENDS
Here are a few odds and ends of
squad sentiment about the trip
its outcome:
Great Lakes for all its All-Ameri
can set-up would have a tough time
against the West Coast's St. Mary's
Pre-Flight.
Stanford definitely was its old
set-'em-up self of 1942 in the last
half of the Champaign game, though
the first half was a sad story of
missed rebounds and general "cold
ness." The team feels that the con
ference race picture should not be
approached in any form of pessi
mism, even if fingers are crossed
as they should be before any opener.
Some other notes:
Cal opens the hoop year in P.C.C.
circles tonight against U.C.L.A.
CAL LOSES STAR
Chuck Hanger, last year's soph
sensation for Cal and called by Nibs
Price "the best thing in Cal basket
ball in years," has let it be known
that he goes to Uncle Sam and the
Army Jan. 25.
U.S.C. circles arc crowing long
fend loud about the successful trip to
[Madison Square Garden and points
east.
Stanford health is solid in gen
eral. Freddy Linari is on the last lap
with a troublesome boil, and Howie
Dallmar has sore feet.

squad on the rounds of relatives,
tourist spots, and the like.
Both games received top publicity
from Mid-Western sports pages.—
Stanford the national champs
against the Navy's best and the Big j
Ten's cream.
ODDS AND ENDS
Here are a few odds and ends of
squad sentiment about the trip
its outcome:
Great Lakes for all its All-Ameri
can set-up would have a tough time
against the West Coast's St. Mary's
Pre-Flight.
Stanford definitely was its old
set-'em-up self of 1942 in the last
half of the Champaign game, though
the first half was a sad story of
missed rebounds and general "cold
ness." The team feels that the con
ference race picture should not be
approached in any form of pessi
mism, even if fingers are crossed
as they should be before any opener.
Some other notes:
Cal opens the hoop year in P.C.C.
circles tonight against U.C.L.A.
CAL LOSES STAR
Chuck Hanger, last year's soph
sensation for Cal and called by Nibs
Price "the best thing in Cal basket
ball in years," has let it be known
that he goes to Uncle Sam and the
Army Jan. 25.
U.S.C. circles arc crowing long
fend loud about the successful trip to
[Madison Square Garden and points
east.
Stanford health is solid in gen
eral. Freddy Linari is on the last lap
with a troublesome boil, and Howie
Dallmar has sore feet.
Main activity for Stanford's varsity basketball players remains the
vpreaduig of the pood word about their marvelous treatment during the
vacation trip to New Orleans, as Woody Weir sends the 1942 national
champs through a practice session this afternoon in the Pavilion.
Coach Everett Dean is expected back Monday to put full steam behind

practice for the opening
game against U.S.C. here Jan. 15.
WELL ENTERTAINED
In New Orleans the players were
wined and dined by the Sugar Bowl
Committee with a tour of the city,
free show tickets, top-flight "South
ern" meals. The game with the
(Great Lakes Navy was followed by
te massive dinner party at the swank
Hotel Roosevelt, complete with Ted
Lewis' orchestra and sports celebri
ties of the Grantland Rice strata.
At Champaign, where the team
was again thrown off schedule by
train delay, arriving at 4 a.m., the
festivities were restrained to a tour
of the Illini campus. In Chicago a
ten-hour layover took most of the
squad on the rounds of relatives,
tourist spots, and the like.
