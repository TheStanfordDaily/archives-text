## Frosh Power Shown in Tilt 
### 
A spirited scrimmage against the
varsity reserves yesterday failed to
| shed any light as to who will make
up the first string frosh cage quin
tet, but did leave onlookers with the
impression that Woody Weir's boys
will at least measure up to year
j ling fives of the past.
The Papeese cavorted with their
: bigger brothers for more than an
hour, showing several flashes of of
, fensive brilliance although passing
1 and ball handling were not up to
! par.
Weir sent forwards Dave David
son and Hugh West, center Dick
; Berlin, and guards Bill Christiansen
J and Jack Coppage against the re
! serves at the outset.
Davidson, reputed to have com
piled a lti-points-a-game average at
Alhambra High, stood out, sinking
two field goals while turning in a
! strong floor performance. West
' looked good on fast breaks as did
j Berlin. Both Christiansen, former
Lowell player, and Coppage shone
on defense.

"Woody" Weir stopped playing
hide-and-go-seek with the Navy
on the one hand and his draft
board on the other, by yesterday
getting a deferment until March.
Classified 1-A, he had been trying
to get into the Navy. The defer
ment allows the yearling coach to
finish the season at his team's
helm.

Former All-Coast, forward from
Long Beach Poly A1 Fish, and Los
Angeles's Jack Davis sparked the
second quintet Weir used. Fish
dropped two one-handed push shots, I
while Davis intercepted several var
! sity passes.
Jack Higgins, ineligible at. present
but almost certain to be clear before
the game with Menlo J.C., January I
15, worked with Fish at forward, i
Bill Davidson worked at center and
Jerry Stanley paired with Davis at
I guard.
