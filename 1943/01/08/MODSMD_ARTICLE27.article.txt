# U.S. Net Star Gains Semis in Mexico Tourney
## Bill Talbert to Meet Ecuadorian in Finals 
### 
MEXICO CITY, Jan. 7 (UP).—
Bill Talbert, fifth-ranking U.S. ten
ins player, advanced to the semi
finals of the Pan American Tennis
Tournament here today by disposing
of Mexico's 1941 singles champion,
Eugenio Tapia, 6-2, 6-0, 6-1.
Francisco (Pancho) Segura, the
Ecuadorian star, also had little
trouble defeating Rolando Vega,
fourth-ranking Mexican player, 6-2,
6-1, 6-3.
VOLLMER LOSES
Gustavo Vollmer, veteran former
Davis Cupper from Cuba, who ap
parently played himself out yester
day when he was forced to go five
sets to defeat a comparative un
known from Mexico, today was an
easy victim for Armando Vega, pres
ent singles champion of Mexico, 6-2,
6-1, 6-2.
Jose Aguero, Cuban singles cham
pion, was unable to get plane pas
sage to Mexico City, and tournament
officials, after postponing his first
match 24 hours, finally awarded it
to his opponent, Angel Roldan, of
Mexico, on default. Roldan was de
feated today by Anselmo Puente, of
Mexico, 6-1, 6-0, 6-4.
TALBERT-SEGURA
Tomorrow's semi-finals bring to
gether Bill Talbert and Armando
Vega, and Anselmo Puente and Pan
cho Segura, with Talbert and Se
gura favored to go to the finals Sun
day.
Talbert did everything right in
defeating Tapia today. He was sel
dom in trouble, and consistently
outplayed the Mexican champion.
Segura held the spotlight again
today, slapping his two-handed un
orthodox, but effective, drive close
to the baselines and mixing in timely
chops and lobs that left Vega, who
is doubles champion of Mexico with
his brother Armando, flatfooted.
Vega showed flashes of good form,
but the steadiness of the chunky
little Ecuador star—who ranks third
in the U.S.—was too much for him.
Pauline Betz, U.S. women's singles

champion, while watching, the Se
gura-Vega match, declared, "He's '
amazing." Other tennis players
marveled at the steadiness and agil
ity of Pancho, who is apparently at
the peak of his game.
Four women's matches will be
played tomorrow. Miss Betz will I
meet her first opponent, Maria Tapia ;
de Roldan; Doris Hart, of the U.S.. j
meets Loly Villarello, Mexico; Au- i
rora Legorreta, Mexico, plays Ka- j
nette Nuncio, and Chelo Roldan, j
Mexico, meets Sofia Contreras, Mcx- '
ico.

In the only women's match today,

MEXICO CITY, Jan. 7 (UP).—
Bill Talbert, fifth-ranking U.S. ten
ins player, advanced to the semi
finals of the Pan American Tennis
Tournament here today by disposing
of Mexico's 1941 singles champion,
Eugenio Tapia, 6-2, 6-0, 6-1.
Francisco (Pancho) Segura, the
Ecuadorian star, also had little
trouble defeating Rolando Vega,
fourth-ranking Mexican player, 6-2,
6-1, 6-3.
VOLLMER LOSES
Gustavo Vollmer, veteran former
Davis Cupper from Cuba, who ap
parently played himself out yester
day when he was forced to go five
sets to defeat a comparative un
known from Mexico, today was an
easy victim for Armando Vega, pres
ent singles champion of Mexico, 6-2,
6-1, 6-2.
Jose Aguero, Cuban singles cham
pion, was unable to get plane pas
sage to Mexico City, and tournament
officials, after postponing his first
match 24 hours, finally awarded it
to his opponent, Angel Roldan, of
Mexico, on default. Roldan was de
feated today by Anselmo Puente, of
Mexico, 6-1, 6-0, 6-4.
TALBERT-SEGURA
Tomorrow's semi-finals bring to
gether Bill Talbert and Armando
Vega, and Anselmo Puente and Pan
cho Segura, with Talbert and Se
gura favored to go to the finals Sun
day.
Talbert did everything right in
defeating Tapia today. He was sel
dom in trouble, and consistently
outplayed the Mexican champion.
Segura held the spotlight again
today, slapping his two-handed un
orthodox, but effective, drive close
to the baselines and mixing in timely
chops and lobs that left Vega, who
is doubles champion of Mexico with
his brother Armando, flatfooted.
Vega showed flashes of good form,
but the steadiness of the chunky
little Ecuador star—who ranks third
in the U.S.—was too much for him.
Pauline Betz, U.S. women's singles

champion, while watching, the Se
gura-Vega match, declared, "He's '
amazing." Other tennis players
marveled at the steadiness and agil
ity of Pancho, who is apparently at
the peak of his game.
Four women's matches will be
played tomorrow. Miss Betz will I
meet her first opponent, Maria Tapia ;
de Roldan; Doris Hart, of the U.S.. j
meets Loly Villarello, Mexico; Au- i
