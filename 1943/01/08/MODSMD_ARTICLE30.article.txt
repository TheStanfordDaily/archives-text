# WAR DEATH
## Florida Tracks Close Gates 
### 
MIAMI, Fla., Jan. 7 (U.R)â€”This
winter capital of horse racing threw
in the towel today because of the
gas ration situation and Tropical
I Park closed down and Hialeah can
j celed its scheduled Jan. 13 opening.
Both parks are several miles from
the city and the operators decided
it was impossible to keep them go
i ing with virtually all automobiles
j sidelined by the latest government
j order.
What will happen to Whirlaway,
| leading money-winning Thorough
bred of all time, was not known by
his trainer, Ben Jones. Jones said
the big chestnut would continue
training at Hialeah until orders had
j been received from owner Warren
| Wright, now in Phoenix, Ariz.
It was the second year Whirly
j had been left at the post by war
] emergencies. Last winter, the
j mighty stretch-running Thorough
j bred was at Santa Anita in Califor
nia when that track was forced to
close.
There was no denying the sadness
J evinced at both Miami racing plants
j today as stable boys, jockeys, turf
j writers and track officials re-hashed
I the ban on pleasure driving.
But, overshadowing the gloom, the
predominant spirit of "we want to
I do our part" stood out like a beacon.
