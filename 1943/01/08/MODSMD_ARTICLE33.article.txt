# Hammett Tells of Proposed Revisions
## Constitution to Undergo Overhauling; Farm Votes On Amendments Jan. 26 
### 
To explain the proposed amendments to the A.S.S.U. Constitution which
will he voted upon Jan. 2<>. the revision committee, chairmaned by Boh
Hamnu '.t. lias issued a statement discussing the changes.
When war conditions make some change in student body government
necessary, a committee under Harry Morton, prepared a provisional re-

organization plan. The present re
vision committee has modified and
supplemented his suggestions.
According to the committee, the
following amendments are presented
as a workable plan for the duration
and not as a drastic revision. They
believe the greatest problem is con
cerned with the length of the term
of office.
Since four quarters of service im
poses an unfair burden and two
quarters are insufficient for experi
ence, a three-quarter term is the
choice of the committee. A plan has
been developed which provides for
such a term (including Summer
Quarter) and assures staggered
shifts, but which does not require a
summer election, when the enroll
ment is low.
Although representation on Ex
com on a class basis is apparently
outmoded, the committee decided to
retain the present method and titles
for convenience. The members now
are actually members at large be
cause the whole student body votes
for them. The division by units will
insure a cross section of the student
body on Excom.
The proposed amendments follow:
