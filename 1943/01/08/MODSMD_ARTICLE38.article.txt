GEORGE WASHINGTON SLEPT
HERE, now playing at the Stanford.
As long as I have known, there
has been no more entertaining bill
at the Stanford than is currently
showing.
•Now once again Hollywood scen
arists have not quite made the grade
in transforming a play into a movie.
(Dear Frosh: This is my pet peeve.)
But Hart and Kaufman's "George
Washington Slept Here" has geared
up a fresh angle, and it pays off in
laughs as a movie nearly as it must
have as a play.
It is my opinion that Ann Sheri
dan has never appeared better; and
that Jack Benny, who does all right,
is eclipsed by the caretaker for char
acter most funny.

"George's" gagsare neither as num
erous nor as swift as in "Girl
Trouble," but they hit harder.
It may surprise you that in spite
of Don Ameche and Billie Burke,
Joan Bennett is ynough for "Girl
Trouble," which, trivial but not trite,
is certainly comedy of (he cleverest.
And Alfred Newman has concocted
a musical score which is probably
the most sumptuous a comedy ever
enjoyed. And you won't beat Harold
Schuster's direction just every day.
Also ,a short, "Winter Calls," is one
of the finest of its class to take to the
screen since the leaves fell back
East. —Covey.
