# CHAIRS
## Toyon Receives New Year Gift 
### BY BILL ROSE 
Their arms are too short, their
backs are too straight, their legs are
I sturdy as bedposts, and they take
hours to get warmed up. No, it's not
the Stanford coeds. It's the new
j chairs in the rooms of Toyon Hall.
The chairs came all the way from
Tacoma, Wash., and are a sort of
New Year's present to the Toyon
men. Dean Stanley Sharp says their
installment is only a step in the gen
eral plan to make the men's halls
the most livable men's residences on
campus. New desks are also con
templated for Toyon and Branner,
, but they probably won't be installed
until after the war.
The new chairs are, of course, an
improvement; but a lew of the more
sentimental Toyon men shed a tear
or two on finding the dilapidated old
ones gone. At least you could carve
your name on them without feeling
any pangs of conscience.
