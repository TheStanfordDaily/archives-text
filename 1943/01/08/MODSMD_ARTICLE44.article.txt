# From an Isolated Precipice
## 
### 
ONCE in a while it doesn't hurt to sit back
and look at yourself and your environ
ment from an objective and isolated precipice.
Sometimes circumstances make it impossible
ior one to do anything but sit back and be ob
jective. We had this experience during Christ
mas vacation. We were in Chicago and, hav
ing many acquaintances amongst the student
oodies at Northwestern and Chicago Univer
sities, we decided to look some of these people
up in order to see how the war was affecting
those universities. The results were interest
ing, though a little appalling. And the results
made us very proud of Stanford.
It seems that very little is being done by the
students at those two supposedly progressive
educational institutions to adapt themselves to
wartime conditions, to do their little bits in
furthering the war effort.
It is true that there are on those two campuses
organizations for the relief of this or that or
for convincing students that we are in a war,
but in neither of those two great universities did
there seem to be any organization which was
actually getting to the students, which was ac
tually getting the idea across to the students
that war is a reality affecting everyone.
So the boys and girls at Northwestern still
race around in their snappy convertibles (as
long as their four gallons hold out) and the boys
and girls at Chicago still talk in airy intellectual
circles and neither group has yet (we believe)
come to the realization, as a group, that a war is
in progress.
All of which made us realize that Stanford
men and women, and administration, too, de
serve a couple of pats on the back. Oh, yes, a
lot of words have been thrown around in the
past year about "the ivory tower," but, looking
at it objectively, it came to us that Stanford has
done a pretty fine job in fighting the war on the
home front. A look at the Stanford War Board
statistics will demonstrate that.
But it isn't only statistics that demonstrate
fact. Attitude, also, is important, and it occurs to
us that the Stanford student body has actually
begun to realize that rampant isolationism is a
thing of the past— and that war's fingers are
long.—Bill Steif

up in order to see how the war was affecting
those universities. The results were interest
ing, though a little appalling. And the results
made us very proud of Stanford.
It seems that very little is being done by the
students at those two supposedly progressive
educational institutions to adapt themselves to
wartime conditions, to do their little bits in
furthering the war effort.
It is true that there are on those two campuses
organizations for the relief of this or that or
for convincing students that we are in a war,
but in neither of those two great universities did
there seem to be any organization which was
actually getting to the students, which was ac
tually getting the idea across to the students
that war is a reality affecting everyone.
So the boys and girls at Northwestern still
race around in their snappy convertibles (as
long as their four gallons hold out) and the boys
and girls at Chicago still talk in airy intellectual
circles and neither group has yet (we believe)
come to the realization, as a group, that a war is
in progress.
All of which made us realize that Stanford
men and women, and administration, too, de
serve a couple of pats on the back. Oh, yes, a
lot of words have been thrown around in the
past year about "the ivory tower," but, looking
at it objectively, it came to us that Stanford has
done a pretty fine job in fighting the war on the
home front. A look at the Stanford War Board
statistics will demonstrate that.
But it isn't only statistics that demonstrate
fact. Attitude, also, is important, and it occurs to
us that the Stanford student body has actually
begun to realize that rampant isolationism is a
thing of the past— and that war's fingers are
long.—Bill Steif
ONCE in a while it doesn't hurt to sit back
and look at yourself and your environ
ment from an objective and isolated precipice.
Sometimes circumstances make it impossible
ior one to do anything but sit back and be ob
jective. We had this experience during Christ
mas vacation. We were in Chicago and, hav
ing many acquaintances amongst the student
oodies at Northwestern and Chicago Univer
sities, we decided to look some of these people
up in order to see how the war was affecting
those universities. The results were interest
ing, though a little appalling. And the results
made us very proud of Stanford.
