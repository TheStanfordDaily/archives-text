# On Fire Departments

nPHiu Sequoia fire brought home again the
J. importance of the "fire house" as more

than the intramural football champions.
Last summer they successfully fought nu
merous grass fires. They faithfully put out the
cars that catch on fire. They fill and check the
! fire extinguishers on the campus. And then
1 too they answer the thoughtless false alarms.
They are always present at dances and ath
letic events to caution heedless smokers and
to insure the safety of the people at the gath- 1

| ering.
The speed with which they answered the call
j and extinguished the flames is ample proof that ;
| they are good.
Our fire department merits not only our praise j
j but also our co-operation.
