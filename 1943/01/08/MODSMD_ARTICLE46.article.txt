# No Rushing, Please
## 
### 
ACCORDING to the ruling of the Inierfra
ternity Council, lower division men who
are on probation are not eligible for either rush
ing or pledging.
At yesterday's meeting of the Interfraternity
Council it was announced that the formal
pledging of the 103 ineligible men would draw
heavy fines.
With the same breath it was announced that
rushing these men was a matter up to the indi
vidual houses, which is as much as giving it
the green light.
At best rushing is a hectic process for both
the fraternities and those being rushed. It does
not lend itself to quiet studying in either group.
In fairness to the 103 men on probation, they
should not be rushed. It is of the utmost im
portance to their continued stay at the Univer
sity, and indirectly to the greatest good for the
nation, that these men be given every oppor
tunity to study.
We should face the issue squarely. We should
not permit their being rushed.
