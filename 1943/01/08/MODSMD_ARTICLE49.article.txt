# Honolulu Flooded

HONOLULU, T.H., Jan. 7 (U.R)—
Honolulu has returned to normal
after a tremendous tropical rain
storm tied up traffic, blocked high
ways, tore up water and gas mains
and delayed work on some war
projects.
But the city took it in barefoot
stride. No casualties were reported
in the officially sanctioned announce
ment of the storm, delayed until
now by security regulations.
