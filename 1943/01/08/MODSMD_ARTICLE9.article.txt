QUARTERS, Australia, Friday, Jan.
3 (U.R) — Allied planes, attacking a
convoy of 10 Japanese ships off Lae,
New Guinea, Thursday, sank two
large transports and shot down 18
Japanese planes, a communique said
today.
Lae is 160 miles up the New
Guinea coast from the Buna sector
which Allied troops cleaned out over
the weekend alter a bitter six-month
campaign.
Send 14,000-tonner Down
A 14,000-ton transport, heavily
laden with troops, was sunk. An
other large transport, upon which
direct bomb hits were scored, burned
and sank. A third large transport
was hit directly by bombs. The at
tacks are continuing.
The convoy was the first to appear
and be attacked in the New Guinea
area since Mac Arthur's bombers sent
a force of two merchant men and
five warships scurrying off on Dec.
19 after sinking a light cruiser from
it off Madang near Vitiaz Strait,
about 30 miles northwest of Buna.
Rabaul Raid I)evastx»ting
The action also came on the heels
of reports still circulating that the
Japs were massing a huge fleet in
Rabaul, on New Britain Island 420
miles northeast of Lae, perhaps for
a new thrust of some kind. On Tues
day, American flying fortress and
Liberator bombers, in a devastating
raid against Rabaul, had sunk nine
and perhaps 10 Japanese ships.
The communique said the convoy
was approaching Lae, possibly in
dicating the Japs are trying to push
reinforcements into that stronghold
in anticipation of an Allied ground
assault now that Buna has been won.

The convoy was reported to in
clude two Japanese cruisers, four
destroyers and four transports.
