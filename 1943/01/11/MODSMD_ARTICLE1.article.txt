# 'Fortune' Surveys University Reserves
## 
### BY NOEL YOUNG 
(Editor's Note: The following is
an analysis of a survey conducted by
Fortune magazine on the position of
reserve college students in relation
to the war.)

The destiny of the 1,500 Stanford
students in deferment reserves to
day hangs in balance, and all are
wondering just what their fate will
be in the -next year.
Fortune magazine, in its December
issue, studied the predicament of
college students throughout the
country and quoted a college edi
torial as reflecting current student
attitude by opining that education
for war was being lost on college

campuscs "as conclusively as it was
on Bataan and Malaya."
Fortune analysts visited five repre
sentative American colleges and
sent questionnaires to another 27, in
cluding Stanford, and found that
while the overwhelming majority of
college youths were keen to fight
this war, they are stricken by a gen
eral confusion as how they can fight.
This dangerous attitude Fortune
laid in the Jap of the government for
not having promulgated a cohesive
and crystallized policy regarding
America's 1,250,000 university stu
dents. The point was evidenced by
the fact that while both President
Roosevelt and General Hershey had
told students that it was their "pa

triotic duty" to stay in college until
drafted, the draft boards had very
different ideas.
Their alternative was the defer
ment of reserves, but even these plans
didn't satisfy troubled consciences.
Another point was that the reserve
plans didn't give the students more
than an inkling of how they should
educate themselves for service. The
Navy, which required the most from
reservists, asked that they have a
year of trigonometry, another of
math and one of physics.
Early last January nearly 1,000
college administrators convened in
Baltimore, spoke lengthily, resolved
highly, and went home hopefully to
await a call to service. Six months

later many of them were back in
Baltimore again, angrily declaring:
"We deplore the continuing lack of
any adequate, coordinated plan for
the most effective utilization of
higher education toward winning the
war."
Several universities have grown
impatient waiting for a definite policy
from Washington, and have devised
one of their own. Yale, for example,
inaugurated a "Yale Plan" requir
ing every student to decide soon
after his registration whether he will
prepare himself for service in the
fighting forces, in a noncombatant
specialty, or in an essential industry.
In its college survey, Fortune
found that Stanford's 10.9 per cent

enrollment drop was average, and
that California had suffered the most
heavily among major universities in
withstanding a 20 per cent drop.
While Stanford's physics and
mathematics enrollment soared up*
ward 150 and 300 per cent, Califor
nia's statistics show only a 17 per
cent gain in mathematics, and 50 per
cent in physics.
Fortune summed up its survey by
saying that our system of higher
education will undergo great tem
porary changes, war can be only an
"episode" and that liberal education
which has survived "many wars in
the past, will survive the present,"
to use the words of Franklyn B.

to use the words of Franklyn B.
Synder,
(Editor's Note: The following is
an analysis of a survey conducted by
Fortune magazine on the position of
reserve college students in relation
to the war.)

The destiny of the 1,500 Stanford
students in deferment reserves to
day hangs in balance, and all are
wondering just what their fate will
be in the -next year.
Fortune magazine, in its December
issue, studied the predicament of
college students throughout the
country and quoted a college edi
torial as reflecting current student
attitude by opining that education
for war was being lost on college

campuscs "as conclusively as it was
on Bataan and Malaya."
Fortune analysts visited five repre
sentative American colleges and
sent questionnaires to another 27, in
cluding Stanford, and found that
while the overwhelming majority of
college youths were keen to fight
this war, they are stricken by a gen
eral confusion as how they can fight.
This dangerous attitude Fortune
laid in the Jap of the government for
not having promulgated a cohesive
and crystallized policy regarding
America's 1,250,000 university stu
dents. The point was evidenced by
the fact that while both President
Roosevelt and General Hershey had
told students that it was their "pa

triotic duty" to stay in college until
drafted, the draft boards had very
different ideas.
Their alternative was the defer
ment of reserves, but even these plans
didn't satisfy troubled consciences.
Another point was that the reserve
plans didn't give the students more
than an inkling of how they should
educate themselves for service. The
Navy, which required the most from
reservists, asked that they have a
year of trigonometry, another of
math and one of physics.
Early last January nearly 1,000
college administrators convened in
Baltimore, spoke lengthily, resolved
highly, and went home hopefully to
await a call to service. Six months

later many of them were back in
Baltimore again, angrily declaring:
"We deplore the continuing lack of
any adequate, coordinated plan for
the most effective utilization of
higher education toward winning the
war."
Several universities have grown
impatient waiting for a definite policy
from Washington, and have devised
one of their own. Yale, for example,
inaugurated a "Yale Plan" requir
ing every student to decide soon
after his registration whether he will
prepare himself for service in the
fighting forces, in a noncombatant
specialty, or in an essential industry.
In its college survey, Fortune
found that Stanford's 10.9 per cent

enrollment drop was average, and
that California had suffered the most
heavily among major universities in
withstanding a 20 per cent drop.
While Stanford's physics and
mathematics enrollment soared up*
ward 150 and 300 per cent, Califor
nia's statistics show only a 17 per
cent gain in mathematics, and 50 per
cent in physics.
Fortune summed up its survey by
saying that our system of higher
education will undergo great tem
porary changes, war can be only an
"episode" and that liberal education
which has survived "many wars in
the past, will survive the present,"
to use the words of Franklyn B.
