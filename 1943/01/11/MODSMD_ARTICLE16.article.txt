I imagine that when Angelo
"Hank" Luisetti first appeared on
the Stanford basketball scene the
scribes had a pretty hard time com
paring him with anything that they
had seen before. Perhaps they went
back to U.S.C.'s Lee Gutero, a very
fine basketball player indeed.
Hank set the standard, and if a
basketball player is to be great, he
must come up to, or even excel in
every department of the game like
Luisetti did.
A few years ago a boy at Lowell
High School broke Hank's Sail
Francisco scoring record. He was
hailed as the "Second Luisetti."

Like Luisetti, this San Francisco
boy came to Stanford. His natnc
was Donald liurness.
Burness was always high up in
Conference scoring, and one year he
was out, due to an injured knee.
Last year he was on Everett Dean's
NCAA Championship team. Sport
writers, after claiming that Don was
Luisetti's equal, quickly forgot about
it when they thought that he couldn't
match Hank's standards.
James Pollard
Then came along a "Great as Lui
setti" in James Pollard. Pollard led
his frosh squad, and he too played on
the NCAA Championship team. But
Jimmy left school after Summer
Quarter to go into the service.
Finally THE Luisetti and the
"Great as Luisetti" met up on the
hardwood. Hank is now wearing the
jersey of the St. Mary's Pre-Flight,
and Jim the jersey of the U.S. Coast
Guard.
Some boring statistics from Satur
day night's game shows Luisetti,
playing on the winning team, making
eight field goals. Pollard made nine,
though. Both sank four free throws.
By rapid calculation, you find that
Pollard outscored Luisetti by two
points, or one field goal, or two free
throws.
Pollard Missed Four
Some may say that although Jim
outscored Hank, he missed four free
tosses to Luisetti's one. Some critics
will claim that if a player can't make
tree throws, he's no basketball player
at all. We'll let that go without
argument.
Luisetti is supposed to have the
advantage in that he has played so
much more basketball than Pol
lard, plus the experience gained
making "Campus Confessions"
under the Kleig lights for Holly
wood. But the reverse of that
argument is that Pollard has the
advantage of youth.
I'm not going to be crazy enough to
say which is the better player. Lui
setti or Pollard. This is war time,
and a person shouldn't start schisms
among a big happy family, like the
Stanford Family. Both are our boys,
and we love 'em. Let the monkeys
at California decide the question.
