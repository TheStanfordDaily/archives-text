# The 						Woman's Place

### 
~pHE woman's place is no longer in the home.
■ l That, at least, seems to apply to college
women until the war is over for the manpower
shortage is growing more and more acute with
"he drafting of 18 and 19-year-old men and the
great expansion of American industry.
Maybe the woman's place is in one of the
armed services. Only recently the Women's
Army Auxiliary Corps (WAAC's) announced
a six-fold increase which would swell its num
ber by 150,000.
The WAVES (women appointed for volun
:ary emergency service) and the Spars (Semper
paratus—always ready, the motto of the Coast
Suard) have opened up the ranks for volunteers.
These three branches of the armed service
Dffer definite opportunities to college women.
Seniors and alumnae of institutions of higher
learning are needed in large numbers.
Although the WAVES demand at least two
years of high school math, and scientific and
mathematic courses are often desirable in these
services, they not always prerequisites for
acceptance or for promotion.
There are a great number of positions that
must be filled and they vary from those of Air
craft Specialists to typists and librarians. Ac
cording to a bulletin issued by the American
Council on Education, women who have no ap
titude for the more scientific courses should
not take them since these women will make
neither good scientists nor good leaders.
However, women who are considering going
into one of these armed services might do well
to take courses in emergency techniques such
as motor mechanics, Morse code, and others.
The Daily will soon run a series of three
articles on the WAAC's, the WAVES, and the
SPARS, giving information about enlisting and
opportunities for university women.
