# Frosh President
## 
### 
All alone and no president to guide them!
That is the plight of some 800 Stanford stu
dents—members of the class of '46 who are still
without class officers.
Previously, the freshman class president and
vice-president have been elected midway in
Autumn Quarter and by Winter Quarter have
had the chance to set up an organization to lead
the class. This year, the need for prompt lead
ership was even greater because of the many
freshmen going to summer school. These sec

ond quarter freshmen particularly wanted to
organize Autumn Quarter. Now, many of them
are third quarter freshmen finishing their first
year at Stanford and still without a president.
Who is responsible for the situation?
It certainly does not result from a lack of
interest among the freshmen. Last quarter's
furore about freshmen on Excom showed that
Encinamen are concerned with the government
and administration of Stanford student affairs.
And the freshmen repeatedly asked their spon
sors about class elections last quarter.
It is not the fault of lohnny Mitchell, head
sponsor. Mitchell held an election for Encina
Club officers in autumn and has elected re
sponsible officers who are governing Encina
this quarter. He is not responsible for the fresh
man class election.
It is solely the fault of the Election Board not
to have elected a class president or to give
reasons to the freshmen for this failure. Al
though the chairman of Election Board was fre
quently reminded by Mitchell and Mr. Sharp,
Encina administrator, that the election of fresh
man class officers was his responsibility, no
action of any kind was taken last quarter.
Logically, the freshmen elections could have
been combined with the autumn elections Nov.
10 but it was not done.
Even though an election this late may be a
"closing of the barn door after the horse is gone"
situation, freshman class leaders should be
elected and elected promptly or good reasons
should be given why they will not be elected.
Election Board now has a new chairman. We
hope that 800 pairs of reproachful freshman
eyes will stir him into prompt action.—Ferris
Boothe.

Even though an election this late may be a
"closing of the barn door after the horse is gone"
situation, freshman class leaders should be
elected and elected promptly or good reasons
should be given why they will not be elected.

All alone and no president to guide them!
That is the plight of some 800 Stanford stu
dents—members of the class of '46 who are still
without class officers.
Previously, the freshman class president and
vice-president have been elected midway in
Autumn Quarter and by Winter Quarter have
had the chance to set up an organization to lead
the class. This year, the need for prompt lead
ership was even greater because of the many
freshmen going to summer school. These sec

ond quarter freshmen particularly wanted to
organize Autumn Quarter. Now, many of them
are third quarter freshmen finishing their first
year at Stanford and still without a president.
Who is responsible for the situation?
It certainly does not result from a lack of
interest among the freshmen. Last quarter's
furore about freshmen on Excom showed that
Encinamen are concerned with the government
and administration of Stanford student affairs.
And the freshmen repeatedly asked their spon
sors about class elections last quarter.
It is not the fault of lohnny Mitchell, head
sponsor. Mitchell held an election for Encina
Club officers in autumn and has elected re
sponsible officers who are governing Encina
this quarter. He is not responsible for the fresh
man class election.
It is solely the fault of the Election Board not
to have elected a class president or to give
reasons to the freshmen for this failure. Al
though the chairman of Election Board was fre
quently reminded by Mitchell and Mr. Sharp,
Encina administrator, that the election of fresh
man class officers was his responsibility, no
action of any kind was taken last quarter.
Logically, the freshmen elections could have
been combined with the autumn elections Nov.
