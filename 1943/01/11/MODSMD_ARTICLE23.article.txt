# OUR HASHER SEZ
## IN MEMORIAM 
### 
This paragraph of black sentiment is written
in memory of those poor freshman women who
didn't get asked to ail the houses they wanted,
but, although they may not realize it, they are
the only lucky girls among that vast group
called new lower division women.
The really unfortunate ones, those who are
about to suffer a fate worse than death, are
those who are still going around to all the
houses drinking the tea and eating the boloney.
Within a week's time they will be members
of a college sororityâ€”God help them.
