Since gas rationing has come into effect,
there will be less driving to the city for dances
and shows.
Last Friday and Saturday there were a few
couples at the Nitery. As you know this is
sponsored by the Cardinals. The purpose of
this is to provide the Stanford students with a
place in which to have coke dates and dances
during the week. I hope that you will give us
some publicity.
The Nitery is open during the week from 8
to 10:30 p.m. for the students who wish to have
coke dates. There is dancing on Fridays and
Saturdays from 8 to 12 p.m., and Sunday is
reserved for coke dates, etc., from 8 to 10:30 p.m.
Some of the fellows have said that they would
like to see some of the girls come stag, and they
would be glad to dance with them. This place
is open to girls as well as the men, and I hope
that we can have more people here from now
on.
Since the Nitery is open for the convenience
of the students, I wish that they would use it
more often than they do at present. There is a
possibility that it might be closed because of
the lack of students using it.
Sincerely,
Theodore C. Tennant.
