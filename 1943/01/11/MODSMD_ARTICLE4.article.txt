GEN. MacARTHUR'S HEAD
QUARTERS. Australia, Jan. 10 (U.R)
—Allied warplanes, peiced by twin
motored Lightning fighters, handed
the Japs their most smashing defeat
of the New Guinea campaign and one
of their worst of the entire Pacific
war in the 72-hour air-sea battle
which ended yesterday in the Lae
area of New Guinea, the Allied Com
mand announced today.
The three-day battle cost the Jap
anese 14 planes destroyed or dam
aged and six transports sunk or dam
aged in an effort to reinforce Lae,
160 miles from Buna and probably
one of the next goals in Gen Doug
las Mac Arthur's campaign to roll
the Japs back to the north.
During the height of the action on
Friday, upward of 100 planes from
both sides were in action. Several
times during the 72 hours, Allied
bombers were bunched so thickly
over the battle area that Mac Arthur's
fighter planes found it difficult to
dive among them to strafe Jap
ground targets.
An Allied Air Forces summary of
the action said:
"This, by far, was the biggest and
most remarkable defeat given the
enemy by the Allied Air Force in
the whole New Guinea campaign.
The remnants of the convoy, which
originally consisted of two cruisers,
four destroyers and four transports,
joined later by two more transports,
was reported to have withdrawn
from the area.
