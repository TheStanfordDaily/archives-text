# Men's Rushing Dinners May Be Eliminated
## 
### 
Another special meeting of Inter
i fraternity Council will be held at 5
j p.m. today in the Nitery to discuss
| further shortening of the fraternity
rushing program with the elimina
tion of evening rush meals a strong
possibility, Lee Peake, Interfrater
nity president, announced yesterday.
At a special meeting held last
Thursday, the Council reduced the
program by dropping afternoon rush
| periods, but took no action to meet
the emergency presented by food
and labor shortages.
"With the current food shortage
; and lack of help in fraternity kitch
ens," Peake stated, "it seems foolish
I to go ahead with the schedule as
originally planned." It is quite prob
able that today's meeting will dro{3
dinner rush periods from the pro-
I gram.
Food Shortage Problem
! Bill Ross, representative of the
I Stanford commissary which serves
i a majority of the fraternities, will
point out to the Council the prob
lems presented by the food shortage.
An after-dinner rushing period
I may be substituted for the present
j plan of inviting rushees to the houses
! for dinner.
Meanwhile, awaiting further action
by the Council, both frosh and
houses made plans to go ahead with
the rushing schedule as it now
stands. The houses have sent bids
to the freshmen inviting them to the
second rush period, which include
lunch and dinner tomorrow am
Wednesday. There is no rushing to
i day.
