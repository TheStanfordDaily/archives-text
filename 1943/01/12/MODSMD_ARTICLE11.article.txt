# THE 						WOMEN
## Rushing Bids Go Out Today 
### 
Invitations for the second period
of women's rushing will be distrib
uted this morning in the Panhellenie
office between 10 and 12:15. The in
vitations are to be returned this
afternoon between 12:45 and 2.
To insure the success of the sys
tem it is necessary that the 2 o'clock
deadline for returning invitations be
fulfilled. Panhellenie urges new
women not to cut classes to meet the
schedule, but to come in during their
free time.
The second rush period consists of
three dates, tonight, tomorrow night,
and Thursday night, all from 7:30
to 9. In this period a rushee may
carry one, two, or three houses. If
she carries one or two houses, she
may go twice to one house.
Rushees will wear informal sports
clothes for the second period. Houses
will serve dessert and coffee.
In reviewing t.he new system, Hank
Wallace, president of Panhellenie
Council, commented, "Thus far the
new informal system adopted for war
conditions seems to be more favor
able than the previous formal sys
tem."
