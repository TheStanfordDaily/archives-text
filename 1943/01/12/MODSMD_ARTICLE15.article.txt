# BLOOD BANK
## Services Want More Donors 
### 
"Now more than ever it is impor
tant to donate blood to the blood
bank because now there is a big call
for the blood from the armed serv
ices, and there will be an increasing
ly greater one as more soldiers go
into action," said Rosemary Fuller,
chairman of campus blood bank com
mittee.
"Last quarter 112 students donated
their blood. This quarter we hope
to have more students if possible,"
she said.
The first period during which stu
dents may give their blood will be a
week from Thursday. Students must
sign up for this period by Monday
in Room 14 in the Union.
A change has been made in the
weight requirement for blood do
nors, lowering it from 115 pounds to
110 pounds.
She also said that all persons be
tween 17 and 21 must have a slip
from their parents giving permission
to donate blood, "even though they
may have donated blood before."
The times for which students may
sign up are 11:20, 11:40, 1:20, and
1:40.
