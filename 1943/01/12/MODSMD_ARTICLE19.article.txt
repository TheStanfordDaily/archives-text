# Dean Believes Stanford Foes Best in U.S.
## 
### BY BILL HORNBY 
Coach Everett S. Dean returned to
the helm oi' Stanford's varsity cage
team yesterday afternoon with the
conviction that the Indians have al
ready played three of the five best
basketball teams that will appear
anywhere in the Uinted States in
194!).
Alter {Hitting the team through an
intensive shooting drill in prepara
tion for Southern California, the new
conference "favorite," Friday night,
Dean released the following report
on the state of Stanford's basketball
situation.
"Even if Stanford had been at its
best, it's doubtful if they would have
beaten Great Lakes or Illinois."
Great Lakes has what is probably the
greatest collection of basketball tal
ent in the history of the game, three
deep in Ail-Americans.
And Illinois, nearly the best college
team in the nation this year, was
able to beat them." "These games
were just about as good basketball
as you could expect to see," —and
that's from a coach who has seen
plenty of good basketball!
Stanford's Play
The Stanfords definitely made a
game out of both frays. They were
not at their peak form against Great
Lakes. Before Illinois travel and an
extensive round of entertainment at
the hands of the Sugar Bowl Classic
Committee in New Orleans took a
toll in energy when the squad ar
rived at Champaign at 4:45 in the
morning.
The Indians were thoroughly licked
in the first half, but their rally in
the second half forced the Illini to
stall the last four minutes.
After the game both Dean and the
players felt that the team had really
worked together for the first time.
"That felt right," Jack Dana told
Dean.
In the Great Lakes game, Stan
ford's Freddy Linari kept penetrat
ing this "best in the country's" de
fense for pot shots, but Dallmar and
Voss were definitely off.
"No StilYer Foe"
These aren't alibis, they are state
ments of the situation. Dean sums
up the trip with this feeling: "No
team in the country has met stiffer
opposition than Stanford in facing
Great Lakes. Illinois, or St. Mary's."
The Southern Cal publicists, mean
while. are heralding "an end to
Stanford s conference domination."
In back of this statement is the un
questionable fact that Ernie Hol
brook s quintet is the logical choice
for conference favorite.
On their Christmas barnstorm,
they topped Lawrence Tech, Ca
nisius, LIU, Temple, and Washing
ton at St. Louis. They lost to DePaul
University, 47-49. They beat Cal
39-32.
Leaving it for observers to match
the caliber of opposition faced by
both Stanford and S.C. thus far.
Dean and the Indians are content to
have the Trojans named as favorites.
All year Stanford may expect to
meet teams at their top form be
cause they will be bent on beating
thy, NCAA champs. It helps to have
the added heat of the conference
"lavorite spotlight off instead of on.
In team play Stanford will find
its 1943 strength; no individual stars
may be expected; Dean characterizes
his outfit as a team that has excel
lent material, bent on winning.
The outlook is not pessimistic.

39-32.
Leaving it for observers to match
the caliber of opposition faced by
both Stanford and S.C. thus far.
Dean and the Indians are content to
have the Trojans named as favorites.
All year Stanford may expect to
meet teams at their top form be
cause they will be bent on beating
thy, NCAA champs. It helps to have
the added heat of the conference
"lavorite spotlight off instead of on.
In team play Stanford will find
its 1943 strength; no individual stars
may be expected; Dean characterizes
his outfit as a team that has excel
lent material, bent on winning.
The outlook is not pessimistic.
Coach Everett S. Dean returned to
the helm oi' Stanford's varsity cage
team yesterday afternoon with the
conviction that the Indians have al
ready played three of the five best
basketball teams that will appear
anywhere in the Uinted States in
194!).
Alter {Hitting the team through an
intensive shooting drill in prepara
tion for Southern California, the new
conference "favorite," Friday night,
Dean released the following report
on the state of Stanford's basketball
situation.
"Even if Stanford had been at its
best, it's doubtful if they would have
beaten Great Lakes or Illinois."
Great Lakes has what is probably the
greatest collection of basketball tal
ent in the history of the game, three
deep in Ail-Americans.
And Illinois, nearly the best college
team in the nation this year, was
able to beat them." "These games
were just about as good basketball
as you could expect to see," —and
that's from a coach who has seen
plenty of good basketball!
Stanford's Play
The Stanfords definitely made a
game out of both frays. They were
not at their peak form against Great
Lakes. Before Illinois travel and an
extensive round of entertainment at
the hands of the Sugar Bowl Classic
Committee in New Orleans took a
toll in energy when the squad ar
rived at Champaign at 4:45 in the
morning.
The Indians were thoroughly licked
in the first half, but their rally in
the second half forced the Illini to
stall the last four minutes.
After the game both Dean and the
players felt that the team had really
worked together for the first time.
"That felt right," Jack Dana told
Dean.
In the Great Lakes game, Stan
ford's Freddy Linari kept penetrat
ing this "best in the country's" de
fense for pot shots, but Dallmar and
Voss were definitely off.
"No StilYer Foe"
These aren't alibis, they are state
ments of the situation. Dean sums
up the trip with this feeling: "No
team in the country has met stiffer
opposition than Stanford in facing
Great Lakes. Illinois, or St. Mary's."
The Southern Cal publicists, mean
while. are heralding "an end to
Stanford s conference domination."
In back of this statement is the un
questionable fact that Ernie Hol
brook s quintet is the logical choice
for conference favorite.
On their Christmas barnstorm,
they topped Lawrence Tech, Ca
nisius, LIU, Temple, and Washing
ton at St. Louis. They lost to DePaul
University, 47-49. They beat Cal
39-32.
