The long debated question of what
to do about the evening rush meals
was finally settled today at the meet
ing of the Interfraternity Council
From this meeting, came the final
decision that all fraternities would

The decision was quickly reached
by an overwhelming majority of
the Council. Although the food and
labor shortage is critical, it was not
critical enough to stop the program.

today with lunch rushing periods
from 11:30 to 1. All freshmen who
have received invitations and have
returned them to Johnny Mitchell
will be welcomed. Campus clothes
should be worn and no attempt
should be made to dress up.
Tonight the fraternities will again
.velcome freshmen for dinner from
J to 8 p.m. Sports coats or suits
ihould be worn.
Tomorrow the fraternities will
igain be open for the lunch period
ind for the evening rush period.

jin Friday and will run through Sat
urday with two rushing periods
>ach day. Invitations for these per
ods will be sent out by the fraterni
ies on Wednesday and must be re
urned to Johnny Mitchell by the
reshmen on Thursday.
