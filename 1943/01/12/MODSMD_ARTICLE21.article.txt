Stanford, along with several other
colleges that sent their basketball
teams on the road this Christmas
vacation, was severely criticized not
long ago by James S. Kearns of the
Chicago Sun in his column called
"Here We Go Again."
Mr. Kearns is absolutely correct
in stating 400,000 lives were lost be
cause these teams took valuable
space on trains at a time when the
ODT asked everyone to refrain from
using transportation facilities. Among
these teams were Oregon State,
Southern California, and Washing
ton State.
Also listed were Stanford and
Great Lakes. These two teams
went directly to the Sugar Bowl
Sports Carnival to engage in a
game that was played solely for
Navy Relief. But Mr. Kearns'
story doesn't mention that fact, and
the University must take the ad
verse publicity without being de
fended.
A columnist in San Francisco made
the same accusation before the In
dians left on their trip. When he
learned that it had the official sanc
tion of the ODT. however, he quick
ly retracted his statement.

Should the West be restricted
from using gasoline for pleasure
driving as the East has, it should not
materially affect the attendance at
basketball games.
Most of the games are held at a
central part of the town, as at San
Francisco's Civic Auditorium. The
California Gym is not far from the
streetcar line. As for Stanford,
the students wouldn't have any
place to go except to walk down
to Encina Gym and watch the team
play.
Some sports are being crippled
severely due to wartime restrictions
and lack of men to participate. It
seems that basketball can withstand
the storm better than most games.
