# Race Tracks Idle On Week Days Now
## 
### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 11 (U.R)â€”For
the first time in more than 13 years
all United States race tracks were
idle on a week day. The only track
which is still running is the New
Orleans Fairgrounds, and it is idle on
Mondays. All other Florida tracks
have been closed since last week be
cause of the OPA ban on pleasure
driving.
