# Pledging Frosh?
## 
### 
STANFORD holds a unique advantage over
most Western colleges and universities in
that it offers to its students after their frosh year
two living systems: Hall and Row.
When a student first comes to Stanford he is
given a year among his own class entirely with
no affiliation whatever with upperclassmen or
ganizations. During this year he has an oppor
tunity to view campus social and living groups,
and to decide upon the friends he wishes to
live with during his next three years of college.
But even with all these advantages to aid the
f'rosh in making an independent decision as
v o his future living group, it is hard for him to
-each an unbiased conclusion.
It is natural for a freshman to think first of
; raternities when coming to college because of
f he prestige attached to them, and because the
mating club system is quite new in the West,
-;lubs being organized only here at Stanford.
f n the East, however, clubs have been function
ing for some time at Harvard, Yale, and Prince
ton.
In normal times, under the Stanford system,
without the complications of a war to interrupt
'he student's college career, advice given to
f rosh about rushing has been:
Consider first the type of men in the organi
sations. Do you want to live and associate with
them a majority of the time? Secondly, con
sider the living accommodations, and thirdly,
*ake into consideration the social prestige of the
group.
At present these things should be consid
ered, and, also, additional problems raised by
'he war.
No freshman really has any assurance of just
how long he will be in school. Likewise, he has
no assurance that the organization which he
pledges, or the pledge class, either club or
fraternity, will be the same three months from
now. Nor has he any assurance as to the type
of organization his might be when he returns to
the campus after the war. How binding should
present pledges be? These are things which
must be considered.
They are not easy problems to settle. Al
though they may seem rather inconsequential
at first they are as important a side of college
life as is the planning of a proper study pro
gram.
For this reason, Frosh, consider carefully be
fore making a binding pledge to a house or
club. Make a point of visiting all organizations.
Take advantage of the club open house. Drop
in at any of the clubs at the regular meal hours.
And take full advantage of all the Row invi
tations you receive.
Vary your appointments and visits, so that
you can see both sides of the Stanford living
system at the same time.
And then make your decision according to
your own conclusions, uninfluenced by the
pressure of your freshman friends, or the pres
sure of Hall and Row rushing committees, for it
is you yourself who set the standards and am
bitions by which you live, and who choose the
persons you want for friends.—Newton Wise

It is natural for a freshman to think first of
; raternities when coming to college because of
f he prestige attached to them, and because the
mating club system is quite new in the West,
-;lubs being organized only here at Stanford.
f n the East, however, clubs have been function
ing for some time at Harvard, Yale, and Prince
ton.
In normal times, under the Stanford system,
without the complications of a war to interrupt
'he student's college career, advice given to
f rosh about rushing has been:
Consider first the type of men in the organi
sations. Do you want to live and associate with
them a majority of the time? Secondly, con
sider the living accommodations, and thirdly,
*ake into consideration the social prestige of the
group.
At present these things should be consid
ered, and, also, additional problems raised by
'he war.
No freshman really has any assurance of just
how long he will be in school. Likewise, he has
no assurance that the organization which he
pledges, or the pledge class, either club or
fraternity, will be the same three months from
now. Nor has he any assurance as to the type
of organization his might be when he returns to
the campus after the war. How binding should
present pledges be? These are things which
must be considered.
They are not easy problems to settle. Al
though they may seem rather inconsequential
at first they are as important a side of college
life as is the planning of a proper study pro
gram.
For this reason, Frosh, consider carefully be
fore making a binding pledge to a house or
club. Make a point of visiting all organizations.
Take advantage of the club open house. Drop
in at any of the clubs at the regular meal hours.
And take full advantage of all the Row invi
tations you receive.
Vary your appointments and visits, so that
you can see both sides of the Stanford living
system at the same time.
And then make your decision according to
your own conclusions, uninfluenced by the
pressure of your freshman friends, or the pres
sure of Hall and Row rushing committees, for it
is you yourself who set the standards and am
bitions by which you live, and who choose the
persons you want for friends.—Newton Wise
STANFORD holds a unique advantage over
most Western colleges and universities in
that it offers to its students after their frosh year
two living systems: Hall and Row.
When a student first comes to Stanford he is
given a year among his own class entirely with
no affiliation whatever with upperclassmen or
ganizations. During this year he has an oppor
tunity to view campus social and living groups,
and to decide upon the friends he wishes to
live with during his next three years of college.
But even with all these advantages to aid the
f'rosh in making an independent decision as
v o his future living group, it is hard for him to
-each an unbiased conclusion.
