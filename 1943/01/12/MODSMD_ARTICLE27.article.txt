The Editor, Sir:
In answer to our critical hasher, I should like
to point out a few advantages to be had in
sorority living which make his woeful memo
rial of yesterday seem not only extreme but
ridiculous.
We admit the deficiencies of rushing at Stan
ford—the mutual disappointments it creates
through the notorious discrepancy between the
number of women who register for rushing and
the number of girls the houses can take. But
the system at Stanford of deferred rushing and
the required three quarters of living together in
University residences gives new students a
feeling of class unity, provides them oppor
tunity for many and permanent friendships, and
creates an easier adjustment to Stanford life.
We admit that in sorority living there is a
tendency to absorb characteristics from the
people you are living with but the claimed
"sorority stereotype" is a fallacy. A sorority,
being a small group of girls, is personal. You
group based on the goal of unity to feel a re
group based on the goal of uiity to feel a re
sponsibility and consideration for each other—
a responsibility which makes you want to
bring out what is best in them and a considera
tion which makes you subjugate your self-in
terests to preserve the unity of the group. This
may sound too ideal. But I know there is a
conscious effort for this type of understanding
that you can't help feeling an integral part of
something because you know the girls in your
house are interested in you.
The Daily's habit of destructive criticism may
provide them satisfaction and may be, at times,
beneficial, but I'm sure the student body would
appreciate it if the columnists would use their
intelligence toward a conscientious appraisal
of the problems and evils they see in Stanford's
student government and social organization.
