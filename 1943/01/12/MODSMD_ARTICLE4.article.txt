## Stanford Gets $7,500 Grant 
### 
Stanford has received an addi
tional grant of $7,500 from the Rocke
feller Foundation to continue re
search on plant heredity in relation
to vitamins, announced Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur today.
Biologists at Stanford have de
veloped a method of studying vita
mins and growth factors through the
growth of special genetic strains of
a species of red bread mold. Dr.
George W. Beadle, geneticist, Drs.
Edward Tatum, Norman H. Horo
witz, and David Bonner, biochemists,
are working on the project.
These biologists obtain mutant
forms of the mold which will not
grow without the addition of certain
vitamins or amino acids by X-ray
ing the bread mold neurospors. They
then determine both the quality and
quantity of vitamins in the sub
stance by feeding a substance which
has an unknown vitamin content to
the mutant molds, whose particular
vitamin deficiency is known.
Through grants of the Nutrition
Foundation, the applied phase of the
research will further develop the
background for the application of the
vitamin analysis method for meas
uring amounts of vitamins in various
natural products, such as vegetables,
fruits, and other foods.
