## Jungle Will Be Series Theme 
### 
Jungle exploration with all the
! fine points—discovery of ancient
i cities and ruins, transportation by
! airplanes, canoes, mules, motorboats,
| and native carriers, a forced landing
by a hydroplane and the subsequent
discovery of a lost community—com
prises much of the story which Paul
; Fejos, famous anthropologist and
etnographer, will tell Tuesday Eve
ning Series patrons tonight at 7:30 in
Memorial Auditorium.
17-Year Tour
Fejos whose search for the story
' and artifacts of lost cultures has
taken him on a 17-year tour of such
wide-flung places as Madagascar,
China, the Philippines, Malaya, Siam,
Peru, and the East Indies, will de
scribe the Viking Expedition in
1940 which explored the Vilcanota
Valley in the Southeastern Cordill
era of the Peruvian Andes, near the
Bolivian border.
Sponsored jointly by the Viking
Foundation and the Viking Fund, the
I expedition had a technical staff of
i seven, a scientific staff of eight, and
a native personnel varying between
■58 and 800, depending upon- the ter-
I rain to be covered.
Pre-Colombian Cities
Seven Pre-Colombian cities were
i unearthed; the topographers of the
expedition mapped 45,000 square
kilometers of virgin forest; a com
munity of Spanish and Brazilian
rubber collectors was discovered
who, abandoned by their bankrupt
company 30 years before, had taken
| to the life of the jungle Indians. A
new generation of forest people, the
1 Pinquin Colony, was born in this
! adaptation.
Dr. Fejos is a fellow of the Royal
Danish Geographical Society; a mem
ber of the Royal Hungarian Society
of Natural Sciences; a member of
