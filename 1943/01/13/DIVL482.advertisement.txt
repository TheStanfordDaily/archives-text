Thepeople who lire in the cities, tonus and villages
along Southern Pacific's lines in the West hare just
provided a fine example of war-time cooperation.
We think this cooperation deserves recognition and we want to sav
"thank you" . . . since Southern Pacific was primarily concerned. And
we're cjuite sure the many thousands of men in uniform who benefitted
too, would also like to join us in this expression of appreciation.
Early in December we were faced with the problem of providing trans
portation during the holidays for a very large number of men in the
armed services who were to be given holiday furloughs. Because of the
pressure of war traffic on our equipment... cars and locomotives .. .we
knew that we could not provide transportation for all these service men
and the normal number of civilian holiday travelers too.
So we arranged a somewhat drastic and extensive program requiring
coach reservations for virtually all trains, and set aside a major portion
of both Pullman and coach space for the service men. Then we ran ad
vertising telling people what our problem was, and why we could not
take care of everyone w ho would like to travel during the holidays. We
asked people not to "Try the Train".
As a result many people gave up holiday trips they very much wanted to
make. The amount of civilian travel, compared with December, 1941,
w as considerably reducecT and we took care of the service men in good
shape. There was comparatively little congestion, and all essential travel
was accommodated.
So we know that people generally have cooperated . . . and we give you
all a hearty "thank you."
May we also express our appreciation at this time for your considerate
and understanding attitude towards Southern Pacific and its service
during the last twelve months?
We hope you will continue to confine your trips, in 1943, to essential
travel.
