## 'No New Buildings on Farm For Duration of War,' Walker 
### 
Stanford will have no new buildings for the duration of the war, accord
ing to an announcement received by Financial Vice-l'residcnt Frank Fish
Walker.
The announcement states that the War Production Hoard Limitation
Order L-41 places certain limits on the amount of money which the Uni-

versity may spend in any one year (
for purposes of overall remodeling
of structures. No limitation has been
placed on the expenditures for rou
tine maintenance or repairs.
However, such items as electric ]
wire, pipe, metal objects, steel prod
ucts, and certain wood products
cannot be acquired by the Univer
sity under its priority. Because the
University has only a limited num
ber of these items, these scarce ma
terials may be utilized for repair
purposes in departments only when
an emergency is involved.
Under the Limitation Order, ex
penditures of departmental funds
will also be curtailed. The order will
permit the University to paint walls,
and floors, repair broken windows, ,
and other items of a similar char
acter which can be classified as i
maintenance or repair.
Manpower in the Corporation Yard
must also be rationed. Labor
shortage will necessitate the han- j
dling of only essential work. Mr. J.
W. McDonnell, Superintendent of j
Buildings and Grounds, will endea
vor to see that most matters are at
tended to, according to the announce
ment.
Heat must also be carefully util
ized. The University has operated
its steam plant for some years under
a surplus gas contract. Because of
rapid increase in demand for nat
ural gas by war-stimulated indus
tries, no surplus gas has been avail
able to the University on recent oc
casions. When this occurs, the plant
has had to shift to fuel oil. It is not
inconceivable that a point may be
reached, where on occasions, the
heating system may not be operated
to full capacity.
