"STRATEGY FOR VICTORY" by
Hanson W. Baldwin, W. W. Norton
and Co.. New York, 1942. $1.75.
As military editor of the New
| York Times, Hanson Baldwin has |
i established himself as one of the
' most reliable analysts of World War
11. His latest book, "Strategy for
| Victory," is not a crystal-gazing
j guess at the future, but a shrewd
1 analysis of the paths which the
I Unitqd Nations must follow to vie- ;
; tory.
Author Baldwin boils down the
whole question of global strategy to
two fairly well-recognized funda
mentals: (1) The German armies
I must be decisively beaten on the j
continent of Europe before Hitler
can be defeated, and (2) the job of
beating Japan from Australia, is- j
j land by island, is too costly—we j
must use Pearl Harbor as the spring
| board and mount the offensive from i
Wake and Guam upon the Japanese j
j mainland.
And these paths to victory lead
over long trails—for two, three, five, j
even seven years more—says Bald
win.
"Its cost will be colossal; perhaps !
i 500 billions of dollars for this na- i
j tion alone. But monetary sacrifice is \
| the smallest evil. Victory will cost ;
heavily in blood; we cannot recon- j
quer a continent without wholesale
I death. We probably cannot keep,
j except in rough outline, the Ameri- !
can way of life; we shall be a harder. |
tougher, but more regimented and (
j less free people; our standards of
j living will be depressed, and inevi- j
table economic and political dislo
cation must follow the war. These
| are the costs. Total war means total J
j sacrifice."
Baldwin presents the problem fac
| ing our generation with a realistic j
I touch. He hasn't pulled the punches j
and he hasn't overestimated the i
j chances of victory. But he has j
] shown how victory can be won, and
j the price we must pay to win it.— !
