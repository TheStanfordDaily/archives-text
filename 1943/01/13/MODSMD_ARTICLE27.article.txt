# Soviets Roll On Against Nazis
## 
### 
IF YOU WERE A NAZI and bought a ticket to Russia, you would
have been wise to buy a round trip. Although the news from
the Red front has been victorious for the Soviets, there are those
who feel that it is very dangerous to be over optimistic. Perhaps,
news commentators say, this pendulum will swing back again.
However, the reports continue to be very convincing.


CHARGING, ever charging, the Keel Army continues lo roll over Nazi-captured territory. In the picture above, radioed from Moscow to New
York, we see the Soviets storming German defenses on the Kharkov front.
