# STANFORD CREW
## Oarsmen Expect Good Season As Turnout Exceeds Hopes 
### BY BILL ROSE 
At last crew is going over at Stan
ford. In fact, the turnout this quar
ter has been so good that Coach Carl
Pedersen had to turn some fellows
away because there isn't enough
equipment to handle them all.
Coach Pedersen is enthusiastic
about the number and spirit of the
men who have come out this quar
ter and has high hopes for his oars
men's chances in this spring's races.
Veterans Back
Of the crew which raced against
Cal last quarter, six veterans are
back. They are Bob Hampton, who
j rowed in the No. 5 position; Jerry
1 Grunwald, No. 7; Kenny Young, 6;
j Bill Dodd, 4; Paul Schute, 1; and
1 Bud Clary, stroke. Also back in the

The Stanford crew would like
to borrow or rent a motor boat
which they could use as a coach
ing launch. As it is now. Coach
Pedersen has to ride in one of the
shells in which the men are row
ing. This makes watching the men
in the other shells difficult as well
as inconvenient.
The motor boot should have a
speed of 25 miles per hour. Any
one in possession of such a launch
is asked to contact Coach Peder
sen.

coxswain's seat is Walt Drake.
Drake and Clary have been facing
each other ever since the revival of
crew at Stanford.
Another experienced man who
worked out in the first shell Monday
is 6-foot 5-in„ 200-pound Orlin Har
ter, who rowed against Cal last
spring. Working out in Schute's
position Monday was Don Bjork
land, a member of last quarter's sec
ond shell and one of this year's out
standing prospects.
Replacements
Mel Savage, also a second shell
man last quarter, took the No. 2
seat; and Wayne Sturgis, another
experienced man, rowed in plrrce of
Dodd, who is down with a cold. Sid
Henderson and Bill Foster are the
only veterans of last fall's Cal race
who are not out this quarter.
Among the new men out for the
first time this year are Bob Berry
man. first string tackle on this sea
son's frosh team, and Tony Medved,
varsity football center.
No races have been arranged as
yet, but Pedersen is now contacting
several coast schools and hopes to
have some contests scheduled soon.
He is endeavoring to arrange races
with Washington and UCLA while

they are here for their races with
Cal toward the end of April.
May Ilace Sacramento
There is also a possibility that
Oregon State will come dowYi some
time in March, and Coach Pcdersen
is dickering for a contest, with Sac
ramento J.C. sometime that month.
The Sacramento outfit is one of the
strongest on the coast because most
of the boys from the state capital
haVe had crew experience in high
school under the tutelage of the
Jaysee mentor. -
No definite date has yet been set
for the Cal race.
The new crew is one of the largest
in size of men we have ever had;
because, due to the big turnout, only
men of 6-foot 1-in. and over were
accepted. The complete squad aver
ages 0-foot 1 7/ 8-in. and 182 pounds.
Crew in Sections
Monday was the first time the first
shell was taken out. The crew is
working out in two sections, one
meeting Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, and the other Tuesday,
Thursday, and Sunday, until Coach
Pedersen has had a chance to make
a more accurate estimate of his ma
terial.
At the end of a couple of weeks
both sections will be marked and all
the crew men will be out every day
except Saturday.
The crew's three shells and one
scow are in good shape. The oars
men are in hopes of getting one more
shell, so that more men can be ac
commodated. They are also trying
to get a truck and trailer which will
carry them to and from the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
As it is now the men have to use
their own cars for transportation, and
gas rationing has made this means of
traveling rather imfeasable.
All crewmen are required to pass
a 50-yard swimming test before they
go out in a shell.

ter, who rowed against Cal last
spring. Working out in Schute's
position Monday was Don Bjork
land, a member of last quarter's sec
ond shell and one of this year's out
standing prospects.
Replacements
Mel Savage, also a second shell
man last quarter, took the No. 2
seat; and Wayne Sturgis, another
experienced man, rowed in plrrce of
Dodd, who is down with a cold. Sid
Henderson and Bill Foster are the
only veterans of last fall's Cal race
who are not out this quarter.
Among the new men out for the
first time this year are Bob Berry
man. first string tackle on this sea
son's frosh team, and Tony Medved,
varsity football center.
No races have been arranged as
yet, but Pedersen is now contacting
several coast schools and hopes to
have some contests scheduled soon.
He is endeavoring to arrange races
with Washington and UCLA while

they are here for their races with
Cal toward the end of April.
May Ilace Sacramento
There is also a possibility that
Oregon State will come dowYi some
time in March, and Coach Pcdersen
is dickering for a contest, with Sac
ramento J.C. sometime that month.
The Sacramento outfit is one of the
strongest on the coast because most
of the boys from the state capital
haVe had crew experience in high
school under the tutelage of the
Jaysee mentor. -
No definite date has yet been set
for the Cal race.
The new crew is one of the largest
in size of men we have ever had;
because, due to the big turnout, only
men of 6-foot 1-in. and over were
accepted. The complete squad aver
ages 0-foot 1 7/ 8-in. and 182 pounds.
Crew in Sections
Monday was the first time the first
shell was taken out. The crew is
working out in two sections, one
meeting Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, and the other Tuesday,
Thursday, and Sunday, until Coach
Pedersen has had a chance to make
a more accurate estimate of his ma
terial.
At the end of a couple of weeks
both sections will be marked and all
the crew men will be out every day
except Saturday.
The crew's three shells and one
scow are in good shape. The oars
men are in hopes of getting one more
shell, so that more men can be ac
commodated. They are also trying
to get a truck and trailer which will
carry them to and from the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
As it is now the men have to use
their own cars for transportation, and
gas rationing has made this means of
traveling rather imfeasable.
All crewmen are required to pass
a 50-yard swimming test before they
go out in a shell.
At last crew is going over at Stan
ford. In fact, the turnout this quar
ter has been so good that Coach Carl
Pedersen had to turn some fellows
away because there isn't enough
equipment to handle them all.
Coach Pedersen is enthusiastic
about the number and spirit of the
men who have come out this quar
ter and has high hopes for his oars
men's chances in this spring's races.

The new crew is one of the largest
in size of men we have ever had;
because, due to the big turnout, only
men of 6-foot 1-in. and over were
accepted. The complete squad aver
ages 0-foot 1 7/ 8-in. and 182 pounds.
Crew in Sections
Monday was the first time the first
shell was taken out. The crew is
working out in two sections, one
meeting Monday, Wednesday, and
Friday, and the other Tuesday,
Thursday, and Sunday, until Coach
Pedersen has had a chance to make
a more accurate estimate of his ma
terial.
At the end of a couple of weeks
both sections will be marked and all
the crew men will be out every day
except Saturday.
The crew's three shells and one
scow are in good shape. The oars
men are in hopes of getting one more
shell, so that more men can be ac
commodated. They are also trying
to get a truck and trailer which will
carry them to and from the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor.
As it is now the men have to use
their own cars for transportation, and
gas rationing has made this means of
traveling rather imfeasable.
All crewmen are required to pass
a 50-yard swimming test before they
go out in a shell.
At last crew is going over at Stan
ford. In fact, the turnout this quar
ter has been so good that Coach Carl
Pedersen had to turn some fellows
away because there isn't enough
equipment to handle them all.
Coach Pedersen is enthusiastic
about the number and spirit of the
men who have come out this quar
ter and has high hopes for his oars
men's chances in this spring's races.
Veterans Back
Of the crew which raced against
Cal last quarter, six veterans are
back. They are Bob Hampton, who
j rowed in the No. 5 position; Jerry
1 Grunwald, No. 7; Kenny Young, 6;
j Bill Dodd, 4; Paul Schute, 1; and
1 Bud Clary, stroke. Also back in the

The Stanford crew would like
to borrow or rent a motor boat
which they could use as a coach
ing launch. As it is now. Coach
Pedersen has to ride in one of the
shells in which the men are row
ing. This makes watching the men
in the other shells difficult as well
as inconvenient.
The motor boot should have a
speed of 25 miles per hour. Any
one in possession of such a launch
is asked to contact Coach Peder
sen.

coxswain's seat is Walt Drake.
Drake and Clary have been facing
each other ever since the revival of
crew at Stanford.
Another experienced man who
worked out in the first shell Monday
is 6-foot 5-in„ 200-pound Orlin Har
ter, who rowed against Cal last
spring. Working out in Schute's
position Monday was Don Bjork
land, a member of last quarter's sec
ond shell and one of this year's out
standing prospects.
Replacements
Mel Savage, also a second shell
man last quarter, took the No. 2
seat; and Wayne Sturgis, another
experienced man, rowed in plrrce of
Dodd, who is down with a cold. Sid
Henderson and Bill Foster are the
only veterans of last fall's Cal race
who are not out this quarter.
Among the new men out for the
first time this year are Bob Berry
man. first string tackle on this sea
son's frosh team, and Tony Medved,
varsity football center.
No races have been arranged as
yet, but Pedersen is now contacting
several coast schools and hopes to
have some contests scheduled soon.
He is endeavoring to arrange races
with Washington and UCLA while

they are here for their races with
Cal toward the end of April.
May Ilace Sacramento
There is also a possibility that
Oregon State will come dowYi some
time in March, and Coach Pcdersen
is dickering for a contest, with Sac
ramento J.C. sometime that month.
The Sacramento outfit is one of the
strongest on the coast because most
of the boys from the state capital
haVe had crew experience in high
school under the tutelage of the
Jaysee mentor. -
