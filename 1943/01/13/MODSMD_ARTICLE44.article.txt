## Winner of USC Game May Be Conference Cage Champions 
### 
Pacific Coast Conference southern}
division basketball champion for j
[ 1943 could easily be the winner of j
Friday night's uiash between Stan- j
ford and the University of Southern
j California.
The clash matches our own NCAA !
! champions, at the moment out of the \
limelight, and a new "superteam" of
the West composed of these ele- j
ments:
Midget-like forward Gene Rock, j
a 5-foot, 9-inch graduate of Hunt
ington Park High School with a
lethal left-handed push shot. On
the Christmas barnstorming tour, on
which the "superteam" was bap- j
tized, Rock scored 39 goals and add- '
j od enough free throws for 87 points. |
He averaged 14.5 points a game for
six games.
Returning from the same Tsquad
which handed the Indians their only !
conference defeat last year is Alex
Omalev, a Detroit, Mich, citizen of I
j Serbian descent who specializes in j
long shots. They, in part, netted him
; 76 points in conference play last '
year and 66 points on the Trojan j
j Christmas trip.
Lettermcn Return
Omalev and Captain-Guard Ted
Gossard are the only two-year let
termcn on the squad. Gossard was
all-league forward from Los Angeles
I Poly, with three years between high
school graduation and college adding
I to his build and brains. He averaged
2.5 points a game on the barnstorm,
indicating that he tends to the guard
ing business.
The other guard will probably be
Don Perkins, who was, to quote Tro
| jan releases, a "fancy-foot doorman"
of last year's reserves. Brother Per
kins was none too potent on the
1 Christmas trip, bucketing an aver
age of 0 points per game. Therefore,
it may be that Messrs. Ernie McGill
or Dick Bailey will be guarding
| Linari and Dana.
A (Â»9-Point Barnstorm
At center is Jim SeminofT. a "bulky
veteran," who got 69 points on the
barnstorm, and an 18-point average.
These ihen are the supermen of
I the superteam who would become
j the "men of tomorrow" in conference
I basketball. Lest the locals begin to
quake early, we take one final look
at the kind of teams that Stanford
! played this Christmas.
Here is the reserve roster of the
Great Lakes Naval Training Station
team: Forrest Anderson (Stanford),
George Glamack (North Carolina),
George Hamburg (Colorado), John
ny Hiller (Notre Dame), Wilbur
| Schumacher (Butler), George Sobek
, (Notre Dams), and Forrest Sproul
(Purdue). If you don't know your
' basketball oi the last few years, this
is what that list spells: CREAM.
Trojans Try to Retaliate
In 1941 the first of Everett Dean's
I conference champs took the southern
division crown away from Southern
California. Now the Trojans are re
turning to attempt the same opera
tion. They seem to think they can
do it. Daily Trojan hoop writer Bill
Carter opines "the Palo Altoans ap
pear to have lost the punch that en
abled them to go on to win the na
tional championship at Kansas City
j last spring."

Meanwhile in the Pavilion, Dean
will probably concentrate on shoot
ing this week, trying to sharpen
Stanford's eye, on rebounds par
ticularly. Voss, Dana, and Linari of
the forward arid center positions
will carry the main scoring hopes.
Howie Dallmar has his work cut out
lor him on backboard coverage, both
opponent's and his own. Leo Mc-
Caffrey and Fred Oliver will share
the work at the other guard post.
BroWn May Drop
In the reserve picture, Dave
Brown, probably the best of last
year's frosh quint, is rumored to be
dropping out of basketball, although
nothing definite has been established.
Jack Heald, the frosh center who
left Stanford's football world this
fall when an old knee injury was
hurt again, is pondering a knee op
eration that might set him up for
basketball. .
