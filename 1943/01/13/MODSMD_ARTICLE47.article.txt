## Papoose Cagers Try for Win Against Paly Squad Today 
### 
Woody Weir and his Papoose cage squad get their first test of the season
this afternoon at 3:45 in Paly, and at the same time have a chance to snap
one of the most phenomenal winning streaks in Bay Area prep cage history.
Paly High, opponent for the afternoon, has not been defeated since 1941,
winning more than .'5O straight contests without a loss.

Untested to date but boasting an
imposing array of individual talent,
the Papcese figure to keep things in
teresting. and may, if their team
work is up to pax - , pull an upset.
Dick Berlin, former All-State cen
ter from Washington, and Dave
Davidson, scoring sensation in prac
tice scrimmages, are the lads Paly
will be watching. Berlin's backboard
wizardry should keep the Papeese in
control of the ball most of the time.
Papoose Lineup
Pairing with Davidson forward
in the starting lineup will be former
Paly eager Hugh West. Jack Davis
gets the call at one of the guard
slots, while Weir is still undecided
as to his other starter at this post.
Bill Christiansen and Jack Coppage
are waging a hot fight for the spot at
present.
Spectators, however, will see a lot
of A1 Fish and Jack Higgins. as well
as Ben Provost. Fish and Higgins
are forwards, the latter still not
eligible for sure. Provost works be
hind Davis at guard.
The Vikings depend for their of
fensive punch on 6-foot-plus Norm
Keeler, holder of a 12-point sea
sonal average. Paced by Keeler, the
red and green quintet has ripped off
five successive wins this year, in
cluding a 58-21 massacre of Santa
Clara High and an*Â«asy 24-11 victory
over Snn Mateo High.
Viking Lineup
Keeler, who against Santa Clara
tallied 30 points, teams with Allen
Cobbe at forward. Morton Bishop
holds down the center post, and Jack
Lawrence and Bob Wade work at
guard.
In last year's fracas between the
two clubs Paly easily outclassed the
Papcese, 34-22. Keeler was the in
dividual star of the afternoon, while
Hugh West and Pete Allen, both on
the "4t> Papeese squad, also stod out.
