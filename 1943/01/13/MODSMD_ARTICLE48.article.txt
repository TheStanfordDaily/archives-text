Although no definite plans have

the Stanford Band, Ed Carpenter,
manager of the band has announced
that the first meeting of the band
will be held tomorrow at 4:15 in the
bandhouse.
The band ordinarily would be
sponsored by the 8.A.C., but be

band is forced to find new means of
support. But the band for the pres
ent will continue under strict student
direction.
Students do not have to sign up
at the registrar's office to attend band
classes this quarter. The bind will
be under the direction of Dick Rab
bett, as leader, and will be managed
by Ed Carpenter.
All old members are urged to at
tend the initial meeting of the band
and any other students interested
in playing with the band this quar
ter are asked to attend the meeting.
Although no definite word has
been heard from the B.A.C. to date

the home basketball games as well
as for military functions of the Stan
ford R.O.T.C.
