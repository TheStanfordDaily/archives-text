TWO days ago the United States and Great
Britain put salve on one of the sore spots
of the world which has festered for almost 100
years.
By relinguishing their extra-territorial claims
against China, they have made a great step for
ward. Although the details of the treaty will
be withheld until formal ratification, the State
Department said that when it does become ef
fective the United States will relinguish:
(1) Extra-territorial jurisdiction; (2) special
rights accorded under the "Boxer protocol" of
1901, including the right to station troops in
China; (3) special rights in relation to the sys
tem of treaty ports and in relation to the diplo
matic quarter at Peiping and to the international
settlements at Shanghai and Amoy, including
the special courts at Shanghai; (4) special rights
regarding inland navigation in China and the
special rights hitherto enjoyed by American
naval vessels in Chinese waters.
Existing rights on American property in
3hina remain undisturbed, but will be subject
>o Chinese laws.
By no longer having claims against her terri
'ory, no longer having foreign gunboats on her
'ivers, or American marines in her cities, China
has stepped into the circle of democratic na
tions as a full member and not as a protectorate
—not as a nation of "little yellow brothers" to
be cared for and exploited.
Such a move as this enables Americans to
ook at the future squarely and searchingly—
not carefully hiding a sphere from their vision
for fear of finding something unpleasant.
If action such as this continues to come from
the United Nations, there is a place for hope
and ideals in our minds. There is hope that
although war is hell, it will not have been fought
for nothing. There is hope that what our fathers
failed to do and what we are endeavoring to
do now will not have to be again undertaken
by our sons.
And there is the distant thought of an ideal
world. It is news such as this that makes men
walk up a hill under fire with shells exploding,
machine guns rattling, and smoke and flame
and death around them. It is news like this
that fosters hope—hope that when they get
to the top, past destruction, when they come
out of the smoke, they will find a soft, green,
peaceful world below.

tem of treaty ports and in relation to the diplo
matic quarter at Peiping and to the international
settlements at Shanghai and Amoy, including
the special courts at Shanghai; (4) special rights

By no longer having claims against her terri
'ory, no longer having foreign gunboats on her
'ivers, or American marines in her cities, China
has stepped into the circle of democratic na
tions as a full member and not as a protectorate
—not as a nation of "little yellow brothers" to
be cared for and exploited.
Such a move as this enables Americans to
ook at the future squarely and searchingly—
not carefully hiding a sphere from their vision
for fear of finding something unpleasant.
If action such as this continues to come from
the United Nations, there is a place for hope
and ideals in our minds. There is hope that
although war is hell, it will not have been fought
for nothing. There is hope that what our fathers
failed to do and what we are endeavoring to
do now will not have to be again undertaken
by our sons.
And there is the distant thought of an ideal
world. It is news such as this that makes men
walk up a hill under fire with shells exploding,
machine guns rattling, and smoke and flame
and death around them. It is news like this
that fosters hope—hope that when they get
to the top, past destruction, when they come
out of the smoke, they will find a soft, green,
peaceful world below.
TWO days ago the United States and Great
Britain put salve on one of the sore spots
of the world which has festered for almost 100
years.
By relinguishing their extra-territorial claims
against China, they have made a great step for
ward. Although the details of the treaty will
be withheld until formal ratification, the State
Department said that when it does become ef
fective the United States will relinguish:
(1) Extra-territorial jurisdiction; (2) special
rights accorded under the "Boxer protocol" of
1901, including the right to station troops in
China; (3) special rights in relation to the sys
tem of treaty ports and in relation to the diplo
matic quarter at Peiping and to the international
settlements at Shanghai and Amoy, including
