# It Lies
## 
### 
IF you are rushing up the Quad in front of the
library to get to lunch or to make a 12 noon
appointment, don't look at the clock on the arch
of the Quad. It lies.
It just sits there and tells lies all day. That
is almost all day. Twice every twenty-four
hours it tells the truth. When the world has
swung around on its axis so it is just four min
utes of twelve the clock tells the truth.
So don't look at the clock. It doesn't run.
