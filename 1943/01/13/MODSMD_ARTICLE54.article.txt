STANFORD may have a lot of sons in the
service, but none has come to our attention
more graphically than William J. Hoelle of the
class of '35.
Making spectacular saves of his own life
seems to be his business. First he flew his plane
so low that he hit a telephone pole and then his
plane went into a spin while only 400 feet from
the ground. Both times he was saved.
War is a grim business but William Hoelle

has our blessing and hope that if he does get
in a tight spot, hits another telephone post or
spins his plane again, things may turn out as
well for him as in the past.
