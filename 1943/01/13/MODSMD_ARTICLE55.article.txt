# OUR HASHER SEZ

If the bizarre carriage of numerous campus
dolls in the past few days is any criterion, a
short course in Modern Dance is every bit as
good a way of getting stiff as any yet concocted
by Hank, Lee, Harry, Pierre, John, or any of the
other soda-jerkers in the surrounding terrain.

He was new on the job and doing everything
with a flourish to impress his patrons, his boss,
and himself, in particular. She ordered a cup
of coffee. In two guick but nonchalant move
ments he set down in front of her a cup of
blackish, brackish liguid. It could well pass for
coffee—at least just as well as a lot of other
stuff served around here under that name. She
took a big gulp—syrup.
Moral: just because it's served in a cup, it
doesn't mean we aren't going to have a basket
ball game here Friday.

Thanks loads, Mrs. A., for the selected shorts,
but I'm afraid the junior miss size won't fit my
chair.
