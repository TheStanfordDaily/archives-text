The Editor, Sir:
Even though there is a tomato and fresh vege
table shortage, it no longer surprises me that
The Daily's Hasher chooses to remain relatively
a man of mystery. Yet, despite the truly un
printable things I have heard about him, he is,
personally, the best feature of your paper.
However, there happen to be a lot of people
(I guess they read the New Yorker) who spe
cially do not like to see a campus columnist
trying to be funny and occasionally succeed
ing. There are also those who do not like to
have their reactionary forces touched or
slapped. Like, for example, "A Member of a
Sorority" who disapproves of the piece which
your hasher wrote and dedicated to the un
lucky girls who happen to measure up to the
accepted, unchangeable expectations. Inciden
tally, that column would make a swell standard
obituary on the subject. It told the facts con
cisely and ended not unreligiously—"God Help
Them!"
The sorority sister does not like the "Daily's
policy of destructive criticism." Constructive
criticism in her delusional eyes may mean
hand-shaking and shoulder-patting. (For ex
ample, I think that constructive criticism to her
and a lot of others means something like The
Daily's recent editorial which stated that Stan
ford was really becoming war-conscious. Writ
ten unconvincingly by Bill Steif who has mys
teriously reversed his attitude toward Stan
ford's war spirit, this editorial completely be
lied the significant fact that Stanford is not any
more war-conscious than any other school be
cause Stanford is not any more war-conscious
THAN IT HAS TO BE.)
Well, the sister declares that what she and
her fellow-members wish to preserve above all
is the unity of their troop. Obviously, they are
trying to preserve something, but that's just the
trouble with it. It looks like something pre
served.
Anyway, it astonishes me that even the good
sister should be so foolish and soft as to resent
the words of the columnist who perhaps was
a little hard up for subject matter that day. So
he chose something which probably shall never
be carried any farther than he carried it. Quit
your worryin'. No one outside your own city
state takes you seriously, but you look awfully
funny trying to take yourself seriously.

However, there happen to be a lot of people
(I guess they read the New Yorker) who spe
cially do not like to see a campus columnist
trying to be funny and occasionally succeed
ing. There are also those who do not like to
have their reactionary forces touched or
slapped. Like, for example, "A Member of a
Sorority" who disapproves of the piece which
your hasher wrote and dedicated to the un
lucky girls who happen to measure up to the
accepted, unchangeable expectations. Inciden
tally, that column would make a swell standard
obituary on the subject. It told the facts con
cisely and ended not unreligiously—"God Help
Them!"
The sorority sister does not like the "Daily's
policy of destructive criticism." Constructive
criticism in her delusional eyes may mean
hand-shaking and shoulder-patting. (For ex
ample, I think that constructive criticism to her
and a lot of others means something like The
Daily's recent editorial which stated that Stan
ford was really becoming war-conscious. Writ
ten unconvincingly by Bill Steif who has mys
teriously reversed his attitude toward Stan
ford's war spirit, this editorial completely be
lied the significant fact that Stanford is not any
more war-conscious than any other school be
cause Stanford is not any more war-conscious
THAN IT HAS TO BE.)
Well, the sister declares that what she and
her fellow-members wish to preserve above all
is the unity of their troop. Obviously, they are
trying to preserve something, but that's just the
trouble with it. It looks like something pre
served.
Anyway, it astonishes me that even the good
sister should be so foolish and soft as to resent
the words of the columnist who perhaps was
a little hard up for subject matter that day. So
he chose something which probably shall never
be carried any farther than he carried it. Quit
your worryin'. No one outside your own city
state takes you seriously, but you look awfully
funny trying to take yourself seriously.

The Editor, Sir:
Even though there is a tomato and fresh vege
table shortage, it no longer surprises me that
The Daily's Hasher chooses to remain relatively
a man of mystery. Yet, despite the truly un
printable things I have heard about him, he is,
personally, the best feature of your paper.
