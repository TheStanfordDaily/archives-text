## Geary Shows Grade B Play 
### 
"THE BARBER HAD TWO SONS"
now playing at the Geary.
This play is the stage equivalent
of a grade B movie.
There is too much conventional
stage business for the play to be
much good. There is the good old
"swoon on a door" scene, a host ot
stock love scenes, and several en
trances preceded by "I wondei
where so-and-so is—why there sln
comes now."
Even the characters are stock.
There's the usual introverted artist;
an oh-so-typical sailor who makes
his first entrance by swaggering up
to the nearest pretty girl and grab
bing her; and a fat drunk with a
loud voice who does exactly what
fat drunks with loud voices always
do in plays.
Blanche Yurka is undoubtedly a
good actress, but the mother part
she has doesn't give her much to do.
The one thing that distinguishes
this play from the average is the
fact that it gets better instead ol
worse as it goes along. The first act
is absolutely dead, the second has a
little comedy to sustain it, and the
third actually has a few fairly good
dramatic scenes. But the best part
of the whole performance are the
selections from Grieg played during
intermissions.—Dillinger
