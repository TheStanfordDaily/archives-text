## Fejos Tells of Inca Marvels 
### BY BILL HORNBY 
Shangri La could be true.
Ancient Inca cities terraced onto
the faces of towering, snow-capped
mountains in the Peruvian Andes,
laid out in definite patterns which
reveal social classes, religion, com
merce, and agriculture, populated
by an inestimable number of citizens
in thousands of roofed and windowed
buildings, fortressed from whatever
foes there may have been by their
position 5,000 feet above the floors
of valleys below, erected by a civ
ilization which didn't know of the
wheel, but thought nothing of mov
ing thousands of 200-pound stone
blocks by muleback.
Dr. Paul Fejos. who led the Vik
ing Expedition which uncovered
more than eight of these Precolom
bian cities in 1940-41, told this story
to a Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night, and he proved his
words with colored slides which
outdid his own excellence as a lec
turer in bringing home the immen
sity of now-dead cultures.
Along trails a yard wide, with
rocky cliffs on one side and "5.000
feet of sheer nothing" on the other,
Fejos and his expedition followed
up the airplane surveys to discover
cities—"The Terraces of the Sun,"
"The Inaccessible City." Through
tunnels which showed definite signs
of drilling and the use of some sort
of explosive force, wound ancient
pavement which was so intact that
archaeologists attempted with some
success a bicycle ride.
And these excavations are being
reconstructed from their centuries
of burial under jangle growth that a
layman would consider as uninhab
itable, the acme of "nothingness."
If ancient men could build them,
and if searchers such as Paul Fejos
who has spent 17 years uncovering
old civilizations and lost tribes can
find them, somewhere a Shangri La
could be true.
Shangri La could be true.
