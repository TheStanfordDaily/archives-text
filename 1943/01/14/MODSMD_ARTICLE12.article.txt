# Stanford Man Writes Article On Air Force for 'Esquire"
## 
### 
J. R. Gillingham, Stanford '32 and
captain in the Army Air Forces, is
the author of an article featured in
the February issue of "Esquire"
j magazine.
Entitled "Esquire's Pocket Air
Course," the article is accompanied
by a quiz aimed at relating this war
to earlier ones and at pointing out
some of its more obvious character
istics.
Captain Gillingham illustrates in
j his article that air power is still a
! very new thing. Therefore, he says,
the greatest asset of the armchair
' strategist is an open mind.
I In his student days at Stanford,

Captain Gillingham devoted much
time to a study of the art of war,
using the facilities of the Hoover
War Library. Before entering the
forces, he was an advertising execu
tive, and, for a year and a hall,
writer-producer on KYA. He is
now stationed at Patterson Field.
Fairfield, Ohio.
