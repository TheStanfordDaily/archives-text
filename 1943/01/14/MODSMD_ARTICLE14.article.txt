# FOR VICTORY
## Patriotic Spirit Indicated by Roos Bros in Bond Sales 
### Lucy Thompson 
Lucky Strike Green has gone to war. The Stanford Red has gone to war.
and now Roos Brothers has gone to war.
No matter what color Roos Brothers uses, if any, they have gone
to war. Six men have gone into the Army from the Palo Alto store, and it
is one of the few stores in Palo Alto with a compulsory payroll savings plan.

►•Donate 10 Per Cent
Under this plan, 10 per cent of
each employee's wage is deducted
and invested in War Bonds. Accord
ing to Dave Cameron, manager of
the Palo Alto store, "This is the only
way in which any store can really
, say that its employees are actually
buying war bonds and stamps.
"Someone may forget about buy
ing bonds, accidentally or on pur
pose, if he is the one who buys the
bonds. This way everyone buys the
bonds because it is automatic, and
we know that they buy the bonds
because we do the selling.
"Under the old plan," he contin
ued, "the store merely promised
that 90 per cent of its employees
bought bonds. All of the employees
did not have to buy bonds, and there
was no requirement as to the amount
of bonds and stamps which had to
be purchased or as to the frequency
with which they had to be pur
chased.
"Everyone should buy all of the
bonds and stamps that he possibly
can," Mr. Cameron said. "It isn't a
duty, it is a privilege. It's a good
investment, it's safer, it's surer, and
it pays just as much or possibly
| more than any other comparable
way of investing your money."
Minute Man Flag
In front of the store, there is a
blue minute man flag, which is given
to all stores who promise that 90
per cent of their employees will buy
war bonds and stamps.
According to Mr. Cameron, the
Roos store will soon receive a small
white T to put on the flag. This is
given by the Treasury to all stores
and plants who are using the pay
roll savings plan.
Six Service Stars
In addition to buying war bonds
and stamps, the Roos store has had
| six men go into the Army. Perhaps
the best known of these at Stanford
is the Alpha Delt's "housemother,"
Joe Weiner.
"Mama Joe" was drafted in No
| vember 1941. He has now just
graduated from the officer candidate
training school at Fort Sill, becom
ing a second lieutenant in the field
artillery.
He was graduated second highest
in his class, and, because of this, was
assigned to duty at Fort Sill as an
instructor in the training school.
| 2nd Lt. Roos
Robert Roos, who also worked for
! a time in the Palo Alto store, has
j also just graduated from officer can
didate training school, becoming,
however, a second lieutenant in the
! infantry.
Willard Crow, Stanley Rudee, and
Ray Wilson have also left the store
for the Army. The last member to
leave is Merritt Hoge, 19, who will
j be inducted on Jan. 28.
According to Mr. Cameron, the
war has not as yet greatly affected
the quantity of merchandise avail
able. "There may be a few holes
in some lines, but we think that wc
will be able to serve everyone, at
least until April when the new sys
t tern will go into operation."
While he was president. George
Washington accepted no salary bul
only expenses that were necessary
I to the discharge of his duties.
