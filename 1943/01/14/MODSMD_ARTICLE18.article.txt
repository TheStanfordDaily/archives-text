# Quarter's Stamp, Bond Campaign Opens Today
## 
### 
Stanford's weekly drive for war
stamps and bonds for Winter Quar
ter opens today with a goal for the
quarter set at 100 per cent contribu
tion from each living group on
campus.
The War Funds Committee of the
Student War Board asks that each
student buy at least one stamp a
week throughout the quarter and as
many more as he can afford.
House and Corridor representa
tives will sell stamps in all living
groups during the clay, and com
mittee members will sell them at
booths located in the Cellar from 8
a.m. to 8 p.m., in the Libe from 8
a.m. to 10 p.m., and on Engineering
and' English corners from 8 a.m. to
3 p.m.
Total stamp and bond sales for
each quarter of the drive are as
follows:
Spring, "42 $ 7,077
Summer, '42 10.195
Autumn, '42 10,615
Grand Totalâ€” $27,8X7
Heading the representatives for
fraternities is John Thayer; for so
rorities, Diane Holmes; Men's halls,
Hill Rose; Roble, Betsy Rabbitt;
Union, Linda Rehms; Lagunita, Bev
erly Brokaw, and booths, Virginia
Patterson.
Autumn Quarter sales surpassed
those of Summer Quarter by $420;
this includes the sale of bonds as
well as stamps. To keep a more ac

curate record of the total sales, (he
tabulation of results which appeal'
in The Daily every Friday morning
will separate stamp and bond sales,
according to Vashti O'Donnell,
chairman of the War Stamp Com
mittee.
As in the past, the results will be
given in terms of the percentage of
residents in each living group con
tributing, and the amount of stamps
sold.
As the aim of the drive is to have
each man and woman at Stanford
place his savings in government se
curities, no living group, fraternity,
or sorority will be given a 300 per
cent rating unless every member
buys as least one stamp.
All stamp representatives are re
minded that any stamps bought by
members of their living group dur
ing the week as well as on Stamp
Day may be credited to the living
group.
Stamps are sold at all times at
the Post Office, the Cellar store, En
cina store, and the Bookstore.
At each booth on Stamp Day, and
in the Cellar store will be found a
stamp book for 10-cent stamps. All
stamps put in this book will be given
to the Dimes for Diploma Fund.
Representatives are requested to
turn in their sales results to their
respective heads not later than 8
p.m. tonight.
Stamp Day will be every Thurs
day throughout the quarter instead
of Wednesday.
