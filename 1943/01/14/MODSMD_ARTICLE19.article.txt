# Yanks Write a Jungle Book
## 
### 
AMERICANS who yesterday
were eating from dining room
tables, showering in tiled rooms,
sleeping late on Sundays, now
find themselves in entirely dif
ferent surroundings. Living in
a jungle and fighting the Pacific
War, Yanks are beginning to
appreciate the comforts of home
and are showing some genius
in creating a new home as
shown at the left.


AMERICAN SOLDIERS ALREADY arc used to tropical ways and are quite at home in the jungles of the
Southwest Pacific it would appear. Top. left, Corp. Verl Parmee relaxes and reads a letter from home on his
unique bed fashioned from bamhoo poles in New Guinea. Note the mosquito netting. Lower left, Capt.
Arthur L. Stanley gives a soldier attention at the New Guinea medical station. Upper right, coconut palms
serve as telegraph poles in Guadalcanal. Lower right, the Guadalcanal river doesn't stop these Marines
from stringing a communications line. As few clothes as possible is jungle style. The latest news from
Guadalcanal is that American troops, recently reinforced are on the verge of beginning a major new offen
sive. Meanwhile, up in New Guinea, the Yanks are mopping up remnants of Jap troops in the Buna and
Gona area and preparing for a new push upon Lac.


ONE THING about the jungle is soldiers soldiers have a lot of carrying to do. Here we see boxes of am
munition hems carried to fronl lines. Belts of machine gun bullets arc suspended over tree branches at the
left, ready for quick shipment to gunners.


THIS CEREMONY is familiar wherever American soldiers go. but to
the natives, well, they stand in awe as they watch the white men make
jungle manic. The Yanks are using 45-calihcr bullets for chips. The
thing that fascinates teh native most is the shuffling of the pasteboards.


HOT DINNERS arc something
luxurious after fighting in the
jungle for 11 days. This soldier w as
on the Sopota battle front in New
Guinea.


SOMKTIIINC; THAT would make life easier in the Pacific area would
be less of these. There are few Jap prisoners because most of them
prefer to light to the end. However, above are some captured by
Marines on Guadalcanal. Note the shoes. The Japs employed them to
climb trees for better sniping.
