## Reds Gain In Caucasus As Allies Bomb France 
### 
MOSCOW, Thursday, Jan. 14 (U.R)
—The Red Army captured 12 towns
and villages in the North Caucasus
yesterday and thwarted a mass on
slaught by German tanks and troops
trying to break through the Soviet
lines in the Lower Don Valley, the
Soviet High Command announced
today.
For the fh'st time since Soviet
troops burst into the Don area up
river from Rostov, the midnight
communique claimed no advance on
that front, reporting instead that all
counterattacks by powerful German
forces were hurled back, 1,000 Nazis
being killed in a single sector.
The high command had revealed
12 hours earlier that Russian shock
troops had broken out of the Stalin
grad factory area to the western
outskirts of the battered Volga city
in bloody fighting at close quarters.
The new bulletin said they con
solidated their newly won positions
yesterday and beat off numerous
German counterattacks, wiping out
400 Germans and capturing 10 field
guns and four trench mortars.
The unbroken advance of Lieut.
Gen. Ivan Maslennikov's army in
the North Caucasus was reported to
have netted one district center—
Novoselovskaya, 40 miles north of
Georgievsk—a railway station, and
10 big inhabited localities.
