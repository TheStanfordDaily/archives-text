# Farm Holds First Catastrophe Drill
## 
### 
The Stanford Civilian Defense
held its first "catastrophe" drill of
the quarter from 7 to 8 o'clock last
night. The drill involved only fac
ulty members, as rushing interfered
with student participation.
Various "incidents," such as the
blowing up of the Union unit, were
staged as a test for the communica
tions box wardens and the central
control room.
