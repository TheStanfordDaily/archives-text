# 'Little One' Pays No Tuition, Goes To Classes, Defies Rules
## 
### 
Little One is fast becoming a cam
pus personage, and although he pays
no tuition, he audits Chem Engi
neering, carouses in the Cellar, and
has week-end dates.
The Registrar probably didn't fig
ure Little One in the quarter's cen
sus, because he just doesn't fit into
any scholastic classification—neither
grad nor undergraduate.
People are beginning to say he's
an exhibitionist, as he's been seen
parading down the Quad on a
friend's shoulders. And then again
the other night, he was seen diving
out of an open window from the
filth floor of Encina.
Little One's roommate and best
friend is "Lucky" Richards, a frosh
from Hollywood. Lucky and Little
One struck up their friendship dur
ing the Christmas holidays, rode up
on the train together, have been
bosom pals ever since in Encina.
A scandalous ripple surged from
corridor 1o corridor last week when
it got around that Little One had
sneaked a girl friend into the room.
Lucky, returning unexpectedly,
found the fernrne on his chair.
When news of the affair reached
Dean Sharp, he only smiled, because
there's nothing in the rules about
pigeons bringing girl friends into
their rooms.
On the train ride, the diner ran
out of food near Salinas. When pas
sengers lit matches mumbling "roast
pigeon," Lucky proved his friend
ship by staving them off until the
Paly stop.


LUCIAN LUCKY' RICHARDS and his fan-tail pigeon, Little One,
are pictured above. The bird rides around campus 011 Lucky's shoulder
and one day when it visited Professor Weinstein's lecture, he said.
"That's the first time I've ever gotten the bird."
