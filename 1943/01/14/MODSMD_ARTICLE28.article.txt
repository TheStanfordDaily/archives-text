## Donors Must Signup Monday 
### 
Signups for the next period during
which students may contribute to
the blood bank must be made by
Monday, according to Rosamond
Fuller, head of the campus blood
bank committee.
Students may sign up in Room 14
of the Union and, if they are be
tween 17 and 21, they may also get
permission slips for their parents
to sign.
"Even though a student may have
donated before, if he is between
17 and 21 he must have a slip signed
by his parents giving permission for
him to donate his blood," Miss Ful
ler said.
"Last quarter 112 students do
nated their blood. This quarter we
hope to have more students to do
the same if possible," she said.
"Since a change has been made in
the weight requirement for donat
ers, lowering it from 115 pounds to
110 pounds, this will enable students
who were previously prevented from
contributing to give also.
"Now more than ever it is im
portant to donate blood because
now more than ever there is a de
mand for that blood. With Ameri
can soldiers going into action all
over the world, the quantity of
blood plasma which is and will be
needed has increased.
"Furthermore," Miss Fuller said,
"it is still necessary to maintain the
supply of blood in the hospitals in
the United States for use in such
emergencies as the Boston fire."
"Stanford students may sign up
to give their blood on a week from
today. These signups must be in
on Monday, but the transfusion will
not take place until Thursday," she
emphasized.
The times available to students
are 11:20. 11:40. 1:20, and 1:40. The
Motor Corps of the Palo Alto Red
Cross will transport those students
who sign up to and from the Com
