## Farm Cage Varsity Given 50-50 Chance In Opening Conference Came With SC Hottest Team Will Triumph in Fracas 
### 
Stanford has an even chance to
en its 1943 conference season and
clear the first hurdle in its path
another national championship
topping Southern Cal in the Pa
ion Friday night.
In a wartime athletic season which
s turned every major sport on the
>ast into a topsy-turvy, now-we
t-it, now-we-don't, race, it is ex
•mely probable that no team will
through this season undefeated,
'en Stanford with Pollard-Bur
•ss-Cowden couldn't get past a
ailing USC squad on a certain em
rrassing night last year.
Again in 1943 the Trojans are the
am to beat. If the locals are going
have an "off" evening somewhere
jng the way, they realize that it
id better not be against SC. The
•ojans are likely to be farther up
the standings and in more of a
isition to claim a championship la
r on than any of the other squads.
The game Friday night is not only
e first of the season; it is one of
e really crucial games, one that
ill count more in the final picture
an perhaps game number two,
ree, four, etc.
So Stanford is going to win it.
To accomplish this job the starting
leup will be composed of Jack
ana and Freddy Linari at forwards,
1 Voss at center, and Howie Dall
ar and Fred Oliver at guards.
Basketball is the most difficult of
torts to predict, and, frankly, the
t is practiced mostly as a pre-game
arm' -up for the hoop writers,
oach Everett Dean emphasized this
>int in an interview the other night,
basketball is a funny game, with
any more things than just record
id ability entering into it."
''The team that will win the game
riday night will be the hottest
am." By this Dean was not ra
onalizing; he meant that both
Iliads realize the importance of the
tming clash and they will be at
ip form, better than in any pre
ious performance. It's a 50-50 affair
om the most optimistic of outlooks.
Many things are conspiring to heat
p the Indians for this game. They
jn't like to be favorites, but, again,
icy don't like to see someone else
;come a "superteam" after a sched
le which included such topflight
laterial as DePaul and Canisius
niversity.
They feel that they are playing
•gether, traditionally termed "click -
ig,'' for the first time this year,
hey recall that this Trojan team is
I) the same team that they thor
ughly waxed when the chips were
>wn last year, with only a couple
1942 reserves to alter the picture,
I) already figuring its chances in
le NCAA final, (3) the squad which
larred that perfect record last year.
Then again they know that they
on't get another crack at SC until
ebruary 19, with many chances for
slip-up in between.
In practice last night, the Indians'
efense pleased Dean, with Leo Mc
affrey who will see plenty of guard
uty perhaps bringing the added
lark. Dean announced the loss of
ohnny Eikleman for at least two
■eeks due to an infection.
