### 
Joe DiMaggio has quit baseball.
The New York Yankees' number
one swatsman announced yesterday
he had effected a reconciliation with
his wife, the former Dorothy Arnold
of screen and radio, and would soon
enlist in some branch of the armed
forces.
DiMaggio was voted baseball's
most valuable player in 1939 and
1941. The Yanks paid Joe $42,J00
for services rendered last year. To
show he wasn't being overpaid, Di-
Maggio established a new Ameri
can League record by hitting safely
in 56 consecutive games.
Joe said his retirement would last
"for the duration."
As a New York Yankee, DiMag
gio was one of baseball's most col
orful players, a genius with a bat,
and a sensational outfielder all
wrapped into one—America's na
tional pastime must begin a new
era, for without DiMag the sport
has lost perhaps its brightest star.
