WHILE doodling on our chair yesterday in
class, we happened to think of a little
missive dated Jan. 6 that came out of the office
of the Financial Vice-President.
This letter was addressed to the "members of
the faculty and staff" of the University. Then
we thought a little more and it occurred to us
that the letter could just as well have been ad
dressed to the students of the University, also.
We stopped doodling.
It seems that the War Production Board has
issued to Stanford a thing called "Limitation
Order L-41." Now that is one of those orders
which doesn't sound very imposing but actually
is, for its effect, to quote the Financial Vice-
President, "is to bring to a stop practically all
departmental remodeling or extension of exist
ing facilities."
But Order L-41 is not the only thing with
which this letter deals. It also seems that the
University, under its priority, cannot get many
metal objects and even certain wood products
.vhich are needed for the "routine maintenance
and repairs" allowed to the University. And,
even if Stanford could get some of these mate
rials, it would have a definite manpower short
age at the Corporation Yard to deal with.
Obviously, the problem is serious.
Therefore, the thing should be faced. Stan
ford, its Quadrangle as much as its houses and
dorms, is home to well over 3,000 young men
and women as fell as its "members of the fac
ulty and staff." We young men and women are
the principal beneficiaries of Stanford's fine
physical plant. This plant is our home. And
since it's home and since we get most of the
benefits of Stanford and since it's going to be
tough for the University to keep up this plant,
it seems that we ought to do what little we can
not to destroy it.
That's why we quit doodling on our desk.—
