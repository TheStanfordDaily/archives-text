# "Joltin' Joe"
## 
### 
JOSEPH PAUL DIMAGGIO announced last
J night that he was quitting baseball "for the
duration" to join one of the services. That is
big news, and yet it is only indicative of the
fact that more and more Americans are realiz
ing that this war is total, all-encompassing.
DiMag has had his ups and downs in the
sports world. First, when he came up to the
Yankees in 1936 from the San Francisco Seals
he was heralded as a successor to the ageing
Babe Ruth. Then he was hurt, couldn't start the
season, and the clamor died down. The next
lew seasons proved that perhaps the sports
writers were right. DiMag in 1939 was voted
the American League's most valuable player,
and in 1941 this honor was again accorded him
after he had hit safely in 56 consecutive ball
games for a new major league record.
But last season the idol of ten million baseball
fans went into a bad slump. For weeks he
couldn't hit his hat, was almost booed out of
several ball parks, and had, on the whole, a
rather poor year.
But "Joltin' Joe" stayed up there and kept
swinging. That demonstrated the good old

American quality of being able to "take it." 1
That showed courage.
Now Joe has shown even more courage, has
shown that he knows which way the wind is
blowing, has shown that he wants to be a part
of that wind. He is throwing up a 542.000 a sea
son job for S5O a month. And you have to hand
it to him.
He's moved up into the biggest league of all.
