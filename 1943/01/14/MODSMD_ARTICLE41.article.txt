Willy-May, the second cook, says "Hello" to
everybody.

After reading the campus opinion column for
the past few days, it appears as though some
one was trying to start an argument, and that's
good. It builds up circulation and readership.
First, I say I can't feel sorry for girls who
don't live in sororities; then a sister says I seem
ridiculous; then Ray says the sister should
not be foolish; then this morning I say, "I can't
feel sorry for girls who don't live in sororities."
Turn to page eight tomorrow—who will speak
next? Maybe a big football hero will say, "I
think hall women are real peachy," and then
all the girls will vacate the houses.
And then again maybe Our House Mother
will say, "I don't think you have the best inter
ests of our tong at heart," and fire me.
At any rate, no matter what Our Hasher says,
rushing is going on its weary way, but that in
no way alters the fact that there is going to be
a basketball game here tomorrow night, and
you didn't get your ticket, did you? Tuff.
