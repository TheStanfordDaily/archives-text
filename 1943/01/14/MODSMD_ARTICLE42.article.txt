The Editor, Sir:
In the last few weeks we have overheard
quite a few students question the enforcement
of the Honor Code. While criticisms come to
us that students violate the code quite fre
quently, the number of cases turned in to us is
negligible in view of complaints. It is obvious,
therefore, that the students are failing to either
report the violations or to speak to the student
so that he has the opportunity of exonerating
| himself.
If signing the pledge at the end of an exami
nation does not mean to each student that he
i
; has really "given or received no unpermitted
aid," the Honor Code has failed. Perhaps if this
is the case we should return to a system of
1 proctoring.
Each student is not only responsible for his
own conduct in examinations, his academic
work, and in the proper use of the facilities here
at Stanford, but he also must assume the far
more difficult responsibility of seeing that his
fellow students are doing the same.
It seems quite possible to us that the Honor
Code has not been properly enforced because
; students fail to realize their responsibility.
Many of them do not have a clear understand
| ing of the action Men's and Women's Councils
will take if a violation is reported.
Infractions of the Honor Code are not neces
| sarily dealt with by expulsion. Each violation is
j treated individually and with due consideration
1 of type, circumstances and the student's record.
J It seems only reasonable that the council's de
i cision should emphasize Honor Code enforce
i ment, and still take the violator's future into
' serious consideration. This is our ultimate aim '
whenever we face the task of making a deci- j
sion.
Any constructive suggestions that the student
, body may have concerning the Honor Code and
the enforcement of it will be most welcome and
given due consideration.
