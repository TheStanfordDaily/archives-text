# Climaxes Fill Bill In 'Now Voyager' Reel
## 
### 
j NOW, VOYAGER, playing at the
Stanford Theater.
"Now, Voyager," in every aspect,
particularly its theme, is quite ma
ture for Hollywood; and must with
-1 out question be given place in that
! category of films which are the in
dustry's finest accomplishments.
It is somewhat too long; but it is
: never drab; for there are, in fact,
climaxes too many. These Irvin
Rapper builds with highest order
craftmanship, and they are embel
■ lished by a magnificent Stejner-
Tschaikowsky score.
The reappearance of Paul Henreid
j (Joan of Paris) was welcome to me,
and I am long since a fan of the con
j sistent performing of Bette Davis and
J Claude Rains.—Covey.
