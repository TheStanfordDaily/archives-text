# Panhellenic Issues Third Rushing Bids
## Sororities Entertain Tonight at Dinner For Frosh Women 
### 
Invitations to the third women's
rushing period are to be picked up
today in the Panhellenic Office.
Rushees must return them between
12:45 and 2 o'clock this afternoon.
The third rushing period consists
of a dinner tonight between (> and 8
p.m. when all sororities will enter
tain. Both rushees and sorority
women are to wear formals.
Hank Wallace, president of the
Panhellenic Council, stated that
neither the issuance of invitations
to the third rushing period by so
rorities nor their acceptance by
rushees is binding.
Following the rushing dinners
tonight, rushees from all over the
campus will sign preference cards in
the Roble reading room from 8 to
10 o'clock.
Pledging Tomorrow
Pledging will take place tomorrow
night. It will be followed bv open
house at all sororities from*?) to 12
o'clock.
Invitations to the second rushing
period were issued Tuesday morn
ing. It consisted of three dates,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday
nights, during which rushees were
allowed to visit as many as three
houses. Houses served dessert and
coffee.
Panhellenic Council at the start of
rush week last Friday requested the
cooperation of both Row women and
rushees in creating an informal rush
season in keeping with present con
ditions with as little distraction
from studies in time and effort as
possible.
New Informal System
In reviewing the new system, Miss
Wallace commented, "Thus far the
new informal system seems to be
more favorable than the previous
formal system.''
Of the 363 women who registered
for rushing last quarter, 32 went
minus more than five grade points,
leaving 331 eligible for rushing this
quarter.
Reversing a previous decision,
rushing of new women who have
not yet graduated from high school
was given Panhellenic approval. The
decision was made because only five
were registered.
