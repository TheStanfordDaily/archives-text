# Blood Donors Asked to Sign
## 
### 
Monday is the last day during
which students may sign up to do
nate blood to the Red Cross Blood
Bank lor the first period, according
to Rosemary Fuller, chairman of
the campus blood bank committee.
"The students who sign up by and
during Monday will actually donate
their blood on Thursday," said Miss
Fuller, "but I have to tell the mobile
unit of the blood bank how many
students to prepare for so that they
will have enough equipment."
"Monday is not the last day dur
ing which students may sign up to
give their blood during this quar
ter," she continued. "Students may
sign up on Tuesday and we will be
glad to have them do so, but they
will be volunteering to give their
blood two weeks from Thursday."
The mobile blood bank comes to
Palo Alto evt>ry two weeks, on the
first and third Thursdays of every
month. Stanford students who vol
unteer to give their blood will be
taken at 11:20, 11:40. 1:20, and 1:40.
The Red Cross Motor Corps will
transport those students to and from
the Community Center, where the
blood bank operates.
"Last quarter 112 students do
nated their blood," Miss Fuller said.
"This quarter we hope that more
students will be able to volunteer,
because the need for the blood
which they give has increased
enormously."
"A change in the weight require
ment for volunteers has been made,
reducing the limit from 115 pounds
to 110 pounds."
"All students who are between 17
and 21," she emphasized, "must have
slips from their parents giving their
permission to the donation. This
must be done for each time that
such a student donates his blood."
