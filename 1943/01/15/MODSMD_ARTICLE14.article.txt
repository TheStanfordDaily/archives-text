# Ration Stamps Expire Jan. 21
## 
### 
Motorists were warned against
hoarding gasoline ration stamps this
week by the National Automobile
Club, willi the deadline for using
them only a week away.
The first eight stamps in the ration
book will not be honored after Jan.
21.
Checking tires for air pressure at
least once a week was recommended
by the club. Regardless of how little
the car is driven, tires will lose an
average of three pounds pressure in
a week.
