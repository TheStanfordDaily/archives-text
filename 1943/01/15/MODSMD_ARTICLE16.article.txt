'"2oo Naval Pre-Flight Cadets Ar

That was the headline. It might
have been Stanford. But it wasn't.
That headline appeared in the S.C.
Daily Trojan last Wednesday morn
ing.
What effect has the arrival of
these cadets had on the University
of Southern California? What would
have happened at Stanford if the
Navy had taken over Branner Hall
as planned?
The Navy has taken over the Sig
ma Chi house on the Trojan campus,
stripping the house of all evidences
of fraternity life and rah-rah atmos
phere, converting it into barracks.
Down came the trophies, down came
the Petty girls, down came the ban
ners, and in moved the Navy.
Named for Hero
The house has been re-named
Owens Hall in honor of Jim Owens,
former S.C. football player who
served in the Navy as a radio engi
neer of famed Torpedo Squadron 8
until his death in action oft' Midway
Island.
The cadets have also taken over
Newkirk Hall, a former men's dor
mitory. The Sigma Chi's are living
temporarily in other houses on 28th
street, S.C.'s fraternity row.
The 200 naval cadets are not at
tired in brass buttons, white caps,
and navy blue, undoubtedly to the
disappointment of S.C. coeds and to
the relief of Stanford girls who felt
cheated when the Navy decided not

to move to the Farm. They wear
civilian clothes. Uniforms will be
worn, however, as soon as they be
come available.
400 More to Come
As soon as-supplies and equipment
become available, 400 more cadets
will move onto the S.C. campus.
Alter completion of a 12-week pro
gram, graduate cadets will move on
to aviation bases to complete pri
mary flight training.
The program at S.C. will include
all of the major points covered in
pre-flight school, as well as all the
necessary ground-school work re
quired of naval aviation cadets.
And the Navy's presence on cam
pus has brought Trojan students an

other excuse for things that go
wrong. S.C. undergraduates are
now claiming that the "gremlins"
have followed the cadets to Troy
and are wreaking havoc with stud
ies, grades, etc.
There must have been an awful
lot of gremlins around in that
U.C.L.A. game, eh, Troy?

'"2oo Naval Pre-Flight Cadets Ar
rive Today."
That was the headline. It might
have been Stanford. But it wasn't.
That headline appeared in the S.C.
Daily Trojan last Wednesday morn
ing.
What effect has the arrival of
these cadets had on the University
of Southern California? What would
have happened at Stanford if the
Navy had taken over Branner Hall
as planned?
The Navy has taken over the Sig
ma Chi house on the Trojan campus,
stripping the house of all evidences
of fraternity life and rah-rah atmos
phere, converting it into barracks.
Down came the trophies, down came
the Petty girls, down came the ban
ners, and in moved the Navy.
Named for Hero
The house has been re-named
Owens Hall in honor of Jim Owens,
former S.C. football player who
served in the Navy as a radio engi
neer of famed Torpedo Squadron 8
until his death in action oft' Midway
Island.
The cadets have also taken over
Newkirk Hall, a former men's dor
mitory. The Sigma Chi's are living
temporarily in other houses on 28th
street, S.C.'s fraternity row.
The 200 naval cadets are not at
tired in brass buttons, white caps,
and navy blue, undoubtedly to the
disappointment of S.C. coeds and to
the relief of Stanford girls who felt
cheated when the Navy decided not

to move to the Farm. They wear
civilian clothes. Uniforms will be
worn, however, as soon as they be
come available.
400 More to Come
As soon as-supplies and equipment
become available, 400 more cadets
will move onto the S.C. campus.
Alter completion of a 12-week pro
gram, graduate cadets will move on
to aviation bases to complete pri
mary flight training.
The program at S.C. will include
all of the major points covered in
pre-flight school, as well as all the
necessary ground-school work re
quired of naval aviation cadets.
And the Navy's presence on cam
pus has brought Trojan students an

other excuse for things that go
wrong. S.C. undergraduates are
now claiming that the "gremlins"
have followed the cadets to Troy
and are wreaking havoc with stud
ies, grades, etc.
