## Saksena Calls for Guarantee Of Indian Freedom After War 
### Joan Hodgdon 
"I believe very strongl in the
point of view of most of the t ople
of India that we must have suinp
motive to fight for before we w.
enter this war. We want a guaran
tee of freedom and independence
from England after this war rather
than a mere promise like the one of
the last war, which was not kept.
Without this guarantee that we will
be free we have no interest in tak
ing an active part in the war."
This is the statement of Mr.
Chrandra R. Saksena, who will speak
on the Indian problem at the all-
University debate sponsored by the
Debate Council and the Stanford
War Board next Wednesday evening
at 7:30 in the Memorial Auditorium.
Mr. Saksena was born in Jamaica,
where he lived until he was 21, but
since both his parents came from
India, he has always considered him
self an Indian and is deeply inter
ested in the social and political
problems of India.
Solve Own Problems.
Mr. Saksena agrees with most In
dians that their problems, social and
otherwise, must be solved by the
Indians themselves. If, however, ac
cording to Mr. Saksena, it is felt and
can be satisfactorily proved by the
rest of the world that the Indians
are not capable of self-government,
then it would be better if an Inter
national Council had control over
India.
Although many people have the
erroneous belief that the Indian
leaders are not capable of leading
their country without aid from out
side, according to Mr. Saksena, these
leaders are all highly trained and
possess knowledge of their country
and the rest of the world which will
be widely useful for effective self
governing.
Mr. Saksena has spent the last six i

! years in Brazil, where he went after
1 his graduation from Boston Univer
sity in 1936 He founded a business
idm in ist ration school, which was
fis ! s kind in Brazil.

Im t! . now at Stanford and liv
ing u' Mr. Saksena thinks
that this is the most friendly uni
versity he has ever visitd. This
friendly attitude of Stanford must
i be taken over by the whole world,
| according to Mr. Saksena, in order
that prejudices may disappear and
: peace may be established. "People
J must forget the racial makeup of an
individual and like a man for what
he is worth," declares Mr. Saksena.
Accompanied by other students
i from all corners of the earth, includ
ing Kwok Lam-Shan of China, and
George Galanis of Greece, Mr. Sak
sena will speak at the debate next
Wednesday on India's part in Post
| War World Organization.

friendly attitude of Stanford must

he is worth," declares Mr. Saksena.
Accompanied by other students

"I believe very strongl in the
point of view of most of the t ople
of India that we must have suinp
motive to fight for before we w.
enter this war. We want a guaran
tee of freedom and independence
from England after this war rather
than a mere promise like the one of
the last war, which was not kept.
Without this guarantee that we will
be free we have no interest in tak
ing an active part in the war."
This is the statement of Mr.
Chrandra R. Saksena, who will speak
on the Indian problem at the all-
University debate sponsored by the
Debate Council and the Stanford
War Board next Wednesday evening
at 7:30 in the Memorial Auditorium.
Mr. Saksena was born in Jamaica,
where he lived until he was 21, but
since both his parents came from
India, he has always considered him
self an Indian and is deeply inter
ested in the social and political
problems of India.
Solve Own Problems.
Mr. Saksena agrees with most In
dians that their problems, social and
otherwise, must be solved by the
Indians themselves. If, however, ac
cording to Mr. Saksena, it is felt and
can be satisfactorily proved by the
rest of the world that the Indians
are not capable of self-government,
then it would be better if an Inter
national Council had control over
India.
Although many people have the
erroneous belief that the Indian
leaders are not capable of leading
their country without aid from out
side, according to Mr. Saksena, these
leaders are all highly trained and
possess knowledge of their country
and the rest of the world which will
be widely useful for effective self
governing.
Mr. Saksena has spent the last six i

! years in Brazil, where he went after
1 his graduation from Boston Univer
sity in 1936 He founded a business
idm in ist ration school, which was
fis ! s kind in Brazil.
