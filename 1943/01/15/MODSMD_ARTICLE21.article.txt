# Maternity Fund Is Abandoned
## 
### 
Establishment of a trust fund to
be used as a maternity fund for
wives of Stanford University pro

Bank.
The provision was made in a will,
dated July 23, 1929, by the late Zerah
Yates Howard of Redwood City,
vice-president of a San Francisco
shipping firm, who died Dec. 24. His
will, valued at from $4,000 to $10,000,
would be used for the maternity
fund in the event his wife died be
fore him. However, his wife is still
living and the project has been aban
doned.
