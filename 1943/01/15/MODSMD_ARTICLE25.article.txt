# Campus to Vote Wednesday On Constitutional Amendments
## 
### 
Stanford's student body will vote j
next Wednesday on the most exten
sive amendments to the student
body constitution in many years.
The amendments, which were
published last week and are reprint
ed today, are submitted to the stu
dents as a workable plan for the
duration of the war and not as a
drastic revision of the previous con
stitution.
They were prepared by a revision
committee headed by Bob Hammett,
•who incorporated many of the sug
gestions made by a previous group
]ed by Harry Horton. Executive
Committee last night set the election
date at Jan. 20, next Wednesday,
and will combine the freshman class
elections with it.
If these amendments are passed,
the regular winter election set for
Feb. 10 will be combined with the
elections normally held in Spring
Quarter. This is in accord with the
changes in the amendments.
Since four quarters of service
imposes an unfair burden and two
quarters are insufficient for ex
perience, a three-quarter term is
the choice of the committee. A
plan has been developed which
provides for such a term (includ
ing Summer Quarter) and assures
staggered shifts, hut does not re
quire a summer election, when
the enrollment is low.
Although representation on Ex
;om on a class basis is apparently
outmoded, the present methods and
titles have been retained for con
venience. The members now are
actually members at large because
the entire student body votes on
:hem. The division by units will
assure a cross section of the student
body on Excom.
The official notice of the changes
follows.
