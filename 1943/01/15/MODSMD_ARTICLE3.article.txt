The third rushing period for men

This is the next to last rush period
before preference dinners next Fri
day. The fourth and final period
will include meals on Tuesday and
Thursday of next week.
"Informal contact" between frosh
and fraternity men, permitted by In
terfraternity rules, has been mov
! ing ahead at a rapid rate. Traffic at
the corner by the Encina store has
j been increasing as rushing gets into
full swing.
Frosh are reminded by Lee Peake,
Interfraternity president, that no
pledge is binding until formal pledge
day.
Fraternities, meanwhile, are going
' ahead with plans for dances and
open houses on Formal Pledge Day,
Jan. 23. There will be no joint
Pledge Prom given by the fraterni
ties this year, following the prece
dent set by last year's Interfraternity
Council which canceled the tradi
tional dance.

Saturday, and the second week of
open houses and rushing will begin
with Sunday dinner.
Rushing cards will be sent out to
frosh for next week's periods, al

ing open house for men who wish
to drop in, according to Ray Ham
mett, Interclub Council president.
