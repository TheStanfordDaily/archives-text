# New Lights, Paint, Beautify Ad Building
## 
### 
There've been some changes ma do
in the Ad Building.
To improve the lighting in the ap~
pointment service office, a new ceil
ing has been constructed and addi
tional lights installed.
In contrast to the pale complex
ion of the new ceiling, the floor of
the Registrar's Office has been given
a golden tan via a fresh coat of
brown paint.
