Tonight we meet the Terrible
Trojan from the Southland in our
first conference basketball game for
the Southern Division champion
ship.
If all the Stanford people had ac
cess to the Southern California
propaganda, and were receptive to
:t, they would be led to believe that
there was absolutely no object in
playing tonight's game.
Because the Terrible Trojan has
won five out of six games on its
eastern barnstorming tour and has
already dumped California, they be
.ieve they are going to walk off with
the title. But things aren't going to
go that way.
The victory over California wasn't
too easy. In fact, they gave Ernie
Holbrook's team a real run for the
money. Then, lowly U.C.L.A. beat
Cal the next night. That didn't make
the U.S.C. triumph any too brilliant.
Indian Machine
From the reports that Coach Ev
erett Dean gave out concerning the
Indians' pre-conference showing,
we should have nothing to worry
about. The team is beginning to
function as a well-oiled machine,
and tonight we should see a fast
breaking, smooth ballclub.
Certainly the Cards can match
anything the Southerners bring to
the Pavilion. We have height,
speed, and shooting ability. And to
top it all off, we've got the best in
coaching that can be obtained any
where.

In the opening column I promised
to talk about things that didn't nec
essarily concern sports. Here's one,
but then again, it may be called
sports to some devotees of I lie art.
I guess that you realize that war,
and tire and gas rationing are going
to cut down on a lot of the base
pleasures of life, and things that you
vised to travel a long distance to do
will now be done at home.
The Bushes Are Gone
Have you noticed the Inner Quad?
Well, the shrubbery in the islands
have been manicured down to the
roots. This is disastrous. Once upon
y time the foliage was nice and tall,
and freshman girls liked to boast
how, when walking home from the
Western Civ libe with some good
looking frosh football star, they
would stop at one of the islands anil
sit down on the benches so nicely
provided for them by the University.
Then they would talk things over,
mostly about ancient Thebes, or the
complicated passages in Randall, or
Rousseau, or Thorstein Veblen, or
Bertrand Russell.
But now those days have passed,
and I bet a serious problem has been
caused by it too. And the moon
would be so pretty tonight after the
basketball game!
