# TROJANS 2 TO 1 FAVORITES TONIGHT
## Farm Opens P.C.C. Year As Underdog 
### BILL HORNBY 
With the chips down and against
its squad for the first time in the
1943 season, Stanford translates its
hopes of another championship bas
ketball team into action against the
University of Southern California
tonight at 8 o'clock in the Pavilion.
Troy is favored, 2-1.
Stanford freshmen meet Menlo
J.C. in a preliminary at 6:30 p.m.
Eyes of basketball fans along the
entire Pacific Coast will be pointed
toward Palo Alto tonight, for Ernie
Hoibrook's "superteam" from the
south has been picked as the team
to win. Everett Dean's Indians are
considered the squad that has the
best chance of all conference teams
to stop a Trojan sweep.
Three Key Men
Two months ago Stanford was
generally conceded the top posi
tion. Then while the Indians, minus
three key men, were having a slow
time getting onto their new feet,
they met opposition that was not
only better than themselves, but also
better than any in the United States.
Two games with St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, one each with Great Lakes
and Illinois, brought defeat; against
Santa Clara the Indians scraped by
with a one-basket win.
Meanwhile the Trojans swept
through several prelims, then won
five out of six on a Christmas barn
storming spree. Their record: lost
to De Paul, 47-49, then trounced
Lawrence Tech, 63-44; Canasius, 42-
25; LIU, 48-40; Temple, 47-35; and
Washington University of St. Louis,
39-31. They opened their confer
ence season by whipping Cal, 39-32,
last week-end, and they travel to
Berkeley tomorrow night, in all
probability to repeat that victory.
Trojans Determined
So it's a confident, speedy, deter
mined Trojan horse against a po
tentially excellent but at present un
certain Stanford Indian in a game
which may very likely be the key to
the entire conference story this sea
son, even though it is the first of
the year.
An Indian victory means re
turned confidence and the very
probable beginning of another vic
tory ride.
Challenger Favored
I A Trojan victory means a strong
likelihood that they will finish out
the season as complete masters of
the hoop situation. The old story
of. a favored challenger against a
worried champion.
Practice sessions for the Indians
last night tapered off with light
shooting drill, and Coach Dean feels
that the squad, which looked like
the champs of last year for the first
time against Illinois in the second
half two weeks ago, "is rapidly
rounding into shape."
Trojans Lose Gossard
Loss to the Trojans of Captain
Ted Gossard with a pulled muscle
produced little elation in a Stanford
Indian camp which learned defi
nitely for the first time tonight that
Dave Brown, sophomore guard and
a much-needed reserve, will play no
more basketball this year. A heavy
study schedule forced the brightest
light of last year's frosh squad to
end his Farm hoop career, probably
for the duration.
Trojans arrive this morning, quar
tering at San Jose until game-time.
The lineups:
STANFORD U.S.C.
Linari F Rock
Dana F Omalev
Voss C Seminoff
Dallmar G Perkins
Oliver G Bailey
