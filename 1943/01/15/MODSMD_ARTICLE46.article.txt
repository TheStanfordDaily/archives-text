# Frosh Meet Menlo J.C. In Cage Tilt
## 
### 
Favored to hang up their initial
win of the season, Stanford's Frosh
cage artists meet Menlo J.C. to
night at 6:15 in the Pavilion. The
game is billed as a prelim for the
varsity-USC skirmish.
Coach Woody Weir sent the Pa
peese through an easy, one hour
workout yesterday, stressing free
throw shooting and defense. The
Indians were woefully weak in both
these departments against Paly High
Wednesday.
Commenting on the Frosh-Paly
game, Weir stated his charges would
have won had not their corner
shooting been off. "Neither our
guards nor forwards, except for
Davidson, could hit the basket from
the floor. The boys are all good
shots, though, and I expect them to
start scoring against Menlo,". he
said.
Strong Viking Defense
Weir was high in praise of Paly's
squad, winner of 33 straight games.
The Vikings set up an aggressive
zone defense which completely
throttled any aspirations the Pa
peese guards had of scoring from
far out. The Indians got most of
their goals from under the basket.
The same starting lineup used
against Paly will open tonight.
Dave Davidson, high point man
against the Vikings with 13, and
Hugh West, whose favorite corner
shot failed him against Paly, will
start at forwards. Big Dick Berlin
will hold down the center spot,
while Jack Davis and Jack Coppage
will go at guards.
Menlo Mystery
As far as Weir is concerned, Men
lo is a mystery. Only local knowl
edge of the Junior College team is
that they managed to win the con
solation title in a recent J.C. tour
nament.
Latest Frosh schedule change has
been the addition of Lowell High
School, which was signed for a
game tomorrow afternoon at 3 in the
Pavilion. Lowell was supposed to
come down a week ago, but can
celled the game.
