# The 						Constitution

IF all of the students who read completely the
constitutional amendments as printed in to
day's Daily got together, they would probably
have difficulty finding a fourth for bridge. Yet
these proposed changes will be voted upon by
the student body at a special election next Wed
nesday and their adoption will reorganize the
slection system.
Since the voters would have to devote the
entire morning to reading the ballot and print
ing costs would be tremendous, the ballot will
contain only a brief summary of the amend
ments. Instead, the complete version as printed
odaw will make another appearance in The
Daily on election day, the last time the voter
will see it becore he marks an X in the "Yes"
or "No" box.
The whole proposal'is not as horrifying nor
diflicult as it may look in print, however. It
simply embodies what the revision Committee
regards as a workable plan for the duration,
drawn up to meet the situation created by the
student government's going on a four-quarter
schedule.
In place of the traditional yearly terms of
office, the amendments would set up three-quar
ler terms. It was thought that four quarters of
service would be an unfair burden at this time
and that the student might graduate while in
office. Two-quarter terms were discarded be
cause they were too short for continuity and re
quired quarterly elections for the staggered
turnover of officers.
The three-quarter term was the answer, but
it would sometimes necessitate an election in
Summer Quarter, when the enrollment is re
duced. By some miraculous manipulation, the
committee has come forth with a plan which
provides for a three-quarter term, yet retains
staggered shifts and eliminates summer elec
tions. And it's not done with mirrors.
It is done by selecting officers at "A" and
'B" elections according to a schedule which
repeats itself every three years. Officers chosen
in the "A" election in the spring of 1944 and
in the "B" election of 1943 and later correspond
ing elections will not take office until the fol
lowing fall, since the balloting ordinarily would
take place in the summer.
Officers included in the "A" election are
president, vice-president, graduate member,
senior man, senior woman, junior woman, and
sophomore man on Excom, two members of
men's and women's councils, president of
Women's Conference, and one man on the
B.A.C. "B" election offices include graduate
member, junior man, sophomore woman, and
member-at-large of Excom, one B.A.C. member,
three members of the councils, and class posi
tions.
Although these terms are continuous and may
run through summer quarter, an officer may
have an alternate serve for one quarter of his
term without losing office. In case of any
vacancy for only one quarter, Excom will be
empowered to name a substitute from among
the unsuccessful candidates for the office in the
order of their votes.
Last year, a drastic revision of the A.S.S.U.
was proposed, including a suggestion that Ex
com's class representation was outmoded and
should be put on a member-at-large basis. This
year s committee decided to retain the present

system and titles for convenience. Actually,
Excom representatives are already members at
large, since they are elected by all the stu
dents.
If two-thirds of those voting in the election
Wednesday favor the amendments, what will
be the immediate effect of the change?
Under the new system, both an "A" and a
"B" election will be required this quarter, the
latter of which would ordinarily have been held
last quarter. "B" officers will therefore begin
serving immediately, but "A" officers will not
take office until next quarter.
The committee has done its duty; you can do
the rest by voting "Yes" on V/ednesday.â€”
