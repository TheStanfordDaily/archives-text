# Stanford Over S.C.
## 
### 
THE Stanford Indians will open their season
in the Pavilion tonight against a very tough
rival.
Both Stanford and the University of Southern
California sent their teams East during Christ
mas vacation. The S.C. boys returned with a
bright record of wins. The Indian five was not
so bright. But then too the Indians played two
of the best teams in the nation.
It doesn't matter who is the favorite going into
the game—the Indians will put up a good fight
and might even upset their highly touted op
ponents. But just the same they need your
support and cheers when the baskets are
needed.
Come to the game tonight and cheer.
