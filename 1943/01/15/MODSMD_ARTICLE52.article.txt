Last Sunday in a quiet lava bed on the other
side of Mongo, Flash Gordon leaped 30 feet to
establish a new universal broad jump record.
The old record of 26 feet 8 ! 4 inches was made
by Jesse Owens of Earth back in 1935. Although
the proper number of accredited A.A.U. offi
cials were not present and there was no wind
gauge near the pit, it is believed that Gordon's
leap will be approved at the next meeting of
the I.A.A.F. on Saturn in 1944, since Queen
Desira, herself, signed the application.

Reprinted from THE STANFORD DAILY, Jan.
14, 1943:
Various "incidents," such as the blowing
up of the Union Unit, were staged as a test
for the communications box wardens and the
central control room.
Let's get these wrinkles ironed out. We can't
afford to test very often.
