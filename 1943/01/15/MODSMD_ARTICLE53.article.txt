TRIBUTE TO STANFORD FLYING INDIANS
'Twas the night before Christmas,
And all through the house
Not a creature was stirring,
Not even a mouse.
Most folks lay a-dreaming,
But I, like a goose,
Just couldn't sleep for thinking
Of my little papoose
And of all of those brave young Indians
Who once roamed the Farm:
Men now, and up there flying
Just to keep us safe from harm.
With those thoughts came reassurance,
Pride and love all in a heap;
I knew I'd have no cause for worry,
So smiling I dropped off to sleep.
