### 
SACRAMENTO. Jan. 14 UJ.R)â€”
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, Chancel
lor of Stanford University, today
advocated that each California
family be allowed to have "a
hoard of food" since the state is in
a combat area.
Speaking before .the State Coun
cil of Defense, of which he Ls a
member, Wilbur declared that
the "hoards" of food should be
kept on hand in case of grave
emergency. Also, he said, Cali
fornians do not have the time or
gasoline in wartime to "buy by the
can what they should buy by the
case."
He recommended that the coun
cil advocate Larger purchases of
food by California residents in
conferences with federal agencies,
although he said he knew the
council "would have to struggle
against national policy."
