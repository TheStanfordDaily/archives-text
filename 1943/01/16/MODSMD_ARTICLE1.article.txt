# Dallmar Stars As SC Swamps Indians, 41-32
## 
### 
Eight field goals in the first 10!
minutes of play by U.S.C.'s Genej
Rock and Alex Omalev paved the
way for a 41-32 victory for the Tro-!
Jans and defeat for the defending I
national championship squad of
Stanford last night in the Pavilion.
Rock, small but clever forward for
the league-leading southerners, sank
four field goals at the very outset
of the game from 20 feet out; then
his teammate, Omalev, playing the
right forward position, started to
show his skill by duplicating Rock's
feat.
Stanford came back to life, and
quick goals by Jack Dana, Ed Voss,
and Howie Dallmar, the most out
standing player on the floor, put
Stanford back into contention, after
trailing 21-3. In fact, so good was
the tightened Indian defense, that
all the visitors could make before
half-time was a lonely free throw,
while Stanford got a total of 15.
Exclusive of free throws, Rock and
Omalev scored all of the Trojan
points the first half, except for a
tip-in by center Jim Seminoff.
After five minutes of play, U.S.C.
Captain, Ted Gossard, was forced
out of the game on fouls, and with
eight minutes to go, Dallmar left
the game for Stanford for the same
reason.
The Indians had control of the
ball and rebounds throughout the
second half, and crept up to within
two points, at 27-29, due mainly to
field goals by Dana and Tom Fuller,
who came in for Fred Linari.
But just when things started to
look good for Stanford, Rock and
Omalev went to work again, and
started sinking goals from 20 and
30 feet out.
Dallmar was brilliant throughout
on defense and offense. On defense
he consistently broke up Trojan
plays, and controlled the backboard.
