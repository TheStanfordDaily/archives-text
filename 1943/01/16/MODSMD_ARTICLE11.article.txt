# ROW FATIGUE
## Campus Women "Thank the Gods Of Pan-Hellenic That It's Over" 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Best universal comment uttered currently by campus women on the
past week of rushing is "Thank the gods of Pan-Hellenic it's over."
Yes, it has come and gone, the week when Roble women and their '46
classmates from Lagunita and Ventura and the Union houses had a chance
to become better acquainted with the other half of upper-class women,
those living on the Row.

t periods, felt a congenial pull toward
j one group or another on Lasuen and
they constitute the some 100 neo
phytes that are "coming out" and be
ing welcomed on the Row tonight.
Glad It's Over
But Hall women, Row women and
; freshman women are glad it's over.
- Hall women will appreciate seeing
i their friends again. When it comes'
i to conscious women on the Quad the
| past week, they have come down al
: most to the original 500 in number,
J and the Hall women are tired of
1 carrying the burden.
Phi Beta Phi is the oldest woman's
fraternity in the United States.

On each of seven nights, while;
Greek letter women pressed their j
best dresses and memorized heaven's
gift to upperclassmen, the freshman
handbook, the Robleites, low on
changes in quad clothes, made stra- ;
tegic swaps. (The girl down the:

wearing her best friend's orange
suit.)
Helpful Hints

' undercurrent of auxiliary thought!
i concerning helpful hints on small
j talk, thoughts that usually left them j
j at the last minute with nothing on
1 their minds but the weather, Roble j
1 the weather, classes, and a devout j
I wish that the football season was ]
Winter Quarter because it's such a
I good subject .
No more worries about being in a
fog on the way to the houses and j
I hoping that the resulting coiffure i
would remind someone of B. Frazier
or V. Lake but knowing it wouldn't.
In fact, no more worries, if there
! were many worries. Prom reports
lon all sides, this has been a year
unique in its lack of "Roble hysteria."
Sponsors have claimed this ideal
condition in years gone by, but for
1 the first time, appearances substan
tiate their claims. Apparently the
j majority have realized that "rush-
1 ing", as everything else on campus,
j is secondary to a bigger situation out
ride the Farm.
Wires Busy
There haven't been as many phone
1 calls this year, telephone wires were j
busy, and there haven't been as many |
1 advisory family committees hi the
Roble lobby, no tires, no gasoline,
j and the family busy at home.

has looked over the house where
mother was president in '17, and the
I house that the girl across the street
1 went several years ago, and, in pass- !
ing, looked over the house that dad
