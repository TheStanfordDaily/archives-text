# A.O. Pi's Lead Row In Pledges in '42
## 
### 
With a pledge class of 19 women,
Alpha Omicron Pi gathered the lau
rels on the Row last year with the
largest group of neophytes. It was
the first time in ten years that Alpha
Omicron Pi had received this dis
tinction.
Kappa Kappa Gamma pledged 17
women to place second, and Tri-
Delts and Alpha Phis followed close
ly in that order.
Last year 125 women joined houses
to mark the largest all-sorority sweep
since 1934. That year all records
were smashed when 138 rushees
pledged. The Alpha Phis took stellar
honors with a class of 24 members.
Recognition for the largest pledge
class has been won twice each by
Kappa, Gamma Phi, Deegee, and
Alpha Phi. and once each by Tri-
Delt and Chi Omega.
The average annual pledge class
for the past ten years is 100.
The number of pledges this year
was very even in comparison with
past years.
