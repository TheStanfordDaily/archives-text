# RUSHING
## New System Change Caused By War Impact 
### 
The rushing system used this year
is essentially the same as that used
for the first time last year, accord
ing to Margaret Wallace, Pan-Hell
enic Council President. "We have
merely modified and adapted the
system devised by Barbara Rapp,
last year's Pan-Hellenic President, to
fill our particular needs this year,
Miss Wallace stated.
The impact of the war, according
to the Pan-Hellenic President, was
the primary reason for a number of
the changes made this year and, in
addition, it was felt that a few of
the rough edges of last year's system
needed to be smoothed off.
Among the changes made was the
intensification and shortening of the
rush periods. Thus, with the excep
tion of the invitational teas held
near the end of fall quarter, all wo
men's rushing has been crammed in
to the past week.
Another change which has given
more responsibility to the three of
ficers of the Council, has been the
abolition of a Pan-Hellenic advisor.
This has meant that the secretary,
Barbara Slaughter, and vice-presi
dent, Betty Griffin, of Pan-Hellenic,
have had to assume many more
duties than usual during the rushing
period this year.
Also, this year, more informality
and naturalness has been added to
the rushing program by the abolition
of all rushing dinners but one and
by changing the rules as to "what to
wear." Formerly, dressy street clothes
were in order, but this year, accord
ing to Miss Wallace, all rushing save
at last night's dinner has been done
in Quad clothes —a change which has
loosened up rushing and made it
much more informal.
Pan-Hellenic Council this year
also broke precedent in that it cut
the individual rush periods from two
hours to an hour and a half. Fur
thermore, it was decided to run two
periods in a day, so that the last
week has witnessed Roble women
streaming up the Row before and
after dinner.
Two other changes of significance
were that rushing for Junior Trans
fers was held during the autumn so
that those girls pledged could move
into their houses at the beginning
of winter quarter. In previous years
Junior Transfer rushing has always
been deferred at least one quarter
and has had the result that those
girls pledged could not move into
their houses until spring quarter.
Ten girls were pledged in Junior
Transfer rushing last fall.
The other change noted was that
all penalties for illegal contacts be
tween new, non-sorority, Stanford
women and sorority women would be
subject to the discretion of the three
officers' of Pan-Hellenic Council.
Aside from these, sorority rushing
this year was run much as it was
last year with the Pan-Hellenic of
fice in the Woman's Clubhouse as
the coordination center for the whole
procedure.

rush periods. Thus, with the excep
tion of the invitational teas held
near the end of fall quarter, all wo
men's rushing has been crammed in
to the past week.
Another change which has given
more responsibility to the three of
ficers of the Council, has been the
abolition of a Pan-Hellenic advisor.
This has meant that the secretary,
Barbara Slaughter, and vice-presi
dent, Betty Griffin, of Pan-Hellenic,
have had to assume many more
duties than usual during the rushing
period this year.
Also, this year, more informality
and naturalness has been added to
the rushing program by the abolition
of all rushing dinners but one and
by changing the rules as to "what to
wear." Formerly, dressy street clothes
were in order, but this year, accord
ing to Miss Wallace, all rushing save
at last night's dinner has been done
in Quad clothes —a change which has
loosened up rushing and made it
much more informal.
Pan-Hellenic Council this year
also broke precedent in that it cut
the individual rush periods from two
hours to an hour and a half. Fur
thermore, it was decided to run two
periods in a day, so that the last
week has witnessed Roble women
streaming up the Row before and
after dinner.
Two other changes of significance
were that rushing for Junior Trans
fers was held during the autumn so
that those girls pledged could move
into their houses at the beginning
of winter quarter. In previous years
Junior Transfer rushing has always
been deferred at least one quarter
and has had the result that those
girls pledged could not move into
their houses until spring quarter.
Ten girls were pledged in Junior
Transfer rushing last fall.
The other change noted was that
all penalties for illegal contacts be
tween new, non-sorority, Stanford
women and sorority women would be
subject to the discretion of the three
officers' of Pan-Hellenic Council.
Aside from these, sorority rushing
this year was run much as it was
last year with the Pan-Hellenic of
fice in the Woman's Clubhouse as
the coordination center for the whole
procedure.
The rushing system used this year
is essentially the same as that used
for the first time last year, accord
ing to Margaret Wallace, Pan-Hell
enic Council President. "We have
merely modified and adapted the
system devised by Barbara Rapp,
last year's Pan-Hellenic President, to
fill our particular needs this year,
Miss Wallace stated.
The impact of the war, according
to the Pan-Hellenic President, was
the primary reason for a number of
the changes made this year and, in
addition, it was felt that a few of
the rough edges of last year's system
needed to be smoothed off.
Among the changes made was the
intensification and shortening of the
rush periods. Thus, with the excep
tion of the invitational teas held
near the end of fall quarter, all wo
men's rushing has been crammed in
