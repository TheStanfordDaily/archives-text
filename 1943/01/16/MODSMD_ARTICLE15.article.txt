# CAMPUS OPINION
## Streamlined Rushing Program Results in Praise, Criticism 
### 
As Stanford's compact, stream
lined rushing draws to an exhausted
close, both positive and negative re
actions to the new system introduced
this year have been expressed among
campus women.
Approval of subordinating the
much discussed evils of the rushing
system to as minor a role as feas
ible, including only eight dates in
seven days, has been voiced on all
sides. General opinion is in agree
ment with Pan-Hellenic's attempt to
place rushing dates below studies
and the war effort in importance.
The shortening of dates from
two to one and one-half hrrnrs has
been accepted. Both Row women
and rushees have been glad to
have "tea and small talk" at a
minimum on week nights, and so
rorities are inclined to speak of
small - morning - hour rush meet
ings in the same breath with ny
lons and rubber tires.
The shorter evenings have made
it possible to squeeze the dates
which once covered a two-week per
iod into seven days. Rushees have
been given no breathers between
periods this year and have had to
make up their minds which houses
to accept in just a few hours.
However, from the houses comes
the feeling that the new system is
easier on them than on the new
women. Most sororities would like
to have had the program arranged
to include another preference din
ner.
Since the one dinner this year was
not binding either way, the general
opinion is that rushees were at a
disadvantage being able to carry just
one house at the last. The sorori
ties could have more confidence as
to the outcome than the new women.
Definite approval of the infor
mality achieved this year has
been shown. Women have enjoyed
the unstrained atmosphere creat
ed by Quad clothes and desserts
instead of dinners.
All in all, though women directly
concerned with rushing will be glad
to return to normal college routine,
including more time to sleep and
study, Pan-Hellenic's completely re
vised system has fitted the spirit
of the times.
The program has worked smooth
ly, amazing enough for an idea con
ceived on paper, and although the
results may not be perfect, they are
gratifying to a system trying to elim
inate the criticized evils.
