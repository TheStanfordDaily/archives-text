Asked her opinion of this year's
rushing, Miss Margaret Wallace,
President of Pan-Hellenic Council
for this year, made the following
statement:
"The new rushing system adopted
last year centering around the use
of the Pan-Hellenic office to further
cooperation between the Row and
new women has once again proved
highly successful. The formality of
last year's system was considerably
modified with the elimination of
dinners, formal clothes and an overly
long, rush period. Prom the point of
view of the Row, this informal, less
expensive entertainment has been a
considerable improvement over the
old method.
"I believe that thus year's rush
period has been unusually clean and
believe that the sororities, in pledg
ing a larger number of Stanford wo
men than ever before, will be adding
their bit toward the alleviation of
the campus housing problem. I wish
to thank the sororities, the sponsors
in Roble, and the freshman women
for their cooperation in meeting dead
lines and for their generally fine at
titude in making this year's system
work. Also, I especially want to
thank Betty Griffin and Barbara
Slaughter, Vice-President and Sec
retary-Treasurer, r&spectively, of
Pan-Hellenic Council, for their un
tiring work in the Pan-Hellenic of
fice."
