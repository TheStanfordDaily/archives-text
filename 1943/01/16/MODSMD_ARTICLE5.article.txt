# Sororities to Show "Nuggets" Tonight
## 
### 
The Rare Mineral Society of Up
per and Lower Lasuen Is tonight
holding a series of newly acquired
nuggets. The latest additions to the
collection will be on display to the
public from 9 to 12 p.m. in the va
rious chapters of the society.
I Climaxing a condensed wartime
women's rushing period, nine Stan
ford sororities are entertaining the
11.7 part of the ration in the tradi
i tional open houses at which even the
! refreshments yield to the pledges
; as the main item of interest.
i
In most of the sororities, the open
! houses will follow formal pledging
so that sparkling pins will be regula
tion equipment for the new Row wo
men. After the last male has de
parted, the former rushees and the
lex-rushers will concentrate on con
tinuing the friendships begun over a
tea cup last fall.
Having spent the night at the
i houses of their choice, more than a
| hundred Stanford sorority pledges
will return to their present living
groups tomorrow to end this year's
women's rushing.
