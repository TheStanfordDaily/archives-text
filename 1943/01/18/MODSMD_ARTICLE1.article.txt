Part of an Army pre-induction specialists training program which may
revolutionize American education now and after the war was revealed yes
terday when Dr. It. Will Burnett, assistant professor of education, left for
Washington, D.C., to assist in its preparation.
Taking leave of absence for the Winter Quarter, Dr. Burnett went to
Washington as a member of the Pre-induction Training Section of the
Services of Supply, Headquarters of the War Department. lie expects to
return April 1.
Object of the pre-induction program is to train high school and lower
division students in skills to meet demands of the armed forces for special
ists. After the war, the plan may provide the basis for far-sighted voca
tional training courses.
Duties of the corps of pre-induction directors now gathered in
Washington will be to contact representatives of the services to learn
their needs and requirements for specialist training, then to prepare
the curriculum materials and suggestions for schools.; Dr. Burnett
will prepare materials for science education. His position at Stanford
was director of science education in the curriculum division of the
School of Kducation.
"Sixty-three of every 100 men who enter service are ma'de specialists in
one field or another," Dr. Burnett said. "The Army has discovered that
once it inducts these men it has time to give them only brief crowded
courses in the basic sciences and mathematics which they need. Conse-

I quently, high school and junior college courses must be streamlined with
reference to war problems in order to give the equivalent of Army training,
; cutting out the dead wood and leaving only the essentials."
This means, he explained, that physics classes will not go through
, the traditional experiments on motion and velocity, but will instead
| study them in relation to aviation and airplane motors and other war
problems. Hygiene classes will be modified to emphasize mental and
physical health during wartime, including first aid and correct diet.
In addition, social science classes will be reorganized to stress consumer
education and a real understanding of the causes of war. "We are much
better fighters when we know what we are fighting for," Dr. Burnett de
clared.
j The pre-induction plan calls for early decision on the part of each high
I school student as to which specialized field of Army training he is best
fitted to succeed in.
The vast potentialities of the pre-induction program for vocational
training of youth after the war were stressed by Dr. Burnett. Careful
selection of vocations and intelligent training toward those skills would
go far in solving post-war employment problems, he said.
Dr. Burnett, who came to Stanford in 1941, is a graduate of the University
|of Kansas. He received his advanced degrees at Columbia University,
where he joined the staff as a research associate in teacher problems in
| science education. He had been consulting with the pre-induction section
! last quarter before joining its staff in Washington.
