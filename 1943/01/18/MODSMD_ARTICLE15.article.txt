# BASKETBALL ROUNDUP
## Varsity Loses to S.C.; Frosh Win Twice in Weekend Games 
### Ed Luce 
While their big brothers were
dropping the Coast Conference cur
tain raiser to U.S.C., 41-32, Stanford's
Frosh cagers easily whipped Menlo
J.C., 37-24, Friday night, and then
came back Saturday afternoon to
smother Lowell with a second-half
barrage, 31-23.
FROSH, MENLO
The Papeese looked like a new
ball club against Menlo, passing well,
checking correctly on defense, and
scoring often from the far court.
Dave Davidson and Hugh West tied
for scoring honors with 12 points
apiece. Davidson, Dick Berlin, and
Jack Coppage kept the Freshmen in
control of the ball most of the time
with excellent backboard play,
FROSH. LOWELL
Woody Weir's charges seemed a
little tired in the Lowell contest, and
kept the pace of the game unusually
slow. West, however, stayed hot
enough from the Menlo game to tally
14 points for scoring honors. Berlin
dumped in three field goals and a
free throw for seven.
The high school boys led the Pa
peese, 13-12, at the half, mainly on
the strength of a cut-off play which

j found a Lowell forward repeatedly i
clear under the basket. The Frosh j
came out in the second half with j
I instructions from Weir as to how to (
i stop the play, and with West pour- j
| ing three consecutive field goals j
j through the netting, jumped to a
i 22-16 lead. Lowell never threatened J
again.
VARSITY, U.S.C.
Midget Gene Rock, who looks like j
i a fugitive from a prep school quin- \
\ tet, and dark Alex Omalev were I
j mainly responsible for S.C.'s win
! over the Card varsity. Finding the
Stanford guards unwilling to come
out after them, the two Trojans had
| many set shot attempts, finally com- J
ing up with 31 of the Southerners' ;
41 points.
Trailing, 21-3, midway in the open- '
ing half, the Indians suddenly came |
to life, and with Jack Dana, Ed Voss,
I and Howie Dallmar sinking quick J
j goals, moved up to a halftime score
of 22-15.
Stanford kept up the pace in the
j second half, getting up to within two j
! points of the Trojans. Here Rock
| and Omalev stepped in, however,
| and S.C. again had a commanding j
lead. Dana notched 12 points to lead
I the Card scoring.

FROSH. LOWELL
Woody Weir's charges seemed a
little tired in the Lowell contest, and
kept the pace of the game unusually
slow. West, however, stayed hot
enough from the Menlo game to tally
14 points for scoring honors. Berlin
dumped in three field goals and a
free throw for seven.
The high school boys led the Pa
peese, 13-12, at the half, mainly on
the strength of a cut-off play which

j found a Lowell forward repeatedly i
clear under the basket. The Frosh j
came out in the second half with j
I instructions from Weir as to how to (
i stop the play, and with West pour- j
| ing three consecutive field goals j
j through the netting, jumped to a
i 22-16 lead. Lowell never threatened J
again.
VARSITY, U.S.C.
Midget Gene Rock, who looks like j
i a fugitive from a prep school quin- \
\ tet, and dark Alex Omalev were I
j mainly responsible for S.C.'s win
! over the Card varsity. Finding the
Stanford guards unwilling to come
out after them, the two Trojans had
| many set shot attempts, finally com- J
ing up with 31 of the Southerners' ;
41 points.
Trailing, 21-3, midway in the open- '
ing half, the Indians suddenly came |
to life, and with Jack Dana, Ed Voss,
I and Howie Dallmar sinking quick J
j goals, moved up to a halftime score
of 22-15.
Stanford kept up the pace in the
j second half, getting up to within two j
! points of the Trojans. Here Rock
| and Omalev stepped in, however,
| and S.C. again had a commanding j
lead. Dana notched 12 points to lead
I the Card scoring.
While their big brothers were
dropping the Coast Conference cur
tain raiser to U.S.C., 41-32, Stanford's
Frosh cagers easily whipped Menlo
J.C., 37-24, Friday night, and then
came back Saturday afternoon to
smother Lowell with a second-half
barrage, 31-23.
FROSH, MENLO
The Papeese looked like a new

checking correctly on defense, and
