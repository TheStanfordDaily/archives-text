## Spalding Plays Two Concertos 
### 
Albert Spalding's slight nervous
ness while playing the Mozart A
major Concerto with the San Fran
cisco Symphony Saturday night,
cropped out in a hardly perceptible
chatter of his bowing, a tremor of
his vibrato, and tone without heart;
but he did all right in Samuel Bar
ber's new concerto, a work late-19th
century romantic and very agree
able, in whose broad melody Spald
ing was at his best.
In a hundred years of concerts, an
orchestral composition will not re
ceive a performance more nearly
perfect than was given Strauss'
"Death and Transfiguration." the
evening's finale.â€”Covey.
