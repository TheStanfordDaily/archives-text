# WAR BOARD
## SWB Auxiliary To Meet Today 
### 
For the first time, the women's
auxiliary of the Stanford War Board
will meet at 1 p.m. today in the
Women's Clubhouse, according to
Rosemary Cross, chairman of the
War Board.
"The auxiliary has been formed,"
said Miss Cross, "to coordinate with
in each of the women's living groups
requests and information from the
War Board."
"Previously," she said, "whenever
a chairman has had a request to
make, she phoned someone within
the living group who would relay
the request. No one in the groups
knew how the War Board was or
ganized, and so they frequently
didn't know exactly what the SWB
wanted from them and when it was
wanted."
"Under the auxiliary," she con
tinued, "this will all be changed.
There will now be one person within
each group who will know how the
War Board is organized, what it
wants that living group to do, how
it wants it done and when it wants
it done."
At the first meeting of the auxil
iary today, Pat Thureson, chairman
of the auxiliary will speak. Then
Rosemary Cross will explain the
general organization of the War
Board. Following her, June Ellis
will explain the work of the USO;
Peggy McClean, the War Board
Workshop; and Janet McClanahan,
the YWCA. Following this, the
auxiliary will elect a secretary.
