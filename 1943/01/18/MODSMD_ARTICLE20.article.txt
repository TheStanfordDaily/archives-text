# Men 17 to Hear Marine Corps Plan
## 
### 
All 17-year-old men who are not
already members of the armed
forces reserves will meet tonight at
7 in the Encina Lobby, where Capt.
Douglas Montell will explain the
Marines' Candidate Class, a plan
made available by the U.S. Marine

Corps which will permit college stu
dents to continue with their college
education.
Cabooses built for a new military
railroad in Louisiana have bay win
dows on the side, instead of the tra
ditional rooftop cupola.
