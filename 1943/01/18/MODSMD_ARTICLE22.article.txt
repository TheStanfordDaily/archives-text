# That Sorority Problem
## 
### 
WE all had a good time Saturday night, all
the girls were nice to us and everything
was swell. But a lot of us couldn't forget that for
every exuberant young freshman pledge we
danced with, there were two back at Roble who
weren't so happy.
And though we danced and enjoyed our
selves, we still remembered many fine girls
who didn't pledge this year, girls who could
make any sorority they wished at any univer
sity but Stanford. And it detracted from our
fun to realize that some of these girls may con
sider themselves failures when we know they
are not.
It's a real shame that this heartbreak should
be repeated year after year at Stanford. Some
thing should be done about it.
Change the rushing rules, some say. They
are often too strict, too dogmatic, but they al
most have to be because of the difficulties un
der which rushing operates here.
You can't blame the sororities. There are
lust so many sororities and each one can take
just so many girls. One hundred and twenty
six girls were pledged Saturday—almost every
tiouse filled its guota— and there still remained
206 girls signed up and eligible for rushing, plus
those not scholastically eligible or who did not
not go out for rushing.
It's a tough situation. In our class of '44, we
ran think of girls who left Stanford to become
a Kappa at Nebraska, a Chi O at Michigan, a
Gamma Phi at California, a Theta at U.C.L.A.—
there are many more who didn't make a sorority
here and left school feeling they had lost a part
of college life.
But many others found that hall life at Stan
ford has a lot of advantages, which it certainly
has. We don't propose to fight the Hall-Row
question in this column. We recognize that
each has its real advantages, but the decision
should be left to the individual preference of
the girls—it should not be forced upon them.
We like the men's rushing system. We get
the advantages of living with our own class in
Encina for a year and then we make our choice
of hall or fraternity. We all have our difficulties
of course, but there are relatively few men who
want to join a fraternity and can't. Most of the
men living in Stanford's halls have chosen them
by preference.
This choice is not open to the women. It is
not open when two of every three girls out for
rushing can't hope to join a house. It not only
hurts those left behind, but it can lead to snob
bery among sororities if they are placed upon
a pedestal by this unfair selectivity. The situa
tion hurts not only the girls, but the entire Stan
ford sorority system.
Two alternatives are generally proposed in
the various discussions of the subject:
1) Abolish all sororities. This may be the
result of the present trend. You can't tolerate a
system that hurts two out of three women it
touches. It is our personal view that sororities
are a real part of college life, although we rec
ognize that college life could still go on with
out them.
2) Increase the number of sororities so that ,
the proportion of sororities to women is about
the same as the number of fraternities to the
number of men. Many girls will look over
sorority life and decide they prefer hall life. '

Others will choose a sorority. But the decision '
should be left to the individual woman as far as
possible.
We realize that under present wartime con
ditions, this discussion is purely academic. For
the present, we can only suggest that sorority
guotas be lifted slightly. Not only would this
let a few more girls into sororities and relieve
the housing problem, but it would make it easier
for the sororities financially.
But something must be done eventually.
The present setup not only hurts the rushees,
but in the long run it may mean the end of
sororities if their number is not increased. The
hall-sorority choice should be left to the indi
vidual decisions of Stanford women. Not only j
would this eliminate any sorority snobbery,
which can arise from the present situation, but j
it would make Stanford a happier place for
many women.—Ferris Boothe.
