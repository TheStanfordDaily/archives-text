# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
In subsequent numbers of this volume there
will be frequent mention of the members of one
of those behind-the-scenes but indispensible
organizations, the kitchen staff. In order that
you may have a better understanding of these
characters as they step into print in the future.
Our Hasher would like to present the
dramatis personae with program notes:
EDlE—the culinary coordinator. She has
a son who is now a sergeant, but who will
be a captain in four months.
WILLIE MAE—you've already been met.
BUTCHIE-WUTCHIE—one of the boys.
Handles himself around the dishpan like
as if it were the keystone sack. Speaks in
an East Oakland dialect.
DON—hedhash. Makes the long trip
down into civilization twice a day just to
see that the salt and pepper is on the
table.
SONNY IIM —another of the boys.
Doesn't eat—hashes for the fun of it.
AITCH GEE-WHlZ—third boy. Likes to
roll the butter balls with his feet.
HONEY-BUNNY—fourth boy. Smooth as
glass.
HEY YOU—the sub, any sub. When he
can't make it Charlie comes. Charlie us
ually stays in the refrigerator, so he can
turn the light off.
Quote from State vs. Flynn, lan. 10: Flynn,
"Why, I wouldn't be seen dead with a row
woman."
