The Editor, Sir:
I imagine you've had a good many letters
from Stanfordites telling of chance meetings
throughout the world, but I believe that I have
experienced a coincidence that will stack up with
any of them. Last June, on the train while I was
on my way to Fort. Leonard Wood, I met A1
Nadeau (Theta Chi, '42). Five months later on a
transport moving from England to Africa, who
should be bunked two cabins from me but A1
Nadeau?
Incidentally, on a parade ground situated
between the mountains of Africa and the
Mediterranean, I recently marched in a brigade
review to the tune of "Come Join the Band." I
haven't yet found who was responsible for
that.
I haven't yet been able to find out anything
about the Big Game outside of the score, but I
guess that alone tells the story. Congratula
tions, that's the kind of news we all like to hear!
There isn't much I can say about Africa ex
cept that so far it reminds me of that field out
behind Encina Commons after a few weeks of
rain.
Sincerely,
W. M. Kays (El Tigre '42),
2nd. Lt., Corps ol Engineers.
