## British Bombs Blast Berlin 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 17 (U.R) — Fires
visible for 100 miles were left rag
; ing in Berlin Saturday night when a
: large force of four-motored RAF
, bombers unleashed four-ton "super
I Block Busters" and thousands of
tons of fire bombs in what was un
| doubtedly the heaviest of 54 raids on
J the German capital.
It was the first raid on Berlin
since Nov. 7, 1941, and because of
I the long lull, the Germans were ap
parently caught off guard, for only
one of the more than 500 raiders was
lost. And pilots described the anti
! aircraft fire which met them as sur
prisingly light.
For about an hour the mightiest
planes in the RAF arsenal—Hali
faxes, Lancasters, and Stirlings, the
j latter carrying eight tons of bombs
in their great bellies—spilled death
i and destruction in the heart of
Nazidom. And Berlin admitted on
! Sunday rescue crews were digging
j through the debris for bodies.
