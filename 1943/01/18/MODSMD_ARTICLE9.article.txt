# Final Rush Period Begins Tomorrow
## 
### 
The intensive men's rushing sched
ule takes a day off today as both
frosh and Row men prepare for the
last week of rushing. The fourth and
final rush period begins tomorrow
with both lunch and dinner meals
scheduled.
A mistake was made in printing
rush cards by including stamps on
them. Instead of mailing them out
they should be returned to Johnny
Mitchell in Room 400 by 2:30 p.m.
today.
Second half of the fourth period
will include lunch and dinner rush
meaLs on Thursday. Preference
dinners will be Friday night fol
lowed by formal pledging from 10-2
p.m. on Saturday.
