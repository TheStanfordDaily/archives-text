## Frosh to Vie For Offices Tomorrow 
### 
Fourteen members of the Class of
'4G will vie for two offices in tomor
row's election, which will last from
8:30 a.m. to 2:30 p.m. The frosh
election will be run off concurrently
with balloting on the proposed
amendments to the A.S.S.U. consti
tution.
Because of a mistake in yester
day's Daily, which made it appear
that three offices would be filled in
stead of two, two boys, Tom Yedor
and Bob Knox, were nominated for
treasurer instead of president, which
probably would have been their in
tent under the real system.
"Although we * can't put these
men's names as presidential nomi
nees on the regular ballot, we can
publicize their names as write-in
candidates for president," said Bud
viously. ' These are the most im-

Nominees for president include
Martin Anderson, Carl Brune, Dave
Freeman, Bob Vallier, and Barrett
Weber.
Candidates for secretary-treasurer
are Marylou McClure, Barbara Bon
ner. Marion Carstarphen, Sallie van
Dyck, Marcia Smith, Kathrene Jane
Supple, and Margery Thomas.
Written Declinations
Declinations must be written and
must be turned in to the Election
Board chairman in the A.S.S.U. of
fice not later than 2 tomorrow sifter
noon.
While only freshmen can vote
for their class officers, the entire
student body will vote on the pro
posed constitutional amendments,
which adapt the student body con
stitution to the wartime conditions
on the campus.
Polls for the combined election
will be placed at the English and
Engineering corners. Voters must
present their student body cards at
the polls to receive a ballot, Ambrose
emphasized.
