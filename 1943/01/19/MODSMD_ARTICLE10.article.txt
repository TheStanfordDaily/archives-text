## 
### 
Everyone laughs at the gag
about the policeman who has
something stolen from hiin.
It happened Sunday night on
campus.
There was a policeman. He was
eating dinner in the Union. While
he was eating dinner, he left his
cap in the hatrack. He finished
his dinner, paid his check, and
came hack for his cap.
It was gone, finally and definite
ly not there. When last seen he
was still searching frantically. HIS
capâ€”stolen!
How embarrassing!
