# Schroeder Leaves for Duty, Gives NCCA Cup to Carrothers
## 
### Bill Rose 
. Ensign Frederick R. Schroeder Jr. left Stanford last night to go on active
duty as an engineering officer in the U.S. Navy. Behind him he left a
human interest story, unknown by most of his fellow students, which more
than anything else proves how worthy he was to win the national men's
singles tennis championship last summer.

Ted, who has been visiting on
campus for the past few days, had a
pal in his high school days whose
name was Bob Carrot hers. Bob was
a little more than a pal; he was an
idol to Ted. For at the time it was
Bob, not Ted, who was the shining
star of California's younger netmen.
Ted visited often at the Can-others
home iii Coronado, and when both
boys were at U.S.C., you could al
ways find Bob at the Schroeders' in
Glendale.
Junior Champ
Bob became national junior sin
gles champion, and it looked as ii
he were headed for the top. He was
certainly a likelier prospect than his
buddy, Ted Schroeder, who was still
an unknown in national tennis
circles.
But Bob was not destined to reach
the top. In 1940 he was killed in an
automobile accident; and Ted and
the rest of Bob's friends and ad
mirers mourned the loss of a great
kid and a great tennis player.
But a mere sorrow wasn't enough
for Ted. He was going to do some
thing which would be a lasting trib
ute to his pal. So he went to Bob's
parents and told them that if he
ever got the chance to win the na
tional championship that could have
been their son's, he'd do it and he'd
do it for Bob.
Ted Starts
Then Ted began his meteoric rise
to tennis greatness and got his first
chance at the championship in 1941.
He lost a heartbreaking match in
the semi-finals and was eliminated,
but he wasn't ready to quit, not by
a long shot.
He tried again last summer. De
spite an injured elbow, he won in a
blaze of powerful serves and over
head smashes.
He was on top now. And, as is
always the case, the envious multi
tude began to look for faults in the
champâ€”they called him "show-off,"
"a second Kovacs," "the clown of the
courts."
Didn't Forget
But they didn't know what they
were talking about, for in this
crowning moment of his career Ted
had not forgotten Bob Carrothers.
the boy who might have been champ.
Ted wrote his father and asked
him to present it to Coornado High
School as a perpetual award there in

the name of Bob Carrothers.
There were no strings attached and
the school officials could decide
whether it be given as a tennis tro
phy or whatever else they deemed
desirable. Only it had to stand as a
token in memory of Bob Carrothers.
Immediately after Ted won the
championship he went to Annapolis
for a four-months intensive training
course in naval engineering. He re
ceived his commission Jan. 5, and
now he has gone to fight for Uncle
Sam in a greater struggle than the
national championship, while the
name of Bob Carrothers has become
a symbol of American sportsman
shipand friendly devotion.
