# Marksmen Pick New Officers

### 
With seven returning lettermen
to bolster its squad, the Stanford
Rifle Team begins intensive drilling
this week for its forthcoming chal
lenge matches.
Lloyd Sciaroni has been elected
the new president, replacing Wes
Nowell. The new secretary is Ei
Korrick, and the treasurer is Bill
Alfonte.
The riflemen have been assured
of a limited supply of ammunition
from the National Rifle Association,
and have received a portion of it.
About 12 freshmen have reported
to practice, and there are indications
that they will see lots of action, for
most of them shot on high school
rifle clubs.
Sciaroni is a former member of
the Ail-American skeet team, and
three years ago was a member of the
national championship five- m a n
Fresno skeet team which won the
U.S. crown at the Golden Gate ex
position in San Francisco.
This summer Sciaroni wound up
in a four-way tie for first place in
the Class A of the state champion
ships. In the shoot-off he cracked
three perfect scores of 25 each to
beat out his opponents.
The Stanford rifle range is located
in the basement of the Administra
tion Building.
