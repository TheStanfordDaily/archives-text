# David Starr Jordan's Anniversary
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Today is the 92nd anniversary of
the birth of David Starr Jordan,
first president of the University, re
membered and loved by all Farm
students for his work in making
Stanford an institution of high stand
ing and in gathering a faculty of
scholars.
To Jordan, democracy was a way
of life packed with responsibilities
as well as opportunities. He would
have been proud of the way in
which contemporary students are
meeting the responsibility of pro
tecting democracy.
He once reminded his students
that their aims in life were high and
that they were pledged to a life of
effort and growth indicated by their

presence here. "You have reached :
only the threshold of learning, but i
the promise of the future is with
you."
If he believed "the highest duty
of government is to keep the road
unobstructed so that each man can 1
i make his own way for himself," then
he also would have believed that it
is the duty of each Stanford student
today to protect the liberty of his
opportunity for government and
education.
Former President Herbert Hoover !
speaks for the whole of the Stanford '
I Family in commemorating David
Starr Jordan as "First president of j
I our beloved University, creator of its j
' oldest traditions, scientist of un- I

quenchable thirst for truth and of
unalterable integrity in its search,
teacher of sympathy and imagina
tion, friend of youth, wise counselor,
believer in the inviolable sanctity
and worth of the individual human
soul, exemplar of the moral virtues,
inspirer to the spiritual life, apostle
and prophet of peace."
