|"N today's Campus Opinion column is a letter
J. from Persis Johnson, Editor of The Quad,
stating the troubles the yearbook staff is run
ning into because of the war. The main trouble
has been in obtaining and keeping a photog
rapher. At last a photographer has been secured,
'but he has a deferment for only about two
weeks." "For this reason, all Quad portraits
must be taken before Jan. 27."
There is little more that need be said. Make
an appointment today for sometime during the
next two weeks, and then be sure and keep it.
NTo longer can we put off getting our pictures
taken, as we all have in the past, knowing that
the deadline would be moved. This is one dead
line human nature won't change. Newton Wise.
