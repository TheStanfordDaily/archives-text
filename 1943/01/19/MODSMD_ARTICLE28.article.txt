# OUR HASHER SEZ

Friday night at the basketball contest over
on the maplewoods of the pavilion Stanford stu
dents jeopardized the Farm's name for hospital
ity and good sportsmanship.

It was during the second half of the contest,
at the time when Stanford was closing USC's
lead and actually pretending they were as good
as the Trojans. Little Gene Rock from Eagle
Rock was taking two free throws awarded him
by one of those men in the striped shirts on a
questionable foul.

He missed the first shot amidst a little noise
and confusion. While he was getting set for his
second try—which he also missed—the noise
developed into a large hubbub, thereby forcing
Short-striped-man Leith to call a technical foul
on the Indians and give the kid another shot.
The highly courteous and basketball-wise audi
ence kept right on hubbubing despite efforts by
Indian players to quiet them.

Rock made the third try, but if he hadn't Leith
would have been justified in awarding him in
numerable shots until the crowd quieted down.

Maybe someday there'll be a game which
we lose by one point on just such a shot. Wise
up.
