The Editor, Sir:
Page two of yesterday's Daily carried an an- i
nouncement that the Stanford War Board is spon- ,
soring a debate of post-war world organization.
That seems typical of the Stanford way of think
ing. Now that the SWB has accomplished all it

set out to do to help win the war, it is now taking
on the sideline of peace.
Aside from such incongruity, why should
we waste our time listening to unqualified speak
ers theorizing on the problems of World Fed
erations, International Armies, Reconstruction,
and other such babble when we have not yet
even begun to win the war? Why don't we leave
these problems to Herbert Hoover, Hugh Gib
son, and Lewis Mumford? They have plenty of
time. The time we might spend at such discus
sions could better be applied to our own efforts
to train ourselves for the winning of the war.
Specifically, those who attend the poorly cam
ouflaged attempt at propagandizing the student
body will not have many of their Thursday les
sons. Which is the more important?
Anyway, I don't believe the Stanford student
is interested in such matters. Why should he
be? He has a job to do now which is cut out for
him by the time schedule. A little later he will
have a job cut out for him by the Draft Board.
Beside these two other jobs, the one of post-war
organization is remote and unimportant. Cross
bridges when you come to them still rings true.
The discussion may prove interesting. I hope
it does. Those who waste precious time to hear
it should at least not be bored. Most of them
have shed enough of their naivete to know that
no matter how much this question is discussed,
the actual plans for world post-war organization
will be made by the same kind of men who
pulled us into this and the last war. And the
same kind of peace will be made to satisfy the
same special interests. The Stanford student's
job, then, is to do his best to win this war as soon
as possible so that he can return to his original
life plans and Stanford students following him
can enjoy a Farm life free from SWB's and irrele
vant discussion panels.
The validity of these arguments will be borne
out by the facts that: Mo one will even attempt
to fabricate arguments to refute the ones given
here; Palo Alto residents will take over the audi
torium as usual and student attendance will be
limited to those students who are attending for
class credit.—REALIST.

The Editor, Sir:
The QUAD, like most businesses and organiza
tions today, is having troubles because of the
war. Our main trouble right now is in obtain
ing and keeping a photographer. The studio
which is under contract to the 1943 QUAD is
having nothing but trouble trying to find and
then keep not only a photographer but also a
staff to work in the processing room to prepare
proofs and prints for reproduction. Between
the draft boards and the shipyards, photog
raphers are rare indeed. The studio has at last
been able to secure a portrait photographer, but
he has a deferment for only about two weeks.
When he is gone, there will be no one to take
his place.
For this reason, all Quad portraits must be
taken before Jan. 21. Pictures will be scheduled
beginning today, Jan. 18, and will be taken at
the QUAD studio this week, and Monday, Tues
day, and Wednesday of next week. After
Wednesday, Jan. 27 no individual portraits can
be taken. This is not like the famous "QUAD
deadlines" of the past. This one, unfortunately,
will have to be kept.

We would like to have the complete co
operation of the student body in this matter.
All students v/ho have not yet had their pic
tures taken, call the Quad for a picture ap
pointment. If your living group has not yet
been taken, ask your manager to contact the
Quad. We will try to keep appointments as
nearly as possible, and request the indulgence
of those who might be kept waiting. We'll do
the best we can, but we need help!
We also ask your cooperation in calling for
and returning your proofs. Proofs should be
called for on the date specified and returned
within a week. Proofs are available in Room 15
on the third floor of the Old Union every day
from 9 to 5.
Sincerely,
Persis Johnson.

The Editor, Sir:
The QUAD, like most businesses and organiza
tions today, is having troubles because of the
war. Our main trouble right now is in obtain
ing and keeping a photographer. The studio
which is under contract to the 1943 QUAD is
having nothing but trouble trying to find and
then keep not only a photographer but also a
staff to work in the processing room to prepare
proofs and prints for reproduction. Between
the draft boards and the shipyards, photog
raphers are rare indeed. The studio has at last
been able to secure a portrait photographer, but
he has a deferment for only about two weeks.
When he is gone, there will be no one to take
his place.
For this reason, all Quad portraits must be
taken before Jan. 21. Pictures will be scheduled
beginning today, Jan. 18, and will be taken at
the QUAD studio this week, and Monday, Tues
day, and Wednesday of next week. After
Wednesday, Jan. 27 no individual portraits can
be taken. This is not like the famous "QUAD
deadlines" of the past. This one, unfortunately,
will have to be kept.

We would like to have the complete co
operation of the student body in this matter.
All students v/ho have not yet had their pic
tures taken, call the Quad for a picture ap
pointment. If your living group has not yet
been taken, ask your manager to contact the
Quad. We will try to keep appointments as
nearly as possible, and request the indulgence
of those who might be kept waiting. We'll do
the best we can, but we need help!
We also ask your cooperation in calling for
and returning your proofs. Proofs should be
called for on the date specified and returned
within a week. Proofs are available in Room 15
on the third floor of the Old Union every day
from 9 to 5.
Sincerely,
Persis Johnson.

Page two of yesterday's Daily carried an an- i
nouncement that the Stanford War Board is spon- ,
soring a debate of post-war world organization.
That seems typical of the Stanford way of think
ing. Now that the SWB has accomplished all it

set out to do to help win the war, it is now taking
on the sideline of peace.
Aside from such incongruity, why should
we waste our time listening to unqualified speak
ers theorizing on the problems of World Fed
erations, International Armies, Reconstruction,
and other such babble when we have not yet
even begun to win the war? Why don't we leave
these problems to Herbert Hoover, Hugh Gib
son, and Lewis Mumford? They have plenty of
time. The time we might spend at such discus
sions could better be applied to our own efforts
to train ourselves for the winning of the war.
Specifically, those who attend the poorly cam
ouflaged attempt at propagandizing the student
body will not have many of their Thursday les
sons. Which is the more important?
Anyway, I don't believe the Stanford student
is interested in such matters. Why should he
be? He has a job to do now which is cut out for
him by the time schedule. A little later he will
have a job cut out for him by the Draft Board.
Beside these two other jobs, the one of post-war
organization is remote and unimportant. Cross
bridges when you come to them still rings true.
The discussion may prove interesting. I hope
it does. Those who waste precious time to hear
it should at least not be bored. Most of them
have shed enough of their naivete to know that
no matter how much this question is discussed,
the actual plans for world post-war organization
will be made by the same kind of men who
pulled us into this and the last war. And the
same kind of peace will be made to satisfy the
same special interests. The Stanford student's
job, then, is to do his best to win this war as soon
as possible so that he can return to his original

nearly as possible, and request the indulgence
of those who might be kept waiting. We'll do
the best we can, but we need help!
We also ask your cooperation in calling for
and returning your proofs. Proofs should be
called for on the date specified and returned
within a week. Proofs are available in Room 15
on the third floor of the Old Union every day
from 9 to 5.

The Editor, Sir:
Page two of yesterday's Daily carried an an- i
nouncement that the Stanford War Board is spon- ,
soring a debate of post-war world organization.
That seems typical of the Stanford way of think
ing. Now that the SWB has accomplished all it

set out to do to help win the war, it is now taking
on the sideline of peace.
Aside from such incongruity, why should
we waste our time listening to unqualified speak
ers theorizing on the problems of World Fed
erations, International Armies, Reconstruction,
and other such babble when we have not yet
even begun to win the war? Why don't we leave
these problems to Herbert Hoover, Hugh Gib
son, and Lewis Mumford? They have plenty of
time. The time we might spend at such discus
sions could better be applied to our own efforts
to train ourselves for the winning of the war.
Specifically, those who attend the poorly cam
ouflaged attempt at propagandizing the student
body will not have many of their Thursday les
sons. Which is the more important?
Anyway, I don't believe the Stanford student
is interested in such matters. Why should he
be? He has a job to do now which is cut out for
him by the time schedule. A little later he will
have a job cut out for him by the Draft Board.
Beside these two other jobs, the one of post-war
organization is remote and unimportant. Cross
bridges when you come to them still rings true.
The discussion may prove interesting. I hope
it does. Those who waste precious time to hear
it should at least not be bored. Most of them
have shed enough of their naivete to know that
no matter how much this question is discussed,
the actual plans for world post-war organization
will be made by the same kind of men who
pulled us into this and the last war. And the
same kind of peace will be made to satisfy the
same special interests. The Stanford student's
job, then, is to do his best to win this war as soon
as possible so that he can return to his original
life plans and Stanford students following him
can enjoy a Farm life free from SWB's and irrele
vant discussion panels.
The validity of these arguments will be borne
out by the facts that: Mo one will even attempt
to fabricate arguments to refute the ones given
here; Palo Alto residents will take over the audi
torium as usual and student attendance will be
limited to those students who are attending for
class credit.—REALIST.

The Editor, Sir:
The QUAD, like most businesses and organiza
tions today, is having troubles because of the
war. Our main trouble right now is in obtain
ing and keeping a photographer. The studio
which is under contract to the 1943 QUAD is
having nothing but trouble trying to find and
then keep not only a photographer but also a
staff to work in the processing room to prepare
proofs and prints for reproduction. Between
the draft boards and the shipyards, photog
raphers are rare indeed. The studio has at last
been able to secure a portrait photographer, but
he has a deferment for only about two weeks.
When he is gone, there will be no one to take
his place.
For this reason, all Quad portraits must be
taken before Jan. 21. Pictures will be scheduled
beginning today, Jan. 18, and will be taken at
the QUAD studio this week, and Monday, Tues
day, and Wednesday of next week. After
Wednesday, Jan. 27 no individual portraits can
be taken. This is not like the famous "QUAD
deadlines" of the past. This one, unfortunately,
will have to be kept.

We would like to have the complete co
operation of the student body in this matter.
All students v/ho have not yet had their pic
tures taken, call the Quad for a picture ap
pointment. If your living group has not yet
been taken, ask your manager to contact the
Quad. We will try to keep appointments as
nearly as possible, and request the indulgence
of those who might be kept waiting. We'll do
the best we can, but we need help!
We also ask your cooperation in calling for
and returning your proofs. Proofs should be
called for on the date specified and returned
within a week. Proofs are available in Room 15
on the third floor of the Old Union every day
