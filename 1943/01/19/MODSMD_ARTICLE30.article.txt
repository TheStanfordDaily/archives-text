# Navy Picture Is Stereotyped
## 
### 
THE NAVY COMES THROUGH,
: last time tonight at the Stanford.
The Hollywood stereotype of sailor
pictures does much to mar "The
Navy Comes Through"; but it has
| got more authentic navydom than
| most, and a quota of high, if ultra
i patriotic, moments, and unhack- i
■ neyed, if implausible, ideas. |
"Seven Sweethearts," showing
second, is extremely enjoyable light
j entertainment, of the sort of oper
i etta type. A Dutch village in Michi- j

gan is not the background in which
you would expect the great acting oi
Van Heflin to be set. —Covey.
