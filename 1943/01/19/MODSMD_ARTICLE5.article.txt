# TUESDAY EVE
## Van Elst To Speak On Flemish Masters 
### 
Any little Belgian boy who grows up in Bruges, the "Venice of Flanders,"
with its cobbled streets and winding, medieval canals, knows the stories
ol' the old masters of Flemish paintingâ€”Van Eyck. van der Weyden, Bouts,
van der Goes, Petrus Christus.
Legends of their work, their private lives, their hopes, and their successes

would pass down to him much as
the stories of the home-town boys
who "make good" are perpetuated in
a thousand communities today.
And if, after a life which had led
through war, peace, and many of the
cultural and political chancellories
of Europe, one of these little Bruges
boys were to become the owner of
a wonderful collection of the paint
ings of his beloved old masters, he
would be an excellent medium to
bring their real meaning to a cul
ture-conscious twentieth century.
'New Lights'
Such a man is Baron Joseph van
der Elst, counsellor to the United
States for the Belgian Embassy, who
speaks on "New Lights on Old Mas
ter's" at the Tuesday Evening Series
tonight at 7:30 in Memorial Hall.
It is difficult to decide which is
more interesting, the man or his
message. Reared as a professional
diplomat, though his dominant in
terest was art. Baron van der Elst
was Belgium's envoy to Vienna for
eight years. He also was stationed
in Luxembourg, Athens, Budapest,
and Washington. At present he is
located at the Belgian Embassy in
New York.
During these diplomatic tenures.
Baron van der Elst had an oppor
tunity for first hand observation of
the paintings. The best works of
the Flemish period are spread over
Europe in galleries in London, Brus
sels, Berlin, Vienna. Bruges, and in
New York and Washington.
Medals of Honor
In the World War the Baron was
wounded and captured by the Ger
mans at the age of 17: he escaped on
his sixth attempt to rejoin his regi
ment and gained two medals of
honor.
Equally interesting is the method
of lecturing used in this series. Sup
ported by his own enthusiasm for the
topic, Baron van der Elst brings 20th
century photography to his aid.
Using colored slides taken by a
color-film master, Francis G. Mayer,
the lecture is illustrated by "doiible
projection." One full-sized screen
receives the image of the painting
itself, 9 by 7 feet, while another
placed beside it receives the pr\>-

jection of small portions of the
painting. In this way minor detail
can be enlarged or two paintings
compared side-by-side.
