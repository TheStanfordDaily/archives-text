# OPEN HOUSES SATURDAY
## 
### 
Open houses next Saturday night
from 9 to 1 will once more take the
place of the regular pledge prom
which in past years has celebrated
the termination of men's rush week
according to Lee Peake, president of
Inter-Fraternity Council.
''Though we would like to have a
pledge prom with all the fraternities
participating," Peake said, "it is im
possible to hold such a large dance
011 campus because of lack of room.
Instead, most of the fraternities will
hold open house."
Peake said that though each house
would vary in its plans for open
house, on the whole they would be
informal.
