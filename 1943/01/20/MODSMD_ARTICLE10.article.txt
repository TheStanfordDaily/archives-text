Stanford will vote today upon proposed amendments to the A.S.S.U.
Constitution. The following revisions were presented as a workable plan
for the duration and not as a drastic revision. Tlu« greatest problem was
considered to be with the length of office.
A plan has been developed which provides for a three-quarter term for

.A.S.S.U. officers and assures stag-,
geied shifts, but which does not re
quire a summer election, at a time
when tile enrollment is low.
Although representation on Ex
com on a class basis is apparently
outmoded, the committee decided
to retain the present method and
titles for convenience. The mem
bers under the proposed change
would actually be members at large
because the whole student body
would vote for them.
The proposed amendments follow:
