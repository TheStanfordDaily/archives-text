# TUESDAY EVE.
## 'New Lights on Old Masters' 
### BILL HORNBY 
To some the gap between 1500
and 15)43 is too great for the human
mind to bridge, but to those who
lived in the 15th century through
the art of Flemish masters and the
words of Baron Joseph van der Elst
last night, the evidence is unques
tioned that only the highlights, the
surfaces of everyday life change and
not the basic experiences or emo
ions.
Complicated? Not to a person
who can sit in a Tuesday Evening
series audience and watch two pic
lures, side by side on the same
screen, one a painting of around
1450 A.D. and the other a photo-
graph of today, reveal the same ca
thedral belfry practically stone for
stone in the city of Bruges, Belgium.
Not to one who can find in the
exquisite portraiture of Petrus
Christus or Van Eyck, so warm in
their flesh tones and realistic in fa
cial detail, some person he has
known.
Even more effective was a single
portrait of a young man by Mem
ling. "Look at this portrait and it
will come alive." We looked, and
what Boticelli or Raphael or any of
the other Italian painters could not
do. Memling accomplished.
The thing that the Bruges masters
saw in their people was fatih: to
them life was a combination of bare
existence and the Church.
Typifying this feeling is a painting
of Gabriel bringing the news to
Mary of Christ's impending birth.
It exemplifies the deep spirituality
that the artists of Flanders could
combine with their flair for realistic
expression. Her mouth showed what
van der Elst said it did: a knowledge
that was to mother God and
that she could see "the cross of
Calvary in the distance."
St. Ursula
Bruges was particularly proud of
St. Ursula. As van der Elst chose
to tell it. St. Ursula was a high-class
lady who was too good.
She refused to embark on the
"immodesty" of marriage to a husky
king of Brittany, chose rather to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. Father
decided that she should be chaper
oned by a multitude of virgins.
••The WAVVS of old," van der Elst
explained. "Women's Auxiliary Vol
unteer Virginal Society."
Modern Scenes
As a conclusion the lecturing
counsellor from Belgium told of a
modern experience which he has
seen first hand—the ravishment of
Europe by the modern Germanic
wave. As he showed different news
photographs of tragedy, especially of
sorrowing women, he placed beside
hem one of the beet paintings of
Holy Mary, the hope-?and inspiration
of women of 1500 who faced starva
tion, plagues, wars, death.

Modern Scenes
As a conclusion the lecturing
counsellor from Belgium told of a
modern experience which he has
seen first hand—the ravishment of
Europe by the modern Germanic
wave. As he showed different news
photographs of tragedy, especially of
sorrowing women, he placed beside
hem one of the beet paintings of
Holy Mary, the hope-?and inspiration
of women of 1500 who faced starva
tion, plagues, wars, death.
To some the gap between 1500
and 15)43 is too great for the human
mind to bridge, but to those who
lived in the 15th century through
the art of Flemish masters and the
words of Baron Joseph van der Elst
last night, the evidence is unques
tioned that only the highlights, the
surfaces of everyday life change and
not the basic experiences or emo
ions.
Complicated? Not to a person
who can sit in a Tuesday Evening
series audience and watch two pic
lures, side by side on the same
screen, one a painting of around
1450 A.D. and the other a photo-
graph of today, reveal the same ca
thedral belfry practically stone for
stone in the city of Bruges, Belgium.
Not to one who can find in the
exquisite portraiture of Petrus
Christus or Van Eyck, so warm in
their flesh tones and realistic in fa
cial detail, some person he has
known.
Even more effective was a single
portrait of a young man by Mem
ling. "Look at this portrait and it
will come alive." We looked, and
what Boticelli or Raphael or any of
the other Italian painters could not
do. Memling accomplished.
The thing that the Bruges masters
saw in their people was fatih: to
them life was a combination of bare
existence and the Church.
Typifying this feeling is a painting
of Gabriel bringing the news to
Mary of Christ's impending birth.
It exemplifies the deep spirituality
that the artists of Flanders could
combine with their flair for realistic
expression. Her mouth showed what
van der Elst said it did: a knowledge
that was to mother God and
that she could see "the cross of
Calvary in the distance."
St. Ursula
Bruges was particularly proud of
St. Ursula. As van der Elst chose
to tell it. St. Ursula was a high-class
lady who was too good.
She refused to embark on the
"immodesty" of marriage to a husky
king of Brittany, chose rather to
make a pilgrimage to Rome. Father
decided that she should be chaper
oned by a multitude of virgins.

explained. "Women's Auxiliary Vol
