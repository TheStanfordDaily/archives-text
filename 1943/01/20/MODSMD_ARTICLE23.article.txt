# England Newspaper Praises Stanford's War Measures
## 
### 
People iu England have heard about Stanford University, and they have
lieard that Stanford is doing its bit in the war effort.
Dodie Crile, chairman of the Conservation Council, recently received a
clipping from an English newspaper telling about the work which Stanford
was doing for the war effort. Clean Your Plate Day, Carless Wednesday,
f.nd Stamp Day. +

According to Miss Crile, it is al
most pathetic to see an English
paper praising Stanford for food
conservation because "they know
"what food conservation means. They
have one egg a week, and Stanford
University alone wastes enough food
to supply an average city.' -
"When they talk about walking
'regardless of distance,' they mean
it. Gas, o"r petrol as they call it, is
i-.lmost impossible to get."

The article said:
"College students in America
have been planning to help the
war effort."
"In Stanford University they
have had a Clean Your Plate Cam
paign, students in fraternity and
dormitory halls being pledged to
eat everything on their plates. As
.1 result better nutrition for the
hardworking young people and a
conservation of food are being
realized.
"This was followed by Carless
Wednesdays, when students walk
or ride bicycles to class, regard
less of distance.
"Immediately successful was
Stamp Day, held every Thursday,
when each student is urged to buy
at least one 25-cent War Stamp.
On the first Stamp Day 40 per
cent of the student body partici
pated. and in four weeks 72 per
cent."

"Now that so many people cannot
use their cars due to gas rationing,
Stanford students should revive the
tradition of a 'ride to Paly' and they
should really revive it with action
as well as talk.
"Clothes conservation is something
that the Conservation Council is
going to work on this quarter," Miss
Crile said. Students should not go
out and buy lots of new clothes. It.
helps inflation. It uses goods and
materials and labor which might
have been saved. This is supposed
to be a Farm, and not a Dude
Ranch."
Chess playing is a favorite pastime
of Russian children.

People iu England have heard about Stanford University, and they have
lieard that Stanford is doing its bit in the war effort.
Dodie Crile, chairman of the Conservation Council, recently received a
clipping from an English newspaper telling about the work which Stanford
was doing for the war effort. Clean Your Plate Day, Carless Wednesday,
f.nd Stamp Day. +

According to Miss Crile, it is al
most pathetic to see an English
paper praising Stanford for food
conservation because "they know
"what food conservation means. They
have one egg a week, and Stanford
University alone wastes enough food
to supply an average city.' -
"When they talk about walking
'regardless of distance,' they mean
it. Gas, o"r petrol as they call it, is
i-.lmost impossible to get."

The article said:
"College students in America
have been planning to help the
war effort."
"In Stanford University they
have had a Clean Your Plate Cam
paign, students in fraternity and
dormitory halls being pledged to
eat everything on their plates. As
.1 result better nutrition for the
hardworking young people and a
conservation of food are being
realized.
"This was followed by Carless
Wednesdays, when students walk
or ride bicycles to class, regard
less of distance.
"Immediately successful was
Stamp Day, held every Thursday,
when each student is urged to buy
at least one 25-cent War Stamp.
On the first Stamp Day 40 per
cent of the student body partici
pated. and in four weeks 72 per
cent."

"Now that so many people cannot
use their cars due to gas rationing,
Stanford students should revive the
tradition of a 'ride to Paly' and they
should really revive it with action
as well as talk.
"Clothes conservation is something
that the Conservation Council is
going to work on this quarter," Miss
Crile said. Students should not go
out and buy lots of new clothes. It.
