# Bears to Meet Stanford Five As Loser Faces Cellar Spot
## 
### 
Also victims of midget-superman Gene Rock of the Southern California
supermen, the Golden Bears of Berkeley meet Stanford Friday night at Cal.
The Nibs Price quintet has several dark thoughts to brood on for the oc
casion. They can remember that in Cal was waxed by Stanford four
times in a row. something that wasn't accomplished even in the hey-dey
of Henry Luisetti. + _

They can rememb-r that they have
sol.e possession of the conference |
cellar, having lost to U.S.C. twice and !
U.C.L.A. once. They can reflect that j
Leland Stanford Junior, a fellow |
victim of the old Trojan horse-play, !
is their most likely chance for a j
factory.
Army Bound
Other cheery items include the
pending departure of Cal's biggest
gun, sophomore Chuck Hanger, who
is Army bound. This will be their j
last shot at Stanford with Ihe not !
inconsiderable prowess of Mr. Hang
er to assist.
Members of the Berkeley squad j
who are likely to be doing the major |
portion of such reflecting include |
Hanger, his fellow-forward Jack
Rocker, a letterman, center Bob!
Arnold, sophomore flash from Lowell
High, San Francisco; and two guards, |
Dave Thurm, oldest veteran, and :
Stan Johnson. Both the guards are i
letter winners of 1942, Thurm plac- j
ing 23rd in conference scoring.
'Hot' Night
From the Everett Dean lair there
is little to be said of Friday's game
with S.C. It is evident that S.C.'s
long-shot foray was one of uncanny
accuracy, a "hot" night even for a j
lloor-length journey and a tide- ;
turning bucket.
