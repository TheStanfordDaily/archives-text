Last Friday SLANTS took a pretty
defiant attitude and said that the j
Stanford basketball team would ;
have little trouble with the Terrible
Trojan from the south. They are
also known, because of the New |
York Times, which is in competition i
with the Peninsula's only morning
newspaper, as the "Superteam."
It would be foolish now to try and j
apologize for our team. We Tost. j
But here are a few things that are
worthy of note. Mind you, this is |
not an apology. U.S.C. had a much
better average with their shots from
the floor. In fact, it was 10 per cent I
better; U.S.C. got 23 per cent to the
Indians' lowly 13 per cent.
As has been the case with every j
game this year, except the one game j
against Sanfa Clara, the team '
dropped far behind in the first half.
A score of 21-3 is phenomenal. But
then, the Trojan forwards. Gene
Rock and Alex Omalev were phe
nomenal too. These two very good i
men were flipping the ball in with
amazing accuracy.
At the same time, Stanford had
complete control of the ball all the
time.
With the score 29-27 in favor of
Troy, it looked like Stanford would
go into a lead. Perhaps they would
have, except for an unfortunate hap
pening. Tom Fuller, a very able
reserve, threw a pass that hit the
basket, while Ed Voss stood alone,
unguarded. Had this pass been good,
the score would have been tied and
new vim and spirit instilled into
the team. Fuller should not be
blamed for that could happen to
anybody. It was just unfortunate.
But perhaps the most saddening
thing about the game last Friday
was not the defeat to U.S.C., but the
! attitude of the representatives of
Stanford —the student body. Perhaps
we don't get the best officiating in
the world, but it is affecting the other
I side just as much as it does Stanford.
No one can possibly think that any
j official that works a college game
is going to deliberately throw a
j game. They are impartial as they
i can be, and use discretion as to
what should be called. Naturally,
they cannot be expected to be per
fect in their officiating and are likely
to have occasional "off nights."
These games are broadcast over a
state-wide hookup, and the boos and
cat-calls are audible to the whole
listening audience. It is only natural
for the listeners to think we are sore
because we are behind. "The Hasher
Sez" of yesterday had some pearls
| on the same subject.
The Stanford rooting sections have
usually been noted for their good
j sportsmanship. It is something to be
proud of. Let's keep it that way.
But on the credit side of the ledg
er, the students should be praised
for the applause they gave to the
opposing stars for the good work
they did. Rock, Omalev, and Jim
Scminoff probably liked the idea of
getting an ovation from the op
j ponents.

the floor. In fact, it was 10 per cent I
better; U.S.C. got 23 per cent to the
Indians' lowly 13 per cent.
As has been the case with every j
game this year, except the one game j
against Sanfa Clara, the team '
dropped far behind in the first half.
A score of 21-3 is phenomenal. But
then, the Trojan forwards. Gene
Rock and Alex Omalev were phe
nomenal too. These two very good i
men were flipping the ball in with
amazing accuracy.
At the same time, Stanford had
complete control of the ball all the
time.
With the score 29-27 in favor of
Troy, it looked like Stanford would
go into a lead. Perhaps they would
have, except for an unfortunate hap
pening. Tom Fuller, a very able
reserve, threw a pass that hit the
basket, while Ed Voss stood alone,
unguarded. Had this pass been good,
the score would have been tied and
new vim and spirit instilled into
the team. Fuller should not be
blamed for that could happen to
anybody. It was just unfortunate.
But perhaps the most saddening
thing about the game last Friday
was not the defeat to U.S.C., but the
! attitude of the representatives of
Stanford —the student body. Perhaps
we don't get the best officiating in
the world, but it is affecting the other
I side just as much as it does Stanford.
No one can possibly think that any
j official that works a college game
is going to deliberately throw a
j game. They are impartial as they
i can be, and use discretion as to
what should be called. Naturally,
they cannot be expected to be per
fect in their officiating and are likely
to have occasional "off nights."
These games are broadcast over a
state-wide hookup, and the boos and
cat-calls are audible to the whole
listening audience. It is only natural
for the listeners to think we are sore
because we are behind. "The Hasher
Sez" of yesterday had some pearls
| on the same subject.
The Stanford rooting sections have
usually been noted for their good
j sportsmanship. It is something to be
proud of. Let's keep it that way.
But on the credit side of the ledg
er, the students should be praised
for the applause they gave to the
opposing stars for the good work
they did. Rock, Omalev, and Jim
Scminoff probably liked the idea of
getting an ovation from the op
j ponents.
Last Friday SLANTS took a pretty
defiant attitude and said that the j
Stanford basketball team would ;
have little trouble with the Terrible
Trojan from the south. They are
also known, because of the New |
York Times, which is in competition i
with the Peninsula's only morning
newspaper, as the "Superteam."
It would be foolish now to try and j
apologize for our team. We Tost. j
But here are a few things that are
worthy of note. Mind you, this is |
not an apology. U.S.C. had a much
better average with their shots from
the floor. In fact, it was 10 per cent I
better; U.S.C. got 23 per cent to the
Indians' lowly 13 per cent.
