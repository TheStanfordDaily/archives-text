# "A Time for Greatness"
## 
### 
IT is rather hard to believe that "Realist" ex
pects us to accept in all seriousness the logic
of his letter, which appeared in yesterday's
Campus Opinion column. "Realist" attacks the
post-war world organization debate which the
SWB is sponsoring tonight saying that peace is
a sideline of the war, and that the job "of post
war organization is remote and unimportant.
Although it is not yet quite sensible to feel
that we are on the road to victory, it is certain
that conditions for the Allies are much better
now than they were a year ago. Even this is
a very conservative statement. It is evident
that fighting has reached a turning point which
necessitates our making some definite plans for
post-war organization —plans which we should
have started making years ago.
America, in reality, has lost every war she
has fought because of the erroneous thought
that the war is won when actual fighting ceases.
War, as a term itself, can be divided into two
main divisions:
The fighting on the battlefront, and the settle
ment of disagreements afterwards.
The United States has always nullified its vic
tory on the fighting front by losing the peace
afterwards. We will lose it again this time as
long as there are persons who think the job "of
post-war organization is remote and unimpor
tant."
Our failure to make proper post-war plans
during 1914-18 is the principal reason for the
present war. At that time we refused to meet
the problems that were facing us. We refused
to believe that there were definite problems
troubling the entire world. We put the whole
blame on the Germans, and then settled back
io the same type of life we had led before 1914.

Actually, all we did was postpone the settlement
of all those problems.
Now those same problems have arisen again,
more boldly this time, and are still demanding
answers. Shall we put off facing these ques
tions, as "Realist" would have us do? Are we
too lazy to seek out answers? Shall we let our
sons and daughters tussle with the same knot
20 years hence?
Or would it be better to accept the fact that
our world seems to have hit a new low as far
as mental and physical happiness for the ma
jority is concerned? And realizing that prob
lems do exist, we should set out to discuss and
understand them, until eventually we may be
able to make some step toward a better post
war world.
This job is not just the job of the greatest
minds in the world, but it is also the job of
everyone else, in that it will require a re-educa
. tion which should start now to a different type
of world after the war. And in this job there is
a place for everyone, particularly those who
have had the advantage of college training.—

Now those same problems have arisen again,
more boldly this time, and are still demanding
answers. Shall we put off facing these ques
tions, as "Realist" would have us do? Are we
too lazy to seek out answers? Shall we let our
sons and daughters tussle with the same knot
20 years hence?
Or would it be better to accept the fact that
our world seems to have hit a new low as far
as mental and physical happiness for the ma
jority is concerned? And realizing that prob
lems do exist, we should set out to discuss and
understand them, until eventually we may be
able to make some step toward a better post
war world.
This job is not just the job of the greatest
minds in the world, but it is also the job of
everyone else, in that it will require a re-educa
. tion which should start now to a different type
of world after the war. And in this job there is
a place for everyone, particularly those who
have had the advantage of college training.—

IT is rather hard to believe that "Realist" ex
pects us to accept in all seriousness the logic
of his letter, which appeared in yesterday's
Campus Opinion column. "Realist" attacks the
post-war world organization debate which the
SWB is sponsoring tonight saying that peace is
a sideline of the war, and that the job "of post
war organization is remote and unimportant.
Although it is not yet quite sensible to feel
that we are on the road to victory, it is certain
that conditions for the Allies are much better
now than they were a year ago. Even this is
a very conservative statement. It is evident
that fighting has reached a turning point which
necessitates our making some definite plans for
post-war organization —plans which we should
have started making years ago.
America, in reality, has lost every war she
has fought because of the erroneous thought
that the war is won when actual fighting ceases.
War, as a term itself, can be divided into two
main divisions:
The fighting on the battlefront, and the settle
ment of disagreements afterwards.
The United States has always nullified its vic
tory on the fighting front by losing the peace
afterwards. We will lose it again this time as
long as there are persons who think the job "of
post-war organization is remote and unimpor
tant."
Our failure to make proper post-war plans
during 1914-18 is the principal reason for the
present war. At that time we refused to meet
the problems that were facing us. We refused
to believe that there were definite problems
troubling the entire world. We put the whole
blame on the Germans, and then settled back
io the same type of life we had led before 1914.

Actually, all we did was postpone the settlement
of all those problems.
Now those same problems have arisen again,
more boldly this time, and are still demanding
