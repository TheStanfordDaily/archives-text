A fine tribute has been paid to a fellow mem
ber of the hashing fraternity. This short, dark
haired boy, who in his spare time is student

speaker on the radio, and member of Uncle
Sam's Navy, was only last week named on Ann
Sheridan's Glamour Ail-American team.
To be chosen as the most beautifulest tackle
in the country is the crowning glory to a col
lege career already heavy with achievements.
Congrats, fella!
