## POST-WAR DEBATE 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
"Anyway, I don't believe the Stanford student
is interested in such matters. Why should
he be?"
This is a quote from the letter to the editor
published in yesterday's Daily in regard to the
debate of post-war organization by Stanford
students at the Auditorium tonight.
It's certainly a lucky thing that all Stanford
students don't have the distorted reasoning
powers of "Realist."
He went on to say that the same men who
pulled us into this and the last war will be the
ones to make the peace. According to him, stu
dents should be interested in winning this war
only so that they can return to their easy-going
lifeâ€”to heck with thinking about post-war con
ditions. We can worry about that later; cross
our bridges when we come to them.
Whoever heard of an engineer who wasn't
trained? Or a doctor or lawyer or machinist
or engraver? These men don't go into their
jobs and then begin to train; they learn aboul
their trades and professions long before they're
ready to practice.
And if ever there was a quitter, it's Mr. "Real
ist." He figures that there's no use even trying
to think about post-war organization; the big
war bosses will do all the fixing no matter what
we do.
Sure the big war bosses will do all the fixing.
Sure. But not if persons our age don't let them!
We've got tremendous powers as a people, and
if we learn how to use those powers, they won't
have such an easy time pushing us around.
We don't all have to spend hours in the Libe
looking up material on post-war organization.
We don't all have to outfit ourselves to cope di
rectly with the war bosses. But the least any
one can do for himself is to look around and
know what's going on; and tonight's debate
seems like a good deal for just that.
Also a Realist
