# Final Rush Period Begins Tomorrow
## 
### 
Row men and frosh take a pause
from rushing today before plunging
into a hectic three-day finale to the
1943 rushing program. Today's lull
will be followed by the last regular
rush period tomorrow when fresh
men go up to the houses for both
lunch and dinner meals.
Friday evening, the traditional
preference dinners will be held
from 6 to 9 p.m. These will be fol
lowed by an enforced period of "no
contact" between frosh and Row
which will last until formal pledging
on Saturday.
Formal pledging will take place
Saturday from 10 to 2 p.m. in the
basement of the Women's Clubhouse.
Most houses will hold open house
for their pledges in the afternoon.
Saturday night, houses will hold
pledge dances and open houses, re
placing the Pledge Prom of former
years. There will be no Pledge
Prom this year because there is not
enough room on campus to hold
such a large dance, according to Lee
Peake. Interfraternity president.
Peake stated that though each
house would vary its plans most of
the dances would be informal. Each
hotise must have one sponsor who is
an employee of the University.
