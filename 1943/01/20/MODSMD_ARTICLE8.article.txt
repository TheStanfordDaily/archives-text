## Drives, Drama Plans Rejected 
### 
In a rousing hour and three-quar
ter session last night, Stanford's stu
dent representatives in Excom dis
approved a Drives Committee report
and a Dramatic Council report; ap
proved a large number of new Stan
ford War Board appointments, and
handed out dates to five campus so
cial groups. In addition, several
other proposed dates were rejected.
Chico Barmann's Drives Commit
tee suggested that fluids for the In
fantile Paralysis Foundation drive
consist of the gross profit from two
Sunday night movies and a per
centage of Rally Committee's com
ing "Dimes" dance. The report was
quickly disapproved on the basis
that all profit of the "Dimes" dance
ought to go to Stanford's "Dimes
for Diplomas" fund. The gross
profit of two Sunday evening movies
was then assigned to the paralysis
drive.
Bob O'Neill, head of Dramatic
Council, then enlightmened Excom
on the Dramatic Council's report
which contained a proposal that al
ready-recorded Gaieties music be
sold at one dollar a set. This would
necessitate the withdrawal of $65
from the dramatic improvement fund
of Rani's Head in order to cover the
loss on 50 sets of records, the maxi
mum number which could be made.
Excom felt that the positive bene
fits which would accrue to a very
particular segment of the student
body did not warrant this expense
and approved a motion that the set
of records be sold at cost, approxi
mately $2.30.
The debate on this question lasted
for well over a half hour while both
sides of the issue were carefully
scrutinized. Finally, after several
acrimonious exchanges, the report's
proposal was definitely rejected.
The same situation occurred in
another portion of the Dramatic
| Council's report, in which Ex com
raised the price of pictures of the
Gaieties from a sub-cost five cents
to six cents. The report also stated
that the one-acts were progressing
! satisfactorily.
The appointments of Rosemary
Cross, SWB coordinator, to new po
j sitions on the war board were then
approved, a date for a Lagunita-El
Cuadro exchange dinner was dis
approved, a March 6 date of Cardi
| nals was cancelled, and the follow
ing dates were granted: Sigma Nu,
Feb. 20; Alpha Sigma Phi, March 6;
A.O.Pi, March 6; and Freshman
Rally Committee, Feb. 5.

Rally Committee, Feb. 5.
In a rousing hour and three-quar
ter session last night, Stanford's stu
dent representatives in Excom dis
approved a Drives Committee report
and a Dramatic Council report; ap
proved a large number of new Stan
ford War Board appointments, and
handed out dates to five campus so
cial groups. In addition, several
other proposed dates were rejected.
Chico Barmann's Drives Commit
tee suggested that fluids for the In
fantile Paralysis Foundation drive
consist of the gross profit from two
Sunday night movies and a per
centage of Rally Committee's com
ing "Dimes" dance. The report was
quickly disapproved on the basis
that all profit of the "Dimes" dance
ought to go to Stanford's "Dimes
for Diplomas" fund. The gross
profit of two Sunday evening movies
was then assigned to the paralysis
drive.
Bob O'Neill, head of Dramatic
Council, then enlightmened Excom
on the Dramatic Council's report
which contained a proposal that al
ready-recorded Gaieties music be
sold at one dollar a set. This would
necessitate the withdrawal of $65
from the dramatic improvement fund
of Rani's Head in order to cover the
loss on 50 sets of records, the maxi
mum number which could be made.
Excom felt that the positive bene
fits which would accrue to a very
particular segment of the student
body did not warrant this expense
and approved a motion that the set
of records be sold at cost, approxi
mately $2.30.
The debate on this question lasted
for well over a half hour while both
sides of the issue were carefully
scrutinized. Finally, after several
acrimonious exchanges, the report's
proposal was definitely rejected.
The same situation occurred in
another portion of the Dramatic
| Council's report, in which Ex com
raised the price of pictures of the
Gaieties from a sub-cost five cents
to six cents. The report also stated
that the one-acts were progressing
! satisfactorily.
The appointments of Rosemary
Cross, SWB coordinator, to new po
j sitions on the war board were then
approved, a date for a Lagunita-El
Cuadro exchange dinner was dis
approved, a March 6 date of Cardi
| nals was cancelled, and the follow
ing dates were granted: Sigma Nu,
