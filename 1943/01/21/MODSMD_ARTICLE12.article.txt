## S.F. To Hear Latin Pianist 
### 
Claude Arrau, South America's |
greatest pianist, whose first season ;
in the United States last year was j
one of the most sensationally re- !
coived of any first tour in this coun- j
try, will play the Schumann A
minor Concerto with the San Fran -
cisco Symphony in their third pair
of concerts Friday and Saturday at
the Opera House.
The balance of the program con
sists of all-American selections:
William Schumann's Third Sym
phony, Domingo Santa Cruz' "Five
Short Pieces for Strings," Villa Lo
bos' "Descobrimento de Brazil," and
Chavez' Indian Symphony."
The last-named was regarded by
Alfred Frankenstein in his Modern
Music course at Stanford last sum- i
mer as the outstanding achievement j
of composition based on folk themes !
ever written in this hemisphere.
The next concerts, Feb. 5 and 6.
will feature Jose Iturbi as guest |
conductor, and his sister, Amparo, j
as piano soloist.
