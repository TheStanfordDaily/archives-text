# Special Movie To Play Friday
## 
### 
Tomorrow night at 8:15, the Stan
ford players will present a special |
showing of the moving picture "One
Third of a Nation" in the Memorial
Hall. There will be no charge for
admittance as the film is an extra
offering for the regular subscribers
of the season and students of certain
classes are also being invited. Tick- j
ets may be obtained from the de
partment secretary in Room 201, j
Memorial Hall.
The cast will include Sylvia Syd- ;
ney. Lief Erickson and a special mu
sical score composed by Nathaniel
Shildkret. The story is based on the
living newspaper play which was
presented* so successfully by the
Federal Theater some years ago.
According to F. Cowles Strickland,
director of dramatics, the living
newspaper is one of the most inter
esting new forms of playwriting.
The plot is based upon the most in
teresting events in the development
of an idea. It is somewhat similar to
"The March of Time" in form.
A plot involving a girl, Sylvia
Sydney, who falls in love with a
wealthy man, Lief Erickson, only to
find that he is the owner of the
slum houses which have been the
cause of the poor health conditions
which caused her younger brother
to die, has been added to the play
version of the housing problem.
The entire movie has been made
more emotionally climactic through
ihe use of a brilliant musical score
written by Nathaniel Shildkret.
