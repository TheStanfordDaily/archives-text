## 'Old Schoolhouse Loaned' To Scouts for Clubhouse 
### 
Knotboards, animal rugs, flags, elk
heads, and inspirations—the things
that make up an efficient Boy Scout
lair—are taking over the "Old
Schoolhouse," and the initial cere- '
monies of painting, fix-plumbing, <
raking, dusting, and bulling will
probably be attended by the ghost of
none other than Hugh Gallerneau. }
Although Gallerneau, left half
back on Clark Shaughnessy's Rose
Bowl team of 1940, is very much
alive and functioning, he is far away !
from the decrepit old building that
he and a small clique of Farm ath
letes and near-athletes converted
into a home about four years ago.
Scouts Take Over
In the tomb-like structure on Sal
vatierra, Gallerneau, followed by
should-have-been Jim Pollard,
would-have-been All-American Bill
Joslyn, track star Ed Tomasso, Bill
Hooper, pole-vaulter Russ Peck. Hap
Everett, and several others, hiber
nated.

The schoolhouse became one of
three prominent auxiliaries to En
cina Gym where athletic talk went
on after dinner, accompanied by the
healthy "exuberance" of athletes
put out to pasture. The other two,
still used by the B.A.C. are the
"Shack" near the Stanford Book
store, and the old David Starr Jor
dan home back of Sequoia Hall.
Now the schoolhouse has been
turned over to scouters, and directed
by Mr. John Leecing of the Palo
Alto Council, they hope to make the
building a headquarters not only for
Boy Scouts but also for members of
Alpha Phi Omega, honorary frater
nity of former Boy Scouts.
Stanford I^oan
'"If there ever was a time when
Boy Scouts needed support it is
now," Mr. Frank Fish Walker, fi
nancial vice-president of the Uni
versity, explains in announcing the
agreement. Stanford retains the
right to terminate the loan at any
time.
So from B.A.C. to B.S.A. goes this
building, another passing Stanford
landmark.
