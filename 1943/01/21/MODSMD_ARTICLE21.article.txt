# The 						Home Front In America
## 
### 
WHILE SOLDIERS are fic/hting on the front, Amcrica is backing
them up with record-breaking production, seeing to it that Amer
ican soldiers are the best-equipped fighting men in the world.
A home front is just as important as the battle front in the
type of war that is fought today. The competition of production
eventually will decide the outcome of the war. As it looks today.
America has no better guarantee of future victory than its pro
ducing record.


ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. Mrs. America i< savins' grease to help Lncle Sam win the war for
freedom. Here are some of the processes grease is put through to mske glycerin. Top left, grease is treated
with alkali, becoming a heaving mass of soap. Solid curds rising to the top ultimately becomes toilet soap:
the liquid at the bottom of tlie kettle is the source of glycerin. Top right, exacting tests are made of the
liquid. Lower left, three-day distilling process produces almost pure glycerin. Lower right, glycerin is
drawn off into steel drums, to be sent to another plant where it will be trerted with acid and made into
nitro-glycerin and other high explosives. Sometimes simple glycerin is shipped abroad to avoid some of
the danger of explosion in transit.


)MiV A FEW MONTHS A(iO the site of (his 1,200-ton blast furnace was a pig farm. Now there stands
Henry J. Kaiser's new SSI'.OOfI.OOO iron and steel mill at Fontana, Calif., opening the way for the first produc
tion of pig iron on the Pacific Coast. The plant is nam :-d for Kaiser's wife, Boss.


(1. Ft. BERG, right, superintendent of a General Electric war plant,
shows Lt. Gen. William Knudsen the latest airplane turbo-super
charger. Used in the Boeing Flying Fortresses and other high altitude
planes, the device utilizes exhaust gases to drive a turbine, which in
turn drives a compressor for supplying power-producing air to the
engine. The engine is thus enabled to "breath" in the thin air of high
altitude.

Sausalito. Named after California's famed railroad builder and mer

America has no better guarantee of future victory than its pro
ducing record.


ALL OVER THE UNITED STATES. Mrs. America i< savins' grease to help Lncle Sam win the war for
freedom. Here are some of the processes grease is put through to mske glycerin. Top left, grease is treated
with alkali, becoming a heaving mass of soap. Solid curds rising to the top ultimately becomes toilet soap:
the liquid at the bottom of tlie kettle is the source of glycerin. Top right, exacting tests are made of the
liquid. Lower left, three-day distilling process produces almost pure glycerin. Lower right, glycerin is
drawn off into steel drums, to be sent to another plant where it will be trerted with acid and made into
nitro-glycerin and other high explosives. Sometimes simple glycerin is shipped abroad to avoid some of
the danger of explosion in transit.


)MiV A FEW MONTHS A(iO the site of (his 1,200-ton blast furnace was a pig farm. Now there stands
Henry J. Kaiser's new SSI'.OOfI.OOO iron and steel mill at Fontana, Calif., opening the way for the first produc
tion of pig iron on the Pacific Coast. The plant is nam :-d for Kaiser's wife, Boss.


(1. Ft. BERG, right, superintendent of a General Electric war plant,
shows Lt. Gen. William Knudsen the latest airplane turbo-super
charger. Used in the Boeing Flying Fortresses and other high altitude
planes, the device utilizes exhaust gases to drive a turbine, which in
turn drives a compressor for supplying power-producing air to the
engine. The engine is thus enabled to "breath" in the thin air of high
altitude.


MERCHANT MARINK CADETS cheer the S.S. Mark Hopkins, the
10.5(M)-ton Liberty ship, poised for launching at the Marinship yard at
Sausalito. Named after California's famed railroad builder and mer
chant prince, the Mark Hopkins was christened by Mi's. R. R. McNulty
of Washington, D.C.
WHILE SOLDIERS are fic/hting on the front, Amcrica is backing
them up with record-breaking production, seeing to it that Amer
ican soldiers are the best-equipped fighting men in the world.
A home front is just as important as the battle front in the
type of war that is fought today. The competition of production
eventually will decide the outcome of the war. As it looks today.
America has no better guarantee of future victory than its pro
ducing record.
