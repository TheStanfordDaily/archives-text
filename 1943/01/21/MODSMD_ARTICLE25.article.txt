# West Virginia County Donates Jail to Scrap
## 
### 
From a government bulletin:
A West Virginia county scrap
drive netted .'!0 tons of scrap from
one source today. That source was
the county jail.
The county wasn't using the jail;
in fact there hadn't been a single
person in it for well over a year, so
they decided to turn it in for scrap.
