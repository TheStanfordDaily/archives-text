## 
### Pat Clary 
Cutting and pasting cartoon scrap
books, wrapping bandages, making
clothing for refugees, and filling sol
diers' kits will be included in the
work of the War Board Workshop
this quarter under I he direction of
Peggy McClean, new chairman.
"There is a limitless amount of
work for refugee aid and service
men that must be done by someone,"
Miss McClean said. "At the Work
shop we are trying to put out as
much of it as we can. We have a
definite Red Cross quota to fill, and
Stanford gets credit for all the work
we do."
In cooperation with Stanford
women in the Workshop, members
of the Stanford Mother's Club
are working this quarter on more
difficult sewing. In addition to
sewing in their own homes, they
will take over the Workshop each
Thursday from 10 a.m. to 4 p.m.
They will furnish their own sup
plies, Miss McClean said.
Letters from service men in Alas
ka have told War Board workers
how much they appreciated scrap

books of cartons and jokes sent them
last quarter. Other service men
have written thanks for kits which
campus women filled last Christmas
with cigarettes, playing cards, and
toilet articles.
A quota of at least 20 volunteer
workers a day has been set by the
Workshop, which is open Monday
through Friday from 1 to 5 p.m. In
order to meet the quota, each house
has been assigned one day a week.
The days will be changed every two
weeks for the convenience of those
who have labs.

quarter in two days the Workshop
