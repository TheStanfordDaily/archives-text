# STAMPS
## Second Sale Begins Today 
### 
The second Stamp Day of the
quarter will open today with the |
quota set at $1,500 and 100 per cent j
contribution from each living group
on campus.
This quota is $150 over the
stamp and bond sales results of last â– 
week. Last week half of the fra- j
ternities were 100 per cent and Ro- ;
ble's average was 91 per cent. This
should be a further incentive for liv
ing groups to surpass past records
for contributions.
Contributions
Students are asked to contribute
as much of their savings as they are
able for their part in the all-out war
effort. War Fund sponsors remind
students that by purchasing war
stamps weekly they divert surplus
funds into government securities
and thereby help keep down infla
tion.
The quarter's quota is 100 per cent
from each living group, which means
contributions from each of the 3,500
registered students, because it is the
responsibility of each individual to
help prevent inflation, according to
War Board sponsors.
Representatives will sell war
stamps in each house on the Row
and in each Hall throughout the
day. All living groups have set up
revolving funds from their treasur
ies to buy stamps, and each house
salesman purchases stamps and re
sells them to the residents.
Four Booths
Students are reminded that if they
purchase stamps at any of the four
booths, which are located in the Libe,
the Cellar, on English and Engi
neering corners, they may report
| this purchase to their representative
and it will count in with the house
| percentage.
House percentages are compiled
| on a basis of one stamp for each per
j son in the house.
