## German Forces Leave Tripoli 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 20 (UP).â€”Axis
forces were reported to be abandon
ing Tripoli today as British planes
assaulted motor transports fleeing
along tlie coastal road for Tunisia,
and unofficial advices placed the
vanguard of the Eighth Army al
ready in the outskirts of the great
Libyan port.
British fighter pilots reported the
coastal road leading west from Tri
poli toward Tunisia is a strafer's
paradise with a solid line of traffic
pulling out from the city.
German trucks and transports
were speeding away so hurriedly,
French reports said, that they are
traveling with lights on until the
RAF planes actually swoop down to
the attack.
"We started fires along five or six
miles of congested traffic and blew
up and wrecked scores of vehicles,"
the report quoted pilots returning
from strafing attacks.
Unofficial reports said Field Mar
shal Erwin Rommel had started
evacuating Tripoli by sea. but it
was more likely most of the Axis
forces would attempt to reach Tu
nisia by the land route.
British naval forces dominate the
sea route and only yesterday the
admiralty announced a smashing
victory in the central Mediterranean
in which destroyers and submarines
sank 14 enemy vessels and damaged
three others.
Authoritative British quarters of
fered no confirmation that the van
guard of the Eighth Army had
reached Tripoli's outskirts. Two
columns are converging on the city,
one from the south which lias passed
Tarhuna. 40 miles from Tripoli, and
another along the coastal road from
the east.
