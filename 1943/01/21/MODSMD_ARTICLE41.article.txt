Marston A. "Mushy" Girard, for
ner member of the great 1940 track !
earn, is still winning races, but now, j
lot in a uniform of the Cardinal
?ed, but in olive drab for the U.S.
Vrmy Air Corps.
In a recent letter to Gannett
foung, enthusiastic Stanford track i
an, Mush told of how he bested some
3 runners, including a star from
he Millrose Athletic Club of New
fork, over a difficult cross-country
ourse.
It seems that Girard, along with
11 the other aviation cadets at Max
veil Field, near Montgomery, Ala.,
uid to train for physical fitness by
unning over this course, which was
o difficult that it became to be
mown as the Burma Road.
Bui. here is the way Mush de
cribes the race:
"I won the race over the Burma

ad. but had to run myself out com
ietcly to do it. I didn't think there
'ere any "pros" in the camp besides
lyself, but when we showed up for
le race one of the boys was sport
tg track shoes (everyone else had
ic regulation big black ones). When
le same fellow pulled off his sweat
lirt he had on a Milh'ose A.C.
pper. I knew then I had a race on
ly hands because the Millrose men
e pretty good.
"The field of G3 started fast, but
y the half-mile mark "Millrose"
id I had pulled out in front. At
ie mile I decided to shoot the works
id went 20 yards out in front. This
>rt of surprised him, and he never
d get the yardage back, and I won
>ing away by 35 yards. The time
as 8:47 for about l 7 /s miles."
Mr. Young thinks that Mush was
fine shape, for the time was sen
itional. It is the equivalent of 9:22
r an even two miles. That would
; very good time for Angell Field,
fact, better time than any Stan
rd undergraduate has ever nego
ited.
Mush is in training for the Army
ir Corps, and is aiming to be a
irsuit pilot. He says that it is his
nbition to follow in the footsteps
former teammates Les Johnsen,
ick Moore, and Paul Moore, and
ake out as good as they have done.
Mush was a member of the record
eaking, four-man two-mile relay
am, and was a teammate with such
us as Clyde Jeffery, Ken Battag
i, Dick Simpson, Sid Hayes, Bob
one, Russ Wulf, Burman Skrable,
an Anderson, Bob Kenyon, and
untless others.
