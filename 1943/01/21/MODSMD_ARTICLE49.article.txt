# Farm Cagers May Look Up To Tall Cal Bears Friday
## 
### Ed Luce 
Stanford's skyscraping cage quintet may be looking up instead of down,
for the first time in many months come this Friday evening.
According to Coach Everett Dean, who with Woody Weir watched the
Bears nearly topple U.S.C. last Saturday, the Cal five is at least as tall as
the Indians, and might even average a little higher.

Thus, the first of the season's four
Big Games looms as a battle of
backboard wizards, with plenty of
rough going under and around the
hops. Both the Bears and Cards
controlled the backboards against
Ernie Holbrook's tiny Trojans, the
Berkeley boys scoring most of their
points via the tip-in route.
California's height is found in the
two forward and center posts, which
explains the Bears' aptitude under
the basket. With Indian guards
Howie Dallmar, Fred Oliver, and
Leo McCaffery, and center Ed Voss
all well past the six-foot mark, a
battle royal should develop.
Dean Encouraged
Dean was much encouraged with
the practice performances turned in
by the N.C.A.A. champs yesterday
afternoon in the Pavilion. The
workout was the hardest and best of
the week, with every member of the
squad looking good.
Johnny Eikelman, husky reserve
center who was kept out of the S.C.
game with an infection, was back in
uniform, and scored several times in
a lengthy scrimmage. Because of
Enkelman's injury, first string center
Ed Voss had to play the whole 40
minutes against the Trojans. The
squad will hold a light, tapering off
drill this afternoon.
Cards Get Shots
Latest repercussion from the
U.S.C. encounter came the other
day when Dean and the rest of the
squad studied last Friday's shot
chart. The Cards discovered that
they had had more, and better shots
than the Southerners, but lost out
because they couldn't match the
shooting averages of Rock.
The chart showed the Indians were
getting the shots, however, and need
only to convert them into baskets
to break into the conference win

column. Dean summed it up by say
ing, "In all probability, the team
I having the best shooting percentage
this coming Friday will win."'
After the Cal game, the Cards go
j right back into action against the
University ol' San Francisco in the
I Pavilion Saturday. Winners over
j both Santa Clara and California, the
j Dons are expected to offer stiff com
i petition. U.S.F. is rated as one of
1 the strongest squads in the Bay
Area.
Forward Mushy Silver has been
| the Dons' big gun in games to date,
j and. if hot, might spark U.S.F. to an
upset win. Dean will start the same
; lineup both nights, consisting of Jack
i Dana and Fred Linari at forwards.
I Voss at center, and Dallmar, and
either Oliver or McCaffery at
j guards.
