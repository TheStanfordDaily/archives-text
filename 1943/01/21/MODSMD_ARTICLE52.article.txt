# The 						Debate a Success
## 
### 
TN The Daily for Tuesday morning a Campus
L Opinion written by "A Realist" was printed.
Since that time a great many people have writ
ten letters either supporting or condemning the
writer and his views on the war and peace.
Nci only does The Daily feel that "A Realist"
is wrong in his outlook on the future of the
world, but it seems that a large number of the
Stanford student body do too, since a large
portion of the Auditorium of Memorial Hall was
filled at last night's debate.
The debate and the forum last night was a
marked success since it has stimulated a large
amount of discussion and controversy on sub
jects about which all of us must think.
