W'ELL, it looks like Encina hasn't quite yet
wised up.
At least there is one young Stanford man
there who still thinks that it is a very funny and
extremely clever and cute trick to phone up
the Firehouse and tell the young men there
that a fire is burning in Encina.
" This occurred last Monday night. It caused
a general disruption of studies at the Firehouse,
used a little extra rubber and gasoline from the
Firehouse truck, and caused a lot of unneces
sary excitement.
This will probably only cost Encina SlOO and
the whole little incident will, as in the past,
probably be soon forgotten.
But it just seems stupid.—Eill Steif
