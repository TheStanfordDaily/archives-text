# Student Government
## 
### 
YESTERDAY a small portion of the student
body of Stanford voted to change the con
stitution of the Associated Students and to put
student body government firmly on a four
quarter basis until the war is over.
Maybe the student body should be chastised
for so small a portion of them voting or showing
any apparent interest in the problem.
If it is total lack of interest they should be
chastised, because it is for them that the stu
dent body government is carried on and it is j
their wishes and demands that the Executive
Committee must heed. How can the students
be in a position to criticize Excom when they j
aren't sufficiently interested to vote on a change j
in their constitution.
However, there seems to me point in !
being shocked at the lack of interest if it 1
comes from the fact that the subject is so one- !
sided. Of the few that did vote today only 25
voted against the proposed amendment.
If the small number of votes cast yesterday 1
is indicative of lack of interest in student gov
ernment or merely in the question to be de
cided, students may take a more active part in ,
their government by coming to the Excom
meetings which are held every Wednesday
night in the Old Union.
