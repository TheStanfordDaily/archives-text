# OUR HASHER SEZ

How many of you didn't exercise your fran
chise yesterday? We don't get to exercise our
franchise very often now, what with war-time
emergency powers in effect. And as a result
people are always getting pushed out of shape
'cause it isn't democratic.
Then comes an election and a plebiscite all
in one day, and most of you stay home. Okay,
so it did rain a little; if you really were interested
in what was going on you would vote anyway.
We don't blame the frosh much if they were
not interested in who their class officers were
going to be, but to the student body in general
â€”the finger of shame is upon you.
In coming months you may be pushed out of
shape because you think we should have a
four-quarter election system, and we have a
three-quarter system. But it will be your own
fault.
If you were in jail, you would jump at the
chance to vote. Look at Frances Farmer. Are
you looking?
