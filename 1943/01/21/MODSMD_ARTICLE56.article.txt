The Editor, Sir:
To me, "A Realist's" article of January 19 in
The Daily was of some concern. I do not wish
to advance an opinion concerning the perti
nence of the SWB's sponsorship of the debate
on post-war world organization, but the mimicry
of "cross bridges when you come to them,"
particularly in reference to the above problem,
is nothing more than an evasive alternative.
Whenever a seemingly unsolvable problem
necessarily follows some present task, the
easy response would be to refuse to consider
the imminent question. Or should we say,
"Don't do today what you can put' off till to
morrow"?
Yes, Mr. Realist, you have a point in "why
don't we leave these problems to Herbert Hoo
ver, Hugh Gibson, and Lewis Mumford?" Your
only trouble is that of your relatively. small
scope or inclusion. There are those who can
best serve our country by fighting right now,
others by preparing themselves further in the
technical and material sciences, and still others
by becoming more familiar with the social sci
ences. Those of the last group are the ones to
whom the blame for wars usually falls, so may
be these humanity-conscious people might profit
by facing their problem that lies ahead. Would
you prefer to find ourselves floundering in a
repetition of past actions?
Yes, American production was not crossing
its bridge by not gearing itself to war materials
until the circumstances made it absolutely nec
essary. You know the result of that lack of
initiative in the right direction. At any rate, we
are still trying to gird ourselves.
You have some other good points, Mr. Real
ist, but again your trouble is hasty comments
rather than more objective conclusions. You
bet we've got to win this war, and the only
way we can win it is by getting in and doing
whatever our respective parts may be. But don't'
forget that by far the more difficult task will be
to devise a working peace. Look around you,
my friend; look at some of the war-widowed
mothers, or an embittered or plain grief-stricken 1
sweetheart. Do you advocate recurrence of!
these? Or are they worth providing for a small
fraction of peace planning effort along with our
war effort? Could not a little consideration for j
post-war activities accompany that of war and j
serve to keep us on a more even keel? I hope
so!
Come now, Mr. Realist, have you never en
gaged in some activity that lessened the qual
ity of your next day's assignments? Hypocrisy :
is a subterfuge not to be respectedâ€”but my j
pardon to you, from an interested friend.
