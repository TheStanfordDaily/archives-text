# Anderson, Bonner Win Frosh Election: Light Vote Passes New Amendments
## Frosh Cast 191 Votes In Close Class Election 
### 
In a surprisingly light election, Stanford's student body voted to accept
the proposed revisions of its constitution, while Farm freshmen elected
Martin Anderson and Barbara Bonner to represent them as president and
secretary-treasurer of their class.
The amendments, which revised the terms and methods of electing almost

all Stanford student officers,
passed 270 to 25. A total of 295 stu- ,
dents out of the more than 3,500 |
registered at Stanford cast their bal- l
lots in the election.
"Although we expected a light ;
vote yesterday, we were surprised j
at the number showing up at the J
pollsâ€”or rather we were surprised j
at the number not showing up," !
said Bud Ambrose, chairman of the 1
Election Board. "Even the total
freshman vote of 191 was consider
ably less than we had anticipated."
"A" Election
Acceptance of the amendments
means that Stanford's general elec
tion, now known as the "A" election,
will be held this quarter instead of
the next quarter as has been custo
mary in the past.
Anderson, a second quarter fresh
man from Oroville. received 96 votes,
9 more than the 87 ballots cast for \
Dave Freeman, his nearest opponent.;
Bart;y Weber followed with 56.
Miss Bonner held an 11-vote mar- '
gin over her nearest rival. Katherine 1
Jane Supple, with a total of 91 to 80
votes. Miss Bonner is a second I
quarter freshman from Los Angeles j
and a resident of Roble. Both Miss |
Bonner and Miss Supple were con- !
siderablv ahead of the other six ,
nominees.
