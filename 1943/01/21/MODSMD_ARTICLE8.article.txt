# Nursery Schools Need College Girls as Aids
## 
### 
The "Y" has received a request
from Castilleja in Palo Alto for girls
to take care of children in nursery
schools from 9 to 12 a.m. every day
including Saturday. The children
are those of war workers. Girls who
want to work should call Miss Pat
Davidson at 9810.
