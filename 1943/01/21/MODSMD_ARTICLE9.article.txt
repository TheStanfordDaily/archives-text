Donald Tresidder, chairman of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, who pre

Opening the discussion on Post
war World Organization, Rober*
Stotler, Stanford pre-med student
offered an amendment to the ques
tion: Should there be a permanen
federation of the United Nations
when he declared that Americ
should not give up any of her sov
ereignty in order to join a work
federation.
Post-War Greece
This opinion of Stotler's was ob
jected to by Nathaniel Allyn, a firs:
generation American of Greek an
cestry who declared that once tht

play an important part, and thi
only by the formation of a feder

the reconstruction of Greece after
the* war should be left to Greece
rather than to the rest of the world.
Mr. Kwok Lam-Shan of China
declared that a federal union if es
tablished should be participated in
by all the peoples of the world. He
asked the debaters to answer the
questions: How could such a fed-
the one proposed enforce

and maintain peace, and how much
leadership would be granted to each
country, especially those in the Far

on the degree of independence of
all nations, the peace of the East
cannot be guaranteed until all na

tions are freed.
After Mr. Saksena's speech, Dr.
Tlesidder called on Frank Church
to debate on the affirmative side of
the question of the formation of a
federal union. Church called as
witness an expert debater from the
University of Southern California,
Seymour Vinocur, who has been
touring the country debating on
post-war reconstruction.

ereignty is now "out of date," stand
ing as "a barrier to security and
happiness." He proposed that a un
ion be established with authority to
lax, to settle national disputes, and
to maintain peace. He claimed that
this union must be established for
the preservation of freedom and
lasting peace.
Robert Vallier representing the
negative side of the question called
as witness John Baird, also of the
debate team from U.S.C. Vallier,
after refuting Church's arguments,
presented other plans of post-war
organization, which he claimed
should be analyzed and discussed.
The debate was judged by Mrs.
Roger Goodan, Mr. Frank F. Walker,
and Mr. Paul H. Davis and was
sponsored by the Debate Council
and the Stanford War Board.

to maintain peace. He claimed that
this union must be established for

the reconstruction of Greece after
the* war should be left to Greece
rather than to the rest of the world.
Mr. Kwok Lam-Shan of China
declared that a federal union if es
tablished should be participated in
by all the peoples of the world. He
asked the debaters to answer the
questions: How could such a fed-
the one proposed enforce

and maintain peace, and how much
leadership would be granted to each
country, especially those in the Far
East?
The small countries of Europe
were supported by Jackeline Arm
strong, representing France, and

slovakia. George Domingo Shelton
of Panama pressed the case for
stronger Pan-American relations.
Mr. Chandra R. Saksena, a Ja
maican of Indian parents, presented
the point of view of the people of
India who feel that they should be
given a guarantee of their freedom
and independence before being ex
pected to fight in this war. Accord
ing to Mr. Saksena, since the suc
cess of a world federation depends
on the degree of independence of
all nations, the peace of the East
cannot be guaranteed until all na

tions are freed.
After Mr. Saksena's speech, Dr.
Tlesidder called on Frank Church
to debate on the affirmative side of
the question of the formation of a
federal union. Church called as
witness an expert debater from the
University of Southern California,
Seymour Vinocur, who has been
touring the country debating on
post-war reconstruction.

Church declared that national sov
ereignty is now "out of date," stand
ing as "a barrier to security and
happiness." He proposed that a un
ion be established with authority to
lax, to settle national disputes, and
to maintain peace. He claimed that
this union must be established for
the preservation of freedom and
lasting peace.

negative side of the question called
