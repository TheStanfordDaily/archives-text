# FRATERNITIES
## Men's Rushing Ends Tonight With Final Preference Dinner 
### 
It will all be over but the shouting on the Row tonight as houses look
over their prospective pledge classes at preference dinners from 6 to 9
p.m. Formal pledging will take place tomorrow from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. in
the Women's Clubhouse, ending the 1943 rushing program.
Following tonight's dinners, Row men and frosh will observe a period

.silence will be severely dealt with,
Lee Peake, Interfratemity president,
has warned.
Tomorrow night, Farm fraterni
ties will hold open houses and dances
for their pledges. A special edition
of The Daily, with a list of all
pledges, will be issued tomorrow
night.
Rushing chairmen are requested
by Peake to turn in their pledge
cards to the Interfratemity office
from 8 to 9 tonight if possible, or
from 8 to 9 tomorrow morning.
At a special meeting Wednesday
night, rushing chairmen were in
formed of the proper form for pledge
cards. Cards for preference dinners
and pledge cards may still be ob
tained at the A.S.S.U. office this
morning.
Peake reminded rush chairmen
of Interfratemity rules which apply
to rushing and pledging. No-house
may pledge more than 14 freshmen.
A freshman is considered to be any
one with less than 45 units. No
pledge is binding until formal pledg
ing. No house may pledge a fresh
man who is on probation.
This year's rushing saw drastic
changes in the regular program made
by Interfratemity Council to con
form to wartime conditions. The
entire rush period was shortened to
2Va weeks and afternoon rush per
iods were eliminated to allow as
much time as possible for studies
during the intensive rushing sched
ule.
The food and labor shortage did
not hit fraternities as hard as was
feared at the beginning of the quar
ter. The Council found it unneces
sary to eliminate any lunch or din
ner meals.
