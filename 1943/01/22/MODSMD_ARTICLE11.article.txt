## Tripoli Fall Imminent, Axis Forces Evacuating 
### 
LONDON, Jan. 21 (U.R)â€”Madrid
dispatches said tonight that Axis 1
forces were exacuating flaming Tri
poli with every available small boat
and barge in the face of heavy at- j
tack from Allied planes in a minor I
Dunquerque which was expected to
culminate in the fall of the city with
in a few hours.
There was no official explanation
here of the evacuation, and the Ma- {
drid report, quoting advices from j
the Allied base at Bone, Algeria, did ;
not cite an Allied authority.
Afrika Korps Flees
Earlier reports from Cairo said, |
however, that part of Marshal Erwin
Rommel's riddled Afrika Korps was
fleeing westward from Tripoli by
land under a hail of Allied bombs
and bullets and the United States
Under-Secretary of War Robert j
Patterson said in Washington that I
the fall of the city seemed "a mat
ter of hours."
Demolition Squads
A Madrid report said that Tripoli
was described as partially blocked
by sunken vessels while scores of
fires raged along the waterfront.
Part of the Axis army was reported
trying to escape in small vessels j
towing long strings of heavily laden j
barges under constant attack by Al- |
lied planes and light British war
ships.

Axis demolition squads have done
heavy damage on bridges 6n both
sides of Tripoli, hampering the Brit
ish as they approached the city from
the east and south with tanks and
troops.
Patterson emphasized that, al
though Rommel probably would not
be able to make another stand east
of Tunisia, he had withdrawn in fair
order with minimum losses.
