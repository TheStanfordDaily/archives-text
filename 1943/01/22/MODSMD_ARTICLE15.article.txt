### 
Stanford's annual Junior Prom
I will be held at the start of Spring
j Quarter if a suitable date can be
arranged, according to Ferris
I Boothe, junior class president.
Rejecting a proposal to hold a
'joint Junior-Senior Prom this quar

ter, the class Executive Board de
cided to hold their annual class dance
next quarter before members of
reserve groups leave school. It was
believed that the Senior Prom was
essentially a senior function and
should be left to that class.

Pasadena J.C., was named to th.
Executive Board to replace Bctt;
| Blystone, who did not return t.
I school this quarter. Members of th.
board include Janet McCfanahar
Helen Campbell, Helen Savory, Har
Howard, Bob McClean. Lucien Rict
Johnny Twitchell. Bruce Wylie. an.

THESE CHINESE WOMEN and children do not have modern equipment to work with, but when Ameri
cans need an airfield, somewhere in China, they {jet ti> work with tin* tools they have. They consider it a
patriotic duty to build that field.
