ington, D.C.. where he will assume
a captaincy in the special services
division of the Array.
Dr. Esslinger, inventor of a famed
series of physical fitness tests, will
work with Colonel Theodore Bank
and Dr. C. H. McCloy in establish
ing schools to train officers and men
in the techniques of his physical lit
ness examination. His test has been
approved by the army in a special
training circular a?id is recognized
by the Army's General Staff.
In commenting about the Army's
acceptance of his stiff physical
standards, Dr. Esslinger said that
today's Army is physically not as
tough as was that of 25 years ago
and that it is hoped that this pro
gram will aid in stepping up the
physical fitness of the Army.
Dr. Esslinger was asked to come
to Washington some time ago.
He stated that he was "loath to
leave Stanford" but that he felt that
he was being of more service to the
war effort by helping train the Ar
my s five million men than by
merely working with Stanford's sev
eral thousand men.
Only Wednesday, in fact, Dr. Ess

linger gave instruction in physical
fitness to 120 officers right on the
Stanford campus. "These 120 offi
cers,"' said Dr. Esslinger, "repre
sented around 25,000 Army men."
Concerning Stanford men, he em
phasized that "Stanford student:;

have responded in a most remark
able fashion to their need for physi
; eal fitness." "Never," said Dr. Ess
linger, "have 1 seen a bunch of
| young men so determined to build
i up strength, endurance, and agility.'
- He added that it was "gratifying to
I see such conscientiousness," and
that il was this which one day might
| "save many men's lives."
Dr. Esslinger graduated from the
University of Illinois in 1931 and re
ceived his doctorate in physical edu
cation at the lowa University in 1938.
