# Colleges to Build Centers in China
## 
### 
Student Service Centers may
again be established in war torn
China. Everyone has heard the
story of how the bombed Chinese
students trekked across hundreds of
miles of rough terrain to reach West
China. There they established new
universities in order to continue their
education which is so vital to Chi
nese resistance, as well as to their
future.
The World Student Service Fund
in New York City has announced
that these centers may lie named
after American colleges who are
willing to donate the money. The
centers can be operated for approxi
mately $000 a year.
These refugee universities have
not been well equipped and need
funds to be completed. Centers have
been established to make up for some
n! the deficiencies such as dormitory
facilities. Another function of these
centers has been to serve as a place
where news can be received and
read. Radios are planned for each
center, and students will be much
more in touch with the outside
world.
The centers provide simple re-
Ireshments, self-help barber shop,
and other conveniences which are
now denied to the students. A small
recreation room is provided for the
limited social and recreational life
available to students.
At present the policy is to rent
several rooms in a building, rather
than to build a house since it is
cheaper and there is less loss from
air raids. The centers are generally
staffed by volunteer student help
under a local Student. Relief Com
mittee Secretary. Today there are
only six of these university centers
in Free China and 12 more are ur
gent lv needed.
