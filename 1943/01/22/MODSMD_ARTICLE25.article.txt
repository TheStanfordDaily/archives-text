# 'Forest Rangers' Tops for Action

I'OREST UAIS'GKRS, now playing
at the Stanford.
"Forest Rangers" is in most ways
remarkable and in some, magnifi
cent.
It starts right out in the first
scene with a forest fire and a hair
breadth air rescue through the tree
tops, and awesome photography
It is also a lot of fun—lusty sing
ing, celebrations, triteless situations,
and Lynne Overman.
And technicolor does not hurt
Paulette Goddard any.—Covey
