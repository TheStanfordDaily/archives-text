# Red Cross Urges All Women To Work on Army Dressings
## 
### 
Working on surgical dressings for
the Army, the Red Cross Workshop
is open to all women on campus
from 10 to 12 in the mornings and
from 1 to 4 in the afternoons on
Monday through Friday.
"This is one of the few concrete
ways in which a woman may help
in the war effort," said Mrs. La-
Pierre, chairman. The Army needs
these dressings, and it is depending
upon us to make them. College
women and women who have jobs
at Stanford or who keep house can't
get work in a war plant unless they
stop what they are doing now. These
women can do their share, however,
by helping to make surgical dress
ings."
The Red Cross Workshop has
been separated from the War Board
Workshop, according to Rosemary,
because since surgical dressings are
made ior the Army they must be
made under supervision to insure
their correctness.
Another reason that the workshops
have been separated is that the
Red Cross Workshop is open to all
women on campus and not just to
students. Contrary to story pub
lished in The Daily yesterday, how
ever, the quota of women assigned
to each living group includes work

ers for the Red Cross Workshop as
well as for that of the War Board.
"We don't want," said Mrs. La-
Pierre, "women that come once and
then never come again. That hap
pened last quarter. Making surgical
dressings is harder than making
scrapbooks. We want women who
will volunteer to come and work
more than once. We want women
who will volunteer to come and
work once a week."
It isn't necessary," she continued,
"to wear a wash dress, although we
would appreciate it if people would,
because there are some aprons here
for use. Students may come in for
an hour sometimes in the morning
and work. We would like them to.
