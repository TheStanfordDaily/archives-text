# Trebling Troubadours Troubled by Troopers
## 
### Ray Hayes 
Several nights ago, three Stanford
men in a romantic frame of mind
equipped themselves with their gui
tars and mandolins, and went up
to the boathouse at Lagunita Lake
to serenade the doves and anyone
else who might be Interested. Their
voices were particularly resonant
that night, so resonant in fact that
they drifted serenely into the frus
trated ears of Roble's frosh who
hadn't yet turned out all their lights.
The frosh greeted the troubadours
after their first selection, which was
a real rousing tune, with an en
thusiastic bit of hand-clapping
which, though it was a surprise, was
more of a satisfaction. To prove this
satisfaction, the trio then harmonized
on Tumbling Tumblcweed. Some
body must have been off-key when
they sang this one for someone in
side Roble's hall called the cops and
said, "There is a disturbance in back
of Roble."
Spotting the police before the cops
spotted them, the three singers fled
down the lake bank with the issu
ance of the every-man-for-himself
manifesto cheering them on.
With characteristic efficiency, how
ever, the cops quickly confiscated
one of the culprits and his mando
lin. There were two left. Adopting
craftiness, they hid together in a
hunk of brush high on the bank.
One was crouching; the other was
sprawled flat in the brush covered
with a black raincoat and evily
clutching his guitar, although he
wanted no violence unless neces
sary. The croucher was caught, but
this time with characteristic blind
ness the cops failed to recognize the
fairly obvious presence of the third
criminal.
Determined to keep a spotless
record free from the ink of the po
lice blotter, the third troubadour lay

in the brush for close to 30 minutes,
refusing to breathe for danger of
losing his life.
Finally, he could stand it no long
er. He dashed madly down the beach
across the rocks, crawled through
brush, lurked behind trees, com
pleting a three-quarters circle of the
lake. He then took to the open road,
intending to circle the campus, so
bent was he on independence.
After two hours of belly-sliding in
muddy ditches, climbing through
barbed wire, brandishing his guitar
at irritated watch-dogs, and hell,
he sneaked via the window into his
roomâ€”a fugitive from injustice and
those, who, he believes, are using
the war as an excuse to destroy
Stanford's arts and artists.
