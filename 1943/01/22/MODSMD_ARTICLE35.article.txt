# Speigleberg Completes Lectures on Japanese
## 
### 
Professor Speigleberg has just re
turned from Beloit College in Wis
consin where he has been conduct
ing a two-week lecture course on
Japanese psychology.
llis class at Stanford, The Jap
; anese Mind, is concerned with an
! understanding of Japanese mental
' processes by studying their expres
sion in Shinto and their training
' through Confucianism, Taoism, and
Buddhaism. A study is made of an
interpretation of Japanese strategy
1 and the necessity of finding a basis
| for Japanese cooperation in the com-
I ing world peace.
According to- Professor Speigle
' berg, author of two books on the
Orient, "Secularization of Japanese
: Mentality" and "The Secret of the j
Japanese Bushido," in order to ef- :
fectively combat (he Japanese it is
essential to understand their feudal- 1
istic background and their extreme !
loyalty to Emperor and country.
The very essence of Bushido, the |
knighthood of Japan, is found in the j
j Jap's devotion to his superiors and j
lack of individuality. One of the
most remarkable difference between '
the Japanese mind and our own is J
â–  that the individualism which is so !
highly valued in our country is en- '
tirely lacking in Japan. This knowl
edge of the restricted importance of j
the individual is a decided asset in
time of national emergency when the j
j machinery of war must move as a
I whole.

Professor Speigleberg believes thai
we must use the lesson of Peai"
Harbor not so much to inspire hatred
as to teach us the absolute necessity
for understanding our potential ene
mies. Those few who had made v
study of the tactics of the Japanese
previous to Dec. 7 foresaw the at
tack and, says Professor Speigleberg
we have only ourselves to blame fox
being so disastrously surprised. Il
lustrative of the lack of interest oui
country as a whole has shown foi
the Far East is the fact that there
were so few responses to the gov
ernment's call for those who spoke
Japanese and understood the Jap
anese people.
"We must hasten to the task ant l
make up for our unexcusable lack;
ol preparation," emphasizes Pro
fessor Speigleberg.
He will lecture on the subject
again in March at Wellesley Col leg.
in Massachusetts.
