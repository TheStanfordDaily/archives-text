the finest yearling teams in Stan
ford's great swimming history.

for the 50-yard dash, tied the na
tional frosh record. His 100-yard
free-style times last year ranked
among the best in the country.
Dick Narver, another freshman
star, will swim the 100 and 220 free
styles. Narver was a winner in the
220 and took a consistent second to
Gamble in the 100.
Two of the last year's freshman
backstrokers, A1 Weeden and Bob
Mapol. consistently bettered varsity
times in these events. Weeden
cracked his brother's school fresh
man record in the 150-yard back
stroke.
Hank Saltonstall, unbeaten in a
freshman competition, leads the
breast strokers with the greatly im
proved Bud Carpenter not far be
hind. Saltonstall. Carpenter, Cashin,
and Egeler will give Stanford real
strength in the breast stroke.

Dick Williams, and Paul Balla vying
for the two starting positions.

' winner last year. Munroe should re
i peat his dominance in 1943.
Added to these men are Bill
| Mapel, varsity sprinter from last
year, and Clint Eastman, who made
I great improvement last year and
I should become eligible this year,
j One is Emmett Cashin, one of the
i finest sprinters in the country. His
j specialty is the breast stroke, but he
can be counted upon to take points
in the sprints and even in the back
stroke if necessary.
Paul Egeler, a transfer from Ful
lerton J.C. last year, is the other
man. He swims breast stroke and
will add strength to this event.
But the real strength will come
from the men of the unbeaten 1942

frosh outfit, which ranked as one of
the finest yearling teams in Stan
ford's great swimming history.
In the sprints is unbeaten Jim
Gamble, whose 23.3 second mark
for the 50-yard dash, tied the na
tional frosh record. His 100-yard
free-style times last year ranked
among the best in the country.
Dick Narver, another freshman
star, will swim the 100 and 220 free
styles. Narver was a winner in the
220 and took a consistent second to
Gamble in the 100.
Two of the last year's freshman
backstrokers, A1 Weeden and Bob
Mapol. consistently bettered varsity
times in these events. Weeden
cracked his brother's school fresh
man record in the 150-yard back
stroke.
Hank Saltonstall, unbeaten in a
freshman competition, leads the
breast strokers with the greatly im
proved Bud Carpenter not far be
hind. Saltonstall. Carpenter, Cashin,
and Egeler will give Stanford real
strength in the breast stroke.
Diving will find Corky Schreiber,
a winner against California last year,
Dick Williams, and Paul Balla vying
for the two starting positions.
Composed mainly of men return
i ing from the 1942 freshman team,
Stanford's varsity swimming team
has started heavy workouts for its
opening meet, the annual interclass
meet Feb. 4, according to Coach
Ernie Brandsten.
Just two men, Capt. Don Smith,
and Ted Munroe, return from the
1942 varsity first string. Smith, a
senior who was captain last year,
has been a mainstay of the team in
sprints and middle distance races.
His iron man act of scoring in three
events was the big reason for Stan
ford's upset defeat of California last
year.
Munroe, a junior, is another
rugged swimmer. As a sophomore
j last year, he was one of the most
i outstanding 220 and 440 swimmers
on the coast. A consistent double
' winner last year. Munroe should re
