# CREW
## Oarsmen Solve Travel Problem 
### 
The Stanford crew has solved its
transportation problem at last. Ac
cording to Coach Carl Pedersen, a
trailer has been bought which can
be attached to the truck the men
already have. The trailer will hold
about 25 fellows, and along with the
truck will accommodate the entire
crew squad.
The trailer is a welcome addition
to the crew equipment, as the oars
men have had to supply their own
transportation back and forth from
the yacht harbor heretofore.
The crew is still without a coach's
launch, and they are working on
that now. They would greatly ap
preciate it if anyone who owns or
km >ws the whereabouts of a motor
boat capable of going 25 miles per
hour would notify them. They
would be willing to rent the boat
if the owners are unwilling to loan
it.
The other crew equipment is rap
idly being whipped into shape. Work
is proceeding on the last shell which
Cal gave us and also on the one
donated by Washington.
Ihe oarsmen are still working in
two sectionsâ€”each coming out three
days a week. This plan will be con
tinued until Coach Pedersen feels
the men are ready for daily work
outs.
The- spirit of the men is excep
tionally high, Pedersen said; and the
men are getting into fit condition in
preparation for the grueling races
ahead of them.
Hal Hopper, a freshman out for
crew for the first time this quarter,
showed much promise working the
stroke position this week. Bud
Clary, a veteran oarsman, is now
stroke in the first shell; but it is ex
pected that Hopper will offer him
some stiff competition.
Pedersen stresses the importance
of physical fitness in crew training.
Every man out for the sport is doing
a good job in preparing himself for
the strenuous activities of the fight
ing man, he said.
