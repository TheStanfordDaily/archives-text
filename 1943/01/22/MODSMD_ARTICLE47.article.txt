First of lour BIG GAMES for Bay
Area hoop fans. Stanford pJays Cali
fornia tonight at 8 in Berkeley, both
a "last chance" and a traditional
battle for the two contenders for the
P.C.C. cellar.
All of the rivalry between the In
dians and the Golden Bears, dor
mant since that delightful football
game toward the end of November,
flares out again—the odds being
about 50-50.
Both teams must have the victory
Ui keep them in any sort of running"
at all in southern division confer
ence play, since the new ruling al
lows Cal only one more shot at
U.C.L.A., while Stanford has but
one game left with the title-bound
Trojans.
Title Chances
Stanford has a possible chance of
ending in the running for the title:
if U.S.C. finds the Bruins too tough
for them in at least two of their four
coming games in the southland and
if Stanford can wax Gene Rock on
Feb. 15 in Los Angeles.
But the cards are stacked against
Everett Dean. The Trojans have al
ready wiped Cal from their slate,
two straight, must face Stanford
only once more. Then they get four
games with U.C.L.A., not considered
as tough as our own Cards.
Tonight's match will be another
meeting of two skyscraper quints, a
decided change from that deadly
midget Eock. Both of Cal's forwards
and their center top six feet.

weekend.

First of lour BIG GAMES for Bay
Area hoop fans. Stanford pJays Cali
fornia tonight at 8 in Berkeley, both
a "last chance" and a traditional
battle for the two contenders for the
P.C.C. cellar.
All of the rivalry between the In
dians and the Golden Bears, dor
mant since that delightful football
game toward the end of November,
flares out again—the odds being
about 50-50.

at all in southern division confer
ence play, since the new ruling al
lows Cal only one more shot at
U.C.L.A., while Stanford has but
one game left with the title-bound
Trojans.
Title Chances
Stanford has a possible chance of
ending in the running for the title:
if U.S.C. finds the Bruins too tough
for them in at least two of their four
coming games in the southland and
if Stanford can wax Gene Rock on
Feb. 15 in Los Angeles.
But the cards are stacked against
Everett Dean. The Trojans have al
ready wiped Cal from their slate,
two straight, must face Stanford
only once more. Then they get four
games with U.C.L.A., not considered
as tough as our own Cards.
Tonight's match will be another
meeting of two skyscraper quints, a
decided change from that deadly
midget Eock. Both of Cal's forwards
and their center top six feet.
