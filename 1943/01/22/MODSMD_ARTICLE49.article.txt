# PIGS AUCTIONED

### 
MARION, 111 (UP). â€”Petty Officer
First Class Don Lingle of the Marion
Navy reeuriting office wants to buy
Uncle Sam a battleship, and he and
a blue-eyed pig named "King Nep
tune" already have corralled $62,000
toward the cause.
The 263-pound Hereford, given to
the recruiting staff by a dairy of
West Frankfort, 111., was about to be
converted into pork dinners when
Lingle suggested: "Let's auction him
off for bonds and stamps."
Auctions were held at West
Frankfort, Marion and Herrin, the
latter swelling the total by $50,000.
Another was scheduled at Benton,
111. The auctions are unique, in that
highest bidders aren't entitled to
keep the pig.
"I'd like to see King Neptune auc
tioned enough times to buy a battle
ship or cruiser," Lingle said.
