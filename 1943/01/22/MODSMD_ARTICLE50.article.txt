# MEET USF TOMORROW
## 
### 
In the Pavilion Saturday night
Stanford meets the University of
San Francisco Dons, headed by Mr.
Mushy Silver at forward. This or
ganization is one of the strong in
dependent (out-conference) squads
in (he Bay Area this year. It has
beaten Cal and Santa Clara. The
latter held the Cards to a two-point
win, and the former gets its chance
tonight.
Thus a victory over San Francisco
will show that the Cards are defi
nitely on the upswing after their win
over Cal tonight.
