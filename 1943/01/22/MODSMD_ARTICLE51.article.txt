DAVID STARR JORDAN founded Stanford. Ray Lyman Wilbur
built Stanford into a great institution. Both demanded great
men.
Into every great university goes part of the character and
the hope of its builder. When one thinks of Harvard one thinks
Df President Eliot; of Chicago and Harper; of Cornell and White;
and of Stanford and Ray Lyman Wilbur.
Just as Chancellor Wilbur said yesterday of Dr. Tresidder
that he is "a Stanford man through and through," so it is true
of Chancellor Wilbur himself. He is a Stanford man.
All his life Chancellor Wilbur has been closely associated
with the University, and by that association both have gained
much. Chancellor Wilbur came to Stanford in 1892 and even as
a freshman he helped influence the future of the University.
Together with Herbert Hoover and a few other boys he formed
the nucleus of a non-fraternity or "hall" spirit that has made
Stanford unigue among Western colleges.
In 1896 Wilbur was graduated in physiology as president of
his class. The next year he served as an instructor in physiology
while studying for his master's degree, and in 1899 received his
M.D. from Cooper College prior to its absorption by Stanford.
Dr. Wilbur became a practicing physician and in 1910 be
came Dean of the Stanford Medical School. It was due to his
executive ability that the medical school improved and its stand
ards were constantly raised.
The same has happened since Dr. Wilbur became president
of the University. Not only have the academic standards of Stan
ford been ever raised, but also the position of the students has
been improved. It is under Dr. Wilbur that the Stanford Honor
Code became effective and it is under him that it has worked
for some twenty years.
In fact, Dr. Wilbur has had three careers: as educator—in
structor and assistant in physiology, and president of the Uni
versity; as doctor—practitioner, professor, and Dean of the
Medical School; and as statesman—Secretary of the Interior and
President of the Institute of Pacific Relations.
Ray Lyman Wilbur's life at Stanford and therefore Stanford
itself have been characterized by the words of his inaugural
address.
"An education which brings with it mere dilettantism is as
empty as a decorated eggshell. Education should be from the
heart outwards. It should strengthen the foundations of char
acter, enhance the spirit of helpfulness, the de3ire to be worth
while in the days, be they few or many, that lie before us.
Education should make us loyal—loyal to our university, to our
country, above all to truth."
