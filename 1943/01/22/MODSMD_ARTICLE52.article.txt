Appearing in yesterday's Stanford
Daily was the following story writ
ten by a lowly reporter on the paper
who shows a definite flare for pub
licity work, but who. at the same
tune, has a misguided sense of
humor:
Opening Sunday for a one-night
run in the Memorial Auditorium is
"The Private Life of Don Juan,"
starring Douglas Fairbanks, Merle
Oberon, Binnie Barnes, and Don
Juan Jr. Although the matinee is
completely sold out. excellent seats
are still available for the evening
performance at 20 cents a throw.
Running with the Don Juan
opus, which was called by critics
"the most tremendous costume
and action picture of August.
1932," will be the second chapter
of "The Clutching Hand," an edu
cational serial telling about mod
ern ways of scaring little children
out of their wits. Also selected
shorts.
Now it seems that Miss Emily
Howard, of Howard Sunday Series
fame, is a wee bit pushed out of
shape because this youngster in his
zeal disguised the facts slightly.
Her objections are as follows: (1)
Don Juan Jr. is obviously not a
member of the cast; (2) the picture
was released in September. 1932, and
not August, 1932; (3) the impres
sion that the seats are reserved is
erroneous. It seems that hundreds
of frosh girls showed up at the
A.S.S.U. offices yesterday intent on
getting one of the few remaining
seats; (4) the headline also gave a
faulty impression, "Don Juan to Run
at Sunday Series."
Miss Howard took over the Series
following Miss Nancy Haskins, of
Haskins Sunday Series fame, who
took office following Miss Barbara
Sadler, of Sadler Sunday Series
fame.
We cannot see fit to put the whole
blame on the reporter who was only
trying to put a little color in what
otherwise would have been a drab
story. Also, you will have to admit
that his publicity stunt worked, at
least as far as the frosh women were
concerned. He did. however, wool
the reading public to a slight degree,
which is "must not" in the news
paper business, or so I am given to
understand.
