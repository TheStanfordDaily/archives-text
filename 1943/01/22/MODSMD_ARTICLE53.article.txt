The Editor. Sir:
For some time I have been con
cerned with a matter regarding our
Honor Code.
Each examination sheet or book
requires a signature which certifies
that the rules for honorable conduct
have been observed.
Why must we re-assert our fidel
ity to the Honor Code idea when we
have pledged ourselves to uphold it
on Registration Day? Could it be
that honor fluctuates?
To me, having to the honor
pledge on every exam Is worse than
having someone stand over me with
a yardstick.
Sincerely
G. B, Grunewald, '45
