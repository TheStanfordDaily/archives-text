j SUmford Interest
"My chief interest in public serv

I "is Stanford."
Dr. Tresidder was born in Tipton.
Indiana, April 7. 1894. the son of Dr.
j and Mrs. James Treloar Tresidder.
; His father, mother and uncle all were

•Tresidder was born in Cornwall,
! England. On the distaff side, the
family of Dr. Sarah Emily Daum
! Tresidder were log cabin pioneer
1 homesteaders in Indiana. The father,
as a country doctor, required three
horses to meet the needs of his prac
tice. Payment for services usually
was "in kind"—hay or food produce
r labor—and seldom in cash.
The son, as a small boy, very often
•vent along, usually riding on the
.orse's back. His earliest intention
as to be a physician and this he
persisted in, overcoming many ob
>tacles before receiving the M.D. de

School.
After a year in a pre-medical
< ourse at the University of Chicago,

>rnia on a vacation trip. The train
•"as held up by a wreck, and he be
; '.me acquainted with a representa
ve of David A. Curry, an educator
ho had established a summer camp
1 Yosemite. This led to a summer's
•nployment at Camp Curry, where
Stanford professor invited him to
isit the university on his way home.
Being offered board and room in
he home of Professor R. L. Green
of the department of mathematics in
i xchange for services as cook, he
iook the job and hired an Oriental
to do the cooking until he learned
how. A long chain of pre-medical
students inherited the cook's job at
the Green home, from this begin
ning.
Air Service
In 1917 he enlisted in a base hos
pital unit, but after some months of
service at Camp Fremont, Menlo
Park, transferred to the air service
of the Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
He was graduated from the school of

Marriage
A romance that started in Yosem
ite culminated June 16, 1920 in the
marriage of Donald Tresidder and
Mary Curry, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. David A. Curry, the founders
of Camp Curry. Mary Curry had
entered Stanford with the class of
1916 but had completed the under
graduate course in three years, ma
joring in English, and receiving the
A.B. degree in 1915. She was a
member of Kappa Alpha Theta so
rority, and Phi Beta Kappa and Cap
and Gown honorary societies.
She had received the M.A. degi'ee
from Stanford in 1916, had taken
graduate work in English at Co
lumbia, and had completed all re
quirements for the Ph.D. degree in
English at Yale University except
the writing of her final thesis, which
was interrupted by the engagement
and marriage.
In 1922, because of circumstances
ensuing from deaths in the Curry
family, Dr. Tresidder turned aside
from his medical course to tem
porary assignment as assistant man
ager of Camp Curry, under Mrs.
Curry, but from 1922 to 1925, as the

1925 the Department of the Interior
caused a consolidation of all the
companies in Yosemite, and he was
made president, but still continued
his studies at the Stanford Medical
School, and in 1927 received the M.D.
degree.

ministers and crown princes, Ori
ental potentates and generals, Amer
ican leaders in science and business,
high school and college students,
artisans and workers, and has had
much experience in the operations of
government administration. Both

Dr. Tresidder lists his favorite

Marriage
A romance that started in Yosem
ite culminated June 16, 1920 in the

j SUmford Interest
"My chief interest in public serv
ice." he wrote years ago to a friend,
I "is Stanford."
Dr. Tresidder was born in Tipton.
Indiana, April 7. 1894. the son of Dr.
j and Mrs. James Treloar Tresidder.
; His father, mother and uncle all were
: practicing physicians. Dr. James
•Tresidder was born in Cornwall,
! England. On the distaff side, the
family of Dr. Sarah Emily Daum
! Tresidder were log cabin pioneer
1 homesteaders in Indiana. The father,
as a country doctor, required three
horses to meet the needs of his prac
tice. Payment for services usually
was "in kind"—hay or food produce
r labor—and seldom in cash.
The son, as a small boy, very often
•vent along, usually riding on the
.orse's back. His earliest intention
as to be a physician and this he
persisted in, overcoming many ob
>tacles before receiving the M.D. de
ree.
leaching
Teaching "all grades" in a one
room country school was the first
employment of the younger Tresid
eier, and followed his graduation from
the Tipton high school and a sum
mer course at the State Normal
School.
After a year in a pre-medical

>rnia on a vacation trip. The train
•"as held up by a wreck, and he be
; '.me acquainted with a representa
ve of David A. Curry, an educator
ho had established a summer camp
1 Yosemite. This led to a summer's
•nployment at Camp Curry, where
Stanford professor invited him to
isit the university on his way home.
Being offered board and room in
he home of Professor R. L. Green
of the department of mathematics in
i xchange for services as cook, he
iook the job and hired an Oriental
to do the cooking until he learned
how. A long chain of pre-medical
students inherited the cook's job at
the Green home, from this begin
ning.
Air Service
In 1917 he enlisted in a base hos
pital unit, but after some months of
service at Camp Fremont, Menlo
Park, transferred to the air service
of the Signal Corps as a flying cadet.
He was graduated from the school of
military aeronautics at the Univer
f>ity of California in March 1918, re
ceived a commission as second lieu
tenant after further training in Tex
as and at Scott Field, Belleville, Il
linois, and was transferred to a
bombing squadron at Ellington
Field, Houston, Texas, where the
Armistice found him.
Back at Stanford, he became an
assistant in the physiology depart
ment and later in the department of
enatomy—and for his work in anat
omy was elected to membership in
Sigma Xi, an honorary research so
ciety. In 1919 he received the A.B.
degree, and moved along to the Stan
ford Medical School where he be
came laboratory assistant to Dr. E.
C. Dickson in a research on botul
ism, a vital subject affecting the
public health and the welfare and
future of parts of the canning in

dustry.
Marriage
A romance that started in Yosem
ite culminated June 16, 1920 in the
marriage of Donald Tresidder and
Mary Curry, daughter of Mr. and
Mrs. David A. Curry, the founders
of Camp Curry. Mary Curry had
entered Stanford with the class of
1916 but had completed the under
graduate course in three years, ma
joring in English, and receiving the
A.B. degree in 1915. She was a
member of Kappa Alpha Theta so
rority, and Phi Beta Kappa and Cap
and Gown honorary societies.
She had received the M.A. degi'ee
from Stanford in 1916, had taken
graduate work in English at Co
lumbia, and had completed all re
quirements for the Ph.D. degree in
English at Yale University except
the writing of her final thesis, which
was interrupted by the engagement
and marriage.
In 1922, because of circumstances
ensuing from deaths in the Curry
family, Dr. Tresidder turned aside
from his medical course to tem
porary assignment as assistant man
ager of Camp Curry, under Mrs.
Curry, but from 1922 to 1925, as the

1925 the Department of the Interior
caused a consolidation of all the
companies in Yosemite, and he was
made president, but still continued
his studies at the Stanford Medical
School, and in 1927 received the M.D.
degree.

high school and college students,
artisans and workers, and has had
much experience in the operations of
government administration. Both
