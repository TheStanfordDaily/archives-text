### Dr. Donald B. Tresidder 
The leadership of a distinguished,
independent, gift supported univer
sity in these critical times presents
both a compelling challenge and
heavy responsibilities. The present
opportunities for significant public
service are the greatest in the world's
history. I believe implicitly in the
future of Stanford as it continues to
serve the living needs of people
through education and research, and
as it measures up fully to its re
sponsibilities.
Stanford's course from the begin
ning has been set by men of com
plete devotion to the national wel
fare, and in the comparatively brief
span of its history the University al
ready has made many rich contribu
tions in the fields of research, public
service, and private citizenship. The
eminence of its faculty and the high
quality of its students have always
been the University's strength, and
so it must ever be. One guiding
principle we may confidently affirm:
whatever is undertaken shall be
worthy of the effort and shall be
done conspicuously well.
No Time for Limited Objectives
Our country- is engaged in a war
of such magnitude that the supreme
effort of all our institutions and all
classes of our people is required to
assure us the victory. This is not the
time for calculated risks and limited
objectives. Any effort short of the
greatest we can undertake is not
enough. In this spirit Stanford has
faced the radical changes and tre
mendous adjustments which have
occurred since Pearl Harbor. And
nothing consistent with preserving
the fundamental integrity and pur
poses of an independent university
have been spared in placing Stan
ford's facilities, man power, and
scientific discoveries at the disposal
of the nation. How well the Uni
versity. her students and alumni are
serving the cause of the allied na
tions can be revealed only after
peace comes again.
Victory Lies Ahead
Ahead lies victory, and millions of
our youth will be demobilized to re
turn to civilian life. To many of
these young people, old far beyond
their years in experience of suffer
ing and in the knowledge of the
bestialities of war, a university cam
pus will seem meaningless and un
inspired. Without abating her pres
ent war effort, Stanford is seeking
to develop a post war educational
program which recognizes the spe
cial needs of these young people who
are now making such heavy sacri
fices in the interest of us all. It is an
obligation of the entire nation to do
a better educational job for the
present war generation than we did
for the last.
Today people plan, produce, and
live to destroy each other. The youth
of entire nations is being perverted
by falsehood, hatred, cruelty, and
intolerance. We must now be plan
ning for a different tomorrow. Our
statesmen at the peace table will
turn to the universities for assist
ance in identifying those proven
principles, drawn from the entire
history of man, which offer the most
promise in our effort to write a
peace that will permit nations to live
in harmony for many years to come.
Stanford is rich in resources to par
ticipate in this program.
Stanford Maintains Clear Focus
However long the struggle or se
vere the dislocations arising out of
the war, Stanford will maintain a
facus where clear, realistic thinking
is combined with a fresh, sturdy
idealism — where tolerance, respect
for the culture of other races and
true understanding of the art of liv
ing form the cornerstone of a man's
education—be he a future scientist,
technician, business man, or states
man.

objectives. Any effort short of the
greatest we can undertake is not
enough. In this spirit Stanford has
faced the radical changes and tre
mendous adjustments which have
occurred since Pearl Harbor. And
nothing consistent with preserving
the fundamental integrity and pur
poses of an independent university
have been spared in placing Stan
ford's facilities, man power, and
scientific discoveries at the disposal
of the nation. How well the Uni
versity. her students and alumni are
serving the cause of the allied na
tions can be revealed only after
peace comes again.
Victory Lies Ahead
Ahead lies victory, and millions of
our youth will be demobilized to re
turn to civilian life. To many of
these young people, old far beyond
their years in experience of suffer
ing and in the knowledge of the
bestialities of war, a university cam
pus will seem meaningless and un
inspired. Without abating her pres
ent war effort, Stanford is seeking
to develop a post war educational
program which recognizes the spe
cial needs of these young people who
are now making such heavy sacri
fices in the interest of us all. It is an
obligation of the entire nation to do
a better educational job for the
present war generation than we did
for the last.
Today people plan, produce, and
live to destroy each other. The youth
of entire nations is being perverted
by falsehood, hatred, cruelty, and
intolerance. We must now be plan
ning for a different tomorrow. Our
statesmen at the peace table will
turn to the universities for assist
ance in identifying those proven
principles, drawn from the entire
history of man, which offer the most
promise in our effort to write a
peace that will permit nations to live
in harmony for many years to come.
Stanford is rich in resources to par
ticipate in this program.
Stanford Maintains Clear Focus
However long the struggle or se
vere the dislocations arising out of
the war, Stanford will maintain a
facus where clear, realistic thinking
is combined with a fresh, sturdy
idealism — where tolerance, respect
for the culture of other races and
true understanding of the art of liv
ing form the cornerstone of a man's
education—be he a future scientist,
technician, business man, or states
man.
The leadership of a distinguished,
independent, gift supported univer
sity in these critical times presents
both a compelling challenge and
heavy responsibilities. The present
opportunities for significant public
service are the greatest in the world's
history. I believe implicitly in the
future of Stanford as it continues to
serve the living needs of people
through education and research, and
as it measures up fully to its re
sponsibilities.
Stanford's course from the begin
ning has been set by men of com
plete devotion to the national wel
fare, and in the comparatively brief
span of its history the University al
ready has made many rich contribu
tions in the fields of research, public
service, and private citizenship. The
eminence of its faculty and the high
quality of its students have always
been the University's strength, and
so it must ever be. One guiding
principle we may confidently affirm:
whatever is undertaken shall be
worthy of the effort and shall be
done conspicuously well.
No Time for Limited Objectives
Our country- is engaged in a war
of such magnitude that the supreme
effort of all our institutions and all
classes of our people is required to
assure us the victory. This is not the
time for calculated risks and limited
objectives. Any effort short of the
greatest we can undertake is not
enough. In this spirit Stanford has
