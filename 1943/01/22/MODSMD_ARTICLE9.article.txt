# Tepee Lights Fail: Lil' Indian Blows to Class
## 
### 
When his alarm pealed yester
day at the awful hour of 7:30, Li'l
Indian was overjoyed to find there
were absolutely no fights in his
tepeeâ€”no lights, no 8 o'clock. So
with a clear conscience, Li'l In
dian turned over and resumed his
snoring.
But. alas, in only 13 minutes the
lifjhts were on. Li'l Indian rolled
out, donned his parka and rain
hoots and ventured into the gale

which blew him right into the
door of his 8 o'clock.
Besides blowing Li'l Indian, the
wind was playing havoc with cam
pus trees, tossing limbs to the
ground with gusto. However,
James IWacDonahl. superintendent
ef buildings and grounds, reported
there was no serious damage. He
'd so stated that a line failure of
the Pacific Gas and Electric Com
pany caused the interruption of
power.
