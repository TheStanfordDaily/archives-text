"To the pledge class of Winter
Quarter, 1943:
"I am taking this opportunity to i
extend my heartiest congratulations j
to all you new pledges and to wish j
you the best of luck and happiness I
in yotir fraternities.
"Although there is a great deal of
uncertainty regarding the position
men students Mill take in the govern- J
meat's war-time education program, |
I am sure you will all benefit greatly
by your fraternal relationships, re
gariUess of the sacrifices the war con
ditions may necessarily demand
from your houses. You will enjoy
and profit by the associations with
your fraternities in the immediate
future, and you will carry on these
associations after the war is over, 1
even though you may enter the arm- ,
ed forces before completing your col
lege education.
"Due to the fact that the curricula
of many students are heavier than!
in normal times, this year's rushing'
season was cut from five to two and
one-half weeks in order that less;
time would be taken from studies.;
Considering that this concentration.
involved many complications, includ- !
ing the problem of handling rush'
cards from the houses to Encina and
back in one day, I believe that the
rushing season as a whole has pro
gressed satisfactorily.
"At this time 1 want to express my
appn?-ciation to the rush chairmen
of the houses for their cooperation
wits* this program and for their pa
tience and good humor regarding the
printing difficulties and delays of
the rush cards.
"For their willing help in carrying
out the rushing program, I wish to!
personally thank Shelly Parker and
Ralph Kiewit of the Interfraternity
Board of Control; Pete Gadd. Inter- ;
fraternity Rushing Chairman; Ben
Parkinson, Secretary-Treasurer of,
Interfraternity Council and Board of
Control; as well as Miss Aten and:
Miss Stevens of the ASSU office." ,
