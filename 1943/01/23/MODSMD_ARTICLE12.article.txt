# Statement:

### 
"The fraternity rushing program
has, for the most part, been conduct
ed on more sensible lines than in
past years. I have been conscious of j
more serious consideration and eval- j
nation of future living environments ;
and oiganization membership on the I
part of the occupants of Encina Hall.
It has been refreshing to observe the
j discriminating judgment of the
rushees. This is a healthy sign and
it is a challenge to all organizations
to offer something good if they ex
pect any takers. These conditions
augur well for the future of our
Stanford institutions.
"Now that choices have been made,
the new pledges must realize that
they have accepted new obligations.
Each one has a responsibility to his
new organization commensurate
with the benefits he hopes to obtain
from it.
"I wish the pledges luck, and I
hope their experiences in this new
activity will make then better Stan
ford men of whom we can all be
! proud."
