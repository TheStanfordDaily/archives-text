# NEGLECTED GIRLS
## Lovely Coeds Resume Favor as Rushing Ends 
### JOAN SECREST 
It's awfully hard to be a girl daring fraternity rushing. You feel so out
of things. You are either like the original late date with added insult in a
focussed discussion of the particulars on Joe Jones, nugget, class of '46
(currently pledged to D.K.E., but we're working on it), or you begin to sus
pect that your man thinks the no-contact periods refer to Encina and you,
too, only he doesn't take it so seriously about Encina.

Even our hashers have been liter--*
ally carried away by the excitement. |
It will be restful not to miss dinner j
because it started half an hour early..
Just a relay race with the winning j
man slinging out the dessert in a
last dutiful gesture before dashing
home to hang a pin on the frosh
who happened to wander into a j
locked closet on the third floor.
Anyway it's over, and we coeds j
are collapsed in various stages of
fatigue brought on by a reflected j
mental strain. Some of us, bubbling j
with the helpful spirit, even hashed I
for the frat club up the street one ;
night. So naturally we're interested i
in the results of our effort and I
worry.
We're laying odds on whether i
even a touch of Chanel 5 will render '
us able to scintillate tonight before
any one class of nuggets' as befits the
date of upperclassmen in the "best
house on campus."
At the same time I have been
reading the pledge lists and I'm mys
tified.
Considering that all I've talked!
about to any man for three weeks!
has been pledges and promises and i
relative merits of frosh stalwarts, 1 1
thought I could judge which were i
going to go what.
This is undoubtedly the greatest |
unpredictable game of all time.
Either that, or the Daily has listed I
some typographical error. Anyway, j
the Beta class of last week, as I saw 1
it, turns up as the Sigma Nu class, 1
the Delts are Zetes, the Zetes' are
Phi Psis, and the Phi Psis are di
vided between Sigma Chis, Theta 1
Xis, and Fijis, with a majority of
them choosing Sequoia.
Some of the houses have dug up a
lot of new names at the last minute.
I'm not sorry. Recently the times
when I've managed to get in a con- ]
versation over three words in length
with a man ... he has' pulled the
—

"dont* look now, but that third boy
from the left is one of our real nug
gets .... president of the Astoria
student body, first string tennis play
er, first string basketball player, first
string football player, and high man,
scholastically.
Impressed naturally (the ratio is
fluctuating and it doesn't hurt to
know a few men, though frosh), I
turn around slowly toward this
dream catch. Well you can usually
see he'd be high man, scholastically.
Also that he has surely been pulling
the wool over the collective eyes of
thirty super judges of character
known affectionately as "the
brothers."

Just a relay race with the winning j
man slinging out the dessert in a
last dutiful gesture before dashing
home to hang a pin on the frosh

Anyway it's over, and we coeds j
are collapsed in various stages of
fatigue brought on by a reflected j
mental strain. Some of us, bubbling j
with the helpful spirit, even hashed I
for the frat club up the street one ;
night. So naturally we're interested i
in the results of our effort and I
worry.
We're laying odds on whether i
even a touch of Chanel 5 will render '
us able to scintillate tonight before
any one class of nuggets' as befits the
date of upperclassmen in the "best

At the same time I have been

Considering that all I've talked!
about to any man for three weeks!

relative merits of frosh stalwarts, 1 1

going to go what.
This is undoubtedly the greatest |
unpredictable game of all time.

some typographical error. Anyway, j
the Beta class of last week, as I saw 1
it, turns up as the Sigma Nu class, 1
the Delts are Zetes, the Zetes' are
Phi Psis, and the Phi Psis are di
vided between Sigma Chis, Theta 1
Xis, and Fijis, with a majority of
them choosing Sequoia.
Some of the houses have dug up a
lot of new names at the last minute.
I'm not sorry. Recently the times
when I've managed to get in a con- ]
versation over three words in length
with a man ... he has' pulled the

student body, first string tennis play
er, first string basketball player, first
string football player, and high man,
scholastically.
Impressed naturally (the ratio is
fluctuating and it doesn't hurt to
know a few men, though frosh), I
turn around slowly toward this
dream catch. Well you can usually
see he'd be high man, scholastically.
Also that he has surely been pulling
the wool over the collective eyes of
thirty super judges of character
known affectionately as "the
brothers."
It's awfully hard to be a girl daring fraternity rushing. You feel so out
of things. You are either like the original late date with added insult in a
focussed discussion of the particulars on Joe Jones, nugget, class of '46
(currently pledged to D.K.E., but we're working on it), or you begin to sus
pect that your man thinks the no-contact periods refer to Encina and you,
too, only he doesn't take it so seriously about Encina.
