### HAROLD SHAFER 
Amazing what goes on over there
in the Rock come pledge time!
Those Encinamen have been doing
the darndest things and while pledge
classes were momentarily smashing
themselves to bits, rush chairmen up
on the Row were alternately tearing
their hair and phoning 3121 again.
"Howayuh, Charley, 'ol boy, ol' boy.
Saaay, uh, Charley, we sorta heard
things arent' goin' so well down
there . . . . "
'Speak Up, Boy'
"Come on, now, Charley."

"Well, you see, uh, some of th*
guys sorta got together and were
thinkin' maybe they oughta think
twice about this thing .... they
aren't so sure but what . . . . "
"I know, but just because Andy's
brother is goin' Tappa Keg is no sign
Andy .... say, Charley, can we see
you and some of the guys in about
five minutes? See ya by the Cellar."
The main fact that it was 12 mid
night didn't seem to have bothered
the boys much.
•No, No, Charley!'
"Jeez, Charley, you know you can't
give that pin back. Not when you
and Jake and Tom here are the
nuggets of this outfit. Why, you
guys are the nucleus of the whole
class—why, don't you remember that
night not so long ago when we pick
ed you up over here at the fire trap
and took you for a little ride down
by the Stadium? And after a little
while, Charley, you said you thought
you were joining the best house on
the campus . . . . "
"Yeah, but . . . . "
"What? Sure you did, Charley."
"But "
"Now, don't interrupt me, old boy.
Why, Charley, you're one of the
brothers, you can't do this to us.
Let's be rational. ..."
