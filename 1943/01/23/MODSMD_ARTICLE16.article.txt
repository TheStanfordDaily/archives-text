## Dekes, Firehouse Top Mural League 
### 
Intramural basketball is well un
derway with 17 games chalked up.
Although no team has participated
twice, certain clubs stand out as
gunning for first place.
Perhaps the winner will be the
Dekes. They have a tall club that
covers the backboard and also has a
good eye. Their first game, with
Sigma Chi 11, showed them in com
plete control from beginning to end.
Another good club is the Firehouse.
Year after year the Firehouse has
been in the top year, and this year
is no exception. The Firehouse play
ed the Breakers first and it was a
close 19-18 game. This was not be
cause the Firehouse was not in good
form, but because the Breakers are
tough competition. The Firehouse
team will go a long way, and the
Breakers showed in coming so close
to them that they will topple the
hopes of many a team.
Zetes 11, Theta Delts, and Phi Psi
fives will also be right in there at the
end. Of course it is still impossible
to predict much, for none of the
teams have been fully tested, but
from the team work and spirit of the
clubs that have played so far, the!
clubs mentioned are among the best. I
