## Farm Quintet Drops Second Conference Game to Cal, 33-32 
### ZIP WALT 
After leading: California's Bears at half time, and commanding every
department of the game, Stanford went down to its second conference de
feat last night. 33-32, at Berkeley.
This dropped Stanford into the league cellar behind Cal, which now has
one win against three losses.

Stanford opened the game with
series of excellent plays and one
handed shots, and after four minutes
had been played, had hit four field
goals to lead, 8-1.
Man Defense
California's man defense had prov
en to be no problem at all to the tall
Indians when they left the floor at
halftime, leading 18-11.
But in the second half the Bears
opened with a fast break and an ef
fective cutter play. With one minute
of the second period played, and
just after Jack Rocker netted a field
goal, Leo McCaffery went out of the
game on personal fouls. Fred Oliver
came in for McCaffery.
Tie Score
Goals by Rocker, Bob Arnold, and
Hanger's free throw tied things up at
20-20. With the score at 21-21,
Hanger tipped one in to put Cal in
the lead for the first time, but Fred
Linari's two free throws and Howie
Dallmar's goal and free shot gave
the Cards a 26-21 advantage.
With Dave Thurm playing a great
defensive game, and sparking the
Bear fast break, aided by Stanford's
ragged passing, Cal crept up, mostly
on tip rebounds or close shots inside
the free throw line. Arnold from 15
feet, Rocker's free throw, and Hang
er, made it Cal in front, 32-29.
Bears Stall
With four minutes to play, and
the Bears stalling very effectively,
John Eikelman flipped in an over
hand hook shot, and followed by
Linari's free toss, tied the game up
at 32-32. Then, while Cal was bring
ing the ball down court, Hanger drew
a free throw, which he made, and
the one point beat Stanford. For
the next two minutes California con
trolled the ball on stalling tactics.
Last night's game was' suposedly
the last, as well as the first Stanford-
Cal game for the Bear's sensational
sophomore forward, Chuck Hanger.

It is also reported that Gordon Cu
neo, reserve forward, is leaving for
the Army. Hanger is to report for
induction Monday. He made his
farewell appearance a good one,
getting four field goals and three
free throws' to lead all the scorers
with 11 points.

effort.

PORTLAND, ORE.—(UP) — Paul
Drum handled the mice he caught
carefully. Each, he said, had eaten
part of his dynamite cache.
After leading: California's Bears at half time, and commanding every
department of the game, Stanford went down to its second conference de
feat last night. 33-32, at Berkeley.
This dropped Stanford into the league cellar behind Cal, which now has
one win against three losses.

Stanford opened the game with
series of excellent plays and one
handed shots, and after four minutes
had been played, had hit four field
goals to lead, 8-1.
Man Defense
California's man defense had prov
en to be no problem at all to the tall
Indians when they left the floor at
halftime, leading 18-11.
But in the second half the Bears
opened with a fast break and an ef
fective cutter play. With one minute
of the second period played, and
just after Jack Rocker netted a field
goal, Leo McCaffery went out of the
game on personal fouls. Fred Oliver
came in for McCaffery.
Tie Score
Goals by Rocker, Bob Arnold, and
Hanger's free throw tied things up at
20-20. With the score at 21-21,
Hanger tipped one in to put Cal in
the lead for the first time, but Fred
Linari's two free throws and Howie
Dallmar's goal and free shot gave
the Cards a 26-21 advantage.
With Dave Thurm playing a great
defensive game, and sparking the
Bear fast break, aided by Stanford's
ragged passing, Cal crept up, mostly
on tip rebounds or close shots inside
the free throw line. Arnold from 15
feet, Rocker's free throw, and Hang
er, made it Cal in front, 32-29.
Bears Stall
With four minutes to play, and
the Bears stalling very effectively,
John Eikelman flipped in an over
hand hook shot, and followed by
Linari's free toss, tied the game up
at 32-32. Then, while Cal was bring
ing the ball down court, Hanger drew
a free throw, which he made, and
the one point beat Stanford. For
the next two minutes California con
trolled the ball on stalling tactics.
Last night's game was' suposedly
the last, as well as the first Stanford-
Cal game for the Bear's sensational
sophomore forward, Chuck Hanger.

It is also reported that Gordon Cu
neo, reserve forward, is leaving for
the Army. Hanger is to report for
induction Monday. He made his
farewell appearance a good one,
getting four field goals and three
free throws' to lead all the scorers
with 11 points.
