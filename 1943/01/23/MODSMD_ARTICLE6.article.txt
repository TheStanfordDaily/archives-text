# RUSHING
## War Changes Rush System 
### 
Just as everything else, Stanford's
fraternity rushing system is a con
stantly changing process, each revi
sion aiming toward a perfect rush
ing set-up, if such a thing can ever
be devised.
Adapting rushing to wartime con
ditions was the main problem this
year and a deferred, more con
densed rushing system than ever be
fore was presented to freshmen and
fraternity men. The two week pe
riod this year was the shortest in
history.
In the 1940-41 school year and all
years previous, Stanford's rushing
began early in November and three
to four periods were held before
rushing ceased, in name at least, to
make way for finals.
A IX)NG HAUL
Winter Quarter saw two or three
weeks more of rushing before it all
ended with formal pledging.
But last year, Interfraternity Pres
ident Jim Haugh proposed a de
ferred Winter Quarter rushing sys
tem which was subsequently adopted.
Autumn Quarter was considered
| detrimental because rushing was su
| perimposed upon a quarter already
[ too crowded with studies and social
[ and athletic events. And last year's
! scholarship among freshmen was
! among the highest in years.
Rushing last year tried two open
j house periods. One at the start of
rushing and the second after the
first week and a half. This year, as
the length of rushing was cut in
half, this second open house period
was abandoned.
NO PLEDGE PROM
The last two years have also seen
a change in the pledge prom.
The classes of '43 and '44 can still
remember their Prom in the Wom
en's Gym. where both floors were op
ened to the over 1,000 persons at
tending the dance. Garwood Van
and Gene Englander were the two
orchestras played in 1941.
But last year, one side of the
Womens' Gym would have had to
be resurfaced at a cost of $500 to be
used for the Prom. So open houses
at the individual fraternities re
placed the Prom for the duration.

began early in November and three
to four periods were held before
rushing ceased, in name at least, to
make way for finals.
A IX)NG HAUL
Winter Quarter saw two or three
weeks more of rushing before it all
ended with formal pledging.
But last year, Interfraternity Pres
ident Jim Haugh proposed a de
ferred Winter Quarter rushing sys
tem which was subsequently adopted.
Autumn Quarter was considered
| detrimental because rushing was su
| perimposed upon a quarter already
[ too crowded with studies and social
[ and athletic events. And last year's
! scholarship among freshmen was
! among the highest in years.
Rushing last year tried two open
j house periods. One at the start of
rushing and the second after the
first week and a half. This year, as
the length of rushing was cut in
half, this second open house period
was abandoned.
NO PLEDGE PROM
The last two years have also seen
a change in the pledge prom.
The classes of '43 and '44 can still
remember their Prom in the Wom
en's Gym. where both floors were op
ened to the over 1,000 persons at
tending the dance. Garwood Van
and Gene Englander were the two
orchestras played in 1941.
But last year, one side of the
Womens' Gym would have had to
be resurfaced at a cost of $500 to be
used for the Prom. So open houses
at the individual fraternities re
placed the Prom for the duration.
Just as everything else, Stanford's
fraternity rushing system is a con
stantly changing process, each revi
sion aiming toward a perfect rush
ing set-up, if such a thing can ever
be devised.
Adapting rushing to wartime con
ditions was the main problem this
year and a deferred, more con
densed rushing system than ever be
fore was presented to freshmen and
fraternity men. The two week pe
riod this year was the shortest in
history.
In the 1940-41 school year and all
years previous, Stanford's rushing
began early in November and three
to four periods were held before
rushing ceased, in name at least, to
make way for finals.
