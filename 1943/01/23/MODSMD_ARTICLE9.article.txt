### 
Fraternities and sororities will
join together in a special service in
Memorial Church on February 7 at
11 a.m. honoring new pledges, ac
cording to Dr. D. Elton Trueblood,
University Chaplain.
In the past the pledge service has
been the Sunday following fraternity
pledging, however, this 1 year as the
result of a decision by Margaret Wal
lace. Panhellenic president, and Lee
Peake, Interfraternity president, the
service will be held later.
Fraternities and sororities will sit
together by houses at the service.
Miss Wallace and Peake will speak,
and Dr. Trueblood will conduct the
service.
