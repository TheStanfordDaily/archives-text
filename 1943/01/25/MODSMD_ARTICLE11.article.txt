## Cards Back on Win-Trail, Beat U.S.F. 42-29 
### 
Stanford's basketball team got
back on the win trail Saturday by
beating U.S.F., 42-29, after losing to
California, 33-32, at Berkeley. Fri
day night.
The frosh had little trouble in
crushing Palo Alto High School, j
33-20, in the preliminary to the Don !
game. Paly beat the frosh hoopsters
in their first start 10 days ago, 33-27. |
The win was the second for the ;
Indian varsity in eight starts this
season, and broke a four-game los
ing streak. The only other victory
was over Santa Clara, 46-44.
Cards Take Lead
Stanford went into the lead after
Abe Rodriquez sank the first shot of
the game, putting the Dons into a J
short-lived margin. With good pass- i
ing and an air-tight defense, the
Indians worked plays at will. They j
were never in danger until one time !
in the second half when U.S.F.
pulled to within two points of the ;
lead.
Ed Voss, shooting more than he |
usually does from far out, topped
all the scorers with 13 points. Jack
Dana, Napolitano, and Asselin each
had 9 digits. Asselin made but one
field goal, but sank 7 free tosses.
Mushy Silver sparked the Dons
effort, and showed great ability
whenever he was able to shake free '
of Fred Linari's close guarding.
Hanger's Last Game
Chuck Hanger made his farewell j
game before entering the Army a |
good one, as he rolled up 11 points !
j for California, and sparked them for
their first conference victory, leav
| ing Stanford in the cellar of the
J league.
Stanford looked like a sure win-
I ner when it left the floor at halftime,
i leading the Bears, 18-11. However,
i Cal started the second period with a
| fast break, and a greatly improved
; defense. Using a cutter play, and
J taking advantage of tip-in shots, the
( Golden Bear took the lead, but
j Stanford came back to lead, 26-21.
Cal Surges Ahead
Then Cal surged ahead, and with
the count at 32-29 for Cal, John
I Eikelman flipped in an overhand
| hook shot, and followed by Linari's
; free toss, tied the game at 32-32.
With two minutes to go, Hanger
| drew a free throw, which he made.
! For the remainder of the game, Cal
! effectively froze the ball.
Hanger is to report for induction
1 today.
This Friday night, in the pavilion,
| both the varsity and frosh take on
I California, while on Saturday night,
; the Indians entertain the Naval Re-
I serve Aviation Base team here, and
â–  the frosh plays San Mateo High
| School in the preliminary.
