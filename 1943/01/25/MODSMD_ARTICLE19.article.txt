# On Rushing
## 
### 
RUSHING is over and the pledging and the
parties are through and now after some
three weeks of college we can start the serious
business of getting an education.
Tires and gasoline have been wasted by
fraternity men in their chase for new members.
And time, time that now is especially important,
has been heedlessly sacrificed.
It's all over now and, like a bad dream, let
us forget it. Little or nothing has been proven
by the past three weeks' activity. No one is
either a better man or woman because he or she
has joined a fraternity or a sorority. Many per
sons have had their self-confidence and sense of
values shaken by rushing.
Until something comes along fraternities and
sororities are our lot. But let us not be members
of fraternities or sororities alone. More impor
tant, let us be members of Stanford, and as Stan
ford men and women conduct ourselves.
