The Editor, Sir:
When each of two people with strongly op
posed points of view credits himself with being
a realist, the question pops: What is a realist?
An interesting demonstration of this ancient
situation occurred last week when one of the
self-styled realists, writing in your Campus
Opinion column, argued that it is futile for us
to devote our time to the studying of post-war
affairs, because, as he says, the political traders i
inevitably will again sell us out. The second '
realist, tagging Realist No. 1 a "quitter," an
swered that it is necessary that we begin imme

diately to educate ourselves in connection with
post-war problems for, "We've got a tremendous
power as a people, and if we learn how to use
those powers, they won't have such an easy
time pushing us around."
Well, insofar as he recognizes that serious
problems exist, Realist No. 1 is warranted in
calling himself a realist. It is apparent, however,
that there are a lot of people who believe that
his attitude of despair nullifies his right to be
called a realist—and it does in a way.
Says Malcolm Cowley of the New Republic
in condemning the following type of realism
which in some respects is represented by Real
ist No. 1:
"It is realistic to be cynical, selfish and false
to one's friends. It is realistic to believe that
others are selfish and infinitely more stupid. It
is realistic to disregard principles and have no
sympathy for other people's troubles. It is on
the other hand, unrealistic to act boldly or be
lieve in anything, even victory. They (the real
ists) are those who believe that nothing will
really change." Cowley places such men as
Laval and Simon and their cronies in this par
ticular class of realists.
Despite Realist No. l's resemblance with
the above conception of realism, wherein prob
lems are recognized but avoided, it is drastically
unfair, and moreover, unwise to call him a
"guitter" and to condemn him for the attitude
he takes.
He has not, as some may think, lost faith in
himself. He has, however, lost faith in his fel
low-men. Obviously the needs of this genera
tion have disillusioned everyone of us to a
greater or lesser degree in this respect. We not
only have seen mistakes made, but mistakes
wantonly repeated. If some of us have lost
practically all faith in our fellow-men it is a
natural occurrence, that in some cases cannot
be rectified until the individual is shown a basic
element of sincerity.
Already, our leaders trying to demonstrate
this sincerity, have told us that things are going
to be changed after this war. They have de
clared that liberal ideas and ideals will reign.
This is pleasant talk, but I ask what evidence of
their sincerity is there outside of mere talk?
Those realists who demand that we continue
to ponder peace problems are either possessed
of a strong faith I am glad to admire and hope
will be justified, or they are still content to
dream and be fooled.
For this idealistic talk has been horribly
translated by the (un) United Nations in North
Africa. Roosevelt shows little regard for our
vital poltical relations with Australia by ap
pointing a confirmed political racketeer to an
important diplomatic position.
The disolvement of extra-territorial rights in
China must not be too guickly swallowed. This
act, when placed alongside of actions, such as
the above, appears to be only a conciliatory
recognition of the fact that China will stand for
little more, particularly after the reception its
military commission received in Washington.
If there is to be any real move towards the for
mation of a free world, it is up to the people to
point out further inegualities they are not will
ing to tolerate. But action must be dictated by
an idealistic long point of view, instead of by
the necessity of momentarily guelling a rebel
lious friend.
The point is that Realist No. 1 has yet to see
any conclusive or even slight hint of evidence
that Realist No. 2's faith is worth maintaining.
Realist No. 2, instead of offering a constructive
interest in the problems to be faced, hurt them,
and probably has alienated one whom he might
admit is interested in liberal ideals, by calling
him a "guitter."
Realist No. l's letter which admittedly was
over-boistrous, should in its milder and more
essential elements be taken as a challenge—a
challenge which Realist No. 1 and all those who
have not lost faith should be glad to accept and
one which they will do their best by thought
and action so that Realist No. 1 and others who
have lost their faith, will be urged to return to
the fight.—Ray Hayes

him a "guitter."
Realist No. l's letter which admittedly was
over-boistrous, should in its milder and more
essential elements be taken as a challenge—a
challenge which Realist No. 1 and all those who
have not lost faith should be glad to accept and
one which they will do their best by thought
and action so that Realist No. 1 and others who
have lost their faith, will be urged to return to
the fight.—Ray Hayes
The Editor, Sir:
When each of two people with strongly op
posed points of view credits himself with being
a realist, the question pops: What is a realist?
An interesting demonstration of this ancient
situation occurred last week when one of the
self-styled realists, writing in your Campus
Opinion column, argued that it is futile for us
to devote our time to the studying of post-war
affairs, because, as he says, the political traders i
inevitably will again sell us out. The second '
realist, tagging Realist No. 1 a "quitter," an
swered that it is necessary that we begin imme

diately to educate ourselves in connection with
post-war problems for, "We've got a tremendous
power as a people, and if we learn how to use
those powers, they won't have such an easy
time pushing us around."
Well, insofar as he recognizes that serious
problems exist, Realist No. 1 is warranted in
calling himself a realist. It is apparent, however,
that there are a lot of people who believe that
his attitude of despair nullifies his right to be
called a realist—and it does in a way.
Says Malcolm Cowley of the New Republic
in condemning the following type of realism
which in some respects is represented by Real
ist No. 1:
"It is realistic to be cynical, selfish and false
to one's friends. It is realistic to believe that
others are selfish and infinitely more stupid. It
is realistic to disregard principles and have no
sympathy for other people's troubles. It is on
the other hand, unrealistic to act boldly or be
lieve in anything, even victory. They (the real
ists) are those who believe that nothing will
really change." Cowley places such men as
Laval and Simon and their cronies in this par
ticular class of realists.
Despite Realist No. l's resemblance with
the above conception of realism, wherein prob
lems are recognized but avoided, it is drastically
unfair, and moreover, unwise to call him a
"guitter" and to condemn him for the attitude
he takes.
He has not, as some may think, lost faith in
himself. He has, however, lost faith in his fel
low-men. Obviously the needs of this genera
tion have disillusioned everyone of us to a
greater or lesser degree in this respect. We not
only have seen mistakes made, but mistakes
wantonly repeated. If some of us have lost
practically all faith in our fellow-men it is a
natural occurrence, that in some cases cannot
be rectified until the individual is shown a basic
element of sincerity.
Already, our leaders trying to demonstrate
this sincerity, have told us that things are going
to be changed after this war. They have de
clared that liberal ideas and ideals will reign.
This is pleasant talk, but I ask what evidence of
their sincerity is there outside of mere talk?
Those realists who demand that we continue
to ponder peace problems are either possessed
of a strong faith I am glad to admire and hope
will be justified, or they are still content to
dream and be fooled.
For this idealistic talk has been horribly
translated by the (un) United Nations in North
Africa. Roosevelt shows little regard for our
vital poltical relations with Australia by ap
pointing a confirmed political racketeer to an
important diplomatic position.
The disolvement of extra-territorial rights in
China must not be too guickly swallowed. This
act, when placed alongside of actions, such as
the above, appears to be only a conciliatory
recognition of the fact that China will stand for
little more, particularly after the reception its
military commission received in Washington.
If there is to be any real move towards the for
mation of a free world, it is up to the people to
point out further inegualities they are not will
ing to tolerate. But action must be dictated by
an idealistic long point of view, instead of by
the necessity of momentarily guelling a rebel
lious friend.
The point is that Realist No. 1 has yet to see
any conclusive or even slight hint of evidence
that Realist No. 2's faith is worth maintaining.
Realist No. 2, instead of offering a constructive
interest in the problems to be faced, hurt them,
and probably has alienated one whom he might
admit is interested in liberal ideals, by calling
him a "guitter."

ing to tolerate. But action must be dictated by
an idealistic long point of view, instead of by
the necessity of momentarily guelling a rebel
lious friend.
The point is that Realist No. 1 has yet to see
any conclusive or even slight hint of evidence
that Realist No. 2's faith is worth maintaining.
Realist No. 2, instead of offering a constructive
interest in the problems to be faced, hurt them,
and probably has alienated one whom he might
admit is interested in liberal ideals, by calling
him a "guitter."
Realist No. l's letter which admittedly was
over-boistrous, should in its milder and more
essential elements be taken as a challenge—a
challenge which Realist No. 1 and all those who
have not lost faith should be glad to accept and
one which they will do their best by thought
and action so that Realist No. 1 and others who
have lost their faith, will be urged to return to
the fight.—Ray Hayes
The Editor, Sir:
When each of two people with strongly op
posed points of view credits himself with being
a realist, the question pops: What is a realist?
An interesting demonstration of this ancient
situation occurred last week when one of the
self-styled realists, writing in your Campus
Opinion column, argued that it is futile for us
to devote our time to the studying of post-war
affairs, because, as he says, the political traders i
inevitably will again sell us out. The second '
realist, tagging Realist No. 1 a "quitter," an
swered that it is necessary that we begin imme

diately to educate ourselves in connection with
post-war problems for, "We've got a tremendous
power as a people, and if we learn how to use
those powers, they won't have such an easy
time pushing us around."
Well, insofar as he recognizes that serious
problems exist, Realist No. 1 is warranted in
calling himself a realist. It is apparent, however,
that there are a lot of people who believe that
his attitude of despair nullifies his right to be
called a realist—and it does in a way.
Says Malcolm Cowley of the New Republic
in condemning the following type of realism
which in some respects is represented by Real
ist No. 1:
"It is realistic to be cynical, selfish and false
to one's friends. It is realistic to believe that
others are selfish and infinitely more stupid. It
is realistic to disregard principles and have no
sympathy for other people's troubles. It is on
the other hand, unrealistic to act boldly or be
lieve in anything, even victory. They (the real
ists) are those who believe that nothing will
really change." Cowley places such men as
Laval and Simon and their cronies in this par
ticular class of realists.
Despite Realist No. l's resemblance with
the above conception of realism, wherein prob
lems are recognized but avoided, it is drastically
unfair, and moreover, unwise to call him a
"guitter" and to condemn him for the attitude
he takes.
He has not, as some may think, lost faith in
himself. He has, however, lost faith in his fel
low-men. Obviously the needs of this genera
tion have disillusioned everyone of us to a
greater or lesser degree in this respect. We not
only have seen mistakes made, but mistakes
wantonly repeated. If some of us have lost
practically all faith in our fellow-men it is a
natural occurrence, that in some cases cannot
be rectified until the individual is shown a basic
element of sincerity.
Already, our leaders trying to demonstrate
this sincerity, have told us that things are going
to be changed after this war. They have de
clared that liberal ideas and ideals will reign.
This is pleasant talk, but I ask what evidence of
their sincerity is there outside of mere talk?
Those realists who demand that we continue
to ponder peace problems are either possessed
of a strong faith I am glad to admire and hope
will be justified, or they are still content to
dream and be fooled.
For this idealistic talk has been horribly
translated by the (un) United Nations in North
Africa. Roosevelt shows little regard for our
vital poltical relations with Australia by ap
pointing a confirmed political racketeer to an
important diplomatic position.
The disolvement of extra-territorial rights in
China must not be too guickly swallowed. This
act, when placed alongside of actions, such as
the above, appears to be only a conciliatory
recognition of the fact that China will stand for
little more, particularly after the reception its
military commission received in Washington.
If there is to be any real move towards the for
mation of a free world, it is up to the people to
point out further inegualities they are not will
ing to tolerate. But action must be dictated by
an idealistic long point of view, instead of by
the necessity of momentarily guelling a rebel
lious friend.
