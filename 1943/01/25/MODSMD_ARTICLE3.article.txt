# Education Council Informs Students
## 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following is a bulletin from the American Council
on Education which was received by Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur at the
end of last week. Its contents are so important to every Stanford man. and
at the same time, so clear, that The Daily has decided to run the first half
of it today. The second half will be run tomorrow.)

The three weeks since the release of the Army Specialized and Navy
Collegiate Training Programs have brought many developments that di
rectly affect colleges and universities—developments in Washington and
on many campuses.
Although it is impossible at this time to give all of the details such as
those involved in the selection of students and of institutions—later issues
of this Bulletin and of "War Service Opportunities" and special announce
ments of War and Navy Departments will do so—the general direction of
these developments is now evident.
Many of the questions in the minds of students and faculty regarding
the administrative details of these training programs cannot as'yet be
answered. The following statements, which have been read by representa
tives of the Army, Navy, and War Manpower Commission (WMC), indi
cate something of the careful planning which is being done on these pro
grams.
Differences in the administration of the two programs are inevitable
to meet the somewhat diversified needs of the Army and Navy. However,
representatives of the services in charge of the programs are in almost
I continual conference. Problems common to both services are being referred
to the Joint Army-Navy Personnel Board,
The following WMC Advisory Committee has been appointed by Chair
man Paul V. McNutt and has held one two-day session: Owen I). Young,
chairman, O. C. Carmichael, James B. Conant. Edmund E. Day, C. A. Dyk
stra, I*. D. Patterson, Wiley I). Rutlcdge. R. (J. Sproul, E. V'. Stanford, and
William P. Tolley.
A special joint committee of nine has been appointed as provided in the
joint statement released Dec. 12 to select (he colleges and universities to be
j used as training centers in the Army and Navy programs. This committee
is composed of three representatives each from the Army, Navy, and WMC.
In the selection of institutions and in the • assignment of the several
types of specialized training, first consideration is being given to the most
effective utilization ol laboratory and instructional facilities in the re
| spective specialized fields to meet the demands of the armed forces for
training on the collegiate level. These are instructional, not housing, pro
grams.
Institutions with adequate instructional facilities, including labora
tories, in which housing space has been leased for Army or Navy programs
of a sub-collegiate level or not utilizing such facilities may be urged to
shift existing contracts in order that their facilities for technical and pro
fessional training may be utilized to the full.
Only in a lew of the larger institutions will Army Specialized and Navy
: Collegiate Training units be placed on the same campus. It is anticipated
that the list of institutions selected will be released jointly by the War and
| Navy Departments within the next 30 days and that other details of he
j program will be announced some time thereafter.
In the meantime, college and university administrators may be assured
that the joint committee is expending every possible effort to make the
selection which will most effectively advance the war training program.
Curricula are now in process of preparation and will be announced
shortly. These have been prepared for the Army by panels of national
authorities in each held, such panels drawn from lists supplied, at the re
quest. of the War Department, by the U.S. Office of Education and the
American Council of Education through cooperation of the professional
j associations.
Panels have been requested and submitted in English, history, modern
languages, social sciences, chemistry, physics, psychology, mathematics,
j engineering, dentistry, medicine, public health, and veterinary medicine.

(Editor's Note: The following is a bulletin from the American Council
on Education which was received by Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur at the
end of last week. Its contents are so important to every Stanford man. and
at the same time, so clear, that The Daily has decided to run the first half
of it today. The second half will be run tomorrow.)

The three weeks since the release of the Army Specialized and Navy
Collegiate Training Programs have brought many developments that di
rectly affect colleges and universities—developments in Washington and
on many campuses.
Although it is impossible at this time to give all of the details such as
those involved in the selection of students and of institutions—later issues
of this Bulletin and of "War Service Opportunities" and special announce
ments of War and Navy Departments will do so—the general direction of
these developments is now evident.
Many of the questions in the minds of students and faculty regarding
the administrative details of these training programs cannot as'yet be
answered. The following statements, which have been read by representa
tives of the Army, Navy, and War Manpower Commission (WMC), indi
cate something of the careful planning which is being done on these pro
grams.
Differences in the administration of the two programs are inevitable
to meet the somewhat diversified needs of the Army and Navy. However,
representatives of the services in charge of the programs are in almost
I continual conference. Problems common to both services are being referred
to the Joint Army-Navy Personnel Board,
The following WMC Advisory Committee has been appointed by Chair
man Paul V. McNutt and has held one two-day session: Owen I). Young,
chairman, O. C. Carmichael, James B. Conant. Edmund E. Day, C. A. Dyk
stra, I*. D. Patterson, Wiley I). Rutlcdge. R. (J. Sproul, E. V'. Stanford, and
William P. Tolley.
A special joint committee of nine has been appointed as provided in the
joint statement released Dec. 12 to select (he colleges and universities to be
j used as training centers in the Army and Navy programs. This committee
is composed of three representatives each from the Army, Navy, and WMC.
In the selection of institutions and in the • assignment of the several
types of specialized training, first consideration is being given to the most
effective utilization ol laboratory and instructional facilities in the re
| spective specialized fields to meet the demands of the armed forces for
training on the collegiate level. These are instructional, not housing, pro
grams.
Institutions with adequate instructional facilities, including labora
tories, in which housing space has been leased for Army or Navy programs
of a sub-collegiate level or not utilizing such facilities may be urged to
shift existing contracts in order that their facilities for technical and pro
fessional training may be utilized to the full.
Only in a lew of the larger institutions will Army Specialized and Navy
: Collegiate Training units be placed on the same campus. It is anticipated
that the list of institutions selected will be released jointly by the War and
| Navy Departments within the next 30 days and that other details of he
j program will be announced some time thereafter.
In the meantime, college and university administrators may be assured
that the joint committee is expending every possible effort to make the
selection which will most effectively advance the war training program.
Curricula are now in process of preparation and will be announced
shortly. These have been prepared for the Army by panels of national
authorities in each held, such panels drawn from lists supplied, at the re
quest. of the War Department, by the U.S. Office of Education and the
