# Campus Opens Salvage Drive
## 
### 
Opening the salvage drive for
1943, co-chairmen Joan Penberthy
and Charles Kober sent a letter to
all campus living groups explaining
the organization of the salvage drives
for this year.
Salvage will be collected from all
residences on the campus, private as
well as student, on the third Satur
day of every month. The first col
lection will take place on Feb. 20.
The salvage has been divided into
four groups. Each group should be
put into a separate box for the col
lector to pick up. No other salvage
is wanted.
The first group is composed of
tin cans and light metals. The cans
should be washed and smashed. "If
the Coca Cola man," Miss Penberthy
said, "has been collecting the tin
cans at your residence, let him con
tinue to collect them. The tin cans
do not have to be smashed if he
collects them."
The second group is composed of
magazines, clothing, stockings, rub
ber, and rags. "If it is raining," she
said, "'please do not put the box con
taining these articles out until noon,
and then cover them with heavy
newspapers."
The third group, heavy metals,
will be collected only if the resi
dence calls the War Board and re
quests removal because a different
agency is collecting the heavy
metals.
The fourth group is grease. All
grease saved by the kitchens should
be turned in to the commissary.
