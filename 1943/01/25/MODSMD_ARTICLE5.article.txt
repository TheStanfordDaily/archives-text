# Blood Bank Raises Campus Quota

The need for the blood bank has
grown enormously, according to
Rosemary Fuller, chairman of the
campus blood bank committee.
"I was talking to the Red Cross
workers in Palo Alto Thursday,"
she said, "and they told me that
while their quota for last year was
400.000 pints, the quota for this year
is 4,000.000 pints. That just shows
how important it has become.
"The Blood Bank is called upon
to supply not only all of the armed
services, at home and abroad, but
also to supply reserves in practical
ly all cities for use in the event of
an emergency. At the recent Boston
fire, for instance," she said, '"quite a
bit of the blood was used, and be
cause it was used several people
lived who would have perished
otherwise. There is a similar re
serve in other cities, especially those
which are near the Atlantic or the
Pacific coasts.
"In keeping with this increase,
Stanford has had its quota raised
from 28 to 35 students the first and
third Thursdays of every month,"
she continued.
"I see no reason," Ed Stamm said,
"why we can't get 1,000 pints a year
from Stanford students."
To take care of this increase, Stan

ford has been given an additional
time for which students may sign
up, making a total of five periods
available, 11:20, 11:40. 1. 1:20. and
1:40.
' Last Thursday." Miss Fuller said,
"the lighting system at the Com
munity Center, where the mobile
blood bank unit works, broke down.
The mobile unit tried to wurk with

candles and flashlights, but that
didn't work very well. The students
who volunteered for the morning
periods consequently could not be
taken. They signed up, however, for
next Thursday. Those students who
had signed up for the afternoon
were taken as usual because the
lighting system had been repaired
by that time."


TWO STANFORD students are shown in the process of donating their
blood at a recent visit of the hlÂ«>od hank. One hundred and twelve stu
dents gave one pint of their blood during Autumn Quarter.
