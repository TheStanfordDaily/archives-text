### 
LONDON, Jan. 24 (U.R)â€”American
tanks bolstering the sagging French
lines in Tunisia have inflicted heavy
losses on a German column in fight
ing which may gauge the course of
the final African campaign, as

American planes have downed or
damaged 35 enemy aircraft without
a casualty themselves in fierce dog
fights over Bizerte, it was revealed
tonight.

The American tanks, cooperating
with the British First Army unit,
also reinforced by the French, threw
back an enemy attack southwest of
Pont du Salis, where the Germans
have wedged some 15 miles into the
Allied lines, official reports said.

It was becoming evident that the
Axis forces were bent on extending
the penetration to the point where
French positions in the Pichon area
to the south would become unten
able, forcing the withdrawal whicl"
might seriously delay an Allied drive
to the coast.
