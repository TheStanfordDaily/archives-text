# Farm Students Study Culinary Arts In W-91

"Have I enough water on this cau
liflower?"
"Help! It's boiling over!"
"Now. this really tastes good."
Such would be the conversation
heard if you visited "W-91 Ele
mentary Foods, M.W.F. 1-3, Labs.
T.Thu. 1-3 (Tilden)." But don't let
the fancy title fool you. What it
really means is that four girls and
one boy are having a lot of fun in
a course that, in plain language, is
the study of nutrition in food prep
aration.
The war has done many strange
things to university life, but one of
its most ironic twists is in the fact
that women are in danger of being
drafted to work in defense indus
tries, "Farm femmes" are beginning
to take an interest in those courses
which teach the "woman in the
home" what to do.
Right now future culinary artists
are learning such tricks as adding a
slice of apple peel when cooking
cauliflower, so that it will stay
white. But this is just the beginning.
Before the quarter is over they will
know what foods to substitute for
those which are becoming scarce,
and how to prepare them so as to
retain their highest nutritional
value.
They are finding out that cooking

is a scienceâ€”one that will do just as
! much to help win the war as chem
istry, if it is practiced as it should
I be, in every home in America.
