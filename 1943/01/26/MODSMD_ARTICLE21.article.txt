## Southern California Appears 'Cinch' in P.C.C. Hoop Race 
### 
Fragments of a basketball fan's
notebook as the most crucial week
for southern conference play in 1943
looms:
Southern California, riding high
on another win over the UCLA
Bruins, 69 to 49, appears a cinch for
thed ivision title. {Cither Stanford
or Cal is an outside contender if the
Uclans can find a couple of wins
over the Trojans in their bag of
tricks this weekend ... as near an
impossibility as you can find.
Stanford "can take California any
day of the week," more particularly
this coming Friday, if "the Stan
ford defense that bottled up Mushy
Silver and his gang" continues to
function, according to Everett Dean.
Especial object of praise is Freddie
Linari whose guarding kept the ef
fective Silver and crew completely
ineffective. The U. of San Francisco
squad "is one of the best teams in
the Bay Area," and the 42 to 29
victory looked like an upswing of
the as-yet-dismal Indian hoop for
tunes.
Stanford's scoring is the weak
point. Saturday night, the Indians

hit 17 baskets out of G5 tries for a
not-so-hot 25 per cent average. Most
of the misses that could have jumped
the ratio to 50 per cent were close
in tries, too. Dean emphatically as
serts "Our shooting is just average
and offtime worse, but when Stan
ford finds its eye as a whole, our
team can take any team in the cir
cuit."
Some suggested eye-finding eve
nings: Friday against Cal, Saturday
against Oakland Airbase, and the
remaining game with SC in the
Southland on Feb. 15.
