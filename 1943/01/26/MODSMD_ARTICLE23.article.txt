# Freshman Quintet Dumps Menlo J.C.
## 
### 
Stanford's mighty frosh quintet de
feated Menlo JC yesterday 31-23 in j
the Menlo gym. Sparked by the '
brilliant passing and shooting of Bill
Christiansen, the Indians were able
to sustain a spirited second-half at
tack and keep the lead throughout
the game.
The Menlo scorers were led by
Ward Bowers with 13 points. Al
though they staged a determined !
rally ip the second half and closed
the score within five points, Menlo
was never able to forge ahead.
Dick Berlin captain of the Stan
ford team, Dave Davidson, Babe
Higgins, and Bob Rowe all were
excellent.
