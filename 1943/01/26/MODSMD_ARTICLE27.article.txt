# New President
## 
### 
7V FTER searching the highways and byways
ii of scholarly attainment for the past two
years and interviewing more than a hundred
prospects, trustees of Stanford University turned
to one of the institution's own alumni to suc
ceed Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as president.
Their selection yesterday of Dr. Donald Ber
frand Tresidder, Stanford graduate of the class
of 1919, followed a precedent set 26 years ago
when Dr. Wilbur, member of the class of 1896,
was chosen for the post to succeed John Casper
Branner.
Dr. Tresidder, who will become the fourth
president since Stanford was founded more
than half a century ago, has literally "grown
up" with the University from his student days.
As a member since 1939, and for the past year
president, of the Board of Trustees, he has had
an intimate insight into its administrative af
fairs. He was the unanimous choice of the deans
of the 10 academic schools of the University as
well as of the trustees.
Although not a professional educator, Stan
ford's new leader combines a scholarly interest
in education with a keen business mind, trained
by years of experience as head of the Yosemite
Park and Curry Company, extensive operators
of the hotel and camping accommodations of
Yosemite National Park. In that capacity he
developed a wide acquaintanceship with lead
ers of both state and national affairs.
Tall and spare, like his predecessor, Dr. Tres
idder has somewhat the same Lincolnian char
acteristics of Dr. Wilbur. With them he pos
sesses also a genius for friendliness that will
be of great help to him in his new responsi
bilities.
Judging by his success as administrator of a
highly complex business organization, his long
close attachment to Stanford as an alumnus, and
his interest in young people, we believe he
fulfills quite adequately the primary qualifi
cations set by the faculty and trustees of the
University when they began their quest for a
new president.
It should be a matter of pride to faculty, ad
ministration and alumni that "a son of the Stan
ford Red" has been chosen for that high office.

president, of the Board of Trustees, he has had
an intimate insight into its administrative af
fairs. He was the unanimous choice of the deans
of the 10 academic schools of the University as
well as of the trustees.
Although not a professional educator, Stan
ford's new leader combines a scholarly interest
in education with a keen business mind, trained
by years of experience as head of the Yosemite
Park and Curry Company, extensive operators
of the hotel and camping accommodations of
Yosemite National Park. In that capacity he
developed a wide acquaintanceship with lead
ers of both state and national affairs.
Tall and spare, like his predecessor, Dr. Tres
idder has somewhat the same Lincolnian char
acteristics of Dr. Wilbur. With them he pos
sesses also a genius for friendliness that will
be of great help to him in his new responsi
bilities.
Judging by his success as administrator of a
highly complex business organization, his long
close attachment to Stanford as an alumnus, and
his interest in young people, we believe he
fulfills quite adequately the primary qualifi
cations set by the faculty and trustees of the
University when they began their quest for a
new president.
It should be a matter of pride to faculty, ad
ministration and alumni that "a son of the Stan
ford Red" has been chosen for that high office.
7V FTER searching the highways and byways
ii of scholarly attainment for the past two
years and interviewing more than a hundred
prospects, trustees of Stanford University turned
to one of the institution's own alumni to suc
ceed Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur as president.
Their selection yesterday of Dr. Donald Ber
frand Tresidder, Stanford graduate of the class
of 1919, followed a precedent set 26 years ago
when Dr. Wilbur, member of the class of 1896,
was chosen for the post to succeed John Casper
Branner.
Dr. Tresidder, who will become the fourth
president since Stanford was founded more
than half a century ago, has literally "grown
up" with the University from his student days.
As a member since 1939, and for the past year
president, of the Board of Trustees, he has had
an intimate insight into its administrative af
fairs. He was the unanimous choice of the deans
of the 10 academic schools of the University as
well as of the trustees.
