# Repay That Loan
## 
### 
American Council on Education has re-
J. leased a bulletin that The Daily is running in
its complete form. There is much in this bulletin
that applies to Stanford and to Stanford men.
If the attitude of "eat, drink, and be merry
for this is the last quarter in college" has raised
its ugly head read this statement and study

"All students when called to military duty
should take with them an official transcript."
There are plenty of privates in the Army.
What is now needed are officers and it is the
duty of colleges and universities to supply these
officers.
Since we are in college on borrowed time let
us repay with interest that loan.
