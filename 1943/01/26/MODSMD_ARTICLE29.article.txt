# OUR HASHER SEZ

Eth, the Alpha Phi cook, had an operation on
her thumb last week, but there is no need for
worry. Both Eth and the thumb are recovering
rapidly, thank you.
One of the girls behind the counter at the
Cellar went to junior high school with Peggy
Larue Satterlee at San Jose a few years back.
Our cagers' loss to California meant more to
Fred Oliver and Tom Fuller than just their sixth
loss in seven games. It meant that they must
trade off on the sink for the rest of the guarter.
Such was their agreement with their hashing
buddies.
To us hashers there is nothing so poor as a
steady diet of the sink. It cuts down on casing
appreciably.
Incidentally, we only lost that game by a
few seconds. A particle of a minute later Harpo
Linari sank a set up to make the score 34-33,
our favor, but the officials decided that the gun
went off before he started his shot.
This may not be true, but we wouldn't be at
all surprised. It seems that Phi chapter of Kappa
Alpha Theta received a telegram from a very
important alumna making it imperative that they
rush a girl named Peggy Larue Satterlee. Ob
viously the girls' subscriptions to the papers had
expired, because they frantically looked through
all their rushing lists, picture books, bawlouts,
and invitations looking for the name before one
of the hashers wised them up.
