The Editor, Sir:
This letter is for those students of Stanford
University who are enlisted in the Naval and
Marine Corps Reserves and who are interested
in receiving training in seamanship, navigation,
piloting, and naval customs prior to going on
j active duty.
A Sea Scout Ship has been organized, open
only to students in the V-7, V-l, and Marine
Candidates Class, to afford these students an
opportunity to learn elementary seamanship.
Such excellent training equipment as lifeboats,
sailboats, power boats, signaling equipment,
and breeches buoys has been placed at the
disposal of this ship.
Under the leadership of Captain Wrucke and
other experienced officers, the ship's entire
: program has been streamlined to give a basis
â–  of seamanship and a program of interest and
enjoyment to college students.
The United States Navy is also aiding the
! ship by providing personnel and motion pic
tures for purposes of training.
On Thursday, the ship is holding a meeting
in the Education Auditorium, and you, the stu
dents in the Naval or Marine Corps Reserves,
are cordially invited to attend at 7:15 p.m. At
this meeting, Lt. Comdr. H. H. Hallam, U.S.N.,
I will be present, and the United States Navy will
provide some interesting motion pictures.
Even though this is your big study quarter,
drop by the Education Auditorium and look
i into our program. We are sure you will find
it of interest because it offers to you a chance
to get the jump on the other reservists.
We believe that no other school can offer a
comparable opportunity to its students.
