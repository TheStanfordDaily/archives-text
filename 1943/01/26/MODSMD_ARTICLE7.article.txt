He then continued here as a
teaching assistant in the department
; and established the Stanford Radio |
Workshop. In this capacity he wrote
and directed scripts in which stu
dents acted, but this was unsatisfac-
I tory. for he wanted to talk himself.
Last summer he abandoned teach- ;
ing and began his announcing ca
reer at KGDM in Stockton and rap
idly progressed to station KYA in
San Francisco, where the Blue Net
' work discovered him.

As a student at Stanford, Cady
was known and liked as a big name
on the Stanford stage. He wrote and
directed the Spring Show of 1941,
and played lead roles in the more
recent productions of "She Stoops
to Conquer" and "St. Joan."
Persons here in 1940 will remem
ber the hit tune from the Gaieties he
helped with, "At the Top of the
Libe."
In the spring of 1939, just prior to
the outbreak of the present war,
Cady traveled in Belgium. Germany.
Italy. Switzerland, and France.
A period of six months as an actor
in London followed, and then Cady
returned to America, where he acted
in stock companies in New England
and worked intermittently as radio
and television actor in New York.
His wife, the former Shirley
Jones, was also well known in the
drama department here until her
' graduation in 1938.
