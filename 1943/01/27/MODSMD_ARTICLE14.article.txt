# BOOK DRIVE
## Campaign To Reach Climax On March 5 
### 
The 1943 nationwide Victory Book
Campaign got under way on Jan. 5
and will reach its climax on March
5. This drive to obtain more and
better books for 1943 has been desig
nated by the Army and Navy as the
official agency for the collection of
books to be distributed among the
nation's fighting men.
Quality Stressed
This is one campaign in which
contributors are not urged to go
over their attics and cellars with a
fine-toothed comb in an effort to
salvage cast-asides for the govern
ment. In the 1942 Victory Book
Campaign, quality and quantity
were stressed, with the emphasis on
the latter. As a result patriotic citi
zens contributed over 11,000,000
books, approximately 30 per cent of
which, after sorting for condition
and subject matter, were considered
unsuitable for distribution.
Contributions which obviously
were not suited to the taste of mem
bers of the armed forces included
such editions as The Rover Boys
Abroad, The Adventures of the
Bobbsey Twins, and books on the
Care and Feeding of Infants.
Bookstore Collects
The Stanford Bookstore is serving
as the collecting place for campus
contributions. Students are urgently
requested to donate books, above
all, worthwhile books. The final test
to make when deciding whether a
book should be contributed is to
ask yourself if you would like to
keep the book. Almost any book you
really like to keep is a good one to
give.
