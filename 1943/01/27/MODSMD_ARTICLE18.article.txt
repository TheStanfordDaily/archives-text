# Allied Airpower to Wrap Axis In Inevitable Belt of Victory
## 
### 
By going "not through, not around, but over" the supply and military
lines of the Axis, the United Nations' airpower will throw a virtual blanket
of victory over our enemies, Geoffrey Morgan, head of the Speakers'
Bureau for Douglas Aircraft, told a Tuesday Evening Series audience lastf
night in discussing "Air Power and Victory."
While so thoroughly indoctrinated with the ability of airpower that he

perhaps slighted the ability of
military forces to co-ordinate with
aircraft in producing victories, Mor
gan presented a facile recitation of
facts that left no doubt as to his
major themes.
Airpower has completely changed .
the face of warfare on land, sea, and (
air. Mass bombing—first a wave of/
planes that unfolds buildings witfi
huge explosive bombs, then a wave
that fires the shredded interiors with
incendiaries, and finally a wave that
scatters fire by more explosives—
has done the best job in history of
performing a major military 'task,
destroying the sources of supply.
"Look at what 105 planes did to
Pearl Harbor, and think of what
thousands will do to the German
cities," Morgan stated, in prophesy
ing an eventual "belt 6f bombers"—
a belt of victory between London
and Berlin.
"Land and sea mean nothing
air transport," Morgan continued
emphasizing that not only in the
actual conflict with the enemy but
in the battle of transport, airpower
is assuming dominance.
And in the battle of production,
the American aircraft industry, res
cued from labor shortage by women
workers who transformed the tra
ditional rescuing armor and white
horse into a pair of slacks, have met
their production goals, have built a
series of different types of planes
which in combination meet any en
emy challenger, plane producer or
battle pilot.
