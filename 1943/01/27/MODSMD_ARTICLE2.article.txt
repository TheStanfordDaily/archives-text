## Cotillion Gets Fredries' Band 
### 
Howard Fredries and his orches
tra, one of the most outstanding
combinations of musicians formed
on the Coast by the wartime break
up of "name" bands, will play for
Stanford's 1943 Soph Cotillion,
Chairman Bill Eberle announced last
night.
Tickets for the formal, to be held
Feb. 6 in the Pavilion, go on sale at
the ASSU office today for $2.75,
Fredries' orchestra will be accom
panied by Sonja Shaw, top vocalist
of NBC's Blue Network, who will
soon appear as a regular attraction
on Rudy Vallee's hour show.
Fredries himself is widely known
as former featured trumpet player
for Dick Jergen's orchestra. Other
members of the band are all former
members of such bands as Jergen's.
Del Courtney's, George Olson's, etc.
"We consider this to be the finest
band which we could get in consid
eration of a wartime budget and the
general policy of not hiring 'big
name' bands," Eberle stated, "and
the added attraction of Sonja Shaw
is guaranteed to please all types of
dancers."
