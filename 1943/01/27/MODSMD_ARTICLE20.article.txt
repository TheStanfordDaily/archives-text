# Lil' Injun Frog Wild; Big Lake Heap Noisy
## 
### 
Lil' Injun spent his last hunk of
wampum to get his buckskin suit
cleaned after the "heap big rain"
last week. Now he's in need of
cash for earmuffs. Fifty million
frogs have settled on Lake Lagu
nita and the noise is enough to
make Injuns roll over in their
bedrolls. Lil' Injun's going to
â€¢anoe down to Mose for a sound
roof tepee or sell frog legs for
more wampum.
