# CHINA LETTER
## Calif. Doctor Tells of Prices In Chinese City 
### 
American cigarettes cost $2O for
a pack of 20! This is just one of the
unreasonable prices in China today.
A most interesting letter has recent
ly come to your reporter's hands, by
the underground route, from a Cali
fornia dentist practicing in Shanghai
on Dec. 8, 1941. The letter was writ
ten in Shanghai about two months
ago.
In his letter the writer describes
the scuttling of the British gunboat
"Petrel" in the harbor, the confusion
in the city, the attempts of foreigners
to evacuate danger areas, and the
tremendous amount of thievery of
the foreigners' furnishings and per
sonal effects. The writer satirically
suggests, "We had no reason to be
lieve that the Japanese had anything
to do with the stealing."
This dentist is allowed to practice
his profession but must live in his
office on the ninth floor of a large
building on the Bund. The place is
| permitted no heat and no hot water.
" He and others keep, warm by cover
ing themselves with additional pad
ded Chinese robes as the tempera
ture goes down, and it does get cold
in Shanghai. He describes bathing
in a wash bowl with cold water,
but finds it rather difficult to stretch
out very much in such a bathing re
ceptacle. To say they are living in
"reasonable comfort" is a gross ex
aggeration. He averages about two
hours of work in the morning and
none in the afternoon. Entrance to
the building is gained only through
a back alley, the front doors having
been sealed since Dec. 8, 1941.
Prices are - fantastic! American
cigarettes cost $2O for a pack of 20;
a pack of matches brings $1; a wool
en suit can be purchased for from
$2,500 to $3,000; shirts s2oo;' beef
costs $1 a pound; eggs are $1 each;
Scotch and whiskey is $250 a bottle
and a shoxd beer $lO. Handkerchiefs
cost $325 a dozen and fewer of them
are 'lost' in the laundry if one has
them initialed at $l5. Inferior safety
razor blades costing a dime here cost
$lO there.
The letter states that foreigners
have been fairly well treated by the
Japanese. They are allowed to come
end go as they please and passes
have to be shown only in the sub
urban areas. They have not been
"pushed around." Most of the for
eigners use bicycles as a means of
transportation, the prices of which
have jumped from $l5 to $1,500. The
writer states that they continue to
have some pleasures and diversions,
and although they are not abused,
the feeling of isolation is the worst
part of their situation. They are able
to receive certain short wave broad
casts from San Francisco but accept
these broadcasts "with a grain of
salt."
Reading such letters from our
countrymen who have been caught
in the oriental jam should help us to
place a better value on the "way of
life" and the "things of life" that
we enjoy here.
