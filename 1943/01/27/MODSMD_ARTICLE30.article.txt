# Arrau Exceptional With Symphony
## 
### 
Scarcely less than phenomenal
was Claudio Arrau's playing of the
Schumann A minor Concerto with
the San Francisco Symphony Sat
urday. In technical command he is
in the class of Horowitz and Rubin
stein; and for a finely subdued style
I can, offhand, think only of Casa
desus who plays so well so unos
tentatiously.
Aside from Chavez' "Indian Sym
phony," which is of course of the
best of barbarous-based composi
tion, discussion yet rages over Wil
liam Schumann's Third Symphony,
which, frustration in counterpoint,
has at least got vitality; and one of

the orchestra's violinists said after
ward that it is by far exhibitive of
more workmanship than any other
U.S. symphony.â€”Covey
