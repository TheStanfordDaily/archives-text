body. Recently he showed this spirit
to Mrs. I. 11. Linder, one of Stan

Dr. Willis calls for his mail at the
General Delivery window. During
the cold spell of a week ago he re
alized, when getting his mail, that
the postmaster must be in a terrific
ciraft because of the size of the open
window. Without asking any ques
tions. he took it upon himself to cut
cut a piece of plywood to fit in the
opening, which still enabled Mrs.
Linder to handle the mail. Here,
then, is a practical way to avoid the
draft!
