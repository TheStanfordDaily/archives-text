Men in the Enlisted Reserve Corps of the Army will be called to active
duty at the end of Winter Quarter, according to information received from
the War Department by Major General Joyce.
General Joyce in a letter to Dr. Karl Cowdery, Armed Services Repre

and pre-medieal students, including
dental and veterinary students, ap
proved engineering course students
who are classified as sophomores,
juniors, or seniors and members of
the R.O.T.C. in their second year of
advanced training, and the Air Force
Enlisted Reserves.
Those presently exempt are liable
to call at the end of the term or col
lege year, depending upon their par
ticular status.
Under the exemption plan as an
nounced by the War Department,
out of 550 men in the Enlisted Re
serve Corps, 342 will be called after
the close of Winter Quarter, leaving
28 to continue in the University in
their respective classifications.
Several conflicting reports have
been made in the last week as to
when the reserves would be called
and what exemptions would be
made. Additional information will
be aavilable shortly when more de
tailed instructions are received from
Major General Joyce.
