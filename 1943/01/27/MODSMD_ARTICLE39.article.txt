# MURPHY
## Farm Man's Father Held By Japanese 
### 
Bob Murphy, junior engineering
student, received a telegram from
the War Department the other day.
Such missives are usually har
bingers of gloom and it was with
trembling fingers that "Murph"
opened the envelope.
His roommate watched him cur
iously as he read the message. Then
there was a fervent "Thank God"
Behind this little drama there's
quite a story. You see, "Murph's"
father is a colonel in the Army and
at the time of Pearl Harbor was
ser\*ng in the Philippines. Then
came the quick succession of events
culminating in the fall of Corregi
dor. In all that time Murph and his
mother, who lives in Palo Alto, man
aged to hear from the Colonel once,
and that was a cablegram just before
Manila was evacuated.
One officer who managed to escape
from Bataan told Mrs. Murphy and
Bob upon his return here that he
had seen Col. Murphy once on Ba
taan.
