lief through the International Red

who are victims of war. It builds
for the future througth relief plus
education and reconstruction.

self-help projects. Six hundred dol
lars will equip and operate for a
year one Student Center.
In Russia 640,000 students, having
been dispossessed of their universi

nish books for the devastated library
of a medical college.
In Switzerland hundreds of Polish
internees are studying in four spe
cial internee universities. In Africa
student internees in work battalions
are eager for books, musical instru
ments, and recreational equipment.
Five dollars will buy a volleyball to
serve the needs of a prison camp.
In Greece a single dollar will buy
and transport food for a student for
a week, and two dollars will supply
a tubercular student with enough
powdered milk to last a month.
Next week $1 will be expected of
every student. Lueian Rice, chair
man of the WSSF, expressed the
hope that the campus would make up
