mett it was a close, hard fought
game with the fast breaks of the
Dekes in the second half being the
deciding factor.
Sigma Chi II felled Sigma Nu I
29-18. With three players over six
feet tall, Sigma Chi, for the most
part, controlled the backboards. The
Sigma Chi II men managed to out
score the Sig Nu's because of tip-ins
made on following up their shots.
Jim Gault was high point man with
six baskets to his credit.
On the other side of fate's pendu
lum, the S.A.E. team completely
slaughtered Theta Delta Chi 11. The
well-clicking S.A.E. five led the
Uieta Delts 16-1 at the half. Going
into the third quarter it looked like
the S.A.E. quintet was going to hold
the Theta Delts to the little 1 point,
but in the last quarter Phil Lee
made three baskets. The final score
was 31 to 7, and James Cahill was
the high scorer with 10 markers.
Kappa Alpha defeated the Delts
33-20. It was a well-fought, close
game with the score staying very
even until the fourth quarter. Tom
La Coste, Kappa Alpha star, was the
highest scorer of the whole evening
with a grand total of 15 points.
The Dekes beat El Capitan last
night in a close 18-16 victory. At the
half time the score was 9-8 in favor
of El Capitan, and the eating club
basketballers looked the smoother
of the two fives. But for Bill Josely,
intramural football star, it would
have been an El Capitan win and
upset. Joselyn, not expecting to go
into the game because of a bad case
ol poison oak, came on the court in
the second half and steadied the ex
cited Dekes. His long passes to John
Leddy, high scorer of the game by
virtue of 10 points, and Jack Clark
resulted in the final defeat of the
El Caps.
