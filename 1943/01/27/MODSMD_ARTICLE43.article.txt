# Frosh Hoopsters Meet Cal Friday
## 
### 
Stanford's frosh hoopsters meet a
tough Cal outfit Friday night in the
second game of their annual two
game tilt. The Cal casaba outfit has
a tall, fast team and should be heavy
favorites. A man-to-man defense is
something that Woody Weir's frosh
outfit has not run up against yet.
Using the strict man-to-man with
no check against the backboards, the
Cal forwards ought to cause the
Card frosh plenty of trouble.
Although the home club has been
looking good in practice there is still
plenty of room for improvement in
the ranks. Sloppy ball handling, es
pecially by the forwards, has been
one of the weaknesses of the frosh
club. The shooting has been better,
however, as evidenced in the last
few games.
The Cal cubs are experts off the
backboard with a big 6-ft. 4-in. for
ward in the ranks. The Cards don't
possess the height of the Cal boys
but they are faster and, as a whole,
better shots.
