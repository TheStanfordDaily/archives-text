# Powerhouse McCain Wins Bout and Defeats Champ
## 
### 
Ed McCain, packing all the power of an Oklahoma wildcat oil well,
defeated Bill Nourse, defending heavyweight championship of last year's
All-University Tournament, in a close bout yesterday afternoon before
a large crowd in the boxing gallery.
All matches in the first day of elimination bouts for the All-University

and Novice Boxing Tournament,
be held under the auspices of the j
Circle S Society on Feb. 4, held the |
interest of the audience at all times,
with most bouts very close.
McCain showed great promise as
he had the former champ swinging
at times, while he countered with
lefts to the head and rights to the
body. Nourse, a game man at all
times, apparently was lacking in
timing, with many of his punches
short of the mark, or carrying little j
weight.
McCain finished fast, and had
blood running from the champ's I
nose. Both boys are built solid and
stocky, and showed a fine knowledge
of the sport.
Bob Dean fights Bill" Harwood on
Thursday afternoon in the other
All-U heavyweight semifinal.
Boxing coaches Harry Maloney
and Vic Lindskog asked all men
signed up for the tournament to be
in the boxing gallery and ready to
go with the run-ofl bouts.
In the Novice division, Ferris j
Boothe looked good in whipping Bob
Vallier. Boothe had the edge from
the opening gong, and had his op- |
ponent on the go throughout in
their senior welterweight quarter
final.
Ross Dana won a close decision
from George Good in the 166-1715-
Ib. class. Good had the edge in the I
second round when he had Dana's
swings going wild and missing their I
mark. Dana, with the first round j
to his credit, came back in the third '
to gain enough points to take the
match.
In th e156-IGS-lb. division, Jack j
Reynolds, a late-comer to boxing ;
circles, outpointed Charles Clark in [
a very fast match. Reynolds forced
the fighting throughout with a bar
rage of lefts and rights to the body,
that at one time had his opponent I
groggy.
Listed for tomorrow's elimination
bouts are: Novice 156-165-lb., Bud
Ackerman-Thomas Leo; Tom Hi I -
leary - William Ilonegger; Perry I
Holmes - Elia Long; Bill Barton-
