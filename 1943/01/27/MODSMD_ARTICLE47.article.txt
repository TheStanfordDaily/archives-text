Club is planning another indoor
track meet this year on Friday,
March 12, at 8 p.m.
Invitations have been mailed to
the leading track coaches of the
state and also those in charge of
military activities at the various
United States service centers. While
the war makes it impossible to fore
tell with any degree of certainty
which athletes will be able to com
pete, track enthusiasts are assured
by the Winged "O" that the best
available material of California will
be in attendance. Until the list of
available athletes is complete it will
not be possible to set the program
of events for this year's meet.
Realizing that like so many other
sports, track is bound to be affected
by the present condition, Mr. Wil

Olympic Club, feels keenly that all
should make every effort to keep it
before the public. He feels that if
the interest is maintained during
the emergency the sport will revive
