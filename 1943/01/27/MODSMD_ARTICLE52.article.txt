# GIFT RECEIVED
## Crew Gets New Shell; Bruins Want to Race 
### Bill Rose 
The Stanford crew has a new shell. The boat is a gift of Mr. William
Lenhart of San Francisco and is now in storage at Lake Merced. It will be
brought down to the Farm as soon as possible.
According to Carl Pedersen, crew mentor, Mr. Lenhart had intended the
shell as a gift lor U.S.F., but the Dons took no action on forming a crew, so

boat has been lying idle. Mr.
, Lenhart recently watched the Stan-
I ford oarsmen practicing and was so
1 impressed with their work that he
wrote Pedersen offering him the
shell.
Coach Pedersen has a special sen
j timental attachment for the new
I boat as it is one in which he rowed
| several years ago when it was part
; of the Cal crew equipment. "It is a
fine shell and will probably be, next
to the one we got from Washington,
j the best we have," he said.
Four Shells
Mr. Lenhart's gift will bring the
| crew shell complement to four. This
will make it possible to have all the
oarsmen rowing every day with one
boat free for repairs. Cleaning and
| varnishing of the other shells is still
' in progress.
Pedersen is still without a coach's
launch, but it is hoped that one will
be obtained in the near future. Any
; one who knows the whereabouts of
[ an available motor boat, capable of
traveling 23 miles per hour, is asked
I to contact Pedersen or Bud Clary.
Practice
Last week's rain slowed up the
crew's activities, but by the end of
this week the men hope to be far
enough along to get going on a six
day practice schedule.
No races have been definitely
slated yet, but Pedersen has re
ceived word from UCLA asking the
oarsmen to come south. The Bruins
want to race against three shells;
but since the Stanford crew is not
divided into Varsity, Jayvee, and
I Frosh groups, it is expected that
[ some other arrangement will be
made to permit a race with the
! Uclans.

traveling 23 miles per hour, is asked
I to contact Pedersen or Bud Clary.
Practice
Last week's rain slowed up the
crew's activities, but by the end of
this week the men hope to be far
enough along to get going on a six
day practice schedule.
No races have been definitely
slated yet, but Pedersen has re
ceived word from UCLA asking the
oarsmen to come south. The Bruins
want to race against three shells;
but since the Stanford crew is not
divided into Varsity, Jayvee, and
I Frosh groups, it is expected that
[ some other arrangement will be
made to permit a race with the
! Uclans.
The Stanford crew has a new shell. The boat is a gift of Mr. William
Lenhart of San Francisco and is now in storage at Lake Merced. It will be
brought down to the Farm as soon as possible.
According to Carl Pedersen, crew mentor, Mr. Lenhart had intended the
shell as a gift lor U.S.F., but the Dons took no action on forming a crew, so

boat has been lying idle. Mr.
, Lenhart recently watched the Stan-
I ford oarsmen practicing and was so
1 impressed with their work that he
wrote Pedersen offering him the
shell.
Coach Pedersen has a special sen
j timental attachment for the new
I boat as it is one in which he rowed
| several years ago when it was part
; of the Cal crew equipment. "It is a
fine shell and will probably be, next
to the one we got from Washington,
j the best we have," he said.
Four Shells
Mr. Lenhart's gift will bring the
| crew shell complement to four. This
will make it possible to have all the
oarsmen rowing every day with one
boat free for repairs. Cleaning and
| varnishing of the other shells is still
' in progress.
Pedersen is still without a coach's
launch, but it is hoped that one will
be obtained in the near future. Any
; one who knows the whereabouts of
[ an available motor boat, capable of
traveling 23 miles per hour, is asked
I to contact Pedersen or Bud Clary.
