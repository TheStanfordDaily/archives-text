# Enlist Today

UNCLE SAM may want you soon, but The
Daily wants you now. If you ate 1A in
enthusiasm, skill and ability, and have enough
fingers to manipulate a pencil and typewriter,
you are eligible for active duty on the Daily
staff.
For fellows who expect to enter the service,
The Daily provides speeded-up experience in
journalism that will assure their speedy promo
tion to private first class in charge of the camp
paper. And the women can bolster their morale,
falling with the ratio, by a few nights at the
Daily Shack, where the telephone rings all the
time.
As it says in the story on the front page, a
meeting this afternoon at 5 o'clock in Room 8
of the Press Building will open a two-week try
out period. This is a sort of Daily Pre-Write
training during which tryoutees hear pro
found lectures from the old experts, actually
work on the desk themselves, and emerge
knowing more than the experts.
After successful completion of the short try
out period, tryoutees will become reporters and
copyreaders with their names in the masthead,
added responsibilities on their shoulders, and
plenty of practical experience and pleasure
ahead of them.â€”Peggy Boothe
