# Share a Booth

AN advertisement by the Stanford Union in
Monday's Daily urged the campus in a
clever little poem to drop into the Cellar for
cokes and meals at practically any other hour
but between 12 and 1 p.m.
In addition to the fact that the hashers are
crowded during this time, the Cellar itself is
crowded beyond seating capacity. And to make
it worse the booths, meant to hold five and six,
are taken by parties of two and three.
It's a small problem, and seemingly inconse
quential, but it will continue during the war
while there is gas rationing and closed days for
Paly restaurants. The obvious thing for us to do
is to double up and share the booths with other
parties, and to make it a point to stop in the
Cellar, if it's necessary, at some other time
than 12 to 1 p.m. â€”Newton Wise.
