# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
There is a guy who walks around the campus
singing "Take That Night Train to Memphis"
at the top of his voice. Because the average run

of guys don't do that, the average run of guys
think the boy is strange, to put it in one word
of seven letters. This fellow is going into the
Army in a few weeks, which is something the
average run of guys have done or are going to
do soon, so that makes him an average run of
guy.
However, the first average run of guys is right
and the second is wrong because this guy
thinks, and that does make him strange, at least
around here. Every now and then he writes a
campus opinion letter to The Daily that is in
telligent and has something to say. In fact Mon
day morning he had so much to say that he
crowded Our Hasher right off the page, but
then that just makes him that much more in
telligent.

Only by happenstance did a couple whose
names the police did not secure, drive to the
isolated end of Bay road, where they heard
the boys shout tor help.—Examiner
Happenstance rears its ugly head.
