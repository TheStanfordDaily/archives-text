The Editor, Sir:
Most of the campus population only write let
ters to your exalted personage when they have
a "gripe" of some sort; for example, oh the pity
that so many campus queens were relegated to
4F in the recent sorority rushing, or the fact that
the coffee at the Cellar is definitely on the
un-sharp side.
We, too, have a gripe, editor, sir. We do not
think the negroes who live under the Stars and
Stripes have any surplus in the breaks depart
ment. In fact, we are violently opposed to ra
cial discrimination in any shape, size, or sub
stance.
However, this is not the subject of our trea
tise. Our letter is more concerned with a lighter
vein. We would like to tell you about a song,
which we think is the best of the current war
ditties. It is called "Marching through Berlin,"
and if you have not heard it as yet, you will,
providing said song gets proper plugging.
It is especially well done on a record by chan
teuse Ethel Merman. Miss Merman was never
a success in Hollywood because her physiog
nomy leaves much to be desired. There is
nothing very amazing about Miss Merman's
voice either; in fact, another throaty individual,
Gertrude Neissen, can vocalize rings around
her. However, Miss Merman has a certain in
imitable way of putting a song over, which she
does very excellently with "Marching through
Berlin."
That's all, editor," sir. No gripes.
