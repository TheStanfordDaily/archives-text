The Editor, Sir:
We see in the editorial columns of the Hono
lulu Advertiser that Territorial students there
are buying War Bonds in great numbers. We
see, in fact, that the students and faculty of
McKinley High School have set a War Bond
buying goal of $100,000 for the school year
(approximately three Stanford quarters). From
all that this reader can ascertain, McKinley has
an enrollment about the same as Stanford's.
Reports in the Advertiser state that the 850 stu
dents in the senior class have already bought
over $22,000 worth alone, at the rate of over $26
each student. This is a remarkable record.
Of course, we must realize that these stu
dents have already seen, the war at first hand.
It would seem, from Stanford's past bond rec
ord, that the Stanford students and faculty will
have to see the war at first hand also to equal
McKinley's record. This shouldn't have to be
the case.
I have been informed that the McKinley stu
dent body has a high percentage of Japanese
students.
