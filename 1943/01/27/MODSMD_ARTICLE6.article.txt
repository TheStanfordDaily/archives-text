## War Department Announces Date of Reserve Induction 
### 
(Editor's Note: The following is the third part of the bulletin from
the American Council on Education which was received by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur at the end of last week. The remainder will appear
tomorrow.)
2. The following interpretation of the date of call for men in the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps was released Dec. 17. Emergency Supplement No. 5.
By Jan. 1, 1943. the War Department will have completed its prep
arations to call to active duty enlisted reserve corps students cov
ered by Section g(7) of the Army plan. These students will there
after begin to receive orders to report for active duty at designated
times and places. No orders will be given to report on a date prior
to two weeks after the completion of the student's first academic
quarter, term, or semester terminating after I)ec. 31, 1942.
By this interpretation, a member of the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps
enrolled in a college or university in which the current quarter, term, or
semester ended prior to Dec. ill can return and is assured that he can com
plete the next quarter, term, or semester.
However, if he is enrolled in a college or university in which the cur
rent quarter, term, or semester ended after Jan. 1. 1943 the student may
expect to be cailed to active duty some time later than two weeks after the
close of the semester.
3. A letter received by the Council from Mr. Dorr. Special Assistant
to the Secretary of War under date of Dec. 17 states, "The following change
was made in the Army Plan on Dec. 16: the words, 'the U.S. Office of
Education and' should be inserted before the words "the American Council
cn Education' in each of the four places in which it appears in the statement
of the plan."
A conference was held on Dec. 31 of representatives of the Army,
Navy, V/MC, Office of Education, and American Council and effective plans
developed for such informal cooperation as seems desirable.
Oik: interpretation of terms in the Army Specialized Training Program
is trf vital importance: the definition of the phrase approved technical en
gineering courses (Dec. 12 release, p 6, 1-28). As this program is developing
it is cle ,r that these are technical and engineering courses.
They include all of the technical fields listed in Selective Service Oc
cupational Bulletin No. 10 (Amended Dec. 14. 1942) enclosed so that there
will be no discrimination between students who enlisted in the Army En
listed Reserve Corps and those who chose to remain under the jurisdiction
of Selective Service.
Responsibility for the Navy program is in a special branch of the
training Division, Bureau of Naval Personnel. Admiral Randall Jacobs
is Chief of the Bureau; Capt. B. L. Canaga is Director of the Training Di
vision. The administrative officer in charge of the Standards and Curricu
lum Section is Lt. Comdr. Alvin Eurich. These work in close cooperation
with Dr. Joseph W. Barker, Dean of Columbia University, School of En
gineering, Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy.
Commander Eurich has been for five years professor of education of
Stanford University and specialist in higher education. Prior to this for 11
years he was in charge of a research program on collegiate problems at
the University of Minnesota where he also served as Assistant to the Presi
dent. Just before coming to Washington he was Executive Secretary of
the Ninth Service Command, Commission on College and University War
Problems.
In response to inquiries initiated by the Council by letter on Dec. 23,
Admiral Jacobs replied on Dec. 29 that:
"In reply to the questions which you raise, careful study is now
being made to determine the date at which V-l, V-5, and V-7
reservists will be called to active duty. Official statements of this
will be made at the earliest possible moment as it is fully realized
that the answer to this question is of far reaching importance.
The matter of determining a means by which students of Se
lective Service age may enter the Navy College Program is also
being given careful study. Your comment relative to the fact that
many students do not enlist because they were told to wait until
the recruiting boards visited their campuses is extremely pertinent
to this question. On this matter, likewise, it is to be hoped that an
early crystalization of policy may be achieved. As soon as this has
been done, you will be promptly notified."
The importance of the Army and Navy Training Programs has very
naturally centered attention primarily upon this aspect of the possible
service of higher education. There are other types of service that must be
continued and still further developed if college and university facilities
are to be utilized most effectively in the total war program.
1. There should continue to be a large entering class of men below
selective service age. The size of this group will be influenced by several
factors and subject to changes in the war picture.
Certain of these are within the control of the institution including:
several institutions are cooperating with secondary schools especially in
adjacent areas for the admission of carefully selected high school students
prior to their graduation; careful planning of the curricula for male stu
dents who will have not more than two years and in many instances only
one year in college prior to their military service.
There is wide divergency on the part of college facilities as to what
courses this period should include—some believe it should be highly spe
cialized pre-induction education, others that it should be general.
There is almost complete unanimity of Army and Navy as to the nature
of the pre-induction education—that it should develop a command of
English: provide an historical background of the war; give a basic ele
mentary foundation in mathematics; assure physical stamina, and develop
a keenness of mind and judgment.
For some, languages and the physical sciences will be an asset. The
armed forces will continue to provide the technical and specialists training
required for combat duty.
2. The number of men classified as IV-F (physically disqualified for
military duty) will probably gradually decrease but the number classified
as 11-A or 11-B (occupational deferment) will probably increase. Basic
technical and professional training for these men will continue to be
essential.
Every effort should be made to eliminate any invidious comparisons
between those students in civilian clothes but preparing for war service and
the trainees in uniform preparing for combat duty.
3. Women students will be of vital importance in training for the total
war program.
4. Men in the Advanced ROTC, the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7, and the Air Corps, Coast Guard, and Marine
Corps subject to call to active duty but permitted to continue in the same
institution for the current academic year, will continue to require the same
high type of academic training as in the past.

3. Women students will be of vital importance in training for the total
war program.
4. Men in the Advanced ROTC, the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7, and the Air Corps, Coast Guard, and Marine
Corps subject to call to active duty but permitted to continue in the same
institution for the current academic year, will continue to require the same
high type of academic training as in the past.
(To lie continued tomorrow)
(Editor's Note: The following is the third part of the bulletin from
the American Council on Education which was received by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur at the end of last week. The remainder will appear

2. The following interpretation of the date of call for men in the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps was released Dec. 17. Emergency Supplement No. 5.
By Jan. 1, 1943. the War Department will have completed its prep
arations to call to active duty enlisted reserve corps students cov
ered by Section g(7) of the Army plan. These students will there
after begin to receive orders to report for active duty at designated
times and places. No orders will be given to report on a date prior
to two weeks after the completion of the student's first academic
quarter, term, or semester terminating after I)ec. 31, 1942.
By this interpretation, a member of the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps
enrolled in a college or university in which the current quarter, term, or
semester ended prior to Dec. ill can return and is assured that he can com
plete the next quarter, term, or semester.
However, if he is enrolled in a college or university in which the cur
rent quarter, term, or semester ended after Jan. 1. 1943 the student may
expect to be cailed to active duty some time later than two weeks after the
close of the semester.
3. A letter received by the Council from Mr. Dorr. Special Assistant
to the Secretary of War under date of Dec. 17 states, "The following change
was made in the Army Plan on Dec. 16: the words, 'the U.S. Office of
Education and' should be inserted before the words "the American Council
cn Education' in each of the four places in which it appears in the statement
of the plan."
A conference was held on Dec. 31 of representatives of the Army,
Navy, V/MC, Office of Education, and American Council and effective plans
developed for such informal cooperation as seems desirable.
Oik: interpretation of terms in the Army Specialized Training Program
is trf vital importance: the definition of the phrase approved technical en
gineering courses (Dec. 12 release, p 6, 1-28). As this program is developing
it is cle ,r that these are technical and engineering courses.
They include all of the technical fields listed in Selective Service Oc
cupational Bulletin No. 10 (Amended Dec. 14. 1942) enclosed so that there
will be no discrimination between students who enlisted in the Army En
listed Reserve Corps and those who chose to remain under the jurisdiction
of Selective Service.
Responsibility for the Navy program is in a special branch of the
training Division, Bureau of Naval Personnel. Admiral Randall Jacobs
is Chief of the Bureau; Capt. B. L. Canaga is Director of the Training Di
vision. The administrative officer in charge of the Standards and Curricu
lum Section is Lt. Comdr. Alvin Eurich. These work in close cooperation
with Dr. Joseph W. Barker, Dean of Columbia University, School of En
gineering, Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy.
Commander Eurich has been for five years professor of education of
Stanford University and specialist in higher education. Prior to this for 11
years he was in charge of a research program on collegiate problems at
the University of Minnesota where he also served as Assistant to the Presi
dent. Just before coming to Washington he was Executive Secretary of
the Ninth Service Command, Commission on College and University War
Problems.
In response to inquiries initiated by the Council by letter on Dec. 23,
Admiral Jacobs replied on Dec. 29 that:
"In reply to the questions which you raise, careful study is now
being made to determine the date at which V-l, V-5, and V-7
reservists will be called to active duty. Official statements of this
will be made at the earliest possible moment as it is fully realized
that the answer to this question is of far reaching importance.
The matter of determining a means by which students of Se
lective Service age may enter the Navy College Program is also
being given careful study. Your comment relative to the fact that
many students do not enlist because they were told to wait until
the recruiting boards visited their campuses is extremely pertinent
to this question. On this matter, likewise, it is to be hoped that an
early crystalization of policy may be achieved. As soon as this has
been done, you will be promptly notified."
The importance of the Army and Navy Training Programs has very
naturally centered attention primarily upon this aspect of the possible
service of higher education. There are other types of service that must be
continued and still further developed if college and university facilities
are to be utilized most effectively in the total war program.
1. There should continue to be a large entering class of men below
selective service age. The size of this group will be influenced by several
factors and subject to changes in the war picture.
Certain of these are within the control of the institution including:
several institutions are cooperating with secondary schools especially in
adjacent areas for the admission of carefully selected high school students
prior to their graduation; careful planning of the curricula for male stu
dents who will have not more than two years and in many instances only
one year in college prior to their military service.
There is wide divergency on the part of college facilities as to what
courses this period should include—some believe it should be highly spe
cialized pre-induction education, others that it should be general.
There is almost complete unanimity of Army and Navy as to the nature
of the pre-induction education—that it should develop a command of
English: provide an historical background of the war; give a basic ele
mentary foundation in mathematics; assure physical stamina, and develop
a keenness of mind and judgment.
For some, languages and the physical sciences will be an asset. The
armed forces will continue to provide the technical and specialists training
required for combat duty.
2. The number of men classified as IV-F (physically disqualified for
military duty) will probably gradually decrease but the number classified
as 11-A or 11-B (occupational deferment) will probably increase. Basic
technical and professional training for these men will continue to be
essential.
Every effort should be made to eliminate any invidious comparisons
between those students in civilian clothes but preparing for war service and
the trainees in uniform preparing for combat duty.
3. Women students will be of vital importance in training for the total
war program.
4. Men in the Advanced ROTC, the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7, and the Air Corps, Coast Guard, and Marine

required for combat duty.
2. The number of men classified as IV-F (physically disqualified for
military duty) will probably gradually decrease but the number classified
as 11-A or 11-B (occupational deferment) will probably increase. Basic
technical and professional training for these men will continue to be
essential.
Every effort should be made to eliminate any invidious comparisons
between those students in civilian clothes but preparing for war service and
the trainees in uniform preparing for combat duty.
3. Women students will be of vital importance in training for the total
war program.
4. Men in the Advanced ROTC, the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7, and the Air Corps, Coast Guard, and Marine
Corps subject to call to active duty but permitted to continue in the same
institution for the current academic year, will continue to require the same
high type of academic training as in the past.
(To lie continued tomorrow)
(Editor's Note: The following is the third part of the bulletin from
the American Council on Education which was received by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur at the end of last week. The remainder will appear

2. The following interpretation of the date of call for men in the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps was released Dec. 17. Emergency Supplement No. 5.
By Jan. 1, 1943. the War Department will have completed its prep
arations to call to active duty enlisted reserve corps students cov
ered by Section g(7) of the Army plan. These students will there
after begin to receive orders to report for active duty at designated
times and places. No orders will be given to report on a date prior
to two weeks after the completion of the student's first academic
quarter, term, or semester terminating after I)ec. 31, 1942.
By this interpretation, a member of the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps
enrolled in a college or university in which the current quarter, term, or
semester ended prior to Dec. ill can return and is assured that he can com
plete the next quarter, term, or semester.
However, if he is enrolled in a college or university in which the cur
rent quarter, term, or semester ended after Jan. 1. 1943 the student may
expect to be cailed to active duty some time later than two weeks after the
close of the semester.
3. A letter received by the Council from Mr. Dorr. Special Assistant
to the Secretary of War under date of Dec. 17 states, "The following change
was made in the Army Plan on Dec. 16: the words, 'the U.S. Office of
Education and' should be inserted before the words "the American Council
cn Education' in each of the four places in which it appears in the statement
of the plan."
A conference was held on Dec. 31 of representatives of the Army,
Navy, V/MC, Office of Education, and American Council and effective plans
developed for such informal cooperation as seems desirable.
Oik: interpretation of terms in the Army Specialized Training Program
is trf vital importance: the definition of the phrase approved technical en
gineering courses (Dec. 12 release, p 6, 1-28). As this program is developing
it is cle ,r that these are technical and engineering courses.
They include all of the technical fields listed in Selective Service Oc
cupational Bulletin No. 10 (Amended Dec. 14. 1942) enclosed so that there
will be no discrimination between students who enlisted in the Army En
listed Reserve Corps and those who chose to remain under the jurisdiction
of Selective Service.
Responsibility for the Navy program is in a special branch of the
training Division, Bureau of Naval Personnel. Admiral Randall Jacobs
is Chief of the Bureau; Capt. B. L. Canaga is Director of the Training Di
vision. The administrative officer in charge of the Standards and Curricu
lum Section is Lt. Comdr. Alvin Eurich. These work in close cooperation
with Dr. Joseph W. Barker, Dean of Columbia University, School of En
gineering, Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy.
Commander Eurich has been for five years professor of education of
Stanford University and specialist in higher education. Prior to this for 11
years he was in charge of a research program on collegiate problems at
the University of Minnesota where he also served as Assistant to the Presi
dent. Just before coming to Washington he was Executive Secretary of
the Ninth Service Command, Commission on College and University War
Problems.
In response to inquiries initiated by the Council by letter on Dec. 23,
Admiral Jacobs replied on Dec. 29 that:
"In reply to the questions which you raise, careful study is now
being made to determine the date at which V-l, V-5, and V-7
reservists will be called to active duty. Official statements of this
will be made at the earliest possible moment as it is fully realized
that the answer to this question is of far reaching importance.
The matter of determining a means by which students of Se
lective Service age may enter the Navy College Program is also
being given careful study. Your comment relative to the fact that
many students do not enlist because they were told to wait until
the recruiting boards visited their campuses is extremely pertinent
to this question. On this matter, likewise, it is to be hoped that an
early crystalization of policy may be achieved. As soon as this has
been done, you will be promptly notified."
The importance of the Army and Navy Training Programs has very
naturally centered attention primarily upon this aspect of the possible
service of higher education. There are other types of service that must be
continued and still further developed if college and university facilities
are to be utilized most effectively in the total war program.
1. There should continue to be a large entering class of men below
selective service age. The size of this group will be influenced by several
factors and subject to changes in the war picture.
Certain of these are within the control of the institution including:
several institutions are cooperating with secondary schools especially in
adjacent areas for the admission of carefully selected high school students
prior to their graduation; careful planning of the curricula for male stu
dents who will have not more than two years and in many instances only
one year in college prior to their military service.
There is wide divergency on the part of college facilities as to what
courses this period should include—some believe it should be highly spe
cialized pre-induction education, others that it should be general.
There is almost complete unanimity of Army and Navy as to the nature
of the pre-induction education—that it should develop a command of
English: provide an historical background of the war; give a basic ele
mentary foundation in mathematics; assure physical stamina, and develop
a keenness of mind and judgment.
For some, languages and the physical sciences will be an asset. The
armed forces will continue to provide the technical and specialists training
required for combat duty.
2. The number of men classified as IV-F (physically disqualified for

"In reply to the questions which you raise, careful study is now
being made to determine the date at which V-l, V-5, and V-7
reservists will be called to active duty. Official statements of this
will be made at the earliest possible moment as it is fully realized
that the answer to this question is of far reaching importance.
The matter of determining a means by which students of Se
lective Service age may enter the Navy College Program is also
being given careful study. Your comment relative to the fact that
many students do not enlist because they were told to wait until
the recruiting boards visited their campuses is extremely pertinent
to this question. On this matter, likewise, it is to be hoped that an
early crystalization of policy may be achieved. As soon as this has
been done, you will be promptly notified."
The importance of the Army and Navy Training Programs has very
naturally centered attention primarily upon this aspect of the possible
service of higher education. There are other types of service that must be
continued and still further developed if college and university facilities
are to be utilized most effectively in the total war program.
1. There should continue to be a large entering class of men below
selective service age. The size of this group will be influenced by several
factors and subject to changes in the war picture.
Certain of these are within the control of the institution including:
several institutions are cooperating with secondary schools especially in
adjacent areas for the admission of carefully selected high school students
prior to their graduation; careful planning of the curricula for male stu
dents who will have not more than two years and in many instances only
one year in college prior to their military service.
There is wide divergency on the part of college facilities as to what
courses this period should include—some believe it should be highly spe
cialized pre-induction education, others that it should be general.
There is almost complete unanimity of Army and Navy as to the nature
of the pre-induction education—that it should develop a command of
English: provide an historical background of the war; give a basic ele
mentary foundation in mathematics; assure physical stamina, and develop
a keenness of mind and judgment.
For some, languages and the physical sciences will be an asset. The
armed forces will continue to provide the technical and specialists training
required for combat duty.
2. The number of men classified as IV-F (physically disqualified for
military duty) will probably gradually decrease but the number classified
as 11-A or 11-B (occupational deferment) will probably increase. Basic
technical and professional training for these men will continue to be
essential.
Every effort should be made to eliminate any invidious comparisons
between those students in civilian clothes but preparing for war service and
the trainees in uniform preparing for combat duty.
3. Women students will be of vital importance in training for the total
war program.
4. Men in the Advanced ROTC, the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps,
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7, and the Air Corps, Coast Guard, and Marine
Corps subject to call to active duty but permitted to continue in the same
institution for the current academic year, will continue to require the same
high type of academic training as in the past.

Education and' should be inserted before the words "the American Council
cn Education' in each of the four places in which it appears in the statement
of the plan."
A conference was held on Dec. 31 of representatives of the Army,
Navy, V/MC, Office of Education, and American Council and effective plans
developed for such informal cooperation as seems desirable.
Oik: interpretation of terms in the Army Specialized Training Program
is trf vital importance: the definition of the phrase approved technical en
gineering courses (Dec. 12 release, p 6, 1-28). As this program is developing
it is cle ,r that these are technical and engineering courses.
They include all of the technical fields listed in Selective Service Oc
cupational Bulletin No. 10 (Amended Dec. 14. 1942) enclosed so that there
will be no discrimination between students who enlisted in the Army En
listed Reserve Corps and those who chose to remain under the jurisdiction
of Selective Service.
Responsibility for the Navy program is in a special branch of the
training Division, Bureau of Naval Personnel. Admiral Randall Jacobs
is Chief of the Bureau; Capt. B. L. Canaga is Director of the Training Di
vision. The administrative officer in charge of the Standards and Curricu
lum Section is Lt. Comdr. Alvin Eurich. These work in close cooperation
with Dr. Joseph W. Barker, Dean of Columbia University, School of En
gineering, Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy.
Commander Eurich has been for five years professor of education of
Stanford University and specialist in higher education. Prior to this for 11
years he was in charge of a research program on collegiate problems at
the University of Minnesota where he also served as Assistant to the Presi
dent. Just before coming to Washington he was Executive Secretary of
the Ninth Service Command, Commission on College and University War
Problems.

(To lie continued tomorrow)
(Editor's Note: The following is the third part of the bulletin from
the American Council on Education which was received by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur at the end of last week. The remainder will appear
tomorrow.)
2. The following interpretation of the date of call for men in the Army
Enlisted Reserve Corps was released Dec. 17. Emergency Supplement No. 5.
By Jan. 1, 1943. the War Department will have completed its prep
arations to call to active duty enlisted reserve corps students cov
ered by Section g(7) of the Army plan. These students will there
after begin to receive orders to report for active duty at designated
times and places. No orders will be given to report on a date prior
to two weeks after the completion of the student's first academic
quarter, term, or semester terminating after I)ec. 31, 1942.
By this interpretation, a member of the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps
enrolled in a college or university in which the current quarter, term, or
semester ended prior to Dec. ill can return and is assured that he can com
plete the next quarter, term, or semester.
However, if he is enrolled in a college or university in which the cur
rent quarter, term, or semester ended after Jan. 1. 1943 the student may
expect to be cailed to active duty some time later than two weeks after the
close of the semester.
3. A letter received by the Council from Mr. Dorr. Special Assistant
to the Secretary of War under date of Dec. 17 states, "The following change
was made in the Army Plan on Dec. 16: the words, 'the U.S. Office of
Education and' should be inserted before the words "the American Council
cn Education' in each of the four places in which it appears in the statement
of the plan."
