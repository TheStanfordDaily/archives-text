year and thereby end for all time
the attempts of the Japanese to
dominate the Far East.

eliminated. He made no mention of
Italy's war making power.
Desti-oy Hate

Nations to harm the people of the

Axis countries or of the Axis-dom

members of the United Nations had
the same ideas on this subject.
Finished Work
The President said that he and

Churchill and their staffs had fin
ished their work and that the gen
eral staffs had had a meeting of
minds on all the military operations.

dent that 1943 would be a much bet
ter year than 1942.

the most successful war conference
he had ever participated in or had
ever seen.
He said he had never seen a con
ference to equal the present one
for comprehensiveness and said that
the results of the conference would
give the Allied tx*oops their best
chance of victory.

many and Japan would be totally
eliminated. He made no mention of
Italy's war making power.
Desti-oy Hate

Nations to harm the people of the

Axis countries or of the Axis-dom
inated countries. However, he said

members of the United Nations had
the same ideas on this subject.
Finished Work

Churchill and their staffs had fin
ished their work and that the gen
eral staffs had had a meeting of
minds on all the military operations.

he had ever participated in or had
ever seen.
He said he had never seen a con

resources of the Allied Nations.

participating in the discussions re
affirmed their determination to de

the Russian offensive, thereby cut
ting down German manpower as
well as wearing out German mate
iral.
All Possible Aid
The United Nations, he said, would
give all possible aid in the heroic
struggle of China now in its sixth
year and thereby end for all time
the attempts of the Japanese to
dominate the Far East.
Mr. Roosevelt said that he and
Churchill were determined that
peace should come to the world and
that the war making power of Ger
many and Japan would be totally
eliminated. He made no mention of
Italy's war making power.
Desti-oy Hate
The President said that there was
Nations to harm the people of the

Axis countries or of the Axis-dom
inated countries. However, he said
the United Nations certainly would
destroy the philosophy of hate and
fear for the subjugation of other
peoples.
He said he was confident that all
members of the United Nations had
the same ideas on this subject.
Finished Work
The President said that he and

Churchill and their staffs had fin
ished their work and that the gen
eral staffs had had a meeting of
minds on all the military operations.
The President said he was confi
dent that 1943 would be a much bet
ter year than 1942.
Correspondents
Churchill said he agreed that it
was a happy idea that the corre
spondents had been brought to Casa
blanca to meet with him and the
President for the press conference.
Churchill said the discussions were
the most successful war conference
he had ever participated in or had
ever seen.
He said he had never seen a con
ference to equal the present one
for comprehensiveness and said that
the results of the conference would
give the Allied tx*oops their best
chance of victory.
