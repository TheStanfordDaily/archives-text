# IDAHO LOSS
## Who Lost Her Purse in Boise? 
### 
Someone wandered into the Stan
j ford Bookstore on Tuesday, Nov. 10.
This person purchased something for
41 cents and tucked the rebate slip
j in her purse.
Between Nov. 10 and the first of
| this year, apparently the same per
! son wandered into the U.S. Post Of
j fice in Boise, Idaho, and walked out
j leaving behind the purse contain
! ing a "substantial amount of money,
! some articles evidently belonging to
a lady," and the bookstore slip, saved
| so carefully to come in handy when
j rebates are handed out in June.
Nowhere in the purse was there
any sort of identification. The Boise
Post Office turned the information
over to the Bookstore entirely due
to the rebate ticket, but the Book
) store, unfortunately, cannot remem
! ber who purchased 41 cents worth
j of something on Nov. 10.
There are 33 students registered in
the University from Idaho. Their
| attention is especially called toward
this orphan purse, but anyone who
can bring information to bear on the
subject is asked to contact The Daily
or to write directly to Harry L. Yost,
Postmaster, U.S. Post Office, Boise,
Idaho.
