### 
LONDON, Jan. 27 (UP).-—Ameri- j
can forces have thrown back the
Germans six to nine miles in the
Ousseltia valley and are advancing j
with their French allies through a
near-by pass, only 40 miles from the
Axis Afrika Corps' road of retreat
up the Tunisian coast, dispatches re
p< rted tonight.
A French communique from North
Africa said that American forces
were mopping up their regained
ground in the valley, which is an
important anchor of French posi
tions in the central Tunisian sector,
■where the enemy broke through
last week.
The initiative of the fighting in the
Ousseltia region passed from the
Germans to the Allies in the last
three days, dispatches from Allied
headquarters said; and the- latter are
steadily regaining the terrain lost in
the three-day Axis push down the
valley.
