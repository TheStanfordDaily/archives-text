# SERVICE SCHOOLING
## Education Council Tells Reserve Training Plans 
### 
(Continued from yesterday)
5. Men in the Training Programs and assigned to professional fields—
medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine—will continue to utilize the facili
ties of the professional schools in which they are now enrolled.
6. Contractual and other pre- and in-service training programs to
meet the needs of a particular industry will probably be developed. The
extent of this development will be largely dependent upon the location of
the institution in relation to industries and the initiative and adapability
of faculty and instructional facilities.
7. Contractual services to the armed forces other than the Army and
Navy Training Programs will continue to be important and may very
probably expand. It is earnestly urged that insofar as possible such con
tracts provide for the most effective utilization of faculty and laboratory
facilities. Hereafter all contracts must clear through the joint committee
of nine referred to above.
8. Extension services will become even more important both to the
community and to men and women in the armed forces. Provision for the
continuing of education in both the Army and Navy through correspond
ence courses has been described in previous issues of this Bulletin.
Copies of the Army Institute Catalogue have been sent to all colleges
and universities. It is again suggested that college advisors urge men and
women entering the armed forces to utilize this unprecedented facility for
continuing education while in the armed forces.
Training Programs in Formation
Two general statements may be drawn from the developments of re
cent weeks:
1. Administrative details of the Army and Navy Training Programs and
of Selective Service are still so much in the formative stage and unavoid
able delays in putting them in operation are so probable that all students
whether or not in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps or subject to Selective
Service arc urged by the Army, Navy, and the WMC to continue in college
until callcd and until definite plans are developed.
From the viewpoint of the armed forces and of industry every day a
man remains in college he is receiving the training necessary for effective
war service.
To drop out to await call is to lose invaluable time in total training.
The same applies also to new students who planned to enter the institu
tions. In the case of men in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps, it is sug
gested that they be told that the institutions will make liberal refunds to
the student (or plan for delay in payment) if called prior to time for which
credit can be granted.
Specialized Education Opportunities
2. Students leaving for the armed forces and former students now in
the services may well be urged not only to continue their education while
in the Army or Navy through applying for assignment to the Army Spe
cialized and Navy Collegiate Training Programs and through the Army
Institute, but also to take full advantage of all specialized training oppor
tunities for both enlisted personnel and officers.
They should also be assured that provision will be made for their re
adjustment to college upon the close of the war and that credit will be
given for educational values achieved while in service.
An increasing number of colleges and universities have adopted the
plan proposed by the Council in cooperation with the Army Institute.
Such assurance together with the urging of men and women to take
tul.l advantage of every educational opportunity will do much to lay a firm
foundation for the continuance of the services of colleges and universities
to a world once more at peace.

war service.
To drop out to await call is to lose invaluable time in total training.
The same applies also to new students who planned to enter the institu
tions. In the case of men in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps, it is sug
gested that they be told that the institutions will make liberal refunds to
the student (or plan for delay in payment) if called prior to time for which
credit can be granted.
Specialized Education Opportunities
2. Students leaving for the armed forces and former students now in
the services may well be urged not only to continue their education while
in the Army or Navy through applying for assignment to the Army Spe
cialized and Navy Collegiate Training Programs and through the Army
Institute, but also to take full advantage of all specialized training oppor
tunities for both enlisted personnel and officers.
They should also be assured that provision will be made for their re
adjustment to college upon the close of the war and that credit will be
given for educational values achieved while in service.
An increasing number of colleges and universities have adopted the
plan proposed by the Council in cooperation with the Army Institute.
Such assurance together with the urging of men and women to take
tul.l advantage of every educational opportunity will do much to lay a firm
foundation for the continuance of the services of colleges and universities
to a world once more at peace.
(Continued from yesterday)
5. Men in the Training Programs and assigned to professional fields—
medicine, dentistry, veterinary medicine—will continue to utilize the facili
ties of the professional schools in which they are now enrolled.
6. Contractual and other pre- and in-service training programs to
meet the needs of a particular industry will probably be developed. The
extent of this development will be largely dependent upon the location of
the institution in relation to industries and the initiative and adapability
of faculty and instructional facilities.
7. Contractual services to the armed forces other than the Army and
Navy Training Programs will continue to be important and may very
probably expand. It is earnestly urged that insofar as possible such con
tracts provide for the most effective utilization of faculty and laboratory
facilities. Hereafter all contracts must clear through the joint committee
of nine referred to above.
8. Extension services will become even more important both to the
community and to men and women in the armed forces. Provision for the
continuing of education in both the Army and Navy through correspond
ence courses has been described in previous issues of this Bulletin.
Copies of the Army Institute Catalogue have been sent to all colleges
and universities. It is again suggested that college advisors urge men and
women entering the armed forces to utilize this unprecedented facility for
continuing education while in the armed forces.
Training Programs in Formation
Two general statements may be drawn from the developments of re
cent weeks:
1. Administrative details of the Army and Navy Training Programs and
of Selective Service are still so much in the formative stage and unavoid
able delays in putting them in operation are so probable that all students
whether or not in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps or subject to Selective
Service arc urged by the Army, Navy, and the WMC to continue in college
until callcd and until definite plans are developed.
From the viewpoint of the armed forces and of industry every day a
man remains in college he is receiving the training necessary for effective
war service.
To drop out to await call is to lose invaluable time in total training.
The same applies also to new students who planned to enter the institu
tions. In the case of men in the Army Enlisted Reserve Corps, it is sug
