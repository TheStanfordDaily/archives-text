# Excom Grants Ten Dates
## 
### 
Executive Committee took a deep
breath last night, voted itself out of
$1 per member, and then went back
to the routine business of discussing
social dates, committee appointments
and the routine matters of student
government.
After a short presentation of the
program of the WSSF—World Stu
dent Service Fund—by Lucien Rice,
drive chairman, Leslie Langnecker
moved that Executive Committee
members each pledge $1 to the fund
to show their approval of the proj
ect. The motion was passed unani
mously.
"We're willing to pay our dollar
for this drive," said President Ed
Stanim. "and we hope the rest of the
campus will pledge along with us."
Previously, Excom had clarified a
decision reached last week about the
disposition of funds from Sunday
night movies. It was decided that
the gross proceeds of two Sunday
movies would be given to the In
fantile Paralysis Fund instead of
Dimes for Diplomas, the usual re
cipient.
