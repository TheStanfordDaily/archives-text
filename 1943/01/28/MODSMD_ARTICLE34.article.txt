# Needless Buying Will Provoke Rationing Declares Merchant
## 
### Lucy Thompson 
If people don't buy clothing which
[ they don't need, there will not be
j rationing of clothes, according to
' Mrs. McGinn, manager of the
| Clothes Closet.
"The government isn't thinking of
j rationing," she said. "There isn't
any scarcity of clothes. There has
! been, however, publicity on the
point rationing system used for
clothes rationing in England, and
there has been a point rationing
' system set up for canned and dried
1 food.
Don't 'Beat' the War
"What has happened," she con-
I tinued, '"is that people have been
| trying to 'beat' the war. They have
| started to think that clothes will
j be the next thing to be rationed and
j so they have started to buy things
which they do not need. If people
would not buy clothing 'which they
! do not need, there will be no ration
i ing. The merchandise has not de
creased in quality. The manufac
turers have done a marvelous job.
We have to order farther in ad
vance, but that is our job.
"As a part of our war effort." she
said, "the salesgirls here are trained

not to encourage foolish or scare
buying.
"Of course," Mrs. McGinn said,
"we are a women's organization.
We did employ one man, Dick Lucy,
but he went into the Coast Guard.
We can, however, do everything we
can for the war effort and we can
give our men.
Have Minuteman Flag
"We have the only Minuteman
flag with a Treasury T on it in Palo
Alto. (Ed. noteâ€”Roos Bros, has ap
plied for such a flag but" the T has
not as yet arrived.) This means that
we are members of the payroll de
duction plan. All of our employees
put at least 10 per cent of their
wages in war bonds and stamps. We
have been doing this for quite some
time, so about four months ago we
signed up the staff and got our flag.
We are pretty proud of it.
"Some of our workers have sons
in the service, like Mrs. Baldwin,
Mrs. Ames, and myself," she said.
"Some have brothers, like Mrs. Nash
and Mrs. Eyman. Two have sweet
hearts in the service. There are also
three husbands who have gone in,
Mr. Stinson, Mr. Bonham, and Mr.
McGinn.

"Then," she said, "two of the hus
bands are working in defense plants,
Mr. Albertson and Mr. Kogelschotz.
Incidentally, we are losing our only
grandmother, Mrs. Kogelschotz, who
will be leaving soon to work in the
shipyards with her husband.
"The only other woman we lost
went to Canada with her husband.
He went up to teach radio.
"Going back to the war work that
we do," Mrs. McGinn said, "90 per
cent of all our workers completed
first aid courses in February. Some
are regular donors at the blood bank.
About 50 per cent are rolling surgi
cal dressings for the Red Cross.
"Then we have served as hostesses
at the Navy Club and the Hospital
ity House.
Stocking Depot
"Of course," she continued, "we
serve as a depot for the collection of
stockings. This is more important
than most people realize. The stock
ings are reprocessed so that the silk
and nylon are retrieved. The nylon,
is made into parachutes while the
silk is used to make powder bags.
"We are also serving as a depot
for the collection of books which
will be sent to men in the services.
