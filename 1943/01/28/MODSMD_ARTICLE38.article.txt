## Indians to Hunt Bears Friday 
### 
When Stanford starts out for its
revenge against Cal in the Pavilion
Friday night at 8 in the second of
1943's four hoop ''Big Games," they'll
have another emotional, "let's win
just this one for good old somebody
or other" Golden Bear squad on
their hands.
This time Uncle Sam is again the
flame behind the tears of the rival.
They are shed for forward Gordon
Cuneo who follows Chuck Hanger
in the way of all wartime flesh to the
Army on Feb. 6.
You will remember that Hanger
was leaving dear old Cal for the
Army the day after the meeting
between the Cards and Bears last
Friday night. So all the boys rallied
around with fine Berkeley spirit,
and they potted a lot of shots, some
deserved and others just gifts from
some deity, and eventually they
nosed the Deanmen, 33-32, the la
mented Mr. Hanger flipping the de
ciding point.
Beat Santa Clara
The next night, with Hanger just
a memory in a uniform, the Bears
trod all over Santa Clara, 44-36,
with Cuneo filling in for the drafted
flash and making 11 points to boot.
Now "poor old Gordie" is heading
for the service, and the Cals are
likely to be hotter than assorted
foxes again come Friday this week.
Seeing that Everett Dean happily
can't round up somebody on his
squad to jerk tears for at the mo
ment, the force behind Stanford is
likely to be common, ordinary an
ger. In fact, the Cards have every
reason to feel sort of gravelled about
everything in general.
It's this way. They were confi
dently expected to be number one
outfit in these parts. First they got
dumped by St. Mary's Pre-Flight
twice, 54-43 and 5(5-39. as the first
victims of this once-hot outfit. Then
they edged Santa Clara, and popped
off eastward to meet Great Lakes
and Illinois, both of whom were not
defeated than and have not been
edged since.
Open Against SC
Back on the Farm they opened
the conference against an SC team
that could have hit the ventilator on
the top of the Hoover Libe with a
marble. That means that this team
was extremely accurate. Then they
sucumbed to the romanticism at Cal.
The Cards have few excuses. Their
shooting has been phenomenally un-
Stanford-like. But Saturday they
apparently began a recovery against
USF, 42-25.
So Friday night will either be a
victory for righteous anger or one
for overgrown sentiment.
Saturday the Cards meet Oakland
Airbase. This aggregation original
ly was supposed to contain Burness
and Cowden, just two hunks of
memory for the Stanford team. But
they were transferred, and the re
sulting combine has not figured too
prominently thus far.

When Stanford starts out for its
revenge against Cal in the Pavilion
Friday night at 8 in the second of
1943's four hoop ''Big Games," they'll
have another emotional, "let's win
just this one for good old somebody
or other" Golden Bear squad on
their hands.
This time Uncle Sam is again the
flame behind the tears of the rival.
They are shed for forward Gordon
Cuneo who follows Chuck Hanger
in the way of all wartime flesh to the
Army on Feb. 6.
You will remember that Hanger
was leaving dear old Cal for the
Army the day after the meeting
between the Cards and Bears last
Friday night. So all the boys rallied
around with fine Berkeley spirit,
and they potted a lot of shots, some
deserved and others just gifts from
some deity, and eventually they
nosed the Deanmen, 33-32, the la
mented Mr. Hanger flipping the de
ciding point.
Beat Santa Clara
The next night, with Hanger just
a memory in a uniform, the Bears
trod all over Santa Clara, 44-36,
with Cuneo filling in for the drafted
flash and making 11 points to boot.
Now "poor old Gordie" is heading
for the service, and the Cals are
likely to be hotter than assorted
foxes again come Friday this week.
Seeing that Everett Dean happily
can't round up somebody on his
squad to jerk tears for at the mo
ment, the force behind Stanford is
likely to be common, ordinary an
ger. In fact, the Cards have every
reason to feel sort of gravelled about
everything in general.
It's this way. They were confi
dently expected to be number one
outfit in these parts. First they got
dumped by St. Mary's Pre-Flight
twice, 54-43 and 5(5-39. as the first
victims of this once-hot outfit. Then
they edged Santa Clara, and popped
off eastward to meet Great Lakes
and Illinois, both of whom were not
defeated than and have not been
edged since.
Open Against SC
Back on the Farm they opened
the conference against an SC team
that could have hit the ventilator on
the top of the Hoover Libe with a
marble. That means that this team
was extremely accurate. Then they
sucumbed to the romanticism at Cal.
The Cards have few excuses. Their
shooting has been phenomenally un-
Stanford-like. But Saturday they
apparently began a recovery against
USF, 42-25.
So Friday night will either be a
victory for righteous anger or one
for overgrown sentiment.
Saturday the Cards meet Oakland
Airbase. This aggregation original
ly was supposed to contain Burness
and Cowden, just two hunks of
memory for the Stanford team. But
they were transferred, and the re
sulting combine has not figured too
prominently thus far.
