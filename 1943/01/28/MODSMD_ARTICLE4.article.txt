## Excom to Give Funds to Drive 
### 
Excom voted last night to contri
; bute Sl7 to the WSSF drive be
i ginning next Monday. The aim of
the drive is to send $2,000 to the
World Student Service Fund for
| benefit of young men and women on
a parallel with Stanford students
j who have become the victims of war.
In Russia, China, and Greece, all
over the world, students are study -
I ing behind the lines, in refugee and
! interne camps. They have lost
i their campuses; their libraries have
been devastated. They lack food,
clothing, and medical supplies.
Next week even.- student at Stan
| ford, still equipped with campus, li
-1 brary, and faculty, will be asked to
contribute a dollar to the drive.
The WSSF is unduplicated by any
other agency, and the funds are ad
ministered directly through the In
ternational Red Cross to the stu
i dents who are in the greatest need.
Campus speakers will go around
,to the living groups tonight to
j explain in greater detail the work
; of the WSSF and to lead up to the
; drive which will begin on Monday.
"I expect to reach our goal of
$2,000 and then to exceed it," said
J Lucien Rice. Stanford chairman of
i the WSSF.
