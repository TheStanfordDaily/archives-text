WE students of Stanford are a pretty fortu
nate group. Now that may seem to be a
quite ordinary conclusion, but a little matter
came to our attention the other day which fo
cuses that fact, makes it seem more wonder
ful than we ever before realized.
There is an organization, functioning through
out the world, that is known as the World
Student Service Fund. Just casually we hap
pened to pick up a prospectus of that organiza
tion telling of its work and plans. Well, we
were a little bit startled and then amazed by
*he things which this Fund is doing for people
our age in all parts of the world. And we
were rather shocked by what some of our con
vemporaries were going through in order to gain
an education.
But that isn't all. The prospectus also reveals
'hat this organization is providing relief for
American prisoners of war.
Now maybe this work doesn't mean very
much in the abstract to most of us. So, for a
•moment, pretend that you are a student in
China or in Russia or that you are a Japanese-
American student who has been sent to Man
zanar; or imagine that you, a husky young man
of 22, have been captured in bitter jungle fight
ing around the outskirts of Sanananda and have
to spend the next two or three years of your
life merely existing in a concentration camp—
concentrating on nothing.
No, none of those situations are particularly
appetizing and it is in order to make the lives
of young men and women—like ourselves —a
little more bearable that the World Student
Service Fund exists.
In China, for instance, 75 per cent of the stu
dents need relief. Living costs are 30 times
greater than in 1937, winter clothing for stu
dents is needed, medical care is a desperate
need, travel aid for students to follow migrated
universities is necessary; and from Chinese
students themselves comes the appeal, "Food is
our greatest need."
In Russia 640,000 students, dispossessed from
1855 schools, have moved behind the lines to
continue their studies. In Germany 6,000,000
men are in prison camps. In Greece, Africa,
India, Spain, Australia, and right here in our
own nation are students, good constructive
minds, which need help.
The World Student Service Fund is the agen
cy giving these young people that help.
Our generation is trying to live through what
is probably the greatest chaos of the modern
era. Thought and study are today, at best,
struggling phenomena. The rational, con
structive works of this century are in large part
being submerged by man's unfortunate ani

malism. The youth of today has had little op
portunity to continue the rational labor of older
generations; it has been too engrossed in the
vagaries of war to be able to use its mental
processes.
Now, if we are fighting for anything it is the
conquest of matter by the mind. But if there
are no trained minds left in this world we might
just as well keep fighting until the whole spe
cies is exterminated.
The World Student Service Fund is allow
ing a continuance of the scholastic training of
the brains of our contemporaries.
There it is from a couple of angles. The
idea is the same. We are still pretty fortunate.
We are getting enough to eat and we are get
ting enough to keep our minds busy and thus
training ourselves for "when it's over over
there."
We don't need any World Student Service
Fund. But the World Student Service Fund
needs us. Next Monday an intensive three-day
drive begins at Stanford in order that students
less fortunate than us can eat and study, in
order that prisoners of war can occupy them
selves with something more than thoughts of
their pasts.
It might be a good idea for us to support this
appeal as if it had come from a brother or sister
—all young people are really related very close
