It is now the 28th of January; February will
be with us in three days, and still no January
Chaparral. At this rate there's a 50-50 chance
that the Ides of March will be here before the
January Chappie. What is the matter with those

We're as funny in one afternoon as that mag
azine in a month. The subscribers who paid
$1.70 expect to get a magazine once a month,
and expect to gei the January magazine in Jan
uary and not in March. If they have so much
trouble this month, what's going to happen in
February, which has 28?
