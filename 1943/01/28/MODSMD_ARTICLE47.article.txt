The Editor, Sir:
This letter is in reply to "Our Hasher's
drivvle of January 28 in which he berates the
Chaparral for not being on sale as yet and in the
same breath claims to be the funniest man in
the world.
Would you be so kind as to inform the afore
mentioned dim-bulb that the Chaparral will be
on sale tomorrow morning. As a matter fact,
the magazine has been ready for weeks, but
we held up its sale until a warm, sunny Friday
morning came along. To all indications tomor
row is such a day. In this way the subscribers
will not get their magazines wet, and the sales
girls will not get their ears cold.
We will continue with this policy of consid
eration for all, even if we have to sell five
month's magazines on one morning.
However, to get back to this knuckle-brain
hasher. He has been trying to get his material
printed in the Chaparral for years, without suc
cess. In fact there is still a trace of his last con
tribution permeating the air of the office now.
To paraphrase K.K.G. '43—let's face it, he stinks.
Incidentally the magazine is selling for a
new low price of 25 cents, and it's a bargain at
half the once.—The Old 3ov
