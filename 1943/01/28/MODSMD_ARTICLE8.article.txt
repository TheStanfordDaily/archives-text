# STAMPS
## Campus Urged To Help Drive 
### 
"Buy war stamps today in your
living groups to help take money
out of circulation and to help the
government finance the war," is the
War Funds committee plea to aLI
Stanford students.
Stamps go on sale in all living
groups and on the Quad for the
third time this quarter today. The
stamps are sold each Thursday by
special representatives on campus to
give students every opportunity to
buy them.
Students are reminded of the fol
lowing rational reasons for buying
war stamps:
1. To supply the government
with funds for carry ing on the
war: to help buy guns and to build
tanks, airplanes, and ships.
2. To prevent inflation by taking
money out of circulation.
3. To save money for the future
at a higher rate of interest than
banks will give: the interest is 2'a
per cent, and bank rates are usual
ly l'ii per cent.
"The urgency of the stamp and
bond campaign cannot be overlooked
by any individual," say War Board
sponsors," and for that reason the
quota from each person is one 25-
cent stamp."
To show how many stamps are
bought on campus each week, the
total amount of stamps will be pub
lished separately from bond sales.
Individual contributions are meas
ured by house percentages. Last
week approximately $(500 worth of
stamps alone were sold on Thurs
day and there was no report from
the fraternities.
Now that formal rushing is his
tory, nothing should prevent house
representatives from contacting each
individual and reporting.
Stamps may be purchased during
the week at the Cellar store, the
post office, the Bookstore, and bar
ber shop. All stamps bought during
the week may be counted in the
house totals on Stamp Day.
Booths will open during the day
on English and Engineering corners
from 8 a.m. to 3 p.m., in the Cellar
from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m.. and in the Libe
from 8 until 10 p.m.
Totals from each living group will
be printed in The Daily tomorrow.
I Salesmen should report early.
