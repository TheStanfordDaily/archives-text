LONDON, Jan. 27 (UP).—Flying
Fortresses and Liberator bombers
made the first American raid of the
war on Germany today, blasting the
Wilhelmshaven naval base, and the
RAF gave Copenhagen its first at
tack in a swift, double implementa
tion of the Allies' new formula to
"crush Axis war power utterly."
The two "firsts" in the steadily
developing Allied aerial offensive
over Europe came less than 24 hours
after disclosure of the "uncondi
tional surrender" conference be
tween President Roosevelt and
Prime Minister Churchill in Africa.
Bomb Wilhelmshaven
The huge four-engined American
bombers flew 300 miles over the
North Sea in daylight and bombed
Wilhelmshaven heavily, a U.S. Air
Force communique said, and al
though observation of results was
difficult, the harbor was believed to
have been badly smashed.
(Berlin, insisting the Wilhelms
haven attack was carried out by the
British, claimed eight bombers were
shot down and that damage was in
significant except in residential
areas.)
According to the Allied communi
que, only three bombers were lost—
one Fortress and two Liberators.
The Danish capital of Copenhagen
was pounded for the first time by
Britain's fastest bombers, the Mos
quitoes, which attacked shipyards
and Diesel engine works in another
blow at Germany's U-boat cam
paign. Copenhagen is one of the
biggest U-boat production centers
in satellite countries.
One Plane Lost
The Mosquitoes completed their
round trip of 1.000 miles with the
loss of only one plane, indicating
1 that they, as well as the Fortresses
! and Liberators, took Axis defenses
! by surprise.
1 In addition to hitting Wilhelms
haven, the American raiders made
a small diversionary attack on the
nearby port of Emden, bombing an
industrial site. At least nine enemy
fighter planes were shot down dur
ing the operations, a preliminary
count showed.
The big bombers made the 600-
mile round trip in daylight withon
escort, the communique said, ana
encountered enemy fighters, "a num
ber of which were destroyed."
