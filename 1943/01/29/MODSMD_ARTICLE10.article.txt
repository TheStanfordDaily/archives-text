LONDON, Jan. 28 (UP). â€”The
RAF's big four-engined bombers
turned the industrial district of Dus
seldorf, one of Germany's most im
portant arms centers, into a sea of
flames last night in a record-break
ing 20-minute blitz.
Striking only 12 hours after Amer
ican Flying Fortresses and Libera
tors had bombed Wilhelmshaven
and Emden, the Lancaster and Hali
fax bombers dropped hundreds of
tons of demolition bombs and tens
of thousands of incendiaries into the
key city of Germany's Amalgamated
Steel Trust.
The captain of one bomber said,
"The fires started by the bombs,
which included a large number of
two - ton 'block - busters,' gradually
merged into a vast sea of fame that
J painted the heavy clouds red."
Six bombers were lost in the raid,
the 51st of the war on the Rhine
: land city but the first since last Sept.
