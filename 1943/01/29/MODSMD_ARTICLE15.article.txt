# Bosley Speaks on Religion in War
## 
### 
Dr. Harold A. Bosley, of Mount
Vernon Place Church. Baltimore, \
spoke yesterday at 12:15 p.m. in the
garden room of the Union. Dr. j
Bosley spoke on the place of religion j
in the world at war.
"The main forces of religion must
always be supra-national, supra-i
racial, and supra-ecclesiastical. In
a world at war there are all the |
forces to divide men, and the task of
religion is to stress the fundamental
unities that unite men," said Dr. j
Bosley.
He pointed out that in previous â– 
wars religion has beat the drum, but j
this is not the case this time. The ]
church has not become a mere
handmaiden of nationalism, accord
ing to Dr. Bosley.
