## Progress, Competence Seen In Orchestra's Performance 
### 
Altogether competent in its Win
r Quarter concert in Memorial
all last night, the Stanford Sym
hony evinced a well-balanced,
•uly symphonic, tone "in depth,"
hich, with the vigorousness of its
. laying, surpassed all the orchestra's
revious concerts.
Frank Houser, violinist, is without
oubt one of the finest soloists yet to
. lay with the symphony. His strong
.•>t point in rendering Lalo's Sym
phony Espagnole was his whole-
L eartedness, if in fact he was not too
■ viergetic for always strictly accurate
itonation.
The opening Beethoven Prome
leus Overture and the Shostako
ich selection were done with no
hitch whatever. Perhaps,
•i the fix - st movement of the Un
nished, the tempo was slightly
shed for the Lieder style of Schu
•rt.; and two trumpet sforzandos
•ore over-attacked. But these are
•significant criticisms of a per
rmance on the whole commend
ile.
rumpets Outstanding
The trumpets were, as a matter of
ct, outstanding in the sardonics of
hostakovich's ballet polka, in which
.ona Taylor's xylophone also shone.
. t is to be regretted that The Daily's
■ arly deadline prevented hearing of
Jane Bronson and Harry Strick,
■:arp and violin soloists, in the
"Danse Macabre." the
osing selection.
who have followed the or
chestra's development during the
?ast several years are continually
.npressed at what Ferenc Molnar
as been able to accomplish in the
ice of difficulties which would ap
pall most any other director.
Molnar. Bugge
Last night those woh have so
matched and marvelled could take
note that the orchestra's grade is no
onger despairingly steep; for the
undauntable patience of Molnar,
;:ided by the substantial manager
ship of Elwyn Bugge have at last
built at Stanford a respectable and
predominantly student, symphony
orchestra.—Covey
