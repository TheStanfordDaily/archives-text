## Progress, Competence Seen In Orchestra's Performance 
### 
Altogether competent in its Win
ter Quarter concert in Memorial
all last night, the Stanford Sym
phony evinced a well-balanced,
truly symphonic, tone "in depth,"
which, with the vigorousness of its
playing, surpassed all the orchestra's
previous concerts.
Frank Houser, violinist, is without
doubt one of the finest soloists yet to
. lay with the symphony. His strong
.•>t point in rendering Lalo's Sym
phony Espagnole was his whole-
heartedness, if in fact he was not too
energetic for always strictly accurate
intonation.
The opening Beethoven Prome
leus Overture and the Shostako
vich selection were done with no
perceptible hitch whatever. Perhaps,
•i the fix - st movement of the Un
finished, the tempo was slightly
shed for the Lieder style of Schu
bert; and two trumpet sforzandos
were over-attacked. But these are
•significant criticisms of a per
rmance on the whole commend
able.
Trumpets Outstanding
The trumpets were, as a matter of
fact, outstanding in the sardonics of
Shostakovich's ballet polka, in which
Mona Taylor's xylophone also shone.
It is to be regretted that The Daily's
early deadline prevented hearing of
Jane Bronson and Harry Strick,
harp and violin soloists, in the
Saint-Saens "Danse Macabre." the
closing selection.
who have followed the or
chestra's development during the
past several years are continually
impressed at what Ferenc Molnar
has been able to accomplish in the
ice of difficulties which would ap
pall most any other director.
Molnar, Bugge
Last night those who have so
watched and marvelled could take
note that the orchestra's grade is no
longer despairingly steep; for the
undauntable patience of Molnar,
;:ided by the substantial manager
ship of Elwyn Bugge have at last
built at Stanford a respectable and
predominantly student, symphony
orchestra.—Covey
