# Flying Indians Join Marines
## 
### 
Charley Bull and Harold Shafer,
1941-42 editors of the Stanford
Daily, have been commissioned as
second lieutenants in the Marine
Air Corps after preliminary traf%
ing as members of Stanford's ''Fly
ing Indian" Squadron, it was learned
this week.
Shafer, Bull, and several other In
dian fliers—Clark Graham, Ed Ag
new. Joe Voye, A1 Cole, Stu
Stone—were among the top 10 per
cent of their graduating class at
Corpus Christi, Texas, entitling
them to consideration as Marine
candidates.
The men were members of the
group of about 30 Stanford men who
enlisted as a body last spring. They
received preliminary training at
Livermore, Calif.
Then they were transfered to
"Corpus for further training in
combat tactics.
The percentage of Stanford men
who made the Marine Corps is ex
tremely high. All candiadtes for
leatherneck honors must meet re
quirements even more rigid than
those of the Navy, and then only the
upper 10 per cent of the class is
given consideration in making the
choices.
The Flying Indian group remained
intact throughout preliminary train
ing, led by Wing Commander Don
Burness.
The cadets will finish up their
training at the Great Lakes for deck
landing practice before going into
active service.
