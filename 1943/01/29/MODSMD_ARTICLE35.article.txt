### TED NORTON 
"For a fast-moving, hard-hitting!
sport, a real spectators' thrill, mister,
you want to see a rugby game! May- {
be you think there's nothing like ,
football, but rugby, with more con- >
tact, mere motion, more splash, dash, .
f.nd razzle-dazzle, is football's big
brother and looks like it.
Saturday afternoon, tomorrow, the ,
Farm's rugby squad turns out for its |
f.rst games of the season. The Stan- .
ford "A's" will meet a Royal Navy
squad at 3:15. At 2:15, the "B's" will

the following "A" team: Munroe,
Shields, Laverty, Andrews, Seimon,

The squad started practice only
last Tuesday, but the coaches, Harry

that they will be able to show the |
Britishers a good game.
At the beginning of the quarter it
was announced that rugby would j
not be played this year, because of j
lack of funds and lack of coaches, j
The boys on the squad, to whom :
rugby means something, and Harry j
Maloney, who has fathered the game j
at Stanford, decided to put up a j
fight for it. The squad offered to I
take whatever equipment was avail
able and buy more on their own if [
necessary. Maloney, hard - worked
director of minor sports, contacted |
Ebner, secretary of the Rugby Un- j
ion, and Davis, Farm alumnus and
veteran player, who volunteered as
coaches.
The quarter's schedule is now be
ing set up. Games will be arranged ]
with the Olympic Club, U.S.F., the
Coast Guard, Menlo J.C., the Uni- i
versity Club, all of course as warm
up sessions for the Cal game which
will wind up the season as per tra
dition.
