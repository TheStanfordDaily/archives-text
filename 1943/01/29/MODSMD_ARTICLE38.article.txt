It looks as though the All-Univer
sity and Novice Boxing Champion
ships, sponsored yearly by the
Circle S Society, are going to be a
big success, if the number of con
testants signed up and the large
throng that overflows the boxing
gallery to watch the elimination pro
ceedings can be used as a barometer.
We all know that Jack Dempsey,
Gene Tunney, Joe Louis, and Viv
Lindskog are heavyweights. But
perhaps few really know just what
weight Barney Ross, Joe Gans, Ben
ny Leonard, or others fought at. It
seems that there is the weight clas
sification, and that classification has
a name.
Here's the way the weights go for
the National Intercollegiate Ama
teur Association:
Bantamweight 120 Lb.
Featherweight 127 lb.
Lightweight 135 lb.
Welterweight 145-lb.
Senior welterweight 155 lb.
Middleweight 165 lb.
Light-heavyweight 175 lb.
Heavyweight
