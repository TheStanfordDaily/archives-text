(Editorial Note: The following
story has been approved by the
Military Department.)
It was announced by the adminis
tration that a change has been made
in the interpretation of Wednes
day's article on the status of R.O.T.C.
students. Maj. Gen. Kenyon A.
Joyce of the Ninth Service Com
mand issued information that mem
bers of the Army Enlisted Reserve
Corps will be called to duty at the
end of the present quarter.
The exceptions to this call are
medical and pre-medical students,
including dental and veterinary stu
dents, approved engineering course
students, who are classified as sopho
mores, juniors, or seniors, members
of the Advanced R.O.T.C. who have
contracts, and members of the Air
Force Enlisted Reserve.
The information sent out by the
Service Command stated that Senior
Unit Advanced R.O.T.C. students
would be exempted from the call at
the end of the quarter. The original
interpretation was understood to
mean that this applied to second
year advanced men only, but a
Senior R.O.T.C. unit is a college unit
as contrasted with a Junior R.O.T.C.
unit which is a high school unit.
Therefore, first and second-year
advanced men will probably be al
lowed to continue in school under
the interpretation of the Service
Command's information. It means
that both first and second year ad
vanced men will probably be al
lowed to continue in Stanford next
quarter.
There is no known change in the
status of Marine Corps Reserves or
Navy Reserve classes.
