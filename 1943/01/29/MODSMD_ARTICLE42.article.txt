Linari.)

Fred Linari is the midget in Coach Everett Dean's forward offense.
Stretching to five feet nine inches tall, Fritz is dwarfed by Ed Voss and
the rest of the "six-footers" on the team.
Linari, called "Haipo" by his teammates, played ball at Poly High in
San Francisco before coming to Stanford. He's a real veteran here, this
being his senior year and fourth year of play.
The intricate maneuvers of the fast break are "meat" for Fritz. Fast and
clever, his ball handling, speed and gameness make him one of the best
men on the floor. If he can't reach over the opposition, he cuts around and
under them for a score. Fritz and Big Ed Voss shared tip-in honors in last
week's USF during the first half; Ed held them off and Fred ran around
them.
Last year, when the Cards won the championship, Linari was the second
substitute in rank of playing time, lie scored 48 points last season and was
a hard man for the Dartmouth Indians to handle, playing most of the title
game.
Linari came to Stanford a year after Dean's arrival from Indiana. He
came up through the ranks with Dean, and today Dean plays Fritz at the
first string forward position. Spark-plug Linari can dribble under the
basket to shoot with a one-hand motion that hits for a good percentage of
baskets.
Although not the most ('(insistent man on the squad, Linari plays ex
ceptionally well when the going gets tough, He has enough speed to
"carry" the team and keep the hall moving in the fast break. His only
trouble is that lie is sorely in need of height under the backboard. When
he gets a man his size, lie bottles him up effectively.
Last Saturday he played one of his best games offensively and defen
sively, holding Mushy Silver, stellar Don guard, to four points, and scoring
six himself.
Although the Cards weren't too successful on their eastern tour this year,
Linari was high point man. Results of the games in game scores don't show
Linari's promise to people who didn't see the game, but Linari was mildly
terrific. The Cards almost overcame the 111 ini five in the second half be
cause of Fritz's workmanship.
For the rest of the season this year Linari will have some big shoes to
fill. With Pollard in the Coast Guard, he will have to score 241 points to
keep lip with Jim's last year's scoring record. But Fritz is well on his way.

men on the floor. If he can't reach over the opposition, he cuts around and
under them for a score. Fritz and Big Ed Voss shared tip-in honors in last
week's USF during the first half; Ed held them off and Fred ran around
them.
Last year, when the Cards won the championship, Linari was the second
substitute in rank of playing time, lie scored 48 points last season and was
a hard man for the Dartmouth Indians to handle, playing most of the title
game.
Linari came to Stanford a year after Dean's arrival from Indiana. He
came up through the ranks with Dean, and today Dean plays Fritz at the
first string forward position. Spark-plug Linari can dribble under the
basket to shoot with a one-hand motion that hits for a good percentage of
baskets.
Although not the most ('(insistent man on the squad, Linari plays ex
ceptionally well when the going gets tough, He has enough speed to
"carry" the team and keep the hall moving in the fast break. His only
trouble is that lie is sorely in need of height under the backboard. When
he gets a man his size, lie bottles him up effectively.
Last Saturday he played one of his best games offensively and defen
sively, holding Mushy Silver, stellar Don guard, to four points, and scoring
six himself.
Although the Cards weren't too successful on their eastern tour this year,
Linari was high point man. Results of the games in game scores don't show
Linari's promise to people who didn't see the game, but Linari was mildly
terrific. The Cards almost overcame the 111 ini five in the second half be
cause of Fritz's workmanship.
For the rest of the season this year Linari will have some big shoes to
fill. With Pollard in the Coast Guard, he will have to score 241 points to
keep lip with Jim's last year's scoring record. But Fritz is well on his way.

Fred Linari is the midget in Coach Everett Dean's forward offense.
Stretching to five feet nine inches tall, Fritz is dwarfed by Ed Voss and
the rest of the "six-footers" on the team.
Linari, called "Haipo" by his teammates, played ball at Poly High in
San Francisco before coming to Stanford. He's a real veteran here, this
being his senior year and fourth year of play.
The intricate maneuvers of the fast break are "meat" for Fritz. Fast and
clever, his ball handling, speed and gameness make him one of the best
men on the floor. If he can't reach over the opposition, he cuts around and
under them for a score. Fritz and Big Ed Voss shared tip-in honors in last
