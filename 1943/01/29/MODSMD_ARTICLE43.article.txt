# Cal Honored at Scalp Fest Tonight
## Hangerless Bears Hope for Repeat Win Over Farm Five 
### ED LUCE 
Haitgerlcss hut still potent. Nibs Price and his U. of Cal cagers invade
the Pavilion tonight for the second of four Big Gaines with Stanford':*
scalp-hunting Indians.
Victors, last Friday night over a Farm squad superior every
where but on the scoreboard, the Bears will undoubtedly miss fabulous

Chuck, whose induction into
Army Saturday helped Stanford al- i
most as much as it did the Army. '
Friday was "give a Hanger a big
send-off" night, but it was the lanky
sophomore himself who made the !
event a success, dumping in the tie
ing field goal and winning free throw
to give the Berkeley lads their first
Big Game cage win since 1941.
Fray Toss-up
Tonight's fray must still be rated
a toss-up, however, if only because
Stanford-Cal contests are always
unpredictable. If there is an edge
it rests with Everett Dean's Indians.
Besides Hanger's absence, the Farm
hands have on their side the advan
tage of playing on home grounds,
instead of in the Berkeley "Boo"
Pavilion.
Dean, whose prediction that last
Friday's winner would be the team
with the best shooting average was
absolutely correct (averages: Stan
ford 18 per cent, California 21 per
cent), sent the squad through a
short, stiff drill yesterday afternoon.
The first, second, and third strings
worked their pivot offense against
the frosh reserves, the second five j
seeing most of the action. Freddie
Linari sparked the workout by sink
ing five consecutive field goals, all
difficult shots, in the short time he
was in.
CARDS IN SHAPE
Dean says his boys are in top
shape, and, needless to say, gunning
for the Bears. Stanford now has
nothing to worry about as far as
conference standings are concerned,
since they no longer have a chance
at the title, and therefore can con
centrate on pulling the four-game :
Cal series out of the fire.
Howie Dallmar's piay was particu
larly outstanding, and if the veteran
guard can regain the shooting eye
he had against St. Mary's Pre-Flight,
it might all be over but the shouting.
Dallmar scored seven points last Fri
day as did Ed Voss. Jack Dana got
six, and Linari five.
Dean plans to open with the usual
lineup, Dana and Linari at forwards,
Voss at center, and Dallmar and Mc-
Caffery at guards.
Saturday night the Oakland Air

Base, without Jim Pollard and Don
Burness, but nevertheless strong,
comes down for a game with the
Cards.
The Air Base, winner over USF
last week, has Bob Alameda, forme?
Cal forward, and Ed Loomis, St
Mary's star a while back, as then
key men.
