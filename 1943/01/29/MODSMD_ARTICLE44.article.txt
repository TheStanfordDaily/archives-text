## Papeese, Cubs Clash Tonight 
### Ed Luce 
The Berkeley Bear Cub meets the
Palo Alto Papoose tonight at 6:15 in
the Pavilion, opening that three
round hardwood series to decide this
year's "Big Little" basketball cham
pion.
Cal's claim to pre-game favor
itism is based on an outstanding
seasonal record (won 12, lost 1). and
the fact that the Berkeley Babes
have been playing together since
late November.
The U.C. Frosh have an opening
quintet that is fast, tall, and confi
dent. Starting at one forward will
be 6-foot, 4-in. Bob Rutley, a push
shot artist from Piedmont. Papeese
Babe Higgins and Rob Rowe, team
mates of Rutley last season, say he
works the backboards hard and
shoots well.
Andy Wolf
Other forward slot is handled by
cocky little Andy Wolf, a southpaw
who averaged 15 points a game his
last year in high school.
Smoothest Cal freshman is center
Tom Tryon, dusky, 6-foot, 2-inch
pivoter, Tryon shoots with either
hand, handles the ball flawlessly, and
is rated the Cubs' best all-around
player
Cub guards are Tom Stinson and
Bill Hooper, both of whom nudge
the 6-foot mark. Stinson is a ball
hawk par excellence, while Hooper
delights in open field dribbling
orgies.

Against this quintet. Weir will
send a squad that is still to play its
best basketball. At forwards are
Babe Higgins and Hugh West. Hig
gins is the hardest driver on the
team, and is at his best under and
around the basket.
West the Midget
West, 5-foot, 9-inch "midget" of
the squad, has developed an un
canny push shot from the right cor
ner, a shot which has been good for
at least six points in each of the last
four games.
Former forward Dave Davidson,
leading scorer thus far, was shifted
over to center last week against
Menlo and looked so good that he
will start tonight at that post.
Dick Berlin and Bill Christiansen
at guards complete the starting five.
Berlin s aptitude for his new posi

tion ha s highlighted workouts.
Christiansen won a starting post
through his sparkling performance
against Menlo early this week.
Tomorrow night the Papeese again
go into action, this time tackling San
Mateo J.C.
