JMPELLED by our sense of fair play, we are
i publishing a letter from the hard-working
editors of the Stanford Quad asking for some
workers for their publication. The nation-wide
shortage of labor is being felt here by almost
all activities.
Campus activities have been cut drastically
this year to eliminate the non-essential, yet there
is still a shortage of workers. Both the Quad
and The Daily—which we like to believe play
an important part in campus life—welcome
anyone who would like to work with us. Those
of us who have been around these publications
for a few years and who have reached what
some people jokingly refer to as the "top"
realize more and more that it is the humble re
porters and copy readers and desk workers who
are responsible for a good newspaper or a good
yearbook.
We realize that everyone on this campus is
working harder this quarter than ever before,
what v/ith heavier courses and difficult study
conditions. Yet we still wish to ask that anyone
interested in the Quad or Daily drop around
and try out. It's interesting work, and you can
put in just as much time as you want to give it.
Incidentally, the Quad deadline for pictures
has come and gone, and unlike Quad deadlines
of previous years, it will not pop up again next
month. There's just one chance left to get your
picture in with your fraternity, sorority, hall or
club, and that is to visit the Harlsook Studio in
San Francisco this week-end or next week. See
you there.—Ferris Boothe.
