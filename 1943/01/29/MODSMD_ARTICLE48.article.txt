# OUR HASHER SEZ

Tonight we—l use that in its broader sense —
tangle with State U. in a basketball game on the
pavilion boards. There always has been con
siderable spirit shown at Cal-Stanford hoop
contests, even more than at the football games
occasionally, since everybody is sgueezed in
so compactly.
Our boys always look forward to Berkeley
with bathroom stationery, fish, ducks, and other
groceries in their mind's eye. This is probably
due to the not infreguent barrages of the above
mentioned that have assailed Stanford teams in
the past. Although such things are gradually
subsiding at that institution across the bay, there
is still a trace of the rowdy in the grandstands.
Evidently the reason for this long-standing
attitude is that Cal students feel they can show
themselves to be more manly and virile than
the A.S.S.U. by being more crude and loud.
However, no matter what the reasoning is, it is
hardly the thing for college students—the fu
ture leaders of our nation—to be doing.
So tonight here in our pavilion, let's keep our
reputation intact and not throw at the players'
and officials' heads. Aim at their feet.
Edie, our cook, was pretty pushed out of
shape when at one a.m. Thurs. morn she was
awakened by raucous singing noises outside
her window.
Seems that a trio of boozed collegians were
serenading the girls of our tong with such old
favorites as "The Cuspidor My Father Left to
Me," "The Phi Delt Sweetheart Song," and
other conservatory gems. This noise is not
lessened when members of a frat across the
aisle yell insulting things to the bards. Natch
the bards insult back.
Out come warriors of disturbed house ready
for any battle, verbal preferred. Girls of sere
naded tong then phone frat of bards for reserves
which soon are storming up alley.
Total result—nothing happened.
You can go to the pavilion and see the Stan
ford Indians bring the poor California Bears
down in igdimonius ruin. It will not be an easy
game so come and cheer. It will be a good
game—one of the most exciting of the season.
After that you can do one of a number of
things. You can go to the Roble open house,
the Cardinal-sponsored Half and Half dance, or
you can go to the Nitery and dance to the rec
ord machine and drink cokes.
If you are not one for relaxation you can even
go to the library and educate yourself. See ya
at the libe. I'll be at the second table on the
left.

other conservatory gems. This noise is not
lessened when members of a frat across the
aisle yell insulting things to the bards. Natch
the bards insult back.
Out come warriors of disturbed house ready
for any battle, verbal preferred. Girls of sere
naded tong then phone frat of bards for reserves
which soon are storming up alley.
Total result—nothing happened.
You can go to the pavilion and see the Stan
ford Indians bring the poor California Bears
down in igdimonius ruin. It will not be an easy
game so come and cheer. It will be a good
game—one of the most exciting of the season.
After that you can do one of a number of
things. You can go to the Roble open house,
the Cardinal-sponsored Half and Half dance, or
you can go to the Nitery and dance to the rec
ord machine and drink cokes.
If you are not one for relaxation you can even
go to the library and educate yourself. See ya
at the libe. I'll be at the second table on the
left.
Tonight we—l use that in its broader sense —
tangle with State U. in a basketball game on the
pavilion boards. There always has been con
siderable spirit shown at Cal-Stanford hoop
contests, even more than at the football games
occasionally, since everybody is sgueezed in
so compactly.
Our boys always look forward to Berkeley
with bathroom stationery, fish, ducks, and other
groceries in their mind's eye. This is probably
due to the not infreguent barrages of the above
mentioned that have assailed Stanford teams in
the past. Although such things are gradually
subsiding at that institution across the bay, there
is still a trace of the rowdy in the grandstands.
Evidently the reason for this long-standing
attitude is that Cal students feel they can show
themselves to be more manly and virile than
the A.S.S.U. by being more crude and loud.
However, no matter what the reasoning is, it is
hardly the thing for college students—the fu
ture leaders of our nation—to be doing.
So tonight here in our pavilion, let's keep our
reputation intact and not throw at the players'
and officials' heads. Aim at their feet.
Edie, our cook, was pretty pushed out of
shape when at one a.m. Thurs. morn she was
awakened by raucous singing noises outside
her window.
Seems that a trio of boozed collegians were
serenading the girls of our tong with such old
favorites as "The Cuspidor My Father Left to
Me," "The Phi Delt Sweetheart Song," and
other conservatory gems. This noise is not
lessened when members of a frat across the
