Dear Sirs:
This is an open letter to the student body.
The Quad is trying to meet a deadline. We
think that this yearbook will be the best ever.
But even the best of yearbooks cannot be for
mulated, cannot be published, cannot be de
livered in time, if we do not have a staff to help
us out. Last quarter we had many tryoutees—
many frosh women whey did a splendid job—
and we thank them. But this quarter the editors
have been swamped with work—and have no
body to help them. We need staff members.
There are several postions open for men and
women who will spare the few hours a week
that we ask of them. A staff member is asked
to work at the Quad shack any three hours a
week. The work is not hard; it is really inter
esting, and quite a lot of fun. There are any
number of jobs open. Anyone who likes to
write copy, type, sell advertisements, lay pan
els, take pictures, or develop photographs is
needed and is wanted. Anyone who is inter
ested is asked to drop by the Quad shack any
afternoon, and we'll gladly sign the person up
as a tryoutee.
The Editors, Stanford Quad
