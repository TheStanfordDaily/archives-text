# Roble Sponsors Propose Elimination of Sororities On Stanford Campus
## Row Women Asked to Drop National Charters, Join University Residence System by Frosh Advisory Group 
### Jane Glasson 
A concrete objection to the sorority system on the Stanford campus am*
a specific plan to eliminate their recognized faults hy gradually abolishing
sororities was presented to presidents, representatives, and alumnae ad
visors of Stanford's nine houses by the Roble sponsors at a meeting last
night in (be Women' Clubhouse.

t can no longer be condoned, the
sponsors, composed of both Hall and
Row women, called the meeting,
asking the sororities to seriously
consider their increasingly super
fluous position at Stanford.
Not Rapid Decision
Emphasizing the fact that the
meeting was not called on the spu.:
of the moment or merely because o;
the recent unsatisfactory rush per
iod, Bobbie Sadler, Tri-Delta, presi
dent of Roble and chairman of the
meeting, said the reaction agaiiis
the system was the result of
years of living at Stanford and ex
amining the advantages ottered to
this institution by sororities.
Explaining how sororities hap
pened to be originally established ac
Stanford, Miss Sadler said that David
Starr Jordan had come from Indiana
where there were sororities. In the
early days, the University was faced,
with housing and financial difficul
| ties; so charters were granted to
! campus living groups.
j More Women Now
But she added emphatically that
j many things have changed since
| then, mainly the number of women
: students, which have alleviated the
! need of chapter houses.

in the long run.
The plan proposed for consider: -
tion was that there be no more rusr
ing or pledging, that the Universit
take over the houses now occupio
by sororities and assume any obi:
gations thereby entailed, that t".
sororities voluntarily turn in the
national charters, and that a lar..
| dormitory be provided after the w..
| to replace a majority of the sm,..
i living groups.
"We are not here to deny the ad
vantages of sororities in other
places," advised Miss Sadler, "but
ve do not believe that the system is
suitable, to our campus."
Tie of Friendship
Marcella Mahoney, Kappa, told
)he group that the strong point of a
sorority was the tie of friendship
between 30 girls rather than 2 or 3.
In reply she was reminded that
only one out of three girls receive
this benefit at Stanford.
Asking if small independent
iiving groups on the campus had
proved themselves successful, Janet
Atkison, Kappa, was answered that
the tie in independent groups was
the University, not the individual
sorority.
In an effort to contradict the
printed statement of the sponsors
that house interests frequently in
terfere with the development of in
dividuals as leaders in campus life,
Barbara Woods, AOPi, stated that
houses urged activities.
Houses Hall Activities
In response, Bea Mac Donald. Chi
O, replied that houses try to pledge
;otential activity women, but after
they're in a house, the campus won't
accept them in activities if it means
a house monopoly on leadership.
She said that even now in Roble,
affiliations were apparent in the
choosing of leaders.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi,
.said she believed the disadvantages
of sororities outweighed their 4tan
advantages, and that the few ad
vantages offered were not worth the
hurt delivered to new women who
i.id not pledge.
Supporting this viewpoint, Mary
Supple, Alpha Phi, illustrated that
£irls who come from towns where

sororities are important feel dis
criminated against when they don't
pledge, and often a lasting impres
sion is made on the girls' personality.
Natural Cliques
After it was pointed out by several
Row women that cliques would not
disappear even though sororities
were to be abolished, Miss Mac-
Donald answered that cliques and
groups formed in dormitories were
out of natural friendship rather than
on an artificial rushing basis.
Speaking for the Row women,
Dorothy Suppiger, Gamma Phi,
asked that a list of potential advan
tages of changing to a dormitory
system be prepared so that sorori
ties would be in a better position to
weigh the change unbiasedly.
Rosemary Cross, Delta Gamma,
said she believed the halls' poten
tialities were underestimated be
cause they now labored under an
inferiority complex caused by undue
social prestige given the Row.
No Definite Decision
Last night's meeting was not an
attempt to reach a definite decision,
but rather to present the severe
problem to the sorority women, since
any action must come from within
the sororities.
As soon as letters can be obtained
from the Administration expressing
their viewpoints, another meeting
will be called by the sponsors. In
the meantime, house representatives
will discuss the proposed plan in
their living groups.

Dorothy Suppiger, Gamma Phi,
asked that a list of potential advan
tages of changing to a dormitory
system be prepared so that sorori
ties would be in a better position to
weigh the change unbiasedly.
Rosemary Cross, Delta Gamma,
said she believed the halls' poten
tialities were underestimated be
cause they now labored under an
inferiority complex caused by undue
social prestige given the Row.
No Definite Decision
Last night's meeting was not an
attempt to reach a definite decision,
but rather to present the severe
problem to the sorority women, since
any action must come from within
the sororities.
As soon as letters can be obtained
from the Administration expressing
their viewpoints, another meeting
will be called by the sponsors. In
the meantime, house representatives
will discuss the proposed plan in
their living groups.
A concrete objection to the sorority system on the Stanford campus am*
a specific plan to eliminate their recognized faults hy gradually abolishing
sororities was presented to presidents, representatives, and alumnae ad
visors of Stanford's nine houses by the Roble sponsors at a meeting last
night in (be Women' Clubhouse.

t can no longer be condoned, the
sponsors, composed of both Hall and
Row women, called the meeting,
asking the sororities to seriously
consider their increasingly super
fluous position at Stanford.
Not Rapid Decision
Emphasizing the fact that the
meeting was not called on the spu.:
of the moment or merely because o;
the recent unsatisfactory rush per
iod, Bobbie Sadler, Tri-Delta, presi
dent of Roble and chairman of the
meeting, said the reaction agaiiis
the system was the result of
years of living at Stanford and ex
amining the advantages ottered to
this institution by sororities.
Explaining how sororities hap
pened to be originally established ac
Stanford, Miss Sadler said that David
Starr Jordan had come from Indiana
where there were sororities. In the
early days, the University was faced,
with housing and financial difficul
| ties; so charters were granted to

in the long run.
The plan proposed for consider: -

ing or pledging, that the Universit
take over the houses now occupio
by sororities and assume any obi:
gations thereby entailed, that t".
sororities voluntarily turn in the
national charters, and that a lar..

i living groups.
"We are not here to deny the ad
vantages of sororities in other
places," advised Miss Sadler, "but
ve do not believe that the system is
suitable, to our campus."
Tie of Friendship
Marcella Mahoney, Kappa, told
)he group that the strong point of a
sorority was the tie of friendship
between 30 girls rather than 2 or 3.
In reply she was reminded that
only one out of three girls receive
this benefit at Stanford.
Asking if small independent
iiving groups on the campus had
proved themselves successful, Janet
Atkison, Kappa, was answered that
the tie in independent groups was
the University, not the individual
sorority.
In an effort to contradict the
printed statement of the sponsors
that house interests frequently in
terfere with the development of in
dividuals as leaders in campus life,
Barbara Woods, AOPi, stated that
houses urged activities.
Houses Hall Activities
In response, Bea Mac Donald. Chi
O, replied that houses try to pledge
;otential activity women, but after
they're in a house, the campus won't
accept them in activities if it means
a house monopoly on leadership.
She said that even now in Roble,
affiliations were apparent in the
choosing of leaders.
Leslie Langnecker, Alpha Phi,
.said she believed the disadvantages
of sororities outweighed their 4tan
advantages, and that the few ad
vantages offered were not worth the
hurt delivered to new women who
i.id not pledge.
Supporting this viewpoint, Mary
Supple, Alpha Phi, illustrated that
£irls who come from towns where

sororities are important feel dis
criminated against when they don't
pledge, and often a lasting impres
sion is made on the girls' personality.
Natural Cliques
After it was pointed out by several
Row women that cliques would not
disappear even though sororities
were to be abolished, Miss Mac-
Donald answered that cliques and
groups formed in dormitories were
out of natural friendship rather than
on an artificial rushing basis.

of sororities outweighed their 4tan
advantages, and that the few ad
vantages offered were not worth the
hurt delivered to new women who
i.id not pledge.
Supporting this viewpoint, Mary
Supple, Alpha Phi, illustrated that
£irls who come from towns where

sororities are important feel dis
criminated against when they don't
pledge, and often a lasting impres
sion is made on the girls' personality.
Natural Cliques
After it was pointed out by several
Row women that cliques would not
disappear even though sororities
were to be abolished, Miss Mac-
Donald answered that cliques and
groups formed in dormitories were
out of natural friendship rather than
on an artificial rushing basis.
Speaking for the Row women,
Dorothy Suppiger, Gamma Phi,
asked that a list of potential advan
tages of changing to a dormitory
system be prepared so that sorori
ties would be in a better position to
weigh the change unbiasedly.
Rosemary Cross, Delta Gamma,
said she believed the halls' poten
tialities were underestimated be
cause they now labored under an
inferiority complex caused by undue
social prestige given the Row.
No Definite Decision
Last night's meeting was not an
attempt to reach a definite decision,
but rather to present the severe
problem to the sorority women, since
any action must come from within
the sororities.
As soon as letters can be obtained
from the Administration expressing
their viewpoints, another meeting
will be called by the sponsors. In
the meantime, house representatives
will discuss the proposed plan in
their living groups.
A concrete objection to the sorority system on the Stanford campus am*
a specific plan to eliminate their recognized faults hy gradually abolishing
sororities was presented to presidents, representatives, and alumnae ad
visors of Stanford's nine houses by the Roble sponsors at a meeting last
night in (be Women' Clubhouse.

t can no longer be condoned, the
sponsors, composed of both Hall and
Row women, called the meeting,
asking the sororities to seriously
consider their increasingly super
fluous position at Stanford.

Emphasizing the fact that the
meeting was not called on the spu.:

the recent unsatisfactory rush per
iod, Bobbie Sadler, Tri-Delta, presi

meeting, said the reaction agaiiis
the system was the result of
years of living at Stanford and ex

this institution by sororities.
Explaining how sororities hap
pened to be originally established ac
Stanford, Miss Sadler said that David
Starr Jordan had come from Indiana
where there were sororities. In the
early days, the University was faced,
with housing and financial difficul

"We are not here to deny the ad
vantages of sororities in other
places," advised Miss Sadler, "but
ve do not believe that the system is
suitable, to our campus."
Tie of Friendship
Marcella Mahoney, Kappa, told
)he group that the strong point of a
sorority was the tie of friendship
between 30 girls rather than 2 or 3.
In reply she was reminded that
only one out of three girls receive
this benefit at Stanford.
Asking if small independent
iiving groups on the campus had
proved themselves successful, Janet
Atkison, Kappa, was answered that
the tie in independent groups was
the University, not the individual
sorority.
In an effort to contradict the
printed statement of the sponsors
that house interests frequently in
terfere with the development of in
dividuals as leaders in campus life,
Barbara Woods, AOPi, stated that
houses urged activities.
Houses Hall Activities
In response, Bea Mac Donald. Chi
O, replied that houses try to pledge
;otential activity women, but after
they're in a house, the campus won't
accept them in activities if it means
a house monopoly on leadership.
She said that even now in Roble,
affiliations were apparent in the
choosing of leaders.
