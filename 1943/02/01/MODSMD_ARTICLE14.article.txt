## Sun to Be Topic Of Series Talk 
### 
Tales of the sun and its action,
known in detail to the astronomer
but a subject of general ignorance
among laymen, form the basis of
Seth B. Nicolson's lecture, "The Sun
in Action," to be presented at the
Tuesday Evening Series tomorrow
night at 7:30 in Memorial Hall.
Dr. Nicholson is head of the Solar
Division at Mount Wilson Observa
tory in Pasadena. There Dr. Nichol
son specializes in solar astronomy
and stellar radiations, and there he
discovered the 9th, 10th, and 11th
satellites of Jupiter.
He believes in giving the laymen
an appreciation of the sun's power
by tying it to that well known sub
ject, the purse string. For example,
he has calculated that at a normal
rate of 2Vii cents per kilowatt hour,
a person would put out $50 for the
sunlight he receives.
Dr. Nicholson's lecture will be
illustrated.
