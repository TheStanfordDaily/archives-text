# Bones' Halstead Sparks Varsity Five To Last-Minute Victory Over Bears
## Golden Bears Fall To Division Cellar 
### Bill Hornby 
A big weekend in the life of Mr.
•ones Halstead turned into a big
'eekend for Stanford's 1943 cagers
s they watched the Golden Bear
2turn to Berkeley and the southern
iyision cellar after a 36-34 defeat.
While actually forwards Jack
)ana and Freddie Linari were the
ids who found their long-misplaced
hooting eyes nine seconds before
le gun to pot four points and the
'a! victory in the wildest Pavilion
It in many a year, the moral kudos
ightfully fall on the Halstead
bbulders.
The Sacramento junior finally got
ne break he has been waiting for
opefully in one and a half years of
ench warming late in the. second
till. Everett Dean pulled McCaffrey
dlh Stanford behind 12-15.
Ir. Bones Enters
In goes Mr. Bones, and he did not
istinguish himself particularly,
lanaging to foul Cuneo and miss a
ouple of close ins. But his fire
eenied to put the gas into the some
what lethargic Indian buggy and
>ean sent him back for the second
alf start.
The Indians were trailing after
he half 16-19 when Harpo Linari
ushed a long, one-armer from the
enter and Dallmar hit a freak angle
hot, seemingly from a point almost
ehind the backboard plane, to make
20-19 Stanford.
"he Glory Trail
With the score 28-27, Halstead
tarted out on the glory trail. Ap
earing to be uncoordination in the
esh, the slender guard managed to
/aver into practically every back
on rd recover. He fluttered one
ucket in from the side to push Le
an d J. into a 28-28 tie. Arnold
ounced right back with a Cal
ucket, but Halstead hit again from
he center —30-30.
Arnold made it 32-30 but back
ame Bones with a sidearm shot that
aised the roof. Stanford recovered
ne ball, practically everybody and
is brother took a shot, Rocker got
ne ball and flipped Cal into a 34-32
Dad with nine seconds to so.

Linari looped a miracle from mid
center and Cal took it out. Came a
massive scramble, and then Jack
Dana emerged and performed a two
handed set-shot from straight out,
as the gun gunned.
After Commissioner Herb Dana
and his wife had come back to earth
in front of us, we surveyed the team,
and no happier face was present
than that of Mr. Bones.

Irish counties of Down and Antrim

earing to be uncoordination in the
esh, the slender guard managed to
/aver into practically every back
on rd recover. He fluttered one
ucket in from the side to push Le
an d J. into a 28-28 tie. Arnold
ounced right back with a Cal
ucket, but Halstead hit again from
he center —30-30.
Arnold made it 32-30 but back
ame Bones with a sidearm shot that
aised the roof. Stanford recovered
ne ball, practically everybody and
is brother took a shot, Rocker got
ne ball and flipped Cal into a 34-32
Dad with nine seconds to so.

Linari looped a miracle from mid
center and Cal took it out. Came a
massive scramble, and then Jack
Dana emerged and performed a two
handed set-shot from straight out,
as the gun gunned.
After Commissioner Herb Dana
and his wife had come back to earth
in front of us, we surveyed the team,
and no happier face was present
than that of Mr. Bones.

Many of the inhabitants of the
Irish counties of Down and Antrim
speak a form of old Scotch, with
little sign of the Irish tongue.
A big weekend in the life of Mr.
•ones Halstead turned into a big
'eekend for Stanford's 1943 cagers
s they watched the Golden Bear
2turn to Berkeley and the southern
iyision cellar after a 36-34 defeat.
While actually forwards Jack
)ana and Freddie Linari were the
ids who found their long-misplaced
hooting eyes nine seconds before
le gun to pot four points and the
'a! victory in the wildest Pavilion
It in many a year, the moral kudos
ightfully fall on the Halstead
bbulders.
The Sacramento junior finally got
ne break he has been waiting for
opefully in one and a half years of
ench warming late in the. second
till. Everett Dean pulled McCaffrey
dlh Stanford behind 12-15.
Ir. Bones Enters
In goes Mr. Bones, and he did not
istinguish himself particularly,
lanaging to foul Cuneo and miss a
ouple of close ins. But his fire
eenied to put the gas into the some
what lethargic Indian buggy and
>ean sent him back for the second
alf start.
The Indians were trailing after
he half 16-19 when Harpo Linari
ushed a long, one-armer from the
enter and Dallmar hit a freak angle
hot, seemingly from a point almost
ehind the backboard plane, to make
20-19 Stanford.
