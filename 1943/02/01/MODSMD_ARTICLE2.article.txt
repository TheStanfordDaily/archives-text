# W.S.S.F. DRIVE
## $2,000 Goal Is Announced As W.S.S.F. Drive Begins Today 
### 
A drive to collect $2,000 begins on
the campus this morning. Two
thousand dollars is only a small part
of the money needed by the World
Student Service Fund to administer
relief to suppressed students in war
torn countries on every continent.
In order to fill the Stanford quota
every member of the University will
be asked to contribute a dollar some
time during this week.
Lucien Rice will open the first
day of the drive by addressing La
gunita during dinner tonight. He
will speak of the purpose of the drive
and the serious need for funds. At
the same time other eating groups
will be addressed, and the impor
tance of the drive is to be stressed at
all house meetings tonight.
Last week Excom contributed $17
and El Tigre eating club donated one
dollar a piece en masse, totaling $43.
Tonight the fraternities and sorori
ties will be asked to contribute their
share.
"I hope that our contribution
will be a generous one."
'"That one dollar will mean very
little to you in comparison to the
value it will hold for a student in
Greece. To you that dollar would
buy an expensive evening at the
Nitery, to a Greek it would buy three
meals a day for a week," said Lucien
Rice, chairman of the W.S.S.F.
drive.
