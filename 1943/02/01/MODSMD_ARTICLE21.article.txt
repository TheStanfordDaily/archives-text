# Indians Ride Over Alameda Air Base
## 
### 
After nipping the Berkeley B'ars
in the last second Friday night,
Everett Dean's improving Indians
smeared the Alameda Naval Air
Base all over the Pavilion Saturday,
56-31.
Little Freddie Linari was the sen
sation of the evening, suddenly com
ing to life after turning in average
performances most of the season to
dump in 17 points in the 20 minutes
he saw action.
Dean started his new find, Bob
Halstead, at one guard, Leo Mac-
Caff ery in place of Howie Dallmar
at the other, Ed Voss at center, and
Linari and Jack Dana at forwards,
but hauled out for good all but Hal
stead and MacCaffery at the half.
With Linari scoring 10 and Voss
the other 3, the Cards jumped to a
13-2 lead in the opening minutes,
and went to a 30-10 advantage at
halftime.
Every man on the bench got in
the second half, and the action
picked up perceptibly as former
Californian Bob Alameida kept his
mates close to the pace with several
push shots.
Fred Oliver sparked the second
string Dean used, notching 8 points,
most of them on setups under the
basket.
