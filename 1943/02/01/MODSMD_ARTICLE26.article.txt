# That Grade Problem

So states the regulations for the reserve pro
gram of the United States Navy. And the Navy
means it.
Thirty Stanford men, Navy reservists, will
be summoned to active duty in a few days be
cause they didn't take this warning to heart. The
necessity for good scholarship was dinned into
our ears by every school authority last guarter,
/et scholarship fell down. In the freshman class
105 men went on probation, almost one
man in every four.
The Navy for its officers wants college
graduates and if it can't get college graduates,
:U wants men in good academic standing. In
'his respect, it places more emphasis on grades
*han does the Army. It does not believe that it
'S worthwhile to leave a man in school when he
is not doing satisfactory work. Simply by going
minus, these thirty Stanford men not only lose
v he advantages of further education at this point
but lose their chance to become Navy officers,
tn addition, an almost identical number of men
=ire on the border-line—this guarter will deter
mine their standing.

We don't propose to hold these men up as
failures. We all know some of the men who
will leave and they're fine fellows. They simply
were affected more by the "exceptional circum
stances" which contributed to last quarter's poor
scholarship.
Wartime excitement has made it difficult to
study. But to become good officers —Army or
Navy —we must learn to concentrate with all out
might on the job at hand despite external diffi
culties. And our job is not to fight the war now,
it is to study and learn the things we are sup
posed to know to help out our country in the
future. Grades are the most concrete evidence
to show whether or not we are doing this.
Grades aren't everything, naturally. But they
do indicate more than anything else what we
have done in this University. We have seen
their importance to the Navy, and they will ac
company us into the Army as evidence of our
ability. They are important.
Now is the time to get the grades. It is still
early in the quarter, mid-terms are just begin
ning, everyone still has an excellent opportunity
to pull grades up despite their previous efforts
this quarter. Averages are generally higher this
quarter, this means additional effort will be re
quired. So let's concentrate on the. job at hand,

Wartime excitement has made it difficult to
study. But to become good officers —Army or
Navy —we must learn to concentrate with all out
might on the job at hand despite external diffi
culties. And our job is not to fight the war now,
it is to study and learn the things we are sup
posed to know to help out our country in the
future. Grades are the most concrete evidence
to show whether or not we are doing this.
Grades aren't everything, naturally. But they
do indicate more than anything else what we

their importance to the Navy, and they will ac
company us into the Army as evidence of our
ability. They are important.
Now is the time to get the grades. It is still
early in the quarter, mid-terms are just begin

to pull grades up despite their previous efforts
