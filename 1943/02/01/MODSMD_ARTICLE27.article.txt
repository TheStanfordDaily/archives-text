# Dig a Little Deeper
## 
### 
WHEN we were first confronted by the mys
tic initials WSSF last Wednesday, few of
us had any idea of their meaning. Some of us

were curious enough to read on and find out
that WSSF means World Student Service Fund.
Just another touch was our first reaction and
we immediately went on our guard. But most
of us have come to realize that this is a real
cause, something we should all contribute to
even if it isn't the full dollar the fund is shoot
ing at. Yes, Stanford students are forever con
tributing to something—we have Dimes for Di
plomas and Stamps every week and Infantile
Paralysis and the Red Cross around the corner,
but let's dig a little deeper for the WSSF. Be
hind those imposing initials lies something very
much worth while.—Ferris Boothe
