Stanford's rassling coach may not realize it
but on campus is the man who threw the 1937
and 1938 Oregon State champs. This man,
better known as "The Mag," is a real demon
on the mats. However, he lost one fall to "The
Dill" not so long ago. "The Dill," you'll recall,
is the boy who took "The Duke" with a body
slam at a Quadrangle meeting last summer.
Local promoters are trying to arrange a
match between "The Mag" and "The Duke" to
get the challenger for "The Dill." When the
latter was approached to make a statement all
he would say was "Smoozay Seezay."
