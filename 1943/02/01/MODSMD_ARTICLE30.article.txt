# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
At Stanford it makes little difference whether
you are hall or row. In many other schools one
must be bid a house or be left out of things, but
at Stanford the hall is just as important as the
row in activities and campus life. Many girls
decide that they would prefer to live in the halls
â€”it is not a choice forced upon them by cir
cumstances. A girl may have bids to several
houses and still go hall.
Rumors are very prevalent concerning this
or that house or hall. Girls naturally are very
disappointed at not being pledged, but it blows
over.
After the excitement passes, they begin to
see conditions as they really are.
After all, it's very much like going to a
party where they serve cake with two types of
frosting. Some get to choose which frosting they
want, some don't care, some take what comes.
But it really doesn't matter much. The cake is
the big thing. Here at Stanford the frostings are
hall and row, but the cake is Stanford. Stanford
is the big thing, and the Stanford family em
braces all living groups.
Sincerely,
Eve Pleasant
