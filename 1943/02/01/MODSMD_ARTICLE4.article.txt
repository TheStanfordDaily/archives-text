# Navy Summons 30 Reservists
## 
### 
Thirty Navy reservists received
warning notices from naval head-
I quarters last week that they will bo
â€¢ summoned to active duty as ap-
I prentice seamen within a few days,
Assistant Registrar Karl Cowdery
I announced yesterday.
These V-l and V-7 students will
not be allowed to finish the Winter
Quarter as their scholastic record
ending last quarter was "not in good
standing." They will receive tuition
refunds proportionate to the time
remaining in the quarter.
Some Exceptions
A few exceptions have been made
allowing several reservists whose
record fell bek>w a "C" average to
remain at Stanford on probation. It
was explained that "exceptional cir
cumstances" have made an arbitrary,
hard-and-fast application of the
naval regulations inadvisable.
The Navy has made a close study
of all reservists' transcripts and have
made no hasty decisions, remarked
Dr. Cowdery.
Navy Regulations
The basis on which reservists are
taken into service is determined by
Navy regulations which state that
"at the close of each grading period,
those V-l and V-7 students not in
the university's required scholastic
standing will be immediately taken
into active service as apprentice sea
j men."
"It is obvious that by the end of
the quarter, the borderline records
! must be brought up to convincingly
| satisfactory standards if the stu
dents wish to remain in school," Dr.
Cowdery commented, "and that the
satisfactory records of other students
1 must be maintained, to take advan
tage of the opportunity that the
Navy lias given the reserve stu
dents."
At the end of last quarter some
105 freshmen living in Encina were
placed on probation. This amounts
to one man in everv four.
