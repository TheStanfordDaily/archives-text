## Language Forum Set For Tonight 
### 
A forum on the subject "Language
and International Understanding"
will be held tonight in the School of
Education Auditorium at 7:30.
This forum is the first in a series
conducted by the School of Humani
ties on the general topic "Construc
tive Forces in a Chaotic World," and
will attempt to provide several pos
sible answers to the problem of co
operation and mutual understanding
in a postwar world.
The speakers, selected for then
interest in language, their interna
tional understanding, and their spe
cific information about certain re
gions, will be Ralph H. Lutz. Ronald
Hilton, Schau Wing Chan, and Ray
mond D. Harriman.
Difficulties
"At the present time mutual un
derstanding among the peoples of
the world is difficult because of their
inability to understand each other's
language. Each speaker may be re
garded as sampling a certain terri
tory which must be explored more
fully before the entire language situ
ation is clarified," said Professor B.
Q. Morgan, chairman of the forum.
Professor Lutz will discuss the
problem of the multi-languaged con
tinent of Europe, where a compara
tively small area is bristling with a
diversity of languages. Ronald Hil
ton will present the situation in Latin
America, where, although most of
the people speak Spanish, a number
of different forms, such as Castillian
and South American, are used. Shau
Wing Chan will speak about the
place and importance of the Chinese
language when China becomes one
of the bulwarks in the postwar
world.
Code Language
Raymond D. Harriman will intro
duce the possibilities of an interna
tional auxiliary language. In con
nection with the formulating of a
kind of code which would be easy
for everyone to learn, he will dis
cuss the disadvantages of Esperanto
which is based primarily upon Latin
roots and is entirely alien to Asiatic
peoples.
The series, the remainder of which
will be announced at a later date, are
conducted entirely in the spirit of
finding an answer to the problems
discussed. "The forums will not
present historical views which lead
to nowhere, and there will be no
analysis for the sake of analysis,"
said B. Q. Morgan of the Germanic
Language Department.
