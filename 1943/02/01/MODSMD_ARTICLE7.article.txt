# Lil' Indian Finds Mud Lake
## 
### 
Saturday morning the Lil' In
jun, who has been selling frog
legs for wampum, awoke with a
start in his anti-freeze tent to
notice that there were almost no
clouds in the sky. After recover
ing from the fact that he wasn't
entirely frozen by the early
morning air, the Lil' Injun ob
served that the birds were sing
ing and the bees were humming.
This was too much and the
thought of beautiful Lake Lagu
nita sprang into his mind.
After several minutes of patri
otic walking, Lil' Injun was
standing on the edge of what his
memory told him should have
been a clear blue shimmering
lake. However, although the

water was muddy, the lake was
full of water and wild life, spring
was here, and the Lil' Injun was
happy.
On Sunday Lil' Injun returned
to his muddy but beautiful lake
and found many members of his
tribe also enjoying the sun. Some
of the stronger and braver mem
bers actually attempted to ignore
the mud and swim, but Li]' Injun
felt the water with his toe and
said "Not for me!"
Lil' Injun was assured by the
people who should know that the
lake would be a beautiful blue
again in about a week and that if
the fraternities and sororities
wanted to bring out their canoes,
etc., Stanford might be able to
have a quick spring.
