posed change is accepted by the
women students.
"We have argued enough about
the theory of the change," Miss Wal
lace commented. "Now we must get
something concrete to present to the
houses."
The sponsors originally proposed

their charters, that there be no more
rushing or pledging, that the Uni

occupied by sororities and assume
any obligations thereby entailed.

in the controversial situation, sine*
they have been closest to the rush

"We ultimately hope the decision
will be made by a vote of womei
students," said Miss Wallace, "sine*,
it should be decided by them.
Meanwhile, Palo Alto alumnae

occupied by sororities and assume
any obligations thereby entailed.
