# Pan-Hell Appoints Group To Study Sorority Plan; Griffin Named Chairman
## Sponsors Cooperate With House Presidents to Formulate System; Women Will Eventually Decide 
### Jane Glasson 
To organize a concrete plan from the suggestions offered sororities b\
the Roble sponsors last Thursday night that they voluntarily abolish them
selves from the Stanford campus, Pan-Hellenic Council is appointing a
committee of 12 girls to study the possibilities of such a move.
Betty Griffin, Alpha Phi and vice-president of Pan-Hell, was named

chairman of the committee by Presi
dent Hank Wallace, Theta. Remain
der of the group, to be composed of
six house presidents and six spon
sors, will be appointed today.
"After the meeting TTuirsdav,
nothing remained but for Pan-Hel!
to take over the problem," said Miss
Wallace, "since the ultimate answer
must come from the sororities."
Specific Plan
The committee will attempt to
work out a specific plan for the
transitional period of changing from
sorority to hall organizations, to be
put into effect if the sponsors' pro -
posed change is accepted by the
women students.
"We have argued enough about
the theory of the change," Miss Wal
lace commented. "Now we must get
something concrete to present to the
houses."
The sponsors originally proposed
that the sororities voluntarily return
their charters, that there be no more
rushing or pledging, that the Uni
versity take over the houses now
occupied by sororities and assume
any obligations thereby entailed.
.Meeting Thursday
After the committee has formu
lated its plans, they will be present
ed at another meeting of sponsors
and sorority representatives, tenta
tively scheduled for Thursday night.
Tuesday and Wednesday nights
sponsors will visit houses that wan
them to further explain their stand
in the controversial situation, sine*
they have been closest to the rush
ing effects in Roble.
"We ultimately hope the decision
will be made by a vote of womei
students," said Miss Wallace, "sine*,
it should be decided by them.
Meanwhile, Palo Alto alumnae
the nine Greek letter chapters or
ganized over the weekend anc
agreed that they would not use high
pressure methods to influence Stan
ford students, but they expresses
the hope that no hurried decision
would be made under emotiona
stress.
