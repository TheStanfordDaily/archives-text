LONDON, Feb. 2 (U.R)â€” Prime
Minister Churchill and British mili
tary and diplomatic leadei's con
ferred Saturday and Sunday with
high officials of neutral Turkey,
reaching new agreements less than
a week after the Casablanca con
ference, it was announced today.
The general belief here was that
the conference might have vital re
sults on the future of the European
phase of the war, perhaps leading to
an agreement whereby Turkey
would guard the Allied right flank
in the Mediterranean.
The meeting was held at Adana on
the southern coast of Turkey near
the island of Cyprus.
A British Ministry of Information
communique announcing the Turk
ish meeting said that Stalin had been
informed of it and that the results
were being forwarded both to the
Soviet leader and to President
Fioosevelt.
Among those with whom Church
ill met was the Turkish President,
Ismet Inonu, and Premier Sukru
Saracoglu.
The announcement said that
Churchill went to Turkey at his own
request and that "on all principal
points an identity of view was es
tablished."
Agreement was reached on the
manner in which Great Britain and
the United States materially would
be able to help Turkey consolidate
her own general defensive security.
"I haven't any doubt advantages
will come to both the British and
Turkish people by that friendship,
mutual trust, good will, and sym
pathy of understanding for each
other's difficulties which now again
are in fullest vitality," Churchill
said.
