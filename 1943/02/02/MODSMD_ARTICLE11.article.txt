I Alumnae Feeling
Repercussions from alumnae are
j still prevalent, as they feel the stu-.
i dents do not fully realize the pro
' cedure of withdrawing a charter.
According to Mrs. Margaret
Younger, president of the Alumnae
i Pan-Hellenic Advisory Council, the
J original granting of a charter to a
, group is a dignified procedure of
agreement between the national
| Greek letter organization and the
, University administration.
Withdrawal of the charter is gov
erned by the same procedure, since
| the local groups can only ask tht
j national to consider their reason
i for wishing to withdraw, the final
! decision resting with the University
administration and the national.
Grounds for Expulsion
Mrs. Younger also emphasized
that active advocation for abolitioi
of a sorority by any of its member
was grounds for expulsion from th
sorority. And even though all mem
bers of a chapter resigned then
membership, the chapter charter
would still remain.
"How students live should be ar
administrative policy," Mrs. Younge
stated. "College community livir.
depends on university plans create
over a long period of years."
Another mass meeting of sorori'-
representatives and sponsors will l\
held later in the week.
