Wilson in Conflict
Showing Wilson in constant con
flict with the leaders of Europe, who
forced him to compromise his ideals
at'every turn, the author, Howard
Kock, has let the facts speak for
themselves and tell a compelling
story, resulting in an honest high
minded drama about a vital subject.
Highly praised by noted critics,
"In Time to Come" is considered one
of the finest plays to be given at
Stanford by Director David Sievers.
Critics' PFiiisc
Says critic John Mason Brown of
the play. "Thanks to Mr. Wilson and
history, it is a compelling story . . .
all in all, a play far more interesting
than the majority of offerings . . ."
According to Willela Waldorf,
writing for the New York Post, " 'In
Time to Come' presents Wilson's
journey to Paris and his campaign
to establish the League of Nations
in unpretentious, human fashion,
with humor and understanding.
"The war president's passionate
devotion to his ideal; his conviction
that the people, and not the politi
cians should decide the course to
pursue . . . and the ventual repudia
tion of his work by the isolationists
in his own country, make very
stimulating dramatic material now
that we find ourselves in an-

I other war to make the world safe
1 for democracy."
In the New York Journal Ameri
can, John Anderson wrote, "It makes
an absorbing . . . and genuinely ex
citing evening in the theater."
