# Astronomer To Discuss 'Sun In Action' Tonight
## 
### 
Realizing that a normal audience
must understand its science in terms
of everyday happenings, Seth B.
Nicholson, head of the Solar Divi
sion of Mount Wilson Observatory,
has developed a lecture technique
which makes him outstanding in this
field on the Pacific Coast.
Nicholson will speak tonight at the
Tuesday Evening Series on the "Sun
in Action" at 7:30 in Memorial Hall.
Coupled with illustrated slides, he
presents his material as a series of
unusual facts, such as the following:
the solar radiation which strikes the
earth each day would cost $100,000.-
000,000,000, about S5O per person at
2>2 cents per kilowatt hour; sun
spots act as refrigerators, cooling the
surface from 10,000 to about 8,000
degrees Fahrenheit, "still a long way
from ice cubes."
Nicholson was graduated from
Drake University in Des Moines,
lowa and received his Ph.D. degree
from the University of California in

1915.
He immediately entered the Mount
Wilson Observatory where his re
search work enabled him to discover
the 9th, lOlh, and 11th satellites of
| Jupiter, winning him membership in
the National Academy of Sciences.
I and the American Astronomical So
ciety.
