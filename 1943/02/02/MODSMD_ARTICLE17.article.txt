# Farm Cagers To Play Gaels Friday Night
## 
### 
One strike and you're out.
The old baseball squeeze play has
'lifted to hang around Everett Dean
nd his varsity cagers as they head
>r the big city and game with St.
lary's in San Francisco's Civic Au
itorium Friday night.
The Indians have exactly five
ames left in P.C.C. southern divi
ion play, two each with Cal and
I.C.L.A. and one with S.C. The Tro
ins have five straight, and another
efeat for either Cal or Stanford
leans end of any slight hopes.
It's not an impossibility, but it's a
ah that will take several changes,
r rather confirmation of changes, in
ndian play. These things will be
nder the microscope Friday:
Is the shooting eye of the Indian
>rward wall which pulled out of its
jthargy with Dana's victory bucket
'riday and Linari's 17-point splurge
aturday against Oakland Airbase
ermanently regained?
Is the guard situation in which
'reddie Oliver, Leo McCaffrey, and
Jones Halstead are all having it
round trying to fit in with Howie
)allmar nearer solution with the dis
overy of Halstead's talents?
Can Ernie Holbrook keep super-
Dam s steam up down south where
e has one more with Stanford and
'al and another with U.C.L.A. to
â€¢lay?
Answer (strictly ours) for num
ier one: the Indians have an eye as
hey demonstrated last year. It never
as been the problem of building
hooting prowess, but simply that of
nding the misplaced talents. They
re home.
Number two: Halstead will prob
blv share the post with Leo and
'reddie, and in a new system of
hilting guards depending on the
2elings of the particular specimen
n a particular evening, Everett
)ean may have his answer. Leo's
oolness and Bones' offense plus the
)liver speed would add up to a
)allmar partner.
And to the hoop season's 64-buck
t question, about S.C., the answer
(fill in your own opinion.)
