# Class Swimmers Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
Tomorrow afternoon the prelimi
naries for the inter-class swimming
meet will be held in the Encina
pools. Although entrees are still
being made, the frosh team looks the
strongest. With 12 men competing,
the freshmen have several men en
tered in each event.
The sophomores have such stars
as Jim Gamble and Dick Narver and
many other excellent swimmers.
The juniors have been able to enter
such names as Ted Monroe, Emmet
Cashin, and Clint Eastman. The
seniors are without the services of
Don Smith, last year's captain, and
have been unable to enter a very
large team.
The finals of the inter-class meet
will be held Thursday afternoon.
