THURSDAY Uncle Sam's taking me to teach
me something about tanks and guns and all
the other things that come under the heading
of the Army and War. It is only natural for me,
then, to seriously consider a very serious fu
ture. Nevertheless, I am sure that it is of even
greater importance to think of the past. I'm
thinking especially about the last six months
and what these six months of college have
meant to me. If one is to realize the most of his
college experience, perhaps the most formu
lative phase of one's life, he should not be
afraid nor merely passive about this subject.
College has been especially meaningful to
me, because I was going to school while a
world war was being fought. An era of war
means an increased stress and quantity of na
tional doctrines which ordinarily are taken for
granted. Like the rest of the country I have been
subjected to this increased pressure, but unlike
most of the country, I was going to school and
was being taught to think. I was taught to be
skeptical, and, sometimes, I became extremely
and distastefully cynical.
During these months in college, our leaders
told me, as they told you, that this country was
lighting for its life, and for its way of life—De
mocracy. I didn't seriously quarrel with the
first, but some things made me unsure of De
mocracy. I felt this way, because at a time,
when I believed I was learning to appreciate
the art of thinking, I became aware that the
masses' emotions were receiving unlimited ex
ploitation in this country. It seemed that per
haps Democracy latently existed for the pur
pose of persuading people to agree with you,
and to take certain actions, not by forcing them,
but by "educating" them the wrong way. As
one of the history men around here, quoting
someone, said to me: "All education is propa
ganda: all propaganda is not education."
That to me, signified a basic and an honest
criticism of Democracy. Yet, I didn't want to be
bitter because things weren't as perfect as I
had once dreamed. I didn't believe that this
alone should make me close my eyes to De
mocracy. I asked myself: In the first place,
what do I mean, what does anyone mean, by
Democracy. I have seen and heard a lot of ideas
about the concept of Democracy, but only one
remains with me as ideal and practical. This is
the only kind of Democracy I would accept to
be of any ultimate value: "A Democracy is a
society whose citizens are liberally educated."
This means that Democracy is not instituted
so that its people can become liberally edu
cated. If it did, I frankly and unavoidably would
recognize, as I do recognize, that there exists
no nation in the world which would absolutely
satisfy that concept. I see that outside of a lot of
university people, and a few others with nat
ural vision, that this country is not liberally
educated.
I regard liberal education as something that
is instituted and developed so that its people
will be able to create and strengthen a Democ
racy. People, so minded, desire a Democracy
in order to gain freedom and equality which
seem to the individual to be the Democratic

symptoms. Unless, however, the people are
liberally educated, freedom and equality in
their fundamental political, social, and economic
senses, do not exist.
It is necessary to ask what a liberal educa
tion implies; what will it do to improve a people;
what it will do to create a Democracy? Well,
if it is to signify anything for a better, a happier,
a freer world, which obviously is a universal
ideal, it can mean nothing else for this than an
understanding of the vital problems and the
causes of these problems which restrain the
freedom and equality of most of mankind.
I'm not suggesting any Utopian plan to
remedy this, for obviously enough human na
ture is difficult to change. In fact, it may never
change. I do think, though, that if given a
chance to change it could and would change.
Maybe you've felt these feelings before you
came to college. Maybe, you've gotten them
out of college, but have been wont to ignore
them. Nevertheless, these have been some of
the things I've felt, and I do not wish to forget
them.
Colleges to me do not exist only to give
knowledge for the sake of knowledge. Nor do
they exist solely for the sake of good times
which I shall not hypocritically try to denounce.
They do exist, above all, to give knowledge to
teach us how to think for the sake of a higher
plane of equal understanding.

(Someone, after reading a couple of pages
of this, asked me whether I was a Republican,
New Dealer, or Communist. I shook my head,
and was ready to open my mouth when Ted
Norton of the Daily staff placed me beautifully.
Ted said, "Like me, he's a confused liberal!")
