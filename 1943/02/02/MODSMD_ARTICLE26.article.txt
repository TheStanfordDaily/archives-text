•"TODAY will probably be very much like
-L most other days. It will probably be cloudy
and cold and wintery and Stanford will rise and
rub the sleep from its collective eyes and
stumble off to its 8 o'clocks.
However, for one among us it will be very
different. Today the civilian life and college
career stop and the Army life of Ray Hayes, '46,
Daily reporter starts.
This doesn't mean much. Lots of young
men are going in the Army today but we like
Ray Hayes and in our simple way we are trying
to show it.
So today's Daily is his. He has been the' ed
itor—written the editorials and edited the news.
