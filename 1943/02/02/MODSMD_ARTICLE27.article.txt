The Editor, Sir:
Only a sorority woman, having her share of
the "frosting," could write the letter that Miss
Eve Pleasant, A.O.Pi, contributed yesterday.
Her arguments apply beautifully to Stanford
men; there are enough fraternities to take in
any would-be brother and of the men who live
in the halls usually do so from choice. But there
aren't enough sororities who even pretend to
take care of the Row-inclined women.
To be blunt, sorority membership, to many,
not all, girls entering college, looks like the
most important thing in the world. Not to
pledge, although there be nothing personal in
it, is crushing to some of them. The implication
is that they are in some way inferior; a slap in
the face would be kinder. It is a compliment
to the good sense of Stanford women in general,
that they realize that the cake is the important
thing, after all; that is to say, that Stanford is
more important than a sorority.
Now Stanford is run on presumably demo
cratic principles. To set up artificial and in
vidious standards in such a way as to hurt those
left out on a purely arbitrary basis, is contrary
to that spirit. The sorority system as it exists
today, is contrary to Stanford principles.
