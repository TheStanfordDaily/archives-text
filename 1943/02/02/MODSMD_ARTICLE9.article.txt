# HIGH SCHOOL
## Students Want Their Diplomas 
### 
The fathers of four Stanford stu
dents last Friday night protested the
refusal of the San Mateo District
School Board to grant diplomas to
students leaving high school to enter
Stanford without completing their
senior year.
Under the University's plan to
speed up education during the war,
high school students were admitted
this quarter without a diploma after
completing only three months of
senior work provided they passed
the aptitude test satisfactorily and
their high school grades were suffi
ciently high.
Some boards throughout the state
have seen fit to give these seniors
their diplomas on passing one quar
ter, while other boards have granted
diplomas on seeing the student suc
cessfully enrolled. The San Mateo
District Board in their last meeting
decided to give students in good
standing their high school diplomas
on entering the armed services, but
they have not yet reached a decision
in connection with seniors leaving
school for college.
