With 25 offices to be filled at the

tivity has begun a revival that

nations on Monday, declinations

tion on Wednesday of next week.
Although a "B" election would
normally have been held last
quarter, it is being combined with
the regular "A" election this time
to get the new system into opera

' Since no one can be sure
whether he will be able to re
main in school to serve his term
of office, no restrictions have been
made regarding the service status
of candidates," Bud Ambrose,
chairman of election board stated.
