## Nicholson Tells Of Sun Spots 
### 
Describing the nature and effect
if sun spots, Seth B. Nicholson, head
if the Solar Division of Mt. Wilson
on Observatory, told a Tuesday
Svening Series audience last night
hat sun spots cover an average of
me-half of 1 per cent of the sun's j
surface, and probably have little or j
10 effect on the earth's weather.
However, he emphasized that !
nuch remained to be studied con- j
:erning sun spots and that evidence I
nay later refute this theory.
Speaking with the aid of photo- j
graphic slides, Nicholson declared j
hat sun spots vary in quantity and j
:ome and go in 11-year cycles. At |
heir latest, peak, in 1938. an average
if 12 spots were seen daily while j
:his year, only two or three are seen |
?ach day, on an average.
The average life of sun spots is i
approximately two weeks. These
-pots rotate around the sun, taking ;
about two weeks to make n rotation.
Sun spots, stated Nicholson, are
composed of gaseous matter which
is continually expanding, at the same
time cooling the area surrounding
them. They act as refrigerators, and
cool gases from 10,000 degrees to
8.000 degrees, but this is "far from
making ice cubeg."
Nicholson has been at the Mount
Wilson Observatory since 1915, and
there his research work has enabled
him to discover the 9th. 10th. and
11th satellites of Jupiter, winning
him membership in the National
Academy of Sciences, and the Amer
ican Astronomical Society.
