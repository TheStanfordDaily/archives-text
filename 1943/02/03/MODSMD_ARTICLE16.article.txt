# SORORITIES
## Pan-Hell Committee to Form Two Plans to Eliminate Evils 
### 
Deciding to work out two complete plans, which in their judgment could
help solve the current sorority issue, the Pan-Hellenic-appointed commit
tee of 14 Hall and Row girls met yesterday to form definite answers to the
Roble Sponsors' challenge that the evils of the Stanford sorority system
must be eliminated.
Two plans will be formulated: One, to better the sorority system as it

now stands; the other, to completely 4
do away with Greek letter chapters I
and place Stanford entirely on the j
dormitory basis.
This same committee will continue
to meet every afternoon until their j
plans are in sufficient state to pre- !
sent to all women students con
cerned.
Until this time, a general meeting
will not be held, and the sponsors, j
scheduled to speak to the individual
sorority houses last night and to- j
night, have canceled their visits.
The sponsors, who were asked by ;
the sororities to present their plan
before all the girls in each house,
requested that their visits be post
poned until such time as the com
mittee had concluded their research,
providing them with specific facts
and answers to questions the sorori
ties might ask.
Members of the committee from
the Row are: Malla Mack, Pi Phi,
Mary Dennis, Theta, Dorothy Sup
piger, Gamma Phi, Marcella Ma
honey, Kappa, Helen Knight. Delta
Gamma, and Pat Palmer, Tri-Delta.
Sponsors are: Bobbie Sadler.
Nancy Summerfield, Rosemary
Goodwin. Barbara Clausen, Vir
ginia Kirkland, Bea Mac Donald, and
Mary Ann Walker.
