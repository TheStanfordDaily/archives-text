# WHO PAYS OUR STANFORD EDUCATION?
## 
### 
There are few people these days
that can deny that Stanford is one
id the nation's top-ranking univer- ,
sities. Stanford has a faculty, the
physical plant, the libraries, the
students which are all part of a
great educational institution. At this
point, however, someone almost in
evitably asks, "Bui does Stanford
have the money?"
For, despite the aura of financial
invincibility which has wreathed
Stanford since its inception, students
at the University in the last decade
or two have taken the attitude that
Stanford is trying to squeeze them
for "all that the tariff can carry."
Economic Burden
Even parents, the Papas who pay,
have often wondered whether the
economic burden of sending young
men and women to a private insti
tution such as Stanford instead of a
state university is worth their while.
Yet it is the fact that Stanford is a
private university which makes it,
in purely economic terms, very much
worth while, for at Stanford the
student gets over twice his money's
worth.
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
broke ground for a university in
1887 with an idea, a memory, and
something like 22 million dollars.
The idea was to build a great school
where the winds of Freedom would
blow. It was to be a gift, some little
repayment, to the West and to Na
tion which had treated them so well.

The memory was to their son. Le
land Junior, who had died at the
age of hi. It was to the fulfillment in
other young men of Leland Junior's
unfulfilled promise that the Univer
sity was dedicated and eventually
named. The 22 million dollars were
the funds which were to give the
school its solid start. To the Vic
torian this money spelled "security."
Financial Reputation
It was from this original and
then fabulous endowment that the
University came to have its repu
tation of financial solidity; and it
was because of this endowment that
the first four classes to enter the
University had no yearly fees to pay.
This was a lavish era, an era in
which young men and women with
intelligence could get their educa
tion for almost nothing and could
then go out into the big, bright
world and make their fortunes and
lives amount to almost anything
they wished. It was an era in which
men like Herbert Hoover flourished.
But time, pacing on unknowably,
brought change. Right up through
the year 1915 the yearly fee for a
Stanford education was only $40, but
the World War wrought havoc with
the world's economy, and the young
men who had left Stanford at the
end of 1915 to join the Allies came
back to finish their education in 1920
only to find that the yearly fee for a
Stanford education had jumped to
$180. Not so much, one might say.

but a long raise from $40 a year. It
was then that the necessity for ad
dition to the original Stanford en
dowment became obvious.
Funds Raised
The rest of the financial story is
well known. Funds were raised, but
often tluy were not quite enough.
And therefore the tuition fee had to
be increased until today an aca
demic year at Stanford costs $429.
That sounds like and is a lot of
money. But that is not the most
interesting part of the story. The
most interesting and most important
circumstance concerning the Stan
lord student is that this $429 pays
only 48 per cent of what it. costs to
educate him for one academic year.
Tuition Raised
In other words, despite the fact
that tuition has risen and despite
the fact that educational costs have
soared to tremendously high levels
in comparison to what they were 50
years ago, over half of a student's
education is paid for by the money
1 of others. The question is, "Who are
these other people?"
First, of course, came the Stan
fords. The hundreds of thousands
of shares of Southern Pacific Rail
way stocks and bonds furnished the
nucleus for the University's endow
ment. This money, spread over a
much wider income area today, still
is the University's financial back
bone. But since the last war, many
more people, over 18,000 in fact, have

given money to Stanford so that
the University might continue to
give its students the wisdom of edu
cation.
Many Donors
A great number of these people
are Stanford men and women who,
having made their marks in life,
have felt that they owed something
to an institution which game them
their education at comparatively
little expense. Many of these donors
to the University are people who
believe that Stanford University is
a worthwhile object of philanthropy
because it helps produce scholarly
and high-minded leaders at no ex
pense to the citizens of California—
that it is, in fact, a gift to the state
and nation. And there are many who
feel that the work being done in
Stanford's laboratories and libraries
is vital enough .so that it must, un
der any circumstance, be carried on.
Even the student who contributes
his dime to "Dimes for Diplomas" is
aiding some future Stanford stu
dent's education.
In all this the University's Ad
ministration merely acts as a sort of
agent. On,the one side are a large
number of people wishing to give
promising young men and women
| an opportunity to get a university
I education; on the other side are the
promising young men and women,
| the raw material of the process. It
is up to the Administration to set the
j standard for "promising," to obtain

and maintain the 'acuity and phys
cal plant lor a university, and, abo\
all, to bring money and promise t
gether so that at the end of lour i
six years these young men ai
women may have the knowledge 1
which they can most usefully bent
lit their society and themselves. T1
Administration acts as the cataU
for two groups which, powerless
themselves, can be brought togeth
so as to develop a good and powe
ful new substance.

In this work Stanford's Admini
t rat ion has spent an average of $1.5
per student since the University b

and gone down Palm Drive sin
1891. A little simple arithmetic w
i show that the University has spe
75 million dollars on its studei

In other words, despite the fact
that tuition has risen and despite
the fact that educational costs have
soared to tremendously high levels
in comparison to what they were 50
years ago, over half of a student's
education is paid for by the money
1 of others. The question is, "Who are
these other people?"
First, of course, came the Stan
fords. The hundreds of thousands
of shares of Southern Pacific Rail
way stocks and bonds furnished the
nucleus for the University's endow
ment. This money, spread over a
much wider income area today, still
is the University's financial back
bone. But since the last war, many
more people, over 18,000 in fact, have

given money to Stanford so that
the University might continue to
give its students the wisdom of edu
cation.
Many Donors
A great number of these people
are Stanford men and women who,
having made their marks in life,
have felt that they owed something
to an institution which game them
their education at comparatively
little expense. Many of these donors
to the University are people who
believe that Stanford University is
a worthwhile object of philanthropy
because it helps produce scholarly
and high-minded leaders at no ex
pense to the citizens of California—
that it is, in fact, a gift to the state
and nation. And there are many who
feel that the work being done in
Stanford's laboratories and libraries
is vital enough .so that it must, un
der any circumstance, be carried on.
Even the student who contributes
his dime to "Dimes for Diplomas" is
aiding some future Stanford stu
dent's education.
In all this the University's Ad
ministration merely acts as a sort of
agent. On,the one side are a large
number of people wishing to give
promising young men and women
| an opportunity to get a university
I education; on the other side are the
promising young men and women,
| the raw material of the process. It
is up to the Administration to set the
j standard for "promising," to obtain

and maintain the 'acuity and phys
cal plant lor a university, and, abo\
all, to bring money and promise t
gether so that at the end of lour i

There are few people these days
that can deny that Stanford is one
id the nation's top-ranking univer- ,
sities. Stanford has a faculty, the
physical plant, the libraries, the
students which are all part of a
great educational institution. At this
point, however, someone almost in
evitably asks, "Bui does Stanford
have the money?"
For, despite the aura of financial
invincibility which has wreathed
Stanford since its inception, students
at the University in the last decade
or two have taken the attitude that
Stanford is trying to squeeze them
for "all that the tariff can carry."
Economic Burden
Even parents, the Papas who pay,
have often wondered whether the
economic burden of sending young
men and women to a private insti
tution such as Stanford instead of a
state university is worth their while.
Yet it is the fact that Stanford is a
private university which makes it,
in purely economic terms, very much
worth while, for at Stanford the
student gets over twice his money's
worth.
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
broke ground for a university in
1887 with an idea, a memory, and
something like 22 million dollars.
The idea was to build a great school
where the winds of Freedom would
blow. It was to be a gift, some little
repayment, to the West and to Na
tion which had treated them so well.

The memory was to their son. Le
land Junior, who had died at the
age of hi. It was to the fulfillment in
other young men of Leland Junior's
unfulfilled promise that the Univer
sity was dedicated and eventually
named. The 22 million dollars were
the funds which were to give the
school its solid start. To the Vic
torian this money spelled "security."
Financial Reputation
It was from this original and
then fabulous endowment that the
University came to have its repu
tation of financial solidity; and it
was because of this endowment that
the first four classes to enter the
University had no yearly fees to pay.
This was a lavish era, an era in
which young men and women with
intelligence could get their educa
tion for almost nothing and could
then go out into the big, bright
world and make their fortunes and
lives amount to almost anything
they wished. It was an era in which
men like Herbert Hoover flourished.
But time, pacing on unknowably,
brought change. Right up through
the year 1915 the yearly fee for a
Stanford education was only $40, but
the World War wrought havoc with
the world's economy, and the young
men who had left Stanford at the
end of 1915 to join the Allies came
back to finish their education in 1920
only to find that the yearly fee for a
Stanford education had jumped to
$180. Not so much, one might say.

but a long raise from $40 a year. It
was then that the necessity for ad
dition to the original Stanford en
dowment became obvious.
Funds Raised
The rest of the financial story is
well known. Funds were raised, but
often tluy were not quite enough.
And therefore the tuition fee had to
be increased until today an aca
demic year at Stanford costs $429.
That sounds like and is a lot of
money. But that is not the most
interesting part of the story. The
most interesting and most important
circumstance concerning the Stan
lord student is that this $429 pays
only 48 per cent of what it. costs to
educate him for one academic year.

id the nation's top-ranking univer- ,
sities. Stanford has a faculty, the
physical plant, the libraries, the
students which are all part of a
great educational institution. At this
point, however, someone almost in
evitably asks, "Bui does Stanford
have the money?"
For, despite the aura of financial
invincibility which has wreathed
Stanford since its inception, students
at the University in the last decade
or two have taken the attitude that
Stanford is trying to squeeze them
for "all that the tariff can carry."
Economic Burden
Even parents, the Papas who pay,
have often wondered whether the
economic burden of sending young
men and women to a private insti
tution such as Stanford instead of a
state university is worth their while.
Yet it is the fact that Stanford is a
private university which makes it,
in purely economic terms, very much
worth while, for at Stanford the
student gets over twice his money's
worth.
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
broke ground for a university in
1887 with an idea, a memory, and
something like 22 million dollars.
The idea was to build a great school
where the winds of Freedom would
blow. It was to be a gift, some little
repayment, to the West and to Na
tion which had treated them so well.

The memory was to their son. Le
land Junior, who had died at the
age of hi. It was to the fulfillment in
other young men of Leland Junior's
unfulfilled promise that the Univer
sity was dedicated and eventually
named. The 22 million dollars were
the funds which were to give the
school its solid start. To the Vic
torian this money spelled "security."
Financial Reputation
It was from this original and
then fabulous endowment that the
University came to have its repu
tation of financial solidity; and it
was because of this endowment that
the first four classes to enter the
University had no yearly fees to pay.
This was a lavish era, an era in
which young men and women with
intelligence could get their educa
tion for almost nothing and could
then go out into the big, bright
world and make their fortunes and
lives amount to almost anything
they wished. It was an era in which
men like Herbert Hoover flourished.
But time, pacing on unknowably,
brought change. Right up through
the year 1915 the yearly fee for a
Stanford education was only $40, but
the World War wrought havoc with
the world's economy, and the young
men who had left Stanford at the
end of 1915 to join the Allies came
back to finish their education in 1920
only to find that the yearly fee for a
Stanford education had jumped to
$180. Not so much, one might say.

but a long raise from $40 a year. It
was then that the necessity for ad
dition to the original Stanford en
dowment became obvious.
Funds Raised
The rest of the financial story is
well known. Funds were raised, but
often tluy were not quite enough.
And therefore the tuition fee had to
be increased until today an aca
demic year at Stanford costs $429.
That sounds like and is a lot of
money. But that is not the most
interesting part of the story. The
most interesting and most important
circumstance concerning the Stan
lord student is that this $429 pays
only 48 per cent of what it. costs to
educate him for one academic year.
Tuition Raised
In other words, despite the fact
that tuition has risen and despite
the fact that educational costs have
soared to tremendously high levels
in comparison to what they were 50
years ago, over half of a student's
education is paid for by the money
1 of others. The question is, "Who are
these other people?"
First, of course, came the Stan
fords. The hundreds of thousands
of shares of Southern Pacific Rail
way stocks and bonds furnished the
nucleus for the University's endow
ment. This money, spread over a
much wider income area today, still
is the University's financial back
bone. But since the last war, many
more people, over 18,000 in fact, have

given money to Stanford so that
the University might continue to
give its students the wisdom of edu
cation.
Many Donors
A great number of these people
are Stanford men and women who,
having made their marks in life,
have felt that they owed something
to an institution which game them
their education at comparatively
little expense. Many of these donors
to the University are people who
believe that Stanford University is
a worthwhile object of philanthropy
because it helps produce scholarly
and high-minded leaders at no ex
pense to the citizens of California—
that it is, in fact, a gift to the state
and nation. And there are many who
feel that the work being done in
Stanford's laboratories and libraries
is vital enough .so that it must, un
der any circumstance, be carried on.
Even the student who contributes
his dime to "Dimes for Diplomas" is
aiding some future Stanford stu
dent's education.
In all this the University's Ad
ministration merely acts as a sort of
agent. On,the one side are a large
number of people wishing to give
promising young men and women
| an opportunity to get a university
I education; on the other side are the
promising young men and women,
| the raw material of the process. It
is up to the Administration to set the
j standard for "promising," to obtain

and maintain the 'acuity and phys
cal plant lor a university, and, abo\
all, to bring money and promise t
gether so that at the end of lour i
six years these young men ai
women may have the knowledge 1

Administration acts as the cataU

so as to develop a good and powe
ful new substance.

the fact that educational costs have
soared to tremendously high levels
in comparison to what they were 50
years ago, over half of a student's
education is paid for by the money
1 of others. The question is, "Who are
these other people?"
First, of course, came the Stan
fords. The hundreds of thousands
of shares of Southern Pacific Rail
way stocks and bonds furnished the
nucleus for the University's endow
ment. This money, spread over a
much wider income area today, still
is the University's financial back
bone. But since the last war, many
more people, over 18,000 in fact, have

given money to Stanford so that
the University might continue to
give its students the wisdom of edu
cation.
Many Donors
A great number of these people
are Stanford men and women who,
having made their marks in life,
have felt that they owed something
to an institution which game them
their education at comparatively
little expense. Many of these donors
to the University are people who
believe that Stanford University is
a worthwhile object of philanthropy
because it helps produce scholarly
and high-minded leaders at no ex
pense to the citizens of California—
that it is, in fact, a gift to the state
and nation. And there are many who
feel that the work being done in
Stanford's laboratories and libraries
is vital enough .so that it must, un
der any circumstance, be carried on.
Even the student who contributes
his dime to "Dimes for Diplomas" is
aiding some future Stanford stu
dent's education.
In all this the University's Ad
ministration merely acts as a sort of
agent. On,the one side are a large
number of people wishing to give
promising young men and women
| an opportunity to get a university
I education; on the other side are the
promising young men and women,
| the raw material of the process. It
is up to the Administration to set the
j standard for "promising," to obtain

and maintain the 'acuity and phys
cal plant lor a university, and, abo\
all, to bring money and promise t
gether so that at the end of lour i
six years these young men ai
women may have the knowledge 1

There are few people these days
that can deny that Stanford is one
id the nation's top-ranking univer- ,
sities. Stanford has a faculty, the
physical plant, the libraries, the
students which are all part of a
great educational institution. At this
point, however, someone almost in
evitably asks, "Bui does Stanford
have the money?"
For, despite the aura of financial
invincibility which has wreathed
Stanford since its inception, students
at the University in the last decade
or two have taken the attitude that
Stanford is trying to squeeze them
for "all that the tariff can carry."
Economic Burden
Even parents, the Papas who pay,
have often wondered whether the
economic burden of sending young
men and women to a private insti
tution such as Stanford instead of a
state university is worth their while.
Yet it is the fact that Stanford is a
private university which makes it,
in purely economic terms, very much
worth while, for at Stanford the
student gets over twice his money's
worth.
Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford
broke ground for a university in
1887 with an idea, a memory, and
something like 22 million dollars.
The idea was to build a great school
where the winds of Freedom would
blow. It was to be a gift, some little
repayment, to the West and to Na
tion which had treated them so well.

The memory was to their son. Le
land Junior, who had died at the
age of hi. It was to the fulfillment in
other young men of Leland Junior's
unfulfilled promise that the Univer
sity was dedicated and eventually
named. The 22 million dollars were
the funds which were to give the
school its solid start. To the Vic
torian this money spelled "security."
Financial Reputation
It was from this original and
then fabulous endowment that the
University came to have its repu
tation of financial solidity; and it
was because of this endowment that
the first four classes to enter the
University had no yearly fees to pay.
This was a lavish era, an era in
which young men and women with
intelligence could get their educa
tion for almost nothing and could
then go out into the big, bright
world and make their fortunes and
lives amount to almost anything
they wished. It was an era in which
men like Herbert Hoover flourished.
But time, pacing on unknowably,
brought change. Right up through
the year 1915 the yearly fee for a
Stanford education was only $40, but
the World War wrought havoc with
the world's economy, and the young
men who had left Stanford at the
end of 1915 to join the Allies came
back to finish their education in 1920
only to find that the yearly fee for a
Stanford education had jumped to
$180. Not so much, one might say.

but a long raise from $40 a year. It
was then that the necessity for ad
dition to the original Stanford en
dowment became obvious.
Funds Raised
The rest of the financial story is
well known. Funds were raised, but
often tluy were not quite enough.
And therefore the tuition fee had to
be increased until today an aca
demic year at Stanford costs $429.
That sounds like and is a lot of
money. But that is not the most
interesting part of the story. The
most interesting and most important
circumstance concerning the Stan
lord student is that this $429 pays
only 48 per cent of what it. costs to
educate him for one academic year.
