# Food Institute Study Reports U.S. Wheat Supply Adequate
## 
### 
The stocks of wheat in the world
today are the largest in history, ac
cording to the recent "Wheat Stud
ies" issued by the Food Research
Institute.
"The huge supplies of 1841-42
were large enough to provide am
ply for domestic utilization for fully
two years and five months and still
leave stocks at a normal year-end
level.
"Or," according to the Institute,
"they were large enough to provide
for a normal vear's domestic utili

zation and year-end stocks, and in
addition to supply the importing
countries of the world with three
times as much wheat as they had
absorbed from the major exporters
in any of the five crop years preced
ing the war."
This was caused by the curtailing
of imports due to the war, to excep
tionally good yields per acre in
1939-40-41, and to government poli
cies.
I In the United States these policies
"were aimed at holding wheat prices
at levels higher than the supply po
! sition justified.
Although the wheat reserves are
at an all-time high, the Institute re
i ported, they are concentrated in the
j four major wheat-producing coun
| tries, Australia, Argentina, Canada,
and the United States (the Russian
' wheat-producing area being con
' quered by the Nazis).
Wheat, primarily in the form of
j flour, was shipped to Britain and
I to Brazil. Due to the shipping situ
; ation, the English wheat was token
primarily from Canada, and the Bra
! zilian from Argentina.
