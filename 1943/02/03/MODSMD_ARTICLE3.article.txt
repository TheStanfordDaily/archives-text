# "MATCHES, SCRAPPY, SERIOUS"-MALONEY
## 
### 
In the 32 years that he has
watched Stanford men climb through
the ropes Harry Maloney has never
seen a scrappier, more serious bunch
than those who have made war
time 1943 the biggest year in Farm
boxing history.
About 280 men have enrolled in
the gym classes in boxing taught by
Maloney and his assistant, Vic Lind
skog. Another 60 have entered the
Novice and All-U boxing tourna
ments which will end tomorrow
night.
War Affects
Using what "a Phi Beta Kappa
might call fortitude but what we all
know is plain guts," the new boxers
and the old ones have been strongly
affected by the war and its demands
for physical training. But in their
efforts, the stocky, gentlemanly Ma
loney sees other things which he
has- trained himself to notice over
years of association with Stanford
men. -
These things are perhaps best
summed up in the qualifications
which Maloney requires lor the
winner of one of the Farm's famous
Gene Tunney medals.
Athletic Coach at the growing Farm,

Maloney went into the service in
1914. There in the course of his
wanderings as an army physical in
structor he met a young Marine
private. Their common interest in
boxing drew them together, and at
one time Maloney even told his
friend that he should not enter the
professional ring.
But Gene Tunney had a goal, and
he pounded his way to it. Then he
left the ring, intact, with an ambi
tion achieved. He never tried the
often-fatal "road back" that ftas been
tragic for many boxers.
Irish Logic
Perhaps his decision was affected
by the Irish logic of Harry Maloney.
At any rate in 1927 Tunney insti
tuted at Stanford a series of medals
to be awarded by Maloney every
year to outstanding boxers.
Since that time Stanford's director
of minor sports has picked his men;
he used a point system, and he gives
j boxing 10 points.
Stanford Spirit
But he also gives the same num
i ber of points for scholarship, leader
ship, attitude, and other things that
make up something that Maloney is
intensely proud of—Stanford spirit.

I The medals became Stanford's ;
most desired sports award, the only j
' one that Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur sees fit to deliver personally, j
year in and year out.
Men That Learn
And Maloney sizes up the men
that learn a left hook from him or ■
those who drop in to look at his
sports photo gallery by the Tunney
standards.
Hundreds of boxers have met
them. J. Donovan Fiint, 1917, still
sends back an award medal every
year out of regard for his mentor, j
Fred Glover, Phi Bete, student body
president, and now ;i Naval Intelli
gence officer is a favorite.
Into the country's coaching circles I
Maloney sent Myron Schall, now |
Cal Aggie coach and Dewitt Portell.
San Jose ring leader. Stubby Stoltz, '
former head of Stanford's School of
Health, left Maloney s area to go as
i a Rhodes Scholar to Oxford where
he won the biggest match of his life
: against Cambridge.
Lately there was Johnny Ward
who won the P.C.C. title in the
heavyweight division in 15)40. Frank
Hewitt who got runner-up in the ■
welterweights last year, and Lind- ;
skog himself, one of the best college j
heavyweights in the business.
After-Stanford Live
These are only a few of the men
that Maloney can remember at the
drop of a hat, both by the impression
(hey made on him, by their records
in after-Stanford life, and by the
j myriad of pictures they send him.
Harry Maloney knows boxers and
he knows students. He has travelled
around the world with athletic teams
and on his own, and everywhere he
| has been welcomed by what he
I terms "the excellent reputation of
Stanford."
Best Class
When he says that the boys of j
194.1, both as boxers and as men of
real spirit, are the best class in his
I 112 years, it's the voice of sincere
. authority.
"You can't buy the stuff these
boys learn in the ring, and when
they get out and I notice that they
1 climb upwards in their professions.
I like to think that I and boxing
helped a little."

has- trained himself to notice over
years of association with Stanford
men. -
These things are perhaps best
summed up in the qualifications
which Maloney requires lor the
winner of one of the Farm's famous
Gene Tunney medals.
Athletic Coach at the growing Farm,

Maloney went into the service in
1914. There in the course of his
wanderings as an army physical in
structor he met a young Marine
private. Their common interest in
boxing drew them together, and at
one time Maloney even told his
friend that he should not enter the
professional ring.
But Gene Tunney had a goal, and
he pounded his way to it. Then he
left the ring, intact, with an ambi
tion achieved. He never tried the
often-fatal "road back" that ftas been
tragic for many boxers.
Irish Logic
Perhaps his decision was affected
by the Irish logic of Harry Maloney.
At any rate in 1927 Tunney insti
tuted at Stanford a series of medals
to be awarded by Maloney every
year to outstanding boxers.
Since that time Stanford's director
of minor sports has picked his men;
he used a point system, and he gives
j boxing 10 points.
Stanford Spirit
But he also gives the same num
i ber of points for scholarship, leader
ship, attitude, and other things that
make up something that Maloney is
intensely proud of—Stanford spirit.

I The medals became Stanford's ;
most desired sports award, the only j
' one that Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur sees fit to deliver personally, j
year in and year out.
Men That Learn
And Maloney sizes up the men
that learn a left hook from him or ■
those who drop in to look at his
sports photo gallery by the Tunney
standards.
Hundreds of boxers have met
them. J. Donovan Fiint, 1917, still
sends back an award medal every
year out of regard for his mentor, j
Fred Glover, Phi Bete, student body
president, and now ;i Naval Intelli
gence officer is a favorite.
Into the country's coaching circles I
Maloney sent Myron Schall, now |
Cal Aggie coach and Dewitt Portell.
San Jose ring leader. Stubby Stoltz, '
former head of Stanford's School of
Health, left Maloney s area to go as
i a Rhodes Scholar to Oxford where
he won the biggest match of his life
: against Cambridge.
Lately there was Johnny Ward
who won the P.C.C. title in the
heavyweight division in 15)40. Frank
Hewitt who got runner-up in the ■
welterweights last year, and Lind- ;
skog himself, one of the best college j
heavyweights in the business.
After-Stanford Live
These are only a few of the men
that Maloney can remember at the
drop of a hat, both by the impression
(hey made on him, by their records
in after-Stanford life, and by the
j myriad of pictures they send him.
Harry Maloney knows boxers and
he knows students. He has travelled
around the world with athletic teams
and on his own, and everywhere he
| has been welcomed by what he
I terms "the excellent reputation of
Stanford."
Best Class
When he says that the boys of j
194.1, both as boxers and as men of
real spirit, are the best class in his
I 112 years, it's the voice of sincere
. authority.
"You can't buy the stuff these
boys learn in the ring, and when
they get out and I notice that they
1 climb upwards in their professions.
I like to think that I and boxing
helped a little."


In the 32 years that he has
watched Stanford men climb through
the ropes Harry Maloney has never
seen a scrappier, more serious bunch
than those who have made war
time 1943 the biggest year in Farm
boxing history.
About 280 men have enrolled in
the gym classes in boxing taught by
Maloney and his assistant, Vic Lind
skog. Another 60 have entered the
Novice and All-U boxing tourna
ments which will end tomorrow
night.
War Affects
Using what "a Phi Beta Kappa
might call fortitude but what we all
know is plain guts," the new boxers
and the old ones have been strongly
affected by the war and its demands
for physical training. But in their
efforts, the stocky, gentlemanly Ma

Irish Logic
Perhaps his decision was affected
by the Irish logic of Harry Maloney.
At any rate in 1927 Tunney insti
tuted at Stanford a series of medals
to be awarded by Maloney every
year to outstanding boxers.
Since that time Stanford's director
of minor sports has picked his men;
he used a point system, and he gives
j boxing 10 points.
Stanford Spirit
But he also gives the same num
i ber of points for scholarship, leader
ship, attitude, and other things that
make up something that Maloney is
intensely proud of—Stanford spirit.

I The medals became Stanford's ;
most desired sports award, the only j
' one that Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur sees fit to deliver personally, j
year in and year out.
Men That Learn
And Maloney sizes up the men
that learn a left hook from him or ■
those who drop in to look at his
sports photo gallery by the Tunney
standards.
Hundreds of boxers have met
them. J. Donovan Fiint, 1917, still
sends back an award medal every
year out of regard for his mentor, j
Fred Glover, Phi Bete, student body
president, and now ;i Naval Intelli
gence officer is a favorite.
Into the country's coaching circles I
Maloney sent Myron Schall, now |
Cal Aggie coach and Dewitt Portell.
San Jose ring leader. Stubby Stoltz, '
former head of Stanford's School of
Health, left Maloney s area to go as
i a Rhodes Scholar to Oxford where
he won the biggest match of his life
: against Cambridge.
Lately there was Johnny Ward
who won the P.C.C. title in the
heavyweight division in 15)40. Frank
Hewitt who got runner-up in the ■
welterweights last year, and Lind- ;
skog himself, one of the best college j
heavyweights in the business.
After-Stanford Live
These are only a few of the men
that Maloney can remember at the
drop of a hat, both by the impression
(hey made on him, by their records
in after-Stanford life, and by the
j myriad of pictures they send him.
Harry Maloney knows boxers and
he knows students. He has travelled
around the world with athletic teams
and on his own, and everywhere he
| has been welcomed by what he
I terms "the excellent reputation of
Stanford."
Best Class
When he says that the boys of j
194.1, both as boxers and as men of
real spirit, are the best class in his
I 112 years, it's the voice of sincere
. authority.
"You can't buy the stuff these
boys learn in the ring, and when
they get out and I notice that they
1 climb upwards in their professions.
I like to think that I and boxing
helped a little."


In the 32 years that he has
watched Stanford men climb through
the ropes Harry Maloney has never
seen a scrappier, more serious bunch
than those who have made war
time 1943 the biggest year in Farm
boxing history.
About 280 men have enrolled in
the gym classes in boxing taught by
Maloney and his assistant, Vic Lind
skog. Another 60 have entered the
Novice and All-U boxing tourna
ments which will end tomorrow
night.
War Affects
Using what "a Phi Beta Kappa
might call fortitude but what we all
know is plain guts," the new boxers
and the old ones have been strongly
affected by the war and its demands
for physical training. But in their
efforts, the stocky, gentlemanly Ma
loney sees other things which he
has- trained himself to notice over
years of association with Stanford
men. -
These things are perhaps best
summed up in the qualifications
which Maloney requires lor the
winner of one of the Farm's famous
Gene Tunney medals.
Athletic Coach at the growing Farm,

Maloney went into the service in
1914. There in the course of his
wanderings as an army physical in
structor he met a young Marine
private. Their common interest in
boxing drew them together, and at
one time Maloney even told his
friend that he should not enter the
professional ring.
But Gene Tunney had a goal, and
he pounded his way to it. Then he
left the ring, intact, with an ambi
tion achieved. He never tried the
often-fatal "road back" that ftas been
tragic for many boxers.
