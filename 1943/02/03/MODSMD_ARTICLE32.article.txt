## Varsity Meets Navy Saturday 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
will play the first game of the sea
son this Saturday when they open
on the Sunken Diamond against
a team from a receiving ship hos

Since freshman eligibility has not
yet been determined, baseball coach
Harry Wolter will start three fresh
men in the infield. Jack Bronson will
start at second base, Bob Brown at
short, and Jay McKie at third. Ray
Rammett will return for his fourth
year at baseball for the Cards to
again hold down the first base posi
tion. Batteries for Saturday's game
will be Bill Brokaw, pitcher, and
Ward Walkup, catcher. Harvey Ma
son will relieve Brokaw in the pitch
ing position.
