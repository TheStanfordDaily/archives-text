# "The Magazine"
## 
### 
TODAY we are publishing what The Daily has
lovingly called "The Magazine" for the past
few weeks.
When The Daily changed to the tabloid size
it automatically had to cut down much of the
space it could devote to the feature type of
material.
Realizing this fault v/e have undertaken the
plan of publishing "The Magazine" once every
two weeks and in it putting articles by members
of the staff and University professors, and pic
tures to illustrate themâ€”thus "The Magazine."
