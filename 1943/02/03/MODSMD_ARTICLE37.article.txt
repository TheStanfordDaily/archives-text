# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
Today in thousands of cities and towns
throughout the country is "Whatever Happened
to Alf Landon" Day. Everybody who knows
what happened to him will wear a red sun
flower, and everybody who doesn't have the
slightest idea' what ever happened to him will
wear a white one. In this way the yellow sun
flowers, which are somewhat more prevalent
that the other shades, can be reserved for those
who don't give a damn, since it was these people
who sported the sunflower in the first place,
according to a 1936 Literary Digest.

If they can get around to it before "Welcome
Home Douglas Corrigan" Day comes around,
the committee will dedicate a week to "Has
Anybody Got a Copy of the Literary Digest,"
and those who do will wrap the copy in sun
flower leaves, green preferred, and send it to
Alf Landon, who by that time should be found.
We have suddenly come to the conclusion
that our hashing job is not so bad. For instance,
we were coming home late one evening and
just as we passed the Cellar we noticed a figure
scoot into the Cellar's back entrance. Upon fur
ther investigation we discovered that this poor
youngster dragged himself from bed each eve
ning at 7 a.m., groped into his clothes, and ap
peared behind the Cellar's service bar bright
and fresh six days a week at 7:30 a.m. (All Cel
lar hashers are to be allowed double portions
of anything except butter, meat and dessert.)
