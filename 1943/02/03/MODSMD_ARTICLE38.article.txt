## Sadie Hawkins Has Jitters; Throws Dogpatch Hop Feb. 13 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Sympathetic Sadie Hawkins, feelm* sorry for campus women with war
(no-male) jitters, is throwin' a Dogpatch Hop Feb. L.i in the Women's G>m
from 9 to 1. "This is yo' last chance fo' the duration to get a good date,
and yo'd better get started askin' cause men are get tin' rationed fast, and
not on last year's quota," she warns.
It started with no sugar, then there wasn't any gas fo' moonlight rides.

finally there wasn't any po'k chops
and now they're really crackin' down
—there just isn't going to be any
more Lfl Abners.
A year ago Daisy Mae could put
a price on the head of her Li'l Ab
ner. Why not, with men (even 1A)
tripping over themselves reminding
her of the time and place. She even
dared to break down the admission
price of 99 cents and publish the re
sults, "9 cents tax, 87 cents to admit
Daisy and 3 centavos for the man."
"Tint year we-uns had better be
careful else'n what men are left'll
sally forth to corn-huskin's at Skunk
Hollow (Mills to Stanford women),"
said Verniee Hines, chairman of the
Sadie Hawkins Dogpatch event,
Besides the admission price isn't
99 any more. This is war and it's
$1.10 and cheap at the price, no
matter how it's broken down.
Paul Law and his orchestra are
packing in to play, Bill Lovvorn is
in charge of arrangements, Roberta
Suiter will ask patrons and patron
esses, Ann Robinson is in charge of
decorations and Kay Thomas will
handle Quad publicity.
