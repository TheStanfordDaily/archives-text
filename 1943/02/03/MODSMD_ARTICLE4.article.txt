# WITH THE BRITISH 8th
## 
### 
Bill Gosline pulled in from Libya
vo weeks ago, after a year's ambu
ulce driving for the British Bth
rmy. Driving a 112-tonl 1 2-ton Dodge
•uck - with General Montgomery's
esert fighters means action, and
lat's what Gosline got.
During a heavy Jerry raid on To
ruk, he stood beside his ambulance
i the outskirts of town, too fasci
ated by the dazzling display of fire
orks to seek refuge in a dugout.
The night sky was a sheet of fire
irown up by the Tobruk ack-acks,
ach gun bad assigned area in
le sky to Hill -"with projectiles, the
}ject being to keep the bombers
igh above effective bombing range,
uher than aim for the plane itself,
yellow, and green tracers,
irsting shells, German incendiaries
id flares made a Coney Island
lurth look sick," Gosline said,
obruk Shattered
It was raids like these that left
obruk the shattered city it is today
only a church and hospital still
and.
Gosline left California for Cairo
November, 1941, with 100 men,
ilunteers of the American Field
>rvice. As he rounded the Cape,
e Japs hit Pearl Harbor, so they
-e-lined to India.
ohmteers
Once in Libya, Gosline teamed up
ith a volunteer from Cal. Together
ey withstood the heat, sand, flies,
d Wogs (natives). They drank
stilled sea water at Tobruk, and
len the supply lines were far
fetched, they washed their clothes
gasoline, and salved the burns of
tssies who used gasoline for water
:x and unwittingly lit a cigarette
tore it evaporated.
The Nazis sprung an unexpected
• raid on them one day and Gos
e's pal was hit by shrapnel. He

was rushed to the rear lines in his
own ambulance, and there he died.
Gosline fell back with the British
before Rommel's push towards
Egypt last year, while Mussolini
ranted on about a Victory road to
Alexandria. He pulled hurriedly out
of Tobruk, shortly before Rommel
charged in. He back-stepped through
Bardia and Sidi Barani, and saw
nothing but heaps of tile and mounds
with white crosses. At a strategic
spot, the British would rush up New
Zealand shock troops, who "fought
like hell, but took a hell of a beat
ing." Gosline said they have lost
over half of the 40.000 troops they
started with three years ago.
Part of (he New Zealand forces
were native Maories, who see like
cats in the dark. They specialize in
night fighting with razorsharp knives
and lusty war whoops.
Inferior Forces
All during the British retreat,
Rommel commanded numerically in
ferior forces. The British would pep
per the landscape behind them with
land-mines. Then, when they w >uld
attempt to counterattack, they would
find that the wily German general
had cleared a narrow path into the
middle of the mine-field and would
just park there with his whole army,
defying the British to attack.
The typical British story about
Rommel is that whenever the Brit
ish had 15,000 Nazis trapped, the
next morning they'd awake to find
5,000 Italian prisoners.
Apologizes
There are other stories about
Rommel, too, that he is a gentleman
who apologizes when his army
sweeps through a Red Cross area or
sends up his fighters to shoot down
Italian planes that bomb British
hospitals.
With exception of El Alemain, the

desert war was fluid. Thei'e was no
well-defined front and the Germans j
were as likely to bob up behind you, j
as in front. "It isn't at all like a j
CIO business, where you have mini- 1
mum and 'maximum hours," com- 1
mented Gosline, "it's more like
working for a fire department; ready
24 hours a day and then hopping
into action, but most of the time just
being ready." There would be two
and three-day stretches without
sleep, followed by three-week per
iods with nothing but sleep.
Axis Prisoners
Qosline saw Axis prisoners, most- 1
ly Italians, generally slovenly and j
screaming for food. The Germans j
seemed to be a clean-cut bunch, j
quiet, confident, and fearless. He
asked one German what he thought
of the Italians, and the prisoner re- ;
plied, "the same thing the Russians
think of you."
In battle, the Germans were un- |
perturbed by artillery. They would
stand defiantly beside their tanks \
amid a hail of shells, and when the 1
barrage subsided, they would calmly
resume their attack. There were
scores of instances when British guns
would concentrate on an isolated
pocket f)l Germans and seemingly
annihilate them. But when the big
guns cooled off, the Germans would
rise from the shell-pocked dunes
and retaliate.
Indian Troops
Gosline described the fatalism of
Indians with the British troops. They
would be impervious to death and
would throw stones at a German
tank before being mowed down. No
one could understand their language,
much less their philosophy.
One evening, near Suez, Gosline
was sitting outside a British col
onel s headquarters. A massive
American Negro was on sentry duty
outside. A British major appeared

i and asked the Negro if the colonel
was in. Not bothering to snap to
I attention, the Negro said, "Yassuh,
i boss, he's inside."
i
One day when Gosline was test
ing 10 miles behind the front lines,
j a Life photographer approached him
and asked for a few pictures. Gos
' line suggested that Ihe best action
| shots would be found 10 miles west
!at the front. The photographer
asked him to smear his face and pose
I some front line action, remarking
I that his "life was too valuable to
j visit the front."
Gosline would spend evenings of
lull with fellow drivers, discussing
Montgomery's strategy or new secret
weapons. One was of the Baron
! Munchauson caliber which alleged

| that a powerful new tank had been
devised with such a powerful recoil,
that each time a shell was fired the
; recoil would take back the wounded
I and bring up reinforcements.
Pulls Stakes
Baked by the desert sun, Gosline
decided to pull stakes when his term
' expired last November. As he
boarded a ship back to the States,
! the American Expeditionary Force
swarmed into Morocco. Gosline
! missed the big show, but expects
more.
Pie is here at Stanford now, but
j expects to be called intg the Board
| of Economic Warfare soon. He's had
enough of the, desert heat, sand, (lies,
! and Wogs to last him a lifetime, but
claims he'd do it all over again.

night fighting with razorsharp knives
and lusty war whoops.
Inferior Forces
All during the British retreat,
Rommel commanded numerically in
ferior forces. The British would pep
per the landscape behind them with
land-mines. Then, when they w >uld
attempt to counterattack, they would
find that the wily German general
had cleared a narrow path into the
middle of the mine-field and would
just park there with his whole army,
defying the British to attack.
The typical British story about
Rommel is that whenever the Brit
ish had 15,000 Nazis trapped, the
next morning they'd awake to find
5,000 Italian prisoners.
Apologizes
There are other stories about
Rommel, too, that he is a gentleman
who apologizes when his army
sweeps through a Red Cross area or
sends up his fighters to shoot down
Italian planes that bomb British
hospitals.
With exception of El Alemain, the

desert war was fluid. Thei'e was no
well-defined front and the Germans j
were as likely to bob up behind you, j
as in front. "It isn't at all like a j
CIO business, where you have mini- 1
mum and 'maximum hours," com- 1
mented Gosline, "it's more like
working for a fire department; ready
24 hours a day and then hopping
into action, but most of the time just
being ready." There would be two
and three-day stretches without
sleep, followed by three-week per
iods with nothing but sleep.
Axis Prisoners
Qosline saw Axis prisoners, most- 1
ly Italians, generally slovenly and j
screaming for food. The Germans j
seemed to be a clean-cut bunch, j
quiet, confident, and fearless. He
asked one German what he thought
of the Italians, and the prisoner re- ;
plied, "the same thing the Russians
think of you."
In battle, the Germans were un- |
perturbed by artillery. They would
stand defiantly beside their tanks \
amid a hail of shells, and when the 1
barrage subsided, they would calmly
resume their attack. There were
scores of instances when British guns
would concentrate on an isolated
pocket f)l Germans and seemingly
annihilate them. But when the big
guns cooled off, the Germans would
rise from the shell-pocked dunes
and retaliate.
Indian Troops
Gosline described the fatalism of
Indians with the British troops. They
would be impervious to death and
would throw stones at a German
tank before being mowed down. No
one could understand their language,
much less their philosophy.
One evening, near Suez, Gosline
was sitting outside a British col
onel s headquarters. A massive
American Negro was on sentry duty
outside. A British major appeared

i and asked the Negro if the colonel
was in. Not bothering to snap to
I attention, the Negro said, "Yassuh,
i boss, he's inside."

One day when Gosline was test
ing 10 miles behind the front lines,
j a Life photographer approached him
and asked for a few pictures. Gos
' line suggested that Ihe best action
| shots would be found 10 miles west
!at the front. The photographer
asked him to smear his face and pose
I some front line action, remarking
I that his "life was too valuable to
j visit the front."
Gosline would spend evenings of
lull with fellow drivers, discussing
Montgomery's strategy or new secret
weapons. One was of the Baron
! Munchauson caliber which alleged

| that a powerful new tank had been
devised with such a powerful recoil,
that each time a shell was fired the
; recoil would take back the wounded
I and bring up reinforcements.
Pulls Stakes
Baked by the desert sun, Gosline
decided to pull stakes when his term
' expired last November. As he
boarded a ship back to the States,
! the American Expeditionary Force
swarmed into Morocco. Gosline
! missed the big show, but expects
more.
Pie is here at Stanford now, but
j expects to be called intg the Board

enough of the, desert heat, sand, (lies,

claims he'd do it all over again.

During a heavy Jerry raid on To
ruk, he stood beside his ambulance
i the outskirts of town, too fasci

obruk Shattered
It was raids like these that left
obruk the shattered city it is today
only a church and hospital still
and.
Gosline left California for Cairo
November, 1941, with 100 men,
ilunteers of the American Field
>rvice. As he rounded the Cape,
e Japs hit Pearl Harbor, so they
-e-lined to India.

Once in Libya, Gosline teamed up
ith a volunteer from Cal. Together
ey withstood the heat, sand, flies,
d Wogs (natives). They drank
stilled sea water at Tobruk, and
len the supply lines were far
fetched, they washed their clothes
gasoline, and salved the burns of
tssies who used gasoline for water
:x and unwittingly lit a cigarette
tore it evaporated.
The Nazis sprung an unexpected
• raid on them one day and Gos
e's pal was hit by shrapnel. He

was rushed to the rear lines in his
own ambulance, and there he died.
Gosline fell back with the British
before Rommel's push towards
Egypt last year, while Mussolini
ranted on about a Victory road to
Alexandria. He pulled hurriedly out
of Tobruk, shortly before Rommel
charged in. He back-stepped through
Bardia and Sidi Barani, and saw
nothing but heaps of tile and mounds
with white crosses. At a strategic
spot, the British would rush up New
Zealand shock troops, who "fought
like hell, but took a hell of a beat
ing." Gosline said they have lost
over half of the 40.000 troops they
started with three years ago.

was sitting outside a British col

American Negro was on sentry duty
outside. A British major appeared

One day when Gosline was test
ing 10 miles behind the front lines,
j a Life photographer approached him
and asked for a few pictures. Gos
' line suggested that Ihe best action

!at the front. The photographer
asked him to smear his face and pose
I some front line action, remarking
I that his "life was too valuable to
j visit the front."
Gosline would spend evenings of
lull with fellow drivers, discussing
Montgomery's strategy or new secret
weapons. One was of the Baron
! Munchauson caliber which alleged

devised with such a powerful recoil,
that each time a shell was fired the
; recoil would take back the wounded
I and bring up reinforcements.
Pulls Stakes
Baked by the desert sun, Gosline
decided to pull stakes when his term
' expired last November. As he
boarded a ship back to the States,
! the American Expeditionary Force
swarmed into Morocco. Gosline
! missed the big show, but expects
more.
Pie is here at Stanford now, but
j expects to be called intg the Board

enough of the, desert heat, sand, (lies,

BILL GGSLINE, fcrmer Stanford student, served as an ambuanee
driver with the British Eighth Army under famed British Gen. Bernard
L. Montgomery. Gcsline's story of the big push that saved an empire
is told at (he left. Above, German Gen. Von Bitter is pictured sur
rendering to Montgomery.
Bill Gosline pulled in from Libya
vo weeks ago, after a year's ambu
ulce driving for the British Bth
rmy. Driving a 112-tonl 1 2-ton Dodge
•uck - with General Montgomery's
esert fighters means action, and
lat's what Gosline got.
During a heavy Jerry raid on To
ruk, he stood beside his ambulance
i the outskirts of town, too fasci
ated by the dazzling display of fire
orks to seek refuge in a dugout.
The night sky was a sheet of fire
irown up by the Tobruk ack-acks,
ach gun bad assigned area in
le sky to Hill -"with projectiles, the
}ject being to keep the bombers
igh above effective bombing range,
uher than aim for the plane itself,
yellow, and green tracers,
irsting shells, German incendiaries
id flares made a Coney Island
lurth look sick," Gosline said,
obruk Shattered
It was raids like these that left
obruk the shattered city it is today
only a church and hospital still
and.
Gosline left California for Cairo
November, 1941, with 100 men,
ilunteers of the American Field
>rvice. As he rounded the Cape,
e Japs hit Pearl Harbor, so they
-e-lined to India.
ohmteers
Once in Libya, Gosline teamed up
ith a volunteer from Cal. Together
ey withstood the heat, sand, flies,
d Wogs (natives). They drank
stilled sea water at Tobruk, and
len the supply lines were far
fetched, they washed their clothes
gasoline, and salved the burns of
tssies who used gasoline for water
:x and unwittingly lit a cigarette
tore it evaporated.
The Nazis sprung an unexpected
• raid on them one day and Gos
e's pal was hit by shrapnel. He

was rushed to the rear lines in his
own ambulance, and there he died.
Gosline fell back with the British
before Rommel's push towards
Egypt last year, while Mussolini
ranted on about a Victory road to
Alexandria. He pulled hurriedly out
of Tobruk, shortly before Rommel
charged in. He back-stepped through
Bardia and Sidi Barani, and saw
nothing but heaps of tile and mounds
with white crosses. At a strategic
spot, the British would rush up New
Zealand shock troops, who "fought
like hell, but took a hell of a beat
ing." Gosline said they have lost
over half of the 40.000 troops they
started with three years ago.
Part of (he New Zealand forces
were native Maories, who see like
cats in the dark. They specialize in
night fighting with razorsharp knives
and lusty war whoops.
Inferior Forces
All during the British retreat,
Rommel commanded numerically in
ferior forces. The British would pep
per the landscape behind them with
land-mines. Then, when they w >uld
attempt to counterattack, they would
find that the wily German general
had cleared a narrow path into the
middle of the mine-field and would
just park there with his whole army,
defying the British to attack.
The typical British story about
Rommel is that whenever the Brit
ish had 15,000 Nazis trapped, the
next morning they'd awake to find
5,000 Italian prisoners.
Apologizes
There are other stories about
Rommel, too, that he is a gentleman
who apologizes when his army
sweeps through a Red Cross area or
sends up his fighters to shoot down
Italian planes that bomb British
hospitals.
With exception of El Alemain, the

desert war was fluid. Thei'e was no
well-defined front and the Germans j
were as likely to bob up behind you, j
as in front. "It isn't at all like a j
CIO business, where you have mini- 1
mum and 'maximum hours," com- 1
mented Gosline, "it's more like
working for a fire department; ready
24 hours a day and then hopping
into action, but most of the time just
being ready." There would be two
and three-day stretches without
sleep, followed by three-week per
iods with nothing but sleep.
Axis Prisoners
Qosline saw Axis prisoners, most- 1
ly Italians, generally slovenly and j
screaming for food. The Germans j
seemed to be a clean-cut bunch, j
quiet, confident, and fearless. He
asked one German what he thought
of the Italians, and the prisoner re- ;
plied, "the same thing the Russians
think of you."
In battle, the Germans were un- |
perturbed by artillery. They would
stand defiantly beside their tanks \
amid a hail of shells, and when the 1
barrage subsided, they would calmly
resume their attack. There were
scores of instances when British guns
would concentrate on an isolated
pocket f)l Germans and seemingly
annihilate them. But when the big
guns cooled off, the Germans would
rise from the shell-pocked dunes
and retaliate.
Indian Troops
Gosline described the fatalism of
Indians with the British troops. They
would be impervious to death and
would throw stones at a German
tank before being mowed down. No
one could understand their language,
much less their philosophy.

obruk Shattered
It was raids like these that left
obruk the shattered city it is today
only a church and hospital still
and.
Gosline left California for Cairo
November, 1941, with 100 men,
ilunteers of the American Field
>rvice. As he rounded the Cape,
e Japs hit Pearl Harbor, so they
-e-lined to India.
ohmteers
Once in Libya, Gosline teamed up
ith a volunteer from Cal. Together
ey withstood the heat, sand, flies,
d Wogs (natives). They drank
stilled sea water at Tobruk, and
len the supply lines were far
fetched, they washed their clothes
gasoline, and salved the burns of
tssies who used gasoline for water
:x and unwittingly lit a cigarette
tore it evaporated.
The Nazis sprung an unexpected
• raid on them one day and Gos
e's pal was hit by shrapnel. He

was rushed to the rear lines in his
own ambulance, and there he died.
Gosline fell back with the British
before Rommel's push towards
Egypt last year, while Mussolini
ranted on about a Victory road to
Alexandria. He pulled hurriedly out
of Tobruk, shortly before Rommel
charged in. He back-stepped through
Bardia and Sidi Barani, and saw
nothing but heaps of tile and mounds
with white crosses. At a strategic
spot, the British would rush up New
Zealand shock troops, who "fought
like hell, but took a hell of a beat
ing." Gosline said they have lost
over half of the 40.000 troops they
started with three years ago.
Part of (he New Zealand forces
were native Maories, who see like
cats in the dark. They specialize in
night fighting with razorsharp knives
and lusty war whoops.
Inferior Forces
All during the British retreat,
Rommel commanded numerically in
ferior forces. The British would pep
per the landscape behind them with
land-mines. Then, when they w >uld
attempt to counterattack, they would
find that the wily German general
had cleared a narrow path into the
middle of the mine-field and would
just park there with his whole army,
defying the British to attack.
The typical British story about
Rommel is that whenever the Brit
ish had 15,000 Nazis trapped, the
next morning they'd awake to find
5,000 Italian prisoners.
Apologizes
There are other stories about
Rommel, too, that he is a gentleman
who apologizes when his army
sweeps through a Red Cross area or
sends up his fighters to shoot down
Italian planes that bomb British
hospitals.
With exception of El Alemain, the

desert war was fluid. Thei'e was no
well-defined front and the Germans j
were as likely to bob up behind you, j
as in front. "It isn't at all like a j
CIO business, where you have mini- 1
mum and 'maximum hours," com- 1
mented Gosline, "it's more like
working for a fire department; ready
24 hours a day and then hopping
into action, but most of the time just
being ready." There would be two
and three-day stretches without
sleep, followed by three-week per
iods with nothing but sleep.
Axis Prisoners
Qosline saw Axis prisoners, most- 1
ly Italians, generally slovenly and j
screaming for food. The Germans j
seemed to be a clean-cut bunch, j
quiet, confident, and fearless. He
asked one German what he thought
of the Italians, and the prisoner re- ;
plied, "the same thing the Russians
think of you."
In battle, the Germans were un- |
perturbed by artillery. They would
stand defiantly beside their tanks \
amid a hail of shells, and when the 1
barrage subsided, they would calmly
resume their attack. There were
scores of instances when British guns
would concentrate on an isolated
pocket f)l Germans and seemingly
annihilate them. But when the big
guns cooled off, the Germans would
rise from the shell-pocked dunes
and retaliate.
Indian Troops
Gosline described the fatalism of
Indians with the British troops. They
would be impervious to death and
would throw stones at a German
tank before being mowed down. No
one could understand their language,
much less their philosophy.
One evening, near Suez, Gosline
was sitting outside a British col
onel s headquarters. A massive
American Negro was on sentry duty
outside. A British major appeared

i and asked the Negro if the colonel
was in. Not bothering to snap to
I attention, the Negro said, "Yassuh,
i boss, he's inside."

One day when Gosline was test
ing 10 miles behind the front lines,
j a Life photographer approached him
and asked for a few pictures. Gos
' line suggested that Ihe best action
| shots would be found 10 miles west
!at the front. The photographer
asked him to smear his face and pose
I some front line action, remarking
I that his "life was too valuable to
j visit the front."
Gosline would spend evenings of
lull with fellow drivers, discussing
Montgomery's strategy or new secret
weapons. One was of the Baron
! Munchauson caliber which alleged

| that a powerful new tank had been
devised with such a powerful recoil,
that each time a shell was fired the
; recoil would take back the wounded
I and bring up reinforcements.
Pulls Stakes
Baked by the desert sun, Gosline
decided to pull stakes when his term
' expired last November. As he
boarded a ship back to the States,
! the American Expeditionary Force
swarmed into Morocco. Gosline
! missed the big show, but expects
more.
Pie is here at Stanford now, but
j expects to be called intg the Board
