Patriotic Duty
"Keeping physically*fit is no long- '
<?r a matter of personal preference
for women. It is a patriotic duty
which they owe to their country.
Many valuable hours in war indus
try and in education are lost because
of illness." commented Miss Maud 1
Knapp, Director of Women's Physi
! cal Education, who was one of the
! speakers on the discussion panel.
In some colleges mass calisthenic
drills have been substituted for the
regular physical education program.
At Stanford, however, every one of
the 4G gym classes for women is a ;
physical fitness class—the courses
are suited to the varying needs of
each individual.
Health Precautions
It was brought out that gvnina
-1 sium exercise is only a small part
'of keeping in good physical con
dition. Proper nutrition, rest, and j
health precautions are equally vital.
"Don't baby yourselves," said Sis
Larkin. "Don't cut classes, wear
, yourselves out on week-ends, and
I miss your sleep. In keeping your- !
| self physically fit you are not only
; aiding the war effort but giving 1
1 yourself something that will carry
I over after the war."
The virus causing typhoid fever is
car; led by mice and woodchucks as
well as by rats, according to new
1 medical discoveries.

Patriotic Duty

Many valuable hours in war indus
try and in education are lost because
of illness." commented Miss Maud 1

physical fitness class—the courses
are suited to the varying needs of
each individual.

, yourselves out on week-ends, and
I miss your sleep. In keeping your- !
