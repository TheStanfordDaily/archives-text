# LIL' INDIAN'S BIOGRAPHY-HE'S SIX YEARS
## 
### 
The Lil' Injun drew his first
eath back in 1936. on the drawing
ard of Tommy Thompson, an in
nious cartoonist the Farm will
lg remember.
Scantily clad, the Lil' Injun was
st seen behind the wheel of a
am roller, flattening Trojans,
ars, and Webfeet without a qualm.
Then Thompson left Lil' Injun in
: hands of Jack Dixon, and took
er Hatlo's vacancy as sports car
>nist for the Call-Bulletin. Thomp
i was a former Daily and Chappie
in and had done a great job with
. talented crayon.
fered for Sale
Dixon saw in the Lil' Injun great
nmercial possibilities. He sent
• Lil' Injun,to the Patent Office in
ishington and almost made the
le fellow a figure in the bureau
cy. But Lil' Injun hopped the first
il train back to the Farm. Then
<on tried selling Lil' Injun to

! downtown stores for advertising
purposes, but the little mascot al
ways bounced back to the Farm.
Despite the materialism of Dixon,
Lil' Injun's spirit could never be
alienated from the Farm.
! In 1940, with the advent of Coach
Shaughnessy and the streamlined
'T" formation, the Lil' Injun stream
lined his steam roller and came
i spurting into Kezar Stadium in a
shiny red racing car, in that first
game versus U.S.F.
Jalopy Cone to War
Idea of the racing car was Ed Mc-
Lellan's, Stanford's latest custodian
of the Lil' Injun. McLellan brought
the Lil' Injun back to the Farm from
the greedy clutches of downtown
i businessmen.
Last year, the Lil' Injun had diffi
culty getting tires for his racing
machine, which were pretty well
! worn down after the bi<_>" Rose Bowl
victory the year before. The ration

board shook its head when Lil' In
jun asked for new rubber, so in
desperation Lil' Injun darted up to
Page Mill road before the Gremlins
put his tires away for keeps, and
| traded the jalopy in for a jeep.
Injun Rides in |eep
But jeeps handle a little different
than racing cars, and when Lil' In
jun bounced out on the field to
meet Washington State, he couldn't
i coordinate the clutch and gear shift
, and never did get the new-fangled
{ jeep out of low.
The jeep handled rather erraticly
. and Lil' Injun didn't catch onto its
quirks until mid-season. From there
on out, Lil' Injun learned to ride the
I bucking machine.
Today, Lil' Injun is exclusively
: Stanford's — making frequent ap
pearances in The Daily. Chappie, and
"stuft' like that there."
No telling what he'll bob up in
| next fall.
The Lil' Injun has been elected as
an honorable member of Cap and
Gown, although he is a he and not a
she, but just the same he appears in
| the calendars every year and does
his part in carrying on the good
j work.

Lil' Injun has been spending his
time lately just wandering around
the Farm and philosophising on cur
rent events for The Daily. It is Lil'
Injun who comments to the campus
on how cold it got the night Lagu-
nita almost froze over, and who
gripes at nature when he has to
practically swim to his dark and
dreary 8 o'clocks on rainy Winter
Quarter mornings.
Philosophizes
Recently breaking into print has
been Lil' Injun's spouse, Lil' Squaw.
It is Lil' Squaw who takes the fem
inine viewpoint of Farm happenings.
This dusky little Indian maid knows
the trials and tribulations of the
Farm's increasing "500" and sympa
thizes with the Stanford coed. On
Page 5 of today's Daily, she is be
moaning the possibility of the ra
tioning of rayon stockings. Lil'
Squaw is realizing that there is a
war on.
No one can even guess what the
future holds for this famed little
couple. Lil' Injun may be drafted
to fight for his country. These are
uncertain times but all Lil' Injun
has to say on the situation is:
"Ugh!"
