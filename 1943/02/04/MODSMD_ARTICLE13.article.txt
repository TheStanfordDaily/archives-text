The Army Specialized Training
Program in colleges and universities
of the country will provide technical

instruction for approximately 150,-
000 young soldiers each year.
These men, who must be under
22 years of ago, will spend from 12
to 48 weeks in classrooms, labora
tories and study halls preparing for
special duties in such services as the
Air Forces, Corps of Engineers,
Medical Department, Chemical War
fare. Signal Corps, and the Adjutant
General's Division.
It will not be possible to utilize
all colleges and universities. A
joint committee of the Army. Navy,
and the Manpower Commission is
now selecting schools where re
quired facilities are available.
Gen. Dalton stated that a con
tract would he made by the Army
with the beard, or governing body
of the selected college or univer
sity whereby the institution would
furnish a prescribed course of
study under its own accredited
professors.

"The college will house and feed
the soldier-students in such a man
ner as to meet Army regulations and
will provide textbooks, laboratory
supplies and other academic equip
ment. Beyond that the Army will
supervise and discipline its men.
"Each unit of the Army Special
ized Training Program will l>e un
der a commandant whose military
authority will he final. He will
have a small stall' of officers and
enlisted men who will assist him
in directing the activities of all
members of liis unit when they
are not engaged with their studies.
He will establish a physical con
ditioning schedule which will .in
clude the many types of athletic
games now so popular on the
campus. Military subjects will be
taught and the soldier-students
will be organized into cadet corps,"
according to General Dalton.
General Dalton said that the basic
study course in the program would

include history, geography, English,
mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
He added that each trainee would
be required to devote 24 hours each
week to classroom work and an
equal amount of time to supervised
study.
"While in the classroom the sol
dier-student will be wholly under
the direction of his professor. If he
does not maintain performance
standards, he will find himself back
in the ranks of the Army. At the
end of each 12-weeks' term he must
pass certain examinations. Should
he fall below established averages
and have no valid excuse, he will be
disqualified for further participa
tion.
"In this program each trainee is
seventh giade private, drawing
$50 a mouth. His official status is
no different than any other soldier
of the same rank. He's not a col
lege boy in uniform; he's a dough
boy in a military unit located at a
college. Because of his age and
because he is the graduate of an
accredited high school, lie is given
opportunity to apply his talents
along technical or professional
lines so that he may be more val
uable to the Army.
"This program is not designed to

offer a nice, soft spot for young men
who have been inducted into the
service," announced General Dalton
General Dalton said thnt all men
accepted for the Army Specialized
Training Program will have com
pleted their basic training at Army
replacement camps, or be in tht
process of completing this training
All must pass screening tests which
have been devised by Army experts
in consultation with recognized ci
vilian educators.
"When the soldier-student lias
completed his courses under the
Army Specialized Training Pro
gram, he may he given further
training in an OlTicer Candidate
School, recommended as a techni
cal non-commissioned oflicer, re
turning to troops, or, in exceptional
cases detailed for further technical
training," he said.
"There will be some disturbance
to the college curriculum as we havt
come to know it in the United States
The popular version of liberal edu
cation of our able-bodied young mei
of draft age will be retarded, but a:
Secretary of War Stimson statec
when the program was announced
'To win this war and win it quicklv
as possible we must have large num
bersof young men in the Army'."
