making a total of $103. The Kappa
Gamma house donated $22, and
Magnolia added $:>0 to the drive.
Los Arcos went 100 per cent, giving
$26. No new contributions have as
yet been tabulated from the frater
nities.
Lucien Rice, chairman of the
W.S.S.F. committee, expressed his
pleasure that the drive had advanced
so close to its goal with only two
more days to go.
"The campus seems to realize the
vital need for these funds which
will go all over the world to other
students fighting for an education in
the backwash of the waves of war.
The committee expects each member
of the student body to donate his
dollar by tomorrow," he said.
Thus far 12 living groups have
contributed 100 per cent to the
drive. Top corridor in Roble was
'18, giving $20.
