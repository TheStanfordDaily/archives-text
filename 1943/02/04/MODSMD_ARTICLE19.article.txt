# Southern Pacific Alters Schedules
## 
### 
The Southern Pacific will lengthen
the schedules of practically all im
portant passenger trains on the
Overland, Shasta, and San Joaquin
Valley routes in February because
the preferred handling of mounting
war traffic has made it impossible to
maintain present running times.
Departure times of most trains on
the routes will be earlier than at
present and arrival times later, ac
cording to F. S. McGinnis, vice
president in charge of passenger
traffic for the railroad. From one to
three hours will be added to the run
ning time of San Francisco-Port
land trains and valley line trains
between San Francisco and Los
Angeles.
"We have tried our best to main
tain performance according to our
published time tables, but so many
extra war trains, passenger and
freight, are moving over our lines
that we haven't been able to get reg
ular trains through on time," he
continued. "The new schedules will
give these trains more time to make
their runs and better opportunity to
reach their destinations on time."
