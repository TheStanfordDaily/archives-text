## Nazi Transport System Cracks 
### 
Germany's greatest problem is her
ansportation system, and it is
iere that the United Nations should
like, according to Dr. Karl Brandt,
:-onomist in the Food Research In
itiate, in an article in the January
sue of "Foreign Affairs."
"In transportation, as in her food
•onomy," he said. "Germany is be
nning to move in circles. Every
tttleneck she breaks creates several
hers. In no single branch of the
erman economy—in raw material
ipplies, in food or in man power—
collapse imminent or inevitable,
ut in every sector the reserves are
'coming smaller, inaccessible or dif
cult to mobilize."
Germany has attempted to meet
lis problem by moving as little
eight as is absolutely necessary
ir as short a distance as is possible,
y shifting as much freight as pos
ble from railroads to merchant
tipping and inland waterways, and
y increasing the building program
>r the railroads.
"While nothing could be more dis
strous to the cause of the United
aliens than for them to exaggerate
te economic difficulties of their
ighly resourceful enemy, it seems
isti liable to state that the German
ansport system not only is labor
tg hard, but that it is putting addi
onal burdens on the already over
trained German industrial system,"
)r. Brandt continued.
"Whether this will lead to a more
?rious crisis, or whether, as in the
ast the Nazis will pull through by
concentrating their efforts on vital
oints regardless of cost, will depend
i the last analysis on the action
ikon by the United Nations."
To prevent the shift in freight to
terchant shipping, Dr. Brandt ad
ocates an intensified war on Ger
tan shipping in the North Sea.
Every- supply ship sunk is a clear
ain. Submarines and bombers seem
te most efiective weapons for re
ucing the still considerable tonnage
i German hands. In this field, the
onstruction of more submarines
/ould seem one of the best invest
tents the United Nations could
take."
To damage the inland waterways
ystem. he proposes intensified air
ttacks against the Ruhr and Bel
ium. "The R.A.F. bombed the aque
uct (if the Dortmund-Ems Canal
orth of Munster so severely that
raffic was interrupted for weeks.

Germany's greatest problem is her

"In transportation, as in her food

"While nothing could be more dis
strous to the cause of the United
aliens than for them to exaggerate
te economic difficulties of their
ighly resourceful enemy, it seems

ansport system not only is labor

trained German industrial system,"

"Whether this will lead to a more

concentrating their efforts on vital
oints regardless of cost, will depend
i the last analysis on the action

To prevent the shift in freight to
terchant shipping, Dr. Brandt ad
ocates an intensified war on Ger
tan shipping in the North Sea.
