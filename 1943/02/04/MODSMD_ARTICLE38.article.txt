# Workshop Closes, Termed 'Not Vital'
## 
### 
"The Student War Workshop has
been discontinued for the pres
ent.'' according to Peggy McClean,
chairman. The work being done,
although important, wasn't con
sidered vital enough to demand the
time of students now carrying
more units. Other agencies, name
ly the Red Cross, Stanford Health
Service, and the 8.A.C., have been
told that should a definite emer
gency arise the Workshop will
reopen.
However, the Red Cross work
room is still in need of workers
to make surgical dressings to fill
the Palo Alto quota. Women's
living groups have been assigned
work quotas which they must ful
fill. Girls working are requested
to wear wash dresses and head
scarfs. Garments are available,
however, at the workshop for girls
who have forgotten to bring their
own.
Work hours arc from Ift to 12
and from 1 to 1 Monday through
Friday uptsairs in the Women's
Clubhouse.
