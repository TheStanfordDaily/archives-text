' Victory through air power; air
power through stamps. If each stu
dent on the Farm would buy one 25
cent stamp today, the funds that
would buy more planes would be
S9OO greater," according to Katie
Gore, stamp publicity head.
One 25 cent stamp from each per
son on campus would be a 100 per
cent contribution from each living
group. That is the goal for Winter
Quarter set by the Stamp and Bond
committee.
As yet, this goal has not been
reached. Some houses are consist
ently 100 per cent; others are con
sistently below 50 per cent: some do
not buy any stamps.
The quarter's weekly totals do not
look as high as*last quarter's totals,
because stamp and bond sales are
kept separately. Stamp sales have
not dropped off: they have increased
steadily each week. Last week stu
dents bought S6BB worth of stamps:
bond sales brought the total to over
51,700.
Stamp salesmen will make their
weekly rounds in living groups.
Booths will be staffed on Quad, in
the Cellar, and in the Libe through
out the day. The Daily will report
the sales results in tomorrow's pap A - .
