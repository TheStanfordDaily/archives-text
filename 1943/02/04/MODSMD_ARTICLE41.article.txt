# Style and Quality of Shoes Are Limited for the Duration
## 
### 
"Shoes will be scarcer and sober
er," according to Mr. Doty, general
manager of Thoits. "The wacky shoe
is out for the duration."
"The factories are sending us
about 40 per cent of the quantity
which we bought in 1941. This isn't
a government regulation. It is done
by the factories. Each factory has a
government contract, they have to
stay in business.
"And so," he continued, "they
can't make the quantity of shoes for
civilian consumption which they
have been making because of labor,
factory, and leather shortages. They
are constantly prorating their civi
lian production among the various
dealers."
Fewer Styles
"We could get the same variety of
styles which were available before
the war," he said, "but we wouldn't
be able to get enough of them to fit
everyone. Consequently we are
buying shoes in fewer styles but in
sufficient quantity so that there will
be enough shoes of a style in enough
sizes to fit everyone who wants to
buy a pair.
"Another factor which will cut
down on the variety of shoes pro
duced is that since Sept. 12 no two
tone shoes have been made. The
only two-tone shoes available now
are those on the dealers' shelves.
There will be no more after they
have been sold, but the present stock

] will last for about a year.
"Furthermore, shoes are being
made in" only four colors—black,
white, brown, and navy blue. There
! are three shades of brown allowed,
| however—turf tan, military brown,
j and town brown. Shoes cannot be
| made out of two shades of brown
j nor can shoes of one shade be
| stitched with thread of another
-shade," he declared.
i Four Colors
"The only stockings available are
j lisle and rayon, and deliveries on
j those have been slow.
"Purses, I imagine, will follow the
j same trend as shoes have taken, and
'■ for the same reasons.
"Not only is it difficult to obtain
i manufactured leather goods, but it
is also hard to get leather with
j which to make shoes or to repair
shoes.
Repair Shop
"The repair shop here," Mr. Doty
said, "is using the best leather and
1 other materials which it is possible
to obtain but, due to the war, these
materials are not up to their former
i standards.
"Composition rubber is the only
! rubber obtainable for shoe soles or
heels, and that is hard to get. The
better qualities of leather are also
hard to get. The workmanship,
i however, will be of the same qual
ity that it always has been.
"Incidentally," Mr. Doty said,
"Thoits began about 30 years ago as

a repair shop, and we still have our
''We consider it to be a part of
our contribution to the war effort,"
Mr. Doty continued, "to sell the best
shoes that w*; can get but then that
is our general policy anyway. We
feel that since our employees are too
old for active service, we should be
as active as possible in civilian de
fense and other war work on the
home front.
"As a part of our war work
therefore, we act as a collection de
pot for rubber as well as stockings
People turn in their old shoes to us
We remove and save the rubber
soles, heels, and other salvageable
parts. The rubber is then turned
over to the government to be re
claimed.
The silk and nylon stockings w<
collect are also turned over to thi
government and the silk and nylon
is reclaimed lor use as powder bag?-;
and parachutes.
Personnel's Part
"As for our personnel," Mr. Doty
said, "they are doing their part ir
civilian defense work. We are al
most all too old to fight. The onl\
young man on our staff is our jani
tor and he has four young children
"Mr. Thoits is, of course, a mem
ber of the Selective Service Board
This means that he works about six
hours a day there, which does not
leave him much time to do his work
here at the store. The job is without
pay."
