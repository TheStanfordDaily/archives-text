# Young American Party Announces 1964 Presidential Candidate: a Sure Win
## 
### BILL RULE 
"A Cinch with Belt," "Buckle
Down with Belt," and ''Rely on
Beltâ€”Save Your Pants" will be
campaign slogans in the Presidential
race of 1964. Were it not for the
war, these slogans would be well
.known to all Stanford students, for
their originator lives quietly in En
cina believing that politics and war
do not mix.
When the war is over, the cam
paign will begin again. The candi
date will be Bill Belt, the party will
be the Young American Party, and
(he results will be sensational.
It all started at Wallowa Lake Boy
Scout camp in the summer of 1941
when a jokester nominated Bill Belt
for President. With a good-natured
grin, Bill said, "Let's see, when's the
first year I could run for President?"
The answer was 1964, and a cam
paign was started to carry the joke
still farther. The response, however,
was amazing and took on an added
interest because of the Willkie-Roo
.sevelt battle of that year.
STARTED YOUNG
Bill was a 17-year-old Hermiston,
Ore., high-school youth when his
campaign began to gain momentum
outside of his own state. He soon
received letters from all over the
country. As one of the boys said,
"It was just wacky enough to catch
on."
Saying that Willkie didn't start
early enough, BUI Belt began his
campaign in earnest with Dick
Brown of Pasco, Wash., acting as
national campaign manager. He
named Dick Mansfield of Freewater,
Ore., as his runing mate and chose
his complete cabinet from young
men all over the country who were
aiding him. With this foundation the
campaign spread rapidly. In a very
5-hort time stories of his campaign
had appeared in 64 papers, N.E.A.
service, and "Boy's Life."
CAMPAIGN POINTS
To his friends at a Scout confer
ence he distributed literature which
Jisted several points of his program
as follows:
"Teacherless schools for genius
students.

"Special motorcycles for hiking
Boy Scouts.
"Build seats for W.P.A. shovels.
"Federal grants to the poor."
With the combined efforts of the
novel publicity campaign and the
aid of the enthusiastic young men
of the press, Belt and Brown were
able to make contacts and get cam
paign directors in every state in the
Union. Pins, buttons, and stickers
were printed by the hundreds and
sent all over the country. Belt, him
self, was soon writing between 25
and 50 letters a day.
To further aid the campaign, a
national women's club was formed
by Rosalind Crowe of Columbus,
Ohio. This was followed by a jun
ior organization for kids under 12
sponsored by Jimmy Philips of

Martin, Tennessee.
Before the war situation caused
Bill Belt to let his campaign ride for
the duration, he estimated that he
had over 1,000 clubs, campaign man
agers in every state and many prin
cipal cities, and 3Q0.000 votes already
promised.
To assure gaining the feminine
vote, Bill started a First Lady con
test. All applicants had to be under
20 years of age and very goodlook
ing. Letters and pictures poured
into campaign headquarters from all
over the country.
21 Years to Go
Today Bill is a sophomore at Stan- I
ford. He attended the University of
Oregon for a year and a half and
U.C.L.A. for the summer session of
last year. He plans to finish col
lege as soon as possible and then to
attend law school.
Between now and 1964 there are
21 years. Bill's platform today ad
vocates a continuance of democracy
and the American way of life, a per
manent world peace, an adequate
defense, and economy in national
government. Thomas Dewey, Kate
Smith. Grade Allen, and others feel
that Belt may be able to find the
answer to the world's problems with
21 years to discover it.
Governor's Vote His
Oregon's Governor Earl Snell
wrote: "Certainly with such a build
up over the years, there can be
nothing but success in store for you
| in 1964. You may count, on my vote
i as I propel my wheel chair down to
j the polls in that fateful year of '64."
