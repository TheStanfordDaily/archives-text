## CAGERS Varsity, Gaels Tangle Friday 
### 
St. Mary's College outlasted U.S.F..
] 40-39, Wednesday night in San
1 Francisco in giving an exhibition
! that promises adequate competition
! for Everett Dean's varsity cagers
when the two clash Friday in Civic
Auditorium, San Frtyicisco.
Stanford had little trouble with
: the Dons, 51-36, on Fred Linari Night
last weekend, but they were ob-
I viously in a hot mood that's not like
jly to be repeated so quickly. And
the Gaels are no slouch basketball
team in 1943.
Gaels Over Broncs
The Gaels also topped Santa Clara,
[ 39-38, a week ago, their hotshots,
! Strader and Burke, collecting 10 and
! 13 points apiece in that tilt.
So while Stanford will go into the
game as favorite for the first time
j since the beginning of the season,
it remains another real test for the
revitalized Indians. It is a non
conference game, but many confer
ence eyes will be attentive to see if
i the new Indian streak is liable to
mean unhappiness for them in a
j week or two.
Most atentive, of course, will be
Ernest Holbrook of University of
j Southern California. Equipped with
five supermen and a five-game lead,
Mr. Holbrook realizes that Stanford
j is the only squad that has even a
slim chance to keep him from the
crown, a calamity which he won't
consider impossible until the locals
j have lost one more game.
YV.S.C. Leaders
Up in Pullman. Wash., the W.S.C.
Cougars have eked into a one-game
lead in the northern division, may
keep there if U. of W. at Seattle
doesn't shake a scoring droop. So
1 they too are looking toward Palo
Alto, hoping that Stanford can hang
i on to give U.S.C. some trouble and
! maybe a mickey finn.
In practice sessions the shooting
renaissance, has kept up. Dean has
been alternating McCaffrey and Hal
• stead at one starting guard post, and
both may get their chance for first
i string standing on the basis of com
parative showing Friday.
Alex Omalev of S.C. continues to
lead the conference scorers with 63
: points. Midget Rock is l ight behind.
