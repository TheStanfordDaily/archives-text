## Fulton to Race In Myers Mile 
### 
Johnny Fulton, Stanford's frosh
track sensation of a year ago and
this season's outstanding varsity
middle distance man, has been in
vited to compete with S.C.'s CI iff
Bourland and Fresno's Bob Madrid
in the L. E. Myers Memorial Mile,
the feature of the Olympic Club
indoor track meet, March 12 in San
Francisco.
The event was created by Lon
Myers in 1893 in New York.
Charlie Hunter, director of the
meet, placed the event on the pro
gram in an attempt to see if the
track champion of today possesses
the stamina, recuperative powers,
and speed of a champion of the '80's.
It was decided that three men, an
outstanding sprinter, middle dis
tance man, aad distance runner,
should be invited to compete. Bour
land, Fulton, and Madrid were select
ed as the three because each excells
in one of these fields of running.
Fultan, it will be remembered,
won the Pacific Association 880
championship last year in 1:54.7, and
against the Cal freshmen won the
880, 440. and ran an excellent lap on
the inile relay tam. Bourland has
run the 440 in 46.07, while Madrid
is consistent around 1:57 in the 880,
and 4:20 in the mile.

Howard (Nick) Nickolson, senior
manager of the swimming team, has
issued a call for swimming managers.
Freshmen, sophomores, and juniors
are eligible, and all those who are
interested should call him at 5041
any night this week. The job offers
an excellent chance to do something
in sports.
