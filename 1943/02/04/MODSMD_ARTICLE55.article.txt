# A. Toast to Sacrifice
## 
### 
DEEP into the heart of the Soviet Union the
cream of a nation's fighting men marched
last summer. They were brave men, men who
held an almost religious faith in their Fuehrer,
in themselves, in their Fatherland. Their faith
was not rational but they believed themselves
right. And they believed themselves invincible.
They swept through the rolling hills of Rus
sia's Ukraine like the plague. They invested
every town and hamlet throughout the agonized
segment of a tortured nation. They rolled up
to the Don River, hesitated a moment, and rolled
on. They sped on toward Asiatic Russia like
the waves of the sea. And then they came to
Stalingrad.
Stalingrad stood long and new and proud on
the west bank of the Volga when the brown
clad German legions marched to the city's edge
five months ago. And shortly the Germans
claimed that they were in the city, that the city
had fallen.
But the city had not fallen. The Germans were
in it, to be sure, but they had not taken it. In
stead, they met the most fiery and most deter
mined defense that any modern city in this
war has made. They met a classic opposition.
For the Russians knew they were right, also.
They knew that their own fate depended upon
themselves, that they were masters of their
collective destiny. And the Russians knew that
any person or group which considered itself
invincible must be fallible.
So they dug in and individually sacrificed
more than we would probably wish to know.
But collectively they were solid and today they
have just finished the destruction of an army
of 300,000 brave, faith-bearing fighting men, the
cream of Germany's manhood.
First we are perhaps a little horrified at so
much carnage. It is a natural feeling. But then
we cannot fail to remember what the men and
women of Stalingrad went through—and we
must come to an admiration for the Russians
which is both warm and perhaps a little envious.
Well, the idea of these words is very simple.
It is only that we must attempt to emulate the
Russians in their sacrifices if we expect to do
our share in winning a war which is in large
part ours. And we might add that it would
be a good idea to emulate the Russians in their
deep faith that they are fighting for right if we
expect io be effective at the peace table.

cream of a nation's fighting men marched
last summer. They were brave men, men who
held an almost religious faith in their Fuehrer,
in themselves, in their Fatherland. Their faith
was not rational but they believed themselves
right. And they believed themselves invincible.
They swept through the rolling hills of Rus
sia's Ukraine like the plague. They invested
every town and hamlet throughout the agonized
segment of a tortured nation. They rolled up
to the Don River, hesitated a moment, and rolled
on. They sped on toward Asiatic Russia like
the waves of the sea. And then they came to
Stalingrad.
Stalingrad stood long and new and proud on
the west bank of the Volga when the brown
clad German legions marched to the city's edge
five months ago. And shortly the Germans
claimed that they were in the city, that the city
had fallen.
But the city had not fallen. The Germans were
in it, to be sure, but they had not taken it. In
stead, they met the most fiery and most deter
mined defense that any modern city in this
war has made. They met a classic opposition.
For the Russians knew they were right, also.
They knew that their own fate depended upon
themselves, that they were masters of their
collective destiny. And the Russians knew that
any person or group which considered itself
invincible must be fallible.
So they dug in and individually sacrificed
more than we would probably wish to know.
But collectively they were solid and today they
have just finished the destruction of an army
of 300,000 brave, faith-bearing fighting men, the
cream of Germany's manhood.
First we are perhaps a little horrified at so
much carnage. It is a natural feeling. But then
we cannot fail to remember what the men and
women of Stalingrad went through—and we
must come to an admiration for the Russians
which is both warm and perhaps a little envious.
Well, the idea of these words is very simple.
It is only that we must attempt to emulate the
Russians in their sacrifices if we expect to do
our share in winning a war which is in large
part ours. And we might add that it would
be a good idea to emulate the Russians in their
deep faith that they are fighting for right if we
expect io be effective at the peace table.
DEEP into the heart of the Soviet Union the
