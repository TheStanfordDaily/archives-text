# The
						Quiet 'Y'
## 
### 
THERE is a quiet, efficient group on the Stan
ford campus which has just added another
job to its many and varied activities. This time

it seems that the Y.W.C.A., headed by Janet
McClanahan, is planning to give instruction to
Stanford women so that these women may be
come counselors to the various voluntary girls'
organizations which will send crop crews out
to the fields come spring.
From Palo Alto came the cry that qualified
women v/ould be needed to lead and instruct
the youngsters who will do an important part
of this spring's crop harvesting. The Stanford
Y.W.C.A. is endeavoring to do its share train
ing Stanford women for these counselor posi
tions.
Every Friday at 4 p.m. the "Y" will hold a
"class" in the Women's Clubhouse in order to
prepare all Farm women interested in doing this
type of war work for spring. The idea is that
Stanford women will act as counselors to crop
crews made up principally of high school girls
and girl scouts.
In this capacity the Farm women v/ill teach
the girls the proper methods of harvesting and
camping so that the valuable time of many
farmers will not be wasted on green hands.
And in order that Stanford's women may
know just what to teach, the "Y" is holding its
class.—Bill Steif
