THE following is a letter written by Chancellor
Ray Lyman Wilbur to Ed Stamm, A.S.S.U.
president. Believing that it was worthy of the
attention of all Stanford students, Stamm passed
it on to The Daily:

January 29, 1943
Dear Mr. Stamm:
Please express my thanks to the membership
of the Associated Students for the $2000 in U.S.
Savings Bonds, Series F, to be added to the
Service Men's Scholarship, received January
23rd. I am much pleased to have this and want
to tell all of you on behalf of the University of
our keen- appreciation of the generous support
v/hich this is receiving though the Dimes for
Diplomas campaign. This is certainly a most
worthy project and we are all much gratified
by the manner in which it is being carried for
ward.
Faithfully yours,
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
