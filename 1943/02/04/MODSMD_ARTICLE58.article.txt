Were Dr. Paul Gallup to visit the Farm the
first group he would poll would be the students.
That's only natural because there are more stu
dents than anybody. The first thing he would
poll them on would be the Cellar. He would
ask them the following:
1) Do you think the Cellar should be raised
to street level?
2) If so, would that raise the class of clientele?
3) How long could you live on a diei of noth
ing but coffees (white) and two cokes (large,
lime) per day?
4) Do you go to the Cellar to get something
to drink, or do you go to see if Ellis McKellar
is there?
5) Have you ever actually eaten a meal at the
Cellar?
6) Have you ever paid the nickel check and
put the quarter one in your pocket? Tess up
now.
1) Yes—3o',. No—6o'-'. Undecided—lo',.
2) 55',' say yes. 45',' believe that there is a
certain type of Kappa who wouldn't go to the
Cellar if it were a roof garden.
3) Yes—44', . 16', have been for four years
now. 40', would like a bear claw thrown in.
4) 33' < to see Ellis. GO',', all of whom are
girls, don't give a hoot about Ellis. 7',' just
won't admit it.
5) 85','—no. The other 15'- are in no posi
tion to be interviewed.
6) 70',' —sure. 25','—well, once, but I in
tended to pay it later s'-'—stricken from the
poll for perjury.
