Ever see an iceland defrost?
In an atmosphere as cold as thirty !
sophomores can make it, Stanford's |
15*43 ''Snowland" Cotillion will hear
the defrosting, champagne music of
Howard Frederics and his vocalist,
N.B.C.'s Sonja Shaw, at 9 p.m. Sat- i
urday in the Pavilion.
Hard work by Sully Bruener, Bob I
Cole and their committee will turn |
the basketball gym into a near rep- i
lica of what a good ski environment 1
should be.
But the type of trumpet playing
that Frederics has been capable of
in the past as number one man for
Dick Jergens should destroy the il
lusion.
All this and Sonja too costs exact
ly $2.75 per couple, including tax.
The Sophomore Cotillion is an an
nual affair which has ordinarily
drawn some of the biggest bands on
the coast. Duke Ellington played in
1942. Now Excom's policy rules out
the really big band, but the band
committee for the 1943 affair did the
next best thing.
They have the men who made up
the top bands but never got the
glory collected into a new outfit.
