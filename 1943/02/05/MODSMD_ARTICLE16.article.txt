# Army Adopts Farm Program
## 
### 
A new type of physical condi
tioning program developed at Stan T
ford and declared to be superior to
standard Army methods is being
adopted by all Army units through
out the Northern California sector
of the Western Defense Command,
Maj. Gen. Walter K. Wilson, com
manding general, has advised Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur.
The physical fitness test and con
ditioning program was devised by
Dr. Arthur A. Esslinger, director of
physical education, and his associ
ates. It has been in use here since
fall.
When Dr. Esslinger first checked
Stanford students, he stated that
the health of Stanford men is far
better than any civilian group of
comparable age. The test also re
vealed that 20 per cent of the stu
dents were in such excellent physi
cal condition that they were eligible
to go into commando or paratroop di
visions and that 50 per cent of the
men were in good physical condi
tion, comparable to that of soldiers
who have been in training. Under
the rigid physical fitness test, only
30 per cent were found unfit for
modern warfare.
Health Improves
In a test conducted last fall, Dr.
Esslinger found that the health of
men who had participated in his
conditioning program for 10 weeks
had improved 25 per cent and that
the health of men in a group which
followed regular Army physical
training had improved only 4 per
cent.
The Esslinger program can be car
ried out either indoors or outdoors.

The men train for one hour a day
for six days a week. Fifteen minutes
of the hour is spent entirely in run
ning, in addition to calisthenics and
special "Guerilla" exercises which
simulate actual battle activities. Th<>
physical fitness test which precedes
the program measures strength, agil
ity, endurance, coordination, and
power.
Dr. Esslinger is now in Washing
ton, where he is assisting in estab
lishing schools for training officers
and men in the new techniques of
his physical fitness methods. He has
been commissioned a captain.
In announcing the acceptance of
the program, General Wilson said,
"In my opinion, this experiment
proved that the new type of physi
cal training advocated by Dr. Es
slinger is superior to standard Army
methods. The ultimate effect of this
contribution is impossible to esti
mate, but it is safe to say that it may
result in the saving of lives in stren
uous campaigns."
