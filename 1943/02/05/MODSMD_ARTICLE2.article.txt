# Soph 'Snowland' to Feature Sonja Shaw Tomorrow Night
## 
### 
''Snowland" opens its doors at 9
p.m. tomorrow at the Pavilion with
the music of Howard Frederics and
his orchestra, and the songs of
N.B.C.'s Sonja Shaw providing the
entertainment for what may be the
last Stanford Sophomore Cotillion
for the duration.
Decorating of the Pavilion begins
tonight, continuing all day tomor
row. Biggest problem for the soph
committee engaged in making a gym
nasium into a winter scene is get
ting evergreen boughs and other
forest decorations.
"It's probably the last Sophomore
Cotillion for the rest of the war,"
stated dance chairman Bill Eberle
last night in urging the campus to
support the dance.
'"Frederics' music comes to us
highly recommended, and Sonja
Shaw is recognized as one of the best
vocalists available in California. We
think that the combination will do
an excellent job of making up for
any bigger "name" band we might

have been hiring if this weren't
wartime."
The theme will be carried out as
a product of what the sophs think
Sun Valley looks like, with touches
of everything from Yosemite west
thrown in. Despite arguments ad
vanced that tuxedoed dancers will
look like penguins in the environ
ment of Antarctica, the "Snowland"
idea promises to be extremely dif
ferent from themes of previous
years. Tickets for the Sophomore
Cotillion are on sale today at the
A.S.S.U. office for 52.75 per couple,
tax included.
