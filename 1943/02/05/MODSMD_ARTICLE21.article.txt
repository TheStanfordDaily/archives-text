# Junior Hostesses To Hear Officer
## 
### 
"What's your major?"
"A louse.''
This is the incorrect way to start
a conversation with a soldier. This
and other things to do and not to do
are discussed in the training course
for junior hostesses given by the
USO group of the Y.VV.C.A.
Lieut. Lawrence Jansen of Moffett
Field will speak at today's meeting.
He will discuss junior hostesses
from the Navy's point of view.
The course consists of four one
hour meetings every Friday at 1
p.m. in the "Y" rooms. The first
discussion last Friday featured a
talk by Dean Mary Yost on conver
sation openers.
Miss Rosamund Clark and Miss
Patricia Davidson will be the speak
ers at the two final meetings. They
will discuss rules for the junior
hostess.
This course is one of many being
given throughout the nation to
train college girls and discusses the
need for hostesses and the problems
they meet.
At the completion of the training
the girls will receive certificates
showing they have finished the
course.
