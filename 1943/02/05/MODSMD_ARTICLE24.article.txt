# MORE TIPSY WALKERS KILLED

LOS ANGELES â€”In the annual
and eternal competition between
drunken pedestrians and drunken
drivers to run up the highest fatal
score, the tipsy walkers won out the
past year, according to Coroner
Frank A. Nelson's annual report to
the Board of Supervisors. Forty-one
tipsy walkers were killed by auto
mobiles during the year.

Don't drive on car tracks, warns
the National Automobile Club.
Tires have less traction on car tracks
and develop more heat than on
pavements. Heat tends to destroy
tires.
