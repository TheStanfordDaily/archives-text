# Farm Basketball Team Plays Gaels In Double Bill Tonight
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball team
meets one of the smallest and at the
same time the fastest teams in the
Bay Area when they tangle with St.
Mary's (the college) Gaels tonight
at 7:30 in Civic Auditorium, San
Francisco.
Playing before the U.S.F.-Santa
Clara matching that will wind up
the double-bill at 9 p.m., the Stan
fords will have plenty of trouble
with the Gael's guard Burke, who
paced the squad in a victory over
Santa Clara two weeks ago.
Everett Dean, Stanford mentor,
scouted the Gaels this week, re
porting that their speed made them
a distinct threat to his towering
Stanford players. Small and fast
players can sometimes slip through
where giants fear to lumber, so the
locals can afford to remember their
experience with Gene Rock of S.C.,
or. closer to home, they can cogitate
on the defense they would use if
they were to meet a squad which

had five Fred Linaris on it.
It poses a defense problem that is
more difficult for the taller Stan
fords than if they were to meet
someone on their own altitude.
No sports writer in the area, how
ever, seems to pick the Gaels to do
much damage to the Indians.
Leo McCaffrey missed practice
yesterday and was in the Rest Home
last night. Although he will prob
ably see some action tonight, Bones
Halstead will start at guard.
Which makes the Stanford lineup,
Linari and Jack Dana at forwards,
Ed Voss, center, and Howie Dallmar
and Halstead at guards. Opposing
are Burke and Mota at guards,
Strader at center, and Maestri and
Cerf at forwards for the Gaels.
