# Jack Dana, Indian Forward: Basketball's All-Around Guy
## 
### Dick Keusink 
boy, Jake has proved one of the
mainstays in Coach Dean's attack
this far in the race.
Jake saw action last season as the
team's most used substitute. He
played in a total of 28 games and
tallied an even 100 points from the
floor.
Court Deadcye
A deadcye on the court, standing
6 feet 4 inches and weighing 187
pounds, this is Jack's last year of
varsity competition. His strongest
point on the court is shooting. His
Dad (and he's at every game) can
tell you that "the boy has a one
handed push shot from the left of
the keyhole that can't be stopped."
Mr. Dana is Herb Dana, former
commissioner of the Pacific Coast
Conference. He ought to know.
Another phase of Dana's game is
his excellent backboard work. He's
hot on tip-in shots and is the player
that scored the winning goal against
Cal last week.
N.C.A.A. Player
Dana was one of the boys that
helped win the N.C.A.A. title for the
Indians last year. He stepped in and
took the place of injured Don Bur
ness and scored high in the finals
game of the playoffs. If he gets set
in mid-court it's a cinch two points.
Dana isn't only a basketball play
er. he's a STUDENT. Working in
the school of engineering he has a
B plus average. He's an all-around
guy.

Fifty million Americans live in
so callcd "target areas."
