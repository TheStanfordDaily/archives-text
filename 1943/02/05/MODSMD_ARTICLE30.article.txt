### 
Stanford's grueling gladiators put on a whacky show last night before a j
>ig crowd in the Pavilion as Ed McCain won the all-University heavy- i
veight title from Bob Dean in a bloody battle that saw Dean down for a
line-count in the first round.
McCain, who toiled on the gridiron year before last, dropped Dean with
hard right hook in the first round,â™¦

nd under collegiate rules, Dean
taved down for the regulation nine
ounts. Dean was back fast, but Mc-
Cain drew claret from his opponent's
lostrils with two more slugging
ights and won the bout going away.
Best bout of the evening came
rom the flying gloves of Botch Ca
uso and Gerald Ferrari, who stood
oe to toe in the all-U 175's for the
ull three rounds. Caruso's lightning
eft stabs caught Ferrari again and
gain. Ferrari kissed the canvas for
i nine-count in the third round, and
vhen the two came together to fin
sh the round Botch threw every- i
hing he had into a last-minute |
lurry to win a close decision and j
he Jack Dickey Memorial trophy at !
he same time.

Malcolm Mynderse siphoned his
ong arms into a whirl-wind finish
o outlast Bob Arthur in the 155
11-U. Mynderse is all arms and
egs and for the first two rounds was
lying desperately to keep out of his
>wn web. He finished fast to win.
Top Novice contest of the evening
ame the way of Harlan Gelderman,
vho worked like a windmill, flailing
Job Hall with rights and lefts after
fall had rocked him with a trio of
harp left jabs in the opening
ound.
Jack Reynolds annexed the IGS
lovice title from Bud Ackermann,
oasting the final round after the
irst two greatly winded him. Both
joys swung wildly, got nowhere for
he most part, but Reynolds was the
letter ducker, got in close once or
wice and carried the fight to his
>pponent.
Veteran Vic Wolcott, making his
irst ring appearance for some time,
ppeared badly out of shape and
vas upset by Tommy Milburn.
Hy Hebert won his third straight
'itcory over Bob Cole in the novice
35-pound class.
