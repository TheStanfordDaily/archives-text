# Change in Stamps
## 
### 
j"N conjunction with the merchants of Palo Alto,
L the Stamp Drive committee of the Stanford
War Board is today sponsoring Stanford Stamp
Day in Paly. Merchants will sell war bonds and
stamps at their counters, urging students and
•residents of Paly to take all of their change in
stamps.
This drive is probably the best way which
local merchants have of contributing to the war
effort, but it will require the willing co-operation
of both students and Paly residents in order to
succeed.
Stanford students are to be congratulated for
the excellent support which they, have been
giving to the Stamp and Bond drive, and more
particularly to the W.S.S.F. drive, but these
small monetary sacrifices are insignificant com
pared with the sacrifices of life, and physical
and mental health which soldiers are giving
overseas.
Take your change today in war stamps!—
