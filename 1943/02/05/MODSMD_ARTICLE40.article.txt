## IMPARTIAL JUDGMENT 
### 
The Editor, Sir:
Probably fewer issues on the campus have
been less open to impartial judgment than the
sorority question. To many of the girls who
have been happily affiliated for several years,
to the pledges who made a house during recent
rushing, and to many alumnae whose most
pleasant memories of the Farm are tied up with
houses on the Row, the abolition movement
seems unqualified. Conversely, those who have
been hurt by the system or those to whom
Stanford democracy means an all-out crusade
can't see anything else but outright abandon
ment.
Aware of the fact that letters like this that
establish two opposites and then fail to express
themselves on either of them are of little value
in promoting action, I still believe that we can
recognize certain bases for action on this ques
tion that both sides can recognize, and that the
resulting decision will be fairer if these factors
are taken into consideration.
First, Stanford as an institution is capable of
getting along without sororities, or fraternities
for that matter, without suffering in the slight
est. The fact is, and I don't mean it self-con
sciously or conceitedly, that this school is big
enough so that its aims are higher than the ex
istence of a particular living system. Abolition
or retention of sororities are at best second-rate
issues as far as the school as a whole is con
cerned. Let the resulting argument, then, take
its full course, but don't let it assume the time
or proportions of a life-or-death matter.
Secondly, as the situation stands, there is nof
a democratic feeling or situation existing in the
matter of women's living groups. Whether liv
ing in halls by choice (as many are) or by rea
son of an unfortunate rushing outcome, the
average hall resident, although living in what
are probably nicer physical quarters, does not
get an even break in the present social set-up.
In politics they do well, but to a woman, com
posed as they are, social life rates high, and it's
not democratic at the present moment here at
Stanford.
Finally, in the establishment of whatever new
plan is decided upon, the final decision should
be left until the future of women's living goups
at Stanford is decided. If they are to be off
campus for the duration in the event of military
occupation, they should not be asked to decide
finally now the question of sorority abolition.
The decision when made will stick. The deci
sion should not be made in a time when girls
are apt to vote in a short-range view, thinking
that it won't mean too much to them anyway
because of the war. The gal in 1983 is going to
be affected also, and while planning should go
ahead, her fate shouldn't be finally agreed upon
until we can be pretty sure of having the policy
established over a period of years.

istence of a particular living system. Abolition
or retention of sororities are at best second-rate
issues as far as the school as a whole is con
cerned. Let the resulting argument, then, take
its full course, but don't let it assume the time
or proportions of a life-or-death matter.
Secondly, as the situation stands, there is nof
a democratic feeling or situation existing in the
matter of women's living groups. Whether liv
ing in halls by choice (as many are) or by rea
son of an unfortunate rushing outcome, the
average hall resident, although living in what
are probably nicer physical quarters, does not
get an even break in the present social set-up.
In politics they do well, but to a woman, com
posed as they are, social life rates high, and it's
not democratic at the present moment here at
Stanford.
Finally, in the establishment of whatever new
plan is decided upon, the final decision should
be left until the future of women's living goups
at Stanford is decided. If they are to be off
campus for the duration in the event of military
occupation, they should not be asked to decide
finally now the question of sorority abolition.
The decision when made will stick. The deci
sion should not be made in a time when girls
are apt to vote in a short-range view, thinking
that it won't mean too much to them anyway
because of the war. The gal in 1983 is going to
be affected also, and while planning should go
ahead, her fate shouldn't be finally agreed upon
until we can be pretty sure of having the policy
established over a period of years.

The Editor, Sir:
Probably fewer issues on the campus have
been less open to impartial judgment than the
sorority question. To many of the girls who
have been happily affiliated for several years,
to the pledges who made a house during recent
rushing, and to many alumnae whose most
pleasant memories of the Farm are tied up with
houses on the Row, the abolition movement
seems unqualified. Conversely, those who have
been hurt by the system or those to whom
Stanford democracy means an all-out crusade
can't see anything else but outright abandon
ment.
Aware of the fact that letters like this that
establish two opposites and then fail to express
themselves on either of them are of little value
in promoting action, I still believe that we can
recognize certain bases for action on this ques
tion that both sides can recognize, and that the
resulting decision will be fairer if these factors
are taken into consideration.
First, Stanford as an institution is capable of
getting along without sororities, or fraternities
for that matter, without suffering in the slight
est. The fact is, and I don't mean it self-con
sciously or conceitedly, that this school is big
enough so that its aims are higher than the ex
istence of a particular living system. Abolition
or retention of sororities are at best second-rate
issues as far as the school as a whole is con
cerned. Let the resulting argument, then, take
its full course, but don't let it assume the time
