# 'Time to Come' Opens Tonight
## 
### 
The year 1919 . . . peace after the
First World War . . . flaming head
lines and social upheaval. Much of
this seething year is dramatized in
tonight and tomorrow night's pres
entation by the Stanford Players
of "In Time to Come."
Taking the lead as Woodrow Wil
son is Lionel Walford. Other prin
cipal characters are Clemenceau,
Grove Day; Mrs. Wilson, Natalie
Towle; Col. House, Paul Hostetler;
Senator Lodge, Gordon Peterson;
Orlando. B. Q. Morgan; Dr. Gray
son. Dick Martin; and Tumulty, Bob
Wheeler.
From the yellow pages of old
newspapers come some of the head
line events which are found in "In
Time to Come."
Sails for Paris
November 1918, the war ends and
immediately Wilson sails for Paris,
shattering precedent that no Presi
dent leaves the country during term
of office.
The Peace Conference meets in
January, 1919. and agrees to make
the League of Nations an integral
part of the Treaty. Then in March,
1919, 39 senators agree to vote
against the League of Nations.
Wilson falls ill in April, but the
Council of Four meets in the study
adjoining the sick-room with Col.
House acting for Wilson. The Ger

j man delegates are admitted to the
I Conference and the Italian minister
| walks out. A crisis arises over the
demands of the Japanese delegates.
Signed in June
In May the Treaty is presented to
the Germans at Verseilles, and in
June it is signed. Wilson sails for
the United States and lays the Treaty
I before the Senate in July.
Wilson stumps the countrv from

Ohio to California in September in
a last desperate appeal to the people
to join the League of Nations, and
in October he is stricken with paral
ysis and returns to Washington.
Thus actual happenings make a
vivid, dramatic story, a play which
has been chosen one of the 10 best
of 1941-42.
Quotes from some of Wilson's
speeches prove him an amazing
prophet, for, in his words:
Isolation Ended
"It is not an army that we must
shape and train for war; it is a na
tion . . . You have the alternative.
| armed isolation or peaceful partner
ship ... The recent war has ended
i our isolations."
! "I can predict with absolute cer
tainty that within another genera
i tion there will be another world war
if the nations of the world do not
concert to prevent it . . . But the
weapons Germany used were toys
compared with what would be used
j in the next war."
"I know that if by any chance we
j should not win this great fight for
1 the League of Nations, it would be
j the next generation's death warrant.
They would then have to fight the
final war, and in that final war there
would not be merely seven and a
half million men slain. The very
i existence of civilization would be
| in the balance."
