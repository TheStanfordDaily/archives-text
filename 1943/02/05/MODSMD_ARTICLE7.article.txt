### 
LONDON, Feb. 4, (U.R)â€”American
Flying Fortresses pounded North
west Germany by daylight today in
their second attack on A. Hitler's
harried home soil and shot down a
'"number" of planes from strong
enemy fighter formations which
tried to intercept them, a U.S. com
munique announced tonight.
The new raid came only eight day 3
after the initial all-American air
assault on Germany which blasted
Wilhelmshaven and Emden only a
few hours after a strong R.A.F. force
raided Hamburg by night, and left
Germany's greatest port flaming and
shattered from its 95th raid of the
war.
(Air raid alarms sounded in Ge
neva, Switzerland, and the fact thai
the Vichy radio left the air shorti\
before midnight suggested that the
R.A.F. again might be bombing th<.
continent Thursday night.)
(The London radio heard by tin
United Press in New York, reports
that radio stations in Southern Gei -
many also went oft' the air.)
The communique did not disclo><
the exact target, but the big fou
engined bombers were believed i.
have hit once more at the enemy
U-boat and port facilities. Heav;
cloud conditions made observation.-
of the raids difficult. Five Fortres.-.
failed to return from the raid, tin
communique said.
