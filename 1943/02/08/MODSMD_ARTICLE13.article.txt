# 'In Time To Come' Called A Poorly Fashioned Play
## 
### 
Lung an assailant of plays poorly transformed to moving pictures, I
regret having now to point out what should have been a moving picture—
or radio drama—poorly fashioned into a play.
. .For "In Time to Come," attempting to cover too much, though some-

what compensating witli projected♦
photographs and newspapers, was
nearly devoid of action, and worse,
of unity. The play was most at fault
last weekend; but also, except for
the costumes, makeup, and Girvan
settings, its production was inferior
to that excellence which theater
goers have come to expect of the
Stanford Players.
Lionel Walford, a plausible-look
ing Wilson, did some scenes very
well, particularly his dialogue with
Senator Lodge and his final tragic
appearance; but on the whole he
spoke too petulantly for the refined
President, and sometimes over-dra
matically for the desired effect.
The outstanding single perform
ance was B. Q. Morgan's brief ap
pearance as Orlando; and the best j
lead performance was Paul Hostet
ler's interpretation of Col. House.
An amazing makeup job was that
«>f Lloyd George and of Clemenceau,
whose roles Arthur Bestor and
Grove Day respectively accomplished
to their good credit. Also, Gordon
Peterson as Senator Lodge, Bob j
Wheeler as the secretary, and Allan I
Armer, the narrator, were all fairly j
beyond reproach.—Covey
