# Sadie Hawkins Dance Looms
## 
### 
Wake up, Daisy Maes, thar's a big
sassiety event a-comin'
Paul Law's mountain music (mod
ern style, natcherly) will come forth
from the Women's Gym from 9 to 1
Saturday night when Stanford's an
nual Sadie Hawkins Dance will be
taking place.
The day is fast approaching when
the presence of the "Stanford
Rough" on the Farm will be, like the
buffalo, a thing of the past and
modern descendants of the original
"500" will regret being born 30 years
too late. Our women still have a
period of grace before their men go
off to the wars. This is their last
big chance for a leap-year style date.
The dance is less than a week off.
Time is growing short. Call your
man and make a date. Get a ticket
at the AÂ»S.S.U. office for $1.10
(tickets have been selling fast for
campus dances this year, so hurry).
