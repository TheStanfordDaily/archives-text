# Gaels Triumph In Rough Game
## 
### 
The comeback kids got sidetracked
Friday night, as the midget St.
Mary's Gaels outroughed Everett
Dean's cagers to hand Stanford its
first defeat in their last four starts,
45-42. The melee was the crudest
seen in the Civic Auditorium this
year.
Leading 7-2 in the first few min
utes, the lanky Indians suddenly fell
apart and the Gaels pulled up to 9-9,
and then jumped into the lead on a
follow-up by center Angie Maestri.
The Deanmen looked as if they
might come back a few minutes
later, when Voss and Dallmar put
their height to use for a pair of tip
ins, leaving St. Mary's with a slim
32-29 margin seven minutes from
the gun.
Once again the Moragans went to
work on push shots from far out, but
the Cards kept even with a number
of close-in buckets to pull up to
35-37. Here sub guard Bill Hooper
sunk a follow to tie it up. but Burke
dumped one from 30 feet, Jim Baker
got a pair of goals, and it was all
over.
