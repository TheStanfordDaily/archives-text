# Now That Election
## 
### 
ONE of the largest single elections in Stan
ford's history will be held this week and
as yet few persons seem to realize it.
Twenty-six new officers—student body pres
ident, vice-president, sophomore, junior, senior,
and graduate man and woman members of Ex
com, five Men's Council and five Women's
Conference —will all be nominated and elected
between today and Wednesday.
The election period, one of the shortest ever
held, is another manifestation of wartime condi
tions at Stanford, where we have seen all cam
pus activities greatly speeded up. Although it
does have the advantage that students may fail
to realize how important the election is until it
is all over.
Everyone must realize that all nominations
must be made today, all declinations must be
in tomorrow, and everyone must vote Wednes
day.
It is the fervent prayer of the Election Board
that student participation in this election is bet
ter than that in the election on the amendments
when less than 10 per cent of the student body
cast a ballot.
Election Board has also emphasized that
everyone who wishes to run in the election
should do so. Utilizing the excellent system of
preferential balloting used in all A.S.S.U. elec
tions, the board will make up a list of the can
didates for each office ranked in the order of
balloting.
If the student elected is called out of school,
the next person on the list will be named in his
place. This will avoid the necessity of offices
being left vacant until a new election can be
held. It means also that many persons should
be nominated for each office so that there will
be good replacements in case one, or several,
of candidates is forced to leave school.
While the future college life of many, if not
all of us, is subject to many uncertainties, we
still have the responsibility to insure qualified
student leadership while we are here, and, if
we leave, to leave the government at Stanford
in capable hands. Widespread campus partici
pation in the election is absolutely necessary
to insure two things:
1) A large enough list of candidates for ev
ery office so that the second, third, and fourth
choices can be capable persons.
2) A large enough percentage of students
voting to insure the election of the best candi
dates.
To get maximum student interest, Election
Board has made it possible by the system out
lined above for everyone to be eligible to run
for office in the election. While members of
reserves or potential draftees are at Stanford,
they have the right of full participation in stu
dent body events.
Although the condensed election period may
take some immediate time and thought and we
may think that any election now is futile, we
should all give our full attention and support
for the next three days for it is very important

to ourselves and to the future of student govern
ment at Stanford.—Ferris Boothe

should do so. Utilizing the excellent system of
preferential balloting used in all A.S.S.U. elec
tions, the board will make up a list of the can
didates for each office ranked in the order of
balloting.
If the student elected is called out of school,
the next person on the list will be named in his
place. This will avoid the necessity of offices
being left vacant until a new election can be
held. It means also that many persons should
be nominated for each office so that there will
be good replacements in case one, or several,
of candidates is forced to leave school.
While the future college life of many, if not
all of us, is subject to many uncertainties, we
still have the responsibility to insure qualified
student leadership while we are here, and, if
we leave, to leave the government at Stanford
in capable hands. Widespread campus partici
pation in the election is absolutely necessary
to insure two things:
1) A large enough list of candidates for ev
ery office so that the second, third, and fourth
choices can be capable persons.
2) A large enough percentage of students
voting to insure the election of the best candi
dates.
To get maximum student interest, Election
Board has made it possible by the system out
lined above for everyone to be eligible to run
for office in the election. While members of
reserves or potential draftees are at Stanford,
they have the right of full participation in stu
dent body events.
Although the condensed election period may
take some immediate time and thought and we
may think that any election now is futile, we
should all give our full attention and support
for the next three days for it is very important

to ourselves and to the future of student govern
ment at Stanford.—Ferris Boothe
ONE of the largest single elections in Stan
ford's history will be held this week and
as yet few persons seem to realize it.
Twenty-six new officers—student body pres
ident, vice-president, sophomore, junior, senior,
and graduate man and woman members of Ex
com, five Men's Council and five Women's
Conference —will all be nominated and elected
between today and Wednesday.
The election period, one of the shortest ever
held, is another manifestation of wartime condi
tions at Stanford, where we have seen all cam
pus activities greatly speeded up. Although it
does have the advantage that students may fail
to realize how important the election is until it
is all over.
Everyone must realize that all nominations
must be made today, all declinations must be
in tomorrow, and everyone must vote Wednes
day.
It is the fervent prayer of the Election Board
that student participation in this election is bet
ter than that in the election on the amendments
when less than 10 per cent of the student body
cast a ballot.
Election Board has also emphasized that
everyone who wishes to run in the election
should do so. Utilizing the excellent system of
