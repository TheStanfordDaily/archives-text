# Nice Going, Sophomores
## 
### 
CLOSE to 1,000 persons attended last Satur
day night's well staged Sophomore Co
tillion and most of them seemed to be having a
good time. When official figures are in, the
crowd should egual or surpass the high-water
mark established two years ago at the Senior
Prom by Kay Kyser.
The Cotillion marked another step in a very
successful social quarter. It was just a year ago
that the on-campus dance policy had its incep
tion, and we remember the sparce attendance
and difficulties of the first juke-box and less
name-band dances.
But this year, and particularly this quarter,
has seen a new feeling at Stanford. Excellent
attendance at juke-box jigs as well as at dances
with lesser-name bands had made each occa
sion a social and a financial success. We all
appreciate the opportunities we have for en
joyment in this time of war, and we're making
the most of them.â€”Ferris Boothe
