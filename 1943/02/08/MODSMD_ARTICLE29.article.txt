The Editor, Sir:
I have recently noticed that the University
of California, in accordance with the general
speeding up of educational programs, has
awarded membership in the honorary fraternity
of Phi Beta Kappa to certain deserving mem
bers of the senior class.
It seems to me that similar action should be
taken at Stanford University before the close of
the Winter Quarter. Many seniors will be leav
ing to take up duties in the Army, Navy, or some
other branch of the service. It is only fair that
those who are qualified for the honor should be
granted recognition of that fact before they
leave school.
Sincerely,
L.J.P.

The Editor, Sir:
In "Our Hasher's" mumblings of last Thurs
day under the guise of a Gallup Poll, this nin
compoop trash-writing hasher inferred that Ellis
McKeller spends much time in the cellar, and
being the beautiful girl that she is, evidently,
she attracts hordes of men into the cellar.
We beg to differ with his views. We feel
that we spend just as much time in the cellar
and are just as beautiful as she is, and therefore
should be given credit for bringing twice as
many men into the cellar as does she. Inci
dentally, while the matter is at hand, if Miss
Ricker or the Union Board of Governors would
like to hire us to sit in the cellar all day in order
to increase their business, we would be be open
io their offers.
Irately,
Sue A. and Geraldine H.
