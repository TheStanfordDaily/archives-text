## Oarsmen Race Bruins April 17 
### Bill Rose 
The Stanford crew will meet
U.C.L.A. on April 17 in Los Angeles,
according to plans just concluded by
Coach Carl Pedersen and Coach Ben
Wallace of the Bruins. This is the
first race to be definitely scheduled
by the Farm oarsmen this year.
The Uclans would like to send
three shells — Varsity, Jaycee, and
Frosh—against the Indians. Until
more definite information is re
ceived concerning the calling of re
serves, however, it will be impos
sible to know whether Stanford will
be able to muster enough men to fill
three shells at the time of the race,
Pedersen said.
Most of the Indian canoemen are
members of the naval reserves.
As things now stand they will prob
ably not be called up until the end
of this school year. If this ruling
holds, the crew will have a near full
squad throughout the season anil be
able to fill its schedule.
A race with Coach A1 Ulbrickson's
Washington Huskies has been tenta
tively set for May 12, when the
northerners come down for their big
meet with Cal. The Bear-Husky re
gatta is definitely scheduled for May
15; so if the Washingtons can get
down a few days ahead of lime,
their meet with Stanford will go
through.
