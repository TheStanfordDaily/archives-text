## BASKETBALL Indians Vie With U.S.F. Dons Tonight, 7:30, San Francisco 
### Bill Hornby 
Stanford opens its most intensive week of varsity basketball against non
conference opposition tonight at 7:30 in Civic Auditorium, San Francisco,
against the University of San Francisco Dons.
Friday night the Indians meet Santa Clara in the Pavilion. The Broncs

The Coast Guard Surf Riders from.
San Francisco, not to be confused
with the Pollardized outfit stationed
at Alameda, play here Saturday
night.
Former Score
After their sole conference victory
against Cal, Stanford popped back
the next night to ride the Dons 56-
31. Fred Linari worked up the best
heat of the season that night, looping
17 points in the first half.
Could be that the Deanmen won't
do it again. Tabbed the "comeback"
kids after the big deal against Cal,
the varsity stumbled by two points
against the St. Mary's Gaels in Civic
Auditorium last weekend.
Don's Scoring
The Dons, despite their poor show
ing here, have even more with the
ball than the Gaels. For example,
statistics have been compiled by city
sportswriters for a mythical Bay
Area league, recording games played
between Stanford, Cal, St. Mary's
Pre-Flight, Alameda Coast Guard,
U.S.F., and Santa Clara.
Scoring rankings for these tilts
place three of the Dons from U.S.F.
well above the first Card listed. Ed
Voss. who stands about 10th with 28
field goals and 14 gift throws. The
superior trio are Dons Napolitano,
44-10; Asselin, 27-34; and Rodriguez,
40-16.
Not to mention Mushy Silver, one
of the best independent hoopers.
