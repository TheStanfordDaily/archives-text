## Farm Professor Discredits Marx, Co-Authors New Book 
### Ray Hayes 
"Marxians are all harking up the wrong tree!"
This is the hlunt conclusion reached hv 30 men. including Professor Her
bert Goldhamer of the Stanford Faculty, who have collaborated in the
writing of "Development of Collective Enterprise," a recently published
book which is expected with such provocations as the above to start much

argument.
Professor Goldhamer, co-author of
an important chapter entitled "So
cial Clubs and Fraternal Societies,"
and the other authors were selected
from 10 institutions of higher learn
ing, live branches of the federal
service and one private foundation.
Class Conflict
Development of Collective Enter
prise strongly states that socializa
tion movements, instead of being
helped, are being hindered by Com
munist, Socialist, and other parties
advancing Marx's doctrine of class
conflict.
With the declaration that labor,
as a producing class, has been of
minor importance in collectivist
movements in the past, the authors
claim that there no indications of an
increased importance in labor's fu
ture position.
Objectives Stated
Despite such controversial find
ings, the authors claim two general
objectives for their five-year investi
gation which is described not as a
symposium but rather as a "closely
articulated inquiry focussed on spe
cific problems and governed by a
common frame of reference."
(1) Determination, through an in
ductive study, of the basic factors in
the growth of collective undertak
ings, particularly in the United
States;
(2) An exposition of these under
takings as growing concerns, in
cluding the underlying controls, ad
ministrative patterns, financial poli
cies, personnel conditions, and, so
far as possible, their operational ef
ficiencies.
Collective Economy
It is the authors' wish that, "In
view of the great and accelerating
growth of collective enterprise, our
study may throw some light on the
dynamics of an emergent economy
destined to prevail in the future."
