# Democracy at 10 A.M.
## 
### 
WELL, we can hardly believe it, but here it
is the day before student body elections
again. And, as usual, there will be an assembly
held in the Memorial Auditorium between 10
and 11 a.m. to introduce candidates for the 25
student body offices which will open up to
morrow.
Twenty-five of the 77 people who will be up
on that stage this morning will be representing
3,200 Stanford men and women by sundown
tomorrow and it is our advice that you get up
there and see for whom you are voting before
you vote.
Of course, just a glimpse of these people is
not going to help you much in deciding how
well they will or will not represent you, we'll
admit that. But just the same you'll know that
these people are more than names on the
ballots.
In addition, there will be the added attrac
tion of seeing the candidates for President and
Vice-President come up to the front of the Audi
torium's stage to give those attractive little
speeches which have been so carefully pre
pared the night before. Then you will hear loud
applause, mull over the candidates in your
mind, and 24 hours later know for whom to vote.
Naturally, there will be no classes from 10
to 11 this morning and the Registrar's Office,
all Libraries, and even the Cellar will fe closed.
It was, according to Ed Stamrn, Stanford's
incumbent student body president, a lot of
trouble to arrange for this assembly. Further
more, since we are fighting for, or soon will be
fighting for, Democracy, both the present stu
dent body president and The Daily feel that we
ought to give this Democracy a break and par
ticipate in it at least passively.
So why not come around to the Auditorium
at 10 this morning? It'll be interesting.—B. Steif
