AS every Stanford man and woman who has
ever taken Western Civ. will know, the
Mills Board of Trustees got a good man when
they chose Dr. John T. White as their new presi
dent.
We will be sorry to see Dr. White leave
Stanford and our Western Civ. classes but at
the same time we will be glad to see him take
over a job that he can do well.
As he said in his acceptance statement, "No
man can take over the helm of a college these
stormy days, expecting smooth sailing in the
immediate future."
That certainly is true but also the connota
tion is true. The connotation that carries with
it the long range view on civilization and edu
cation and carries with it a faith in the future of
the world.
