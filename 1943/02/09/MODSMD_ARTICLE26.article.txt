One of the campus' smoother young men
openly admitted to the Paly police when they
questioned him concerning his bumping into a
telephone pole, that he was in the process of
planting one on his date when the car hit the
above-mentioned pole.
The girl involved, instead of being the shy,
retiring frail that a Stanford woman should be,
expressed the hope that the story would get in
all the city papers, but be sure to spell her
name right.
Our hedhash takes the other night off, and
sends one of the boys from his tong down to
sub. The meal goes along in a smooth fashion
until said sub walks out with the cream for the
desert resting in a pitcher in either hand, and a
cigarette drooping from his lower lip. He gets
all the way out to the head of the table before
he realizes his faux pas, whereupon he turns on
his heel and walks back into the kitchen drop
ping ashes into the cream on the way.
Naturally all the girls are giggling hilarious
ly, and the house mother is considerably per
turbed, natch., obv.
The question that arises in our mind is what
does it matter who is run for student body presi
dent, since none of them will be here over two
years more anyway. We'd vote for ourself, but
we're minus.
