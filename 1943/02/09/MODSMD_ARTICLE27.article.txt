The Editor, Sir:
Several copies of The Daily just arrived with
my mail here, somewhere in North Africa.
Naturally they were rather old, but not as old
as one would expect. They were at and after
the time of the Big Game (which was quite a
thrill to me, by the way).
But one thing hit me in the face. You are
constantly reminding each other that you must
get behind the war effort. There must have been
at least a dozen drives for money for something
or other. And, per the usual tactics, statistics
from each house and hall were quoted to try
and shame the backward children into "doing
their part."
You people are supposedly adults, at least
mentally if not chronologically, and should
know what your duty is. If that constant prod
ding is necessary, it means one of two things
to me. Either you are not behind the war effort
(and I refer to the "good old days of isolation
ism" with tears in my voice) or you have not
the intelligence and sense of responsibility of
a 10-year-old child.
Since I refuse to believe either of these
choices, I take the other alternative: That the
prodding is not only unnecessary but an insult
to your intelligence. We over here know and
you know yourselves that you will do anything
and everything to help. But being treated like
an infant is enough to make anyone rebel, I
know; I am in the Army.
I am not writing this just to be critical. I will
admit I always wanted to write a letter to the
editor while I was at Stanford but never had
much to say. But there is a better reason for
this: Stanford means a hell of a lot to me and I
hate to see the student body treated like a
bunch of children. You know people from your
own class, your friends, from your own family
even, who are now in the midcle of the thing.
If that and the country we are fighting for is
not enough of a cause, an all-campus drive will
never inspire you to greater heights.
Show that you are doing your part not be
cause it is stylish to do so nor because you are
shamed into it. Rear up on your hind legs and
tell whoever it is you can do your share and a
hell of a lot more without any prodding.
