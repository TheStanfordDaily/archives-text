ON THE SOUTHERN TUNISIA
FRONT, Feb. 8 (U.R)—Crack units of
Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's j
Afrika Korps have been rushed to
Faid Pass in Central Tunisia where ;
they are defending that strategic !
point against American troops seek- j
ing to push through to the coast, it i
was revealed today.
This is the first reported contact
between Rommel's army and the j
Americans, although U.S. troops •
have fought other German forces at
a number of points on the Tunisian j
front.
Some of Rommel's best troops i
were withdrawn in the vanguard of j
the bulk of the Afrifla Korps, given
fresh equipment to offset their losses ;
in Egypt and Libya, and sent to the
Faid area.
The maneuver was believed to I
show the importance German com- '
manders attach to the Pass as a key i
point in the line of height they hold ;
parallel to the Mediterranean coast
to protect Rommel's communica- j
tions with upper Tunisia.
