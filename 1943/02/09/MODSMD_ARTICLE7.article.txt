### Newt Wise 
Total contributions amounting to
$1,271.78 for the World Student
Service Drive were announced last
night by Lucian Rice, drive chair
man.
In a letter to The Daily. Rice said.
"I would like to take this oppor
tunity to thank the student body of

Stanford for their generous accept
ance of the World Student Service
Fund Drive. The contribution of
$1,271, while not achieving our goal,
was as good a total as could have
been reasonably expected, consider
ing the fact that the drive was en
tirely new on campus, that we were
given little time to preapre for it
and that so many demands for con
tributions are made on one's pocket
book today."
