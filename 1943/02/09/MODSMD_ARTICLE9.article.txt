# TUES. EVE
## String Quartet Plays Tonight 
### 
Stanford music lovers have an op
portunity to hear a particularly well
rounded program tonight when the
San Francisco String Quartet pre
sents a Tuesday Evening Series re
cital at 7:30 in Memorial Auditorium,
Initial number of the program,
1 Haydn's Quartet in D major, Opus
76, No. 5, is most inspiring in the
| celebrated Largo, perhaps the deep
! est of this 18th century master's
! compositions. The quartet is the last
; and most famous of Haydn's 83 com
positions in this category,
Brahms' Quartet
Strikingly contrasted to the Haydir
| opening in its emotional character,
! typical of Brahms' stormy, youthful
period, is the second offering, Quar
tet for Piano and Strings in C minor,
Opus 60. Product of German ro
manticism, the Scherzo of this group
is particularly effective in its vi
j brance and activity.
Reflective, melodic Alexander
Tscherepnin, beloved composer of
Russian life, has put the qualities of
his own personality into "The Offer
ing of the Blessed Therese of the
Child Jesus," an old style prayer.
This will be the third number on
ihe program.
Beethoven Finale
The last piece is the musical ex
| pression of the later period in Lud
-1 wig van Beethoven's tempestuous
life. Quartet in C major, Opus 59,
No. 3, more commonly known as the
Eroica quartet.
It blends the indomitable spirit o£
; the man, especially in the finale,
i which assumes the form of a colos
sal fugue surpassing perhaps the
excellence of Bach himself.
The concert begins sharply at 7:3$
p.m.
This is the San Francisco String
Quartet's first appearance at Stan
lord this year. The Quartet is we: r
known on the West Coast, however,
i and the Public Exercises Committee
• expects a large audience.
