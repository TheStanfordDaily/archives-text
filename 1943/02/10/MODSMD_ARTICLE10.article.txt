# Elections Today Are First Governed By Revisions Adopted for Duration
## 
### 
Students vote today for the first
time under a new system recently
adopted by amendments to the
A.S.S.U. Constitution. The revisions
which were approved by the student
body on Jan. "20 were adopted as a
workable plan for the duration and
not as a drastic lasting revision, ac
cording to members of the Execu
tive Committee.
In order to put the new system
into practice the Excom proposed
for student approval that officers,
usually elected Spring Quarter, be
elected this quarter in what was to
be called an "A" election. Officers
usually elected in Winter Quarter,
half-way through the three-quarter
year were to be elected in "B" elec
tions Spring Quarter and would also
serve three-quarter terms.
Both elections are being held today
so that the approved amendments
may be put into practice immedi
ately.
Duration Plan
The plan, which student govern
ment will operate under for the
duration, provides for a three
quarter term for A.S.S.U. officers and
assures staggered shifts, but does
not require a summer election, at a
time when the enrollment is ordi
narily low.
Although it was generally agreed
by members of Excom that repre
sentation on a class basis was ap
parently outmoded, the committee
decidcd to retail the former method
end titles for convenience. Mem
bers under the change will be ac
tually members at large because the
whole student body is voting 011

( them today.
Under the new 'system in case of
the resignation or disqualification of
the president or nonregistration of
;my other member of the Executive
Committee, the remaining members
have the power to appoint a succes
sor who shall serve until the next
regular elections to that office or un
til the absent member returns to
serve the remainder of his original
term. The successor chosen will be
the runner-up in the original elec
tion.
Men's Council
! In case of vacancies on Men's
I Council, the Executive Committee
| and the remaining members of the
j council, voting together, will have
i the power to appoint a successor,
| who shall serve until the next regu

j absent member of Men's Council re
j turns to serve the remainder of his
j original term.

com without vote: Editor of The
Stanford Daily; Student Manager;
Chairman of Men's Council: Chair

of Women's Conference; and Coordi
