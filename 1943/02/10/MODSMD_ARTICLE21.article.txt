mer research associate in chemistry
and physics at Stanford, w;is re
leased from a San Francisco jail
Monday when Stanford students,
friends, and faculty members raised
the necessary $1,000 bail. Checks
ranging from $75 to $150 were con
tributed.
Dr. De Vault was being held on
draft evasion charges for a grand
jury hearing next week. â€¢
On being questioned in regard to
the stand he was taking, De Vault
replied he was "a Christian and be
liever in the teachings of Jesus
Christ. I admire anyone who is
doing what he thinks is right. I ap
preciate what the suffering soldiers
must undergo," he added.
He said he was willing to drive an
j ambulance under civilian direction,
i The absence of church membership
! is considered by De Vault's draft
board as a barrier to his classifica
tion as a conscientious objector.
De Vault is represented in the ac
-1 tion by Allen H. Barr, attorney foi
the Northern California Service
Board for Conscientious Objectors
; an organization 'sponsored by groups
! of Quakers, Mennonites and other
sects opposed to war.
Barr said that his organization has
I already interceded in cases of 5.001
j draftees whose principles are similar
to those of De Vault, and that ol
J these, 150 Californians have been as
i signed to the civilian public servici
I camp at Glendora.
