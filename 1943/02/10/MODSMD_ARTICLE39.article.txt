# Farm Carries On Book Drive

### 
There is little that American boys
I in Army camps and in the far-flung
outposts of our battlefronts look
forward to more than letters from
home, but they also appreciate re
! ceiving less personal reading mate
j rial from homeâ€”good books.
The national 1943 victory book
campaign is being carried on this
| month and contributors all over the
country are well on the way to
eclipsing last year's record.
Profiting from last year's mistakes,
however, when many of the dona
tions were of such unsuitable caliber
as 1910 primers and dog-eared ele
mentary school books, the lead
ers of this years campaign are
emphasizing the quality as well as
the quantity of the books donated,
Detective stories, humorous books,
! and books about present day affairs,
| such as "The Raft," "They Were
Expendable," "Assignment in Brit
| tany," and "Russians Don't Sur
j render," have proved popular so far.
Look over your library for eon
i tributions, but leave the attic for
| the scrap drive. Contribute books
| that you would like to read your
iself; follow the example of many
who have bought books which they
| have been wanting to read, and after
j reading them, have contributed them
I to the victory drive.
The campus collection center is
! in the Bookstore.
