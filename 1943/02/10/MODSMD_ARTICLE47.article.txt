# Nurse's Aides Begin Practical Training in Palo Alto Hospital
## 
### 
No Stanford woman wants to |
watch the rest of the world go by.
That's why so many graduates have |
gone into the WAVES and WAACS.
That's why more and more coeds are
I assuming an active responsibility in J
in campus war work.
Last weekend 14 Stanford Volun
teer Nurse's Aides began their j
practical training in the wards of the
Palo Alto Hospital. They had just
I finished 35 hours of discussion and
demonstration in evening and Fri- j
day afternoon classes at the Worn- j
en's Gymnasium. They were anx
ious to start working, but they were
j frankly scared to death.
i Borrow Uniforms
Pictures of famous personalities in
tricky Nurse's Aides uniforms flew
out the window at the very dark
hour of six in the morning, Saturday.
The students' own uniforms hadn't
| arrived and graduate V.N.A.'s had
lent their extra white blouses and
blue jumpers to help in the emer
gency.
Consequently the skirts hung way
below their knees and waists were
too tight or too loose. Oblivious of
the poor fits, proud coeds glanced
at their spotless white "nurse's"
shoes, the white cotton stockings,
patted their volunteer badges,
checked to see if the watch with a
minute hand was in their pocket,
; and then crept quietly down the
stairs to unlock the door and let
themselves out into a dark and foggy
morning.
Enthusiasm Returns
Six hours later they came home
smelling of rubbing alcohol and tinc
j ture of green soap, dead tired, but
no longer nervous. The strangeness
of the new surroundings had worn
off during the morning and their
enthusiasm foi f the work had come
back with new vigor.
These V.N.A.'s will work under
supervision in the hospital for 45
hours before they receive their pins
at the graduation exercises conduct
ed in March by the Palo Alto Chap
ter of the American National Red
Cross. Then they will continue to
work a minimum of 150 hours a
; year to help meet the emergency in
civilian hospitals, emergency field
units, and health organizations where
crippling shortages of graduate
nurses are being suffered.

No Stanford woman wants to |
watch the rest of the world go by.
That's why so many graduates have |
gone into the WAVES and WAACS.
That's why more and more coeds are
I assuming an active responsibility in J
in campus war work.
Last weekend 14 Stanford Volun
teer Nurse's Aides began their j
practical training in the wards of the
Palo Alto Hospital. They had just
I finished 35 hours of discussion and
demonstration in evening and Fri- j
day afternoon classes at the Worn- j
en's Gymnasium. They were anx
ious to start working, but they were
j frankly scared to death.
i Borrow Uniforms
Pictures of famous personalities in
tricky Nurse's Aides uniforms flew
out the window at the very dark
hour of six in the morning, Saturday.
The students' own uniforms hadn't
| arrived and graduate V.N.A.'s had
lent their extra white blouses and
blue jumpers to help in the emer
gency.
Consequently the skirts hung way
below their knees and waists were
too tight or too loose. Oblivious of
the poor fits, proud coeds glanced
at their spotless white "nurse's"
shoes, the white cotton stockings,
patted their volunteer badges,
checked to see if the watch with a
minute hand was in their pocket,
; and then crept quietly down the
stairs to unlock the door and let
themselves out into a dark and foggy
morning.
