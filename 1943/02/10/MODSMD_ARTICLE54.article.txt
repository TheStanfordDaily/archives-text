# Indian Baseball Nine to Play Yerba Buena Receiving Ship
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball team faces the Yevba Buena Receiving Ship nine at
3 on the Sunken Diamond today. This marks the second meeting of the
Indian nine and the Navy team, and the Stanford men are out to avenge
their 2-1 defeat of last time.
Quite a lew members of the team have gone into some branch oi the

armed services, but Coach Harry,
Wolter feels that if the team keeps
working they will shape up into a
fairly good ball club. One of the
major changes that the war has
made this year is in the use of
freshmen. Tomorrow's starting line
up includes four freshmen: Jack
Bronson, Bob Brown, Owl Flatland,
and Jay McKie.
Coach Wolter plans to use the
following team:
Catcher Ward Walkup: pitcher,
Bill Brokaw (Harry Mason will be
the relief pitcher); first base, Ray
Hammett; second base, Jack Bron
son; third base, Jay McKie; short
stop, Bob Brown; left fielder, Ed
Washburn; center fielder, Lee Scott;
right fielder, Owl Flatland.
