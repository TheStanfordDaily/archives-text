# Vote Today
## 
### 
STANFORD votes today under a newly
amended system of student government de- '
signed to carry campus organizations through
the war.
It is probably true the student vote at the
recent amendment election was light because ,

it was generally agreed the amendments were
necessary.
Whether this was true or not will be deter
mined by the interest the student body shows
in voting today. The success of the new sys
tem will depend on the interest and support
given it by students. The severe effect of the
war on student government can be increased
or lessened according to the interest shown in
the new system.
The new system appears to be practical. The
test of this depends upon our efforts to put it
successfully into practice. Our first move in
this direction should be by voting today.
