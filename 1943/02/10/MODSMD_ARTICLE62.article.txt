When the sun was well-nigh overhead, and
little clusters of student body were well-nigh
trickling out of classrooms and turning their
well-nigh heads toward their respective living
groups for a snack of lunch, Kelly Ross, former
stalwart lineman in the Periclean Age of foot
ball at Stanford (when Coach Clark was here),
was winging his way back to a secret Naval Air
Corps training base happy in the knowledge
that he had delivered a package to his true love
in the most chivalrous method possible.
It was he who swooped down over the Stan
ford campus, the Phi Gam tong in particular,
several times shortly before well-nigh noon,
and dropped a parachuted package onto the roof
of that white colonial mansion at the top of the
Piow. On that package was a note to the bros to
deliver the package to his moll who lives in the
house across the street.
Say, what ever happened to sororities?
The following is a paid political announce
ment: Vote for in alphabetical order Ferris
Boothe, Rocky Mason, Government Marshal
(write in Bill Joslyn), Roland Tornqust for stu
dent body president. Also anyone else who
comes to mind.
A late bulletin from Rockwell has just come
in to the effect that little kids have been pop
ping into the Phi Gam tong all afternoon want
ing to know whatinhell was in the parachuted
package. We won't tell.
