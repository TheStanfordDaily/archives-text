The Ediior, Sir:
From the rather complete coverage of Encina,
Toyon, Branner, Sequoia and other parts of
the campus with printed campaign cards, it is
apparently necessary to call to the attention of
at least one of the candidates for the A.S.S.U.
presidency Article IV, Section 2, part g of the
Constitution and By-Laws of the Associated Stu
dents, which reads as follows:
g. There shall be no expenditure of money
for campaign purposes. There shall be no
written carrpaigning of any type. There shall
be no publication or distribution of any cam
paign material on the campus other than that
contained in The Stanford Daily.
Ignorance of the exsting rules is hardly an
excuse for the flagrant violation which has
been made. Any person running for the office
of president of the Associated Students should
certainly be familiar wilh the rules and regu
lations regarding campaigns which appear in
that organization's Constitution.
