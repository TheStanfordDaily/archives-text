## Hundred Students Affected by Order 
### Bill Coughlin 
The Army Air Corps has an
nounced that members of its En
listed Reserve are now being called
to active duty due to "the exigen
cies of war." Some Stanford stu
dents in the Air Corps Reserve have
already received their orders and
have left school.
In a letter to Chancellor Wilbur,
Maj. Willis S. Fitch, deputy chief of
procurement, the aviation cadet sec
tion, Army Air Force, stated that all
members of the Air Corps Enlisted
Reserve will be called in the imme
diate future except those who have
commenced a semester, term, quar
ter before Dec. 31. Stanford's cur
rent quarter began Jan. 5.
Basic Training
It is planned that after a short
period of basic training many of the
men called .will,, be returned to a
selected college or university.
There are approximately 100 Stan
ford students enlisted in this reserve.
The Air Corps has expressed the
hope that the University will feel
that the additional scholastic train
ing given by them will sufficiently
approximate that of Stanford to
award to the student the quarter's
work he would have done had he
been allowed to finish.
Continue Studies
Dean of Men John Bunn advises
students to remain in school and
continue with their studies until in
dividual orders to report are re
ceived.
"It is not possible for them to call
all the members of the reserve at
once. The orders will be staggered.
Some students may even be allowed
to finish the quarter," he said.
Later Call
Members of the Air Corps Reserve
who are in schools which began
their current term before Dec. 31
will not be called until the end of
