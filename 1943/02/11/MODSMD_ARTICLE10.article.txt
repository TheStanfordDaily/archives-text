"Ballots and the Democratic Class
Struggle," by Dewey Anderson and
Percy E. Davidson has recently been
published by the Stanford Press.
Dr. Davidson is a professor emeri
tus of Stanford, and Dr. Anderson
was formerly a member of the Cali
fornia legislature and later in charge
of the State Relief Administration.
Their book, which presents the
findings of an objective investigation
which indicates that our path should
be through practical compromise
based on the self-interest of the
groups which make up our elec
torate, illustrates that while party
affiliation is a personal matter, oc
cupational influence is powerful in
groups.
