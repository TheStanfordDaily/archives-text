# Daisy Maes Urged To Get Dance Dates
## 
### 
"Any woman is a fudger who isn't
asking a man to the Sadie Hawkins
dance this Saturday night from 9
to 1 in the Women's Gym if she went
to the Sophomore Cotillion last
weekend." Thus baldly did Vernice
Hines, dance chairman', give her
opinion and incidentally the opinion
of all Cotillion escorts.
Tickets for $l.lO are on sale in the
A.S.S.U. office and the 500 women
who (should) answer Miss Hines'
challenge are reminded that there
are only three days left before the
dance.
In past years costumes have been
fashioned from old dresses by cut
ting off the hems to get a hill-billy,
jagged, above-the-knees appearance,
or by unevening the legs of a pair
of jeans and sprinkling on vivid
patches. Prospective Daisy Maes
have huddled into sewing bees a*d
come out with typical decolette polka
dot blouses, long braids, and freck
les. They've even assembled cor
sages of onion sprouts and carrot tops
for their Lil' Abhers.
This year there has been some
dissention as to the advisability of
cutting up perfectly good clothes for
one evening of Dogpatch revelry.
After much thought, Cardinals,
sponsors of the dance, have come to
the conclusion that the dresses that
did last year can do this year. If
they aren't available just temporari
ly take up the hem on another dress
â€”this will have the same effect.
Fortunately the recent rationing
of shoes will be little or no drawback
to dance costumes. Hob-nailed
boots are out of order for the men,
anyhow, for the benefit of gymnasium
floors, and Daisy Maes just don't
wear shoes.
