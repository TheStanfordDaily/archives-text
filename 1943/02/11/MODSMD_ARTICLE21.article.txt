# Fire, R.O.T.C. Units Hold Drill
## 
### 
The Stanford Fire Department and
the Stanford R.O.T.C. units held
their first organized air raid drill of
the present quarter last night. R. 0.-
T.C. units and the Fire Department
worked together in simulated fire
and air-raid disaster drills. R.O.T.C.
batteries were assigned stations and
told bow to proceed in ease of an
actual air raid on the campus.
Fire Chief Marsten termed the
drill "a success" as far as the fire
fighting units were concerned.
"I was especially pleased with the
large turnout," commented Chief
Marsten.
