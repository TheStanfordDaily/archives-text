# Army Gives Shoes to Soldiers, Causes U.S. Civilian Rationing
## 
### 
"When the army takes seven pairs of shoes for every soldier and it plans
on an Army of 11 million men, that plus the lease-lend requirements ex
plains why there is shoe rationing." according to Mr. John Wideman, gen
oral manager of Wideman's Clothing Store.
"One of our manufacturers is making 5,000 pairs of shoes a day for the

army," he continued. "I don't know<
how many shoes a day they can j
make, but that is still an awful lot I
of shoes, which doesn't leave many ;
for civilian consumption."
Talking about the Army, he said
that none of the employees in the [
store had actually gone into the serv
ices, "although there had been
threats."
Aviation Mechanics
"Last September when I was elig- j
ible," he said, "I started taking a
course in aviation mechanics so that
I could get into the air corps ground
force. I wanted to get into the serv
ices of supply, of course, since 1
know something about it, but it was 1
tilled up. In January, however, they [
changed my classification to 4H, too
old, but I'm still taking the course. ;
"As one of our war activities," he ;
declared, "we are giving our 'cuts' ;
to the American Red Cross. That j
means, we give the Red Cross the |
clippings from the cuffs of the suits i
which we sell. We send over 75 to j
100 pounds of wool cuts every two j
or three weeks instead of selling j
them.
Emergency Blankets
"The Red Cross is making emer- |
gency blankets from the larger
pieces, and it is selling the smaller j
ones to be reprocessed. These emer
gency blankets are made from j
squares of wool material sewn to- i
gether.
"The wool to be reprocessed is
then broken down to yarn again,
bleached, sterilized, redyed, and j
then rewoven. It is generally mixed :
with an equal or slightly higher per- ;
centage of new wool. Reused wool 1
is wool that has been treated in the !
same way, but which has been used, |
as distinguished from the new re
processed wool.
Better Quality
"Incidentally," he said, "the re- '
processed and reused wool clothes !
are now probably of a better quality
than the virgin wool clothes.
"Most of the long, fine wool which
was used for manufacture here was j
imported from Australia. Due to the
war. very little of such wool can
low be imported. We do, of course,
produce some wool here, but chiefly j
,n Montana, Oregon, and Washing
ton, but it is a shorter, thicker wool |
which has. been used mainly there
fore for carpets.
"What this will mean to the con
sumer," he said, "is that tweeds, be- i
cause they can be made of short j
wool, will be plentiful, while worst- j
eds and other smooth woolens will j
oe scarce because the long wools
must be used for their manufacture.
Rayon Added
"To supplement the supply of long
wool, rayon will be added. Thus, j
long wool suits will not be all wool, i
In fact, they have not been so made
for some time.
"One reason .that there is such a
shortage of wools is that the uni- j
lorms for the armed services are
made of wool, which further reduces j
the supply available for civilian j
use.
Ties Hard to Get
"For instance," he explained,
"there will be no more all-wool
.•obes. Men's hosiery is being made
nf cotton and rayon. Ties are espe
cially hard to get because they are
made of a wool and silk mixture, and
here is a shortage of both.
"As for sweaters, they ai'e being j
node of South American wool. This
means that the wool is wiry, and the !
sweaters, although they are made of
wool exclusively, will feci as though j
hey had been made of a wool and '
•ayon mixture. These sweaters, how- I
ever, are durable and wear very ,
A ell. All sweaters which are made j
>( Australian wool are now marked. :
>. nmarked sweaters, are made from I
the South Anierican wool."
