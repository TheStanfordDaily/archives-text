# Last Half of Stamp Drive Begins Today
## 
### 
Today marks the beginning of the
last half of the War Stamp and Bond
Drive for Winter Quarter. In order
to top last quarter's total sales, ap
proximately $5,500 worth of stamps
and bonds will have to be sold in
the remaining five weeks of the
drive, according to the stamp com
mittee reports.
This week, Virginia Patterson,
head of Quad stamp books, is asking
that each student buy one stamp on
Quad, either at English corner, En
gineering corner, the Libe, or the
Cellar.
"If each student would buy a
stamp at a booth and one in his liv
ing group, the stamp sale total would
surpass the $1500 mark," said Miss
Patterson.
Salesmen in each house are re
quested to turn their reports in to
their chairman, John Thayer, fra
ternities; Diane Holmes, sororities;
Beverly Brokaw, Lagunita; Betsy
Rabbitt, Roble; Neva Haight, Union
unit; Bill Rose, men's halls, and
Nona Oppenheimer, Ventura, not
later than 7:30. This deadline is
necessary so that the chairmen can
compile their reports by 8 p.m.
