Some years ago people would sell
subscriptions to papers, or else pay
fabulous prices to go on tours from
the West Coast to New York to wit
ness an athletic contest. Those that
lived in the East would pay enor
mous sums to buy a ticket. But to
night, it comes to the Stanford stu
dent free.
Not long ago — before Joe Louis
started to K.O. pugs with noncha
lant rapidity—a world's heavyweight
match was a big occasion. Perhaps
that is due mainly to the fact that a
champ has to defend his title but
once in six months.
A lot of you probably remember
the big exodus of western people
to the East to see Max Baer box,
and to see him take the title away
from Primo Carnero.
But now, wearing the khaki of the
U.S. Army, and going by the title
of Private Max Baer, the former
world's champ has offered his serv
ices for tonight's bouts. By all
methods of reasoning, the Pavilion
hould be bulging, not only because
all you need is your student body
card, but because Baer is still a good
boxer, a good showman, and still the
idol of many ring followers.
Don't expect any wild swinging or
hard K.O. punches between the for
mer champ and Vic Lindskog. It is
only an exhibition, and in exhibi
tions, nobody is supposed to get
hurt. But then, many remember the
exhibition between Kingfish Levin
sky and Baer.
That boxing at Stanford is popu
lar cannot be denied, if the large
crowd at the All-University and
Novice Tournament is any indica
tion of how the students go for the
sport.
Bob Leaver, former boxer on the
varsity squad, was a B.A.C. cop for
the All-U bouts.
