# Max Baer Will Box Lindskog At Exhibition
## 
### 
Featuring an exhibition between |
Max Baer. former world's heavy- >
weight title holder, and assistant i
coach Vie Lindskog, the Stanford |
boxing team meets the San Jose !
State Spartans tonight at 8 p.m. in '
the Pavilion.
Baer, now a private in the Army,
and stationed at Camp Tanforan,
will also referee the last five bouts ;
on the program. Head boxing coach,
Harry Maloney, will referee the ex- :
hibition between Baer and Lindskog. ;
Caruso Meets Smith
One of the best bouts of the night
will be in the 165-lb. weight class, j
when Botch Caruso, winner of the ;
Dickey Trophy in the All-U's, will ,
meet Stan Smith, clever Spartan
pugilist. Smith is the only one on i
Tiny Hartranft's squad that had any
intercollegiate experience before this [
year.
Caruso looked good in decisioning I
Gerald Ferrari in the All-U's, and ;
will be a good match for Smith. |
Caruso, who packs a lot of power in I
his snap punches, usually doesn't |

bother to block most of the blows
on defense, but rather counters, or
takes them on the body.
Ferrari will also get a chance to
hit the win column when he takes
on Wayne Fontes. In the bouts with
Cal Aggies, Fontes sidestepped his
opponent neatly, then dropped him
for a first-round K.O. win.
Knockout Specialist
Another knockout specialist for
State is Bob Creighton, who won a
third round K.O. against the Aggies.
Bob Dean, Indian heavy, will match
his wits with Creighton, and after
the fine showing Dean made against
Ed McCain last week, this bout
seems to be a natural.
Novice Champion Dick Pehl will
meet "Swede" Hensley in the other
heavyweight bout of the evening.
Ross Dana, conqueror of Gordon
Durham in the All-U tournament
last week, will meet George Thomas
in a light-heavyweight battle. Dana
is a cool, smart boxer, and should
do well against the very capable
Thomas.
Arthur for Stanford
A former San Jose State student,
Bob Arthur, will wear the Stanford
colors tonight, and go against his
former schoolmate, Orlyn Gire, at
155 pounds. Also at the same weight,
John Levy will tangle with Tom
Griffin.
Johnson Chinn makes his return
to the ring tonight against Tony
Lavaglia, who is a smart boxer, so
the match should be good, for Chinn,
too, is a boxer, not a fighter.
Moving up in weight. Bob Cole
will be in the second welterweight
bout. Cole managed to weigh in at
135 pounds last week, but has not
been able to make the weight this
week, and will meet Bob Watson,
State welterweight.
Hebert in Opener
In the curtain raiser, Hy Hebert,
only Gene Tunney Award winner on
the squad, will meet Don Haas, fast
improving lightweight who has filled
in for Gus Roque.
Bill Weeks will referee the first
five bouts.
Men from the Page Mill Camp
and from Moffett Field will be
guests of Stanford at the bouts.
Maloney has announced that plans
are now under way for a match with
the Camp Tanforan boxing team,
coached bv Baer.
