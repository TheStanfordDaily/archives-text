## Cards to Meet Santa Clara, Surf Riders, in Weekend Tilts 
### 
Stanford's varsity cagers will have
a long row to hoe this week-end
when they play the University of
Santa Clara and the Coast Guard
Surf Riders (not the Alameda quin
tet) on successive nights.
Friday night the Cards meet the
high-flying Santa Clara five. Santa
Clara has a forward named Stan
Patrick and a guard named Carl
Schroven that the Cards will have
to keep an eye on.
Tuesday night up in San Fran
cisco against the San Francisco Don*
the Cards made just too much of an
effort. The Civic Auditorium floor
always has been a jinx to the Stan
lord basketballers, and starting with
out Leo McCaffery the Indians went
for the Dons too hard.
DONS MUCH SMALLER
Playing against a much smaller
team the Indians were run all over
the court and in an attempt to
make a good showing on the floor
the Cards played too close to the
Dons and wore themselves out. Ed

Voss, big Stanford center, garnered
three personal fouls on himself af
ter trying to keep the Dons from
hitting the bucket too much.
But this week-end on the home
court it ought to be different. The
Cards know their own backboard
and have been hitting it in practice.
Both strings have looked especially
good in scrimmage and the Stan
fords ought to hit the win column
again this week.
SA'I URDAY'S GAME
On Saturday night the home team
will meet the Surf Riders. Not much
is known about the visitors' club
except that they have won lfi in 13
starts. They came within four poinl'
of beating the St. Mary's Pre-Flight
and Hank Luisetti.
The Stanford frosh also have n
couple of good games carded for
the week-end. On Friday the frosh
play a Merced Flying School team.
On Saturday night the Card babes
meet a team from Lincoln High
School.
