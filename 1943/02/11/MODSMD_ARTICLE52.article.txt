# Farm Mermen Clash Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's swimming varsity
should edge out powerful Olympic
Club in Encina Pool at 2:30 p.m.
Saturday if Coach Ernie Brandsten's
dope chart maintains its usual ac
curacy:
The Scotch leader of Farm pool
fortunes feels certain that the San
Francisco swimmers will win first
places in five of the seven individual
events. He is equally certain that
Stanford will take both medley re
lays.
The balance of power lies in the
second and third places in the in
dividuals, practically certainties for
Stanford because of superior reserve
strength. Which means, with luck,
Stanford 28, Olympic Club 37.
The margin would be greatly in
creased if the services had spared
Dick Narver, of breast-stroke fame.
But his points will not be present
Saturday alter the recent Navy Re
serve call.
