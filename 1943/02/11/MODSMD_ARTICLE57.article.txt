# Out of the Doldrums
## 
### 
LAST night Excom handled itself as an organ
of student government should.
Last night Excom seriously addressed itself
to the problems brought about by the election
and the illegal campaigning that the Dekes did
for Bill Joslyn without his consent or knowl
edge.
The members of the student government, all
of whom had favorites for the presidency of
the A.S.S.U., put aside their own personal feel
ings and did their level best to see that justice
was done both to Bill Joslyn, to the other can
didates and above all to the student body in
seeing that a candidate of their choice was
elected.
The matter concerning the illegal campaign
ing was carefully reviewed from why Joslyn's
petition was late, to The Daily's inaccurate story,
to who was responsible for the printing and the
distributing of the cards.
Members of the Deke house were there and
explained how the unfortunate campaigning
happened to take place.
After much serious discussion, so often lack
ing in the Excom meetings, many sides of the
problem were aired and it was voted unani
mously that Bill Joslyn be eligible for the
student body presidency.
It was then voted that this election be valid
and thirdly that those who violated the A.S.S.U.
constitution, that is the entire Deke house, be
penalized by Men's Council.
Men's Council will mete out the punishment,
if any, that it thinks this offense deserves.
By conducting itself as it did tonight, Excom,
as a representative of student government at
Stanford, pulled itself out of the doldrums in
which it has so long been wallowing.
