YESTERDAY the Dean of Men's Office re
leased the announcement that the Army
Air Corps Enlisted Reserve is subject to imme
diate call. Long had it been known that the
Enlisted Reserve would bo subject to call at the
end of this quarter.

Although the enrollment will drop off a great
deal at the end of this guarter, there will be
more of Stanford here than those that the Army
will send to us to use our University.
Last Sunday Financial Vice-President Frank
F. Walker told the Alumni Conference in San
Francisco that Stanford is in strong financial
shape, and has nothing to fear in the future
in the way of financial troubles.
But Stanford is not content just to be in strong
financial shape, it is going ahead. It is plan
ning now for the Spring and Summer Quarters.
Even now the Dean of Women's Office is plan
ning new courses for the women, in lines tying
in with the war.
Besides the courses being planned for the
Spring Quarter to take care of Stanford women,
arrangements are now being made to take care
of the increase in enrollment which is expected
to take place among the women students during
Summer Quarter.
Higher education must not die during this
time of war. It may seem like a luxury when
compared with the fighting that is now going
on in the Solomons, but it too has its place in
the scheme of things.
Stanford is doing its share and then some to
keep it alive. Both in the case of the bright
future of women at the University and the new
plans for below-draft-age high school seniors,
Stanford is planning for the future.
