Our boys are out on the deserts and seas and
clouds and swamps saving the world for de
mocracy again.
If the Stanford student government is a rep
resentative democracy, then give us chocolate.
We, the students, have been cajoled, threat
ened, pleaded with, argued with, and cussed at
so that we would vote in the elections.
Okay, so the guy has ten minutes before
class, which is not quite time enough to throw
down a coke, so he decides to vote.
Okay, so there is a 50-50 chance he has his
student body card with him.
Okay, so he gets his various ballots, and pro
ceeds to mark them all wrong, throwing out
his vote entirely.
Okay, so if you told him his vote was void,
he would not care because it really made no
difference to him anyway. He just voted for
the name he had heard most often.

Admiral Byrd would have frozen to death
had he been on our sleeping porch last night.
