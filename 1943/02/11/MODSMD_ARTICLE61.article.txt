The Editor, Sir:
Last night the Excom held one of its most
important meetings of the year—a discussion
of the A.S.S.U. presidential elections. With a
subject as interesting as this was to a large
number of students, only invited visitors were
admitted due to "lack of space." Furthermore,
there seemed to be "space" for only about three
or four students.
This is not meant as a reflection on any of
the candidates in the election, only on the ex
ecutive committee's policy. The student body
government is supposedly a democratic institp
tion, open to anyone who wants to attend. This
is generally true in the usual sessions with the
chief topic how many social dates are to be
granted two weeks from next Saturday.
But when any important question is being
decided, the meeting should be open to at
least as many students as can get in the Excom
room, and if necessary the meeting place could
be changed. If Stanford's government can't be
carried on with a few of the voters in attend
ance, it's not worth having.
