# Approve Joslyn As Candidate
## 
### 
It was "L'Affaire Joslyn" all the
way last night in Excom. Rushing
through the usual time-consuming
trivialities in express-train fashion,
Excom got down to the question of
whether or not Bill Joslyn's candi
dacy for Student Body President
would be allowed within 20 minutes
of convening.
President Ed Stamm began con
sideration of the Joslyn question by
pointing out the case's unusual cir
cumstances.
A prolonged discussion then en--
sued, in which it was pointed out
that the peculiar circumstances of
Joslyn's candidacy seemed to exon
erate him from all blame for the
illegal campaigning, and, after some
talk of holding a re-vote, it was
finally unanimously decided that
Joslyn's votes for A.S.S.U. Presi
dent should be counted.
Excom then approved a motion
whereby disciplinary measures for
the campaigning would be taken by
Men's Council against Delta Kappa
Epsilon, Joslyn's fraternity.
