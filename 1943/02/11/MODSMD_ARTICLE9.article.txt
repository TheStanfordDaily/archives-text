# Two Thousand Shoe Coupons Equal Accounting Headache
## 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
Two thousand coveted shoe cou
pons in ration book No. 1 are tucked
away in the files of the Stanford ac
counting department. Consequently,
when shoe rationing hit the men and
women on campus it hit the account
ing department too.
To buy a pair of shoes each stu
dent must present his ration book
bearing the stamp to the shoe dealer;
to satisfy the requirements of the
Palo Alto ration board, the account
ing department must turn in the
current coupons for sugar and coffee.
According to Mr. L. L. Yancey,
chief accountant, Roble, Lagunita,
Union, and Encina residents as well
as the employees of the University
dining halls, will have to get their
ration books from the accounting
office upstairs in the Ad building,
sign them out, and then return them
after they have purchased their
shoes.
"Until now the problem of doing
the OPA's police job on ration books
has been comparatively simple,"
said Mr. Yancey.
"We have had to collect the books
only once a year and return them to
the students only once a year. Now
we will have to collect them when
they register, return them each time
a student wants to buy a pair of
shoes, and collect the books again,"
he added.
Now that the books must be given
out to students each time they want
to purchase shoes, a separate set of
books will have to be kept for sign
ing books in and out. The depart
ment must keep an accurate check
on the location of all books, accord
ing to Mr. Yancey.
If the books are not returned

promptly, an additional expense will
be involved in tracking them down,
sending out notices, and filing.
"The collection of books and the
turning in of coupons has been just
routine; we have done the police
job for the OPA at University ex
pense," stated Mr. Yancey.
"With the shortage of help, this
will be a tremendous job unless the
students themselves cooperate and
return the books immediately after
purchasing their shoes. Cooperation
from the men and women will save
the University time and money," he
continued.
The accounting department has
collected the sugar ration books
since they were first issued from the
students in University residences.
The staff detaches the current cou
pons from each book in its posses
sion. Next they paste the coupons
on a mucilage sheet, 100 to a page,
and turn these into the local ration
board in return for a receipt.
The University dining halls, how
ever, do not spend the coupons for
sugar or coffee, beca-use they receive
sugar and coffee on a percentage of
past consumption.

ing department too.
To buy a pair of shoes each stu
dent must present his ration book
bearing the stamp to the shoe dealer;
to satisfy the requirements of the
Palo Alto ration board, the account
ing department must turn in the
current coupons for sugar and coffee.
According to Mr. L. L. Yancey,
chief accountant, Roble, Lagunita,
Union, and Encina residents as well
as the employees of the University
dining halls, will have to get their
ration books from the accounting
office upstairs in the Ad building,
sign them out, and then return them
after they have purchased their
shoes.
"Until now the problem of doing
the OPA's police job on ration books
has been comparatively simple,"
said Mr. Yancey.
"We have had to collect the books
only once a year and return them to
the students only once a year. Now
we will have to collect them when
they register, return them each time
a student wants to buy a pair of
shoes, and collect the books again,"
he added.
Now that the books must be given
out to students each time they want
to purchase shoes, a separate set of
books will have to be kept for sign
ing books in and out. The depart
ment must keep an accurate check
on the location of all books, accord
ing to Mr. Yancey.
If the books are not returned

promptly, an additional expense will
be involved in tracking them down,
sending out notices, and filing.
"The collection of books and the
turning in of coupons has been just
routine; we have done the police
job for the OPA at University ex
pense," stated Mr. Yancey.
"With the shortage of help, this
will be a tremendous job unless the
students themselves cooperate and
return the books immediately after
purchasing their shoes. Cooperation
from the men and women will save
the University time and money," he
continued.
The accounting department has
collected the sugar ration books
since they were first issued from the
students in University residences.
The staff detaches the current cou
pons from each book in its posses
sion. Next they paste the coupons
on a mucilage sheet, 100 to a page,
and turn these into the local ration
board in return for a receipt.
The University dining halls, how
ever, do not spend the coupons for
sugar or coffee, beca-use they receive
sugar and coffee on a percentage of
past consumption.
Two thousand coveted shoe cou
pons in ration book No. 1 are tucked
away in the files of the Stanford ac
