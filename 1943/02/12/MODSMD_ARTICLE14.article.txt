went out for frosh ball—made his
letter. Same year he tried out for
debating, made the frosh team.
In his sophomore year, versatile
Reynolds went out for the Gaieties

hour before the deadline for nomi
nation slips came, Reynolds spon
taneously decided to throw his hat
in the ring. (He was student body
