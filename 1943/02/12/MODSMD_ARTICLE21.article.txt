## Dr. Espinosa Interviewed In Survey 
### 
Professor Aurelio Espinosa, Ro
manic Language Department, was
interviewed Tuesday afternoon by a
representative of the Office of War
Information, Miss Barbara Aitken,
who is making a survey for pi-opa
ganda purposes of those persons in
the United States who for several
years have been outstanding in the
study of the Spanish and South
American cultures.
Professor Espinosa posed for sev
eral pictures and told of the research
he has been carrying on for 30 years
on Spanish literature, history, and
folklore.
Good Neighbor Policy
The pictures, with the material
obtained in the interview, will be
published in magazines and news
papers in Spain and South America
as a part of the Good Neighbor Pol
icy for, although the scholars of
these countries are well aware of
the work of Dr. Espinosa and others
.n his field, the general public has
not known of this interest.
"The government wants to make
the people in the Spanish speaking
countries realize that we have been
doing this work for years, and to
understand that the interest in their
culture has not sprung up just since
the war," said Miss Aikens.
Ancient Manuscript
In one of the pictures taken by
Miss Aitken, Professor Espinosa was
showing some students an 18th cen
tury manuscript of the religious
play "La Primers Persecucion de
Jesus," the story of the Flight Into
Egypt, which has been in the Es
pinosa family for five generations.
The manuscript was dated by Pro
fessor Gonzalez Palencia of Madrid,
when he was teaching at Stanford in
3938.
Miss Aitken was also interested in
the Penitcnte Manuscripts, books
containing 19th century prayers,
Jballads, and rituals of the religious
societies of New Mexico.
3oth Professor Espinosa and Pro
fessor Rael have collections of these
manuscripts.
