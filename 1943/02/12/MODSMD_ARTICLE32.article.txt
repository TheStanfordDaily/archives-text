## Broncs Play Cards Here This Evening 
### 
Leo McCaffrey, the icebox guard,
will still be missing tonight at 8
when the question-mark basketball
varsity takes on Santa Clara in the
Pavilion.
Missing in the last two losses in
barnlike Civic Auditorium in the
big city, the cool Leo may have been
the absent factor that ended the In
dian's comeback tour just as quickly
as it started on that wonderful night
against Cal, now a comparatively
long time ago.
The gentleman in question has j
been an unlucky scorer this year.
But he may well be the person need
ed to slow down the Injuns long :
enough to set up a few of those
plays that they are capable of.
It's the Same Gang
That is just exactly the point. De
spite their miraculously poor shoot
ing this year, these boys are the
same gang that trimmed Dartmouth j
last year in the N.C.A A. finals; they
are the same bunch that had enough
to pull from behind and wax Cal.
Jack Dana and Freddie Linari are
recognized as two of the best floor
working forwards in Coast ball. Ed
Voss has a hook shot that was good j
for plenty of points last year. Howie |
Dallrnar on defense is every inch the
All-American player of 1943 that
he would have been if the record
had gotten off to a little better start,
and that he might be yet if the In
dians can deslump themselves be
fore the S.C., U.C.L.A. games next
weekend.
Just Misplaced
No matter what scorebooks say,
a team with that combination doesn't
totally degenerate; they only mis
place. They lost it once, found
themselves again against Cal. It's
time for the second renaissance,
marked by better shooting on the
followups and a little more consist
ent second-half defense.
Saturday, the Surf Riders from
the Coast Guard base in San Fran
cisco play here at 8 p.m. They have
17 victories in 20 starts, a better
average than any - team in the Bay
Area.
