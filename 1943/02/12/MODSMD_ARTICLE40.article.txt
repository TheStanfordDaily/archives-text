## Cards to Meet English Squad 
### 
The Stanford rugby squad meets
a Royal Navy squad on Maloney
Field at 3:15 tomorrow afternoon.
Both teams will be playing for fun,
regarding the game as a breather.
"Both teams have had rough
games recently, and neither of us
are very serious about winning,"
Ralph Ebner, one of the Farm fif
teen's hard-working coaches, stated.
Announced as backs for Saturday
are Reynolds, Andrews, Brody, Ras
.mussen, Fawcett, Lamport, Silva,
Ghormely, Stork, Balthis, Anderson,
Doty.
Forwards Named
Forwards will be Madigan, Nor
ton, MeClean, Hachten, Petrich,
Brown, Lyon, Kinsinger, Coonan,
Jones, Carter.
Besides Harry Maloney, director of
minor sports, and Ebner, the other
rugby coaches are Ducky Davis, a
rugby ace in his Stanford days, and
Marchy Schwartz, head football
coach. Marchy has spent the past
couple of weeks learning rugby and
allows that it's "a good game."
Jim Wvlie, last season's coach, al
though not officially present, has
turned up regularly to handle the
backfield at most of the practice
sessions.
British Team
The British team is made up from
the crew ot a Royal Navy ship in
port. The Stanford fifteen plan to
treat these Allies to dinner at their
respective eating groups.
The last Royal Navy-Stanford
game saw the Indians triumphant
29-0. None of these Card players of
two weeks ago will take the field
against the British tomorrow; the
coaches are starting an entirely new
lineup.
