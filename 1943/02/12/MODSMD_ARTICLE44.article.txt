# Quad Sales Deadline
## 
### 
ABSOLUTELY no Quads will be sold after
Winter Quarter this year. Another one of
those "due to wartime conditions" changes is
being made. And the campus would do well
'to remember it. The Quad staff has put a dead
line on the sale of Quads and they intend to
keep it.
Most of us can remember the good old days
when Quad deadlines came and Quad dead
lines went and we all went ahead and bought
our Quads and had our pictures taken at our
convenience. But those days are over. The
Quad set a January 29 deadline for all indi
vidual pictures and they kept it. They have set
a Winter Quarter deadline on sales and they
intend to keep that too.
According to the Quad editors, their printer,
who is faced with a shortage of materials and
of help, must know the number of books to be
printed by the end of the quarter in order to
get sufficient stock. Therefore, there can be no
Spring Quarter sales.
The deadline has one real advantage—we
are assured of getting oui Quads before the end
of the quarter since the Quad staff will have
all but the last-minute material in the hands of
the printer this quarter.
All of us who will not be here next quarter
are also urged to drop by the Quad office and
leave mailing addresses. And those leaving be
fore the end of the quarter should leave a mail
ing address before they go so there will be no
mix-up.
So let's remember that the Quad people are
operating under exceptional difficulties this
year. If we want a Quad, it doesn't take much
effort to drop by the Quad Building and get one.
It's on Lomita Drive just one block below the
nerve center of the campus (the Daily Shack). —
