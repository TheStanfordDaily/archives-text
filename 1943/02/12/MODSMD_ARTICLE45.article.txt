IF the psychology of Dr. Dorothy Yates of
San Jose had anything to do with the out
come of last night's fights, we're all for it. As
far as we could see, the psychology consisted
mainly of keeping the fighters completely re
laxed in the dressing room before the fight so
that none of their energy was frittered away by
nervous tension. It's not vitamin pills, it doesn't
add anything, it just enables the fighter to
make complete use of the faculties he already

has. Pre-fight nervous tension can exhaust one
almost as much as the fight itself. We could
really apply this principle to everyday life.
Don't let worry about a struggle or contest
ahead rob us of the strength for the struggle
itself.—Ferris Booihe
