# Staff Meeting
## 
### 
JUST to remind any members of the staff who
take the time to read The Daily, there will be
another gathering of the Sunday Morning Ale
and Quail Club at the old Daily Shack on Lomita
Drive. Lomita Drive is where Lake Lagunita,
the Quad, Chem Building, and the Daily Shack
are located—just looked it up in the Bawl-Out.—
