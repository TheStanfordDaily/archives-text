# OUR HASHER SEZ

There is a gentleman who runs an eatery
down the road who has big clippings to show
that he helped drive the Turkish menace out of
Europe in the Balkan War of 1908 or there
abouts. He was visiting his brother in Greece
at the time the Turks passed through, so he
joined in the fight. When he came back to this
country one of the papers heard about his
heroic exploits and devoted a whole page of
its Sunday supplement to his story and to sev
eral pictures of him.
This all happened thirty years ago, but he
has the clippings framed up on his wall as a
constant reminder to himself that he was once
a celebrity.
Now if his eatery was just an ordinary eatery,
there would be no point in telling all this. Ac
tually, his is a very strange eatery. Up to and
including 12 midnight he has one large eatery.
From then on until the early hours of the
morning he has two small eateries with a par
tition between.
The other night lois of local celebrities, stu
dent body presidents, student body presidents
elect, student managers, war activities coordi
nators, and others equally important, were sit
ting along the counter eating their hamburgers
and drinking their coffee —some of them in
the front eatery and others in the back eatery —
when this former Greek patriot got real excited
and started running around shouting for every
one to get out.
He pulled the blinds down and turned the
lights out and so all the big shots grabbed their
food and left. As a matter of fact some left with
some extra bottles of tomato juice, loganberry
juice, etc., that were sitting on the counter.
The big question in the mind of all those
concerned is how this is all affecting the pro
prietor's health. He was in a state of nervous
excitement the entire evening and he appeared
to be nearing a breakdown as the evening ter
minated. If he doesn't die of ulcers or heart fail
ure, we'll be surprised.
There is a move on now to take him out of
the tense, strained atmosphere of a hamburger
joint, and set him up with a quiet bar some
where.
