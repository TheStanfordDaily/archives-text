The Editor, Sir:
I thought the diseased thinking represented
by the Roman Catholic Inquisition had been
rendered powerless in this country by the ox\-
j slaughts of reason and tolerance. Yet De Vault's
draft board seems to think that he must belong
to some church if he is to be considered sin
, cere, and if his ideas are to have weight. And
the inference is, conversely, that if he does not
belong to certain religious organizations, he
is either insincere i.e. a liar, or incapable of
' mature tenets worthy to be considered i.e. ig
norant or simple.
I will look forward to the outcome of this
case with much interest.
