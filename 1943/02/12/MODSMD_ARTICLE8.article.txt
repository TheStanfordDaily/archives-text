# SADIE HAWKINS
## Last Day To Get Man For Tomorrow's Dance 
### 
Just one more day to buy your bid for the Sadie Hawkins Dance ($l.l
at the A.S.S.U. office). Men on campus are still praying for a chance t
dress up and dance tomorrow night from 9 to 1 in the Women's Gym. Th
poor male element is just realizing the full significance of the Stanfon
ratio.
Every Daisy Mae owes it to her countrymen to take a man to the dance

Think of the air forces being called
any day . . . think of the reserves
going at the end of the quarter . . .
forget that you won't have a man in
spring . . . just think of the poor
men who won't be going to any
more Stanford dances . . . and TAKE
ONE!
"This is the fun dance of the year,"
quoth Vernice Hines, dance chair
man, "and the only dance when the
students let down their hair (in
braids) and really have a good time."
Transportation
Suggestions are coming in via the
grapevine on how to solve the trans
portation problem. This is the first
year when a woman has been em
barrassed to arrange with her date
to get his car. Apparently couples
are walking or coming in after the
game on bikes and roller skates.
Enterprising groups of young
ladies, realizing that l:3o's elimi
nate tiie old "Let's go down to Di
nah's for a steak sandwich" line they
used to hear, are splurging before
hand and inviting their men to buf
fet and picnic suppers. Cokes, cider,
and doughnuts will be free to the
men (at the expense of their women
escorts).
Law Orchestra
Paul Law and his Del Courtney
style orchestra have promised to go
Dogpatch for at least part of the
evening with the help of their
"South American and sentamental
ist" vocalist, Delores Perodi. Or
chesis will present an exhibit of
square dancing, Dave BilLs and his
hill-billy group of Gaieties fame will
share the program with Don O'Neill,
piano artist of boogie woogie.
