## Indians Regain Eye; Victorious 
### Bill Hornby 
In two victories that were won
"mainly on the welcome return of
the Indians' front-line shooting
ability, Stanford topped Santa Clara,
57 to 44, Friday, and then outlasted
five sharpshooting Coast Guard Surf
Riders, 56 to 55, Saturday in Stan
ford's Pavilion.
The wins relit the hopes of Farm
basketball followers that a surprise
is in store for Ernie Holbrook's high
riding U.S.C. supermen when the
Indians travel South next weekend
for their sole conference jaunt to
Los Angeles.
Poor Week
After a particularly poor week
with two losses in the Civic Audi
torium in San Francisco, it looked
as if the shooting accuracy which
had led Stanford to the N.C.A.A.
crown last year was just a memory.
Herewith is the story of the scat
tering' of this rumor, perhaps the
first in a campaign to put an end to
numerous tumors, including that
prevalent one that a certain basket
ball team in Los Angeles is invin
cible.
For the sake of impartiality, note
that S.C. did dump St. Mary's Pre-
Flight this weekend despite the ef
forts of Angelo Luisetti; it was the
14th straight for the Trojans, a new
school hoop record.
Bronc Contest
The Bronc contest didn't break
open until the second half although
the Deanmen managed to keep a
bucket ahead throughout the first
period. They led 30 to 28 at half time.
After a minute or so of the second
half, it was all over for eagle-eyed
Stanley Patrick and his mates. The
Indians climbed on the band-wagon
wi(h Jack Dana and Ed Voss, pound
ed into a 52 to 41 lead with three
minutes to go.
Dana hit 50 per cent of his shots
for the evening, Voss got 8 out of 18
tries, and the efforts of Dallmar who
hooped 11 points brought a shooting
average of better than 35 per cent
for three of the five starters.

numerous tumors, including that
prevalent one that a certain basket
ball team in Los Angeles is invin
cible.
For the sake of impartiality, note
that S.C. did dump St. Mary's Pre-
Flight this weekend despite the ef
forts of Angelo Luisetti; it was the
14th straight for the Trojans, a new
school hoop record.
Bronc Contest
The Bronc contest didn't break
open until the second half although
the Deanmen managed to keep a
bucket ahead throughout the first
period. They led 30 to 28 at half time.
After a minute or so of the second
half, it was all over for eagle-eyed
Stanley Patrick and his mates. The
Indians climbed on the band-wagon
wi(h Jack Dana and Ed Voss, pound
ed into a 52 to 41 lead with three
minutes to go.
Dana hit 50 per cent of his shots
for the evening, Voss got 8 out of 18
tries, and the efforts of Dallmar who
hooped 11 points brought a shooting
average of better than 35 per cent
for three of the five starters.
In two victories that were won
"mainly on the welcome return of
the Indians' front-line shooting
ability, Stanford topped Santa Clara,
57 to 44, Friday, and then outlasted
five sharpshooting Coast Guard Surf
Riders, 56 to 55, Saturday in Stan
ford's Pavilion.
The wins relit the hopes of Farm
basketball followers that a surprise
is in store for Ernie Holbrook's high
riding U.S.C. supermen when the
Indians travel South next weekend
for their sole conference jaunt to
Los Angeles.
Poor Week
After a particularly poor week
with two losses in the Civic Audi
torium in San Francisco, it looked
as if the shooting accuracy which
had led Stanford to the N.C.A.A.
crown last year was just a memory.
Herewith is the story of the scat
tering' of this rumor, perhaps the
first in a campaign to put an end to
numerous tumors, including that
prevalent one that a certain basket
ball team in Los Angeles is invin
cible.
