# Patched-Up Papeese Win Hoop Games
## 
### Ed Luce 
Woody Wier's patched-up Papeese,
most of them bench riders two weeks
ago, turned up with some first rate
basketball over the weekend to nip
the amazing Merced Airmen Friday,
39-37, and then wallop Lincoln High,
32-17, on Saturday.
The frosh operated for the first
time without backboard kings Dick
Berlin and Dave Davidson, and
steady guard Bill Christiansen, but
still looked good enough for several
more wins in the near future.
Out in front by about 12 midway
in the second half, the Papeese came
within one field goal of blowing the
Merced tiff. Weir shot his reserves
in when the frosh had their margin,
and just did hustle the starting five
back in time.
Nelson, 6-foot 7-inch center, and
Peters, former Washington State for
ward, were the whole Merced team.
Nelson hooked in four pivot shots
for eight points, while Peters got
five goals and three gifts for 13.
Babe Higgins played his usual top
flight game for the frosh, and along
with Hugh West and A1 Fish,
worked -.ibout the best fast break of
the year.
Guard Bud Provost took high
point honors on the Stanford side of
the book with eight; Higgins was
second with seven.
In the Lincoln rout. Higgins' abil
ity to tie up Greenberg, leading ctiy
prep scorer, was the feature of the
evening.

A woman's mouton coat contains
enough material to line a war flier's
sheepskin-lined jacket.
