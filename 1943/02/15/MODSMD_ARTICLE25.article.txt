# Boathouse Thefts
## 
### 
THE tremendous "boathouse" weather of the
past few days has brought as its usual after
math the question of thefts from the Stanford
Boathouse. Several have already been reported.
One wallet, stolen several days ago., was found
yesterday with the money it contained gone
and worst of all, all the coupons had been torn
from the ration book inside.
Those of us who attended public high
schools can remember how frequent thefts from
gym lockers were despite the elaborate pre
cautions taken against them. One of the finest
features of Stanford, we found, was the trust in
the Honor Code which allowed us to leave keys
in cars and all sorts of articles in all sorts of
places without fear of thievery.
Although the boathouse supposedly is for
the exclusive use of Stanford students, there is
practically no way to prevent outsiders from
entering the dressing rooms. And these out
siders using our facilities probably haven't
heard of the Honor Code. Life guards are on
duty at all hours the boathouse is open, but they
do not have the time or facilities to run a check
ing service for valuables.
To prevent a possible outbreak of thefts, Po
lice Chief Gordy Davis recommends three rules
for individuals using boathouse facilities:
1) Whenever possible, dress at home.
2) When you are forced to use the boathouse
dressing room, leave watches, wallets, and
purses at home.
3) See that your house manager provides a

lock (preferably combination) for the lockers
provided with each canoe rack. If you forget
and bring anything valuable to the boathouse,
lock it up in your living group's locker.
These rules are for our own protection. If
we follow them, the incentive for possible thiev
ery at the boathouse will be gone. If we don't
follow them, there are bound to be some thefts
despite any precautionary methods we might
use. And successful thefts will encourage
others.
In addition, we might examine some other
general boathouse rules. Each canoe stored in
the boathouse should be locked with a chain,
the keys to which can be kept in the living
group's locker. The life guards are not re
sponsible if your canoe is left unlocked and
used by others. Paddles and other equipment
should be kept locked up.
All the rules are made for the benefit of the
users of Stanford's Lake Lagunita and its boat
house. We must follow them to get the most
enjoyment out of the facilities provided for us.
Remember, we leave watches and wallets at the
boathouse at our own risk.â€”Ferris Boothe
