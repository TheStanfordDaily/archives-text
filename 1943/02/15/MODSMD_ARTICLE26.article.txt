MARK down Feb. 25 in your calendar as a
date to remember. Shortly after his return
from the North African battleground, H. R.
Knickerbocker, noted foreign correspondent
and Pulitzer Prize-winner, will speak to Stan
ford students in Memorial Hall.
North Africa has been a focal point for our
interest ever since that momentous day of
American landings that heralded the beginning
of a second front. For us, it marked the begin
ning of full American participation in the Euro
pean war theater. And most of us have friends
or relatives among those 500,000 Allied troops
battling the Axis in Africa. We marvelled at
the epic Russian defense of Stalingrad, thrilled
at their tremendous recoil offensive, but our
personal interest still centers in North Africa,
where Knickerbocker has spent the major por
tion of the past year.
Knickerbocker knows the African war situ
ation, but he has also been on the spot at some
of the most important news developments of
the war. He saw the fall of Paris and the unbe
lievable destruction of France, he saw the smok
ing ruins of Pearl Harbor a few days after, and
he saw the beginnings and expansion of Allied
resistance in the Pacific. Knickerbocker can give
a personal account of World War II history.—
