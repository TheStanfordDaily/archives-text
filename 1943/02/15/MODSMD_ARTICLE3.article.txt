# Knickerbocker To Speak Here; Direct From Africa
## 
### Noel Young 
H. R. Knickerbocker, Pulitzer Prize-winning foreign correspondent,
is scheduled to speak in Memorial Hall, Feb. 25, after returning direct
from the Noi'th African battlefront.
With the same vividness and verve that distinguishes his dispatches,
Knickerbocker will key his lecture to the latest international develop
ments with the keen insight of a man who has been in the thick of the
fighting on every important front in the war.
The outbreak of the war in 1939 found Knickerbocker in Paris, and

ever since he has been following
its latest developments around the
globe—in Australia, New Guinea,
Java, England, Egypt, Russia,
and now, North Africa.
During his trip through
France, Knickerbocker was one
of 8,000,000 refugees who
streamed back from the points
where the French army was try
ing to hold the Germans' — the
largest migration of its kind in
history, and one of the most
tragic. He eye - witnessed the
fiercest fighting on the Western
Front during the fateful summer
of 1940 and tells of its American
repercussions.
When the Japs bombed Pearl
Harbor, Knickerbocker flew to
Honolulu, from there to Sydney
and then on to Java where he
witnessed the great refugee mi
gration from British and Dutch
colonies to Darwin. Later, he
joined Mac Arthur "somewhere in
Australia" where he was attacked
by Japanese Zeros while flying
on an "attack mission" with an
American bomber crew.

Besides reviewing the African campaign, with possible sidelights on
the Casablanca conference, Knickerbocker will forecast what the con
sequences of an Allied or Axis victory will be, with a discussion of the
possibilities of a lasting peace.
When Knickerbocker first went to Europe, he went with the idea of
medical study. But Hitler's Beer House Putsch in ' 1923 put an end to
his studies at the University of Munich and launched him upon what
has become one of the most colorful careers in the annals of modern
journalism.
Knickerbocker was in Moscow when Trotsky was dismissed from the
Russian War Ministry and banished from the U.S.S.R.; in Vienna when
Chancellor Dollfuss was assassinated; in Dessye when Italian airmen
bombed the Ethiopian city in 1935; in Burgos three days after the out
break of the Spanish Civil War; in Shanghai when this city was cap
tured by the Japanese in 1937.
This Texas-born, prairie-bred reporter has roamed the world for
his news and has been the confidante of kings, dictators, generals, and
the notables of five continents.
Knickerbocker's lecture on Thursday, Feb. 25, will be sponsored by
Sigma Delta Chi, men's honorary journalism fraternity, and Theta
Sigma Phi, women's journalism fraternity. Tickets are being sold at
the A.S.S.U. office, and by members of the journalism fraternities.
