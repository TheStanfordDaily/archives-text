# BOOK DRIVE
## Donations to Go To Servicemen 
### 
In cooperation with the national
book collection drive, Stanford will
hold a campus drive this week to
collect current best sellers for serv
icemen stationed at outposts. Ac
cording to Margaret Dorris, chair
man, containers have been placed in
all living groups.
"The books we donate will be sent
to soldiers in places such as Alaska,"
said Miss Doris. "They want good
books in decent condition—popular
fiction and non-fiction, adventure
j st ories, Westerns, mysteries, and re-
I cent technical books—and not the
kind that you find up in the attic.
Pocket editions are acceptable."
The books will go not only to sol
i diers stationed at outposts but also
to sailors and men in Army camps
: in the United States.
The national drive is being jointly
sponsored by the USO, Red Cross,
j and the American Library Associa
i tion.
