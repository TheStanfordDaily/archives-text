### 
In a quiet and speedy meeting
Men's Council last Friday assigned
every member of the Delta Kappa
Epsilon fraternity to two hours work
at the Stanford Convalescent Home
and gave each individual in the
house the choice of working two ad
ditional hours or paying $2.

The decision was the penalty for
violation of the A.S.S.U. constitution
in.relation to campaigning for stu
dent body offices. In a long meeting
last Wednesday night, Excom ex
onerated Bill Joslyn, write-in candi
date for student body president, from
all blame concerning a large number
of cards spread around campus urg
ing students to write Joslyn's name
in on the ballots.

Excom, however, did decide that
some action should be taken because
there is a constitutional ruling
against spreading any type of cam
paign publicity around Stanford's
campus except for that provided in
The Daily and in the assembly ap
pearance made by all candidates the
day before elections.

It was felt that since virtually the
whole house, with the exception of
Joslyn who was in the Rest Home at
the time, participated in the illegal
campaigning, some action should be
taken and for this reason the case
was assigned to Men's Council, the
men students' judiciary body.
Friday's decision was the result of
several days' investigation into the
matter.
