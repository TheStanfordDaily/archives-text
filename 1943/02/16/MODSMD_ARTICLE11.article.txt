## 
### 
Because of the unequaled oppor
j tunities for young women to partici
j pate in business, government, and
! the military effort, Stanford had
adapted its program to these needs,
I Dean of Women Mary Yost told the
I Stanford Mothers' Club of Los An-
I geles yesterday afternoon.
In her talk to the Mothers' Club,
i Dean Yost said that the registra
-1 tion of young women is expected to
; be greater than ever next quarter.
While declaring that wartime
j study courses to train women will
j be inaugurated as a modification of
I the regular program of major stu
j dies, she said that the latter would
|be continued. Dean Yost stressed
j that in some instances the programs
| can be completed in less than the
j usual 12 quarters.
Among the special courses which
I she mentioned were those to train
j personnel specialists, chemists,
| physicists, metallurgists, nurses, and
statisticians.
