# Chi Psi's Beat Theta Delt Five
## 
### 
The Chi Psi five heat the Theta
Dolt II team i5O-14 last night in a
one-man slaughter. It was Dick
West all the way. West, one time
star of the freshman basketball team
and now Chi Psi wonder, made the
phenomenal number ul points.
West scored with long looping
one-handed shots i'rom the corners,
with fast breaks, and from the circle.
At the end of the first half West led
the game by 16 points. In the sec
ond half the Theta Delt hoopsters
tightened up on West and held him
to 7 points. Jack Rieser of the Theta
Delts even tried to catch up, and
made several spectacular shots, but
it was too late.
Referee Delancey Smith remarked
at the end of the game on the sports
manship of the two teams. Although
it was a hard fought game, only five
fouls were made. With the excep
tion of champion breast stroker Em
met Cashin, who seemed to be in
good condition, members of both
teams were glad to hear the gong
ending the game.
