## Farm Oarsmen Plan Schedule 
### 
Plans are going ahead for the
scheduling of a crew race with Cal
on May 1 in the Oakland Estuary,
according to Carl Pedersen, Farm
crew coach. Ky Ebright, coach of
the Bear paddlers, has given the go
ahead for the races; so only official
confirmation remains for conclusion
of the plans.
Pedersen is also trying to arrange
a race with the highly touted Sacra
mento J.C. oarsmen for some time
this quarter. No word from the
capital has been received as yet,
however,

A canoe to be used for a coach
ing launch is urgently needed by
the Stanford crew, according to
Walter Drake, coxswain. Anyone
possessing an old canoe which is
not in use. no matter what its con
dition. is requested to contact
Drake. An outboard motor has al
ready been donated. "If we can
get the canoe, we can beat Cal
or Washington or any other team
in the country," according to
Drake.

U.S.F. shell recently brought to the
campus. "The new shell is a fine
one," Pedersen said.
The turnouts have been contin
ually good despite the inclement
weather. The absence of a few men
during the past week has somewhat
hindered the eanoemen's progress,
however. All the men out for crew
are asked to come out every day, so
that each of the three shells will be
full at every practice.
Secondary Float
One absence in a shell puts the
whole boat out of commission and
causes loss of much time and effort
on the part of the other men in the
boat.
The oarsmen are now building a
secondary float to hold up the ramp
and be used as a turn-around float.
The float was sorely needed and
will be a valuable addition to crew
equipment when completed.
