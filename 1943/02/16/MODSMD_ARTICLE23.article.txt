# Farm Baseballers Seek Initial Win
## 
### 
Stanford's victory-starved base
ball team will be seeking its initial
win of the current season tomorrow
when it meets the Coast Guard Surl
Riders on the Sunken Diamond at
3:15.
Thus far this season the Indian
apple-knockers have ventured out
of the fold three times and have
been rudely treated on each occa
sion, falling before the potent bats
of the Yerba Buena Receiving Shij
and the Alameda Coast Guard.
