# In Defense of the Dekes
## 
### 
THE penalty that Excom was clammoring for
at their meeting last week has been handed
to the Deke house by Men's Council.
Whether the Dekes deserved to be penal
ized is debatable. Although the rule forbidding
the campaigning for candidates is in the
A.S.S.U. constitution was violated, the ignor
ance of the Deke house for not knowing this
rule lies just as much with the Stanford Daily
for the incorrect story that it ran and with the
A.S.S.U. government for not taking adequate
precautions that the rule be publicized.
However, since Men's Council deemed pun
ishment necessary, that which was given was
fair.
