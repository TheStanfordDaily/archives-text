A NEAR record crowd attended the Sunday
night movies in Memorial Auditorium and
a near record crowd booed, whistled, and
shouted at the shorts.
No one will deny that the two shorts pre
ceding the main features were poor. However,
it is not the poor management of Movie Czar
Ham Howard that was responsible for these poor

All the best 16 mm. shorts are sent to sea to
entertain the Navy or sent overseas to keep the
Army's morale up. The film brokerage house

has, sight unseen to Miss Howard and this best
sometimes is poor.
Miss Howard has written to the government
requesting films on the different phases of the
war work be sent to take the place of these
shorts we are now running.
If the government does not send these films,
it might be better to cease using shorts.
There are few Stanford movie goers that
would not have a better time seeing one good
feature than getting their money's worth with
several shorts.
