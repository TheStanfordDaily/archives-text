# Moraga's March 15
## 
### 
THE boys over at Moraga got their notice yes
terday. That is, those in the Enlisted Re
serve Corps were notified that they must report
to the Presidio at Monterey March 15.
This can mean only one thing as tar as Stan

lord is concerned; the Farm's E.R.C. men will
go shortly too.
It is just one more indication of the fact that
by the beginning of Summer Quarter Stanford
will be almost stripped of its manpower.
Now right now we wonder how the boys at
St. Mary's feel. We, a single part of the nation's
Enlisted Reserve Corps, wonder what it is like
to be called to the service of one's country. We
wonder if we will be thrilled or a little afraid or
rather sorry to leave Stanford. And if we were
in the Marines or the Navy we think that we
would be wondering the same things.
And then a newspaper comes under our
glance. The headlines blare out war news from
all over the globe. But particularly they play
up the news from Russia. Stalingrad, Kursk,
Orel, Voroshilovgrad, Rostov, they all spell
something which we have been learning to for
get —the feeling of living in peace.
The more the Russians win, we realize, the
closer we are to peace. They are winning at the
cost of huge sacrifices, we realize, but they are
winning.
Then a sudden thought strikes us. Perhaps
the Russians are sacrificing, winning, not only
for themselves but for us also. Perhaps that
peace which we must forget is going to be won
for us by the Russians. Perhaps the peace will
be a Russian peace.
Now we admire the Russians. They are a
forward-thinking people. They have done a
lot of things we could well emulate. They have
fought a magnificent uphill battle against the
once-invincible German machine.
But somehow we don't want to live under a
Russian peace. We want to live in a peacetime
which has been in large part created by Ameri
cans, because somehow we believe that Amer
icans will be more just in finding a happy solu
tion to a world possessed of a terrific war hang
over.
And when we think of this we do not any
longer wonder how the boys over at Moraga
feel. We know they must be as "rarin' to go"
as we are.—Bill Steif
