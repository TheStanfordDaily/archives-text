# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
Note to people who play bridge in the Cel
lar: Anybody can play bridge in the Cellar,
but it takes a cannibal to throw up a hand.

The Sigma Gnus have been needling the
hasher to put in a plug about their "Baby Dance"
next Friday night so there it is.
Also the editor of the Chaparral wanted us to
say something about the Having-Wonderful-
Time-Wish-You-Were-Here issue of the Chappie
which will be out a week from Wednesday, and
which has been made for consumption by our
laddies in the service. They tell us they're hav
ing 4,000 copies, or twice the usual number,
printed so that us lucky people can buy several
copies and send them to men in the armed
forces.
We'll take a dozen, please, and wrap them
up.
