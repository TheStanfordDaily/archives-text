# Lawry Play to Supply Comic Note in One-Acts
## 
### 
Supplying the comic note to the Ram's Head one-acts Friday and Satur
day nights will be John Lawry's prize play, "A Very Unscrupulous
Woman."
Lawry, who has been amusing the campus for three years in various
Gaieties and Spring Shows, will act in his production, a hilarious comedy

ot a college prolessor and his family.
After bucking the Navy, measles,
and several cold cases for the past
two weeks, the cast has succeeded in
getting the show in shape during re
cent rehearsals.
The colds had a definite hindering
effect on the author's part, for he is
supposed to kiss two girls in the
course of the act.
Members of the cast, nearly all of
whom have had considerable expe
rience on the Stanford stage, are:
Paul Hostetler, Professor Jamison;
Margaret Mayer, Mrs. Jamison:
Moofie Faris, Martha; John Lawry,
Terrence Terringwell III; Janice
Shaughnessy, Miss Buck; Jean Rob
inson, Stella.
Directing "A Very Unscrupulous
Woman" are Joyce Henderson and
Natalie Towle, assistant.
Tickets to the one-acts will be on
sale today and tomorrow in the Cel
lar from 9 to 12 a.m. They are 55
cents.
The three one-acts chosen for
production by Ram's Head will start
at 8 p.m. and will last approximately
two hours.
