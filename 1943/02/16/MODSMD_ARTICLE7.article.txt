# Leaky Water Pipes Flood Women's Dorm

### 
Leaky water pipes in the Union
Residence Saturday afternoon sent
prospective Daisy Maes scurrying for
cover as water dripped from the ceil
ings of their rooms and left the main
dining room under puddles of water.
The leaks were discovered simul
taneously in second-floor rooms,
where water thoroughly soaked one
bed and dripped into another closet,
and in the dining room, which was
closed until Sunday.
