# Wars' Secrets Held In Hoover Library
## 
### 
The greatest single collection of
military, social, and political mate
rial relating to the World War in
the Hoover War Library have at
tracted hundreds of scholars to its
reading rums since the library's in
ception in May, 1941.
Private documents, diaries, and
private collections throughout the
world have been purchased, and on
June 20, 1941, when the library was
dedicated, Kamiel Lefevere came out
from the Riverside Church in New
York to give a Carillon concert from
the Library tower to a multitude of
distinguished scholars and visitors
who heard the President of the
American Library Association com
ment on the significance of the new
library.
No sooner had the chiming notes
of the "Star Spangled Banner"
drifted away from the dedication
ceremony, than shipments of docu
ments, books, pamphlets, leaflets,
and posters —19 cases of them—
flooded the library's receiving room.
With the arrival of source mate
rial on War, Revolution, and Peace
came the research scholars. From
Idaho came Professor James F.
Clarke to investigate the "Rise ot
Bulgarian Nationalism"; Dr. Suz
anne Engelmann came across the
continent from New York to analyze
"Education in Nazi Germany"; and
Mrs. Betty Klein commuted from
Redwood City to study "Sexual
Symbolism in Propaganda.'
Graduate students, too, found a
wealth of material in the Hoover
Library and devoted most of their
research time in the Hoover reading
room in preparation for their Ph.W.'s
and M.A.'s on topics such as "Youth's
Opinion on War," and the "Foreign
Policy of Dr. Gustav Stresemann."
W. H. Chamberlin, of the "Chris
tian Science Monitor," wrote, "One
of the most valuable and stimulating
pieces of research finds expression
in the series of books which have
come . . . from the rich reserves of
the Hoover Library."
Soon after dedication of the Hoov
er Library the University Press be
gan humming and by last week, 19
books based on research in the
Hoover Libe were published.
Nineteen books — beginning with
airman of Directors, Ralph H.
TTitz' "Fall of the German Empire,"
and Fisher's and Bunyan's "The
Bolshevik Revolution," continuing
to the latest. "Raymond Poincare and
the French Presidency," by Gordon
Wright—caused the nation to sit up
with notice.
Back in the nation's capital, Stan
ford's Hoover Library was regarded
with special interest, and soon repre
sentatives from several war agencies
came West to consult the resources
of the institution.
When Olga Hess Gankin and H. H.
Fisher collaborated to write "The
Bolsheviks and the World War," a
newspaper across the continent
wrote that it is "undoubtedly des
tined to occupy a place of honor in
the already impressive list of pub
lications prepared under the en
lightened direction of Professor
Fisher," while The Annals com
mented that it was "a valuable con
tribution to the study of interna
tional socialism during the World
War."
Books based on material emanat
ing from the Hoover Library have
been considered so authentic and
complete, that acquisition of the 19-
book series validates the slogan "A
Hoover Library in your own li
brary."
The Hoover Library, conceived in
war and dedicated to war and peace,
has become a source of authority for
world peacemakers.
Serving in wartime, the library
contains a powerful siren ready to
■blast forth an air raid warning.

rial relating to the World War in
the Hoover War Library have at
tracted hundreds of scholars to its
reading rums since the library's in
ception in May, 1941.
Private documents, diaries, and
private collections throughout the
world have been purchased, and on
June 20, 1941, when the library was
dedicated, Kamiel Lefevere came out
from the Riverside Church in New
York to give a Carillon concert from
the Library tower to a multitude of
distinguished scholars and visitors
who heard the President of the
American Library Association com
ment on the significance of the new
library.
No sooner had the chiming notes
of the "Star Spangled Banner"
drifted away from the dedication
ceremony, than shipments of docu
ments, books, pamphlets, leaflets,
and posters —19 cases of them—
flooded the library's receiving room.
With the arrival of source mate
rial on War, Revolution, and Peace
came the research scholars. From
Idaho came Professor James F.
Clarke to investigate the "Rise ot
Bulgarian Nationalism"; Dr. Suz
anne Engelmann came across the
continent from New York to analyze
"Education in Nazi Germany"; and
Mrs. Betty Klein commuted from
Redwood City to study "Sexual
Symbolism in Propaganda.'
Graduate students, too, found a
wealth of material in the Hoover
Library and devoted most of their
research time in the Hoover reading
room in preparation for their Ph.W.'s
and M.A.'s on topics such as "Youth's
Opinion on War," and the "Foreign
Policy of Dr. Gustav Stresemann."
W. H. Chamberlin, of the "Chris
tian Science Monitor," wrote, "One
of the most valuable and stimulating
pieces of research finds expression
in the series of books which have
come . . . from the rich reserves of
the Hoover Library."
Soon after dedication of the Hoov
er Library the University Press be
gan humming and by last week, 19
books based on research in the
Hoover Libe were published.
Nineteen books — beginning with
airman of Directors, Ralph H.
TTitz' "Fall of the German Empire,"
and Fisher's and Bunyan's "The
Bolshevik Revolution," continuing
to the latest. "Raymond Poincare and
the French Presidency," by Gordon
Wright—caused the nation to sit up
with notice.
Back in the nation's capital, Stan
ford's Hoover Library was regarded
with special interest, and soon repre
sentatives from several war agencies
came West to consult the resources
of the institution.
When Olga Hess Gankin and H. H.
Fisher collaborated to write "The
Bolsheviks and the World War," a
newspaper across the continent
wrote that it is "undoubtedly des
tined to occupy a place of honor in
the already impressive list of pub
lications prepared under the en
lightened direction of Professor
Fisher," while The Annals com
mented that it was "a valuable con
tribution to the study of interna
tional socialism during the World
War."
Books based on material emanat
ing from the Hoover Library have
been considered so authentic and
complete, that acquisition of the 19-
book series validates the slogan "A
Hoover Library in your own li
brary."
The Hoover Library, conceived in
