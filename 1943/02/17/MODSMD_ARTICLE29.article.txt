# Nazi Armies in Donets Basin Face Annihilation After 300-Mile Drive
## 
### 
LONDON, Feb. 16 (U.R)—Kharkov, Russia's fourth city, fell today to a
triumphant Red army which had swept westward 300 miles from Stalingrad
in a crushing 89-day winter offensive.
The historic victory, matched only by the saving of Moscow, Leningrad,
and Stalingrad, was won in a blazing battle which carried Red army guards

into the streets of the city to rout
the flower of the German army.
It was a desperate stand that the
Germans made and their defeat left
their entire army in the Donets basin
and the Rostov area threatened im
minently with encirclement and an
nihilation.
It also left the German High Com
mand facing the probable necessity
of withdrawing its entire southern
line 250 miles west to the Dnieper
River line, based on Kiev.
Guardsmen met Nazi St or m
Troopers in the suburbs of Kharkov
in the climactic phase of the fight.
The Russians fought their way yard
by yard into the streets and through
them. They routed an entire corps
of S.F. combat troops, two crack
tank divisions, a motorized division
and an assorted infantry division—
tens of thousands of the best troops
Adolf Hitler had.
It was shortly before 9 p.m. in
London when the news came. As
they had done Sunday when Rostov
fell, the Russians issued their spe
cial communique in time to get a
vast listening audience including the
secret radio listeners in German
held Europe.
