# New Hawaiian Room Records From Dec. 7
## 
### 
Not many students realize that the
Hoover War Library, our now
famed campus landmark, is more
than a collection of books and mis-
I cellaneous data concerning World
i War I. Yet a well-organized staff
j sorts constantly accumulating rnate
; rial from world-wide sources of in
j formation on both the last and the
current wars.
Recently a group of faculty mem
bers under the leadership of Chan
cellor Ray Lyman Wilbur began ar
rangements to gather information
from Hawaii dated around Dec. 7.
1941. The main work of this infor
mal committee is to organize the
collection, to interest former friends
and colleagues from the Islands in
| helping contribute toward it, ancl to
try to encourage the large group of
students from Hawaii who are now
at Stanford in finding material from
their families and friends at home.
A number of former Stanford peo
ple have made, and are making, im
â–  portant contributions. Ray Vitousek.
here last year, whose father, Martin
| Vitousek, was above Pearl Harbor
during the Jap attack in a plane
which was actually machine-gunned,
; is sending the entries in his father's
j diary of eye-witness accounts of the
thrilling, unbelievable event.
Major Montgomery Clarke, who
received his law degree on the Farm
J in 1932 and who has been with the
: Military Government Office in Hono
lulu is making a collection of arti
cles of military law relating to the
Islands.
President Sinclair of the Univer
sity of Hawaii is collecting material
on the work of educational institu
tions of the territory during the war.
Many of the periodicals and refer
ences and much of the military data
cannot be shipped through while the
| war is on. but the committee has set

I up collecting groups in the Islands
! to keep these materials intact until
! they can be brought to the mainland.
The Public Relations Office of Mili
tary Intelligence is setting aside re
ports that will be valuable to stu
' dents here after the war.
Already here in the embryo col
lection are cerca-Pearl Harbor edi
tions of newspapers from the Islands
including Nippu Jiji (Japanese), The
Honolulu Advertiser, the Honolulu
Star-Bulletin and newspapers from
the islands of Maui, Cauai, and Ha
waii, brought by Professor Leland T.
Chapin who was in the Islands at
the time.
Dr. Wilbur is considered well able
to direct this project since he has had
so much experience in the Pacific. As
former Secretary of the Interior and
member of the Pacific Institute, he
had supervision of the Hawaiian Is
lands and gathered a warm follow
ing of friends there.
Among other eminent men in the
j committee are Professors Thomas A.
Bailey, Harold Whitman Bradley,
and Edgar Eugene Robinson of the
History Department; Professor Paul
Harmon Kirkpatrick, head of the
Physics Dept., Professor Eliot Grin
nell Mears, Graduate School of Busi
ness, Professor R. H. Lutz, head of
the Hoover War Library; L. E. Bas
sett, Emeritus Professor of Speech
and Drama, and Professor Chapin of
the Speech and Drama Dept.
Each man in this group has defi
nite interests in the Hawaiian pic
ture or has taught there and all hope
to have in the War Libe for future
scholars a great deal of loose-leaf
material and special papers pertinent
to martial law problems of the Islands
and matters relating to combat zones
during the war. The group has not
vet been chosen in its entirety and
others will soon lie included.
