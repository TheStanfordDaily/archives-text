# Indian Mermen Can Break Two School Records
## 
### 
With their "cripples" beginning to
round into shape, Stanford's varsity
swimmers are making preparations
to crack two school relay records
when their next meet rolls around.
A meet may be held with College
of Pacific this Friday but it prob
ably will be postponed until early
next quarter since C.O.P. doesn't
consider itself in good enough shape
yet. The Cards are scheduled to
face San Jose State Feb. 26 here.
Don Smith, Jim Gamble, and
Corky Schreiber, who have yet to
enter a meet this quarter, may be
ready to go against San Jose. Smith,
kept out first with an arm injury,
still has one incomplete to make up,
but he expects to do it by next week.
Gamble has started to work out aft
er at} injured ankle, and Schreiber
has said he will start diving soon.
The records in question are the
300-yard medley mark of 3:0442
against the Olympic Club last week.
If Gamble gets into shape to handle
the free style race and Weeden and
Cashin bear down, Coach Ernie
Brandsten believes they can break
the mark.
Eastman, Mapel, Hefflefinger, and
Cashin swam the 400-yard race in
3:43.2 Saturday after each had
swum in at least one or more pre
vious races. The return of Smith and
Gamble, two capable sprinters, will
leave a fresh sprint team able to
break the record.
