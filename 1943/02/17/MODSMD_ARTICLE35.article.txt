# Ruggers Outclass Tars in 23-6 Win
## 
### 
Fresh from Saturday's 23-6 vic
tory over an outclassed British Navy
squad, the Card fifteen opened an
intensive practice period yesterday
for the game with U.S.F., Feb. 24.
The U.S.F. game, scheduled origi
nally for next Saturday, will be
played Wednesday of next week, it
was announced yesterday. Coach
Harry Maloney is trying to resched
ule the coming match with Menlo
J.C., also scheduled originally for
Saturday, for Feb. 24 ns well.
Led by field captain Tyler Norton,
the Indian ruggers led by 20 to 0 at
the end of the first half. The tars
were both lighter and slower than
the Maloney men, but put up a game
fight.
Sophomore Dave Brown led the
Stanford scoring with two tries and
two conversions. Buck Fawcett and
Carson Rasmussen each tallied with
a try and conversion apiece, and Bob
Kinsinger also hit the matlows' pay
streak, the conversion failing.
A try, be it said, is rugby par
lance for a touchdown, and is good
for three points. The conversion
counts for two.
Both British scores were on pen
alty kicks, and both were rung up
by Jory.
