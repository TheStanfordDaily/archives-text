Early on the morning of Aug. 15,
1940, just three months after Baron
von Faulkenhausen took over as
Governor-General of Belgium, a
man walked casually past the mail
box of the Kommandatur and
dropped an envelope in it addressed
to His Excellency. A few minutes
later the Baron was peering through
his monocle at the world's oldest un
derground newspaper, La Libre Bel
gique.
Inaugurated during the last war
as a propaganda weapon against the
tyranny of the German warlords in
Belgium, La Libre Belgique has not
missed a deadline since its rebirth
two years ago. It has become the
biggest headache of the German
Gestapo just as it did 25 years ago
when its propaganda drove one of
l the Kaiser's henchmen insane.
Today housed in the stacks of the
| Hoover War Library is the complete
tile of this famous Belgian paper
collected during the last war and
brought to this country for safe
j keeping. This collection in the War
Library is one of the very tew rec
! ords of the Belgian underground ex
j isting in the world today.
The biography of La Libre Bel
j gique begins back in the 1900's when
Victor Jourdain, editor of a Catho
lic paper in Brussels, was preaching
1 pacifism and disarmament to the
Belgian people. When Von Kluck's
| army smashed across the frontier
j the blow nearly killed Jourdain. He

came out of retirement a few months
latei and, revitalized by fury at the
age of 74. he created Belgium's first
underground newspaper.
Volume One. Issue One, Hit the
streets of Brussels on Feb. 1, 1915.
Subdistributor were recruited from
among the students at the Jesuit
College of St. Michel. One of these
students initialed the custom of

sending copies to the Governor Gen
eral.
La Libre Belgique was a night
mare to Von Bissing. Each morning
he would find a copy of the paper
in his office reporting in detail all
the latest Allied victories as well as
German casualties. His crippled old
charwoman was completely over
looked by the German agents, al
though she religiously lett a copy in
the Baron's office each night as she
cleaned it. She also clipped the
war news from the London Times
which the Baron threw in the
wastebasket each day after it was
mailed to him with much secrecy
from the German headquarters.
The paper continued to operate
throughout the war despite the

frantic efforts of the Germans to ui
cover the source; and on the da
King Albert returned to Brussels,
boy handed him a copy of the fin
issue. After the war La Libre Bt.
gique emerged as a daily, but wit
the German occupation in l!' 4-0
once more assumed its role iis
crusader for truth and justice i
Nazi-occurLtl Bel-,ium.

paper, is shown. The paper was published every day during the last
was as long as Germans occupied Belgium. Publications was resumed

Library contains a complete file of the paper during its publication
during the First World War.
Early on the morning of Aug. 15,
1940, just three months after Baron
von Faulkenhausen took over as
Governor-General of Belgium, a
man walked casually past the mail
box of the Kommandatur and
dropped an envelope in it addressed
to His Excellency. A few minutes
later the Baron was peering through
his monocle at the world's oldest un
derground newspaper, La Libre Bel
gique.
Inaugurated during the last war
as a propaganda weapon against the
tyranny of the German warlords in
Belgium, La Libre Belgique has not
missed a deadline since its rebirth
two years ago. It has become the
biggest headache of the German
Gestapo just as it did 25 years ago
when its propaganda drove one of
l the Kaiser's henchmen insane.
Today housed in the stacks of the

tile of this famous Belgian paper
collected during the last war and
brought to this country for safe
j keeping. This collection in the War
Library is one of the very tew rec

j isting in the world today.
The biography of La Libre Bel
j gique begins back in the 1900's when
Victor Jourdain, editor of a Catho
lic paper in Brussels, was preaching
1 pacifism and disarmament to the
Belgian people. When Von Kluck's

age of 74. he created Belgium's first
underground newspaper.

La Libre Belgique was a night
mare to Von Bissing. Each morning
he would find a copy of the paper
in his office reporting in detail all
the latest Allied victories as well as
German casualties. His crippled old
charwoman was completely over
looked by the German agents, al
