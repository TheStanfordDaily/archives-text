# Farm Nine Plays Surfsters Today
## 
### 
If it doesn't rain Stanford's base
ball team will clash with the Coast
Guard Surf Riders this afternoon at
3:15 on the Sunken Diamond.
In this, their fourth start of the
season, the Indian nine will be trying
for their first win. Bill Brokaw will
probably start on the mound and will
be backed up by Doc Mason and
Larry Wolf. Catching chores will be
handled by Ward Walkup. Other
probable Indian starters are Duke
Hammett on first. Jack Biownson on
second, Bob Brown at short and Lee
Scott on the third sack. Bill Harms,
Ed Washburn, and Lee Merriman in
the outfield round out the lineup.
Although no Surf Rider lineup has
yet been received it is not unlikely
that there will be some big name
players on the roster.
