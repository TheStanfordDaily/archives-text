# Psychology Lab Held in Nursery
## 
### 
From 6 to 12 hours a week about
15 Stanford coeds trudge up to the
campus nursery school at the top of
the Row to observe the little ones
at work and play. All of this observ
ing and note-taking is done for the
lab requirements of Psychology
Nursery School Procedure, but ac
cording to some of the observers, it's
as good a pastime as a movie tour
with Bob Hope.
One 2-year-old boy evidently re
alizes that later on in life he won't
have much time to rest; he is always
begging the teacher to start rest
periods way ahead of time. One of
the girls realizes that taking care
of a home is a hard and serious job
and so she's getting a head start. All
the other girls spend their mornings
with color crayons and other such
things, but she completely ignores
all childish doings and spends her
time ironing and attending to other
domestic tasks.
