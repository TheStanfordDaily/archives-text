# Document Room Has War Books
## 
### 
The document room in the library
| added another feature to the serv
ices it renders the University when
iit set out a table of current war
| literature.
From the thousands of documents
printed in Washington each year
which are sent to the Stanford
Document Division, the staff is seg-
I regating the most interesting and
most topical, hoping that any stu
dent with a little time for browsing
will also find them worthwhile. •
On hand at present are many
pamphlets from the official agencies
; representing Norway, Russia, Aus
j tralia, the Philippines, and other Al
' lies. The official government man-
I uals from Army and Navy Depart
ments are on display with other
i pertinent material.
Miss Minna Stillman. head of the
Document Division, expresses the
hope that students will find inter
. esting the charts which are hung
j just outside the entrance every week.
These charts portray the action of
the war during the week throughout
the world and indicate the success
and nature of activity. They are ac
companied by maps and the best
! news photos from the fronts.
Miss Stillman indicates that
though the papers usually sought
from the Document Division, are for
work ui a specialized nature, she and
Miss Gladys Andrews, assistant, are
glad to locate papers for all students.
She said that all documents avail
able are not cataloged in the main
files, but can be obtained from the
Document Room without too great
a delav.
