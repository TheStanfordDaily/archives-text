# Intensive Japanese Is '20 Units of Hell'
## 
### 
America didn't know the enemy that struck at Pearl Harbor.
Except for a common impression that the emblem of the Rising Sun
>tood for a collection of land that surrounded a city named Tokyo where
many American capitalists had importing businesses and where silkworms
throve, the history and habits of the Japanese people were unexplored

fields for a majority of Americans. *
The lack of education in Far East
ern culture was one more distinct
military liability to a people facing
global war with little concept of the
the problems involved. Radio par
ticularly had iflade a stock of trained
interpreters invaluable to military
intelligence.
On the other hand, the Japanese
had studied our history intensively;
their intelligence department had
experts in every phase of Americana.

Today the gap between the two
preparations is being closed by ihe
efforts of such men as Stanford's
Douglas Atcheson. acting instructor
in the School of Humanities.
Atcheson's Control
Stanford's Mr. Atcheson is a short,
hurried man who probably has more
academic control over a particular
group of students than any instruc
tor in the Farm's history.
In charge of a course called "In
tensive Japanese." he controls all of
the quarter units of a group of 24
Stanford students who are devoting
an entire 20 units work to study of
the Nipponese language.
Six hours a day, five days a week,
ihe group writes, reads, and con
verses in Japanese wilh liberal doses
of "fundamental" grammar thrown
in. Since the Japanese language has
that delightful Oriental trait of pos
sessing hundreds of characters with
corresponding complications in pro
nunciation and grammar, the result
ing course is fervently promoted by
lakers as No. 1 grind of the school
vear.
Scholastic Hell
The general consensus is that it's
one hell of a workout."
Day in and day out the schedule
.ocs like this: 8 a.m.—Writing; 9
».m. Reading; 10 a.m. — Grammar
md Diction; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.—Con
ersation. Saturday morning brings
i weekly three-hour examination.
The point to the stiff program is
hat the "one helluva workout" will
ome day lead to an equally stiff job.
The verbs and adverbs that the "in
ensive 24" learn from their instruc
tors will soon be replaced by verbs
nd adverbs floating in from Tokyo,
Cobe. Osaka, and other spots on the
un land.

They may mean lives saved, se
crets revealed, or in most cases they
will probably add up to a mass of
sickening propaganda that has to be
heard, recorded, and endured for
intelligence files.
Demand High
The demand for these interpreters
far exceeds the supply, and when the
Stanford trainees enter military serv
ice they will immediately enter ad-

vanced Army schools to complete
their training.
Assisting Atcheson in instruction
are Mrs. Tuksoon Kim, Margarita
Kopf, and Kuang Hao Hsiao, assist
ants in the Humanities Department,
and Professor W. L. Schwartz of the
Romanic Language Department.
Progress thus far, according to
Atcheson, is heartening. A majority
of the 24 are showing a good grasp
of their new dish in the non-com
petitive exams given weekly.
Roommates and fraternity bro
thers of the trainees note, however,
that the 20-unit scholastic menu is
producing odd results. "They are
turning into characters that spout
Japanese." Some are acquiring Jap
nicknames such as Hirohito and
Tojo; most of them are becoming
confirmed library hermits.
But they'll be useful in the com
ing parade down the main drag of
Tokyo.

Atcheson's Control
Stanford's Mr. Atcheson is a short,
hurried man who probably has more
academic control over a particular
group of students than any instruc
tor in the Farm's history.
In charge of a course called "In
tensive Japanese." he controls all of
the quarter units of a group of 24
Stanford students who are devoting
an entire 20 units work to study of
the Nipponese language.
Six hours a day, five days a week,
ihe group writes, reads, and con
verses in Japanese wilh liberal doses
of "fundamental" grammar thrown
in. Since the Japanese language has
that delightful Oriental trait of pos
sessing hundreds of characters with
corresponding complications in pro
nunciation and grammar, the result
ing course is fervently promoted by
lakers as No. 1 grind of the school
vear.

one hell of a workout."

i weekly three-hour examination.
The point to the stiff program is
hat the "one helluva workout" will
ome day lead to an equally stiff job.
The verbs and adverbs that the "in
ensive 24" learn from their instruc
tors will soon be replaced by verbs
nd adverbs floating in from Tokyo,
Cobe. Osaka, and other spots on the
un land.

They may mean lives saved, se
crets revealed, or in most cases they
will probably add up to a mass of
sickening propaganda that has to be
heard, recorded, and endured for
intelligence files.
Demand High
The demand for these interpreters
far exceeds the supply, and when the
Stanford trainees enter military serv
ice they will immediately enter ad-

vanced Army schools to complete
their training.
Assisting Atcheson in instruction
are Mrs. Tuksoon Kim, Margarita
Kopf, and Kuang Hao Hsiao, assist
ants in the Humanities Department,
and Professor W. L. Schwartz of the
Romanic Language Department.
Progress thus far, according to
Atcheson, is heartening. A majority
of the 24 are showing a good grasp
of their new dish in the non-com
petitive exams given weekly.
Roommates and fraternity bro
thers of the trainees note, however,
that the 20-unit scholastic menu is
producing odd results. "They are
turning into characters that spout
Japanese." Some are acquiring Jap
nicknames such as Hirohito and
Tojo; most of them are becoming
confirmed library hermits.

throve, the history and habits of the Japanese people were unexplored

fields for a majority of Americans. *
The lack of education in Far East
ern culture was one more distinct
military liability to a people facing
global war with little concept of the
the problems involved. Radio par
ticularly had iflade a stock of trained
interpreters invaluable to military
intelligence.
On the other hand, the Japanese
had studied our history intensively;
their intelligence department had
experts in every phase of Americana.

Today the gap between the two
preparations is being closed by ihe
efforts of such men as Stanford's
Douglas Atcheson. acting instructor
in the School of Humanities.
Atcheson's Control
Stanford's Mr. Atcheson is a short,
hurried man who probably has more
academic control over a particular
group of students than any instruc
tor in the Farm's history.
In charge of a course called "In
tensive Japanese." he controls all of
the quarter units of a group of 24
Stanford students who are devoting
an entire 20 units work to study of
the Nipponese language.
Six hours a day, five days a week,
ihe group writes, reads, and con
verses in Japanese wilh liberal doses
of "fundamental" grammar thrown
in. Since the Japanese language has
that delightful Oriental trait of pos
sessing hundreds of characters with
corresponding complications in pro
nunciation and grammar, the result
ing course is fervently promoted by
lakers as No. 1 grind of the school
vear.
Scholastic Hell
The general consensus is that it's
one hell of a workout."
Day in and day out the schedule
.ocs like this: 8 a.m.—Writing; 9
».m. Reading; 10 a.m. — Grammar
md Diction; 1 p.m. to 4 p.m.—Con
ersation. Saturday morning brings
i weekly three-hour examination.
The point to the stiff program is
hat the "one helluva workout" will
ome day lead to an equally stiff job.
The verbs and adverbs that the "in
ensive 24" learn from their instruc
tors will soon be replaced by verbs
nd adverbs floating in from Tokyo,
Cobe. Osaka, and other spots on the
un land.

They may mean lives saved, se
crets revealed, or in most cases they
will probably add up to a mass of
sickening propaganda that has to be
heard, recorded, and endured for
intelligence files.
Demand High
The demand for these interpreters
far exceeds the supply, and when the
Stanford trainees enter military serv
ice they will immediately enter ad-

vanced Army schools to complete
their training.
Assisting Atcheson in instruction
are Mrs. Tuksoon Kim, Margarita
Kopf, and Kuang Hao Hsiao, assist
ants in the Humanities Department,
and Professor W. L. Schwartz of the
Romanic Language Department.
Progress thus far, according to
Atcheson, is heartening. A majority
of the 24 are showing a good grasp
of their new dish in the non-com
petitive exams given weekly.
Roommates and fraternity bro
thers of the trainees note, however,
that the 20-unit scholastic menu is
producing odd results. "They are
turning into characters that spout
Japanese." Some are acquiring Jap
nicknames such as Hirohito and
Tojo; most of them are becoming
confirmed library hermits.
But they'll be useful in the com
ing parade down the main drag of
Tokyo.

students in the class practice in all forms of the Nipponese language.
