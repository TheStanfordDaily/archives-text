# Sacks Symbol Of Feeling
## 
### 
Gifts of flour meant a chance to
eat, a chance to live, to the Belgian
refugees in the last war and they
didn't forget that the Mr. Herbert
Hoover and his Commission for Re
lief in Belgium were responsible for
those welcome gifts.
After the war, when the Belgians
could build their lives again, the
white flour sacks, now cut into large
white squares, cleaned and pressed,
began to arrive back at the head
quarters of the Relief Commission.
Only the sacks were no longer
plain and white. The Belgians, fa
mous as are all Europeans for their
exquisite handwork, had embroi
dered them with legends of their ap
preciation in brilliant colors and in
beautiful designs. Each sack which
once had arrived in Belgium holding
precious food, now after long pa
tient hours, was returned to the
commission, a work of art.
Worked on some of the more elab
orate squares are actually identified
buildings in Belgium. There are few
complete pictures, however. Most of
the squares have colorful symbolic
sheaves of wheat, or unusual com
binations of the Belgian and Ameri
can flags.
With the hundreds of embroidered
pictures arriving intermittently on
the fifth floor of the Hoover War
Libe where they are kept in the
Hoover Archives, are small chil
dren's garments made altogether of
renovated flour sacks, little trousers,
shirts, and dresses all excellently
and patiently sewn and sent back to
America to show how much the
sacking meant.
It- has not been only the growing
Belgians who have been grateful for

food during their terrible national
emergency. Countless cards and pic
tares have arrived here from the
refugee children of 25 years ago.
Each card has laborious printing to
express the child's thanks and each
has been colorfully painted. The
most common theme, one which in
trigued both children and adults,
was the combination of their flag and
ours. Even the very small children
of kindergarten age sent woven mats
as gifts to the commission.
Even after the long interval of

lime since the gifts of Hour were
sent, the messages of appreciation
are still arriving. The majority are
housed in the Hoover Library, un
der the direction of Mrs. Scida L.
Bone, Hoover Library Archivist, and
a few of them are in Mr. Hoover's
home, and. at present, there is a dis
play of several of them on the ground
floor of the War Library.


The Belgians appreciated the Hour sent to them in the last war and
returned the (lour sacks, embroidered in brilliant colors with designs
and legends to show their appreciation. The (lags showed Belgian
buildings, symbolic sheaves of wheat and unusual combinations of
Belgium and American (lags.
