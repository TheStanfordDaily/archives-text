# The
						Red Cross Serves Humanity
## 
### 
At Stanford the American Red
Cross conducts three activities, the
surgical dressings workshop, the
blood bank, and the volunteer
nurse's aides.
The surgical dressings workshop
is open to every woman on campus.
The present quota of dressings is
being made for the Army, and due
to the increased number of troops at
the war fronts the Army has just is
sued a call of 18,000.00 more dress
ings

Since the War Board Workshop
was dissolved, the women who were
assigned hours Ihere have been
shifted to the Red Cross Workshop.
The workshop is located on the top
floor of the Women's Clubhouse, and
it is open from .10 to 12 and from 1
to 4 Mondays through Fridays.
The blood bank which handles
Stanford students is a mobile unit.
The unit arrives in Palo Alto on the
first and third Tuesdays of every
month.
In addition to Stanford students,
however, the unit also handles do
nors from Palo Alto, Los Altos, and
Mountain View. Stanford is conse
quently only allowed a certain pro
portion of the time during which the
unit is here. At present, Stanford
sends seven students to Palo Alto,
where the unit operates, at 11:20.
11:40. 1. 1:20. and 1:40.

Since the mobile unit works at the
Palo Alto Community Center, the
I motor corps unit of the Palo Alto
Red Cross transports the students
to and from Palo Alto.
During the last Autumn Quarter.
112 Stanford students donated their
blood, some of them several times.
This quarter, due to the increased

demand for the blood plasma by the
services, the Stanford quota has
been raised to 1,000 pints.
The nurse's aide units at Stanford,
(he second of which began its pre
liminary training in the hospital last
week, work at the Palo Alto Hospi
tal.
There is a course being given in
which the nurse's aide training is
taught. After the course has ended,
however, the nurse's aides must
continue to work at the hospital for
150 hours a year.

Next week, Tuesday through Fri
day, tlie American Red Cross i.s con
ducting a War Funds Drive.
This drive is being made to secure
money to carry on the activities of
the American Red Cross for another
year.
In addition to maintaining such
units as there are at Stanford
the Rod Cross also cares for families
with members in the armed services,
aids United States and Allied pris
oners of war, furnishes emergency
medical supplies and equipment
' conducts a world-wide "missing
; persons" servic e, and functions ir.
time of an epidemic or disaster.
The drive at Stanford is to sup
port these as well as the local serv
ices. Stanford has been given a
quota of $3,000 for this drive. Any
amount of money will be gratefully
received.
