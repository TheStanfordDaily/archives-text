# Red Cross Drive Begins Next Week
## 
### 
The Red Cross War Fund drive
rolls into high gear at Stanford next
Tuesday when every living group
on campus will be canvassed for
contributions.
Despite the fact that the chairman
of the drive, Miriam King, is now in
the hospital, all plans for complete
campus coverage have been made
and it is hoped that Stanford will
go over its $3,000 quota before the
end of next week.
Precedes National by a Week
Before entering the hospital drive
Chairman King said, "Our short, to
the-point drive precedes the na
tional, month-long drive by one
weekâ€”this was arranged in order
not to interfere with studies. Be
cause our drive precedes the na
tional campaign, the Red Cross tells
us that what we do will be indica
tive of what the nation will do. If
we kick through with a new high
the fact will be publicized and this
is the best publicity that Stanford
caii have."
This war fund drive has hitched
its wagon to a 130-million-dollar
quota for the entire nation. Of these
130 millions, it is planned to turn
SO over to the National Red Cross
organization, while the other 50 mil
lion will be split up by local Red
Cross chapters throughout the
country.
With this money the Red Cross
has established what is probably the
world's greatest service for people
who have needed help.

A few of the more outstanding
Red Cross services are conducting
a blood donor service so that
wounded men may have needed
blood plasma, making surgical
dressings for Army and Navy hos
pitals and for use right on the bat
tlefield, recruiting nurses for both
the Army and Navy, and aiding our
prisoners of war.
The present war fund drive is a
campaign in which the money col
lected will be used on Americans
exclusively.
It is emphasized that this is a
drive for funds, not necessarily
membership, although all who con
tribute a dollar or more to the fund
automatically become Red Cross
members.
It is expected that all Stanford
students will contribute at least a
dollar to this drive so that the Farm
may exceed its $3,000 quota.

Bandages rolled yesterday at
the Red Cross work room in the
Women's Clubhouse totaled 820.
which is 180 short of the daily goal
of 1.000.
