# DEAN'S TRIP
## Yost Reports On Conference 
### 
Back from a four-day stay in
Southern California, Dean of Women
Mary Yost yesterday reaffirmed that
Stanford will oiler greater training
opportunities than ever to women in
the future and that every woman
should take advantage of them.
While in Los Angeles she attended
a conference of the Western Per
sonnel Bureau as Stanford's repre
sentative and spoke at a meeting of
the Stanford Mothers' Club of Los
Angeles.
Mothers Interested
"I found the mothers very inter
ested in our war training program
for women," she said, "and they
seemed convinced that their daugh
ters can get the training they need
here. They agree with the Univer
sity that college trained women may
be the only bridge over this period
when the men's education is dis
rupted."
Speakers at the conference espe
cially urged women to train in the
professions such as teaching, law,
and social service. Stanford is pre
pared to train its women in these
subjects, Dean Yost declared.
A full description of the war
training courses being given now
and those planned for the future will
be contained in a pamphlet to be
given to all women students before
spring vacation, the Dean said.
Miss Yost said that at the confer
ence of the personnel bureau two
government officials stressed the im
portance of women's getting all the
training they can, since the need for
trained personnel is so great.
Those at the conference were told
by an OPA official that the student
should no longer take what he wants
but take what will equip him to do
the most good. In this lies the solu
tion to problems of campus morale,
the speaker believed.
Long Range Training
Of particular interest at the ses
sion, according to Miss Yost, was
the Stanford plan of long range
training programs which may be
shortened if necessary. In other
words, the student gets the full
value of whatever training she has
time to take.
