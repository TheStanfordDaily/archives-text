# Knickerbocker to Present Talk on African Situation
## 
### 
When H. R. Knickerbocker, Pulit
zer Prize-winning war correspond
ent, returns to the United States
from North Africa, he will bring with
him sidelights on the current Allied-
Axis lineup in Africa and the Casa
blanca conference.
He speaks at the Memorial Hall a
week from Thursday, Feb. 25, a day
after a lecture at Town Hall in San
Francisco.
Knickerbocker began his roving
career as son of a Methodist preacher
in Texas. His family, during his
childhood, never stayed in a town
for more than four years. He came
to New York at 20 and went from
there to Munich where he began his
career as a foreign correspondent at
the time of Hitler's infamous "beer
house putsch."
During the "putsch" Knicker
bocker was studying psychiatry, but
in the excitement of the affair, he
joined some newspaper friends and

began the career that has led ob
servers to call him "the modern
Richard Harding Davis."
Tickets for Knickerbocker's lecture
are on sale at the A.S.S.U. office and
by members of Sigma Delta Chi.
