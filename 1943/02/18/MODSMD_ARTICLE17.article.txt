## Russians Threaten Germans in Ukraine 
### 
LONDON. Thursday, Feb. 18â€”
Triumphant Russian troops sweep
ing over the snow-covered flat land
belond Kharkov, have captured Bo
godukhov, 31 miles west-northwest,
and they have taken the key rail
road city of Slavyansk in a new
threat to the Germans in the entire
Donets Basin - Ukraine theaters,
communiques announced today.
On the Kharkov front, Col.-Gen.
Philip Golikovj's forces were making
better than one mile an hour in pur
suit of broken German units, lead
ing military observers to believe
that he might strike a lightning blow
at the Konotop railroad junction, 100
miles northwest of Kharkov and 130
miles northeast of Kiev.
By taking Konotop, Golikovj
would cut off both those great Ger
man defense bases from Kiev.
By storming into Slavyansk, to
which the Germans have clung des
perately, the Russians have cap
tured a railroad junction from which
they could pour men into Lozo
vaya, 74 miles south of Kharkov,
farthest southwest point of the Rus
sian advance so far and on to the
Dneiper River bend 60 miles away.
