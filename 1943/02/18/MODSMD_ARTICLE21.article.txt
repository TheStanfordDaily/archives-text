# Canned Meat Sales Banned for 60 Days

### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 17â€”The Of
fice of Price Administration, in an
order effective at midnight, banned
sales of canned meat, canned fish, and
shellfish until the start of meat ra
tioning some 60 days hence.
The order is intended to check
heavy consumer "hoarder" buying
that has threatened to reduce sup
plies of these items to dangerously
low levels, OPA said.
It was requested by Food Admin
istrator Claude Wickard and comes
only three days in advance of nation
wide registration for nearly all
canned foods.
The action removed still anoiher
foundation stone from the steadily
narrowing base of the nation's civi
lian economy. Already rationed or
soon to be are such staples as sugar,
coffee, meat, most canned, frozen or
bottled fruits and vegetables, and
there is strong likelihood that butter
and cheese may soon be added to
(he list.
