# SENIOR DANCE
## Prom Bids Are Now on Sale 
### 
'"The day is drawing near; get
your bids for the Senior Prom now
or you may be left out." Thus Irv
Fine, co-chairman of the Senior
Prom with Nancy Schermerhorn,
warned all seniors last night. In a
few days bids will be sold to the en
tire campus, and because there is a
limited number, some seniors may
be disappointed if they do not pur
chase theirs now.
Bids for the "Night in Latin Amer
ica," to be held Feb. 27 in the Wom
en's Gym, are on sale in the A.S.S.U.
office now for $3 a couple.
Although the theme stresses Latin
America, Garry Nottingham, who
will play for the prom, has promised
that there will be a minimum of
rumbas, congas, and the like. In
other words, there will be music to
fit the taste of every dancer.
''The natural atmosphere of the
Women's Gym will blend perfectly
with the decorations we have
planned," Jim Hirst, decorations
chairman, announced. He and Jane
Armstrong have worked out a
unique plan of transforming the gym
which will not be disclosed until
dance time.
With Nottingham's band will be
Sonja Shaw, featured vocalist for
the National Broadcasting Company.
She is well known to the campus,
having appeared here for the Senior
Prom last year and for the Sopho
more Cotillion two weeks ago.
Plans for an all-senior dinner
could not be carried out at the last
minute because of the lack of on
campus facilities. Several fraterni
ties are planning to give dinners at
their houses before the dance in
honor of those men who are gradu
ating at the end of the quarter and
will be unable to be here for Senior
Week festivities.
