# Campaign Solicits Books for Victors
## 
### 
By the end of this week, the cam
pus Victory Book Commit tee is hop- ,
ing to collect one book from every
Stanford student to send immediate
ly to isolated posts, sailors, nearby j
Army camps, USO centers, and to i
British ships in San Francisco. All
books from paper-bound mysteries
to current best sellers will be ac- j
cepted from living groups as long as !
they are in good physical condition. !
The campus campaign, directed by |
Margaret Dorris, is a part of the j
national Victory Book Campaign
which is sponsored by the Red
Cross, USO, and the American Li
brary Association.
"One book that a student may
sacrifice will bring to soldiers sta
tioned at isolated outposts their only j
form of recreation,'' said Miss Dorris. I
