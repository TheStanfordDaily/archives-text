# War Transforms Paly Store As Five Men Join Services

### Lucy Thompson 
The war has come to Phelps-Ter
kel. Five men are serving in the
services and the store has had to add
a women's department, according
to Mr. McElyea, manager of the
Stanford branch.
"We have always wanted to in
stall a women's department," he
.said, but there has never been room
enough in the store to display the
clothes. Now that the men's buy
ing has dropped off, we have the
room and we are putting in the de
partment.
"As far as interference from the
the war goes," he continued, "the
only inconvenience that we are hav
ing is that deliveries are slow. The
transportation difficulties, the labor
shortage, and the difficulties in get
ting materials have slowed down our
service.
"That, together with the rush on
clothing which has followed the
shoe rationing order, has so clogged
our store that we now cannot prom
ise to deliver a suit or coat in less
than four weeks. Before this we
have been able to deliver within two
weeks, and, I imagine, we will be

able to return to the two-week
service as soon as the present rush
eases off.
"The store in Palo Alto,"' he con
tinued, "is a branch of the Los An
geles store. We get most of our
merchandise from them. While we
do not have a custom tailor, we do
make suits to measure in our models.
In such cases, we send the measure
ments to Los Angeles where the
suits are made and then shipped to
us.
"In the women's department, how
ever. we are having to buy half of
our clothing outside. The suits and
coats, of course, come from Los An
geles, but we are buying our sweat
ers, play clothes, and dresses.
"We began by selling the men's
sweaters to women," he said, "and
we still are. But we have ordered
women's sweaters to protect our
stock of men's sweaters.
"Going back to the rush on cloth
ing last, week," he continued, "it
was serious. We were busy every
minute of the day all week. This
week buying has returned to a more
normal flow. This is either because
the large items of clothing, like suits

and coats, have been bought by now,
or because the money available to
buy clothes has been spent.
"Whatever the reason, however, i);
is a rather uncomplimentary com
ment on the American public,"
"Our stock of ready-made naval
uniforms has had to be discontinued,
although they may still be ordered.
This is because of the large stocks
which we would have to carry.
Naval officers must usually have
their clothes at once, consequently,
deliveries are too slow to reach
them. Also, governmental regula
tions have interfered by complicat
ing the procedure.
"Going back to the men who have
left here for the services," he said,
"three of them are actually in the
armed forces, one is in the merchant
marine, and one is working for the
Douglas Aircraft Company in Africa.
"Bill Preuss is a second lieutenant
in the Army Administrative Service.
Ed Burton is a private in an anti
aircraft battery. Gordy Williams is
an ensign in the Navy. John Rogers
is in the merchant marine, and Ear).
Shade is working for Douglas in
Africa."

women's sweaters to protect our
stock of men's sweaters.
"Going back to the rush on cloth
ing last, week," he continued, "it
was serious. We were busy every
minute of the day all week. This
week buying has returned to a more
normal flow. This is either because
the large items of clothing, like suits

and coats, have been bought by now,
or because the money available to
buy clothes has been spent.
"Whatever the reason, however, i);
is a rather uncomplimentary com
ment on the American public,"
"Our stock of ready-made naval
uniforms has had to be discontinued,
although they may still be ordered.
This is because of the large stocks
which we would have to carry.
Naval officers must usually have
their clothes at once, consequently,
deliveries are too slow to reach
them. Also, governmental regula
tions have interfered by complicat
ing the procedure.
"Going back to the men who have
left here for the services," he said,
"three of them are actually in the
armed forces, one is in the merchant
marine, and one is working for the
Douglas Aircraft Company in Africa.
"Bill Preuss is a second lieutenant
in the Army Administrative Service.
Ed Burton is a private in an anti
aircraft battery. Gordy Williams is
an ensign in the Navy. John Rogers
is in the merchant marine, and Ear).
Shade is working for Douglas in
Africa."
The war has come to Phelps-Ter
kel. Five men are serving in the
services and the store has had to add
a women's department, according
to Mr. McElyea, manager of the
Stanford branch.
"We have always wanted to in
stall a women's department," he
.said, but there has never been room
enough in the store to display the
clothes. Now that the men's buy
ing has dropped off, we have the
room and we are putting in the de
partment.
"As far as interference from the
the war goes," he continued, "the
only inconvenience that we are hav
ing is that deliveries are slow. The
transportation difficulties, the labor
shortage, and the difficulties in get
ting materials have slowed down our
service.
"That, together with the rush on
clothing which has followed the
shoe rationing order, has so clogged
our store that we now cannot prom
ise to deliver a suit or coat in less
than four weeks. Before this we
have been able to deliver within two
weeks, and, I imagine, we will be

able to return to the two-week
service as soon as the present rush
eases off.
"The store in Palo Alto,"' he con
tinued, "is a branch of the Los An
geles store. We get most of our
merchandise from them. While we
do not have a custom tailor, we do
make suits to measure in our models.
In such cases, we send the measure
ments to Los Angeles where the
suits are made and then shipped to
us.
"In the women's department, how
ever. we are having to buy half of
our clothing outside. The suits and
coats, of course, come from Los An
geles, but we are buying our sweat
ers, play clothes, and dresses.
