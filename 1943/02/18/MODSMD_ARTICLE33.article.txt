men that make up Stanford's 1943
quintet. Today's article concerns
Ed Voss.)

Big Ed Voss (6 feet inches) is
Stanford's pivot man de luxe. Ed is
one of the lop men on the squad. He
was Stanford's leading scorer for
the season last year with a total of
252 points in 29 games and he's go
ing strong so far this season.
Voss is the only other regular vet
eran of last year's national cham
pionship team besides Howie Dal
mar. Offensively and defensively
Big Ed is a top man for Coach Ev
erett Dean to work with. He's a
team player, a strong ball hawk and
an all-round floor man.
Started at Guard
Ed has come a long way since he
played frosh ball for Stanford. Af
ter preping at University High
School in Oakland, Ed took his
:anky frame to the Farm. He started
out as a gangling, \in-co-ordinated
guard but later switched to center
and came along rapidly to take over
a first string berth last year. Ed's
great height is a definite advantage
to the team, especially since he can
handle himself well under the buck
et. He has an effective pivot-re
verse shot which works especially
well.
This year Ed has attempted to do
even more scoring than he did last
year. He Is an effective shooter but
would rather pass the ball from the
center position than shoot himself.
Now. shooting from far out with a
one-handed push shot, Ed has been
rtble to hit the hoop from the side
lines for many a point.
Looks at S.C.
The week-end's tilts with South
ern California and U.C.L.A. are a
couple of games that Voss has been
looking forward to for a long time.

| Ed slumped the last two games at
( San Francisco in the Civir: but he
I claims he has been "lying in the
weeds for S.C." The weeds will
| have to grow pretty tall to outdo
him with his size 13 shoes.
Ed lias good rebound ability. What
j shots the Trojans manage to throw
near the hoop will surely be picked
off and slammed in the Card bucket.
Handling the center spot for the
second consecutive year, the out
i come of Stanford's 194°> series will
[ depend a lot on how Ed works down
! south this week-end.

This year Ed has attempted to do
even more scoring than he did last
year. He Is an effective shooter but
would rather pass the ball from the
center position than shoot himself.
Now. shooting from far out with a
one-handed push shot, Ed has been
rtble to hit the hoop from the side
lines for many a point.
Looks at S.C.
The week-end's tilts with South
ern California and U.C.L.A. are a
couple of games that Voss has been
looking forward to for a long time.

| Ed slumped the last two games at
( San Francisco in the Civir: but he
I claims he has been "lying in the
weeds for S.C." The weeds will
| have to grow pretty tall to outdo
him with his size 13 shoes.
Ed lias good rebound ability. What
j shots the Trojans manage to throw
near the hoop will surely be picked
off and slammed in the Card bucket.
Handling the center spot for the
second consecutive year, the out
i come of Stanford's 194°> series will
[ depend a lot on how Ed works down
! south this week-end.

men that make up Stanford's 1943
quintet. Today's article concerns
Ed Voss.)

Big Ed Voss (6 feet inches) is
Stanford's pivot man de luxe. Ed is
one of the lop men on the squad. He
was Stanford's leading scorer for
the season last year with a total of
252 points in 29 games and he's go
ing strong so far this season.
Voss is the only other regular vet
eran of last year's national cham
pionship team besides Howie Dal
mar. Offensively and defensively
Big Ed is a top man for Coach Ev
erett Dean to work with. He's a
team player, a strong ball hawk and
an all-round floor man.
Started at Guard
Ed has come a long way since he
played frosh ball for Stanford. Af
ter preping at University High
School in Oakland, Ed took his
:anky frame to the Farm. He started
out as a gangling, \in-co-ordinated
guard but later switched to center
and came along rapidly to take over
a first string berth last year. Ed's
great height is a definite advantage
to the team, especially since he can
handle himself well under the buck
et. He has an effective pivot-re
verse shot which works especially
well.
