"Rumors that there is an epidemic
of measles on campus are false," de
clared Dr. Anderson, director of
Men's Health Service. 'Although
there have been more cases, only
nine students had measles yester
day,"he continued.
These are all German measles, the
less severe type. Students should
not become alarmed at the number
of cases, because they do not exceed
the ordinary amount for this time of
year, according to Dr. Anderson.
"Nine cases of measles are not an
epidemic at Stanford."
