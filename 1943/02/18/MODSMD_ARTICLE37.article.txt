# Fred Linari's Knee Infection Weakens Indian First String
## 
### Bob Sontag 
An infected knee may keep for
ward Fred Linari out of the opening
lineup tomorrow night when Stan
ford and Southern California square
off in the Shrine Auditorium at Los
Angeles. Bill Hooper, who has j
started nt a guard position in the ]
Indians' last two games, came up
with a charleyhorse suffered in j
Tuesday's practice and is also on
the doubtful list.
Everett Dean and a 10-man squad
were to leave for Los Angeles this J
morning for their single southern !
division junket. Saturday Stanford
meets U.C.L.A. at Westwood.
Only the slimmest mathematical

chance holds (he Redskins in t
conference race. To successfully d
fend its Coast and N.C.A.A. char
pionship this year, Stanford mi
win all its remaining games and ha
the Bruins take one of their remai
ing two tilts with U.S.C.
The possible loss of Hooper pi
a crimp into last-break plans whi
were laid down after Stanford w<
a weekend pair of games from San
Clara and the Coast Guard Si
Riders using almost exclusively
fast break.
Tom Fuller will start in place
Linari and Leo McCaffrey in pla
of Hooper.
Coach Dean said the Indians we
not ready to use a fast break earli
in the season, mainly for the reas<
the team as a unit didn't have t
speed. With the addition of Hoopc
perhaps the fastest man on the cli:
Dean found a five capable of mail
' taining speed enough to carry o
| assignments and run the team mu>
like last year's title-winning con
bination.
