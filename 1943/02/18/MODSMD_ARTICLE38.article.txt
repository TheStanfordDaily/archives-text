SAN FRANCISCO, Feb. 17—Jo
seph Paul DiMaggio, the quiet
spoken broad-shouldered son of
humble Italian immigrant parents,
today forsook his position as the
outstanding baseball player of his
kind for a $54 a month job in the
U.S. Army.
Visibly anxious to doff his well
tailored, single-breasted brown suit
for the Army's olive-drab as soon as
possible. DiMaggio received his
screening test, passed his medical
examination with flying colors, and
was sworn in—after waiving his
right to a seven-day automatic fur
lough.
He left for the presidio at Mon
terey with several hundred other
inductees.
