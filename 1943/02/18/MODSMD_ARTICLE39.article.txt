# DOC MASON PITCHES FARM WIN
## Stanford Tops Surf Riders, 6-5, In Their First Victory of 1943 
### Mike Kresge 
With Harry "Doc" Mason leading the way with 11 strikeouts and allow
ing but 10 scattered hits, plus some potent stick work, Stanford's varsity
baseball team yesterday sunk the Coast Guard Surf Riders 6 to 5 on the
Sunken Diamond.
In registering their first win in four starts the Woltermen started but

fast in the first inning and main-"
tained the pace to take the nod. Fine
pitching and stellar defensive work
in the late innings did much to aid
the cause.
The Surf Riders chalked up one
run in their half of the first, but the
Cardinals came right back to score
two runs and take the lead which
they never lost. Duke Hammett and
Jack Bfownson singled and were
sent across the plate by Bob Brown's
booming triple into right center.
Cards Whale Apple
The Guardsmen went scoreless in
their half of the second when Mason
struck out all three batters, but the
Cardinals again climbed aboard
Rudy Biale, Surf Rider flinger, to
out two more runs on three
hits. Ward Walkup singled and
scored the third Stanford run on
Keith Pinion's long triple. Pinion
notched up the fourth tally when Lee
Scott's single sent him homeward.
Taking their half of the third for
breath catching the Indians watched
the Guardsmen again go scoreless.
The fourth inning saw the end of
twirler Biale, who, incidentally, is
the property of the Dodgers—when
Uncle Sam gives him a waiver.
Walkup singled to start the inning
off and promptly stole second. Pin
ion got aboard on a Surf Rider error
and both boys came flying home on
Lee Scott's single which gave him
RBI honors for the day.
Mason Hot Water
The Surf Riders' half of the fifth
inning saw the last runs of the game
across the plate as well as the be
ginning of hot water for Mason.
Dick Holmes, Surf Rider center
fielder, started the inning off with a
single and later scored the first of
four Coast Guard runs which came
in as a result of two Cardinal mis
cues and a slashing double. Mason
weathered the storm by striking out
the final. batter.
The sixth and seventh innings
passed quietly with both teams trad
ing singles, but the first of the eighth
saw two Surf Riders single and ad
vance to second and third with one
man down. Mason sent the next two
batters down on strikes and the
.threat subsided.
' Two Indians got aboard in the last
of the eighth, but any scores failed
to materialize.
The Coast Guardsmen bounced
right back for their last chance in
the top of the ninth by proceeding to
load the sacks. With third-sacker
Howie Cosby, Three Eye League
veteran, menacing on third and with
catcher Pat Englehart, property of
the St. Louis Cardinals, at bat Mason
was in a tough spot.
Englehart Bites
The count on Englehart went to
one and one and then Englehart bit
at a ball for a second strike. An
other ball passed by to make the
count two and two. The few scat
tered fans in the bleachers were
strangely silent. Came the third
pitch, a lusty swing, no connect and
the ball game was over.
Friday afternoon the Woltermen
meet San Jose State's nine on the
Sunken Diamond and Saturday will
see another service team meeting the
Cardinals.
