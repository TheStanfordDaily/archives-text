# MURALS
## Handball Tilts Still on Today 
### 
Ray Hammett, director of intra
murals, has scheduled two handball
games for this afternoon between
1 and 3 in Enema Gym.
These games must be played, or
else the teams will be dropped from
handball play. A match consists of
the best two out of three games of
two singles matches and a doubles
match. If the two singles are won
by one team, no double game is
necessary.
The Phi Psi vs. Zete, and the
A.K.L. vs. Theta Delt games are yet
to be played to complete the first
round matches. These games must
be played by Tuesday, Feb. 23, when
Sigma Chi vs. Delta Chi, and the
winners of the above two games
play.
The basketball games scheduled
for Friday have been cancelled due
to vacation.
