## 
### 
The clock struck 12, midnight,
and up the Row at the Alpha Phi
house several pajama-clad women,
hair on end despite curlers,
prowled around with fire tongs in
their hands looking for the man
who belonged to the footsteps and
funny noises they had heard.
They tried doors and looked un
der chairs. The cellar door was
mysteriously unlocked, but it was
decided that Gordy was the man
to search there.
So Gordy came and he searched,
with the help of several of the
braver Alpha Phis, but even after
the cobwebs had been pulled
down, the man had not yet been
seen.
So Gordy went home, and the
Alpha Phis went to bed.
