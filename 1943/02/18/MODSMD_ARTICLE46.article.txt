# Crew Gets Feet Wet, Shell Torn
## 
### 
Stanfoi'd crewmen got their feet
wet yesterday when, lowering their
newly acquired shell into the water,
they dropped the outrigger into the
bottom of another boat.
A two-foot hole was torn in the
bottom of the shell which will neces
sitate it being out of the water for a
couple of days for repairs.
The crewmen are currently prac
ticing for the scheduled crew race
on May 1 with Cal. The oarsmen are
currently building a secondary float

to be used as a turn-about float.
Parctice has been good so far this
quarter although the crewmen are
handicapped by a lack of equipment.
Coach Carl Pederson is still looking
for a canoe for a coaching launch
as he has to do much of his coach
ing from the shore.
