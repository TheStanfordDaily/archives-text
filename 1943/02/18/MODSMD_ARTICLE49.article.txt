# Excom's Positivity
## 
### 
EXCOM did a positive thing last night. It
assigned Stanford's old and respected Rally
Committee to limbo for the duration.
Now, on the one hand, we must respect the
students' representatives for this action. It was
an action which was obviously necessary be
cause there was no rallying for Rally Com to
do any more, the work that the committee was
doing overlapped the work of the Stanford War
Board, and the whole spirit of the committee,
the rah-rah spirit of the raccoon coat and the
hip-flask, are rather outdated .
In other words, the committee was an anachro
nism.
For the speedy and clear realization of this
fact Excom should be congratulated. It indicates
that Stanford shall see more dead branches
lopped off within the next few weeks or months.
There was, however, a tendency which we
noted in Excom last night that we must deplore.
This is the idea of "let the War Board do it."
And when we say "it" we mean war work.
It seems that one of the reasons for the aban
donment of Rally Com was that many of the
people who had signed up for Rally Com did
not particularly care to do the war work which
Rally Com has been doing in the last two or
three months. It seems that they were all hot
to draw posters for Big Game but when it came
to drawing posters for collecting dimes for the
boys on Guadalcanal they were not very in
terested. Now this is not a mass indictment, but
it is an impression concerning some Rally
Com members which we carried away from
Excom. And it wasn't a good impression.
Then there was another factor. It seems that
the Stanford War Board would sort of like to
spread some of its work around to some of the
established organizations existing on campus.
That is why Miss Rosemary Cross, War Board
head, opposed the abolition of Rally Committee.
We hope that this "let War Board do it" spirit
is not a growing tendency. â€”Bill Steif
