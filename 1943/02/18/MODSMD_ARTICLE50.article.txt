The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Daily, particularly under your
hand this quarter, is without question one of the
most vapid, smug, worthless pieces of literature
to be found on any university campus in Amer
ica.
Since coming to Stanford four months ago, I
have read the sheet almost daily, constantly
curious as to precisely what new low of editorial
chaff and columnar trivia would be reached. I
kept thinking it would get better; it had no other
course. But I underrated your depth. This quar
ter The Daily has sunk almost completely out
of sight or hearing of significant issues in that
strange, distant world outside the Sleepy Farm.
Consider, for example, the incredibly wide
gulf between the warnings of a man like Mum
ford (right here on the Farm!) that civilization
is undergoing its most serious ordeal since the
fifth century —and the fact that the easy-going
Daily has scarcely touched a serious general
economic, political, or international question in

the past five weeks. I do not mean you should
agree with Mumford's or anyone else's position:
only that you might condescend occasionally to
acknowledge an issue.
On top of this you had the brash, Mr. Editor,
about two weeks ago, to state that the Daily
Shack was "undoubtedly the social and intel
lectual center of the campus." Wait till that
crack reaches Robert Guest, '4l, in North Africa
—you remember, the soldier who wrote to you
last week saying he hated to "see the student
body treated like a bunch of children."
Just glance over that editorial page for the
weeks past. Look at the typical diet you feed
the students of Stanford: The perennial Row-
Hall question. The Quad's need for more staff.
The Quad's need for subscriptions. An occa
sional soliloquy on how lucky we all are to be
here, or how upsetting this war is to these pre
cious college years. Or some little item which
brings the war home to us ever closer and
closer. Or the fact that Dr. Tresidder is a
Stanford man. Plus the unfailing self-conscious
adolescence of the boy hasher.
Admittedly my plea comes a little late. But
why not run, in the midst of this long stream
of drivel, at least one column which would in
dicate a university level of awareness? I don't
care what point of view it carries, so long as it
carries one.
As it stands, The Daily is one of two things:
a true reflection of the intellectual caliber and
power of the Stanford student body, or a gross
insult to that student body and to the University
in either case—well, figure it out for yourself.

The Editor, Sir:
Inasmuch as Soviet Russia is our fighting
ally, we disapprove of Mr. Steif's exhuming the
"Red Menace" at this time. We think that a
more positive solution for a lasting peace would
be to acquaint Russia with our problems and
to endeavor to obtain a better understanding
of hers through closer diplomatic relations. Our
war effort would not then be enervated by a
fear of post-war Soviet domination, but rather
by a spirit of comradeship between the two
nations. We should like to point out that this
same policy could be adopted in our relations
with Great Britain and China to good effect.
The foundation for such an understanding
should be laid now, and not at the peace table.
