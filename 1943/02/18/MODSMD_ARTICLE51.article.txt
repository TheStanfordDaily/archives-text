# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
Since General DeWitt closed down on hunt
ing season Miss Ricker has not been able to go
up to the north woods on her yearly trip, and
as a result the bear claw situation in the Cellar
is becoming pretty acute.
If you come in at 10:15 for the morning social
hour and there are no bear claws left don't raise
a big stink, because what few specimens they
can get are the hot-house variety, and every
body knows that hot-house bears are as scarce
as dark brown orchids these days._
And if you see one of the Cellar hashers
outside turning over rocks and pushing back
bushes, he's just hunting around for a few more
snails, because they are running short too. As
for the butter-horns—they are nearly extinct.

Every Wednesday a magazine-type Daily
comes out with a page of pictures on the front.
On yesterday's magazine-type Daily the pic
torial spread was concerning the Hoover War
Library. Along with a picture of the tower and
a few sketches of scenes in it was supposed to
be a pencil-sketch of Herbert Clark Hoover
himself. Through a slight mistake on the part
of someone connected with the publication, a
pencil sketch of General Chiang Kai-shek ap
peared instead. We'd like to apologize to the
Chinese Consulate in Palo Alto, to the Hoover
Vacuum Cleaner Co., and most of all to General
Motors.
