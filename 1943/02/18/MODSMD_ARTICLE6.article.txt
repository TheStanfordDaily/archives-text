# EXCOM
## Rally Com Out For Duration 
### 
Excom last night unanimously I
voted Rally Committee out of ex- |
istence for the duration.
Following the lengthy recommen
dation of Cardinals, the student
body's representatives took only a
few minutes to abolish one of Stan
ford's hoariest and best - known
committees.
Rally Coin Too Large
The recommendation to abolish
Rally Committee until the end of
the war came from committee heads
Martha Thurmond and Jim Mcßrier
Mcßrier, in representing the com
mittee's case, stated that "Rally
Committee as it is now constituted
is too big for the little work it now
has to do." He added that the com
mittee's activities are overlapped by
those of the War Board, that many
of Rally Coin's functions have been
taken over by other campus organi
zations, that many valuable people
are being left idle because of the
committees inactivity and that un
equal abilities in such special skills
as poster-making make the compe
tition for advancement on Rally
Committee unfair.
The only opposition to the aboli
tion of Rally Com came from War
Board Chairman Rosemary Cross,
who was of the opinion that Rally
Com, us an already established or
ganization, might turn its undoubted
talents to War Board work. She
stated, "if you want to fight the war,
let War Board fight it."
It was then pointed out that many
of the people on Rally Committee
had signed up to work for the foot
ball team and not for the war and
that it was unfair to force these
people into something 'which they
had not anticipated doing.
Bob Hammett then moved that
the Cardinals' minutes, of which the
Rally Com abolition was the main
part, be approved and they were.
It was also decided that the re
election for Women's Council posi
tions, necessitated by a mix-up on
ihe ballot a week ago yesterday,
would be held next Wednesday.
Discussion was also held on the
J off re debate and the Spanish so
ciety's contemplated dance show.
Leslie Langnecker was appointed to
look into the possibilities of hold
ing a reception for Dr. and Mrs.
Tresidder and Dr. and Mrs. Wilbur
during Spring Quarter.
Dates granted were as follows:
Alpha Phi, April 10; Lagunita, April
24; Los Arcos, March 5; Phi Gamma
Delta, March 6; Sigma Delia Pi, Feb.
26; W.A.A., March 5; S.A.E., Feb. 19;

mittee's activities are overlapped by
those of the War Board, that many
of Rally Coin's functions have been
taken over by other campus organi
zations, that many valuable people
are being left idle because of the
committees inactivity and that un
equal abilities in such special skills
as poster-making make the compe
tition for advancement on Rally
Committee unfair.

tion of Rally Com came from War
Board Chairman Rosemary Cross,
who was of the opinion that Rally
Com, us an already established or
ganization, might turn its undoubted
talents to War Board work. She
stated, "if you want to fight the war,
let War Board fight it."

of the people on Rally Committee
had signed up to work for the foot
ball team and not for the war and
that it was unfair to force these
people into something 'which they
had not anticipated doing.

the Cardinals' minutes, of which the

part, be approved and they were.

tions, necessitated by a mix-up on
ihe ballot a week ago yesterday,

mittee's case, stated that "Rally

is too big for the little work it now
has to do." He added that the com
