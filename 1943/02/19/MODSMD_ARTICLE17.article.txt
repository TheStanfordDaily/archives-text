Somewhere on the broad expanse of the Pacific, the American submarine
Wahoo, on patrol duty in enemy-controlled waters, has time to lend aid
to crew members of a small, becalmed fishing boat. Food and water go
over the side of the sub to six survivors of the original party of nine
aboard the small craft. Official U. S. Navy photo.
