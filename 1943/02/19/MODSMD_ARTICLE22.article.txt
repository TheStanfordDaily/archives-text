## 
### 
On Monday a couple in Los Angeles, graduates of Stanford in 1902, will
celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and at the same time the anni
versary of a sacred Stanford tradition which they began 40 years ago.
As the first Stanford couple to be married in the Memorial Church, Mr.
and Mrs. William A. Holt of Los Angeles started the tradition in 1903 which

has led 1,779 couples to the altar of
the Memorial Church. Since that
first wedding, Stanford students have
returned to the campus from all
parts of the country to be married in
the church.
The eventful marriage was de
scribed a few days later in the Palo
Alto Times as follow® -
Marriage Ceremony
"The first marriage ceremony ever
solemnized in Memqrial Church oc
curred last Sunday, Feb. 22, when
William Holt of Sacramento and
Ethel Rhodes of San Francisco were
made man and wife in the grand new
church while the vibrant tones of
the great organ filled the sacred edi
fice with the sweet old-new music
of the Lohengrin. Rev. Dr. Newton
officiated.
"The bridal couple were attended
by Mr. A. D. Wells and Miss Grace
Holt.
"After a wedding breakfast the
newly-married pair left on the three
o'clock train for Sacramento.
"Both the contracting parties are
graduates of the class of '02."
Earthquake

Earthquake
During the great earthquake of
1906, the Stanford Memorial Church
suffered greatly, and in the destruc
tion the marriage register was badly
damaged, necessitating the recopy
ing of the names of couples married
in the Church up to that time. No
weddings took place in Memorial
Church for eight years after the
earthquake.
Mr. and Mrs. Holt have been ac
tive in Stanford affairs since their
graduation. He is a member of the
Stanford Associates, and together
they have provided scholarships and
aid to many deserving students.

Because of the Washington's Birth
day holiday weekend, there will be
no services at the Stanford Memorial
Church this Sunday, Feb. 21.
On Monday a couple in Los Angeles, graduates of Stanford in 1902, will
celebrate their 40th wedding anniversary and at the same time the anni
versary of a sacred Stanford tradition which they began 40 years ago.
As the first Stanford couple to be married in the Memorial Church, Mr.
and Mrs. William A. Holt of Los Angeles started the tradition in 1903 which

has led 1,779 couples to the altar of
the Memorial Church. Since that
first wedding, Stanford students have
returned to the campus from all
parts of the country to be married in
the church.
The eventful marriage was de
scribed a few days later in the Palo
