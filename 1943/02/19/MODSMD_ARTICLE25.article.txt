# SALVAGE
## Collection Set For Tomorrow 
### 
All tin cans, light metal, silk
stockings, rags, clothes, and maga
zines will be collected this Saturday,
Feb. 20. The collection will be made
between 1 and 2 p.m., and the articles
must be ready by that time.
A letter was sent to every resi
dence at the beginning of the year
to explain the collection procedure,
said Joan Pemberthy, co-chairman
of the campus drive. Two boxes are
to be put in front of each residence,
one for the metal—the tin cans must
be squashed—and the other for the
non-metal salvage.
In case of rain. Miss Pemberthy
said, the box containing the stock
ings, clothing, and magazines should
be covered up with heavy news
papers and the box not put out until
noon.
All heavy metal and tires will be
collected by arrangement. Anyone
who wants such salvage collected
should call the Stanford War Board
office, PA. 9411 or local 413. A sep
arate agency collects these articles,
and will come whenever there is
salvage to be collected.
Announcements were made in the
residences earlier this week, and
each student should make sure that
his salvage is ready in time for the
collection, especially since the drive
comes only once a month, Miss Pem
berthy said.
The next drive will be the third
Saturday in March.
