Dinner plus the chance to win an
$18.75 War Bond is offered to mem
bers of the Class of '44 at an in
formal dinner party one week from
today, Feb. 26, in the basement of
the Women's Clubhouse.
"You can't lose, it's a give-away,"
said Ferris Boothe junior class presi
dent, in announcing the dinner. Ad
mission to the dinner is 55 cents per
person which will be used to buy
four or five war bonds to be given
away at the dinner.
Members of the junior class coun
cil met yesterday in the Women's
Clubhouse to review final plans for
the affair. Each living group repre
sentative in the council will conduct
a sign-up of juniors in each living
group early next week to find the
number planning to attend.
. "Although our usual social quar
ter is in spring, we feel that the class
ought to get together for an informal
party before so many enter the serv
ice next quarter," said Helen Camp
bell, chairman of the dinner.
"We have plenty of money in the
class treasury. Every junior is wel
come to come, it's a no-date party,"
Miss Campbell added. "And you
may win a war bond."
Committee chairmen for the din
ner include Janet McClanahan, food;
John Twitchell, tickets; Claire Car
ter, posters; Ham Howard, arrange
ments; Bill Coughlin, publicity; Bob
