Washington, however, is in the

question of manpower as much as it

A'ar circumstances.
More than 200 colleges and univer
sities recently submitted their ques
: ions concerning students in war to
:he American Council on Education.
These questions were turned over to
xperts of the War Manpower Com
nission, National Resources Plan

ning Board and (he Army Institute
on request of the Office of War In
formation.
The questions were studied and
answered and have been circulated
throughout the country for publica
tion. Here they are:
Q. What is the most useful thing
we can do in these several months
before we are drafted?
A. The President and other gov
ernment officials in the War and
Navy departments have consistently
urged that students who are com
petent should remain at their stud
ies until in the regular course of
Selective Service they are called to
some other duty.
Q. Now that we aren't allowed to
enlist, how are they going to decide
who goes to the different forces?
How will they decide whether to
send us back to college for more
study? 11«»\\ will they decide where
we belong in some branch of the
service?
A. Men who enter the armed serv
ice through Selective Service will
have opportunity to indicate their
preferences. Naturally no assurance
can be given in any individual case
that this expressed preference will
be followed, because each branch of
the service not only needs a certain
number of inductees but it needs
inductees of certain types of ability
and training.
Q. Has the Government any over
all plan as to the number to be sol
diers, workers, tanners, and doctors?
A. There is gradually taking form
under direction of the War Man

power Commission a policy whose
principal objective is to assure each
man the best chance possible to
render his service where it will count
for the most in the war. This will
involve men being assigned to farms,
to professions, and the like, as well
ias to the armed forces.
Q. Is there any way by which I
can continue my interrupted studies
while I am in the Army?
A. Yes. Any enlisted man in the
armed forces, after he has been in
active service for at least four
months, can enroll with either the
Army Institute or with any one of
the 7(5 universities or colleges co
operating with the War Department
in offering correspondence courses.
In addition, several hundred thou
sand inductees are to be sent back
' to college for special work.
Q. What effect will the law draft
ing IS and 19-year-olds have on the
Army and Navy enlisted reserves?
A. The enlisted reserves in the
colleges are to be supplanted by
specialized training prog 1* am s.
Transitions to those programs will
vary with the different categories of
I students who are members of the
enlisted reserves.

inductees of certain types of ability
and training.

power Commission a policy whose

to professions, and the like, as well
ias to the armed forces.
Q. Is there any way by which I

Q. What effect will the law draft
ing IS and 19-year-olds have on the
Army and Navy enlisted reserves?
A. The enlisted reserves in the
colleges are to be supplanted by
specialized training prog 1* am s.
Transitions to those programs will

I students who are members of the
enlisted reserves.
On Feb. 1, plans to deal with the
various enlisted reserves stood as

Medical students in the Army en
listed reserve—remain in school un
til the end of the first full semester
that begins in 1943. then called to
active duty, and detailed to continue
| medical study under the supervision
I of War Department.

Pre-medical students and sopho
more. junior, senior students taking
approved technical engineering
courses- remain in an inactive status
isitil end of first full semester that
begins in 1943, then called to active
duty.
Second-year advanced senior di

graduation occurs before June 30,
1943.
First-year advanced senior division
R.O.T.C. students in the enlisted re

at beginning of Army Specialized

until end of first full semester or
substantially corresponding academic
period that begins in 1943.
All other Army enlisted reserve
corps students—called to active duty
at end of current semester or corre
sponding academic period. No orders
will be given to report on a date
prior to two weeks after the stu

31. 1942.
Navy V-l, V-5, and V-7 reservists
—will be called to active duty as ap
prentice seamen with full pay. sub
sistence. and uniforms. The length
of time they will remain in college
will depend on the qualifications and
the special program they are fol
lowing.
Students today seem to be caught
n a web of purposes and cross-pur
poses, all coming under the label of
war effort." They have been con
used by pleas for volunteers that
onflict with General Hershey's re
uest that all men stay at school
mtil called.
They have been confused by the
nconsistency of reserve deferment
Policy and the War Department's
ntcrpretation of "exigencies of war,"
. clause in reservists' contracts that
nakes their deferment term condi
ional.
No knowing whether they'd be in
uniform tomorrow or in another
rear, men students have regarded
heir future as a dilemma. They have
bjected to the manpower policy,
lot because they wanted longer dc
erments, but because of its appar
?nt indecision.
Washington, however, is in the
process of clearing up the whole
question of manpower as much as it
s possible in face of unpredictable
A'ar circumstances.
More than 200 colleges and univer
sities recently submitted their ques

:he American Council on Education.
These questions were turned over to
xperts of the War Manpower Com
nission, National Resources Plan

ning Board and (he Army Institute
on request of the Office of War In
formation.
The questions were studied and
answered and have been circulated
throughout the country for publica
tion. Here they are:
Q. What is the most useful thing
we can do in these several months
before we are drafted?
A. The President and other gov
ernment officials in the War and
Navy departments have consistently
urged that students who are com
petent should remain at their stud

Selective Service they are called to
some other duty.
Q. Now that we aren't allowed to
enlist, how are they going to decide
who goes to the different forces?
How will they decide whether to
send us back to college for more
study? 11«»\\ will they decide where
we belong in some branch of the
service?
A. Men who enter the armed serv

have opportunity to indicate their
