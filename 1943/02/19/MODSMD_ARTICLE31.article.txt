# FROSH CAGE
## Hoopsters Play Galileo Quintet 
### Ed Luce 
Stanford's frosh basketball team
ran up against the OPA yesterday,
and as a consequence won't get into
action this week-end until tomorrow
night at 7 against Galileo High
School.
Woody Weir stated yesterday that
the sensational Modesto J.C. quintet
scheduled to play here tonight had
been unable to secure gasoline for
the trip, and thus canceled the con
test. Efforts to line up a tiff with
Marin J.C. fell through, according
to Weir.
Fast Breakers
The Galileo game, however, should
provide enough fireworks to make
the evening interesting. Galileo re
cently battled St. Ignatius for the
S.F. title, lost out, but is still one of
the three best tennis in the city. The
Galileans are tall, and employ a fast
break and zone defense, something
the Papeese haven't run into all sea
son.
The loss of first string forward A1
Fish Tuesday added more wood to
Weir's smoldering forward troubles.
First front line man to wreck him
self was lanky Dave Davidson. Now
Fish has torn a cartilage in his knee
and will probably be out for the
season.
Starting Line-up
Fish is the fourth first stringer
Weir has lost in the last two weeks,
and therefore is calling upon former
third stringers for front line re
serve duty. Tomorrow's starting
lineup will probably consist of high
scoring Hugh West and newcomer
Pete Allen at forwards, Bob Rowe
at center, and Bud Provost and Babe
Higgins at guards.
Weir expects Paul Nieto and Jack
Coppage to handle most of the re
serve duties, since both Jack Davis
and Marsh McDaniel have gone
south for the week-end.
Short Work-out
The Papoose squad went through
3 short, lively work-out yesterday
afternoon, and then worked for over
an hour on free throw and field goal
shooting. Higgins sparked the shoot
ing drill by sinking five consecutive
field goals from beyond the key.
Weir explained his shifting of
Higgins to guard by saying that the
former Richmond boy could direct
'.he team better from there, and
seemed to be his best man for get
ting tin offense into motion. Allen
and Provost have won their starting
posts through continued improve
ment in workouts.

S.F. title, lost out, but is still one of
the three best tennis in the city. The
Galileans are tall, and employ a fast
break and zone defense, something
the Papeese haven't run into all sea
son.
The loss of first string forward A1
Fish Tuesday added more wood to
Weir's smoldering forward troubles.
First front line man to wreck him
self was lanky Dave Davidson. Now
Fish has torn a cartilage in his knee
and will probably be out for the
season.
Starting Line-up
Fish is the fourth first stringer
Weir has lost in the last two weeks,
and therefore is calling upon former
third stringers for front line re
serve duty. Tomorrow's starting
lineup will probably consist of high
scoring Hugh West and newcomer
Pete Allen at forwards, Bob Rowe
at center, and Bud Provost and Babe
Higgins at guards.
Weir expects Paul Nieto and Jack
Coppage to handle most of the re
serve duties, since both Jack Davis
and Marsh McDaniel have gone
south for the week-end.
Short Work-out
The Papoose squad went through
3 short, lively work-out yesterday
afternoon, and then worked for over
an hour on free throw and field goal
shooting. Higgins sparked the shoot
ing drill by sinking five consecutive
field goals from beyond the key.
Weir explained his shifting of
Higgins to guard by saying that the
former Richmond boy could direct
'.he team better from there, and
seemed to be his best man for get
ting tin offense into motion. Allen
and Provost have won their starting
posts through continued improve
ment in workouts.
Stanford's frosh basketball team
ran up against the OPA yesterday,
and as a consequence won't get into
action this week-end until tomorrow
night at 7 against Galileo High
School.
Woody Weir stated yesterday that
the sensational Modesto J.C. quintet
scheduled to play here tonight had
been unable to secure gasoline for
the trip, and thus canceled the con
test. Efforts to line up a tiff with
Marin J.C. fell through, according
to Weir.
Fast Breakers
The Galileo game, however, should
provide enough fireworks to make
the evening interesting. Galileo re
cently battled St. Ignatius for the
S.F. title, lost out, but is still one of
the three best tennis in the city. The
Galileans are tall, and employ a fast
break and zone defense, something
the Papeese haven't run into all sea
