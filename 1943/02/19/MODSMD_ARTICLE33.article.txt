# Trackmen Short In Weight Events
## 
### 
A lack of weight men will handi
cap the Stanford track team this
season, according to a statement
made by Coach Pitch Johnson this
week.
The effect of the war in sports may
be seen in the fact that there are no
seniors on the squad and that Bill
Quackenbush is the only veteran
runner. In the other divisions men
who have returned from last year
are A1 Pande, javelin thrower, Dick
Compton and John Fulton, middle
distance runners.
The coach anticipates a fairly
good showing in hurdles, middle dis
tance runs and high pump but says
there will be no shoeing in shot
put, discus throw, broad-jump, or
pole vault.
