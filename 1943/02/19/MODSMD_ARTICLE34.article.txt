# Toyon Will Give Dance Saturday
## 
### 
Toyon Club will hold an informal
dance this Saturday night in Toyon
lobby from 9 to 1, according to Dance
Chairman Hone Zentner. Music will
be from records.
The informal dance is being held
instead of the more expensive An
nual Winter Formal which is being
junked for the duration. The money
which would have been spent on a
formal will be given to one of the
campus war drives.
