# Indians Shoot for P.C.C. Tie Tonight
## Hoopmen to Meet Trojans in L.A. 
### Bill Hornby 
Stanford's Indians meet the U.S.C.
Trojans tonight in Los Angeles for
their last chance, "a mathematical
possibility,'' of gaining a tie in the
southern division P.C.C. basketball
play.
Only the fervent hopes of Palo
Alto followers back up that slight
chance which would remain to Ev
erett Dean's team if it could beat
U.S.C., win the rest of its games
(two with Cal and two with U.C.-
L.A.), and work some Li'l Injun
magic to pep up U.C.L.A. enough to
beat U.S.C. once.
If all this could happen, Stanford
would tie for first.
LAST OPPORTUNITY
One reason why tonight could
well be the last opportunity for in
dulging in such air-castle building
is the status of Stanford starter Fred
Linari.
The first-string forward, who re
cently popped back into the scoring
column with the beautiful shooting
that Stanford has missed so much all
season, was still bothered by a knee
infection when the squad left for
the south yesterday morning. Al
though it "felt better," the infection
makes Linari a problematical starter,
and he won't be available for full
time use.
One of the guard corps that teams
with Howie Dallmar. Bill Hooper,
is still slowed down to a light trot
by the charley horse obtained in
Tuesday's practice.
This leaves three undoubted first
stringers, Dana. Voss, Dallmar. plus
Leo McCaffrey at guard and prob
ably Tom Fuller at the Linari-less
forward hole.
IS Wins
If only for the record, one should
finish out the gioomy side of the
picture by noting that U.S.C. won
18 straight, soundly bounced all
conference foes, previously trimmed
Stanford 41-33, rates number one in
the U.S. in Dunkel's National Rat
ings, has two forwards with 12-
point-per-game averages, and so on.
They — Omalev and Rock, for
wards; Seminoff, center; and Gos
sard and McGill, guards—are favor
ites.
On our side it doesn't take too
much to find the "something new"
that's been added. The Indians have
taken their championship fast break
out of the bag, used it very effi
ciently against Santa Clara last Fri
day night.
Fast Play
Everett Dean supposedly shelved
the old razzle-dazzle that led the
gang to the N.C.A.A. crown last year
because he felt that the material
wasn't good enough to risk the fancy
handling and the speed.
It's back in play again, not be
cause the gang is as good as last
year or that their current record
showed great promise, but mainly
because the alternative method was
losing games.
But once they got the fast break
plays, the team perked up for the
first time this year. The S.C. game
is the one game that the Cards want;
Ed Voss remarked after a Civic Au
ditorium defeat that "we're laying
in the grass for the Trojans."
Remains to be seen whether they
poke their heads from without said
grass before it is neatly mowed by
the "supermen" of S.C.

Seven tons of copper are fired in
a single minute of combat by a squad
of 50 fighter planes.
