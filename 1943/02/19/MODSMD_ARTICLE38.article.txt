A group of public spirited gentle
en from Palo Alto have started a
unpaign that is gaining momentum
ich day. Realizing that many of the
rmy posts and camps are without
lequate athletic equipment, or no
luipment at all, this group, under
ie guidance of Phil MolTett, has
arted to collect any type of sport
g equipment—fishing rods, golf
übs, baseballs, mitts, volleyballs,
jlleyball nets.
Certainly there must be some ath
tic equipment just lying idle
•ound the fraternity houses and
iting clubs. If so, call Kay At
ater, P.A. 6138, and he will send
-it someone to collect the equip
ient. Collection depots are at 14G
orest avenue and 171 University
/enue.
This equipment is sorely needed
y the boys in the service. At a post
earby, the boys were playing foot
all with rolled up rags.
All of the Stanford coaches have
eartily endorsed the program.

One of the best gags of the week
jmes from Carl Pedersen, crew
>ach. When asked his official sta
is, Pedersen replied, "1 don't know
•hether I'm a mentor or a tormen
>r."
The boys out for crew are probab
' the most conscientious athletic
roup on campus. Pedersen had
rospects begging him for the op
ortunity to try out for a shell. The
ten not only practice on Saturdays,
ut want to work out on Sundays
3 well; they formerly provided
ieir own means of transportation to
nd from the Palo Alto Yacht Har
or.

Perhaps the best individual dis
lay of sportsmanship a person will
2e for a long time took place last
'hursday night in the Stanford-San
ose State boxing matches. Tom
riiffin, clever Spartan senior wel
iiweight, had John Levy pretty
'ell on the go, and in the second
ound he found Levy with his head
own in a crouched position, his
ands at his side after receiving a
arrag'e of leather. Instead of tak
ng advantage of this opening, Grif
n stepped back, let Levy regain
imself, and then came in fighting
gain.
Griffin put Levy away in that
ound, but his gentlemanly act drew
ie applause of the entire audience,
nd afterwards, Stanford Boxing
loach Harry Maloney singled him
ut to congratulate him on his fine
portsmanship.
Also, Max Baer gained many new
• iends that night. His reputation
s a clown rubbed a lot of people the
/long way, and they didn't particu
irly care for the Livermore Butch
rboy. But the way he handled Vic
iindskog in their exhibition bout
emoved all shadows of doubt in
ny doubting minds. Many people
hought that because Lindskog
3reed the fighting all the way, not
iving Baer much of a chance to
lown, that the unscheduled fourth
ound would see the former champ
eally slugging. But it didn't turn
ut that way, and everyone was en
ertained.

Now that high school students may I
ttend Stanford University, and be
nrolled here, the question arose as \
j their eligibility on a university j
3am. Unfortunately for the boys, I
he ruling is that they'll have to wait
intil they o.k. the freshmen in order
o compete.
