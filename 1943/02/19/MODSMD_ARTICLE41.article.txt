### 
SAN FRANCISCO. Feb. 18â€”Don Budge, the great tennis player, joined
the Army; Dolph Camilli, Brooklyn Dodger first baseman, quit baseball,
and Joe DiMaggio, New York Yankee slugger, answered his first reville
in the Army today.
Thus three of the Pacific Coast's greatest gifts to the sports world, retired
from the scene, at least for the dura- +

tion.
Camilli said he decided definitely
to quit baseball and was considering i
the possibility of entering the U.S.
Ferry Service as a pilot, or he will
stay on his cattle ranch at Layton- !
ville, Cal. and continue to raise live
stock.
Budge, top American professional j
tennis player since he abandoned his j
amateur status in 1938 after having
won the national singles titles in
1936, 1937, and 1938, and the Wim
bledon crown in 1937 and 1938, was
inducted into the Army here as a ;
volunteer.
"I prefer the Army and am ready J
to go wherever they want me to. I'm j
in pretty good shape," Budge said.
DiMaggio received his uniform,
inoculations, and first instructions on
how to be a soldier at the Presidio in
Monterey following his "voluntary
induction" yesterday as a private.
