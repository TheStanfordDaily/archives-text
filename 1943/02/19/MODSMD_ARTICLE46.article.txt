# The 						Why of The Daily
## 
### 
WHEN the typical European scholar visits an American
university he is surpiised that the college newspaper
Is not filled with weighty discussions and treatises on "seri
ous general economic, political, or international questions,"
but rather with stories and announcements about college
life. He would be surprised at The Stanford Daily for he
misunderstands the function of the typical American college
newspaper, and The Daily is pioud of being a typical Amer
ican college newspaper.
The Stanford Daily exists to make life easier at Stanford
both for the students and the faculty. Its purpose is to
~arry news about the University—information about sorority
sponsor meetings and where the Quad proofs may be picked
ap and what is happening and what has happened at Stan
ford.
Its second duty is to carry as much United Press world
news as it can, and thirdly comes the duty to comment edi
torially on the news.
The editorials are concerned primarily with the campus
because: one, we feel it is our duty to call attention to, to
point up, and to passingly comment on campus news, and
'wo, because we feel that we are not competent to interpret
world affairs for our fellow students who are as well quali
fied as we to guess at Spain's feeling toward Britain or the
economic elfect of drafting labor.
Already there are enough armchair generals trying to
win the war with words, without The Daily's having a col
umn written by some student who is carrying 15 or 20 units
with R.O.T.C. and boxing and must dash off an ill-conceived
opinion between gym and hashing.
In the future as in the past what goes into the editorial
columns will not necessarily be about the campus. It will
be what we think is of the most interest and will be of the
most worth to our readers.
Again as in the first issue of Volume 103 we say: "We
hope that our Tabby will be well written, that it will be
accurate and concise, and that it will be interesting and
■wide awake; but, above all, we hope that it will always
exercise good taste and be honest and sincere."
