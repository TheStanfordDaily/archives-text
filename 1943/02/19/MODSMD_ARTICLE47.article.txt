# Campus Opinion
## PERTINENT FACTS 
### 
The Editor. Sir,
Listen, H, old boy, I hope you have cooled down enough
to listen to another opinion about The Stanford Daily. I too
have been at Stanford for four months, and have felt that
The Daily has been somewhat negligent in its coverage of
"serious general economic, political, and international ques
tions" to which you have so caustically referred. But, H,
old boy, you have failed to take into consideration some
very pertinent facts.
It is true that The Daily i 3 narrow in its scope. It con
fines itself, more or less, to the issues and events which
are taking place on the "Sleepy Farm." And I think it does
a reasonably good job of it. It is not, however, the Time
or the Newsweek of the Pacific Coast, nor the San Fran
cisco Examiner. It is simply a campus newspaper, made up
of students who devote a lot of time and effort in its pub
lication.

Now, I went to a university, California, to be exact,
where the editors think they are running a Time or a News
week, and, believe me, they talked about everything under
the sun, from capital punishment, labor conditions, national
politics, etc., to the future of the human race. At a moment's
notice some fiery-penned editor would decide whether Gen
eral Mac Arthur would run for President in 1944, when he
would attack next, and where and how; or whether the
U.S. would enter a World Court or not, and why the U.S.
would, and when.
Well, it was all very interesting (and sincerely written, I
believe). But, the things which affected the University of
California were sadly neglected. The things which the
university could do to help and promote interest in local
campus drives and politics were never before the campus.
There was even a rule in most sororities and fraternities
that the pledges were obligated to read the Daily and
search for the news which touched on campus doings. These
things would be found in some obscure corner of the last
page. Nobody read the paper. And obviously because the
editorials and columns were filled with adolescent slop
about "serious general" questions.
Now, Mr. H, I may be wrong about your viewpoint. I
have no doubt that there are some individuals on the cam
pus who are seriously and sincerely interested in discussing
"serious general" questions. And this is certainly not an
attempt to impede any progress which they might be able
to make if The Daily adopted a more "serious" or "gen
eral" policy. But I rather doubt the ability of a man 21
years of age or less to discuss intelligently these problems
facing America and the world every day in his editorials.
You know, Mr. H, most of us have just opened our eyes
to these subjects. We've taken a few introductory courses
in political science, history, or philosophy, maybe even
read a little Carl Marx, but for the most part (and I speak for
myself) we don't even know how to spell sociology. This
is no crime. After all, we are just learning; that's why we
are going to school, my God! And it will be a long time
before we will be able to really discuss "serious" and
"general" questions with any degree of understanding.
But there is something we can do. We can get things in
order within the walls of our "sleepy" little farm. We can
take an interest in local problems and try to settle them
with greater chances of success than if we attack some
revolutionary world problem about which we really know
little. Let s not stick our finger into problems of earth-shak
ing consequence before we clean up a few problems here
on our own little plot. Hell, maybe they aren't important
as far as the rest of the world thinks. Not immediately im
portant. But believe me, Mr. H, they will have a profound
effect on the world someday. I don't think this is an exag
geration. You can read for yourself the distinguished list
of Stanford graduates who probably were hot under the
collar about the Row-Hall question, or the Quad's need for
subset iptions. Why don't you go ask Dr. Tresidder or Her
bert Hoover just what they were doing when they were
undergraduates. Maybe they were concerned with the
Quad's need for more staff, or the Row-Hall question. Maybe
they did something about it. Or, more likely, they were
just learning how to get along with the rest of their fellow
students and having a lot of fun. But the point is that Stan
ford can do something for you; ask Dr. Tresidder or Mr.
Hoover, or most any graduate. And you can do something
for Stanford.
Yes, Mr. H, great things begin in very small ways, and
those who can take an interest in the local problems will
be better fitted to take over larger responsibilities. I think
The Daily helps us to realize what is going on in our own
small community, the Editor seems to be able to discuss
these things with clearness and understanding, and there is
some response evident on the Farm. I don't see anything
vapid or smug about it, rather I think it sparkles with Amer
ican collegiate humanness. Certainly, it's not perfect; and
certainly, it could be improved. But the thing to do is to get
in there and do something to make it better. Stinging and
caustic letters anonymously signed (except for a very lonely
little "H") do little. In fact one might call this the essence
of adolescence.
A suggestion which might open up The Daily to the
important questions facing America and the world better
than your sarcastic clamor for better editorials follows:
Why not have a column written by some professor who is
in a position to express an opinion on the subject? Let
him give direction to the discussion. Let him answer let
ters written to him asking his opinion on certain questions.
Or let him write an opinion on current events. I'm sure it
would be better than the attempts of any editor to discuss
the problems. Or better still, why don't you read Life, Time,
Newsweek, The Nation, and Fortune every morning and go
down to the Cellar and have a big bull session about it.
There you can talk "seriously" and "generally" about most
anything. And you will find that some Stanford students
axe keenly interested in the "strange, distant world outside
the Sleepy Farm," But don't talk to me, for I'll be reading
the drizzle of the "unfailing, self-conscious, . . . adolescent
boy-hasher.' It's the best thing in the paper anyway.

The Editor. Sir:
His right. The Daily is declining in intelligence along !
with the rest of the campus. The Daily should not string 1
along with the average student of today whose thoughts are
concentrated on how to get around rationing, how to con
tinue his deferment, or how to have the best possible time
before going in March. It should try to lead the campus in i
serious thinking over social and political problems prob- ;
lems of increasing importance, which have been played j
down since our campus was converted into a war plant.
The Daily can do this: run History 1943 at least once or !
twice a week, as before. This column need not comment on j
of battleships or effective firing power of tanks on :
the Tunisian front, but it can keep our eyes awake to vari- j
ous political problems which will bother us from now until
long after the war the recognizing of Vichy North Africa,
the Indian problem, China, etc. Don't cut out any important
n>ws to run this feature. Just remove a little of the grut
filied feature. No intelligent Stanford student is interested
in the hardships of the local clothing stores. No one who
reads the New Yorker wants to see the adolescent wit "bf
the Hasher. Let's take a stand, Daily, for more intelligent i
reading matter.

that the pledges were obligated to read the Daily and
search for the news which touched on campus doings. These
things would be found in some obscure corner of the last
page. Nobody read the paper. And obviously because the
editorials and columns were filled with adolescent slop
about "serious general" questions.
Now, Mr. H, I may be wrong about your viewpoint. I
have no doubt that there are some individuals on the cam
pus who are seriously and sincerely interested in discussing
"serious general" questions. And this is certainly not an
attempt to impede any progress which they might be able
to make if The Daily adopted a more "serious" or "gen
eral" policy. But I rather doubt the ability of a man 21
years of age or less to discuss intelligently these problems
facing America and the world every day in his editorials.
You know, Mr. H, most of us have just opened our eyes
to these subjects. We've taken a few introductory courses
in political science, history, or philosophy, maybe even
read a little Carl Marx, but for the most part (and I speak for
myself) we don't even know how to spell sociology. This
is no crime. After all, we are just learning; that's why we
are going to school, my God! And it will be a long time
before we will be able to really discuss "serious" and
"general" questions with any degree of understanding.
But there is something we can do. We can get things in
order within the walls of our "sleepy" little farm. We can
take an interest in local problems and try to settle them
with greater chances of success than if we attack some
revolutionary world problem about which we really know
little. Let s not stick our finger into problems of earth-shak
ing consequence before we clean up a few problems here
on our own little plot. Hell, maybe they aren't important
as far as the rest of the world thinks. Not immediately im
portant. But believe me, Mr. H, they will have a profound
effect on the world someday. I don't think this is an exag
geration. You can read for yourself the distinguished list
of Stanford graduates who probably were hot under the
collar about the Row-Hall question, or the Quad's need for
subset iptions. Why don't you go ask Dr. Tresidder or Her
bert Hoover just what they were doing when they were
undergraduates. Maybe they were concerned with the
Quad's need for more staff, or the Row-Hall question. Maybe
they did something about it. Or, more likely, they were
just learning how to get along with the rest of their fellow
students and having a lot of fun. But the point is that Stan
ford can do something for you; ask Dr. Tresidder or Mr.
Hoover, or most any graduate. And you can do something
for Stanford.
Yes, Mr. H, great things begin in very small ways, and
those who can take an interest in the local problems will
be better fitted to take over larger responsibilities. I think
The Daily helps us to realize what is going on in our own
small community, the Editor seems to be able to discuss
these things with clearness and understanding, and there is
some response evident on the Farm. I don't see anything
vapid or smug about it, rather I think it sparkles with Amer
ican collegiate humanness. Certainly, it's not perfect; and
certainly, it could be improved. But the thing to do is to get
in there and do something to make it better. Stinging and
caustic letters anonymously signed (except for a very lonely
little "H") do little. In fact one might call this the essence
of adolescence.
A suggestion which might open up The Daily to the
important questions facing America and the world better
than your sarcastic clamor for better editorials follows:
Why not have a column written by some professor who is
in a position to express an opinion on the subject? Let
him give direction to the discussion. Let him answer let
ters written to him asking his opinion on certain questions.
Or let him write an opinion on current events. I'm sure it
would be better than the attempts of any editor to discuss
the problems. Or better still, why don't you read Life, Time,
Newsweek, The Nation, and Fortune every morning and go
down to the Cellar and have a big bull session about it.
There you can talk "seriously" and "generally" about most
anything. And you will find that some Stanford students
axe keenly interested in the "strange, distant world outside
the Sleepy Farm," But don't talk to me, for I'll be reading
the drizzle of the "unfailing, self-conscious, . . . adolescent
boy-hasher.' It's the best thing in the paper anyway.

The Editor. Sir:
His right. The Daily is declining in intelligence along !
with the rest of the campus. The Daily should not string 1
along with the average student of today whose thoughts are
concentrated on how to get around rationing, how to con
tinue his deferment, or how to have the best possible time
before going in March. It should try to lead the campus in i
serious thinking over social and political problems prob- ;
lems of increasing importance, which have been played j
down since our campus was converted into a war plant.
The Daily can do this: run History 1943 at least once or !
twice a week, as before. This column need not comment on j
of battleships or effective firing power of tanks on :
the Tunisian front, but it can keep our eyes awake to vari- j
ous political problems which will bother us from now until
long after the war the recognizing of Vichy North Africa,
the Indian problem, China, etc. Don't cut out any important
n>ws to run this feature. Just remove a little of the grut
filied feature. No intelligent Stanford student is interested
in the hardships of the local clothing stores. No one who
reads the New Yorker wants to see the adolescent wit "bf
the Hasher. Let's take a stand, Daily, for more intelligent i
reading matter.

The Editor. Sir,
Listen, H, old boy, I hope you have cooled down enough
to listen to another opinion about The Stanford Daily. I too
have been at Stanford for four months, and have felt that
The Daily has been somewhat negligent in its coverage of
"serious general economic, political, and international ques
tions" to which you have so caustically referred. But, H,
old boy, you have failed to take into consideration some
very pertinent facts.
It is true that The Daily i 3 narrow in its scope. It con
fines itself, more or less, to the issues and events which
are taking place on the "Sleepy Farm." And I think it does
a reasonably good job of it. It is not, however, the Time
or the Newsweek of the Pacific Coast, nor the San Fran
cisco Examiner. It is simply a campus newspaper, made up
of students who devote a lot of time and effort in its pub
lication.

Now, I went to a university, California, to be exact,
where the editors think they are running a Time or a News
week, and, believe me, they talked about everything under
the sun, from capital punishment, labor conditions, national
politics, etc., to the future of the human race. At a moment's
notice some fiery-penned editor would decide whether Gen
eral Mac Arthur would run for President in 1944, when he
would attack next, and where and how; or whether the
U.S. would enter a World Court or not, and why the U.S.
would, and when.
Well, it was all very interesting (and sincerely written, I
believe). But, the things which affected the University of
California were sadly neglected. The things which the
university could do to help and promote interest in local
campus drives and politics were never before the campus.
There was even a rule in most sororities and fraternities
that the pledges were obligated to read the Daily and
search for the news which touched on campus doings. These

on our own little plot. Hell, maybe they aren't important
as far as the rest of the world thinks. Not immediately im
portant. But believe me, Mr. H, they will have a profound
effect on the world someday. I don't think this is an exag
geration. You can read for yourself the distinguished list
of Stanford graduates who probably were hot under the
collar about the Row-Hall question, or the Quad's need for
subset iptions. Why don't you go ask Dr. Tresidder or Her
bert Hoover just what they were doing when they were
undergraduates. Maybe they were concerned with the
Quad's need for more staff, or the Row-Hall question. Maybe
they did something about it. Or, more likely, they were
just learning how to get along with the rest of their fellow
students and having a lot of fun. But the point is that Stan
ford can do something for you; ask Dr. Tresidder or Mr.
Hoover, or most any graduate. And you can do something
for Stanford.
Yes, Mr. H, great things begin in very small ways, and
those who can take an interest in the local problems will
be better fitted to take over larger responsibilities. I think
The Daily helps us to realize what is going on in our own
small community, the Editor seems to be able to discuss
these things with clearness and understanding, and there is
some response evident on the Farm. I don't see anything
vapid or smug about it, rather I think it sparkles with Amer
ican collegiate humanness. Certainly, it's not perfect; and
certainly, it could be improved. But the thing to do is to get
in there and do something to make it better. Stinging and
caustic letters anonymously signed (except for a very lonely
little "H") do little. In fact one might call this the essence
of adolescence.
A suggestion which might open up The Daily to the
important questions facing America and the world better
than your sarcastic clamor for better editorials follows:
Why not have a column written by some professor who is
in a position to express an opinion on the subject? Let
him give direction to the discussion. Let him answer let
ters written to him asking his opinion on certain questions.
Or let him write an opinion on current events. I'm sure it
would be better than the attempts of any editor to discuss
the problems. Or better still, why don't you read Life, Time,
Newsweek, The Nation, and Fortune every morning and go
down to the Cellar and have a big bull session about it.
There you can talk "seriously" and "generally" about most
anything. And you will find that some Stanford students
axe keenly interested in the "strange, distant world outside
the Sleepy Farm," But don't talk to me, for I'll be reading
the drizzle of the "unfailing, self-conscious, . . . adolescent
boy-hasher.' It's the best thing in the paper anyway.

The Editor. Sir:
His right. The Daily is declining in intelligence along !
with the rest of the campus. The Daily should not string 1
along with the average student of today whose thoughts are
concentrated on how to get around rationing, how to con
tinue his deferment, or how to have the best possible time
before going in March. It should try to lead the campus in i
serious thinking over social and political problems prob- ;
lems of increasing importance, which have been played j
down since our campus was converted into a war plant.
The Daily can do this: run History 1943 at least once or !
twice a week, as before. This column need not comment on j
of battleships or effective firing power of tanks on :
the Tunisian front, but it can keep our eyes awake to vari- j
ous political problems which will bother us from now until
long after the war the recognizing of Vichy North Africa,
the Indian problem, China, etc. Don't cut out any important
n>ws to run this feature. Just remove a little of the grut
filied feature. No intelligent Stanford student is interested
in the hardships of the local clothing stores. No one who
reads the New Yorker wants to see the adolescent wit "bf
the Hasher. Let's take a stand, Daily, for more intelligent i
reading matter.
Dave Colburn j
The Editor. Sir,
Listen, H, old boy, I hope you have cooled down enough
to listen to another opinion about The Stanford Daily. I too
have been at Stanford for four months, and have felt that
The Daily has been somewhat negligent in its coverage of
"serious general economic, political, and international ques
tions" to which you have so caustically referred. But, H,
old boy, you have failed to take into consideration some
very pertinent facts.
It is true that The Daily i 3 narrow in its scope. It con
fines itself, more or less, to the issues and events which
are taking place on the "Sleepy Farm." And I think it does
a reasonably good job of it. It is not, however, the Time
or the Newsweek of the Pacific Coast, nor the San Fran
cisco Examiner. It is simply a campus newspaper, made up
of students who devote a lot of time and effort in its pub
lication.

Now, I went to a university, California, to be exact,
where the editors think they are running a Time or a News
week, and, believe me, they talked about everything under
the sun, from capital punishment, labor conditions, national
politics, etc., to the future of the human race. At a moment's
notice some fiery-penned editor would decide whether Gen
eral Mac Arthur would run for President in 1944, when he
would attack next, and where and how; or whether the
U.S. would enter a World Court or not, and why the U.S.
would, and when.
Well, it was all very interesting (and sincerely written, I
believe). But, the things which affected the University of
California were sadly neglected. The things which the
university could do to help and promote interest in local
campus drives and politics were never before the campus.
There was even a rule in most sororities and fraternities
that the pledges were obligated to read the Daily and
search for the news which touched on campus doings. These
things would be found in some obscure corner of the last
page. Nobody read the paper. And obviously because the
editorials and columns were filled with adolescent slop
about "serious general" questions.
Now, Mr. H, I may be wrong about your viewpoint. I
have no doubt that there are some individuals on the cam
pus who are seriously and sincerely interested in discussing
"serious general" questions. And this is certainly not an
attempt to impede any progress which they might be able
to make if The Daily adopted a more "serious" or "gen
eral" policy. But I rather doubt the ability of a man 21
years of age or less to discuss intelligently these problems
facing America and the world every day in his editorials.
You know, Mr. H, most of us have just opened our eyes
to these subjects. We've taken a few introductory courses
in political science, history, or philosophy, maybe even
read a little Carl Marx, but for the most part (and I speak for
myself) we don't even know how to spell sociology. This
is no crime. After all, we are just learning; that's why we
are going to school, my God! And it will be a long time
before we will be able to really discuss "serious" and
"general" questions with any degree of understanding.
But there is something we can do. We can get things in
order within the walls of our "sleepy" little farm. We can
take an interest in local problems and try to settle them
with greater chances of success than if we attack some
revolutionary world problem about which we really know
little. Let s not stick our finger into problems of earth-shak
ing consequence before we clean up a few problems here
on our own little plot. Hell, maybe they aren't important
as far as the rest of the world thinks. Not immediately im

of adolescence.
A suggestion which might open up The Daily to the
important questions facing America and the world better
than your sarcastic clamor for better editorials follows:
Why not have a column written by some professor who is
in a position to express an opinion on the subject? Let
him give direction to the discussion. Let him answer let
ters written to him asking his opinion on certain questions.
Or let him write an opinion on current events. I'm sure it
would be better than the attempts of any editor to discuss
the problems. Or better still, why don't you read Life, Time,
Newsweek, The Nation, and Fortune every morning and go
down to the Cellar and have a big bull session about it.
There you can talk "seriously" and "generally" about most
anything. And you will find that some Stanford students
axe keenly interested in the "strange, distant world outside
the Sleepy Farm," But don't talk to me, for I'll be reading
the drizzle of the "unfailing, self-conscious, . . . adolescent
boy-hasher.' It's the best thing in the paper anyway.

The Editor. Sir:
His right. The Daily is declining in intelligence along !
with the rest of the campus. The Daily should not string 1
along with the average student of today whose thoughts are
concentrated on how to get around rationing, how to con
tinue his deferment, or how to have the best possible time
before going in March. It should try to lead the campus in i
serious thinking over social and political problems prob- ;
lems of increasing importance, which have been played j
down since our campus was converted into a war plant.
The Daily can do this: run History 1943 at least once or !
twice a week, as before. This column need not comment on j
of battleships or effective firing power of tanks on :
the Tunisian front, but it can keep our eyes awake to vari- j
ous political problems which will bother us from now until
long after the war the recognizing of Vichy North Africa,
the Indian problem, China, etc. Don't cut out any important
n>ws to run this feature. Just remove a little of the grut
filied feature. No intelligent Stanford student is interested
in the hardships of the local clothing stores. No one who
reads the New Yorker wants to see the adolescent wit "bf
the Hasher. Let's take a stand, Daily, for more intelligent i
reading matter.
Dave Colburn j
The Editor. Sir,
Listen, H, old boy, I hope you have cooled down enough
to listen to another opinion about The Stanford Daily. I too
have been at Stanford for four months, and have felt that
The Daily has been somewhat negligent in its coverage of
"serious general economic, political, and international ques
tions" to which you have so caustically referred. But, H,
old boy, you have failed to take into consideration some
very pertinent facts.
It is true that The Daily i 3 narrow in its scope. It con
fines itself, more or less, to the issues and events which
are taking place on the "Sleepy Farm." And I think it does
a reasonably good job of it. It is not, however, the Time
or the Newsweek of the Pacific Coast, nor the San Fran
cisco Examiner. It is simply a campus newspaper, made up
of students who devote a lot of time and effort in its pub
lication.

Now, I went to a university, California, to be exact,
where the editors think they are running a Time or a News
week, and, believe me, they talked about everything under
the sun, from capital punishment, labor conditions, national
politics, etc., to the future of the human race. At a moment's
notice some fiery-penned editor would decide whether Gen
eral Mac Arthur would run for President in 1944, when he
would attack next, and where and how; or whether the
U.S. would enter a World Court or not, and why the U.S.
would, and when.
Well, it was all very interesting (and sincerely written, I
believe). But, the things which affected the University of
California were sadly neglected. The things which the
university could do to help and promote interest in local
campus drives and politics were never before the campus.
There was even a rule in most sororities and fraternities
that the pledges were obligated to read the Daily and
search for the news which touched on campus doings. These
things would be found in some obscure corner of the last
page. Nobody read the paper. And obviously because the
editorials and columns were filled with adolescent slop
about "serious general" questions.
Now, Mr. H, I may be wrong about your viewpoint. I
have no doubt that there are some individuals on the cam
pus who are seriously and sincerely interested in discussing
"serious general" questions. And this is certainly not an
attempt to impede any progress which they might be able
to make if The Daily adopted a more "serious" or "gen
eral" policy. But I rather doubt the ability of a man 21
years of age or less to discuss intelligently these problems
facing America and the world every day in his editorials.
You know, Mr. H, most of us have just opened our eyes
to these subjects. We've taken a few introductory courses
in political science, history, or philosophy, maybe even
read a little Carl Marx, but for the most part (and I speak for
myself) we don't even know how to spell sociology. This
is no crime. After all, we are just learning; that's why we
are going to school, my God! And it will be a long time
before we will be able to really discuss "serious" and
"general" questions with any degree of understanding.
But there is something we can do. We can get things in
order within the walls of our "sleepy" little farm. We can
take an interest in local problems and try to settle them
with greater chances of success than if we attack some
revolutionary world problem about which we really know
little. Let s not stick our finger into problems of earth-shak
ing consequence before we clean up a few problems here
on our own little plot. Hell, maybe they aren't important
as far as the rest of the world thinks. Not immediately im
portant. But believe me, Mr. H, they will have a profound
effect on the world someday. I don't think this is an exag
geration. You can read for yourself the distinguished list
of Stanford graduates who probably were hot under the
collar about the Row-Hall question, or the Quad's need for
subset iptions. Why don't you go ask Dr. Tresidder or Her
bert Hoover just what they were doing when they were
undergraduates. Maybe they were concerned with the
Quad's need for more staff, or the Row-Hall question. Maybe
they did something about it. Or, more likely, they were
just learning how to get along with the rest of their fellow
students and having a lot of fun. But the point is that Stan
ford can do something for you; ask Dr. Tresidder or Mr.
Hoover, or most any graduate. And you can do something
for Stanford.
Yes, Mr. H, great things begin in very small ways, and
those who can take an interest in the local problems will
be better fitted to take over larger responsibilities. I think
The Daily helps us to realize what is going on in our own
small community, the Editor seems to be able to discuss
these things with clearness and understanding, and there is
some response evident on the Farm. I don't see anything
vapid or smug about it, rather I think it sparkles with Amer
ican collegiate humanness. Certainly, it's not perfect; and
certainly, it could be improved. But the thing to do is to get
in there and do something to make it better. Stinging and
caustic letters anonymously signed (except for a very lonely
little "H") do little. In fact one might call this the essence
of adolescence.

of battleships or effective firing power of tanks on :
the Tunisian front, but it can keep our eyes awake to vari- j
ous political problems which will bother us from now until
long after the war the recognizing of Vichy North Africa,
the Indian problem, China, etc. Don't cut out any important
n>ws to run this feature. Just remove a little of the grut
filied feature. No intelligent Stanford student is interested
in the hardships of the local clothing stores. No one who
reads the New Yorker wants to see the adolescent wit "bf
the Hasher. Let's take a stand, Daily, for more intelligent i
reading matter.
