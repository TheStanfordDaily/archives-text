The Editor, Sir:
The first violent criticism of the
Stanford Daily that I have read in
two years appeared in this column
yesterday. It is unfortunate that
this one written criticism, signed by
"H", should be so intolerant and
uninformed.
I agree with the main point of
"H's" criticism, for I believe the
Daily should be more editorially
aware of contemporary issues than
it is today. But '"H" stretches this
one specific criticism to cover his
general and complete denunciation
of the paper.
Because the Daily does not satisfy
"H's" requirements of editorial pers
picacity, it does not necessarily
mean that the Daily is "one of the
most vapid, smug, worthless pieces
of literature to be found on any uni
versity campus in America."
This accusation reveals that "H"
is grossly uninformed as to the func
tions of a newspaper. The main pur
pose of a newspaper is to dissemi
nate news, and in my opinion the
daily does a good job of covering the
campus and presenting its readers
with a comprehensive and accurate
knowledge of student activities.
I have had occasion to examine
college newspapers throughout the
country and very few measure up to
the standards set by the Daily in
news coverage—the main function
of a newspaper. Many of them are

superior to the Daily in editorial e:
pression, but this superiority h
usually been accomplished at a cc
to news coverage.
Furthermore, much of the edito
rial expression found in other cc
lege newspapers is immature and ii
competent. Perhaps it stands to tl
credit of the Daily's editors that th«
have consistently concentrated t
improving news coverage rath
than attempting to editorialize t
complex subjects about which colle
students cannot pretend to be con
petent authorities.
I am sure that "H" would not ha'
been so strong and bitter in 1
criticism had he been more inform*
of the 1 unctions of a campus new
paper and more tolerant of the difl
culties confronting a student st;
during wartime.

The Editor, Sir:
The first violent criticism of the
Stanford Daily that I have read in
two years appeared in this column
yesterday. It is unfortunate that
this one written criticism, signed by
"H", should be so intolerant and
uninformed.
I agree with the main point of
"H's" criticism, for I believe the
Daily should be more editorially
aware of contemporary issues than
it is today. But '"H" stretches this
one specific criticism to cover his
general and complete denunciation
of the paper.
Because the Daily does not satisfy
"H's" requirements of editorial pers
picacity, it does not necessarily
mean that the Daily is "one of the
most vapid, smug, worthless pieces
of literature to be found on any uni
versity campus in America."
This accusation reveals that "H"
is grossly uninformed as to the func
