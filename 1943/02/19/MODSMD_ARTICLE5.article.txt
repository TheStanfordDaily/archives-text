# Hot Water Blesses Toyon's Inhabitants
## 
### 
"Here at last!" "Really hot!"
"I'd almost forgotten how good it
feels." Such were the excited cries
to be heard in two wings of Toyon
Hall this week.
A pacifying necessity had been
brought back to several corridors
which had been without it since
the end of Fall Quarter.
That necessity was HOT
WATER. The men in the north
and northwest wings of the hall
have been existing on a diet of
cold water exclusively this quar
ter due to the cracking of a boiler
head plate in December.
The plate is repaired now, how
ever, and Toyon men are shaving
and taking showers againâ€”much
to their relief.
