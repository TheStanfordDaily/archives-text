# Noble Prize Given To Stanford Man
## 
### 
The Alfred Noble Prize for junior
engineers has been awarded by the
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers to George Wesley Dunlap, a
former Stanford graduate.
Dr. Dunlap received the prize for
the best technical paper by a junior
engineer of the Western Society of
Engineers. The paper, "The Re
covery Voltage Analyzer for Deter
mination of Circuit Recovery Char
acteristics." was published by the
American Institute of Electrical En
gineers a little more than a year ago.
The engineer received the A.B.
degree in 1931, the electrical engi
neering degree in 1933, and the Ph.D.
in 1936, all from Stanford University.
"Dr. Dunlap's graduate work at
Stanford was at the Ryan High Vol
tage Laboratory, where he special
ized in studies of high voltage losses
on power lines," says Dr. H. H. Skill
! ing, acting head of Stanford's de
l partment of electrical engineering.
