## 
### 
Army plans concerning Stan
ford are still indefinite, Chancel
lor Ray Lyman Wilbur said on re
turning- to the campus Friday.
"In effect, all we are doing is
awaiting orders," he said. "It's
like a congestion: when one part
moves the rest will move.
"It's certain." Dr. Wilbur said,
"that all men over 18, unless in
4F. will be in uniform within a
short time, although they may be
in training schools. Women may
remain in colleges taken over by
the Army which will use only
three-fourths of the facilities."
Dr. Wilbur stressed that the
medical course will not be dis
turbed, but will be concentrated.
More definite plans about the 400
engineering trainees the Army is
going to train here will be known
when Col. Harry B. Allen returns
later this week from a Salt
City conference.
