Reviewed by Dean Mary Yost last j
week, two plans which may allevi
ate the criticized evils of Stanford's
sorority system will be presented to
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur for
consideration today.
Following an objection to the evils
of the system on this campus and a |
challenge to the houses to examine
their superfluous position, proposed |
by the Roble sponsors Jan. 28. a 1
Pan-Hellenic appointed committee i
drew up alternate remedial plans.
One plan, formulated by the pres
idents of Stanford's nine sororities,
presents a method to better the so
rority system as it now stands; the
other plan, drawn up by a group
af sponsors, is based on complete !
abolition of Greek letter chapters,
placing all of Stanford's women in
dormitories.
Representatives of sororities were
informed of the sponsors' stand on
he much contended issue at a meet
ng called in January.
