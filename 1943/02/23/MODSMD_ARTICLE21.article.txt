### 
With newcomer Bernard Woody j
pitching two-hit shutout ball to |
down the Alameda Coast Guard 6
to 0 Saturday, and with Larry Wolf ;
going the route against San Jose
State to beat the Spartans 7 to 5 J
Friday afternoon, Stanford's fast- j
improving baseball team emerged j
from the losing doldrums over the
weekend.
In limiting the Sea Lions to two
singles and sending seven men down
via strikeouts Woody registered the
best performance of the still young
season for the Stanford mound staff.
He was only in trouble once when, in
the eighth, the Coast Guard loaded
the bases with two out on a pair of !
walks and a single by Wells. How
ever, Woody pulled up from a 3 and
1 count to force the batter to fly out,
thus ending the Sea Lions' only
threat.
Cards Start Fast
Saturday's game saw the Cardinals [
start out fast in the first inning ;
when, after walking, Lee Scott came ,

home on Bob Brown's double. Two
runs each in the third and fourth
iced the game for the Indians. The
final tally came in the eighth when
Lee Merriman tripled and scored on
Walkup's single.
Friday afternoon San Jose State
menaced from the beginning by
scoring three times in their first time
lit bat, but nothing daunted, the In
dians came right back to also score
three times and knot the count. The
Woltermen went ahead in their half
of the second, scoring two runs when
with two out Merriman doubled
home Lee Scott, who had walked.
Bob Brown's single sent Merriman
across the home hassock for the sec
ond tally.
Indians Score Again
The Indians scored again in the
fifth when Jay McKie singled and
was sent around by Jack Brownson's
single. The last marker came in the
same fashion with Duke Hammett
and Larry Wolf doing the singling.
The Spartans scored twice in their
half of the eighth to make the game
interesting. Maracucci got on first on
Cunha's error.

With newcomer Bernard Woody j
pitching two-hit shutout ball to |
down the Alameda Coast Guard 6
to 0 Saturday, and with Larry Wolf ;
going the route against San Jose
State to beat the Spartans 7 to 5 J
Friday afternoon, Stanford's fast- j
improving baseball team emerged j
from the losing doldrums over the
weekend.
In limiting the Sea Lions to two
singles and sending seven men down
via strikeouts Woody registered the
best performance of the still young
season for the Stanford mound staff.
He was only in trouble once when, in
the eighth, the Coast Guard loaded
the bases with two out on a pair of !
walks and a single by Wells. How
ever, Woody pulled up from a 3 and
1 count to force the batter to fly out,
thus ending the Sea Lions' only
threat.
Cards Start Fast
Saturday's game saw the Cardinals [
start out fast in the first inning ;
when, after walking, Lee Scott came ,

home on Bob Brown's double. Two
runs each in the third and fourth
iced the game for the Indians. The
final tally came in the eighth when
Lee Merriman tripled and scored on
Walkup's single.
Friday afternoon San Jose State
menaced from the beginning by
scoring three times in their first time
lit bat, but nothing daunted, the In
dians came right back to also score
three times and knot the count. The
Woltermen went ahead in their half
of the second, scoring two runs when
with two out Merriman doubled
home Lee Scott, who had walked.
Bob Brown's single sent Merriman
across the home hassock for the sec
ond tally.
