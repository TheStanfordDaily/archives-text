## Indian Cagers To Play UCLA 
### 
Out of the southern division race
for good, Everett Dean's cagers will
start concentrating today for a re
turn engagement with U.C.L.A. here
Friday night. Over last weekend,
the Indians dropped both games on
their southern junket to the Bruins
and Trojans in Los Angeles.
Main reason for the double set
back was lack of aim when the score
board was paying off. Against
U.C.L.A., Stanford turned in a
whirlwind ball game, only to lose
out in the final minutes when it
failed to connect.
One week from Friday the Stan
iord-California series resumes with
one game to be played here and the
other at Berkeley.
Stanford and California are tied
for cellar position, having beaten the
other once while dropping four
other league contests. Small con
solation for the Indians comes in the
fact that the 117-point total of both
teams in the U.C.L.A.-Indian affair,
is the second highest combined score
in conference history, and the total
combined score of the Troy-Stanford
game, 116, is the third highest.
