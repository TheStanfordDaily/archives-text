# For Sororities
## 
### 
To be said in favor of sororities are:
They bring the benefits of a small living
group with its homelike atmosphere to women
students; they offer "little" things, important
things that promote good and friendly relations
among their members.
Such advantages as getting together to make
breakfast Sunday mornings, having birthdays
on the right day, or having two phones to serve
30 girlsâ€”these are among the "little" things
that count.
Behind the sororities lie 50 years honorably
and well-lived. They have provided living ac
commodations for a large number of Stanford
women. They have cooperated whole-heartedly
with the policies of the University; they have
maintained a high standard of personal conduct
and ideals; they have exercised a wholesome
supervision over their younger members; they
have contributed to constructive campus leader
ship; they have' fostered both individual and
group responsibility to the extent that a girl's
selfish interests are subordinated to the interests
of the whole orgnization, for she carries with her
the integrity of the group which she represents;
they have brought about individual leadership
in that during a girl's three years of active so
rority life she holds at least one responsible
leadership position; they have proved a valu
able medium for building up and retaining alum
nae interest in the University, interest which
has, in many instances, resulted in substantial
financial support for the University.
The sorority with its tight self-government
does much to help some girls. The feeling of
comradeship created by having been elected to
the group gives some girls self-confidence. The
advice of older girls helps some develop both
socially and academically. And the strong emo
tional feeling that is the core of sorority in part
helps to complete the college lives of sorority
women.
