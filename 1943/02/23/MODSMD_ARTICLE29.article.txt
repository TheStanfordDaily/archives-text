# For the Non-Sorority, System
## 
### 
To be said in favor of a non-sorority system
at Stanford are:
It is democratic. Those who are admitted to
Stanford gained their admittance on tests of
worth—intelligence tests, previous high school
records and letters of recommendation from
well gualified persons.
Those who gain admittance to sororities do
so on standards of less value than those of the
University—whether a girl has a cute figure,
whether she is shy, or whether she has a glib
tongue.
A non-sorority system places the emphasis

on the individual and not on the group. A girl
stands on her merits, not behind the name of
a sorority.
The non-sorority system allows friendships
to develop along natural lines—mutual inter
ests and mutual respect, and not around the
artificial core of Greek letters.
The non-sorority system tends to keep social
life in proper balance with the other phases of
university activity. And there is no artificial
stratification of women because of the group
to which they belong.
Non-sorority groups foster natural leader
ship. Although, as a rule, more campus leaders
come from sororities, they are leaders when
they are pledged. Often a girl is forced to drop
out of an activity because some member of her
house is already a leader in that activity.
In a non-sorority system there is no rushing
with its waste of time, effort/ and money. There
is no rushing with its resulting hurt to those
who, through no fault of their own, were
dropped.
Without sororities interest is centered on the
university, as at Smith and Vassar, and not on
the various houses which need a new paint job
or new furniture.
