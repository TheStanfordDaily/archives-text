The Stanford Daily feels that sororities no
longer have a place on the Stanford campus.
We feel that they are undemocratic, that they
tend to misplace emphasis of the University
toward social, not academic ends, that they curb
some girls and make all girls dependent on the
group, that they restrict natural friendships
and foster race prejudice.
Then, too, with sororities goes rushing and
all its evils which, because of the system itself,
cannot be avoided. The unfair, undemocratic,
arbitrary standards by which women are voted
into the sororities are cause for serious troubles
both for those voted in and those dropped.
Many a college career has been harmed be
cause a girl was overly shy and was dropped.
We feel that six hours is too short a time to
choose one's friends and living group for three
years of college and a lifetime of loyalties and
obligations.
We feel that sororities have had in the past
a place on the campus and that they have done
a good job, but we feel that they are outmoded
—that they no longer have a place on the cam
pus. An increasingly large number of women
are entering Stanford. We cannot have two out
of every three hurt by arbitrary standards. We
cannot have quarterly rush periods which the
new speed-up program will necessitate, for we
cannot afford to waste our time.
We cannot have sororities.
Although this is the editorial feeling of The
Daily, we will report the news honestly and
play it fairly, and our views will be restricted
to editorial columns.
