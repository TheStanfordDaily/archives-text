# OUR HASHER SEZ

### 
The Editor, Sir:
Let's face itâ€”these letters that have been
coming from "H" and from Claude Harmon Mc-
Entyre Junior and Dave Colburn were paid for
by me as a publicity gag. The entire affair was
a farce and now that it has been aired we can
| all forget about it since it was done in jest and
all of these guys think that The Daily and
Hasher Sez, in particular, are really swell.
(Signed) "H"
(My real name is Our Hasher,
but I'm adolescent and don't
want it signed.)

(The following is a paid advertisement.)
All those who get up before 7 a.m. next
Friday morning will get to buy one-half dozen
of the February Chaparral. If you will recall, it
; is the Serviceman's Having-Wonderful-Time-
Wish-You-Were-Here number.
The rest of the student body will be limited
; to two copies.
