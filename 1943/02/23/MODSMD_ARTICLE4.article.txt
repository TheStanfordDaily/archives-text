# RED CROSS WAR FUND
## Campus Drive Begins Today; Quota Set at $1 Per Person 
### 
Stanford's Red Cross War Fund drive booms to the foreground today
with every living group on campus being asked to contribute at least one
dollar per person to reach the Farm's $3,000 quota.
The Stanford War Board speaker's bureau, headed by Don Shannon, will
send speakers to every eating group on campus today or tomorrow so that

♦as many Stanfordites as possible
will understand the necessity for
making this drive a 100 per cent suc
cess.
This War Fund drive, the first Red
I Cross campaign at Stanford since
1941, is exclusively a student affair.
Under the chairmanship of Miriam
King, the War Fund committee is
seeking to equal or exceed the $3,000
quota which has been set for it.
Preceding the national month-long
War Fund drive by a week, this
campaign is expected to give much
data on how successful the national
drive will be. Miss King, in com
menting on this fact, stated, "We
hope this War Fund campaign goes

over with a bang, because if it does,
that fact will be published and that
is the best kind of publicity that
Stanford can get."
The Stanford drive was moved up
by permission of the Red Cross in
order that students would not be
bothered while studying for finals.
Miss King also emphasized that
this War Fund campaign is a special
activity of the Red Cross and apart
from its annual roll call.
"National headquarters," she said,
"plans to collect 130 million dollars
throughout the country during the
month of March. Of this money, 80
million will go to national head
quarters while the remaining 50 mil
lion will be distributed to the local
chapters in the United States.
