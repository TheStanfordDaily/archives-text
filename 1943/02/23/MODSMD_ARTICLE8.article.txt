## Knickerbocker To Talk Here 
### 
With sidelights on the battle for
Tunisia and "Second Front" prep
arations, H. R. Knickerbocker, Pu
litzer Prize-winning war corre
spondent, will speak in Memorial
Hall Thursday evening at 7:30.
Knickerbocker has just returned
from North Africa where he covered
military operations from Allied
headquarters. He will forecast what
will happen in the event of either an
Allied or a Nazi victory, comparing
the future plans of the opposing
powers. He will discuss the possi
bilities of a lasting peace and will
make startling predictions concern
ing the world of tomorrow.
Vivid Lecturer
His lecture will be illuminated by
anecdotes, personal reminiscences,
vivid eye-witness accounts, and
scintillating wit.
One of Knickerbocker's most
memorable war experiences was
with a giant United States bomber
on an "attack mission" while cover
ing the war from General Mac A
rthur's headquarters. Describing the
attack on a Japanese airdrome,
Knickerbocker wrote:
"We went in at 900 feet with all
our machine guns firing, and the
Japanese anti-aircraft guns belch
ing right in our faces. I watched our
bombs pouring out of the bomb
racks behind me and could see
them falling, slowly at first, and then
streaming toward the ground, go
ing faster and faster and burst into
sheets of flame so high we could feel
hot gusts through the bay door of
the bomber."
Jap Zero Attacks
A Jap Zero attacked Knicker
bocker's ship, and incendiary bullets
were "streaking past us like burning
balls from a Roman candle." After
another run over the target, Knicker
bocker's bomber sped away to its
home base, where the correspondent,
unscathed, sent the story* overseas
to America. AU in the day's work.
