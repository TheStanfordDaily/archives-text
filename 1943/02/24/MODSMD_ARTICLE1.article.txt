# Students Urged To Apply for Ration Book II
## Must Present First Book: Deadline Set For Saturday 
### Carole Carpenter 
Registration on campus yesterday
for Ration Book II reached the 800
mark, with only half of the appli
cants being students. This number
falls short of the daily turnout ex
pected by application committee.
Therefore, students are urged to
complete their registration as soon
as possible so that the board will not
be swamped the last part of the
week.
The 1.600 remaining students who
eat in the University dining halls
must first obtain their Ration Book
1 from the Accounting Department
located in the Administration build
ing. These books must be presented
at the board in order to receive
Book 11. After registering, both
books must be taken back to the
Accounting Department.
Appications for rationing books
will continue every afternoon from
2 p.m. to 5 p.m. until Friday. Satur
day, the last day, the board wil
open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
Even though applications may be
made up to Saturday, the rationing
committee urges students not to put
o(T registering until the end of the
week.
A copy of the consumer declara
tion card will be found on page 6
of tliis morning's Daily. It is to be
filled out before applying for ra
tion book II.)
