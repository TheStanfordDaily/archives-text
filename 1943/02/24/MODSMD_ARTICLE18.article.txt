## Council Makes Initiation Legal 
### 
Interfraternity Council last night
made it legal for Stanford's fraterni
ties to initiate at any time any mem
bers who are in good standing. This
means that the houses may now in- [
itiale this year's pledges.
The council, meeting at the Chi ;
Psi house, also elected new officers
and decided that there would be no j
rushing of the frosh who are now j
entering Stanford.
Bob Sylva, D.U., will succeed Lee
Peake as president of Interfraternity
Council and Johnny Twitchell, Fiji, i
will take over Ben Parkinson's post
as secretary-treasurer.
The council decided that, although !
frosh may be initiated, no pre-initia
tion period or "hell week" will be
permitted. Houses will be limited to
formal initiations only.
"Any violation of this rule will be ;
very severely dealt with," Peake
emphasized.
The precedent of not initiating new j
members until their sophomore year
has been broken due to the wartime
conditions which make it uncertain
that either houses or present frosh
will be here next fall.
Peake also pointed out that the
council will deal severely with any
house which rushes the new fresh
men who are moving into Encina to
take part in the new speed-up course
which the University is offering to
high school graduates and some high
school seniors.
