H. R. Knickerbocker, Pulitzer
Prize-winning war correspondent,
will give the inside story of the
North African campaign at a lec
ture in Memorial Hall tomorrow
evening at 7:30.
Since the outbreak of war in 1939,
Knickerbocker has been following
the latest developments around the
globe—in Australia, New Guinea,
Java, England, Egypt, Russia.
From June to October 1940. he
covered the heavy Nazi air blitz on
London and then came home to lec
ture and to write his book, "Is To
morrow Hitler's?".
On Firing Lines
In his lecture here, Knickerbocker
will recount his experiences on the
firing lines where American armed
forces are now in action around the
world. He was in Java when the
Japanese attacked, escaped from
there to Australia and then went on
to Mac Arthur's camp.
Knickerbocker's career beg a n
when he laid plans to enter college
to study psychiatry. He found, how

ever, that he only had enough money
for a journalism course at Columbia.
Four years later, a succession of
New York newspaper jobs behind
him, he sailed for Germany and en
rolled for psychiatric study at the
University of Munich. To help de
fray expenses he occasionally aided
other correspondents at Munich.
During the infamous "beer house
putsch" when Hitler first tried to
seize control of the German govern
ment, he was pressed into regular
correspondence.
Pulitzer Prize
In 1930 he was awarded the Pulit
zer Prize for a series of stories based
on his observations in Russia.
Recently returned from North
Africa, Knickerbocker will conduct
an audience forum after his regular
lecture in Memorial Hall tomorrow
night.
