# Card Basketballers Will Face Best U.C.L.A. Team' on Friday
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity basketball team returns to Pavilion practice land to
y for whatever preparation it can acquire for the U.C.L.A. Bruins who
v'ade the Farm Friday night, "The best U.C.L.A. team I've ever seen," |
wording to Everett Dean.
f'ne unknown factor that no one noticed in Wilbur John's U.C.L.A.

up was one Barksdale, a center
10 is sharp enough on the back
ards to match Howie Dallmar.
Against the Bruins, Dean said, the
anford ollense in passing and
ooting was nearly the best it has
r.>n all year, but the defense, usual
the local's strong point, was
itched by the cagey Bruins.
The slippery Barksdale was all
er the boards, and added to his
ints were 18 by Perry and 16 by
est. Dallmar and Ed Voss both
ide 17 points, but Stanford lost in
e second half after leading 37-36
halftime.
The Friday night engagement here
ould be one of the sharpest of the
a son.
C.S. at Hottest
In the U.S.C. tilt. Stanford faced
S.C. at its hottesl. Bruin Coach
ilbur Johns, who was scouting the
me, told Dean later that he hadn't
en the Trojans so lired up all
ason, showing that they were still
.spectful of the Stanford talent.
The fast break renewal seems to
• worthwhile. Dean said that the
ooting and floor work were better
the two southland games than in
ly of those under the old system.
The U.S.C. game was lost when at
31-31 tie, Ed Voss was evicted on
•rsonals. Stanford's backboard con
ol went with him, and Gene Rock
arted to slip in and around the
eaker Stanford defense.
.C.A.A. Title
There is no doubt In our minds
tat U.S.C. is capable of bringing
lother N.C.A.A. title to the Coast
.is year. And even Stanford fans
ho view the whole outcome in mel
icholy must admit that they've
irned their shot at the big money.
Only Stanford injury was Dall
itr's bruised hip. He and the rest
the squad are otherwise in shape.
