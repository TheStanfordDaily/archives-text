# Schwartz Denies Notre Dame Offer
## 
### 
Marchie Schwartz, Stanford's
head football coach, denied last
night he might soon take a posi
tion at Notre Dame.
"I'm planning spring football
practice sometime in April,"
Schwartz said, "and I'll be here to
handle the Indians next fall if the
University wants me."
Schwartz brought the Stanford
eleven from a slow start to a
whirlwind finish last season when
the Indians finished their season
by being the first team on the coast
to defeat St. Mary's Pre-Flight.
