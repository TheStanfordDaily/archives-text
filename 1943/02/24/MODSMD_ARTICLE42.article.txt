A BOMBER STATION, some
wheie in England, Feb. 24.—"He11, j
it ain't possible to bring one back j
in that condition."
That's what a ground crew man
remarked on viewing the condition j
of a Flying Fortress brought in by
Lieut. Donald R. Stockton, Stanford,
'42, with only a skeleton of Ihe rud
der left—and that was almost use- j
Jess.
Lieut. Stockton, whose family ;
lives in Los Angeles, just returned j
from the heaviest of six bombing ;
raids made on the Nazi submarine 1
base of St. Nazaire, where he helped j
tight o T swarms of yellow-nosed j
Focke-Wulff fighters after leaving j
the Ftvnch coastal base under a
pall of smoke.
The planes from the base were

j led by Capt. Jacob W. Fredericks
j of Indiana, but most of the congrat
ulations over postfi-ight coffee went 1
to Lieut. Stockton.
A 20-millimeter cannon shell had
blasted a hole so big in his ship that
Lieut. H. E. Miller, the ship's navi
gator, said "I bet I could walk
through it without stooping."
Lieut. Stockton's Fortress was '
j nicknamed "Joe Btfsptk II," after j
! the Li'l Abner comic strip.
He gave much of the credit for
his ship's safe return to Capt. Har- I
; old Stouse of Spokane, Wash., who |
j gave them good protective cover,
ilt was good birthday present for '
Stockton, who celebrated his 22nd ;
J birthday two days later.
Lieut. Stockton is affiliated with
