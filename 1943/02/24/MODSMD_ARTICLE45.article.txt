## Farm Labor Problem Handled In 'Blundering Way,' Says Davis 
### 
The farm labor situation was handled in a "rather blundering way," last
year, according to Dr. Joseph S. Davis, director of the Food Research In
stitute.
Dr. Davis recently returned from a trip to Washington, where he at
tended meetings of the American Economic Association and the Food and
Nutrition Board and continued re- â™¦

search for the Institute. Mr. Wick
izer, who accompanied him, returned
earlier.
Dr. Davis has been interested in
the farm labor situation, especially

in the use of students and adult nun
farm labor. Even though this prob
lem has in general been handled in
a bungling manner, so much so that
many needed crops could not be
harvested due to an insufficient sup
ply of labor.
High Schools Participate
In California, he continued, the
high school principals have taken
"rather good steps."' At Sequoia
High, for instance, 1.000 of the 1.700
students are this year growing Vic
tory gardens. The school, further
more, is raising tomato plants from
seeds. The young plants will be sold
to the students for their gardens.
"I imagine that the Joi'dan School
and the Palo Alto High School are
also folowing similar programs," he
said, "but I do not know the details
since I have not talked with their
principals since my return."
Department of Agriculture
This year the farm labor has been
put under the Department of Agri
culture. Previously the responsibil
ity had been divided between the
Department and the United States
Employment Service.
The department will handle all

operating functions for the importa
tion of farm workers from outside
the country, subject to the policies
of the War Manpower Commission,
and will mobilize and direct the use
of local supplies of labor for agri
culture, including women and young
persons.
State Bills Pending"
Several bills on this subject are
pending in the California legislature,
and will come up for action shortly.
Nationally, the Agricultural Exten
sion Service will be in direct control
of the farm labor, he said. The direc
tor of the service wil also serve on
the staff of the Bureau of Placement
ol the War Manpower Commission.
In addition to attending the con
ferences, Dr. Davis-lectured at Bryn
Mawr on "Nutrition, Economics, and
Public Policy," and at Vassar on
"Wartime Problems of Agriculture."
