# Gershwin Festival Is Big Success
## 
### 
The Gershwin Festival Saturday
in San Francisco, whose orchestra
alone numbered 130. and whose pro
gram packed an audience of 10,000
into two buildings, was, if nothing
else, big.
It's conspicuous shortcoming was
an orchestral overemphasis; for the
plain fact is, there were not more
than three purely instrumental
numbers on the program worth hear
ing twice. The one conspicuous in
congruity was Paul Whiteman's
yard-long baton waving backwards
before the San Francisco symphony -
men.
Bing Crosby, not at all bad on his
"second starter," "Maybe," was sur
prisingly good in "I've Got Plenty o'
Nuttin'." And Dinah Shore's "The
Man I Love," together with the cut
of her gown, was very nearly the hit
of the evening. Jesus Maria San
roma did an incomparable job at the
piano; Edward G. Robinson read the
Eulogy very well; Whiteman's intro
ductions were too gooey; the Robert
Allen Choir had much too small a
part.—Covey
