# H. S. Students Enter Encina
## 
### 
High school seniors from Califor
nia, Oregon, and Washington poured
into Encina yesterday, and began
work this morning on an intensive,
three week's college preparatory
course.
Designed to ready the 30-odd en
rol lees for a full Spring Quarter
program, th e training includes
classes in English, mathematics,
physical education, and wartime
hygiene, effective study methods,
and an introduction to college study.
Professor Arthur Bestor will con
duct the introductory course in col
lege study, while Dean John Bunn
and Dr. Stanley Sharp will take
charge of the course in effective
study methods.
Each subject will be worth one
unit, and a composite grade for the
four courses will be given each stu
dent at the end of the three weeks.
All of the classes meet five times a
week.
The new Encina residents are be
ing placed in rooms vacated by some
80-odd freshmen who have been
called since September. Dr. Sharp
said that most of the rooms will
contain only two students.
