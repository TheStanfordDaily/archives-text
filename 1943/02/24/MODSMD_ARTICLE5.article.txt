# Prom Bids Go On Sale Today
## 
### 
Senior Prom bids are now on sale
at the A.S.S.U. office for the entire
campus. The Prom, a night in Latin
America, will be held Saturday night
from 9 to 1 in the Women's Gym.
The Prom will be a going-away
dance for some 150 seniors who are
graduating at the end of this quar
ter. Several dinner parties before
the dance have been planned.
Decorations will be in fitting with
the South American theme. Jim
Hirst and Jane Armstrong have been
working for the past month on flags
of the South American republics to
be displayed in the Gym.
Gary Nottingham's band with Son
ja Shaw as vocalist will furnish the
music for the affair. Nottingham has
promised that rumbas will not be
in abundance.
Dress for the Prom will be formal.
