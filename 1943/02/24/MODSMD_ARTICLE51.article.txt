# Pares Unveils Russian Myth
## Tuesday Seriesgoers Hear Able Analysis 
### Bill Hornby 
With a precise, experienced pene
tration of Russian history since the
First World War, Sir Bernard Pares
last night erased much of the mis
conception which has cloaked the
i Soviet government from allied pub
! lie opinion, at the same time empha
sizing that the people of Britain and
i America must examine the strong
similarities between Russia and the
democracies if an enduring "people's
peace" is to be formed.
Before 585 Tuesday Evening Se
ries patrons, the short English jour-
J nalist and scholar who has made
Russia his intellectual specialty since
1904 did a historically competent job
of exploding the "bogey" of "world
1 revolution" which still infects cer
j tain portions of allied opinion.
In 192G two lines of thought in the
Russian government, one which be
lieved in international revolution,
j represented by oratorical Leon Trot-
I sky, and the stay-at-home, "So
| cialism in one country" group sym
! bolized by Russia-loving cobbler's
' son, Stalin, came to a showdown.
Trotsky Out
Stalin won. Since that date he has
stuck to two goals, military pre
! paredness and a higher standard of
! life for his people with a driving
I tenacity, facing the rising menace of
the Austrian house pairrter and an
ignorant attitude abroad*
The latter has been propagandized
by both the Trotsky element and the
White Russian group which had lost
bag and baggage in the civil war
after the 1918 Revolution.
"Today,' Pares declared "no one
in Russia would describe their gov
| eminent as communistic." The bo
geys which have clouded our view of
Russia, he declared, arose between
1918 and 1921 when the Marxist suc
cessor to the Rasputanic, dissolving
society of the Tzars attempted to
bring "Christ's kingdom to earth"
by applying the communistic mani
feto to a country for which it was
never intended.
The Bolsheviks stepped into the
gap caused by the total collapse of
the Russian army, began those ex
periments which are most commonly
classed as communistic, extreme col
lectivism, completely non-capital
istic society.
Workers who were to be rewarded
by the each-to-his-ability principle
didn't work. Factory output went
down 84 per cent and the other 1G
per cent was the subject of wide
spread looting.
No one realized the failure of the
"bogeys of 1918-1921" better than the
Russian leaders; in answer they took
a chance with the fiery Trotsky's
imaginary pistol aimed at Germany
and the rest of the world in anemic
defiance—"international revolution."
The ludicrity of this policy was
nowhere more clearly spotlighted
than in the failure of the Third In
ternational Comintern, now de
scribed as a "sideshow" concerned
only with national policy, in pro
moting a general strike in England
in 1925.
Driving Joseph Stalin started on
his way, pushing his internal im
provement plans, building things
like the Dnieper Dam, erecting 96
industrial cities in five years. He
changed a small farm town into a
Pittsburgh that was to become the
hallowed spot of a century, Stalin
grad.
Stalin played a lone game until
the early '30's showing him that the
house painter had to be faced col
lectively. Sincere Maxim Litvinoff
emerged as a champion of collective
security, trying desperately to ex
plain Russia to a democratic world
that listened to "international revo
lution."
Finally Joseph Stalin locked him
self in for » year and a half of mili
tary grace with the Russo-German
treaty, then emerged to achieve what
Pares terms "vindication" in the
stands at the Don and Dneiper.
Today the Russian people have no
bent, historically or psychologically.

Common Bases
They and their taciturn leader
have things in common with demo
cratic peoples—a gift of humor,
language similarities in idiom, per

These things, says Bernard Pares,
must be looked for and realized for
what they are—signposts to a peace
of strength built by a friendly Rus
sia and an understanding democratic
ally.

cessor to the Rasputanic, dissolving
society of the Tzars attempted to
bring "Christ's kingdom to earth"

feto to a country for which it was
never intended.

"bogeys of 1918-1921" better than the

defiance—"international revolution."

society of the Tzars attempted to
bring "Christ's kingdom to earth"
by applying the communistic mani
feto to a country for which it was
never intended.

defiance—"international revolution."
