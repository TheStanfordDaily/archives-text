# One Acts Prove Entertaining
## 
### 
If this were Broadway and I was
| Woolcott Gibbs, there might be some
I justification in panning the Ram's
Head's One-Acts I saw last week
j end. As it is, I am quite happy to
I discover that students at Stanford
■ are capable of producing two really
j good plays and one other that at
worst is as good as 'some of the
things that have been staged in the
j Schubert circuit.
The best play, from an entertain
ment standpoint, was Johnny Law
ry's "A Very Unscrupulous Woman."
| The vehicle was well written and
well acted with Moolie Faris stand
ing out only because of the unusual
j ness of her character, Martha. The
plot was two-fold. In one, a woman
(Janice Shaughnessy) wins back
| her husband (John Lawry), why we
! don't know; and in the other a pro
lessor (Paul Hostetler) wins back
mastery of his own household from
an over-social conscious cook in his
J employ.
Fast Dialogue
The dialogue was fast, funny and
expertly handled.
"The Six of Calais," by Robert
Libbott, was indeed a daring step
for any beginning dramatist to make.
The play was written in blank verse
and used only the experimental as a
style of procedure. This type of play
could have easily fallen flat from its
| own weight. This one didn't, al
j though it is not free from criticism
i either. Gloria Olivi turned in the
best performance of the evening, in
my opinion. Her interpretation of
the lines made the hearer forget the
form in which it was written and
wl% convincing. Doug Hastings, on
the other hand, seems to have a bad
j habit of inflection by which he con
stantly reminds the audience that he
| is an actor and he has memorized
! his lines.
Sliaw-like
The story deals with a village's
attempt to get justice from "the
| conqueror." It ends in a Bernard
] Shaw-like way with the defeat of
I this hope. One walks out of the
theater wondering just what Lib
bott was trying to say and comes to
j the conclusion it is simply this: we
] are fighting a much more treacherous
| conqueror today than ever before.
"Interlude" was at best an average
| Saturday Evening Post story. It
j suffered mostly from the lack of
j actors. With a better portrayal
(apologies here to Malcome Mc
j Kellop, who was fine as Old Jayson)
| this play might ahve developed into
something better. However, as it
J was, a newspaper man in a fever
ridden island meets a guy who
killed his wife and now thinks she
is haunting him. He is somewhat
affected by the heat and a touch of
fever and passes out after drinking
too much. He dreams he sees the
nutty-one's wife. When he comes
to, he decided that the jungle is
getting him and leaves for the States,
i So what?— Jack Oglesby
