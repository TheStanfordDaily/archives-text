In answer to the criticism that the sorority
problem is being presented without consulting
the interested parties — the present sorority
members and the interested alumnae, I should
like to answer that our method of approaching
the problem has not been purposely secretive
or contrary to the wishes of the majority of the
Stanford women.
We have chosen committees who I feel are
representative of the various opinions and who
are women who are familiar with rushing at
Stanford with its peculiarities.
We have worked in small committees because
[ believe that is the only means of accomplish
ing anything. We have kept our committee de
cisions secret because to publish them would
accomplish little other than heated, emotional
discussions and no true solution.
We have willingly accepted any ideas of
tered by the alumnae, and have weighed every
plausible angle and will accordingly submit
two plans to the Board of Trustees. The plans
are not intended as an ultimate solution but
rather to help the Board come to such a solu
tion.
It is true that little has been solved yet —but
direct action has been waiting on the meeting
of the Beard of Trustees tomorrow.
However, I can guarantee one thing to all
people interested. The plans will be printed as
soon as possible and thrown open to the opin
ions of everyone concerned.
The solution will be in accordance with the
wishes of the Stanford women, perhaps through
some kind of a plebiscite.

sororities first developed, The Stanford Daily

where sororities do not exist in hope of help

these letters.)

Dear Sir:
May I reply to your questions about ar
rangements for women's residences at Smith
College as follows:
1. How are the girls for each residence se
lected? Entering students may send us choices
of the houses that they would like and they are
assigned to those houses in the order of their
dates of application for admission to college.
Upperclass students who wish to move from
house to house draw numbers for the order of
choice of rooms. Students move only once dur
ing their college course from house to house.
2. What eating arrangements? We have a
dining room in each house, or group of houses,
which means a dining room for about 60 people.
3. Are some houses considered better than
others? The answer is, no, except when stu
dents here become attached to their houses and
recommend to their friends often to choose those
houses. One year a particular group of houses
may be in special demand, another year another
group.
4. What do the women think of your sys
tem? I think, on the whole, the students seem
well satisfied with housing arrangements.

5. Are there any disadvantages in your sys
tem which might crop up in a coeducational
school? I do not know of any, since our houses
are usually each a pretty good cross section of
the campus.
6. How does your system work? We have
four classes in each house. That means that ap
proximately a quarter of each house is saved
for the entering class and the others are kept on
a pro rata basis. This seems to me a very help
ful part of our system. Because students change
houses only once during their course (relatively
very few avail themselves even of that oppor
tunity), students do become definitely attached
to their houses and live in a relatively continu
ous and friendly group.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Laura W. L. Scales, Warden.

Dear Sir:
Incoming freshmen at Vassar are given their
choice of halls, lising three preferences. Al
though no promise is made that they will get
the hall of their choice, in almost every case it
works out that way. There is no difference in
the charge for board in any of the halls, though
in one hall the girls do more of the housework
and receive a small sum off their total charges.
These girls are the only ones particularly chosen
(by a committee under the Warden, who is in
charge of all residences) on a basis of financial
need. After freshman year the girls are re
quested not to change halls, though on applica
tion and with sufficient reason, it is not hard for
them to do. One building, Main, is reserved for
the entire senior class and a certain number of
freshmen. This tradition will be broken for the
duration because of the irregularities of gradu
ation due to the several acceleration programs.
2. Each hall has its own eating facilities with
students asked to eat in their own halls for
breakfast and luncheon. Incidentally, there are
nine halls in all, four housing about 100 girls
each, three with about 150 each, one with al
most 400 and one completely cooperative
house with 25 girls.
3. There is no particular popularity rule
among the different houses and completely no
selection on the basis of social or racial lines.
4. The system meets with almost unanimous
approval, I should say. We are exceedingly
proud of not having sororities because it seems
to all of us that such a system leads away from
a democratic community and encourages dis
tinctions of a most unpleasant sort. We feel
very strongly about this.
5. I have had no experience at all with any
sort of coeducational system but I have asked
around and it is the consensus that under a
coeducational system there would not be any
important disadvantages. (One suggestion, for
instance, was that rules about meals might be
altered.) Personally, I think the system would
work better with one or two main dining halls.
6. We are proud of our system because it
exists on a completely democratic basis, the
principle objection against sororities. Assum
ing that your residences are all moderately
small, I see no reason why Stanford couldn't
adopt much the same plan. I'm sorry that I
don't know more about your unversity because
I can't offer any concrete suggestions. How
ever, I do want to emphasize that if there is in
terest at Stanford in seeing the end of the soror
ity system there is no better time to put it over
than now, when almost all phases of education
are undergoing enormous changes.

Dear Sir:
May I reply to your questions about ar
rangements for women's residences at Smith
College as follows:
1. How are the girls for each residence se
lected? Entering students may send us choices
of the houses that they would like and they are
assigned to those houses in the order of their
dates of application for admission to college.
Upperclass students who wish to move from
house to house draw numbers for the order of
choice of rooms. Students move only once dur
ing their college course from house to house.
2. What eating arrangements? We have a
dining room in each house, or group of houses,
which means a dining room for about 60 people.
3. Are some houses considered better than
others? The answer is, no, except when stu
dents here become attached to their houses and
recommend to their friends often to choose those
houses. One year a particular group of houses
may be in special demand, another year another
group.
4. What do the women think of your sys
tem? I think, on the whole, the students seem
well satisfied with housing arrangements.

5. Are there any disadvantages in your sys
tem which might crop up in a coeducational
school? I do not know of any, since our houses
are usually each a pretty good cross section of
the campus.
6. How does your system work? We have
four classes in each house. That means that ap
proximately a quarter of each house is saved
for the entering class and the others are kept on
a pro rata basis. This seems to me a very help
ful part of our system. Because students change
houses only once during their course (relatively
very few avail themselves even of that oppor
tunity), students do become definitely attached
to their houses and live in a relatively continu
ous and friendly group.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Laura W. L. Scales, Warden.

Dear Sir:
Incoming freshmen at Vassar are given their
choice of halls, lising three preferences. Al
though no promise is made that they will get
the hall of their choice, in almost every case it
works out that way. There is no difference in
the charge for board in any of the halls, though
in one hall the girls do more of the housework
and receive a small sum off their total charges.
These girls are the only ones particularly chosen
(by a committee under the Warden, who is in
charge of all residences) on a basis of financial
need. After freshman year the girls are re
quested not to change halls, though on applica
tion and with sufficient reason, it is not hard for
them to do. One building, Main, is reserved for
the entire senior class and a certain number of
freshmen. This tradition will be broken for the
duration because of the irregularities of gradu
ation due to the several acceleration programs.
2. Each hall has its own eating facilities with
students asked to eat in their own halls for
breakfast and luncheon. Incidentally, there are
nine halls in all, four housing about 100 girls
each, three with about 150 each, one with al
most 400 and one completely cooperative
house with 25 girls.
3. There is no particular popularity rule
among the different houses and completely no
selection on the basis of social or racial lines.
4. The system meets with almost unanimous
approval, I should say. We are exceedingly
proud of not having sororities because it seems
to all of us that such a system leads away from
a democratic community and encourages dis
tinctions of a most unpleasant sort. We feel
very strongly about this.
5. I have had no experience at all with any
sort of coeducational system but I have asked
around and it is the consensus that under a
coeducational system there would not be any
important disadvantages. (One suggestion, for
instance, was that rules about meals might be
altered.) Personally, I think the system would
work better with one or two main dining halls.
6. We are proud of our system because it
exists on a completely democratic basis, the
principle objection against sororities. Assum
ing that your residences are all moderately
small, I see no reason why Stanford couldn't
adopt much the same plan. I'm sorry that I
don't know more about your unversity because
I can't offer any concrete suggestions. How
ever, I do want to emphasize that if there is in
terest at Stanford in seeing the end of the soror
ity system there is no better time to put it over
than now, when almost all phases of education
are undergoing enormous changes.

In answer to the criticism that the sorority
problem is being presented without consulting
the interested parties — the present sorority
members and the interested alumnae, I should
like to answer that our method of approaching
the problem has not been purposely secretive
or contrary to the wishes of the majority of the
Stanford women.
We have chosen committees who I feel are
representative of the various opinions and who
are women who are familiar with rushing at
Stanford with its peculiarities.
We have worked in small committees because
[ believe that is the only means of accomplish
ing anything. We have kept our committee de
cisions secret because to publish them would
accomplish little other than heated, emotional
discussions and no true solution.
We have willingly accepted any ideas of
tered by the alumnae, and have weighed every
plausible angle and will accordingly submit
two plans to the Board of Trustees. The plans
are not intended as an ultimate solution but
rather to help the Board come to such a solu
tion.
It is true that little has been solved yet —but
direct action has been waiting on the meeting
of the Beard of Trustees tomorrow.
However, I can guarantee one thing to all
people interested. The plans will be printed as
soon as possible and thrown open to the opin
ions of everyone concerned.
The solution will be in accordance with the
wishes of the Stanford women, perhaps through
some kind of a plebiscite.

4. What do the women think of your sys
tem? I think, on the whole, the students seem
well satisfied with housing arrangements.

5. Are there any disadvantages in your sys
tem which might crop up in a coeducational
school? I do not know of any, since our houses
are usually each a pretty good cross section of
the campus.
6. How does your system work? We have
four classes in each house. That means that ap
proximately a quarter of each house is saved
for the entering class and the others are kept on
a pro rata basis. This seems to me a very help
ful part of our system. Because students change
houses only once during their course (relatively
very few avail themselves even of that oppor
tunity), students do become definitely attached
to their houses and live in a relatively continu
ous and friendly group.

Mrs. Laura W. L. Scales, Warden.

Dear Sir:
Incoming freshmen at Vassar are given their
choice of halls, lising three preferences. Al
though no promise is made that they will get
the hall of their choice, in almost every case it
works out that way. There is no difference in
the charge for board in any of the halls, though
in one hall the girls do more of the housework
and receive a small sum off their total charges.
These girls are the only ones particularly chosen
(by a committee under the Warden, who is in
charge of all residences) on a basis of financial
need. After freshman year the girls are re
quested not to change halls, though on applica
tion and with sufficient reason, it is not hard for
them to do. One building, Main, is reserved for
the entire senior class and a certain number of
freshmen. This tradition will be broken for the
duration because of the irregularities of gradu
ation due to the several acceleration programs.
2. Each hall has its own eating facilities with
students asked to eat in their own halls for
breakfast and luncheon. Incidentally, there are
nine halls in all, four housing about 100 girls
each, three with about 150 each, one with al
most 400 and one completely cooperative
house with 25 girls.
3. There is no particular popularity rule
among the different houses and completely no
selection on the basis of social or racial lines.
4. The system meets with almost unanimous
approval, I should say. We are exceedingly
proud of not having sororities because it seems
to all of us that such a system leads away from
a democratic community and encourages dis
tinctions of a most unpleasant sort. We feel
very strongly about this.
5. I have had no experience at all with any
sort of coeducational system but I have asked
around and it is the consensus that under a
coeducational system there would not be any
important disadvantages. (One suggestion, for
instance, was that rules about meals might be
altered.) Personally, I think the system would
work better with one or two main dining halls.
6. We are proud of our system because it
exists on a completely democratic basis, the
principle objection against sororities. Assum
ing that your residences are all moderately
small, I see no reason why Stanford couldn't
adopt much the same plan. I'm sorry that I
don't know more about your unversity because
I can't offer any concrete suggestions. How
ever, I do want to emphasize that if there is in
terest at Stanford in seeing the end of the soror
ity system there is no better time to put it over
than now, when almost all phases of education
are undergoing enormous changes.

In answer to the criticism that the sorority
problem is being presented without consulting
the interested parties — the present sorority
members and the interested alumnae, I should
like to answer that our method of approaching
the problem has not been purposely secretive
or contrary to the wishes of the majority of the
Stanford women.
We have chosen committees who I feel are
representative of the various opinions and who
are women who are familiar with rushing at
Stanford with its peculiarities.
We have worked in small committees because
[ believe that is the only means of accomplish
ing anything. We have kept our committee de
cisions secret because to publish them would
accomplish little other than heated, emotional
discussions and no true solution.
We have willingly accepted any ideas of
tered by the alumnae, and have weighed every
plausible angle and will accordingly submit
two plans to the Board of Trustees. The plans
are not intended as an ultimate solution but
rather to help the Board come to such a solu
tion.
It is true that little has been solved yet —but
direct action has been waiting on the meeting
of the Beard of Trustees tomorrow.
However, I can guarantee one thing to all
people interested. The plans will be printed as
soon as possible and thrown open to the opin
ions of everyone concerned.
The solution will be in accordance with the
wishes of the Stanford women, perhaps through
some kind of a plebiscite.

Dear Sir:
May I reply to your questions about ar
rangements for women's residences at Smith
College as follows:
1. How are the girls for each residence se
lected? Entering students may send us choices
of the houses that they would like and they are
assigned to those houses in the order of their
dates of application for admission to college.
Upperclass students who wish to move from
house to house draw numbers for the order of
choice of rooms. Students move only once dur
ing their college course from house to house.
2. What eating arrangements? We have a
dining room in each house, or group of houses,
which means a dining room for about 60 people.
3. Are some houses considered better than
others? The answer is, no, except when stu
dents here become attached to their houses and
recommend to their friends often to choose those
houses. One year a particular group of houses
may be in special demand, another year another
group.
4. What do the women think of your sys

These girls are the only ones particularly chosen
(by a committee under the Warden, who is in
charge of all residences) on a basis of financial
need. After freshman year the girls are re
quested not to change halls, though on applica
tion and with sufficient reason, it is not hard for
them to do. One building, Main, is reserved for
the entire senior class and a certain number of
freshmen. This tradition will be broken for the
duration because of the irregularities of gradu
ation due to the several acceleration programs.
2. Each hall has its own eating facilities with
students asked to eat in their own halls for
breakfast and luncheon. Incidentally, there are
nine halls in all, four housing about 100 girls
each, three with about 150 each, one with al
most 400 and one completely cooperative
house with 25 girls.
3. There is no particular popularity rule
among the different houses and completely no
selection on the basis of social or racial lines.
4. The system meets with almost unanimous
approval, I should say. We are exceedingly
proud of not having sororities because it seems
to all of us that such a system leads away from
a democratic community and encourages dis
tinctions of a most unpleasant sort. We feel
very strongly about this.
5. I have had no experience at all with any
sort of coeducational system but I have asked
around and it is the consensus that under a
coeducational system there would not be any
important disadvantages. (One suggestion, for
instance, was that rules about meals might be
altered.) Personally, I think the system would
work better with one or two main dining halls.
6. We are proud of our system because it
exists on a completely democratic basis, the
principle objection against sororities. Assum
ing that your residences are all moderately
small, I see no reason why Stanford couldn't
adopt much the same plan. I'm sorry that I
don't know more about your unversity because
I can't offer any concrete suggestions. How
ever, I do want to emphasize that if there is in
terest at Stanford in seeing the end of the soror
ity system there is no better time to put it over
than now, when almost all phases of education
are undergoing enormous changes.

In answer to the criticism that the sorority
problem is being presented without consulting
the interested parties — the present sorority
members and the interested alumnae, I should
like to answer that our method of approaching
the problem has not been purposely secretive
or contrary to the wishes of the majority of the
Stanford women.
We have chosen committees who I feel are
representative of the various opinions and who
are women who are familiar with rushing at
Stanford with its peculiarities.
We have worked in small committees because
[ believe that is the only means of accomplish
ing anything. We have kept our committee de
cisions secret because to publish them would
accomplish little other than heated, emotional
discussions and no true solution.
We have willingly accepted any ideas of
tered by the alumnae, and have weighed every
plausible angle and will accordingly submit
two plans to the Board of Trustees. The plans
are not intended as an ultimate solution but
rather to help the Board come to such a solu
tion.
It is true that little has been solved yet —but
direct action has been waiting on the meeting
of the Beard of Trustees tomorrow.
However, I can guarantee one thing to all
people interested. The plans will be printed as
soon as possible and thrown open to the opin
ions of everyone concerned.
The solution will be in accordance with the
wishes of the Stanford women, perhaps through
some kind of a plebiscite.

sororities first developed, The Stanford Daily
wrote various leading women's colleges
where sororities do not exist in hope of help
ing to find a possible solution. We received
these letters.)

Dear Sir:
May I reply to your questions about ar
rangements for women's residences at Smith
College as follows:
1. How are the girls for each residence se
lected? Entering students may send us choices
of the houses that they would like and they are
assigned to those houses in the order of their
dates of application for admission to college.
Upperclass students who wish to move from
house to house draw numbers for the order of
choice of rooms. Students move only once dur
ing their college course from house to house.
2. What eating arrangements? We have a
dining room in each house, or group of houses,
which means a dining room for about 60 people.
3. Are some houses considered better than
others? The answer is, no, except when stu
dents here become attached to their houses and
recommend to their friends often to choose those
houses. One year a particular group of houses
may be in special demand, another year another
group.
4. What do the women think of your sys
tem? I think, on the whole, the students seem
well satisfied with housing arrangements.

5. Are there any disadvantages in your sys
tem which might crop up in a coeducational
school? I do not know of any, since our houses
are usually each a pretty good cross section of
the campus.
6. How does your system work? We have
four classes in each house. That means that ap
proximately a quarter of each house is saved
for the entering class and the others are kept on
a pro rata basis. This seems to me a very help
ful part of our system. Because students change
houses only once during their course (relatively
very few avail themselves even of that oppor
tunity), students do become definitely attached
to their houses and live in a relatively continu
ous and friendly group.
Sincerely yours,
Mrs. Laura W. L. Scales, Warden.

Dear Sir:
Incoming freshmen at Vassar are given their
choice of halls, lising three preferences. Al
though no promise is made that they will get
the hall of their choice, in almost every case it
works out that way. There is no difference in
the charge for board in any of the halls, though
in one hall the girls do more of the housework
and receive a small sum off their total charges.
These girls are the only ones particularly chosen
(by a committee under the Warden, who is in
charge of all residences) on a basis of financial
need. After freshman year the girls are re
quested not to change halls, though on applica
tion and with sufficient reason, it is not hard for
them to do. One building, Main, is reserved for
the entire senior class and a certain number of
freshmen. This tradition will be broken for the
duration because of the irregularities of gradu
ation due to the several acceleration programs.

breakfast and luncheon. Incidentally, there are
nine halls in all, four housing about 100 girls
each, three with about 150 each, one with al
most 400 and one completely cooperative
house with 25 girls.

among the different houses and completely no
