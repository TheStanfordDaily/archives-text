### 
Dinner plus the chance to win four j
! $18.75 War Bonds will be served up
! to members of the Class of '44 at an
i informal dinner Friday, Feb. 26, in
| the Women's Clubhouse.
"You can't lose, it's a give-away,"
| said Ferris Boothe, junior class pres- j
ident, in announcing the dinner. Ad
i mission to the affair is 55 cents per '
I cerson, which will be used to buy j
I four of five bonds to be given away !
! as door prizes.
"Our chief object in giving the
! dinner is to get the junior class to- 1
I gether for a real class party before
we break up. The Class of '44 won't
have a senior year together, many
will be gone for our Junior Prom
next quarter, so we hope everyone
can attend this dinner," said Helen
Campbell, general chairman for the
; affair.
Sign-ups are being conducted in
! campus living groups for all juniors
wishing to attend the dinner. Any
j living group, containing any mem
| bers of the junior class, which did
! not have a sign-up yesterday, should
; call Johnny Twitehell, ticket chair
! man, today.
The Food Committee, under the
direction oi Janet McClanahan, must
know the number which will come
to the party early this afternoon in
order to make final arrangements, j
I "We can promise you an excellent I
j dinner," Miss McClanahan said.
"It's an informal, no-date junior
get-together. Every junior on cam- I
pus is welcome to come," added Miss |
! Campbell. "And you may win a I
valuable War Bond."
