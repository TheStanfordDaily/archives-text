# WAR BOARD
## Yost Speaks On War Work 
### 
Speaking at the regular meeting of
the War Boai-d Auxiliary yesterday,
Dean Mary Yost stressed the im
portance of Stanford women par
ticipating in War Work on campus.
She said girls have no right to be
at Stanford with the advantage of
prolonged training instead of work
ing in factories, unless they do what
they can to aid the war.
What each individual woman does !
or doesn't do has a real effect upon
the war. War Board activities aren't
just games; they are a vital part of
our war effort. Girls going to school
must not lose sight of the real in- j
ternational issues at stake.
Record Poor
Dean Yost expressed disappoint
ment at the slowness with which !
students have begun to realize things
can not be added to life without sub
tracting some of the immediate
pleasures. Each student must make
some sacrifice to help the war effort.
Dean Yost said, "It is the responsi
bility of every woman on campus to
ask herself if she is giving 2 to 4
hours a week to war work. If not, j
why not? Everyone is needed to j
help."
Miss Yost pointed out that one of j
! the greatest needs on campus is in |
j the surgical dressing workroom. The j
| nation is far behind in its quota, and !
i the lives of many men depend on
having these surgical bandages, s
Many more Stanford girls are needed
|to help. The whole responsibility
for conducting Red Cross affairs de- i
pends on every woman of America.
Current Affairs
Stanford women should keep up j
j with current affairs so they can re
j alize the importance of the condi
j lion in which we now are.
The War Board Auxiliary consists
i of representatives from every wom
[ :in's living group. It meets once a
j week to discuss War Board projects
and keep the living groups informed
j on (he various ways they can par- j
ticipate in War Board activities.
