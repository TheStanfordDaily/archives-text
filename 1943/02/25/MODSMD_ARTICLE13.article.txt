# Nazis Refuse to Fight Farm Grad in Tunisia
## 
### 
Over in Tunisia with Eisenhower, I
a former Stanford medical student, j
Lieut. Truman O. Boyd, is plenty
peeved because the Nazis won't come
out and fight man-to-man.
Boyd set fire to his three light
tanks to save them from capture
after a running fight with six Ger- j
man Mark IV's and then hiked with
his men, zig-zag fashion, 35 miles
through enemy lines.
"We were withdrawing," he said,
"firing all the time as we kept mov
ing from them. But they could stay
out of our reach and still slug at us
and it was hopeless for us to try to
close with them in view of the odds
in their favor.
"Finally they pressed us back
against a mountain. We dropped
into a wash, hoping that relief would
come. Soon I saw that the situation
was beyond help—that none of our
heavier tanks could get through to
support us—and it then became nec
essary to get our men out.
"To prevent our tanks falling into
j enemy hands, we had to put them
I afire with thermite grenades. I
never in my life hated to do any-
J thing worse. As soon as they were
burning we started out on a 30-mile
[ march across country.
"I got all my men safely home
j and on the way in picked up 14
j other soldiers who had become sep
arated from their units during the
! battle.
j "Some day, somewhere, we are
going to run into Jerries on a man-
I to-man basis and when we do . . ."

Tory families in Boston painted black
borders around the chimneys of
their houses. The custom persists
among their descendants today.
