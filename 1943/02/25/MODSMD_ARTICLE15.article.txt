LONDON, Feb. 24 (UP). —Adolph Hitler said tonight that he intended
to force occupied countries to join in the German war effort on a scale
unprecedented in history and that he would not spare foreign lives in
a struggle which was costing many German lives.
Hitler's statement was made in a message to the Nazi party on the

► anniversary of its foundation. The
message was read for him because,
it was explained, he could not leave
the eastern front.
"We shall consider it a matter of
course not to spare foreign lives at
a time which is demanding great
sacrifices of our own lives," he
stated.
He hinted at subversive forces
working in Germany, as Paul Jo
| seph Goebbels, propaganda minis-
I ter, had done previously.
