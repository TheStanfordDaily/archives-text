## Casablanca's Cast Capital 
### 
CASABLANCA, playing at the
Stanford.
We shall now leap overboard.
"Casablanca" and Ingrid Bergman
are stupendous.
"Casablanca" luckily cashes in on
the African invasion, but fortunately
was not produced for that function;
it therefore bears none of the de
fects of a film made in haste and
slushy patriotism its theme.
Without such defects, it is pos
sessed of the special assets of fine
production. Its flavor of seaport in
trigue is something akin to "Al
giers," though unrelated in plot.
Like "Algiers," however, it captures
a fundamental longing of a fugitive
or refugee for a once-gay existence
in another land; and therein prob
ably lies its greatness as a moving
picture.
But a particular singularity is its
cast, which is of the screen's un
excelled . . . Paul Henreid, Claude
Rains, Peter Lorre, Conrad Veidt,
Humphrey Bogart. Ingrid Bergman.
It has also got Michael Curtiz' di
rection and a Max Steiner score.
In short, everything it has got is
good. Everything Ingrid Bergman
has got is good.â€”Covey

Blair Hyde, who was graduated
from Stanford in 1941, has received
