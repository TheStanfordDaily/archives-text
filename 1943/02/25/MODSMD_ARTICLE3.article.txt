# WAR FUND DRIVE
## Eight More Groups Pledge 100 Per Cent to Red Cross Fund 
### 
With eight more campus groups j
pledging 100 per cent. Stanford's j
Red Cross War Fund drive yester- |
day shifted into high gear and j
really began to roll up the total |
which the chairman of the drive. 1
Miriam King, expects to make $3000
by Saturday evening.
The eight living and or eating !
groups to contribute one dollar per j
person were El Campo, El Capitan.
El Toro, Kappa Kappa Gamma. ;
A.K.L., Alpha Sig, De!t. and Zeta
Psi.

The Palo Alto chapter of the
Red Cross, in conjunction with
Stanford's Y.W.C.A. and War
Board, has opened a new room in
the Women's Clubhouse in which
surgical dressings are now being
made. The step was taken be
cause of the popularity of the
original room.
Stanford's quota is now 1000
dressings a day. The rooms are
open from 1 to 5 p.m. every week
day and from 10 to 12 sum. on
Saturday.
There were 40 workers at the
Red Cross Workroom yesterday.
They rolled 1,012 surgical band
ages.

In addition, according to Drive
Chairman King, "a steady stream
of contributions has been coming
from Roble, Lagunita, and the Un
ion Unit." Miss King also stated
that "the smallest amount of money
has been turned in by the men's
halls thus far" but that "this is
probably due to the fact that they
have not as yet been canvassed as
thoroughly as the rest of the cam
pus."

This year's Red Cross War Fund
drive is a national campaign de
signed primarily to raise funds for
the relief of men in America's
armed forces.
According to National Red Cross
Chairman Norman H. Davis, this
drive is planned to collect 130 mil
lion dollars, 80 million of which will
go to the organization's national
headquarters for use almost ex
clusively with American servicemen
in the United States and overseas,
while the remaining 50 million will
be distributed to the Red Cross's
I local chapters throughout the coun
| fry-
Mr. Davis has also emphasized
that this is a campaign which is
primarily for funds and not for
membership, although all persons
ontributing a dollar or more to the
drive automatically become Red
Cross members.

Red Cross War Fund drive yester- |
day shifted into high gear and j
really began to roll up the total |
which the chairman of the drive. 1
Miriam King, expects to make $3000
by Saturday evening.
The eight living and or eating !
groups to contribute one dollar per j
person were El Campo, El Capitan.
El Toro, Kappa Kappa Gamma. ;
A.K.L., Alpha Sig, De!t. and Zeta
Psi.

The Palo Alto chapter of the
Red Cross, in conjunction with
Stanford's Y.W.C.A. and War
Board, has opened a new room in
the Women's Clubhouse in which
surgical dressings are now being
made. The step was taken be
cause of the popularity of the
original room.
Stanford's quota is now 1000
dressings a day. The rooms are
open from 1 to 5 p.m. every week
day and from 10 to 12 sum. on
Saturday.
There were 40 workers at the
Red Cross Workroom yesterday.
They rolled 1,012 surgical band
ages.

In addition, according to Drive
Chairman King, "a steady stream
of contributions has been coming
from Roble, Lagunita, and the Un
ion Unit." Miss King also stated
that "the smallest amount of money
has been turned in by the men's
halls thus far" but that "this is
probably due to the fact that they
have not as yet been canvassed as
thoroughly as the rest of the cam
pus."

This year's Red Cross War Fund
drive is a national campaign de
signed primarily to raise funds for
the relief of men in America's
armed forces.
According to National Red Cross
Chairman Norman H. Davis, this
drive is planned to collect 130 mil
lion dollars, 80 million of which will
go to the organization's national
headquarters for use almost ex
clusively with American servicemen
in the United States and overseas,
while the remaining 50 million will
be distributed to the Red Cross's
I local chapters throughout the coun
| fry-
Mr. Davis has also emphasized
that this is a campaign which is
primarily for funds and not for
membership, although all persons
ontributing a dollar or more to the
drive automatically become Red
Cross members.
