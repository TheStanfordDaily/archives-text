Costume crews have been work
ing virtual miracles in the Memorial
Theater workshop these past few
weeks, anticipating the March 4, 5,
and G production of Gilbert and
Sullivan's comic opera, "The Gon
doliers."
Brilliant costumes graced the
chorus last night as rehearsals for
the show continued in full swing
and song.
Peasant skirts of purple, gold, tur
quoise, and maroon trimmed with
flowered *black bands, and starched
lace blouses and caps are the girls'
costumes. Men in the chorus ap
peared in trousers matching the girls'
skirts and boleros painted with with
bright flowers.
28 (Jiris, 14 Boys
All the chorus costumes, enough
lor 28 girls and 14 men with singing
parts and 7 girls and 4 men in danc
ing parts, have been made by Muriel
Lievsay with the assistance of the
costuming class composed of Marcia
Shaughnessy, Katherine Gill, and
Gloria Olivi.
Although the materials used seem
laviohly rich and extravagant, all
the girls' chorus skirts have been
made from reclaimed materials which
have been bleached and redyed the
desiied colors. The war has made
yardage expensive and hard to ob
tain, according to Mrs. Lievsay.
Luxurious Raiment#
Even more impressive are the lux
urious raiment of the group of
Spanish courtiers.
Gowns and men's coats of heavy
turquoise taffeta, blue silk trimmed
in roses, burgundy brocade, rose and
gold metal cloth, and black, laven
der, and silver satin hang in the cos
tume room waiting for the group of
four women and five men who take
leads in "The Gondoliers" as Vene
tian nobility.
Hazel Brain and Mary Lou Lind
sley have created these 18th cen
tury costumes.
Many of the costumes have been
trimmed with hand-painted flowers
and designs, on which students
worked long hours.
