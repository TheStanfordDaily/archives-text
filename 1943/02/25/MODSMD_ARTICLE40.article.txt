## Indians, UCLA Go Tomorrow 
### Ed Luce 
Tomorrow night's cage festival
opening at (5:15 with a clash between
the Stanford Frosh and Menlo J.C.,
followed by the varsity "croosh" be
tween the Deanmen and U.C.L.A.
is all that's in the offing for cage fans
this weekend.
The Uclan-Indian affair should be
the outstanding affair of the year
from the standpoint of speed and
scoring, besides deciding quite a few
things as far as the Southern Divi
sion cage race is concerned.
If the Cards spring an upset, U.C.
L.A. will be eliminated from title
contention and might well end up
no better than third, providing Stan
ford wins its two remaining games
with Cal. â€¢
U.C.L.A.'s Chance
A Bruin win, on the other hand,
would give the Southern Branch an
edge over the Indians for the first
time in several years, besides keep
ing the Uclans within mathematical
reach of U.S.C.'s unbeaten Trojans.
U.C.L.A. is perhaps the only squad
Stanford has met all season which
could match the Indians on the back
boards. Colored center Don Barks
dale and forward Marvin Lee both
scale () feet 4 inches, while sharp
shooting guard Don Perry is G ieet
2 inches, and Dick West and Ainsley
Bell, the other two first stringers,
nudge (') feet.
Dean Lineup
Dean's lineup will be the same that
opened both of the games down
South: P'reddie Linari and Jack
Dana at forwards; Ed Voss at cen
ter; and Howie Dallmar and Bill
Hooper at guards. Only Linari, with
a wrapped-up knee, is not in lop
shape.
The Cards ran through their first
practice of the week yesterday, con
centrating on shooting and a few
end plans in regard to floor play.
Following the shooting drill, the
team held a short scrimmage in
which all the reserves participated.
Dean plans to give the boys only a
small workout this afternoon.
Frosh Plans
Frosh Mentor Woody Weir still
does not know when the Paly High
game, originally scheduled for this
afternoon, will be played. Latest
word had it the game might come
off tomorrow afternoon against the
Papeese reserves.
The freshmen shouldn't have any
trouble with Menlo tomorrow night.
The junior college squad has already
been routed twice this season by the
Papeese.
