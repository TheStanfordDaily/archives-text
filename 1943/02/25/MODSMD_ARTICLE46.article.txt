.1 young Americans are fighting and dying
for the future freedom of the world—freedom
of speech, freedom of worship, and freedom to
have a say in the government.
Yet many of these same young Americans
are not free to vote and express themselves on
governmental matters. They have no franchise.
With the 'teen-age draft a three-year age
group of the American people has been taken
away, out of circulation.
Before the 'teen-age draft an individual was
a mere child until he became 21 and as a child
he could act and think. But now at 18 a man
becomes an adult and into the harsh adult
world of strife and of death he steps.
If an 18-year-old man is old enough to fight
tor his country and old enough to die for his
country, he should be old enough to vote and
>o help run his country.
Like so many sheep should they be herded
into the Army without voice as to who should
be their Commander-in-Chief? Why is it that
if they are old enough to fight, to bleed, to
suffer, and to die, they are not old enough to
assume maturity legally?
