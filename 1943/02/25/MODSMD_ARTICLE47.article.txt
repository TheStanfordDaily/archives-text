Dear Al:
For the past month I have been working for
the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Red
Cross. Working for this organization is an ex
perience that I shall always cherish. Never
before have I seen such a spirit of devotion and
energy of workers toward their job ... a job
which spreads so much good to all parts of
the world at a time when the world really needs
a little kindness. . . .
In my work, I have had the opportunity to
view every phase of Red Cross activities. I've
seen the faces of wounded and sick soldiers
light up as they receive some kindness ... a
gift or entertainment donated by the Red Cross.
I've seen women of the Red Cross spend hours
reading or writing letters for men who are now
blind or crippled for life.
I've seen the expression of relief on a moth
er's face after the Red Cross has devoted weeks
in tracing and finding the whereabouts of her
son reported missing in action. Soldiers on
lonely outposts on night duty get a little fun
out of the Red Cross nightly canteen service.
.Movie stars side by side with shipyard workers
donate their blood at the Red Cross blood bank.
And even Mrs. Dillingham 111, who never be
fore in her life had lifted her little finger to do
an ounce of work, has joined the Motor Corps
and gets down on her hands and knees in the
mud to change the tire of an Army truck. . . .
Red Cross activities don't stop at home. Ev
ery day hundreds of cartons of food, clothing,
books, and magazines are sent to soldiers and
sailors in foreign outposts and to our boys in
enemy prison camps through the International
Red Cross at Geneva. Thousands of Red Cross
nurses have been trained and recruited for duty
with the Army and Navy. American Red Cross
services in England and Ireland were so suc
cessful that General Eisenhower asked for hun
dreds of Red Cross service clubs and canteens

to be established throughout North Africa. Units
are being established in Alaska, China, India,
and in the South Pacific. Their success is re
vealed by the comments of the men who have
come back from those posts. . . .

And the workers of the Red Cross . . . big
time business executives, famous lawyers, doc
tors, and our President Franklin Roosevelt who
is also President of the American Red Cross,
devote hours of their time to organizing and
planning the Red Cross program. There are
no politics; there is no bickering. The job is
done guickly and efficiently by devoted and
intelligent people. . . .

I wish that every Stanford student could see
the Red Cross in action. I wish that they could
know of the many lives that have been saved
and of the morales which have been uplifted
due to the quick and kind action of the Red
Cross. And I hope that in their War Fund
Drive this week they will give everything they
possibly can with the realization that every cent
will be put into action to help win the war
quickly and, especially, to help keep that spark
of kindness alive above every hatred after this
war is won.

come back from those posts. . . .

And the workers of the Red Cross . . . big
time business executives, famous lawyers, doc
tors, and our President Franklin Roosevelt who
is also President of the American Red Cross,
devote hours of their time to organizing and

no politics; there is no bickering. The job is
done guickly and efficiently by devoted and
intelligent people. . . .

I wish that every Stanford student could see
the Red Cross in action. I wish that they could
know of the many lives that have been saved
and of the morales which have been uplifted
due to the quick and kind action of the Red
Cross. And I hope that in their War Fund
Drive this week they will give everything they
possibly can with the realization that every cent
will be put into action to help win the war
quickly and, especially, to help keep that spark
of kindness alive above every hatred after this
war is won.

Dear Al:
For the past month I have been working for
the Los Angeles Chapter of the American Red
Cross. Working for this organization is an ex
perience that I shall always cherish. Never
before have I seen such a spirit of devotion and
energy of workers toward their job ... a job
which spreads so much good to all parts of
the world at a time when the world really needs
a little kindness. . . .
In my work, I have had the opportunity to
view every phase of Red Cross activities. I've
seen the faces of wounded and sick soldiers
light up as they receive some kindness ... a
gift or entertainment donated by the Red Cross.
I've seen women of the Red Cross spend hours
reading or writing letters for men who are now
blind or crippled for life.
I've seen the expression of relief on a moth
er's face after the Red Cross has devoted weeks
in tracing and finding the whereabouts of her
son reported missing in action. Soldiers on
lonely outposts on night duty get a little fun
out of the Red Cross nightly canteen service.
.Movie stars side by side with shipyard workers
donate their blood at the Red Cross blood bank.
And even Mrs. Dillingham 111, who never be
fore in her life had lifted her little finger to do
an ounce of work, has joined the Motor Corps
and gets down on her hands and knees in the
mud to change the tire of an Army truck. . . .
Red Cross activities don't stop at home. Ev
ery day hundreds of cartons of food, clothing,
books, and magazines are sent to soldiers and
sailors in foreign outposts and to our boys in
enemy prison camps through the International
Red Cross at Geneva. Thousands of Red Cross
nurses have been trained and recruited for duty
with the Army and Navy. American Red Cross
services in England and Ireland were so suc
cessful that General Eisenhower asked for hun
dreds of Red Cross service clubs and canteens

to be established throughout North Africa. Units
are being established in Alaska, China, India,
and in the South Pacific. Their success is re
vealed by the comments of the men who have
come back from those posts. . . .
