# OUR HASHER SEZ

### 
As we walked down the steps into the Cellar
we could see Mr. Strauss waltzing around be
hind the self-service counter singing that old
Austrian ballad, "It'll be ready in a few minutes.
After all, I only have two hands." (A hasty
glance told us that he was telling the truth.)
When our turn came —as it inevitably will by
the law of crowding in front of someone else —
we gently asked for a piece of apple pie a la
mode. He answered to the effect that they did
not sell apple pie a la mode any more, but he
hastily added that we could buy a piece of apple
pie and a dish of ice cream, and then when he
turned his back we could throw them together.
To this some anarchistic rabble-rouser three
or four tiers back in the crowd mumbled some
thing about profiteering and letting Leon Hen
derson know about it. The seething crowd
pushed this ruffian to the fore until he stood
face to face with Mr. Strauss, who had slowed
his waltz down to a slow swaying back and
forth.
"See here, my man, v/hy do you no longer
sell apple pie a la mode?" This remark the
orator threw in the face of the waltzer.
Strauss replied simply and to the point, "We
are only allowed so much ice cream and this
is a way of cutting down." Remember that
line " —this is a way of cutting down," because
it figures importantly later in the conversation.
"Are you sure it's not just a way of charging
more for apple pie a la mode?"
"Well, certainly we have to charge more.
Look, we are giving you a bigger scoop of ice
cream in the dish than used to sit on ihe pie,"
retorted the Waitz King, who had by now
ceased all pedal motion.
Aha—we had him there. "We" being the
rabble-rouser, ourselves, and the large crowd
which had gathered around by this time. Yes,
we had him there in a complete contradiction.
He first stated that this measure was taken to
save ice cream, and then he admits that ihey
use even more ice cream on a concoction he,
himself, suggested.
There was a moment of silence while the
crowd thought this whole thing over, then, as a
body, they leaped over the self-service counter
and grabbed Strauss. After a short squabble as
to whether tar-and-feathers or syrup-and-bear
claw would be a better punishment, the crowd,
led by the rabble-rousing demagogue, shoved
Strauss into the ice cream freezer. As they
pushed the lid down we could see the Waltz
King's feet moving in a jerky circular motion in
the ice cream. He was obviously trying to
waltz his way out.
Moral: Don't order chocolate swirl ice cream
in the Cellar. You can't tell whose feet mixed
it.
