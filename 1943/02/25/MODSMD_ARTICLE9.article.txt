# SENIOR PROM
## 'Most Colorful Ever' Dance Promised by From Chairman 
### 
"One of the most colorful dances ever to be given at Stanford."
That is the promise of decorations chairmen Jim Hirst and Jane Arm- j
strong for the Senior Prom to be held Saturday night in the Women's Gym !
from 9 to 1.
Hirst and his committee have planned novel decorations which will

(it in with the natural setting of the
Gym. The theme, "A Night in Latin •
America," will be carried out from |
the refreshment stand to the band- |
stand. Even the bids and publicity !
signs are splashed with brilliant
colors.
Sonja Again
In keeping with the campus policy !
bf signing no "big name" bands, the j
seniors have contracted Gary Not
tingham, the biggest little name band
in the business. As an added starter,
Nottingham will bring Sonja Shaw,
noted singer for N.B.C. who appeared
for last year's Senior Prom and for
this season's Sophomore Cotillion.
Nottingham has played for the
Big Game dances and other campus ■
dances from time to time. He won j
fame and popularity by his extended j
stay at the Bal Tabarin in San Fran
cisco. Recently he has been on the
hotel circuit, playing in some of the j
best amusement centers in the ;
country.
Last Dance
The Prom will be the last all
cam pus dance for several hundred j
students who are leaving via the |
graduation route or by reserve call, j
In their honor private dinners will
be given by several organizations be- j
fore the dance. Scabbard and j
Blade, to mention but one, will hold
a dinner at L'Omelette. The Prom
committee tried to arrange an all- i
senior dinner but met many ob- !
stacles, so it was decided to en- j
courage private affairs.
Few Bids Left
There are just a few bids left for
students at the A.S.S.U. office
In the past crowds have detracted
from the enjoyment of campus
dances; so only a limited number of
bids has been placed on sale at $3
per couple.
