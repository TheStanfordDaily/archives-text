speakers of the institution.

negative side of the question, '"Re- |
solved, that at the end of this war, j
the United Nations should establish '
a permanent world federation," will i
be presented with the Delta Sigma j
Rho plaque.
Debate To Be Recorded
The debate next Sunday will be
held in front of the night class ol
the prison school and will be re
corded for broadcast later over a
local station and to the inmates in
their cells.
''The competition is always keen,
as the San Qvientin team is usually
composed of "retired" lawyers, and
in previous years they have always
won. possibly because the decision
is made by vote of the audience,"
said Jim Frolik, varsity debate man
ager.
To Tour Grounds
Before the debate the Stanford
representatives will be taken on a
tour of the grounds and have dinner
with the warden.
The Delta Sigma Rho tournament
started two weeks ago when tryouts
for entry were open to the general
student body. A series of elimina
tion rounds were tabulated, and
at the end of the third round the
results were tabulated, and those
teams which had won two out of
three debates entered the first round
of the semi-finals. Four teams con
tested in the semi's, and yesterday
those two with the highest accumu
lative scores contested in the final
debate of the tournament.
Judges for this debate included
Dr. Harold Bradley, Professor James
Gordon Emerson, Jim Frolik. Ty
Harmsen, Shandra Saksenna, Vir
ginia Schratz, Bob Libott, Leonard
Low, Mervyn Lisicieki, and Ted Eb
erle.
