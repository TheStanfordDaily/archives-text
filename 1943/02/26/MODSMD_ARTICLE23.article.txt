## Motor Bureau Reports Delay 
### 
The Department of Motor Vehicles
in Sacramento today admonished
motorists not to be alarmed if their
1943 vehicle license tabs and regis
tration cards do not arrive promptly.
The admonition was issued with a
special request that motorists re
frain from writing letters about
their tabs and cards.
Director Gordon H. Garland esti
mated that close to a million appli
cations were received in Sacramento
alone by mail during the last 10 days
of the renewal season which ended
| Feb. 4. Much of this mail, he said,
has not yet even been opened and
cannot be sorted and sent to the
right bureaus for processing for sev
eral weeks.
Moreover, the manufacturer of the
tabs probably will not have deliv
ered all of them until close to the
end of March.
