# Knickerbocker Trails A.E.F. From Hawaii to North Africa
## 
### Noel Young 
Since he hopped the first convoy
-) Pearl Harbor soon after Dec. 7,
I. R. Knickerbocker has been on
tie heels of the A.E.F., highlighted
y his landing with the Yanks in
forth Africa.
With a typewriter strung around
is neck, hip-deep in African surf,
Knickerbocker told a capacity crowd
I Memorial Hall last night of his
xperiences with the Allied forces
ispersing from a 850-ship convoy
n a beach near Oran.
He told of the flowing tears, the
isses and the V-raised hands that
welcomed American soldiers as they
rooped into Oran, after losing 850
len.
He told how the Allied diplomacy
/:th Darlan, and the resulting
cease firing" order to French troops
aved perhaps hundreds of thousands
•f American lives and a war pro
mgation of years that may have oc
urred if the American campaign
ailed.
iommel "Withdrew"
And he doused cold water on heat
d headlines that heralded the flee
ng army of Rommel from Libya, by
declaring that Rommel performed
>ne of history's most masterly with
irawals. The German general has
H'cn able to bring the bulk of his
oldiers into Tunisia, where they
lave consolidated and rearmed with
rmaments from Sicily and are now
trong enough to attempt offensive

operations.
One of the big plusses for Germany
is the proximity of their Sicilian
base, where German transport planes
can take off and deliver the goods to
Von Arnim's forces in a 20-minute
flight. This, compared to America's
supply line, where it takes. U.S
planes six days to fly materiel to
African forces from Detroit assembly
lines.

American Troops "Green''
Knickerbocker described the whole
Tunisian situation as "a bunch of
trained amateurs up against the
world's best professionals." Admit
ting that American troops are green,
Knickerbocker held high hopes by
saying, "on our side is youth!"
In New Guinea. Knickerbocker
recounted effects of one of the Japs'
most lethal weapons—psychology. In
Bataan, the Japs would unleash a
deafening barrage on Filipino troops
during the night. Suddenly, near 3
a.m., the front lines would snap into
dead silence, and then several
thousand Jap soldiers would chorus,
. "Now, you're about to die," over
and over again while the Filipino
soldiers would shrink instinctively
close to their officers.
But the fanatical Japs used more
than psychology. Before an attack,
an army usually liquidates its own
mines with artillery fire, but not the
Japs. A suicide squad sweeps out
over the mine field, each soldier set
ting off a mine. Then, with shrieks
of "Banzai!", a second suicide squad
falls across barbed-wire entangle
ments, forming a lifeless blanket for
the combat troops.
Knickerbocker told the story of
the momentous fall of the French
African city of Arzew soon after the
American landing. Knickerbocker
and three doughboys were dispatched
to capture Arzew, where a reputed
"army" was garrisoned.
