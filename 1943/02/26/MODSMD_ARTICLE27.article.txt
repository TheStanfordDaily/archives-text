# Large Demand, Small Supply Are Problems of Local Store
## 
### 
Like every other store, Penney's is having trouble in obtaining goods,
while the demand for such goods has increased, according to Mr. Vander
Pool, general manager of the Palo Alto branch.
"Most of the articles are 'unavailable from the manufacturer'," he con
tinued. "which means that for the duration of the war that article will not

fbe made.
Sheets, for instance, are now un
obtainable. The armed services are
taking the entire output of the mills
of all sheets except 'seconds.' Stores
may order these, but the order will
not be tilled unless accompanied by
an order from a hospital for the same
quantity of sheets.
"Pins and needles have been 'tem
porarily discontinued.' Metal toys
have been replaced by wooden or
plastic toys.
Some materials, such as marqui
t settes and nets, have been declared
non-essential' and their manufac
turing has been stopped for duration
of the war. Lunch boxes have also
been discontinued.
"Not only is it difficult to obtain
goods, but it is also difficult to get
delivery of such goods as are avail
able, Mr. Vander Pool continued.
Delivery Schedule
"Today a shipment of blankets or
dered last March was delivered. An
other shipment of leather gloves, or
dered in April, was also delivered.
I am now ordering goods for next
winter.
"Orders are sent to our home of
fice. The buyers do their best to
lill them, and if it is impossible to
do so at once the order is retained
on the chance that the goods might
become available at some time.
What this system amounts to,"
lie said, "is that we are sent what
ever is available, when it is avail
able, and under the present condi
tons, we are very glad to receive it.
"We can't help remembering, how
ever, the pre-war years when we
used to be able to order as many
pairs of silk stockings, for instance,
as we wanted.
"The demand for wash goods has
increased 30 per cent this year. In
December our order was equal to
that normally placed during the
whole first five months of the year.
In contrast to this, however, the
supply has been cut 25 per cent from
the normal.
"All of the stocks which our buy
ers were able to obtain, plus the
stocks which our store had on hand
have been allotted. No new orders
are being accepted.
Rubber Boots
"Rubber boots are more strictly
rationed than shoes. It is necessary
to have- an order permitting you to ;
buy the boots before a sale may be
made. The store is allowed to buy
only one pair to replace each pair
that they sell. The old boot s must
be turned in at the same time so
that the rubber on them may be re
claimed.
"As our part in the war effort we
collect silk stockjngs and wool scraps
for the Red Cross. We are one of
the largest sellers of War Stamps
and bonds in Palo Alto, and Penney's
is signed up 100 per cent on the pay
roll deduction plan.
"We have lost all of our men but
one, due to the war. The remaining
man is the assistant manager,"

Rubber Boots
"Rubber boots are more strictly
rationed than shoes. It is necessary
to have- an order permitting you to ;
buy the boots before a sale may be
made. The store is allowed to buy
only one pair to replace each pair
that they sell. The old boot s must
be turned in at the same time so
that the rubber on them may be re
claimed.
"As our part in the war effort we
collect silk stockjngs and wool scraps
for the Red Cross. We are one of
the largest sellers of War Stamps
and bonds in Palo Alto, and Penney's
is signed up 100 per cent on the pay
roll deduction plan.
"We have lost all of our men but
one, due to the war. The remaining
man is the assistant manager,"

The Great Wall of China i.s over
1,500 miles long.
Like every other store, Penney's is having trouble in obtaining goods,
while the demand for such goods has increased, according to Mr. Vander
Pool, general manager of the Palo Alto branch.
"Most of the articles are 'unavailable from the manufacturer'," he con
tinued. "which means that for the duration of the war that article will not

fbe made.
Sheets, for instance, are now un
obtainable. The armed services are
taking the entire output of the mills
of all sheets except 'seconds.' Stores
may order these, but the order will
not be tilled unless accompanied by
an order from a hospital for the same
quantity of sheets.
"Pins and needles have been 'tem
porarily discontinued.' Metal toys
have been replaced by wooden or
plastic toys.
Some materials, such as marqui
t settes and nets, have been declared
non-essential' and their manufac
turing has been stopped for duration
of the war. Lunch boxes have also
been discontinued.
"Not only is it difficult to obtain
goods, but it is also difficult to get
delivery of such goods as are avail
able, Mr. Vander Pool continued.
Delivery Schedule
"Today a shipment of blankets or
dered last March was delivered. An
other shipment of leather gloves, or
dered in April, was also delivered.
I am now ordering goods for next
winter.
"Orders are sent to our home of
fice. The buyers do their best to
lill them, and if it is impossible to
do so at once the order is retained
on the chance that the goods might
become available at some time.
What this system amounts to,"
lie said, "is that we are sent what
ever is available, when it is avail
able, and under the present condi
tons, we are very glad to receive it.
"We can't help remembering, how
ever, the pre-war years when we
used to be able to order as many
pairs of silk stockings, for instance,
as we wanted.
"The demand for wash goods has
increased 30 per cent this year. In
December our order was equal to
that normally placed during the
whole first five months of the year.
In contrast to this, however, the
supply has been cut 25 per cent from
the normal.
"All of the stocks which our buy
ers were able to obtain, plus the
stocks which our store had on hand
have been allotted. No new orders
are being accepted.
