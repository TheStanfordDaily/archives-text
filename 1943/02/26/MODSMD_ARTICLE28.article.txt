# Kessler Chosen For Cal Debate
## Speakers to Try Out For Remaining Post 
### 
Jim Kessler has been chosen by
Professor James Gordon Emerson as
one member of the team which will
represent Stanford in the Common
wealth Club debate with the Uni
versity of California, and the re
maining member will be chosen
during tryouts to be held this morn
ing between Frank Binney, Bob Val
lier. Bob Branch, and Dan Eymann.
The tryoutees will present five
minute speeches and three-minute
rebuttals on the question, "Resolved,
that Congress should exercise
greatly increased control over the
running of the war and the planning
of the peace."
The wording of the question has
been changed slightly from the one
previously agreed upon, as it was
decided in a conversation with the
Cal contestants last Tuesday that as
it stood the question placed too
great a handicap on the affirmative
side.
The eighth annual Commonwealth
Debate will be held March 5 at the
Palace Hotel in San Francisco and
will be broadcast over station KGO.
The winning team will receive the
Commonwealth Club plaque.
"Although the Stanford team will
uphold the negative in the actual de
bate, tryoutees may present which
ever side they wish, and the speak
er's chances will not be hurt if he
presents the affirmative views," said
Professor Emerson.
