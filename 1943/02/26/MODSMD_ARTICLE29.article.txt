# Chappie Prints Service Issue
## 
### 
It's Chappie day
Yes, on the 28th day of February
this year 1943 the Chaparral is
again released to the hungry Stan
ford reading public.
But instead of the usual 1,700 cop
ies that are printed for campus con
sumption, 3.000 copies of this month's
mag have been run off the presses.
Why—because the magazine has
been designed for service men as
well as the Stanford undergraduate
and professor.
H. David Thoreau, the sage of La
gunita Pond and editor of these 32
pages of mirth, was not to be found
for a statement concerning this epic,
but that is all right because he didn't
work very hard on the magazine,
since the majority of the material
in it has been contributed by former
Hammer and Coffin funnymen who
are wearing the uniform they love.
Don't buy one, buy five! Leaving
the name and address of your serv
iceman with the extra salesgirl who
will be on the corner for just that
lp4l-po.se. The Chappie staff will
mail them anywhere, and for free,
too.
Ah. yes—one more item; this issue
is selling for the new low price of
25 cents. This offer is made for a
limited lime only, so if you want to
get on the gravy train—buy now, and
buy five!
