WITH AMERICAN FORCES IN
KASSERINE, Feb. 25 (3 p.m.) (UP).
— Americans occupied Kasserine
Pass this morning without tiring a
shot, after a night-long artillery
barrage.
By capturing the pass from over
extended Axis forces, the Ameri

cans have gained control of the
mountain line to which they retired
| after losing Gafsa. Sbeitla and other
j towns on the plain to the south and
I east.
German artillery withdrew dur
j ing the night, leaving heavy mine

fields for delaying action, and it is
believed they also evacuated the
town of Kasserine, about 10 miles
south and slightly cast.
They apparently have withdrawn
their main forces to the area of
Gafsa, 550 miles south.
American 155 - millimeter guns
fired into the pass for hours during
the night, and the infantry attacked
over the right shoulder of the pass
at 6:30 a.m. today.
They found no opposition.
A tank-destroyer unit and me
dium tanks crept into the pass
across a shell-tprn road. At noon,
"British forces which had advanced
without opposition from Thala along
the left shoulder of the pass, came
moving through the mine fields.
Watching from a knob at the
northern end of the pass it was
possible to see combat engineers
lifting mines which were laid in a
criss-cross pattern at 10-foot in
tervals.
Burned German and Italian tanks,
vehicles and guns were scattered
around the shell-pocked pass, vic
tims of the intense Allied aerial
bombing and artillery barrage. On
the plain north of the pass, where
American forces were moving for
ward, there were the charred ruins
of more than a score of trucks, at
least eight Axis tanks and freshly
dug German and Italian graves.
Last night, the artillery duel
lighted the sky with great flashes
as heavy American guns hurled
metal into the pass and Axis guns
replied.'

WITH AMERICAN FORCES IN
KASSERINE, Feb. 25 (3 p.m.) (UP).
— Americans occupied Kasserine
Pass this morning without tiring a
shot, after a night-long artillery
barrage.
By capturing the pass from over
extended Axis forces, the Ameri

cans have gained control of the
mountain line to which they retired
| after losing Gafsa. Sbeitla and other
j towns on the plain to the south and
I east.
German artillery withdrew dur
j ing the night, leaving heavy mine

fields for delaying action, and it is
believed they also evacuated the
town of Kasserine, about 10 miles
south and slightly cast.
They apparently have withdrawn
their main forces to the area of
Gafsa, 550 miles south.
American 155 - millimeter guns
fired into the pass for hours during
the night, and the infantry attacked
over the right shoulder of the pass
at 6:30 a.m. today.
They found no opposition.
A tank-destroyer unit and me
dium tanks crept into the pass
across a shell-tprn road. At noon,
"British forces which had advanced
without opposition from Thala along
the left shoulder of the pass, came
moving through the mine fields.
Watching from a knob at the
northern end of the pass it was
possible to see combat engineers
lifting mines which were laid in a
criss-cross pattern at 10-foot in
tervals.
Burned German and Italian tanks,
vehicles and guns were scattered
around the shell-pocked pass, vic
tims of the intense Allied aerial
bombing and artillery barrage. On
the plain north of the pass, where
American forces were moving for
ward, there were the charred ruins
of more than a score of trucks, at
least eight Axis tanks and freshly
dug German and Italian graves.
Last night, the artillery duel
lighted the sky with great flashes
as heavy American guns hurled
metal into the pass and Axis guns
replied.'
