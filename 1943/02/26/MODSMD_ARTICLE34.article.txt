# Students Urged to Get Ration Book Two Today
## 
### 
Students are urged to obtain their
ration books today in order to avoid
the crowds tomorrow. Applications
must be made at the Campus Gram
mar School, which is across the
street from the A.T.O. house.
Applicants must bring their War
Ration Book One. obtainable at the
Administration building, with them,
as registration is made on the basis
of Ration Book One. Both books
must then be returned to the Admin
istration building.
It has been necessary to wait for
about an hour before getting the
book, but the wait will be even
longer tomorrow if everyone puts
off getting his book until then. So
rority and fraternity houses run on
a family basis may send the house
manager down with all the members'
books, thus saving time. Other
groups may get together, leave their
ration books at the board and leave
only one person to pick them all up.
Fill Out Declarations
Students applying today must
bring along the filled out declaration
blank in yesterday's Daily, for the
ration board has run out of blanks.
Students need not declare sugar
under eight ounces and other ra
tioned foodstuffs under five cans, but
any foods on the list above those
amounts must be declared, although
they will not have to be turned in.
No Penalty for Excess
'"There will be no penalty for ex
cess stocks, but any false declaration
of rationed goods will be punishable
by a $10,000 fine or 10 years in
prison," according to a bulletin re
leased by the OP A.
A total of 658 books were issued
yesterday, the highest yet this week.
Rationing officials announced that
Book 105110 had been picked up by
some person by mistake and asked
that it be returned to the school
house. They also requested that the
person who had four No. 1 stamps
torn from his book instead of four
No. 8 stamps return so that the mis
take could be corrected.
