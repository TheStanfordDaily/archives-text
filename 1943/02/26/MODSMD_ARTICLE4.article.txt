# Seniors to Dance Saturday To Music of Gary Nottingham
## 
### 
Stanford dances tomorrow night
in "Latin America" when Gary Not
tingham plays for the Senior Prom
in the Women's Gym from 9 to 1.
Tomorrow's Prom will be the last
Stanford formal for several hundred
graduating seniors and Army and
Navy reservists.
Although there are still a few bids
for sale at the A.S.S U. office, for $3
a couple, no bids will be sold at the
door.
Scabbard and Blade members will
attend the Prom in uniform after a
banquet to be held at 8 p.m. at
L'Omelette. Several of the frater
nities are holding dinners at their
respective houses honoring those
seniors who will be leaving Stanford
at the end of this quarter.
Sonja Shaw to Sing
With Nottingham's band will be
one of the most colorful and popular
vocalists on the Pacific Coast, Sonja
Shaw. Her renditions of both the
sweet and the hot won her many fol
lowers here this quarter when she
sang for the Sophomore Cotillion.
"You'll really think you are in
South America when you see the
decorations," Irving Fine, chairman

of the affair, said last night. "Jim
Hirst and his committee have been
working for several weeks on ideas
for transfering the Gym into a real
South American ballroom."
Schermerhom Co-Chairman
Working with Fine as co-chair
man is Nancy Schermerhom. Other
committee members are: Hirst and
Jane Armstrong, decorations; Bob
Preble, lighting; Chris Moody, re
freshments; Shelly Parker, orches
tra; Les Krupp, police; Berna Cilker,
patrons; Bill Mac Masters, tickets;
Bob O'Neill, entertainment and John
Horrall, pubicity.
"All oi these committee members
are expected to report to the Gym
Saturday noon," Miss Schermerhom
pointed out.
Last Big Formal
The Prom will probably be one of
the last big dances on the campus
for the duration. Now, as in the
past, it has been one of the most
looked-forward-to social affairs of
the years, especially for the seniors.
One of the highlights of the Prom
will be the entertainment planned
by O'Neill. This has been kept secret
until dance time.
