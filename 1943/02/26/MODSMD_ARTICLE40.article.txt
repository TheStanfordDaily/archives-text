## Cagers Take On Bruins In Second Tilt Tonight 
### 
U.C.L.A.'s Bruins and Stanford's
Indians hook up tonight for the sec
ond time this year, giving Joe Spec
tator his best chance of the season
to see what "fire department" bas
ketball really looks like.
Last weekend the Deanmen
shelved their slow moving offense #
for a lightning-fast break, reminis
cent of last year and the days of
Hank Luisetti, Immediately the
Cards begin scoring points, but their
defense suffered. allowing both
U.S.C. and the Bruins to hit the bas
ket just a little oftener.
Coach Everett Dean's problem to
night, then, is to keep the newly
found offensive ability of his boys,
and at the same time figure out a
way to stop Messrs. Barksdale,
Perry, and West from running hog
wild as of last Saturday.
i 'Slow Down'

The possibility remains, however,
that the wily mentor might revert
once again to the "slow it down"
system vised so much this year. And
should the Indians hit the bucket a
little more often than in the past,
this attack, too, might bring a win.
Certainly a slow-break game would
increase defensive effectiveness, since
the boys would be in better shape to
make quick recoveries when the
Bruins start their fast break.
Other unique phase of the first
meeting between the two clubs was
U.C.L.A.'s ability to play the back
boards inch for inch with Ed Voss,
Howie Dallmar, and the rest of the
Card boys.
Colored center Don Barksdale in
particular was outstanding in this
department, as was forward Marvin
Lee and guard Ainsley Bell.
Only bright spot in the second half
of the first contest, a half in which
U.C.L.A. suddenly spurted into the
lead after trailing most of the time,
was the defensive play of Stanford's
Bill Hooper and Leo McCaflerv, who
successfully bottled up U.C.L.A.'s
West. West tallied 12 points in the
first half, but could get only four

from there on in. If Hooper and
McCaffery can stop West tonight,
the Indians might get the decision.
Card "Eye"
As far as the shooting of the Cards
is concerned, cage fans should see a
rejuvenated Howie Dallmar. The
lanky guard's floor play has been
outstanding all season, but not until
the first Bruin fray when he scored
17 points did Howie come to life on
the scoreboard.
Should Stanford top the Bruins,
U.S.C. will automatically clinch the
Southern Division crown. A U.C.
L.A. win would keep the Bruins
within mathematical reach, how
ever.
In a prelim to the varsity game,
the Stanford Freshmen meet Menlo
J.C. at 6:15. The Papeese already
hold two decisions over the Junior
College Quintet.
