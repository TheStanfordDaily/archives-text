# Farm Crew Gets Launch for Coach
## 
### 
The Stanford crew has at last got
a coach's launch—or a reasonably
sized facsimile—for the new addition
to the oarsmen's equipment is but
eight feet long. The boat is a small
out-boarder and has been lent to
the crew by its own coxswain. Wall
Drake.
The launch is just big enough to
hold Coach Carl Pedersen, so he is
both occupant and operator of it.
The motor which propels the new
Leviathan was contributed by Kenny
Young, one of the canoemen.
Crew practice has been somewhat
hampered because of the rainy wea
ther, but the outlook is encouraging.
Coach Pedersen says. The oarsmen
have suffered somewhat from the
loss of two veterans of last fall's
shell. Both A1 Savage and Don
Bjorldand have been called into the
service since the beginning of the
quarter.
