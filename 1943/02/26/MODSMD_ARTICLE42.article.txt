# Papeese Eke Out 22-19 Win Over Paly High Viking Cagers
## 
### 
The "now it's scheduled—now it
isn't" cage tussle between Stanford
Frosh eagers and the Paly Vikings
finally came off in the roughest fash
ion yesterday afternoon in the Pa
vilion, the Papeese ekeing out a 22-
19 win.
Both sides spent so much time
throwing each other around the
court that the scoreboard was some
what neglected, only one basket be
ing tallied in the first quarter.
Stanford held a 12-5 lead at half
time, went to 20-11 in the third
quarter, and then barely staved off
inspired Norm Keeler and his mates
in the last few minutes.
Keeler was the outstanding man
on the floor, scoring eight points
while turning in a great backboard
game. Papeese fast-break artists
Hugh West and Paul Nieto each got
eight also, most of them on setups
under the basket.
Woody Weir's squad once again

relied almost entirely on their fast
break for scores. All but two of the
Papeese' field goals came at the end
of breaks started by guards Babe
Higgins and Bud Provost.
The win gave the Frosh a two to
one edge over Paly for the season.
The Vikings took the first tussle
rather handily, while Stanford has
won the last two without too much
trouble.
