1 Daily you will find a letter written to the
editor by a lieutenant of the British Royal Navy.
It is not a very long letter, just a note really, .but
it is the sort of thing that sort of warms the hearts
of true Stanford men and makes us proud to be
-nembers of the Stanford family.
And particularly should this note make the
r arm's rugby and soccer athletes proud, for the
note says, in essence, that the Stanford men
Jhat the sailors of the Royal Navy met are gentle-
Tien.
An illustration of this belief of the Royal Navy
ran best be seen in a little incident that occurred
as a shipful of British sailors that had played
soccer with Stanford passed another ship of the
Royal Navy which was heading into San Fran
cisco. The first ship signaled the second ship,
vhich was coming in for repairs after having
spent time in the southwest Pacific, the follow
nq message: "When you get to San Francisco
be sure to get a game of soccer or rugby with
Stanford because they are the best sports in the
country."
This, coming from men who have sailed to
nost of the world and who are among Britain's
,'oughest and toughest fighting men, is a real
'ribute.
more specifically, it is a tribute to Harry
Maloney, who, almost single-handedly at times,
has kept interest in the two sports of rugby and
soccer alive and burning —and has, at the same
k ime, been able to turn cut winning and gentle
manly teams in both sports.
When you first think about it this may not,
perhaps, mean very much. On the surface it
merely indicates that a handful of Britishers en
joyed playing a game with a handful of Ameri
cans.
But to us it is as significant a thing as a group
of high-powered student brains getting together
and planning a beautiful post-war world. Per
haps it has more significance, perhaps less, but
to our rather mundane mind it is a demonstra
tion of democracy in action, a rare enough thing
in the cloisters of our "sleepy Farm."
Democracy in action came from Farm ath
letes, Farm gentlemen who have been trained
by Harry Maloney. We are proud to be part of
Stanford, and more, we are grateful to Harry
Maloney and his little-recognized soccer and
rugby men for representing us so well, for mak
ing us proud to be members of the Stanford
family.—Bill Steif
