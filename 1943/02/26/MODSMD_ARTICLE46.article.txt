My dear Hampson:
I am indeed sad to tell you that we stole away,
like a thief in the night, without saying farewell
to you all.
I would like to place it on record that my boys,
.representing the Royal Navy, and I are unani
mous that our Stanford fixture was the grandest
one that we enjoyed in the States. We take
away with us a cherished memory of sports

manship and hospitality, the like of which we
have not met elsewhere.
Keep up this tradition and Stanford will never,
never be the under-dog.
Our love we send to all at the Kappa house.
Now for the enemy!
May we meet again.
Best of luck in your own venture.
Very sincerely,
Dudley I. Blunt
Lieut., R.N.V.R.
