# OUR HASHER SEZ

There has been a flood of letters in the past
few weeks from men in the graduate school of
business who think what we have to say is just
so much drivel. In fact one such gentleman
called us "Our Trasher."
Therefore, I feel that it is only fair for us to
air our views on graduate business students.
In the first place, they are boys—yes, boys—.
who are only a year or two older than the simple
undergraduates they look down their noses at.
But since they have received an A.B. and are
now in a professional school, they feel they
have the world by the tail.
Actually, maybe they can't quite see the
things in the world about them as clearly as the
undergraduate can, since they have now nar
rowed the scope of their education and at the
same time intensified it to such an extent that
they haven't got much time to look around,
other than to read through the Stanford Daily
hurriedly at breakfast, and after all, the Stanford
Daily does not pretend to give a comprehensive
outline of the happenings in the world every
day.
It is true that the men who teach in the grad
uate school of business are among the "sharp
est" in the school. They know well that which
they teach, and they teach it well. But maybe
this leads to a stagnation on the part of their
students who sit in class rooms and take down
verbatim hours and hours of lectures without
actually analyzing that which they hear.
If they think that because they know what
makes the United States government or United
States Steel run, they know what makes the
Stanford Daily run, they get to go to the back
of the class.
If they think that because they know what a
San Francisco broker likes to read or what a
graduate business school drudge likes to read,
they also know what the Stanford undergradu
ates —who, by the way, are the people this
paper is published for—like to read, they get to
drop out of the class entirely.
If they feel that they are better suited to edit
a student paper for Stanford University than
are those who are now doing it and who have
been doing it for four years, they are wasting
their time in business school.
In conclusion, if any graduate business stu
dent with an I.Q. of over 150 would like to fill
this space with his personal views on the "more
important issues of the day," let him by all
means submit them, and they will be published
provided the linotvper does not fall asleep
while setting them.

This morning's Chaparral has, or at least so
rumor has it, within its pages a reprint of the
story that threw the Princeton Tiger out of the
U.S. mails.
The couplet
Hooray, hooray,
It's Chappie day
which is printed elsewhere in this paper in
conjunction with the usual Chaparral publicity
blurb, has been awarded the DeVotie Award
of the Week, plus the Croix d'oiseau by the
D.C.F. Literary Club (Daughters of Carillon
Founders) as the outstanding piece of original
verse written within the confines of Stanford
University this week. This talented fellow will
undoubtedly be assigned to the Poets' Corner
of the U.S. Army Enlisted Reserve Corps within
a few short weeks.

few weeks from men in the graduate school of
business who think what we have to say is just
so much drivel. In fact one such gentleman
called us "Our Trasher."
Therefore, I feel that it is only fair for us to
air our views on graduate business students.
In the first place, they are boys—yes, boys—.
who are only a year or two older than the simple
undergraduates they look down their noses at.
But since they have received an A.B. and are
now in a professional school, they feel they
have the world by the tail.
Actually, maybe they can't quite see the
things in the world about them as clearly as the
undergraduate can, since they have now nar
rowed the scope of their education and at the
same time intensified it to such an extent that
they haven't got much time to look around,
other than to read through the Stanford Daily
hurriedly at breakfast, and after all, the Stanford
Daily does not pretend to give a comprehensive
outline of the happenings in the world every
day.
It is true that the men who teach in the grad
uate school of business are among the "sharp
est" in the school. They know well that which
they teach, and they teach it well. But maybe
this leads to a stagnation on the part of their
students who sit in class rooms and take down
verbatim hours and hours of lectures without
actually analyzing that which they hear.
If they think that because they know what
makes the United States government or United
States Steel run, they know what makes the
Stanford Daily run, they get to go to the back
of the class.
If they think that because they know what a
San Francisco broker likes to read or what a
graduate business school drudge likes to read,
they also know what the Stanford undergradu
ates —who, by the way, are the people this
paper is published for—like to read, they get to
drop out of the class entirely.
If they feel that they are better suited to edit
a student paper for Stanford University than
are those who are now doing it and who have
been doing it for four years, they are wasting
their time in business school.
In conclusion, if any graduate business stu
dent with an I.Q. of over 150 would like to fill
this space with his personal views on the "more
important issues of the day," let him by all
means submit them, and they will be published
provided the linotvper does not fall asleep
while setting them.

This morning's Chaparral has, or at least so
rumor has it, within its pages a reprint of the
story that threw the Princeton Tiger out of the
U.S. mails.
The couplet
Hooray, hooray,
It's Chappie day
which is printed elsewhere in this paper in
conjunction with the usual Chaparral publicity
blurb, has been awarded the DeVotie Award
of the Week, plus the Croix d'oiseau by the
D.C.F. Literary Club (Daughters of Carillon
Founders) as the outstanding piece of original
verse written within the confines of Stanford
University this week. This talented fellow will
undoubtedly be assigned to the Poets' Corner
of the U.S. Army Enlisted Reserve Corps within
a few short weeks.
There has been a flood of letters in the past

business who think what we have to say is just
so much drivel. In fact one such gentleman
