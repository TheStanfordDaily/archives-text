# Today Is Last Day For Cardinals Tryouts
## 
### 
The third and final chance to
try out for membership on the
1943 Cardinals will be held this
afternoon in the student body
president's office in the Old Union
from 3 until 5.
To those five sophomores and
five juniors who are judged by
Shelly Parker and Leslie Lang
necker to be the best fitted to take
charge of A.S.S.U. social functions
for the next three quarters, will go
the honor of being a lifetime mem
ber of Cardinals.
Cider and doughnuts will be
served to tryoutees while they
wait.
No previous experience in this
type of work is necessary. In fact,
the only qualification the candi
dates must meet is for them to
be sophomores or juniors.
