## Varsity Cagers Stage Revival Dump Bruins in Second Half 
### Ed Luce 
It was U.C.L.A., 30-29, and then Stanford, 47-32. Those six minutes of
the greatest basketball the Pavilion has seen this year gave U.S.C. the
Southern Division title: but more important, they marked an Indian cage
revival weeks overdue.
The final score of the Friday night tussle was 60 to 41. giving Everett

Dean and his boys sweet
for the Card licking of a week ago.
Playing their usual slow-break
<_>ame. the Indians came off the court
on the short end of a 21-24 score,
mainly because of "Tricky Dick
West, who hit the bucket for .11
points in the first 15 minutes of play.
Gained in Second Half
Stanford worked hard at the open
ing of the second half, got up to
29-30, then suddenly went mad.
Freddie Linari underhanded his
favorite under-the-backboard shot
for two points: Jack Dana swished
from 30 feet; Ed Voss made a free
throw; Linari on a fast break, and
the score was 36-30. West sand
wiched in a goal, then the Indians
wt-ie off again. Dallmar got a fol
low. Voss a set shot and follow, and
so on.
Time after time the Cards scored,
intercepted, broke, and scored again,
with Voss, Dana, and Linari leading
the charge every time.
Ed Voss Starred
In fact. Voss played about the
greatest game of his career. The
huge center controlled both back
boards. started most of the fast
breaks, and still was good for 14
points. Dana and Linari befuddled
U.C.L.A.'s defense with their fast
break teamwork, while Howie Dall
mar followed hard and often to score
another 14 points.
Wilbur John's Southerners, with
West scoring 1(5 points, were a fine
basketball team the first half, but
when the Indian rush got underway,
they collapsed. In one period of play.
Stanford scored 18 points to the
Bruins' 3. Later on it was 10 points
to 0.

huge center controlled both back
boards. started most of the fast
breaks, and still was good for 14
points. Dana and Linari befuddled
U.C.L.A.'s defense with their fast
break teamwork, while Howie Dall
mar followed hard and often to score
another 14 points.
Wilbur John's Southerners, with
West scoring 1(5 points, were a fine
basketball team the first half, but
when the Indian rush got underway,
they collapsed. In one period of play.
Stanford scored 18 points to the
Bruins' 3. Later on it was 10 points
to 0.
It was U.C.L.A., 30-29, and then Stanford, 47-32. Those six minutes of
the greatest basketball the Pavilion has seen this year gave U.S.C. the
Southern Division title: but more important, they marked an Indian cage
revival weeks overdue.
The final score of the Friday night tussle was 60 to 41. giving Everett

Dean and his boys sweet
for the Card licking of a week ago.
Playing their usual slow-break
<_>ame. the Indians came off the court
on the short end of a 21-24 score,
mainly because of "Tricky Dick
West, who hit the bucket for .11
points in the first 15 minutes of play.
Gained in Second Half
Stanford worked hard at the open
ing of the second half, got up to
29-30, then suddenly went mad.
Freddie Linari underhanded his
favorite under-the-backboard shot
for two points: Jack Dana swished
from 30 feet; Ed Voss made a free
throw; Linari on a fast break, and
the score was 36-30. West sand
wiched in a goal, then the Indians
wt-ie off again. Dallmar got a fol
low. Voss a set shot and follow, and
so on.
Time after time the Cards scored,
intercepted, broke, and scored again,
with Voss, Dana, and Linari leading
the charge every time.
Ed Voss Starred
In fact. Voss played about the
greatest game of his career. The
huge center controlled both back
boards. started most of the fast
breaks, and still was good for 14
points. Dana and Linari befuddled
U.C.L.A.'s defense with their fast
