# Vaudeville Revived In Cagney Picture
## 
### 
YANKEE DOODLE DANDY, now
playing at the Stanford.
Twice too long, overrated, and re
voltingly sentimental, "Yank e e
Doodle Dandy" nevertheless man
ages to revive in some measure the
spirit of tho gilded vaudeville age,
but not as well as "For Me and My
Gal." The old Cohan songs are the
one really laudable point of the pic
ture. And James Cagney does 8
noble job. -Covey
