# Card Ruggers Down Olympic Club, 21-3
## 
### Ted Norton 
Last Saturday on Maloney Field
the Stanford rugby team danced on
the graves of a tough Olympic Club
fifteen to the tune of 21 to 3.
The Winged-O men started out
in good style, scoring a try, 3 points,
early in the first half. Their con
version failed, and from there on the
gnme was all Stanford's.
A long run by Fawcett took the
hall deep in to O.C. territory, where
he was forced out of bounds. The
ball was thrown in and some quick
lateralsâ€” Brodie to Laverty to Mun
roe brought Munroe to the goal
line for the Indian's first try. Laverty
converted, and the score was 5-3.
Then Brown carried the ball from
mid-field nearly to the Olympics'
goal, and Laverty drop-kicked
square between the posts to make
the score !)-3.
Card Substitutions
Large-scale substitutions by the
Cards at the beginning of the sec
ond half failed to improve the City
boys' situation. From a scrum on the
Club's one-foot line, Morrison tal
lied for the Tribe, and again Laverty
converted, making the count 14-3.
Three times in the hist period the
ball was carried across the Olympic
Club's goal without a score. Laverty
put another drop-kick through to
make the answer 18-3, and as the
final gun sounded, Norton and Brown
dove across the goal to put it at 21-3.
The entire last half was played in
Olympic territory.
Lavert\ High Man
Laverty, the squad's captain, was
high-point man with 12, represent
ing two field goals and two con
versions.
This was the next.-to-the-last game
in a season which ends next Satur
day. when the Cards meet the Gold
en Bears here. Coaches Harry Ma
loney and Ralph Ebner put most of
the squad on the field this game
with an eye out for the "Big Game"
next week.
