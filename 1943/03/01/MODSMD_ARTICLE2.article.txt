## Farm Speakers Tie Prisoners In San Quentin Tournament 
### 
For the first time in the history of Stanford-San Quentin debates, the
Stanford representatives. Bob Vallier, Joe Soares, and Dan Eymann,
emerged with a tie yesterday to break a long precedent of San Quentin
victories.
A tie with the inmate team is to be considered a more than ordinary tie.

.for as the decision is made by a
show of hands among the inmates,
the opposing team must be indeed
outstanding to overcome the nat
ural prejudice of the judges. In
past years, the San Quentin entrants
have inevitably won their tourna
ments,
Contestants Win Tourney
Vallier and Soares were chosen to
attend the contest by virtue of hav
ing won the Delta Sigma Rho tour
nament held on campus last week,
while Eymann, being the highest
ranking speaker of the losing team,
acted as the remaining member of
the three-man team which met the
three inmates yesterday.
The Stanford representatives left
on the 6:50 a.m. train yesterday
morning and arrived at San Quentin
around 10 a.m. After being searched
at the gates for any contraband ma
terials, they were allowed to pass
through to meet the warden and
other officials inside.
Speak Before Class
In the Education building they
met their opponents and were in
troduced to the assembled audience
of students of the prison night school
class by Mrs. Duffy, wife of the
warden.
Several distinguished visitors from
the University of California were
also present to hear the debate,
which was on the subject of "Re
solved. that the United Nations
should form a permanent federal
union,"
International Police
'"The point which got the biggest
reaction from the audience was when
we suggested an international po
lice force as a part of the powers of
the federal union." said Bob Vallier,
concluding affirmative speaker,
while Joe Soares added that the
negative "case was built upon pure
logic and experience rather than
extensive statistics.
After the decision, the Stanford
representatives had dinner with the
prison officials, were entertained by
the prison orchestra, and were taken
on a tour of the grounds. Instead
of the expected rock pile, they found
that the prisoners are devoting their
time to war work, such as the sal
vaging of scrap metal, growing of
victory gardens, and making of land
ing boats.
