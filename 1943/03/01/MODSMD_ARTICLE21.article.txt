# Farm Nine Plays Gaels Saturday
## 
### 
Stanford's varsity baseball team
will open what used to be its Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball As
sociation season Saturday, March 0.
when they travel to Moraga to meet
the Gaels from St. Mary's.
Because of the war the C.1.8.A.
no longer is in operation so the ac
tual league status is somewhat in
doubt.
In meeting the Gaels the Wolter
men will draw the proverbial "hot
potato" for their initial clash. The
Moragans always come up with a

flashy team and usually manage to
take the series from the Cards.
However, this year, the Army will
ing, the outcome will be more in
doubt than ever before because in
their pro-season games the Indians
have been fielding a team which
Coach Wolter has dubbed "the best
potential team in years."
After dropping their first four
starts the Indians have come along
fast to take three consecutive wins,
dropping San Jose State and two
tough service teams.
