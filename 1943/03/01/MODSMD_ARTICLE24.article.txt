# We Want Information

TS it too much to expect for those of us in the
1 various reserves to be given a certain amount
of information as to the time and method by
which we will be inducted? The calling up of
the Army Air Corps serves as a prime example
of the confusion which results from a lack of in
formation.
Two weeks ago we picked up our Dailies to
learn that "due to the exigencies of war," mem
bers of the Army Air Corps Enlisted Reserve
were being called to active duty. To the ap
proximately 100 Stanford men affected, it
seemed that their induction was a matter of a
few days, if not hours.
Disregarding the warnings of Dean John Bunn,
who emphasized that "orders will be staggered
. . • it's not possible for all members of the re
serve to be called at once . . . some students
may even be allowed to finish the quarter," a
many students quit going to classes and
attempting to keep up their work.
Since then, only 20 or 30 of the 100 have been
railed and it can be assumed, according to Dean
Bunn, that the majority of those remaining will
be able to finish the quarter. This means a lot
of make-up work for those who stopped at
tending classes. Those who were called, who
kept their grades up until they left, will receive
scholastic credit; those who quit school with
out orders, receive nothing. And those who
stopped going to classes can only get credit by
doing a lot of hard work.

While these students may be criticized for
acting rashly, the fault does not lie entirely with
them they were not officially informed as to
the method by which they would be called.
Dean Bunn could only make a guess as to the
number his only official information was that
the reserve was beng "gradually processed."
Meanwhile, we heard wild rumors that all would
be called in two days, five days, ten days
these rumors should have been officially
■squelched.

We realize that Army and Navy officials are
working under pressure and conflicting orders,
and that many military details must be kept
secret, but as members of their reserves, we

feel entitled to receive a certain amount of in
formation from them.
We should know approximately when we
are to be called and by what method. The Air
Corps did not know whether or not they would
receive orders to 4eave together at once or
whether they would be called gradually—and
they acted accordingly. If official word had
been given them to stay in school for gradual
induction, most of the confusion could have
been avoided.
The same problem will arise many-fold in
the E.R.C., now eligible for call two weeks after
the end of this quarter. Will we be called at
once en masse or will we too be "gradually
processed." Many of us would like to know
whether or not to register next quarter. If we
could be given some information as to when
we will be called and the method to be used,
our problems would be greatly decreased.—

TS it too much to expect for those of us in the
1 various reserves to be given a certain amount
of information as to the time and method by
which we will be inducted? The calling up of
the Army Air Corps serves as a prime example
of the confusion which results from a lack of in
formation.
Two weeks ago we picked up our Dailies to
learn that "due to the exigencies of war," mem
bers of the Army Air Corps Enlisted Reserve
were being called to active duty. To the ap
proximately 100 Stanford men affected, it
seemed that their induction was a matter of a
few days, if not hours.
Disregarding the warnings of Dean John Bunn,
who emphasized that "orders will be staggered
. . • it's not possible for all members of the re
serve to be called at once . . . some students
may even be allowed to finish the quarter," a
many students quit going to classes and
attempting to keep up their work.
Since then, only 20 or 30 of the 100 have been
railed and it can be assumed, according to Dean
Bunn, that the majority of those remaining will
be able to finish the quarter. This means a lot
of make-up work for those who stopped at
tending classes. Those who were called, who
kept their grades up until they left, will receive
scholastic credit; those who quit school with
out orders, receive nothing. And those who
stopped going to classes can only get credit by
doing a lot of hard work.

While these students may be criticized for
acting rashly, the fault does not lie entirely with
them they were not officially informed as to
the method by which they would be called.
Dean Bunn could only make a guess as to the
number his only official information was that
the reserve was beng "gradually processed."
Meanwhile, we heard wild rumors that all would
be called in two days, five days, ten days
these rumors should have been officially
■squelched.

We realize that Army and Navy officials are
working under pressure and conflicting orders,
and that many military details must be kept
secret, but as members of their reserves, we

feel entitled to receive a certain amount of in
formation from them.
We should know approximately when we
are to be called and by what method. The Air
Corps did not know whether or not they would
receive orders to 4eave together at once or
whether they would be called gradually—and
they acted accordingly. If official word had
been given them to stay in school for gradual
induction, most of the confusion could have
been avoided.
