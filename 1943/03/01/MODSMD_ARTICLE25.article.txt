The Editor, Sir:
An editorialist in Thursday's Daily asks why,
if Americans between the ages of 18 and 21
are "old enough to fight, to bleed, to suffer, and
to die, they are not old enough to assume ma
turity legally," i.e. to vote.
The answer seems to be that the qualifica
tions of a fighter are not necessarily those of a
voter. With all due respect to the teen-aged
citizens of this country (sincere respect, for I
am one myself), I cannot help thinking that
physical maturity alone does not qualify a man
to "express himself on governmental matters."
The writer of the editorial to which I refer
propounds the theory that "before the 'teen
age draft an individual was a mere child until
he became 21 . . . but now at 18 a man becomes
an adult. . . This is an interesting idea, but
hardly sound biologically. Wartime or peace
time, the human mind matures at about the same
rate; and the abrupt cessation of formal school
ing which draftees and reservists are experienc
ing, while it may have some beneficial effects,
is no substitute for three years' acquisition of
Do you really want that, Mr. Editorialist?
And how about young women between 18
and 21? Is it to be assumed that since they are,
ordinarily, physically incapable of fighting,
bleeding, suffering, and dying on battlefronts
throughout the world, they are to be denied the
franchise? Possibly the Daily's editorialist en
visages a nation ruled by its able-bodied young
men, with its women and those too old or too
weak to fight reduced to slavery.
Do you really want that, M r . Editorialist?
Don't you think it would be wiser, on the whole,
to wait until we grow up before we "vote and
express ourselves on governmental matters?"
After all, our job is to make sure there still is
an American government when we reach our
maturity. a. H. W.
