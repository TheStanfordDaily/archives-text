# Poet Alfred Noyes to Speak About 'Life and Literature'
## 
### 
Most of the Stanford student body will know Alfred Noyes as the person
who helped to fill their grade school poetry books with something a little
more appreciated than the normal fareâ€”poems like the "Highwayman" or
' Robin Hood in Sherwood.''
This gi eat English poet who has spent a lifetime defending aesthetic

and religious values against the
roads of growing materialist philoso
phies will speak tomorrow night be
fore the Tuesday Evening Series at
7:30 in Memorial Hall.
His topic, "Literature and Life,"
is one symbolic of the great poet,
for in his volumes of writings he has
always attempted to let his story
tell itself in sound, and some of his
greatest works have come from a
close study of people and life in ,
actual conditions.
At present. Dr. Noyes is teaching
a semester course at the University i
of California, a temporary exile from
England because of repeated Nazi \

bombings of his Isle of Wight home.
He is no stranger to the problems
i of war and peace; his famous "Ave
' nue of the Allies" was called by
William Howard Taft one of the
greatest poetical expressions of the
hope that is universal for a war
-1 free world.
