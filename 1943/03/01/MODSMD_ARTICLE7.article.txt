Glover, a tenor from San Francisco.
He has participated in many church
and radio programs, singing in two
large San Francisco cathedrals and
starring on a 15-niinute radio pro

Strickland, general director of the
opera.
The chorus of some 50 persons is
the largest ever to sing on the Stan
ford stage.
