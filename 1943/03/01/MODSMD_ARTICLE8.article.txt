## Cellar Patrons Asked to Keep Ration Books 
### 
Unless one arranges to eat five
consecutive meals a week at a res
taurant it is not necessary to sur
render one's ration book to that res
taurant, according to L. L. Yancey
of the accounting department.
It is therefore not necessary for
students who habitually eat in the
Cellar or the Union Public Dining
Room to turn their books into the
Union, for although they may eat
five consecutive meals there a week, !
this is not done through previous
arrangement. The Cellar and Union
Public Dining Halls therefore fall
in the catagory of restaurants.
Keep Books at School
It is advisable for students who
are regular patrons of the Cellar or
Union Public Dining Room to, keep
their books at school, however, for
it is illegal to send them home for
the use of the other members of one's
family.
In England at the present time,
restaurant patrons must use up their
own ration points when buying cer
tain meats and other commodities,
and it is not unlikely that some simi- |
lar system will be adopted in this :
country.
