Adelaide Simon, 18-year-old Stan

alone at Lake Lagunita.
Dr. Anna Burnett pronounced her

Alto Hospital respirator and previous
resuscitator and artificial respira
tion efforts applied at the boathouse
had failed to produce results.
Larry Gray and Art Weller, two
students, brought Miss Simon to the
boathouse dock in the life guard
boat after Gray had discovered the
body floating about 75 yards from
the dock at 1:15 p.m.
Miss Simon was clad in a blue
bathing suit and borrowed white cap.
tier coat and shoes were found on
the dock, indicating she had dressed
it Roble before locker rooms at the
boathouse were officially opened at
I p.m. by lite guard Michael Coonan.
Further fact that she may have
oeen swimming much earlier was
supported by a student who said he
saw the coat and shoes on the dock
it noon.
Dr. Barnett and Dr. Paul Davies,
lead of the Men's Health Service,
estimated the body may have been
n the water as long as two hours
oefore it was found.
Miss Simon was a major in the
School of Biological Sciences. Her
liother and father are Mr. and Mrs.
Sylvan Simon and her brother, Dick,
s in the Navy.
