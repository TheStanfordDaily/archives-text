# Tresidder Tells Alumni Of Streamlined Course
## 
### 
Dr. Donald B. Tresidder, president
elect of Stanford, said Sunday night,
while addressing the Stanford Alum
j ni Association in Los Angeles, that
! students whose college careers are
1 interrupted by war service will find
! a streamlined academic program
awaiting them when they are "mus
l tered out."
Dr. Tresidder further declared
: that he believed most colleges would
■ retain their accelerated schedules
j after the war, reducing the tradi
, tional matriculation from four to
three years. He also stated that
Stanford will continue its current
system of four 10-week quarters,
with a week's vacation between each
quarter.
"After the war, California and the
: other western states will be the
strategic economic centers of the
j world. The close relation to the
j Orient, Latin America, and the
j South Pacific—where more than
| half the world's population now
j lives—will give the Pacific Coast a

! great role in business and in eco
nomic and industrial opportunities,"
declared Dr. Tresidder.
Dr. Tresidder resigned his presi
dency of the Yosemite Park and
I Curry Company Jan. 21, in order to
accept the presidency of Stanford,
effective Sept. 1, 1943.
One week after his appointment,
Dr. Tresidder was heading East
i where he was to meet Chancellor
Wilbur, who had proceeded him by
a few days, in Washington. There
they met with educators and ranking
Army officials, concerning the use of
Stanford's great facilities in the new
i plan to use college plants for the
further training of soldiers in spe
i cialized subjects.
Dr. Tresidder is not a professional
educator, but has "grown up" with
Stanford and once wrote that "his
interest in public service is Stan
ford."
Dr. Tresidder graduated from
Stanford in the class of 1919 and Dr.
Wilbur in 1896.
