# 'WAR MINORS'
## Training Courses for Women To Be Announced Tomorrow 
### 
"War minor" courses for women, designed to train them for participation
in the national war program by qualifying for definite jobs in industry or
jin community or government, will be announced tomorrow in a booklet
obtainable at the Registrar's Office compiled by a special academic com- #
nnittee appointed last December.
More than 155 separate groupings of courses for "war minors" are sug-

gested. These do not supersede the.
regular major programs offered by
the University nor do they waive
University lower division require
ments.
Most of the courses provide for a
six-quarter intensive training period
in some vocation essential to the
war. As much as possible existing
courses have been regrouped to fit
into the new curriculum; but new
classes have been created where none
existed to fill the need.
Variations to Courses
Not al! the possible variations to
the courses are listed in some cases,
Dr. J. Hugh Jackson, Dean of the
Graduate School of Business and
chairman of the committee, said,
Vocational advisers will be named
for each field, and students who are
not sure of their courses or who
wish to make changes and substi
tutions in the suggested curricula
are urged to consult with them.
