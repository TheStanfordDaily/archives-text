### Jane Glasson 
Carrying the instrumental musical
role for "The Gondoliers" Thursday,
Friday, and Saturday nights is a 40-
piece orchestra composed of a ma
jority of Stanford students and a
few Palo Alto residents under the di
rection of Dr. Herbert Jan Popper.
With the orchestra in the pit will
be a special orchestra chorus of sin
gers to augment the some 50 chorus
members who appear on the stage
for the Gilbert and Sullivan comic
opera.
Although the stage chorus is the
largest assembled for a Stanford
Players' production, directors, un
der the supervision of F. C. Strick
land, have insured adequate singing
volume.
Besides singing, a dancing chorus
organized by Jacques Poley-Ogg
performs throughout the show, fig
uring prominently in the main
choral number, Kachucha.
Dancers are: Julius Buckler, A1
Cleaveland, Frances Frazier, Helen
Herring, Joan Hubbard, Sam
Knowles, A1 Miossi. Olgadale Phil
lips, Maria Rael, and Janice
Shaughnessy.

More than 900 languages are spo
ken on the continent of Asia.
