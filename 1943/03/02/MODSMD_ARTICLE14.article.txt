Commonwealth Club debate with
the University of California Friday

Francisco.
The question, "Resolved, that Con
gress should have greater power in
running the war and planning the
peace," was decided upon after a
conference with the Cal contestants
held on campus a week ago today.
Bill Hornby was chosen to debate
with Kessler after tryouts held Sat
urday morning, and they have been
working together since on the nega
tive side of the question.
