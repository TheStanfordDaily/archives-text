After once barely losing to the
.C.L.A. Bruins, the Stanford bas
etball team came back in fine style
> outplay, outpass, outrun, and
utseore them here last Friday night.
But the lirst half was pretty tough,
nd the main reason is that the
ruins controlled the rebound play.
i fact, it was so good that in the first
alf Stanford had little chance of
etting in for follow up shots, and
ailed at half time, 24-21. At the
utset of the second half, Don
arksdale still controlled the back
oards for U.C.L.A.

Then Howie Dallmar and Ed Voss
iok over, and the team put on an
•chibition of basketball that sent
st. year's team to the national title.
II seems that if a basketball team
»pes to be a winning one. it must
mtrol the backboards. In the last
tanford-U.S.C. game, the score was
I'd at 31-31, in the second half,
hen Ed Voss left the game on folds.
1> until that time the Indians were
'King their share of the rebounds,
id were very much in the ball
one. After Voss left the game, the
rojans took control, and went on
win the game handily, although
lanford did manage to roll up a
rge score.
looting Eye
The large scores that Stanford has
ored in its last games should indi
ite that they have found their
looting eye, and the reason for
•opping some of the games is for
me other reason, perhaps lack of
tckboai'd control.
Last year the movie critic of the
idgate Maroon went down to
•bine's State show house in Hamil
n. N.Y. and saw a double-bill,
ne of the pictures we have all
en, I'm sure. But here is the way
itic Joe Stodola reviews the epic:

•w Frosh Ruling
The new freshman ruling that be
me effective on Jan. 1, making
;m eligible for varsity competi
n. is being used by Harry Wolter,
seball coach. Just about half of
; team is made up of frosh. In
:l, his infield is made up of all
>sh, except Captain Ray Hammett,
> only .300 hitter Stanford had last
ison. Should Hammett be called
o the Army next quarter, frosh
>yd Merriman will move in from
> outfield to the first base position
make it completely first-year men.
After once barely losing to the
.C.L.A. Bruins, the Stanford bas
etball team came back in fine style
> outplay, outpass, outrun, and
utseore them here last Friday night.
But the lirst half was pretty tough,
nd the main reason is that the
ruins controlled the rebound play.
i fact, it was so good that in the first
alf Stanford had little chance of
etting in for follow up shots, and
ailed at half time, 24-21. At the
utset of the second half, Don
arksdale still controlled the back
oards for U.C.L.A.
allmar-Voss Combo
Then Howie Dallmar and Ed Voss
iok over, and the team put on an
•chibition of basketball that sent
st. year's team to the national title.
II seems that if a basketball team
»pes to be a winning one. it must
mtrol the backboards. In the last
tanford-U.S.C. game, the score was
I'd at 31-31, in the second half,
hen Ed Voss left the game on folds.
1> until that time the Indians were
'King their share of the rebounds,
id were very much in the ball
one. After Voss left the game, the
rojans took control, and went on
win the game handily, although
lanford did manage to roll up a
rge score.
looting Eye
The large scores that Stanford has
ored in its last games should indi
ite that they have found their
looting eye, and the reason for
•opping some of the games is for
me other reason, perhaps lack of
tckboai'd control.
