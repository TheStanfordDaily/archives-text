### Ed Luce

the season to an inspired frosh quintet, 41 -.'57. in the Pavilion yesterday

O'Shea spent most of the first half with his hands on his hips, suddenly
came to life in the second with some phenomenal one-handed shots on the

dead run, but still had to relinquish
scoring honors to little Hugh West.
West couldn't miss from his favorite
corner, and came up with 14 points
to O'Shea's 12.
Ignatius Leads
S. I. got through on its reputation
in the first half, coming up with a
•D-17 lead, principally on the work
of chunky Harvey Christensen.
The opening of the third period,
however, saw West tank three quick
25-footers, giving the Papeese a lead
they never lost. The total actually
got up to 30-21, when O'Shea went
to work ""along with Scharfen, and
with six minutes left, were only three
points off the pace at 36-33. Paul
Nieto then got away for a push shot
and a set up, Christenson scored a
push, and then Nieto swished again,
making the count 41-35. O'Shea got
another two points, but the gun end
ed the rally.
O'Shea Lethargic
Although his play was somewhat
lethargic the first half. O'Shea put
on brief demonstrations of the skill
which has made him the greatest
prep eager in the Bay Area. On one
occasion he dived into the grand
stand in saving a wild pass, returned
to the court, took a return heave,
and scored with a hook shot while
running at top speed.
The win gives the frosh a com
parative score advantage over the
Cal Cubs, whom they meet this Fri
day and Saturday. The Cubs lost to
St. Ignatius, 44-33, two weeks ago.

they never lost. The total actually
got up to 30-21, when O'Shea went
to work ""along with Scharfen, and
with six minutes left, were only three
points off the pace at 36-33. Paul
Nieto then got away for a push shot
and a set up, Christenson scored a
push, and then Nieto swished again,
making the count 41-35. O'Shea got
another two points, but the gun end
ed the rally.
O'Shea Lethargic
Although his play was somewhat
lethargic the first half. O'Shea put
on brief demonstrations of the skill
which has made him the greatest
prep eager in the Bay Area. On one
occasion he dived into the grand
stand in saving a wild pass, returned
to the court, took a return heave,
and scored with a hook shot while
running at top speed.
The win gives the frosh a com
parative score advantage over the
Cal Cubs, whom they meet this Fri
day and Saturday. The Cubs lost to
St. Ignatius, 44-33, two weeks ago.
