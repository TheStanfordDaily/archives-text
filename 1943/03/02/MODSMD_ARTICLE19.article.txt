Stanford winds up its conference
season in the last half of the Big
; Game series with Cal this weekend,
playing in Berkeley Friday night
and returning to the Pavilion for the
finale Saturday.
Fresh from their U.C.L.A. slaugh
ter, except for Jack Dana's ankle
the first string is ready for the final
chance to put their win column out
of the red. Cal in the conference
cellar with one win against five losses
won't be favored in the weekend
! tilts if the Indians keep up the pace.
In their attempts to hang onto the
winning form that they have had off
and on. hot and cold, throughout the
year, the squad is scheduled for two
practice sessions, today and tomor
row this week.
Meanwhile Southern Cal is pre
paring to cinch its title with two
games at Westwood against the
mangled Bruins this weekend.
Jack Dana's ankle last night was
improving, but the injury to the
starting forward might keep him out
of the series which would not help
' anyone anywhere at all, except may
' be the Nibs Price squad.
