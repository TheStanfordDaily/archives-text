# Ration Books Issued Again on March 13
## 
### 
March 15 will be the first op
portunity for students who did
not obtain Ration Book II to regis
ter again, according to the Palo
Alto Kation Hoard.
"With new rationing instruc
tions on gas and other commodi
ties coming in daily, we find it
impossible to continue with the
registrationunti 1 March 15. We
feel, that, students, were, given
ample time to apply for Book 11,
so those who are without them
will now have to suffer," the
board declared.
