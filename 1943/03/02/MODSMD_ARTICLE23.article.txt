# "Unselfish Peace"
## 
### 
A LETTER in today's Campus Opinion warns
of "a continuous undercurrent of criticism
of British Imperial aims and the accompanying
suggestion that we (United States) are being
made suckers by astute British statesmen." The
writer continues by urging us to disregard this
undercurrent and instead to fight "for an un
selfish peace."
The question which immediately comes to
mind is just what is meant by "an unselfish
peace." The phrase has an euphonious sound,
and will appeal to the strict idealist who is un
able to temper his lofty thoughts with the reality
of life and the unpredictableness of human
nature.,
Does "unselfish peace" mean divide and
rule by the victorious Allies? Does it mean in
ternational policing by the Allied Nations? Or
does it mean equal opportunity for the defeated
nations to develop new governments and so
cieties under the divided guidance of the Allies?
It is rather generally accepted that the pres
ent war is a fight between two ways of life. It
is becoming more evident that totalitarianism
is a revolt against a democratic society that is
becoming soft and meaningless because it has
deviated from its original standards and con
cepts. It is on this that Hitler has based his
opinions that the United Nations will be unable
to beat his forces in the long run.
Consequently, to beat Hitler's forces and pro
vide a peace which does not merely postpone
a solution to existing social and economic needs,
as was done in the First World War, it will be
necessary for us to agree on basic goals or
ideals toward which to strive.
This cannot be done if we hedge around by
phrasing our ideals in vague terms which are
useless when it comes to putting them into
practice. "An unselfish peace" is just the type
of vague phrase we must avoid.
Naturally there will be imperialistic tenden
cies, economic mainly, by all the Allied Na
tions following the war. We must accept this
as something which probably cannot be avoid
ed. The best we can do is to minimize and
equalize this imperialism among the Allied
Nations, trying not to hamper or monopolize
the new development of the defeated countries.
This will mean economic sacrifices by both the
United States and England in order to aid coun
tries like China, Russia, India, and the South
American nations whose governments are
based on many of the concepts and standards
on which our country was originally established
—concepts to which we will have to return if
we are serious in believing that a democratic
form of government with a stress on individual
ism is the best form of government.—Newton
Wise.

made suckers by astute British statesmen." The
writer continues by urging us to disregard this
undercurrent and instead to fight "for an un
selfish peace."
The question which immediately comes to
mind is just what is meant by "an unselfish
peace." The phrase has an euphonious sound,
and will appeal to the strict idealist who is un
able to temper his lofty thoughts with the reality
of life and the unpredictableness of human
nature.,
Does "unselfish peace" mean divide and
rule by the victorious Allies? Does it mean in
ternational policing by the Allied Nations? Or
does it mean equal opportunity for the defeated
nations to develop new governments and so
cieties under the divided guidance of the Allies?
It is rather generally accepted that the pres
ent war is a fight between two ways of life. It
is becoming more evident that totalitarianism
is a revolt against a democratic society that is
becoming soft and meaningless because it has
deviated from its original standards and con
cepts. It is on this that Hitler has based his
opinions that the United Nations will be unable
to beat his forces in the long run.
Consequently, to beat Hitler's forces and pro
vide a peace which does not merely postpone
a solution to existing social and economic needs,
as was done in the First World War, it will be
necessary for us to agree on basic goals or
ideals toward which to strive.
This cannot be done if we hedge around by
phrasing our ideals in vague terms which are
useless when it comes to putting them into
practice. "An unselfish peace" is just the type
of vague phrase we must avoid.
Naturally there will be imperialistic tenden
cies, economic mainly, by all the Allied Na
tions following the war. We must accept this
as something which probably cannot be avoid
ed. The best we can do is to minimize and
equalize this imperialism among the Allied
Nations, trying not to hamper or monopolize
the new development of the defeated countries.
This will mean economic sacrifices by both the
United States and England in order to aid coun
tries like China, Russia, India, and the South
American nations whose governments are
based on many of the concepts and standards
on which our country was originally established
—concepts to which we will have to return if
we are serious in believing that a democratic
form of government with a stress on individual
ism is the best form of government.—Newton
Wise.
