(Introductory note:—This is the second of
a series of articles on college life, designed for
those mothers and fathers of college boys and
girls 'vho read this journal. The article was also
writt with the idea in mind of acquainting
those 'men" in the graduate school of business

with college life. Before the whole or any part
of the following can be reprinted, permission

of Stanford University who are the publishers
of this paper, so there.)

Next to havng a class called off, the brightest
spot in a collegiate's somber life is to either
"hang" or "get hung with" a pin, depending on
the gender.
The specific article of jewelry varies any
where from a "High Y" pin, hung by impatient
frosh to a Phi Bete Key. The usual procedure is
for the male to "hang" the jewelry on the fe
male, although there have been occasions when
the girl was a member of lots of orgs and could
spare a pin, while her boy friend was a non-org.
Opinion varies as to just what the signifi
cance pin hanging has, but it usually connotes a
stage between "real good friends" and "tied up"
called "goin' steady." In the old days "pinning"
your girl was practically equivalent to buying
her an engagement ring, only more conspicuous,
but now statistcs show that a guy is more likely
to marry a girl he hasn't pinned than one he has.
The pin nowadays has a meanng something
similar to "keep off—temporarily at least."
It is still, however, considered slightly un
orthodox for a girl to accept pins from two dif
ferent guys at the same time. It is perfectly legal
for the girl to take several pins from the same
suitor, though.
The accepted standard is still the social fra
ternity pin, but honorary bowling societies and
professional nursing fraternities will suffice on
occasion.
The rub in all such transactions is getting the
jewelry back when the male begins to feel that
the relationship is beginning to verge on the
parasitic rather than the symbiotic. When the
item in question is an enormous rock-bedecked
article that hocks for a saw-buck or more, the
task is doubly hard. Then it causes hard feelings
all the way around.
Moral: A bird in the hand is real messy,
which doesn't particularly apply here but is al
ways good to remember.
