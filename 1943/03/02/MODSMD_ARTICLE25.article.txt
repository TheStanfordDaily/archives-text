The Editor, Sir:
There is a continuous undercurrent of criti
cism of British imperial aims and the accom
panying suggestion that we are being made
suckers by astute British statesmen. I shall not
attempt to defend British Imperialism, a subject
which should be of secondary importance to
an American at this time. Much more pertinent
is our own imperalism, extensions of which are
becoming dangerously apparent.
If we consider British Imperialism as an act
of selfishness toward other natons, should we
not be as guick to attach the same stigma to all
suggestons such as Clare Booth Luce's that
America capture the post war airway market?
The British can at least point with pride to
having issued a Beveridge Plan, about which
the present British Government is facing a
schism with the Labor Party. We can only point
to our own Congress which has completely cut
our appropriations for the National Economic
Resources Planning Board.
How would America's present peace aims
appear to a disinterested observer? We are
planning a continuation of "laissez faire" and
econmic isolationism. We shall back this up
with a huge conscripted army, if Representa
tive Wadsworth's suggestion is carried into
effect. We are in danger of thwarting our own
economic planning. How then can other na
tions rely on us for leadershp in this field? Are
those the aims for which we are now in a state
of war? On the contrary, we shall indeed be
suckers if we are not fighting for an unselfish
peace.
Yours sincerely,
Peter A. Low.
