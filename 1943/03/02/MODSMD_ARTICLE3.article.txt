## Alfred Noyes Talks Tonight 
### 
Four years out of Oxford, Alfred
Noyes wrote the first lines in a
poetical career which became one of
the high points of 20th century lit
erature.
In a hundred works, ranging from
the sound-filled ''Sherwood'' or the
"Golden Hynde" to his more mod
ern indictments of those who attack
moral values, such as his 1940 "Hit
ler at Judgment," the distinguished
Englishman has chronicled the fight
of those who believe in defending
aesthetic and religious values against
materialistic doctrines.
The Nazi bombers came to Britain,
but first they plastered the Isle of
Wight home of Noyes and his wife
and three children. A temporary
exile to Canada, Noyes began a
poetic crusade against modern super
ficiality, suggesting a new credo for
man based on classic virtues.
This philosophy cannot help but be
a strong part of the lecture "Liter
ature and Life" which Dr. Noyes
brings to Stanford tonight before the
Tuesday Evening Series at 7:30.
