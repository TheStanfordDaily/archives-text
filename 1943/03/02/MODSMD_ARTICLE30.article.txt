# Stanford's Cooks Are Skilled, Popula:
## 
### 
A cook's tour of the Farm reveals
some skilled, very popular people,
who, in their characteristic white
chef caps boss the soup-to-nuts pro
duction lines and represent a strong
percentage of the power behind the
scenes on the campus.
A short poll of these masters of
the kitchen informs us that there are
both good and bad points to cooking
for large groups of people. The
worst points come under food ra
tioning.
Residence house managers may
consider point rationing their own
private headaches, but there was a
heart-rending look in the eyes of
locally beloved chefs in answer to
the query, "And what is your piece
de resistance, your dish par excel
lence?" Too many could remember
when they were known for their
blistering hot steak dinners and their
rich luscious pastries. Now they
specialize in hot vegetable plates,
preferably using fresh vegetables.
One of these is Wong Lane, the El
Toro cook, who used to specialize in
meat but the club members admit
that he puts out good fresh vegetable
dishes. And he still makes "swell
home-made pies." Twenty-three
years is the closest estimate to the
length of time Wong Lane has been
with the club. He likes the boys,
doesn't even look up during water
bag interruptions to dinner, and re
members the names of students who
haven't been on campus for 15 years.
NEW ENCINA CHEF
Mrs. Louise Savim, formerly of
Savim's, down the highway, is
called "Madame" by the Pi Phi's
and "Mama" by the Pi Phi hashers.
Madame's French pancakes and
chicken saute sec haven't been af
fected yet by food rationing. Her
accent and apses into French endear
her to the house as much as her
popover breakfast surprises.
The Fiji cook, Mrs. Louise Hunt,
is a busy woman. She is a member
of the Negro Chapter of the Red
Cross in Mayfield, and wears the uni
orm of a Red Cross driver. Last
week she sold $1,000 worth of bonds
and stamps in front of the Stanford
Theater. How? You could blame it
on her personality, say the Fijis,
who call her Louie.
New chef of Encina, handling very
well the difficult job of preparing
iood for 600 people, is Fred Eber
haardt. Mr. Eberhaardt was born in
Switzerland, has cooked for hotels
in Italy, France, Holland, England.
He cooked for the Royal Vancouver
Hotel in Canada and served the King
and Queen when they were there.
His Swiss accent, tall white cap. effi
cient manner, and smile attracted
the interviewer's attention from a
foot-square pat of butter.
"Mac," or more formally, Lot Lin
wood Mac Donald, S.A.E. cook, is
'what makes the house tick" ac
cording to the S.A.E.'s. He special
izes in ice cream cakes (for which he
is known also to nearby Madrono),
Cooking is secondary with him, his
personality is first. He organizes the
hashers' quartet and immortalized
the Poodle Dog song which his father
wrote. He came from Massachusetts
where he lost his own restaurant in
the Jamestown flood.
TRKASI'ItE ISLAND COOK
This is only the third day for the
two new German cooks at the Tri
Delt house, Pauline and Elizabeth.
They arrived looking happily out
from underneath old-fashioned cro
chet caps, and driving their own car
in which they intend to do the mar
keting.
Rudolph Devries, a native Hol
lander who was chef at the Dutch
Windmill on Treasure Island, is the
cook in the Main Union dining room.
Mi's. Martha Trent, "The Madame."
reportedly gives the Chi Psi's "plenty
){ grtod food."
