# Dr. Baily Willis Recalls 'The Hidden House' Story
## 
### Vicky Sellens 
In the autumn of 1864, General
Sherman of the Union Army was
marching through Georgia, leaving
behind him a trail of destruction and
the smoking ruins of plantation
homes.
All over the South, Confederate
women were hurrying to hide away
their belongings, lowering the family
silver into wells and burying paint
ings in the woods, but one certain
household went them one betterâ€”
with only the house servants to help
theni and the Yankees only a few
miles away the women of the family
succeeded in hiding their house.
WILLIS CONFIRMS STORY
Confirmation for this tale comes
from Bailey Willis, professor emeri
tus of geology at Stanford and well
known figure on the campus.
In the winter of 1880, Dr. Willis,
then a young man, was riding
through North Georgia looking for
iron ore to be used for study by
the Census Department. He saw all
about him the ruins of old iron works
and plantation houses that had been
in the line of Sherman's march, and
these scenes of destruction made a
deep impression on him. Making
inquiry, he heard the story of a
house around in that part of the
country which the household had
saved from Sherman by planting
gravestones from a nearby cemetery
in the front lawn and closing the
great iron gates at the end of the
drive which led from the house,
which was invisible from the road.
TRAVELS WITH SHIiRMAN
Three years later, he accompanied
General Sherman and General Miles
on a trip across the Indian Reserva
tions of what was then Washington
territory. General Sherman was
making a last survey of the fortifi
cations of the country before re
lii ing.
Chatting over a camp fire one
night, Willis spoke to Sherman about
what he had seen in Georgia, and
Sherman in reply used the phrase
so often attributed to him, "Yes, it
was hell, but it had to be." Then he
looked up' with a smile and said,
"They saved one house on us,
though. They planted a burying
ground on the front lawn and closed
the gates, and we marched by."
WOOLCOTT TELLS STORY
Years later, in his home on the
Stanford campus, Dr. Willis heard
Alexander Woolcott tell the story of
the hidden house over the radio, and
in response to Woolcott's plea for in
formation about the location of the

house, wrote him a letter telling him
the story as he had heard it from
William Tecumseh Sherman himself.
Alexander Woolcott then framed his
own account of the incident in his
article, "The Hidden House," in the
February issue of the Readers Di
gest.
And now they are both wonder
ing if by chance the tale of the hid
den house will come to the attention
of someone who can tell them the
end of the story.
