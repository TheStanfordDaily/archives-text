# Farm Food Institute Is Unique

### 
When war struck this country 15
months ago, one Stanford institution
was ready to give immediate and
valuable service. And the Food Re
search Institute, the only organiza
tion of its kind in the United States,
will become more and more a valu
able center of information as the
food question becomes increasingly
important to the vitality of warring
nations.
Just one week before Pearl Har
bor, for example, the Institute re
leased its work on the "Rice Econ
omy of Monsoon Asia" —15 years of
research culminated in a report
which will be of inestimable value
in studying that basic food commod
ity of our greatest enemy, Japan.
BEGINS AI TER WAR
The Institute came into being as a
result of Herbert Hoover's work in
the Food Administration. Hoover,
who had the difficult task of feeding
Europe's starving peoples after the
First World War, and his assistant,
Dr. Alonzo Taylor, returned to Stan
ford in 1920 determined to establish
an institute to build up "a body of
significant knowledge" of the com
plex economics of the world's food.
He found Stanford with a piti
fully small economics library and
few facilities. But Dr. Joseph S.
Davis, the present director, and Dr.
Carl Alsberg joined with Dr. Taylor
as the first directors and began to
build.
Reference materials from a vari
ety of sources came to help in their
research and to build up a library
which makes Stanford one of the
world's finest information centers
for .studies in wheat, rice, and fats
and oils.
RESEARCH EXPERTS
Supplementing written material
came from a staff of research experts
from all over the world to add fixst
hand knowledge to the printed ref
erences.
Dr. Karl Brandt, German-born,
nationally known expert on Ger
many's food; Vladimir Timoshenko,
a Ukrainian, brought intimate
knowledge of Russia, Czechoslova
kia, and southeastern Europe; Klaus
E. Knorr, German-born colonial au
thority; Jozo Tomasevich from Ju
goslavia; V. D. Wickizer, authority
on the Orient; and Pavel P. EgerofT
from Belgium added a cosmopolitan
flavor to the Institute along with Dr.
Merrill K. Bennett, Holbrook Work
ing, and Helen Farnsworth.
The Institute has done its most
complete work in wheat, rice, and
fats and oils and his built up valu

j able libraries on these commociit
But in the past three years, acco
ing to Dr. Davis, it has taken
the study of international agreeme
—not only marketing agreements
special commodities but agreeme
to prevent depletion of national
sources. The latter study has tal
them into diversified studies of r
rine resources —whales, salmon, h;
j but, and furseals; depletion of
j world's oil.
MAIN RESEARCH FIELDS
The first book issued on inten
tional agreements was a volume
| the conservation of marine
sources by Dr. Tomasevich, wh
illustrates the research methods
the department. With the exc<
tion of a short visit to the Pac
Northwest, Dr. Tomasevich secu
| most of his material by correspoi
ence with persons in centers of
j fishing industries.
And while the fur seal and fish
agreements resulting from this
port have been successful in he
! ing to re-stock depleted areas,
I information can also be used in w
time. Fishing men can overfish
! cessible areas and underfish in ot
I areas so that the total stock of I
will not be reduced. This enak
I fishing companies to carry on
| ficiently under difficult war cc
| ditions.
Material is drawn from a vari
I of sources—information which me;
. little taken alone becomes coher
| in the aggregate under guidance
j the Institute's experts. Before
j war, they worked to solve the pr<
lems of surplus and depletion, _n
{ they work to win the war on
food front, and their store of infi
mat ion assures the Food Resea:
Institute a conspicuous place
| post-war economic planning.
