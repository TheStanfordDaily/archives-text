# Museum Acquires 'Last Spike'
## 
### 
He dug his shovel into Sacramento
and broke the black soil; ho watched
two steel ribbons sprout and pain
fully twist through the mountains,
then down onto the plains where
they raced ahead, even 10 miles one
day; he slammed a sledge into a
golden spike that united two great
oceans. Leland Stanford had built a
railroad as his "Jupiter" puffed to a
stop after coming east more than
800 miles to meet westbound "Lo
comotive No. 119."
I Hi] LAST SPIKE
"The Last Spike" that linked the
Central and Union Pacific in Utah
74 yeais ago lays on velvet plush in
the Stanford Museum with the in
scription, "May God continue unity
ot our country as this railroad unites
two great oceans of the world." Be
side it L the sledge that drove the

golden spike into a splintery tie, and
the shovel that heaved the first dirt
from the railroad bed.
When steel rang against gold in
Utah that day, the whole country
heard it, for wires from the spike
and sledge carried the electrical sig
nal East and West.
A NEW ERA
America cheered â€” it meant that
grueling days of horse and wagon
across mountains and desert, or sea
sick months on steamers were night
mares of the past. It meant Pull
mans and coaches, and. someday, air
conditioned streamliners.
It inspired artists and poets.
Thomas Hill painted the classic, life
sized "Driving of the Last Spike,"
and Bret Harte immortalized the oc
casion in a poem, "What the Engines
Said."' A reproduction of Hill's

! painting is glass-cased with
1 spike, the shovel, the sledge in
! Museum.
EXPANSION
It took Stanford's Central Pae
only six years to stretch steel acr
' mountains from Sacramento to Pi
montory, Utah, to meet Thon
Durant's Union Pacific.
One day, the Union Pacific, rac
West, built six miles of track and c
Red Stanford to do better, wager
$10,0l)0 that it couldn't be done.
May 28, 189(5, the Central's railrc
gang was up at sunrise. They c
and hammered until sunset, 1
they did the miraculous and m;
camp 10 miles further that nip
That historic 10-mile track was
j cently torn up to be resmolted ii
cannon to work again for the coun
it united.
