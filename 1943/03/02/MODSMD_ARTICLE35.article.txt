# Stanford War Board--—One Year Old
## 
### 
t seems, today, as it' we have been
war an awfully long time. The
s before war are only memories
ing further and further from the
id, a little ragged and crumbly
und the edges already. They are
ose dear, dead days beyond re
-I"—particularly '"dead."
r et the United States has been at
r only a year and a quarter,
lly a very short time. And in this
>rt time Stanford men and wom
we Americans at Stanford, have
tie 'a long way toward realizing
t modern war is a totality, touch
every nerve and sinew of our
?s. We know now that we cannot
r e alone in peace."
Ve know now that the debacle of
ina is our debacle, that the burn
til' Rotterdam seared us, that the
of Barcelona or the failure of
League of Nations to apply strict
ctions to Italy long before the
called major powers officially
nt to war have cost the lives of
• fellow Americans.
ANFOIiI) UNFIT
vnd we know also that Stanford
s probably one of the nation's
leges which was both mentally
1 morally least lit for the shock of
r when it came. This is not an
ictment, it is a fact, for a large
nber of students, perhaps a ma
ity, on "the sleepy Farm" were
at was then termed "isolationist."
d it is a fact that both the Presi
lt of our University and the Uni
sity's most distinguished alumnus 1
re in the same category. That
did not see what was coming is
to our discredit; the question is
at did we do once the catastrophe
war had hit us, and begun to
.hroud us?
-Veil, obviously, the answer is
t we did something.
i'here are, however, the problems
how much "something" is and
m what the "something" ema
ed.
E FIRST MOVES
Actually, as soon as war broke out
nford started to ready itself for
r conditions. The first alarming
ckouts which interrupted study
finals in the last days of Fall
arter, 1941, forced Stanford's stu
lts and administration to make all
>es of defense preparations. A
'ilian Defense Council was set
and air raid wardens were ap
nted. A student took over the
of advising other students as to
at reserve branches of the armed
ced Stanford men could get into.
:?om, representing Farm students,
'pingly began to lay down a policy
ich would focus campus social
■ closer to home.
GATIVE STEPS
>ut these were all negative steps,
ay were primarily defensive
ves, which would allow Stanford
adapt itself to wartime condi
is, but not necessarily moves
ich would further the progress of
war, which would aid in bring
victory nearer for the Allies.
Vnd then Bob Collins came along.
3ob Collins was just another Stan
d student. He liked to have a
id time just as the rest of Stan
d's men and women. He liked
ice and he liked Stanford—he
ibably would have liked to con
er himself typical of Stanford,
he only thing is that he had a
)d idea first.
»ING LITTLE TO HELP
?ob Collins saw that Stanford, for
miversity of its size and qualily.
s doing very little to help the
itcd States win its war. He saw
t materially much could be done
ht on the campus to contribute to
war effort. Even more important,
saw that the attitude of many,
ny Stanford students—a cynical,
oelieving attitude — must be
mged in order that these students

might be better prepared to march
off to war as they would eventually
have to do.
These were just ideas that swam
back and forth in the mind of Bob
Collins as he went to school during
January and February, 1942.
SHAKESPEARE ENTERS
Then one night Bob Collins was
studying his Shakespeare. It was
just a week after the American
mainland a couple of hundred miles
south of Stanford had been shelled
by a Japanese submarine. It was
just two weeks after Britain's
mighty Malaysian bastion, Singa
pore, had fallen.
The Japs were running rampant
in the Pacific, the Germans were be-
I ginning to stir on the Russian front.
; The cause of the Allies looked like
| only a fair bet at that time. And Bob
j Collins saw Stanford stewing in its
own war juice and not doing much
j about it.
ANl> THE BARI) EXITS
The Shakespeare was shelved and
young Collins began jotting down
ideas. Why not put Stanford's war
effort under one man? Why not
save used razor blades, magazines
and papers, and toothpaste and shav
ing cream containers? Why not
make personal invitations to soldiers,
to attend Tuesday Series, Sunday
movies and other campus programs?
Why not devise new and better
ways to sell United States defense
J bonds and stamps?
And why not change the attitude
of the Stanford man and woman to
-1 ward the war?
WENT TO EXCOM
A year ago today, March 3. 1942.
; Bob Collins went before Excom
i with his plans for a Stanford War
, Board. The plans called for a co
ordinator of Stanford war activities
i and three main divisions of work,
i the USO. salvage, and defense bonds
j and stamps. In comparison to the
' multi-divisioned board of today the
plans do not sound very ambitious,
but they were the starter and Ex
com, recognizing the need for such
an organization, gave S.W.B. the go
ahead and appointed Collins to head
the organization.
Now Collins had a paper organiza
tion with which to work. It was
just a question of getting it to pro
! duce results. First volunteers were
asked to sign up for the work, then
| the co-ordinator proceeded to bring
j the loose ends of existing war or
j ionizations under his aegis.
NO POLITICAL GRAVY"
As an editorial of March 4. 1942,
in The Daily by Hap Everett put
j it, "the thing needed is a group of
I workers who will work for the sake
; of working. Collins' helpers aren't
going to get any glory, there is no

political gravy involved, and the
work is not a matter of card-file big
shots."
That was the truth.
The "activities kids" didn't come
out in droves for the S.W.B. In
stead, students who had never par
ticipated in any "activity" at Stan
ford, worthy students who, like Col
lins, were convinced that they could
do something while in college to
bring victory closer, started to work.
And that work began to show re
sults. Throughout Spring Quarter
the sale of bonds and stamps went
higher and higher. Scrap was col
lected in larger and larger quanti
ties. More on-campus dances and
social events were held.
S.W.B. ESTABLISHED
The same trend was evident in
The same trend was evident in
the summer of 1942 and by fall the
S.W.B. had become established as a
Stanford organization. It enlarged
its scope, branched out into more
and more fields. It opened a Red
Cross work shop and sent hundreds
of Stanfordites into the fields and
factories around the University when
the farms and canneries found them
selves short-handed during the har
vest season. It conducted campaigns
to keep Stanford men and women
from using their cars as much as they
had in the past and entertained sol
diers.
Meanwhile, the young man who
believed that Stanford should con
tribute positively to the war effort
had left the Farm. Bob Collins vol
unteered in the Army' early last
October. And in his place stepped a
quiet wisp of a uirl. Rosemary Cross,
who by her contact with Collins had
become convinced of the justice of
our war and of the necessity of Stan
ford's contributing toward victory.
PRIMARY WAR WORK
Under Miss Cross's guidance the
S.W.B. has continued to function as
Stanford's primary pre-service war
work. It has become a large or
ganization but it has remained flex
ible—and it has stayed out of the
"charmed circle" of Stanford "acti
vities."
AND TIIK I I II RE?
But victory is not yet won. Those
lush days of pcace are still in the
future. And this the S.W.B. keeps
in its collective mind, for it realizes
that as long as the Allies are bat
tling fascism it must drive itself to
ward greater achievements at home.
It realizes that as long as death from
enemy guns faces Americans it can
not rest.
And it remembers the words of
Bob Collins—"Never think that you
have done enough"—a«d presses
forward.


TWO Stanford women are pictured above selling war stamps to a pair
of Farm men. This is typical S.W.B. work.
