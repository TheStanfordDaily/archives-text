# S.W.B. Is Largest Group—--Does What?
## 
### 
There are many students at Stan
ford who know that the Stanford
War Board exists. The only trouble
is that they wonder ■ what S.W.B.
does. This is a question which has
been mouthed around campus a
good deal. It is a question which
requires an answer.
For the Stanford War Board is a
large organization, probably the
Farm's largest strictly student unit.
If the time of literally hundreds of
Stanford men and women has been
well spent in working for the S.W.B.
there must bo demonstrable results.
And there are.
RANDOM SELECTIONS
Just selecting at random several
ol the more established branches of
the S.W.B. the following facts be
come apparent. Between the begin
ning of Spring Quarter, 1942, when
the S.W.B. got under way, and the
end of Fall Quarter in the same year,
the War Board sold the relatively
huge total of $36,615 in war bonds
and stamps, while in the first seven
weeks of this quarter it has already
sold 86,895.50 in bonds and .stamps.
Or take the work which the S.W.B.
has been doing in conjunction with
the Red Cross biood bank. Last fall
112 students gave blood to the bank,
a large number indeed, but with a
little more publicity, a little more
drive, the S.W.B. has already turned
213 students over to the Red Cross
for donations this quarter.
SURGICAL DRESSINGS
Then there is the work which the
5.W.8.. together with the Red Cross
and the Y.W.C.A.. has been doing to
get surgical dressings rolled. Thus
far in 1943 Stanford women have al
ready put in 640 hours at the work
room in the Women's Clubhouse,
while there arc 177 more women who
have pledged at least an hour to this
work but have not yet put in their
time. Of course, Stanfoixl women
are not the only people that work in
the surgical dressing room, but Farm
women have undoubtedly account
ed for more than half of the 18,105

bandages wrapped.
But these are just routine accom
plishments that today must be ac
cepted almost as a matter of course
in a nation at war.
The S.W.B. has gone far beyond
just these comparative mundanities.
It has struck out with originality
along new trails and has been suc
cessful in novel enterprises. The
foremost example of this, of course,
came last fall when the canneries
and the farmers in the immediate
vicinity of Stanford found them
selves short of labor and asked the
University for help. The request
was transmitted to the S.W.B. and,
in a mighty spasm of organization,
261 Stanford men spent 1,104 hours
topping and loading 642,760 pounds
of sugar beets, while 392 women put
m 2..')52 hours picking tomatoes and
walnuts.
HOSPITALITY HOUSE
In addition, the S.W.B. has sent
hundreds of young women to the
Palo Alto Hospitality House, where
they have entertained many service
men, has lent its staff of speakers
lo the World Student Service Fund
and Red Cross for those two or
ganizations' campus drives, have
salvaged several tons of heavy met
als and, perhaps most important of
all, ihas brought about sweeping
changes in Excom's social policy.
These are only statistics, it is true,
and it is true that it has not been
the S.W.B. alone which has piled up
all this work, for the Red Cross and
the Y.W.C.A. have carried heavy
portions of it.
S.W.B. COORDINATES
But the S.W.B as a coordinating
agency, as an idea, has been the
principal source from which all these
accomplishments have come. The
S.W.B. has been the body which has
carried the thought to Stanford stu
; dents that, though one is not ac
tually in a combat zone, there is still
plenty for one to do at home.
Dry statistics, yes, but statistics
that prove that Stanford has gone to
j war.


MRS. ROGKFI GOODW. « oi»vl woman member of Stanford's Hoard
Trustees since the University opened, discovered a sewing machine
machine that was out of order in the S.W.B.'s Work Room while visit
ing the University last fall. Sitting down to the machine with an oil
can and a screwdriver she soon had it running again. Here she is
pictured in the proccss of repair.

carried the thought to Stanford stu
; dents that, though one is not ac
tually in a combat zone, there is still
plenty for one to do at home.
Dry statistics, yes, but statistics
that prove that Stanford has gone to
j war.


MRS. ROGKFI GOODW. « oi»vl woman member of Stanford's Hoard
Trustees since the University opened, discovered a sewing machine
machine that was out of order in the S.W.B.'s Work Room while visit
ing the University last fall. Sitting down to the machine with an oil
can and a screwdriver she soon had it running again. Here she is
pictured in the proccss of repair.
There are many students at Stan
ford who know that the Stanford
War Board exists. The only trouble
is that they wonder ■ what S.W.B.
does. This is a question which has
been mouthed around campus a
good deal. It is a question which
requires an answer.
For the Stanford War Board is a
large organization, probably the
Farm's largest strictly student unit.
If the time of literally hundreds of
Stanford men and women has been
well spent in working for the S.W.B.
there must bo demonstrable results.
And there are.
RANDOM SELECTIONS
Just selecting at random several
ol the more established branches of
the S.W.B. the following facts be
come apparent. Between the begin
ning of Spring Quarter, 1942, when
the S.W.B. got under way, and the
end of Fall Quarter in the same year,
the War Board sold the relatively
huge total of $36,615 in war bonds
and stamps, while in the first seven
weeks of this quarter it has already
sold 86,895.50 in bonds and .stamps.
Or take the work which the S.W.B.
has been doing in conjunction with
the Red Cross biood bank. Last fall
112 students gave blood to the bank,
a large number indeed, but with a
little more publicity, a little more
drive, the S.W.B. has already turned
213 students over to the Red Cross
for donations this quarter.
SURGICAL DRESSINGS
Then there is the work which the
5.W.8.. together with the Red Cross
and the Y.W.C.A.. has been doing to
get surgical dressings rolled. Thus
far in 1943 Stanford women have al
ready put in 640 hours at the work
room in the Women's Clubhouse,
while there arc 177 more women who
have pledged at least an hour to this
work but have not yet put in their
time. Of course, Stanfoixl women
are not the only people that work in
the surgical dressing room, but Farm
women have undoubtedly account
ed for more than half of the 18,105

bandages wrapped.
But these are just routine accom
plishments that today must be ac
cepted almost as a matter of course
in a nation at war.
The S.W.B. has gone far beyond
just these comparative mundanities.
It has struck out with originality
along new trails and has been suc
cessful in novel enterprises. The
foremost example of this, of course,
came last fall when the canneries
and the farmers in the immediate
vicinity of Stanford found them
selves short of labor and asked the
University for help. The request
was transmitted to the S.W.B. and,
in a mighty spasm of organization,
261 Stanford men spent 1,104 hours
topping and loading 642,760 pounds
of sugar beets, while 392 women put
m 2..')52 hours picking tomatoes and
walnuts.
HOSPITALITY HOUSE
In addition, the S.W.B. has sent
hundreds of young women to the
Palo Alto Hospitality House, where
they have entertained many service
men, has lent its staff of speakers
lo the World Student Service Fund
and Red Cross for those two or
ganizations' campus drives, have
salvaged several tons of heavy met
als and, perhaps most important of
all, ihas brought about sweeping
changes in Excom's social policy.
These are only statistics, it is true,
and it is true that it has not been
the S.W.B. alone which has piled up
all this work, for the Red Cross and
the Y.W.C.A. have carried heavy
portions of it.
S.W.B. COORDINATES
But the S.W.B as a coordinating
agency, as an idea, has been the
principal source from which all these
accomplishments have come. The
S.W.B. has been the body which has
carried the thought to Stanford stu
; dents that, though one is not ac

als and, perhaps most important of
all, ihas brought about sweeping
changes in Excom's social policy.
These are only statistics, it is true,
and it is true that it has not been
the S.W.B. alone which has piled up
all this work, for the Red Cross and
the Y.W.C.A. have carried heavy
portions of it.
S.W.B. COORDINATES
But the S.W.B as a coordinating
agency, as an idea, has been the
principal source from which all these
accomplishments have come. The
S.W.B. has been the body which has
carried the thought to Stanford stu
; dents that, though one is not ac
tually in a combat zone, there is still
plenty for one to do at home.
Dry statistics, yes, but statistics
that prove that Stanford has gone to
j war.


MRS. ROGKFI GOODW. « oi»vl woman member of Stanford's Hoard
Trustees since the University opened, discovered a sewing machine
machine that was out of order in the S.W.B.'s Work Room while visit
ing the University last fall. Sitting down to the machine with an oil
can and a screwdriver she soon had it running again. Here she is
pictured in the proccss of repair.
There are many students at Stan
ford who know that the Stanford
War Board exists. The only trouble
is that they wonder ■ what S.W.B.
does. This is a question which has
been mouthed around campus a
good deal. It is a question which
requires an answer.
For the Stanford War Board is a
large organization, probably the
Farm's largest strictly student unit.
If the time of literally hundreds of
Stanford men and women has been
well spent in working for the S.W.B.
there must bo demonstrable results.
And there are.
RANDOM SELECTIONS
Just selecting at random several
ol the more established branches of
the S.W.B. the following facts be
come apparent. Between the begin
ning of Spring Quarter, 1942, when
the S.W.B. got under way, and the
end of Fall Quarter in the same year,
the War Board sold the relatively
huge total of $36,615 in war bonds
and stamps, while in the first seven
weeks of this quarter it has already
sold 86,895.50 in bonds and .stamps.
Or take the work which the S.W.B.
has been doing in conjunction with
the Red Cross biood bank. Last fall
112 students gave blood to the bank,
a large number indeed, but with a
little more publicity, a little more
drive, the S.W.B. has already turned
213 students over to the Red Cross
for donations this quarter.
SURGICAL DRESSINGS
Then there is the work which the
5.W.8.. together with the Red Cross
and the Y.W.C.A.. has been doing to
get surgical dressings rolled. Thus
far in 1943 Stanford women have al
ready put in 640 hours at the work
room in the Women's Clubhouse,
while there arc 177 more women who
have pledged at least an hour to this
work but have not yet put in their
time. Of course, Stanfoixl women
are not the only people that work in
the surgical dressing room, but Farm
women have undoubtedly account
ed for more than half of the 18,105

bandages wrapped.
But these are just routine accom
plishments that today must be ac
cepted almost as a matter of course
in a nation at war.
The S.W.B. has gone far beyond
just these comparative mundanities.
It has struck out with originality
along new trails and has been suc
cessful in novel enterprises. The
foremost example of this, of course,
came last fall when the canneries
and the farmers in the immediate
vicinity of Stanford found them
selves short of labor and asked the
University for help. The request
was transmitted to the S.W.B. and,
in a mighty spasm of organization,
261 Stanford men spent 1,104 hours
topping and loading 642,760 pounds
of sugar beets, while 392 women put
m 2..')52 hours picking tomatoes and
walnuts.
HOSPITALITY HOUSE
In addition, the S.W.B. has sent
hundreds of young women to the
Palo Alto Hospitality House, where
they have entertained many service
men, has lent its staff of speakers
lo the World Student Service Fund
and Red Cross for those two or
ganizations' campus drives, have
salvaged several tons of heavy met
als and, perhaps most important of
all, ihas brought about sweeping
changes in Excom's social policy.
