# RUSSIA MAY DIRECT PEACE

A lot of people besides Bill Steif
are dubious about the Russians.
Some people seem to think that the
more soundly they trounce the Nazis
the more they are to be trusted.
That, at least, is the evidence of Dr.
Gallup's poll. A year ago only 39
per cent of our voters thought the
Russians could be trusted to co
operate with us after the war; an
other 39 per cent said they could not
be trusted, and 22 per cent did not
Jknow what to think. Now after
Stalingrad and the winter offensive,
46 per cent think the Russians can
be relied on. 29 per cent are still dis
trustful, and 25 per cent don't know.
There are people, however, for
whom the Red Army's victories are
very ominous. There is a certain
eastern newspaper, occasionally and
accurately referred to as a rag, which
said recently that Stalin was going
to succeed in doing in Europe what
Hitler had tried and failed to ac
complish, and that it would be a good
deal worse for us. This fear of Bol
shevism, which I suppose a good
many people have, does not mean
that Dr. Goebbels' propaganda is
working; it merely means that the
state of mind in which fascism flour
ishes is not confined to Germany and
Italy. In most cases this fear rests on
a distorted notion of what commun
ism is and a one sided idea of what
has happened in Russia in the last
25 years. But for some the fear seems
to be justified by the fact that during
the period of the Soviet-Nazi non
aggression pact, the U.S.S.R. at
tacked Finland without provocation
and annexed the little Baltic repub
lics. parts of Poland and Bukovina,
and nearly all of Bessarabia.
FEAR OF ATTACK
I am not one of those who believe
that the attack on Finland and the
seizure of the Baltic republics were
justified by strategic considerations.
1 do not believe that the strategic
advantage was great enough to off
set the anger and distrust those acts
in western Europe and par
ticularly in the United States. This,
liowever, is a matter of opinion
which can be argued both ways.
There is less room for argument as
to why Soviet Russia acted as she
â€¢did.
During the last few weeks the
Soviet press, which is of course offi
cial, has indicated Russia's terri- !
torial claims in Europe. These in- j
elude the Baltic republics, which
voted to join the U.S.S.R., but only
after occupation by Red troops, parts
of the former republic of Poland in
habited chiefly by White Russians I
and Ukrainians, and part of the Bu
kovina and Bessarabia ceded by
Rumania.
USE OWN RESOURCES
By recognizing the Polish repub
lic and the prewar frontiers of
Czechoslovakia, Russia has given j
further evidence of her intention to
stay out of Central Europe. Stalin ;
and his associates surely realize that
to attempt to extend Russian rule
in the west would unite all Europe,
the British Commonwealth and the
United States in opposition. Further
more, the Soviet leaders also realize !
that the future of the U.S.S.R. lies j
not in conquests of new territory in 1
Europe but in the development of
the enormous resources of the terri
tories it already has in the east.
Trouble between Soviet Russia
?.nd the British and us is less likely
to come from Russian conquests
than from the support by them and
by us of rival groups fighting for
the liberation of the enslaved lands. 1
This is true of Asia as it is of Europe.
Th re is already trouble of this kind
m Jugoslavia where the Russians are
supporting the Partisans and the
American and British governments

are supporting the Chetniks. If this
sort of thing is done all over Europe
we can look forward to an indefinite
continuation of the war.
We and the Soviet leaders must
recognize that there will be a revolu
tion in Europe when the Nazis are
liquidated. In view of what has hap
pened the new governments are not
likely to be replicas of those that
failed nor are those groups and
classes that used to say "better Hit
ler than Blum" likely to be restored
to their places of power. The little
people will form the new govern
ments and unquestionably they will
be influenced by the prestige that
the Russians have won during the
war. These little people may even
use soviets, that is councils of work
ers and soldiers, as institutions of
democratic rule. If this is done both
the Russians and we must realize
that such soviets would not neces
sarily mean the adoption of social
ism or communism, much less of
the Russian or Stalinist variety. We
must avoid what Max Lerner has
called the "catastrophic fallacy of
our age," that is, the belief that
Russia will not be secure unless all
the world has adopted a particular
kind of socialism and that we won't
be safe until every one has accepted
our kind of democracy.
I believe that the Soviet govern
ment can be trusted as much as any
government can be trusted to co
operate in the organization of peace.

I believe this because Russia needs
peace and security more than she
needs territory. That cooperation
won't be e isy. It will be impossible
if we think there are fascists who
won't bite the hand that feeds them,
or if the Russians think no one can
be trusted who doesn't believe Stalin
is infallible. It can be accomplished
if we take Field Marshal Smuts' ad
vice and realize that "in this vast
suffering through which our race
is passing ... it is no longer a case
of socialism or communism or any
other isms of the market place, but
of achieving common justice and
fair play for all."
