# Public Indifferent to [illegible]ar Claims Captain Van Dyke
## 
### 
"The general public indifference
to the fact that there is a war on
was the first thing that I noticed
when I got out of the hospital,"
Capt. John Van Dyke, Stanford "38,
told students at the stamp rally yes
terday.
"It is really rough and tough out
there," he continued. "If's a 24-hour
a-day battle. The Nips like to at
tack at night, and they bomb and
snipe during the day. We figured
we were bombed 112 times in less
than 50 days.
"Henderson Field was all that the
Marines had. We were defending a
perimeter of five to six miles around
the field. We dug in and it was really
a job.
"The Japs would come through our
lines at night and then snipe at us
during the day from our rear. One
of the sergeants from the parachute
battalion got fed up with all this.
He lay in his trench until he was
pretty sure where one of their ma
chine gun nests was.
"Then he put two hand grenades
in his cartridge belt and took his
machete. He started to dash for the
emplacement — and he pulled the
pins on the grenades. That meant
that he had just five seconds before
they exploded. He jumped into the
Jap emplacement and the grenades
exploded. They blew the hell out of
him. but he took 10 Japs with him.
"Another thing that I noticed
when I returned," Capt. Van Dyke
continued, "was the fact that every
one here seems to under-rate the
Japs. There is nothing yellow about
them except their faces.
"Individually I'm sure they're not

as good as our soldiers, but as a
bunch they are good soldiers. They
will stick together and fight to the
last man. You've got to kill the last,
man, and you've got to make sure
that he is dead.
"There's one point that I want to
put across," Capt. Van Dyke said.
"If there is one thing that you can
be sure ol it's that the soldiers are
fighting 24 hours a day, and they
aren't complaining or yelling for a
48-hour-week. Thov want to whip
the Japs and get this awful mess
over with.
"We are fighting an enemy that
has gone all out, and we won't win
until we go all out. That means that
the people at home have got to sac
rifice everything, and 1 mean every
thing if we are to win. The Jap is
good."

in his cartridge belt and took his
machete. He started to dash for the
emplacement — and he pulled the
pins on the grenades. That meant
that he had just five seconds before
they exploded. He jumped into the
Jap emplacement and the grenades
exploded. They blew the hell out of
him. but he took 10 Japs with him.
"Another thing that I noticed
when I returned," Capt. Van Dyke
continued, "was the fact that every
one here seems to under-rate the
Japs. There is nothing yellow about
them except their faces.
"Individually I'm sure they're not

as good as our soldiers, but as a
bunch they are good soldiers. They
will stick together and fight to the
last man. You've got to kill the last,
man, and you've got to make sure
that he is dead.

put across," Capt. Van Dyke said.
"If there is one thing that you can
be sure ol it's that the soldiers are

"It is really rough and tough out
there," he continued. "If's a 24-hour
a-day battle. The Nips like to at
tack at night, and they bomb and
snipe during the day. We figured
we were bombed 112 times in less
than 50 days.
"Henderson Field was all that the
Marines had. We were defending a
perimeter of five to six miles around
the field. We dug in and it was really
a job.
"The Japs would come through our
lines at night and then snipe at us
