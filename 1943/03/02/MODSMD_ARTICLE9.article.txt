## 
### Lucy Thompson 
Capt. John V. Van Dyke, Stanford
'38, will speak at the rally this after
noon, Rosemary Cross, chairman of
the War Board announced today.
Preceding the rally, at which Capt.
Van Dyke will talk, 300 Page Mill
soldiers will parade down the Row.
Johnny Lawry, who last appeared in
the One-Acts, will be the master of
ceremonies at the rally, which is
sponsored by the War Board as a
part of its anniversary program.

Frank Fish Walker, financial
vice-president, last night gave
permission to the War Page Mill
soldiers to bring their tanks to
the parade. Tanks will conse
quently he a part of the parade.

Capt. Van Dyke, a 26-year-old
Marine, will describe his experi
ences on Guadalcanal. "The Japs
tried every trick in the book," he
said, "and we took damn few pris
oners."
The Page Mill soldiers will begin
the rally when they start their

| march down the Row at 4:30. Ac
; companied by their band, the sol
diers will bring with them 24 jeeps,
! several half-ton trucks, and light
artillery.
If the Administration will permit,
; the soldiers will also bring five
tanks. This may not be allowed,
j however, because of the effect on
the campus roads, Miss Cross de
clared. After the soldiers reach the
Cellar corner, they will line up their
equipment and the rally will begin.
Johnny Lawry, who wrote and
acted in the one-act play "The Un
{ scrupulous Women," will be the
j master of ceremonies. He will in
j troduce Capt. Van Dyke.
After the speech, Minute Maids
! will sell war bonds and stamps.
| "There will be no Stamp Day this
week," Vashti O'Donnell, chairman
of the Stamp Day committee re-
I ported. "Instead, everyone is urged
to buy their stamps at the rally. The
' regular living group representatives
j will also be selling their stamps to
i night instead of on Thursday night
as is usual. Furthermore, stamps will
not be sold on the Quad this week."

Capt. Van Dyke was the man who
recently told reporters the Japanese
have been told that their forces have
captured New York and San Fran
cisco.
"Henderson Field," he said, "wasn't
a field. It was a patch hewed out of
the jungle. The pilots flew bullet
ridden planes, taking off from a
make-shift runway that was always
pitted with bomb-shell crater's.
"The Japs put empty bottles in
their bomb loads. The eerie, whis
tling sound that these bottles make
as they fall is indescribable," he
continued.
Capt. Van Dyke landed on Guad
alcanal on Aug. 7 at the head of his
rifle company, and he saw service
there until about two months ago
when he was relieved.
"While we didn't have point ra
tioning there,' he said, "we foraged
for coconuts and roots to supplement
our chow, and occasionally we had
rice and fish heads that had been
seized from the Japs.
"At one point the atabrine, a qui
nine substitute, supply was so low
that there was not enough to con
tinue giving every soldier a daily
dose to prevent him from catching
malaria, and the atabrine was saved
for those who had the disease.

| "There will be no Stamp Day this
week," Vashti O'Donnell, chairman
of the Stamp Day committee re-
I ported. "Instead, everyone is urged
to buy their stamps at the rally. The
' regular living group representatives
j will also be selling their stamps to
i night instead of on Thursday night
as is usual. Furthermore, stamps will
not be sold on the Quad this week."

Capt. Van Dyke was the man who
recently told reporters the Japanese
have been told that their forces have
captured New York and San Fran
cisco.
"Henderson Field," he said, "wasn't
a field. It was a patch hewed out of
the jungle. The pilots flew bullet
ridden planes, taking off from a
make-shift runway that was always
pitted with bomb-shell crater's.
"The Japs put empty bottles in
their bomb loads. The eerie, whis
tling sound that these bottles make
as they fall is indescribable," he
continued.
Capt. Van Dyke landed on Guad
alcanal on Aug. 7 at the head of his
rifle company, and he saw service
there until about two months ago
when he was relieved.
"While we didn't have point ra
tioning there,' he said, "we foraged
for coconuts and roots to supplement
our chow, and occasionally we had
rice and fish heads that had been
seized from the Japs.
"At one point the atabrine, a qui
nine substitute, supply was so low
that there was not enough to con
tinue giving every soldier a daily
dose to prevent him from catching
malaria, and the atabrine was saved
for those who had the disease.
Capt. John V. Van Dyke, Stanford
'38, will speak at the rally this after
noon, Rosemary Cross, chairman of
the War Board announced today.
Preceding the rally, at which Capt.
Van Dyke will talk, 300 Page Mill
soldiers will parade down the Row.
Johnny Lawry, who last appeared in
the One-Acts, will be the master of
ceremonies at the rally, which is
sponsored by the War Board as a
part of its anniversary program.

Frank Fish Walker, financial
vice-president, last night gave
permission to the War Page Mill
soldiers to bring their tanks to
the parade. Tanks will conse
quently he a part of the parade.

Capt. Van Dyke, a 26-year-old
Marine, will describe his experi
ences on Guadalcanal. "The Japs
tried every trick in the book," he
said, "and we took damn few pris
oners."
The Page Mill soldiers will begin
the rally when they start their

; companied by their band, the sol
diers will bring with them 24 jeeps,

artillery.
