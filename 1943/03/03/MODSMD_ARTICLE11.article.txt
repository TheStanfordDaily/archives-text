# ARMY TO SEND 3 UNITS
## Special Program To Further Utilize Stanford Facilities

Stanford and Army officials are negotiating a plan to bring
three new Army units here between March 15 and May 1, the
University administration announced last night.
One unit will be trained in personnel psychology, another
in area and language, and the third in pre-medical study.
The number of men included in these three groups has not
been determined, but official confirmation of the program was
received from the Office of War Information .
The other three schools who may partake in the program
are University of California, College of the Pacific, and
Pacific Union .
(The Navy's V-12 program is outlined on page 8 today.)
