# Status of E.R.C., R.O.T.C. Cleared
## 
### Newton Wise 
In an effort to dispel rumors that j
spiead over the campus yesterday, I
Col. Harry B. Allen said that orders j
affecting the Enlisted Reserves and
First -Year Advanced R.O.T.C. stu
dents remain unchanged.
These orders, issued during the
end of Winter Quarter, mean that '
Enlisted Reserves will probably be
called two weeks after the end of j
this quarter and not before. There 1
is the possibility that orders will
come individually and at different
times, meaning that some will be
called a few weeks or days before
others. As the Army has both the
student's home and campus address,
the orders may be sent to either
place.
First Year Advanced
Members of the First Year Ad
vanced, R.0.T.C., will be called at
the same time and in the same man
ner as the E.R.C.
Col. Allen said the War Depart
ment will be contacted (his week
for an indication as to the probable
weeks of call. Students will be
able to judge from this whether or
not to register for Spring Quarter.
Sccond Year Basic R.O.T.C. stu
dents who have completed all basic
training, and who in the past have
been eligible to sign advanced con
tracts, will be given recommenda
tions when called, showing comple
tion of basic training.
About 79 Second Year Advanced
R.O.T.C. students will be allowed to
remain until June when they will
be sent to officers' training at Fort
j Sill, Okla.
Replacement Center
The 139 First Year Advanced will
j be sent to a replacement center,
j and then to a camp for three months
| of training equivalent to the second
j year of advanced training at Stan-
I ford.
Following that, 65 of this group in
field artillery will go to Fort Sill,
j Okla., 24 in ordnance will go to
Aberdeen, Md.. and 50 in the Quar
j termaster Corps will go to Camp
I Lee, Va.
Col. Allen also said that the re
view on Tuesday will not be the last
R.O.T.C. review, for the R.O.T.C.
unit will remain in the future, mi
-1 nus the advanced students.
