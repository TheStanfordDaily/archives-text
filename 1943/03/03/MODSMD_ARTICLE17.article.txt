Last week SLANTS mentioned the
fine work done in Palo Alto in secur
ing athletic equipment for men in
the armed forces—especially to men
stationed at small camps, away from
recreational centers. It so happened |
that I had an opportunity to visit a |
Navy ship over the weekend, and ;
one of the things most needed by the |
ship was athletic equipment.
This ship had none, save a base- 1
ball that had become so battered
that they stuffed it with rags, and
bound it with tape. The ship, how
ever, was grateful for a Victory Li
brary that had been sent to them.
If there is any old athletic equip
ment of any kind around the fra
ternity house, eating club, or at
home, call P.A. 6138, and they will
call for it. You never can tell, that
equipment may be waiting for you
at some litle outpost in a couple of
months, when it would certainly be
welcomed.

Some years ago Harry Maloney
had a scrappy lightweight at Stan
ford, and this fellow turned out to
be quite a boxer. Now, Maloney is
teaching his son the fine art of box
ing. But so good is this boy, that he
is now captain of the boxing squad,
and last year won the Gene Tunney
Award. That is Hyland "Bud"' He
bert. Ilebert has lost but one inter
collegiate fight—that one in the sec
cond California bouts last year, when
a Sunday Punch dropped him for
the count in the first round.
While on the subject of boxing,
there is a picture of an old Stanford
boxing team in Maloney's office.
And in this picture are two rather
small boys; but both later became
top-notch boxing coaches in schools
where boxing is one of the big sports.
These men are Myron Schall of the
California Aggies and Dee Portal
of San Jose State.
The day of the Stanford-San Jose
State bouts, Portal reported to
Chapel Hill to receive a commission
in the Navy. It seems that the
Spartans are so good, (hey don't even
need Portal. Sehall is supposed to
hold the record for hitting a punch
ing bag the most number of times in
a specified time.
The three top boxing schools in the
West are Washington State, Cal Ag
gies, and San Jose State.

there is a picture of an old Stanford
boxing team in Maloney's office.
And in this picture are two rather
small boys; but both later became
top-notch boxing coaches in schools
where boxing is one of the big sports.
These men are Myron Schall of the
California Aggies and Dee Portal
of San Jose State.
The day of the Stanford-San Jose
State bouts, Portal reported to
Chapel Hill to receive a commission
in the Navy. It seems that the
Spartans are so good, (hey don't even
need Portal. Sehall is supposed to
hold the record for hitting a punch
ing bag the most number of times in
a specified time.
The three top boxing schools in the
West are Washington State, Cal Ag
gies, and San Jose State.
Last week SLANTS mentioned the
fine work done in Palo Alto in secur
ing athletic equipment for men in
the armed forces—especially to men
stationed at small camps, away from
recreational centers. It so happened |
that I had an opportunity to visit a |
Navy ship over the weekend, and ;
one of the things most needed by the |
ship was athletic equipment.
This ship had none, save a base- 1
ball that had become so battered
that they stuffed it with rags, and
bound it with tape. The ship, how
ever, was grateful for a Victory Li
brary that had been sent to them.
If there is any old athletic equip
ment of any kind around the fra
ternity house, eating club, or at
home, call P.A. 6138, and they will
call for it. You never can tell, that
equipment may be waiting for you
at some litle outpost in a couple of
months, when it would certainly be
welcomed.

Some years ago Harry Maloney
had a scrappy lightweight at Stan
ford, and this fellow turned out to
be quite a boxer. Now, Maloney is
teaching his son the fine art of box
ing. But so good is this boy, that he
is now captain of the boxing squad,
and last year won the Gene Tunney
Award. That is Hyland "Bud"' He
bert. Ilebert has lost but one inter
collegiate fight—that one in the sec
cond California bouts last year, when
a Sunday Punch dropped him for
the count in the first round.
