# Boxers Prep For Return Cal Matches
## 
### 
Yesterday the Stanford Boxing
squad had its last hard workout in
preparation for the return California
matches to be held at Berkeley this
Thursday night.
Last week the Indians, after for
feiting two bouts, came from behind
to win, 8-6, over the Bears. It will
be a much better squad that Cal
Coach Don Cureton puts in the ring
tomorrow night, for last week's
bouts were the first of the season
for them.
Stanford coaches Harry Maloney
and Vic Lindskog are trying to find
someone to make the bantamweight
and featherweight classes so that
these divisions will not be forfeited.
Dale Hosman may be ready to go
in the 127-lb. class. He was sched
uled to box last week, but became
ill a day before the contest.
Maloney said that he would start
senior welterweight, John Levy, and
is confident that the cool counter
puncher will ge his first intercol
legiate win. Levy, who has a good
knowledge of the game, lacks ag
gressiveness, relying mostly on his
quick counters.
