# TRACK STILL CLOSED

### 
SAN MATEO. March 2 (U.R)â€”
Labor troubles which resulted in a
one-day track shutdown of the Bay
Meadows track last Friday were no
nearer solution today after Superior
Judge Maxwell McNutt ruled that
his court was without jurisdiction in
the case.
The track operated Saturday, but
then obtained permission to close
until March 5 to enable owners to
get their horses back in condition.
William P. Kyne, general mana
ger. said racing would resume on
schedule Friday.
