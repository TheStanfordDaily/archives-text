# Guadalcanal Hero Talks at Stamp Rally
## 
### Lucy Thompson 
Three hundred Page Mill soldiers
paraded down the Row yesterday
afternoon to start the Stamp Rally.
Introduced by Johnny Lawry, mas
ter of ceremonies, Capt. John Van
Dyke talked of his experiences on
Guadalcanal.
Accompanied by their band, two
platoons of soldiers marched past.
Following them were live tanks, 24
jeeps, some drawing 37-millimeter
guns, half-ton trucks, and an am
bulance. While the majority of the
soldiers left alter the parade, the
band and two tanks remained. The
tanks were named "Hunky" and
'"Hutsut."
Capt. Van Dyke was with the in
itial spearhead of Marines who
landed on Tulagi Island on Aug. 7.

An anonymous donor today
gave a scholarship in honor of
lÂ»t;b Collins, first Stanford War
Beard Co-ordinator, now in the
Army. The scholarship will he
handled as one of the Dimes for
Diplomas scholarships.

After mopping up that island and
several other small islands nearby,
they were transferred to Guadal
canal when the going got tough
there.
"We fought 24 hours a day," Capt.
Van Dyke said. "We were bombed
two or three times a day. We were
bombed by Japanese warships.
"Most people here don't realize
that there is a war going on. They |
don t realize that the Jap is a good
soldier, as good as we are collec
tively. And they're fanatical. You've
got to kill the last man and make j
sure that he is dead.
"At Point Cruz, we had 150 to 250 I

i Japs encircled. Their only means of i
retreat was out to a coral reef. That I
would be suicide. We captured one
of their men and told him to tell the ,
i commanding officer to surrender.
! The officer told us to come in and
| get him.
' So we had to go in and get them.
! We had to kiil every man. They
, were forced to retreat into the wa
; ter, but they kept on fighting.
"The Jap is a sneaky type of
| soldier. They will do everything to
| confuse you. They have been

trained for years in jungle warfare, i
They know what the score is. We J
didn't know much about fighting in !
the jungle when we started, but '
that is one thing we learned."

Dyke'b speech, see the story on page

During Capt. Van Dyke's talk,
three Minute Maids sold war bonds \
and stamps. They sold $84.70 in j
stamps, one $75 war bond, and one I
$25 bond in the half-hour during j
which Capt. Van Dyke was talking.
