Advocating a common language I
for diplomatic action, Albert Gue
rard, Stanford professor of literature
who is now in New York working
for the Office of War Information, is
the author of an article which ap- ;
peared in the February issue of J
"Free World."
In his article, "A Federal Language
for a World Commonwealth," Gue
rard points out that language is one i
of the major difficulties in maintain- i
ing world peace. He feels that if a j
language is adopted which is not the
I language of any one country the j
j world of nations will be a more
j peaceful place and suggests the use
I of Latin, not the classical version,
I but a basic adaptation.
Basic Latin
Basic Latin is his choice because \
"it is intelligable at first sight by
any one who knows latin, or Eng
lish, or any one of the Romance
languages."
Guerard realizes that his plan '
cannot be adopted for this peace so
he recommends the use of both
French and English. In defending
the use of two languages, he states
[ that the choice of one would cause
| resentment among the others. The
j universal language could be adopted

later.
If victory is ours, according to tl
author, there is nothing to prevei
the use of English as a univers
language. Then he continues, poin
ing out that immediately after tl
war English would be accepted bt
that after a while it would be resen
ed by our allies as well as those v
defeated because official predom
nance in itself is a challenge.
The same thing would happen
any other major national languaj
were adopted and a minor languaj
would not be adaptable to the ii
tricacies of modern civilization.
Already Taught
In promoting the use of Bas
Latin, he states that Latin is aLreac
taught in most high schools in tl
United States and that the Calhol
Church has spread it throughout tl
world.

Advocating a common language I
for diplomatic action, Albert Gue
rard, Stanford professor of literature
who is now in New York working
for the Office of War Information, is
the author of an article which ap- ;
peared in the February issue of J
"Free World."
In his article, "A Federal Language
for a World Commonwealth," Gue
rard points out that language is one i
of the major difficulties in maintain- i
ing world peace. He feels that if a j
language is adopted which is not the
I language of any one country the j
j world of nations will be a more
j peaceful place and suggests the use
I of Latin, not the classical version,
I but a basic adaptation.
