# Officials Explain Car License Delay
## 
### 
The State Department of Motor
Vehicles has explained the delay in
issuance of 1943 "V" license tabs,
and the California State Automobile
Association has announced that some
car owners will not receive their
tabs until May.
Delay in delivery of metal tabs
by the manufacturer, a last minute
rush of renewal applications, and
limited department manpower to
handle the work were reasons given
for the delay.
