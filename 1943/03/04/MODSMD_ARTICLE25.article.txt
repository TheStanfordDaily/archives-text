## Gros Speaks On America In Wartime 
### Beraardette Giannini 
"There will be 10,8000.000 men in
the armed services by the end of the
year; that will mean 1,300.000 fathers
included,'' said Robert R. Gros, re
turned alumnus, on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series program last night.
Mr. Gros based this and similar
statements concerning "America at
War" on his experiences obtained on
an extensive investigation of Wash
ington opinions and the feeling of
"Mr. John Q. Citizen" about war,
peace, and accompanying problems.
Galloping Frustration
Describing the condition of Wash
ington administrators as '"galloping
frustration," he said Americans
could view the entire' home front
with a feeling of pride, despite dis
sension and vestiges of partican
poltics.
He said the thing of tremendous
importance is the help, out of all
proportion to aid received, given us
by our allies, Russia and China es
pecially. He also ventured the out
right prediction that Joseph Stalin
and Franklin D. Roosevelt would
meet somewhere outside the United
States within 60 days.
European Front
On the heels of that statement, he !
said that there would be a second
front in Europe in four months. He
expressed concern about the atti
tude in the East regarding the unim- j
portance of the Japanese, whom he
described as underhanded and un
derrated.
Mi*. Gros stated that his experience i
sounding out the official and the
'"little guy" leads him to believe that
Americans will willingly give up |
many things as long as they know
the reason why. That the reason why
can best be answered by knowing
that figures like Eddie Rickenbacker,
Madame Chiang Kai-Shek, and the
widowed Annalee Whitmore Jacobi
know why.
