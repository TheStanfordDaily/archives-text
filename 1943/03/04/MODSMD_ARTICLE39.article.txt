# Mills To Train Camp Leaders
## 
### 
The growing scope and impor
tance of group work and recrea
tional leadership will be given spe
cial recognition in the program for
the 1943 Summer Session at Mills
College. A course in training ex
ecutives for Camp Fire Girls' work
will be presented from June 28 to
July 17.
This workshop is designed to give
students a concept of the values and
objectives of such work and of the
national Camp Fire Girls' program
as a technique for realizing those
objectives. Miss Ruth M. Teich
mann and Miss Eldora T. DeMots,
associate national field secretaries of
Camp Fire Girls, Inc., will comprise
the staff for the three weeks' course.
College faculty members and out
side consultants will be asked to
meet with the group for conference
and discussion during the session.
The course is offered with gradu
ate or undergraduate credit. Three
units of credit will be given to stu
dents with proper prerequisites.
Because the qualifications for a
trained executive in Camp Fire
work correspond with those re
quired in many such groups.
