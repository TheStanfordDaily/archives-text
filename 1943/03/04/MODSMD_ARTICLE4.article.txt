# Only 100 Quads Left; Last Day for Names
## 
### 
Today is the last day*that Quads
can be ordered with names en
graved on the covers, since the
books must be sent to the binder.
There are only 100 Quads left for
sale now and after these are sold
there will be absolutely no more
left, according to Barbara Woods,
business manager.
