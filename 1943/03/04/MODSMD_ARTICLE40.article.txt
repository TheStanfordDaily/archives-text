# War Activities Planned
## Women To Work 4 Hours a Month 
### 
The Stanford War Board is con
sidering a new plan for war activi
ties among the women on campus
for Spring Quarter. According to
the new plan, all women would be
required to do four hours of work
a month in any phase of war activ
ity they choose.
Activities include rolling bandages
in the surgical dressing room from
1 to 5 every afternoon; selling
stamps in living groups or on Quad
every Thursday, which will still be
Stanford's Stamp Day.
During this quarter, salvage will
be collected on the third Saturday
of every month as it was last quar
ter; and volunteers may donate
their blood to the blood bank the
first and third Thursday of every
month. According to Marian Tur
ner, chairman, the quota is full for
April 1.
U.S.O. activities include Satur
day evening entertaining at the
Palo Alto Hospitality House, and
entertaining service men on campus.
The War Board also sponsors the
Dimes for Diplomas Drive, the
Speakers' Bureau, and the Conser
vation Council.
