## New Men Are Added To Teams 
### 
Partial atonement for the Army's
grab of his star sprinters and hur
dlers came to Track Coach Pitch
Johnson yesterday in the persons of
several new field performers.
Johnson now has a shotputter, for
mer gridder Fred Boench, and a j
veterin javelin thrower, A 1 Pande,
to bolster these two events, besides
several other weightmen and a few j
runners who couldn't make it out
last quarter.
Good Showing
Up to the time of the ERC theft, !
the Indians were being hailed the |
comeback tracksters of '43. In their j
first meet of the year, the
Club Indoor Championships on j
March 13, Johnson's runners and j
jumpers easily outscored San Jose
State, Fresno State, California, and
a token squad from U.S.C.
Witnessed by 6,000 cheering spec
tators in the S.F. Civic Auditorium,
the meet opened* with the 50-yard
dash, in which A 1 Hoisch took a
close third behind S.C.'s Jack Trout
and San Jose's Billy Smith.
Hurdlers
Stanford's three , hurdlers, Don
Reiss and Glen Neilsen, both called
by the ERC, and Joe Mardesich,
monopolized the high and low tim
ber events. Reiss won both his heats,
beat former NCAA champ Earl
Vickery in the finals of the lows, but
fell after leading for 20 yards in the
highs. Neilsen took a third in the
lows while Mardesich got a third in
the highs.
Neglected by S.F. sportswriters in
their reviews of the 1.000-yard run
entryl ist, Stanford's George Grimes
gave the crowd a thrill by battling
San Jose's big, black Thclmo
Knowles stride for stride before
losing by a scant yard. Knowles made
it a little rough on the Indian when
lie made his bid on the far turn of
the last lap. but Grimes nearly closed
the gap in the straightaway.
Long Distance
Stanford's mile relay quartet com
posed of Floyd Cuff, T. D. Carmer,
Grimes, and Johnny Fulton easily
won the last event of the evening
from San Jose State.
Willard Smith took the other Card
first place when he leaped (j feet.
3 1/ o inches in the high jump, after
faltering twice at 6 feet.
Pomona Relays
Eight Indian spikesters entered the
Pomona relays March 19, and man
aged to run up 23 Vi pionts before
the day was over. Hoisch. who hadn't
worked out during finals week,
leaped 23 feet, 6V4 inches for a first
in the broad jump, and took third
behind S.C.'s Bill Jenkins and Stan
ford's Fulton in the 100.
Fulton, besides his remarkable ef
fort in the 100, ran the anchor leg
on the 880 relay team of Bob Fess,
Bob Compton, and Cuff, picking up
about five yards on S.C.'s Cliff Bour
land to take an easy second.
Cuff, Fulton, Bills, and Compton
walked away with the medley relay
title in 10:40.8.
