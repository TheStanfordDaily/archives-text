# Emmett Cashin Arrives Today With NCAA Breast-Stroke Title
## 
### Ed Luce 
Stanford's Emmett Cashin arrives
from Cleveland at 9 o'clock this
morning, a National Collegiate swim
ming champion by virtue of his
tight, six-inch win over Beisman of
Ohio State in the N.C.A.A. 200-yard
breast-stroke finals held last week
at Columbus, Ohio.
Cashin was the Farm's lone entry
in the meet, and together with Don
Beanston of California and Tiola and
Wright of College of Pacific, made
up the smallest contingent the Golden
State has sent to the national event
in years.
Not His Best
The Card swimmer's time, 2:27.3,
I was three seconds off his best.
| Cashin's failure to more closely ap
proach a world's record, something
| he missed by a tenth of a second sev
eral weeks ago, is attributed to two
; things by Coach Ernie Brandsten—

the 2,500-111116 (rip. and the fact that
the Ohio State pool lacked scum
gutters.
"I've taken several teams East for
these and other meets," said Brand
sten, "and each time found that the
trip took seconds oft' the times the
boys turned in."
Concerning the scum gutters,
swimmers usually have trouble
making their turns in pools without
them, since they afford a grip upon
which to pivot. Brandsten believes
Cashin lost perhaps a second because
of this.
Ineligible for the N.C.A.A. meet
last year because he was a J.C.
transfer, Cashin took a third in the
A.A.U. 200-yard breast-stroke cham
pionship in St. Louis. His win this
year gave Stanford six points, plac
ing the Farm well up in the scoring.
Ohio State, led by Bill Smith and
the rest of the Buckeyes hailing from
Hawaii, won the meet, followed by
Michigan and Northwestern.

eral weeks ago, is attributed to two
; things by Coach Ernie Brandsten—

the 2,500-111116 (rip. and the fact that
the Ohio State pool lacked scum
gutters.
"I've taken several teams East for
these and other meets," said Brand
sten, "and each time found that the
trip took seconds oft' the times the
boys turned in."
Concerning the scum gutters,
swimmers usually have trouble
making their turns in pools without
them, since they afford a grip upon
which to pivot. Brandsten believes
Cashin lost perhaps a second because
of this.
Ineligible for the N.C.A.A. meet
last year because he was a J.C.
transfer, Cashin took a third in the
A.A.U. 200-yard breast-stroke cham
pionship in St. Louis. His win this
year gave Stanford six points, plac
ing the Farm well up in the scoring.
Ohio State, led by Bill Smith and
the rest of the Buckeyes hailing from
Hawaii, won the meet, followed by
Michigan and Northwestern.
