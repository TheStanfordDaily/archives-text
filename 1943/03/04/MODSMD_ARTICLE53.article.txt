## Weak Nine To Meet S.F.U. Monday 
### 
A riddled Card baseball team opens ,
I its league schedule Monday against
i University of San Francisco in the
j city, but Diamond Coach Harry Wol
i ter is sure of only one starter in his
! infieldâ€”Bob Brown.
Duke Hammett, mainstay of the ,
! squad at first base, will be in there
i if he succeeds in getting transferred
to the Army Air Corps. If not, Ham
mett will leave April 5. and fresh
| man Lloyd Merriman will take over
his position.
More Doubtfuls
Shortstop Jack Brownson and
| third baseman Lee Scott are likewise
i on Wolter's doubtful list.
Out on the mound Doc Mason will
! undoubtedly get the call against the
I Dons, since Doc is the only pitcher
the ERC failed to touch. Bernard
I Woody, the sensational transfer from
Denver University, may be available
! if the Coast Conference rules favor
! ably in his direction. Wolter hopes
j to have this ruling by Thursday.
Northern Crown
The league setup this year finds

Stanford, California, U.S.F. Santa
Clara, and St. Mary's battling for
the Northern Division crown, and
U.S.C., U.C.L.A.. Occidental, and
Loyola fighting it out for the South
ern Division title. Winners will meet
in a playoff for the Coast champion
ship.
