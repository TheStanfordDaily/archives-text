# The 						New Excom
## 
### 
LAST night a new Excom met for the first time
and went to work on the business of run
ning the A.S.S.U.
They approved some dates. They reapproved
the social programs of the two past Excoms,
that is no off-campus functions and no late dates
on Friday nights. They awarded some letters
to the basketball team, and they decided to con
tinue the Sunday Movies Series.
Although Emily Howard, chairman of the
Sunday Movies, asks film agencies for good
movies, the best that are available on 18-milli
meter film, often she is denied them. However,
since the movies do provide entertainment for
a large number of students, it was decided to
'keep them and to try to get the best movies
possible.
After pushing through this preliminary busi
ness, the new Excom addressed itself to the
problem of setting up some sort of a workable
student government.
After much serious and well-thought-out dis
cussion, and much that wasn't quite so well
thought out, three alternative plans were de
cided upon.
In the editorial columns of tomorrow's paper
these two plans will be presented, and their var
ious merits held forth. Managing Editor Peggy
Boothe, a member of the late Excom, worked on
the reorganization committee and is well ac
quainted with the different aspect of the prob
lem.
In Friday morning's Daily we will have a bal
lot for a straw poll of the opinion of the students
on the problem that faces the A.S.S.U.
