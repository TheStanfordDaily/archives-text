THE Red Cross workroom has opened again.
Last quarter 236 women rolled bandages at
the workroom; but one girl, Mary Louise Davies,
rolled three times as many as any other stu
dent. Most of the students went once, enthusi
stically promised to spend at least one hour a
week in the workroom, and then, after the en
thusiasm evaporated, forgot all about it.
Rolling bandages is one of the immediate
things which women can and must do for the
war effort. Now that the casualty lists are
lengthening, in both the Pacific and North Af
rica, the demand for bandages is increasing. It
isn't just the duty of older women to roll band
ages, it is the duty of every woman, Stanford
students included.
But the workroom doesn't just want enthu
siasm, it wants women who will work, only an
hour a week perhaps, but every week. There
is a knack to rolling bandages. It isn't difficult
to learn, but it does take some time. The Red
Cross wants steady wo: u ers. They will teach
any student how to roi bandages, but when
they do so, they want that student to roll some
bandages.—Lucile Thompson
