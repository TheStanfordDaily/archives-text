### Cyclone Covey 
As doubtless noted elsewhere in today's
Daily, Dorothy Maynor sings tonight at Stan
ford.
She is a jovial Negress who appears on stage
in magnificent gowns with long trains, and must
have one handful of a time keeping straightened
out as she enters and leaves the wings for bows
and encores.
She is the "Miss Five-by-Five" of concert
artists. She is the type who is always the life
of the party. Sometimes she sings so whole
heartedly that you can see the entire audience
swaying a little to her rhythm.
She is a lot of fun. But she is primarily a dra
matic soprano. And never was a dramatic so
prano better equipped to hold her hearers be
witched. The most intense, high-pitched pianis
simo is her first distinction from other sopranos;
like all sopanos, she can sing loud on the high
notes too. She also has a full-blown contralto
you will practically never hear from women
who sing sopranoâ€”or in fact, from women who
sing at all. In Negro spirituals this low register
is to be heard to best advantage; and in Negro
spirituals she is most at home.
She has perfect diction in a number of lan
guages. She does not sing off key. She has
poise surpassing those who have had lifelong
schooling in concert appearance; with her it is
natural, and you would not believe she is a
relative newcomer, with little formal training,
to the solo recital. She will hold the attitude of
a song after the song has died; yet with her it
is not histrionic, but genuinely effective. And
the soulful melancholy of her singing when un
accompanied is of the rarest and loveliest of
concert experiences.
Tonight when she sings at Stanford again,
campus concert-goers will see, as they did two
years ago, that Dorothy Maynor is a sort of
triumph of her race.
