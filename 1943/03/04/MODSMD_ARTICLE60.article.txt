# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
To Our Readers:
For years Campus Opinion has reflected the
attitudes of undergraduate Stanford. To this
column, one of the oldest and most-read Daily
features, have come hosts of ideas from stu
dents and other readers as well. Through let
ters of praise, gripes, or constructive criticism,
action has been taken by campus administra
tors to more nearly reflect student opinion.
So this is your column. Letters to the Editor
will be gratefully accepted and printed as space
permits. They must be accompanied by the
writer's name and address, although the name
will be withheld from publication on request.
The Editor
