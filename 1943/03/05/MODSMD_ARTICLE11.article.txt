## 'I Am Convinced That Hitler Is Dead; 'Says B.Q. Morgan 
### BILL STEIF 
"I am convinced that Hitler is dead."
These were the words that Dr. Bayard Ouincy Morgan,
head of Stanford's Department of Germanic Languages, used
yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Daily.
The whole matter came into the open yesterday when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin published a letter by Dr. Morgan asking that,
the nation's short-wave radios broadcast this news to Germany in order
to "bait" the German radio on the subjcct.
In this manner, Dr. Morgan feels, the Allies will be able to determine
whether or not "Der Fuehrer" is alive—and Dr. Morgan is certain that
he is not—and thus hit one of the Nazis' most vulnerable spots, morale.
Dr. Morgan, one of the nation's recognized authorities on Germany,
came to this startling conclusion alter last Jan. 30, as a result of careful
observation of the German scene. He has, however, conservatively al
lowed his evidence to pile up further before making any public state
ment of his opinion.
The piece of evidence which convinced Dr. Morgan that Hitler is dead
was the fact that last Jan. 30 the Nazis held a tremendous celebration in
Munich to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their rise to power.
This has been an annual event since 1933 and has ranked among the
highest holidays in the German state. And always Hitler has been present
at these celebrations.
Contrary to his usual custom, however, Hitler did not appear in Munich
and sent no message to the assembled Nazis at the meeting. Instead, only
Goering made a speech.
Dr. Morgan received information from a friend close to official circles
when he was in Germany in 1939, just before the war broke out. This
friend of Morgan stated that Hitler had a bad heart.
Another fact that has become common knowledge recently is that the
commands sent to the Nazi armj on the eastern front are no longer signed
by Hitler.
