## 'I Am Convinced That Hitler Is Dead; 'Says B.Q. Morgan 
### BILL STEIF 
"I am convinced that Hitler is dead."
These were the words that Dr. Bayard Ouincy Morgan,
head of Stanford's Department of Germanic Languages, used
yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Daily.
The whole matter came into the open yesterday when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin published a letter by Dr. Morgan asking that,
the nation's short-wave radios broadcast this news to Germany in order
to "bait" the German radio on the subjcct.
In this manner, Dr. Morgan feels, the Allies will be able to determine
whether or not "Der Fuehrer" is alive—and Dr. Morgan is certain that
he is not—and thus hit one of the Nazis' most vulnerable spots, morale.
Dr. Morgan, one of the nation's recognized authorities on Germany,
came to this startling conclusion alter last Jan. 30, as a result of careful
observation of the German scene. He has, however, conservatively al
lowed his evidence to pile up further before making any public state
ment of his opinion.
The piece of evidence which convinced Dr. Morgan that Hitler is dead
was the fact that last Jan. 30 the Nazis held a tremendous celebration in
Munich to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their rise to power.
This has been an annual event since 1933 and has ranked among the
highest holidays in the German state. And always Hitler has been present
at these celebrations.
Contrary to his usual custom, however, Hitler did not appear in Munich
and sent no message to the assembled Nazis at the meeting. Instead, only
Goering made a speech.
Dr. Morgan received information from a friend close to official circles
when he was in Germany in 1939, just before the war broke out. This
friend of Morgan stated that Hitler had a bad heart.
Another fact that has become common knowledge recently is that the
commands sent to the Nazi armj on the eastern front are no longer signed
by Hitler.
Furthermore, Morgan believes that Hitler would never consent to allow
the active leadership of Germany to drop from his hands and. according
to Morgan* Hitler has made no speeches or public appearances at all in
the last six weeks.

"Hitler," says Dr. Morgan, "is the essence of German leadership. lie
has a native talent i' r leadership, the ability to squeeze the utmost from
a people. To a b»i\e number of the German people he has the same
relationship liml Napoleon had to the French people."
Still anoil.- r i. ■(■ i entering into Dr. Morgan's belief is that the sly
Goebbels r« ;id ; - e which was purportedly from Hitler at a i-ecent
gathering of N;>. is in Berlin. Dr. Morgan interprets this as meaning that
the highest Nazis Gi-ering, Goebbels and Himmler—wish to keep the
fact of Hitler's death from the German people, a deed for which they were
not wholly prepared in Munch Jan. 30 when a number of Germans at the
meeting shouted for "Der Fuehrer." Goebbels took care of this. Dr. Mor
gan believes, by preparing a Hitler-like message for the latest meeting.
But the clincher to Dr. Morgan's argument is this:
There was funeral music played on the German radio the day of
Jan. 19. This was immediately after the Allies' first huge mass raid on
Berlin in 14 months.
Funeral Music Key Factor
"Now," states Dr. Morgan, "funeral music to the German people
means only one thing: death has come to some person or persons." This
music had a double meaning, for while the German radio on this day was
stating that Hitler "is with his soldiers" it must be remembered that the
Nazis were suffering reverses in Russia and that many thousands of
German soldiers were dying daily. Therefore, to the German people the
music was played for the many dead soldiers while actually it was played
for Hitler—who was literally "with his soldiers."
Dr. Morgan's hypothesis on Hitler's death is that either he was actually
killed by a falling bomb in the Berlin raid or his weak heart failed because
of the shock and worry.
"But dead or not," he says, "Hitler has relaxed his grip upon the lead
ership of the German state. Without it Germany may crack a few months
earlier than we believe."
And that is why Dr. Morgan urges that the people of Germany be
informed of what: he believes to be a fact—Hitler's death.

gan believes, by preparing a Hitler-like message for the latest meeting.
But the clincher to Dr. Morgan's argument is this:
There was funeral music played on the German radio the day of
Jan. 19. This was immediately after the Allies' first huge mass raid on
Berlin in 14 months.
Funeral Music Key Factor
"Now," states Dr. Morgan, "funeral music to the German people
means only one thing: death has come to some person or persons." This
music had a double meaning, for while the German radio on this day was
stating that Hitler "is with his soldiers" it must be remembered that the
Nazis were suffering reverses in Russia and that many thousands of
German soldiers were dying daily. Therefore, to the German people the
music was played for the many dead soldiers while actually it was played
for Hitler—who was literally "with his soldiers."
Dr. Morgan's hypothesis on Hitler's death is that either he was actually
killed by a falling bomb in the Berlin raid or his weak heart failed because
of the shock and worry.
"But dead or not," he says, "Hitler has relaxed his grip upon the lead
ership of the German state. Without it Germany may crack a few months
earlier than we believe."
And that is why Dr. Morgan urges that the people of Germany be
informed of what: he believes to be a fact—Hitler's death.
"I am convinced that Hitler is dead."
These were the words that Dr. Bayard Ouincy Morgan,
head of Stanford's Department of Germanic Languages, used
yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Daily.
The whole matter came into the open yesterday when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin published a letter by Dr. Morgan asking that,
the nation's short-wave radios broadcast this news to Germany in order
to "bait" the German radio on the subjcct.
In this manner, Dr. Morgan feels, the Allies will be able to determine
whether or not "Der Fuehrer" is alive—and Dr. Morgan is certain that
he is not—and thus hit one of the Nazis' most vulnerable spots, morale.
Dr. Morgan, one of the nation's recognized authorities on Germany,
came to this startling conclusion alter last Jan. 30, as a result of careful
observation of the German scene. He has, however, conservatively al
lowed his evidence to pile up further before making any public state
ment of his opinion.
The piece of evidence which convinced Dr. Morgan that Hitler is dead
was the fact that last Jan. 30 the Nazis held a tremendous celebration in
Munich to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their rise to power.
This has been an annual event since 1933 and has ranked among the
highest holidays in the German state. And always Hitler has been present
at these celebrations.
Contrary to his usual custom, however, Hitler did not appear in Munich
and sent no message to the assembled Nazis at the meeting. Instead, only
Goering made a speech.
Dr. Morgan received information from a friend close to official circles
when he was in Germany in 1939, just before the war broke out. This
friend of Morgan stated that Hitler had a bad heart.
Another fact that has become common knowledge recently is that the
commands sent to the Nazi armj on the eastern front are no longer signed
by Hitler.
Furthermore, Morgan believes that Hitler would never consent to allow
the active leadership of Germany to drop from his hands and. according
to Morgan* Hitler has made no speeches or public appearances at all in
the last six weeks.

ership of the German state. Without it Germany may crack a few months
earlier than we believe."
And that is why Dr. Morgan urges that the people of Germany be
informed of what: he believes to be a fact—Hitler's death.
Furthermore, Morgan believes that Hitler would never consent to allow
the active leadership of Germany to drop from his hands and. according
to Morgan* Hitler has made no speeches or public appearances at all in
the last six weeks.
Ao Longer Signs Commands
"Hitler," says Dr. Morgan, "is the essence of German leadership. lie
has a native talent i' r leadership, the ability to squeeze the utmost from
a people. To a b»i\e number of the German people he has the same
relationship liml Napoleon had to the French people."
Still anoil.- r i. ■(■ i entering into Dr. Morgan's belief is that the sly
Goebbels r« ;id ; - e which was purportedly from Hitler at a i-ecent
gathering of N;>. is in Berlin. Dr. Morgan interprets this as meaning that
the highest Nazis Gi-ering, Goebbels and Himmler—wish to keep the
fact of Hitler's death from the German people, a deed for which they were
not wholly prepared in Munch Jan. 30 when a number of Germans at the
meeting shouted for "Der Fuehrer." Goebbels took care of this. Dr. Mor
gan believes, by preparing a Hitler-like message for the latest meeting.
But the clincher to Dr. Morgan's argument is this:
There was funeral music played on the German radio the day of
Jan. 19. This was immediately after the Allies' first huge mass raid on
Berlin in 14 months.
Funeral Music Key Factor
"Now," states Dr. Morgan, "funeral music to the German people
means only one thing: death has come to some person or persons." This
music had a double meaning, for while the German radio on this day was
stating that Hitler "is with his soldiers" it must be remembered that the
Nazis were suffering reverses in Russia and that many thousands of
German soldiers were dying daily. Therefore, to the German people the
music was played for the many dead soldiers while actually it was played
for Hitler—who was literally "with his soldiers."
Dr. Morgan's hypothesis on Hitler's death is that either he was actually
killed by a falling bomb in the Berlin raid or his weak heart failed because
of the shock and worry.
"But dead or not," he says, "Hitler has relaxed his grip upon the lead
ership of the German state. Without it Germany may crack a few months

informed of what: he believes to be a fact—Hitler's death.
"I am convinced that Hitler is dead."
These were the words that Dr. Bayard Ouincy Morgan,
head of Stanford's Department of Germanic Languages, used
yesterday in an exclusive interview with The Daily.
The whole matter came into the open yesterday when the
San Francisco Call-Bulletin published a letter by Dr. Morgan asking that,
the nation's short-wave radios broadcast this news to Germany in order
to "bait" the German radio on the subjcct.
In this manner, Dr. Morgan feels, the Allies will be able to determine
whether or not "Der Fuehrer" is alive—and Dr. Morgan is certain that
he is not—and thus hit one of the Nazis' most vulnerable spots, morale.
Dr. Morgan, one of the nation's recognized authorities on Germany,
came to this startling conclusion alter last Jan. 30, as a result of careful
observation of the German scene. He has, however, conservatively al
lowed his evidence to pile up further before making any public state
ment of his opinion.
The piece of evidence which convinced Dr. Morgan that Hitler is dead
was the fact that last Jan. 30 the Nazis held a tremendous celebration in
Munich to commemorate the tenth anniversary of their rise to power.
This has been an annual event since 1933 and has ranked among the
highest holidays in the German state. And always Hitler has been present
at these celebrations.
Contrary to his usual custom, however, Hitler did not appear in Munich
and sent no message to the assembled Nazis at the meeting. Instead, only
Goering made a speech.
Dr. Morgan received information from a friend close to official circles
when he was in Germany in 1939, just before the war broke out. This
friend of Morgan stated that Hitler had a bad heart.
Another fact that has become common knowledge recently is that the
commands sent to the Nazi armj on the eastern front are no longer signed
by Hitler.
Furthermore, Morgan believes that Hitler would never consent to allow
the active leadership of Germany to drop from his hands and. according
to Morgan* Hitler has made no speeches or public appearances at all in
the last six weeks.
