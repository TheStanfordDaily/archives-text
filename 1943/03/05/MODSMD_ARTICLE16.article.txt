# ASSEMBLY
## Women Discuss War Monday 
### 
With Chancellor Ray Lyman Wil
bur and Dean of Women Mary Yost
to answer their questions, Stanford
women will gather at an assembly in
Memorial Hall Monday at 7:15 p.m.
to discuss the University's war
training program.
All women are urged to attend
the meeting, which is designed to
aid them in planning their college
courses so as to include wartime
minors, special study programs to
train women for service during the
emergency.
Booklet Distributed
To inform women of these courses
before they go to the assembly, a
booklet titled "Wartime Program for
Stanford Women" is now being dis
tributed in the Registrar's Office.
The pamphlet was prepared by a
committee under the direction of
Dean J. Hugh Jackson of the busi
ness school.
Schedule Uncertain
Because of the uncertainty of
Army plans, a regular time schedule
of courses for next quarter will not
be published until a few days be
fore Registration Day, according to
Registrar J. P. Mitchell. A prelimi
nary schedule, however, will be dis
tributed to lower division students
before they pre-register next week.
War M inors
Included in the wartime training
booklet are 35 courses which will
fit women students for scrvicc dur
ing the war and afterwards. Re
quired and elective courses and the
number of units given for each are
listed for the programs, together
with the name of the adviser for
that particular department.
These wartime minors are not in
tended to replace majors, according
to Dean Yost, but to supplement
them. In many cases, these pro
grams work in with a student's
planned major. The programs train
women in the positions for which
there is the greatest need.
