# First Nighters Acclaim 'Gondoliers'
## 
### 
The lavish opening performance ;
of "The Gondoliers" last night in
Memorial Hall could very probably
lay claim to being the most thor
oughly enjoyable show ever pre
sented at Stanford.
Il was fast and high spirited, elab
orately costumed, magnificently set
with a great, gay chorus, and
Jacques Poleyand her dancers at
their best.
Ray Hammett as the basso Grand i
Inquisitor was out and out terrific,
and hardly less hilarious in fact,
outlandish were Jose deLarios (Duke
of Plaza-Toro) and Jack Coy (Giu
seppe).
Their various antics gave about
everything obtainable from the
take-ofT on Neopolitan opera, so
ciety, and things in general, and they
apparently had as big a time at it
as the audience.
The red-headed Beatrice Hagan

as Gianetta was very acceptable, !
as war also her singing mate. Edith
Stiickland, and Beta Popper.
Idelle Sullens had her satiric act- j
ing, overdone to just the exact re
quirements, down pat. Anrt Miller's j
brief appearance demonstrated sing- {
ing the audience could have taken
much more of; and for purely vocal
quality, none was better than Her
bert Cabral.
Larry Glover's singing was fine;
but you could often not hear it; and
his stage presence lacked the rousing j
energy of his co-actors. He added '
considerably to the vocalistics with
his high tenor blend, but really kept
no pace in other proceedings with
the broad-beaming Coy.
The stage business spoke well of '
F. Cowles Strickland's general di
rection.
And Dr. Popper, who could
probably get music out of a saw
horse, accomplished the musical
direction to his exceeding good

credit, drawing from the arr;
the stage and the choir ant
chestra in the pit, the while
chronizing them as well, mu.-
which you would not
thought them capable.
The first few minutes 100
little cold, but the warm-up
fast and kept up without hitc
the full-blown end; and it tl
the improvement with the ne:
nights' performances that then
ally is in second performan
Stanford, "The Gondoliers''
really be a tremendous show
