## Last Big Game Series Finds Indian Team Ready for Win 
### 
Jack Dana. Fred Linari, lid Voss, Ho\ye Dallmar. and Bill Hooper—
five guys who have spent a tough year in finding out that the loss of Bur
ni'ss. Pollard, and Cowdcn meant no championship—will try to salvage
some glory tonight as the last "Big Game" series with Cal for (he duration
goes into the first part of a two-game climax in Berkeley at 8.

The wind-up is in our own Pa
vilion at 8 tomorrow night.
It has been a disappointing sea
son for Stanford, not because the
team wasn't good, but because it
wasn't as good as its publicity. It is
disappointing only as every team
must be disappointing that follows
a squad like the champs of '40.
But there is always satisfaction to
Stanford in the Cal meets. In these
the outcome of all other games is
forgotten and the victory is re
garded as determining a "good" or
"poor" season.
With the series this year tied at
one each, Cal taking the first 33-32
and Stanford the second 36-34, to
night's game may be the clincher,
the victor coasting through tomor
row. Since Stanford comes home
tomorrow, a victory tonight would
make the odds high for a clean bi-11
this week-end.
