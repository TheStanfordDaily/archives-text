# Frosh Cagers To Meet Cubs
## 
### 
A small, fast-breaking Frosh cage
squad goes after the "Big Little"
basket title this weekend, meeting
the Cal Cubs over at Berkeley to
night, and tomorrow night here in
the Pavilion.
Papoose mentor Woody Weir sends
a completely revamped squad against
the Cubs, who likewise will have
several new faces in their lineup.
Paul Nieto, Bob Howe, and Bud Pro
vost will he starting their first game
against Cal, while the Cubs will be
without the services of dusky pivot
wizard Tom Tryon and sharpshoot
ing forward Andy Wolf.
Although they lost the first game
of the series several weeks ago,
Weir's boys are no worse than even
money to get a pair of wins. The
Papeese are undefeated since the
Cub loss, while the Cal squad fell
before St. Ignatius two weeks ago.
Julius Caesar was an ardent fan
of football games held at Rome dur
ing his time.
