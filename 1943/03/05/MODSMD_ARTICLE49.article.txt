# Gael, Card Nines Clash Tomorrow
## 
### Mike Kresge 
Weather permitting, Stanford's
varsity baseball team will take on
its first league foe tomorrow after
noon on the Sunken Diamond when
they meet the perennially tough
Gaels from St. Mary's in a double
header, the first game starting at
1:15.
Originally there was but a single
game scheduled and it called for the
Cards to travel to Moraga, however
the plans were changed early this
week.

Weathei also permitting, and if
the diamond dries out sufficiently,
the Indians will play McClelland
Field's baseball team this after
noon at 3.

Coach Wolter has indicated that
he will start Bill Brokaw in the first
game and Harry "Doc" Mason in the
second. This will be Mason's first
outing since the middle of last month
when he pitched the Indians to their
initial win of the season in downing
the Coast Guard Surf Riders 6-5.
Coining Fast
Since that time the Woldermcn
have come along fast to win the
rest of their remaining pre-season
games, downing San Jose Slate 7-5
and the Coast Guard Sea Lions 0-0
on Bernard "Woodie" Woody's two
hit shutout pitching. Following these
triumphs the Indians have remained
idle because of the bad weather.
The rest of the Cardinal lineup will
probably find Ward Walkup behind
the plate, veteran Duke Hammett
on first, newcomers Jack Brownson
and Bob Brown on the keystone sack
and short respectively, and veteran
Lee Scott at the hot corner. The
outer garden lineup will probably in
clude Vets Bill Harms and Ed Wash
burn, plus newcomer Lloyd Merri
man.
Gaels Lose Stars
According to Coach Wolter not too
much is known about this year's
Gael outfit except that they have
lost two star outfielders to the armed
services. Fans can rest assured,
however, that the Moragans will
field a Stirling crew, because in the
past they have usually managed to
take the annual series from the
Cards.
For several of the Indian players
this will be the last collegiate game
of their careers. Among them are
Duke Hammett, who has led the
Stanford batsmen for two seasons,
and Bill Harms, who has alternated
between the mound and the out
field. Hammett will go into the Army
in the E.R.C., and Harms will go
into naval aviation after graduation
in March.

outing since the middle of last month
when he pitched the Indians to their
initial win of the season in downing
the Coast Guard Surf Riders 6-5.
Coining Fast
Since that time the Woldermcn
have come along fast to win the
rest of their remaining pre-season
games, downing San Jose Slate 7-5
and the Coast Guard Sea Lions 0-0
on Bernard "Woodie" Woody's two
hit shutout pitching. Following these
triumphs the Indians have remained
idle because of the bad weather.
The rest of the Cardinal lineup will
probably find Ward Walkup behind
the plate, veteran Duke Hammett
on first, newcomers Jack Brownson
and Bob Brown on the keystone sack
and short respectively, and veteran
Lee Scott at the hot corner. The
outer garden lineup will probably in
clude Vets Bill Harms and Ed Wash
burn, plus newcomer Lloyd Merri
man.
Gaels Lose Stars
According to Coach Wolter not too
much is known about this year's
Gael outfit except that they have
lost two star outfielders to the armed
services. Fans can rest assured,
however, that the Moragans will
field a Stirling crew, because in the
past they have usually managed to
take the annual series from the
Cards.
For several of the Indian players
this will be the last collegiate game
of their careers. Among them are
Duke Hammett, who has led the
Stanford batsmen for two seasons,
and Bill Harms, who has alternated
between the mound and the out
field. Hammett will go into the Army
in the E.R.C., and Harms will go
into naval aviation after graduation
in March.
Weather permitting, Stanford's
varsity baseball team will take on
its first league foe tomorrow after
noon on the Sunken Diamond when
they meet the perennially tough
Gaels from St. Mary's in a double
header, the first game starting at
1:15.
Originally there was but a single
game scheduled and it called for the
Cards to travel to Moraga, however
the plans were changed early this
week.

Weathei also permitting, and if
the diamond dries out sufficiently,
the Indians will play McClelland
Field's baseball team this after
noon at 3.

Coach Wolter has indicated that
he will start Bill Brokaw in the first
game and Harry "Doc" Mason in the
second. This will be Mason's first
outing since the middle of last month
when he pitched the Indians to their
initial win of the season in downing
the Coast Guard Surf Riders 6-5.
