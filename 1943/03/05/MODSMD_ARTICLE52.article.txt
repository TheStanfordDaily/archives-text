IF the late Brick Morse, that great California!), were still pouiuling the
keys for a S. F. newspaper, he would probably be pointing out daily
how California was a cinch in the Big Meet.
At the first glance, it would seem that the Blue and Gold was going to
win this year's Big Meet, to be held at Berkeley, with ease. But really,
are they?
Of course, if Stanford is going to win this year, it is dependent on many
an IF. Probably the first big "if" is Grover Klemmer. After playing both
basketball and football this season, the world's 400-meter record holder
m-st get into shape mighty fast if he is to match strides with Johnny
Fulton in either the 440 or the 880.
Some people contend that Klemmer's 440 days are over, due to the leg
muscle he injured next year, and must now concentrate on the 880. Should
he train lor the half mile, he will find the going very tough, for the type
of running done in football and basketball is just the opposite of the long,
free strides of the half mile.
One thing is certain, it Klemmer does run the quarter mile, he won't
break his 40.4 world mark which he holds jointly with Stanford's Bun
Eastman.
Stanfoi (1 is certain to have the services of I'ulton, tor he has been
turned down by the Army. Willard Smith is improving each week. It
is interesting to note that Smith barely made 5 feet !) inches in a
Northern California Sectional meet at Antioch when he was a senior
in high school.
Pitch Johnson's weak spots are the shot and the pole vault. Cal will
be much stronger in the vault, but will be on a par with the Indians in the
shot.
Don Reiss should have a good year, and watch Glenn Ncilsen, who
is bound fo improve rapidly. Reiss learned a lot about running last
year irom Ld llertel, who was truly a good hurdler.
II the Indians enter any relay meets, they should do exceptionally
well in the mile and two-mile events, lor Pitch has a wealth of material
there.
* >;j *
YOU can bet your last eight-point coupon that there will be sports and
sporting programs lor the duration.
U.S.F. just hired Dink Templeton, former Stanford wonder coach of
track and field. This is a new sport for the Dons, and they wouldn't be
entering a new field it they thought that spoils were going to be discon
tinued. They should do well with Dink, for he has what it takes to make
champions.
You're going to have sports if men are going to invest money in a
baseball franchise like the Philadelphia Phillies— the white elephant
ol the maior leagues. Or perhaps Mr. Cox doesn't want to pay any
income tax.
You're going to have sports if such men as Gen. John J. Pershing keep
saying what great builders of men football and combat sports are. The
Army seems to be determined that its men play some type of game, and
they have always favored football.
Stanford will go ahead with its spring football practice, and will in
all probability have a schedule for this Fall. But don't expect the kind of
football you ve been used to. Some of the fellows may go down the field
for passes in a wheel chair, but it's going to be football, and that's what
counts.
What about sports after the war is over?
In the past the age of participants in intercollegiate athletics was be
tween 19 and 22. After the war, it will be nothing at all to see the second
string quarterback, age 25, waiting for a chance to go in to replace the
28-year-old first stringer.
II the age ol the participants is going to be older, then the (|iiality
ol sports should be better. 'I he Finns have sort of proved this with
'laisto Maki and Puaavo Nurmi; the Swedes with Gunnar Maag and
Arnie Anderson; in America by Joe McClusky, Gregory Kite, and
Cornelius Warmerdam.
And, too, if men going into the service go out for service teams, they
are going to get the best in the way of coaching. Then, when they come
back to college, or matriculate at a college, the intercollegiate teams will
be matured, and with the benefit of previous top-notch coaching.

WINCE this is the last epistle of the quarter, and also for good, I would
like to thank several people for their cooperation. First, to Bob Sontag,
former Daily Sports Editor, for his help and suggestions. To Bill Hornby
for covering basketball, and to Ed Luce, the authority on freshman basket
ball and track. Bill (ilikharg did most of the work on murals—whenever
it got in. Bill Rose for special little assignments, and a fine job on Crew.
Dick Kcusink did the features on basketball personalities, run with draw
ings by Carlos Brown. Baseball was ably handled by Mike Kresge. The
rugby writeups were done by Ted Norton.

all probability have a schedule for this Fall. But don't expect the kind of
football you ve been used to. Some of the fellows may go down the field
for passes in a wheel chair, but it's going to be football, and that's what
counts.
What about sports after the war is over?
In the past the age of participants in intercollegiate athletics was be
tween 19 and 22. After the war, it will be nothing at all to see the second
string quarterback, age 25, waiting for a chance to go in to replace the
28-year-old first stringer.
II the age ol the participants is going to be older, then the (|iiality
ol sports should be better. 'I he Finns have sort of proved this with
'laisto Maki and Puaavo Nurmi; the Swedes with Gunnar Maag and
Arnie Anderson; in America by Joe McClusky, Gregory Kite, and
Cornelius Warmerdam.
And, too, if men going into the service go out for service teams, they
are going to get the best in the way of coaching. Then, when they come
back to college, or matriculate at a college, the intercollegiate teams will
be matured, and with the benefit of previous top-notch coaching.

WINCE this is the last epistle of the quarter, and also for good, I would
like to thank several people for their cooperation. First, to Bob Sontag,
former Daily Sports Editor, for his help and suggestions. To Bill Hornby
for covering basketball, and to Ed Luce, the authority on freshman basket
ball and track. Bill (ilikharg did most of the work on murals—whenever
it got in. Bill Rose for special little assignments, and a fine job on Crew.
Dick Kcusink did the features on basketball personalities, run with draw
ings by Carlos Brown. Baseball was ably handled by Mike Kresge. The
rugby writeups were done by Ted Norton.
IF the late Brick Morse, that great California!), were still pouiuling the
keys for a S. F. newspaper, he would probably be pointing out daily
how California was a cinch in the Big Meet.
At the first glance, it would seem that the Blue and Gold was going to
win this year's Big Meet, to be held at Berkeley, with ease. But really,
are they?
Of course, if Stanford is going to win this year, it is dependent on many
an IF. Probably the first big "if" is Grover Klemmer. After playing both
basketball and football this season, the world's 400-meter record holder
m-st get into shape mighty fast if he is to match strides with Johnny
Fulton in either the 440 or the 880.
Some people contend that Klemmer's 440 days are over, due to the leg
muscle he injured next year, and must now concentrate on the 880. Should
he train lor the half mile, he will find the going very tough, for the type
of running done in football and basketball is just the opposite of the long,
free strides of the half mile.
One thing is certain, it Klemmer does run the quarter mile, he won't
break his 40.4 world mark which he holds jointly with Stanford's Bun
Eastman.
Stanfoi (1 is certain to have the services of I'ulton, tor he has been
turned down by the Army. Willard Smith is improving each week. It
is interesting to note that Smith barely made 5 feet !) inches in a
Northern California Sectional meet at Antioch when he was a senior
in high school.
Pitch Johnson's weak spots are the shot and the pole vault. Cal will
be much stronger in the vault, but will be on a par with the Indians in the
shot.
Don Reiss should have a good year, and watch Glenn Ncilsen, who
is bound fo improve rapidly. Reiss learned a lot about running last
year irom Ld llertel, who was truly a good hurdler.
II the Indians enter any relay meets, they should do exceptionally
well in the mile and two-mile events, lor Pitch has a wealth of material
there.
* >;j *
YOU can bet your last eight-point coupon that there will be sports and
sporting programs lor the duration.
U.S.F. just hired Dink Templeton, former Stanford wonder coach of
track and field. This is a new sport for the Dons, and they wouldn't be
entering a new field it they thought that spoils were going to be discon
tinued. They should do well with Dink, for he has what it takes to make
champions.
You're going to have sports if men are going to invest money in a
baseball franchise like the Philadelphia Phillies— the white elephant
ol the maior leagues. Or perhaps Mr. Cox doesn't want to pay any
income tax.
You're going to have sports if such men as Gen. John J. Pershing keep
saying what great builders of men football and combat sports are. The
Army seems to be determined that its men play some type of game, and
they have always favored football.

Eastman.
Stanfoi (1 is certain to have the services of I'ulton, tor he has been
turned down by the Army. Willard Smith is improving each week. It
is interesting to note that Smith barely made 5 feet !) inches in a
Northern California Sectional meet at Antioch when he was a senior
in high school.
Pitch Johnson's weak spots are the shot and the pole vault. Cal will
be much stronger in the vault, but will be on a par with the Indians in the
shot.
Don Reiss should have a good year, and watch Glenn Ncilsen, who
is bound fo improve rapidly. Reiss learned a lot about running last
year irom Ld llertel, who was truly a good hurdler.
II the Indians enter any relay meets, they should do exceptionally
well in the mile and two-mile events, lor Pitch has a wealth of material
there.

YOU can bet your last eight-point coupon that there will be sports and
sporting programs lor the duration.
U.S.F. just hired Dink Templeton, former Stanford wonder coach of
track and field. This is a new sport for the Dons, and they wouldn't be
entering a new field it they thought that spoils were going to be discon
tinued. They should do well with Dink, for he has what it takes to make
champions.
You're going to have sports if men are going to invest money in a
baseball franchise like the Philadelphia Phillies— the white elephant
ol the maior leagues. Or perhaps Mr. Cox doesn't want to pay any
income tax.
You're going to have sports if such men as Gen. John J. Pershing keep
saying what great builders of men football and combat sports are. The
Army seems to be determined that its men play some type of game, and
they have always favored football.
Stanford will go ahead with its spring football practice, and will in
all probability have a schedule for this Fall. But don't expect the kind of
football you ve been used to. Some of the fellows may go down the field
for passes in a wheel chair, but it's going to be football, and that's what
counts.
What about sports after the war is over?
In the past the age of participants in intercollegiate athletics was be
tween 19 and 22. After the war, it will be nothing at all to see the second
string quarterback, age 25, waiting for a chance to go in to replace the
28-year-old first stringer.
II the age ol the participants is going to be older, then the (|iiality
ol sports should be better. 'I he Finns have sort of proved this with
'laisto Maki and Puaavo Nurmi; the Swedes with Gunnar Maag and
Arnie Anderson; in America by Joe McClusky, Gregory Kite, and
Cornelius Warmerdam.
And, too, if men going into the service go out for service teams, they
are going to get the best in the way of coaching. Then, when they come
back to college, or matriculate at a college, the intercollegiate teams will
be matured, and with the benefit of previous top-notch coaching.

WINCE this is the last epistle of the quarter, and also for good, I would
like to thank several people for their cooperation. First, to Bob Sontag,
former Daily Sports Editor, for his help and suggestions. To Bill Hornby
for covering basketball, and to Ed Luce, the authority on freshman basket
ball and track. Bill (ilikharg did most of the work on murals—whenever
it got in. Bill Rose for special little assignments, and a fine job on Crew.
Dick Kcusink did the features on basketball personalities, run with draw
ings by Carlos Brown. Baseball was ably handled by Mike Kresge. The
rugby writeups were done by Ted Norton.
IF the late Brick Morse, that great California!), were still pouiuling the
keys for a S. F. newspaper, he would probably be pointing out daily
how California was a cinch in the Big Meet.
At the first glance, it would seem that the Blue and Gold was going to
win this year's Big Meet, to be held at Berkeley, with ease. But really,
are they?
Of course, if Stanford is going to win this year, it is dependent on many
an IF. Probably the first big "if" is Grover Klemmer. After playing both
basketball and football this season, the world's 400-meter record holder
m-st get into shape mighty fast if he is to match strides with Johnny
Fulton in either the 440 or the 880.
Some people contend that Klemmer's 440 days are over, due to the leg
muscle he injured next year, and must now concentrate on the 880. Should
he train lor the half mile, he will find the going very tough, for the type
of running done in football and basketball is just the opposite of the long,
free strides of the half mile.
One thing is certain, it Klemmer does run the quarter mile, he won't
break his 40.4 world mark which he holds jointly with Stanford's Bun
Eastman.
