# Lipsticked Cigarette Butts

### 
THIS is the last paper this quarter. In a way
♦hat is good and in a way that is bad.
Good in that we are tired. Good in that now
we can write our papers for Professor Winters
and good in that it shows the quarter is drawing
to a close.
Bad in that it is the last male Stanford Daily.
It is only halfway mafk for Volume 103 and
yet, next quarter, it will be a different paper—
a paper that is staffed and put out by women.
Bad also in that we like and believe in The
Daily and when the last quoin is tightened we
are a little sad.
Whatever success The Daily has achieved
this quarter is shared by all. It is a team in
which each member, reporter, copyreader, or
editor shares both the failures and the victories.
Bob Sontag, the managing editor, has been
responsible for the campus coverage. Ferris
Boothe, Bill Steif, and Newton Wise, the asso
ciates, have shared the burden and responsi
bility of putting it out. None will be back.
Bill Coughlin, Dick Keusink, Noel Young,
Dick Fogel, and Bill Hornby, night editors, will
leave to join the Army. We are a little sad.
Next quarter Peggy Boothe, Jane Glasson, and
Lucy Thompson will help edit the paper and a
host of new female night editors will drop lip
stick-covered cigarette butts on floors long
soiled by men.
But masculine or feminine, we hope and trust
that The Daily will continue and that we can
continue to fulfill our duty as we see it.—Hamp
