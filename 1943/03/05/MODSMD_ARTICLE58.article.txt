# A 						Final Tying-up
## 
### 
A LARGE number of seniors are graduating
from Stanford this quarter. Bob Crary,
senior class president, has spent a great deal
of time looking into the possibility of having a
Commencement at the end of finals but due to
cost, the shortness of time, and the intricacy
of having such a large-scale performance it was
impossible.
However, these sons of Stanford will not leave
here without a final ceremony—a sort of tying
together of the threads that have made up col
lege life for almost four years.
The special Baccalaureate Service to be held
Sunday morning, March 14, in the Memorial
Church will do just this. Dr. Wilbur will speak
and Bob Crary and Mary Leonard will also par
ticipate in the service. Bishop Parsons will lead
the service.
Since it is impossible to have a Commence

ment because of the problem of how many we
can have a year with the new speed-up program,
the Baccalaureate Service offers a fitting close
to an education at Stanford.
