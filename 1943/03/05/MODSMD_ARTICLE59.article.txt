# A 						Woman's World

### 
THE war has drained off the manpower of the
nation and left empty drafting boards, type
writers, and test tubes behind it.
If the wheels of industry are to turn and ci
vilian life is to continue even as a semblance of
what we once knew, these positions must be
filled.
It is for the women-to fill them. Stanford has
realized this and has taken steps to help them.
The University has published a booklet, "War
time Program for Stanford Women."
This book is an effort to co-ordinate two views
on education—one, the broad general liberal
arts curriculum, and, two, a hurried prepara
tion for a profession. This little book clearly
shows a woman what fields and courses are
open to her without her undertaking the almost
hopeless task of trying to get order and sense
into the announcement of courses.
Certainly this is a clear indication of Stan
ford's view to the future, especially in relation
to its women students. Maybe this book should
not be just a wartime measure. There seems
to be a need for it in time of peace when educa
tion is less hurried. If such a booklet as this is
continued, maybe fewer elective units would
be wasted on uninteresting, useless courses.

Many Stanfordites walk into Quad rooms
and find the rooms empty with liqhts on. This
is a waste of electricity. It might be a good
idea, particularly in these war days, to save
that electricity, which is a hint to both pro
fessors and students to turn out Quad lights
if they are the last persons to leave the room.
