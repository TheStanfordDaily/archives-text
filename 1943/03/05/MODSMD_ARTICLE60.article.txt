# OUR HASHER SEZ
## 
### 
Come the 19th of March and we will be taking
our last exam at Stanford after seven years of
studying and loafing at this institution. In this
our last quarter of law school we took it upon
ourselves to write a few words several times a
week concerning the state of the world or,
more specifically, of our world which is Stan
ford. But we are now leaving this world to those
who follow, while we go out and follow a fixed
path into the greater world outside. In a few
months we will take and pass the Ohio bar
exam. Then sometime next fall we will go to
work in a reputable law office in Cleveland
where our uncle is a partner. We will work up
in the business, marry, raise a family, die, and
all the rest of the things that make up the normal
white-collar American's life.
But we are sorry to leave the "Farm" and
enter into this stereotyped existence, because
we've had fun here so we think we deserve to
gush a while before leaving.
During the three months we have been writ
ing in this space we have not let our identity
out because it would detract from the point of
the column. Several people have, however,
taken it upon themselves to admit to writing the
column—god only knows why—but they were
not telling the strict truth, since even they did
not know who wrote. The only person who
knew our identity is A1 Hampson, the editor of
The Stanford Daily, and he was too dumb to
remember.
Our only regret as we write these words for
the last time is that we never actually hashed
anywhere. It seems that the name "Our Hasher
Sez" came from an anonymous column appear
ing in The Daily five years ago, which Irvin
Jcrgensen, a Chi Omega hasher and editor of
The Daily, later confessed to writing when he
published the book "Our Hasher's Garbage."
If we too could have actually hashed a few
times it might have broadened our scope, and
given us a more plebeian outlook, which would
have improved the column, if such a thing were
possible. On the other . . .
