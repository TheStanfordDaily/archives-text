# Wilbur Asks Reservists To Enroll
## Bunn Says E.R.C. Will Not Be Called En Masse, But Singly 
### Newton Wise 
All students in the Army, Navy,
Marine Corps, or Air Corps reserves
are urged by Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur to register for Spring Quar
ter and continue at Stanford "up to
the time they are called."
Dean John Bunn said yesterday
Enlisted Reserve Corps students,
who will begin to be called two
weeks after the close of this quarter,
will not be called out en masse but
will receive individual orders. Thus
it is possible for many students to
continue for part of, and possibly
most of, the Spring Quarter.
Army Air Corps Reserves, now
receiving their calls, are being
called individually. Approximately
20 of over 100 in this reserve have
received their orders.
'It appears quite possible," Dean
Bunn said, "for many of these stu
dents to get additional work during
the Spring Quarter."
Others Go July 1
The Naval Reserves, Marine Corps,
and Coast Guard Reserves will not
be called to active duty until after
July 1. All of these students, there
fore, will be able to continue in
registration if they maintain satis
factory scholarship.
Dr. Wilbur's statement:
'"We are not at all sure how long
it will take for Stanford University
to get on a full war basis. We al
ready have been informed that we
will probably have units for basic
training in the Army Specialized
Training Program, also for (1) per
sonnel psychology, (2) area and lan
guage training, and (3) pre-medical
training, in addition to the advanced
engineering unit already assigned to
us. The Stanford Medical School
will go ahead with its present pro
gram, and we think that students al
ready admitted to the Medical
School will be able to continue
there.
'Continue at Stanford'
'"It has been requested that I urge
all students who are now in special
exemption classifications, preparing
for the Army, Navy. Marine Corps,
or the Air Corps, to continue at
Stanford up to the time they are
called.
"In this way their records will be
complete and much more useful in
determining assignments and pro
motions. Reimbursement of tuition
fees will be arranged on liberal terms
as of the date when the student re
ceives his specific call to service.
There may be considerable delays in
some categories, since the units that
are being organized, into which
men are to be absorbed, often have
unexpected demands and change
