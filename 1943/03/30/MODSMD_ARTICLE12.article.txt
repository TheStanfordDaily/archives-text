# Dr. Hao Hears Madame Chiang
## 
### Cyclone Covey 
Decorated with pictures and ban
ners, Chinatown was crowded and
excited over the presence in San
Francisco of Madame Chiang Kai-
Shek, and 9.000 Chinese thronged
the Civic Auditorium Sunday to hear
her speak.
Probably not more than 1 per cent
of this Chinese audience understood
what she said; for she spoke Man
darin, and the population of China
town, being either immigrants or
descendants of immigrants from Can
ton, speaks Cantonese.

Dr. Hao Hsiao of the Stanford fac
ulty, a native of Shanghai, who was
obliged to act as interpretor to those
about him during the speech.
According to Hao, Mme. Chiang
revealed a deep affection for the
United States, and to him, a typical
American point of view. She urged
her Chinese audience to buy war
bonds to help China's ally, and also
thereby to help China.
"Every Chinese must remember
that he is a national of a great coun
try, and must by his deeds demon
strate his motherland's greatness to
America."
Must Understand
She exhorted them not to blame
America for the prejudice against
the Chinese, because, she said.
America was doing her best to over
come it, and the Chinese must seek
to understand it.
She recalled to her hearers that
China has known six years of the
gigantic turmoil, and her experience
can benefit even "our American
friends. But we must not be too
proud." For the aid of Chinese in
this country, she said the people ot
China were grateful and comforted,
Dressed in Black
She urged the principles of the
New Life Movement she and the
Generalissimo introduced in China
years ago . . . clothing clean and
tidy, food clean and nourishing, and
cleanliness in housing. Four moral
precepts she emphasized: Li, Ih
Lien, Chu. roughly translated Pro
priety, Righteousness, Frugality, and
Humility.
Mme. Chiang, Hao said, sat and
stood almost rigidly, with utmdst
dignity, and was dressed entirely in
black—sleeves to handkerchief.

ton, speaks Cantonese.
Faculty Member
At the service of The Daily was
Dr. Hao Hsiao of the Stanford fac
ulty, a native of Shanghai, who was
obliged to act as interpretor to those
about him during the speech.
According to Hao, Mme. Chiang
revealed a deep affection for the
United States, and to him, a typical
American point of view. She urged
her Chinese audience to buy war
bonds to help China's ally, and also
thereby to help China.
"Every Chinese must remember
that he is a national of a great coun
try, and must by his deeds demon
strate his motherland's greatness to
America."
Must Understand
She exhorted them not to blame
America for the prejudice against
the Chinese, because, she said.
America was doing her best to over
come it, and the Chinese must seek
to understand it.
She recalled to her hearers that
China has known six years of the
gigantic turmoil, and her experience
can benefit even "our American
friends. But we must not be too
proud." For the aid of Chinese in
this country, she said the people ot
China were grateful and comforted,
Dressed in Black
She urged the principles of the
New Life Movement she and the
Generalissimo introduced in China
years ago . . . clothing clean and
tidy, food clean and nourishing, and
cleanliness in housing. Four moral
precepts she emphasized: Li, Ih
Lien, Chu. roughly translated Pro
priety, Righteousness, Frugality, and
Humility.
Mme. Chiang, Hao said, sat and
stood almost rigidly, with utmdst
dignity, and was dressed entirely in
black—sleeves to handkerchief.
Decorated with pictures and ban
ners, Chinatown was crowded and
excited over the presence in San
Francisco of Madame Chiang Kai-
Shek, and 9.000 Chinese thronged
the Civic Auditorium Sunday to hear
her speak.
Probably not more than 1 per cent
of this Chinese audience understood
what she said; for she spoke Man
darin, and the population of China
town, being either immigrants or
descendants of immigrants from Can
ton, speaks Cantonese.
