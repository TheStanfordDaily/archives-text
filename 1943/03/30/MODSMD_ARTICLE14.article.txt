Dorothy Maynor, famed Negro so- :
i prano, will be presented by the Stan
ford Concert Series for her second
appearance in Memorial Hall, to- |
morrow at 8:15 p.m. Her perform
ance two years ago excited "bravos" I
from a conservative Stanford audi- j
ence, and she had been called back
this year by popular demand.
Tickets for seats at all prices, ,
$1.10, $1.65, $2.20, $2.75 are now on
sale in the Concert Series Office, Old j
, Union, across from the barber shop, j
Miss Maynor's sensational rise to |
fame is one of the rare success stories I
|in recent musical history. A short
; time ago she was a virtually un
known singer; today she is ac
claimed by critics and music lovers
all over the nation. Miss Maynor
was given her start in 1939 by Serge
j Koussevitzky, conductor of the Bos
{ ton Symphony Orchestra, who rec
ognized her great voice and artistry
j during an informal audition.
On the concert platform, as in her
personal life, the same disarmingly
{ friendly manner, the warm sincerity
I and joy she takes in her music wins
j her audiences even before she begins
j to sing.
The range of her voice is remark
; able, going from brilliant and breath-.

taking high notes to the dark deep
ones characteristic of her race. The
effortless manner in which she pro
duces the most difficult passages is
phenomenal.
Her instinctive skill in interpre
tative expression is the gift of a born
artist. She sings with equal ease in
both French and German; her day's
routine includes an hour's lesson in
French and an hour of German.
The daughter of a Norfolk, Va.,
