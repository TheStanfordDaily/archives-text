### 
LONDON, Tuesday, March 30.—
American-built Ventura bombers of
'he RAF, carrying the new Allied
non-stop aerial offensive into its
fourth day, made their second
straight daylight raid on Rotterdam
today while huge fires still burned
at the St. Nazaire U-boat base which
British bombers battered Sunday
night.
The German DNB news agency
'.'ong-wave radio station left the air
«~.t 10:11 p.m. (Monday) for "tech
nical reasons," its abrupt signing
off suggesting that Allied bombers
were over the continent again to
night.
The medium, Vega-built bombers
crossed the channel with fighter es
corts, striking at industrial objectives
in Holland and the strategic railway
yards at Abbeville, France, as well
as blasting enemy vessels at Rotter
dam, a ship-building center. No
planes were lost.
Striking in weak retaliation, four
German planes attacked a south
coafct town in daylight, bombing a
maternity and child welfare clinic
where at least six adults and three
children were killed. .
