# Marimba Band Will Perform At Fiesta on Thursday Night
## 
### 
The Hurtado Brothers' Marimba
Band, hit of the San Francisco Fair
and one of the world's best and most
colorful marimba bands, will play its
authentic and compelling rhythms
for the Pan American Fiesta Thurs
day night in the Memorial Theater.
Dances from all the Americas—
North, South, Central, and the Is
lands—will be performed by natives
of these countries in this program
sponsored by Sigma Delta Pi, na
tional Hispanic society.
The Hurtado Brothers come from
Guatemala, the home of the ma
rimba. On their European tour they
played for King George V of Eng
land, and for many years their mel
low-toned instruments have been
heard in every large city in the
United States from New York to
Los Angeles.
Under Contract
The Band is currently under con
tract to San Francisco's new Ma
rimba Club, and as the players are
not ordinarily available for outside
engagements, it was only through a
special arrangement with Mr. Celso
Hurtado, director, that the society
will be able to bring the band to the
Stanford Campus for a night.
The drama department and Or
chesis are giving their full support
to the program, the proceeds of
which will go to the Stanford "Dimes
for Diplomas" fund. Tickets avail
able at the Box Office and from mem
bers of the Spanish department, are
(55 cents, including tax. There are no
reserved seats.
Native Dancers
Dancers from almost every region
in Latin America, as well as a North
American group, will participate.
These performers are for the most
part Stanford students. Many of them
appeared in the very successful pro
gram "Dances of the Southern
Americas" which was presented last
summer by the Dramatists' Alliance
and Sigma Delta Pi.
Students from Mexico, Guatemala,
Nicaragua, Panama, Puerto Rico,
Peru, Bolivia, Chile, and Brazil will
participate. Costumes are authentic,
in most cases having been brought

directly from the country concerncd.
The dances are under the general
direction of Jacques Poley Ogg and
Mrs. Miriam B. Lidster, of the de
partment of physical education at
Stanford.
