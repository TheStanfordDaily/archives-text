''All talented persons completing i
the course will be sure to find ready '
jobs," commented Hubert Heffner,
executive head of the Speech and
Drama Department, as he explained
that all good students were placed in
jobs after finishing a similar course
at Northwestern last summer. About
.150 positions vacant in radio could
not be filled.
During the course, students will
watch the growth of programs as
each is developed from an idea to a
script to an actual broadcast, and
their own assignments will be re
corded and played back for criticism
and correction.

ciples of radio today. Because "com
bination men" are demanded today,

trol room operation.

the institute will be distributed this
week, and additional information can
