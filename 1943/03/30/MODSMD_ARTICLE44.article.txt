CHICAGO (UP). â€” "Shavetail,"
nickname of Army second lieuten
; ants, originally referred to an un
i broken mule, according to the Dic-
I tionary of American English now in
preparation at the University of
i Chicago.
The dictionary says the term ori
ginated with the Army and was ap
plied to mules because their tails are
smooth down to the tufted tip. It
later was used with regard to the
second lieutenants because of their
alleged stubbornness.
