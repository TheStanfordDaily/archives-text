# Stanford Crew Morale High In Rehearsal for U.C.L.A. Meet
## 
### 
Passing up the usual spring vaca
tion so that they would remain in
top shape, the Stanford crew pre
pared for their meet with U.C.L.A.,
April 17, on the Bruin's Ballona
Creek course.
During the vacation period Coach
Carl Pedersen had the crew mem
bers row 14 miles a day, while he
followed alongside giving advice.
After several such runs, Coach Ped
ersen acclaimed that "the boys are
really hitting their stride."
Last Friday two eight-man crews,
after the usual 14-mile workout,
staged a three-mile race, finishing
in a dead heat in 14minutes.
Pedersen added that "good time for
a fresh crew at this distance would
be IG. minutes."
The lineups for the two boats were
as follows: In shell 1, Bud Clarey.
stroke: Jack Sagorka, Ned Gates,
Welco Gasich, Burt Avery, Ken
Young, John Weiss, Hal Hopper, and
Coxswain Walt Drake. In shell 2,
Ed Fagan, stroke; Jack Hauser, Joe
Welsh. Dick Bui lis. Bob Hampton,
Tony Medved, Ed Adams, Paul
Schute, and coxswain Merton Price.
Both Jack Sagorka and John Weiss
were new men at the beginning of

the spring vacation, but they im
proved so rapidly that they have
both moved into contention for
starting positions.
As yet no starting crew is settled.
"No matter how much I juggle the
boats, they seem to stay even in
speed," remarks Pedersen. He con
tinues. "A lot of the speed the boats
attain is due to the morale of the
men, and these vacation workouts
have brought it to an extremely high
level." Credit must be given to
Gerry Grunwald who, though re
cently drafted, is still turning out to
give pointers to the new members.
