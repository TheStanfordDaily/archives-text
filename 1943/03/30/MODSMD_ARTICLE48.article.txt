# Sports Program Will Emphasise Conditioning
## Services Call Key Men From Every Major Stanford Team 
### 
Sports and war mix, but not in the old proportions.
With armed service calls siphoning key men away from
every major Stanford sport, coaching staffs viewed the slim
male registrations with a common conviction collegiate ath
letics from now on must be treated primarily as conditioning

classes for those Navy, Marine, andl
uncalled Army reservists still en
rolled.
The new emphasis reared its ex
pected head yesterday when 40 men
reported to Marchmont Schwartz for
football to learn that they were be
ing accepted as prospects for all
around building up, with secondary
consideration to their prowess as
gridsters.
Tracksters Go
Pitch Johnson is kissing several of
his favorite boys goodbye including
topflight hurdlers Don Reese and
Glen Neilsen. spvint-king A1 Hoisch,
Fritz Sanderman, Javelineer Bob
Frisbee, and Buck Fawcett, an em
bryo sprinter who had surgical dis
connections over the vacation.
Minus these, Stanford track com
petition opens at the invitational
meet in San Jose on April 10. Pre
liminary registration for track and
held gym classes was comparatively
strong.
Baseball's Harry Wolter, with 3
wins and 3 losses behind him and his
squad, is pointing for the April 5
clash with the strong U.S.F. Dons.
Uncle Sam has borrowed Bill Bro
kaw, Sandy aßnks, Larry Wolf, and
others to add to the problem.
Tennis took one in the midriff
when Emery Neale, captain and
number one player, was called. The
first match with California is on
April 17. Coach Elwyn Bugge is
faced with the old one of the square
peg and the round hole—Neale's left
the hole and there aren't many more

of his class . . . anywhere.
Fencers Intact
The fencing squad won the North
ern California Open Foil Team
Championships Saturday, outpoint
ing the Olympic Club. 5 to 4. Bob
Heileowell. Harvard Lomax, and
Alan Hedden did the job. All three
are at the moment safe from armed
call.
