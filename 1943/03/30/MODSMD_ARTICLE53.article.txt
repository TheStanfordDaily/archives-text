						Different Stanford

### 
STANFORD will be different this Spring Quar-
C) ter.
Gone to the war will be some 321 young
men. The famed ratio has dropped until it is |
almost even.
Stanford will be a much more intense and
serious place.
The warm, sunny, easygoing springs that
have been "Stanford in the spring" in years
past are gone. A manless campus, heavy sched
ules, and the rationing of food will all force such
a Stanford into the background, behind the
rather uncomfortable presence of the war.
We suppose there is little to say to those in
the Enlisted Reserve Corps who have been
called. It seems to us much like the little child
and the illusion of Santa Claus. The calling of
Ihese young men destroyed the last vestige
of the idea under which they were raised —a
world of peace and happiness, no more war.
It is hard to tell a disillusioned little boy that
the love and kindliness of Santa Claus exist in
his parents' hearts, and it is equally difficult
to tell those who are leaving college and going
to war that peace is an actuality and that it can
be permanent, and the long run benefits of
college.
Since such a message is so difficult, we feel
unable to meet its challenge with a great and
profound truth. To those who are leaving we
can say "best of luck" and ask them to always
remember that Stanford, a source of hope and
opportunity, awaits their return.
