# Some Changes to Be Made
## 
### 
THE A.S.S.U. is without a president. President
elect Jack Reynolds, along with many other
Stanford men in the E.R.C., was given his orders
last quarter to report for active duty on April 5.
According to the constitution of the A.S.S.U.
the vice-president "shall exercise the powers
and the duties of the president until his succes
sor is elected."
Although Jack Reynolds has been called, it
does not mean that the A.S.S.U. is without a
head. In her capacity of vice-president Janet
McClanahan will carry on his duties.
However, the situation of having no male
student body president creates a problem which
must be solved. There are three alternatives
which offer a solution to the problem.
One, to amend the A.S.S.U. constitution to
enable a woman to be president of the student
body.
Two, in the inevitable special election which
will come, to have more nominations from
among those men who are not being called in
the immediate future.
Three, to do away with the student constitu
tional government as we now know it, and put
in some makeshift program for the duration.
This will stop an endless chain of special elec
tions and constitutional changes that the new
conditions will call for.
Either the first or the third plan should be
adopted. The calling of the E.R.C. has cut Stan
ford's manpower badly. The calling of the Navy
and the Marines in July will deplete the re
mainder.

There will be a special meeting of Excom
tonight to eolve this problem. If student con
stitutional government has any worth, it is our
hope that Excom will do justice by it and meet
the problem without the usual smallness, bicker
ing, and time-wasting and eventually arrive at
a good workable solution.
