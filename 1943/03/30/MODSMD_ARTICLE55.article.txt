# The 						Beginning of the End
## 
### 
FIELD MARSHAL Erwin Rommel has again
fallen back as his Mareth Line broke before
the power of the British, the Americans, and the
French.
With such a report as this coming out of
Africa, we cannot help but think of another
Dunkirk, but this time an Axis one and not a
successful one at that.
The United Press called the breaking of the
Mareth Line "the greatest victory of the Tunisian
war." If this is so and not just a glib newspaper
phrase designed to increase street sales in
America, we may hope that this is "the end of
the beginning."
We may picture, without trouble, an Africa
free from the Afrika Korps and a Europe ready
for an Allied invasion. We may picture the
fighting strength of the Allies mounting until
the second front overwhelms and crushes Hit
ler.
Yet this may be just surge and spasm in the
endless tug-o'-war that is desert warfare.
However, if properly seasoned with pessi
mism and seriousness, speculation does no
harm. And, too, six thousand prisoners and a
corresponding amount of booty are not to be
passed by lightly.
Maybe it is "the beginning of the end."
