(Editor's note. — Toward the end of last
quarter we ran an article about the various
cooks on the campus. Among those chosen
as representative was Mrs. Louise Hunt, cook
at the Fiji house.
Through carelessness we did her an in
justice. However, the letter which she wrote
to us is better than any apology that we can
write.)

March 4, 1943
The Editor, Sir:
In your article of March 3rd concerning cooks
of the Stanford campus a grossly erroneous
statement concerning me was made which i feel
should be retracted.
The young lady who wrote the article men
tioned a Negro Red Cross of which I am sup
posedly a member. I am sure this letter was
wholly unintentional, for in times like these the
Red Cross is not a butt for jokes, nor could she
have been so uninformed as to think that such
an organization as a Negro Red Cross existed. I
therefore presume that the error was wholly
unintentional.
To say that there is a Negro Red Cross would
be the same thing as saying that there is a Negro
army. We know that no such thing exists —this
war presents an issue of seriousness to all
Americans, regardless of race, creed, or color.
Although we Negoes are a minority group,
our men now compose one-tenth of the armed
forces of the Unitde States. I, in turn, am proud
to be one of the three colored women belonging
to the Palo Alto Chapter of the American Red
Cross Motor Corps serving my country as best
I can. Although I work full time at the Fiji house
and also keep my home fires burning in what I
consider to be true American style, I am more
than glad to give my time each Sunday to the
Red Cross.
Why? Eecause I am not only a member of
the American Red Cross but also an American,
and I reel that my duty lies wherever I can repay
in the smallest way the privileges and honor
which citizenship in this great country of ours
gives to me.

therefore presume that the error was wholly
unintentional.
To say that there is a Negro Red Cross would
be the same thing as saying that there is a Negro
army. We know that no such thing exists —this
war presents an issue of seriousness to all
Americans, regardless of race, creed, or color.
Although we Negoes are a minority group,
our men now compose one-tenth of the armed
forces of the Unitde States. I, in turn, am proud
to be one of the three colored women belonging
to the Palo Alto Chapter of the American Red
Cross Motor Corps serving my country as best
I can. Although I work full time at the Fiji house
and also keep my home fires burning in what I
consider to be true American style, I am more
than glad to give my time each Sunday to the
Red Cross.
Why? Eecause I am not only a member of
the American Red Cross but also an American,
and I reel that my duty lies wherever I can repay
in the smallest way the privileges and honor
which citizenship in this great country of ours
gives to me.
