# Ratio Nosedives To New Low— It's A Mere 1.13
## 
### 
Despite appearances yesterday in the Administration
Building, 153 more men than women filled out registration
booklets on the first day of registration.
The once famous Stanford Ratio took another decided
drop, along with the total registration, and finally stopped at

► 1.13, a far cry from the three men
to one woman of several years ago.
Total number of persons signing
up for Spring Quarter yesterday wa.-
2,501, as compared with the 3.407
who enrolled a year ago, Spring
Quarter 1942.
Although the long lines of women
which doubled back and forth across
the floor of the Administration
Building and the small lines of men
who obtained their registration
booklets with comparatively prompt
service belie the figures, 1,374 men
and 1,174 women registered.
Last Spring Quarter, 2.190 men
and 1,217 women kept the ratio at
1.7.
Women students, who are coming
more into power, were a little dis
mayed by the maintenance of one
Farm tradition, the four registration
windows for men to the two for
women.
Waiting in line for more than an
hour in the early morning, many
women began to consider their
"equal rights."
Last Winter Quarter 3.188 students
registered on the first day, 687 more
than registered yesterday.
