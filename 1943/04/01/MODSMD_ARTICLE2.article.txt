# NAUTICAL TALENTS TAUGHT
## New Course for Navy, Marine Reserves 
### 
The first meeting of the Navy V-l,
and V-7, under P.E. 151 will be held
tonight in Room 2 of the Education
Building at 7:30. These meetings are
to be lectures by Lt. Comdr. Hallan
on Naval Seamanship and Ordnance.
There will be practical work on
Sunday mornings from 10 o'clock to
12 o'clock at the Palo Alto Yacht
Harbor. It is to be given at this time
because it is the only convenient
time for the Navy at MofTett Field.
Men interested in this course should
meet in front of the Union at 9:45
Sunday morning if they desire
transportation. Lt. (s.g.) Wruke is
to be in charge of the Sunday morn
ing sessions, and he is to be aided by
Chief Gunner Perrucker and various
enlisted men of the Navy. There
will be a charge of Si for transporta
tion and the use of the sea scout
equipment.
Practical Drilling
The Marine candidates are to meet
Wednesday night in Room 2 of the
Education Building under P.E. 152.
There will also be two hours of
practical drilling from 3:30 to 5:30
on Thursday afternoons. This is to
be conducted bv Marine officers. A

Marine Corps Handbook must be
obtained for this course.
The University is withholding
credit for these two courses waiting
authorization from the War Depart
ment permitting Stanford to official
ly give these courses. If the War
Department does not authorize the
Navy and Marine programs, which
is offered Spring Quarter only, Col.
Allen signified his willingness to co
operate to give boys training before
they are called to active duty. If
credit cannot be awarded under P.E.
151-152, he will give it under the

Military Department instead of un
der the School of Health. Slight
changes will have to be made to
these programs in order to be given
credit under the Military Depart
ment. There will be no finals and no
outside work required.
Allen's Plan
The following is Col. Allen's plan
if the War Department will not allow
the School of Health to give the
men credit. The Naval and Marine
classes will meet Thursday after
noons from 1 to 4. Marine and Naval
programs will be essentially the
same as outlined in P.E. 151-152 and
will Ije taught by Col. Allen with
Marine and Naval associates.
Those students interested in re
ceiving one unit credit should attend
these meetings although they are
not yet definitely permanent. Credit
will be decided upon, and the meet
ings previously scheduled shall still
be held.

It lias been announced that
there will be no meeting of the
Navy V-1 and V-7 under P.E. 131
tomorrow atfernoon. The time
and place for this gathering will
l>e announced sometime next
week.
