# Stanford Debaters Win Club Plaque
## 
### 
Jim Kessler and Bill Hornby,
Stanford representatives at the Com
monwealth Club debate held March
5, defeated the University of Cali
fornia team to win the coveted Com
monwealth Club Plaque.
Kessler and Hornby upheld the
negative side of the question, "Re
solved, that the Congress should run
the war and plan the peace," in the
debate which carried on the tradi
tion of annual Stanford-California
clashes on pertinent topics under the
sponsorship of the Commonwealth
Club of San Francisco.
During all the years that the de
bate has been held, Stanford has lost
but one contest, and this defeat oc
curred with a team from U.C.L.A.
rather than from Cal.
Both Kessler and Hornby have
since been called by the Army and
are no longer with the debate de
partmnet.
