# BACKYARD FARMERS
## Are You Having Awful Food? Raise a Duck on Lagunita 
### Barbara Stevens 
When you think about it, Stanford has been stretching a point to call
itself a Farm. There has never been a time when the lease on every acre
hasn't had a clause about "no chickens." Even if ambitious residents had
leanings in that direction they couldn't raise poultry.
But this is war and "in recognition of the unusual conditions" the Uni-

versity has waived the peacetime l
regulations. Now, if everyone fol
lows the rules, we can all buy chicks
and begin.
Enthusiastic farmers, ecquainted
with conventional, liberal farming
ways will be at first perplexed by
the rules. But what price Chicken a
la King or Eggs Benedict from your
own back yard?
It is definitely ordered that chick
ens be kept in pens at all times. This.
( as any chicken lover knows, is an
ideal condition, but often difficult
to attain. Still, if wire can be bought,
high fences can be raised. If the
fence is on the ground then the pen
must be no closer than 100 feet to
j the nearest neighbor's house.
OH' the Ground
For most houses on campus this
i rule makes it practically imperative
that the pen be built off the ground
; until the restriction is let up a bit
i and the neighbor's house needs only
i 50 feet leeway.
Having gotten permission, in writ-
I ing, to begin the venture, and having
! esconced the chicks in their pen, it
j will, it is hoped, be a natural pro
| cedure for all farmers to keep the
pens clean and the chickens fed.
Lest anyone should have illusions
of becoming, in time and with good
management, a poultry dealer on the
side, be it known that the maximum
, number to be within any one per
| son's pen at one time is 24.
No Crowing
Women who have a tendency to
j become attached to pets raised from
adorable, fluffy, yellow chicks should
; note that "Roosters that have
reached the crowing stage must be
disposed of."
Well, it's all in the interests of

â™¦ "
| helping with the war effort and still
I having a little quiet for study. Co
; operate and every day is "Back to
the Farm Day" in earnest with cam
pus students gathering eggs newly
laid by their own chickens. Don't
cooperate, and the University re
scinds this special permission, and
we won't have anything to do but
j study.
