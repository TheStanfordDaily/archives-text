### 
Signup lists for five intramural
sports went up in the gym today, as
Stanford Hall and Row men began
preparations for the biggest mural
quarter since the last World War.
Swimming, softball, hardball,
track relays, and tennis will occupy
the spotlight vacated by basketball,
along with the annual individual
cinder meet which was rained out
last quarter.
Indian mermen will go into action
as soon as all the teams get signed
up, according to Mural Director
Harry Wolter. The aquatic meet
will take two days to be run off.
Usually the top spring sport from
the standpoint of number of entries,
softball will get underway either
Monday or Tuesday. The Breakers
were last year's titleholders.
Hardball play likewise should
start early next week, with not
more than 10 teams expected to
sign up.

Mural tennis this quarter will be
a team affair, with each squad com
posed of two singles palyers and a
doubles team. When the competi
tion will get underway has not yet
been decided.
Wolter indicated the two track
meets, both of which were won last
year by the Zetes, will be run off as
soon as possible. The relays meet
consists of 440, SBO, mile, medley,
and shuttle hurdle baton passing
races. The individual trackfest em
braces the usual list of track and
field events.
