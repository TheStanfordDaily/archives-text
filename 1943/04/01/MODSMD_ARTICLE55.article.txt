# Axis demands French Ships
## 
### 
MADRID, March 31 (U.R)— Ger
man naval authorities have made a
peremptory demand that French
merchant ships idle at three Medi
terranean ports be refitted for im
mediate use and that emergency
crews be found to sail them to Ital
ian ports, advices from France said
tonight.
It was believed that the ships were
earmarked for urgent operations in
the Mediterranean within the next
few weeks and the advices reached
here as speculation increased over
the possibility of an Axis Dunkirk in
Tunisia.
Demand 11 Ships
Advices said that the Germans had
demanded 11 idle French ships at
La Noudelle, Sette, and Marseilles.
Vichy-French crews would sail them
to Genoa and ports in Sicily and
Sardinia where they would be given
full crews, it was added.
A London-made daily mail dis
patch from Madrid said that all
French ships in Mediterranean ports,
immobilized when their crews de
serted after the German occupation
of Vichy territory, were affected and
that about 350,000 tons of ships were
involved.
Toulon Scraps
(CBS heard Radio Dakar assert
that after a thorough investigation
German naval experts had found
nearly all the French warships scut
tled at Toulon were "nothing more
than scraps of steel, absolutely un
usable"; the ships were scuttled
when the Nazis invaded Vichy
France and tried to seize them after
the Allied landing in Africa.)
It was reported here that the re
cent visit of Grand Admiral Carl
Doenitz. new German Naval Chief,
was aimed at obtaining full support
of the Italian fleet, with the Ger
mans directing the ships, in order to
cooperate with Field Marshal Erwin
Rommel when and if he felt it neces
sary to evacuate what could be
saved of his forces in Tunisia.
