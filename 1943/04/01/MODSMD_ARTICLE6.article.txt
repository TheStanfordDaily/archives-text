# Maynor Voice Scores Again
## 
### Cyclone Covey 
However many times one hears
Dorothy Maynor sing, he must al
ways be amazed again at her tre
menduos voice. For she can sing both
| very loud and very soft, both very
high and very low, both dramatical
ly and rollickingly, and ever with a
quality of youthfulness and ma
! tured fullness also.
And despite the intensity with
I which she entered into every selec
j tion, she maintained to her last, and
; ninth, encore (Handel's "O Sleep").
| an untiring vitality.
Though as well received las
night in Memorial Hall as she was
there two years ago, her demeano'.

; minus her regal train. Also, he:
program was weightier, and the se
lections of the second half musically
inferior to those of the first half.
Remarkable Control
In the encores she happily repeat
ed her stand-by specialties, "Were
You There When They Crucified My
Lord?" unaccompanied, and"The
| Gingham Dog and the Calico Cat."
| which have been invariably effective
, wherever she has sung them.
Her rich lieder capacity was best
| evidenced in Wolf's "Zur Ruh, Zur
i Ruh," which would open to conjec
ture that her voice would be ideal
| for the role of Isolde.
The remarkable control of her
tone contrasts is possibly the most
refreshing and accomplished aspect
of her renditions. Such skillful con
j trasts were as striking in Debussy'*>

any other number; at any rate, this

of the program, and none of the
j Debussy nuances escaped revelation
; in Miss Maynor's interpretation.
Spirituals
Naturally, the section of spirituals
was irreproachably sung. But she
I was not as completely in the spirit

in recitals past. In all respects,

flawless dignity of the veteran con

done or better liked than "Annie
Laurie" and Schubert's "Ave Ma
