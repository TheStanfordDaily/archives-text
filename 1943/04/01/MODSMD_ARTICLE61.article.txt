[F there is any item of which there has not
been a shortage on the campus it is reorgani
zation plans to adapt student government to the
changing conditions of wartime. Only last
quarter the student body approved a constitu
tional change to make elections and ierms of
office conform to the four-quarter system.
Before presenting any amendments to the
students at a special election, Excom wants to
get campus opinion on the various proposals.
To obtain opinion and suggestions, the reor
ganization committee will study letters in The
Daily's Campus Opinion column and will be
available for interviews, according to Acting
President Janet McClanahan.
The first plan simply calls for a special elec
tion under the present constitution, which speci
fies that only men can run for the student body
presidency. A second proposal would involve
an amendment to the constitution making it
possible for a woman to be a candidate. If such
an amendment were approved, a special elec
tion would then be held with men and women
eligible to compete.
Advocates of the first plan say that as long
as there are more men in the student body, the
president should continue to be a man. But
supporters of the second system contend that
with the ratio so nearly equal, the women
should be given an equal opportunity to run.
Furthermore, it is doubtful if many men will be
available next year or if successful candidates
would be able to serve the full three quarters
of their terms. With a constant turnover of
offices, student government would lose vital
continuity, and special elections would be con
stantly required.
While making it possible for a woman to be
student body president would solve the prob
lem of that office, it would not correct some
other difficulties. To provide a flexible, effi
cient, representative means of government for
wartime is the intention of the third plan.
The proposed reorganization would be pre
sented to the students as a constitutional
amendment and would go into effect if ap
proved by two-thirds of the student body. Sup
plementing the actual amendment would be a
guide plan, recommending procedure in more
detail.
Under the suggested amendment, the present
constitution would be set aside for the duration
of the war and as long thereafter as deemed
necessary by the President of the University.
Its functions and spirit would be followed as
far as conditions permitted by the student offi
cers.
Governing power would be vested in an
emergency executive committee with the power
of determining the number and qualifications
of its members, election dates and other de
tails of government. Its actions would be sub
ject to the approval of the President of the
University, and the guide plan provides for
further control through the right of students
to petition for a special election or the removal
of any officer.
Should the amendment go into effect, the
remaining members of the present executive
committee would become the emergency com
mittee. They would then call a special election
this quarter to select a new president from men
and women candidates. This new officer would
serve until an "A" election next fall. A "B"

election would be held in summer quarter.
According to the guide plan, the new execu
tive committee would consist of a president,
man or woman; vice-president, woman; two
upper division representatives, men or women
with 75 to 150 units at time of taking office;
two lower division representatives, one man
and one woman with 0 to 75 units; one member
at large; and the present ex-officio members
plus a representative of the armed services on
the campus.
Vacancies on this committee would be filled
by appointments by the president with the com
mittee's approval.
If the president should then leave school,
however, the vice-president would succeed
him. She would then be replaced by an upper
division representative on Excom or the run
ner-up for the office as decided by a three
fourths vote of the executive committee.
In favor of the third plan, supporters point out
that it would adapt its membership to the chang
ing size and character of the student body with
out numerous amendments and special, com
plex changes. The amendment is broad so that
it can serve for the duration, despite new con
ditions. At the same time, the governing body
is properly controlled.
Arguments against it are that the plan is
too flexible and gives too much power to the
emergency committee, for they are no longer
limited by the constitution. Some believe that
the transition at present is impossible and that
the plan should not go into effect until next
quarter.
There are many more arguments for and
against all of these plans. It is important that
students with ideas and opinions present them
to the reorganization committee.—Peggy Boothe

get campus opinion on the various proposals.
To obtain opinion and suggestions, the reor
ganization committee will study letters in The
Daily's Campus Opinion column and will be
available for interviews, according to Acting
President Janet McClanahan.
The first plan simply calls for a special elec
tion under the present constitution, which speci
fies that only men can run for the student body
presidency. A second proposal would involve
an amendment to the constitution making it
possible for a woman to be a candidate. If such
an amendment were approved, a special elec
tion would then be held with men and women
eligible to compete.
Advocates of the first plan say that as long
as there are more men in the student body, the
president should continue to be a man. But
supporters of the second system contend that
with the ratio so nearly equal, the women
should be given an equal opportunity to run.
Furthermore, it is doubtful if many men will be
available next year or if successful candidates
would be able to serve the full three quarters
of their terms. With a constant turnover of
offices, student government would lose vital
continuity, and special elections would be con
stantly required.
While making it possible for a woman to be
student body president would solve the prob
lem of that office, it would not correct some
other difficulties. To provide a flexible, effi
cient, representative means of government for
wartime is the intention of the third plan.
The proposed reorganization would be pre
sented to the students as a constitutional
amendment and would go into effect if ap
proved by two-thirds of the student body. Sup
plementing the actual amendment would be a
guide plan, recommending procedure in more
detail.
Under the suggested amendment, the present
constitution would be set aside for the duration
of the war and as long thereafter as deemed
necessary by the President of the University.
Its functions and spirit would be followed as
far as conditions permitted by the student offi
cers.
Governing power would be vested in an
emergency executive committee with the power
of determining the number and qualifications
of its members, election dates and other de
tails of government. Its actions would be sub
ject to the approval of the President of the
University, and the guide plan provides for
further control through the right of students
to petition for a special election or the removal
of any officer.
Should the amendment go into effect, the
remaining members of the present executive
committee would become the emergency com
mittee. They would then call a special election
this quarter to select a new president from men
and women candidates. This new officer would
serve until an "A" election next fall. A "B"

election would be held in summer quarter.
According to the guide plan, the new execu
tive committee would consist of a president,
man or woman; vice-president, woman; two
upper division representatives, men or women
with 75 to 150 units at time of taking office;
two lower division representatives, one man
and one woman with 0 to 75 units; one member
at large; and the present ex-officio members
plus a representative of the armed services on
the campus.
Vacancies on this committee would be filled
by appointments by the president with the com
mittee's approval.
If the president should then leave school,
however, the vice-president would succeed
him. She would then be replaced by an upper
division representative on Excom or the run
ner-up for the office as decided by a three
fourths vote of the executive committee.
In favor of the third plan, supporters point out
that it would adapt its membership to the chang
ing size and character of the student body with
out numerous amendments and special, com
plex changes. The amendment is broad so that
it can serve for the duration, despite new con
ditions. At the same time, the governing body
is properly controlled.
Arguments against it are that the plan is
too flexible and gives too much power to the
emergency committee, for they are no longer
limited by the constitution. Some believe that
the transition at present is impossible and that
the plan should not go into effect until next
quarter.
There are many more arguments for and
against all of these plans. It is important that
students with ideas and opinions present them
to the reorganization committee.—Peggy Boothe

fies that only men can run for the student body
presidency. A second proposal would involve
an amendment to the constitution making it
possible for a woman to be a candidate. If such
an amendment were approved, a special elec
tion would then be held with men and women
eligible to compete.
Advocates of the first plan say that as long
as there are more men in the student body, the
president should continue to be a man. But
supporters of the second system contend that
with the ratio so nearly equal, the women
should be given an equal opportunity to run.
Furthermore, it is doubtful if many men will be
available next year or if successful candidates
would be able to serve the full three quarters
of their terms. With a constant turnover of
offices, student government would lose vital
continuity, and special elections would be con
stantly required.
While making it possible for a woman to be
student body president would solve the prob
lem of that office, it would not correct some
other difficulties. To provide a flexible, effi
cient, representative means of government for
wartime is the intention of the third plan.
The proposed reorganization would be pre
sented to the students as a constitutional
amendment and would go into effect if ap
proved by two-thirds of the student body. Sup
plementing the actual amendment would be a
guide plan, recommending procedure in more
detail.
Under the suggested amendment, the present
constitution would be set aside for the duration
of the war and as long thereafter as deemed
necessary by the President of the University.
Its functions and spirit would be followed as
far as conditions permitted by the student offi
cers.
Governing power would be vested in an
emergency executive committee with the power
of determining the number and qualifications
of its members, election dates and other de
tails of government. Its actions would be sub
ject to the approval of the President of the
University, and the guide plan provides for
further control through the right of students
to petition for a special election or the removal
of any officer.
Should the amendment go into effect, the
remaining members of the present executive
committee would become the emergency com
mittee. They would then call a special election
this quarter to select a new president from men
and women candidates. This new officer would
serve until an "A" election next fall. A "B"

election would be held in summer quarter.
According to the guide plan, the new execu
tive committee would consist of a president,
man or woman; vice-president, woman; two
upper division representatives, men or women
with 75 to 150 units at time of taking office;
two lower division representatives, one man
and one woman with 0 to 75 units; one member
at large; and the present ex-officio members
plus a representative of the armed services on
the campus.
Vacancies on this committee would be filled
by appointments by the president with the com
mittee's approval.
If the president should then leave school,
however, the vice-president would succeed
him. She would then be replaced by an upper
division representative on Excom or the run
ner-up for the office as decided by a three
fourths vote of the executive committee.
In favor of the third plan, supporters point out
that it would adapt its membership to the chang
ing size and character of the student body with
out numerous amendments and special, com
plex changes. The amendment is broad so that
it can serve for the duration, despite new con
ditions. At the same time, the governing body
is properly controlled.
Arguments against it are that the plan is
too flexible and gives too much power to the
emergency committee, for they are no longer
limited by the constitution. Some believe that
the transition at present is impossible and that
the plan should not go into effect until next
quarter.
There are many more arguments for and
against all of these plans. It is important that
students with ideas and opinions present them
to the reorganization committee.—Peggy Boothe
[F there is any item of which there has not
been a shortage on the campus it is reorgani
zation plans to adapt student government to the
changing conditions of wartime. Only last
quarter the student body approved a constitu
tional change to make elections and ierms of
office conform to the four-quarter system.
Before presenting any amendments to the
students at a special election, Excom wants to
get campus opinion on the various proposals.
To obtain opinion and suggestions, the reor
ganization committee will study letters in The
Daily's Campus Opinion column and will be
available for interviews, according to Acting
President Janet McClanahan.
