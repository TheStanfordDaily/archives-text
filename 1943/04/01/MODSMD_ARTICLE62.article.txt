### Cyclone Covey 
William Saroyan's The Human Comedy,
which has already had an unprecedented ad
vance printing and delivery of 340,000 copies
through the Book of the Month Club, and which
sold for 560,000 as a movie scenario before it
was ever written into a novel, will undoubtedly
be, for its simplicity and hominess, one of the
most widely sold and widely read of any book
ever published.
It is a very good children's book; the only
word a third-grade child (or a third-year Stan
fordite) would not know is "somnolence,"
which incidentally means laziness. And the
book is too short for an adult to grow tired of.
It indulges some dubious metaphysics and
some hopeless naivete; but both are wrapped
in such wholesome optimism that most people
will take them in stride. Things such as a coach
load of soldiers suddenly singing hymns no
body ever heard of, are a little implausible.
But perhaps their very implausibility accounts
for their appeal.
The strongest point in the book's favor is the
creation of the character Ulysses, aged four.
Ulysses does not say much; he is just inter
ested in everything and likes, and is liked by,
everybody. The greatest experience of his life
was the time a Negro hobo singing "My Old
Kentucky Home" v/aved to him from a passing
freight train.
He lives in Ithaca, California, and has a
brother named Homer and a sister named Bess.
Bess obviously should have been named Penny
â€”or Helen, Athena, or Circe.
In the movie, Ulysses is played by one Jack
Jenkins. Homer is played by Mickey Rooney.
Now Homer is supposed to be 14 and runs
the low hurdles in high school. How Mickey
Rooney, who recently was drafted (and re
jected), and a little earlier, married (and re
jected), manages to play a 14-year-old high
school freshman who is just finding out about
life, is going to be interesting.
But if there is anybody over 20 who can act
like a high school freshman, it is Mickey Roo
ney'.
