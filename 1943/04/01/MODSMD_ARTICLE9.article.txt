## 
### 
More than 350 schools are being
offered help in arranging Pan-
American Day programs by the Of
fice of Inter-American Relations in
the Hoover War Library.
Mrs. Maria Hoge, director, states
that requests for suggestions have
come from as far away as Colorado
and Washington, although her regu
lar mailing list of material covers
only California schools.
These suggestions include material
for plays, skits, charts, music, in
formational pamphlets and posters.
While some interest has been shown
by Palo Alto schools, teachers in
other parts of the state have shown
the greatest eagerness to exploit this
mine of material, Mrs. Hoge said.
"La Pampa" and "Los Llanos,"
two sketches which are supplement
ed by costume and other helpful
material have proved particularly
popular.
The Office of Inter-American Re
lations in cooperation with the Pan-
American Union also makes avail
able to schools radio skits, song pro
grams, pageants, and lists of record
ings.
