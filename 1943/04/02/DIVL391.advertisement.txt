Tons of tin!
For \ears telephone cables have been spliced in a very
satisfactorv wav. But the solder joint contained 40 per cent
war-vital tin.
So Bell System men devised a new tvpc of joint illicit
saves up to 80 per cent of the solder. A "V ictorj Joint" they
called it.
The new technique has been adopted the
System v\ith the result that 600.000 pounds of tin and an
even greater amount of lead can he saved in a normal \ear's
construction.
This is another example of the nation-wide cooperation
of Bell System people in fuWillinp; their ideal—sen ice to the
nation in peace or war.
