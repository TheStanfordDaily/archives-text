# BALLOTING
## Excom Acts To Replace President 
### 
To aid the executive committee in
filling the vacant student body presi
dency and reorganizing the system
to take care of future vacancies, a
ballot appeals in today's Daily on
which students are asked to indicate
their opinions on the various plans
suggested.

The ballots may be placed in boxes
located on the English and Engineer
ing corners today from 8 a.m. to 2
p.m. Students who wish to offer
suggestions personally are asked to
see Janet McClanahan in her office
in the afternoon or any members
of the committee.
Committee Members
Serving on the reorganization com
mittee are Ted Eberle, Luana Fork
ner, Phyllis Swing, and Bud Am
brose. Before making their report
they will study the ballots turned in
and any letters on the subject ap
pearing in The Daily's Campus
Opinion column.
Three different methods of select
ing a new student body president
have been proposed. One would fol
low the present constitution and in
volve a special election in which
only men would be eligible to run.
Women Candidates
The second plan calls for an
amendment to the constitution so
that women could become candi
dates in a special election. This
principle is included in the third
suggestion, which also provides that
when a president leaves thereafter,
he is to be succeeded by the vice
president.
