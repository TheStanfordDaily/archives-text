### 
SAN FRANCISCO. April 1 (U.R)â€” j
The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals today denied an appeal by j
Stanford University to recover $260,-
000 invested in the former National
Supply Co. of Delaware.
Reversing a decision of the Fed
eral District Court, the Circuit i
Court held that the Delaware com
pany did not violate the Securities
and Exchange Act of 1933 when it :
merged with the Pennsylvania Cor
poration in 1937.
The University, which held 13,000
shares of 7 per cent cumulative i
stock in National Supply, filed suit
in 1938, alleging that it was not in- |
formed of the pending consolidation.
National Supply Company manu
factured equipment for the petro
leum industry.
The Circuit Court ruled addition
ally that the University must pay
$1,670 court costs.
