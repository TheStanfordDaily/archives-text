## 
### 
WASHINGTON, April 1 (U.R) —
Rubber Director William M. JefTers
told Congress today that synthetic
rubber production should begin pro
viding enough tires by the end of
1943 to keep the nation's 27,000.000
cars rolling.
Testifying before a Senate agri
culture subcommittee investigating
the emergency guayule rubber pro
gram, he said most of the land set
aside for cultivation of the shrub is
being returned to food production,
"because the rubber situation does
not justify taking food crop land to
plant guayule."
He termed the emergency plant
ing "a gamble" and said construction
of synthetic plants, although a little
behind schedule now, should be
caught up by the end of the year.
