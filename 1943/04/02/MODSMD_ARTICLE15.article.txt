# Large Audience Applauds 'Fiesta'
## 
### 
A packed house watched one whale
of a show when the Pan American
Festival took the boards in Memorial
Hall last night.
From the opening "Jarabe Tapa
tio" to the closing "Adios, Mucha
chos," Stanford has never seen such
fun making and devil-may-care.
Carlos Asensio's sets in themselves
drew spontaneous applause, and his
announcing was hilarious, his grace
in the Mexican hat dance, beautiful.
All proceedings were kept at a lively
pace with yelling and handclapping
led by the vivacious Maria Rael.
Every number of the Hurtado Bro
thers' Marimba Band, especially

their encore, "Rancho Grande," wa:
met with a tumultous ovation. Bij
Dan Luksic leading the Argentina
rancheros, Ed Carpenter singing ;
cowboy ballad and calling the square
dance, Bob Hampton on the accor
dion and Bud Clary on the guitar
and Jack Coy singing the finale wit!
the entire cast, were all outstanding
The performers in the North Ameri
can dances, particularly the heel-to»
polka, were almost unbelievably
good.. And in the hot Havana rumb;
scene the suave Grana twins, witl
their gaudily clothed partners
Jacques Ogg and Rosita Pellas, wert
out-and-out terrific.—Covey
