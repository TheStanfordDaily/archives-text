### 
The War Department last week
announced a new program of pre
aviation cadet trainingâ€”for which
draft eligible men between the ages
of 18 and 26 inclusive may volunteer.
In order to speed training of bom
bardiers, navigators, and pilots the
Air Force will send qualified men to
selected colleges under this new plan
for five months before giving them J
regular aviation cadet training.
Before men can qualify for this
program they must pass both the ;
mental screening test of an aviation ;
cadet training board as well as a
physical examination for flying. In
terested persons should contact their ;
nearest Army recruiting office.
