ALLEN vs. DEAN
Latest N.C.A.A. executive com
mittee recommendation that basket
ball leagues rule against players
blocking field goal attempts in front
of the bucket has created quite a
controversy throughout the cage
world.
Phog Allen, Kansas U's vociferous
mentor, told the AP he's against the
new ruling; Stanford's Everett Dean
is in fi vor of the proposal.
.Allen claims that it's not cricket
to limit tall men on defense while
they cm get away with tip-ins on
offense. The Kansas coach says
the whole problem would be
solved if his own pet idea—bas
kets 12 feet above the floor —were
adopted.
Dean, on the other hand, likes the
N.C.A.A. suggestion. The Farm
mentor sums his objection to block
ing potential two-pointers in front
of the basket with "it's not quite
what we want in basketball.'' In
other words, such a practice places
the emphasis on height instead of
skill and shooting ability.
Dean also rejects Allen's 12-foot
basket idea, as do most other men
tors. The Stanford coach feels that
the Coast Conference, for one, will
adopt the N.C.A.A. plan next year.
SHAUGHNESSY TALKS
Recent interviews of Clark
Shaughnessy by S.F. sportswriters
Bill Leiser and Russ Newland
brought out some rather interesting
facts concerning the T-formation
master's latest switch to Pittsburgh.
Shaughnessy, who is in Palo Alto
for the marriage of his daughter,
Maryia, to Ensign Asher Wilson, has
had four different coaching jobs in
as many years. Chicago, Stanford,
and Maryland in turn lost him be
cause a "better opportunity" was of
fered elsewhere.
Pitt's better opportunity" was one
including a raise in salary and a
chance to build another great team
—a combination never before made
available to the smiling Shaugh
nessy.
Clark still claims his Albert-
Kmetovic - Gallamcau - Standlce
combine of 1340 is the greatest
backfield he ever saw. He had
only half of it left in 1941, how
ever. year at Maryland there
was still less to work with.
Pittsburgh, with its "melting pot"
high schools to draw from, is getting
ready for another try at big-time
football after the war. Lots of ma
terial, combined with a salary raise,
gives Shaughnessy a chance to do
the two things he has always wanted
to do: build great football teams,
And make himself and his family
•financially secure.

Phog Allen, Kansas U's vociferous
mentor, told the AP he's against the
new ruling; Stanford's Everett Dean
is in fi vor of the proposal.
.Allen claims that it's not cricket
to limit tall men on defense while
they cm get away with tip-ins on
offense. The Kansas coach says
the whole problem would be
solved if his own pet idea—bas
kets 12 feet above the floor —were
adopted.
Dean, on the other hand, likes the
N.C.A.A. suggestion. The Farm
mentor sums his objection to block
ing potential two-pointers in front
of the basket with "it's not quite
what we want in basketball.'' In
other words, such a practice places
the emphasis on height instead of
skill and shooting ability.
Dean also rejects Allen's 12-foot
basket idea, as do most other men
tors. The Stanford coach feels that
the Coast Conference, for one, will
adopt the N.C.A.A. plan next year.
SHAUGHNESSY TALKS
Recent interviews of Clark
Shaughnessy by S.F. sportswriters
Bill Leiser and Russ Newland
brought out some rather interesting
facts concerning the T-formation
master's latest switch to Pittsburgh.
Shaughnessy, who is in Palo Alto
for the marriage of his daughter,
Maryia, to Ensign Asher Wilson, has
had four different coaching jobs in
as many years. Chicago, Stanford,
and Maryland in turn lost him be
cause a "better opportunity" was of
fered elsewhere.
Pitt's better opportunity" was one
including a raise in salary and a
chance to build another great team
—a combination never before made
available to the smiling Shaugh
nessy.
Clark still claims his Albert-
Kmetovic - Gallamcau - Standlce
combine of 1340 is the greatest
backfield he ever saw. He had
only half of it left in 1941, how
ever. year at Maryland there
was still less to work with.
Pittsburgh, with its "melting pot"
high schools to draw from, is getting
ready for another try at big-time
football after the war. Lots of ma
terial, combined with a salary raise,
gives Shaughnessy a chance to do
the two things he has always wanted
to do: build great football teams,
And make himself and his family
•financially secure.
