# Economist Urges Marine Resource Regulation
## 
### 
"The community of nations must
find a way to regulate the access of
various nations to the marine re
sourses," declared Dr. Jozo Tomase
vich, acting assistant economist in
the Food Research Institute, in his
book "International Agreements on
Conservation of Marine Resources,"
which has just been published by the
Stanford Press.
This is the first in a series of com
modity policy studies by the Food
Research Institute. The second will
be "The World CofTee Economy,"
by Dr. Vernon D. Wickizer.
According to Dr. Tomasevich, ma
rine resources are exhaustible. Tech
nological improvements in the fish
ing boats and in their gear have made
possible far larger catches. With
this increased ability to catch fish
has come increased competition.
This resulted at first in more in
tensive fishing in the original areas
and the opening of new areas. How
ever, even this has not proved suffi
cient and some species have been
almost exterminated.
There are, he says, three problems:
(1) that of scientific research, to
find out how to conserve the marine
resources, (2) that of international
law, since the jurisdiction of the
fishing areas is often widely divided,
and (3) that of development and use
of the fisheries.
The first problem is rapidly being
solved. The second problem, how
ever. is at present unsolved. Since
the majority of the fishing areas arc
on the high seas, they are equally
accessible to all nations, under the

principle of freedom of the seas.
Consequently, international agree
ments are necessary.
There are three methods of con
servation, the closing of nursery
grounds, the institution of a closed
season, and the establishment of an
nual quotas of catch. Of these the
last is the most important.
If an annual quota of catch is
necessary, then, according to Dr.
Tomasevich, "the community of na
tions must find a way to regulate the
access of various nations to these
resources. Although theoretically we
may seek an equitable division of
such resources, in practice the divi
sion will he decided either by the

political power of the countries in
volved, by their particular skill and
economic efficiency in the exploita
tion of marine resources, or by a
compromise between divergent na
tional interests. It seems that only
the last solution can come near to
serving effectively the common in
terest."
Dr. Tomasevich is a former econo
mist of the National Bank of Yugo
slavia. He held a Rockerfeller Fel
lowship from 1938 to 1940 and in 194 L
he joined the staff of the Food Re
search Institute at Stanford.

"The community of nations must
find a way to regulate the access of
various nations to the marine re
sourses," declared Dr. Jozo Tomase
vich, acting assistant economist in
the Food Research Institute, in his
book "International Agreements on
Conservation of Marine Resources,"
which has just been published by the
Stanford Press.
This is the first in a series of com
modity policy studies by the Food
Research Institute. The second will
be "The World CofTee Economy,"
by Dr. Vernon D. Wickizer.
According to Dr. Tomasevich, ma
rine resources are exhaustible. Tech
nological improvements in the fish
ing boats and in their gear have made
possible far larger catches. With
this increased ability to catch fish
has come increased competition.
This resulted at first in more in
tensive fishing in the original areas
and the opening of new areas. How
ever, even this has not proved suffi
cient and some species have been
almost exterminated.
There are, he says, three problems:
(1) that of scientific research, to
find out how to conserve the marine
resources, (2) that of international
law, since the jurisdiction of the
fishing areas is often widely divided,
and (3) that of development and use
of the fisheries.
The first problem is rapidly being
solved. The second problem, how
ever. is at present unsolved. Since
the majority of the fishing areas arc
on the high seas, they are equally
accessible to all nations, under the

principle of freedom of the seas.
Consequently, international agree
ments are necessary.
There are three methods of con
servation, the closing of nursery
grounds, the institution of a closed
season, and the establishment of an
nual quotas of catch. Of these the
last is the most important.
If an annual quota of catch is
necessary, then, according to Dr.
Tomasevich, "the community of na
tions must find a way to regulate the
access of various nations to these
resources. Although theoretically we
may seek an equitable division of
such resources, in practice the divi
