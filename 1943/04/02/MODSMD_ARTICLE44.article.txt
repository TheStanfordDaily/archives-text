# The 						How of Education
## 
### 
EDUCATION is a great force in the world,
but only recently has it been realized just
how great a force it is. Education can indoc
trinate a people or several peoples so that they
will believe anything. It is one of the greatest
forces of propaganda that there is.
Properly used, which from our viewpoint
means education for democracy, it is practically
the only hope of raising the level of the de
mocracy and of so continuing democracy as a
system of government. Improperly used, it is
the foundation of dictatorship.
Practically every plan for post-war organi
zation includes and depends upon the educa
tion of at least Germany, and usually of all of
Europe.
Monday night there will be a panel discussion
in the Education Auditorium on Education and
International Understanding. Four professors
will discuss a program for international educa
tion, education for Germany, and the "policing"
of education. They are authorities. In words of
one syllable, they know what they are talking
about. It would be well worth the while of any
student to go hear them.â€”Lucile Thompson
