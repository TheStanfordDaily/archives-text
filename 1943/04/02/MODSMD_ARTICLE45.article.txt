# Let's Know Stanford
## 
### 
NEXT Wednesday night the A.S.S.U. is spon
soring an Activities Forum, designed to
clarify and co-ordinate in the minds of the gen
eral student body as well as to bewildered
B.M.'s and B.W.'s, the policies new campus
officers are following in this tumultuous, slight
ly chaotic wartime period.
This is the second such "Know Stanford"
forum to be held and, -in view of the present
rapid turnover in student body offices and ac
tivities, seems the more vital.
Open to everyone, the Forum will attempt to
interpret the functions of all campus organiza
tions, their relationships to each other, and their
relationships to the war effort —important bits
of information to remember if continuity of
effort and energy is to be maintained by suc
ceeding executive groups.
This year, too, the Forum is of added impor
tance to Stanford's women, who have already
begun to take over the administration of vari
ous phases of student activity.
As Army, Navy, Marine and Air Corps pro
grams are speeded up and more men leave the
University or become too busy to participate in
extracurricular affairs, this gradual infiltration
of women will probably reach flood proportions.
And the women might as well be prepared to
carry on and keep a semblance of campus life
on the fire until the men return.—Jane Glasson
