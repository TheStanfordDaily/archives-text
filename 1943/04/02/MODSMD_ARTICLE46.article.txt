AT the bottom of the front page today there
is a ballot. This isn't a regular election
ballot. It is a means by which Excom hopes to
find out what Stanford students think and want
for their student government since, due to the
war, its present form cannot be easily retained.
So, when you've read your Daily today, tear
off that part of the front page, fill it in, and put
it in a box on one of the corners. It only takes
a little time, but it will do a lot to help Excom
find out what the students want done.—Lucile
