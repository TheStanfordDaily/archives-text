# BULL SESSION

### Cyclone Covey 
The final rehearsal for last night's Pan Amer
ican Festival was to take place in Memorial Hall
at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon. So wonder
ing what a final rehearsal of a Pan American
Festival would be like, I trekked over to the
auditorium to watch.
Along about 1:30 a small group of Latin
Americans gathered about the piano where it
had not been moved since Dorothy Maynor's
concert, and leisurely and unconcernedly con
versed a while.
It was nearly 2 when Bob Hampton and Bud
Clary ambled on stage with an accordion and
a guitar respectively, and proceeded to accom
pany the carefree Jack Coy, who was learning
his song "Adios Muchachos."
Then Carlos Asensio happened along with a
guitar, and with this more or less extemporane
ous three-piece orchestra accompanying, he
burst beautifully into the strains of "Las Ma
nanitas," and a little brunette, Maria Rael,
twirled a few steps in the Mexican hat dance.
Jacques Poley Ogg, in slacks, came up the
aisle and said that since the marimba band had
not yet arrived, she was going to teach her
class; and she did.
"Aren't you going to have a dress rehearsal?"
I asked Rene Paz.
"No," he was almost surprised, "we haven't
got time."
About at this point, there entered on the scene
our scholar from Chile, Danilo "Nitrate" Luksic.
(You may know his blonde aunt, Lupe "Per
oxide" Luksic.) Danilo showed me around the
show's sets in the wings, and pretty soon Char
lotte Cecil flitted gracefully in in a green folk
costume, and seated herself on the floor.
"Here we are a few hours from performance,"
Danilo said nonchalantly, "and the finale is not
yet devised."
"But we have an idea," said Charlotte.
By now the three instrumentalists on stage
had forgotten all about their rehearsing, and
were swinging out with "Dinah." Danilo went
over and straddled a chair, and they all joined
in a rousing Spanish song.
Then Hampton played a tango while I waltzed
with Charlotte, till Carlos cut in and tangoed
while Hampton played a waltz.
And finally, invention of a skit began, al
though three of the six who were to take part
in it were not present.
By 3 o'clock the marimba band had still not
arrived, and in fact, no other performers had
shown up, and a large part of the program had
only begun to be practiced this week.
When I left I was convinced it would be a
great Fiesta. Of course some of the performers
might not appear till the entertainment was well
under w;:", and they might not have a clear
idea of \\ it they would do in the program.
But who would mind? That is the way they
do things in Latin America.

class; and she did.
"Aren't you going to have a dress rehearsal?"
I asked Rene Paz.
"No," he was almost surprised, "we haven't
got time."
About at this point, there entered on the scene
our scholar from Chile, Danilo "Nitrate" Luksic.
(You may know his blonde aunt, Lupe "Per
oxide" Luksic.) Danilo showed me around the
show's sets in the wings, and pretty soon Char
lotte Cecil flitted gracefully in in a green folk
costume, and seated herself on the floor.
"Here we are a few hours from performance,"
Danilo said nonchalantly, "and the finale is not
yet devised."
"But we have an idea," said Charlotte.
By now the three instrumentalists on stage
had forgotten all about their rehearsing, and
were swinging out with "Dinah." Danilo went
over and straddled a chair, and they all joined
in a rousing Spanish song.
Then Hampton played a tango while I waltzed
with Charlotte, till Carlos cut in and tangoed
while Hampton played a waltz.
And finally, invention of a skit began, al
though three of the six who were to take part
in it were not present.
By 3 o'clock the marimba band had still not
arrived, and in fact, no other performers had
shown up, and a large part of the program had
only begun to be practiced this week.
When I left I was convinced it would be a
great Fiesta. Of course some of the performers
might not appear till the entertainment was well
under w;:", and they might not have a clear
idea of \\ it they would do in the program.
But who would mind? That is the way they
do things in Latin America.
The final rehearsal for last night's Pan Amer
ican Festival was to take place in Memorial Hall
at 1 o'clock yesterday afternoon. So wonder
ing what a final rehearsal of a Pan American
Festival would be like, I trekked over to the
auditorium to watch.
Along about 1:30 a small group of Latin
Americans gathered about the piano where it
had not been moved since Dorothy Maynor's
concert, and leisurely and unconcernedly con
versed a while.
It was nearly 2 when Bob Hampton and Bud
Clary ambled on stage with an accordion and
a guitar respectively, and proceeded to accom
pany the carefree Jack Coy, who was learning
his song "Adios Muchachos."
Then Carlos Asensio happened along with a
guitar, and with this more or less extemporane
ous three-piece orchestra accompanying, he
burst beautifully into the strains of "Las Ma
nanitas," and a little brunette, Maria Rael,
twirled a few steps in the Mexican hat dance.
Jacques Poley Ogg, in slacks, came up the
aisle and said that since the marimba band had
not yet arrived, she was going to teach her
class; and she did.
"Aren't you going to have a dress rehearsal?"
I asked Rene Paz.
