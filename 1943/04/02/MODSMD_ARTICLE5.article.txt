# SPRING SHOW
## Tryouts Start For Melodrama 
### 
A heart-stirring and laugh-pro
ducing melodrama, "No Mother to
Guide Her," has been chosen by
Ram's Head for production, together
with oleo acts, as the annual Spring
Show on May 14, and 15.
Tryouts for acting parts in the
authentic melodrama written in the
'90's by Lillian Mortimer will be
held next Wednesday and Thursday
from 2 to 5, and from 7:30 to 10 p.m.
in the Ram's Head room in the base
ment of Memorial Auditorium.
Oleo acts and specialty solos, to
be presented between acts, will also
be tried out at this time.
Tryout Own Numbers
Director Gordon Gibb has asked
that tryoutees work up their own
numbers. Anything in keeping with
the melodramatic theme will be tried
out, and persons such as juggling,
tumbling, and musical artists are
especially desired.
"We'd like to hear solos on such
old songs as 'She's More To Be
Pitied Than Censored,' and 'She's
Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage'," re
marked Gibb.
Barber shop quartets and groups
of women singers are also needed.
Ram's Head Points
"There are good parts for both
men and women in 'No Mother to
Guide Her'," the director added, "and
of course anyone working on any
angle of the show will receive points
towards membership in Ram's
Head."
People interested on working on
the stage crew and on costumes,
makeup, properties, and scenery con
struction should also attend Wednes
day or Thursday tryouts to sign up.
