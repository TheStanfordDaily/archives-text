# Navy To Honor Five Brothers
## 
### 
A new destroyer will be christened
"The Sullivans" by Mrs. Thomas F.
Sullivan, mother of the five Sulli
van brothers who were lost in action
when the U.S.S. Juneau went down
in the South Pacific. The launching
ceremonies will take place on Sun
day in the San Francisco yards of
the Bethlehem Steel Corporation.
It will be the first time that a j
naval vessel has been named for
more than one person. Destroyers i
are usually named for Congressmen
or naval heroes.
Broadcast of the ceremonies will
be carried exclusively over KGO
and the Pacific Coast Blue Network
from 11:15 to 11:45 a.m., P.W.T.
