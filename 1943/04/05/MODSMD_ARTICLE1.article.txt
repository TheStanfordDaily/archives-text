# Women to Pledge Monthly War Work
## 
### 
Today the Stanford War Board is presenting a plan which will require
all women on campus to pledge themselves to do at feast eight hours of
war work each month.
This program was planned because of the need for additional war
work. For instance, the Red Cross Surgical Sressings Workroom was 681
dressings short of their quota last week. All of the dressings now being
made may be sent to the Army and will go overseas. Due to a shortage of
workers, however, the campus workroom did not fill its quota.
This is only one instance of the need for war workers. In addition,
there is a local labor shortage which is just as important as the war work.
Consequently, for the purposes of this program, both will be termed war
work.
While there does not seem to be any immediate demand for agricul
tural labor until Summer Quarter, the "Y" is prepared to offer a course
to train students to act as counselors in harvest camps during the summer
as well as to train them in the techniques of crop picking. This course will
be counted as war work as well as any hours which may be spent in
emergency work during this quarter.
Any work which relieves the local labor shortage will also be con
sidered war work. This means hashing jobs, clerical work for any of the
departments or associations, and care of children, to name only a few, will
be counted. The "Y" will also, if there is a demand for it, give a course in

the care of children to prepare students to care for war workers' children.
All hours spent in the Red Cross Surgical Dressings Workroom will,
of course, count, as well as all hours spent in Red Cross courses, such as,
Staff Assistant, Motor Corps, and Canteen, and hours spent in work as a
Nurse's Aide.
Hours will be counted for USO work. Work done at the Hospitality
House in Palo Alto, in Faculty entertainment on campus, and in enter
tainment at Page Mill will be counted. The "Y" will offer a course in USO
work again this quarter.
All war courses, such as courses in Civilian Defense, will be counted.
Hours spent in volunteer work in the War Board Office, on committee
work dealing with the war effort, such as the Blood Bank, or on drives,
such as Salvage and Stamps, will also be counted.
The whole program will be on an Honor Code basis. There will be
no other means of enforcing it. The War Board will, however, keep a
record of the hours pledged and the hours which were actually worked.
The plan will be presented to the War Board Auxiliary when it meets
at 1 p.m. today. If the Auxiilary passes the plan, the members will be given
cards to distribute to the members of their living groups. The members
will then indicate on the cards the type of work and the number of hours
which they will pledge. On Tuesday the cards will be returned to the War
Board Office where they will be filed.

Hours spent in volunteer work in the War Board Office, on committee
work dealing with the war effort, such as the Blood Bank, or on drives,
such as Salvage and Stamps, will also be counted.
The whole program will be on an Honor Code basis. There will be
no other means of enforcing it. The War Board will, however, keep a
record of the hours pledged and the hours which were actually worked.
The plan will be presented to the War Board Auxiliary when it meets
at 1 p.m. today. If the Auxiilary passes the plan, the members will be given
cards to distribute to the members of their living groups. The members
will then indicate on the cards the type of work and the number of hours
which they will pledge. On Tuesday the cards will be returned to the War
Board Office where they will be filed.
Today the Stanford War Board is presenting a plan which will require
all women on campus to pledge themselves to do at feast eight hours of
war work each month.
This program was planned because of the need for additional war
work. For instance, the Red Cross Surgical Sressings Workroom was 681
dressings short of their quota last week. All of the dressings now being
made may be sent to the Army and will go overseas. Due to a shortage of
workers, however, the campus workroom did not fill its quota.
This is only one instance of the need for war workers. In addition,
there is a local labor shortage which is just as important as the war work.
Consequently, for the purposes of this program, both will be termed war
work.
While there does not seem to be any immediate demand for agricul
tural labor until Summer Quarter, the "Y" is prepared to offer a course
to train students to act as counselors in harvest camps during the summer
as well as to train them in the techniques of crop picking. This course will
be counted as war work as well as any hours which may be spent in
emergency work during this quarter.
Any work which relieves the local labor shortage will also be con
sidered war work. This means hashing jobs, clerical work for any of the
departments or associations, and care of children, to name only a few, will
be counted. The "Y" will also, if there is a demand for it, give a course in

the care of children to prepare students to care for war workers' children.
All hours spent in the Red Cross Surgical Dressings Workroom will,
of course, count, as well as all hours spent in Red Cross courses, such as,
Staff Assistant, Motor Corps, and Canteen, and hours spent in work as a
Nurse's Aide.
Hours will be counted for USO work. Work done at the Hospitality
House in Palo Alto, in Faculty entertainment on campus, and in enter
tainment at Page Mill will be counted. The "Y" will offer a course in USO
work again this quarter.
All war courses, such as courses in Civilian Defense, will be counted.
