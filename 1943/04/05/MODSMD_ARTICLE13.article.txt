# FORUM
## Activities Talk Set Wednesday 
### 
When the last of the straggling
E.R.C. members pull out for induc
tion posts today the campus will re
alize what the new ration really
means. For bewildered presidents of
depleted organizations, or for chair
men who don't know whom to con
tact to get started on the quarter's
activities, or just for bewildered
members, the Know Stanford Forum
is scheduled for Wednesday night
at 7:30 in Room 2 of the Education
| building.
Officers from every organization
on campus will have a chance to de
clare the importance of their group
and answer questions from the floor.
Janet McClanahan, student body
| vice-president, will be mistress of
J ceremonies at the event which is
I being sponsored by the A.S.S.U.
