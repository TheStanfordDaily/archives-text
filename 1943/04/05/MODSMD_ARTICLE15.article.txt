# Frosh Class Scroll Nears Completion
## 
### 
Of the four class scrolls which are
now being signed in the A.S.S.U.
office, the scroll of the class of '46
is nearest completion. The seniors
have signed half of theirs and the
other two are only a third of the way
filled.
The signing of the scrolls began
last quarter, the idea being to have
one scroll representing the classes
as they stand now and another at
the time of graduation. The scrolls
may be signed at any time at the
A.S.S.U. office during this quarter.
