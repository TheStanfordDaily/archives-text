## BASEBALL TEAM Wolter Still Lacks Starting Lineup for U.S.F. Game Today 
### 
Stanford Baseball Coach Harry Wolter was at a loss yesterday to an
ounce a starting lineup for the Farm's first conference game of the year
lis afternoon in Seals' Stadium with the University of San Francisco.
At the start of the practice season, Wolter had a seasoned team of vet
cans, but with the opening of the present quarter, he found that the squad

ad been riddled by aimed service
dls.
Latest victim is Ray Hammett,
?gular first baseman for the past
vo years, who received his orders
aturday night. This leaves only
itcher Ward Walkup, shortstop Bob
l'own, and pitcher Doc Mason as
le remaining regulars.
elief Pitcher
Mason will probably get the start
lg call against the Dons at Seal
tadium, and if a relief pitcher is
ceded, the job will undoubtedly
til to Jack Miller. Bernard Woody,
'hum Wolter was counting on to
olster the hurling staff, has re
vived his orders, and will report to
t. Logan on the 13th.
Coach Fitzgerald of U.S.F. is hav
ig his own troubles. Only two men
-om his entire last year's squad, Ed
tanna, first baseman, and Con Denip
sy, pitcher, have returned. He was
ven forced to turn outfielder Frank
ioland into a catcher when his first
[ring backstop was injured. Stan
>rd will find itself in the same situ
tion. only worse, if anything hap
ens to catcher Walkup, Wolter
inted.
So far this season the Dons have
layed six games, losing five and
efeating St. Mary's for their lone
ictory 7-6. Their worst defeat came
( the hands of California when they
'ere snowed under by a 21-1 score,
Defense
The reason for the Don's failure
> win games is attributed to a
ather weak defense, for at bat, the
.â€¢ore book tells a different story,
ix of the first nine batters have
een hitting well over the ~'5OO mark
lis season.
