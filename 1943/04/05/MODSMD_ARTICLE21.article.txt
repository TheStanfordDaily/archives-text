# Eight-Hour Month
## 
### 
THIS afternoon a plan of vital concern to every
woman on the campus will be presented to
Women's Conference for vote. Perhaps even
more important than the effects it would pro
duce on individuals' working programs, is the
boost it can give to Stanford's all-out participa
tion in the war effort.
The War Board has proposed that every
woman student pledge eight hours of war work
a month. Their meaning of "war work" is broad.
It includes any class or activity which helps us
prepare for, contribute to, or directly participate
in any phase of the present emergency. Rolling
bandages for the Red Cross, selling war stamps
and bonds, assisting in nursery centers, and
harvesting crops are all war work.
Eight hours a month, two hours a week is
not too much to ask of any woman student. A
large number, though certainly not a majority,
are already contributing more time. Nurse's
aides, students in USO courses and Red Cross
training programs will have no trouble in
doubling the proposed required time each
month.
War work has to be done, and doing war
work is the women's chance to help. Rarely
would the value of activity outside of class
rooms be disproved, and rarely would one
criticize college participation in wartime spe
cialized activity.
The War Board's program would insure the
execution of vital jobs by the women with the
least possible burden on the individual. It
would shift some of the weight of material ac
complishment from the shoulders of a few and
give all a chance to feel responsible for the fine
record Stanford can have.
This eight hours a month proposition looks
like a sure thing.—Jane Glasson
