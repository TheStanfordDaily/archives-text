# On Mondays and Dimes
## 
### 
TODAY is Monday, a doubtless truism, but
today and every Monday for the rest of the
quarter will take on adequate significance to a
group of students, one or more in every living
group, who concern themselves with a particu
lar phase of the war effort.
Beginning today, Mondays will be Dimes for
Diplomas days.
Enough has been said about the merits of
this particular drive peculiar to Stanford. For
over a year, this drive has been a regular fea
ture of each quarter, gaining momentum in ap
peal. Last quarter the returns were especiallv

gratifying, and now enough dimes have been
contributed by students enrolled in Stanford
to provide six post-war scholarships.
This means that six men having to leave the
University for the armed forces will be able to
return to school, for an additional quarter at
least, at the expense of a good many dimes and
a lot of faith contributed by their one-time class
mates.
Total enrollment has declined this quarter,
reaching a new low. This might mean that the
total number of dimes contributed might like
wise diminish. But somehow, this seems to be
the quarter for those who remain to more defi
nitely realize the values of a complete educa
tion. At least this is the hope of those who will
today and every Monday solicit for dimes.
If we all remember to think of our friends
who were here, and who wanted to stay here
enough to come back, it won't be very hard to
remember Dimes for Diplomas.â€”Jane Glasson
