# BULL SESSION

### 
The San Francisco Symphony's all-Beetho
ven concert in the Opera House Saturday night,
though it was an inevitable success because of
the Fifth Symphony and the middle movements
of the Seventh, and though it ended with a
festive "Happy Birthday" to Pierre Monteux,
got off to a disappointing start with a poor selec
tion: the "Great Fugue," opus 133.

This major error in the composing career of
Beethoven is fairly inferior as the finale of the
B flat guartet, opus 130, which it was originally
intended to be; but tackled by the full string
section of an orchestra, it results in some of the
most ungodly commotion you will hear from
compositions antedating Schoenberg and post
war Stravinsky.

Yet the estimable Alfred Frankenstein said
last week, "The 'Great Fugue' is really the only
guartet movement of Beethoven that sounds
well when played by all the strings of a big
orchestra." This is the most amazing utterance
of Frankenstein since he claimed Delius' "Sea
Drift" was a great work of music.

For the "Great Fugue," in fact most any
fugued quartet movement, is perhaps less adapt
able to the larger medium than any other type
of quartet music. Probably the only quartet
movements which do not lose in their adapta
tion to full string orchestra are those with a
dance character, or the lyric, usually folk
melodic, movements, such as Tschaikowsky's
"Andante Cantabile."
It is not the most technical, but the least tech
nical, works, which are suited to a large string
assemblage. And the "Grand Fugue" is highly
technical.
Other quartet movements than this "Great
Fugue" of Beethoven, Frankenstein goes on to
say, "sound strained and unhappy in the bigger
mediums." Actually, you will seldom see musi
cians playing so forcedly as the symphonymen
struggling with the "Great Fugue" Saturday
night; the selection sounded definitely sti\ .led,
and if not unhappy, decidedly distressing.
