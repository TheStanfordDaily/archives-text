# DIMES
## Drive To Start On Quad Today 
### 
The collection of dimes for the
Dimes for Diplomas drive will begin
again today, according to Cally
Curtis, drive chairman. The dimes
i collected are invested in war bonds
which will provide tuition for those
j men returning from war to finish
' schol. The results of today's drive
1 will be published in Tuesday's Daily.
Because some of the men's eating
i clubs are no longer in existence, it
has become difficult to follow an or
ganized plan to collect dimes from
the hall men. To remedy this situa
tion, there will be increased collec
tion on the quad, and everyone who
is not regularly contacted should re
member to contribute to the fund by
i giving their dimes on the English
j or Engineering Corner. Other chair -
! men are: Lagunita, Ann Godwin:
Roble. Ann Robinson; Union Unit.
Ann Wendling; Ventura. Marion
Willard; Sororities, Peggy Allen:
Upper Row for fraternities. Bruce
Meyer; and Lower Row, John Bru
! die.
