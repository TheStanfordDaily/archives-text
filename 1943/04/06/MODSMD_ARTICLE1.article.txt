making a portentous first raid on
continental Europe from French
Africa have battered the harbor of
Naples and. with other American
planes, have sunk or damaged prob
ably 35 Axis vessels in surrounding
waters, it was disclosed tonight.
Fortresses hit Naples Sunday with
four times the bomb tonnage in any

of 97 lined up on the field.
The Fortresses maintained the
Liberators' record of never having
lost a plane at Naples.
The Tunisian land fighting mean
while was swelling to a new phase
as Briitsh artillery opened an inten
sive barrage on the north front in
possible preparation for a major
push. American forces in the El
Guettar sector renewed their at
tack toward the sea and gained some
ground after beating off counter as
saults.

with what seemed now to be the
closing phases of the Tunisian cam

conference to interfere.

ALLIED H.G., North Africa, April
5 (U.R)—Nearly 100 Flying Fortresses
making a portentous first raid on
continental Europe from French
Africa have battered the harbor of
Naples and. with other American
planes, have sunk or damaged prob
ably 35 Axis vessels in surrounding
waters, it was disclosed tonight.
Fortresses hit Naples Sunday with
four times the bomb tonnage in any
of five previous raids by American
Liberators from the Middle East.
The concentrated 15-minute raid
overwhelmed Naples' ground and
fighter defenses, official dispatches
said. Then the bombers attacked
the big Cappo de Chino Airdrome
and damaged 27 planes from a total
of 97 lined up on the field.
The Fortresses maintained the
Liberators' record of never having
lost a plane at Naples.
The Tunisian land fighting mean
while was swelling to a new phase
as Briitsh artillery opened an inten
sive barrage on the north front in
possible preparation for a major
push. American forces in the El
Guettar sector renewed their at
tack toward the sea and gained some
ground after beating off counter as
saults.
Fv.A.F. HITS KIEL
LONDON, April 5 (U.R)—A great
fleet of four-engined R.A.F. bombers,
possibly between 700 and 800, at

Kiel last night, and today American
precision bombers, prolonging the
greatest air offensive of all time,
struck German war factories in Ant
werp. Belgium.
American-built Ventura bombers
of the R.A.F., with fighter escort,
bombed the docks and shipping at
Brest, France, this afternoon in an
other action.

both as to planes involved and the
targets hit.
DeGAULE DELAYED
LONDON, April 5 (U.R)—General
Dwight D. Eisenhower. Allied com
mander-in-chief in North Africa,
has asked Gen. Charles de Gaulle
to delay his visit to Africa. Fighting
French announced tonight.
It was believed here that Eisen
hower's request was due to practical
consideration, that he and General
Giraud, the French African leader
were almost entirely preoccupied
with what seemed now to be the
closing phases of the Tunisian cam
paign and did not want the compli
cation of a delicate French political
conference to interfere.
