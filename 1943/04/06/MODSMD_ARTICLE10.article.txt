doesn't adore the girl, Betty Watten
berger, but flatly tells her that she
is exactly the kind of girl he doesn't
want to marry.
Confides in Mother
In spite of this, he finds he is in
love with her. When he confides in
her mother, played by Joyce Hen
derson, she reverses all conventions
of the stage by advising the young
man not to marry her daughter. ,
Other love interest is supplied by
the young son of the Sullivan family
who falls in love with a procession
of girls, about one to an act. There
is a new girl in the offing as the j
final curtain falls.
In other ways the Sullivan family
achieves unconventional action. A
young son payed by Bill Hawkes has
great talent as a singer, but doesn't
want to be a success.
