## Hardy Leads 'Double Life' 
### 
Andy Hardy is getting ready to
leave for college in his latest, "Andy
liardy's Double Life," now playing
at the Stanford Theater. The prep
aration for leaving involves writing a
check to get his convertible from a
New York garage to go to school and
the sale of his jalopy to prevent the
check from bouncing.
Polly Benedict also decides to make
up with him before he goes away
to school, but fearing that she is
taking him much too seriously, he
asks his sister how to discourage all
his admirers. Marion supplies the
necessary material, but poor Andy
finds that Polly has a house guest,
played by Esther Williams, a swim
ming champion of southern Califor
nia. She is a psych major who starts
practicing her psychology and makes
him forget his new approach. This
practically leads to double engage
mentâ€”one to each girl. But in re
ality they have only been teaching
him not to try the same line on every
girl.
This is a typical Hardy picture,
with the true family scene and emo
tion depicted. Rooney's facial con
tortions are amusing and are worth
the price of admission. The second
feature is "The Silver Queen." star
ring George Brent and Priscilla
Lane.
