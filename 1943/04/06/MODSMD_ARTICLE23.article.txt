# Good Soldiers and Bad
## 
### 
MAYBE you happened to go down to the
Southern Pacific Station yesterday to see
the boys off. Lots of them went.
The first of Stanford's E.R.C. men have left.
In an Army of over five million men, it doesn't
make much difference, but it does take quite a
cut out of Stanford.
Some of Stanford's men will make fine sol
diers and become good officers. Others will
make poor soldiers. Some will be happy, others
will never become adjusted to the Army and
Army life. Some will thrive on K.P. duty, others
won't.
Some will never get out of the United States.
Others will go over seas and return. Some will
never return.
If they make poor soldiers or good soldiers;
go overseas or stay in the Monterey Presidio,
with them will go our best wishes and hopes
for good luck.
