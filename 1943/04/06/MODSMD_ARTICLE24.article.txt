# Teapot Tempest
## 
### 
EXCOM is again involved in an election diffi
culty necessitating a constitutional change.
Again, a tempest in the teapot is brewing.
Since the president-elect in the recently de
vised "A" election left with the rest of the En
listed Reserve Corps, A.S.S.U. government is
now being handled by the vice-president.
Friday The Daily published a ballot to de
termine if the campus favored a special election
under the present constitution which specifies
that only men can run for the student body presi
dency, or if an amendment making it possible
for a woman to run for the office was favored.
According to an Excom reorganization com
mittee, who examined the ballots, the latter plan
was favored.
If Excom approves the date at a meeting to
night, a student body vote will be taken next
Friday on an amendment to the present consti
tution, reading in part:
"The president . . . vacancy shall be filled by
a special election called by the emergency com
mittee open to both men and women candi
dates."
The amendment further sets aside the cur
rent constitution of the A.S.S.U. for the duration
and substitutes a clause, "the functions and
spirit of this constitution as far as the needs and
opportunities of the campus will allow will be
handled by an emergency executive com
mittee."
The emergency consists of all previously
elected members of Excom with the exception
of the student body presidency.
Thus the amendment means that the present
Excom will have the power to determine the
number of members of that committee, their
qualifications for office, and the times of elec
tions. Besides, it will have power to regulate
all other matters pertaining to the proper main
tenance of student government.
Before the amendment election is held, t-.e

emergency committee is anxious to hear any
gripes or suggestions for emergency reorgani
zation at the meeting tonight at 7:30 in the Ex
com room.—Jane Glasson
