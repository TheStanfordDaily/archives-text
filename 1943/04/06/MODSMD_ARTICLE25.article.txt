### CYCLONE COVEY 
Neop Tolemus is the most iconoclastic man
at Stanford.
Since he practically never breezes in but he
breezes right back out, even the residents of
his own house, which is the Co-op, seldom see
him.
And since he does not often take a notion to
pass to class or trod the Quad, it is up to me to
acguaint you with his dynamic personality.
Now it is true that Neop seems to suffer from
a touch of marked mania now and then, but
ordinarily he is as sane as you or I.
One little habit of his might deceive you
though: He has a passion for hot milk.
His girl friend Suzy got wind of this idiosyn
crasy, and when Neop came to see her for the
first time, she had a dish waiting for him on the
doorstep.
"What's that?" asked Neop.
"Hot milk," Suzy replied. "Just lap it up, then
hold me on your lap."
"But I can't drink that," Neop protested.
"That's not hot milk; it's just warmed-over milk.
Suzy was aghast. "What do you mean by
hot wilk then?"
"Straight from the cow!" Neop said.
Well Suzy concealed her tears as best she
could, and went ahead and entertained her
iconoclastic beau the rest of the evening as if
nothing had happened.
She poured him gin and herself rum, and
they played gin rummy.
Apparently nothing was amiss. "At least,"
Suzy thought to herself, "no cow has come be
tween us tonight."
But next day when they went walking in the
hills, Suzy found Neop a little disconcerting.
Every time he spied a cow, he took out his
collapsible cup and tore.
