The Editor, Sir:
How can the war board expect us to work
eight hours a month when they offer so few
things for us to do? Many people wish to do
something for the war effort but have labs in
the afternoon, or don't have time for these war
courses that are offered.
It seems that something, some activity of
some kind, could be found for those who, in
spite of the fact that the Red Cross workroom
is open several hours a day, would rather be
doing some other kind of work. Nothing is more
tiring than sitting, folding bandages and think
ing about how pleasant some other task would
beâ€”something you could put your heart and
soul in. All the jobs around seem so inconse
guential, and although we realize the importance
of the small task, something more important we
could do would be so much more beneficial in
that those who were interested would work
harder and fewer people would be trying to
accomplish the task.
Perhaps one individual does get a big kick
out of making his group go 100 per cent for
Dimes for Diplomas or War Stamps but we can't
all chairman that activity in our living group.
The thing >that is necessary is for one person
to take an interest in one thing instead of merely
being one of many who go to the bandage room
one day a week. The fact that so few people go
to the bandage room is evidence of the fact that
more persons feel the same way I do.
Can't we have soma means of all finding
our nitch, and more nitches to fit in, for when
you step and think about it, collecting salvage,
selling stamps, and rolling bandages isn't really
very many things for a school as large as ours.
Disgruntled.
