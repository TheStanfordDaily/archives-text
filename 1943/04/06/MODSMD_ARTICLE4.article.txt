# Stanford Coeds Bid E.R.C. Adieu
## 
### 
Exhibiting a true "football rally"
spirit, Stanford women, accompanied
by convertibles and pom-poms,
turned out to give a farewell cheer
to Stanford's Enlisted Reserve Corps
as they steamed off front the Palo
Alto station. The E.R.C., which con
sists of Stanford men in the Army
Reserve, left yesterday afternoon at
4 p.m.
Tearfully, the women bade fare
well to what remained of the Stan
ford Rough. As the ratio reaches
its height of 10 women to one man,
the women will soon have to resort
to attending to their own hashing, as
well as to their studies on Saturday
s night.
'Tis with regret that Stanford
i women pay final tribute to the male
element on campus. But we women
! insist that the situation is well in
1 hand.
