# Stanford Women Pledge Monthly Service of Eight Hours to War Program
## 
### 
Last night Stanford women filled out cards pledging themselves to con
tribute at least eight hours a month to war work.
After passing the War Board Auxiliary, the plan was discussed by Wom
en's Conference. The Auxiliary meYnbers, at their meeting, were given
cards to distribute to their living groups. These were the cards filled out

last night.
The object of this program is, ac
cording to Betty Mae Hale, chairman
of the program, to eliminate the la
bor turnover in war work.
"Every time that the Red Cross
surgical dressing supervisors must
teach a new student to roll band
ages, an estimated 50 dressing coulc'
have been made. When that student
does not return to work there is no
return to compensate for the loss,"
she said.
Red Cross Quota
"The supervisors will gladly teach
students, but they want those stu
dents to come back and roll band
ages. The Red Cross Workroom has
a quota to meet, 1,000 dressings c
day. Last week they were short
dressings. Those dressings wouk J
have gone to the Army and woulc'
have been sent overseas.
"The same thing holds for the woi\-
which students are doing for th:
administration," she continued. "Ev
ery time that the secretaries have to
teach students the filing, or othe
particular systems used by that de
partment, the secretary loses time.
Everything would be all right if the
students returned to work, but when,
they fail to return, the department
loses out.
Steady Workers
"This problem is up to the Stan
ford women to solve. With the labor
shortage and the need for war work,
the best use must be made of all
available workers. Everyone wants
more workers, but they want work
ers who are steady. A small hard
working group can always out-pro
duce a larger half-hearted one.
"This problem is what the program
is designed to remedy." Miss Haie
declared. "When students sign up
tor war work we want them to think
seriously about the work for which
they are signing up. We want their
to really do that work every time
they say they will do it. If they do,
this whole problem of labor turn
over will not be a problem any more.
Free Time
"Some students won't have the
time to put in on war work, but
i those students are few. Now that
the majority of the men have left or
have to do more studying, the wom
en will have more time free.
"No one is able to work constantly,
j everyone must do something differ
ent to relax. We think that everyone
ought to do some war work, and by
war work we include everything
which directly or indirectly contrib
' utes to the war effort. This includes
a large number of things. Most
j people will find that they already do
| many more than the eight hours a
, month which we are asking.

Last night Stanford women filled out cards pledging themselves to con
tribute at least eight hours a month to war work.
After passing the War Board Auxiliary, the plan was discussed by Wom
en's Conference. The Auxiliary meYnbers, at their meeting, were given
cards to distribute to their living groups. These were the cards filled out

last night.
The object of this program is, ac
cording to Betty Mae Hale, chairman
of the program, to eliminate the la
bor turnover in war work.
"Every time that the Red Cross
surgical dressing supervisors must
teach a new student to roll band
ages, an estimated 50 dressing coulc'
have been made. When that student
does not return to work there is no
return to compensate for the loss,"
she said.
Red Cross Quota
"The supervisors will gladly teach
students, but they want those stu
dents to come back and roll band
ages. The Red Cross Workroom has
a quota to meet, 1,000 dressings c
day. Last week they were short
dressings. Those dressings wouk J
have gone to the Army and woulc'
have been sent overseas.
"The same thing holds for the woi\-
which students are doing for th:
administration," she continued. "Ev
ery time that the secretaries have to
teach students the filing, or othe
particular systems used by that de
partment, the secretary loses time.
Everything would be all right if the
students returned to work, but when,
they fail to return, the department
loses out.
Steady Workers
"This problem is up to the Stan
ford women to solve. With the labor
shortage and the need for war work,
the best use must be made of all
available workers. Everyone wants
more workers, but they want work
ers who are steady. A small hard
working group can always out-pro
duce a larger half-hearted one.
"This problem is what the program
is designed to remedy." Miss Haie
declared. "When students sign up
tor war work we want them to think
seriously about the work for which
they are signing up. We want their
to really do that work every time
they say they will do it. If they do,
this whole problem of labor turn
over will not be a problem any more.
Free Time
"Some students won't have the
time to put in on war work, but
i those students are few. Now that
the majority of the men have left or
have to do more studying, the wom
en will have more time free.
"No one is able to work constantly,
j everyone must do something differ
ent to relax. We think that everyone
ought to do some war work, and by
war work we include everything
which directly or indirectly contrib
' utes to the war effort. This includes
a large number of things. Most
j people will find that they already do
| many more than the eight hours a
, month which we are asking.
