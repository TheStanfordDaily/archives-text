## Amendment Vote To Be Held Friday 
### 
An amendment setting aside the
constitution for the duration and
providing for the election of a new
student body president from men
and women candidates will be voted
upon by the student body Friday, as
a result of Excom's approval of that
date at its meeting last night.
It' the amendment passes with a
two thirds vote at that time, the spe
cial election to fill the student body
presidency will be held on Thursday
of next week with nominations on
Tuesday and declinations and an
assembly on Wednesday.
One provision of the proposed
amendment would set aside the con
stitution for the duration of the war
and as long thereafter as the Presi
dent of the University feels it nec
essary. The spirit of the constitu
tion would be followed as far as
possible.
Student government would be
handled by an emergency executive
committee, the size of which and the
qualifications of its members to be
decided by the committee according
to varying conditions. This emer
gency committee would have the
power to decide all matters pertain
ing to the proper maintenance of
student government.
In its discussion last night, Excom
made several revisions in the guide
plan, which is a list of recommenda
tions for the committee to follow
in operating student government if
the amendment passes. These
changes will be described in tomor
row's Daily.
