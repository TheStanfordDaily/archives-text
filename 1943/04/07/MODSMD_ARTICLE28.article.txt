SATURDAY S MEET
It may not produce any record
performances, but Saturday's invi
tational meet out on Angell Field
certainly looks attractive from both
the sportswriter's and the specta
tor's standpoint.
In the first place, there's a human
interest element involved in the re
turn of Dink Templeton, former
Stanford track coach, to the scene of
his nun erous triumphs back in the
'thirties; and in the entrance of three
high school stars in the meet.
Templeton, who turned over Stan
ford track to Bill Ellington four
years a;4o, comes back as the re
cently hired coach at the University
of San Francisco. The Dons are
making their first stab at track in
recent years, and the famous Dink is
certainly the man to start them out.
As to the high school stars en
tered, Murray Collins, a stubby lit
tle 16-year-old from Alameda high
school, will undoubtedly get the
spotlight. Collins is the lad who
beat St. Mary's Pre-Flight's Bob
Forsman, Cal's Johnny Dewey, and
Stanford's Bob Compton in the Call-
Bulletin mile, feature event of the
recent Olympic Club indoor meet.
All four of the boys will be out there
Saturday, which should make the
mile a rat-race from start to finish.
The other two high school entrants
are wei lumen, the one from St. Ig
natius school having already
thrown the discus over 146 feet.
The battle for the team champion
ship should prove especially inter
esting, in that it will show which of
the three originally strong squads—
Stanford, California, and San Jose
State—takes the worst beating from
the E.R.C.
OBSTACLES UP
Stanford's obstacle course, that
better-late-than-never affair which
is springing up north of Angel!
Field, gets its first test Friday when
the various gym classes run, jump,
wiggle, climb, and play Tarzan on
its 400 yards of body torture.
There are about 16 different
events, each designed to develop
certain muscles and abilities. Since
;he physical fitness test found the
average Stanford Rough weakest
around the shoulders and arms, most
of the events involve lots of biceps
work.
Figuring that it might be well to
practice up a bit, coaches will put
their classes thruogh the course
slowly at first, teaching them the
correct way to climb the walls, jump
the fences, and swing across the pit,
before making any time trials.
SHORT STUFF
A few sport pot shots: Down
Southern California awy Dean
Cromwell is having track troubles
comparable to Pitch Johnson's.
Cromwell hasn't a pole-vaulter good
fro better than .12 feet 6 inches, and
his crop of distance men is way be
low par. . . . Mural sign-ups were
coming along a little better yester
day. Director Harry Wolter has
set Friday as the deadline. . . . At
tendance at yesterday's Stanford-
U.S.F. ball game hit a new low.
Ten spectators were there; all of
them got in free.

making their first stab at track in
recent years, and the famous Dink is
certainly the man to start them out.
As to the high school stars en
tered, Murray Collins, a stubby lit
tle 16-year-old from Alameda high
school, will undoubtedly get the
spotlight. Collins is the lad who
beat St. Mary's Pre-Flight's Bob
Forsman, Cal's Johnny Dewey, and
Stanford's Bob Compton in the Call-
Bulletin mile, feature event of the
recent Olympic Club indoor meet.
All four of the boys will be out there
Saturday, which should make the
mile a rat-race from start to finish.
The other two high school entrants
are wei lumen, the one from St. Ig
natius school having already
thrown the discus over 146 feet.
The battle for the team champion
ship should prove especially inter
esting, in that it will show which of
the three originally strong squads—
Stanford, California, and San Jose
State—takes the worst beating from
the E.R.C.
OBSTACLES UP
Stanford's obstacle course, that
better-late-than-never affair which
is springing up north of Angel!
Field, gets its first test Friday when
the various gym classes run, jump,
wiggle, climb, and play Tarzan on
its 400 yards of body torture.
There are about 16 different
events, each designed to develop
certain muscles and abilities. Since
;he physical fitness test found the
average Stanford Rough weakest
around the shoulders and arms, most
of the events involve lots of biceps
work.
Figuring that it might be well to
practice up a bit, coaches will put
their classes thruogh the course
slowly at first, teaching them the
correct way to climb the walls, jump
the fences, and swing across the pit,
before making any time trials.
SHORT STUFF
A few sport pot shots: Down
Southern California awy Dean
Cromwell is having track troubles
comparable to Pitch Johnson's.
Cromwell hasn't a pole-vaulter good
fro better than .12 feet 6 inches, and
his crop of distance men is way be
low par. . . . Mural sign-ups were
coming along a little better yester
day. Director Harry Wolter has
set Friday as the deadline. . . . At
tendance at yesterday's Stanford-
U.S.F. ball game hit a new low.
Ten spectators were there; all of
them got in free.
SATURDAY S MEET
It may not produce any record
performances, but Saturday's invi
tational meet out on Angell Field
certainly looks attractive from both
the sportswriter's and the specta
tor's standpoint.
In the first place, there's a human
interest element involved in the re
turn of Dink Templeton, former
Stanford track coach, to the scene of
his nun erous triumphs back in the
'thirties; and in the entrance of three
high school stars in the meet.
Templeton, who turned over Stan
ford track to Bill Ellington four
years a;4o, comes back as the re
cently hired coach at the University
of San Francisco. The Dons are
making their first stab at track in
recent years, and the famous Dink is
