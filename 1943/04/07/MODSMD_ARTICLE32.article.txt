## Ann Ashley Coxes Third Shell As Varsity Preps for U.C.L.A. 
### Irma Cunha 
As you're reading this article, the
J Stanford crew, three shellfuls, are
: probably just getting to their 8
o'clocks after a two-hour workout in
I prep for their first race of the sea-
J son, a mile and a quarter pull against
U.C.L.A. at Bologna Creek on April
| 17, a week from this Saturday.
The third shell, filled with oars
men of about eight days' experience,
has as its coxswain Ann Ashley,
j Robleite, who, with Wall Drake, head
cox, and Oliver Andrews, cox of the
junior varsity shell, handles the job
for the Stanford crew.
No men were able to fit in with
the weight requirements or neces
sary ability to cox a shell, and so,
after a few trials, Miss Ashley proved
i herself and is now working out with
the third shell.
Coach Carl Pedersen's men will
leave for their big race on the 7:15
Coaster a week from Thursday.
Pedersen won't allow any moss to
; gather on the shell, either, because
the oarsmen will work out down
South the day before the race.
The entire crew has been working
out over vacation and since seven

days a week, on a two-hour, 14-mile
course, and their practice pulls are
held either from 4 p.m. to 5:45 or
from (5 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. Morning
practices are the usual thing because
despite the cold, the water is calmer.
Although this is their first official
race, Stanford's crewmen met Cal
at the Oakland Estuary last Autumn,
and pulled across the finish line four
and a half feet behind the Bear shell.
Lineups often change as late as a
half hour belore the race, but at
present the temporary shells stand
like this:
Varsity shell: 1, Bud Clary; 2,
Jack Hauser; 3, Bob Hampton; 4.
Walco Gasich; 5. Bert Avery; 6, Tony

As you're reading this article, the
J Stanford crew, three shellfuls, are
: probably just getting to their 8
o'clocks after a two-hour workout in
I prep for their first race of the sea-
J son, a mile and a quarter pull against
U.C.L.A. at Bologna Creek on April
| 17, a week from this Saturday.
The third shell, filled with oars
men of about eight days' experience,
has as its coxswain Ann Ashley,
j Robleite, who, with Wall Drake, head
cox, and Oliver Andrews, cox of the
junior varsity shell, handles the job
for the Stanford crew.
No men were able to fit in with
the weight requirements or neces
sary ability to cox a shell, and so,
after a few trials, Miss Ashley proved
i herself and is now working out with
the third shell.
Coach Carl Pedersen's men will
leave for their big race on the 7:15
Coaster a week from Thursday.
Pedersen won't allow any moss to
; gather on the shell, either, because
the oarsmen will work out down
South the day before the race.
The entire crew has been working
out over vacation and since seven

days a week, on a two-hour, 14-mile
course, and their practice pulls are
held either from 4 p.m. to 5:45 or
from (5 a.m. to 7:30 a.m. Morning
practices are the usual thing because
despite the cold, the water is calmer.
Although this is their first official
race, Stanford's crewmen met Cal
at the Oakland Estuary last Autumn,
and pulled across the finish line four
and a half feet behind the Bear shell.
Lineups often change as late as a
half hour belore the race, but at
present the temporary shells stand
like this:
Varsity shell: 1, Bud Clary; 2,
Jack Hauser; 3, Bob Hampton; 4.
Walco Gasich; 5. Bert Avery; 6, Tony
Medved; 7, New Gates; 8, Paul
