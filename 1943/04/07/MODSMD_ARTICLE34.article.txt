# Track Meet Draws Teams
## 
### 
Stanford's invitational track meet I
this Saturday is rapidly becoming j
a bigtime affair, as more and more
teams throughout the Bay Area con- '
tinue to signify their intention of |
competing on the Angell Field cin
ders.
Already Card mentor Pitch John- I
son has been notified that Fresno |
State will enter a squad of about j
10, San Jose one of around 15, St.
Mary's Pie-Flight about 15, and
U.S.F. three or four. California
likewise has promised to send some |
kind of team over.
Other invitations to compete were j
sent out by Johnson Monday to the
Treasure Island Naval Training Sta
tion, Alameda Coast Guard, Ala- j
meda Air Base, Del Monte Pre-
Flight, San Francisco State, Santa
r>osa J.C., Salinas J.C., Marin J.C..
Modesto J.C., College of the Pacific,
Monterey Presidio, and San Mateo
J.C.
While no definite entry lists will
be in until Thursday, it is likely
that the field will compare favor
ably with the recent Olympic Club
Indoor Championships. Only those j
called in the Stanford and San Jose
State E.R.C.'s, along with Cornelius j
Warmerdam and the token S.C.
squad, are expected to be absent :
from the Olympic meet personnel.
YVeanwhile Stanford's 25-odd run
nels and jumpers entered are bear- j
ing down more and more in daily i
workouts. This afternoon field event j
men will probably go for height and !
distance, while the runners may take J
a few time trials. Tapering - off
workouts are on the menu for |
Thursday, with only a little warming [
up planned for Friday.
Several new prospects on the Card
squad are showing up well in prac- |
tice. Shotputters Fred Boench and
Ed Chynoweth have not thrown for
distance yet but look good on warm- |
up puts. George Jones, a new high
jumper, has already cleared six feet,
while Bernie Wagner in the half
mile and John Wise in the javelin
are turning in good practice efforts.

Ed Chynoweth have not thrown for
distance yet but look good on warm- |
up puts. George Jones, a new high
jumper, has already cleared six feet,
while Bernie Wagner in the half
mile and John Wise in the javelin
are turning in good practice efforts.
Stanford's invitational track meet I
this Saturday is rapidly becoming j
a bigtime affair, as more and more
teams throughout the Bay Area con- '
tinue to signify their intention of |
competing on the Angell Field cin
ders.
Already Card mentor Pitch John- I
son has been notified that Fresno |
State will enter a squad of about j
10, San Jose one of around 15, St.
Mary's Pie-Flight about 15, and
U.S.F. three or four. California
likewise has promised to send some |
kind of team over.
Other invitations to compete were j
sent out by Johnson Monday to the
Treasure Island Naval Training Sta
tion, Alameda Coast Guard, Ala- j
meda Air Base, Del Monte Pre-
Flight, San Francisco State, Santa
r>osa J.C., Salinas J.C., Marin J.C..
Modesto J.C., College of the Pacific,
Monterey Presidio, and San Mateo
J.C.
While no definite entry lists will
be in until Thursday, it is likely
that the field will compare favor
ably with the recent Olympic Club
Indoor Championships. Only those j
called in the Stanford and San Jose
State E.R.C.'s, along with Cornelius j
Warmerdam and the token S.C.
squad, are expected to be absent :
from the Olympic meet personnel.
YVeanwhile Stanford's 25-odd run
nels and jumpers entered are bear- j
ing down more and more in daily i
workouts. This afternoon field event j
men will probably go for height and !
distance, while the runners may take J
a few time trials. Tapering - off
workouts are on the menu for |
Thursday, with only a little warming [
up planned for Friday.
Several new prospects on the Card
squad are showing up well in prac- |
tice. Shotputters Fred Boench and
Ed Chynoweth have not thrown for
distance yet but look good on warm- |
up puts. George Jones, a new high
jumper, has already cleared six feet,
while Bernie Wagner in the half
mile and John Wise in the javelin
are turning in good practice efforts.
