AWHILE back the Saturday Evening Post
ran a series of paintings by Norman Rock
well on "The Four Freedoms"—pictures of
Freedom of Speech, Freedom of Worship, Free
dom from Want, and Freedom from Fear.
They were good paintings and the text that
was printed on the adjoining page was good
writing. But in a way they are more than good
pictures accompanied and explained by good
writing.
They are part of the latent hope that is in each
one of us. They symbolize America as we
imagine it is and they symbolize the world as
we hope that it will be. They symbolize our
development from the dark ages "when fear
walked at man's heels" and they give us faith
to fight and die for the future.
They are the Common Man's ideas on what
should be what. Maybe the confidence of the
man in the blue plaid shirt in Freedom of
Speech; maybe the tenderness on the mother's
face in Freedom from Fear or the brown full
ness of the turkey and the smiling eyes in
Freedom from Want—maybe these will stick in
our minds where the high-sounding words of
politicians have failed.
Maybe because of these pictures of common
people living as we believe they should, the
phrase "The Four Freedoms" will not draw in
future times a bitter, disillusioned laugh as "a
world safe for democracy" draws from our
fathers and from us.
If we think of these cardinal freedoms in
terms of common people with tired and kindly
faces and blue shirts and dirty finger nails,
maybe they will come to pass for our sons, the
sons of the German and the Japanese soldiers,
and the sons of starving Greece—for all next
generations, and for all time.
