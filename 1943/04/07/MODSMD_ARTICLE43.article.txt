# Now Is the Time

NOW is the time for all good women to do
their eight hours of war work. War work,
that is, real war work, is hard work. It isn't
glamorous and exciting and "big," but it is just
plain hard work.
Letters have to be typed and bandages have
to be rolled. The War Department has to know
where every soldier is and some professor at
Stanford has to send in his grade sheet. These
t a slcs don't have the same glamour, but they
] Ih have to be done, and they both require a
lot of typing at some point in the process.
Eandages have to be rolled. Some bandages

cannot be manufactured, and the manufacturers
cannot supply the demand for those which can
be made by machinery. But the Army and
Navy have to have bandages.
Rolling bandages and typing letters are just
as important as the nail in the horse's shoe, but
much less celebrated. And the object of those
who type and those who roll ought to be to see
that their work, unlike the nail in the shoe, does
not come undone.
Everyone who does his best in every job that
he does is helping the war effort. But it isn't
easy to do that and it isn't easy to remember
that. When everything has gone wrong for a
whole day, it is hard to keep doing a job as
well as possible. It is hard to remember that
when everything is added up that job is just
about as important as fighting Japs on Guadal
canal. This is a total war. That has been said
over and over again but it is still hard to re
member.
War work is hard steady work which never
seems to stop. It isn't glamorous and it isn't
always "big," but it has got to be done. Now
that most of the men have gone to war, the
only people who are left to do this work are
women. The War Board has asked every
woman to put in at least eight hours of war
work a month. If, when she is doing this, even
though she doesn't particularly like what she
is doing, she does the best she can, no one can
do more.â€”Lucile Thompson
