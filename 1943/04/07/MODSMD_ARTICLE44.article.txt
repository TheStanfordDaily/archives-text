### CYCLONE COVEY 
Suzy's little sister Tibby is the cutest Mon
golian idiot.
Her disposition is quiet and respectful, though
sometimes she does stick out her six-inch tongue
at Neop Tolemus.
Even when she is not sticking it out, there
is too much of it to keep all the way in; and
with the sides curled up, it pokes a little way
beyond her blood-red lips, and she thus appears
always about to cough.
She is seven but looks four. Her complexion
is smooth, slightly bronzed. Her eyes look
Chinese. Her jet-black hair is usually tied with
a yellow ribbon to match her dresses, all of
which are yellow except one, which is red and
yellow.
When Suzy is home in Fresno, Neop goes to
see Tibby; and when Suzy is at Stanford, Neop
chases cows to milk.
Neop of course is enrolled at Stanford, but
he often gets as far away as Fresno in the
middle of a quarter, tracking down pedigreed
Guernsey's.
Suzy brought Tibby to Stanford, where sev
eral sororities have already indicated they
would like to give her a birthday party every
month.
And Suzy has always said that Stanford is as
good an institution as Sonoma any old day.
Also, Suzy recently put in a request to the
University to keep a pedigreed Guernsey in
her own back yard.
The University replied, "You can now raise
chickens on campus."
Our cute little idiot Tibby, not quite under
standing all these goings-on but wanting to be
helpful, ran and phoned Neop at the Co-op:
"Come on over. But cows are out. The best
we can do is chicken milk."
