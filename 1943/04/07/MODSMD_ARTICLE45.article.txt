The Editor, Sir:
Every day I walk down the alley behind the
Chi O house and every day there is the same
old wheelless car sitting there.
I am constantly harangued at to give dimes
for diplomas and to appreciate how fine the war
board is but it seems to me that they might see
about getting this and other old cars like it
into the scrap drive and into the war.
Let's have more scrap and less talk.
