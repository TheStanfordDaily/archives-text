# TUESDAY SERIES
## Madame Barzin Tells Story Of Nazification of Europe 
### 
If there was anyone in the Tues
day Evening Series' audience whose
| attention has been focused mostly
!on the war fronts lately, it was
brought back with a jolt tonight to
the core of World War 11, where the
self-styled master race of Europe is
intent upon fixing its new civilization
on the beaten people of Europe.
Madame Betty Barzin, Belgian
citizen, British citizen, journalist,
and official, told of the thorough,
systematic annihilation of all rem
nants of European culture that is
not German or consistent with the

I "new order." The attempts at nazi
-1 fication of Folish, Belgian. French,
and Luxembourg youth has involved
"a deportation of teachers from their
schools and native land, a removal
! of the rebellious into forced labor,
; destruction and confiscation of
i books, and in some places a total
i cessation of religious and political
} teachings."
j Madame Barzin said that the west
ern parts of Europe would be the
i easiest in plans of a post-war recon-
J struction. They knew the history
I and culture of democracy. Eastern
Europe would be more difficult, and
! we must realize "that we are not
! going to be able to force our view
-1 points of freedom of thought and
j freedom of religion on people who
do not desire that system. I fail en
j tirely to see a solution to the recon
| struction of Germany." she said. "A
generation of German and Italian
! youth have never known democ-
I racy."
Statements on German Nazifica
| tion'of Europe, include French teach
ers instructing youth with "a dark
| coated German police on one side
! of the board and a gestapo agent on
| the other; in the swift, hard manner
of German action. She concluded
with the appeal. "In this situation
; can't you agree with me that all
traces of French culture would dis
appear from both France and Lux
embourg?"
The charming lady became very
! earnest when she said, ' Public opin
! ion, in those countries that still have
, it. should weigh and study and con
i sider carefully all plans of post-war
reconstruction." It should be "con
struction of minds as well as of
bouses," because one plan will not
do for all Europe, situations every
where are not alike. There must be
something concrete;" anything loose
will mean a third war and the United
I states will bear the brunt of it.

!on the war fronts lately, it was
brought back with a jolt tonight to
the core of World War 11, where the
self-styled master race of Europe is
intent upon fixing its new civilization
on the beaten people of Europe.
Madame Betty Barzin, Belgian
citizen, British citizen, journalist,
and official, told of the thorough,
systematic annihilation of all rem
nants of European culture that is
not German or consistent with the

I "new order." The attempts at nazi
-1 fication of Folish, Belgian. French,
and Luxembourg youth has involved
"a deportation of teachers from their
schools and native land, a removal
! of the rebellious into forced labor,
; destruction and confiscation of
i books, and in some places a total
i cessation of religious and political
} teachings."
j Madame Barzin said that the west
ern parts of Europe would be the
i easiest in plans of a post-war recon-
J struction. They knew the history
I and culture of democracy. Eastern
Europe would be more difficult, and
! we must realize "that we are not
! going to be able to force our view
-1 points of freedom of thought and
j freedom of religion on people who
do not desire that system. I fail en
j tirely to see a solution to the recon
| struction of Germany." she said. "A
generation of German and Italian
! youth have never known democ-
I racy."
Statements on German Nazifica
| tion'of Europe, include French teach
ers instructing youth with "a dark
| coated German police on one side
! of the board and a gestapo agent on
| the other; in the swift, hard manner
of German action. She concluded
with the appeal. "In this situation
; can't you agree with me that all
traces of French culture would dis
appear from both France and Lux
embourg?"
The charming lady became very
! earnest when she said, ' Public opin
! ion, in those countries that still have
, it. should weigh and study and con
i sider carefully all plans of post-war
reconstruction." It should be "con
struction of minds as well as of
bouses," because one plan will not
do for all Europe, situations every
where are not alike. There must be
something concrete;" anything loose
will mean a third war and the United
I states will bear the brunt of it.
If there was anyone in the Tues
day Evening Series' audience whose
| attention has been focused mostly
!on the war fronts lately, it was
brought back with a jolt tonight to
the core of World War 11, where the
