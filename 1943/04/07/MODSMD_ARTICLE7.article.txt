### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, North Africa, April 5 (U.R)â€”The British
Eighth Army resumed its offensive up the Tunisian east coast today and
; captured all its initial objectives while American troops, closing a trap
) from the west, drove forward five miles to the El Guettar sector where the
Afrika Korps was reported retreating.
J The Eighth Army struck against Field Marshal Erwin Rommel's

hastily erected defenses along the<
Wadi Akarit, 20 miles north of
Gabes, at 4:30 a.m., an official an
nouncement said.
i "First objectives were taken," it
added.
The deep and wide Wadi, through
j which water flows at this season,
| normally would be an excellent tank
barrier and Rommel had blown up
the only railroad bridge crossing its
gorge.
The Americans advanced in the
area east of El Guettar without
meeting opposition and were moving
directly eastward toward the Wadi
Akarit, threatening to trap the en
emy forces farther south in the
Gabes road area unless they com
pleted their withdrawal quickly.
General Sir Bernard Montgomery,
| commander of the Eighth Army,
I sent his men into action to storm the
| gorge-like Wadi on which Rommel
I made his stand only alter waiting
| for days with amazing patience
j while he amassed material and dis-
I posed of his men.
The resumed American advance,
started at a point only about 30
j miles to Rommel's rear on the in
land side, meant an acute double
threat.
Heavy enemy traffic was dis
| covered moving out of the entire
I area toward the northeast in what
may mark the start of a general
| withdrawal by Rommel.
