# Excom Revises Guide Plan for Student Vote
## Amendment Election Tomorrow To Cover President Vacancy 
### 
In its discussion of student body
reorganization Tuesday night, Ex
com partially revised the guide plan,
the list of recommendations on con
ducting student government during
the war which supplements the pro
posed constitutional amendment
upon which students will vote to
morrow. If it passes by a two thirds
vote, an election for student body
president will be held next week,
with men and women candidates.
Under the present constitution, the
vice-president cannot succeed the
president, but a special election
would be used if the amendment
setting aside the constitution is
passed, provides that the vice-presi
dent should succeed the president.
The successor to the vice-presi
dent in the revised guide plan then
would be chosen by a three-fourths
vote of the executive committee from
among the upper division repre
sentatives on the committee or the
runners-up for president or vice
president.
A reduced executive committee is
suggested in the guide plan and it
would consist of a president, man
or woman; vice-president, man or
woman; two upper and two lower
division representatives; one mem
ber at large, and the present ex
officio members.
Although all the powers of student
government would be concentrated
in this committee, it is to follow the
spirit of the constitution whenever
possible. Student control would be
exercised through the right of 150
students to petition for a special elec
tion or for the removal of any offi
cer.
In presenting the amendment and
guide plan, the reorganization com
mittee urged its acceptance because
the present constitution is not suit
able for wartime conditions. With
student officers leaving school, class
distinctions disappearing, and or
ganization's activities much reduced,
they felt student government should
be vested in a small flexible group
which would not have to follow the
complex procedures outlined in the
constitution in meeting new condi
tions.
