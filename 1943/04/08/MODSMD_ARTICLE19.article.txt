# Noel Coward War Picture Is Best Yet
## 
### 
"In Which We Serve," now play
ing at the Stanford Theater, de
serves all the positive publicity it
has received and is truly the best
picture yet to come out of this war.
Photography, characters, story—all
r.re excellent, and the picture is both
moving and entertaining.
As the picture comes - on the
sci'een, the audience is a little leary
about the merits of a picture pro
duced Orson Welles' style—written,
directed, and acted by the same man,
but Noel Coward proves that he, too,
can do the job.
Story of Boat
The picture tells the story of a
boat, a British destroyer, the men
who sail her and love her, and their
wives and families who pray for her,
but call her their worst enemy.
There is nothing more. But in this
plot are shown the feelings, thoughts,
?.nd beliefs of these men, their brav
ely in battle, and their lack of a feel
ing of revenge toward the Germans.
The emotion that is depicted by
the actors and actresses in this Eng
lish film will make the American
audiences stop and think. They seem
to take the hardships and sacrifices
of war as a matter of fact. They ac
cept war and peace, life and death
with the same depth of feeling. This
spirit prevails throughout all the
glimpses of the English common life
which make up this picture.
Good Photography
The story begins before the war
when the boat is being built and fol
lows its experiences in convoying,
Dunkirk, and Crete. The photog
raphy throughout is excellent, and
the detailed shots of the battles arc
particularly good.
It is too bad Alexander Woolcott
has already said it, because I, too,
think it is one of the best pictures I
have seen. —Martin
