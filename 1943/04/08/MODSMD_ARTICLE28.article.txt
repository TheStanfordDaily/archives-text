# Best Sellers Reflect Shift Of Thought
## 
### 
I The Bible, the Boston and Settle
ment Cook Books, the cartoon book
j "Vassar Second Glance" are three of
I the Stanford Bookstore's best sellers
i so far this quarter.
For this strange assortment there
seems no other explanation than the
war-time .shift back to the "funda
mentals" of religion, cooking, and
| humor. For instance, in the pre-
Christmas sale this year the Book
store was sold out of Bibles by No
vember and unable to obtain any
more. However, the store is at pres
ent well stocked with both King
James and Goodspced versions, ac
cording to the Bookstore manager.
Technical Books
Engineering and technical texts
are still outselling all others this
quarter as formerly indicative of the
| war-time emphasis on technical
! fields. Brush-up math texts are also
| coming in for their share of the same
trend.
Second in line of sale are those
books connected with post-war work.
More Chinese, Japanese, German,
and Portuguese dictionaries are be
ing sold than ever before and there
I has been a heavy run on such texts
I as Frederick Schuman's "Design for
Power," the text for Professor Gra
ham Stuart's course on Contempo
rary World Politics.
War Novels
In the pleasure reading depart
ment there has been a heavy demand
for eye-witness accounts from the
world's battlefronts such as "Guadal
canal Diary," "Four Came Through,"
"They Were Expendable," as well
as for the various military and naval
handbooks.
By contrast, the next heaviest sale
j of pleasure books is in the humor
j department, particularly the cartoon
| collections such as Peter Arno's
| "Cartoon Revue," the "New Yorker
Revue," and "Drawn and Quar
tered." "Vassar Second Glance," a
take-off of the life of a Vassal" un
dergraduate which outsells all other
j cartoon collections is in more de
] mand among the boys than the girls,
according to the manager of the
Bookstore.
