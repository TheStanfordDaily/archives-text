### 
Minus the names of Hal Davis and
Grover Kiemmer, a nevertheless
potent California entry list for Sat
urday's invitational track meet was
announced yesterday by Bear Coach
A1 Pagan. News that Cal will defi
nitely send over the 10-man squad
sets up the battle for the team cham
pionship on a three-way affair
among the Bears, San Jose State,
and Stanford.
Davis and Kiemmer, both world
record holders, were not entered be
cause they reportedly are not yet in
shape.
Heading the Bear squad is quarter
miler Jim Dunn and miler Ralph
Dewey. Dunn captured the 440 in

the recent Olympic Club indoor
meet, while Dewey took a third in
the Call-Bulletin mile behind high
schooler Murray Collins and Pre-
Flight's Bob Forsman.

Lee Angelich, hurdler; Bob Tuttle,
javelin; Stan Bernard, shotput and
discus; Keith Groswird, pole vault;
A1 Stone, 880; John Prader, 100;
George Stein, two mile; and Gene
Smith, high and low hurdles.
Down San Jose way Track Coach
Tiny Hartranft announced that 14
Spartans would compete in the meet.
Leading the squad is Vern Cooley, a
pole vaulter who will probably battle

place in this event, and high jumper

Clark, javelin thrower; Bud Vere
gee, hurdler, and Ken Horn, 220

Baylor University. First junior col
lege to send in an entry list was
Modesto, which is entering three
men.
Out on Angell Field Stanford's
squad yesterday went through its last
set of time trials before the meet,
with performances for the most part
mediocre. Middle distance man
Johnny Fulton pulled the surprise of
the day by winning both dash trials,
the 100 in 10.2, and the 220 in 22.3.
Off these marks Fulton may attempt
one or both of the short events Sat
urday, in addition to either the 440
or 880.
Both Bob Compton and Dave Bills
showed up well, running two half
miles together in 2:07 and 2:12.
