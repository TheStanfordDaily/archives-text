### Bill Allen 
One of the unhappiest groups of
of men on the Stanford Campus is
the baseball squad. Not because of
the gloomy picture ahead, but be
cause they must fact it without the
help of so many of the first string
men. This is the second year in a
row that Harry Wolter has lost what
at first appeared to be an unbeatable
ball club to the armed services or
the Registrar's axe.
Last season Wolter came up with
a very complete pitching staff in pre
season practice. But when league
games rolled around he found him
self without one starting hurler. This
season, history has repeated itself,
and Wolter once more finds himself
with a depleted squad.
Still Good Squad
There is one thing Stanford sup
porters can be certain of, however,
and that is that Mr. Wolter will still
field an excellent squad in most re
spects. There was no doubt of this
in the minds of those who saw the
Cards perform in their league opener
last Monday. They lost, but that
doesn't tell the whole story.
The rest of the teams in the north
em California division of the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
League have already played half of
their league games plus many out
side practice games. This is a tough
league even starting from scratch,
and when the odds are against you
. . . well.
Coach Wolter was satisfied with !
Ihe game his men played on a
strange field Monday and is confident
that they will find their stride.
Harry is not the only one who is
confident, all of Stanford is behind
him.
Trojans
The cream of the southlands col- j
egiate baseball nines this year ap- j
pears to be the Southern California
Trojans with a record of 16 wins
against no losses. Runner up is
U.C.L.A. The northern winner will
travel to Los Angeles to participate j
in the playoff for the state cham- !
pionship. At the present time the
Bay area representative appears to
be California, as yet undefeated in j
league competition.
Pacific Coast League
Pacific Coast League baseball is j
11 a sorry state this year with all !
but two of the teams complaining of j
a serious man shortage. San Fran- |
cisco seems to be having an easier
time of it than most teams, with i
players actually fighting for posi- ■
tions. Hollywood is in the worst
shape with the latest count showing
only nine men who have signed con- !
tracts. Manager Charley Root states
lhat he expects help from major j
j'eague clubs in the near future. It
had better be in the very near fu
ture since the Stars open against
day in the Seals Stadium.

One of the unhappiest groups of
of men on the Stanford Campus is
the baseball squad. Not because of
the gloomy picture ahead, but be
cause they must fact it without the
help of so many of the first string
men. This is the second year in a
row that Harry Wolter has lost what
at first appeared to be an unbeatable
ball club to the armed services or
the Registrar's axe.
Last season Wolter came up with
a very complete pitching staff in pre
season practice. But when league
games rolled around he found him
self without one starting hurler. This
season, history has repeated itself,
and Wolter once more finds himself
with a depleted squad.
Still Good Squad
There is one thing Stanford sup
porters can be certain of, however,
and that is that Mr. Wolter will still
field an excellent squad in most re
spects. There was no doubt of this
in the minds of those who saw the
Cards perform in their league opener
last Monday. They lost, but that
doesn't tell the whole story.
The rest of the teams in the north
em California division of the Cali
fornia Intercollegiate Baseball
League have already played half of
their league games plus many out
side practice games. This is a tough
league even starting from scratch,
and when the odds are against you
. . . well.
Coach Wolter was satisfied with !
Ihe game his men played on a
strange field Monday and is confident
that they will find their stride.
Harry is not the only one who is
confident, all of Stanford is behind
him.
Trojans
The cream of the southlands col- j
egiate baseball nines this year ap- j
pears to be the Southern California
Trojans with a record of 16 wins
against no losses. Runner up is
U.C.L.A. The northern winner will
travel to Los Angeles to participate j
in the playoff for the state cham- !
pionship. At the present time the
Bay area representative appears to
be California, as yet undefeated in j
league competition.
Pacific Coast League
Pacific Coast League baseball is j
11 a sorry state this year with all !
but two of the teams complaining of j
a serious man shortage. San Fran- |
cisco seems to be having an easier
time of it than most teams, with i
players actually fighting for posi- ■
tions. Hollywood is in the worst
shape with the latest count showing
only nine men who have signed con- !
tracts. Manager Charley Root states
lhat he expects help from major j
j'eague clubs in the near future. It
had better be in the very near fu
ture since the Stars open against
