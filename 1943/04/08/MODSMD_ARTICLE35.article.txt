# Maloney To Hold Soccer Practice
## 
### 
Harry Maloney, Stanford's all
around coach, announced Tuesday
that spring training was being held
this year with the hope that it will
still be possible to have soccer com
petition next fall. He is pinning his
hopes on the only two returning
varsity lettermen, George Koffer
and Russel Bryan. To bolster these
two Maloney has seven or eight
freshmen up from last season's frosh
squad.
Mr. Maloney points out, however,
that due to the present conditions
most of the training will be held in
the form of physical fitness drills.
This will include jaunts over Stan
ford's new obstacle course, which
he claims will put a team in condi
tion, as well as other types of ex
ercise.
