The blue sky was darkening over
historic Monterey Presidio, and a
cool breeze from the Pacific was
whipping whitecaps across the bay.
To the lonely group of Stanford
E.K.C. and R.O.T.C. men reporting
for duty, however, the scene was not
quite as romantic as it might have
been under other circumstances.
One of the last groups of Stan
ford men was going through their
first hours of Army life as the lights
began to go on in the surrounding
barracks. Luggage still in hand,
they entered a low building sepa
rated from the rest for a prelimi
nary physical and emerged from the
other side wearing G.I. raincoats,
their first article of uniform.
As the fifty men lined up behind 1
the reception building, last year's
Gaieties director, Bob O'Neill, was
clutching a small square cardboard
box bound with manila rope. "Tiny"
Mosher jokingly maintained that his
raincoat was large enough, although

most of the men belong, looked '
lather indifferent as the column !
moved forward.
"How about n trip to Belt's to- !
night?" someone asked ironically,
without much response.
Halted in front of the mess hall, j
the sergeant spoke again.
"You're gonna feed yourselves I
cafeteria style. There's asparagus, '
beans, peas, etc., so if you don't
like something, don't take the damn j
stuff."
While the new arrivals ate, those j
who had come earlier were receiv- [
ing lessons in army bed-making in
a nearby barracks. Carefully tuck- !
ing in blankets with the "U.S." ex- !
actly centered were Malcolm Mc- i
Killop and Jim Moore, while Bob
