### 
THE Stanford War Board has a new coordi
nator. Excom okayed Betty May Hale as
the War Board head to take over the vacancy
left by Rosemary Cross when she resigned.
Rosemary Cross did a fine job as head of
ihe War Board. She came into the job under
somewhat of a handicap in that she followed
Bob Collins as the head of the Board.
Under her buidance and direction, the same
high quality of work was carried on that Col
lins had done, and the scope of the Board was
enlarged at the same time; it was consolidated
so that it worked better and more efficiently.
Above all else, things got done.
Being head of the War Board is a big job
and she is tired. She did a good job, and in
her own little way helped to win the war.
As for the new face, which heads the War
Board, we may well expect the same high qual
ity of achievement from Betty May Hale that
her predecessors, Bob Collins, and Rosemary
Cross, turned in.
