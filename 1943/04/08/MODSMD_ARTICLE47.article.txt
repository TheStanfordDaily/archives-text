# Happy Birthday to You

### 
FIFTY years ago today the 'Y' was founded.
Stanford was a lot different then. There
were just five hundred women and the ratio
was 3 to 1. Today there are twelve hundred
women and the ration is 1.15 to 1. Things have
changed and so has the 'Y'.
In the fifty years that it has been on campus
the 'Y' has seen its ups and downs. It began
Vocom, the International Club, the sponsor
system, and it established the first Red Cross
unit at Stanford. These activities have been
turned over to other organizations or have be
come independent.
Today the 'Y' does social service work; its
members look after workers' children. It or
ganizes discussion groups on international
affairs, home and marriage, and freshman
activities. Last fall it, with the War Board,
organized the crop crews, and it is already
planning summer quarter crews.
These activities are different from those
with which it began, but the 'Y' has grown with
Stanford.
The 'Y' is a part of Stanford. It has helped
to make Stanford what it is today. May it have
many more birthdays, all as happy as this.—
Lucille Thompson.
