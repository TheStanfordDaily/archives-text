# In Which We Serve
## 
### 
THERE is a movie playing in Palo Alto now
called "In Which We Serve." It is an excep
tionally fine movie just in itself, but more than
that it is a movie which every person in the
United States ought to see, with the possible
exception of those who have seen action in this
war. It is the story of how men go into action
and how it affects them and why. It isn't an
atrocity story to make civilians hate the enemy,
and it isn't a story designed to impress people
with the might of any army. It is just a story of
people who happen to be fighting.
It probably couldn't be called realism for
most of the Americans who see it because the
movie is British. It is very emotional, but it is

the emotion of understatement, and that isn't
exactly American. The British and Americans
probably have the same feelings in a situation
like this, but the Americans will talk about it
and dramatize it more. If they didn't they
wouldn't be Americans. But the feeling, whether
it is put into words or not, is in the movie. It's
one of the best movies on war that have ever
been made.â€”Lucile Thompson
