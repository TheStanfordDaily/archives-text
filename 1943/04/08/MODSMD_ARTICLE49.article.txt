# First of the Quarter
## 
### 
TODAY is the first Stamp Day at Stanford
this quarter. Buying stamps ought to be
more or less a habit with Stanford students
now, and it is a good habit to get into. Now
that the E.R.C., as well as the Flying Indians
and other Stanford men, are in the service
everyone ought to buy even more stamps.
The stamps we buy will be turned into the
guns and ammunition they use. The more
stamps we buy, the safer they will be. So,
when your representative comes around to see
you today, if he hasn't already been around,
buy a couple of stamps from him. Every stamp
helps.—Lucile Thompson.
