# BULL SESSION
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
A dozen or so paces off to the right and
you are in the same room with a corpse 25
centuries old. And on toward the end of the
room you come upon a smaller one, the mummy
of a baby bandaged up with his feet sticking
out.
And on the diorite throne at the end of the
room, between pillars in simulation of the
Temple of Amon at Karnak probably, sits with
an opthalmic gaze, King Cha-F-Ra, builder of
the Second Pyramid.
You are in the Egyptian room of the Stan
ford Museum, on a tour of personalities to
be seen. Lewis Mujnford has said that mu
seums bespeak a sad symptom of disorderliness
in a civilization's scholarship. But you meet
some interesting characters in them â€”statued,
mumified, and painted.
Off the Egyptian room you come face to
face with his holy smugness, the Japanese
Buddha, sitting on what appears to be a large
artichoke, which, like himself, is gilded.
Back in the lobby is the statue of the Stan
fords, the Governor and Leland Stanford stand
ing and Mrs. Stanford kneeling. There has been
irritation by certain indignant old ladies de
manding women's rights that Mrs. Stanford be
re-cast standing, although the positions of the
subjects are as Mrs. Stanford herself directed.
Upstairs, the yellow death mask of the
great David Starr Jordan lies with a cast of his
refined old hands beside it, on a table before
his portrait.- The death masks of the founders,
though in possession of the museum, are not
yet on display.
Standing guard over the lobby with her
golden spear is Athena, patron of the Achaeans
and Odysseus. But her full significance in be
ing above the lobby, whatever it was before
this year, has been changed by the words of
Mumford.
Straight back, downstairs, in the room pre
pared by Leland Junior himself, a disheveled
buccaneer snarls from a painting opposite the
doorway. He is unlabeled, and no one knows
who he was or what Leland saw in him worth
hanging.
Leaving the building, you walk down steps
between two statues. On your left is an ab
stract conception, Fede, a woman who has been
lipsticked by a Stanfordite who did not know
how authentically classical she was being; and
on your right is Menandro, who was incidentally
spelled "Meander" by the Florentine who
carved him.
So these are the personalities represented
at the place which, before the University was
conceived, Governor Stanford intended as a
rest stop for horse drivers 1 the vicinity, and
now is a symptom of our civilization's disorder
liness.
