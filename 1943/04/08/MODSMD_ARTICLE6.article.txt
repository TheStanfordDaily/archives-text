## Property Crew Has Headache 
### 
The properties crew of ' Do Re Mi,"
first offering of the Stanford Players
opening April 14, is having a ration
headache.
The play concerns the lives and
loves of the Sullivan family, who
reside in a small town in southern
Idaho, and in one important scene,
the script calls for a full course din
ner for the entire cast.
Such items as roast beef, coffee,
canned tomatoes, and a bowl of but
ter are supposed to grace the dinner
table, and are supposed to be con
sumed by all the cast at all five per
formances and three dress re
hearsals.
Now the properties crew is look
ing for realistic substitutes while the
cast dreams of thick slices of roast
beef.
The set for "Do Re Mi" is con
structed to resemble a typical small
town modern home and achieve a
realistic, homey atmosphere with
flowered wall paper and gay cur
tains.
The set is similar to the one used
in "Daisies on the Cartracks," Alla
dine Bell's first play produced here
last summer.
Working on the construction and
performance crews under Frederick
Sollens and William Girvan, are
Corinne Wollman, Jane Spaulding,
and Betty Wattenberger on the prop
erties crew.
Hal Levitt and Christine Mansfield
will handle the lighting.
Since the dates for "Do Re Mi"
have been changed from the original
announcement to April 14, 15. IG, 17.
and 19, new reservations are now
being taken at the box office for
season ticket subscribers.
