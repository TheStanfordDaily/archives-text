## Dimes, Stamps Days Combined 
### 
The first War Stamp Day of Spring
Quarter will be held today, with liv
ing group chairmen and Quad sales
men contacting students. Because
many groups were not contacted
Monday night in the Dimes for Di
plomas drive, dimes will be collected
by the stamp salesmen on Quad to
day.
"It is going to be harder than ever
this quarter to make our stamp sales
show that we are really doing some
thing for the war effort because we
are fewer in number," said Carol
Hurwitz, stamp chairman. "That
fact alone, however, should induce
each one of us to buy more stamps
because we will know that it will
help many of our former classmates.
So don't forget to buy stamps, and
buy an extra one for the Stanford
I men who are now in the service."
j Women's Groups

groups contributed generously to
the Dimes lor Diplomas drive. All
