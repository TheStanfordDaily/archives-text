# Holsti Returns to Campus After Eastern Conference
## 
### Jane Sudekum 
Dr. Rudolf Holsti, professor of
political science, has returned to the
campus after attending the fifth
Pan-American Conference in New
York City. Another Stanford man,
Alfred Guerard, professor of ro
manic language who is now on leave
doing government work, also at
tended the conference.
Delegates to the conference were
summoned to study the judicial, eco
nomic, and cultural aspects of a
European federation. Dr. Holsti, be
cause of his experience in world
politics, worked on the judicial di
vision, and Guerard on the cultural.
The latter recently had an article
published in "Free World" in wlvich
he advocated a common language,
basic Latin, for world use.
Members of the conference were
divided into 10 sub-committees, to
make studies of these three aspects
and they will report to the next
Pan-European Conference, to be
convened in June.
Speaking before the final banquet,
held in the Waldorf-Astoria, William
C. Bullitt said. "The world needs a
strong, integrated democratic Eu
rope. A loosely held together ag
glomeration of weaknesses is not
strength. Such a Europe might slip
rapidly into another uneasy balance
of power or, if it should not be
armed, into a balance of importance
and fall prey to internal and ex
ternal pressures."
U.S. To Participate
He also stated that "The people of
the United States will participate in
the organization of world peace if
the terms proposed for the peace
settlement accord with the principles
of the Atlantic Charter."
The interest of the people of the
United States was demonstrated by
the participation of many Americans
in the conference. Both Cordell
Hull and Sumner Wells addressed
letters to the group, wishing it
success.
Organized in
The Pan-American Union was or
ganized by the president. Count
Courdenhove-Kalergi, in 1923. Its
headquarters were in Vienna. How
ever, when the Germans took Aus
tria, all of its archives were de
stroyed. Count Courdenhove-Ka
lergi escaped to Czechoslovakia,
later fleeing to France, from whence
he came to the United States.
It is his dream to have a united

democratic continent of Europe. This
will be strictly continental, not in
cluding England, and strictly Euro
pean, not including Russia.
Four Meeting's Held
Prior to the war, four meetings
had been held, with official repre
sentatives from many European
governments attending. At the meet
ing in New York, called at the invi
tation of New York University
through its Research Seminar for
Postwar European Federation, most
of the representatives were refugees
and attended without official author
ization. Delegates included men
from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Finland.
Norway, Spain, Austria, Rumania,
Luxembourg, Denmark. Finland,
Greece, Switzerland, and Britain.
The Finnish people in the Bay
area sent Dr. Holsti to the meeting.

Four Meeting's Held
Prior to the war, four meetings
had been held, with official repre
sentatives from many European
governments attending. At the meet
ing in New York, called at the invi
tation of New York University
through its Research Seminar for
Postwar European Federation, most
of the representatives were refugees
and attended without official author
ization. Delegates included men
from Czechoslovakia, Italy, Finland.
Norway, Spain, Austria, Rumania,
Luxembourg, Denmark. Finland,
Greece, Switzerland, and Britain.
The Finnish people in the Bay
area sent Dr. Holsti to the meeting.


DR. ALBERT GUERAkI)
Dr. Rudolf Holsti, professor of
political science, has returned to the
campus after attending the fifth
Pan-American Conference in New
York City. Another Stanford man,
Alfred Guerard, professor of ro
manic language who is now on leave
doing government work, also at
tended the conference.
Delegates to the conference were
summoned to study the judicial, eco
nomic, and cultural aspects of a
European federation. Dr. Holsti, be
cause of his experience in world
politics, worked on the judicial di
vision, and Guerard on the cultural.
The latter recently had an article
published in "Free World" in wlvich
he advocated a common language,
basic Latin, for world use.
Members of the conference were
divided into 10 sub-committees, to
make studies of these three aspects
and they will report to the next
Pan-European Conference, to be
convened in June.
Speaking before the final banquet,
held in the Waldorf-Astoria, William
C. Bullitt said. "The world needs a
strong, integrated democratic Eu
rope. A loosely held together ag
glomeration of weaknesses is not
strength. Such a Europe might slip
rapidly into another uneasy balance
of power or, if it should not be
armed, into a balance of importance
and fall prey to internal and ex
ternal pressures."
U.S. To Participate
He also stated that "The people of
the United States will participate in
the organization of world peace if
the terms proposed for the peace
settlement accord with the principles
of the Atlantic Charter."
The interest of the people of the
United States was demonstrated by
the participation of many Americans
in the conference. Both Cordell
Hull and Sumner Wells addressed
letters to the group, wishing it
success.
Organized in
The Pan-American Union was or
ganized by the president. Count
Courdenhove-Kalergi, in 1923. Its
headquarters were in Vienna. How
ever, when the Germans took Aus
tria, all of its archives were de
stroyed. Count Courdenhove-Ka
lergi escaped to Czechoslovakia,
later fleeing to France, from whence
he came to the United States.
It is his dream to have a united

democratic continent of Europe. This
will be strictly continental, not in
cluding England, and strictly Euro
pean, not including Russia.
