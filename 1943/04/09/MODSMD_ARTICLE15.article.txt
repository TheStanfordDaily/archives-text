## 
### Jane Glasson 
Six casualties, war and otherwise,
have been suffered by the cast of
"Do Re Mi," which Director F.
Cowles Strickland is preparing for
a five-day production schedule be
ginning next Wednesday.
Beginning with John Lawry, who
was the original "John Sullivan" in
the new comedy by Alladine Bell,

ing men.
When Lawry, star of many campus
shows, developed measles, Ed Keat
ing took over the part, only to be
shifted to another role, that of Dal,
the older brother.
Third John
Here David Blees, who appeax-ed
briefly but notably in "In Time To
Come" last Winter Quarter, took
over, and the casting problem was
ostensibly solved for all time. The
director thought so at least.
But at the end of Winter Quarter,
Blees failed to return to school be
cause of illness, and the present, fi
nal John Sullivan, who is William
Hawkes, stepped into the role.
The original Mary Sullivan, an
*>lder sister who leaves her husband
Dvery time she wants an excuse to
visit home, was Marcia Shaugh
lessy. But last week she married
A.sher Wilson, whom many students
vvill remember as a former star of
•ampus productions, and her role
was filled by Jean Robinson, the
oresent Mary.

Finally, Ed Keating's enlistment in
he Navy opened his role to Wally
Thompson, who now plays the teas
ng older brother of the Sullivan
amily.
Director Strickland now feels the
:ast is set, and according to him, the
inal production in the Little Theater
next Wednesday, Thursday, Friday,
Saturday, and Monday nights has
jvery indication of being an out
standing comedy success.
