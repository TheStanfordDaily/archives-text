# Dr. Helen Pryor Charts Accepted
## 
### 
The United States Navy recently
adopted standard weight tables tak
ing into consideration not only age
and height but also body build.
These tables were devised by Dr.
Helen B. Pryor, mcdical advisor of
Stanford women.
The table makes it possible for
many men and women formerly
rejected because of overweight or
underweight to be accepted for
training.
Dr. Pryor began her research 10
years ago. measuring more than 12.-
000 persons from one to forty-plus.
From these figures she was able to
gather data so that pelvic chest
width measurements are used in
her tables to determine a correct
weight.
Dr. Pryor's tables are now used in
the medical profession and by schools
and insurance companies.
New Mexico as a whole enjoys 74
per cent of possible sunshine the
year around.
