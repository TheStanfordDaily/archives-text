# SWB Outlines Procedures for Filling Pledges
## 
### 
Betty Mae Haje, new War Eoard
Coordinator, yesterday announced
the procedures to be used in filling
tlie eight-hour monthly war work
pledges.
Students who pledged themselves
to roll bandages in the Surgical
Dressings Workroom should go on
the hours for which they have signed
and work. There will be a Red Cross
worker present to whom each stu
dent should give her name. The
worker will in turn give the names
to the War Board.
Departmental Work
Students who have volunteered to
do departmental work should wait
until they are called by the depart
ment or other campus agency. Ac
cording to Miss Hale the lists of
students available have not as j'et
been completed but will be given to
the departments by the first of the
week. "This," she said, ''is the only
phase of the war work program for
which there is no immediate work
for the women."
Those who have signed for U.S.O.
work and who have not as yet had
the U.S.O. course should sign up for
the course with Miss Pat in the "Y"
office. Those students who have
completed the course and who wish
to work at the Hospitality House on
some particular Saturday may call
June Ellis; however, she will usually
call the women who volunteered
when thev are needed.
I SO. SWB Work
Women will also be called when
they are needed for both the faculty
entertainment and the Page Mill en
tertainment. Women who give skits
from the Spring Show at Page Mill
will receive credit for the time spent.
Women who have volunteered to
work at the War Board Office will
be called when needed. "We are
trying to use as many new women
as possible," Miss Hale said, "and as
soon as possible."
