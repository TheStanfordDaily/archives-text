# 100 Spikemen to Gather Here For Cinder Meet Tomorrow
## 
### 
Bay Area track and field makes
its outdoor debut tomorrow on An
gell Field, when a class 100 of what's
left of Northern California's '43 cin
der cro > compete in Pitch Johnson's
First Annual Invitational.
High jump, pole vault, and shot
put events all get underway cit 2
p.m.. with the mile run scheduled
to open the track festivities at 2:30.
Standouts of the many features of
!he meet are the battle for the team
championship and the mile run.
Stanford, California, San Jose State.
Fresno State, and St. Mary's are all
entering squads capable of walking
ft with high-point honors, with the
Indians and Bears given a slight
edge.
2SI Cards Enter
Johnson is entering 29 Cards in
:.n attempt to pick up all stray points
possible, while Cal Coach A1 Ragan
js sending over a 13-man squad.
San Jose State will have 18 com
peting, and St. Mary's Pre-Flight 8.
Fresno's entry list is doubtful; the
Bulldogs are short on finances and
--.lay not send their five-man team
down.
With four of the premiere milers
•n California entered, the first event
£ets the nod as the feature of the
cinder program. Ralph Dewey of
California, Stanford's Bob Compton,
Pre-Flight's Bob Forsman, and high
schooler Murray Collins make up
the quartet, all of whom are good
for around 4:25.
Jordan in Hun
In the sprints, fans will have a
chance to see Payton Jordan, former
S.C. star now at Pre-Flight, go up
r.gainst two of the biggest fields in
the meet. Jordan has run :9.6 in
the century, and may get down near
that mark if pressed tomorrow.
Stanford's Johnny Fulton and
Cal's Jim Dunn will renew their
feud in the quarter, making that
event second only to ihe mile in
spectator appeal. Dunn took Fulton
m the recent Olympic Club indoor
neet, but Johnny is in good shape
ind gunning for an upset.
i>iscus Spotlight
Field event spotlight, despite the
doss of the pole vault and high jump
'fields, falls on a pair of high school
boys, Jack Burke of St. Ignatius and
•Voodson Linn of Santa Clara. Both
can do better than 145 feet in the
c.iscus and 4fi feet in the shot, and
may well monopolize the weight
events.
Should the meet run as close as
expected, the team championship
might easily be decided by the relay,
f.nd with Fulton and Dunn running
the anchor legs for Stanford and
California, the baton event will also
be one of the best of the day.
