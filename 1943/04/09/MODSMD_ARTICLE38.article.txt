# Baseball Team Will Travel To St. Mary's Tomorrow
## 
### Late Williams 
Stanford's baseball team will get a second chance to break into the win
column Saturday afternoon, when they engage the St. Mary's nine on the
Gael diamond.
The two teams appear to be practically even on paper, with a slight edge
going to the Gaels. The slight leeway favoring the nine from Moraga is

â–ºattributed to the fact that although
losing to California's loop leaders,
the Gaels held the score down to a
two-run margin. California beat
U.S.F. 21-2. and the Indians, in their
first outing, dropped a 4-0 game to
1 the Dons,
"Ironman" To Oppose Mason
If the armed forces have not
reached him, as they have reached
most of the athletes this year, St.
Mary's will probably send their
"Ironman of Sports," Tony Compag
no, to the mound to oppose Stan
ford's Doc; Mason. If Compagno is not
available, the job will fall to Marv
Kranda.
Arnold Bolsters Outfield
The outfield yesterday was bol
stered by Dick Arnold, who was a
j member of the frosh team two years
ago. In practice Arnold showed po
tential strength at bat, and this is
| something that the Farm hiders are
in dire need of. Wolter also has a
couple of men that are showing up
well in the practice sessions but are
at the present time ineligible.
Stanford's probable lineup:
Roinstead, 2b; Washburn, cf;
Brown, ss; Merriman, lb; Walkup, c;
Cunha, 11; McKie, 3b; Pinion, if;
and Mason, p.
