# Indian Bowlers Seek to Meet Cal
## 
### 
Joe Byrne, captain of Stanford's
bowling aggregation, announced
yesterday that he is negotiating with
California for a rematch. Two
matches have been played this sea
son, the Cards splitting with Cal.
This third encounter will decide the
Bay Area championship.
Stanford bowlers have always had
a strong squad, having been inter
collegiate champions for two years
running. This year the lack of the
annual College Classic has upset
predictions and no team will wear
the crown.
Pre - match prognostications seem
to favor the Bears slightly as they
have a strong squad and the Indians
are handicapped by the loss of Gene
Foster and Bill Harms to the armed
forces. Jim Kresl and Tex Ritter
â€¢ will undoubtedly be called to fill up
the gaps and this five presents a
strong challenge.
Regulars Joe Byrne, Don Richards
and Frank Tibbetts complete the
lineup.
