# Crippled Farm Swim Team Favored in Meet With C.O.P.
## 
### 
Crippled but still favored by a
small margin, Stanford's swimming
squad goes against College of Pacific
at 2 tomorrow. It will be the first
collegiate meet of the season for
Card Coach Ernie Brandsten's gang,
which, in the last two weeks has
lost five of its top men.
Led by freestyle ace Fred Taola,
C.O.P. is sending up a potent squad
which may even force the issue as
far as the freestyle relay. Should
this be the case, Brandsten feels
that Stanford's quartet of Bill Ma
pel, Enimett Cashin, Hank Salton
stall, and Don Smith will be able to
take the Tiger four even if Taola
swims the anchor lap.
Feature of the swimfest will be
Cashin's attempt at the 200- and
220-yard breaststroke world records.
The Indian ace will get about the
best competition in the country
from C.O.P.'s Wright, who has never
lost to Cashin by more than four
feet.
Strong in Sprints
Stanford's strongest events ap
pear to be the sprints, where Mapel
and Smith ought to be good for first
and second in both the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle. Both boys turned in
practice efforts around :24.8 in the
50 and :55 in the 100 during the
week.
The Farm medley relay quartet
of Bob Mapel. backstroke; Cashin,
breaststroke; and Saltonstall, free
style, also seems assured of taking
a first place. A1 Weeden, Brand

sten's best backstroker, is back i-i
school alter two weeks in the hos
pital, but is not ready for compe
tition.
Taola, along with Andrews, should
take tirst and second for the Tigers
in both the 220 and 440 freestyle
events, while the 150-yard back
stroke looms as something of a
toss-up.
Divers Picked to Win
Divers Dii k Marquette and Dick
Williams are picked by Brandsten
to take one-two in their event, since
C.O.P. doesn't seem to have much
of this kind of talent.
According to Brandsten. Taola
might actually swim in the 100 as
well as the ' 220 and 440. C.O.F
would thus be sacrificing any chanct
they have in the freestyle relay, bu'
would pick up a probable first place
in the century. Should Taola swin:
these three freestyle events, the In
dians may not win the meet by
better than a couple of points.

better than a couple of points.
Crippled but still favored by a
small margin, Stanford's swimming
squad goes against College of Pacific
at 2 tomorrow. It will be the first
collegiate meet of the season for
Card Coach Ernie Brandsten's gang,
which, in the last two weeks has
lost five of its top men.
Led by freestyle ace Fred Taola,
C.O.P. is sending up a potent squad
which may even force the issue as
far as the freestyle relay. Should
this be the case, Brandsten feels
that Stanford's quartet of Bill Ma
pel, Enimett Cashin, Hank Salton
stall, and Don Smith will be able to
take the Tiger four even if Taola
swims the anchor lap.
Feature of the swimfest will be
Cashin's attempt at the 200- and
220-yard breaststroke world records.
The Indian ace will get about the
best competition in the country
from C.O.P.'s Wright, who has never
lost to Cashin by more than four
feet.
Strong in Sprints
Stanford's strongest events ap
pear to be the sprints, where Mapel
and Smith ought to be good for first
and second in both the 50- and 100-
yard freestyle. Both boys turned in
practice efforts around :24.8 in the
50 and :55 in the 100 during the
week.
The Farm medley relay quartet
of Bob Mapel. backstroke; Cashin,
breaststroke; and Saltonstall, free
style, also seems assured of taking
a first place. A1 Weeden, Brand

sten's best backstroker, is back i-i
school alter two weeks in the hos
pital, but is not ready for compe
tition.
Taola, along with Andrews, should
take tirst and second for the Tigers
in both the 220 and 440 freestyle
events, while the 150-yard back
stroke looms as something of a
toss-up.
Divers Picked to Win
Divers Dii k Marquette and Dick
Williams are picked by Brandsten
to take one-two in their event, since
C.O.P. doesn't seem to have much
of this kind of talent.
According to Brandsten. Taola
might actually swim in the 100 as
well as the ' 220 and 440. C.O.F
would thus be sacrificing any chanct
they have in the freestyle relay, bu'
would pick up a probable first place
in the century. Should Taola swin:
these three freestyle events, the In
dians may not win the meet by
better than a couple of points.
