# "From These Honored Dead"
## 
### 
A YEAR ago today Bataan fell. Much has
happened since then. Many Americans
have died. And many Japanese have died.
Ships have been sunk; planes have gone down
in flames; and hope has seemed a luxury we
could not afford.
A year ago we were being badly beaten in
the Far East. Now we seem to be on the offen
sive, and starting to move back along the chain
of islands that fell so guickly to the Japanese.
It seems that the enemy has been driven
from Guadalcanal, but if that campaign is in
dicative of what each island will cost us in time,
equipment, and men, let us have our "loins girt
about with truth," and let us steel ourselves to
*he task.
When General Mac Arthur left the Philip
pines he said, "We are coming back." The
march has started. It is our duty to see that
it does not lose momentum.
It will be a long, hard, difficult struggle. We
will have reverses. We will lose ships and
planes, and many of our men will die, but "from
these honored dead we take increased devo
tion to that cause for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion."
