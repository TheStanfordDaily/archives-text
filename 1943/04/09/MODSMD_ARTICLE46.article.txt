# Election Day — Crisis for Student Government
## 
### 
OTANFORD goes to the polls today. But
O judging from past elections, we can truth
fully say, a fraction of the Associated Students
of Stanford University will today vote on a mea
sure which will make or break wartime student !
government on this capus.
Today's election concerns an amendment to
to the constitution, and it is the most radical i
change proposed in the history of -student gov- i
ernment at Stanford.
If the amendment is passed, two conditions
of the utmost importance to every member of
the student body will take effect.
1. It will be possible for a woman to be presi
dent of the Associated Students.
2. The constitution of the Associated Students
will be set aside for the duration of the war and
until such time as it is deemed advisable to
restore it.
Although this is the most radical change pro
posed for our unwieldy, inflexible constitution,
it is the only solution to the problem presented
by a constantly changing student body.
If student government is to survive, we must
have a president who can serve a full term of
office; we must have a governing body free to
adapt the character of student legislation to the
current, constantly changing demands placed on J
us by this national emergency.
During the last World War, student govern- :
ment, Stanford's pride, which was just gaining 1
a permanent place in campus life, tried desper- !
ately to function under the present constitution. I
Since this constitution states that only a man ;
may serve as president, five student body presl- ;
dents were elected in one year. Every month
or two, a new election was held.
Finally, because of an inflexible constitution,
student government collapsed, and the Admin
istration had to step in to regulate student ac
tivity.
Two things can jeopardize this privilege I
today. If the amendment does not pass, we can '

expect to see our own government slip away
from us. If, as in the last constitutional election,
only a few hundred from a student body of sev
eral thousand vote, the outcome, either positive
or negative, can not be called a representative
opinion.
Today is the crisis. Remember to vote, but
above all, remember to vote "YES."—Jane Glas
son.

Finally, because of an inflexible constitution,
student government collapsed, and the Admin
istration had to step in to regulate student ac
tivity.
Two things can jeopardize this privilege I
today. If the amendment does not pass, we can '

expect to see our own government slip away
from us. If, as in the last constitutional election,
only a few hundred from a student body of sev
eral thousand vote, the outcome, either positive
or negative, can not be called a representative
opinion.
Today is the crisis. Remember to vote, but
above all, remember to vote "YES."—Jane Glas

OTANFORD goes to the polls today. But
O judging from past elections, we can truth
fully say, a fraction of the Associated Students
of Stanford University will today vote on a mea
sure which will make or break wartime student !
government on this capus.
Today's election concerns an amendment to
to the constitution, and it is the most radical i
change proposed in the history of -student gov- i
ernment at Stanford.
If the amendment is passed, two conditions
of the utmost importance to every member of
the student body will take effect.
1. It will be possible for a woman to be presi
dent of the Associated Students.
2. The constitution of the Associated Students
will be set aside for the duration of the war and
until such time as it is deemed advisable to
restore it.
Although this is the most radical change pro
posed for our unwieldy, inflexible constitution,
it is the only solution to the problem presented
by a constantly changing student body.
If student government is to survive, we must
have a president who can serve a full term of
office; we must have a governing body free to
adapt the character of student legislation to the
current, constantly changing demands placed on J
us by this national emergency.
During the last World War, student govern- :
ment, Stanford's pride, which was just gaining 1
a permanent place in campus life, tried desper- !
ately to function under the present constitution. I
Since this constitution states that only a man ;
may serve as president, five student body presl- ;
dents were elected in one year. Every month
or two, a new election was held.
Finally, because of an inflexible constitution,
student government collapsed, and the Admin
istration had to step in to regulate student ac
tivity.
