THE regular Sunday morning reunion of the
Daily staff will take place at high noon in the
telephone booth of the Shack with plenty of
room guaranteed for all. Chairs will be reserved
for the men.
Before the general festivities begin, mem
bers of the Night Editors' Club, an exclusive
honorary, will convene for an enlightening lec
ture from the editor. His address is scheduled
for 11:30 a. m.
Visitors are welcome and will probably leave
the Shack with an imposing title and ten stories
to write.â€”Peggy Boothe.
