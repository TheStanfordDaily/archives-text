# BULL SESSION

### CYCLONE COVEY 
This will probably be the first time The
Daily has ever commented on one motion pic
ture in a review, an editorial, and Bull Session,
along with the paid ads. In this column, com
ment was delayed a day in order not to infringe
on the reviewer's territory; and such delay
happens also to have forestalled infringement
on Lucy's editorializing . . . For twice before
she has changed the subject of her edits when,
in the middle of their composition, Bull Session,
unconsciously unchivalrous, came in on the
same subject.
So this time both women got their say, but
not the last word.
In Which We Serve received the very in
adequate distinction of "best foreign film" in
last month's Academy Awards. But whereas
English films like Rebecca and Mrs. Miniver
can be accepted by provincial Americans as
not so remote from the American way, In Which
We Serve is English thoroughly and exclu
sively, and therefore quite foreign.
"This is the story of a ship," begins a voice,
and, totally unglamorized, that story unfolds by
way of flash-backs.
Noel Coward's curt speech as the ship's
captain, the approach to squalidness of some
of the domestic settings, the near dearth of
beauty in the female characters, the strutting
way the British soldiers march, the seeming in
sincerity of the characteristic British inflection
in questions, and even the pronunciation of the
ship's name, "Torrin," as "Tod-din"â€”are not
only unflattering to British culture, but perhaps
frankly repugnant to American audiences.
Yet, in scenes almost matter-of-fact, and
sometimes apparently stuffy from lack of emo
tion, the picture builds a cumulative impact as
great as any picture has ever achieved. And
those elements which appear disagreeable ac
tually work to the total good; for they are con
vincing of an absolutely faithful adherence to
truth.
