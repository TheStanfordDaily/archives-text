# Army to Establish Reclassification Unit
## 
### 
Stanford has completed negotiations with Army officials to establish
a unit of up to 500 soldiers at the University for classifications and re
assignment. Members of the unit will arrive sometime this week, Chancel
lor Ray Lyman Wilbur stated.
t This unit will make its headquarters at Sequoia Hall but, if the ac
'commodations prove too small, some members will be moved to Branner
Hall. The Chancellor declared, however, that the University would attempt
to reserve Branner for the members of the advanced engineering unit
which is to be sent here.
The new unit is being sent to Stanford for classification and conse
quently the stay of each individual trainee will vary from one day to one
month. After the soldiers will be sent to a unit in the
Army specialized training program. , .
Stanford is one of three colleges in the United States selected for such
units. The soldiers will be sent here from induction centers. They will be
given tests to determine to which specialized training unit they should be
sent.
The unit will be organized and operated under the "cadet system."
It will be divided into regiments, battalions and companies. Selected
trainees will be appointed acting commissioned officers and noncommis
sioned officers. TOUTS of duty will be rotated to give the maximum number
an opportunity to exercise leadership and responsibilities and to demon
strate their abilities. They will carry out all of the functions of any office

to which they are appointed.
The soldiers selected for such specialized training units must have high
marks in various 'Army tests, and hav,e at least one year and less than
three full years of work at college level.
This unit is distinfct from the advanced Army engineering unit which
is to be sent to Stanford. The contract for this engineering unit has been
signed and they are expected to arrive at any time. Branner Hall was
cleared for their occupation on March 30, at which time the contract with
the Army took effect.
In addition Stanford has been declared eligible to receive advanced
training units in pre-medicine, psychology, basic training, and the so-called
"area studies."
The latter program is one to train the Army officers to serve as military
occupation officials and post-war administrators in the various zones of war.
The whole program of schooling Army officers in the colleges is de
signed to provide the Army with various classes of experienced technicians.
The keynote of the program has been made the soldier in college and not
college boys in uniform.
The Army has requested, however, that the advanced engineering unit
be considered a part of the student body. All entertainment and other
social relations with the unit will consequently be handled by the vice
president of the A.S.S.U., Janet McClanahan, and not, as it was originally
thought, by the Stanford War Board.
