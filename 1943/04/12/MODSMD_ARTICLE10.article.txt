# Reds Downed by St. Mary's, 5 to 4
## 
### 
Stanford's unluckiest athletic
team, the baseball nine, lost a heart
breaker to St. Mary's 5-4 Saturday
on the Gael diamond. The winning
run was scored in the ninth inning
when Johnny Podesta of football
fame hit a triple, scoring Joe Josephs
from first.
The Indians knocked out nine
hits but were unable to put them to
gether. Some beautiful fielding by
St. Mary's stopped many a Red rally.
The Gaels were only able to collect
three hits off the combined talents
of Doc Maso.il and Jack Miller, but
managed to get them when they
really counted.
Bob Brown was the leading man
at the plate, getting three hits for
iour times at bat. The Moragamen
had a bad day in the field commit
ting four errors while Stanford made
two bobbles.
Coach Wolter was pleased with
the showing his pitching staff made.
Mason started the game but was
forced to retire when he injured his
back in the fourth inning. Miller
took over from there and did an
equally fine job on the mound.
1 he Cards luive their third chance
to break into the win column this
Wednesday afternoon when they
travel to Santa Clara to engage the
second-place Broncos.
