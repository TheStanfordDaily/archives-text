# INVITATIONAL
## California Wins Track Meet; Johnny Fulton, Jordan Star 
### Ed Luce 
Johnny Fulton, Pay ton Jordan, and
a well conditioned California track
team stole Stanford's invitational
meet Saturday, even though Pitch
Johnson's brainstorm produced
plenty of other fine performances
before the afternoon was over.
And while the San Francisco Ex
aminer called Jordan the "hero" of
the day, the title goes to Fulton as
far as we're concerned. Johnny ran
the fastest 440 of his life (:48.2) to
wax Cal's Jim Dunn, came back half
an hour later to waltz through his
220 heat, and then fought Jordan the
whole way in the finals before losing
by inches. Jordan's time was :21.6,
Fulton's must have been:21.7.
Payton Double Winner
Blond Payton was the only double
winner of the day, easily capturing
the 100 in :9.7.
Fulton's favorite race last year,
the 880, was taken over by a couple
of Stanford freshmen. Glen Holtby
and Floyd Cuff, who grabbed first
and second in 1:59.8.
The meet was a success all the
way around, except that A 1 Ragan's
Bears, helped out no little by the
failure of Fresno State's hurdlers to
show up, romped off with 51 points
and the team title. Stanford scored
42 4/5, St. Mary's Pre-Flight 23, and
San Jose State 20.

second. Stanford's Bob Compton set

the fastest 440 of his life (:48.2) to
wax Cal's Jim Dunn, came back half
an hour later to waltz through his
220 heat, and then fought Jordan the
whole way in the finals before losing
by inches. Jordan's time was :21.6,
Fulton's must have been:21.7.
Payton Double Winner
Blond Payton was the only double
winner of the day, easily capturing
the 100 in :9.7.
Fulton's favorite race last year,
the 880, was taken over by a couple
of Stanford freshmen. Glen Holtby
and Floyd Cuff, who grabbed first
and second in 1:59.8.
The meet was a success all the
way around, except that A 1 Ragan's
Bears, helped out no little by the
failure of Fresno State's hurdlers to
show up, romped off with 51 points
and the team title. Stanford scored
42 4/5, St. Mary's Pre-Flight 23, and
San Jose State 20.
Cal Starts Off
Ragan's gang started right off in
the mile run, Ralph Dewey and
Jerry Ring, the latter supposedly
laid up with a cold, taking first and
second. Stanford's Bob Compton set
the pace for three laps, then tired as
