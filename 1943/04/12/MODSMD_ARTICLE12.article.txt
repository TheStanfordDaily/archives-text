### 
J he War Production Hoard has clamped down on "uncontrolled" buy
ins of laboratory equipment by colleges which are getting ready for an
influx of Army and Navy trainees.
In order to assure all colleges sufficient equipment to teach the physics
and other required science courses to their military students, the WPB

ordered that colleges must get the 1
Board's approval before ordering
supplis.
Excessive buying in one college
can be checked by the program, and
the available laboratory equipment
will be spread equitably among the
various colleges which need it. Be
fore restrictions, supplies were being
ordered by colleges at a rate which
threatened to soak up more equip
ment than manufacturers could
produce in two years.
The actual terms of the order pro
vide that colleges must fill out a
WPB form, submit it to the WPB,
and present the approved form to
manufacturers when they order.
Officials said the form would re- i
quire orrly one day to clear through
