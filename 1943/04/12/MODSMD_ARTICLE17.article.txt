MOST of the fronts in this war are like the
little boys who, if nothing is heard of
them, are gettng into touble.
Little news has been released lately about
the Pacific theater of the war but what news has
come out has been of a rather foreboding na
ture. The Japanese are bringing up reinforce
ments because every day or so Mac Arthur's
headquarters announces a raid on a Japanese
transport or convoy. The Japanese are building
fortifications because Mac Arthur announces
raids on new Jap bases.
Right now the United States is watching
Africa, but the Japanese aren't watching Africa
except maybe with one-sixth of one eye. They
are spending all of their time and energy on
their own war, and they think that they can win
it.

They aren't stopping taking time out to
watch someone else fight. So, when the Axis is
pushed out of Africa, and that may take several
more weeks, Washington will announce either
a big battle in the Pacific or else an impending
battle. Then all of the people in the United
States can turn their chairs around and watch
the Pacific while the Army prepares another
fight in Africa or Europe. It is very difficult to
watch a two-ring circus, especially when the
action, although continuous, is only announced
over the loudspeaker in one ring at a time.—
