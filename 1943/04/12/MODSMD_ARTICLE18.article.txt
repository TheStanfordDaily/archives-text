# They Also Serve

A LITTLE while ago Archibald MacLeish
called this war a Women's War. He didn't
mean that the war was brought on by women
but that more than any other group the women
of the United Nations have an interest in the
winning of the war by the United Nations.
In no phase of their organization, cultural,
political, or social, are the United Nations more
distinct from the Axis than in their attitude to
ward women. In the Axis countries and their
allies, women have no rights and no functions
except that of bearing children and doing that
work which either the men do not want to do
or which there are not enough men to do.
In the United Nations, on the other hand, the
women are accorded almost equal rghts. They
may vote and they may hold any job which they
have the ability to fill.
Thus the women, more than any other group,
are fighting for their way of life.
How they fight for this way of life will also
probably decide the outcome of the war. If the
women of the United States, like the women of
Russia and England and China, can mobilize
themselves effectively, they will provide the
extra margain which will mean victory.
The United Nations, it is true, have far

greater resources than the Axis, but these re
sources must be developed before they will
count in the fight. It is up to the women, since
a large number of the effective men are required
for military service, to develop these resources.
In addition the women have to carry on the
daily humdrum activities which are necessary
in a complex civilization like the one in which
we live. The extent to which the women can
remember this and live by it, will determine in
the long run the outcome of the war.â€”Lucile
