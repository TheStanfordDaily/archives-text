# Think Now
## 
### 
NOMINATIONS for the office of president
of the student body will be made tomorrow.
Now is the time to think about the candidates
for that office. The student who is elected should
be able to stay at Stanford. It takes time to
learn how the A.S.S.U. runs, and it takes even
longer to run it. Students, when they are making
their nominations, should remember this as well
as the gualifications of the candidates for the
office.â€”Lucile Thompson
