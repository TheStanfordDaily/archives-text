## Axis Pushed to Last Foothold 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., North Africa, April
11, (U.R) American forces have
smashed back through Faid Pass to
avenge their February defeat there
and Allied armies driving 25 miles
north of Sfax and to the outskirts of
Kairouan have compressed the Axis
into one-eighth of Tunisia and its
last African foothold, it was disclosed
tonight..
The Axis was flying gasoline and
other supplies to its retreating
armies aboard Junkers transport
planes but American fighters and
Mitchell bombers shot down 61 of
the big carriers yesterday and to
day in the Sicilian Straights.
The British Eighth Army mean
while captured the town of La Hen
cha in its lightning attack up the
Swoussa road from Sfax.
All Axis resistance appeared to be
collapsing south of the thick Tunis-
Bizerte defense belt except in the
Swoussa area.
So rapid was the enemy's retreat
that it was now believed that Rom
mel would' not attempt to hold his
last east coast harbor at Swoussa.
A BBC broadcast said the whole
Axis front in Southern Tunisia is
crumbling and Rommel is in full re
treat into the northern pocket after
having lost 50 per cent of his Italian
troops.
