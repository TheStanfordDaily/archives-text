### CYCLONE COVEY 
Expertly tripping the light fantastic was our
genial Dr. Savelle; and Stanford revelers were
soon kicking out with hoedown highly pell-mell.
But students of Stanford can catch on fast
when they are a mind to play; and brother, like
galloping get-out, they set to and pronto made
hey.
This was the Ranch Rumpus folk-meet, which
was really not thought to work; but I'll swan
lads and lassies, if after all we didn't go whole
hog berserk.
The Women's Gym was quite the scene of
unprecedented levity; its very walls embraced
their sides beholding such festivity.
Around the ba'llroom in triple time, the crowd
liked the waltzing the best; but the schottische
was nearly as favored, and the polka, the two
step, and the rest.
Exhibition at intermission saw the squash
cut by gay blades; and as you know, in the patio,
were promenades and lemonades.
Barefoot girls with cheeks so rouged, and
bejeaned wolves in sheep-herder's clothing,
were tripping around or stumbling down, but
over the floor all-roving.
And 400 collegiate sophisticates next to the
last had found, that it is fun, to "Twelve Jumps"
music, just to skip and jump up and down.
And next morning on the grammar school
grounds, some roughs had happened to mosey;
and with Ed Carpenter loudly calling the song,
they were ringing around the rosie.
So comes to Ellen Davis and whomever else
in charge: Let's raise another Rumpus before
we're saluting a sarge.
