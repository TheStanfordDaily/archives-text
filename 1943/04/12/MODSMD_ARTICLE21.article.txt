# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
It is most unfortunate that so many people
missed the carefully planned "Know Stanford"
activities forum last Wednesday night.
The program was excellent —interesting and
instructive —and such prominent campus fig
ures as Paul C. Edwards, J. P. Mitchell, and
Frank Fsh Walker gave up their evenings and
came, some of them as far as from San Fran
cisco, to answer questions and help clarify
Stanford activities to the Student Body.
The attendance ratio was about 50 to 5 —50
women and 5 men, and that is all. I cannot help
but express my disgust on the lackadaisical,
devil-may-care attitude of the majority of Stan
ford students. This is the time we should be
most interested in keeping our government and
activities smoothly coordinated, and we should
always respect the time and int est of our Ad
ministration. —Disgusted.
