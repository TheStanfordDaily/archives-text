# DO RE MI
## Play Rehearsal Indicates Hit 
### 
Dress rehearsals for "Do Re Mi,"
Adeline Bell's new comedy open
ing in the Little Theater Wednesday,
look like a continual fight.
And when the neighbors of the
Sullivan family, about whom the
play is written, hear their conversa
tion, they wonder about the happi
ness of the family circle.
But the Sullivans are just having
fun, for they seem to think argu
ment is the only form of conversa
tion. Their teasing and haranguing
isn't taken seriously, so the play
turns out to be gay comedy.
Confuses Girls
Mi's. Sullivan causes no end of
trouble in the script when she con
tinually confuses her son's girl
friends. She thinks all girls come
wrapped in cellophane, and can't
quite tell them apart.
According to Director F. Cowles
Strickland, Samuel French Publish
ing Company of New York is con
sidering publishing this latest play
of Miss Bell's, who is an instructor
in the speech and drama department.
Opens Wednesday
After reading the script of "Do
Re Mi" the company expressed its
interest and is waiting for the pro
duction of the play here before con
tracting for it.
The play opens Wednesday night
for a five-day rim in the Little The
ater. Tickets are available at the
box office.
