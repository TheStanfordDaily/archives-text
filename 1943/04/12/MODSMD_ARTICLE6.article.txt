# Dimes Committee Sets $100 Goal
## 
### 
Dimes for Diplomas will be col
lected in all living groups today and
during house meetings for the sec
ond time this quarter. Collection
boxes will be placed in the Cellar;
all students who belong to no spe
cific living group may put their
dimes in these.
"Last week's contributions to the
drive were much higher than we
expected in view of the drop in en
rollment this quarter; in fact we
were surprised," said Cally Curtis,
chairman of the drive.
"We have set our goal for the
quarter at $lOO a week; the problem
we face is to provide centers for
collecting dimes from those who do
not live in a hall or on the Row and
for members of the disbanded eat
ing clubs," added 'Miss Curtis.
The money collected in the Dimes
Drive is used to buy War Bonds.
