## 
### 
With about 10 per cent of the stu
dent body casting ballots, the con
stitutional amendment to set aside
the constitution for the duration
passed by a vote of 226 to 65 in the
special election Friday.
In accordance with its provision
that upon passage a special election
to fill the vacant student body presi
dency shall be called by the execu
tive committee, an election will be
held this Thursday in which both
men and women candidates are
eligible to rim.
Nominations are to be made to
morrow on blanks which will be
available in boxes on the Quad from
8 a.m. to 5 p. m.
Nomination Blanks
"All nomination blanks must be
placed in these boxes by 5 p.m. to
morrow with the signatures of at
least 15 students. None will be ac
cepted after that, time," declared
Irma Cunha, election board chair
man.
Following nominations, an assem
bly will be held on Wednesday at a
time yet to be decided. Declinations
will be made then. On Thursday,
students will elect a student body
president to serve until the end of
Fall Quarter.
Of the 281 students who voted
Friday, 157 were men, 124 women
Constitutional amendments require
two-thirds of the votes cast for pass
age. There were 65 "no" votes regis
tered against the proposed amend
ment.
Spirit Followed
Although the passage of the
amendment sets aside the present
constitution for as long as deemed
necessary by the President of the
University, its functions and spirit
are to be followed as far as possible.
Student government will be di
rected by an emergency executive
committee. The supplementary guide
plan recommends that its member
ship consists of a president, vice
president, two upper and two lower
division representatives, one mem
ber at large, and the present ex of
ficio members plus a representative
of the armed services on the campus.
If the president elected Thursday
leaves school before his term ends,
the guide plan provides that he be
succeeded by the vice-president.
That office would then be filled by a
vote of three-fourths of the execu
tive committee from among the upper
division representatives on the com
mittee or from the runners up for
president and vice-president^
The plan also provides that a
woman may run for the office of
president. Thus, for the first time in
its history, Stanford may have a
woman for A.S.S.U. president. This
amendment was passed to prevent
a reoccurrence of the situation dur
ing last war when five presidents
were elected in one quarter.

man.

Friday, 157 were men, 124 women
Constitutional amendments require
two-thirds of the votes cast for pass
age. There were 65 "no" votes regis
tered against the proposed amend
ment.
Spirit Followed
Although the passage of the
amendment sets aside the present
constitution for as long as deemed
necessary by the President of the
University, its functions and spirit
are to be followed as far as possible.
Student government will be di
rected by an emergency executive
committee. The supplementary guide
plan recommends that its member
ship consists of a president, vice
president, two upper and two lower
division representatives, one mem
ber at large, and the present ex of
ficio members plus a representative
of the armed services on the campus.
If the president elected Thursday
leaves school before his term ends,
the guide plan provides that he be
succeeded by the vice-president.
That office would then be filled by a
vote of three-fourths of the execu
tive committee from among the upper
division representatives on the com
mittee or from the runners up for
president and vice-president^
The plan also provides that a
woman may run for the office of
president. Thus, for the first time in
its history, Stanford may have a
woman for A.S.S.U. president. This
amendment was passed to prevent
a reoccurrence of the situation dur
ing last war when five presidents
were elected in one quarter.
With about 10 per cent of the stu
dent body casting ballots, the con
stitutional amendment to set aside
the constitution for the duration
passed by a vote of 226 to 65 in the
special election Friday.
In accordance with its provision
that upon passage a special election
to fill the vacant student body presi
dency shall be called by the execu
tive committee, an election will be
held this Thursday in which both
men and women candidates are
eligible to rim.
