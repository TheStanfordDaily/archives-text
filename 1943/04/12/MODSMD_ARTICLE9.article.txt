# Cashin Erases Seven Breaststroke Record.
## Indian Mermen Defeat C.O.P. 
### Late Williams 
Emmett Cashin, Stanford's Na
tional Collegiate Breaststroke cham
pion, shattered three world records
Saturday in the Stanford pool.
Cashin erased altogether seven rec
ords from the books as he sped over
the 200-yard course in 2:19.
The effort wiped out the former
World, Intercollegiate, and National
A.A.U. records of 2:22 set by Rich
ard B. Hough of Princeton Univer
sity in 1939. His performance far
overshadowed the Indian swimming
team's squeeze play 38-37 victory
over the College of Pacific.
Extra 20 Yards
After finishing the scheduled 200
yards, Cashin continued foi an extra
20 yards and was clocked at the 220
mark in 2:33.7, thus breaking an
other A.A.U. and world record. The
former time for the 220-yard breast
stroke was 2:38.4, held by Jack Kas
ley and set in 1936.
The sixth and seventh records
came when he erased the 200-meter
records.
Probably the most amazing part of
Cashin's triumph was the fact that
he covered the first 100 yards in
1:02.3, and. added to that, it was the
first time that any of the sports
writers in attendance had ever heard
of a swimmer breaking seven rec
ords in one event at the same time.
Relay Team Wins
Although the records are not as
yel official, the necessary documents
attesting to Cashin's accomplishment
have been filed, and they are ex
pected to be recognized as official
without any hesitation.
As to the rest of the meet, Stan
ford found itself six points behind
(he Tiger swimmers with only the
relay remaining. However, the
Cards' 400-yard team composed of
Don Smith. Bill Mapel, Emmett

Cashin, and Hank Sultonstall com
pletely outclassed the opposing tank
; ers, gaining seven points and the
j meet.
Stanford's victory came mainly
through the second and third places
that they managed to pick up. Ralph
Wright, Sam Wright, Roddy An
drews, and Fred Taioli of the visi
tors picked up five first places, and
combined to capture the 300-yard
medley relay.
Besides the 400-yard relay and
Cashin's win, the Indian mermen
I took only one more first place. Dick
Marquette, and Dick Williams placed
; one-two in the diving event.
