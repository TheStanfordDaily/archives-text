# Requirements Set For Motor Corps
## 
### 
Women who have volunteered for
work with the Red Cross Motor j
Corps should telephone Mrs. Merk,
head of the Stanford Unit, at 828(5
or Elizabeth Chandler, student co
ordinator of the unit, at 25675. Betty
May Hale announced today.
"Full membership in the Motor
Corps," she continued, "requires a
course in first aid, motor mechanics,
blackout driving, and some knowl- J
edge of Civilian Defense practices. !
However, volunteers may begin j
serving with the corps while they are
getting their training.
"Volunteers should own cars, but
they will use the cars only for emer
gency service. They will drive the
chaptei station wagon on Saturday,
but much of their service is on the
campus. They help with the blood
donor transportation, bring mate
rials to the surgical dressings work
room, and are a part of the Civilian
Defense casualty station organization
for practices and in emergencies.
"Volunteers," she concluded,
"pledge a hundred hours a year and
may be transferred to home chapters
during vacations and after gradua- i
tion."
