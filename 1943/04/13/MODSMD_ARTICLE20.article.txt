## Bernard Woody Made Eligible To Pitch for Cardinal Team 
### Bill Allen 
Stanford baseball hopes took a
turn for the better yesterday when
Harry Wolter announced that Ber
nard Woody had been made eligible.
The only catch to the news is that
Woody is expecting his orders from
the Army at any time. Wolter is
hopeful that he will be around long
enough to give the ailing Doc Mason
a breather.
Doc, the only starting hurler left
on the staff, injured his back in the
St. Mary's contest and was still un
able to take an intensive workout
last night.
This leaves but one other pitcher
on the entire squad, the recently re
turned Jack Miller. Jack did a fine
job of relieving Mason against the
Gaels Saturday.
The team has been hitting very
well with Bob Brown and Lloyd
Merriman showing up strong at the
plate.
Wolter will take his charges to
Santa Clara to battle the powerful
Broncos on Wednesday. Team spirit
is very high and they hope to be able
to knock over the Bronc aggregation.

Santa Clara is one of the two
teams in the league that has not
been sorely hit by service calls. They
still possess an eligible squad two
or more deep at every position.
Santa Clara will feature the play
ing of Jess Frietas, football hero, in
the outfield. Jess is having a very
good year at bat and promises to be
in the Cards' hair all afternoon. The
Broncs can call on any one of three
starting pitchers, but the assignment
will undoubtedly go to Bob Croley,
their leading fast-ball artist. Crow
ley has successfully handcuffed ev
ery team in the league except the
California Bears, the Cards are lia
ble to find that they are going to
have rough going in the batter's box.
At this point Wolter is not certain
just what his starting lineup will be,
but he is expected to issue it to
morrow. It is doubtful whether the
fielding lineup will be changed since
the present infield and outfield is
one of the tightest in the league.
Coach Wolter is most worried about
the hard luck that seems to be fol
lowing the tettai since the two loop
losses.

turned Jack Miller. Jack did a fine
job of relieving Mason against the
Gaels Saturday.
The team has been hitting very
well with Bob Brown and Lloyd
Merriman showing up strong at the
plate.
Wolter will take his charges to
Santa Clara to battle the powerful
Broncos on Wednesday. Team spirit
is very high and they hope to be able
to knock over the Bronc aggregation.

Santa Clara is one of the two
teams in the league that has not
been sorely hit by service calls. They
still possess an eligible squad two
or more deep at every position.
Santa Clara will feature the play
ing of Jess Frietas, football hero, in
the outfield. Jess is having a very
good year at bat and promises to be
in the Cards' hair all afternoon. The
Broncs can call on any one of three
starting pitchers, but the assignment
will undoubtedly go to Bob Croley,
their leading fast-ball artist. Crow
ley has successfully handcuffed ev
ery team in the league except the
California Bears, the Cards are lia
ble to find that they are going to
have rough going in the batter's box.
At this point Wolter is not certain
just what his starting lineup will be,
but he is expected to issue it to
morrow. It is doubtful whether the
fielding lineup will be changed since
the present infield and outfield is
one of the tightest in the league.
Coach Wolter is most worried about
the hard luck that seems to be fol
lowing the tettai since the two loop
losses.
Stanford baseball hopes took a
turn for the better yesterday when
Harry Wolter announced that Ber
nard Woody had been made eligible.
The only catch to the news is that
Woody is expecting his orders from
the Army at any time. Wolter is
hopeful that he will be around long
enough to give the ailing Doc Mason
a breather.
Doc, the only starting hurler left
on the staff, injured his back in the
St. Mary's contest and was still un
able to take an intensive workout
last night.
This leaves but one other pitcher
on the entire squad, the recently re
turned Jack Miller. Jack did a fine
job of relieving Mason against the
Gaels Saturday.
