IN today's Daily is a story of some significance
for the smaller part of the ratio, not only the
seniors of 20 years or more but to all Stanford
women. It is an account of Miss Anastasia
Doyle's talk to Women's Conference on serv
ice reserves for women.
Like the Navy V programs for men, the
WAVES and SPARS are now enlisting senior
women in reserves with the idea that they will
finish college before beginning officers' train
ing. Unlike the men, these candidates will be
passed upon by a faculty committee as request
ed by the Navy.
Heretofore, WAVE and SPAR officers had
to have a college degree or business experience.
Now, the Navy will take women whose general
excellence in scholastic and extra curricular
activities and whose personal qualities in the
opinion of the faculty committees compensate
for a lack of business experience.
Although a committee at Stanford will not
be formed until the women indicate an interest
in the reserve program, Dean of Women Mary
Yost has assured naval representatives that it
will not approve candidates who do not meet
the standards of the Navy.

All of which means that Stanford women do
not face a call to active duty if their grades are
unsatisfactory like the men, but they do run the
risk of losing an opportunity to become an offi
cer candidate in the WAVES or SPARS by re
garding college records as minor details in their
future plans.

Reliability, dependability, leadership, per
sonal integrity, loyalty to the United States, and
high ideals of service are among the qualities
the Navy demands in its officers. The commit
tee wants to be able to recommend every Stan
ford woman who applies as having all of them.

As Miss Doyle pointed out yesterday, these
attributes do not grow in a vacuum but grow
from a woman's responsibilities and opportuni
ties at Stanford. The Navy had decided to make
the college campus the testing ground for future
officers in its women's reserve.

There is no reason why this philosophy in
becoming WAVE and SPAR officers, while there
is every reason to keep in mind constantly that
successful careers start in college. And in war
time, women must succeed in any career they
choose.—Peggy Boothe

ing. Unlike the men, these candidates will be
passed upon by a faculty committee as request
ed by the Navy.
Heretofore, WAVE and SPAR officers had
to have a college degree or business experience.
Now, the Navy will take women whose general
excellence in scholastic and extra curricular
activities and whose personal qualities in the
opinion of the faculty committees compensate
for a lack of business experience.
Although a committee at Stanford will not
be formed until the women indicate an interest
in the reserve program, Dean of Women Mary
Yost has assured naval representatives that it
will not approve candidates who do not meet
the standards of the Navy.

All of which means that Stanford women do
not face a call to active duty if their grades are
unsatisfactory like the men, but they do run the
risk of losing an opportunity to become an offi
cer candidate in the WAVES or SPARS by re
garding college records as minor details in their
future plans.

Reliability, dependability, leadership, per
sonal integrity, loyalty to the United States, and
high ideals of service are among the qualities
the Navy demands in its officers. The commit
tee wants to be able to recommend every Stan
ford woman who applies as having all of them.

As Miss Doyle pointed out yesterday, these
attributes do not grow in a vacuum but grow
from a woman's responsibilities and opportuni
ties at Stanford. The Navy had decided to make
the college campus the testing ground for future
officers in its women's reserve.

There is no reason why this philosophy in
becoming WAVE and SPAR officers, while there
is every reason to keep in mind constantly that
successful careers start in college. And in war
time, women must succeed in any career they
choose.—Peggy Boothe
IN today's Daily is a story of some significance
for the smaller part of the ratio, not only the
seniors of 20 years or more but to all Stanford
women. It is an account of Miss Anastasia
Doyle's talk to Women's Conference on serv
ice reserves for women.
Like the Navy V programs for men, the
WAVES and SPARS are now enlisting senior
women in reserves with the idea that they will
finish college before beginning officers' train
ing. Unlike the men, these candidates will be
passed upon by a faculty committee as request
ed by the Navy.
