THURSDAY we will vote for a student body
president. Wednesday the candidates will
be presented a a student body assembly at
12:55 in the afternoon. But today the candidates
must be nominated.

Slightly disgusted • with the election last
Friday in which only 10 per cent of the student
body voted, the new election board chairman
wants to make this election real.

The success or failure of any election in
which personalities are involved may ultimately
be attributed to nomination day. Unless potential
student body presidents are nominated, we can
not hope to have an adequate leader. Unless
each student takes it upon himself to see that a
man or woman is nominated whom he would
like to have hold the top student office, we can
not have a successful election.
Nomination blanks will be available on the
Quad today. To be valid, the blanks must be
signed by 15 registered students and returned
to the boxes on Quad before 5 p.m. According

to the amendment passed Friday, either a man
or woman with any number of units may run
for the office. —Jane Glasson
