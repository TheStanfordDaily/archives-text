### CYCLONE COVEY 
It had not been two weeks since Suzy
brought her little sister Tibby, our captivating
Mongolian idiot, to Stanford, when Neop Tole
mus came around an announced, "Today, Suzy,
I am going to show Tibby the campus."
So Suzy tied a yellow nair ribbon around
Tibby's jet-black locks, and sent the little idiot,
holding tight to Neop's hand, off to see the won
drous sights of Stanford.
In a little while they came to Lake Laguntina,
and Neop said to Tibby, "This is the most scenic
lake with hills in the back of any college campus
with hills in the back," and Tibby watched wide
eyed as a red canoe glided though a swath of
sunlight. Then she turned and saw the glamor
ous Legs and dark glasses loungng about, and
asked:
"What are those things-"
"Those things," Neop replied, "are Stanford
women."
"I guess," he answered after a pause, "they
are just to look at, too."
And so they walked on and pretty soon came
to Memorial Church. "This church, which
Farmer says is a cross between a Roman basilica
and a Byzantine central plan," said Neop, "must
be the most beautiful cross between a Roman
basilica and a Byzantine central plan in the
world."
"Yeap," Tibby agreed, and they walked on.
"Now that big building," said Neop pointing,
"has the greatest collection of war documents
in its tower than any other building has in its
tower. And that building across the street is
the best equipped amateur theater of most all
amateur theaters which are equipped." And
thus the tour of Stanford's superlatives pro
gressed.
At last, on their way back to Suzy's, Neop
said, "Now, little girl, I am going to take you
in here and buy you an ice cream cone."
Tibby clapped her hands, and they went
inside.
"This is the Union Cellar," Neop stated.
Tibby kept waiting for him to say more, and at
length, when they had been sitting at the coun
ter a long time, unnoticed, she asked:
"Well, what is this place the only of the
best of-"
Neop pondered for several moments, and
finally said, "Well, Tibby . . . this is the only
place in the world which makes coffee out of
ground quinine instead of ground coffee beans.
"Oh," said Tibby, and gazed around her en
tranced.
