The Editor, Sir:
I would like to know why a "Back to the
' Farm Dance" is not included in this year's plans
for the Convalescent Home Drive Week. All
year there has been a cry to have more enter
tainment on campus, and this yearly dance has
always been very popular. I understand that
over a hundred dollars profit was made last
year on it—that would keep several kiddies for
a week. How about this, Dick Wilbur Re
volted.

The Editor, Sir:
Friday night proved that Stanfordites ap
prove of informal dances. Dated and dateless
had a good time. There was an air of friend
liness and happiness. Dances of this sort (Ranch
Rumpus) give us all an opportunity to meet
and associate with all. Inexpensive dances of
this type have proved to be great successes
at many other colleges and now with all the ra
tioning, on campus activities are more in de
, mand. The dancing coul;' be modern and square
to fulfill the desires of aii.—(Name Withheld).
