"In this election, we are going to

Candidates will be introduced at

On Thursday, students will vote in
J a special election to select a student
! body president to serve until the

Her place will then be taken by a
i man or woman selected by the ex
| ecutive committee from the runners
j up for president or vice-president
or from the upper class representa
tives on the committee.
