Stressing the importance of maintaining a good record in college, Miss
Anastasia Doyle, women's vocational adviser, told members of Women's
Conference of the WAVE and WAAC reserves for college seniors at a
meeting of the living group presidents yesterday in the Women's Clubhouse.
Most of her talk was devoted to the Navy program for women, since they

draw almost all of their officer mate-'
rial from college women while the
Army does not. College seniors of
20 or over may enlist with the un
derstanding they will get their de
grees before being called to train as
WAVE and SPAR officers.
To endorse candidates for this
program, the Navy has asked that
a faculty committee be set up, Miss
Doyle said, which will rate them on
scholarship, extra-curricular activi
ties, and personal qualities.
"We are not recruiting for the
services, but we do want' to supply
information on positions in which
women can aid the war effort," de
clared Miss Doyle. ''Through all our
decisions should run the question,
'How can I best serve my country?'."
Chairman Catherine Connaghan
announced that Virginia Mount had
