Southbound trains tonight and to

of the Stanford Debate Squad to the
Los Angeles area where they will
participate in three major speech
tournaments to be held there this
week.

Dan Eymann and Joe Soares, is in
charge of the Stanford contingent

Frolik will participate in a round
table discussion on Post-War Prob
lems to be broadcast over the Mu
tual Network on Thursday.
Gordon Ewig is leaving tonight to
take part tomorrow in the oratorical
division. The theme of his oration,
"'Return to Self," is man's inability to
overcome the overwhelming material
forces that seek to engulf him as long
as he fails to look upward in appeal
to a higher force.
Eymann and Soares are partici
pating today in a discussion sequence

on the tournament's general subject,
"What Should Be the Nature of

America's Post-War Leadership?"
In three sections, the * contestants

answers, and appraise these solu
| dons.

the preliminaries of extemporaneous
! speaking. Charlie Allen, who will
leave for Los Angeles tomorrow
