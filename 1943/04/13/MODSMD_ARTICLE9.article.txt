# TUNISIAN THEATER
## Buck Speaks on War Front In Africa for YWCA Today 
### 
Philip W. Buck, professor of political science, will lead the discussion
on "Covering the War Fronts" today at 4:30 p.m. in the "Y" rooms, top
floor of the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Buck will talk on the Tunisian theaterâ€”where the Allies are and
what they are aiming to do. He will bring maps showing supply and trans-

port lines, areas which have food
and those that don't, and other re
gions of strategic importance.
These discussions are held to give
students an opportunity to catch up
on the war news and to integrate the
various theaters of war, according to
Dodie Crile, chairman of the group.
Importance
"The meetings are especially im
portant because they give students
the chance to hear about the war
from an expert and to ask questions
about details which they do not
know. We can find out where the
towns with the unpronounceable
names are," said Miss Crile.
These informal "talking it over"
periods to be held once a week will
deal with the possibilities of re
education in Germany, the world
wide economic aspect after the war,
the problem of feeding the con
quered countries, and the work be
ing done at the present by the vari
ous groups in this country.
Problems Outlined
"It is a chance for those interested
in reconstruction work to find out
what the problems are. We prob
ably won't find the answers but
we'll at least find out what we're up
against," said Miss Crile.
"The courses will be counted as an
hour a week on war hours as it is
important to find out what the Allies
are doing in the war," concluded
Miss Crile.
The discussion is open to all on
campus.
