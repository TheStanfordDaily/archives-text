# McClanahan, Eberle Run In Election
## 
### 
Ted Eberle, Excom member, and
Janet McClanahan, A.S.S.U. vice
president, will run for student body
president in the election tomorrow
as a result of nominations yester
day.
Because of the small number of
candidates and the difficulty of find
ing a suitable time for an election
assembly, none will be held, ac
cording to Irma Cunha, election
ooard chairman, but statements by
Eberle and Miss McClanahan are
civen below.
Eberle's statement follows:
"Student body government, one
of Stanford's finest traditions, is
threatened by the war. It was
abandoned in the last war. Now
we have tabled our constitution,
creating a flexible organization
which can deal quickly with any
emergency.
"Having long been interested in
student body government and
having participated in it, I feel
that, if elected, I would be quali
fied to help carry on Stanford's
tradition of democracy for the
two quarters I will be at Stanford,
particularly as I have taken part
in creating a basis to deal with
the present situation.
"I hope that everyone will cast
his impartial ballot, for it is only
by student interest that student
government will survive."
Here is Miss McClanahan's state
ment:
"I can truthfully say that until
last night I had no intention of
running for this office, but in the
best interests of the smooth run
ning of student government, 1
shall serve in any capacity the
students desire.
"In all fairness, I can say that
both of your candidates, beuig
members of Excom, are acquaint
ed with the wartime problems af
fecting student government."
Tomorrow, Stanford students will
selcct a president to serve until the
end of Autumn Quarter in the first
election in which both men and
women are eligible to run for that
office. This change for the duration
was made possible by the passage of
o constitutional amendment last
week.
Excom will not meet until tomor
row night, when it will approve the
election results.
Rules governing the election pro
cedure tomorrow as announced by
Miss Cunha will be found on page 6
of today's Daily.
