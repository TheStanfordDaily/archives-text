# Scholarship Made In Collins' Name
## 
### 
In recognition of the leadership of
Bob Collins, former Stanford stu-
who last year organized and
developed the Stanford War Board,
Frank F. Walker, University finan
cial vice-president, has made the
initial contribution to establish the
"Robert Earl Collins Dimes for Di
plomas Scholarship."
Called to service before his grad
uation with the class of 1943, Col
lins is now stationed with the Uni
ted States Army at Baton Rouge,
Louisiana.
"Bob Collins contributed in many
ways to Stanford, his last activity
before his induction into the serv
ice having been the Stanford War
Board," Mr. Walker wrote in pre
senting the gift to Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur.
"Collins was probably more re
sponsible than any other individual
for the initial strides which this
Board accomplished," lie continued.
Collins was appointed Co-ordina
tor of Stanford War Activities after
he presented his ideas on how stu
dents could aid the war program to
Excom shortly after Pearl Harbor.
This was the night after the one
when, during his study of Shake
speare, he started to think of all of
the things which the Stanford stu
dents could be doing to aid the war
effort and were not doing. He made
a list of these things on the inside
cover of his textbook, and it was this
list which, when he presented it to
Excom, gained him the job of being
Stanford War Board Co-ordinator.
Among the projects begun by the
War Board was Dimes for Diplomas,
a weekly collection from students
to give scholarships for returning
Stanford students who were called
into the Army with one quarter
left until they would graduate.
