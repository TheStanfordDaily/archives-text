# TUES, SERIES
## Cavalcade Film Draws Crowd 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
Charles Perry Weimer took the
J audience which completely filled the
1 auditorium of Memorial Hall on a
; cavalcade of South America, from
i the towering peaks of Colombia to
; the Gaucho inhabited Argentine, last
' night when he presented his allâ€”
i color, documentary film on the Tues
i day Series program.
Mr. Weimer with his wife made
this 100.000-mile, 19-month photo
graphic survey over the entire con
| tinent of South America in 1940-41.
In Venezuela, they pictured the oil
lakes of the Standard Oil and Vene
zuela Oil companies.
"Derricks arc constructed in the
lakes, and make an eerie ghost-like
sight," said Mr. Weimer.
Coffee Capital
"The trip down the Magdalena
River to the coffee capital of Colom
bia is one no one should miss," the
lecturer said. Scenes of waxy green
bushes covered with red coffee ber
ries growing on the slopes of the
hills behind this picturesque town
convinced the packed house.
From the cosmopolitan cities of
Colombia, the Weimers went down
the Pan-American highway into
Equador. Here they photographed
the first Spanish house built in that
country; and in its capital, pictured
the modern homes which rent for
$25, according to Mr. Weimer.
While in Ecuador, he made a study
j of the life of the Indian descendants
:of the ancient Incas. Brilliant pic
' tures of a market day caught the easy
. customs of these people as well as
i the striking colors in their costumes.
Bullfight
A Peruvian bullfight, in which
: seven bulls and a few horses were
| killed, added excitement to the pic
: tures of Lima. The film also pic-
I tured the narrow streets covered by
| arcades, ancient churches, and the
I famous bascillaca in which the bones
j of Pizarro are preserved.
From Peru, they travelled through
| Chile, picturing the copper mines
in northern Chile, the Straits of Ma
gellan. and the Andean pass at Por
tillo. From here they went into the
Argentine and Uruguay, and then
into Brazil.
