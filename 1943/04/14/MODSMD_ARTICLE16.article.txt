ALLIED H.Q., North Africa. April
13 (U.Riâ€”The British First Army,
thrusting 20 miles above Kairouan,
swung into a seige line with the
Eighth Army driving up the coast
today, pinning the Axis tight in its
telescoping Tunisian corner, whik
Allied fires blasted the last enemy
air fields.
The First Army left wing, on the
north coast facing Bizerte, and
French forces in a supporting push
in the center, also scoi'ed new gains
to tighten further the ring around
the crowded Axis Armies, an Allied
communique reported.
Reports disclosed the French had
captured the Djebel Karachoum hil!
on the north end of the Tunisian
battle zone, an important Axis
strong point which had impeded
Anglo-American operations in the
Kairouan sector.
American troops who had held
the British flank in the southern
and central Tunisian campaign, now
passed by in the swirl of battle
moving towards the Tunis-Bizert?
arc, settled down temporarily to the
task of mopping up conquered terri
tory.
The first test of strength with Field
Farshal Erwin Rommel and Gen,
Juergen von Arnim in their new
poistion will be made primarily by
the British, the front lineup indi~
cated. But the final battle to cast
the enemy into the sea promised to
be grueling struggle which would
find the American and French in a*;
the kill.
