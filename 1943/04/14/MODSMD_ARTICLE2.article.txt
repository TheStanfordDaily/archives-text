# Farm Crew Preps for UCLA Race
## 
### 
"Two crews are going South, and I [
am confident they will win their
races against U.C.L.A. This is the
best crew Stanford has had since
the revival of the sport four years
ago, and it should go places," said
Coach Carl Pedersen when ques
tioned about his crews' chances
against U.C.L.A. this Saturday at
Bologna Creek.
Coach Pedersen, 18 oarsmen, and
two coxswains will leave tomorrow
night 011 the 7:15 Coaster to row
their first race of the season—a mile
and a quarter pull against the much
talked of Uclans. The Stanford and
U.C.L.A. Varsity crews will race at
10 a.m., and Stanford's junior varsity
will meet U.C.L.A.'s lrosh crew at
10:30.
Bill Davidson and Bob Phillips are
going down as alternates, and Mrs.
Pedersen will go down with cox
Ann Ashley.
Friday Workout
Last Friday the varsity worked nut
before breakfast, and did a mile
and a quarter in G minutes, 45 sec
onds. During their four-hour prac
tice period on Sunday, all three of
Pedersen's crews raced in a three
mile pull, and according to the cox
swains, "all did well."
Lineups sometimes are tentative
practically until a race begins, and :
the Stanford shells are no excep- |
tion. But the varsity and junior
varsity shells now stand like this:

8 Pounds Heavier
The averages taken on both var- i
sities show that Stanford men arc |
an inch tallgr and eight pounds !
heavier. Just whether or not the '
added muscle will be converted into j
an advantage or a disadvantage re- I
mains to be seen.
Stanford raced Cal off season dur- I
ing Autumn Quarter and skimmed
over the finish mark four and a half
feet behind the Bruins. That crew j
had been in a shell for 21 days. The
present crew has been in a shell for j
three or four months, except for j
ing driftwood which marred the |
course, and the fact that Cox Walt |
Drake had to learn to steer a straight j
course at Redwood is "damned I
crooked."
Prospects Good
But these are minor details com
pared to the basic fact that the j
Stanford crew which three years ago

began with an oarlock and a prayer,
as the hobby of some shell enthu
siasts, became strong enough to
come within an ace of trimming
Cal. And with two more quarters
of training under their belts, they
stand a very good chance in all of
their races this spring.
In the Cal race this autumn, the
crews got off to an even start but
then Cul pulled ahead with a faster
stroke to lead about a quarter of the
way. Then the Stanfords pulled even
and Cal had to row at "5 strokes a
minute to match a powerhouse Stan
ford 29. At the finish Stanford was
more than matching the Cal 35 with
a SI count.
Stroking Tangled
'"We had the crew all right," said
Coach Carl Pedersen, in commenting
on the race, "but they got sari of
tangled up on their stroking and Cal
got in one extra stroke before the
finish. If we had gotten in our
final stroke, it would have been a
different story."
Added difficulties were the float-
Schute and Hampton, who have been
at it for about six months, and Clary
and Cox Drake, who have worked in
shells for three or four years.
The crew will go through a light
workout Friday when they arrive
down South, because, although they
are taking along their own oars,
they've got to get used to the U.C.
L.A. shells and brush up on their
racing starts.
Redwood House
There's a lot of history behind
Coach Pedersen's crew. When Ped
ersen became coach four years ago,
crew had been a dead sport on the
Farm for 20 years. So Lee Peake,
Tod Cole, and Carl Gurloek built a
barge and a house at Redwood City.
But it was too windy and too far to
Redwood, and Bud Clary, Bill Cham
berlain, and Gerry Grunewald got
busy two weeks before Summer
Quarter ended and began to move
things to the Paly Yacht Harbor,
where the oarsmen got to work on a
boathouse, dock, ramp, and repair
work. With the help and supervision
of Pedersen, and the $7.50 paid each
quarter by each man, the Stanford
outfit took shape by Christmas.
Besides getting some financial help
from alumni, Stanford crewmen
were given four shells. The varsity
shell, "Washingtonia," was given to
Stanford at the end of last Spring
Quarter along with Cal's donations,
"Berkoleyan" and "Argonaut."
U.S.F. came through with "Wislcy"
last fall.
Minor Sport
Since then, Crew has gone along
at a fast pace as a Stanford sport.
The A.S.S.U. granted it a rating as
a minor sport, and so crewmen are

entitled to the Circle S, along with a
J physical education department gym
credit, with the exception of Cox Ann
Ashley, who gets no gym credit.
Sunday was a special day for
| crewmen, because it was the first
time in about 24 years that three
| shells hit the water at the same time.
I The frosh have officially been grad
uated from the barge, and have been
1 going out every day to prep for a
pull with Cal frosh sometime in the
near future. The frosh have been in
the "Argonaut" for four days and
their lineup at present stands like
this:
Stan Cumberpatch, 1; Hoyt Leis
ure, 2; George Pratt, 3; Ronnie Bish
op. 4; Bill Davidson, 5; Norman
Schieber, 6; Charles Haines, 7; Bob
Phillips, stroke; and Oliver Andrews,
I cox.
COACH PEDERSEN
ROWS 28 RACES
About 5,000 miles of rowing, a
distance larther than a round trip to
the Hawaiian Islands, and 28 races—
that s part of the crew history of
Carl Pedersen, Stanford's coach
! since 1939, when crew was re vied
at the Farm. Pedersen's rowing rec
: ord is more convincing than any ad
jectives of praise any sports fan
| could use.
In 1927, Pedersen and a gang of
his pals started rowing at Sacra
mento. Pedersen got sick in the fall
ol 1931, and so he coached the crew
( that year. The next year, when he
got back into the shell as an oars
man at Cal, the Bears beat Wash
-1 ington by 18 boat lengths. The Cal
crewmen broke a Pacific Coast rec
ord that day at Lake Washington,
and Pedersen was No. 5 in the shell.
And that record hasn t been equalled
| since.
Independent
When Pedersen came to Stanford
in 1939, crew was a thing of the past.
No one heard or cared about the
i sport. But the coach rounded to
| gether a few hard working men, and
j began f to lay the groundwork for
what Pedersen now calls the "best
crew Stanford's had since 1939."
The oarsmen had to depend almost
entirely on themselves for aid—fi
, naneial and otherwise—and, until
recently, when crewman Ken Young
gave his motorboat to the crews'
use. Coach Pedersen had either to
i row in the shell or cox it in order
I to coach.
Pedersen has been working his
men out every day for two hours a
day for quite a while. He feels that
I when the varsity and junior varsity
men board the 7:15 Coaster to
morrow night, they'll be taking the
first step toward showing the Uclans
that the Stanford crew has come a
lon,, way since 1939.
