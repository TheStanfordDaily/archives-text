# DEBATE
## Church Loses Contest Finals 
### 
The manuscript submitted by ;
Frank Church, Stanford debater ;
now in the Army, in the finals of I
the national American Economic j
radio contest, was not among the j
two chosen to be used in the broad- j
cast over the Wake Up America J
program, according to a telegram j
received from New York.
Church's manuscript on competi
tive enterprise was among the 36
chosen from the 265 submitted from
universities all over the nation. He
was thus qualified to participate in
a regional debate broadcast from
San Francisco on March 7.
Defeating his opponents from
Montana, Oregon, and Cal, Church
won the San Francisco contest, and
his manuscript was submitted along
with those of the eight other re
gional winners to New York where
judges chose two out of nine for
participation on the Wake Up Amer
ica Forum to be broadcast coast-to
coast next Sunday.
Judges of the final round were j
Norman Thomas; Guy Suavely, of
the Association of American Col- j
legse, and Harry Summers, of the |
Blue Pacific Service.
Church upheld the negative of the
question which was the subject of
the debates sponsored by the Amer
ican Economic Foundation, "Should
American Youth Support the Re
establishment after the War of Com
petitive Enterprise as Our Dominant
Economic System?"
