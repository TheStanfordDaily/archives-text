# French Film Called Timely
## 
### 
"'REUNION IN FRANCE" now play
ing at Stanford Theater
"Reunion in France" was chosen j
for Joan Crawford's comeback,
and it wasn't a particularly happy
choice. The story though timely is
rather weak. It seems to me this
is the third or fourth comeback of
Miss Crawford in as many years.
The picture concerns an upper
bracket French girl, played by Joan
Crawford, who leaves her fiance
when he starts collaborating with
the Nazis. Instead she spends her
time trying to help an American
Hier get out of France. Their es
cape takes up the whole last half j
of the picture. The American flier,
| played by John Wayne, is a rather
colorless part. Wayne looks as
though he could have played it as !
well with his eyes closed and one
hand tied behind him. Philip Dorn,
; as Miss Crawford's fiance, gives a
restrained but good performance.
Joan Crawford is si ill Joan Craw
ford. Nothing more need be said,
j "Reunion in France" is worth while
for the Crawford fans and mildly
entertaining for the rest of us.
"Ihe Great Gildersleeve" with
Harold Peary is the second feature.
