PRESSURE WAS ON
The story of Emmett Cashin's
world record *- breaking perform- j
ances last Saturday is old stuff by
now, but some of the behind-the- i
scenes dope isn't, and is worth pass
ing on.
After Cashin's remarkable 2:21 for
the 200-yard breaststroke in prac
tice a week and a half ago, swim
Coach Ernie Brandsten figured Em
mett was about ready for a world
record try, and went ahead and
made arrangements to have all the
necessary judges, timers, applica
tion blanks, etc., ready when the
time came.
Last Tuesday, Brandsten told us
the big day would be Saturday, but
asked that the attempt not be played
up in our stories so that the pres
sure on Cashin would be as little
as possible. '
Brandsten told the San Francisco
Chronicle the same thing, but the
Chronicle just couldn't overlook
such news so it published last Fri
day the whole yarn topped off by
this headline: "Cashin on the Spot/'
It wasn't any 12-point caption ei
ther, and it really did put "Cashin
on the spot." Brandsten was a little
worried about such pressure, but j
apparently it didn't even phase Em
mett.
CAL TRACK DOPE
Track spotlight this week-end J
shifts over to Berkeley, where on i
Friday afternoon the Bears hold
their weekly time trials open to
service men. It's merely a practice
meet, but it may answer the big
track question of the year: what
are Grover Klemmer, Hal Davis,
and Jim Jurkovich going to be
worth to the Bears this season?
Of the three, Klemmer is the only
one about whom anybody knows
anything. The Rover ran a practice
G6O in 1:20 a week or so back, which I
means he's just about as good as !
ever. Even the San Francisco j
sportswriting clique hasn't been able ;
to dig up anything on the other |
two, or if it has the dope was hushed j
up by Bear Coach A1 Ragan.
Should all three get into top
shape, Cal will have about the best ;
track team in the country. Should j
they f:iil to come around, that Big
Meet might be a Aossup after all.
