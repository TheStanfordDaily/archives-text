# Card Nine Tries for Win Against Broncos Tomorrow
## 
### 
Stanford's baseball nine receives
their third chance to break into the
win column tomorrow afternoon on
the Santa Clara diamond. The game
will feature the powerful hitting of
the Broncos and the much improved
pitching of Coach Wolter's staff.
If the Cards should win this one.
which is not an impossibility, the
Santa Clarans would lose all mathe
matical chance for the northern di
vision crown. Thus the game prom
ises to be hotly contested for the
Reds are victory-starved and spilling
Bronc blood would put a new
feather in the Indian's war bonnet.
Walter plans on making one
change in the lineup that faced St.
Mary's last Saturday. Hugh Ellio!
will replace Jerry Roinstead at the
keystone sack. Hugh was pro
nounced eligible last weekend and
his appearance in the lineup will aid
both in the field and at the plate.
Bernard Woody of Jack Miller will
get the pitching assignment, with
Woody the more probable choice.
Santa Clara will depend upon
"Mitch" Lobrovitch for their attack,
aided and abetted by Bill Mullins,
Duane Crawford, and Bill Mustan
ich. The hurling assignment will

fall to either Buzz Meager or Dick
1 Smith.
The feature attraction of the game
I will be the appearance of Jess Fvie
tas in the outfield. Frietas is the all -
| around man of Mission sports and
has proved himself capable as a
hitter and a fielder.
Coach Harry Walter announced
yesterday that the absent Ray Ham
mett had been elected captain for
| the season with catcher Ward Walk
j up named temporary acting captain.

Santa Clara:
Scarpelli, cf; Braganti, ss; Pren
tice, If; Lobrovich, 3b: Mustanich.
I c; Frietas, rf; Crawford, lb; Meagh
j er or Smith, p.
