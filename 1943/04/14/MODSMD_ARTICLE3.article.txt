# Lt. Gen. Freyberg Visited Stanford

Lt. Gen. Sir Bernard Freyberg,
V.C., K.8.E., C.M.G., C.8., D.5.0.,
commanding the New Zealand forces
in North Africa, seems remote from
Stanford's ivory tower The connec
tion is Harry Maloney, the Farm's
veteran director of minor sports, who
has the following story to tell.
"Tiny" Freyberg landed in San
Francisco in July, 1914, from New
Zealand. He had come to the States
to study dentistry at the University
of California.
Visits Farm
While F re y be r g was waiting
around for U.C.'s fall semester to
open two friends of his, Danny Car
roll and Jim Wylie, invited him to
visit Stanford. Carroll had come
from Australia with the "War
rathcs" rugby team, and Wylie from
New Zealand with the "All-Blacks"
fifteen. Both had stayed in America
and entered Stanford. So Freyberg
came down to the Farm, spending a
couple of weeks at the S.A.E. house.
It is reported that Freyberg en
joyed Stanford so much, that he was
ready to throw over Cal and den
tistry and sign with the Indians.
However, one day in August, 1914,
Freyberg came running up to his
hotel room to show Wylie the head
lines that said that England was at
war.
Enlisted in Anzacs
Freyberg only had enough money
to get to New York, and he worked
his way to England as a seaman.
After waiting in England for fhe
arrival of the New Zealand forces
with which he hoped to enlist, he
joined the British forces with a
group of New Zealanders and Aus
tralians. Eventually they reached
Gallipoli, with the famous Anzacs.
Harry Maloney notes here that
Freyberg was never an officer in
Pancho Villa's army (was never in
Mexico, in fact), never swam the
Golden Gate, although he twice tried
to swim the English Channel, and
was never a professional boxer with
promoter Tex Fickard; all of which
have been reported. While on the
Coast in 1914, he did swim for the
Olympic Club, and play rugby with
the San Francisco "Barbarians."
Towed Flares
At Gallipoli, Lieutenant Freyberg
swam into the Dardanelles one night
towing a boat-load of flares. He was
to set these along the beach to simu
late landing operations and confuse
the Turks. He succeeded so well
that the Turkish batteries opened up
a barrage that sank the boat, and
forced Freyberg to swim, dodging
shells, for hours until picked up.
This won him the D.S.O.
After the retreat from Gallipoli,
Freyberg served in France, being
promoted to major. A desperate at
tack which he led in person, captur
ing a town and 500 German prisoners
won him the highest of British battle
decorations, the Victoria Cross.
Commanded Crete
He stayed in England after the
war, commanded the Grenadier
Guards, and served on the British
general staff. He was called for active
service in 1939. and the New Zea
land Government offered him the
command of its expeditionary forces.
Freyberg met the Germans again
when he commanded the valiant de
fense of Crete. Then he led the New
Zealand divisions in North Africa,
and, in the great German advance
to El Alamein, twice threw back
Rommel's forces in vicious rear
guard actions.
Begins Advance
When Gen. Bernard L. Montgom
ery and his Eighth Army finally be
gan their historic advance from
Cairo to the gates of Kairouan, Gen.
Freyberg and his New Zealand

troops began the advance, followim
the artillery barrages through to th»
Germans.
Maintaining their position in th«
vanguard, they swept on to the pas:
at El Ageheila, where Rommel fough
a delaying action. After sweepim
the Germans out of the pass, the\
continued on to Gabes. Here Rom
mel again halted to fight a rear
gurad action. Montgomery likewise
halted and waited for his reinforce
ments and supply lines to catch uj
with the attacking troops. Agaii
Gen. Freyberg's troops led the ad
vance, not stopping this time unti
reaching the Mareth line.
Leads in Africa
Freyberg's nickname is "Tiny" a.
is appropriate for a man over si?
feet and 180 pounds. He has beei
wounded 14 times, most recently it
Libya, by German shrapnel. He wa,
knighted in 1941, and has led hi:
New Zealanders with Montgomery
from "the gates of Cairo" to the gate
of Tunis. He is no arm-chair gen
eral, moving, like General Patton
with and leading his men.
Since his troops, the New Zea
landers, are regarded by Genera
Montgomery as being his shod
troops, General Freyberg made tin
wide sweep around the Mareth lin
which turned Rommel's flank at tha
point and forced him to resume hi
retreat northwards in Tunisia. Afte
sweeping around the
General Freyberg rejoined the bull
of General Montgomery's Eight!
Army to continue the pursuit.
Harry Maloney finds a moral ii
the story. Freyberg's ability as .
swimmer saved his life at Gallipol
His years of rugby, New Zealand'
national game, gave him the tough
ness that has survived two wars am
14 wounds. 'The athlete's clean!'
ness in mind and body," says Hair
Maloney, "helped win him his nich
in the Hall of Fame."
