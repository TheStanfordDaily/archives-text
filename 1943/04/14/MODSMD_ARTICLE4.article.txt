# YWCA Develops Leadership
## 
### 
Fifty years ago the Y.W.C.A. was
organized with 110 active members,
designated by the first constitution
as "the lady students and teachers
of the institution." A member of a
national and world organization, the
Y became interested in social prob
lems and of the deepening of the re
ligious life of its members and others,
but perhaps its greatest continu
ously effective force has been the
development of leadership among
women students.
This year the Y is proud of a mem
bership of 426, most of whom are
actively working on committees, ac
tivities, and programs, under the
guidance of Miss Davidson, Y secre
tary, known to all as "Miss Pat."
They are interested in supporting
the Y financially and making its
functions available for all girls.
Oldest Organization
The Y has been one of the oldest
and most continuously effective or
ganizations at Stanford with the
generous support of the Adminis
tration. A large part of its continu
ity and stability is derived from its
Advisory Board of outstanding fac
ulty wives and Palo Alto women
who, individually, are leaders in all
phases of community life.
Organization of the first Advisory
Board was effected in 1905, with Mrs.
Rufus L. Green as president.
Faculty and Palo Alto women who
have served as president of the Ad
visory Board are Mrs. R. L. Green,
1905-1915; Madame J. W. Mitchell,

Develops Leadership
The Y is proud of its program of
leveloping leadership. Back over
ts 50 years the inspiration to many
;tudents for profession carreers and
•ommunity and campus service came
ifter preliminary training in the Y
it Stanford. The organization has
idjusted its program from year to
.ear, to insure vitality throughout
he years of its existence.
Current problems have given rise
o plans of cooperation with the new
kVar Boards, by helping direct the
'Co-ed Crop Crews" last fall; by or
ganizing world affairs discussions led
)v outstanding professors in a series
•ailed "We Cover the War Fronts";
w providing discussions on marriage
md the home, "War Marriages—
tVise or Otherwise."
To Jap Students
Probably one of the most quiet, but
lone the less effective pieces of work
his year has been the day by day,
veek by week, work done by a few
{ members who have sent the
dailies, letters, cards. Chappies,
ootball news, to Stanford Japanese
tudents who have been evacuated
nd are now either in the Army, or
n other universities, or relocation
enters. A Stanford pennant has
>een sent to Manzanar, books and

] furniture are being collected for the |
j student lounge at Manzanar to prove .
' that the Stanford Japanese students
I have not been forgotten on the Farm.
The Social Service group of the Y |
boasts practical experience this year.
Five Stanford women have been vol-
I unteering as aides to the social case
worker at the Red Cross; five others
are Girl Scout leaders in Palo Alto i
and at the campus school; the day |
nursery enrollment has increased to I
help the problems of working moth
ers and "no help" so 14 Y girls vol- |
untecred to help every week at a I
day nursery in Palo Alto.
USO Courses
The Y cooperated again with the
War Board and sponsored a series !
of discussions for Junior USO host
esses for which 45 Stanford women !
were enrolled. This quarter the Y |
plans to repeat the USO course and |
i to give, in addition, a course in Crop |
| Crew work in preparation for such |
work during the Summer Quarter.
The race relations group is also con
tinuing its work.
The esthetic standards of the Y j
are very high. The attractive rooms j
on the top floor of the Women's j
j Clubhouse are made available
| through the oßardof the Stanford j
Women's Club. They are open every j
! week day to all women who care to
j use them.
The rooms are kept filled with 1
[ flowers from the gardens of campus
j friends and the furnishings 'are of j
modern rattan. A small kitchen 1
down the hall is available for spe
| cial events though it will not be
' used much for the duration.
Present Cabinet
Janet McClanahan heads the 1942-
: 43 student cabinet with Betty May
Hale serving as vice-president, Bar- i
| bara Gregg, treasurer; Peggy Shaw. '
secretary. Under their guidance Y i
j members head and participate in
; the following committees: Race Re
-1 lations, Freshman Club; Worship, In
terfaith Council; Consumer Educa
; tion; Transfer Group; Office Com- i
mittee, Social Activities; Home and
| Marriage; Chapel Cabinet repre
! sentative and Daily Reporter; Asilo
mar Conference member; Member- \
\ ship committee; Social Service; Stu
| dent Faculty Forum, and Nominating !
Committee.
Due, however, to the election of I
Janet McClanahan to the office of
ASSU vice-president, and the ap
pointment of Betty May Hale as
Stanford War Board Coordinator, the
Y is having to hold new elections,
' for its officers. The Committee
j Chairmen however will remain in
their positions.
The Y is also now investigating
the possibility of setting up a har
vest camp, the counselors of which
would be Stanford women, during
the Summer Quarter. Conversations
on this subject are now being held
with Cal since Cal has already
I planned sffch camp.
