# 'Mrs. Stanford's Word Is Law'
## 
### 
As we were standing on the corner
last Sunday, in hopes of flagging
down a car for a ride into Paly, an
elderly gentleman very graciously
offered to save us a No. 17 war ration
coupon by giving us a lift.
As we settled ourselves in the
front seat, we continued our previous
conversation and by fate it dealt
with the Stanford Daily.
At the mention of the word
"Daily," our benefactor beamed and
graced us with the remark that he
had once been an associate editor.
Compares Dailies
This statement aroused our curios
ity, both as to how old issues of the
Daily were put to press and as to
the comparison between the staff
then and now. Plying our driver
with questions we soon were able to
worm many interesting yarns out of
him.
It seems that in those days the
word of Mrs. Stanford was law and
it is due to some of her slightest
whims that Stanford is as it is to
day.
Sight-Seeing Flagpole
Forty or some odd years ago
Stanford also had a flagpole. Not
the pint-sized one now residing atop
the firehouse, but a really magnifi
cent affair adorned at the top by a
tremendous gilded ball. This gandy
symbol of patriotism was originally
placed in the exact center of the
grass plot that divides Palm Drive
just in front of the Quad.
The pole remained in this position
but a short time however, for it was
decided that it would look much
more impressive in the Inner Quad.
No sooner had it been tugged and
hauled to its new home, than Mrs.
Stanford protested violently. "The
Inner Quad is no place for a flag
pole, especially the center of the
Inner Quad."
Moves to Scrap Heap
Once again the hearty Corpora
tion Yard exerted itself and the

beautiful pole, which was becoming
a headache by this time, was moved.
No place would seem to be adequate
and eventually after a slow, wander
ing tour around the campus the
proud beauty came to rest—in the
i scrap heap.
A sight-seeing flagpole had never
been heard of before and it was not
long before the junior class made
j good use of the unusual situation.
I The playwright for that year's edi
i tion of the Farce was very badly
| in need of humorous material. Piclc
j ing upon the plight of the famous
pole he filled in the lulls in his
script. When no laughs were ex
pected from the audience, one of the
men on the stage would point to a
toy flagpole set on a box in the cor
ner of the stage and cry, "Move the
flagpole over there," with suitable
gestures to accompany his dramatic
remark. Whereupon the box, et al,
was escorted across the stage and
placed in a prominent position until
called upon to perform again.
Moves Corner of Quad
Mrs. Stanford also had her many
j little jokes and the usual goat of
these was Ye Olde Daily Palo Alto,
later renamed the Stanford Daily.
One of her most amusing incidents
was executed at the expense of a cub
reporter.
This reporter was told to call upon
Mrs. Stanford and attempt to get a
story to publish. Apparently awed
i by the presence of this great lady,
the reporter rushed into the old
shack screaming at the top of his
lungs, "Hold the presses, I've got a
scoop!"
When the editor inquired a little
further into the actual facts of the
case he discovered that Mrs. Stan
ford had told the young lad that she
intended moving the western corner
| of the Quad three-quarters of an
! inch to the east. Needless to say the
j reporter was shifted to another beat
j immediately and he remained there.
I To this day he is still known to his
friends as "Scoop."'

Mrs. Stanford also had her many
j little jokes and the usual goat of
these was Ye Olde Daily Palo Alto,
later renamed the Stanford Daily.
One of her most amusing incidents
was executed at the expense of a cub
reporter.
This reporter was told to call upon
Mrs. Stanford and attempt to get a
story to publish. Apparently awed
i by the presence of this great lady,
the reporter rushed into the old
shack screaming at the top of his
lungs, "Hold the presses, I've got a
scoop!"
When the editor inquired a little
further into the actual facts of the
case he discovered that Mrs. Stan
ford had told the young lad that she
intended moving the western corner
| of the Quad three-quarters of an
! inch to the east. Needless to say the

As we were standing on the corner
last Sunday, in hopes of flagging
down a car for a ride into Paly, an
elderly gentleman very graciously
offered to save us a No. 17 war ration
coupon by giving us a lift.
As we settled ourselves in the
front seat, we continued our previous
conversation and by fate it dealt
with the Stanford Daily.
At the mention of the word
"Daily," our benefactor beamed and
graced us with the remark that he
had once been an associate editor.
Compares Dailies
This statement aroused our curios
ity, both as to how old issues of the
Daily were put to press and as to
the comparison between the staff
then and now. Plying our driver
with questions we soon were able to
worm many interesting yarns out of
him.
It seems that in those days the
word of Mrs. Stanford was law and
it is due to some of her slightest
whims that Stanford is as it is to
day.
Sight-Seeing Flagpole
Forty or some odd years ago
Stanford also had a flagpole. Not
the pint-sized one now residing atop
the firehouse, but a really magnifi
cent affair adorned at the top by a
tremendous gilded ball. This gandy
symbol of patriotism was originally
placed in the exact center of the
grass plot that divides Palm Drive
just in front of the Quad.
The pole remained in this position
but a short time however, for it was
decided that it would look much
more impressive in the Inner Quad.
No sooner had it been tugged and
hauled to its new home, than Mrs.
Stanford protested violently. "The
Inner Quad is no place for a flag
pole, especially the center of the
Inner Quad."
Moves to Scrap Heap
Once again the hearty Corpora
tion Yard exerted itself and the

beautiful pole, which was becoming
a headache by this time, was moved.
No place would seem to be adequate
and eventually after a slow, wander
ing tour around the campus the
proud beauty came to rest—in the
i scrap heap.
