# Hens Use Specs' to Stop Sight
## 
### 
The newest thing in science is the
development in chickens of those
much coveted 20-20 eyes. Or so was
the impression when someone al
the Daily shack exclaimed that Mr.
Donald Winnebigler, Stanford's As
sistant Registrar and professional
chicken raiser, was putting spectacles
on his hens.
"Yes, they are called spectacles,"
claimed Mr. Winnebigler, "but their
purpose is not to improve the vision.
Rather, they are meant to impair it."
Aluminum Discs
Young Mr. Winnebigler went on
to explain that the spectacles con
sisted of small aluminum discs
which were placed before the chick
en's eyes and held there by a small
cotterpin inserted through the beak.
"During molting season," contin
ued the chicken fan, "hens tend to
become restless and irritable. At
this time, they often resort to a
cannibalism,' and attack, and often
kill their fellow chickens."
"In addition to preventing the
chickens from killing each other, the
chickens' spectacles also enable the
raiser to keep them in closer prox
imity, which saves both space and
labor for the raiser," he added.
Can't See Too Much
Mr. Winnebigler explained that the
aluminum "specs" tended to stop
such uncivilized actions, for it kept
the hens from seeing too much of
each other. This possibly might act
as a distinct advantage to the roost
ers so highly publicized in Esquire
magazine.
Mr. Winnebigler, who champions
an attractive home in Mountain
View, plus a most charming wife and
a cute little blond baby, also finds
time among his many duties to raise
and care for 1,000 leghorn chickens.
From these white poultry prizes, he
gains 700 eggs each day . . . the
retail price being 50 cents a dozen.
No More Aluminum
The 1.000 leghorns should con
j sider themselves lucky in that, due
Ito war-time shortages, no more
I aluminum can be obtained for the
l duration.
"These are pre-Pearl Harbor
; chicks," asserted Mr. Winnebigler.
"I'm not quite sure what I'm going
to do when my present supply of
spectacles wears out," he added, "but
either I'm going to have to have
fewer chickens or else I'm going to
have to have more pens. Of course,
I could try to salvage the spectacles
from the chickens that are sold, but
I doubt very much that they would
prove to be amenable to salvage."
In addition to raising 1,000 chick
ens and caring for the same, Mr.
Winnebigler is an Assistant Regis
trar. Furthermore, he is also an As
sociate Professor of Speech and
Drama, and an Associate Professor
|of Education. He leads a busy life.
