# Obstacle Course is 'Devil's Machine'
## 
### 
Some call it a machine of the
Devil, but whether it has anything
to do with the guy with the fork or
not, Stanford's obstacle course is
certainly a machine, about as scien
tific and expertly planned as any \
body-building contraption ever in- I
vented.
The 16-event, 440-yard course lo
cated north of Angell Field and west
of the Stadium is a product of the
intensive study of similar courses
made by Dr. 0. N. Anderson, A1
Masters, and Everett Dean, with cer
tain original events thrown in to
develop the Stanford Rough's weak
est muscles—those in the arms and
shoulders.
Original Events
The three men studied especially
courses located at Redwood City
High School and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, and looked at motion pictures
of various other courses throughout |
the country.
Having selected the best events I
from these observations, they then !
thought up such body builders as !
the Pole Climb (shinny up pole, j
then work hand over hand down |
pipe), and the Low Crawl (crawl on
stomach under barriers 18 inches
above ground). Money for the course
came from the proceeds of the Stan
ford-St. Mary's Pre-Flight football
game last fall.
V-Log Ladder
The course itself combines condi- ,
tions found in land warfare with ;
events which will help build up
anns, shoulders, legs, timing, and co
ordination.
Torture begins with the Inverted
V-Log Ladder, so-called because it
involves a wooden inverted V with
logs for steps. Rule is that one
must go over without touching his
hands.
Once over the V, things get tough
er with the Rope Wall Climb. The
wall is 14 feet high; one has to climb
up the suspended rope, using his feet
at the same time against the wall;
then drop over onto the ledge, and
jump to the ground. The event de
velops both the arm and shoulder
inuscles, as well as agility.
four-Foot Wall
Event No. 3 is a four-foot wall,
over which one must vault without
touching, which merely warms you
up for the first real ordeal of the
course—the Pole Climb already men
tioned. It's a 12-foot shinny to the
top, and a 10-foot hand-over-hand
operation down the pipe, which is
inclined at about a 30-degree angle.
The runner, who by now has been
slowed to say the least, next takes on
some parallel bars, through which
he works by his hands, developing
at the same time the muscles of the
forearm.
Log Maze
The Log Maze, next on the pro
gram, is one of the country's favor
ite events, since it involves all the
muscles of the body and develops
quickness and agility. Rules say
-that one must work his way through
the logs without touching the ground
and without climbing across the top.
It is rated one of the best events on
the course by the designers.
The competitor now has six events
behind him, and next attempts to
negotiate the High Wall Climb. He
gets about a 25-foot run, hits the
wall up as high as possible with his
foot, pulls himself to the top, rolls
over and drops to the ground. Main
idea is to get over quickly and at
the same time present as small and
brief a target at the top as possiblie.
Bench Hurdles
The competitor now attempts the
bench hurdles, and in the effort
either exhibits coordination, rhythm,
and running ability or falls fiat on
his face.
An over-and-under operation is

the next one; the runner vaults a
five-foot wall, flops on his stomach
and crawls under the 18-inch-high
barriers. The magazine Newsweek
recently featured an article showing
how actual ammunition is fired 30
inches above the ground at soldiers
in training at Fort Knox to teach
them to crawl low. This event
teaches this while saving the ammu
nition.
Horizontal Rope
He is now more than half way
through, and welcomes the next
event, a climb over a high fence, as
being comparatively simple. The
climb nevertheless develops the arms
and legs as well as climbing skill.
A horizontal rope, stretched nine
feet above the ground between two
trees, is the eleventh obstacle. The
preferred technique is the monkey
climb, in which one wraps arms and
legs around the rope and works his
way along with his hands and feet. I
Water Hole
Next is the High Bench Hurdle,
involving the ability to coordinate
hand and foot action in getting over.
The event is followed by the Broad
Jump where one jumps over a 10-
foot water hole. It's a simple process
but one repeated over and over in
battle. »
Number 14 gives the tired com
petitor a rest, for all he has to do is
weave his way between posts. Num
ber 15, however, involves both a
rope ladder and a shinny rope; one
climbs up the former then down the
latter, trying to burn his hands as
little as possible. Gym classes are
being taught this technique as well
as the skills needed to negotiate suc
cessfully the other events.
Rope Swing
The course comes to an end with
the Rope Swing and Water Hazard.
The event develops timing, coordi
nation, and the arms and shoulders,
since the competitor must leap upon
a rope and swing across about an
18-foot expanse of water.
According to Everett Dean, gym
classes may possibly start making
time trials over the course next
week. After that, all physical educa
tion classes will be taken through
the course at least once a week. At
present all the classes are being
taught by their instructors the proper
method for traversing each event. A
list of instructions including these
suggestions is now being prepared.
Interest in the obstacle course on
the part of the gym classes is al
ready high, and those in charge
feel that it will increase even more,
once competition is started.

must go over without touching his
hands.
Once over the V, things get tough
er with the Rope Wall Climb. The
wall is 14 feet high; one has to climb
up the suspended rope, using his feet
at the same time against the wall;
then drop over onto the ledge, and
jump to the ground. The event de
velops both the arm and shoulder
inuscles, as well as agility.
four-Foot Wall
Event No. 3 is a four-foot wall,
over which one must vault without
touching, which merely warms you
up for the first real ordeal of the
course—the Pole Climb already men
tioned. It's a 12-foot shinny to the
top, and a 10-foot hand-over-hand
operation down the pipe, which is
inclined at about a 30-degree angle.
The runner, who by now has been
slowed to say the least, next takes on
some parallel bars, through which
he works by his hands, developing
at the same time the muscles of the
forearm.
Log Maze
The Log Maze, next on the pro
gram, is one of the country's favor
ite events, since it involves all the
muscles of the body and develops
quickness and agility. Rules say
-that one must work his way through
the logs without touching the ground
and without climbing across the top.
It is rated one of the best events on
the course by the designers.
The competitor now has six events
behind him, and next attempts to
negotiate the High Wall Climb. He
gets about a 25-foot run, hits the
wall up as high as possible with his
foot, pulls himself to the top, rolls
over and drops to the ground. Main
idea is to get over quickly and at
the same time present as small and
brief a target at the top as possiblie.
Bench Hurdles
The competitor now attempts the
bench hurdles, and in the effort
either exhibits coordination, rhythm,
and running ability or falls fiat on
his face.
An over-and-under operation is

the next one; the runner vaults a
five-foot wall, flops on his stomach
and crawls under the 18-inch-high
barriers. The magazine Newsweek
recently featured an article showing
how actual ammunition is fired 30
inches above the ground at soldiers
in training at Fort Knox to teach
them to crawl low. This event
teaches this while saving the ammu
nition.
Horizontal Rope
He is now more than half way
through, and welcomes the next
event, a climb over a high fence, as
being comparatively simple. The
climb nevertheless develops the arms
and legs as well as climbing skill.
A horizontal rope, stretched nine
feet above the ground between two
trees, is the eleventh obstacle. The
preferred technique is the monkey
climb, in which one wraps arms and
legs around the rope and works his
way along with his hands and feet. I
Water Hole
Next is the High Bench Hurdle,
involving the ability to coordinate
hand and foot action in getting over.
The event is followed by the Broad
Jump where one jumps over a 10-
foot water hole. It's a simple process
but one repeated over and over in
battle. »
Number 14 gives the tired com
petitor a rest, for all he has to do is
weave his way between posts. Num
ber 15, however, involves both a
rope ladder and a shinny rope; one
climbs up the former then down the
latter, trying to burn his hands as
little as possible. Gym classes are
being taught this technique as well
as the skills needed to negotiate suc
cessfully the other events.
Rope Swing
The course comes to an end with
the Rope Swing and Water Hazard.
The event develops timing, coordi
nation, and the arms and shoulders,
since the competitor must leap upon
a rope and swing across about an
18-foot expanse of water.
According to Everett Dean, gym
classes may possibly start making
time trials over the course next
week. After that, all physical educa
tion classes will be taken through
the course at least once a week. At
present all the classes are being
taught by their instructors the proper
method for traversing each event. A
list of instructions including these
suggestions is now being prepared.
Interest in the obstacle course on
the part of the gym classes is al
ready high, and those in charge
feel that it will increase even more,
once competition is started.

Some call it a machine of the
Devil, but whether it has anything
to do with the guy with the fork or
not, Stanford's obstacle course is
certainly a machine, about as scien
tific and expertly planned as any \
body-building contraption ever in- I
vented.
The 16-event, 440-yard course lo
cated north of Angell Field and west
of the Stadium is a product of the
intensive study of similar courses
made by Dr. 0. N. Anderson, A1
Masters, and Everett Dean, with cer
tain original events thrown in to
develop the Stanford Rough's weak
est muscles—those in the arms and
shoulders.

foot, pulls himself to the top, rolls
over and drops to the ground. Main
idea is to get over quickly and at
the same time present as small and
brief a target at the top as possiblie.
Bench Hurdles
The competitor now attempts the
bench hurdles, and in the effort
either exhibits coordination, rhythm,
and running ability or falls fiat on
his face.
An over-and-under operation is

the next one; the runner vaults a
five-foot wall, flops on his stomach
and crawls under the 18-inch-high
barriers. The magazine Newsweek
recently featured an article showing
how actual ammunition is fired 30
inches above the ground at soldiers
in training at Fort Knox to teach
them to crawl low. This event
teaches this while saving the ammu
nition.
Horizontal Rope
He is now more than half way
through, and welcomes the next
event, a climb over a high fence, as
being comparatively simple. The
climb nevertheless develops the arms
and legs as well as climbing skill.
A horizontal rope, stretched nine
feet above the ground between two
trees, is the eleventh obstacle. The
preferred technique is the monkey
climb, in which one wraps arms and
legs around the rope and works his
way along with his hands and feet. I
Water Hole
Next is the High Bench Hurdle,
involving the ability to coordinate
hand and foot action in getting over.
The event is followed by the Broad
Jump where one jumps over a 10-
foot water hole. It's a simple process
but one repeated over and over in
battle. »
Number 14 gives the tired com
petitor a rest, for all he has to do is
weave his way between posts. Num
ber 15, however, involves both a
rope ladder and a shinny rope; one
climbs up the former then down the
latter, trying to burn his hands as
little as possible. Gym classes are
being taught this technique as well
as the skills needed to negotiate suc
cessfully the other events.
Rope Swing
The course comes to an end with
the Rope Swing and Water Hazard.
The event develops timing, coordi
nation, and the arms and shoulders,
since the competitor must leap upon
a rope and swing across about an
18-foot expanse of water.
According to Everett Dean, gym
classes may possibly start making
time trials over the course next
week. After that, all physical educa
tion classes will be taken through
the course at least once a week. At
present all the classes are being
taught by their instructors the proper
method for traversing each event. A
list of instructions including these
suggestions is now being prepared.
Interest in the obstacle course on
the part of the gym classes is al
ready high, and those in charge
feel that it will increase even more,
once competition is started.

Some call it a machine of the
Devil, but whether it has anything
to do with the guy with the fork or
not, Stanford's obstacle course is
certainly a machine, about as scien
tific and expertly planned as any \
body-building contraption ever in- I
vented.
The 16-event, 440-yard course lo
cated north of Angell Field and west
of the Stadium is a product of the
intensive study of similar courses
made by Dr. 0. N. Anderson, A1
Masters, and Everett Dean, with cer
tain original events thrown in to
develop the Stanford Rough's weak
est muscles—those in the arms and
shoulders.
Original Events
The three men studied especially
courses located at Redwood City
High School and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, and looked at motion pictures
of various other courses throughout |
the country.
Having selected the best events I
from these observations, they then !
thought up such body builders as !
the Pole Climb (shinny up pole, j
then work hand over hand down |
pipe), and the Low Crawl (crawl on
stomach under barriers 18 inches
above ground). Money for the course
came from the proceeds of the Stan
ford-St. Mary's Pre-Flight football
game last fall.
V-Log Ladder
The course itself combines condi- ,
tions found in land warfare with ;
events which will help build up
anns, shoulders, legs, timing, and co
ordination.
Torture begins with the Inverted
V-Log Ladder, so-called because it
involves a wooden inverted V with
logs for steps. Rule is that one
must go over without touching his
hands.
Once over the V, things get tough
er with the Rope Wall Climb. The
wall is 14 feet high; one has to climb
up the suspended rope, using his feet
at the same time against the wall;
then drop over onto the ledge, and
jump to the ground. The event de
velops both the arm and shoulder
inuscles, as well as agility.
four-Foot Wall
Event No. 3 is a four-foot wall,
over which one must vault without
touching, which merely warms you
up for the first real ordeal of the
course—the Pole Climb already men
tioned. It's a 12-foot shinny to the
top, and a 10-foot hand-over-hand
operation down the pipe, which is
inclined at about a 30-degree angle.
The runner, who by now has been
slowed to say the least, next takes on
some parallel bars, through which
he works by his hands, developing
at the same time the muscles of the
forearm.
Log Maze
The Log Maze, next on the pro
gram, is one of the country's favor
ite events, since it involves all the
muscles of the body and develops
quickness and agility. Rules say
-that one must work his way through
the logs without touching the ground
and without climbing across the top.
It is rated one of the best events on
the course by the designers.

petitor a rest, for all he has to do is
weave his way between posts. Num
ber 15, however, involves both a
rope ladder and a shinny rope; one
climbs up the former then down the
latter, trying to burn his hands as
little as possible. Gym classes are
being taught this technique as well
as the skills needed to negotiate suc
cessfully the other events.
Rope Swing
The course comes to an end with
the Rope Swing and Water Hazard.
The event develops timing, coordi
nation, and the arms and shoulders,
since the competitor must leap upon
a rope and swing across about an
18-foot expanse of water.
According to Everett Dean, gym
classes may possibly start making
time trials over the course next
week. After that, all physical educa
tion classes will be taken through
the course at least once a week. At
present all the classes are being
taught by their instructors the proper
method for traversing each event. A
list of instructions including these
suggestions is now being prepared.
Interest in the obstacle course on
the part of the gym classes is al
ready high, and those in charge
feel that it will increase even more,
once competition is started.

Some call it a machine of the
Devil, but whether it has anything
to do with the guy with the fork or
not, Stanford's obstacle course is
certainly a machine, about as scien
tific and expertly planned as any \
body-building contraption ever in- I
vented.
The 16-event, 440-yard course lo
cated north of Angell Field and west
of the Stadium is a product of the
intensive study of similar courses
made by Dr. 0. N. Anderson, A1
Masters, and Everett Dean, with cer
tain original events thrown in to
develop the Stanford Rough's weak
est muscles—those in the arms and
shoulders.
Original Events
The three men studied especially
courses located at Redwood City
High School and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight, and looked at motion pictures
of various other courses throughout |
the country.
Having selected the best events I
from these observations, they then !
thought up such body builders as !
the Pole Climb (shinny up pole, j
then work hand over hand down |
pipe), and the Low Crawl (crawl on
stomach under barriers 18 inches
above ground). Money for the course
came from the proceeds of the Stan
ford-St. Mary's Pre-Flight football
game last fall.
V-Log Ladder
The course itself combines condi- ,
tions found in land warfare with ;
events which will help build up
anns, shoulders, legs, timing, and co
ordination.
Torture begins with the Inverted
V-Log Ladder, so-called because it
involves a wooden inverted V with
logs for steps. Rule is that one
must go over without touching his
hands.
Once over the V, things get tough
er with the Rope Wall Climb. The
wall is 14 feet high; one has to climb
up the suspended rope, using his feet
at the same time against the wall;
then drop over onto the ledge, and
jump to the ground. The event de
velops both the arm and shoulder
inuscles, as well as agility.
four-Foot Wall
Event No. 3 is a four-foot wall,
over which one must vault without
touching, which merely warms you
up for the first real ordeal of the
course—the Pole Climb already men
tioned. It's a 12-foot shinny to the
top, and a 10-foot hand-over-hand
operation down the pipe, which is
inclined at about a 30-degree angle.
The runner, who by now has been
slowed to say the least, next takes on
some parallel bars, through which
he works by his hands, developing
at the same time the muscles of the
forearm.
Log Maze
The Log Maze, next on the pro
gram, is one of the country's favor
ite events, since it involves all the
muscles of the body and develops
quickness and agility. Rules say
-that one must work his way through
the logs without touching the ground
and without climbing across the top.
It is rated one of the best events on
the course by the designers.
The competitor now has six events
behind him, and next attempts to
negotiate the High Wall Climb. He
gets about a 25-foot run, hits the
wall up as high as possible with his
foot, pulls himself to the top, rolls
over and drops to the ground. Main
idea is to get over quickly and at
the same time present as small and
brief a target at the top as possiblie.
Bench Hurdles
The competitor now attempts the
bench hurdles, and in the effort
either exhibits coordination, rhythm,
and running ability or falls fiat on
his face.
An over-and-under operation is

the next one; the runner vaults a
five-foot wall, flops on his stomach
and crawls under the 18-inch-high
barriers. The magazine Newsweek
recently featured an article showing
how actual ammunition is fired 30
inches above the ground at soldiers
in training at Fort Knox to teach
them to crawl low. This event
teaches this while saving the ammu
nition.
Horizontal Rope
He is now more than half way
through, and welcomes the next
event, a climb over a high fence, as
being comparatively simple. The
climb nevertheless develops the arms
and legs as well as climbing skill.
A horizontal rope, stretched nine
feet above the ground between two
trees, is the eleventh obstacle. The
preferred technique is the monkey
climb, in which one wraps arms and
legs around the rope and works his
way along with his hands and feet. I
Water Hole
Next is the High Bench Hurdle,
involving the ability to coordinate
hand and foot action in getting over.
The event is followed by the Broad
Jump where one jumps over a 10-
foot water hole. It's a simple process
but one repeated over and over in
battle. »

petitor a rest, for all he has to do is

ber 15, however, involves both a
