# Intensive Jap Course 'Pays Off'
## 
### 
The 24 Stanford men and women I
who spoke, thought, and lived in the \
intricacies of the Japanese language
last winter for a well-deserved 20 j
units won their reward this quarter I
when 16 of their number—all who J
were eligible—were selected by the \
Army for further specialized train
ing in the Army Japanese language
school.
With other Stanford men in the
Enlisted Reserve Corps, many of
them reported to Monterey last Mon
day and were sworn into the Army.
Before May 1 they expect to be back
at Ann Arbor, Michigan, with college
men from all over the country, work
ing at an intensive advance Japanese
course to prepare them for Army in
telligence work.
To Minnesota
When they finish at Michigan, they i
go to Savage. Minnesota, where they i
will learn the special techniques of J
an Army intelligence officer.
Just about a year from now those
16 men will be accomplished enough
in speaking and understanding the
language and in reading and writing
the thousands of word symbols which
compose it to take over intelligence
duties now and lead the occupation
of Tokyo later. Then they will re
ceive their commissions as second
lieutenants.
When the war broke out in the
Pacific, Americans, who hadn't at
tached much real importance to the
blusterings of the Japanese, were
woefully ignorant on the subject of
their language. Few knew much
about it except that it was "difficult."
Rumors of elaborate syntax and hun
dreds of characters had scared even
tourists from trying to pick up
phrases.
Rigid Course
The language is difficult, yes, as
: the Stanford students learned, but
! not impossible. With careful, em
j phatic teaching they were able to
learn in one quarter not only the
common conversational phrases
which would serve them well in
dealing with the Japanese people
but the rules of grammar which
form an essential basis for a real
mastery of the language in the
future.
The schedule for the course is
rigid, naturally—six hours of classes
I a day, five days a week, and a three
| hour quiz every Saturday. But it
I brings results. Major Karl T. Gould
of the Army Japanese Language
school told Dr. John W. Dodds, dean
of the School of Humanities, that
Stanford students compared more

than favorably with students of I
Japanese all over the country.
Can't Sleep
The 16 who went into Army intel
ligence left the class with less than
half its ofigmal personnel. But the j
ones who were left — women and,
members of the Naval Reserve—
kept on with their work. A few who
had been accepted for the Army
kept on auditing the class—even the
8 o'clock writing session — while
waiting to be called. And there's no
chance to sleep through an 8 o'clock
in the Japanese language. "They
don't have a chance to feci sleepy,"
Atcheson says.
Assisting him in instruction are
Mrs. Tuksoon Kim, Margarita Kopf,
and Kuang Hao Hsiao, assistants in
the Department of Humanities, and
Professor W. L. Schwartz of the Ro
manic Languages Department.
Demand Exceeds
The workout that the remaining
students are getting now will even
tually lead to an even greater work
out on the spot with the Navy, the
Army, or the Civil Service. The
words they learn from their instruc
tor will be replaced by words from
Tokyo and Kobe.
This may be military information
of the highest value or merely over
ambitious propaganda that neverthe
less must be translated and recorded.
The demand for these interpreters
who remain far exceeds the supply.

Many of the Navy Reservists will go
into the Navy Intelligence Service.
The Navy also has opened its doors
to the women in the class and will
supplement their basic knowledge
with full training in the language
with an eye to placing them in the
Intelligence Service. They will be
commissioned officers in the WAVES
on completion of the year's intensive
course at the University of Colorado.
5-Unit Course
Civil Service positions are waiting
for women with more advanced
knowledge of the language which
will imply research and analysis of
strategic information.
To care for interested students
who were unable to devote their en
tire program to the study of Jap
anese, the department this quarter
opened a five-unit course entitled
"Conversational Japanese," which
may be expected to teach the funda
mental phrases for giving orders to
conquered Japanese soldiers and of
ficers.
Should the Army specialist school
come to Stanford, many of the places
in the course may be taken over by
soldiers, whose registration naturally
will be given priority. Until the de
partment is too understaffed, how
ever the Japanese language course
will be given to as many students as
are willing to devote 20 units n
quarter to preparing to lead the pa
rade to Tokyo.
