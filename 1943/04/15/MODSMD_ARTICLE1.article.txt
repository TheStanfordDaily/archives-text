GEN. MacARTHUR'S H.Q., Aus
tralia, April 15 (U.R) — Japanese
planes, 75 to 100 strong, raided Milne
Bay at the southeastern tip to New
Guinea Wednesday, damaging three
small Allied vessels, but Allied fight
er planes shot 30 of the raiders out
of action, the headquarters' com
munique announced today.
The Japanese force, continuing a
battle for control of the air over a
wide area at the approaches to Aus
tralia, consisted of 46 medium and
dive bombers, with fighter escorts.
'Our fighter plane losses were
moderate and damages to the shore
installations negligible," the noon
communique reported.
The raiders inflicted some casual
ties to personnel on the three small
vessels.
Allied fighters shot out of action—
meaning shot down, damaged, pos
sibly damaged, or forced to break off
the engagement—were 22 of the
bombers and 8 of the fighters sent
against Milne Bay, strategic Allied
held area dominating the sea chan
nels between New Guinea and the
Solomons.
The raid ranked with previous at
tacks launched this week by the
Japanese, ostensibly to wrest control
of the air from the Allies in the
vital area.
