# RESERVES
## Navy, Marines To Take Test 
### 
All Marine and Navy Reservists
in their freshman and sophomore
years must take a qualifying test on
April 20. This is entirely distinct
from the test recently given to test
| civilians desiring to enter any of the
j services.
According to information received
| from the Marine headquarters in
! Washington by Dr. Karl Cowdery,
i Armed Services Eepresentative, the
I qualifying program will consist of
I the written test, which is in the na
ture of a general intelligence test,
i and considerationof their general
! and scholastic standing, aptitude,
I and recommendations of the college
| authorities.
I Text of Letter
The letter said in part:
| "Under the old program of re
j quiring students to graduate at their
I own expense prior to assignment to
| the Officer Candidates' Class it is
i apparent that successful completion
of their college courses gave strong
indication of their aptitude for of
! ficer training.
"With the change to the new Col
lege Training Program, with college
i training at the expense of the Gov
ernment. it is felt that aptitude for
j further college training should be
indicated. This is presumed in the
, case of those who have attained their
I junior college year.
' Screening Test
j "In view of the Navy qualifying
| examination for V-l men complet
: ing their sophomore year it is felt
| that certainly a screening examina
tion should be made of the Marine
under-classmen, to insure that those
going on into the new program have
at least the qualifications for further
college training. The interests of the
student and the United States Gov
ernment have been thoroughly con
sidered in arranging the examina
tion."
Notices of the time and place of
the examinations will be sent, when
possible, to the individual reservists,
j Further notices will also be carried
| in The Stanford Daily.
The test given previously was for
| all civilians desiring to enter any of
i the armed services' college training
| programs. It was given simultane
' ously throughout the country.
