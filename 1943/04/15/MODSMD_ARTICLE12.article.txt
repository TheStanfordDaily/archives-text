# Civil Jobs For Women Described

### 
The American Council on Educa
tion has just released Bulletin No. i
50 on "Opportunities for College |
Women in Federal Government J
Service."
According to the bulletin, "Like
the armed forces, the WAVES, the
WAACS, the SPARS, and the Ma
rines, the civilian services of the j
government offer important fields of
work for women college graduates
today .In these civilian services as j
well as in the armed forces, women 1
can frequently release men for more
direct combat duty.
Growing Field
"Appointments to government po- :
.sitions today are for the duration of
the war and six months thereafter,
but the public service constitute a
growing and a challenging field for
college women in peace as well as
in war.
"In war time government includes
the general activities of peace, with
many of them on an expanded basis,
such as the control of public health
and transportation, but in addition
includes many new fields of work
necessary in the development and
maintenance of production and of a
world-wide war machine and war
economy.
Opportunities Available
"There are opportunities for col
lege women in all of these fields in
government, in some of which wo
men have rarely been found before,
such as in engineering and even in
some aspects of production in ar
senals and shipyards; in some of
which both men and women are
needed even under war circum
stances, such as in medical services
and administrative work; and in
the investigating and advisory posi
tions in the Women's and Children's
Bureaus.
"It is impossible to state exact and
definite numbers of trained women
whom the government requires or
will require, whether of college or
non-college graduates. The rapid
growth and change in the develop
ment and organization of many gov
ernment agencies, together with the
piecemeal withdrawal of many men
for the armed forces prevents an
over-all estimate of demands ahead.
Immediate Need
"The immediate need is for women
to replace men in numerous gov
ernment positions which the war
has created in the government serv

ice. An order of the War Manpower
Commission, announced in the papers
on Feb. 3, 1943. will wipe out the
deferred status of many federal em
ployees between 18 and 38 and prob
ably increase the need for women.
"In many fields of government as
in industry there are marked criti
cal or shortage occupations where
demands far exceed supply. In cer
tain fields, the difficulty of obtaining
sufficient trained and experienced
personnel has become so great that
the public service has considered it
necessary to employ persons with
little or no experience and frequent
ly with insufficient training, or to
transfer personnel from less critical
fields.
Need Is Urgent
"The immediate need is for women
trained in specialized, technical fields
of study. War needs are so urgent
that they will not permit as much
time to be spent on training as was
formerly allowed in a normal edu
cation curriculum. So the present
emphasis is on intensive and essen
tially practical courses which give
knowledge of specific fields and tech
niques. On the other hand, the long
range need for fully trained persons
in such special subjects as engineer
ing and medicine is constantly ap
parent.
"There has been such a noticeable
growth of the career system in pub
lic positions that government agen
cies in general have come to fill
many of the higher professional po
sitions by promotions from within.
Although war service posts do not
give their incumbents status for fu
ture promotions after six months
beyond the duration, nevertheless, a
college woman entering government
on a permanent basis can look to a
real career in the public service."
