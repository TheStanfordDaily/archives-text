# 'Do Re Mi's is Hilarious Comedy About Sullivans
## 
### Cheri Martin 
Last night's performance by the Stanford Players of Alladine Bell's
new comedy, '"Do Re Mi," opened the five-night run in the Little Theater.
And for the first performance, the play was well done, and was a very
clever production.
The comedy centers around the loves and lives of the members of the
Sullivan family, who live in a small town in Idaho. The family consists of
Ma Sullivan (Pa is dead), and her two sons and daughters. Love seems
to be their chief difficulty. Her husband is the blight on Mary Sullivan's
life, while Dal can't get along with his wife or his cows. In the mean
time, Clare is trying to catch a husband, while her young brother John is
about caught.
The title is derived from the fact that John has a good tenor voice and
Claire has a plan to send him to New York to have his voice trained and
to disentangle him from his local heart troubles.
The play is very cleverly written and is very good comedy. It is fast
moving, and Miss Bell's characters are unique and amusing. The por
trayal of the characters is particularly good, and the play reflects through
out the excellent direction of F. Cowles Strickland.
The entire play is built around the family arguments of this merry
group, and the actors fit their parts to a tee. Particularly good is Betty
Wattenberger as Clare.
She must be both reserved in her dealings with the man she is trying
to catch, played by Russell Bryan, but must be domineering and noisy to
hold her own with her family. She is trying to help her brother, played by
William Hawkes, to get his chance at fame, Hawkes plays the perfect 18-
year-old who can't decide what to do with his girl friend who is taking him
too seriously and decides that the New York plan is a good idea. These
two exchange their lines with a lot of spirit and they as the main characters
put the play over.
Joyce Henderson plays the mother of this crazy family and she has just
about given up trying to cope with their antics and nonchalantly sits and
shells peas in front of Clare's boy friend in the living room. She must even
tolerate her married daughter, played by Jean Robinson, who continually
leaves her husband merely to test his love. She is very funny as she pines
for Ed, played by Duane Heath, to come after her and take her back to
their lonely farm.
Although the first night's production was a little unpolished, the play
has unlimited possibilities and for good entertainment, last night's audience
would recommend "Do Re Mi."

to disentangle him from his local heart troubles.
The play is very cleverly written and is very good comedy. It is fast
moving, and Miss Bell's characters are unique and amusing. The por
trayal of the characters is particularly good, and the play reflects through
out the excellent direction of F. Cowles Strickland.
The entire play is built around the family arguments of this merry
group, and the actors fit their parts to a tee. Particularly good is Betty
Wattenberger as Clare.
She must be both reserved in her dealings with the man she is trying
to catch, played by Russell Bryan, but must be domineering and noisy to
hold her own with her family. She is trying to help her brother, played by
William Hawkes, to get his chance at fame, Hawkes plays the perfect 18-
year-old who can't decide what to do with his girl friend who is taking him
too seriously and decides that the New York plan is a good idea. These
two exchange their lines with a lot of spirit and they as the main characters
put the play over.
Joyce Henderson plays the mother of this crazy family and she has just
about given up trying to cope with their antics and nonchalantly sits and
shells peas in front of Clare's boy friend in the living room. She must even
tolerate her married daughter, played by Jean Robinson, who continually
leaves her husband merely to test his love. She is very funny as she pines
for Ed, played by Duane Heath, to come after her and take her back to
their lonely farm.
Although the first night's production was a little unpolished, the play
has unlimited possibilities and for good entertainment, last night's audience
would recommend "Do Re Mi."
Last night's performance by the Stanford Players of Alladine Bell's
new comedy, '"Do Re Mi," opened the five-night run in the Little Theater.
And for the first performance, the play was well done, and was a very
clever production.
The comedy centers around the loves and lives of the members of the
Sullivan family, who live in a small town in Idaho. The family consists of
Ma Sullivan (Pa is dead), and her two sons and daughters. Love seems
to be their chief difficulty. Her husband is the blight on Mary Sullivan's
life, while Dal can't get along with his wife or his cows. In the mean
time, Clare is trying to catch a husband, while her young brother John is
about caught.
The title is derived from the fact that John has a good tenor voice and
Claire has a plan to send him to New York to have his voice trained and
to disentangle him from his local heart troubles.
