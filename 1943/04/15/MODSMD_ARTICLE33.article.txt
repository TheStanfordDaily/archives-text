# TRAINING
## War Courses Begin June 21 
### 
War Training Courses, consisting ;
of Aircraft Drafting, Engineering j
Drafting, and Technical Calculations, !
will begin June 21.
The Aircraft Drafting course will
contain elementary mechanical
drawing, lettering, technical sketch
ing, isometrics, use of instruments,
orthographic projection, dimension
ing technique, auxiliary vies; ele
mentary engineering mathematics,
descriptive geometry, aircraft draft
ing practices, lectures on materials
and processes, introduction to sta
tics, and elementary strength of
materials.
The Engineering Drafting and
Technical Calculations course will
qualify those who complete it suc
cessfully to enter industrial draft
ing and engineering offices or to
accept government employment. The
course will cover the field of pro
jection, section development, letter
ing, dimensioning, shop convention,
and reading of working drawings and
the use of drafting instruments.
Technical calculations will be pre
ceded by a short review of arithme
tic, simple algebra, and geometry.
There will be specified hours in the
drafting room.
Prerequisites
These courses will start Monday,
June 12. and continue for 12 weeks
through Sept. 10, meeting eight hours
a day, Mondays through Fridays.
The prerequisite for enrollment is
high-school graduation, including
two years of mathematics or the
equivalent. Preference will be given
to those who have had courses or
experience in instrumental or free
hand drawing, and to those who have
had additional work in mathematics
or science.
Although these courses are pri
marily intended to train women for
drafting, men who seem unlikely to
be called into the armed services are
l also eligible. No tuition is charged
as costs of instruction arc provided
from federal funds, but students
must furnish their own equipment,
i and provide for their own room and
| board. Information regarding ac-
I commodations in Palo Alto may be
i secured in Room 267, Engineering
j building.
Applications
Application should be made by
! letter addressed to War Training
| Office, Room 265 A. Engineering
j Bldg., Stanford University. The let
ter should clearly state the following:
high school attended and date of
graduation; courses taken in mathe
i matics, science, and drawing with
| grades received; any education be
yond high school; any work expe
: rience; age, birthplace, and home
address; course for which application
; is made.
No university credit is given foi
this course, but a certificate will be
i given to all who complete it satis
| factorily. Students in these courses
j must intend to accept employmenl
in war industries. Although no em
! ployment is guaranteed to the stu
j dent who completes a course, there
I seem to be definite job opportunities
| for all those trained, according to i
!release.

War Training Courses, consisting ;
of Aircraft Drafting, Engineering j
Drafting, and Technical Calculations, !
will begin June 21.
The Aircraft Drafting course will
contain elementary mechanical
drawing, lettering, technical sketch
ing, isometrics, use of instruments,
orthographic projection, dimension
ing technique, auxiliary vies; ele
mentary engineering mathematics,
descriptive geometry, aircraft draft
ing practices, lectures on materials
and processes, introduction to sta
tics, and elementary strength of
materials.
The Engineering Drafting and
Technical Calculations course will
qualify those who complete it suc
cessfully to enter industrial draft
ing and engineering offices or to
accept government employment. The
course will cover the field of pro
jection, section development, letter
ing, dimensioning, shop convention,
and reading of working drawings and
the use of drafting instruments.
Technical calculations will be pre
ceded by a short review of arithme
tic, simple algebra, and geometry.
There will be specified hours in the
drafting room.
Prerequisites
These courses will start Monday,
June 12. and continue for 12 weeks
through Sept. 10, meeting eight hours
a day, Mondays through Fridays.
The prerequisite for enrollment is
high-school graduation, including
two years of mathematics or the
equivalent. Preference will be given
to those who have had courses or
experience in instrumental or free
hand drawing, and to those who have
had additional work in mathematics
or science.
Although these courses are pri
marily intended to train women for
drafting, men who seem unlikely to
be called into the armed services are
l also eligible. No tuition is charged
as costs of instruction arc provided
from federal funds, but students
must furnish their own equipment,
