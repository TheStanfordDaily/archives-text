A scrapping of the Pacific Coast
Conference's "football as usual"
1943 grid schedules has been recom
mended jointly by Graduate Man
agers A1 Masters of Stanford and
Clint Evans of California.
Meeting with representatives of
all Bay Area college and service
football teams, Masters and Evans
declared that it would be impracti
cable for Coast grid squads to travel
as far as 1000 miles for games, and
indicated that in event (he Confer
ence scraps the sked in June, Stan
ford and California would attempt
to line up such teams as St. Mary's,
U.S.F., St. Mary's Pre-Flight, and
Santa Clara for contests.
Play Rround Robin
Both men felt, however, that the
four southern schools — Stanford,
California, U.C.L.A., and U.S.C.—
would be able to play a round robin
with each other.
The meeting was originally called
by representatives of the independ
ent grid teams in the Bay Area to
settle the dispute over football dates
lor Kezar Stadium. Those present
were Jim Phelan of St. Mary's;
George Barsi and Buck Shaw, Santa
Clara; James Needles, U.S.F.; Lieut.
Joe Verducci, Coast Guard, and
Lieut. Don Liebendorfer, St. Mary's
Pre-Flight.
Grid Contests
If the Conference representatives
do scrap the schedule when they
meet in June, the way will be open
for long-advocated grid contests be
tween Stanford and St. Mary's and
California and U.S.F. Service teams
in the area which should be strong
include those from the Coast Guard,
St. Mary's Pre-Flight, and Masters
Field in Sacramento.
It was noted at the meeting that
most of those present were confident
their respective organizations would
have football teams come fall. Only
Santa Clara was doubtful, but Shaw
and Barsi figured the chances were
good enough to warrant their being
present for the meeting.
Although Masters and Evans can
not go ahead and revise their sched
ules until after the Conference
meeting, they declared that they
would argue at that meeting for the
discontinuance of the present sked.
"Even as early as this, it seems
apparent that travel facilities are too
cramped to allow teams to play
away from home as they have in
the past," comented Masters.
