Short slants from all over: Down i
South Pomona's Galen Fischer and j
S.C.'s Cliff Bourland are going after i
(he world 300-yard-dash record in j
a meet in the Los Angeles Coliseum |
Saturday. Existing world record for i
the distance is:30.2, held by Charley i
Paddock. Both Bourland and Fischer j
j have been under :30.8 this season, i
j . . . Murray Collins, San Jose's great j
j little prep school miler, is the latest
j high school track star around here
J who wants to go to Stanford. Wood- i
I son Linn, Santa Clara High School
| weightman, also is interested in the
j Farm. . . . Comparison of times in
| the Stanford-College of Pacific
j swimfest with those of the U.S.C.-
! U.C.L.A. meet held April 7 indicate
' the advantage this year to be with 1
the northerners. Southern time for
the 100 was :55.8; up here it was :55.
Cashin's 2:19 in the 200-yard breast
stroke was 13 seconds better than
the winning time for the event in
L.A. Of all the events, comparison
of the marks in the 50-yard free
style was the only one showing the
advantage to be with U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. . . . With the Coast Con
| ference, P.A.A., and N.C.A.A. track
meets all called off, the Fresno Re
lays will probably be the only time
California, Stanford, and U.S.C. cin
der squads will get together. Should
the Trojans enter, it will give Bour
land, Grover Klemmer, and Johnny
j Fulton a chance to push each other
| mighty near a world record in the
: 440.
FOUL TIPS
Stanford's baseball team finally
| broke the jinx that had haunted
| them for two weeks, and if our play
j ers' attitude after the game is any
' indication, the boys are going to be
, hard to beat from now on. . . . the
| outstanding play of the day was
Ward Walkup's sensational catch of
a foul ball against the backstop, and
; his equally great throw a second
later which nipped a budding Bron
co run at third. . . . Howie Dallmar,
who has done most of his playing on
! the hardwoods instead of a diamond.
J broke info the lineup and handled
j the first base duties like a king,
j Dallmar has a good eye, and after a

few more games, lie ought to be hit
ting like Ted Williams. One for
four isn't a bad starter. . . . For the
first two innings it looked like the
score might be in the double columns
before the game terminated, but
both clubs' pitchers settled down, and
kept the score low. . . . Santa Clara's
big third baseman, Mitch Lobrovich,
who is the Broncs' home-run artist,
proved to be no disappjointment—
until Jack Miller "K'd" him in the
eighth.
