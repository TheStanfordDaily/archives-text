# Indian Baseball Team Whips Santa Clara Broncs, 7 to 4
## 
### Bill Allen 
Stanford's undaunted baseball
team came to life yesterday and j
soundly trounced the second-place i
Santa Clara Broncs on the loser's |
diamond. The game was put on ice i
in the third inning when Jay McKie j
trippled and then went home on
Wakefield's hard-hit single through |
the infield.
Bernard Woody started on the ]
mound for the Indians and was in j
trouble all the way, although two i
double plays saved his neck. He was j
taken out of the ball game on the j
hill and let the Missionmen down I
without a hit for the remainder of
the game.
Broncos Start Early
Santa Clara started the ball roll- j
ing in the first inning when Len
Scarpelli slashed a triple to center
field, advanced to third on a long fly |
ball, scoring on the same type of
play. The next batter, Mitch Lobro
vich, drove a smashing triple into
center and scored a moment later
when Duane Crawford singled.
The Broncos rang the bell again in j
the second frame when Scarpelli
walked, stole second and scored on !
Brigand's single to center field. That
about finished Santa Clara's scoring j
except for Lobrovich's home run in |
the seventh inning with the bases j
empty.
Reds Come Back
After going down one, two, three
in the first the Cards unloosened
their bats and punched across one
tally, Merriman scoring from sec- |
ond when Walkup hit into a double
play. Taking up where they left off
in the third, the Reds pushed across j
two more runs to tie up the ball
game. The tallies came when Elliot
walked and advanced to second on
Washburn's bunt. Pie scored when
Duane Crawford errored. Washburn
tagged up at third and went in
when Merriman lined out a long fly |
to left.
Stanford put the game away in the j
third as McKie came out of oblivion
to knock out his triple and score on i
Wakefield's hit.
The Reds hit the jackpot in the
seventh and eighth again ringing up
three runs. From then on it was only
a matter of time.
Walkup Stars
Ward Walkup, acting captain of j
the Cards, pulled one of the sweetest j
plays ever seen by this writer. Di- i
minutive Bill Crowley of the Mis- j
sions hit a high foul in back of the
plate. Walkup raced back and made
a magnificent catch, losing his bal
ance and crashing into the screen.
He recovered himself in time to !
make a throw to third base and re- j
tire Scarpelli who ha<* tagged up at |
second going down after the catch. :
The fielding of the game was er
ratic, both teams executing two
double plays and Stanford commit- i
ting three errors to Santa Clara's
four.
With Doc Mason on the injured
list, blond Bernard Woody did a
satisfactory job for four innings after
he got past the terrific riding given
to him in the first two frames, j
Mitch Lobrovich was the boy that j
was really in his hair. Mitch faced j
him four times, walking two of the j
four and smashing a triple and a
home run the other two. The homer
was the start of the rally that sent
Woody to the showers in favor of j
Jack Miller, fast-ball relief artist.
Jack was a Frank Merriwell in
the last half of the ninth inning. He j
assisted in the first out and then pro
ceeded to fan Lobrovich and Pren
tice to end the ball game.
Coach Wolter was impressed with j
the powerful hitting of Jay McKie,
third sacker. McKie only made one I
hit for four times at bat but he
batted in one run with a scorching
grounder in the eighth which went
right through the shortstop's legs.
