# 'Dodgers' Win Championship
## 
### 
NEW YORK, April 14 (UP).â€”The
Brooklyn Dodgers won the mythical
metropolitan baseball championship
today by dusting off the Yankees
and the Giants before 35.301 fans.
The Battling Bums served notice
on the world champion St. Louis
Cardinals that they would be tough
as they set the Yankees six to one,
and then used mostly rookies to
squeeze past the Giants one to zero.
Louis (Bobo) Newsom sent the
Flatbush flock oft to a flying start
against the Yankees in the opening
game when he handcuffed the Yan
kees with only two hits and no runs
for five innings as his mates ran up
a five-run lead.
Less Webber went the rest of the
way in a breeze to send the Dodgers
into the second game.
The Yanks were a sad and inept
looking ball club as they suffered
their fourth straight set-back at the
hands of the Dodgers.
