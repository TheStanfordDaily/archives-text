# Lake Lagunita Saves Girls' Laundry Bill
## 
### 
Yes, Tuesday was a beautiful
day for canoeing: especially after
a hot old lab. So thought two
Casa Ventura girls who proceeded
to go canoeing with all their cloth
ing on.
Of course they didn't expect the
canoe to run away from them
when thev slopped off for a min
ute to stretch their legs on a raft.
Neither did they expect the raft
to tip over after they had been
standing on it for nearly an hour
yelling for help as two football
players sat nearby in another canoe
forbidding anybody to rescue them.
So, naturally their clothes,
watches, etc., got damp in the
long swim home. But think of
the laundiv bill thev saved!
