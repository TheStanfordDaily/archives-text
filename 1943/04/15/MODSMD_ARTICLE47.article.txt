## Weeden Ready for Cal Meet; Cashin To Try for Record 
### 
Stanford's swimming team was |
aolstered yesterday by the return of j
jackstroke acc A1 Weeden. Weeden, I
kvho has been in the hospital for the
past three weeks, worked out. and
woach Ernie Brandsten thinks that
be will be in top shape when the
Indians meet California this Satur
day at Berkeley.
Yleet Close
Brandsten figures the meet with j
the Bears to be extremely close, but
with the return of Weeden and the
continued brilliant performances of j
breaststroker Emmett Cashin, Stan
ford should win by about six points, j
Cashin will again swim, and should !
dominate, the 200-yard breaststroke.
His goal for the afternoon is to set a i
new California pool record for the
100-yard breast stroke while on the
way to the 200-yard finish.
Record Listed
The present pool record for 100
yards is 1:04 set by James Verson
of the Bears in 1937. The world rec
ord for the same distance was set by
Dick Hough at Princeton University
in the time of :60.2.
As Cashin swam the first 100 yards
in 1:02.3 last week in the meet with
the College of Pacific, he will un
doubtedly crack the existing Cal
pool mark.
Weeden Entered
For the 200-yard medley relay,
Brandsten proposes to use Weeden,
who is about four seconds faster than
Bob Mapel in the backstroke. Bill
Mapel or Bordan Ferrar, and Hank
Saltenstall.
In the 400-yard relay Brandsten
will stick to the same lineup as he
used in the tankmen's last encoun
ter: Don Smith, Bill Mapel, Cashin,
and Saltonstall.
Beanston Star
The Indians' main competition is
expected to come from Don Beans
ton, who placed fifth in the N.C.A.A.
440-yard freestyle, Ross Bean in the
220 freestyle, and Frank Grannis in
the 100-yard freestyle.
Other performers of Cal are Clar
ence Arth in the breaststroke. Bill
Simkins, backstroke, Stan Morket
ter, Johnny Norris, and Bill Rein
hard.
Places Count
The California team defeated the
C.O.P. squad by about eight points
earlier this season, while the Cards
nosed out the Tigers by one point
in a 38-37 struggle.
Coach Brandsten hinted that Stan
ford's second and third places would
probably mean the difference be
tween victory and defeat.
The meet is scheduled to begin at
2:30 p.m.
The California-Stanford swim
ming rivalry started 27 years ago,
being climaxed last year with what

was called one of the finest meets
ever held between the two univer
sities .
Stanford took the meet last year
by one point, 38-37. Don Smith, this
year's only returning veteran, led
the Cards by annexing one event,
placing secord in another, and brine
ining the Indians the meet in the 44C
relay.
