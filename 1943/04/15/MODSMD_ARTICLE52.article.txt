# Don't Dissipate It
## 
### 
FT has long been our belief that the Honor
L Code works. That is we believe that a cer
tain number of persons are going to cheat if
there is proctoring, and a certain number are
going to cheat under the Honor Code. We be
lieve that fewer cheat under the Honor Code.
Also it has long been our belief that the im
portance of the Honor Code has been wasted
on trivialities. If, as ihe campus opinion today
says, the Honor Code were applied to a limited
number of important things and not any whim
of anyone.
Why should the painting of the California
"C," the eight hours of war work, or the turn
ing one's self in for violating the quiet hourâ€”
why should these matters be the concern of
the Honor Code.
It is not a panacea for all the executives and
disciplinary problems that running a large uni
versity presents. We should not dissipate the
Honor Code on "just any old thing." It has
its specific uses and there it should be used.
