### CYCLONE COVEY 
And so the other evening, there being
nothing but cold air in our domicile refriger
ators, exactly five of our motley number lit
out rather late to a downtown culinary esta
blishment and set about the ordering of a hasty
satiation.
What we ordered first they did not have,
and everybody re-ordered a few times till he
had hit on available stock. Then our efficient
waitress decided she had better write it all
down.
"Let's see," she said, "two milks, two straw
berry shakes, and two coffees."
'"No, no. Three milks, one shake, and
one tea."
She made her corrections. "How do you
spell 'hamburger'?" she asked, and we for
tunately had that information right at hand.
"What does the menu say the price of chicken
sandwich is?" she asked. And so on.
At long last she seemed to feel satisfied and
went away. But presently she was back. "We
ain't got but two pieces of apple pie."
"That's all right, we'll take two apple and

the rest berry, one of the apple a la mode and
got much else to do, nowhow."
She promptly brought two plain apples and
two plain berries. "One of each a la mode,"
the directions were patiently repeated. So
she left both berry pieces on the table and took
the two apple pieces back. A long time af
terward, however, she managd to get straight
ened out, and went to turn our main order in
to the chef.
Twenty minutes later we were wondering
why it took so long to cook such short orders,
when the restless gaze of him opposite chanced
to fall upon the end of the counter, and 10, there
was our waitress, still figuring out our orders.
She came back and said, "I cain't quite make
out my own writing here," and we deciphered
it all and made many corrections.
When we were finally served, our waitress
came over and remarked, "The boss says to
put this all on separate checks, I don't know
why." And with this new arithmetic her prob
lems really began.
"Thanks for all your trouble," we said as we
left.
"Oh, that's all right," she replied, "I ain't
got much else to do, nowohw."

nothing but cold air in our domicile refriger
ators, exactly five of our motley number lit
out rather late to a downtown culinary esta
blishment and set about the ordering of a hasty
satiation.
What we ordered first they did not have,
and everybody re-ordered a few times till he
had hit on available stock. Then our efficient
waitress decided she had better write it all
down.
"Let's see," she said, "two milks, two straw
berry shakes, and two coffees."
'"No, no. Three milks, one shake, and
one tea."
She made her corrections. "How do you
spell 'hamburger'?" she asked, and we for
tunately had that information right at hand.
"What does the menu say the price of chicken
sandwich is?" she asked. And so on.
At long last she seemed to feel satisfied and
went away. But presently she was back. "We
ain't got but two pieces of apple pie."
"That's all right, we'll take two apple and

the rest berry, one of the apple a la mode and
got much else to do, nowhow."
She promptly brought two plain apples and
two plain berries. "One of each a la mode,"
the directions were patiently repeated. So
she left both berry pieces on the table and took
the two apple pieces back. A long time af
terward, however, she managd to get straight
ened out, and went to turn our main order in
to the chef.
Twenty minutes later we were wondering
why it took so long to cook such short orders,
when the restless gaze of him opposite chanced
to fall upon the end of the counter, and 10, there
was our waitress, still figuring out our orders.
She came back and said, "I cain't quite make
out my own writing here," and we deciphered
it all and made many corrections.
When we were finally served, our waitress
came over and remarked, "The boss says to
put this all on separate checks, I don't know
why." And with this new arithmetic her prob
lems really began.
"Thanks for all your trouble," we said as we
left.
"Oh, that's all right," she replied, "I ain't
got much else to do, nowohw."
And so the other evening, there being
nothing but cold air in our domicile refriger
ators, exactly five of our motley number lit
