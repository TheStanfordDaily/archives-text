The Editor, Sir:
Recently many professors have complained
because of the increasing number of infractions
of the Honor Code. Many of these professors
have even pohibited the taking of examinations
outside of the class room. Naturally, we do not
want to see infractions of our Honor Code, and
we wish to co-operate with all efforts to pre
vent these infractions. However, we feel that
there is a need for an understanding of the cause
of the violations rather than a mere imposition
of rules, which, while they do prevent break
ing of the Honor Code, do not leave us with
the original idea of the code.
What we consider to be one of the main !
causes of violations is the application of the
Honor Code to irrelevant items. The intent of
the originators of the Code was that it should
apply only to scholastic matters.
The following is a quotation from the Fresh
man Handbook and defines the Honor Code:
"The Honor Code is an undertaking of the stu
dents, individually and collectively, that they
will not give or receive aid in examinations !
. . . or in any other work that is to be used
by the instructor as the basis of grading; that
they will not violate the rules of the library . . . i
and that they will do their share ... in seeing
to it that others . . . obey . . . the Honor Code." I
These words define the Honor Code defi-1
nitely as something applicable only to scho
lastic affairs. We do not, however, object to
the enlargement of its scope to include social
regulations. That seems very appropriate to
us. What we do object to, though, is its appli
cation to things which do not concern either
scholarship or social regulations. What we
specifically object to at the moment is the
method of application of the Honor Code to the
pledges made by women to do war work. It
is not that we do not feel that war work is!
important. If the War Board feels that, accord- j
ing to the constitution of the Honor Code, they
deserve the use of it, we do not object, but we
feel that it is an insult to the Code to suggest
following up the use of it with a system resem-1
bling proctoring in examinations. It is for this,
reason that we deeply resent the intention of j
the War Board to keep a record of the hours
spent by women who have pledged their time
on the Honor Code.
It is our contention, then, that the reason
for the greater number of violations of the
Honor Code is the increasing application of it ,
to things for which it was not originally in
tended. We feel that this causes a decrease of
significance and a consequent increase of vio
lations.
