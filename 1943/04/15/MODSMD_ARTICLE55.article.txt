# 'Air Forces' Shows Good Action Shots

AIR FORCE—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Kept out of the category of just
another war picture by a profusion
of fairly good action shots, Air Force
proves an entertaining, but uneven
movie.
The picture, directed by Howard
Hawks, brings Pearl Harbor, Wake
Island .President Roosevelt's address
to Congress, and the rest of the first
month of war back to the public
for the too-manyeth time. Of course
it's quite an accomplishment to get
all that in one picture, but it is ac
complished by the device of follow
ing a Flying Fortress, the Mary-Ann,
from San Francisco to Pearl Harbor,
and all points east. That of course
is the plot.
The action is passable, but not
outstanding, with the possible ex
ception of Harry Cary as Sergeant
White. There are practically no
women in the picture.
The photography was better than
average, as is all the work of James
Wong Howe, and the settings in the
action scenes were not as fake as
usually is the case.
Regardless of its faults, Air Force
is a good action picture, but that's
all. Also featured is a Donald Duck
and a Pete Smith Specialty.—Gugel
