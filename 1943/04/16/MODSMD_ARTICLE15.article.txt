# SING FEST
## Cardinals Sets May 15 Date 
### 
The annual all-student Sing Fest
will be held May .15 in the Frost
Amphitheater, it was announced
! yesterday by Vic Ferrari, Cardinals
member who is general chairman
for the event.
Sign-up lists on which the living
i groups post the songs they choose
will be in the A.S.S.U. office today.
I Signups will close April 28 and selec
tion for songs will be on the '"first
come, first serve" basis, according to
the l ules released by Cardinals, who
are sponsoring the Sing Fest.
Groups participating must consist
of a tleast 15 members. Freshmen
will be allowed to sing with their
affiliated groups, but freshmen wom
i en must sing with their present liv
ing groups, according to Ferrari.
"It is hoped that living groups
participating will select songs which
will appeal to a large mixed group
i rather than house songs. This is a
I request, though, and not a strict
regulation," said Ferrari.
Cardinals hopes that more men's
groups will be entered this year to
give a more balanced program.
