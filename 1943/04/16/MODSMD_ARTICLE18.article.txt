Stanford students in the Radio Workshop are presenting a series of 15-
minute plays over KQW every Saturday afternoon at 3:45.
The plays are written, acted and transcribed in the Radio Workshop in
the Memorial Theater and then sent to San Francisco for the broadcasts.
Tomorrow at 3:45, Bob Ashley's play, "Award for Death," will be heard

►■over KQW. Ashley, who left early
| in the month with the E.R.C., has
| written the mystery script with ;tn
interesting twist, according to Pro
| ducer David Sievers.
Playing the leading roles in Ash-
I ley's play are Louis Fleming, Jack
Coy, and Natalie Towle who imitates
a cat meowing. Peggy Fitts and .lean
Levinson will handle the sound ef
fects.
Already the members of last
week's cast have received fanmail,
I forwarded to them by the KQW San
Francisco office.
The play given last week was writ
ten by Janet Tillson and called
"Pettypoint Purse." According to
Sievers, it was a tense war drama.
Acting in the play were Coy and
Blossom Parke. Georgiann Barrett
handled the sound effects.
A week from tomorrow a play by
Jean Levinson will be produced.
Jimmy Walters is the technical
engineer who supervises the control
room during the recording, and Siev
ers directs the production class who
act in the plays.
Although so far the scripts have
been written in the radio script
writing class, Sievers said that other
scripts from Stanford students would
be welcomed.
