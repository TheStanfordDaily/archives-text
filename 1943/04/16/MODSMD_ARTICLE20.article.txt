# Stanford Defense Plan Is Changed
## 
### 
Plans for civilian defense of the j
Stanford campus are being revamped |
to cover the places formerly held by
members of the R.0.T.C., and until
the new arrangements have been |
completed, no defense drills will be
held, Alfred Masters, civilian defense j
coordinator, announced yesterday.
The next drill has tentatively been
scheduled for May. The 80 D.O.T.C.
men who remain on campus prob
ably will be Centered in one spot and
will be able to cover the campus as
well as the larger group, Masters
said.
