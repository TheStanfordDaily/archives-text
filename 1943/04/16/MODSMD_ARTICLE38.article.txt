## Cashin To Swim 220 Freestyle At Cal Saturday 
### Late Williams 
Coach Ernie Brandsten, hoping to
I bolster the Stanford swimming
| team's chances of a win over the
University of California tomorrow,
! announced that he intended to enter
; Emmett Cashin in the 220-yard free
style event.
Cashin has been working this dis
j tance in practice in good time, and
' Brandsten believes that his ace
breaststroker has a better than even
chance to cop the event. Cashin's
entry in this race will be added on to
performances in his 200-yard breast
; stroke specialty, and a leg in the
| final event of the meet, the 400-yard
| relay.
Brandsten has chosen to alter his
! usual 300-yard medley relay team of
Bob Mapel, Cashin, and Hank Sal
| tonstall to one composed of A 1
Weeden, No. 1 backstroke artist Sal
| tonstall, and either Bill Mapel or
j Bordan Ferrar.
With the return of Weeden. who
j has been hospitalized for three
i weeks, the swimming squad appears
to be in its best condition since the
| season started. Even with this the
case, Brandsten is making no rash
I statements about the outcome of the
| Indian-Bear meet other than, "I fig
[ ure that we should win by five or
| six points." In the same breath, how
| ever, he added, "That is, unless
California comes up with an un
j known 'dark horse'."
Whereas last year the two uni
{ versities competed in swimming with
both varsity and freshman teams be
ing represented, this year, as has
happened in many sport activities,
| the frosh are now allowed to com
pete on the varsity squad, and con
sequently there will be only one
meet.
Also different from last year's meet
:is the reversal of Stanford strength
—not in power, but in the positions
that the power lies. In the 1942 sea
son, the Indians' strength centered
around the freestyle events, and had
a definite weakness in the back
stroke and breaststroke.
This year the three events are re
versed with Cashin and Weeden
presenting one of the strongest, if
not the strongest, combination on
the Coast. Cashin, himself, would
give the Cards five points in any
swimming meet in the country.
The Stanford lineup for the meet
is as follows:
300-yard medley relay—Weeden,
j Saltonstall, B. Mapel or Ferrar.
220-yard freestyle — Cashin and
Livingston or Bell or Dudley.
50-yard freestyle—Smith and W.
I Mapel.
Diving—Marquette and Williams.
100-yard freestyle—W. Mapel and
| Smith.
150-yard backstroke — R. Mapel
{ and Weeden.
200-yard breaststroke — Cashin
| and Carpenter.
440-yard freestyle — Livingston
and Bell.
400-yard relay—Smith, W. Mapel.
Cashin. and Saltonstall.


EMM K I T CASIIIN. above, Stanford's N.C.A.A. hreaststroke champion
and 200-yard world record holder, will lead (he Indian mermen against
California tomorrow afternoon at Berkeley. Cashin is slated to try for
the pool record for the 100-yard hreaststroke.
