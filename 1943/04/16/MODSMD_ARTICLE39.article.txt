# HANDICAP MEET
## Intrasquad Battle Tomorrow Should Produce Close Races 
### 
There won't be any outside stars
entered, but the intrasquad track
meet scheduled for tomorrow after
noon o". Angell Field should pro
vide some of the closest cinder con
tests seen around here this year.
The meet is a handicap affair, with
handicaps arranged by Pitch John
son on the basis of performances in
meets and practice this season. The
squad has been divided into two
teams, Reds and Whites.
Johnson's ace quarter-miler, John
ny Fulton, will lead the Red aggre
gation, competing in both the 100
;.nd 880. In the century, Johnny has
to give away two yards to Whites
Bob Fess and Bob Carr, two yards
to Red Bill Quackenbush, and five
yards to Red Warren Cathcart.
In the 880 Fulton is at an even
greater disadvantage, spotting
Whites Wayne Girdner (12 yards),
Bernie Wagner (25 yards), and
teammates Bill Eberle (35 yards),
and Suttie (50 yards).
With Fulton out of it, the 440
looms as the closest race on the pro
gram. Dud Cramer, Gil Reiss, and
Glen Holtby, the first two on the
Red squad, will start from scratch.
Floyd Cuff of the Reds has a four
yard advantage, and Jim Chamber-
Jain, also a Red, six yards.
According to Johnson, the best
field event should be the high jump,
where Red Willard Smith will be
giving away inches to five other
jumpers. Red Bob Zaleska gets two
inches, Red George Jones three,
Whites Don Landale and Ed Luce
three, and White Jack Millar four.
