ALLIED HQ., North Africa, April
15 (UP). —The British First Army
was reported within 26 miles of
Tunis tonight, while the Eighth
I Army struck at the enemy's En
: fidaville line 50 miles below the Tu
nisian capital, and French troops
| drove a wedge into the center of
[ the Axis defense arc.
Regaining all territory lost to the
| limited Axis offensive in March,
; First Army troops last night cap
tured the village of Heidous, only
j 26 miles due west of Tunis after
| cleaning up the hills farther west
j and northwest.
The First Army now is only 14
! miles from embattled Tebourba
where the Allies' autumn drive on
Tunis faltered and was thrown back.
Although the Allies were slowly j
: but surely forcing upon the Axis
I armies the choice of a hazardous sea
escape attempt, surrender or death, I
military authorities warned that j
' hard fighting lay ahead in the hills j
| of the Tunisian corner where the
i enemy is deeply and strongly em- ,
S placed.
Despite the new First Army ad- I
vance, reaching a point six miles
due north of Medjez-El-Bab, Ger
man forces still held out to the
northwest in hill positions which i
must be reduced before a general
attack on Tunis can be opened.
