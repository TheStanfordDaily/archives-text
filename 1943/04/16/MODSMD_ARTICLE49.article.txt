# Stanford To Play Santa Clara Tomorrow on Sunken Diamond
## 
### 
Stanford's amazing baseball nine resumes its schedule against the Santa
Clara Broncs tomorrow afternoon at 3 p.m. in the Sunken Diamond. The
team from the mission city is the only team that the Reds have been able
to defeat in league competition so far this season and the boys will be out
for a repeat performance.
Coach Harry Wolter is uncertain as to his starting pitcher, but either

Bernard Woody or Jack Miller, both
of whom saw service against the
Broncs last Wednesday, will prob
ably get the call.
The rest of the lineup is fairly set
with the only possible change being
right field, where three men are vie
ing for the starting berth. Bill Cun
ha, Jack Wakefield, and Kdith Pinion
j are all showing great promise.
The infield will undoubtedly re
| main the same that played against
] Santa Clara before. Dallmar at first,
Elliot nt second, Brown at short, and
McKie at the hot corner. Ward
Walkup, behind the plate, will com-
I plete the roster.
The Missions should send either
Buzz Meagher or Dick Smith to the
j hill to oppose the improved Card
I baiters, with the rest of their lineup
remaining the same. They are sorely
hurt by the loss of both Jess Frietas
and Bill Mullins, both of whom were
hitting at a nice clip.
All indications seem to point to a
Stanford victory if the fine pitching,
fielding, and base running continues
as it did earlier in the week. The
players are in a fine frame of mind
for the game and a victory now
would put us back in the race for
; the crown.
