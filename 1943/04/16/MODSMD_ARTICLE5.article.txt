minutes of the morning session and
then the first 45 minutes of the after

latter portions of these two sessions
will not be held against the candi

to take the whole examination.
Those in the pre-medical classi

as any others who are uncertain as
to their situation should come to the

Above all things, candidates should
be prompt, Dr. Cowdery added, in
asmuch as there are definite time
