### 
DALLAS, Tex., April 15 (U.R) —
Private Ben Hogan, who has won
more money playing golf than any
other professional in the game for
the past three seasons and is now
working for Uncle Sam at $50 a
month, will return to the links to
morrow in what probably will be his
final tournament until the war is
over.
Private Hogan hasn't played five
games of golf in the past five months
but his followers still are counting on
him to finish near the top in the
Texsa Victory Open which will be
played tomorrow and Saturday at
the Dallas Country Club.
Who wins is a relatively minor
point at this unusual tournament.
For the first time in the history of
the Texas Open, the game of golf is
a secondary consideration. Emphasis
this year is on raising money to fight
the war.
