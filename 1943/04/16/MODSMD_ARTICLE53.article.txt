# Card Netters Face Cal Here Tomorrow
## 
### 
A potentially strong Farm tennis squad meets the California Bears for
the second time this year on the varsity courts tomorrow at 2 p.m. The
Cal aggregation must be given a slight edge although Coach Elwyn Bugge
states that he expects to see a very close match.
At the present time the lineup is indefinite as Bugge is unable to decide

upon his first man. Both Charles*
Hutchison and Dick Thomas are
showing up well in practice and the j
choice as to whom is to be in the ini
tial match is not known. Ted Myers
will play No. 3, followed by Bob j
Forbes in four and Terry Mullin and !
Zook Sutton in five and six respec- ;
tively.
The doubles teams will line up with
Hutchison and Paul Wilson in either ;
the first or second spot with Thomas
and Myers following them. Forbes i
and Jim Reading will play the third
match.
Not much information has been
received on California's lineup, but
one thing is certain—Tom Brown
will play first singles. He will prob
ably be followed by George Spencer j
and Harry Buttimer. The loss of
George Gish to the armed forces has
disrupted the remainder of the roster
and it is difficult to say who will
compete. The most likely choices i
are Ellis Slack and Jim Livingston.
Brown and Buttimer will lead ofl'
for the Bears in doubles, followed by
Spencer and Slack. Van Doren and
Livingstone are slated to play in the
last spot.
Although Stanford must be rated
a decided underdog, it is possible, i
should the Indians play their best
tennis of the year, that the Farm will
be returned winner.
Cal is sure of winning the first ;
singles match, but Hutchison is cap
able of beating Spencer, and Myers
of giving Buttimer a close match. !
The fourth, fifth, and sixth matches j
are fairly even; Cal should win the
first doubles, and the second and
third contests are tossups.

tennis of the year, that the Farm will
be returned winner.
Cal is sure of winning the first ;
singles match, but Hutchison is cap
able of beating Spencer, and Myers
of giving Buttimer a close match. !
The fourth, fifth, and sixth matches j
are fairly even; Cal should win the
first doubles, and the second and
third contests are tossups.
