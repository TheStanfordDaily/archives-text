# Indian Crew Races Bruins
## 
### 
"The best Stanford crew since the
sport was revived in 1939," is just
now pulling into Los Angeles, and
will work out this afternoon over
the Bologna Creek course in prep
aration for tomorrow's all-important
race against U.C.L.A.
Coach Carl Pedersen. Mrs. Peder
sen, 18 men, and girl cox Ann Ash
ley made the trip, and all are confi
dent the Indians will come out 02'
top against the Bruins.
The squad, in the opinion of many
on campus, has shown more spirit
and determination this quarter than
any other Card aggregation, and will
undoubtedly be fired up for Satur
day's mile and a quarter pull.
In Stanford's only other crew race
this year, thelndians lost out by
four feet to Ky Ebright's California
Bears. According to Pedersen. the
Cards would have won had they
gotten in an extra stroke at the
finish. Weeks of practice since that
time have probably worked out all
stroke difficulties.
Rowing in Stanford's varsity boat
are 1. Bud Clary; 2, Ken Young; 3,
Bub Hampton; 4, Welko Gasich; 5,
Burt Avery; 6. Tony Medved; 7, Ned
Gates; stroke, Paul Schute; cov, Walt
Drake.
The squad is staying at U.C.L.A.
fraternity houses while down South.
Miss Ashley is staying at the Alpha
Phi sorority house.
