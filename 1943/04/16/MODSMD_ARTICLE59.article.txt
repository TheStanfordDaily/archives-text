OUR congratulations to you, Janet McClan
ahan.
Yesterday Janet won a double honor. For
she was not only elected president of the stu
dent body, but she is the first woman to hold
this high position in all the fifty-odd years of
Stanford's history.
Of all the women on the campus eligible
to run for the presidency, under the recently
passed amendment, no one is more suited to
carry on the heavy duties of a wartime presi
dent than she is. As vice-president serving
as president for several weeks, she has become
acquainted with the demands and authority of
the office. She has a great quality of leader
ship, quiet competence. She is efficient, yet not
officious. She is an ideal person to represent
the student body of Stanford University.
With her ideal personality to back her up,
Janet can successfully govern the student body.
And we feel sure that Stanford can well be
proud of its first woman president.â€”Jane Glas
son.
