The Editor, Sir:
The War Board feels that there has been a
misunderstanding about its use of the phrase
"On an Honor Code basis" when it asked Stan
ford women to sign up for eight hours of war
work a month.
We could not and would not have any way
of checking up on all women students to see
that they do what they signed up for. We
have no intention of "proctoring" such work.
All that we asked was that women could pledge
their hours in the "spirit" of the Honor Code
knowing that this was the thing at Stanford
which gave all students their position as mature
and responsible people.
We did not force anyone to pledge—we only
asked that each person see the need and try to
meet these extracurricular and vital demands on
their free time. Anyone who doesn't feel she
can give her time to such work, may change her
card in our office at any time or need not pledge
until she feels that she can. However, once
having given her word, every student should
feel the seriousness of carrying out her inten
tions. We have to keep a list of the pledge cards
in the office merely as a mechanical record in
any office, and we only do this in order to fill
in vacancies when work has to be done and
no one shows up.
This is our only way of knowing what good

we're actually doing with this plan—and, if, !
over a period of time, we're failing, then we'll
know it and try something else. Professors keep
records of grades in the same way we keep
this record, and we could not use the Honor
Cade as a penalizing code.
We hope this will clear up any misunder
standing of our objectives or our intentions in
presenting this plan.—Betty May Hale.

The Editor, Sir:
There are three points I would like to make
in reply to "Amazed" and the letter about the
eight-hour war work and the Honor Code. In
the first place, what do you think the Honor
Code stands for? As an educational institution,
Stanford naturally considers the Honor Code
most important as regards scholastic matters,
but its broader purpose is to build in each of
the students an Honor Code of his own, which
will hold him to more than just not cheating
in examinations- The implication I see in the
objection to putting other activities on an Honor
Code basis, is that those who object consider
it a hindrance, and that without it, they would
be ftee to do the right thing or the wrong as
it happened to suit them at the moment. Else
why should the Honor Code be considered
"wasted" because it has been applied to other
than scholastic affairs?
Secondly, the letter was so ill-advised as to
refer to the -eight-hour war work as a "frivolity,"
a "whim," and "just any old thing." Do you
have to be told again that this is total war? And
if the students don't realize it and help of their
own accord (Honor), when an external Honor
Code must be imposed upon them. Some stu
dents seem very indignant about the fact that
they are mistrusted to such an extent that an
Honor Code is necessary, but without it, their
own Honor Code doesn't seem to function.
Thirdly, I don't see the connection between
the scope of the Honor Code and the number
of violations against it, because, as I have said,
I don't think that a broader application should
"decrease (its) significance," and certainly it
does not change the nature of the Honor Code
to apply it to more fields of activity.

The Editor, Sir:
In regard to the letter in Campus Opinion,
April 13, signed "Revolting," I would like to
explain the lack of a Back to the Farm Day
and Gay 'Nineties Dance.
By the time that I was appointed chairman of
the Convalescent Home Drive this quarter, many
dates were already filled in the social calendar.
The week of May 17-21 was the best for our
purposes and we were given it by Excom.
However, the Friday and Saturday nights be
fore the week, on one of which nights the Soph
Carnival is usually given, were closed for the
Spring Show. Similarly, Saturday, May 22, was
a closed date for the freshman dance.
This left two affairs —the Soph Carnival and
the Gay 'Nineties Dance—for Friday, May 21.
Since only one could be given, we took these
facts into consideration: (1) last year the Soph
Carnival made 5581.38, the dance, 5144.66, for
the Home; (2) both Graham Barbey, '41 chair
man, and Joe Messina, '42 chairman, advised
against Back to the Farm Day and the dance in
their official reports; (3) the administration has
declared itself against Back to the Farm Day
this year, thereby squelching half of the affair.
In view of these facts, we dropped the Gay
'Nineties Dance in favor of the Carnival. How
ever, if "Revolting" really wishes the dance, I
suggest that he present the idea to the fresh
man class as the theme for their dance—l would
gladly co-operate.
Thank you so much for your kind and
thoughtful interest. The Drive can only suc
ceed if we give the students the kind of enter
tainment they want. Therefore, I wish that any
one else with constructive criticisms would
please send them to me.
Dick Wilbur
Chairman, Convalescent Home Drive
