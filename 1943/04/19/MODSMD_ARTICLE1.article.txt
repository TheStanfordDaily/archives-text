## 
### (By United Press 
One year after the bombing of
Tokyo one of the most spectacular
incidents of the war, but about which
little has been revealed, a United
Press dispatch from North Africa
Sunday apparently disclosed for the
first time in any authentic manner
that the "Shangri La" from which
the American planes took off to strike
the Nipponese capital was one or
more aircraft carriers.
The information, passed by cen
sors at North African headquarters,
was contained in the first sentence of
a dispatch from UP staff correspon
dent Donald Coe:
'"Eleven of the men who flew
Mitchell bombers from aircraft car
riers to bomb Tokyo with Maj. Gen.
James C. Doolittle—"
That told the story. The rest of
the dispatch concerned speculation
as to whether the 11 fliers, now
at various fields in North Africa
would be able to hold any celebra
tion of the anniversary.
