# RESERVES
## Navy, Marine Test Scheduled 
### 
A qualifying test for all Navy and
Marine Corps Reservists in their
freshman or sophomore year will be
given tomorrow under the direction
of Dr. Karl Cowdery, armed service
representative.
The examination, in the nature of
a screening test, is given to insure
that underclassmen going on with
naval and Marine reserve training
in college have at least the qualifi
cations for further college training,
Marine officials said.
The qualifying program consists
of the written test, which is in the
nature of a general intelligence test,
as well as consideration of the re
servists' general scholastic standing,
aptitude, and recommendations of
the college authorities.
Notices Sent
The time and place of the exam
ination will be announced tomorrow
night in The Daily. Notices have
been sent to the individual reservists
where possible.
Information from Marine head
quarters in Washington said in part:
"Under the old program of re
quiring students to graduate at their
own expense prior to assignment to
the Officer Candidates' Class it is
apparent that successful completion
of their college courses gave strong
indication of their aptitude for offi
cer training.
Aptitude Needed
"With the change to the new Col
lege Training Program, with college
training at the expense of the Gov
ernment. it is felt that aptitude for
i further college training should be
indicated. This is presumed in the
case of those who have attained their
junior college year.
"In view of the Navy qualifying
examination for V-l men completing
their sophomore year it is felt that
certainly a screening examination
should be made of the Marine un
derclassmen, to insure that those
going on into the new program have
at least the qualifications for further
college training. The interests of
the student and the United States
Government have been thoroughly
considered in arranging the exam
ination."
