# 150 Soldiers Move Into Sequoia Hall
## 
### 
One hundred soldiers moved into
Sequoia Hall on Saturday; 50 moi'e
followed them on Sunday. This is
the beginning of the STAR unit
(Student Training Assignment and
Reclassification) at Stanford.
This unit, which according to the
contract with the Army will contain
up to 500 men, will make its head
quarters at Sequoia. If the accom
modations prove too small, some ot
its members will be moved to Bran
ner. However, Chancellor Ray Ly
man Wilbur declared that the Uni
versity would attempt to reserve
Branner Hall for the advanced engi
neering unit which has also been
assigned to Stanford.
Examined Here
The soldiers in the STAR unit will
be sent here from induction centers,
examined, and then, on the basis ot
the examination, reassigned to Spe
cial Training Units at colleges ap
proved by the Army.
The chairman of the examining
board at Stanford will be Dr. J. F.
Mitchell, Registrar, Chancellor Wil
bur announced last week. The boan.
will consist of members from tin
various departments in which tin
soldiers will be examined.
Review Work
In addition to reclassifying the
soldiers, the board may also recom
mend that they be given review
work in some special subject for a
short time in order to enable them
to enter designated sections on an
even basis.
Since some soldiers will be re
classified rapidly while others must
be given review work, the stay of
each individual soldier will vary
from one day to one .month.
Not A.S.S.U. Members
Due to this, the soldiers within the
STAR unit will not be regarded as
members of the Stanford student
body. All social relations with the
soldiers will consequently be car
ried on through the Stanford War
Board.
The soldiers selected for such spe
cialized training units must have
high marks in various Army tests,
and have at least one year and less
than three full years of work at col
lege level.
Engineering Unit
This unit is distinct from the ad
vanced engineering unit which is to
be sent to Stanford. The engineering
unit, the contract for which has al
ready been signed, will be quartered
at Branner Hall.
The engineering unit will be or
ganized and operated under the "ca
det system." Selected trainees will
be appointed commissioned and
noncommissioned officers. Tours of
duty will be rotated to give the maxi
mum number an opportunity to ex
ercise leadership and to demonstrate
their abilities.
Unlike the STAR unit, the engi
neers will be considered to be a part
of the student body.
