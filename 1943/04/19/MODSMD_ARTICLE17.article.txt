## S.F. Symphony Season Closes 
### 
As the mournful strains of a stir
ring performance of Tschaikovsky's
"Pathetic" Symphony died away into
the distance, the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra closed its 31st sea
son last Saturday night in the War
Memorial Opera House.
Featured soloist was the 14-year
old pianist, Leon Fleisher, who
played the gaudy Liszt Concerto in
A ajor. Mr. Fleischer's debut in
his native San Francisco proved a
brilliant success, as he played the
cold and showy concerto with
a marvelous display of tech
nique. It is difficult, however, from
such a work, to judge whether
young Fleisher is a truly great artist
or not.
Conductor Pierre Monteux opened
the concert with the Bach Suite in
D major, followed by Wagner's Pre
lude to Lohengrin. Although nu
merous mistakes were made in the
trumpet part of the Bach Suite, it
was certainly no reflection on the
orchestra as the trumpet part in
that work is almost unplayable.
The concert was concluded with
the Tschaikovsky Sixth Symphony,
and Mr. Monteux's comparatively
conservative interpretation proved a
relief after the usual highly colored
and overly sentimental performances
of the work.
After the close of the concert,
Pierre Monteux was presented with
an American Flag, and in gratitude
for this and the great ovation he re
ceived. led the orchestra in a moving
presentation of Sousa's "Stars and
Stripes Forever."â€”Gugel
