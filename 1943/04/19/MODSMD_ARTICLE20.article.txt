te battle of all swimming battles
jt ween Cal's Stanley Morketter,
id Stanford's Cashin.
Morketter, supposedly the fastest
lort sprint ace on the Coast, closed
gap of about an inch that Cashin

had acquired in Smith's touch. From
there on in it was stroke for stroke,
and yard for yard. Cashin, however,
got in the last kick, and took the
race by about eight inches. That was
the meet.
New Record
Cashin was supposedly out to
break the pool record for the 100-
yard breaststroke, according to pre
meet dope, but ended up by erasing
the 220-yard freestyle mark in 2:13.4.
In this event, Cashin defeated Don
Beanston, who was considered the
best of the 220-men from Washing
ton to Los Angeles.
Coach Ernie Brandsten. who was
perhaps the happiest man of the 400
enthusiasts in attendance, said that
all of the Stanford performers should
be given equal credit for the victory.
He particularly stressed the names
of A1 Weeden, who was hospitalized
for three weeks and came back to
take a close second behind teammate
Mapel in the 150-yard backstroke,
and Don Smith who swam faster than
he had ever done in his life in his
leg of the relay, and the 100-yard
freestyle. To single out outstanding
performers, with the exception of
Cashin, is impossible. Every man did
his job well.
