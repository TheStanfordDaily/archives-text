SPRING has come. The arrival of the swallows
placed the final period at the end of that
sentence. Spring has come.
Before that we all knew that Spring had
come. The ivy had new leaves, young and
tender and bright green. The wisteria had come
to life with its long, graceful, hanging flowers of
lavender, and its soft scent. We all knew that
Spring was here, but it was not guite all here.
The swallows that come and wheel effort
lessly in the sky and build their mud houses
under the tile eaves of the Quad, the swallows
that mark Spring's arrival are here. Spring is
here.
It is not news that is screamed forth in block
headlines and yet it happens. With each rising
and setting of the sun Spring becomes more a
part of us.
Here it means warmth and sun, good smells
in the air, a general easy feeling, and tolerance
and love of life. We suppose that Spring, what
it brings with it in the good feelings; what it
symbolizes in hope for the future, we suppose
that these are part of our war aims.
Now, the friendliness of Spring is something
peculiar to America. The melting of the snows
in the midwest soften the ground for the farmers
to plant their corn; the Chinooks off Oregon are
the forerunners of the salmon.
Spring is love of life. It is the time for hard,
honest, soul satisfying work. It is the cleanser
that gives men faith to live.
Yet these beauties of this Spring are to be
found only in the United States. In Russia the
melting of the snows bares scars of struggle;
brings forth the new threat of German invasion.
The ground will soon become firm enough to
support the tank treads.
The good weather will bring bombers over
England and Germany, and Europe and the
World. The calm seas will aid the U-boats in
their relentless raids on commerce.
With the awakening of the trees and the
flowers this Spring, comes an awakening of
Hate and Fear and Death.
In peace Spring is soft, feminine, and gentle.
In war it is cruel, harsh, and hateful.
Spring is here.
