# To the Soldiers
## 
### 
WE are glad to have you here. You are the
first of many soldiers who will come to
Stanford. Individually you will probably not
be here very long, but while you are here we
would like to make your stay as pleasant as
possible.
Perhaps the best thing would be to give
you some idea of what there is that you and
your friends can do.
I.—As some of yc found out 'last night,

we have 16-millemeter movies every Sunday
in the Memorial Auditorium. Admission is 20
cents and the pictures are usually good although
they are old.
2. —Every Sunday services are held in the
Chapel. Next Sunday, Easter, there will be a
sunrise service in the Amphitheater as well as
a regular service in the Church.
3. On Saturday afternoons and sometimes
during the week there are sports events here.
All of these will be announced in The Daily, and
you are invited to attend.
4.—Occasionally there are plays and con
certs given in the theater. One is ending its
run tonight. There will be another play put on
this quarter.
s.—The Stanford Museum is always open.
In it they have preserved a replica of the break
fast Leland Stanford Jr. ordered on the morning
he died. It is unusual.
6. —Every Tuesday evening there are lec
tures or programs in the Memorial Auditorium
which are called the Tuesday Series. This Tues
day there will be a program by a pianist.
7.—ln some cases there are lectures in the
afternoons which, if you are free, you might
like to attend. Announcements of these will be
carried in The Daily.
8. There are religious groups on campus,
and they will be glad to have you join them if
you are interested.
9.—Lake Lagunita is open every afternoon
from 1 to 5 to swimmers.
As soon as they can be organized there will
be guide tours about the campus, and probably
dances every Saturday night. You are the first
soldiers we have had on the campus and so,
while we welcome you wholeheartedly, we
don't as yet quite know how to show it.—Lucile
