The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Campus has gone to war.
Stanford students are preparing themselves for
one of the greatest struggles youth has ever
faced, and rightly so. But, are we here not pre
paring ourselves to be the leaders of the world
of tomorrow? Is not the destny of the world in
our hands? How many students are thinking of
living longer than Hitler, Mussolini, or Hirohito?
A few students, a maximum of 60, have been
meeting in Lagunita Court every Sunday after
noon for the past two guarters and discussing
economic, cultural, political, social, and scien
tific problems and predictions that will arise in
our lives as a result of this world conflict. This
organization, the Student-Faculty Forum, has
had such notables as Dr. Allen, Professor Rath
bun, Dr. Savelle, Dr. Lynn T. White Jr., and many
others. The guestions discussed in these meet
ings, open to all students and faculty members,
are vital to every person who refuses to accept
fascism or any other militant form of govern
ment. Some of the meetings have been small,
but the value of the material presented by the
speaker and brought out in discussions has
been invaluable to both the faculty members
and students present.
The Student-Faculty Forum has been grow
ing in importance ever since it started; it repre
sents Stanford's answer to the challenge made
to our democracy!

It seems the old adage "April breezes bring
May sneezes" is at work right now.
I would like to ask the students who come
into the Cubberley Library with boxes of tissue,
to put the discarded tissues in the waste paper
containers instead of dropping wads of them
on the floor or under the tables and chairs. It
' it very unpleasant, as well as unsanitary, to
i have dozens of used tissues scattered around the
room. In this library there are numerous waste
paper boxes. Please use them!

The Editor, Sir:
It seems the old adage "April breezes bring
May sneezes" is at work right now.
I would like to ask the students who come
into the Cubberley Library with boxes of tissue,
to put the discarded tissues in the waste paper
containers instead of dropping wads of them
on the floor or under the tables and chairs. It
' it very unpleasant, as well as unsanitary, to
i have dozens of used tissues scattered around the
room. In this library there are numerous waste
paper boxes. Please use them!
