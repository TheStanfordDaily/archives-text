Science and Post War Living" at the
weekly meeting of the Student Fac

The theme of his informal talk was
the place which the modern inno

war aims will play in the peace to
follow the war.
The talk was followed by a gen
eral discussion of specific inventions
| produced by the war and their pos
i sible uses after the armistice.

The more dollars you invest in ;
War Bonds, the more bombs will j
rain on the Axis.
