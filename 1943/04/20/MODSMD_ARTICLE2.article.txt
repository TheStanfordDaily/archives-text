## Army Plans to Add 500 More 
### 
Negotiations are being carried on
now with the Army to double the
size of the STAR unit at Stanford,
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur an-
nounced today. The present maxi-
mum of the unit is 500 soldier's.
In addition to using Sequoia Hall,
as is done at the present, if the pro-
posed contract is accepted the STARS
will also be housed in Branner Hall
and perhaps in Toyon.
Clay Stage Still
The STAR unit is under the com
mand of Col. Harry B. Allen, as will
be every Army unit stationed at
Stanford. The immediate com-
mander of the STAR unit is Col.
John Madden. Captain Trippe is in .
command of those members of the
unit in Sequoia.
According to Dr. J. P. Mitchell,
chairman of the committee handling
the STAR unit, the procedure is in
the ''clay stage. We don't have all
the information we need yet so we
haven't quite gotten it straightened
out, but we'll have it running in a
little while."
Stanford is one of the three col-
leges in the United States which
have been selected by the Army to
handle STAR units.
No Dance Friday
Betty Mae Hale, War Board Co
ordinator, declared that the War
Board was doing what it could to
help the soldiers. "Magazines and
Dailies are being sent to them. Their
radio has broken down, but we think
that the Y.W.C.A. will lend their
radio to the soldiers temporarily.
'"There can be no dance this Fri-
day because it is Good Friday. Ar-
rangements may be made, however,
to admit the soldiers to the Lagu-
nita-Union Formal on Saturday,"
she continued.
"We are planning to have a guide
tour around the campus for them
shortly and Interfaith Council is
making a list of the churches in the
vicinity and the times of the services
for their use."

No Dance Friday
Betty Mae Hale, War Board Co
ordinator, declared that the War
Board was doing what it could to
help the soldiers. "Magazines and
Dailies are being sent to them. Their
radio has broken down, but we think
that the Y.W.C.A. will lend their
radio to the soldiers temporarily.
'"There can be no dance this Fri-
day because it is Good Friday. Ar-
rangements may be made, however,
to admit the soldiers to the Lagu-
nita-Union Formal on Saturday,"
she continued.
"We are planning to have a guide
tour around the campus for them
shortly and Interfaith Council is
making a list of the churches in the
vicinity and the times of the services
for their use."
