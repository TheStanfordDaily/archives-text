# Stanford Athletes
## 
### 
WHAT is an athlete? Is he someone with large biceps, broad
shoulders, and thin hips? Someone who can run the hurdles
in record time or hit a baseball over the right field fence?
No, an athlete is a way of thinking. One who believes and
thinks and hopes his sport. He differs from the rest of us in that
he has an all-consuming desire to excel in his field.
In the past few days we have had two outstanding examples
of true Stanford athletes in action. One is the swimming team,
which because of its spirit beat Cal. They wanted to beat Cal
and because they wanted to beat Cal badly enough they did.
The other example of true athletes is the crew. They have
lived crew all this quarter, getting up at five in the morning and
rowing on an empty stomach. They paid their own way to Los
Angeles to row against U.C.L.A. They wanted to beat the Bruins
with all their hearts, but a poor start and the catching of a crab
was too much. Although their hearts were not quite enough to
make them win, they, like the swimming team, proved them
selves to be true athletes.
