# A 						Second Stalingrad

EVERYDAY now the cry for a "second Dunkirk" comes from
all sides. It is easy to conjure up a vision of the Afrika Korps
being pushed into the sea in Tunisia, and Africa being freed from
the Axis.
It is too easy to think of this. We should temper this pleasant
vision with the grim memory of Stalingrad. It is far from an un
pleasant possibility that the Germans can hold out forever in the
•naturally fortified region around Tunis, and repulse the desert
•"ighters of the British Eighth. Africa has yet to be won with
planes, and tanks, and men.
