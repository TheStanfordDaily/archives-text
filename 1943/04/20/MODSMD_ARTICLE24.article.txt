# Something New
## 
### 
THE Army's coming to Stanford will present something en
tirely new to the student body of the University. In the past
we have wishingly called ourselves a democracy, now is our
opportunity to prove our idle claims.
Now is an opportunity to pick up the soldiers when they are
walking to Paly, although in the past you have never done so.
Now is a opportunity to talk to them and to make them feel at |
home while here at Stanford.
Their time at Stanford is short. It is for us, the men and
women of Stanford to make them enjoy and be fond of our !
University.
