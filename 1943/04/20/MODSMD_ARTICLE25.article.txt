The Editor, Sir:
It's about time that the University cooperates with Mr. Wil
liam Jeffers of the Office of Rubber Director by eliminating cer
tain unnecessary automobile traffic controls. I would like to sug
gest that the Administration consider the removal of most all of
the campus stop-signs, such as those needless ones at the wide
open intersection of Escondido road and Galvez street.
It would result in more efficient use of what rubber remains
on the tires of student and faculty cars. And it would not be a
hazard, because the drivers are already restricted by the 20- and
25-mile speed limits and the poor condition of many of the cam
pus road pavements.
If anything, we need some sort of control on our dangerously
erratic bicycle riders!â€”V.W.S.
The Editor, Sir:
Last week an editorial in The Daily advocated limiting the
application of the Honor Code to specific cases. The Honor Code
doesn't apply to just scholastic work, it is an attitude which ought
to apply to everything that a Stanford student does.
As soon as a student says, "I'm not going to apply the Honor
Code here," it is the same as if he said, "I'm going to cheat here."
The Honor Code is a pretty good institution. It makes life
happier for students while they are in college and it is something
ior them to be proud of when they get out. It should be retained
and it should be retained for everything. Betty Mae Hale
