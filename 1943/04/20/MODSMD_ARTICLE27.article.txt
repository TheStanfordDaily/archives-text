THE KEEPER OF THE FLAME.
now playing at the Stanford
Theater.
Starring the dynamic combination
of Katherine Hepburn and Spencer
Tracy, "The Keeper of the Flame"
turns out to be another successful
drama for these two. Steven O'Mal
ley, a foreign correspondent, played
by Tracy, returns to America just
in time to attend the funeral of
Robert Forrest, a great American
hero.
Because he was a great hero,
O'Malley determines to write the
story of Forrest's life, but when he
starts to probe for information, he
finds both the man's life and death
shrouded in mystery. The uncoop
erative spirit of Forrest's wife, played
by Miss Hepburn, to contribute in
formation to her husband's would
be biographer, makes O'Malley even
more curious.
The story is built up by suspense
and the presense of many unusual
characters. And not only is the act
ing of Miss Hepburn and Tracy out
standing, but they are supported by
an excellent cast. The picture lives
up to the publicity it has received
with the exception of the ending,
which was rather weak after sitting
through the great scenes of suspense
and mystery. The plot is possible,
but not probable, for it tends too
much toward the idealistic.
In the opinion of the reviewer,
Tracy turns in a much better per
formance than Miss Hepburn, which
is an unusual feature. Excellent
photography is another outstanding
characteristic of the picture, and it
is this photography which makes the
feeling which surrounds the picture
possible.
