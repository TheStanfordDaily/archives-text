## Morgan Speaks On Culbertson Post-War Plan 
### 
Dr. Bayard Q. Morgan of the Ger
man department led the discussion
at the meeting of the World Affairs
group of the Y.W.C.A. yesterday at
4:15 p.m. in the "Y" rooms, top floor
of the Women's Clubhouse. Dr.
Morgan spoke on the Culbertson
Plan.
"Isolationism is from now on a
thing of the past,'' said Dr. Morgan,
"because the advancement of tech
nology has eliminated the ocean as a
barrier against attack, the economic
interdependence of nations makes
self sufficiency almost impossible,
and because, after Pearl Harbor, we
cannot sit behind a wall of inter
national good will."
The three alternatives of the plan,
as stated by Dr. Morgan, are to build
up military power through arma
ments, to return to the old balance
of power idea, or to surrender to
slavery.
These alternative are outlawed,
according to Dr. Morgan, because
"No single nation could have hoped
to meet 80.000 Germans and win."
The second alternative has never
worked in the past, he continued, and
the third is really no alternative at
all.
"The world is now, coming of age.
Schoolboys fight each other with
fists, but grown people do not resort
very much to physical violence,"
said Dr. Morgan. It seems to be
time for nations to grow up too as
it is no longer feasible for grown
nations to strike one another."
Dr. Morgan concluded his discus
sion with the provisions for inter
national relationships after the war
as specified in the Culbertson Plan.
During the question period after
the discussion, Dr. Morgan an
nounced that he had several copies
of the Culbertson Plan which he
would lend to interested students.
This was the second in the series
of informal discussions being given
this quarter on post-war planning.
Further groups will feature Dr.
Graham Stuart of the political sci
ence department speaking on South
America; Dr. Irwin Abrams of the
history department on the activities
of the Quakers; Dr. Shau Chan of
the department of humanities on
China; and Dr. Harold Fisher of the
history department on Russia.
These meetings count as one war
hour per week, according to Dodie
Crile, chairman of the "Y" group.
