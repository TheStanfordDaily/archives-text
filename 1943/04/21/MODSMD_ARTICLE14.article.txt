# Aircobras Dive, Date Farm Co-eds
## 
### 
Leave it to the Stanford woman
to make the best of the man shortage
on campus. If the male element is
not to be found tramping the Quad
this sunny Spring Quarter, there will
still be plenty of masculine com
panions winging their way through
the air.
Yes, we do mean those birdmen
piloting the P-.'s9 Aircobras which
are constantly making their appear
ance over our co-ed's sun porches.
The courtship began on the sandy
strips of the beach at San Gregorio.
Six Stanford women, exposing to the
sun as much as the State Beach
Board would allow, were acquiring
golden tans. The attractive scene was
called to the attention of six air
cobra pilots cruising over the coast.
In tribute to the feminine charm be
neath, the flirtatious iplots pealed off
in perfect formation and dove to
ward the pulchritude below.
Such romantic attention caused
great comment on the sands, and the
charming bathing beauties, after re
placing the shoulder straps of their
suits, waved violent greetings to the
pursuing planes. After a short de
bate, the desperate women decided
that the episode should not end
there. Future contacts must be
made.
With driftwood in hand, the co
quetish co-eds marked out in large
letters on the wet sand . . . STAN
FORDâ€”OOOO. The pilots dipped their
wings in courteous acknowledgment,
and after a few more close survey
ances of the beach gathering, hur
ried oft to their base.
The following evening brought a
phone call to the number mentioned.
The parties concerned talked the
whole thing over and made plans
for an evening date.
The six pursuit pilots headed for
the Stanford campus, made a grand
entrance into the sorority house, find
called loudly for their dates. Upon
examining over the banister the men
below, the six young women hur
ried upstairs to replace their three
inch heels with flat Quad shoes. The
average height of an Aircobra pilot
is five-fool-six, a fact which the co
eds lailed to take into consideration.
Future escapades with the air
forces are to be made only with
Flying Fortresses, was the final con
clusion drawn by the Stanford
women.
But the Aircobra pilots still con
tinue their evening vigil over the
Stanford Farm.
