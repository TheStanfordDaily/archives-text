# E.R.C.
## 'Walking Indians' Learn They're in Army Now 
### Private Bill Hornby 
More than 300 Stanford "Walking Indians" who only a few weeks ago
ore pondering their various fates on the shores of Lagunita or on the Row
re today spotted throughout the country with their memories of induction
t the Monterey Presidio, Fort Mac Arthur, Fort Lewis, or Fort Douglas.
They remember a massive, impersonal system of organization, or, more

? imply, a "hell of a lot of standing in
ine."
Change is the keynote of this
-lory, just as it was the keynote of
the entire induction experience,
Tom the first taste of Army stew to
:he present location of the writer on
troop train full of sheep ranchers,
dentists, farmers, welders, poker
unchy city slickers, and a com
paratively meager handful of Stan
ford men.
Strictly Collegiate
The E.R.C. has one great advan
:.ige over regular selectees. They
ice the transition period surround
ed by fellow collegians. Stanford
lied two barracks ?nd the change
•■•.■ as partially absorbed by the at
mosphere of a college athletic trip—
ne of conversation, card playing, and
."ommon interests.
Even our corporal—no one saw
nything more awe inspiring than a
orporal for several days—philoso
phized that "youse guys from Stan
ford High come from a good school."
The fact that his admission was based
n a desire that we get the floors
lopped a little faster did not detract
•om the collegiate espvit-de-corps
hat saturated the place for a few
days.
The Army can't make you do any
.:ung. They just make you wish that
ou had. A case in point were the
■ urance policies which most of
:ie E.R.C. acquired. They were en
,rely voluntary, but a person who
couldn't see it" had so many officers
;> see with his explanation that it
idn't pay. For example, individual
ize Pvt. Henry David Thoreau 111.
•ho couldn't quite see it, ended up
- eing dots on the line, assured of
ourse that he could withdraw later
a his basic post.
Quad Clothes
At first, the lines were informal.
The lads were in assorted sports
>ats and sweaters that held a vague
eminiscence of the starting post at
'ay Meadows. Then the lines
- traightened out so that the horizon
arrowed down to the neck of he
.1,0 stood before.
Then the line moved through the
hysical exams. These were very
>ugh. My corporal asked me it 1
ould hear. I could. I passed. One
inked at an eye chart. The exara
-er moved one up to it until he
. add read it. Then he passed. For
_eneral body examination, we stood
i line. All who had anything wrong
ith them fell out. The rest were
. :ven a thump or two —about as
t : rty as sounding for depth in the
'_,os Angeles River—and they passed
Came the clothing line. It was like
_-,iing into a coffce grinder with you
laying the bean. At the handle was
he grinning, comfortable form ot
x-Chappie Editor Ken Smith, whe
ntoned from a list to see if all the
cans were in the pot.
Up at 4 a.m.
The Army does not get vip when
he bugle blows reveille. It gets up
n hour and a half before to be ready
r the great event. At least, the
-•anford E.R.C. hit the gritty deck
' a time close to 4 a.m.
College life gave a few final gasps
\ :roup of Cal men, on the way out
arted a school song contest but re
ponse was semi hearty. In the bar
ack;. talk shifted from "Boy, don'l
wish 1 was at the boathouse" tc
I'iie Field Artillery is undoubtedly
c finest spot on earth," or some
ing like that. *
Today the E.R.C. are mostly
-hipped out" with no particular i'usf
cl feathers. Some still remain ai
i- induction centers, drilling, gras
t-aning, pebble pushing, rookie ar
nging, and almost anything else
■at can be invented to keep men oi
eir feet and in motion.
The rest are headed for basic, ;
