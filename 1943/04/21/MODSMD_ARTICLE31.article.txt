# Track Team To Compete With Fresno
## 
### 
Stanford's tracksters get their first
dual meet test of the season Satur
day afternoon on Angell Field. Fres
no Stale's strong squad furnishing
opposition.
The meet gets underway at 2 p.m.,
with the first running event, the
m.ilei seneduled for 2:30.
The Bulldogs, winners last year
over Fitch Johnson's Indians, will
bank 1 eavily on a trio of cinder
artists, Jack Hunt, Louie Futrell,
and Joc> Schropshire.
Hunt Stars
Hunt is the sophomore sprint sen
sation who last week turned in a
:2.9 century in a meet with the val
ley service teams. The Fresno sprint
ace did not run the 220, thus his
entry in this event Saturday is
problematical.
Futrell is perhaps the best hurdler
on the Coast. Winner of the high
hurdles in the Olympic Club indoor
meet in March, Louis is good for
:14.5 in the high barriers and under
:24 in the lows. Futrell gets able
support in his specialties from Jack
Pattee. stale high school high hurdle
champion two years ago. The two
lunners are expected to take one
t.vo in the timber-topping contests.
1:53 Half
Schropshire, who turned in last
year a 1:53 half mile, is not yet in
top shape and may have trouble
winning the 880. Glen Holtby and
Floyd Cuff. Indian runners who fin
ished first and second in the half in
Stanford's invitational meet, both
will give the Fresno ace trouble.
Johnny Fulton, Johnson's best
from the Bulldogs. Fulton has run
a :48.2 quarter, and a :21.7 furlong
already this year.
(Jose Meet
Figured to be one of the closest
duels ever held between the two
schools, the meet is expected to be
decided in the field events. Should
Stanford's discus throwers and shot
jvutters develop sufficiently this
\jveek, the Indians may come out on
t : cp. On the other hand, should Fres
no come up with some unknowns
in these events, the outcome may be
a different story.
Hoping to have his boys in top
r.ihape for aSturday's festivities, John
son has arranged some practice com
petition this afternoon with Palo
alto High School. The prepsters will
be given suitable handicaps, as will
rtome of the Cards.

rtome of the Cards.
Cat Meet
While the Indians and Bulldogs
are competing on Angell Field, Cali
fornia's track squad will be running
and jumping against Tiny Hartranft's
San Jose Staters. Stanford meets
San Jose a week from Saturday.
Stanford's tracksters get their first
dual meet test of the season Satur
day afternoon on Angell Field. Fres
no Stale's strong squad furnishing
opposition.
The meet gets underway at 2 p.m.,
with the first running event, the
m.ilei seneduled for 2:30.
The Bulldogs, winners last year
over Fitch Johnson's Indians, will
bank 1 eavily on a trio of cinder
artists, Jack Hunt, Louie Futrell,
and Joc> Schropshire.
Hunt Stars
Hunt is the sophomore sprint sen
sation who last week turned in a
:2.9 century in a meet with the val
ley service teams. The Fresno sprint
ace did not run the 220, thus his
entry in this event Saturday is
problematical.
Futrell is perhaps the best hurdler
on the Coast. Winner of the high
hurdles in the Olympic Club indoor
meet in March, Louis is good for
:14.5 in the high barriers and under
:24 in the lows. Futrell gets able
support in his specialties from Jack
Pattee. stale high school high hurdle
champion two years ago. The two
lunners are expected to take one
t.vo in the timber-topping contests.
1:53 Half
Schropshire, who turned in last
year a 1:53 half mile, is not yet in
top shape and may have trouble
winning the 880. Glen Holtby and
Floyd Cuff. Indian runners who fin
ished first and second in the half in
Stanford's invitational meet, both
will give the Fresno ace trouble.
Johnny Fulton, Johnson's best
from the Bulldogs. Fulton has run
a :48.2 quarter, and a :21.7 furlong
already this year.
(Jose Meet
Figured to be one of the closest
duels ever held between the two
schools, the meet is expected to be
decided in the field events. Should
Stanford's discus throwers and shot
jvutters develop sufficiently this
\jveek, the Indians may come out on
t : cp. On the other hand, should Fres
no come up with some unknowns
in these events, the outcome may be
a different story.
