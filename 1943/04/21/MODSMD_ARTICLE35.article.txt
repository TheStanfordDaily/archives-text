# Spring Football To Emphasize Body Building
## 
### 
About half of spring footabll prac
tice is going to be devoted entirely
ito body building, meaning regular
| runs on the obstacle course and ex
; ercises, while the other half will be
given over to actual football.
Coach Marchie Schwartz let it be
known that his boys are going to be
j in good condition come September,
if nothing else.
Fifty Out
Monday saw a turout of 50 men
made up of 13 veterans and 37 new
somers, • including numerous men
who were on last year's frosh team.
The returning men who will face
, Stanford's gridiron opponents next
| season, if there are any—both men
J and opponents included—are: Bobby
! Andrews, quarterback, who did a
| lot of work behind first stringer Ray
Hammet; Pete August, center; Dave
i Brown, an end who stacked up with
| the best of them towards the end of
( the season; Bob Hall, another wing-
J man of equal ability; tackle Jim
Cox and guard Bill Young. The lat
j ter two have returned another sea
i son to bolster the center of the Card
| line.
Complete List
Completing the list are backfield
men Bob Munroe, Bob Morrison,
Willard "Rock" Sheller. Clem Woods,
Don Zappetini, and lineman Ted
Norton. Two more lettermen who
j will return soon, but have not re
ported for practice as yet because of
injuries, are Bob Frisbee, fullback,
and Loren LaPrade. guard.
Both Sheller and LaPrade were
first string men, and will be wel
comed back with open arms by
Schwartz, who has a lot of holes to
: fill.
i Frosh Up
Making their first appearance in
varsity suits are six players from
| last year's frosh team. These are
Hal Holman, Dick Madigan, Carson
Rasmussen, Bob Rohrer, and Tom
Yedor. The rest of the squad is com
posed of high school graduates and
transfers.
Looking over the Stanford team of
1942, one can realize the problems
that will face the Indian mentor
when he begins getting a first string
lineup ready.
Stars Missing
Ray Hammett, first string quarter
back and No. 1 passer will be miss
ing. Big Hank Norberg, huge end.
' has also left. Rog Laverty. the other

end, has completed his eligibility.
Milt Vucinich, anchor man for the
line in his pivot position, has left,
as has Bruno Banducci, tackle.
Undoubtedly the hardest place in
the line, in fact in the team, to fill,
will be the guard position left vacant
by Stanford's All-American, Chuck
Taylor.
In these times it is hard enough
to get a team on the field, let alone
finding outstanding football men to
fill the graduates' shoes. However,
it has been done, and it can be done
again.
June Meeting
There is little use of dreaming up
a lineup this far ahead of the open
ing whistle, however, and as lor
Schwartz, he has little or no idea
which players will be with him from
day to day.
As to the continuance of the Pa
cific Coast Conference, the whole
thing remains up in the air at pres
ent.- Whether it will continue on. full
status, a cut schedule, or if it will
be abandoned entirely will probably
be announced at the end of confer
ence. meeting in June.
Chalk Talk
Back to the developments of the
present practice. Schwartz had (he
boys gather for a chalk talk last
night, mainly to acquaint the new
men with Stanford's system of plav.
