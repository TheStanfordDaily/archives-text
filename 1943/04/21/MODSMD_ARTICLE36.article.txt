# 'Play Ball' Rings Today, Majors Start Season
## 
### Bill Allen 
Practically all of the major league ball clubs swing into action today as
thousands of fans eagerly await the pennant races. Dignitaries from the
opening cities will as usual attempt to show the professional pitchers how
to throw a strike when they toss in the first ball.
In the American League the Yankees look like a repeat from last year.

♦in spite 01 the numerous calls to
: service, the Yank farm system has
come up with enough reserve mate
rial to capably fill in the holes ex
cept for the hard hitting Joe Di-
Maggio. The Browns and Red Sox
i appear to be contending for the sec
ond spot with the former a shade
i ahead of the lads from the Bean
City.
In the older look it looks like an
other repeat with the Cardinals from
St. Louis coming up with a strong
aggregation. Brooklyn, under the
leadership of scrappy Leo Durocher
, seems to be the logical choice for
secondary honors. Chicago and Cin
| cinnati are not to be counted out of
the picture by any means either and
all things taken into account the
National League, as usual, should
| have the tightest pennant scramble.
One cellar-dweller that should
j be heard from this year hails from
St. Louis. The Browns were the
least hit of any team in the big time
and with their revamped, capable
hurling staff may stand the young
loop on its ear.
Taking a wild fling into the prog
nosticating world and ducking at
the same time the final results look
like this to your writer:

In the American League the Yankees look like a repeat from last year.

♦in spite 01 the numerous calls to
: service, the Yank farm system has
come up with enough reserve mate
rial to capably fill in the holes ex
cept for the hard hitting Joe Di-
Maggio. The Browns and Red Sox
i appear to be contending for the sec
ond spot with the former a shade
i ahead of the lads from the Bean
City.
In the older look it looks like an
other repeat with the Cardinals from
St. Louis coming up with a strong
aggregation. Brooklyn, under the
leadership of scrappy Leo Durocher
, seems to be the logical choice for
secondary honors. Chicago and Cin
| cinnati are not to be counted out of
the picture by any means either and
all things taken into account the
National League, as usual, should
| have the tightest pennant scramble.
One cellar-dweller that should
j be heard from this year hails from
St. Louis. The Browns were the
least hit of any team in the big time
and with their revamped, capable
hurling staff may stand the young
loop on its ear.
Taking a wild fling into the prog
nosticating world and ducking at
the same time the final results look
like this to your writer:
