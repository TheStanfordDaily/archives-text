# Coast Guard Contest Off Temporarily
## 
### 
Due to a mistake in schedule the
Stanford nine will not play the Ala
meda Coast Guard this afternoon.
The game was previously scheduled
for today but the B.A.C. announced
that arrangements were being made
to meet the club later in the season
if possible.
In lieu of actual competition Coach
Wolter will send his men through
another vigorous workout in hope of
correcting some of the mistakes his
inexperienced men made in the
Santa Clara rout. Emphasis will be
placed on base running in particular,
for absence of that art alone cost the
Cards two runs last Saturday.
Elliot Hurt
Another injury last Saturday con
tinued the bad luck plague of the
Indians. Hugh Elliot, second base
man, broke his ankle sliding into
second base in the second game. The
doctor has announced that he will
be out for the remainder of the sea
son. Jerry Roinstead is the logical
man to take his place, and he looked
good in the first two games this
season.
U.S.F. will attempt to repeat their
early season victory over Stanford
this coming Saturday on the Sunken
Diamond. The teams will play two
games beginning at 1 p.m. Wolter
has not as yet stated who his start
ing pitchers will be, but it is certain
that one of the games will see Jack
Miller, fast-ball artist from Rod
lands, on the hill.
At the plate the Reds still look a
litle weak, and against Con Dempsey
of the Dons they are not likely to
grow stronger.

man, broke his ankle sliding into
second base in the second game. The
doctor has announced that he will
be out for the remainder of the sea
son. Jerry Roinstead is the logical
man to take his place, and he looked
good in the first two games this
season.
U.S.F. will attempt to repeat their
early season victory over Stanford
this coming Saturday on the Sunken
Diamond. The teams will play two
games beginning at 1 p.m. Wolter
has not as yet stated who his start
ing pitchers will be, but it is certain
that one of the games will see Jack
Miller, fast-ball artist from Rod
lands, on the hill.
At the plate the Reds still look a
litle weak, and against Con Dempsey
of the Dons they are not likely to
grow stronger.

Due to a mistake in schedule the
Stanford nine will not play the Ala
meda Coast Guard this afternoon.
The game was previously scheduled
for today but the B.A.C. announced
that arrangements were being made
to meet the club later in the season
if possible.
In lieu of actual competition Coach
Wolter will send his men through
another vigorous workout in hope of
correcting some of the mistakes his
inexperienced men made in the
Santa Clara rout. Emphasis will be
placed on base running in particular,
for absence of that art alone cost the
Cards two runs last Saturday.
Elliot Hurt
Another injury last Saturday con
tinued the bad luck plague of the
Indians. Hugh Elliot, second base
man, broke his ankle sliding into
second base in the second game. The
doctor has announced that he will
be out for the remainder of the sea
son. Jerry Roinstead is the logical
man to take his place, and he looked
