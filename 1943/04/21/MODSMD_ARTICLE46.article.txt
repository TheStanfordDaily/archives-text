## 
### Adolph Gugel 
George Stewart McManus, well known authority on Bach, who presented
I a piano recital last night in the Memorial Auditorium on the Tuesday Eve
; ning Series, is not a Serkin or a Horowitz, but proved himself a scholarly
| but still warm interpreter of the music of Johann Sebastian Bach.
Mr. McManus performed seven of the Preludes and Fugues from the

brief discussions of each. Ho also
briefdiscussions of each He also
told a few amusing anecdotes about
Bach, as well as explaining that the
commonly used title "Well-Tem
pered Clavichord" is not accurate,
for Bach himself gave the set of Pre
ludes and Fugues the title of "Well-
Tempered Clavier."
Stuck to Bach
Throughout the recital, Mr. Mc-
Manus kept as close as possible to
the wishes of the master, but did not
fail to give each work a deep and
moving interpretation. He per
formed the Prelude and Fugue in C
minor in a much slower tempo than
most virtuosi play it, explaining that
Bach wrote the work for the clavier
and the work could not be played
with a fast tempo on that instrument.
Mr. McManus played the Prelude
and Fugue in F major as an encore.
In an interview before the recital,
Mr. McManus stated that in his
opinion, the great increase in popu
larity of Bach's music in the last 15
or 20 years was at first a fad, but
that now people find Bach a real
person who reflects not only a re
ligious spirit, but also a deep hu
manitarian spirit.
Transcriptions
When asked what his opinion was
on the transcriptions of Bach's mu
sic to full orchestra, McManus re
plied that although it was easier for
the average listener to understand
these transcriptions, the works tend
ed to make a smaller impression
than the original form. He also stat
ed that such arrangements usually
took up some of the characteristics
of the collaborator.
