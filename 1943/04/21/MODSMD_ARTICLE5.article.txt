# FORMAL
## Stanford Girls Invite Soldiers 
### 
Twenty-six girls have signed up
to ask members of the S.T.A.R. unit
to the Lagunita-Union formal. The
girls, who were signed up by Chris
Moody and Virginia Schwartz, have
declared that since their men are
; in the armed services, they will be
glad to ask a soldier to the dance.
Any girls who would like to add
i their names to this list should phone
I the War Board Office this afternoon
and leave their names, height, ad
dresses, and telephone numbers,
j Betty lVlae Hale, War Board Co-or
] dinator, announced.
To Capt. Trippe
Thursday morning the War Board
j will take the list of names and
heights to Capt. Trippe, who is in
command of the soldiers at Sequoia
Hall. Capt. Trippe will then have
I the soldiers sign up.
Friday, June Ellis and Chris Moo
! dy will make arrangements for the
I soldiers and the girls to get to
[ gether.
Dean Yost Approves
Dean Mary Yost has approved the
arrangement for the University.
Col. Harry B. Allen, who is in com
mand of all Army units stationed at
Stanford, declared that "when the
men are free it is up to their com
manding officer to be open to any
j suggestions made by the War Board
just so long as the* suggestion does
! not interfere with their studies."
I Capt. Trippe, who is in imme
diate command of the unit, also ap
| proved the arrangement.
To Make Further Plans
Later this week, the War Board
: will make tentative plans to sign
! women on a somewhat similar basis
jto accompany soldiers to movies,
I plays on campus, and other such so
| cial events.
The War Board has already made
| arrangements to replace the broken
; radio which was at Sequoia. Dailies
are now being delivered to Sequoia
Hall for the soldiers, and magazines
have been and will be sent to them.
New Contract
There are now 146 soldiers at Se
quoia Hall in the Student Training
and Assignment and Reclassifica
ton unit. The contract now in ef
j feet permits the Army to send up to
j 500 soldiers to Stanford for this pro-
I gram. A new contract is now being
j negotiated with the University to
i permit the Army to send up to 1.000
| soldiers to Stanford.
The soldiers are sent here from
| their induction centers. They are
classified by a committee of pro
fessors and then reassigned to Army
Special Training Units.
The professors' committee, under
the chairmanship of Dr. J. P. Mitch
: ell, Registrar, must determine at
' which stage each soldier is in his
studies so that he may be put in the
correct training group.
Some Here a Month
Consequently, according to Dr.
j Mitchell, "there will be some whom
! we can qualify in an hour or so
j while others will have to stay here
for as long as a month before we
can qualify them for a specialized
| training unit."
When additional soldiers arrive
I here, if the housing accommodations
| at Sequoia prove inadequate, they
will be put in Branner Hall and they
i may be put in Toyon as it is vacated
! by Stanford men.
