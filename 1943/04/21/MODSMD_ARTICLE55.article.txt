# A 						Stiffness in the Knees

AP-39 whined across the grey sky looking
like a Mallard duck flying down wind—
its neck stretched out and its wings set far
back. Lazily it rolled on its side and then down
it came with a deafening roar. It razzed the
solid, immobile earth and disdainfully, effort
lessly it climbed out of sight.
The imagination is captured by the grim ef
ficiency of a fighter plane, by its scorn for
the flat earth. Besides shrinking the relative
size of the earth, challenging the battleship as
ruler of the waves, and bombing cities, the air
plane has changed the thinking of the average
somewhat imaginative man.
The last war was a war of mass men hav
ing no individuality. Generally the war is
thought of in terms of millions of men in iden
tical uniforms living in trenches and charging
over the top against machine gun fire. Its dead
are honored by the Unknown Soldier, who
might be anyone of the thousand of nameless
men that were identical cogs in a great war
machine.
In ancient times war was more an individual
combat. Hector, Achilles and Horatius all
made their names by doing battle with a single
adversary—not one of many fighting.
Now, once again the same conditions exist.
The pilot has captured the imgaination of man.
The pilot, like the knight of old, goes forth to
joust with the enemy. Paddy Finucanes, and
Collin Kellys—bright, colorful personalities,
are peopling this war.
Maybe this, this new individuality and per
sonalness of the war, is the reason that we get
a thrill in, our stomach and our knees get stiff
when a fighter plane razzes the ground and
"climbs like a homesick Angel" in the hard, blue
sky. We are sure that the pilot has a half smile
on his face as he looks back on the green, im
mobile ground he is defending.
