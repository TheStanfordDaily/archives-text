### CYCLONE COVEY 
A week ago today (nothing like timeliness
in a newspaper) was Pan-American Day.
So far as I know, it was celebrated on cam
pus only by the Latin-American students. And
although Mrs. Hoge, director of Stanford's Inter-
American Propaganda Office, tried her best to
convince me otherwise, I cannot see that it is
yet to be considered a national holiday i his
country.
After all, in the history of our relations with

Hispanic America, we have dates far more cele
brated than April 14, 1890.
For until Herbert Hoover's Latin-American
visit as President-elect, and the Good Neighbor
Policy of Franklin Roosevelt, our record toward
the countries south of us, with the exception of
a few brief pages (the work of Henry Clay, J.
Q. Adams, Stephen Douglas, James Blaine, and
one or two others), has been somewhat igno
miniousâ€”and often not just somewhat.
Of that record, the blackest page was writ
ten by Theodore Roosevelt and his Big Stick.
We can thank our lucky stars that Franklin Roo
sevelt, with Cordell Hull and Sumner Welles,
has been able to promote a changed attitude
before the war could make it too late.

Tuesday night preceding Pan - American
Day, 2,400 people packed Memorial Hall, and
because neither sitting nor standing room re
mained, an additional 200 were turned away.
This, to my knowledge, was not only the
largest Tuesday Series crowd, but the largest
crowd ever to congregate at Memorial Hall for
any occasion.
And what was the attraction? A travelog.
And a travelog less spectacular and less clearly
photographed, as I recall, than the technicolor
travelogs on Africa, Alaska, and the East Indies,
for examples, of past Series programs.
The difference was that this travelog was
on South America. And though the use of "Cav
alcade" in the title instead of "Travelog" un
doubtedly had a psychological bearing on the
case, the audience's size is clear testimony that
people hereabouts are greatly, and genuinely,
interested in their neighbors, in fact, their allies,
to the south.
