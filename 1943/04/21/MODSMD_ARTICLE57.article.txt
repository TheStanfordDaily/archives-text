# Campus Opinion

### 
I The Editor, Sir:
It wasn't until today I got disgusted enough
to write. This is not just panning but construc
tive criticism. Aside from my personal opinions
of Stanford women I would like to make two ob
, servations. I have two very specific gripes.
1. The *?!(! snootiness of Stanford "women"
i and,
2. Girls wearing shoes and sandals without
bobby socks.
Regarding the former, all I can say is that for
a school that has certain democratic traditions
about picking up people who want rides into the
campus and ones going into town, it doesn't
speak very well for it to have high hat girls—
noses heavenward—riding by friends, acquain
tances, and students desirous of rides, in roomy
I cars. It is something real; I've noticed it for
some time. Now, more than ever, with 150
soldiers on campus, the women ought to get
down off their high horse, get their heads out
of the clouds and start to share rides. All the
men do.
Also, not being a girl, I can only say as
an observer what I think about not wearing
socks with shoes. It is bad enough to have
the girls here stuffed shirt socialites but why
|do they have to wear stockingless feet? It
looks undressed and unappealing. It is neither
sexy nor attractive. Bobby socks are not ex
pensive and look much better on than off and
I'm sure lots of guys agree with me. How
would the girls like it if guys wore open toe,
open heel sandals or "wedgies?" Pretty
crumby, I think. Griped.

The Editor, Sir:
The Stanford Daily has a great deal of
power. It is a fine upstanding newspaper. A
number of weeks ago I mentioned in one of
these campus opinions that there were some
old cars back of the Chi O house. Two, to be
exact.
Now there is only one there. But, it too
has a lot of scrap metal in it that could help
us win the war. More action and less talk,
War Board. One Who Cares.
