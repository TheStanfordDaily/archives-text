## Buy Stamps For Easter, Not Clothes 
### 
'"They give their lives—you lend
your money" is the slogan for the
Second War Loan Drive and for the
Campus Stamp Day today. ''We
must remember that this is the
people's war and that we must do
our part to finance it," said Carol
Herwitz, drive chairman.
"Because Sunday is Easter, it re
minds us of the current materialism
connected with that day, but this
year both Stanford men and women
should think about what their pur
chases can mean to a fighting man,"
she continued.
The OWI has released a bulletin
summarizing the purchases that can
be made with the money from one
war bond. For an American soldier
$18.75 will buy a complete set of
summer clothes, while it costs $154.95
(about BV4 of those bonds) to outfit
a soldier with 50 articles of clothing,
12 articles of barracks equipment,
and 29 articles of individual equip
ment.
Clothing From Bonds
For $96.40 (just over five bonds)
a sailor gets 41 items of clothing and
personal equipment. A Marine, for
$155.94, is provided with some 50
pieces of clothing, a dozen articles of
garrison equipment, and 18 items of
individual equipment.
Here are some other things a bond
purchase will provide for the fight
ing men. For a soldier, a wool over
coat, a pair of woolen trousers, and
a wool garrison cap total exactly
$18.75; or two wool blankets and a
folding steel cot total $18.78.
Sailor's Equipment
For a sailor, the War Bond means
an overcoat, a jersey, and a pair of
leggings or two wool blankets, a pair
of shoes, and a shoe brush set.
An $18.75 war bond would make
a Marine comfortable for the night
with a 23-pound mattress, two blank
ets, and a pillow; or he could be
provided with a rubberized fabric
poncho, a helmet with its lining, a
rifle cartridge belt, and a Marine
Corps pack.
''Stamp purchases total war bonds,
and we must do our part with the
continued purchase of these bonds
and stamps," Miss Hurwitz con
cluded. Stamps will be sold on the
English corner, the engineering cor
ner, and in the living groups.
Results of stamp sales will be
listed in The Daily. Salesmen are
requested by Miss Hurwitz to turn
their figures in as soon as possible
so that the Daily listings may be
accurate.

folding steel cot total $18.78.
Sailor's Equipment
For a sailor, the War Bond means
an overcoat, a jersey, and a pair of
leggings or two wool blankets, a pair
of shoes, and a shoe brush set.
An $18.75 war bond would make
a Marine comfortable for the night
with a 23-pound mattress, two blank
ets, and a pillow; or he could be
provided with a rubberized fabric
poncho, a helmet with its lining, a
rifle cartridge belt, and a Marine
Corps pack.
''Stamp purchases total war bonds,
and we must do our part with the
continued purchase of these bonds
and stamps," Miss Hurwitz con
cluded. Stamps will be sold on the
English corner, the engineering cor
ner, and in the living groups.
Results of stamp sales will be
listed in The Daily. Salesmen are
requested by Miss Hurwitz to turn
their figures in as soon as possible
so that the Daily listings may be
accurate.
'"They give their lives—you lend
your money" is the slogan for the
Second War Loan Drive and for the
Campus Stamp Day today. ''We
must remember that this is the
people's war and that we must do
our part to finance it," said Carol
Herwitz, drive chairman.
"Because Sunday is Easter, it re
minds us of the current materialism
connected with that day, but this
year both Stanford men and women
should think about what their pur
chases can mean to a fighting man,"
she continued.
The OWI has released a bulletin
summarizing the purchases that can
be made with the money from one
war bond. For an American soldier
$18.75 will buy a complete set of
summer clothes, while it costs $154.95
(about BV4 of those bonds) to outfit
a soldier with 50 articles of clothing,
12 articles of barracks equipment,
and 29 articles of individual equip
ment.
Clothing From Bonds
For $96.40 (just over five bonds)
a sailor gets 41 items of clothing and
personal equipment. A Marine, for
$155.94, is provided with some 50
pieces of clothing, a dozen articles of
garrison equipment, and 18 items of
individual equipment.
Here are some other things a bond
purchase will provide for the fight
ing men. For a soldier, a wool over
coat, a pair of woolen trousers, and
a wool garrison cap total exactly
$18.75; or two wool blankets and a
folding steel cot total $18.78.
