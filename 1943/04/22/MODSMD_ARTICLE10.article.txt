# Women Enter Security Force
## 
### 
One more war service was opened
up to women last week, when the
Navy announced that women would
be admitted to the Volunteer Port
Security Force of the U.S. Coast
Guard. This security force, hard at
work in port cities all over the
country, serves as a waterfront
guard before and after working
hours. The Navy Department intends
to recruit women to drive and feed
women volunteers, and do clerical
work.
Like the men, women members of
the force will rate uniforms, paid for
by the Navy if they put in 12 or
more hours per week at the job, and
bought at their own expense if they
work less than that. The uniform
ha snot yet been designed. Also like
their male colleagues, women will
be subject to military discipline
while on duty.
Coast Guard officials report that
quotas have not yet been set for all
cities, but approximately one woman
tor every 10 men is needed.
Women living in port cities who
are interested in joining the Volun
teer Port Security Force should
watch for announcements in their
local papers, Coast Guard officials
advise.
