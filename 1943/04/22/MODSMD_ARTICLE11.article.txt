# Navy Adopts New Weight Tables
## 
### 
The Navy has adopted the stand- [
ard weight tables devised by Dr. j
Helen B. Pryor, professor of hygiene j
and medical advisor of women. On j
the basis of these tables, which take j
into consideration not only age and j
height but also body build, so-called
underweight or overweight men are j
now being accepted for training in
the Navy air force.
The tables developed by Dr. !
Pryor replace the commonly used
"'standard" average weight tables i
which, according to medical investi- |
gators, fail to give a true picture of ;
the nutritional condition of indi
viduals.
Dr. Pryor's tables, now considered
standard in the medical profession
and used by schools and insurance
companies, are the result of 10 years
study of more than 12,000 people.

Dark hair is so widely distributed
among mankind that it does not J
serve to define race, and, as with '
blue eyes, even the special trait of j
blond hair does not run uniformly
through a racial group.
