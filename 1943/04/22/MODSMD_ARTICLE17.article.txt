# Chinese Made Easier by Chan
## 
### Margie Smith 
If you're having trouble with your
Chinese, or you can't quite convince
the laundry man that you want your
shirts back this quarter, someone is
making life easier for you. It's Shau
Wing Chan, one of our own faculty.
He has written a book, "Chinese
Reader for Beginners," now in its
third printing at the Stanford Press,
which is an entirely new method of
presenting this ancient language to
the American people.
The basic characters have been
limited to a mere 700, yet there is
a practical vocabulary of 4,000 to
4,500 words available. It is the
standard Mandarin dialect, usable in
almost any section of China.
Mr. Chan is now working on a
sequel to this first book, and he feels
that any student that goes through
both texts will have a usable knowl
edge of Chinese.
Mr. Chan's book is now being used
in a number of institutions as well
as by the United Slates Army in its
training. This is an indication of the
general feeling in America expressed
by Mr. Chan that "The Far East will
be closer and closer to the United
States after the war, and anyone
who is equipped with a knowledge
of its major language will be in
valuable in this important field."

The Army ordnance division slo
gan is: "The difficult things we do
immediately. The impossible takes
a little longer."
