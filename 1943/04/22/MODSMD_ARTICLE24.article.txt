## British Eighth Gains 2 Miles 
### (By United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, No.
Africa, April 21.â€”British Eighth
Army troops drove a spearhead
nearly two miles into the mountain
ranges west of Enfidaville today
after capturing that Axis anchor
point and beating off four heavy
counter assaults by German forces
who fought desperately with their
backs to the Gulf of Tunis only 35
miles away.
The British had smashed to the
1,200-foot peak of Djcbel Garci, 10
miles west of Enfidaville, official dis
patches said, and thus secured a toe
hold in the Axis defense command
ing a considerable enemy area.
The battle blazed eastward along
a five-mile line where the British
also held firmly to two hard won
vantage points as the best German
front line troops replaced Italians in
an effort to stem Gen. Sir B. L.
Montgomery's advance on Tunis.
In perfect timing, with the Eighth
Army stand, French forces imme
diately to the left gained further
! high ground against little opposition,
j and the British First Army attacked
j in the northwest three miles north
' of Medjez-El-Bab.
