## Stanford Girls Invite Soldiers 
### 
Forty girls signed up at the War
Board Office yesterday afternoon to
take soldiers to the Lagunita-Union
Formal. This raises the number of
girls taking soldiers to 66.
Monday Chris Moody and Virginia
Schwartz signed up 26 girls to take
soldiers. Tuesday the matter was
taken to the War Board and Dean
Mary Yost, for the University, and
Col. Harry B. Allen, for the Army,
approved the plan. On Wednesday
the 40 girls signed up.
The girls signed up giving their
names, height, addresses, and tele
phone numbers. The list will be

taken today to Captain Trippe, com
manding officer of the soldiers at
Sequoia, who will have the soldiers
.sign up.
In tomorrow's Daily there will be 1
printed all arrangements for meet- j
ing the soldiers and further instruc
tions. These are being worked out
j by Miss Moody and June Ellis, USO
head.
"If this dance is a success," June ;
Ellis said, "arrangements will be j
made to have the soldiers invited to j
all the campus dances. Signups will
I be used, as in this case, if the turn- j
; over among the soldiers is rapid.
If it is slow, however, and each sol
dier remains at Stanford for a period
of time, such signups will probably j
f not be necessary."
Colonel Allen declared that all :
such projects must be decided by the
soldiers' immediate commanding of- ;
i fleers but that he saw no reason why j
the dances should not be permitted
providing that the soldiers' studies
were not interfered with.
