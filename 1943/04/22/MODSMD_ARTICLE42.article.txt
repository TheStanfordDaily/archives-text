'O ACHES PONDER
Fresno State entry list in front of
lim, Stanford Track Coach Pitch
ohnson probably spent the better
>art of yesterday evening trying, to
igure out how his thinclads can take
he Bulldogs next Saturday. And
t's also a good guess that Fresno
nentor Flint Hanner was doing
omething on the same order at about
he same time down in the prune
â€¢ountry.
The two coaches probably worked
ate, too. because each, if he uses his
nen right and they come through,
nay come up with the winning
quad.
Hanner, a Stanford grad (class of
922), very likely spent most of his
ime trying to figure out how to use
oe Shropshire, his middle distance
.ee, to best advantage. Shropshire
s entered in the 440, 880, and mile,
>ut obviously can't run them all.
Jut what' Johnson would like to
.now is, just what will he run?
No matter which two races Hanner
>uts him in. Joe's going to have his
lands full.
Aside from the problem of jockey
ng his men around so that they will
core a maximum number of points,
ohnson's troubles center around
he various weight events.
Fresno has the first place in the
hot cinched; Stanford, or rather Al
J ande. should easily win the javelin,
seconds and thirds in these events,
ilong with all three places in the
liscus. may well decide the meet.
