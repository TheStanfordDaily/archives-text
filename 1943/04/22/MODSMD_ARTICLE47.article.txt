# Dekes, Zetes, Win in Murals
## 
### 
In the second afternoon of Intra
mural baseball, a composite check
of the records show that in the six
games scheduled for yesterday, two
were defaults, two were close, and
two were wide open.
Chi Psi and S.A.E. were the
claimants of defaults, by virtue ol
the Firehouse and A.K.L.'s failure
to appear on the diamond.
Zeta Psi chalked up their second
straight win of the season by taking
a close 8-7 decision from Wong's
Tong. Johnny Eikelman handled the
pitching job for the Zetes. with Fred
Oliver catching.
Another squeeze win was posted
by the Alpha Delt organization with
a (5-5 win over the Delta Tau Delta
10. Dick Thomas pitched for the
Alpha Delts, and the battery for the
Delts was Bob Rosecrance on the
mound, with Bob Brodie behind the
plate.
The Phi Psi-Deke game ended in
an 11-6 count, with the Dekes hold
ing the top honors at the conclusion.
Jack Clark pitched for the win
ners with Bill Joslyn catching, and
for the losers, ' Rock" Sheller hurled
and Bill Young caught.
Presenting the greatest offensive
power of the afternoon's rivalry
were the Kappa Sigma and Phi Delt
clubs. After five tremendous in
nings. a pitchers' battle all the way.

both teams decided to call the whole
thing oft. The Kappa Sigs, however,
were given the benefit of the doubt
in the scorekeeper's mind, and took
away with them a 27-15 victory.
Listing the outstanding hitters is im
possible. Both teams looked like the
old ''Murderers' Row"â€”at the plate.
