NEW YORK. April 21 (UP). â€”The world champion St. Louis Cards tip
toed into the 1943 season today by bowing to the Cincinnati Reds, 1-0, in
an eleven-inning game which took top billing over three other league
shutouts, the only other games played.
Johnny Vander Meer, ace Red southpaw, turned in a masterful two-

hit job against the Cards for the
day's top pitching performance.
The Pittsburgh Pirates white- i
washed the Chicago Cubs in the i
other National League game.
In the American League, the j
Cleveland Indians blanked the De- fl
troit Tigers, 1-0, and St. Louis shut j
out the Chicago White Sox. 3-0.
At Chicago, the Pirates trounced j
the Cubs on the strength of Luke j
Sewell's three - hit pitching in a S
game marred somewhat by injuries.
Cub catcher Clyde McCullough
cracked an ankle bone; Eddie Span- '
ky, Cub second baseman, was hit in
the head by Sewell, and Huck
Geary, the Pirates' expensive new j
shortstop, was shaken in a collision I
at second base. The latter two play
ers stayed in the game.
