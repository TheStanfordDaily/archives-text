# Time Trials Held Yesterday: Fresno Entry List Arrives
## 
### 
Turning in erratic performances in most events, Stanford's track team
last night held its last set of time trials before the Fresno State meet,
scheduled for Saturday.

Palo Alto High School's runners
, and jumpers furnished opposition for
the Indians, and in several races had
I such tremendous handicaps the Cards
never did catch up.
Outstanding performance of the
| competition was registered by John
; ny Fulton in the 330. Fulton, start
ing from scratch, sprinted the dis
tance in :34.5, although two Paly
runners, with handicaps of 50 and 60
i yards respectively, finished ahead of
: him.
Dave Bills, another Indian who
was the victim of a Viking with a
j tremendous head start, negotiated
1 the 1,320 in 3:14.2.
Jim Chamberlain and Wayne Gird
ner, both running against the watch,
turned in their best marks of the
season for the 660. Chamberlain
hustled the distance in 1:24.4: Gird
ner made it in 1:23.8.
Performances in the field events
j were in general mediocre.
Meanwhile Fresno State sent its
entry list up to Johnson, one which
includes four of the best compt?titors
in the state: Jack Hunt, Louis Fu
j trell, Joe Shropshire, and Jean La
j mour.
Of the four, only Lamour and Fu
j trell are rated sure things in their
events. Futrell is figured to take the
high hurdles, while Lamour, on the
strength of a 49-foot put last week,
I shouldn't have much trouble win
| ning the shot.
Fresno's list of relay men showed
the Bulldogs uo to he strong in that
event also. Shropshire, Hunt, Fu
trell, Don Baker, and Joe Flores, the
j entrants, all are capable of around
or under :51. Stanford's relay four
; some, to be picked from Glen Holt
by, Fulton, Girdner, Floyd Cuff, and
' Dud Cramer, won the mile relay at
J the Olympic Club meet in March.
