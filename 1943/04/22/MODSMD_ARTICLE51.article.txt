# On Sloppy Sweaters

### 
THE Navy called for volunteers to fill its April
29 class at Northwestern. Seventeen Stan
ford men volunteered to leave college and learn
the many complex things that ensigns must
know.
We can say little in commenting about these
seventeen. One has only to sit in the sun in
front of the Library in his jeans and loose
sweater to know graphically what they are giv
ing up—the last precious days as civilians—the
easy sunny days of Spring Quarter at Stanford.
The life at Northwestern will be hard. They
will arise early and study assiduously, but we
feel certain that when they are through, when
they receive their commissions and take their
posts along the battle lines of the United Na
tions, helping navigate battleships, running a
pom-pom gun on a destroyer, or the gun on a
merchant vessel—then when they pause and
look at the gold stripe on their blue sleeve, they
will be glad of the decision they made.
To the seventeen we say good luck.
