# The 						Academic Big Game

### 
FORTY-NINE years ago, a Frenchman, Baron
Pierre de Caubertin, instigated a tournament
on subjects relative to his country. His purpose
was to encourage students to take an interest
in French problems and to promote continued
friendly relations between his country and the
United States.
Tonight, in the Memorial Auditorium, the 49th
loffre Debate between Stanford and California
will continue the policy of Baron Caubertin.
Three students from each University will de
bate a guestion concerning the struggle for
power among the French factions. But none of
the contestants will know the exact wording of
the guestion until debate time.
The famed and coveted Joffre medal will be
awarded the best individual speaker. â€” Jane
