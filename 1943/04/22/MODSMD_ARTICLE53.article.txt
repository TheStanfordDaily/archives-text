# Good Will Recipe

### 
THE setting was Hidden Villa Ranch, comfort
ably snuggling in fresh, green wooded hills.
The time was a dusky, refreshing Saturday eve
ning and a glorious, country Sunday. The actors,
about a dozen gracious Stanford women and
about the same number of service men. Mixed
well together these elements produced a happy,
successful weekend for all concerned.
And this was War Work.
It was last weekend, under the auspices of
the Stanford USO, that a group of women, beni
on giving boys temporarily back from battle a
good time, met in Los Altos. With men in blue
and khaki uniforms, they roue in a hay wagon
through a beautiful canyon singing and laugh

ing. And at the end of the trip was a Youth
Hostel.
Here, in an atmosphere of informality and
congeniality, they all gathered 'round a long
table to eat hearty meals. They tramped to
gether up fern covered trails, and danced, and
swam, and sang.
Each soldier and sailor felt at ease. Men
from Minnesota and Kentucky, London and Aus
tralia found common bonds as they joined in
songs from all countries. The Stanford girls were
responsible for the atmosphere of good will and
good fun. And each girl realized it and felt the
inner satisfaction springing from making others
happy.
And this was War Work.â€”Jane Glasson
