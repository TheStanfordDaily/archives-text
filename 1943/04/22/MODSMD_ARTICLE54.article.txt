The Editor, Sir:
I am glad to see that there is some interest
taken by some of the male population in the
women's dress on campus when they take such
a little interest in their own appearance. Have
you ever heard about the people who live in
glass houses? Well!
I'm all in favor of the rugged appearance of
the Stanford rough. I like jeans, and the crew
haircuts. I like a "clean-rough" look. Don't you
think, though, that this can be and is carried too
far? There is no excuse in the sloppy appear
ance of a good many of our would-be roughs.
I'd like to give a little constructive advice too.
I would start at the head and go to the foot.

How about more crew haircuts—or at least
haircuts? Maybe 75 cents a whack is pretty
high, but even at that rate it's worth it. My
stomach turns inside out when I see a boy (or
guy, as you say) with his hair drooping down
around his ears two inches long. I'd also say
that if the men would follow the wash-head
once-a-week policy that women follow, there
would be less nausea among the women when
they sit behind these once-a-year-wash-head
guys, or, the shower-in-the-gym-gets-my-head
clean guys. How about that, gay? See my
point?
Now to the shirt. No gripes. Trousers; well,
some. The clean jeans are all right; but the
dirty ones are pretty repulsive.
Men in toeless shoes? No, never. You're
right, bub, but those of us who wear ankle sox
usually wear cleaner ones than a lot of you do.
I'm one of your "sockless offenders" and have
no defense for myself. You're right. We would
look better if we were to take a few minutes to
darn those socks we discarded last week and
put them on. I would hate to see men without
socks as much as you hate to see us without
them. I'm a reformed woman, so thanks, guy.
Now for the snobbishness. Again, no de
fense. I do think, however, that there are just
as many men who have that difficulty as women.
(Who was it that said "Conceit is a form of
mental chloroform provided by nature to make
man unconscious of the fact that he is a sap"?)
There are probably two extremes and most
of us belonging to the Stanford Family belong
in the middle of our bell-shaped curve studied
in Stat. The extreme being on the one side
overly snobbish and on the other side overly
friendly. Believe it, bub?
Overly Friendly

The Editor, Sir:
Why don't you write some decent editorials.
All that has been pouring from your pen has
been a sort of half-baked adolescent nostalgia
about the beauties of spring, the feeling that
some of us might get in our knees if we were
to look at P-39's diving on the school (which
they do often enough), or something almost un
intelligible about the falling of Bataan.
Give us some editorials about Stanford. Less
garbage.
Also let's have more action out of the War
Board and less horn tooting; the car is still
there. One Who Cares
P.S. I dare you to print this.

Overly Friendly

The Editor, Sir:
Why don't you write some decent editorials.
All that has been pouring from your pen has
been a sort of half-baked adolescent nostalgia
about the beauties of spring, the feeling that
some of us might get in our knees if we were
to look at P-39's diving on the school (which
they do often enough), or something almost un
intelligible about the falling of Bataan.
Give us some editorials about Stanford. Less
garbage.
Also let's have more action out of the War
Board and less horn tooting; the car is still
there. One Who Cares
P.S. I dare you to print this.
The Editor, Sir:
I am glad to see that there is some interest
taken by some of the male population in the
women's dress on campus when they take such
a little interest in their own appearance. Have
you ever heard about the people who live in
glass houses? Well!
I'm all in favor of the rugged appearance of
the Stanford rough. I like jeans, and the crew
haircuts. I like a "clean-rough" look. Don't you
think, though, that this can be and is carried too
far? There is no excuse in the sloppy appear
ance of a good many of our would-be roughs.
I'd like to give a little constructive advice too.
I would start at the head and go to the foot.

How about more crew haircuts—or at least
haircuts? Maybe 75 cents a whack is pretty
high, but even at that rate it's worth it. My
stomach turns inside out when I see a boy (or
guy, as you say) with his hair drooping down
around his ears two inches long. I'd also say
that if the men would follow the wash-head
once-a-week policy that women follow, there
would be less nausea among the women when
they sit behind these once-a-year-wash-head
guys, or, the shower-in-the-gym-gets-my-head
clean guys. How about that, gay? See my
point?
Now to the shirt. No gripes. Trousers; well,
some. The clean jeans are all right; but the
dirty ones are pretty repulsive.
Men in toeless shoes? No, never. You're
right, bub, but those of us who wear ankle sox
usually wear cleaner ones than a lot of you do.
I'm one of your "sockless offenders" and have
no defense for myself. You're right. We would
look better if we were to take a few minutes to
darn those socks we discarded last week and
put them on. I would hate to see men without
socks as much as you hate to see us without
them. I'm a reformed woman, so thanks, guy.
Now for the snobbishness. Again, no de
fense. I do think, however, that there are just
as many men who have that difficulty as women.
(Who was it that said "Conceit is a form of
mental chloroform provided by nature to make
man unconscious of the fact that he is a sap"?)
There are probably two extremes and most
of us belonging to the Stanford Family belong
in the middle of our bell-shaped curve studied
in Stat. The extreme being on the one side
overly snobbish and on the other side overly
friendly. Believe it, bub?
