# REVIEW
## 'Reveille' Has Music, 'Plot' 
### 
"REVEILLE WITH BEVERLY,"
now playing at Stanford Theater.
Columbia's "Reveille With Bever- '
ly" is a tuneful, little musical with
Ann Miller which features Frank
Sinatra, the Mills Brothers, the Ra
dio Rogues, and the orchestras of
Duke Ellington, Bob Crosby, Count
Basie, and Freddie Slack. Besides
the musical numbers, which are
; humdingers, the movie also has a
plot ,which seems unnecessary.
The plot, such as it is, concerns a
! girl with an early morning radio
' jam session for soldiers. This is'
! based on the real-life program of
Jean Ruth which has won her an
! enormous following from service I
men all over the country. William
Wright and Dick Foran are two sol- ;
diers who make a bet on Ann's !
looks after hearing her, and of course
have to do a little research on the
I subject.
Ann Miller has only one dance
number but it is excellent. Wonder
why Hollywood signs dancers and
then tries to make singers or actors (
out of them. As a dancer Ann's '
- terrific. As an actress she's only
] nediocre.
There's a lot of favorites in this, j
I "Take the A Train," "One O'Clock
Jump," and "Cow-Cow Boogie" to i
mention a few. Grand for record
.•ans.
"Tarzan Triumphs" is the second
eature. —Hovt.
