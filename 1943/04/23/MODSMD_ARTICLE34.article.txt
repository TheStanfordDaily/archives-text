# Grad Recalls San Francisco Night Life
## 
### 
An ex-Stanford class of '41 stu
dent, John W. Fitting Jr. of Oakland,
is on active duty in the South Pa
! cific. One night, after listening to a
short wave broadcast from San |
Francisco, he sat down and wrote a
j letter to a friend. Excerpts from his
letter appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle. San Francisco's Chamber
of Commerce should be proud. And
so should Miss F , the feminine
figure of the story, who has been
identified as a Stanford girl from
the class of '43.
In reference to the broadcast, Fit
ting claimed:
"The line that got me was 'This is
! San Francisco.' Those words can
I only mean something to you when
you are thousands of miles from
| there. ... To boys like me, it means
a thousand spots remembered, and a
hundred familiar faces. . . .
Wine Glasses, Smiles
"To me, it means a thousand smiles
, given over wine glasses, a thousand
| tiny dance floors. I remember one
: in particular, on some small alley in
the Spanish district. F looking
only as she could look. A black
gown, black furs, a black veil, and
; perfume that whispered of mystery
on a foggy night. The spot was tiny
I and smoky . . . the music was Span
i ish and exotic. We paid the orches
tra to play 'Siboney' and danced just
one rumba. We lingered over a
j drink and then went on to join the
crowd of people we were with. . . .
It was as unforgettable as any other
minute that I have had, and made
worthwhile all the money I wasted
on her and all the anguish I put into
a relationship that was farcial from
I the beginning. . . . Still, that small
j bit of time was F and all the
! glamor the two of us shared together.

made up a crowd that had just come
from the opening of the opera, to the
hotel ballroom we were in. . . .
'Talking at 5 in the morning in a
darkened speakeasy that had a quiet
j piano to keep its habitues awake
(may we state here that Miss F
has returned home). ... A hundred
overtures and rising curtains. One
never ending quest for poached eggs
! and hashed brown potatoes at the
show's end. . . .
"And a thousand times like this.
Memories? No, just the meaning of
a city, just the meaning of—'This is

An ex-Stanford class of '41 stu
dent, John W. Fitting Jr. of Oakland,
is on active duty in the South Pa
! cific. One night, after listening to a
short wave broadcast from San |
Francisco, he sat down and wrote a
j letter to a friend. Excerpts from his
letter appeared in the San Francisco
Chronicle. San Francisco's Chamber
of Commerce should be proud. And
so should Miss F , the feminine
figure of the story, who has been
identified as a Stanford girl from
the class of '43.
In reference to the broadcast, Fit
ting claimed:
"The line that got me was 'This is
! San Francisco.' Those words can
I only mean something to you when
you are thousands of miles from
| there. ... To boys like me, it means
a thousand spots remembered, and a
hundred familiar faces. . . .
Wine Glasses, Smiles
"To me, it means a thousand smiles
, given over wine glasses, a thousand
| tiny dance floors. I remember one
: in particular, on some small alley in
the Spanish district. F looking
only as she could look. A black
gown, black furs, a black veil, and
; perfume that whispered of mystery
on a foggy night. The spot was tiny
I and smoky . . . the music was Span
i ish and exotic. We paid the orches
tra to play 'Siboney' and danced just
one rumba. We lingered over a
j drink and then went on to join the
crowd of people we were with. . . .
It was as unforgettable as any other
minute that I have had, and made
worthwhile all the money I wasted
on her and all the anguish I put into
a relationship that was farcial from
I the beginning. . . . Still, that small
j bit of time was F and all the
! glamor the two of us shared together.
