# Indian Tracksters to Meet Fresno Tomorrow
## Fulton, Futrell Picked to Win 
### Ed Luce 
Flint Hanner brings his 23-man
Fresno State track team up here to
morrow afternoon for a meet with
Pitch Johnson's Indians, and in the
words of Bruce Lee, "might barely
squeeze through by 11 points or so."
Lee, Chronicle sportswriter, could
be right. Still, let's take a look at
the various events, and see how
Bulldog l stacks up against Indian in
each.
First running event, the mile run,
finds Cards Bob Compton and Dave
Bills, the latter a surprise entry,
battling Joe Flores and Bill Kisling
from Fresno. Compton and Bills
have been running well enough to
lake one-two.
Hunt Pinked
Jackie Hunt, Bulldog sprint sen
sation, ought to cop the 100, with
teammate Grant Hyde battling it out
with Bob Fess for second place.
A sure-fire thriller, the quarter
looks like Stanford's race, with
Johnny Fulton and Dud Cramer
ready to go against Joe Shropshire
and Don Baker. Fulton will win,
Shropshire ought to take second.
Cramer is in shape and should take
Ihird, but might edge Joe.
Shropshire Back
The hurdles are all Fresno, Bull
dogs Louis Futrell and Jack Patter
forming the best barrier combine on
the Coast. Indian Joe Mardesich
seems to have the third place in the
highs cinched, hut will have to work
for a point in the lows.
Shropshire, after running a tough
will probably return to take
cn Cards Wayne Girdner, Glen
Holtby, and Floyd CutT in tlie 880.
Giidner has looked good in prac
tice, as has Holtby. They can and
may take one-two.
Fulton. Hunt
In the 220, Hunt will be back to
try for a double win, but so will
Fulton, and the Stanford runner
rates the nod. Fess ought to squeeze
jn here for a third.
Hardest race of the day to pick
5s the two-mile, and Stanford will
have Bills while Fresno's top en
tries are Flores and Kisling.
i√üelay Doubtful
Hoping that the meet will be de
cided before the relay, Johnson is
planning to hold Fulton out of the
last event. Should the event decide
Ihe contest, however, Fulton will
anchor the Card quartet. Hunt, Fut
rell, Baker, and Shropshire will
probably handle the baton passing
duties for the Bulldogs.
With the exception of the high
jump and javelin, Fresno expects to
lake first place in every field event.
Jean Lamour and Pattee are Flint
Manner's hopes in the shot, and may
take one-two. Should either Fred
Boensch, Ed Chynoweth, or Jim
Camel suddenly begin heaving up
to capacity, however, Pattee won't
do better than third.
Pole Vault
In the pole vault Fresno has for
mer state high school champion Bob
Carlsen. competing against Cards
Claire Brenchley and Martin Ander
son. Carlsen didn't do 12 feet two
weeks ago, but his past record
makes him the favorite.
Johnson has seven men entered
in the discus, but none can be rated
higher than third off past perform
ances. In the broad jump Futrell
ought to get his third first place,
with Indian Bob Carr right behind.
Stanford's best chance for a clean
.' weep comes in the high jump. Wil
lard Smith and Bob Zaleska should
take first and second, with third
place a wide open proposition be
tween four other Cards and three
Bulldogs.
The final score? It might be Stan
ford 67, Fresno State 64.

California's industrial accident
rate declined in 1942 despite the
heavy increase in employment, an
achievement shared by only three
other industrial states.
