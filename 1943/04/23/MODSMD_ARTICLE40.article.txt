# INTRAMURALS
## Dekes Shut Out Kappa Sigs 12-0 in Feature Mural Game 
### 
When the sun had set over the intramural baseball fields yesterday,
the results showed that the Sigma Nil's had pulled a complete reversal of
their earlier form by clouting Kappa Alpha, 11-4. A 5-2 count wont to
the Alpha Delt team, through the courtesy of SA.E., and the Dekes as
usual nudged out the Kappa Sigs, 12-0.
Rounding out the intramural sport picture were wins by Sigma Chi,

9-1, over Theta Delta Chi; Theta*
Chi, 6-1, over the Chemistry Club; I
and Beta, 6-3, over Chi Psi.
Sigma Nu had big Jim Bucking- j
ham on the mound with Howie Iloff- !
man behind the plate. The game was j
iced in the first inning when the
eventual winners poured seven
quick runs across the plate. From
there on in, they coasted.
The S.A.E. - Alpha Delt contest
was featured by a home run off the
bat <5f the victors' Ben Earl. Dick
Thomas was the winning pitcher.
There is nothing to be said of the j
Dekes' win over Kappa Sig. The !
final score of 12-0 speaks for itself. |
Credit for the win, however, falls on '
the able shoulders of Jack Clark,
who limited the losers to two flimsy j
hits. It was murder.
Nothing is known about the next
game, except that the score was 9-1 j
with the Sigma Chi men on the long j
I end. Jack Heald pitched.
The Chem club dropped a 6-1 de
i eL-ion to Theta Chi. In their first
! game, they whitewashed Sigma Nu j
15-1. Harry Boothe worked the
. game for Theta Chi. In fact, he
' worked the Chem club into 12
j strike-outs during the afternoon.
Walt Ball stole the show for the
i winners with a home run.
From what we gather about the
Chi Psi-Beta game, anything could
j have happened, and did. The Betas
i acquired four runs in the second
inning through the help of Chi Psi's
catcher, A1 Hampson.
Beta's Jim Cox hit a ball that was
; slated to end up in the Seals' Sta
dium, and slowly shuffled his way to
third base. An equally amazing sit
uation was brought to the front as
"Rosebud" Hind, Chi Psi stalwart,
proceeded to stretch an infield fly
j into a home run. Just how he did
! it. no one knows. Beta errors helped.
Rog Laverfy cut the losers' last
inning rally short by making a mag-
I nificent catch of a long fly ball, and
throwing "Traitor" Hampson out at
third. Beta Dick Osborne, who did
not touch the ball all day, brought
the classic to a fitting when,
with a determined look on his face,
he said, "Tough game!"

Unaided by any lens, a Swedish
| archbishop four centuries ago drew
j pictures of snowflakes and published
a book with 23 wood cuts.
