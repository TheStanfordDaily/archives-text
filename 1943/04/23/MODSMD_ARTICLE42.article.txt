# Reds Face U.S.F. Dons In Double Header Here
## 
### 
In an attempt to prove to the
sporting world that they have a win
ning ball club, Stanford's undaunted
nine faces the University of San
Francisco tomorrow for two games
on the Sunken Diamond. The double
header will start at 1 p.m. promptly
and since many fans missed the first
past of last Saturday's twin bill they
are advised to come early and see
all of the fine ball that is certain to
be played.
At this point U.S.F'. seems to have
a slight edge over the Reds on the
basis of their wins over St. Mary's,
who whipped the Indians earlier in
the season. They will also have the
edge in the pitching department il
they can find another starter com
parable to the versatile Con Demp
sey. Con throws everything but his
giove at opposing batters and with
a little backing up in the field he
would be the leading winner in the
league. He will be opposed by either
Jack Miller or Bernard Woody, since
the ability of Doc Mason to work is
probable. If possible Harry Wolter
would like to use him, and may yet
do so in the role of relief hurler.
The infields stack up with Stan
ford on top of the deck. Wolter has
managed to build a tight infield out
of what the armed services have left
at his call with veteran Bobby
Brown in the short patch and capable
Jay McKie at third there are very
few balls that go through to the
outer gardens.

The game should feature the hit
ting of Howie Dallmar and Lloyd
Merriman who, with Brown, com
prise the "murderers row" of the big
veam.
The Cards need improvement in
the base running end of the game
as has been demonstrated in most
of their games this season. It was
one of the deciding factors in the
Dons' victory over the Indians ear
lier. The U.S.F. men are very fast
and really make tracks around the
bases when they manage to get on
the bags. In the previous tilt most
of the so-called hits made by the
Dons were nothing more than bloop
ing Texas Leaguers off the handle of
the bat. It may be a different story
tomorrow with a faster infield to
contend with. There is less liability
of beating out an infield hit and this
promises to cut down the number of
Don runners who reach first base.
As neither coach has announced
starting lineups, it would merely be
a guess as to which players will take
the field. Stanford's team will un
doubtedly be the same one that bat
tled Santa Clara in the second game
' last Saturday, while U.S.F. should
| send the same team to the diamond
■ lhat they did in the first game be
| tween these two clubs.

sporting world that they have a win
ning ball club, Stanford's undaunted
nine faces the University of San
Francisco tomorrow for two games
on the Sunken Diamond. The double
header will start at 1 p.m. promptly
and since many fans missed the first
past of last Saturday's twin bill they
are advised to come early and see
all of the fine ball that is certain to
be played.
At this point U.S.F'. seems to have
a slight edge over the Reds on the
basis of their wins over St. Mary's,
who whipped the Indians earlier in
the season. They will also have the
edge in the pitching department il
they can find another starter com
parable to the versatile Con Demp
sey. Con throws everything but his
giove at opposing batters and with
a little backing up in the field he
would be the leading winner in the
league. He will be opposed by either
Jack Miller or Bernard Woody, since
the ability of Doc Mason to work is
probable. If possible Harry Wolter
would like to use him, and may yet
do so in the role of relief hurler.
The infields stack up with Stan
ford on top of the deck. Wolter has
managed to build a tight infield out
of what the armed services have left
at his call with veteran Bobby
Brown in the short patch and capable
Jay McKie at third there are very
few balls that go through to the
outer gardens.

The game should feature the hit
ting of Howie Dallmar and Lloyd
Merriman who, with Brown, com
prise the "murderers row" of the big
veam.
The Cards need improvement in
the base running end of the game
as has been demonstrated in most
of their games this season. It was
one of the deciding factors in the
Dons' victory over the Indians ear
lier. The U.S.F. men are very fast
and really make tracks around the
bases when they manage to get on
the bags. In the previous tilt most
of the so-called hits made by the
Dons were nothing more than bloop
ing Texas Leaguers off the handle of
the bat. It may be a different story
tomorrow with a faster infield to
contend with. There is less liability
of beating out an infield hit and this
promises to cut down the number of
Don runners who reach first base.
As neither coach has announced
starting lineups, it would merely be
a guess as to which players will take
the field. Stanford's team will un
doubtedly be the same one that bat
tled Santa Clara in the second game
' last Saturday, while U.S.F. should
| send the same team to the diamond
■ lhat they did in the first game be
| tween these two clubs.
