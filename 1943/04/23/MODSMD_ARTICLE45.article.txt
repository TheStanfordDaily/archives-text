# Stars Mangle Seal Pitchers
## 
### 
Hollywood's mighty Stars finally
did it. They licked the San Fran
cisco Seals. In a game that featured
a parade of pitchers from the Seal
Bullpen to the mound and then a
parade back again an inning or so
later. A1 Epperly. the hopeful, was
the losing hurler while manager
Charley Root was credited with the
Star win although he had to be re
lieved in the sixth.
This win dropped the Seals from
first place in the loop and left that
rtther dubious honor to the San
Diego Padres and the ex-cellarites,
the Portland Beavers.
