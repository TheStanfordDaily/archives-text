THIS Sunday is Easter. A Sunday for thought,
meditation, and prayer.
Easter is a big thing. It has been commem
orated for a long time. There is something that
makes one feel small and humble and insignifi
cant when he realizes that men 1500 years ago
on the same Sunday in the same surroundings
voiced a similar prayer.
The problems that confront us now seem
great, almost unsurpassable in their magnitude.
They are probably no greater to us than those
that have faced each generation of mankind
since the first Easter. Could be more confused
or threatened than was England in the seven
teenth century, or the world was in the nine
tenth century when evolution destroyed faith?
This Sunday when we go to church and sit
quietly and think, this Easter Sunday in a world
at war, it might be better to thank God for being
alive, for the sun and the warm air, to ask God
for strength to live and more than that, strength
to enjoy life—rather than for a quick and furious
conclusion to the war.
War is man's problem. Perhaps we should
pray that this war will be the last of such prob
lems and that the meek . . shall inherit the
earth."
