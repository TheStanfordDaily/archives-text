# The 						Sing This Spring
## 
### 
IN Spring Quarters past, one of the main social
events has been the Spring Sing. The differ
ent living groups with their well - practiced
songs, and the lights of the torches, and the effi
cient management of Rally Committee made it
a good affair.

Now things seem to be different. The Rally
Committee is defunct. The dimout precautions
prevent the torches, and most important of all

is the fact that many of the men's groups are
almost without men.
However, the situation is not so bad as it
might seem. Cardinals have taken over the
sing and have put Vic Ferrari at the head. Page
Mill Road, the soldiers and the campus, and
possibly those from Moffett Field will come
and sing.
There is little doubt that the women will re
spond to the call, but the men's groups are lack
ing.
The Spring Sing is a good thing, so it would
be nice if any men's group that still has fifteen
members and a good song would enter it.
