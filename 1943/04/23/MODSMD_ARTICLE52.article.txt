# BULL SESSION

### CYCLONE COVEY 
Pilate was an affable and innocuous official.
He could find nothing really punishable in what
Jesus had said or done, but he did not want to
displease anybody. He was like the average
congressman of today, for example, whose first
air is to be inoffensive to his constituents, and
second, to carry out his convictions, if any.
The chief priests who brought Jesus to trial
were parasites of society who had to keep so
ciety convinced they were indispensable. When
Jesus openly called them hypocrites, and drove
the money-changers from the temple, not only
was Pharisee prestige endangered, but the lu
crativeness of their office as well. Those ancient
parasites had much in common with certain va
rieties of individuals still to be found, who de
vote their life work to proving that their life
work is vital.
The people who clamored for the crucifixion,
at the insistence of the Pharisees, were much
like the people of today who choose not to use
their capacity for reason but blindly to follow
the pronouncements of a self-elevated hierarchy,
of one type or another; and who, by habit, also
substitute precedent, custom, a book, or other
authority, for reason of their own.
Jesus himself was a radical for his time, and
knew beforehand that to persist in his convic
tions of right would mean his death. In fact,
no one dared come to his defense; his very
disciples denied him, and by one he had been
betrayed. The chief priests were his prosecu
tors; the people yelled, "Crucify him!" the Ro
man soldiers manhandled him; he was spat on,
struck, and mocked; and on the cross he cried
out, "My God, my God, why hast thou for
saken me!"
To church Easter Sunday will go the affable
and innocuous modern Pilates, the paranoidal,
parasitic modern Pharisees, and reactionaries
and authoritarians among modern people.
They will go to commemorate their Lord's
rising from the dead; but they will think little
of why He happened to die.
