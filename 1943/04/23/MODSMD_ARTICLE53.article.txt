The Editor, Sir:
This is an answer to "Griped," obviously a
Stanford boy, about the question of rides and
socks.
The writer complained about so - called
"snooty" Stanford women who refuse to pick
up students hiking into town. Why must the
women get all the blame? It is a well-known
fact that there are more boys than girls with
cars on campus and they use them just as much.
In addition to that, men are as snooty in pick
ing up hikers as women are.
On the second point: it seems like the boys
need educating as to footwear. Some girls' shoes
just don't look well with socks, such as mocca
sins and non-rationed ropies and huaraches.
And with an eye to the war effort, the girls know
that eventually clothes are going to be rationed,
and who wants to waste precious clothes cou
pons on socks when a good tan will do just as
well?
The boys ought to stop worrying about the
girls' appearance and look after their own.
