### 
Charlie Allen, Stanford debater,
was awarded the JofTre medal for the
49th annual tournament between
Stanford and California.
Richard Wilson, California, won
second place, and Irving Tregen, of
California, received third.
The question, '"Resolved, that
French political factions were so
diametrically opposed in interests

and so hostile in attitude to each [
other that no democratic govern- j
ment was feasable in France." was !
chosen two hours before the debate j
from a general subject which all the 1
contestants had been studying for
several weeks.
Affirmative Upheld
The affirmative was upheld by
Arthur Crowe, Richard Wilson,
Charlie Allen, and Irving Tregen,
while Dan Eymann and John Sloane
defended the negative.
Throughout the debate the affirm
ative side sought to prove that po- j
litical factions in France, in creating i
disunity and making compromise
impossible, prevented a peaceable
democratic form of government in
France.
The Negative
The negative side maintained that
such political factions would not
prevent a government similar to
that of the United States in which
political factions were also present.
The Medallion was presented by
Dr. Marius A. Frantoz, president of
the Alliance Francaise of San Fran- j
cisco. In awarding the medal, which. ;
previous to the fall of France in 1940, !
was cast in the national mint of
France and warded in the name of
the Third Republic, Dr. Francoz ex- !
