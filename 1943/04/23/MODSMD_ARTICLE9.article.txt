## 
### (By United Press 
Americans in general seemed to
grow hot under the collar about th.
Japanese execution of American
flier scaptured after their raid or
Tokio, but still felt that reorisals
I should not be made directed against
American-held Japanese prisoner?
a United Press survey reported to
day.
In Washington, D.C., Undersecre
tary of War Robert P. Patterson as
sured the nation today that reprisaL
will be taken for the murder of somt
of the American fliers, but they wil
be directed against the guilty Jap
anese militaristsâ€”not Japanese war
prisoners.
Also Congress
"Reprisals for this act directec
against Japanese soldiers in ou
hands would lower us to the level o
our enemies without touching the
evil individuals who are alone re
sponsible," he told a press confer
ence.
This was also the majority reactio*
of Congress, which, however, de
manded that more attention be give,
to the Pacific war without neces
sarily revising the Allied strategy o
knocking out Hitler first.
In North Africa
In North Africa, Maj. Gen. James
H. Doolittle called on America to
day to bomb Japan until the Empire
crumbles and it begs for mercy tc
show that it failed in its aim when it
| executed some of the fliers who ac
companied him in the first raid in
history on Tokio.
Doolittle said that he and the men
who, with him, bombed Japan a year
ago wanted to go back and do it
| again on a devastating scale. "We
! will drop each bomb in memory* oi
our murdered comrades," Doolittle
| said.
Japanese Broadcast
A Japanese radio broadcast picked
i up by United Press in San Francisco
gave an implied warning Thursday
that Japan would execute any
American fliers captured in future
raids on the country and that i;
\ would retaliate by bombing Ameri
can cities.
"Don't i'orget:
"Make sure that every flier that
comes here has a special pass to
Hell," the Japanese broadcast said
"And rest assui'ed it's strictly the
one-way ticket."
