# Jewelry Needed For Native Trade
## 
### 
A campus drive to collect costume
jewelry will begin next week, under
the leadership of drive-chairmar
Nancy Nichols.
"We don't want girls to give good
jewelry to the drive," explained Miss
Nichols. ''But trinkets you no longer
wear, odd earrings, bracelets, or
necklaces would be very valuable."
The jewelry is used by the Army
for bartering in the Solomons. The
natives do not like to work for
money, but will do any sort of man
ual work for costume jewelry. They
will dig gun emplacements or
trenches; for one piece of costume
jewelry a soldier can get a native to
dig six foxholes.
