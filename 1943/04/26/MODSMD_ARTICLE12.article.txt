lie-forms Cabinet
The 1942-43 student cabinet was
headed by Janet McCcanahan, pres
ident; Betty May Hale, vice-presi
dent; Barbara Gregg, treasurer;
Peggy Shaw, secretary. However as
Janet MeClanahan was elected to
the office of A.S.S.U. vice-president,
and Betty May Hale was appointed
War Board Coordinator, it became
necessary for the Y to re-form its
cabinet.
The election was conducted by Y
representatives in the living groups,
who distributed ballots to Y mem
bers. "In making elections this
year," commented Roella Ford, head
of the nominating committee, ''the
Y followed a policy of selecting can
didates from all campus women, not
only its members."
Cabinet Meeting
New President Mary Beth Smith
will call a meeting of the old and
new cabinets sometime next week
to discuss the Y program for next
year.
This year the Y has taken over
many current problems: crop crews,
world affairs discussions, aiding the
Japanese in relocation centers,
training USO hostesses, and social
service work.
