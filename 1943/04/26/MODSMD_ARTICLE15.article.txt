### Pat Patten 
As 35 Chi Omegas, alias Easter
bunnies, tiptoed through the door of
the Stanford Convalescent Home
early Sunday morning, they found
j everything prepared for their ar
rival. In the dining room big pastel
rabbits peered from behind their
' green paper nests.
Twenty-five boys and 25 girls,
ranging from 4 to 12, were too sick
I to get out of bed to hunt for their
| eggs. "Hide quickly—he's coming
i now!" the nurse warned. Fifty heads
! dove under the pillows simultane
ously, and the pseudo Easter bunnies
j went to work.
Easter eggs in the sheets ... in
j their slippers . . . under the covers
j ... in their pillow slips! The girls
carefully made nests for their eggs;
| the boys gobbled them up uncere
j moniously.
Out on the porch, 30 boys and girls
: who were not confined in bed were
i waiting in their paper hats to hunt
i eggs. At a signal they streaked from
| the porch, over the lawn to the
j shrubs and flower beds.
"But I can't find any eggs. Every
! one else has lots and lots, and I
don't have any." Jerry, blue-eyed
and tearful, had been left out. Tact
| ful Chi Omegas borrowed eggs from
j more successful hunters to re-hide
S them for Jerry. "Now look under

that tree—l'm sure I saw the Easter
bunny over there." And Jerry had
his eggs.
It is a Chi Omega tradition to have
an Easter party at the Convalescent
Home every year. Each jackrabbit
that crossed the grounds last week
was a prospective Easter bunny to
the children.
