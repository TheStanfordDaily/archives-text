# TUESDAY SERIES
## Mumford Talk Tops Program 
### 
The next program of the Tuesday
Evening Series will be a tribute to
the great scientists, Copernicus, Ga
lileo, and Newton, and will be given
April 27 at 7:30 in the Memorial
Auditorium. Lewis Mumford, pro
lessor of Humanities, will speak of
the relation of science to the Hu
manities, and Frederick O. Koenig,
associate professor of Chemistry,
will formulate the tribute of the
scientists to these great men.
The years 1942 and 1943 com
memorate important dates in the es
tablishment of modern science. In
1543 Copernicus, the founder of mod
ern astronomy, died. In 1642, the
great Italian physicist, Galileo Ga
lilei, died, and Isaac Newton was
born.
In commemorating these various
dates Stanford joins other universi
ties throughout the world in honor
ing the memory of the three men
whose work as scientists was de
cisive, not merely in establishing the
methods of modern science, but also
in building up the conception of an
ordered universe, whose detailed
workings could be explored by the
scientific method.
Even in war-torn England, says
Mr. Mumford, the observation of
Newton's birthday has been displayed
in many different exercises and trib
utes in honor of his great achieve
ment.
