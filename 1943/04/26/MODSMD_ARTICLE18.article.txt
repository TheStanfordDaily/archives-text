# Forum Treats Reconstruction
## 
### 
Post-wur problems was the topic
discussed by Professor Lewis Mum
ford, head of the Humanities Depart-
J ment and noted authority on man
| and machine, when he addressed the
i Student-Faculty Forum at 4:45 yes
terday afternoon at Lagunita.
Professor Mumford stressed the
| fact that the post-war reconstruc
tion period will be one of unlimited
opportunities. The real problem is
t whether or not we will take advan
tage of these opportunities which
will be made possible by the sol
i diers who will return after the war.

The people must undergo an "in
ner-change," he, said, before they
can tackle the reconstruction prob
lem realistically, and the soldiers
who are fighting this war will have
the first opportunity and the great
est need to undergo this change.
Other topics discussed were leader
ship, imperialism, and training for
reconstruction work. Professor
Mumford clarified many of the
questions of the students and
brought forth some extremely good
ideas pointing the way for a better
world after the war.
