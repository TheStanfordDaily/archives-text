# Stanford Tracksters Smear Fresno State by 34 Points
## Fulton, Pattee Win Doubles 
### Ed Luce 
The times were not amazing, but
the score—Stanford 82 M», Fresno
State 48 l /> —was. So runs the story
of Saturday afternoon's Indian vs.
Bulldog track meet, the first dual
affair a home squad has won since
1941.
Pitch Johnson's boys capitalized
on the lack of Fresno depth in most
events to nab 8 first places, 11 sec
onds, and SV2 thirds during the aft
ernoon.
True, Fresno's great hurdler and
broad jumper, Louis Futrell, didn't
compete because of a sprained back.
Neither did Lee Schroeder, weight
man. Their presence might have
made the meet closer, but wouldn't
have changed the final outcome.
A stiff wind blowing in his face
most of the way, Stanford's Johnny
Fulton hustled off the 440 without
any competition in :49.4. Fulton came
back later to win the 220 by a foot
in :22.5, for one of the two double
wins of the day.
Stanford ran up a commanding
lead in the first two events, when
Bob Compton and Dave Bills ran
one-two in a 4:30.2 mile, and Fulton
and Dud Cramer did the same in the
quarter,
Al Pantfe, Indian javelin thrower,
and Fresno's Bob Carlsen turned in
the outstanding marks in the field
events. Pande's winning throw of
191 feet, 10 Va inches was the best
heave made on the Coast this year.
Carlsen got over 13 feet in winning
the pole vault.
Double winner in addition to Ful
