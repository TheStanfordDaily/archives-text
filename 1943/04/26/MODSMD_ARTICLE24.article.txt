# INDIANS LOSE
## Pre-Flighters Score Six Runs In Second Inning to Win, 9-3 
### Late Williams 
It was all over, as far as the In
; dians were concerned, when the sec-
I ond inning of the Stanford - St.
j Mary's Pre-Flight baseball game
I came to an end.
In that canto the Pre-Flighters
bunched five hits, three walks, and
capitalized on a Card error to score
six runs. As the game progressed,
they drove three more counters
across the plate, while Stanford hit
the scoreboard for a trio of runs.
The final score —St. Mary's Pre-
Flight 9, Stanford 3.
Woody Relieved
Bernard Woody, the Indians' start
ing pitcher, let the visitors down
with a single hit in the first, strug
gled through the fateful second, and
was replaced by Jack Miller in the
third.
Miller pitched tight ball for the
remaining six innings, relaxing only
long enough to allow one Navy run
I in each of the fifth, eighth, and ninth
innings.
>1 iHer Hits
Bill Wight, Airmen pitcher, com
pletely tied-up the Stanford batters
for four innings, allowing no hits,
and only one man to reach first base.
In the fifth. Miller got the first hit,
but his effort went for naught. In
the sixth, however, the Indians com
bined a sharp single by Bob Brown
and a smashing double by Ed Wash
burn to score their first tally.
The eighth saw Stanford's final
two runs rung up on the scoreboard.
With two away. Howie Dallmar drew
I a walk, advancing to second on
Ward Walkup's safety. Both runners
moved when Jay McKie stopped a

fast ball with his arm, and loaded
the bases.
Doc Mason, who had replaced
Keith Pinion in centerfield in the
seventh, came through with a hit
which sent Dallmar and Walkup
home. That was all for the Indians.
