# Our Paper
## 
### 
THIS is the Freshman Edition, our attempt to
show the older members of The Daily staff
how easy it is to put out the paper. We started
rather timidly, never expecting to be able to
imitate those who have been our bosses up to
now. But it wasn't as difficult as we thought it
would be.
We have had fun putting out this issue, and
we are proud of our efforts, even though this
paper may not follow closely all the strict
points of journalism technique. Instead of the
normal staff of over 40 members, eight people
combined their various talents on this edition.
Today we will step out of our exalted edi
torial positions, return the keys to the editor's
office, and once more become copyreaders and
reporters ready to follow the commands of the
regular staff. Our paper is printed. The dream
is over. But we have learned a lot about The
Daily, and the experience will someday be very
valuable.â€”Joan Hodgdon
