# New Soldiers Are Coming
## 
### 
MORE soldiers are coming to Stanford.
Three hundred STAR unit soldiers are
arriving this week. What will be the effect of
these new arrivals upon Stanford civilians?
Ever since the first contingent of soldiers
entered Seguoia Hall last week, Stanford stu
dents have become more and more aware of the
presence of uniforms on campus. We have
seen STAR unit soldiers marching on Quad,
and dancing at the Lagunita-Union formal. We
also saw many of them in Chapel yesterday.
In one short week we have begun to consider
these men in uniform as Stanford students.
We are getting acguainted with them, and they
are getting to know Stanford.
This is principally due to the work of the
USO and the Stanford War Board, who have
organized the welcome given the soldiers.
They arranged dates for Saturday's formal,
guide tours on Sunday, open houses, and an
information booth.
By giving a welcome like this to 200 soldiers,
the USO is showing just how easily 300 more
soldiers will be received. The cooperation,
however, of the entire student body is needed
to make these new arrivals welcome. They may
seem curious to us at first, and we may want to
stare. Some girls may even want to snub them,
because they are in uniform and may not seem
like regular Stanford men.
But they are all very much like our own
friends from Stanford who have entered the
Army recently. They are anxious to make
friends and are probably well worth knowing.
Let's welcome them as Stanford students. They
will not be here long, and, when they leave,
we want them to carry with them pleasant
memories of their life at Stanford.
