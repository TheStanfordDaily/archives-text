"The heck with '46! she said. "Raising cain
in the Civ Libe, playing jacks on Quad. Who'd
they think they were—going to Dinah's, being
initiated into fraternities, hanging pins before
they were dry behind the ears?"
"A bunch of kids," she said. "Where is the
professional Stanford Rough, where is the so
phisticated Cardinal woman, where are the
smooth convertibles, the classy country club
dances, the tweed jackets and the pipes—the
sensational parties?"
That's tough Senior woman. Maybe the mad
whirl has boiled down to a slow simmer for you,
but for us who have never known bigger things,
college and our freshman year seem mighty
big. Having the Cellar closed at night hasn't
cramped our style. We'd rather have a picnic
in a ramshackle country club that hasn't had a
stick of furniture in it for 10 years, than dinner,
the theater, and dancing to a big name-band at
the Frantic. We'd rather sing "Margie," loud
and flat—probably because we've never learned
to sing the "Whiffenpoof Song" soft and sweet
—but who wouldn't change a dozen black
sheep for a gal like Margie.
We've grown closer to Stanford than most
Frosh classes, because we know our stay is
short and sweet. Our men can't study feverishly
to be graduated before they don a uniform.
Graduation is too far away. That day in June
1946 will likely be a field day for women—but
it won't be the Class of '46. It's the gang on
Quad this morning that we will remember and
always call our class at college.
We are not disappointed about the condi
tions under which we have gone to Stanford,
or envious of the Upper Classmen who have
seen more gramorous days. We're proud and
thankful for all that we have learned here. We'll
stay as long as we can and come back when the
war is over to support Stanford for the rest of
our lives.

We are not disappointed about the condi
tions under which we have gone to Stanford,
or envious of the Upper Classmen who have
seen more gramorous days. We're proud and
thankful for all that we have learned here. We'll
stay as long as we can and come back when the
war is over to support Stanford for the rest of
our lives.
