The Editor, Sir:
I think that it showed poor taste for The
Daily to print the statement in the story about
Stanford girls inviting STAR unit men to the
Lagunita-Union Formal which said, and I guote,
"The girls . . . have declared that since their
men are in the armed services, they will be glad
to ask a soldier to the dance."
What is this, a charity ball? This statement
sounds like the girls who take soldiers to the
dance are doing something which should be
bravely borne with chins up, and all in memory
of their own soldier who is far, far away.
This is the kind of pseudo-patriotic spirit
which makes many soldiers shy away from
USO affairs—they're afraid they'll come up
against a girl who plainly shows that she's only
there because she thinks it's her patriotic duty.
If the truth were known, at least 99 per cent
of the girls who took STARS to the formal did
so because they wanted to go and have a good
time themselves. And why not? That's why
everyone else went.
The War Board is dong a fine job in ar
ranging dates for the STAR members.—B.B.

The Editor, Sir:
I'm getting tired of reading some of these
corny letters to the editor. In the past the col
umn has been one of the best in the paper,
mainly because the student body showed some
interest in their University. Now, all they care
about is whether girls' ankles are covered or
not. Why doesn't somebody wise up?
Wised Up

The Editor, Sir:
Why argue? We may have the untidy Stan
ford Rough, but we'll always have the Stanford
Bag. And the fellows can tidy up.
One Who Doesn't Care.
