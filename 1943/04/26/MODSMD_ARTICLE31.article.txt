Remnants of the April 17 Phi Delt
Burn Dance flared up again at 2:30
a.m. Saturday, April 24. A hay
wagon from the party which was on
the lawn in front of the house sud
denly burst into flame.
Men in the house noticed the fire,
and went out to combat it with a
garden hose. One truck from the
campus fire station came to the aid
of the Phi Delts, and after 10 min
utes the fire was under control. The
wagon was only partially damaged,
but the hay was a complete loss.
A tin can bearing evidences of
gasoline was found near the scene,
and gave rise to some speculation as
to the origin of the fire, according to
Bob Sears.
