# Muni Film Shows Commando Action
## 
### 
THE COMMANDOS STRIKE AT
DAWN is striking for the last time
today at the Varsity. At risk of con
tradicting the Brothers Warner, we
might mention that the picture is
more concerned with the Nazi in
vasion of a Norwegian village than
with the Commandos.
The final scenes of a Commando at
tack upon a Nazi airport on the Nor
wegian coast highlighted the movie.
Some good attempts at art,
such as Norwegians bewildered by
their plight, and some typical Holly
woodian maize, such as Muni dang
ling by a well-rope, his daughter
about his neck, while a Nazi officer
searches above, are held together by
the forcefulness of Paul Muni's
characterization.
BCATBERGOOD SURVIVES A
MURDER at least puts a wig on
Guy Kibbee and is short.â€”Giannini
