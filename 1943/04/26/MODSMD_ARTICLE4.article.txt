# Students Must Have Cards to Cash Checks
## 
### 
"I've hoard more hard luck
stories al>out why students don't
have their student body cards
when they want to cash a check
than I have time to tell." said Mr.
William Giuither of the cigar
counter in the Cellar.
Even the familiar sick grand
mother story came into play as
one student recounted desperately
how he had paid her a visit and
left the necessary card on her bed
side table.
