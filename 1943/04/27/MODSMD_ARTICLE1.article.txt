### 
LONDON, April 26 (UP)â€”Russia
broke diplomatic relations with Pol
and tonight claiming that Poland had
stabbed her in the back by asking
the International Red Cross to in
vestigate German allegations that
Russia executed 10,000 Polish officers
in 1940.
A Polish embassy spokesman said
that Polish ambassador Taduez Ro
mer had left Moscow.
In a scornful note to the Polish
government in exile here, Russia
charged that while it was bearing
the brunt of the war Poland had
seized on the German propaganda to
deal a treacherous blow in hope that
she might grab Russian territory.
Russia charged further that the simi
larity of German and Polish attacks
on Russia showed that there was
contact between the Germans and
the Poles.
Russia foreign commissar, Vyas
chelav Molotov handed Romer a note
which reviewed Poland's action and
German propaganda after the Ger
mans had made the allegations about
the execution of Polish prisoners.
It is Russia's contention that the
Germans themselves murdered the
Polish officers after capturing them
when the Nazis overran the Smol
ensk area. "It is known to the So
viet government," the note said, "that
this hostile campaign against the
Soviet Union has been undertaken
by the Polish government with the
aim of exerting pressure on the So
viet government using Hitler's slan
derous falsification in order to
snatch territorial concessions at the
cast of the Soviet Ukraine, Soviet
White Russia, and Soviet Lithuania.
