# Dodds Talks At Pomona On 'Realities'
## 
### 
America's real danger within the
next decade is "not that we shall
lose the war, but that we shall write
a peace which will make present
victory in eanin g 1 e s s," John W.
Dodds. Dean of Stanford University
School of Humanities, told the Pa
cific Coast's first 1943 spring term
graduating class at Pomona College's
50th annual commencement exer- ,
cises here today.
Speaking on "Realities in Time of
Crisis," Dean Dodds warned,
"Whether we like it or not, we shall
live in a global world in the future —
intellectually as well as geographi
cally. It therefore behooves us to
extend our sympathy and under
standing beyond our own borders.
If we are to protect ourselves, we
must have, even at the very lowest
level, a sense of world responsibility
and interdependence.
"We have learned bitterly, through
experience, that when Poles or
Czehcs or Greeks are murdered, we,
too, die a little. When freedom is
strangled in Norway or Holland or
China, the freedom of Bangor and
Baltimore and Natchez and Spring
field and Cheyenne breathes less
easily.
"The Chinese must be for us not
merely a quaint little people, child
-1 ish and amusing. We must become
aware of them as the great and noble
and courageous defenders of a great
civilization. It has taken the pres
sures of war to make us recognize
what v/e have often been too blind
to see.
