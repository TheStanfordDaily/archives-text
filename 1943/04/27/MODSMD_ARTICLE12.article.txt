# Nitery Dance Planned Friday
## 
### 
"All you have to do is find the
Nitery to enjoy the Nitery House
warming, Friday from 8:30 to 11:30,"
said Cally Curtis, dance chairman.
"The dance is free and all that is
required is your presence," she con
tinued. "We wish that people would
bring old magazines, records, and
ping pong balls to replenish the sup
ply that is already on hand so that
we will have a supply of these for
entertainment in the future."
"We want everybody to come to
the Nitery and enjoy themselves; and
to make a habit of coming for we
can have a good time there and save
the gas we use to go off campus in
search of entertainment."
