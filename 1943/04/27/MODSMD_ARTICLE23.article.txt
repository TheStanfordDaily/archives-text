# Return the Bottles
## 
### 
D'JE to the war there is a shortage of coke bottles.- This is
just one in a long list of shortages, but it is one which we
can do something to help. Unless all coke bottles are returned
to the machine from which they came, so that they may be taken
back to the manufacturers and, after sterilization, reused, we may
not have any cokes. Cokes are a small thing in life, but a nice
small thing. Most people feel better if they can take time off
now and then and go and drink a coke. But next time you take
.such time off remember to return the bottle so that you and
everyone else can continue to have cokes.â€”Lucile Thompson
