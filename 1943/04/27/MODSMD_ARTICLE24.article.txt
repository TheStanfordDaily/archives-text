### 
THE soldiers are finally coming to Stanford. There will be 500
here by the end of this week, and 400 more will arrive
Monday.
It has been hard to visualize soldiesr at Stanford, but they
•nave come and they are coming. This will be just the beginning.
There will soon be twice as many STARS at Stanford. There will
he twice as many engineers and three times as many psychology
and three times as many area studies students. And then there
will be pre-medical students and there will be Far Eastern area
studies students. The Army is just beginning to come to Stan
ford.—Lucile Thompson
