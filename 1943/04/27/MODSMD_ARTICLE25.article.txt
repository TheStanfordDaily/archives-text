### CYCLONE COVEY 
In Stanford's track meet with Fresno State Saturday, the mile,
as usual, was won by Bob Compton. Here is how various de
partments of The Daily might have written up the race . . .
Sports reporter. Bob "Burn 'em Out" Compton took wings on
Angell Field Saturday to breast the tape a half lap ahead of his
nearest competitor in a slightly stiff wind. Unpressed from the
start, he failed to spurt in the stretch but ground out a 4:30.2 time
nevertheless.
Review editor. It was a breath-taking spring day, with ex
hilarating ocean breezes and soft, scintillating sunlight bathing
the runners as they glided smoothly and rhythmically like Greek
statues doing a marathon, the soul-satisfying thud of hoofs on
the cinder bed. . . .
Editorial. Robert Compton, plus 300, has proved once again
that scholarship and athletics can go together. Once again this
has been proved. It is just anofher way of saying the will to win
and the will to want to win. That is all there ever is to winning
laurels for the good old alma mater. Once again this is proved.

Campus Opinion, from a Stanford professor. The Editor, Sir:
What is the younger generation coming to? Rather, to what is
the younger generation coming? The other afternoon while
taking my daily afternoon promenade, I came upon an appalling
spectacle. There before me was a group of students running
around in circles in their drawers. And when they got tired and
stopped, the one in front was applauded as if he had just finished
a soliloquy from "Hamlet." One Who Glares.
