vakian Consul.
As a refugee in England, Dr. Fier

continent.
Commenting on the food situation

Czechoslovakia in 1939.
In his closing words. Dr. Fierband
said, "We Czechs have lost every
thing, but we have never lost faith
in ultimate victory; a faith to which
the gallant Londoners have con
tributed greatly."
Following Dr. Fierband's talk,
Dr. Benes, son of the former presi
dent of Czechoslovakia, gave a trib
ute to the Czech students whose uni
versities were closed by Hitler in
1939, and who for four years have
performed hard labor in Germany
rather than studying in the schools
of which they had been so justly
proud.
