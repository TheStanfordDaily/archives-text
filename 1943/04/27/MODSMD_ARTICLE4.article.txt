## 
### Esther Belew 
Dr. Graham Stuart, profesor of political science, returned yesterday from
a three-day trip to Southern California during which he spoke at the
13th annual session of the Women's Civic Conference at the University of
Southern California on April 22.
Dr. Stuart and Dr. W. K. Jordan, professor of history from the University

of Chicago, gave the colloquy on
"What Form of Internationad Or
ganization Would Best Suit the Post
war Aims of the United States." The
two professors gave their views and
then the meeting was opened for
questions and discussion from the
floor.
In his address. Dr. Stuart dealt
with the form of international or
ganization which, he thought, the
United States would accept after the
war; in doing this he discussed the
fundamental objections which the
United States had toward the League
Covenant and gave answers for
these objections.
Principal Objection
"The principal objection was a
disinclination to mix in European
affairsâ€”a hangover from our long
established, through questionable
policy, of isolation," according to Dr.
Stuart. "The second objection was
the fear lest the league might violate
the Monroe Doctrine," Dr. Stuart
said.
A regional league of the republics
in the Western Hemisphere would
solve both of these questions, accord
ing to Dr. Stuart, as the United
States can never be isolated from
Latin America. The Monroe Doc
trine is now a joint policy of pro
tection, he added.
Form of Cooperation
Statements have been made by the
President, Vice-President, senators,
congressmen, and leading citizens as
to the form of international cooper
ation," said Dr. Stuart, "and from
these have come also such specific
pvoposals as the Atlantic Charter,
the report of the Inter-American
Juridical Committee, and the reports
from the Committee to Study Or
ganization of Peace "

Universal Organization
In conclusion Dr. Stuart said that
the United States will accept a Uni
versal Organization if it is flexible
and provides for restricted political
power, sanctions, and a regional
league for the Western Hemisphere.
Dr. Stuart's talk was based on an
article written by himself in the
March issue of "Current History" in
reply to an inquiry of the editor to
a number of historians, political
scientists, and others as to their
ideas of a post-war world and their
proposals and suggestions for ways
to put their ideas into effect.
In his article Dr. Stuart outlined
his proposed program for the post
war world and gave the principles
which he considers essential for per
manent peace and*the machinery
which he thinks necessary to pre
serve the peace.
Suggested Principles
The following principles were sug
gested by Dr. Stuart in his article in
"Current History" as a minimum re
quirement for international order:
"The renunciation of war as an
instrument of national and inter
national policy, the peaceful settle
ment of international disputes, the
non-intervention of any state in the
internal or external affairs of an
other.
Consent of Governed
Acceptance and observance of the
principles of international law based
upon international morality, gov
ernments must derive their just
powers from the consent of the gov
erned, access on equal terms to trade,
raw materials, and the international
highways of the world, and the re
duction of national armaments to
the lowest point consistent with na
tional saiety "
