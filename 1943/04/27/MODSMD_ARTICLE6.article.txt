# RESERVES
## Woman Marine To Talk Here 
### 
Lieutenant Hutcheon of the Ma
rine women's reserve will speak to
all interested junior and senior
women tomorrow night at 7:15 in the
downstairs lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse on the qualifications
necessary and the opportunities of
fered for women enlisting in the
corps.
Although 110 definite program has
been announced, there is a possi
bility that the Marines will offer a
reserve plan for senior women in
college similar to those instituted by
the WAVES and the WAACS.
Created a few months ago. the
women's reserve of the Marine Corps
is headed by Major Ruth Cheney
Streeter. Like the other women's
reserves, it is intended to place
women in men's posts behind the
lines so that the men will be free for
combat duty.
Women in the Marines receive the
same ranks, pay and other advan
tages as the men in the corps. They
are also subject to overseas duty.
Barbara Bassett, assisted by Wom
en's Vocom, is in charge of arrange
ments for the meeting. Following
Lieutenant Hutcheon's talks, mem
bers of the audience will be invited
to ask questions.
This is the second meeting at
which campus women will hear rep
resentatives of the various women's
reserves. Last fall, Lieut. Madelyn
Miller and Mary McGlynn of the
WAAC spoke to a group in the
Women's Clubhouse. Vocom also
sponsored a program on women's
reserves.
