# Army Units To Arrive Monday
## Soldiers To Remain One to Five Terms 
### 
Four hundred Army specialists
will arrive here Monday, May 3, for
advanced training in engineering, in
foreign area and language, and in
personnel psychology, Maj. Gen.
Kenyon A. Joyce, commanding offi
cer of the Ninth Service Command
at Fort Douglas, Utah, announced
yesterday.
Of this first group of soldiers, 200
will take advanced engineering, 100
will study personnel psychology, and
100 will be trained in European area
and language studies.
Additional Groups
Instruction is scheduled to begin
on May 10 for this initial group.
Additional groups will later be sent
to Stanford for training in these
fields, in pre-medicine and in Far
Eastern area and language studies.
The advanced training units will
be housed, as far as possible at
Branner Hall, Col. Harry B. Allen,
commanding officer of all Army
units at Stanford, declared yester
day. In the meantime, however, it
has been necessary to temporarily
put some of the STAR unit in Bran
ner.
One Hundred More
There are 300 of the STAR unit
now on campus. One hundred more
I will arrive today and another hun
j dred will arrive tomorrow. These
: soldiers are assigned to Stanford for
assignment and reclassification and
will be later sent to advanced train
ing units.
While the STAR unit members
will remain at Stanford for from one
month to one day, Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur dec>ared that the sol
diers who are receiving advanced
training will remain for "from one
I to five quarters."
European Area Group
The European area and language
j studies group is the first such group
to be established on the Pacific Coast
and the second in the nation. Dr.
1 Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of poli
j tical science, has been named di
j rector of the school.
The objective of the school Ls to
give Army trainees a thorough
grounding in knowledge and under
standing of the area. They will also
be schooled in military policy as it
affects relations between the United

The soldiers will develop a speak
ing knowledge of the language and
will learn about the national re
sources and developed facilities of
the area.

personnel and in the evaluation of
the training.
Negotiations are now under way
to offer further advanced psychology
training at Stanford. Dr. Paul R.
Farnsworth, professor of psychology,
is the director of the school.
2(10 Engineers
The 200 advanced engineering
trainees will be distributed among
the chemical, civil, electrical, and
mechanical engineering schools. It
has not as yet been announced in
what proportion the soldiers will be
divided.
According to Dr. Samuel B. Mor
ris, dean of the School of Engineer
ing. the purpose of the program is to
supply engineers for all branches of
the Army. The men will study at
Stanford for three or four quarters,
depending on the type of engineering
for which they arc chosen. Dean
Morris is the director of the Army
engineering school.
"Cadet System"
The advanced specialist units will
be organized and operated under the
"cadet system," General Joyce of the
Ninth Service Command announced
last week.
The cadets will be divided into the
regular military units.

for which they arc chosen. Dean
Morris is the director of the Army
engineering school.
"Cadet System"
The advanced specialist units will
be organized and operated under the
"cadet system," General Joyce of the
Ninth Service Command announced
last week.
The cadets will be divided into the
regular military units.
Four hundred Army specialists
will arrive here Monday, May 3, for
advanced training in engineering, in
foreign area and language, and in
personnel psychology, Maj. Gen.
Kenyon A. Joyce, commanding offi
cer of the Ninth Service Command
at Fort Douglas, Utah, announced
yesterday.
Of this first group of soldiers, 200
will take advanced engineering, 100
will study personnel psychology, and
100 will be trained in European area
and language studies.
Additional Groups
Instruction is scheduled to begin
on May 10 for this initial group.
Additional groups will later be sent
to Stanford for training in these
fields, in pre-medicine and in Far
Eastern area and language studies.
The advanced training units will
be housed, as far as possible at
Branner Hall, Col. Harry B. Allen,
commanding officer of all Army
units at Stanford, declared yester
day. In the meantime, however, it
has been necessary to temporarily
put some of the STAR unit in Bran
ner.
One Hundred More
There are 300 of the STAR unit
now on campus. One hundred more
I will arrive today and another hun
j dred will arrive tomorrow. These
: soldiers are assigned to Stanford for
assignment and reclassification and
will be later sent to advanced train
ing units.
While the STAR unit members
will remain at Stanford for from one
month to one day, Chancellor Ray
Lyman Wilbur dec>ared that the sol
diers who are receiving advanced
training will remain for "from one
I to five quarters."
European Area Group
The European area and language
j studies group is the first such group
to be established on the Pacific Coast
and the second in the nation. Dr.
1 Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of poli
j tical science, has been named di
j rector of the school.
The objective of the school Ls to
give Army trainees a thorough
grounding in knowledge and under
standing of the area. They will also
be schooled in military policy as it
affects relations between the United
j States and the people of the area.
The soldiers will develop a speak
ing knowledge of the language and
will learn about the national re
sources and developed facilities of
the area.
Personnel Psychology
The personnel psychology unit will
be given two quarters of advanced
study. Each of the soldiers has al
ready had college training in psy
chology.
The curriculum of the school has
been designed to train the men in
the techniques and procedures used
by the Army in the selection, classi
fication, and assignment of military
personnel and in the evaluation of
the training.
Negotiations are now under way
to offer further advanced psychology
training at Stanford. Dr. Paul R.
Farnsworth, professor of psychology,
is the director of the school.
2(10 Engineers
The 200 advanced engineering
trainees will be distributed among
the chemical, civil, electrical, and
mechanical engineering schools. It
has not as yet been announced in
what proportion the soldiers will be
divided.
According to Dr. Samuel B. Mor
ris, dean of the School of Engineer
ing. the purpose of the program is to
supply engineers for all branches of
the Army. The men will study at
Stanford for three or four quarters,
depending on the type of engineering
