## Speeches by Mumford, Koenig Will Honor Great Scientists 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
Tonight's Tuesday Series program will be a tribute to the great scien
ists, Copernicus, Galileo Galilei, and Isaac Newton. Frederick O. Koenig,
associate professor of chemistry, will formulate the tribute of the scientists
o these men, while Lewis Mumford, professor of humanities, will speak

Lives and Work
Mr. Koenig will discuss the lives
tnd work of these three men from
the point of view of their contri
butions to science.
He says, "Two of the principal fea
tures of science are law and experi
mental method. Historically con
sidered, law came into science
through astronomy, and experimen
tal method, through dynamics.
"Among the pioneers of astro
nomical law, none are greater than
Copernicus and Newton., Galileo, on
the other hand, is the creator of ex
perimental method. I shall consider
their work from this point of view."
Important Dates
According to Dr. Mumford, the
years 1942 and '43, commemorate
important dates in the establishment
of modern science. Four centuries
ago, Copernicus, the founder of mod

In honoring the memory of the

was decisive, not merely in estab
lishing the methods of modern sci

Stanford joins other universities
throughout the world.
