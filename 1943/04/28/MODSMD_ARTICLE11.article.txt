### 
Mr. Irwin Abrams, instructor in
{ history, led the discussion yesterday
j at the third meeting of the World
i Affairs group of the Y.W.C.A. at 4:15
I p.m. in the Women's Clubhouse. Mr.
I Abrams spoke on the reconstruction
[ and rehabilitation work of the Quak
; ers in this and the First World War.
Mr. Abrams began his talk with a
I picture of the world as he thought
I it would be if peace were to come
tomorrow. He used for his example
! a port in Poland and described the
| conditions in which the city would
be and what methods would have
| to be used to return the city to
| peacetime conditions.
"The political leaders would all be
killed or in concentration camps, the
buildings would be wrecked by
! bombs, the economic basis would be
broken down, the city would be
filled with refugees returning from
concentration camps, and the trans
j portation system would be ruined,"
I said Mr. Abrams.
The re-establishment of the eco
nomic and political life of the city
is one of the important parts of re
| construction, according to Mr. Ab-
i f ams. He also stressed the need for
! the restoration of the family units
j which have been broken during the
war. The satisfaction of elementary
human needs is also a major prob-
I lem. added Mr. Abrams.
This meeting is one of the series
i being given this quarter on post
war planning. The meetings are
held weekly at the Tuesday hour.
