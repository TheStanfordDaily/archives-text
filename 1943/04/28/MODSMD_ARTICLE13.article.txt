## Mumford, Koenig Pay Tribute To Three Great Scientists 
### 
Stanford paid a tribute to itself last night on the Tuesday Evening
Series program when it honored the anniversary of three of the greatest
men in scientific history, Copernicus, Galileo, and Newton.
Lynn T. White, Jr., professor of history, phrased it, "It is fitting that
Stanford should celebrate this anniversary, because it has an old scientific

â–º"tradition," The college people of the
nation looked with disapproval when
the young university appointed Dr.
David Starr Jordan, a natural scien
tist. as its president.
As it then took the lead in recog
nizing the significance of a new field,
j so it again took the lead in righting
I the balance, when going against the
current it established its School of
| Humanities.
Professor Lewis Mumford, leading
J representative of the humanities, not
! only on our campus but in America,
| voiced an appreciation for the work
, of the honored men.
They have made aesthetic and
| moral contributions, he said, "by
; capturing the significance of reCur
! rent events, and created a sense of
j an ordered universe that flows into
every field of life." The moral con
tribution has "displaced the limita
tion of a self-contained ego and cre
j ated an impersonal one that science
makes respond to facts and not dis
! tort the truth."
Mr. Mumford said he emphasized
| these things when "the war was
' closing down the spirit of world co
operation." We who are outside the
pressure to any degree should look
j before and after," he keynoted.
Frederick O. Koenig, associate
i professor of chemistry, presented
! the achievements of each of the
men, saying that they "opened the
road to free thought that was ex
| pressed in the French revolution
| and in democracy."
