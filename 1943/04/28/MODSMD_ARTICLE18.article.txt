# Cardinals Dance Set for Friday
## 
### 
With the Cellor closed at night,
the only available place on Quad
to have a coke date is the Nitery.
But, surprisingly, many students
have not yet found the Nitery.
Foundâ€”they have neither located it
nor discovered that it is the place
to go on the way home from the
Libe for an informal Friday eve
ning.
To overcome these difficulties, Car
dinals is sponsoring a housewarm
ing there April 30. After solving the
greatest mystery around school and
having found where the Nitery is
(map to appear in Thursday's Daily)
remember these important facts.
1. The dance is this Friday night
from 8:30 to 11:30 in the NITERY.
2. Get a dale.
3. The dance is free.
4. Cokes and cake will be served
free.
5. You will have a good time get
ting acquainted with the campus'
newest night spot.
The dance committee is headed by
1 Cally Curtis, Cardinal member.
