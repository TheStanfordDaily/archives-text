# Harry Moloney's Boys Learn Sportsmanship
## 
### 
The year 1943 marks the 25th
anniversary of another of Stan
ford's great traditions, the young
boys' gym class of Harry Maloney.
Mr. Maloney first began this course
for young boys on the Stanford
campus and from Palo Alto in 1916,
with an enrollment of only 34.
This number has multiplied many
times through the years until it
is now the highest in its history,
185.
The class has become very popu
lar, especially with the children of
alumni and faculty of the Farm.
So widespread has been its ac
claim that the present class in
cludes boys from as far as San
Francisco and Oakland.
Looking through the files of for
mer Stanford athletic greats, one
finds numbers of them who re
ceived their introduction to sports
under Mr. Maloney's direction.
Many of these names are familiar
from more than one standpoint, for
most of them are sons of noted
Stanford alumni.
Saturday Class
The course is for boys from 8 to
15 years of age and is held every
Saturday morning at the Encina
Gym. The schedule emphasizes
posture exercises, competition in
group sports, and especially swim
ming. No boy is permitted to go
through the course without being

able to swim across the short
width of the pool.
To instruct the lads in the aquatic
sport this season, Maloney has em
ployed national champion Emmett
Cash in for swimming and Dick
Williams for diving. His other
aides are also well known in the
Farm's athletic picture. Harry
Shipkey for softball, Marchie
Schwartz for football. Howie Dall
mar and John Eikelmann for bas
ketball, and Maloney, himself, for
boxing.
The boys report at the gym at 9
a.m. sharp on Saturday mornings
where they meet in the apparatus
room waiting for the instructor.
When Mr. Maloney enters the room
and blows one blast on his whistle
the lads don't move, no matter
where they are. until the release
blast a moment later.
Form Ranks
Forming lines they then march
out on to the basketball floor where
ranks are formed and a few mili
tary directions given. From the
hardwoods to the fresh air is the
next move, and here the assistants
begin their part in the program.
Under the leadership of Maloney
the boys do simple physical exer
cises, designed primarily to built
up their weak muscles and aid their
posture.
Following this drill the different
instructors take over in earnest.

dividing the group up and each
squad going its way for baseball,
basketball or what have you for an
hour or so. Then to the pool, every
last one, for the weekly swim un
der the watchful eyes of the whole
staff.
Every two weeks the group
changes its schedule and the bas
ketball addicts turn to baseball or
boxing or any other sport that
meets their fancy, while the base
ball players may take up basket
ball. One thing is certain, each
group must take its turn in the
swimming pool and this insistence
has brought splendid results.
Develop Swimmers
For many years most of the
mainstays of the Palo Alto High
swimming team have been ex
members of Maloney's course. In
turn, many of these boys have
come to Stanford and continued
their successes. ■
Mr. Maloney has one main ob
jective in mind in holding these
classes. That is sportsmanship. He
believes that being a gentleman
and a sport is a very great goal to
reach in life, and to follow up this
belief he impregnates the two
ideals into his course very strongly.
The respect of parents and of
elders plays an integral part, as
does the ability to cooperate with
others both on and off the athletic
field.
Impressive Talks
One has only to listen to the
short talks given by Maloney be
fore exercising the lads any Satur
day morning to see the impression
that his words carry with them—
children of only 8 years listening
with eager ears to everything that
he has to say and endeavoring to
remember it and practice it in their
daily life.
Such a start in life is enviable to
any youngster and all of the boys
realize that fact. Any misde
meanor or failure to live up to the
principles of the master is pun
ished by being dropped from the
class. The impact of this verdict to
a member of the class is catastro
phic and consequently, besides
their sound reasoning, the words
of advice are taken to heart.
Famous Graduates
Many of the members of past
classes are now in the armed serv
ices all over the face of the world.
Despite the spreading of his ex
pupils, Mr. Maloney still hears
from them frequently. Scarcely a
week goes by that he does not re
ceive a letter or read an article
that one of his boys has performed
some deed of heroism and been
decorated or has been cited for
being outstanding in a certain
field. Sometimes the news is not
quite so cheerful, and no man is
more unhappy than Maloney to
hear of the death or injury of one
of his proteges.
The training that these present
soldiers of ours have had in their
younger days as members of this
class have helped more than the
average person would realize.
Things are not so easy over across
the water and the man with that
last little bit of energy, that little
will to fight, is the man who in the
end comes out on top. Mr. Ma
loney instills these ideas into
young minds where they can be
come deeply planted and grow un
til they are able to dominate his
character and make it a better one.
Only one angle of the course
bothers Maloney at this point. In
two more years he will reach the
retirement age and be forced to
stop his fine work. Is as fine a
project as this goim* to be allowed
to fall by the wayside.

last one, for the weekly swim un
der the watchful eyes of the whole
staff.
Every two weeks the group
changes its schedule and the bas
ketball addicts turn to baseball or
boxing or any other sport that
meets their fancy, while the base
ball players may take up basket
ball. One thing is certain, each
group must take its turn in the
swimming pool and this insistence
has brought splendid results.
Develop Swimmers
For many years most of the
mainstays of the Palo Alto High
swimming team have been ex
members of Maloney's course. In
turn, many of these boys have
come to Stanford and continued
their successes. ■
Mr. Maloney has one main ob
jective in mind in holding these
classes. That is sportsmanship. He
believes that being a gentleman
and a sport is a very great goal to
reach in life, and to follow up this
belief he impregnates the two
ideals into his course very strongly.
The respect of parents and of
elders plays an integral part, as
does the ability to cooperate with
others both on and off the athletic
field.
Impressive Talks
One has only to listen to the
short talks given by Maloney be
fore exercising the lads any Satur
day morning to see the impression
that his words carry with them—
children of only 8 years listening
with eager ears to everything that
he has to say and endeavoring to
remember it and practice it in their
daily life.
Such a start in life is enviable to
any youngster and all of the boys
realize that fact. Any misde
meanor or failure to live up to the
principles of the master is pun
ished by being dropped from the
class. The impact of this verdict to
a member of the class is catastro
phic and consequently, besides
their sound reasoning, the words
of advice are taken to heart.
Famous Graduates
Many of the members of past
classes are now in the armed serv
ices all over the face of the world.
Despite the spreading of his ex
pupils, Mr. Maloney still hears
from them frequently. Scarcely a
week goes by that he does not re
ceive a letter or read an article
that one of his boys has performed
some deed of heroism and been
decorated or has been cited for
being outstanding in a certain
field. Sometimes the news is not
quite so cheerful, and no man is
more unhappy than Maloney to
hear of the death or injury of one
of his proteges.
The training that these present
soldiers of ours have had in their
younger days as members of this
class have helped more than the
average person would realize.
Things are not so easy over across
the water and the man with that
last little bit of energy, that little
will to fight, is the man who in the
end comes out on top. Mr. Ma
loney instills these ideas into
young minds where they can be
come deeply planted and grow un
til they are able to dominate his
character and make it a better one.
Only one angle of the course
bothers Maloney at this point. In
two more years he will reach the
retirement age and be forced to
stop his fine work. Is as fine a
project as this goim* to be allowed
to fall by the wayside.


HARRY B. MALONEY
The year 1943 marks the 25th
anniversary of another of Stan
ford's great traditions, the young
boys' gym class of Harry Maloney.
Mr. Maloney first began this course
for young boys on the Stanford
campus and from Palo Alto in 1916,
with an enrollment of only 34.
This number has multiplied many
times through the years until it
is now the highest in its history,
185.
The class has become very popu
lar, especially with the children of
alumni and faculty of the Farm.
So widespread has been its ac
claim that the present class in
cludes boys from as far as San
Francisco and Oakland.
Looking through the files of for
mer Stanford athletic greats, one
finds numbers of them who re
ceived their introduction to sports
under Mr. Maloney's direction.
Many of these names are familiar
from more than one standpoint, for
most of them are sons of noted
Stanford alumni.
Saturday Class
The course is for boys from 8 to
15 years of age and is held every
Saturday morning at the Encina
Gym. The schedule emphasizes
posture exercises, competition in
group sports, and especially swim
ming. No boy is permitted to go
through the course without being

able to swim across the short
width of the pool.
To instruct the lads in the aquatic
sport this season, Maloney has em
ployed national champion Emmett
Cash in for swimming and Dick
Williams for diving. His other
aides are also well known in the
Farm's athletic picture. Harry
Shipkey for softball, Marchie
Schwartz for football. Howie Dall
mar and John Eikelmann for bas
ketball, and Maloney, himself, for
boxing.
The boys report at the gym at 9
a.m. sharp on Saturday mornings
where they meet in the apparatus
room waiting for the instructor.
When Mr. Maloney enters the room
and blows one blast on his whistle
the lads don't move, no matter
where they are. until the release

Forming lines they then march
out on to the basketball floor where
ranks are formed and a few mili

hardwoods to the fresh air is the
next move, and here the assistants

Under the leadership of Maloney
the boys do simple physical exer
cises, designed primarily to built
up their weak muscles and aid their
posture.
Following this drill the different
instructors take over in earnest.

HARRY B. MALONEY
The year 1943 marks the 25th
anniversary of another of Stan
ford's great traditions, the young
boys' gym class of Harry Maloney.
Mr. Maloney first began this course
for young boys on the Stanford
campus and from Palo Alto in 1916,
with an enrollment of only 34.
This number has multiplied many
times through the years until it
is now the highest in its history,
185.
The class has become very popu
lar, especially with the children of
alumni and faculty of the Farm.
So widespread has been its ac
claim that the present class in
cludes boys from as far as San
Francisco and Oakland.
Looking through the files of for
mer Stanford athletic greats, one
finds numbers of them who re
ceived their introduction to sports
under Mr. Maloney's direction.
Many of these names are familiar
from more than one standpoint, for
most of them are sons of noted
Stanford alumni.
Saturday Class
The course is for boys from 8 to
15 years of age and is held every
Saturday morning at the Encina
Gym. The schedule emphasizes
posture exercises, competition in
group sports, and especially swim
ming. No boy is permitted to go
through the course without being

able to swim across the short
width of the pool.
To instruct the lads in the aquatic
sport this season, Maloney has em
ployed national champion Emmett
Cash in for swimming and Dick
Williams for diving. His other
aides are also well known in the
Farm's athletic picture. Harry
Shipkey for softball, Marchie
Schwartz for football. Howie Dall
mar and John Eikelmann for bas
ketball, and Maloney, himself, for
boxing.
The boys report at the gym at 9
a.m. sharp on Saturday mornings
where they meet in the apparatus
room waiting for the instructor.
When Mr. Maloney enters the room
and blows one blast on his whistle
the lads don't move, no matter
where they are. until the release
blast a moment later.
Form Ranks
Forming lines they then march
out on to the basketball floor where
ranks are formed and a few mili
tary directions given. From the
hardwoods to the fresh air is the
next move, and here the assistants
begin their part in the program.
Under the leadership of Maloney
the boys do simple physical exer
cises, designed primarily to built
up their weak muscles and aid their
posture.
Following this drill the different
instructors take over in earnest.

dividing the group up and each
squad going its way for baseball,
basketball or what have you for an
hour or so. Then to the pool, every
last one, for the weekly swim un
der the watchful eyes of the whole
staff.
Every two weeks the group
changes its schedule and the bas
ketball addicts turn to baseball or
boxing or any other sport that
meets their fancy, while the base
ball players may take up basket
ball. One thing is certain, each
group must take its turn in the
swimming pool and this insistence
has brought splendid results.
Develop Swimmers
For many years most of the
mainstays of the Palo Alto High
swimming team have been ex
members of Maloney's course. In
turn, many of these boys have
come to Stanford and continued
their successes. ■
Mr. Maloney has one main ob
jective in mind in holding these
classes. That is sportsmanship. He
believes that being a gentleman
and a sport is a very great goal to
reach in life, and to follow up this
belief he impregnates the two
ideals into his course very strongly.
The respect of parents and of
elders plays an integral part, as
does the ability to cooperate with
others both on and off the athletic
field.
Impressive Talks
One has only to listen to the
short talks given by Maloney be
fore exercising the lads any Satur
day morning to see the impression
that his words carry with them—
children of only 8 years listening
with eager ears to everything that
he has to say and endeavoring to
remember it and practice it in their
daily life.
Such a start in life is enviable to
any youngster and all of the boys
realize that fact. Any misde
meanor or failure to live up to the
principles of the master is pun
ished by being dropped from the
class. The impact of this verdict to
a member of the class is catastro
phic and consequently, besides
their sound reasoning, the words
of advice are taken to heart.
Famous Graduates
Many of the members of past
classes are now in the armed serv
ices all over the face of the world.
Despite the spreading of his ex
pupils, Mr. Maloney still hears
from them frequently. Scarcely a
week goes by that he does not re
ceive a letter or read an article
that one of his boys has performed
some deed of heroism and been
decorated or has been cited for
being outstanding in a certain
field. Sometimes the news is not
quite so cheerful, and no man is
more unhappy than Maloney to
hear of the death or injury of one
of his proteges.
The training that these present
soldiers of ours have had in their
younger days as members of this
class have helped more than the
average person would realize.
