Two Big Games next grid season!
That's what it says on the front page
of this sheet. The idea is embry
onic, to be sure, but with the most
powerful half of the Coast Confer
ence behind it, it ought to go
through.
So we'll probably play Cal twice,
opening the season against the Bears
on Sept. 25, and closing it against
them on Nov. 20. Stanford will also
play a pair with both U.S.C. and
U.C.L.A. on a home and home basis,
the way it looks now.
Something to think obout, isn't it?
What will happen to the Axe? is
one of the questions which come to
mind. Why don't we work out a
schedule with St. Mary's, Santa
Clara, Pre-Flight, and U.S.P., play
the southern schools and Cal only
once, and save miles of traveling?
is another.
And what about that opening
game? It's a poor time to be meet
ing California, isn't it? There are
lots of other questions we would
like answered, should the whole set
up go through as planned in June.

It's fairly obvious the p lan is the
brainchild of Arnold Eddy of U.S.C.
and William Ackerman of U.C.L.A.
Up here, Stanford and California
could get along fine, playing the Bay
Area clubs. But the Trojans and
Bruins would have to go against
Redlands, Occidental, Pomona, and
Loyola.
Just the same, the setup has ad
vantages. Stanford will have big
time football with bigtime colleges
as usual, although the brand of foot
ball may not be up to par. We'll
still have the crowds, the spirit and
excitement that accompany a busi
ness-as-usual football season. Even
though the plan involves more trav
eling than should be undertaken by
football teams in wartime, the rep
resentatives have nevertheless made
an effort to keep intact football's
number one ranking morale builder.
The whole deal probably took a
rough panning from the San Fran
cisco sportswriters this morning, but
it could work out. The representa
tives of the four schools might have
been a little presumptuous, how
ever, in assuming that there will be
enough footballers around in Sep
tember to carry out their elaborate
proposal.
