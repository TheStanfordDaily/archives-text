Stanford's baseball nine resumes
its conference competition after more
than a week's rest, tomorrow against
U.S.F. The game or games, since
Coach Wolter is dickering for a
doubleheader, will be played on the
Sunken Diamond. The starting time
is also indefinite as yet but will be
announced as soon as word is re
ceived from San Francisco as to the
twin bill.
Since he does not know specifi
cally the schedule, Harry Wolter has
not up to this date divulged his
starting lineups, although one start
ing pitcher should be Jack Miller,
who did such a fine job of relieving
Bernard Woody against the Pre-
Flighters last Saturday. The other
Starting berth will go to either Woody
or Doc Mason if his injured back
permits him to throw.
The Dons are certain to start Con
Dempsey, their ace, in one of the two
games, and if only one is played he
will undoubtedly be the hurler.
