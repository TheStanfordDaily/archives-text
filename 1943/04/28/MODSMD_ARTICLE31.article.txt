# Mural Schedule Problem Solved
## 
### 
"All intramural softball games that
have been played so far this season
will have to be regarded as practice
contests," Harry Wolter announced
yesterday.
The reason for this change came
when he noticed that, according to
the schedule, all of the teams en
tered in the competition were not
| scheduled to meet each other twice.
As the schedule ended on June 2, it
would be impossible to add the nec
essary games so that each team
would have the same chance of win
i ning.
The new system will have 10
games to be played on Monday,
Tuesday, and Thursday, and the
whole program should be completed
by the middle of May.
Revision of the old setup is under
way now, and the league should be
operating smoothly tomorrow when
I the houses and organizations resume
competition.
