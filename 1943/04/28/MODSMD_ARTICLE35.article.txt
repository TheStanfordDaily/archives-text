"No, Stanford isn't what it used to be. The good old days are
gone forever, I guess."
You hear a lot of people who were back in 1940 and 1941,
saying things like that these days. Many of us are looking for
ward to coming back to school after the war. I think maybe
we'll be better off, in many respects, if we don't plan to return
to "the good old days" when we do come back.
For there are a lot of things about Stanford life that are much
better now than they were before the war broke out. For one
thing, our lives are a lot simpler. We don't go to San Francisco
so often; there's less drinking than there used to be; firesides
and juke-box dances have pretty much taken the place of elabo
rate Fiji Island dances, boat dances and train dances.
In "the good old days" it used to be a major tragedy if we
lost a football game. We wasted week after week of valuable
time on intensive rushing, intensive hell-weeks, intensive cam
paigning for elections, intensive activity for "the house." Most
of us won't have that much time to waste when we come back.
Or, if we do, we won't have learned much while we've been
away.
Extra-curricular activities are good—in moderation; football
games are enjoyable; so are dances. Certainly the Back to the
Farm Day, Pre-Reg, the Convalescent Home Drive, etc., were all
worth while.
But what's the use of Hell Week? 2:3o's? Week after week
of rushing? The lopsided social calendar of "the good old days"?
I've read a dozen letters from fellows now in the services,
saying in effect: "Do me a favor, will you? Kick every guy you
see who's wasting as much time at Stanford as I did, who's not
taking advantage of what the real Stanford has to offer. When
I come back, I'm sure going to do it differently."
There v/ere plenty of wonderful things about Stanford in "the
good old days," and none of them should be lost. But during
this last year, a lot of the excesses have been swept away. And
we don't want to return to "normalcy" anywhere—not even at
Stanford.

saying in effect: "Do me a favor, will you? Kick every guy you
see who's wasting as much time at Stanford as I did, who's not
taking advantage of what the real Stanford has to offer. When
I come back, I'm sure going to do it differently."
There v/ere plenty of wonderful things about Stanford in "the
good old days," and none of them should be lost. But during
this last year, a lot of the excesses have been swept away. And
we don't want to return to "normalcy" anywhere—not even at
Stanford.

"No, Stanford isn't what it used to be. The good old days are
gone forever, I guess."
You hear a lot of people who were back in 1940 and 1941,
saying things like that these days. Many of us are looking for
ward to coming back to school after the war. I think maybe
we'll be better off, in many respects, if we don't plan to return
to "the good old days" when we do come back.
For there are a lot of things about Stanford life that are much
better now than they were before the war broke out. For one
thing, our lives are a lot simpler. We don't go to San Francisco
so often; there's less drinking than there used to be; firesides
and juke-box dances have pretty much taken the place of elabo
rate Fiji Island dances, boat dances and train dances.
In "the good old days" it used to be a major tragedy if we
lost a football game. We wasted week after week of valuable
time on intensive rushing, intensive hell-weeks, intensive cam
paigning for elections, intensive activity for "the house." Most
of us won't have that much time to waste when we come back.
Or, if we do, we won't have learned much while we've been
away.
Extra-curricular activities are good—in moderation; football
games are enjoyable; so are dances. Certainly the Back to the
Farm Day, Pre-Reg, the Convalescent Home Drive, etc., were all
worth while.
But what's the use of Hell Week? 2:3o's? Week after week
of rushing? The lopsided social calendar of "the good old days"?
I've read a dozen letters from fellows now in the services,
saying in effect: "Do me a favor, will you? Kick every guy you
see who's wasting as much time at Stanford as I did, who's not
taking advantage of what the real Stanford has to offer. When
I come back, I'm sure going to do it differently."
