The Editor, Sir:
NOW THAT there are many new students, STARS, Civil
Defense officers, etc., on campus it is up to us students to keep
alive, by example, those Stanford traditions which have been
handed to us by previous generations of Stanford men and
women.
It's a little discouraging to remind our newcomers of our
cherished traditions and then to walk on Quad and see groups
cf Stanford women smoking on Quad or to bump into a faculty
member with a cigarette in his hand.
Remember, it's the little things in life that count and surely
this tradition, peculiar to Stanford, that has weathered the chang
ing conditions of fifty years, can weather conditions now.
