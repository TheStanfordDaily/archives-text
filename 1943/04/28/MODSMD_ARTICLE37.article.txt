# Junk Jewelry Appeal Made
## 
### 
Nancy Nichols, chairman of the j
"Baubles for Buddies to Barter"
campaign on campus, is making an |
appeal to all Farm women to look j
through their top dresser drawers j
or bottom dresser drawers or wher- j
ever they keep it for junk jewelry
to be used as barter in the South j
Pacific islands.
The San Francisco League for j
Service Men has already sent more j
than half a ton of such jewelry— ;
17,157 pieces to be exact—on its way
across the Pacific after the first ten
days of the "Baubles" campaign.
The whole thing started when a
shipment of games to the armed
forces in the Pacific included, by ac
cident, some strings of beads and a
few ten-cent store clips. Word came
back from Lt. Gen. M. F. Harmon
that the natives dug 52 foxholes in
return for a brooch and a pair of
earrings. And Lt. Gen. Harmon's
plea was "Send us more."
Other officers stated that the na
tives would bring the wounded in
from the battlefields, carry munitions
and supplies through the jungles,
and perform an incredible number
of other tough assignments in ex
change fo rthis "junk" which they
prize so highly. By contrast, money
lias little meaning for them; only
the costume jewelry will do.
Miss Nichols wished to emphasize
that the drive did not want good
[ jewelry, only the jangle bracelets,
; novelty pins which have lost their
novelty .and other such white ele
phants of the jewelry genus. Nor
! does it matter if stones are missing.
Earrings without mates, beads,
bracelets, brooches, belt buckles, and
even ornamental buttons will fill the
demand. According to high-ranking
| Army officers, there is practically no
! limit to the amount of jewelry which
! can be used.
