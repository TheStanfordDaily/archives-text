# Boathouse---It's Highlights Then and Now
## 
### 
The Stanford Boathou.se on Lake
Lagunita is a scene of varied ac
tivities. It is a place of rest for
weekend weary students. It is a
place of much social activity, far
surpassing the library for im
promptu introductions of the co-ed
to the Stanford rough. Again, it
may be a place of intellectual en
deavor.
The lake itself is filled with red
and white canoes, one sailboat with
a green sail, swimming co-eds in
search of the nearest lifeguard,
various varieties of seaweed and
alga, and a continually expanding
population of polliwogs.
There are three wooden rafts on
the lake. Situated on these rafts
one sometimes finds a law student
studying Torts or Equities. Other
students swim out to the farthest
raft and then stand up to show the
people at the boathouse how far
they can swim or what nice fig
ures or physiques they have.

A few historical incidents have
taken place at the lake. In the
spring of '39, Tom Killifer, then
student body president and Rhodes
Scholar, took a dollar bet on dar
ing to bite off the head of a water
snake. The action was so phenom
enal that it made the Associated
Press Wire Service. Tommy is
now an Army flier "somewhere in
the Pacific."
In the spring of 1940, Marjorie
Gestring, Olympic diving champ
and former Stanford student, fell
from a three-meter diving board
which had been erected on one of
the rafts for the Night Water Car
nival. Marjorie was unhurt, but
for a few bruises. That incident
made both the Associated Press
and United Press wire services.
The lake was one time a scene
of many campus functions. The
Junior Water Carnival, with its
galaxy of floats, its swimming races
and canoe jostling contests. The
greatest student achievement on
the lake was Stanford's Night
Water Aquacade, based on Billy
Rose's latest production. At that
time, swimmers and divers, their
suits covered with fluorescent
paint, swain neath many colored
lights to recordings of Hawaiian
bands.
'Coney Island'
Now, due to the war, such events
have been canceled and the lake
has been dubbed an "escapist's
para d i s e," "Stanford's Coney
Island." A pilot just returned from
the war fronts was questioned as
to his impression of Stanford's gay
Lake Lagunita.
"Sure, once you get in that play
time atmosphere, you forget that
there's a war going on. But it's
good to see. You kids work hard
here at school, and you should
have some fun. It's good to see so
many tan, healthy, and happy
young kids. That's what we're
fighting for, isn't it?"
The lake takes a different ap
pearance throughout the seasons.
In the summer time it is dry, short
grass sprouting on its bed, some
times a cow or two grazing, and
horseback riders cantering across
its expanse. During winter storms,
one can look out of Roble's side
windows at night and see rain
pouring down and wind dashing
the waters against the shoreline
like a tiny but angry sea.
Spring Activity
The grads remember it all.
Someone wrote from "somewhere
in India" . . . "It's awfully hot
here. It makes me think of Stan
ford. You're having your spring,
while we are having our summer.
Is the lake still that gay center of
fun loving kids? Are the hills all
around still green and covered with
big black and white cows? All we
have are water-buffalo here. . .

to his impression of Stanford's gay
Lake Lagunita.
"Sure, once you get in that play
time atmosphere, you forget that
there's a war going on. But it's
good to see. You kids work hard
here at school, and you should
have some fun. It's good to see so
many tan, healthy, and happy
young kids. That's what we're
fighting for, isn't it?"
The lake takes a different ap
pearance throughout the seasons.
In the summer time it is dry, short
grass sprouting on its bed, some
times a cow or two grazing, and
horseback riders cantering across
its expanse. During winter storms,
one can look out of Roble's side
windows at night and see rain
pouring down and wind dashing
the waters against the shoreline
like a tiny but angry sea.
Spring Activity
The grads remember it all.
Someone wrote from "somewhere
in India" . . . "It's awfully hot
here. It makes me think of Stan
ford. You're having your spring,
while we are having our summer.
Is the lake still that gay center of
fun loving kids? Are the hills all
around still green and covered with
big black and white cows? All we
have are water-buffalo here. . .

The Stanford Boathou.se on Lake
Lagunita is a scene of varied ac
tivities. It is a place of rest for
weekend weary students. It is a
place of much social activity, far
surpassing the library for im
promptu introductions of the co-ed
to the Stanford rough. Again, it
may be a place of intellectual en
deavor.
The lake itself is filled with red
and white canoes, one sailboat with
a green sail, swimming co-eds in
search of the nearest lifeguard,
various varieties of seaweed and
alga, and a continually expanding
population of polliwogs.
There are three wooden rafts on
the lake. Situated on these rafts
one sometimes finds a law student
studying Torts or Equities. Other
students swim out to the farthest
raft and then stand up to show the
people at the boathouse how far
they can swim or what nice fig
ures or physiques they have.

A few historical incidents have
taken place at the lake. In the
spring of '39, Tom Killifer, then
student body president and Rhodes
Scholar, took a dollar bet on dar
ing to bite off the head of a water
snake. The action was so phenom
enal that it made the Associated
Press Wire Service. Tommy is
now an Army flier "somewhere in
the Pacific."
In the spring of 1940, Marjorie
Gestring, Olympic diving champ
and former Stanford student, fell
from a three-meter diving board
which had been erected on one of
the rafts for the Night Water Car
nival. Marjorie was unhurt, but
for a few bruises. That incident
made both the Associated Press
and United Press wire services.
The lake was one time a scene
of many campus functions. The
Junior Water Carnival, with its
galaxy of floats, its swimming races
and canoe jostling contests. The
greatest student achievement on
the lake was Stanford's Night
Water Aquacade, based on Billy
Rose's latest production. At that
time, swimmers and divers, their
suits covered with fluorescent
paint, swain neath many colored
lights to recordings of Hawaiian
bands.
'Coney Island'
Now, due to the war, such events
have been canceled and the lake
has been dubbed an "escapist's
para d i s e," "Stanford's Coney
Island." A pilot just returned from
the war fronts was questioned as
