ven on a national scale." Dr.
arl Cowdery, armed services rep

Behind the test there was a lot
work, especially for the 10 ed
ges which were designated to
•rrect this test. Stanford was one
tch college. All of the tests which
ere taken in California, Oregon,
ashington, and Nevada were cor
cted at Stanford. Handled were
.000 tests, which allowed for a
rplus in each center giving the
>>t. Of these approximately over
.000 tests were used. All of these
:aminees were not qualified, how
er. and only 19,694 were reported

•pins in February
Behind all of this there was
eparation. Early in February Dr.
nvdery was asked by the Navy
apartment to come to Washington
help plan for the test.
Next, the Navy Department sent
it letters to all of the high school
incipals in the United States an
>uncing the test and asking their

These answers were sent to a
liege in one of 10 regions into
liich the Navy Department had
vided the country. These ed
ges were to distribute and cor
ct the test. Stanford was chosen
this vicinity.
In March, however, after all the
rangements had been concluded
handle the tests, the Army de
,-led to come into the program and
ked that the test be given to
ose civilians interested in the
rmy Specialized Training pro
am as well as the Navy and Ma
ne programs.

All of the principals had to be
itified again, and their revised
aires had now to be tabulated,
le results were sent to Chicago
id there the tests were printed.
From Chicago tests were sent to
e colleges. The colleges in turn

distributed the tests to the high
schools and other colleges which
would be administering them. In
the Pacific Coast area 900 colleges
gave the test, and 8,000 high
schools.
"We were sending out tests, by
mail and by express, right up to
and, in one case, on the night be
fore the test," Dr. Cowdery said.
Tests Returned
''After the test had been given,
all of the tests, used and unused,
were returned to the regional col
lege.
'"We sent out cars on that after
noon after the tests had been given
to collect tests from nearby
schools," he said. "Other centers
sent their tests in by mail or by
express.
"As an example of the quantity
of the tests which were returned,
28 sacks of mail were delivered
dining one day. Fifty-three ex
press packages arrived the same
day. This was the peak.
Post Ollice Complains
''The Post Office employees com
plained that they were going to
have to move out on the porch so
that the mail could be inside if
the flow continued," he said. "There
was no way of preparing them for
the flow because we didn't know
how the various centers would
send their tests in."
Check Information
"In addition to this, the staff had
to check the information listed by
each individual on his test to make
sure that that individual was eli
gible to take the test. Many of
them were not. One corrector said
it was "just plain torture."
After the tests had been checked
and corrected, the results had to
be tabulated. The results of those
who were taking the lest for the
Army were sent to the Army head
quarters.
"Miss Ewell had a staff of ap
proximately 35 people. They
worked for about two weeks on
the tests, putting in from 8 to 12
hours a day. This was the largest
test which she had ever undertaken
to correct," Dr. Cowdery said.
"As I had fr.llen sick about the
middle of the planning, Dr. Kinney,
professor of education, took over
all of the negotiations on the part
of the University," he continued.
"To Miss Ewell and Dr. Kidney
goes all the credit for a big job well
done."
