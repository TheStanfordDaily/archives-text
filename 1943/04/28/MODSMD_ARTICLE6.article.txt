# Mrs. Hoge Arranges For Mexican Study
## 
### 
As the attraction of South of the
Bolder becomes felt by an ever
increasing number of students de
siring to study Spanish and absorb
the culture down Mexico Way, the
office of Inter-American Relations
in the Hoover Library comes into
the limelight once more.
Mrs. Maria Hoge, director of the
office, has undertaken to help the
students who wish to study at the
University of Mexico Summer
School by advising them on
courses, arranging their transpor
tation in a group with the Mexican
Railways, and housing in Spanish
speaking homes with the Univer
sity of Mexico.
Mexican Study
"This year, more than ever, stu
dents seem anxious to go to Mex
ico to study, and we are eager to
help them accomplish this plan,"
said Mrs. Hoge.
The Inter-American Office keeps
on file pamphlets, bulletins, and
other information from Mexican
sources for the use of students in
terested in combining vacation and
study plans by attending the Uni
versity of Mexico summer school.
Aiding American students with
problems concerning the Latin-
American countries is only one of
the many services performed by
Mrs. Hoge and the Inter-American
Office.
Mrs. Hoge's office has become the
unofficial headquarters of the
Latin-American students attend
ing Stanford and the scene of the

untangling of many problems con
fronting the students who do not
as yet speak English fluently.
The Inter-American Office has
arranged for at least 30 prominent
Latin-Americans, most of them
visiting this country at the invita
tion of the Department of State, to
lecture on campus, and has given
them the opportunity to visit the
departments of the University
which would be of particular in
terest to them.
Helped Debaters
Both this year and last Mrs.
Hoge worked with the debate de
partment in helping the Stanford
entrants in the national Inter-
American Affairs discussion con
test prepare for the event. By con
ducting in her office informal dis
cussions on Latin American affairs,
Mrs. Hoge was able to familiarize
the students with the Latin-Amer
ican viewpoint on the subjects
which might be raised during the
tournament.
This year Ernie Blumberg, Stan
ford entrant, was one of the eight
speakers in the West Coast Region
chosen to compete in the regional
tournament to be held May 4 in
Denver.
The Latin-American Office was
established with the collaboration
of Dr. Graham Stuart and the late
Dr. Percy Martin, author of "Who's
Who in Latin America" and a
Stanford pioneer in Latin-Ameri
an rffairs.
