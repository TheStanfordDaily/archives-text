# Campus School Gardens With a Will
## 
### 
"No, it's not much trouble to get
the work done in our victory gar
den except when the kids get
tired," so said sixth grader Manuel
Lozano, boss in charge of one of
the campus grammar school vic
tory gardens.
Apparently the "kids" enthusi
asm has overcome the odds of hot
fain, hand watering, and erratic
.rrops. At any rate it has earned
them the title of Victory Flag Gar
den. Rowley Langley, newspaper
garden columnist, makes the award
over KGO for the best victory gar
den in the state each week. The
campus school was second to get
the award.
A year ago the novice gardeners
began the move to get nearer the
green earth on the school
ground. Their constructive recesses
*nd lunch hours were under the
direction of Miss Ethel Boulware,
sponsor and gardener. Everyone
pooled his efforts in a general co
operative patch and awards of
merit were given lor the most en
thusiastic and reproductive efforts.
Plot Sovereignty
Having "weeded" through the in
tricacies of learning how to garden
.ast year, the kids, from the first
grade up, have now volunteered to
cultivate and harvest crops from
small plots of their own. The plot
sovereignty and resultant economic
competition has cancelled any need
tor awards of merit on paper.
The kindergarteners had trouble
with undertaking to raise any more
than radishes last year. And their
product when sample d wasn't
tasty, and when pulled the hole had
to be filled by starting from
scratch, or rather furrow and seed,
f.gain. This proved very discour
aging for 4 and 5-year-olds, so they
low have a new and more colorful
task. It is their special duty to
Keep the flower beds around the
school weeded and trim. They can
pick the blossoms and more will
soon be in bloom.
Truck Gardeners
Their older brothers and sisters,
s'.iil plugging along in the truck
gardening business, have been
raising radishes (their interest in
this crop is waning too), beets,
carrots, turnips, cabbages, Chinese
lettuce, lettuce, peas (just a few
to sample). If they accomplish
nothing else, they are at least de
veloping a taste for vegetables.
Even turnips taste fine when you
raise them yourself!
Already this season two crops of
turnips, lots of radishes, chard, and
.ettuce have been harvested. The
gardens are beginning to look bare.
Having experienced so much suc
cess in their truck garden ventures
on the school ground, the children
have attempted an even more am
bitious undertaking.
Quoting from the "Junior Citi
zen,'' newspaper edited by Cub
Scouts of the campus school (from
the garden column by Charles
Brand):
Loaned Land
"Did you know that the Campus
School has been loaned a half acre
of land by Mrs. Herbert Hoover?
It is to be plowed soon and we are
going to raise several kinds of
vegetables, among them cucum
bers. The cucumbers are to be
made into pickles which are a very
; :ood source of vitamins A and D.
Pickles are very rich in salt and
that is one reason we are selling
them to the Army indirectly. In
tropical countries one perspires a
>t, losing a lot of salt from the
body. It has to be put back.)
"Pickles," the young columnist
nnishes." are a very good source
f salt besides helping to keep up
soldiers morale."
The cucumbers are being grown

to sell to a nearby cannery to fill
an Army contract. The garden is a
joint project. Children have done
the planting and will take care of
it until school is out. Boy and Girl
Scouts, Brownies, and Cubs will
cultivate and harvest in summer
under the School Parents' Club and
volunteer adult helpers. The Par
ents' Group is furnishing expenses,
while the cannery sprays the plants
and gives advice.
Profit Distribution
Any money that is made over
expenses will be divided betwen
the Parents' Group yearly fund, a
fund for new tools, and war bonds.
Manuel Lozano, student boss in
charge of the cucumbers, said when
questioned as to the progress of his
project, "We just got done cutting
the grass after the tractor got
through mowing it down."
Patricia White, who pilots a
squad of fifth graders, reminiscing
in true womanly fashion on the
day she was in charge of the proj
ect, said "That day we had all girls
and did everything."
Anne Hornby, questioned as to
the main trouble with the cucum
ber gardening, finally pointed out
that "After awhile the kids get
tired and their hoes seem to turn
over and don't cut very well."
Also, some people go too fast.
Manuel scornfully remembered
"one room that didn't know how to
cut grass at all . . . just went too
fast and made a lot of trouble."
Divided Labor
Gloria Wright commented, "Boys
work the cyckles, the girls clean
up after them." Gloria didn't seem
too bitter about this age-old un
balanced state of affairs.
The garden eolcmnist of the
"Junior Citizen" speaks the prini
ples of these young victory gar
deners. "Weeds seem to grow
faster than vegetables . . . did you
know that weeding is a good exer
cise for tall people?"
In another issue of "Junior Citi
zen" Master Brand begins: "This is
a right up of Mr. Langly's speaches.
He broadcasts every Monday and
Wednesday at 7:15.
"Hellow, how is your garden
coming? If you haven't got one
you had better get going because
there isn't enough being grown in
commercial fields to feed the coun
try."
With apologies to Columnist
Brand and to the eminent grown
up garden authority from which he
gets his information, and for the
benefit of Stanford readers who
may be planning to start a victory
garden themselves, we quote on.
"For faster germination of beets,
put them (the seeds) in a bag and
pound them with a hammer. This
divided the seeds from the pulp and
it does not take so long for it to
grow."


CHILDREN at the Campus School work in gangs, planting, weeding, watering and harvesting their Vie

Plot Sovereignty
Having "weeded" through the in
tricacies of learning how to garden
.ast year, the kids, from the first
grade up, have now volunteered to
cultivate and harvest crops from
small plots of their own. The plot
sovereignty and resultant economic
competition has cancelled any need
tor awards of merit on paper.
The kindergarteners had trouble
with undertaking to raise any more
than radishes last year. And their
product when sample d wasn't
tasty, and when pulled the hole had
to be filled by starting from
scratch, or rather furrow and seed,
f.gain. This proved very discour
aging for 4 and 5-year-olds, so they
low have a new and more colorful
task. It is their special duty to
Keep the flower beds around the
school weeded and trim. They can
pick the blossoms and more will
soon be in bloom.
Truck Gardeners
Their older brothers and sisters,
s'.iil plugging along in the truck
gardening business, have been
raising radishes (their interest in
this crop is waning too), beets,
carrots, turnips, cabbages, Chinese
lettuce, lettuce, peas (just a few
to sample). If they accomplish
nothing else, they are at least de
veloping a taste for vegetables.
Even turnips taste fine when you
raise them yourself!
Already this season two crops of
turnips, lots of radishes, chard, and
.ettuce have been harvested. The
gardens are beginning to look bare.
Having experienced so much suc
cess in their truck garden ventures
on the school ground, the children
have attempted an even more am
bitious undertaking.
Quoting from the "Junior Citi
zen,'' newspaper edited by Cub
Scouts of the campus school (from
the garden column by Charles
Brand):
Loaned Land
"Did you know that the Campus
School has been loaned a half acre
of land by Mrs. Herbert Hoover?
It is to be plowed soon and we are
going to raise several kinds of
vegetables, among them cucum
bers. The cucumbers are to be
made into pickles which are a very
; :ood source of vitamins A and D.
Pickles are very rich in salt and
that is one reason we are selling
them to the Army indirectly. In
tropical countries one perspires a
>t, losing a lot of salt from the
body. It has to be put back.)
"Pickles," the young columnist
nnishes." are a very good source
f salt besides helping to keep up
soldiers morale."
The cucumbers are being grown

to sell to a nearby cannery to fill
an Army contract. The garden is a
joint project. Children have done
the planting and will take care of
it until school is out. Boy and Girl
Scouts, Brownies, and Cubs will
cultivate and harvest in summer
under the School Parents' Club and
volunteer adult helpers. The Par
ents' Group is furnishing expenses,
while the cannery sprays the plants
and gives advice.
Profit Distribution
Any money that is made over
expenses will be divided betwen
the Parents' Group yearly fund, a
fund for new tools, and war bonds.
Manuel Lozano, student boss in
charge of the cucumbers, said when
questioned as to the progress of his
project, "We just got done cutting
the grass after the tractor got
through mowing it down."
Patricia White, who pilots a
squad of fifth graders, reminiscing
in true womanly fashion on the
day she was in charge of the proj
ect, said "That day we had all girls
and did everything."
Anne Hornby, questioned as to
the main trouble with the cucum
ber gardening, finally pointed out
that "After awhile the kids get
tired and their hoes seem to turn
over and don't cut very well."
Also, some people go too fast.
Manuel scornfully remembered
"one room that didn't know how to
cut grass at all . . . just went too
fast and made a lot of trouble."
Divided Labor
Gloria Wright commented, "Boys
work the cyckles, the girls clean
up after them." Gloria didn't seem
too bitter about this age-old un
balanced state of affairs.
The garden eolcmnist of the
"Junior Citizen" speaks the prini
ples of these young victory gar
deners. "Weeds seem to grow
faster than vegetables . . . did you

cise for tall people?"
In another issue of "Junior Citi

a right up of Mr. Langly's speaches.
He broadcasts every Monday and
Wednesday at 7:15.
"Hellow, how is your garden
coming? If you haven't got one
you had better get going because
there isn't enough being grown in
commercial fields to feed the coun

With apologies to Columnist
Brand and to the eminent grown

gets his information, and for the
benefit of Stanford readers who
may be planning to start a victory
garden themselves, we quote on.
"For faster germination of beets,

Truck Gardeners
Their older brothers and sisters,
s'.iil plugging along in the truck
gardening business, have been
raising radishes (their interest in
this crop is waning too), beets,
carrots, turnips, cabbages, Chinese
lettuce, lettuce, peas (just a few
to sample). If they accomplish
nothing else, they are at least de
veloping a taste for vegetables.
Even turnips taste fine when you
raise them yourself!
Already this season two crops of
turnips, lots of radishes, chard, and
.ettuce have been harvested. The
gardens are beginning to look bare.
Having experienced so much suc
cess in their truck garden ventures
on the school ground, the children
have attempted an even more am
bitious undertaking.
Quoting from the "Junior Citi
zen,'' newspaper edited by Cub
Scouts of the campus school (from
the garden column by Charles
Brand):
Loaned Land
"Did you know that the Campus
School has been loaned a half acre
of land by Mrs. Herbert Hoover?
It is to be plowed soon and we are
going to raise several kinds of
vegetables, among them cucum
bers. The cucumbers are to be
made into pickles which are a very
; :ood source of vitamins A and D.
Pickles are very rich in salt and
that is one reason we are selling
them to the Army indirectly. In
tropical countries one perspires a
>t, losing a lot of salt from the
body. It has to be put back.)
"Pickles," the young columnist
nnishes." are a very good source
f salt besides helping to keep up
soldiers morale."
The cucumbers are being grown

to sell to a nearby cannery to fill
an Army contract. The garden is a
joint project. Children have done
the planting and will take care of
it until school is out. Boy and Girl
Scouts, Brownies, and Cubs will
cultivate and harvest in summer
under the School Parents' Club and
volunteer adult helpers. The Par
ents' Group is furnishing expenses,
while the cannery sprays the plants
and gives advice.
Profit Distribution
Any money that is made over
expenses will be divided betwen
the Parents' Group yearly fund, a
fund for new tools, and war bonds.
Manuel Lozano, student boss in
charge of the cucumbers, said when
questioned as to the progress of his
project, "We just got done cutting
the grass after the tractor got
through mowing it down."
Patricia White, who pilots a
squad of fifth graders, reminiscing
in true womanly fashion on the
day she was in charge of the proj
ect, said "That day we had all girls
and did everything."
Anne Hornby, questioned as to
the main trouble with the cucum
ber gardening, finally pointed out
that "After awhile the kids get
tired and their hoes seem to turn
over and don't cut very well."
Also, some people go too fast.
Manuel scornfully remembered
"one room that didn't know how to
cut grass at all . . . just went too
fast and made a lot of trouble."
Divided Labor
Gloria Wright commented, "Boys
work the cyckles, the girls clean
up after them." Gloria didn't seem
too bitter about this age-old un
balanced state of affairs.
The garden eolcmnist of the

s'.iil plugging along in the truck
gardening business, have been
raising radishes (their interest in
this crop is waning too), beets,
carrots, turnips, cabbages, Chinese
lettuce, lettuce, peas (just a few
to sample). If they accomplish
nothing else, they are at least de
veloping a taste for vegetables.
Even turnips taste fine when you
raise them yourself!
Already this season two crops of
turnips, lots of radishes, chard, and
.ettuce have been harvested. The
gardens are beginning to look bare.
Having experienced so much suc
cess in their truck garden ventures
on the school ground, the children
have attempted an even more am
bitious undertaking.
Quoting from the "Junior Citi
zen,'' newspaper edited by Cub
Scouts of the campus school (from
the garden column by Charles
Brand):
Loaned Land
"Did you know that the Campus
School has been loaned a half acre
of land by Mrs. Herbert Hoover?
It is to be plowed soon and we are
going to raise several kinds of
vegetables, among them cucum
bers. The cucumbers are to be
made into pickles which are a very
; :ood source of vitamins A and D.
Pickles are very rich in salt and
that is one reason we are selling
them to the Army indirectly. In
tropical countries one perspires a
>t, losing a lot of salt from the
body. It has to be put back.)
"Pickles," the young columnist
nnishes." are a very good source
f salt besides helping to keep up
soldiers morale."
The cucumbers are being grown

to sell to a nearby cannery to fill
an Army contract. The garden is a
joint project. Children have done
the planting and will take care of
it until school is out. Boy and Girl
Scouts, Brownies, and Cubs will
cultivate and harvest in summer
under the School Parents' Club and
volunteer adult helpers. The Par
ents' Group is furnishing expenses,
while the cannery sprays the plants
and gives advice.
Profit Distribution
Any money that is made over
expenses will be divided betwen
the Parents' Group yearly fund, a
fund for new tools, and war bonds.
Manuel Lozano, student boss in
charge of the cucumbers, said when
questioned as to the progress of his
project, "We just got done cutting
the grass after the tractor got
through mowing it down."
Patricia White, who pilots a
squad of fifth graders, reminiscing
in true womanly fashion on the
day she was in charge of the proj
ect, said "That day we had all girls
and did everything."
Anne Hornby, questioned as to
the main trouble with the cucum
ber gardening, finally pointed out
that "After awhile the kids get
tired and their hoes seem to turn
over and don't cut very well."
Also, some people go too fast.
Manuel scornfully remembered
"one room that didn't know how to
cut grass at all . . . just went too
fast and made a lot of trouble."
Divided Labor
Gloria Wright commented, "Boys
work the cyckles, the girls clean
up after them." Gloria didn't seem
too bitter about this age-old un
balanced state of affairs.
The garden eolcmnist of the
"Junior Citizen" speaks the prini
ples of these young victory gar
deners. "Weeds seem to grow
faster than vegetables . . . did you
know that weeding is a good exer
cise for tall people?"
In another issue of "Junior Citi
zen" Master Brand begins: "This is
a right up of Mr. Langly's speaches.
He broadcasts every Monday and
Wednesday at 7:15.
"Hellow, how is your garden
coming? If you haven't got one
you had better get going because
there isn't enough being grown in
commercial fields to feed the coun
try."
With apologies to Columnist
Brand and to the eminent grown
up garden authority from which he
gets his information, and for the
benefit of Stanford readers who
may be planning to start a victory
garden themselves, we quote on.
"For faster germination of beets,
put them (the seeds) in a bag and
pound them with a hammer. This
divided the seeds from the pulp and
it does not take so long for it to
grow."


CHILDREN at the Campus School work in gangs, planting, weeding, watering and harvesting their Vie
tory Gardens.
