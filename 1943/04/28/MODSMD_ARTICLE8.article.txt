# Some Forsake Foxtrot for Folk Dancing
## 
### 
"All jump up and never come
down, grab your honey and swing
her around."
"Allemande left and left alle
mande, right and left and right
and left grande."
Such phrases have become part
of the college education of a hardy
group of Stanfordites, who, forsak
ing (ho fox trot and other such
ballroom maneuvers, have been
putting in some strenuous evenings
perfecting the fine art of folk
dancing.
Community Center
Scene and sponsor of all this ac
tivity is the Community Center in
Palo Alto, which inaugurated a
folk dancing program some four or

five years ngo. A pioneer in the
revival of folk dances, the Com

well known for its frequent folk
dancing sessions.
Part of the city's recreational
system, the folk dances now at

Stanford residents. So great is the
attendance that the sessions have
been subdivided into one on Thurs
day for aduits and one on Friday
for high school and junior high
school students.

Hambo or the Texas Schottische.
He's been a folk dance enthusiast
since a year and a half ago.
That folk dancing is far more
strenuous than ballroom dancing is
tiie contention of Mr. Carpenter,
who says that two hours of it leave
him feeling like he'd been over the
obstacle course.
As proficient at teaching folk
dancing as he is at teaching his
tory, Professor Maxwell Savelle
heads the faculty list of folk

dancers.
Authentic Dances
Most of the dances performed arc
authentic, as is the accompanying
music. A majority of them are of
foreign origin, coming from Spain.
Russia, Italy, and Denmark par
ticularly.
Besides square dances, the only
folk dances that are called, the
United States is represented among
the favorites by the Cuckoo Waltz.
Especially popular are foreign
products, the Korobushka from
Russia, the Hambo from Sweden,
and the Schottisehc from Denmark.
And all this cosmopolitan atmos

with two cood, strong feet, the foik
