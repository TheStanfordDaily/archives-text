# Two Big Games Suggested in Grid Shaken p

### 
If Stanford has enough men to
field a team next fall, if transporta
tion problems can be worked out
satisfactorily, and IF the proposal
is passed by the conference in June,
Stanford will meet California in
football twice this year.
The announcement came from Ar
nold Eddy, business manager of ath
letics at the University of Southern
California, after Eddy, A1 Masters
of Stanford, Clint Evans of Califor
nia, and William C. Ackerman of
U.C.L.A. had conferred together in
Los Angeles yesterday.
An agreement was made that
would have these four universities,
which make up the southern portion
of the Pacific Coast Conference, play
each other twice during the season.
As to the northern half of the con
ference — Washington, Washington
State, Oregon State, Oregon, Idaho,
and Montana—which would be left
out of the proposed set-up, it was
suggested that they form a similar
schedule.
To arrive at a Pacific Coast cham
pion, a meeting between the north
ern and southern division winners
after the season's conclusion was an
other detail that will be up for
approval in June.
As to the purpose of the change
of schedule, Eddy announced:
"This proposed schedule is de
signed first to reduce team travel
to a minimum, and, secondly, it is
believed that under a home-and
home schedule, the annual exodus
of students from Los Angeles to San
Francisco and vice versa can be
avoided."
If the present suggestion passes
the board, the Card football team
will face the Bears in the season
opener on Sept. 25 at Stanford, and
again in Cal's stadium on Nov. 20.
The complete tentative suggesed
new conference schedule is as fol
lows:
Sept. 25—California at Stanford;
U.S.C. vs. U.C.L.A.
Oct. 2 — Stanford at U.C.L.A.;
U.S.C. at California.
Oct. 16—U.S.C. at Stanford; Cali
fornia at U.C.L.A.
Oct. 30—California at U.S.C.; U.C.-
L.A. at Stanford.
Nov. 13—Stanford at U.S.C.: U.C.-
L.A. at California.
Nov. 20—Stanford at California.
Nov. 27—U.S.C. at U.C.L.A.
