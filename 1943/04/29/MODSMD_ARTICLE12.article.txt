# STAMPS
## Drive Short of Previous Quota

''Buy a share in America" with the
purchase of more war bonds and
stamps today, the fifth stamp day of
the quarter.
"In a comparison to the stamp
sales of last quarter and this, it was
disappointing to see that in the fifth
week of last quarter $2,403 worth of
stamps alone had been sold," said
Carol Hurwitz, drive chairman.
"Although we were late in start
ing this quarter, having missed the
first Thursday because chairmen
were not appointed, we have a rec
ord of only $1,003 sales to date.
"Bond sales have been greatly im
proved but most of the students pur
chase stamps. Our enrollment has
dropped but not to this great an ex
tent," she continued.
The fact that there is a deficit of
$1,400 in this quarter's sales com
pared to last should be a reminder
for everyone to buy one or more
stamps today. They will be sold by
living group representatives, and on
the Engineering corner, English cor
ner, the Libe, and in the Cellar.
