## Cardinals Plan Housewarming 
### 
The Cardinal Nitery Housewarm-
J ing will be held tomorrow night
from 8:30 to 11:30. The purpose of
the dance is to help students be
} come acquainted with the Nitery
; and see its possibilities as a recre
j ation center.
j There will be dancing, to music
; by the Nitery juke-box, as well as
| ping pong. According to Callie Cur
tis, dance chairman, there will be an
j abundance of coke and cake and
j every one should have a good time.
Cardinals are planning to make
; the Niteiy the social spot of the
j campus. At their meeting last night
1 it was suggested that cartoons be
j brought down to place on the wall,
; as well as magazines and records.
"This is going to be our new gath
j ering place. Let's fix it up and see
that everybody gets the Nitery
! habit," said Miss Curtis.
''So far this quarter the Nitery
| has been more or less forgotten by
| the Stanford students, only a hand
j ful or so of people being there most
! of the time," she said.
