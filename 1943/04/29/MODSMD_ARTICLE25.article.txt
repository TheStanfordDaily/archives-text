# Professor Discusses Jap Pacts

In the first of the series of studies
on international commodity agree
ments done under grant of the
Rockefeller Foundation, Jozo To
masevich of the Stanford Food Re
search Institute asserted that Japan's
abrogation in 1940 of the 1911 inter
national fur-seal agreement was but
a small step in her general policy of
attempting to obtain a free hand in
the Pacific.
The Stanford food economist noted
that the necessary year's notice had
expired just six weeks before the
attack on Pearl Harbor.
Jap Justification
Tomasevich writes, "Japan justi
fied the withdrawal primarily by
saying the fur-seal herd has be
come too large and is proving in
jurious to her fishing industry, and
ostensibly Japan regarded the con
vention as outmoded and unadapted
to the present situation."
The influence of the war on the
fur-seal herd will depend upon the
war's duration and the extent to
which the Japanese may be able to
control and exploit the sea riches
an that part of the North Pacific
Ocean over which the Alaskan Prib
ilof herd of seals migrates.
Could Reduce Herd
Mr. Tomasevich declares that if
the Japanese should succeed in gain
ing control of the seal herd, they
could certainly reduce its number
considerably. It has been reported
that Japan has approved a govern
ment - operated company for seal
hunting and that the furs are to be
used for military purposes, while
the meat and oil are to be utilized

i for food.
"If this situation materializes, and
the fur seals prove an important re
source for the Japanese, the Amer
ican government may see itself
forced to reduce the herd deliber
ately during the mating season to
prevent the Japanese from utilizing
it," he says.
With the exception of this abroga
tion, international agreements for
the conservation of fur seals and
j the Pacific halibut fishery have been
| highly successful and can serve as
| encouraging examples for potential
agreements in the field of conserva
t tion of marine resources, the study
points out.
