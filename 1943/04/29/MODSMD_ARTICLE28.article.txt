# Hawaii University Describes War Work
## 
### 
The Stanford War Board has just
received a letter from Richard Kuy
kendall, chairman of the University
of Hawaii War Council, describing
the work that the council is doing,
Betty. Mae Hale, war board coordi
nator, said today.
The letter says in part, "One prob
lem that has bothered us and that
has probably caused you some con
cern, is the problem of finding new
ways to keep up the students' in
terest in the war effort. What kind
of publicity do you find most help
ful in stimulating students in volun
teer work?"
Interest Maintained
"Our student interest is main
tained," Miss Hale said, "not by any
thing that I can say or do, nor by
the stories which have come out in
the Daily, nor by the posters and
other campaigns which the War
Board has put on. The interest is
maintained because the women have
seen the men leaving, and they know
that it is up to them to do some
thing."
The letter proceeded to tell how
the War Council was founded.
"Our War Council was started as
a student project and has become
one of the leading organizations on
the campus. The council is composed
of four student members, appointed
by the Student Council of the A.S.
U.H., with ex-officio members as
needed and chosen by the regular
members. We have kept our group
small purposely to avoid the diffi

culty of getting a large group of stu
dents and faculty together at one
time.
Purpose of Council
"The purpose of the War Council,"
the letter continued, "is to initiate,
sponsor, coordinate, direct and in
tensify all campus activities connect
ed directly or indirectly with the
war effort. All groups and organiza
tions on the campus which contem
plate projects of a war effort nature
are supposed to present their plans
to us for our information, considera
tion, and approval.
"This semester we have devoted
all of our efforts to relieving the
labor shortage on the island of Oahu.
This labor shortage became so acute,
especially in the pineapple fields and
canneries, that the university ad
ministration put our academic work
on a five-day basis instead of on our
regular six-day basis of classes.
Labor Shortage
"This leaves Wednesday free for
student and faculty participation in
relieving the labor shortage. At
registration for the current semester
each student was requested to sign
up for special war work on Wednes
days. There are several different
categories of work that are being
done by our students on this work
day. They are working for the OCD,
in first-aid stations, for the Hawaii
Chapter of the Red Cross and the
U.S.E.D., and more than half of our
students are working in the pine

apple fields and canneries.
"In addition to our Wednesday
Work Project, a limited amount of
student volunteer work for the Red
Cross and the OCD, we have spon
sored a lecture series on "The Situ
ation Today," with talks by business,
political, educational, and military
leaders in Honolulu.
War Stamps
A War Bond and Stamps booth
has been open two days a week in
the Student Union Building, and
our W.S.S.F. drive two weeks ago
netted nearly $1,800 from our stu
dent body of 900 students.
"The War Council is now hard at
work carrying out a rather exten
sive semester program of war work.
We are also setting up plans for a
greatly expanded program for our
1943 fall semester, which we hope
will include not only the students
and faculty, but our Agricultural
Experiment Station, the Extension
Service and all of the University
clerical staffs."

categories of work that are being
done by our students on this work
day. They are working for the OCD,
in first-aid stations, for the Hawaii
Chapter of the Red Cross and the
U.S.E.D., and more than half of our
students are working in the pine

apple fields and canneries.
"In addition to our Wednesday
Work Project, a limited amount of
student volunteer work for the Red
Cross and the OCD, we have spon
sored a lecture series on "The Situ
ation Today," with talks by business,
political, educational, and military
leaders in Honolulu.
War Stamps
A War Bond and Stamps booth
has been open two days a week in
the Student Union Building, and
our W.S.S.F. drive two weeks ago
netted nearly $1,800 from our stu
dent body of 900 students.
"The War Council is now hard at
work carrying out a rather exten
sive semester program of war work.
We are also setting up plans for a
greatly expanded program for our
1943 fall semester, which we hope
will include not only the students
and faculty, but our Agricultural
Experiment Station, the Extension
Service and all of the University
clerical staffs."

The Stanford War Board has just
received a letter from Richard Kuy
kendall, chairman of the University
of Hawaii War Council, describing
the work that the council is doing,
Betty. Mae Hale, war board coordi
nator, said today.
The letter says in part, "One prob
lem that has bothered us and that
has probably caused you some con
cern, is the problem of finding new
ways to keep up the students' in
terest in the war effort. What kind
of publicity do you find most help
ful in stimulating students in volun
teer work?"
Interest Maintained
"Our student interest is main
tained," Miss Hale said, "not by any
thing that I can say or do, nor by
the stories which have come out in
the Daily, nor by the posters and
other campaigns which the War
Board has put on. The interest is
maintained because the women have
seen the men leaving, and they know
that it is up to them to do some
thing."
The letter proceeded to tell how
the War Council was founded.
"Our War Council was started as
a student project and has become
one of the leading organizations on
the campus. The council is composed
of four student members, appointed
by the Student Council of the A.S.
U.H., with ex-officio members as
needed and chosen by the regular
members. We have kept our group
small purposely to avoid the diffi

culty of getting a large group of stu
dents and faculty together at one
time.
Purpose of Council
"The purpose of the War Council,"
the letter continued, "is to initiate,
sponsor, coordinate, direct and in
tensify all campus activities connect
ed directly or indirectly with the
war effort. All groups and organiza
tions on the campus which contem
plate projects of a war effort nature
are supposed to present their plans
to us for our information, considera
tion, and approval.
"This semester we have devoted
all of our efforts to relieving the
labor shortage on the island of Oahu.
This labor shortage became so acute,
especially in the pineapple fields and
canneries, that the university ad
ministration put our academic work
on a five-day basis instead of on our
regular six-day basis of classes.
Labor Shortage
"This leaves Wednesday free for
student and faculty participation in
relieving the labor shortage. At
registration for the current semester
each student was requested to sign
up for special war work on Wednes
days. There are several different
categories of work that are being
done by our students on this work
