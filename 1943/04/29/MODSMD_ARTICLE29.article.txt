## Farm Food institute Reports On Wheat Yields and Outputs 
### 
The Stanford Food Research Institute lias recently issued a study made
by Vladimir Timoshenko, economist in the institute and professor of com
modity economics, on the regional aspects of '"Variability in Wheat Yields
and Outputs" as one of its series of studies of the world wheat problem.
Such a study represents data which is available, not only in the analysis
of the world wheat market, but in +

connection with the national plan
ning and regulation of the several
wheat producing countries, and in
adjusting international agreements
regarding production and distribu
tion of the world's wheat supply.
Certain Frictions
"The contrasts," the study states,
"between the relative stability of the
world wheat yield and output and
the great variability of wheat yields
and outputs within some of the
4 vheat exporting countries, and di
versity in this respect among the
exporting countries themselves, must
be taken into consideration by those
who are responsible for planning un
der the new international wheat
agreement.
'"The great difference in the degree
of variability of the total wheat out
puts for Australia, Canada, and Ar
gentina on one side, and for the
United States on the other, may
create certain frictions in the func
tioning of an agreement if export
quotas for all exporters are fixed
and non-transferable.
Stable Total Supply
"It may also create difficulties in
the fixing of appropriate price differ
entials for various kinds of wheat
early in the season particularly for
the countries of the Southern Hemi
sphere, where outputs vary widely."
One of the conclusions made by
the study is that there is a relatively
stable total wheat output for the
world, although the output for the
various sections may vary widely.
Compensation Evident
"Great diversity in the fluctuation
ef regional yields results in a good
deal of compensation of unrelated
variations. Consequently, yields and
total production of wheat for the
large continental areas and for the
world as a whole show a consider
able degree of stability," Timo
shenko says.
The variability relative of the
North American areas west of the
Mississippi has tended to increase,
"presumably because of the expan
sion of wheat acreage on land with
'ess favorable characteristics." On
Ihe other hand, the variability of re
gional yields in Australia has tended
to decrease.
Policy of Reduction
"The different tendencies in the
â€¢variability of wheat yields," the
.study concludes, "may serve in some
degree as guides for future wheat
policies in the respective regions.
"Increasing variability of wheat
yield in the United States and the
Prairie Provinces of Canada may
serve as a danger sign pointing to
cverexpansion of wheat in these
areas and call for a policy of re
duction of wheat acreage on mar
ginal land."
