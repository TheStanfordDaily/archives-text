i former varsity football star, were '
among the men graduated as ensigns |
in the United States Naval Reserve
at the Reserve Midshipmen's School, !

The young naval officers, complet
ing an intensive three month's
course in navigation, seamanship,
and gunnery, will now be assigned
to combat duty as deck officers with
the fleet.
The other three men, all from San
Francisco, were Lionel Mason Alan

Balshone. Both Vucinich and Alan
son received their bachelor's degrees
from Stanford and the other two,
their master's.

Two more Stanford alumni, Ralph
Fleming Clark and Edward F. Ca
liill, both of San Francisco, have re
ceived commissions in another
branch of the service, the Army Air
Force.
Both were commissioned as second
lieutenants. Before they get actual
combat assignments, they will re
ceive additional instruction at post
graduate flying schools in the types
of bombing and fighter planes they
will use in actual combat.
In the graduating class were repre
sentatives from every state in the
nation, as well as France, Canada,
Hawaii, Puerto Rico, and Alaska.
This was the fourth class to be re
leased in 1943.

Two former Stanford women,
Elizabeth J. Woodin of Sacramento,
and Ruth A. Sawyer of Hastings-on-
Hudson, N.Y., have been promoted
to second officers in the WAAC. This
corresponds to the rank of first lieu
tenant in the regular Army. Second
