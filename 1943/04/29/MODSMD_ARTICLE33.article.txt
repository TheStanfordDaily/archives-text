## Baubles Drive Ends Tomorrow 
### 
How masy fox-holes have you
! dug this week? Don't you have any
I junk jewelry? The Army needs all
| the flashy trinkets they can get to
give natives in the Solomons in ex
-1 change for their digging fox-holes.
The natives prize this jewelry,
j most of which is of no real value,
j and will do any sort of labor for
J earrings, bracelets, broches, and
[ necklaces. The Army in the South
I Pacific is clamoring for costume
jewelry because the natives do not
j like to work for money.
Ends Tomorrow
The campaign being carried on
j here under the leadership of Nancy
Nichols .drive chairman, will end
! tomorrow. All jewelry must be
handed in to the War Board olfice.
But any girls who have jewelry at
j home, that they no longer want, are
; urged to bring it into the War Board
| office any time.
"Good jewelry is not wanted, only
10-cent store 'junk,' the gaudier the
better. Haven't you any old earrings,
j novelty pins, bright colored beads,
jor jangle bracelets that no longer
I appeal to you?
Treasures
"They may seem like trash to you,
j and you wonder why you ever
! bought them, but to the natives they
i are like great treasures," says Miss
Nichols.
Turn this jewelry into the War
| Board office at once. Soon it will be
sent to tHe South Pacific and given
to natives who will carry wounded,
munitions, and supplies, dig trenches,
and build gun emplacements.

San Francisco's first public school
was opened in 1848.
