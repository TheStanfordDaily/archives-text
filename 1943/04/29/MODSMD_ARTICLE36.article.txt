## Indian Gridders May Scrimmage Tomorrow at 4 
### 
Fifty odd Stanford gridders will
probably put on their first spring
preview tomorrow afternoon at 4,
when Head Coach Marchie Schwartz
expects to put his squad through the
opening scrimmage of the year. The
scrimmage may possibly not be held
until Monday.
To date the Indian gridders have
been working almost exclusively on
the fundamentals of the famous "T"
formation, brought here in 1940 by
Clark Shaughnessy and continued
and doctored up a bit by Schwartz
last year.
Rim Obstacles
Following the scrimmage, the
squad will dofT their shoes and take
their weekly turn over the obstacle
course.
Schwartz was unable to announce
any definite lineups for the scrim
mage because the returning letter
men have been mixed in among the
newcomers during practice sessions.
In recent workouts, much time has
been devoted to teaching two new
quarterbacks, Bill Gully and Ted
Kenlield, the intricacies of that posi
tion in the T formation Returning
letterman Bob Andrews has also
been working with the pair.
Quarterbacks Work
Most of those back from last year's
squad have been operating in their
old positions, although Ross Dana
recently filled in at left half, and
Don Zappettini at full.
Daily practice turnouts, according
to Schwartz, have been excellent, an
average of about 43 gridders being
on hand each afternoon. The Card
mentor has been excusing six or
seven every day to compete in intra
mural Softball.
