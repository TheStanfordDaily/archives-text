north to absorb what should be an
other shellacking, this time from
Pitch Johnson's track forces.
The meet is scheduled for Angell
Field this Saturday, and, while not
expected to be close, may give dope
sters a better idea of just how good
the Card tracksters are this year.
Johnson is planning to shift his
men around a little against San Jose,
figuring they won't be any the worse

events. Johnny Fulton will prob
ably try the 100 and 880 instead of
the 220 and 440. Bob Compton may
confine himself to the two-mile,
Wayne Girdner may run the quarter,
and Floyd Cuff will definitely com
