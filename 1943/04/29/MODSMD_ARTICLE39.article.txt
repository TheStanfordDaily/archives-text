## 
### United Press 
Returning to the mound after his recent relief role in which he blanked
his opponents for four innings, Hiram Bithorn, ex-Hollywood star hurler
and now the property of the Chicago Cubs, pitched his teammates to a
seven-hit shutout against last year's world champions, the St. Louis
Cardinals.
It was the third time out of five starts this year that the Cards have

•■emerged with nothing but a row of
goose eggs to show for their after
noon's effort. Cincinnati's defeat of
the Pirates and the Cubs' win, tied
up the league and gave promise of a
hot pennant race.
