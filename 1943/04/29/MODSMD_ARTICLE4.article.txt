### Doug Hastings 
"Goody, goody, goody, the Cha
parral is coming out Friday!" So
sang the members of the staff of
the Stanford Daily as they went
through the ecstatic movements of
their nightly spring dance.
According to Murgatroyd Feep,
who sneaked into the print shop
two nights ago because she could
not wait until Friday, "The new
Chappie is really good." After
such high recommendation by this
so called previewer, who could
possibly resist the temptation to
buy one of these little nifties?"
The Old Boy was interviewed
yesterday in his office where he
was busily engaged in cutting out
paper dolls With his left hand,
putting out next month's Chappie
with his right, and beaming in
anticipation of the sight of hun
dreds of carefree boys and girls
tripping gaily to class in the light
of the April morn clutching 25-
cent pieces in their palsied hands.
"Won't they be pleased," he said,
"they've been waiting for days for
this occasion." At this point his
scissors slipped and he cut the
chair out from under himself.
