# Card-Don Game Is Postponed
## 
### 
Due to many complicated reasons,
the baseball game between Stanford
and the U.S.F. Dons has been post
poned until May 8. This will enable
the Dons to make up their cancelled
game wilih the California Bears,
originally scheduled for last Tues
day.
The whole schedule has been
thrown into a chaotic condition to
enable the Northern winner to travel
South to participate in the playoff
for state champion. In order for
California to qualify for the playoffs
it must have one more win in the
conference.
Three Dates
Another factor entering into the
picture is that only three dates are
available at U.S.C., the Southern
winner. These dates come at the
end of next week. They are the
only possible times that the Trojans
can compete, due to their final ex
aminations, which commence two
days after the games are to be
played.
So Stanford gave its date today to
enable the Dons to complete their
schedule against California.
Fond Hope
This championship game between
Northern and Southern California
winners has been the fond hope of
the northern coaches all season. The
conference is divided for the first
time this year due to the war into
the NCIBA and the SCIBA.
In order to preserve the idea of a
state champion the playoff system
was devised. The Southern mentors
were against the proposal at first,
and that is why it is necessary to
interrupt the schedule to enable the
program to go through.
