## 
### Late Williams 
At 9 a.m. Saturday, the Stanford
, golf team will tee off for their open
! ing match of the season at the Stan
ford golf course.
Strong as the Card's team appears
I on paper, stiff competition is expect
ed to come from the San Jose
Spartans.
The Spartans' claim for fame will
rest on the shoulders of Jack Bari
teau, captain of their last year's
| team, and one of the best golfers in
this area. Bariteau has won the
California Junior title, and is always
â–  near the top of the list in golf
| matches.
Supporting Bariteau will be Tony
Sota, Bob Cheiin. A1 Sheppard, Kave
Crowell, Pete Mesquita, and Dick
j Roderick.
Shoots 70
On the Indians' side of the list we
| find Bob Barber, whose best score
i over the home course this season has
! been a clean 70.
Dave Doud, captain of the team,
and most of the other members have
been threatening the 71 par mark.
At 9, the single matches will be
1 run off, with Doud, Barber, Jack

Wilson, George Traphagen, Jim La
i Gasa. and Bob Rosecrance the prob
able starters for the Farm,
In Afternoon
In the afterroon three two-man
leams from eaoh school will face
each other. Three men will be
taken from the Cards' morning round
list, and together with Bruce Cord
ingly, Jack Phillips, and Bill Lowe,
will meet three twosomes from San
Jose.
The whole match is rated a toss
up, with the Stanford team receiving
a slight edge. The Cards are rated as
one of the strongest teams on the
coast, while the Spartans are usually
conceded the second spot.
Trophy Awarded
Meanwhile the All-U tourney has
| been warming up for its start some
time next week. Sixteen players
