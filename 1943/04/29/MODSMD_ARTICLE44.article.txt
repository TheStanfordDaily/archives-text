# Six Points
## 
### 
RED CROSS home nurses heard a six-point
program for development of a good nurs
ing temperament the other night. Dr. Blake
Wilbur of Palo Alto offered the advice.
His six points are undoubtedly valuable to
nurses in their specific profession, but they are
general points which everyone might heed.
They apply now especially when hard work
and co-operation are indispensable in daily liv
ing.
Dr. Wilbur's program is:
"Be willing to work hard."
"Comply rigidly with the ethics of your
training."
"Use all your five senses hard."
"Take criticism in a spirit of friendship."
"Don't let the neighbors get you down."
"Don't talk about your own troubles."
Clearly and concisely, Dr. Wilbur has out
lined a code of living which can make indi
viduals successful in their personal lives. Per
haps even more important, these points, if fol
lowed, could make a whole people successful
and victorious.
Work hard. . . . Use your senses and the
ethics of your training. . . . Take criticism. . . .
Remember others' troubles befoe your own.â€”
