Page Mill has done much for Stanford.
Once again the opportunity has presented it
self for Stanford, in conjunction with the people
of Palo Alto, to help Page Mill.
A new barracks for officers has been recently
completed and the furnishing of the living room
has been turned over to the Service Library,
which will be helped by the camp and the
Red Cross.
Many of the fraternities are going to close at

ship of the houses is down and there is extra
furniture.
If the furniture is in good repair and sturdy
and if it is either overstuffed chairs or straight
chairs call Mrs. Frank Frost at Palo Alto 21435
or 9388.
Here is an opportunity to help the officers
and make a home for them away from home.

Those who play intramural baseball and
who are not among the tirst to get on the
field, so that they have to play on the old
field, are beginning to wonder why the field
is not mowed and rolled.
At best, the players are amateurs, and

when the field is rough and knee-high with
hay, it presents a serious problem to play
good ball.
