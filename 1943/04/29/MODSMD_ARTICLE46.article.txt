### CYCLONE COVEY 
The distinguished, in fact, unprecedented,
class of '44, which has probably been subjected
to more catastrophes as a class than any other
Stanford class as a class, will triumphantly
flaunt its Formal Foxtrot Folderol Saturday night
from 9 to 1 in the Women's Gym with free re
freshments and Gary Nottingham's orchestra
featuring Mona Low, bids $2.50 still on sale at
the A.S.S.U. office. (I am on the publicity com
mittee, they keep telling me.)
There will also be a maypole, a grande
marche, and a horse race lottery for queen of
the ball.
As I say, the juniors in flaunting this prom
are demonstrating their noble tenaciousness.
Of course, since everybody besides juniors
can come, the dance would still be given if Ted
Eberle were the only junior left. But as a class,
'44 has had a rough time. It is only its inherent
indomitability that has seen it through—its in
domitability and tuition money.
For back in the sping of '41, the class of '44
was dealt its first irreparable blow with whole
sale Athertonization. Then doubling up and
going summers, half the class, by their junior
year, were not even juniors. Next was the
fatal devastation of the draft. And now, what
is left of the men of the class are being killed
off every day on the obstacle course.

The obstacle course was designed and laid
out by Dr. O. N. Andersen, A1 Masters, and
Everett Dean, and construction was by Wells P.
Goodenough. It has come to my attention by
a man who has been maimed for life that here
it is nearly May and neither the contractor nor a
single one of the committee has run the course
to see if it is safe.
Let us hope the following rumor is true—
for it is the only honorable recourse—that one
of the committee has challenged Stanford's for
mer publicity man, Lieut. Don Liebendorfer,
now at St. Mary's, to a race over the course to
prove its safety officially for the Army.
Meanwhile, the policemen have been busy
running little Palo Alto boys away. The story
comes via reliable channels that when two such
young ones were being so shooed, one said to
the policeman:
"My daddy is Spike Jones and he said I
could play here."
To which the policeman replied, "Spike
Jones doesn't have a thing to say about this lot.
The only man with authority over it is A1
Masters."
Whereupon the other little boy stepped
forward and said, "My daddy is A1 Masters, and
he said I could play here."

Of course, since everybody besides juniors
can come, the dance would still be given if Ted
Eberle were the only junior left. But as a class,
'44 has had a rough time. It is only its inherent
indomitability that has seen it through—its in
domitability and tuition money.
For back in the sping of '41, the class of '44
was dealt its first irreparable blow with whole
sale Athertonization. Then doubling up and
going summers, half the class, by their junior
year, were not even juniors. Next was the
fatal devastation of the draft. And now, what
is left of the men of the class are being killed
off every day on the obstacle course.

The obstacle course was designed and laid
out by Dr. O. N. Andersen, A1 Masters, and
Everett Dean, and construction was by Wells P.
Goodenough. It has come to my attention by
a man who has been maimed for life that here
it is nearly May and neither the contractor nor a
single one of the committee has run the course
to see if it is safe.
Let us hope the following rumor is true—
for it is the only honorable recourse—that one
of the committee has challenged Stanford's for
mer publicity man, Lieut. Don Liebendorfer,
now at St. Mary's, to a race over the course to
prove its safety officially for the Army.
Meanwhile, the policemen have been busy
running little Palo Alto boys away. The story
comes via reliable channels that when two such
young ones were being so shooed, one said to
the policeman:
"My daddy is Spike Jones and he said I
could play here."
To which the policeman replied, "Spike
Jones doesn't have a thing to say about this lot.
The only man with authority over it is A1
Masters."
Whereupon the other little boy stepped
forward and said, "My daddy is A1 Masters, and
he said I could play here."
The distinguished, in fact, unprecedented,
class of '44, which has probably been subjected
to more catastrophes as a class than any other
Stanford class as a class, will triumphantly
flaunt its Formal Foxtrot Folderol Saturday night
from 9 to 1 in the Women's Gym with free re
freshments and Gary Nottingham's orchestra
featuring Mona Low, bids $2.50 still on sale at
the A.S.S.U. office. (I am on the publicity com
mittee, they keep telling me.)
There will also be a maypole, a grande
marche, and a horse race lottery for queen of
the ball.
As I say, the juniors in flaunting this prom
are demonstrating their noble tenaciousness.
