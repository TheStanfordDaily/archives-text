The Editor, Sir:
I am quite put out at you. My letters have
been kept out of the paper all this week. Why?
Also why don't you let the freshmen put out
the paper all the time? They were very good.
A good colored paper too.
Now, Mr. Editor, I would like to know the
following. Confidentially, do you think that
those abandoned cars back of the Chi O house
will ever be moved? I don't. I have given up
hope.
Also, Mr. Editor, I bought a subscription to
the Chappie a while back and I am beginning
to think that I was gypped in that there seems
to be no mag this month. Can I sue?
It might be a good thing for students at Stan
ford to talk to these soldiers here and to get
to know them. They aren't much different from
anyone else except they have on G.I. clothes
instead of jeans. They might even enjoy a little
divel. One Who Cares
