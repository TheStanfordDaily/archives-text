# WLB Appeals Coal Dispute
## 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON. April 28. â€” The
War Labor Board tonight submitted
the coal wage dispute to President
Roosevelt with what amounted to a
tacit appeal for intervention to halt
a threatened work stoppage by 450,-
000 soft coal miners.
The Board gave the President a
brief statement of the coal wage
dispute and a formal recommenda
tion for intervention, but it was
suspected that he would act within
24 hours to halt spreading wildcat
strikes in four states and to fore
stall a general work stoppage when
the current wage strike between
John L. Lewis' mine workers and
coal workers expires Friday.
Approximately (31.000 miners, im
patient for settlement of their de
mands for a two-dollar a day in
crease and dissatisfied with W.L.B.
intervention, already had ceased
work, and other "protest" walkouts
were expected.
"Under thvse circumstances," the
W.L.B. said, "the only possible
course for the Board to follow is
the course which is consistently fol
lowed where either the employees
or the employers defy an order of
the Board. The Board is therefore
referring this controversy to the
President in accordance with its es
tablished practice."
