### (By United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, North Africa, April 28.—British infantry
stormed half-way up the last hills shielding Tunis on the west front todav
while French Goumiers on the other front cut the Pont du Fahs-Enfida
ville road in a sudden shift of their attack which imperiled the flank o*
Axis troops facing the Eighth Army.
The dispatches revealed that spectacular developments could be ex
pected momentarily.
The Axis has kept the tempo of its resistance and, for the first time on

the African front, was employing
flame-throwing tanks. But its lir.e<
were straining almost to the buck
ling point in virtually every sector
American forces edged steadily
deeper into the enemy's mountai
defenses in the north, capturin .
three important hills guarding th
approaches to Bizerte. Above thei
French troops drove to within fiv
miles of Garaet Achkel, the fir.-
of Bizerte's two tidal kikes.
A battle of armor was in progres
in the area of Pont du Fahs, wit
the British First Army's right win
within three or four miles of th
town on the northwest, while th.
French sent patrols into the south
ern outskirts.
The weakest link in the entirt
Axis 115-mile line appeared to Ix
in the center where the First Army's
northern wing tried to cut it in two
by driving to Djebel Bou Aoukez.
Beyond that hill there lay only 22
miles of gently rolling plains before
Tunis.
In their co-ordinated advances o?
the last 36 hours, the Allies had
considerably strengthened their line
from the north coast to the Pont du
Fall's area, leaving only the almos:
impregnable Axis hill positions fac
ing the Eighth Army still intact.
But even there the Axis positior
grew more hazardous as a result o.
the spectacular French drive eas
from the Pont du Fahs area whicl
cut the Enfidaville road 15 miles
southeast of Pont du Fahs.
