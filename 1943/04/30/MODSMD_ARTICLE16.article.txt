# Cellar Asks for Student Help
## 
### 
As most students probably know, ]
the Union Cellar is now closed a j
large part of the afternon due to j
labor shortages. According to Miss
Ricker, director of the Cellar, this
is unnecessary. There are many stu
dents around the campus, especially
girls, who could work part time
in the afternoon to enable other stu
dents to enjoy the facilities offered
to them. If the situation does not
improve it is also very possible that
the Cellar will become nothing but
a mere cafe serving three meals a [
day. *
Something truly needs to be done
and it is up to the large man and
womanpower of the University to do
it. The situation is easy enough to
remedy if we only pitch in and do
nate our energy to it.
Girls are needed mainly as (1)
bus girls, clearing trays and carrying
trays to the kitchen; (2) dish wash
ing machine operators; and (3) other
small duties around the kitchen.
One or two hours during the morn
ing or afternon of any day during
the week would be an adequate con
tribution.
Six girls from Ventura have al
ready enthusiastically volunteered
for Thursday afternons, thus making
a group donation. If girls would

sign up with their friends it vvou
increase their enjoyment of the
contribution to the war effort. Ft
that is just what it is doing, helpii
to continue Stanford's traditions ai
keep up the campus morale. Thi
the hours will count towards eac
woman's contribution of war hours
The entire program will be pit
sented at the War Board Auxiliai
meeting Monday by Marilyn Sei
and if there are any girls interest*
in discussing the plan for its enac
ment they may contact Miss Seid
Lagunita Court.
