# 'Young Pitt' Drags a Bit, But Still Hit
## 
### 
"THE YOUNG MR. PITT," now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
"The Young Mr. Pitt," a Gaumont-
British production starring Robert
Donat, tells the story not only of
England's youngest Prime Minister
but also of that country's history
from the end of the American War
for Independence to Napoleon's
great naval defeat at the hands of
Lord Nelson.
The fiery career of William Pitt is
excellent material for a motion pic
ture if only because it demonstrates
so well the hot and cold running
opinions of the "people." Sometimes,
however, the pictures seems to drag
a little, especially toward the end.
This seems to be a common fault of
all historical films.
Robert Donat as William Pitt is
excellent. He is an actor who is
never guilty of a mediocre perform
ance. Others outstanding in the cast
are Robert Morley and John Mills.
The best scene in the picture is a
rotund little King George in swim
ming attire timidly testing the water
with his big toe and then gradually
emersing himself while the onlook
ing people cheer and the band plays
"God Save the King."
I wish Engish films had the benefit
of Holywood's superior photography
and recording for otherwise they are
I often head and shoulders above our
home products.
What Pitt said in his time—about
! the menace to Engand brought by
j Napoleon, is equally true today of
Hitler's menace. He said, "We are
fighting armed fanatics led by an
j arch fanatic."
The second feature is "Three
I Hearts for Julia," witti Ann Sothern
| and Melvyn Douglas, which, despite
j its well worn plot is a gay and fairly
entertaining little comedy—Hoyt
