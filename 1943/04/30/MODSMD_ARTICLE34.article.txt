# Card Crew To Meet Bears at Berkeley Tomorrow
## 
### 
At 5 tomorrw afternoon in the '
Oakland Estuary, Cal and Stanford';
will clash again, and this time it's j
not football, but crew. The frosh '
boat will start the races at 5, fol- j
lowed by the Jayvee crew, and the j
climax will come when the Varsity j
takes to the water to try to show Cal
that they've been having heavy |
workouts since Cal's Varsity crossed
the finish line four and a half feet j
ahead of Stanford last fall in an off- !

season race.
> Coach Carl Pedcrsen's oarsmen
| will try out a new style of rowing
! that they've been practicing since
j their first race of the season against
U.C.L.A. two weeks ago, and accord
j ing to reports of the crewmen, it's
faster, quicker, and more powerful,
: and should take off about 20 seconds
I in the two-mile pull. The crew's
; time on Wednesday was clocked at
! 11:10. But the time can change either

one way or the other depending on
water conditions, the wind, etc.
This has nothing to do with row
ing, but it's interesting to note that
last quarter the Varsity crewmen
averaged plus 21.
Stanford's Varsity crew will be
lined up like this: 1, Bud Clary; 2,
Ken Young; 3, John Wise; 4, Welko
Gasich; 5, Burt Avery; G, Tony Med
ved; 7, Ned Gates; stroke, Paul
Schute; cox, Walt Drake.

j is lined up like this: 1, Jack Rock
well; 2, Frank Nicol; 3, Marshall
J Robinson; 4, George Wendell; 5, Jim
