# STANFORD VS. CALIFORNIA
## Stanford Baseballers To Play California Bears Tomorrow 
### 
Tomorrow at 3 p.m. is the time for the inaugural of the annual tln-ee
game series between the baseball nines of California and Stanford. The
game will be played on the Sunken Diamond and will feature the first ap
pearance of the Northern Loop winners on the Farm this season.
It is perhaps an anti-climax that these two rivals should meet after the

league crown has already been de
cided but the game promises to be a i
thriller all the way.
Strong Team
California has come up with the j
strongest team seen in these parts j
in many years and has walked i
through all competition so far. The j
only tight squeeze that they have
experienced was an early season .
encounter with Santa Clara which !
vent 16 innings before the Bears
finally triumphed 6 to 5. Since that |
date the California team has had no J
trouble at all with league competi
tion and has shown many flashes of
brilliance in practice encounters,
shutting out the Oakland club of
the Pacific Coast League 9 to 0.
Stanford's record is a little differ
ent story, since they have won only i
one league encounter so far this j
season. However, that victory was !
against Santa Clara, the second
place team, and all indications seem
to point to the fact that the Reds
will come up much stronger this
weekend.
Big Hitters
California will rely upon the
strong hitting of both McLain and .
Sharp, their left fielder and catcher
respectively. Both these men are
batting around .440. To back them '<
up at the plate are Albright and I
Downson, smacking the ball at a
.100 clip.
Either Bob Weir or Jerry Hutton
is slated to take the hill for the 1
Bears and judging from their past
records the Reds, still slightly weak
at the place may have an even hard
er time tomorrow.
Miller Probable Starter
For Stanford, either Doc Mason or
Jack Miller will get the starting as- j
iignment. Miller has looked good in j
relief roles all season long and at |
the moment looks like the more
probable of the two, since Mason is I
still suffering with an injured back.
In the field there will be little I
change where the only doubtful j
starters are in the outfield. Coach :
Wolter still has four men vieing for
the three outfield berths and the I
choice is difficult to make. They
.should line up with Bill Cunha in i
left, Ed Washburn or Keith Pinion
fri center and Lloyd Merriman in j
right. The infield remains steady [
with Jay McKie at third, Bob Brown j
fit short, Jerry Roinstead at second,
and Howie Dallmar at first. The
combination has proved very effect -
ice afield, committing but a few
errors.
At the plate the Reds are still im
potent but Brown and Merriman are
due to shake their lethargy and if

that occurs anything can happen.
Dallmar has been hitting the ball
long in practice and should start
connecting for those extra base hits
that run the score up fast.
