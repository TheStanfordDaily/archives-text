TRACKSTER WRITES
Stanford had several distance run
ners in 1940 and 1941. A quiet kid
named Aubrey Seed was one of
them; not a great miler or two-mil -
er, but a good one.
Aubrey joined the Marines last 1
year, went into boot camp in San \
Diego as a pfc. Then he went to
Hawaii, became a corporal, and re
turned for officer's training on the j
mainland. He was in the Battle ot
Guadalcanal as a lieutenant, and
when he got back to his base after
his job in the Solomons was done,
he hurried off a V-mail letter to :
track coach Pitch Johnson.
The letter was long, pleasant, and
had one paragraph about his expe
rience on Guadalcanal, not dramatic,
but probably typical of all the para
graphs written home about that
phase of the Pacific struggle.
It read:
"We're back at our Pacific base j
after a short siege at Guadalcanal.
We were there for the "kill" and
helped to secure the island. We met
quite a bit of lead and unfortunately
left some of our buddies behind, but
we didn't have the fight forced to
us like the Marines who were there
before us. I have a bullet hole in
my dungaree jacket, a Jap pistol
and a setting sun flag, a little Jap
money and a lot of memories as
souvenirs of that ungodly hole, but
I'm ready for another crack at
them."
GRID COMMENTS
Here are a few sample comments
on the new grid proposal for Cali
fornia members of the Coast Con
ference. George Greene, graduate
manager of the University of Idaho:
"I don't see what the boys down
south are in such a hurry for. There
hasn't even been an official vote to
break up the league for the duration
yet."
Marchie Schwartz, Stanford head
j football coach: "I think the new
schedule will prove very interesting.
As for Stanford meeting California
in the opening game, I think that
J will work out all right too."
Bill Leiser, Chronicle sports cdi
j tor: "I'm not so sure what I think
|of it. It might prove highly inter
esting."
From these and other comments,
it appears the first shock of the dras
tic proposal has worn off, and that
most observers—managers, coaches,
1 and sportswriters alike—are in fa-
I vor of the idea. And it's a good guess
the public is for any setup such as
this that will give the Bay Area
more topflight games between the
i Indians, Bears, Trojans, and Bruins.

named Aubrey Seed was one of
them; not a great miler or two-mil -
er, but a good one.
Aubrey joined the Marines last 1
year, went into boot camp in San \
Diego as a pfc. Then he went to
Hawaii, became a corporal, and re
turned for officer's training on the j
mainland. He was in the Battle ot
Guadalcanal as a lieutenant, and
when he got back to his base after
his job in the Solomons was done,
he hurried off a V-mail letter to :
track coach Pitch Johnson.
The letter was long, pleasant, and
had one paragraph about his expe
rience on Guadalcanal, not dramatic,
but probably typical of all the para
graphs written home about that
phase of the Pacific struggle.
It read:
"We're back at our Pacific base j
after a short siege at Guadalcanal.
We were there for the "kill" and
helped to secure the island. We met
quite a bit of lead and unfortunately
left some of our buddies behind, but
we didn't have the fight forced to
us like the Marines who were there
before us. I have a bullet hole in
my dungaree jacket, a Jap pistol
and a setting sun flag, a little Jap
money and a lot of memories as
souvenirs of that ungodly hole, but
I'm ready for another crack at
them."
GRID COMMENTS
Here are a few sample comments
on the new grid proposal for Cali
fornia members of the Coast Con
ference. George Greene, graduate
manager of the University of Idaho:
"I don't see what the boys down
south are in such a hurry for. There
hasn't even been an official vote to
break up the league for the duration
yet."
Marchie Schwartz, Stanford head
j football coach: "I think the new
schedule will prove very interesting.
As for Stanford meeting California
in the opening game, I think that
J will work out all right too."
Bill Leiser, Chronicle sports cdi
j tor: "I'm not so sure what I think
|of it. It might prove highly inter
esting."
From these and other comments,
it appears the first shock of the dras
tic proposal has worn off, and that
most observers—managers, coaches,
1 and sportswriters alike—are in fa-
I vor of the idea. And it's a good guess
the public is for any setup such as
this that will give the Bay Area
more topflight games between the
i Indians, Bears, Trojans, and Bruins.
TRACKSTER WRITES
Stanford had several distance run
ners in 1940 and 1941. A quiet kid
named Aubrey Seed was one of
them; not a great miler or two-mil -
er, but a good one.

year, went into boot camp in San \
Diego as a pfc. Then he went to
