Their last date with Cal proved to be no more than a good tennis lesson
for the Stanford netters; however, Saturday they will be out to reverse the
procedure against San Jose State. The match is scheduled for the Stanford
tennis courts at 9:30 a.m.
The Spartans will send a team to the Farm that has so far emerged with

few years ago. Chang is still trying
to hit his top playing peak, but in
condition or not. he has received
only one defeat, that against U.S.F.
Cy Taylor, No. 3, like Chang, has
only one black mark against him.
The remainder of the singles men
are Frank San Silipo, Bert Landess,
and Roy Diedrickson.
For the doubles, Blesh will prob
ably start a combination of Parnay
and Chang, followed by San Silipo
and Diedrickson.
At Stanford, Coach Bugge is un
decided as to just what combinations
he will use, with the exception of
Ted Meyers, who will handle the

Thomas, and Terry Mullin, he will

them to act as officials for the
matches.
