# Spartans Meet Card Thinclads Tomorrow at 2
## 
### 
Pilch Johnson's Card thinclads go j
after a victory over the San Jose |
State Spartans as well as a few other
things tomorrow afternoon at 2 on I
Angell Field.
The Indians don't merely want to
beat the Staters; they want to run j
up a score comparable to the 107 '
points California's Bears compiled
against Tiny Hartranft's squad last j
week.
Also, there's a few personal duels
on tap which ought to furnish
enough excitement in themselves to
make the meet worth while. In the I
high jump, for instance, Indians j
Willard Smith and Bob '"Pete" Za
leska will be out to revenge a set- !
back handed them by Spartan Hal
Capers in the recent invitational
meet.
Horn Favored
The lanky Negro jumped six feet
three inches last week at California, j
which proves the two Cards are go
ing to have to- turn in their best
marks of the year to top him.
In the 40, Cards Wayne Girdner
and Dud Cramer will mix it with
Spartan Ken Horn in what should i
be the best race of the day. Horn
was under :51 last week, while both
Girdner and Cramer are good for
around :50 flat.
List Missing
Because San Jose's entry list had
not yet arrived last night, meet
dopesters are having trouble figur
ing out what kind of a margin the
Indians should run up. Pitch John
son's squad can be figured to score
about 80 points, with another 20
pretty much in doubt.
Besides the 440 and high jump,
the sprints, hurdles, pole vault, and
SSO look like the standout events on
the program.
Fulton in 100
In the 100, Farmhands Bob Fess
and Johnny Fulton may have things
all to themselves, but should get
plenty of competition from Card Bill
Quackenbush and Bill Mallon of San
Jose. In the 220, it will be Fess and
perhaps Cramer against Horn, with
the San Jose ace a slight favorite.
Indian Joe Mardesich and Spar
tans Bud Veregge and A1 Campion
resume a rivalry in the hurdles be
gun in the invitational meet. All
three are running the highs in
around :15.6.
Switch Likely
In the pole vault, Spartan Vern
Cooley, who hist year went over 13
feet six inches, goes up against
Claire Brenchley and Martin Ander
son.
Johnson indicated he may switch
his distance runners around a bit
Saturday. Floyd Cuff will definitely
run the mile, Bob Compton either
the mile or two-mile, and Dave Bills
probably the mile.
Johnny Fulton will run the 100
and 880, instead of the 220 and 440
he has been running in recent meets.
In the half, Fulton will get plenty of
competition from Card Glen Holtby
and Spartan Joe Ribera.
Over at California, the Bears will
be takiivg on Fresno State at the
same time, in another one - sided
contest.
