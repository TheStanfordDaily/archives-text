# Nitery Tonight
## 
### 
THE campus is beginning to get organized to
take care of the members of the STAR unit.
At first it was a shock, no matter how many
plans had tentatively been made, to have 150
soldiers arrive on the campus. Before this shock
had had time to wear off, there were 500 sol
diers at Stanford.
The Lagunita-Union formal was a step in the
right direction. There were mistakes, but it was
the first time that this had ever been done here
on as large a scale, and so the mistakes were
natural.
The Nitery dance tonight is another big step
in the right direction. This is a free, no date
dance. Furthermore, it will probably be a real
no date dance because, to entertain the soldiers,
several of the women's living groups have said
that they would go to the dance, and that they
would go stag.
This is actually in the Stanford tradition of
jolly-ups—but whether or not it is in the Stan
ford tradition, it is a very nice action, and one
that ought to be made more often.—Lucile
Thompson.
