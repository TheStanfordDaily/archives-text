# Come One and All
## 
### 
THE staff of the Stanford Daily will gather this
Sunday as usual at 12. The Editor will ad
dress words of wisdom to the night editors at
11:30, and then to his erring flock. The meeting
will adjourn in time for those members to get
to lunch whose living groups serve them lunch.
