# JUNIOR DANCE
## May Day Prom Set Tomorrow 
### 
This year's Junior Class Weekend,
: usually consisting of a Prom and
Water Carnival and general two days
i of festivities, is boiling down in the
i heat of the war to one Promâ€”one
! evening of gaiety. Tomorrow night
campus roughs and coeds and their
i guests will dance at the Juniors'
| May Day Prom from 9 to 1 in the
j Women's Gym.
Tickets are $2.50 and are still on
! sale in the A.S.S.U. office. Soldiers
as well as students are urged by the
dance committee to buy their bids
j early.
Mona Low Signed
Gary Nottingham and his band,
: long popular with Stanford students
1 and currently playing in the city,
will provide a variety of dance
music. Mona Low has been signed
I as the featured soloist.
Claire Carter and Bob McClean,
co-chairmen in charge of decora
| tions, have a crew of workers help-
I ing them decorate the gymnasium
! with lattice work and flowers to give
a springtime setting. With the aid
of engineering experts and the Corp
| Yard they hope to erect a Maypole
j in the center of the floor to carry out
! the spring motif in true May time
; style befitting a formal scheduled for
May 1.
May Queen Chosen
Toward the middle of the evening
a May Queen will be chosen. For
many centuries May Day has been a
festival in Europe and the United
j States and a queen has always been
|an essential part of the activities.
Every co-ed will have an equal
chance to be crowded with a garland
of flowers on a specially constructed
throne. Her majesty will be chosen
| when Ted Eberle, prom chairman,
i draws a number matching the num
ber on her partner's bid.
Following the "coronation" the
I queen and her consort will lead the
j grand march.
Free Refreshments
When the dancers tire of dancing
j among the soft lights and flowers
i they can promenade around the patio
where free refreshments of punch
and cookies will be served.
