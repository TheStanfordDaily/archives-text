### CYCLONE COVEY 
Comes the report from United Press that Pro
fessor Holland D. Roberts of Stanford's School
of Education has joined the pressure campaign
begun by the Communist Party to suppress pub
lication of Mark Alandov's The Fifth Seal, the
Book-of-the-Month Club selection for May.
Professor Roberts, according to one of the UP
articles, has threatened to boycott the Club in
his classroom unless the book is withdrawn. His
claim is that the novel interferes with United
Nations unity by satarizing the Soviet Union and
giving the impression that the whole Russian
government is one of tyranny and violence.
Upon which provocation, I read the book in
question, courtesy the Stanford Bookstore.
Whether Dr. Roberts has read the book, I under
stand is still in question. (One article said he
admitted he had not; another said he denied he
had admitted he had not.)
The novel, to my mind, is in nowise incen
diary, and I would further state flatly that it is
not at all as Dr. Roberts has accused. Though

it deals quite extensively in ideas, I cannot see
that any more philosophy is given any particu
lar precedence. It is more a satire of stuffy
European diplomacy itself than of any one gov
ernment. Here it might be inserted that the
two or three references to the United States are
almost reverent in tone; and that a climatic point
in the book is the young woman's decision to !
return from the artificial diplomatic atmosphere
to her home in Moscow—which is not very anti- 1
Russian. "Every action today is either for or
against fascism—there is no middle ground," Dr.
Roberts said. If that statement is really correct,
the unequivocal slur of Hitler throughout could
not make the book pro-fascist; and if Dr. Rob
erts' other arguments have any foundation, there
must be a middle ground.
But what I believe is the important point is
that, even should Dr. Roberts have correctly
sized his one objection, he has overlooked the
greater significance of other points, as well as
the book's literary qualities.
Though I doubt if the theme (of disintegrat
ing Europe before 1939) or the characters (three
of the main figures are old men) will be any
too appealing to American readers, the writing
is on a high plane. Aldanov's acute psycho
logical penetration of his characters is in the
most admirable Russian tradition.
I would make a further observation, which
would not be confined to The Fifth Seal. And
that is, when Dr. Roberts claims 'something in
the novel is propaganda, he is arguing a priori.
For we do not know enough about inside Russia
during the period under discussion to say this
is truth and that is propaganda. If, for example, '
Stalin came to power by violence—and it is
plausiable to me that he did—, let us not pre
tend that he came to power otherwise because
of Russia's magnificent fighting, which has per
haps saved us. That does not change facts.
And if Aldano vis anti-Soviet (and remember
most of the United States was before 1940), he
is definitely not anti-Russian, which point is
rarely to be doubted by the reader. And the
views expressed by the characters are very
probably pre-war views held by much of Eu
rope, and would more properly be considered ■
as historical than as incendiary.
