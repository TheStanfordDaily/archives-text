The Editor, Sir:
When the Spring Sing was inaugurated sev
eral years ago nearly ever yliving group on cam
pus entered and started a successful tradition.
But this tradition v/ill not survive the war if the
students, especially the men, don't hurry, get
organized and enter the event, which is next
Wednesday.
Even if the best voices in the house have
gone into the army, any group can certainly
gather together ten men and learn a song. It
doesn't have to be perfect; enthusiasm is a lot
more important.
No matter how large the audience is Wednes
day, the Sing cannot be a complete success
unless every living group actively participates
and contributes to the entertaiment.
As the poet said: "You aren't worth a thing
if you don't enter the Sing." Enthusiastic.
The Editor, Sir:
One Who Cares has written several letters
to this column in which he has asked that the
Salvage Committee -take action and remove the
abandoned car from the Chi O's alley.
I would like to tell "One Who Cares" that
we have taken all the action we can. The car
was owned by the president of the Alpha Sig
house; however, he had sold the car to a junk
man in Palo Alto prior to the first letter written
by "One Who Cares." Consequently, the
Salvage Committee can not remove a car which
belongs to a junk collector. It is his and when
he has time, we hope, as much as "One Who
Cares," that he will remove the car.
