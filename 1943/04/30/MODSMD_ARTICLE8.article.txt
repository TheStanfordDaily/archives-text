# Houses Slow In Stamp Drive

### 
"Stamp and bond sales were gen
erally good today, but there seems
to be a lack of co-operation among
the fraternities," said Carol Hur
witz, chairman of the Stamp Drive.
"Many fraternities not only don't
report their results, but many do
not even attempt to sell stamps
within their groups. Even though
there are only a few fellows left in
these houses, if those few could buy
a stamp once in a while, it would
help because we need everyone's co
operation. These houses are Theta
Delt, Beta, Sigma Chi, D.U., Alpha
Sig, Theta Chi, Zete, and Phi Sig,"'
she concluded.
Other results were: Sororitiesâ€”
Alpha Phi, Pi Phi, Gamma Phi. A.
