# John L. Lewis Ends Coal Strike Before Roosevelt's Speech
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, May 2 (UP). —John L. Lewis tonight ended temp
orarily the coal miner strike of 530,000 men, pending a further 15-day
period of contract negotiations.
His order was issued dramatically in New York 20 minutes before
President Roosevelt broadcast an appeal for the miners to return to work
and keep vital war production going.*

The return - to - work announce
ment of the leader of the United
Mine Workers of America was the
result of a secret parley here earlier
today between Lewis and Solid Fuel
Administrator Harold L. Ickes.
The miners are to be back to work
by Tuesday.
Mr. Roosevelt presumably was
aware of the Ickes meeting and its
results, but made no allusion to it
in his address in which he pitted
the miners' patriotism against their
demands for a two-dollar-a-day
wage increase.
In the absence of any official gov
ernment statement, it appeared the
United Mine Workers chieftain and
Ickes had concluded an agreement
whereby the miners and operators
would reopen negotiations for both
bituminous and anthracite indus
tries, with Ickes presumably acting
as chief mediator.
Lewis made the announcement
after a brief discussion with the
United Mine Workers' International
Policy Committee, which he called
into session as a result of the con
ference.
''The policy committee of the Uni
ted Mine Workers,'" Lewis said,
'"agrees by unanimous vote of its
membership to restore all mines to
operation for a period of 15 days
beginning Tuesday, this period to be
used in consolidation."
