## 10 Intramural Softball Games Get Underway Tonight at 7:15

Intramural Softball wars will be
renewed tonight in the first of the
scheduled twilight games. Twenty
teams are scheduled to play ball at
7:15 p.m. on the ten diamonds listed
in last Friday's DailyT
Due to the increased number of
games coming off at the same time,
there will be a greater demand for
umpires. When the teams were meet
ing with only five games spread over
a period of two hours, there still
was a shortage of "peace-keepers."

regulating a soltball game, to get in
touch with him immediately.
