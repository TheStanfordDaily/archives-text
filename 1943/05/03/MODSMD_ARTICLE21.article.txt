# On Cleaning-Up
## 
### 
FOR a little over a week, some students ex
plored devious methods to greet the newest
members of the Stanford Family, the soldiers
of the STAR unit. They wished the men to un
derstand they were a part of the student body.
They wanted them to enjoy, as much as pos
sible, the pleasures of campus life.
So the soldiers were invited to the Lagunita-
CJnion formal. And later last week, the Nitery
held open house for them, too. A large number
of men attended these functions, and they must
have enjoyed themselves. In fact, they must
have enjoyed themselves immensely, for the
mornings after, they came back again.
These later visits weren't for more fun. To
express their appreciation for the evening's en
tertainment, they returned to man brooms and
maps. Previously appointed clean-up commit
tees were delighted by their efficiency. With
true Army thoroughness they came, worked,
and in a short time left spotless rooms be
hind. In a most commendable and expres
sive way, they showed their thanks.
And at the same time, they perhaps proved
that the wishes of some students were realized.
In what better way could they seem a part of
the student body than working on a clean-up
committee!— Jane Glasson
