# No Sympathy

NO MATTER what, the miners in the soft
coal mines should not have left the collier
ies.
It is difficult to appraise the demands of the
miners and the stand of John L. Lewis when we
are at war and the stoppage of coal hinders
our all-out effort. Coal mining may be under
paid by the standards of the wages that are
found in the West Coast shipyard, but this
should not have called for the strike which has
such serious consequences.
When the entire ation is pointing toward vic
tory, the coal strike is hard to take. After hear
ing the conditions of battle on Guadalcanal,
and what the British Eighth Army goes through
to take a few miles of desert, it seems small
and unimportant whether the workers are paid
"portal-to-portal" or only for the time they ac
tually mine coal.
The economy of the Eastern part of the
United States and a major part of the armament

producing plants are already threatned by the
strike. A cutailmnt of rail traffic and a nation
wide dimout may be necessary.

Taking into consideration the effect that the
wage increase would have on inflation in the
United States, the high handed manner that
John L. Lewis has handled the whole thing, re
fusing to use the War Labor Board, and the 1
effect that the coal stoppage, however tempor
ary, is having on the war effort, we can find
little sympathy for the strike or the demads
until the war is over.
