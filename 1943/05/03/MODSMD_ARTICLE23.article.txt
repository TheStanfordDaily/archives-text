### CYCLONE COVEY 
At every turn belying the administrative de
cree that they shall not be considered a part of
the student body, the STAR soldiers in two
weeks have become a welcomed and assimi
lable complement of Stanford student life.
They are to be seen at dances, at chapel, the
Tuesday Series, the Cellar, the lake, and even
auditing classes. And some have begun to fre
quent the women's living groups, and otherwise
to fall into the customs of the Stanford rough.
Women who probably admitted their names
cautiously to the date bureau arranged for
dances, invariably found the STARS first-rate
gentlemen. Saturday morning following the
big Nitery function, the dance chairman, about
to begin clean-up of the night before, looked
up to behold a body of about 25 STARS march
through the door and set merrily about a spic
and-span revamping.
The choir is one campus organization which
has acquired active participation of STAR men.
. . . Pvt, Edwin Kappel amazed the ears of
Sunday's congregation in Memorial Church
with a terrific tenor solo.
And so the STARS have become an integral
part of Stanford in wartime.

At a large university in the Midwest which
has had a great influx of soldiers and sailors
for special training, antagonism between civilian
and uniformed students is so acute that the
whole social life of the campus has had to be
strictly regulated.
Certain nights are reserved for the men in
uniform, and certain nights for the ordinary
men students. No function is permissible at
which both can attend; for however formal, it
would inevitably end in a brawl.
That university is an example of what has
sometimes happened when armed forces have
taken over a part of college facilities. Nothing
of the kind, we now know, would ever happen
here.
