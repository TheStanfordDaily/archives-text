The Editor, Sir:
Last Saturday night I received a terrific jolt!
Hardly had I checked my hat and umbrella be
fore waltzing into the Women's Gym—here it
was, the Junior Prom, at last another Eberle pro
duction—hardly, I say, had I seated myself on
the queen's chair and began to pull my date
onto my lap before horror paralyzed me! That
chair! That throne! Could it be? Shock and
disappointment mingled freely in me. All eve
ning I had been anticipating the splendor and
glory of a Cardinal and White throne. This, I
saw with shame, was of BLUE and GOLD. A
chill came over me. I cast a quick eye about
the crowded (you're welce, Ted) dance floor,
looking for the explanation.
I put it up to you. We need, we must have,
an investigation. Did this atrocity arise from an
ignorant oversight or from rank sabotage?
I lay this matter before you and our student
body, who, I hope, have the intelligence and
courage to see that this wrong shall be ac
counted for. Indignant.
