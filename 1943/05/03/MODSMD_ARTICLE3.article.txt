# Gift-Supported Schools Upheld

Independently-supported universi
ties are today symbols of indepen
dent thinking, and scholarship and
should remain a bulwark against
standardization, J. Hugh Jackson,
dean of the Stanford University
Graduate School of Business, declar
ed Saturday before the spring meet
ing of the Western College Associa
tion on the U.C.L.A. campus.
In outlining the financial picture
of gift-supported institutions, the
Stanford dean pointed out that de
spite continued leceipt of new gifts
and some actual increase in income
from endownment funds, the de
mands for higher education have in
creased at a much more rapid rate
than either the principal of endow
ment funds or the income from it.
Increasing tax loads upon individual
citizens have made them less able to
support colleges and universities by
endowment.
"Under the circumstances, when
both endowment income and student
fees scarcely meet the increased cost
of continually expanding educational
programs, one of the chief dangers is
that the independently-endowed col
leges and universities will welcome
federal aid to bail them out of their
difficulties." Mr. Jackson said.
'"It would be a tragedy, bot to the
independent and the public institu
tion, were this to happen."
