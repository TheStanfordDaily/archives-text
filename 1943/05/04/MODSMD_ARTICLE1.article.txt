# Ehlers To Play Harpsichord at Series Tonight
## 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
'"It was just two years ago that I
made my first appearance at Stan
ford," said Madame Alice Ehlers,
internationally known harpsichord
ist, who will appear with the Stan
lord Orchestra in the Tuesday Eve
ning Series tonight at 7:30 in Me
morial Auditorium.
"I love playing on college cam
puses to the students because they
are ready to take an active interest
in the program and do not assume
the blase attitude of some audiences
I have seen," she continued.
Benefit Concert
Madame Ehlers studied with Al
bert Schweitzer who gave up a
career as organist and theologian to
take up medical work among Afri
can natives. She has just played at
a benefit concert at Pomona College
to help support his hospital at
Lambarene, near Dakar.
'"My engagements have taken me
all over the world. The only coun
tries in which I have not presented
concerts are China and Japan. In
1938 I was leaving Alexandria for
America when I heard that Hitler
had invaded Vienna, my home. I
haven't returned to Europe," she
added .
Command Performance
'"Since I have been in Los Angeles
I have been making a series of
broadcasts from the University of
Southern California and these broad
casts led to one of the most enjoy
able experiences I have known."
Madame Ehlers explained that at
the conclusion of one of her broad
casts, the War Department requested
her to appear on the Command Per
formance Show which is sent over
seas by shortwave,
I was deeply moved that I was al
lowed to play my harpsichord and
talk to the boys overseas. I feel that
I really belong to this country now."
Stanford Symphony
The Stanford Symphony will open
the concert with Vivaldi's Concert
Grosso for String Orchestra. Then
Madame Ehlers will join Ferenc
Molnar, violinist and conductor, and
Willard J. Flashman, flutist, in Bach's
Brandenburg Concerto No. 5.

This will be followed by a group
of four solo selections by Madame
Ehlers, Pavane, by William Byrd;
Courante, by Jean-Baptiste Lully;
Waltze, by Mozart; and Tambourin,
by Jean-Philippe Rameau. Joseph
Haydn's Concerto for Harpsichord
in D major will conclude the pro
gram.
The Stanford symphony is com
posed of Stanford students, faculty,
and alumni.
