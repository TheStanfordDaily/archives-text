## Stanford Nine To Meet Gaels Today at 1:30 
### 
Despite the previous record the
Stanford baseballers are pointing for
a win this afternoon when they meet
St. Mary's in a doubleheader here.
Tlie twin bill will commence at 1:30
p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
It will be the second time these
two teams have faced each other this
year, St. Mary's emerging victorious
in the first encounter. Despite this
fact, the Reds look like the choice
for today since that early season win
was made before the Cards had
reached their peak.
Dot Mason O.K.
Another encouraging factor was
the return of Doc Mason, No. 1 In
dian hurler, to good health. Coach
Harry Wolter expects to use him in
the first game. His second game
choice will be between Bernard
Woody, the hard luck boy, and Jack
Miller.
For the Gaels both Marv Kranda
and Tony Compagno should see ac
tion. It was Compagno who shut
the Stanford men out at St. Mary's
and the "Iron Man" is expected to
oppose Mason today.
Lineup Unchanged
The rest of the lineup for the Reds
should be the same as opposed the
Bears last Saturday. Wolter is still
depending upon Lloyd Merriman,
Bob Brown, and Howie Dallmar to
connect and start driving in the runs.
The outfield should see Bill Cunha,
Merriman and either Keith Pinion
or Ed Washburn. The infield should
remain the same as it has been all
season.
For St. Mary's the same men
should face the Reds as did the last
time. This may be a break, for the
Gaels' fielding was anything but ex
cellent.
No Admission Charged
The B.A.C. announced that no ad
mission will be charged for the
double feature and it is hoped that
a large crowd will turn out to en
courage the players.
