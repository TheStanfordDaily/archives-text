# Five Dollars a Day
## 
### 
FIVE dollars of the student body's money walks out of the
Cellar every day in the pockets and purses of students who
neglect to pay their checks. Much of this is undoubtedly the
result of absentmindedness but that in no way excuses it nor
makes up for the financial loss.
It is a loss to the student body because the profits from the
operation of the Cellar go to the fund which is slowly paying for
ihe Memorial Auditorium. That debt could be reduced several
hundred dollars faster per quarter if "walkouts," the technical
term for non-check-payers, became a vanishing race.
When a Cellar patron discovers he has no money after the
hamburger has been consumed, it is better for him to borrow
from a friend than to leave the student body holding the bill. He
may forget to pay the Cellar later, but his friends will undoubt
edly remember to collect on his debt.
Should a solvent friend be lacking, the penniless patron's
next best solution is to tell the cashier of his plight. While the
Cellar does not ordinarily extend credit, it prefers to be informed
if someone grants it to himself.
A rigid checking system of all who enter and leave the Cellar
:ts neither desirable nor possible, for it is as much a social room
as a food dispensary. Students need not organize themselves into
unofficial OGPU or Gestapo agents, but they can remind the for
getful what the cashier is there for.
While Stanford's Honor Code is not at stake here, it is a test
of personal integrity we should not want to flunk.—Peggy Boothe

There is now a shortage of all kinds of bottles. If there are
any empty bottles around any living group some one in that
group should see that they are returned. The group will gain
a 2 cent deposit on each bottle, and the act of returning the
bottle will permit the manufacturer to use it again.—Lucile
Thompson.
