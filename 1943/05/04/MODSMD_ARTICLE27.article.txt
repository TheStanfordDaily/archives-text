The exceptional success of Alice Ehler's harpsichord concert
at Stanford two years ago made her appearance on the Tuesday
Series a foregone conclusion, if bringing her back were possible.
Madame Ehlers is an Austrian, and immigration technicali
ties made her reappearance impracticable till tonight. They
nearly wrecked the recital two years ago, when the day before
the concert she discovered she must go back to Tijuana and re
enter the country on a quota.
At Tijuana, an endless line made it evident Madame Ehlers
would never get through on time . . . when an influential Stan
ford alumnus (Stanford alumni are always influential) came to
her rescue and soon had her on a plane at San Diego.
But that night, word came from the airlines that stormy
weather was delaying all schedules; and to cap it all, the plane
landed at Oakland instead of Mills Field.
Dr. Warren D. Allen was shortly obliged to appear on stage
as scheduled for the introduction. The airlines rushed Madame
Ehlers by special car to San Mateo, where Miss Worswick and
Professor Robinson had driven to meet her.
After a while, Dr. Allen broke the news upon an incredulous
audience that Madame Ehlers had not arrived; and he proceeded
to deliver one of the most marvelous and hilarious extempo
raneous lectures you ever heard, till she did arrive.
And she was found to have been well worth waiting for.

In this age of ultra amplification, wherein even the loudest
swing bands insist upon public address systems, the faint plink
ing of a harpsichord is indeed a strange sound. And it is a fact
that the clavichord, the harpsichord's cousin instrument, cannot
even be heard by a modern musician from the other end of a
iairly quiet room.
But Madame Ehlers' harpsichord can be heard from any
point in Memorial Hall, and though it is rather difficult to imagine
that auditorium as a 17th century drawing room, listeners will
nevertheless be authentically introduced to the Baroque atmos
phere of Lully and Bach.
