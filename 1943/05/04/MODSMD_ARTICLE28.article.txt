# 'Porgy' Has Vivid Music, Great Story
## 
### 
No one who is part of the audience
of the American theater can miss
the light opera "Porgy and Bess" at
the Curran until May 8. There is
nothing more typically American,
and it is gratifying that what is so
typically ours can be so beautiful.
Part of the force of this piece is
due to the music of the incompar
able George Gershwin. Its original
ity and appeal are given great ad
vantage in the love story that might
be one of the greatest ever told on
the American stage.
The Gershwin music, conducted by
Alexander Smallens, is set to the
play "Porgy" by Dubose and Doro
thy Heyward. Their knowledge of
the Negro section of the South of
which they write is comprehensive
and complete.
Todd Duncan is a restrained, sym
pathetic Porgy. His duet with Etta
Motten, Bess, "Bess, You Is My
Woman Now," is topped only by the
singing of the Eva Jessye Choir in
the wake scene over a slain Negro
husband who visited one too many
boisterous crap games. The music
never falls from a lilting, stirring
mood.
The all-Negro cast supports many
exceptional performances. Besides
the excellent work of the stars,
Warren Coleman, as Crown the mur
dered ex-lover of Bess, and "'Sport
in' Life," done by Avon Long,
garbed alternately in' a lavender suit
with a green vest and a green suit
with a yellow vest, contribute to the
impact of the drama.
"Porgy and Bess" can be called
obvious or subtle, comic or tragic,
colorful or gripping, but only good.
â€”Giannini
