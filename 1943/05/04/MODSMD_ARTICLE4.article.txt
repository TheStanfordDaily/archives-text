### 
Tomorrow night about 7 the
carillon will be playing as contestants
and audience walk to the Frost Am
phitheater for the annual Spring
Sing Fest at 7:15 to hear 25 a cap
pella choruses compete for three
trophies. The sing will be mas
tered by Doc Colyear, will start with
the singing of the Star Spangled
Banner, and will be climaxed by the
contest for the graduate trophy by
the Second, Third, and Fourth-Year
Med Schools.
'"The program is long, but if ev
eryone gets there by 7:15, it will
end before dark," said Miriam King,
head of Cardinals, which is spon
soring the Sing.
Roos Brothers is donating the grad
cup, Waters and Ross is giving the
women's trophy, and the Fijis are
awarding the Stan Vandenburgh
trophy to the best men's chorus. Last
spring, before a crowd of 2,000. the
first-year Med School took the grad
cup, the Chi Psi's the men's trophy,
and Casa Granada was awarded the
women's cup after close competition
from the D.G.'s and Casa Naranja.
Actually there are only 23 com
peting groups, 4 men's choruses, 16
women's groups, and the three Med
Schools, but the STAR unit and
Ram's Head will sing on a non-com
petitive basis.
With the help of the audience's
apptause, Dr. Warren D. Allen, Dr.
Max Savelle, and Dr. Herbert Jan
Popper will act as judges, basing
their decisions on type of selection,
arrangement, appearance of the
group, and tonal quality.
Cardinals are asking the audience
to gather close to the platform, and
are requesting that women's groups
wear flat-heeled shoes.
