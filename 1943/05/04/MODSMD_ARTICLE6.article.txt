# Yanks Capture Mateur, Bizerte Defense key

### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, North Africa, May 3 (UP) — American
forces today captured Mateur, key to the whole Axis Bizerte-Tunis de
fense system in a 15-mile breakthrough which crumbled the enemy
mountain line.
This spectacular thrust severed the only Axis rail link between Tunis

♦■and Bizerte and drove the Germans
to the rim of the inner bastions of
the two ports where they must make
a last stand with their backs to the
sea.
An official spokesman announced
that after heavy fighting and con
stant pressure during the last few
days "American troops forced the
enemy to withdraw from a consider
able area and occupied Mateur this
morning."
Latest field dispatches said the
Americans swept on from Mateur
across the plain to the south and
east, capturing one point eight miles
south of the village, as the Germans
made a general withdrawal all along
the southern sector of the American
front.
The implications of the German
withdrawal were tremendous, the
reports said. Strained beyond the
breaking point in the northern
mountain sector the enemy appar
ently had pulled back into the hill.-
j southeast of Mateur and to the inne:
perimeter defenses of Bizerte.
The Americans' most importan-
I triumph of the African war pu:
them in a valley running 31 mile
| southeast to Tunis with only a single
| range of hills between them and the
i capital, and in a position to outflank
i the Germans' mountain position in
; the Medjerda valley to the south.
