# Farm Smothers St. Mary's in Double-Header
## Win by Scores Of 13-9; 18-4 
### BILL ALLEN 
Scoring a total of 31 runs and 33
'hits, Stanford's phenomenal baseball
team smothered the St. Mary's nine
by scores of 13-9 and 18-4 yesterday
on the Sunken Diamond. The game
featured everything from airtight
pitching to the same man stealing
home twice in the same inning.
It. was a great day for the Stan
ford fans, for they at last saw their
boys come out of the lethargy that
has dogged their footsteps all year
and knock the ball all over the lot.
They also saw what was undoubtedly
the most amazing ball game over
played on the Stanford field. There
were numerous stolen bases and
costly errors.
Steals Bases
Perhaps the most amazing play of
all came in the Cards' big inning, the
last of the fifth, in the second game.
Fifteen men came to the plate and
the Reds scored 13 runs off Marv
Kranda before he was replaced.
During this deluge of runs and hits,

Howie Dallmar, Card first sacker,
stole home twice. It is believed that
this is a record for base stealing in
one inning by the same player.
The game got underway with what
looked like a trouncing for the
Farm lads when the Gaels collected
three runs off Doc Mason in the first
inning; that was the last time in the
opening encounter that the men from
Moraga were out in front, for in the
second inning, the Woltermen came
from behind to Score four runs and
were never headed from there in.
They completely blasted the Gael
starting pitcher, Jack Stout, from the
mound in the third inning when
they collected five hits and six runs.
Second "Game
History repeated itself in the sec
ond game as the Gaels got away to
a flying start, collecting three runs
off the hurling of made-over out
fielder, Dick Flatland. Things looked
bad for a while as Marv Kranda,
left-hander from Moraga had the In
dians "right where he wanted them.
Then it happened. In their half of
the third frame the Cards were able
to garner two runs and close the gap.
In the last half of the fifth, Eill
Cunha led off, and until he had bat
ted twice and so had most of the
rest of the team, the Big Red squad
was not retired. Thirteen runs cros
sed the plate by various means and
two St. Mary's hurlers rode the
storm on the hill. It was really a
storm, Anything that came within
six feet of the plate was knocked
out for a hit. That was almost the
final story, since Flatland held the
Gaels to but one mor run and the
Cards were able to score only three
more.
Dugout Chatter
The Red batters looked very im
pressive at the plate with McKie,
Brown and Dallmar smacking out
triples . . . Both Walkup and Brown
scored home runs although they
were not credited with the same as
they came on outfield errors . . .
Coach Harry Wolter was so im
pressed by his men's showing in the
first game that he took a chance with
Flatland on the mound ... lie was
surprised as was the rest of the
crowd that attended the game, to see
him turn in a beautiful performance
scattering his 10 hits very capably
. . . Maybe he is the solution to
Harry's pitching problem.

Perhaps the most amazing play of
all came in the Cards' big inning, the
last of the fifth, in the second game.
Fifteen men came to the plate and
the Reds scored 13 runs off Marv
Kranda before he was replaced.
During this deluge of runs and hits,

Howie Dallmar, Card first sacker,
stole home twice. It is believed that
this is a record for base stealing in
one inning by the same player.
The game got underway with what
looked like a trouncing for the
Farm lads when the Gaels collected
three runs off Doc Mason in the first
inning; that was the last time in the
opening encounter that the men from
Moraga were out in front, for in the
second inning, the Woltermen came
from behind to Score four runs and
were never headed from there in.
They completely blasted the Gael
starting pitcher, Jack Stout, from the
mound in the third inning when
they collected five hits and six runs.
Second "Game
History repeated itself in the sec
ond game as the Gaels got away to
a flying start, collecting three runs
off the hurling of made-over out
fielder, Dick Flatland. Things looked
bad for a while as Marv Kranda,
left-hander from Moraga had the In
dians "right where he wanted them.
Then it happened. In their half of
the third frame the Cards were able
to garner two runs and close the gap.
In the last half of the fifth, Eill
Cunha led off, and until he had bat
ted twice and so had most of the
rest of the team, the Big Red squad
was not retired. Thirteen runs cros
sed the plate by various means and
two St. Mary's hurlers rode the
storm on the hill. It was really a
storm, Anything that came within
six feet of the plate was knocked
out for a hit. That was almost the
final story, since Flatland held the
Gaels to but one mor run and the
Cards were able to score only three
more.

The Red batters looked very im
pressive at the plate with McKie,
Brown and Dallmar smacking out
triples . . . Both Walkup and Brown
scored home runs although they
were not credited with the same as
they came on outfield errors . . .
Coach Harry Wolter was so im
pressed by his men's showing in the
first game that he took a chance with
Flatland on the mound ... lie was
surprised as was the rest of the
crowd that attended the game, to see
him turn in a beautiful performance
scattering his 10 hits very capably
. . . Maybe he is the solution to
Harry's pitching problem.
