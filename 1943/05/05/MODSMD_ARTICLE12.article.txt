## Varsity Crew Meets Bears Saturday on Oakland Estuary 
### 
It will bo the California varsity against the Stanford varsity this Satur
day evening at 5 p.m. on the Oakland Estuary. During the Fall Quarter
The Indian crew raced a California shell which Cal Coach Ky Ebright
rated at that time as almost as good as his usual spring varsity squads,
but this will be the first time the Cards have raced Cal's official first string.

Ebright watched Carl Pedersen"
put his gang through a workout on
the Oakland course last week, and
decided that he would have to put
his varsity against the Indians to
make it a race.
The Stanford J.V. crew will race
against the Bear juniors, and the
frosh eights of the two schools will
probably meet each other also.
According to reports, the varsity
crew which Pederson will send
against the Bears is a much better
one than the eight which raced
U.C.L.A. two weeks ago. The Indians
have been working to get more
power in each stroke, and thus.get
ting more distance per pull. The
stroke count is therefore lower, but
the speed is greater.
