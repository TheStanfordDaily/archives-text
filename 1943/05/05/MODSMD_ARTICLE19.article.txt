### Cheri Martin 
Arousing national attention and
no end of local worry is the Hu
manities Conference to be held at
Stanford this Friday and Saturday.
The conference, to be covered by
the Associated Press, New York
Times, and Time Magazine, is the
first annual conference on the hu
manities, according to J. Roy Peter
sen of the Associates Office, and its
theme will be "The Humanities in
the War and the Post-War World."
The humanities have entered into
the planning of the conference, ac
cording to F. W. Strothmann, chair
man of the conference committee,
who is trying to arrange the accom
modations and eating arrangements
for the delegates.
"In view of the difficulties of
transportation, the positive replies to
the invitations were very surpris
ing,'' Professor Strothmann said. "In
the last few days, we have had to
wire people not to come because
their replies came too late to secure
reservations."
Over 170 delegates are coming
from the western area, and repre
sentatives are from Washington,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado.
New Mexico, and Arizona, and even

from as far as Mexico, although the*
majority are from California.
Delegates will be staying at the
President Hotel, Castilleja School,
private homes in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, and some will even re
side at the Family Club near Wood
side. -Professor Strothmann ex
plained that the Family Club is
merely a redwood grove where the
men will sleep on the ground in
sleeping bags and they will cook
their own breakfasts.
A caravan service has been set up
between the Woodside location and
the Menlo Park area to transport
the delegates to and from the cam
pus.
"The current food situation and its
resultant eating problem also had
to be dealt with," Professor Stroth
mann continued. Arrangements have
been made for the delegates to eat
in the Union dining room Friday
noon and Friday evening, and con
sequently the dining room will be
closed to the public on that day.
Saturday, convention members
will take box lunches to the Frost
Amphitheater for lunch. The La
gunita dining room will be the scene
of the convention banquet Saturday
night.

Delegates will be staying at the
President Hotel, Castilleja School,
private homes in Palo Alto and
Menlo Park, and some will even re
side at the Family Club near Wood
side. -Professor Strothmann ex
plained that the Family Club is
merely a redwood grove where the
men will sleep on the ground in
sleeping bags and they will cook
their own breakfasts.
A caravan service has been set up
between the Woodside location and
the Menlo Park area to transport
the delegates to and from the cam
pus.
"The current food situation and its
resultant eating problem also had
to be dealt with," Professor Stroth
mann continued. Arrangements have
been made for the delegates to eat
in the Union dining room Friday
noon and Friday evening, and con
sequently the dining room will be
closed to the public on that day.
Saturday, convention members
will take box lunches to the Frost
Amphitheater for lunch. The La
gunita dining room will be the scene
of the convention banquet Saturday
night.
Arousing national attention and
no end of local worry is the Hu
manities Conference to be held at
Stanford this Friday and Saturday.
The conference, to be covered by
the Associated Press, New York
Times, and Time Magazine, is the
first annual conference on the hu
manities, according to J. Roy Peter
sen of the Associates Office, and its
theme will be "The Humanities in
the War and the Post-War World."
The humanities have entered into
the planning of the conference, ac
cording to F. W. Strothmann, chair
man of the conference committee,
who is trying to arrange the accom
modations and eating arrangements
for the delegates.
"In view of the difficulties of
transportation, the positive replies to
the invitations were very surpris
ing,'' Professor Strothmann said. "In
the last few days, we have had to
wire people not to come because
their replies came too late to secure
reservations."
Over 170 delegates are coming
from the western area, and repre
sentatives are from Washington,
Montana, Wyoming, Utah, Colorado.
New Mexico, and Arizona, and even

from as far as Mexico, although the*
majority are from California.
