# SIGNAL CORPS
## Nearly 400 Members Trained In Ultra-High-Frequency Radio 
### 
Since the first men of the Army Signal Corps arrived on the Stanford
campus a year ago for advanced radio studies, nearly 400 have completed
training in ultra-high-frequency radio. Dr. Hugh H. Skilling, head of the
electrical engineering department, said today.
Because Stanford has pioneered in research on ultra-high-frequency,

in the development of
the Klystron, a device for producing
ultra-short radio waves, the facili
ties of the University were immedi
; ately made available to the armed
forces after the war began. In addi
tion to enlisted men, the University
has also trained Army and Navy of
ficers in the highly technical radio
work.
For its contribution to the war
training program of the Signal
Corps, the University has received
l a letter of commendation from Cap
lain E. M. Rickard, officer in charge
of the Signal Corps training program
I in the Ninth Service Command.
"During the past year, Stanford
University has made its facilities
available to such an extent that it
has become one of the outstanding
centers for this advanced level of
training" Captain Rickard wrote
Dr. Skilling.
"The preparation Signal Corps
men receive at Stanford University
cannot be over-estimated . . ."
At the present time, Stanford is
training more than 100 men, and
graduating nearly 25 every two
weeks.
