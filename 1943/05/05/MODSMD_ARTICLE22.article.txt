"It will be the major catastrophe
jf this age if the Reciprocal Trade
Treaty is allowed to lapse," pro
phesized Professor Theodore H.
Boggs of the department of eco
nomics, speaking yesterday after
noon in the "Y" rooms on "Post-
War Economics."
The meeting was the fourth in a
series given this quarter under the
auspices of the World Affairs group
of the Y.W.C.A. on post-war plan
ning.
Stressing the importance of the
Reciprocal Trade Treaty in restor
ing world economic equilibrium
ifter the war, Dr. Boggs reviewed
the recent history of international
trade.
As a result of the high tariff policy,
trade fell off until by 1934 a mere
trickle of international trade ran
through the United States. Cordell
Hull devised the treaty, saying that
if we didn't clear the trade channels,
we ourselves would be the chief vic
tims.
The treaty, formulated in 1934, re
versed the trend of higher tariffs. It
was planned to last for three years.
In 1937 it was renewed, and in 1940
it was renewed again. In June of
this year it will come up to Congress
for its third renewal.
"This act was important as a ges
ture," Dr. Boggs stated. "It showed
other nations that the United States
was motivated by a new spirit of fair
play. If Congress should refuse to
renew this act, other countries would
take this as an indication of the
United States' post-war plans."
Asked what hope there was of the
treaty's renewal, Dr. Boggs said that
more and more producers and manu
facturers are realizing that the tariff
is injuring them. "And," he con
tinued, "an overwhelming evidence
shows that the Reciprocal Trade
Treaty has had a genuine influence
in lowering the tariff."
Concluding his lecture. Dr. Boggs
put forth the idea of a world bank
to which all the strong nations would
contribute. This bank would aid in
such projects as rebuilding China.
The fifth lecture on post-war
planning will be held next Tuesday
at 4:15 in the "Y" rooms. Dr. Fred
eric Spiegelbei'g of the School of
Humanities will speak.

The meeting was the fourth in a
series given this quarter under the
auspices of the World Affairs group
of the Y.W.C.A. on post-war plan
ning.
Stressing the importance of the
Reciprocal Trade Treaty in restor
ing world economic equilibrium
ifter the war, Dr. Boggs reviewed
the recent history of international
trade.
As a result of the high tariff policy,
trade fell off until by 1934 a mere
trickle of international trade ran
through the United States. Cordell
Hull devised the treaty, saying that
if we didn't clear the trade channels,
we ourselves would be the chief vic
tims.
The treaty, formulated in 1934, re
versed the trend of higher tariffs. It
was planned to last for three years.
In 1937 it was renewed, and in 1940
it was renewed again. In June of
this year it will come up to Congress
for its third renewal.
"This act was important as a ges
ture," Dr. Boggs stated. "It showed
other nations that the United States
was motivated by a new spirit of fair
play. If Congress should refuse to
renew this act, other countries would
take this as an indication of the
United States' post-war plans."
Asked what hope there was of the
treaty's renewal, Dr. Boggs said that
more and more producers and manu
facturers are realizing that the tariff
is injuring them. "And," he con
tinued, "an overwhelming evidence
shows that the Reciprocal Trade
Treaty has had a genuine influence
in lowering the tariff."
Concluding his lecture. Dr. Boggs
put forth the idea of a world bank
to which all the strong nations would
contribute. This bank would aid in
such projects as rebuilding China.
The fifth lecture on post-war
planning will be held next Tuesday
at 4:15 in the "Y" rooms. Dr. Fred
eric Spiegelbei'g of the School of
Humanities will speak.
