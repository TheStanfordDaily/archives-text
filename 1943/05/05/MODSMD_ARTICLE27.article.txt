# Ranch Rumpus Set for Friday
## 
### 
Because the first Ranch Rumpus
I was such a success, the W.A.A. plans
j to sponsor another one Friday night
| from 8 until 11:30 in the Pavilion.
It will be a no-date affair, for
j which ranch clothes will be in
i vogue. A square dancing group will
| direct dances, and there will be so
j cial dancingâ€”for relaxation.
The Army men on campus have
been invited to attend.
There will be hostesses to see that
everyone has a good time, and re
' freshments will be served.
There will be an admission charge
of 10 cents.
