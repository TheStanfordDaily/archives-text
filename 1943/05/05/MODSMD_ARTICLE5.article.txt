## 
### Adolph Gugel 
Alice Ehlers, world renowned harpsichordist, repeated her brilliant suc
cess of two years ago when she appeared with the Stanford orchestra last
night in Memorial Hall on the Tuesday Evening Series program.
Madame Ehlers first played in Bach's Fifth Brandenburg Concerto, pre
senting a remarkable display of technique in the opening Allegro of that

'work. Willard J. Floshman played
the flute part in the concerto while
Conductor Ferenc Molnar played
the violin part.
Following the Bach Concerto, Ma
dame Ehlers spoke briefly about the
harpsichord, explaining that it was
an instrument entirely independent
of the piano with individual char
acteristics of its own. She then
played four 18th century dances as
solos, commenting briefly on each
one, and the program closed with
the Haydn Concerto lor Harpsichord
in D major. The Stanford orchestra
opened the concerto with the Al
legro from a Vivaldi Concerto Gros
so for String Orchestra.
After the concert Madame Ehlers
remarked that she had played with
many orchestras and that she found
the Stanford Orchestra the best col
lege group she had ever played with.
She praised Ferenc Molnar, saying
that his remarkable knowledge of
string instruments was greatly re
sponsible for the high standard of
the Stanford Orchestra.
Alice Ehlers is a native of Austria
and has performed all over the
world except in the Orient. Since
her arrival in the United States she
has performed with a number of
major orchestras as well as at
numerous college campuses.
Betty Moser Breed, Stanford grad
uate, was concert master of the or
chestra and Ted Mihran acted as
concert master during the Haydn
Concerto.
Mr. Molnar stated that in each of
the works on the program he tried
to keep the number ot performers as
close as possible to the number that
the work was originally written for.
The Stanford Orchestra is made up
of students, graduates, and alumni
of the University.
