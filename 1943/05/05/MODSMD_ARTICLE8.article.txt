## Spring Show Bills Olio Acts 
### 
"Twenty Big Olio Acts, Twenty!"
So runs the advertisement for
Stanford's traditional Spring Show,
playing in Memorial Auditorium
May 14 and 15. And, according to
Director Gordon Gibb, this state
ment is far from wrong.
Twenty olio acts will supplement
' the main attraction, a terrific .melo
| drama of the Gay Nineties, "No
.Mother to Guide Her," the director
said.
Themes of the olios range from a
| can-can dance to soulful renditions
of old-fashioned popular songs.
Members of the cast are so en
thused by their work that "we only
! work about half the rehearsal time
and spend the rest laughing at our
selves," Gibb remarked.
One of the featured olios is a
number called "Awfully Clever" in
which a male chorus, complete with
derbies, dance and sing, twirling
| their canes.
"Kissing on the Sly" is another
number which Gibb is sure will be
a hit. At least, i f , has proved a hit
with the cast, for competition to take
part was tremendous, he said. Jack
Coy sings, while three couples pro
vide the action behind umbrellas.
The couples are Janice Shaughnessy
and Russ Bryan, Jackie Armstrong
and Ken Jones, Florence Rollins and
Perry Holmes.
A male sextette, which will take
part in the Spring Sing also, sings
"Don't Beat Your Mother Boys, It's
.Mean," 1 and "She's More to Be
Pitied Than Censored."
Members of the sextette are Herb
Cabral, Ward Cummings, Bob Kin
singer, Bud Semrau, Jim Block, and
Owen Walker.
Eight girls will take part in a can
| can dance. Extra special costumes
are being made for this, according to
Paula Kanner, in charge of costum
ing, The girl chorus will do another
number, "If Your Foot Is Pretty,
Show It."
A surprise for everyone is prom
ised by Gibb when Jane Spalding
does her special arrangement of a
strip-tease called "Brunhilda of the
I Burlesque."
Nan Tillson's voice does justice to
an old favorite. "Don't Go in the
Lion's Cage Tonight," according to
the director. She will also sing
"Oceana Roll."
The annual Spring Show is pro
duced by Rani's Head, campus hon
j orary dramatic society.
