# Roble, Fijis, Third-Fourth Year Meds Win in Sing
## 
### Irma Cunha 
Against a background of flowering trees and red roses, Roble sang "Night
and Day" to win the women's Spring Sing Fest award, the Fijis did a
novelty number entitled "Behind the Swinging Doors" to win the men's
contest, and the third and fourth year Med Schools were awarded the
grad trophy with "The Whiffenpoof Song."
This year as last, the women's competition was keen, and with the help

of the applause of about 750 onlook-'
ers, the judges chose Ventura, Kap
pa, and Granada as worthy of hon
orable mention out of a group of 15
women's choruses.
The Fijis were without question
the most novel chorus entered. The
entire house formed behind five
"bartenders," complete in outfit, and
gave out on each chorus after these
"bartenders" had emotionally given
out on the verse.
When the Med School walked on
to the platform in their white out
fits, there was a burst of applause,
silence, and then a burst of oh's,
ah's, and more applause when Mas
ter of Ceremonies Doc Colyear an
nounced their selection. Their song
was excellent, but the most out
standing thing about them was their
young mascot, blond little Dickie,
who, with very much poise in hLs
white doctor's coat, toddled along
with the chorus.
Roble Rose Leis
The Roble chorus dressed as they
did last yearâ€”all white with red
rose leis adding the final touch.
They were the largest chorus to sing
last night, and when the judges' de
cision was announced, all the audi
ence could see in the dusk were
white figures running toward the
platform to receive their cup.
Dr. Warren D. Allen presented the
cups, donated by Roos Brothers,
Waters and Ross, and the Fijis in
honor of Stan Vandenbrugh.
"I've judged many sings, but I
don't think I've ever had to stick
my neck out quite so far," he said.
Aiding Dr. Allen with the judging
were Dr. Max Savelle and Dr. Her
bert Jan Popper.
Four Men's Groups
There were only four men's groups
entered in competition as compared
with seven last year, when the Chi
Psi's took the trophy.
The Kappas did their own ar
rangement of "Maisie." Ventura,
with an original arrangement of
"Early in the Morning," managed to
get in their say about lockouts. Gra
nada gave a smooth rendition of
"Summertime."
The STAR unit, Company A, gave
the finale in a spirit that made the
entire audience applaud and join in
the singing. Complete with drum
mer and a marching arrangement
that wound up in a "V" formation,
they began their singing with "D'e
Ken John Peal?" and snappily broke
into "The Caissons Go Rolling
Along," "The Marine Hymn," "An
chors Aweigh," "The Army Air
Corps Song,"" and a grand finale with
the audience of "Come Join the
Band."
Then, just after the sun had gone
down, everyone joined in the sing
ing of the Stanford Hymn and filed
out of the Amphitheater.
