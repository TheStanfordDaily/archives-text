## 
### Cheri Martin 
More than 170 representatives from colleges and universities throughout
the West will attend the first annual conference of the humanities here at
Stanford University, Dr. John W. Dodds, dean of the Stanford School of
Humanities, announced yesterday after tabulating acceptances.
The conference, to be held this Friday and Saturday, will have for its

general theme "The Humanities in - *
the War and Post-War World." Un
der a grant to Stanford nearly a year
ago, the Rockefeller Roundation spe
cifically set aside a fund to establish
the annual conferences of the hu
manities.
Dean Dodds said the purpose of
the conference is to bring together
Western educators to help them fur
ther the work of the humanities in
their own institutions.

' We realize that there is a war to
be won and that academic confer
ences of a merely routine character
are not advisable at present," Dr.
Dodds said, this is not to be a
routine conference. We believe that
precisely because there is a war and
a peace to be won, the humanities
can no longer stand aside, but must
fulfill the mission which is theirs."
Among the leading presentations
will be a talk by David H. Stevens,
director of the humanities of the
Rockefeller Foundation, on the
Foundation's humanities program.
Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina and one of the
principal speakers, is unable to at
tend but his speech, "Responsibili
ties of the Humanistic Education To
day," will be read by Dean Dodds;
G. A. Borgese of the University of
Chicago will speak Friday evening
on "Humanism, an Old Challenge in
a New World"; and Lewis Mumford
of Stanford is to present the final
talk Saturday evening on "Ideologi
cal Reorientation."
All sessions of the conference are
to be held in the Education Audi
torium and are open to STARS, stu
dents, and the general public.

A late spark means overheating
and many motorists allow the spark
to fall too far behind, according to
L. G. Evans, general .service man
ager of the National Automobile
Club, The damage li om delayed
timing may be serious. It should
be part of the motorist's routine to
have the timing checked periodi
ca!! v.

Lagunita girls are leaving their
dining hall and their Saturday
night dinner to make possible a
banquet for the delegates to the
Humanities Conference. "Because
of the lack of space elsewhere and
our inability to obtain the food for
such an affair, the Lagunita girls
volunteered to leave their dining
room for our use." said Dean John
W. Dodds of the School of Hu
manities. "Their generosity in this
situation is commendable," he said.

the West will attend the first annual conference of the humanities here at
Stanford University, Dr. John W. Dodds, dean of the Stanford School of
Humanities, announced yesterday after tabulating acceptances.
The conference, to be held this Friday and Saturday, will have for its

general theme "The Humanities in - *
the War and Post-War World." Un
der a grant to Stanford nearly a year
ago, the Rockefeller Roundation spe
cifically set aside a fund to establish
the annual conferences of the hu
manities.
Dean Dodds said the purpose of
the conference is to bring together
Western educators to help them fur
ther the work of the humanities in
their own institutions.

' We realize that there is a war to
be won and that academic confer
ences of a merely routine character
are not advisable at present," Dr.
Dodds said, this is not to be a
routine conference. We believe that
precisely because there is a war and
a peace to be won, the humanities
can no longer stand aside, but must
fulfill the mission which is theirs."
Among the leading presentations
will be a talk by David H. Stevens,
director of the humanities of the
Rockefeller Foundation, on the
Foundation's humanities program.

North Carolina and one of the
principal speakers, is unable to at

ties of the Humanistic Education To

Chicago will speak Friday evening
on "Humanism, an Old Challenge in
a New World"; and Lewis Mumford
of Stanford is to present the final
talk Saturday evening on "Ideologi
cal Reorientation."
All sessions of the conference are
to be held in the Education Audi

have the timing checked periodi

our inability to obtain the food for
such an affair, the Lagunita girls
volunteered to leave their dining
room for our use." said Dean John
W. Dodds of the School of Hu
manities. "Their generosity in this
situation is commendable," he said.
