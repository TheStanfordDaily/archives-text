# Stanford Campus Invaded!
## 
### 

THE MEMBERS of the STAR Units stationed here at Stanford
lounge outside the Encina Commons for a cigarette after lunch.
Although the freshmen have complained about the food for
generations of Stanford men, the Army doesn't think that it's
so bad.

STAR UNIT members don't spend all their time marching.
They have made numerous informal tours of the campus. The
Hoover War Libe in the background has been a source of major
attraction to the Army boys.

THE MOST IMPORTANT part of any Army day is meal time. Above are members of Stan
ford's STAR Unit marching into the Encina Commons for their repast. When the men see the
sign "stop" in the background, they pay little attention, because it is time for "grub." Even
with the additional companies arriving on campus, all the soldiers are fed at the Commons,
and they are seen waiting before the dining rooms near mealtime.



A FAMILIAR SIGHT to students on the Stanford campus are members of the STAR Units
marching to classes in the streets surrounding the Quad. In the picture above, a group of sol
diers march past the Memorial Auditorium, probably on their way to a meal in the Encina
Commons. Students about the Quad are becoming used to hearing the commands, "March,
one, two, three," as the men pass in even columns, swerving only for a double-parked car or
a looming tree.


SEVERAL SQUADS of STAR Unit soldiers stand inspection, then file off to another class, in
front of the engineering buildings. In the background, other buildings of the campus and the
Hoover War Libe provide a setting, which, until a few weeks ago, saw only Stanford roughs
and queens ambling or bicycling between classes. Now, between class atmosphere is filled
with loud commands and the rhythmical beat of marching feet resound through the Quad's
sandstone arches.
