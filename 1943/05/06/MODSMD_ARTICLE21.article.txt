# Dr. Bailey Willis Prophesies Santa Barbara Earthquake
## 
### Alice Jean Little 
"This is the story of a man who
has always done what he wanted,
because he has always wanted to do
what he had to do." According to
Dr. Bailey Willis, professor emeritus
of geology, this is the secret of his
Miccess and longevity.
At eighty-four Dr. Willis is a busy,
alert man with a Santa Claus beard.
He has been described in Time mag
azine as "Owl Face Willis," because
of the grey beard which frames and
hides most of his face, making him
look like a prophet of Biblical days.
Predicts Earthquake
And Dr. Willis is a sort of prophet,
having predicted the 1934 Santa
Barbara earthquake. He says, how
ever, that no one can predict earth
quakes as no one knows the exact
day, hour, and place where they
will occur. He claims that he merely
prophesied the year and the month
in which it would occur. Then he
went down to wait for it so that he
could make geological calculations.
Dr. Willis is a living Stanford tra
dition. He was head of the Stanford
Geology Department from 1915 to
1922. Since 1922 he has traveled all
over the world doing research work
in geology. He is especially inter
sted in the forces that produce
earthquakes, volcanoes, and conti
nental upheavals.
Trip to India
In 1937, Dr. Willis i'nd his wife
spent thirteen months in the Orient,
visiting China, Japan. India, and the
Dutch East Indies. They motored
5.000 miles into the interior of India
accompanied only by Hindu serv
ants. They did not see other white
pec.pie for several months.
At that time Dr. Willis flew over
the Philippines in an Army bombing
plane. When asked which way he
liked to travel best, he beamed with
excited anticipation and said, "In a
plane, of course."
Traveled Extensively
Since 1880, Dr. Willis has spent
one-third of his time camping and
exploring little-known countries. He
has crossed the Atlantic Ocean four
teen times. He has traveled in Ger
many, France, England, Palestine,
New Zealand, Central Africa, and
South America.
He can speak French, German,
Spanish, English, and Chinese. With
the aid of a dictionary he can read
Dutch, Italian, and Russian.
Varied Interests
Dr. Willis is interested in every
thing and everybody and has a
wide-awake air about him. Besides
studying geology, he is interested in
painting, cabinct-inaking, and chil
dren.
He began painting watercolor
prints forty-five years ago, and since
that time he has dohe many, many
prints. His paintings have been ex
hibited twice at the Annual Exhibi
tion of the Washingjpn (D.C.) Wa
tercolor Club.
Landscape Paintings
In his office he has two excellent
landscape paintings, ' rfe painted one
of them two years agd on a blossom
ing loscut tree which he found near
the golf course.
While he was painting this pic
ture, hidden in the bushes, two girls
came to gather some blossoms. He

yelled at them. "Who gave you per
mission to cut this tiee?" They fled
in fright.
Cabinet Work
Dr. Willis started doing cabinet
work six years ago when his wife
wanted something in which to keep
her rare collection of Japanese block
prints.
After that when she wanted fur
niture and couldn't find it in the
stores, she had him make it for
her. His workshop is completely
equipped with the latest machinery.
Now he is making rolled mahogany
tables and chairs when he finds the
time.
Entertains Children
Another one of his hobbies is en
tertaining children. He has always
loved children and entertains them
by transforming a blank piece of
paper into dolls, animals, or any
thing they want. He has played with
children everywhere and he says
that they are all alike, Japanese, Af
rican, or English.
Dr. Willis has four children of his
own, two boys and two girls. The
boys are both geologists. They were
going to enter another profession
until they entered Stanford and took
his course.
At the present time Dr. Willis has
seven grandchildren and one great
grandchild.
Golden Gate Bridge
While Dr. Willis thinks that the
Golden Gate Bridge is a magnificent
engineering monument, he is afraid
that it won't last more than a hun
dred years because one of the piers
is built on unstable rock that will
gradually sink and may split. He
says that it is a common fault among
engineers to expect natural rock to
be as strong as artificial rock.
To keep fit. Dr. Willis exercises in
the Men's Gym once a week. At the
present time he is helping the war
effort by continuing his research in
geology. He is vitally concerned
about the war and says, "There can
be no just peace until there is a
united world government that is
all-encompassing in scope, wiser
than any previous world federation,
and strong enough to enforce its
laws."
Although Dr. Willis is not widely
known by Stanford students at the
present time, he is much interested
in the students and would be glad to
meet more of them.
