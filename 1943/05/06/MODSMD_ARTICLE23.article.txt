# American Red Cross Appeals For Overseas Field Workers
## 
### 
The WAACS and the WAVES
have been appealing to Stanford
women to enlist in their sedvices.
But there is another organizatior
which deserves the attention of the
ambitious co-ed. The American
Red Cross is in need of overseas
workers.
Red Cross employees are sent to
all parts of the world where our
fighting forces are stationed. Young
women direct field work in hospitals
and at Army and Navy bases. Their
job is to keep the soldiers in good
spirits, provide entertainment, and
act as a counselor for any troubles
which might confront them.
Workers in hospitals teach hand
craft to wounded soldiers, read to
them and write letters to their fam
ilies. One young girl stationed in a
New Guinea hospital has already re
ceived 14 proposals of marriage.
Clubmobile Units
Another activity of overseas wom
en Red Cross workers is the Club
mobile unit. This unit is a "canteen
on wheels" in which large Red Cross
cars, fully equipped with food, mo
tion picture projectors, and phono
graph records, are driven by at
tractive Red Cross girls to various
Army outposts to provide a bit of
cheer for the lonely soldiers.
Stanford girls are urged to look
int othis field of service. They must
first file applications which can be
obtained at any Red Cross chapter,
after which they are personally in
terviewed. They should be willing

to accept service in any part of the
United States or abroad. They
should be willing to accept service
in any part of the United States or
abroad. They should be physically
fit and willing to take the hardships
and the dangers of an overseas
assignment.
