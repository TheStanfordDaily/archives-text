Those of you football fans who
have the honor of being able to read
the San Francisco News may have
noticed a large item run in the Sports
page quoting A1 Masters as saying
that Stanford would not field a foot
ball team next year. The article also
stated that tSanford had been in dis
favor of the recently proposed foot
ball schedule.
The real facts of the case are that
Stanford does intend to field a team
next fall, conditions permitting. We
have not just thrown in the towel
c;iid forgotten the whole idea. If
perhaps the Ar m y regulations
should be changed and allow their
cadets at the various universities to
compete in intercollegiate games,
then there is little doubt that the
Card eleven will be on the gridiron
come next October.

This coming weekend is that date
.<et for one of the most exciting
events of the current intercollegiate
baseball season. On Friday after
noon the California Bears, Northern
Division winners, and the Trojans
from Southern California will tangle
in the first game of a three game
series to determine the state cham
pion. oßth these teams are excellent
ball clubs, beating everything that
has come their way in league compe
tition.
The series promises to be a close
(.ne and anything can happen, but
from the records the Trojans look
like the winner. The Bears, though
strong, seem to lack that little bit of
polish that wins the close ones.
Coach Harry Wolter finally proved
of the Stanford spoils fans that he
has a winning ball club after better
than half the season was over.
