# Excom Considers Summer Pre-Reg
## 
### 
| Discussing plans for a pre-reg
program this summer, Excom met
j yesterday afternoon in a short ses
j sion. Because of the Spring Sing,
â–  the meeting was not held at the
I regular time.
! Since the new students will have
I only one day before classes begin,
| any pre-reg program will have to be
i limited. A campus tour, a special
i service in the Chapel. Honor Code
( discussions, an exchange dinner and
; jolly-up have been suggested for
! their first week-end at Stanford. A
| pre-reg chairman will be appointed
! later by Excom.
Publications Council minutes were
i ,
approved.
