# Victorious Baseballers Point Toward Don Games Saturday
## 
### 
After tasting sweet revenge last
Tuesday, Stanford's baseball nine
will attempt a repeat performance
this coming Saturday when they
engage the U.S.F. Dons in a double
header here. The games will start
at 1:30 p.m. on the Sunken Diamond.
This will be the second and third
times that these two teams have
played this year, the Dons emerging
victorious from the first tilt, 4-0.
That is not likely to happen again,
however, since the Reds have come
a long way since they took that iirst
shellacking. They showed that in
clouting the ball all over the lot the
other afternoon.
Furthermore, we will be playing
on our home grounds under more
favorable conditions than were ex
perienced at Seals Stadium, the

scene of the fir; t encounter. The
park was so windy and dismal that
even an Eskimo would have hesi
tated before attempting to play ball
there.
The same two hurlers should face
each other as did before. That is,
Doc Mason and Con Dempsey.
Dempsey did a fine job the last time,
but Mason was suffering from his
back ailment, since mended, and he
should look impressive against the
Dons who are not exactly a model
of the New York Yankees at bat.
Dempsey, however, may be ex
pecting trouble instead of an easy
time, for he will soon learn that the
Card bats are silent no longer.
Look for a big Stanford victory
and don't be too surprised if the
score mounts into two figures again.
