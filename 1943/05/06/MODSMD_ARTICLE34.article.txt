# MONDAY TWILIGHT GAMES?
## 
### 
Intramural Softball teams take to
the diamonds again today after tak
ing a lay-oft Wednesday. It is
urged that all umpires officiating at
the games contact the managers
of the two teams that are playing,
and find out if they are in favor of
Monday or Wednesday twilight
games, and on Saturdays, morning,
afternoon, or twilight games.
The results of these questions
should be turned in to Harry Wolter
as soon as possible.
