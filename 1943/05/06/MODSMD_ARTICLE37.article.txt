# Spring Singing
## 
### 
ABOUT 750 persons were in the amphitheater
last night to sing.
The sun was just setting behind the foothills,
and an evening wind lifted a few blossoms and
rippled the Stanford banner on the lawn.
The assembled multitude rose and sang the
Star Spangled Banner. Then groups of 25, more
Dr less, filed onto the platform, and delivered
their songs.
To many of the people present, it was another
Spring Sing. They clapped and laughed and
enjoyed themselves, sitting on the green.
To others, perhaps, the singing had a differ
ent meaning: the soldiers who sang marching
songs, the fraternity which dedicated its selec
tion to two brothers lost in action, the women's
groups which expressed themselves with remi
niscent songs of the last war.
Perhaps the voices of these people followed
their thoughts far from the amphitheater. And
perhaps singing there, in the quickening twi
light, stirred them more than was apparent to
the people who clapped and laughed and en
joyed themselves on the green.â€”Jane Glasson
