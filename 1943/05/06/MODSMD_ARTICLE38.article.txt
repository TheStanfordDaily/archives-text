# Treat Them Well
## 
### 
SINCE the Japanese were moved out of the
coastal areas not much has been heard
about them. The way we should treat them was
flashed into the minds of many people when it
was announced that the captured flyers of the
Tokyo raid had been executed.
The Klamath Herald and News recently an
nounced that the Tulelake center for-the Japa
nese had cost 56,975,419. Rep. Lowell Stock
man, who informed the paper about the reloca
tion center, also said that the current cost of
operation is 5457.33 per man year and that
the center is designed to take care of 10,818
man years.
In a way this is not very much to spend to
support a man for a whole year, but then, too,
it is a lot different from the execution of Ameri
can prisoners of war.
We believe that almost nothing is too good
for the Japanese in this country. Many of them
are loyal American citizens with an earnest
desire to help the United States win the war.
Others are of Japanese sympathy, but whether
they are for us or against us we should treat
them well.
If we do give them the best, there is less
chance that American prisoners will be mis
treated, and, too, after the war is over there will
be fewer scars to heal and memories to forget.
