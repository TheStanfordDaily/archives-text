# On Strikes
## 
### 
YESTERDAY the Senate passed the Connally
bill which would empower the government
to seize and operate struck war plants and
mines and impose criminal penalties for insti
gating work stoppages in industries so taken
over.
The action of the Senate in this matter is
certainly indicative of the American feeling
toward the recent soft coal trouble that John L.
Lewis has caused. Although this bill may have
no bearing on the present trouble in the bitumi
nous mines, it will be a sure preventative
against any future strikes that might harm the
war effort.
However, such bills that give the govern

ment seemingly uncontrolled power, set forth
in loose terms, are very dangerous. Mob rule
is dangerous and especially so in time of war.
The liberty and protection of minorities that
is ours should be carefully protected.
