### CYCLONE COVEY 
The phenomenal Artur Rubinstein expends
more nervous energy when he performs in re
cital than most any virtuoso you ever saw.
When he crescendos to a climax too big to
negotiate sitting down, he will rise from the
bench and with all his might descend upon the
keyboard.
It is characteristic of his concerto playing,
that, when the orchestra takes a passage alone
while the piano rests, Rubinstein does anything
but rest. Scarce containable, he puts as much
into the music as when he is actually playing.
When he appears from the wings to the au
dience's applause, does he stride auspiciously
to the center and bend way forward, first to the
left side of the house, next to the center, and
finally to the right; then suavely take his seat
at the piano, adjust the bench, smooth out his
tails, finger his cuff links, tilt his head upwards
in an aesthetic angle, and eventually commence
a preliminary warm-up?
Not Rubinstein. He dashes out, gives a half
dozen jerky nods of his grey head, as if he were
impatient for the applause to stop so he could
get down to business; then he seats himself and
starts right off with Beethoven's "Appassionata"
or something as taxing. If the audience insists
on applauding between movements, he will
stand up half way, give a few quick nods, and
get on with the evening's poceedings. When he
finishes, he will acknowledge the ovation with
more nods while mopping his face, hurry to
ward the wings, stop to nod some more, and dis
appear till he must return to bow again.
The way he manipulates a keyboad is not
only dazzling, but you would swear it was hu
manly impossible had you not seen it. And he
has so much more than a dazzling technique
that he is one of the handful of really great
musicians of our days.
He is almost unrivalled as an interpretator of
Beethoven, Chopin, Brahms, and Debussy; and
his program tonight which begins with Bee
thoven's greatest sonata (this is a controversial
point) and includes major works from each of
the composers named, is just the Romantic
piano program a Stanford audience would most
like to hear.
