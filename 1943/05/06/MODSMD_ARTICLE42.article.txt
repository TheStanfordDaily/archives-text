If you happen to read the San Francisco
News, you might have noticed that they car
ried on a very successful campaign to get rid
of all the unnecessary stop signs in "The City."
It might be well for that newspaper of yours
to carry on a similar campaign and get rid of
those stops every five feet on all the roads. If
they aren't really necessary for the safety of
the community there is no excuse to have them
there.
Each stop represents a cup of gasoline. Think
of the number of trips to "The City" that the
stop sign by Hoble represents.
