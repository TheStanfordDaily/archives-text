French allies, threatened to cut off
the Axis garrison of the great naval
bastion from contact with Tunis.

that French native troops operating
on the rugged north coast above the
Americans had captured Cap t
Koarne, 11 miles west of Bizerte and
reached the edge of the plain north
west of Lake Bizerte.
