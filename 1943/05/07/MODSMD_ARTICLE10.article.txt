Part of a Jewish Service will be
held in the Stanford Memorial
Church this Sunday. Rabbi Irving
F. Reichert of Temple Emanu-El of
San Francisco will give the sermon
and Cantor Reuben F. Rinder will
participate. The Stanford choir will
sing the Hebrew responses. In order
to prepare for this service, Cantor
Rinder rehearsed with the Stanford
Choir Thursday evening.
The introduction of a Jewish serv
ice will give many students their
lirst experience of this kind. It has
been arranged in adherence to the
desire of Mrs. Stanford who wanted
the Stanford Church to include all
faiths. This is the first time for sev
eral years such an arrangement has

l been made. Everyone is invited to
, attend.

' Sunday to provide for those who
' wish to worship early. Dr. D. Elton
! Trueblood, Chaplain of the Univer
j sity, will give a brief meditation on
; personal religion at this first early
| morning service. On subsequent
Sundays, it will be led by students.
