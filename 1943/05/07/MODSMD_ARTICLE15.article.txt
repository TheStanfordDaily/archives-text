"Ah's all up in the pink clouds of
Green Pastures' Heaven, and ah ain't
comin' down till 1 a.m. Sunday when
the Roble formal ends over in the
Women's Gym."
Bobbie Upshaw, chairman of the
dance committee which will begin
decorating today, asked:
4 'Any men who haven't anything
to do tomorrow afternoon can come
over and help us lift celing in the
Women's Gym any time after
lunch."
