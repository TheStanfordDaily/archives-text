# Rubinstein Gives Piano 'The Works'
## 
### Cyclone Covey 
Artur Rubinstein gave the Ro
mantic Piano the works last night.
And if half the Memorial Hall audi
ence had not got up to leave after
the third encore, he undoubtedly
would have given more.
His program's outstanding section
was the group of compositions by
that other great Polish pianist, who
if I am not mistaken, inaugurated
the line of great Polish pianists.
Chopin himself must never have
achieved a more ultra-ultimate ren
dition of his own Ballada, opus 49;
No. 3, and his Polonaise, opus 53;
and the ritziest Paris salon probably
never heard him perform his Noc
turne, No. 5, and his Minute Waltz
(which was Rubinstein's first encore)
more effectively.
There is no more astounding tech
nique than Rubinstein's in the busi
ness; and his tone is to be noted as
a most gratifying relief from the
hard tone of the keyboard bangers
we have been hearing who style
themselves virtuosi. For Rubinstein,
probably greater than the rest, has a
beautiful, unhanging tone.
However, he did take a pianissimo
passage in deFalla's "Ritual Fire
Dance,'' fortissimo. But it is really
better that way, and you can get so
much more applause. This number
was one of the most terrific piano
renditions ever heard here.
For so mighty a work as Beetho
ven's "Appassionata," with which
the concert began, Rubinstein played
a little sedately; but "sedately" is
never an accurate appraisal of his
recitals as a whole.
The Shostakovich Polka, the
Brahms Intermezzi, and the Debussy
A minor Prelude require attention
as unsurpassably performed. And
in fact, the whole evening requires
acknowledgment as the very height
of piano concert possibilities.
