# CON HOME
## Plans Formed For Labor Day 
### 
Labor Day, big feature of the Con
valescent Home Drive week May 17
to 21, will be on Wednesday, with
General Chairman of work parties,
Rube Mettler, planning devious
methods to get a big turnout at the
Convalescent Home grounds.
According to Mettler, horses and
wagons may provide transportation
to the Home for workers who will
hoe weeds, clear paths, paint toys,
and direct traffic. Frank Jameson is
in charge of transportation.
Students will be asked to start
work as near 3 p.m. as possible, Met
tler said, and the wagons will pick
them up at various points on the
campus.
Marian Karstarphen will be in
charge of the toy painting gang.
Girls will be asked to help her wield
paint brushes and rejuvenate the
kiddies' toys.
Three main "cleaning up" jobs
must be done, Mettler said. The en
trance to the Convalescent Home on
Highway 101 must be cleared of the
weeds that are now choking it, the
playgrounds must be cleared, and
the bushes overgrowing the paths
must be cut back.
Carl Coulson has been appointed
work foreman and will supervise
these jobs. Men will be needed to
clean up the weeds and haul them
