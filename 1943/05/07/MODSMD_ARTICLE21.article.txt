# Bands Fail, Story Frail, Picture Stale

### 
Even with the bands of Count
Basic, Freddie Martin, and Ray Me-
Kinnley and a number of other well
known entertainers, Hit Parade of
1943 proved no more than just a
second rate musical.
All the routines were gaudy and
typically Hollywood, the song ar
rangements were so commercial that
the bands completely lost their in
dividuality.
The moth-eaten plot can be sum
marized in a few sentences. A song
writer, played by John Carroll,
steals a song written by a sweet
young thing, played by Susan Hay
ward. He talks her into becoming
his ghost writer and they fall in
love. This is temporarily interrupted
by the other girl, Gail Patrick, but
all ends well.
The second feature is "Tonight We
Raid Calais." The March of Time
and the previews were passable.â€”
