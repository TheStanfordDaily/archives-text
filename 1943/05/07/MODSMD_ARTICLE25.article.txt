# 'Food for Europe After War Depends on Weather--Bennett
## 
### 
"Barring one major misfortune, the needy of Europe can probably be fed
.vhen they bccome accessible—perhaps not at a level of adequate nutrition,
:>ut at a level to preclude hunger," Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, executive di
rector of the Food Research Institute, declared in an article in the May
issue of "Free World."
The one major misfortune would be unfavorable weather for the grain

crops in either or both Continental
Europe and North America. "This
might transform the present sur
pluses into a shortage before the
summer of 1944."
The article, entitled "Food for Eu
rope," set forth seven questions
which the international food con
ference would have to consider at
its meeting on May 15.
Food, a Weapon
On the question of immediate re
lief, Dr. Bennett stated that "while
the war endures and not improb
ably afterwards, food is likely to
remain a weapon of war and di
plomacy. Spme of the needy may
receive relief while the war con
tinues—but only after capitulation,
or as quid pro quo for desertion
from or for aid against the enemy, or
as humanitarian action in the few
places where uelief of hunger could
not possibly support enemy efforts,
even indirectly."
The Food Conference must also
consider when and how they will
distribute the food in the occupied
areas. This will depend in many
ways upon when and how those
areas are occupied by the Allied
troops.
After Victory
"The war may conceivably end in
Europe within the year," he said, "by
collapse of the Axis powers before
the territory they now hold is in
vaded. If so, huge populations
would become accessible soon and
within a few weeks of the cessation
of warfare. The task of food relief
would assume enormous proportions
both promptly and suddenly.
"On the other hand, the victory of
the Allies might creep rather than
spring. The long war with piecemeal
conquest of territory would simplify
the task of food relief by breaking
it into a succession series of rela
tively small operations, in each of
which experience would be gained.
Total Task
"However, it would tend to mag
nify the total task if continuing war
fare means progressive decline in
the productivity of domestic agri
culture within the shrinking fortress
of the Axis powers."
To deal with such a situation, Dr.
Bennett feels that the United Na
tions should establish a stockpile of
food for the relief of Europe, such
as the stockpile mentioned by Mr.
Churchill in August, 1940.
The establishment of such a
stockpile would in turn raise numer
ous questions. The problems of
payment for the food would be diffi
cult. Probably food would be bought
by the foreign country and paid for
by it. There would be food sent to
the government under Lease-Lend
agreement, and food donated to the
government.
Stockpile
In addition, to secure sufficient
supplies, all of the food producing
nations in the United Nations would
have to participate in tlie stockpile
and in the planning which has to be
done.
"The problem of planning upon
sources of supply for relief food is,
therefore, a joint problem—of loca
tion of available supplies, of arrang
ing terms for their use, and of ship
ping to bring them forward at need.
It requires joint consideration by
the United Nations rather than uni
lateral action."
A further uncertainty upon which
the whole program will depend is
the degree of disorganizations in
which the needy country will be
when it becomes accessible to the
Allies.

Europe and North America. "This
might transform the present sur
pluses into a shortage before the
summer of 1944."
The article, entitled "Food for Eu
rope," set forth seven questions
which the international food con
ference would have to consider at
its meeting on May 15.
Food, a Weapon
On the question of immediate re
lief, Dr. Bennett stated that "while
the war endures and not improb
ably afterwards, food is likely to
remain a weapon of war and di
plomacy. Spme of the needy may
receive relief while the war con
tinues—but only after capitulation,
or as quid pro quo for desertion
from or for aid against the enemy, or
as humanitarian action in the few
places where uelief of hunger could
not possibly support enemy efforts,
even indirectly."
The Food Conference must also
consider when and how they will
distribute the food in the occupied
areas. This will depend in many
ways upon when and how those
areas are occupied by the Allied
troops.
After Victory
"The war may conceivably end in
Europe within the year," he said, "by
collapse of the Axis powers before
the territory they now hold is in
vaded. If so, huge populations
would become accessible soon and
within a few weeks of the cessation
of warfare. The task of food relief
would assume enormous proportions
both promptly and suddenly.
"On the other hand, the victory of
the Allies might creep rather than
spring. The long war with piecemeal
conquest of territory would simplify
the task of food relief by breaking
it into a succession series of rela
tively small operations, in each of
which experience would be gained.
Total Task
"However, it would tend to mag
nify the total task if continuing war
fare means progressive decline in
the productivity of domestic agri
culture within the shrinking fortress
of the Axis powers."
To deal with such a situation, Dr.
Bennett feels that the United Na
tions should establish a stockpile of
food for the relief of Europe, such
as the stockpile mentioned by Mr.
Churchill in August, 1940.
The establishment of such a
stockpile would in turn raise numer
ous questions. The problems of
payment for the food would be diffi
cult. Probably food would be bought
by the foreign country and paid for
by it. There would be food sent to
the government under Lease-Lend
agreement, and food donated to the
government.
Stockpile
In addition, to secure sufficient
supplies, all of the food producing
nations in the United Nations would
have to participate in tlie stockpile
and in the planning which has to be
done.
"The problem of planning upon
sources of supply for relief food is,
therefore, a joint problem—of loca
tion of available supplies, of arrang
ing terms for their use, and of ship
ping to bring them forward at need.
It requires joint consideration by
the United Nations rather than uni
lateral action."
A further uncertainty upon which
the whole program will depend is
the degree of disorganizations in
which the needy country will be
when it becomes accessible to the
Allies.
"Barring one major misfortune, the needy of Europe can probably be fed
.vhen they bccome accessible—perhaps not at a level of adequate nutrition,
:>ut at a level to preclude hunger," Dr. Merrill K. Bennett, executive di
rector of the Food Research Institute, declared in an article in the May
issue of "Free World."
The one major misfortune would be unfavorable weather for the grain

crops in either or both Continental
Europe and North America. "This
might transform the present sur
pluses into a shortage before the
summer of 1944."
