riger Arnold Eddy to compete against

J1 ovei - the Southland: U.C.L.A.,
Whittier, Pomona, Redlands, San Di
ego State, and Occidental. A1 Ra
gan's Bears and Cromwell's Trojans
sre, of course, interested only in
their dual meet. Other squads were
invited to build up the spectator ap

concentrating on the sprints in S.C.'s
various meets in Los Angeles. The
Trojan recently tied Charley Pad
dock's 300-yard world record of
:30.2.

vitational, he won easily over Cal's j
Jim Dunn in :48.2. Against Fresno j
State two weeks ago, he toured the j
distance against a stiff wind in :49.6, !
Comparison in 220
Only basis for comparison of marks |
to date is in the 220. Bourland last
week "loafed" the distance in :21.6, |
according to the Los Angeles Times.

second to Peyton Jordan in the in- j
vitational meet.
The entrance of Fulton in the af
fair brings together on the same j

quarter-milers in the country. Gro
wer Klemmer, the third, will not run |
the 440, but the 880. however. The |
Bear ace has a bad leg which Ragan
believes is not yet ready for sprint- j
ing.
