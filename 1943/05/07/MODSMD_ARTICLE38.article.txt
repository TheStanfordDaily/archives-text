## BASEBALL Indian To Face S.F. Dons In Double-Header Tomorrow 
### Bill Allen 
Hopeful for a victory and certain that they are going to give their all,
Stanford's up-and-down baseball team will face the Dons from U.S.F.
tomorrow on the Sunken Diamond in two games. The games will com
mence at 1:15, thus preventing a repeat of the marathon that took place
last Tuesday.
On the basis of recent showings the Reds appear to have a slight edge

over the Dons, but anything can
happen and probably will. Both
teams have had a bad time against
Santa Clara and California, but the
Indians looked better against St.
Mary's than did U.S.F., and that plus
the fact that the new Card infield is
one of the best in the league, should
provide the margin for a win.
Dempsey To Work
The Stanford men may experience
a bad time at the plate in one of the
games, when they face versatile Con
Dempsey, one of the best hurlers in
the league. They should have an
easy time of it in the other tilt when
they will have to bat against either
Jack McCarthy or Ed Hanna, neither
of which has an excellent record.
For Stanford Doc Mason and Jack
Miller should do the pitching and
should either get into difficulty they
will be spelled by Bernard Woody
or Dick Flatland. Flatland did an
excellent job against St. Mary's last
week and should see some service.
Cardinclli at Second
The infield will remain the same
for the Cards with Howie Dallmar at
first, newcomer Bob Cardinelli at
second, Bob Brown at short, and Jay
McKie at third. These boys looked
good last week and much credit for
this must be given to Cardinelli who,
playing his first game for the squad,
turned in an errorless.performance
at the keystone sack.
The outfield berths will probably
be handled by Keith Pinion in right,
Floyd Merriman in center, and Bill
Cunha in left. These lads are power
at the plate as well as capable out
fielders.
Probable starting lineups:
Stanford—Cunha, If; Pinion, rf;
Merriman, cf; Brown, ss; Dallmar,
lb: Walkup, c; McKie, 3b; Cardinelli,
2b; Mason and Miller, p.
U.S.F.—McCall, cf; Hanna and
Harless, lb; Fiscalini, If; Renna, rf;
Moore, c; Maher, 2b; Boland, ss;
Dias, 3b; Dempsey and Hanna or
McCarthy, p.
Stanford's bowling team has been
Pacific Coast champ for the past
three, years in a row.
