# Ranch Rumpus Held Tonight
## 
### 
"We expect the second Ranch
Rumpus tonight to be even better
than the only thing the matter with
the first time was the absence of
women," said Joan Hill yesterday as
she urged all Stanford women to
attend the dance in the Pavilion to
night.
"Because Army men stationed on
campus have been invited to attend,
even more women are needed than
last time to avoid having male 'wall
flowers'," she added.
The dance will be informal and
will be a no-date affair. It will last
from 8 until 11:30.
Ellen Davis, who has arranged the
program, will be mistress of cere
monies and Dr. Max Savelle will
help demonstrate folk dances. There
will also be ballroom dancing.
