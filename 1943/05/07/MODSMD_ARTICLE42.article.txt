FULTON MEETS 80l IiLAND
Stanford track fans and most o l '
the competitors alike will have to
wait for Sunday morning's paper to
get in on the week-end's cinder do
ings. Down south U.S.C. meets Cali
fornia in the dual meet of the year,
with the Farm's Johnny Fulton en
tered as ari added attraction.
Pilch Johnson's fortes, pie
vented lÂ»y B.A.C. traveling policy,
among oilier things, from going
down for the afTair. will hold trials
tomorrow as usual, with service
men invited to compete.
Getting back to the Trojan-Bruin
affair in general, and Fulton's en
trance in particular, the dope just
came through yesterday afternoon.
It seems that Arnold Eddy, S.C.
graduate manager, was afraid the
dual meet itself wouldn't draw
enough cash customers, so he in
vited U.C.L.A. and all the other
teams in the area to compete.
Fulton, who's been working to
ward and dreaming of this chance to
run against Cliff Bourland, was con
tacted by Eddy yesterday and in
vited to compete also, expenses paid.
With Johnny thus on his way
south, the question we want an

swered is, why isn't the rest of the
squad going with him?
We know there's a war on; we
also know the crew made the trip
south by paying their own ex
penses. The track team was will
ing to pay its own expenses too,
just to get a crack at S.C., but
the Trojans didn't invite them to
come down. In fact, Arnold Eddy
said over the phone yesterday that
they wouldn't even let Stanford's
top high jumper, Willard Smith,
compete, whether he paid his own
way down or not.
The whole thing might have been
worked out a while back, but it's
too late now. Perhaps Farm track -
sters such as Bub Compton, Smith,
A1 Pande, Joe Mardesich, and Bil".
Quackenbush, who saw the Indians
whipped by S.C. and edged out by
U.C.L.A. last year, may get partial
revenge in the Fresno Relays 011
May 22.
