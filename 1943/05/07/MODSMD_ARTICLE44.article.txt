# Rumpus Number Two
## 
### 
TDNIGHT in the Pavilion the W.A.A. will give
a second Ranch Rumpus. This is in a Stan
ford tradition, the tradition of the jolly-up.
Probably every student read about the jolly
ups in his Handbook before he came to Stan
ford. When he got here, however, he discov
ered that while the jolly-ups w»re a tradition,
they weren't in existence. Something seemed
to fizzle out every time one was given.
This quarter, the W.A.A. decided to try to
revive that tradition once more. They gave a
Ranch Rumpus. It was a jolly-up in the Wom
en's Gym, and it went over big.
When the STARS came on campus, Cardi
nals decided to take another try at giving a
jolly-up. They gave the Nitery Housewarming.
It was also a big success.
The soldiers came, and the students came.
Both men and women came stag, and they had
a good time.
Tonight the W.A.A. is holding another Rum
pus. They have proved that the jolly-up, under
another name and in another time, is a success.
They deserve a lot of credit for proving it and
for starting something that ought to become
a living part of Stanford as as a traditional
part. —Lucile Thompson
