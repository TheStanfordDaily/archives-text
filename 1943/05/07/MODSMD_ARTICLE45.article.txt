# Today and Tomorrow
## 
### 
BEGINNING today, one hundred and seventy
teachers and professors will come to Stan
ford for a humanities conference. They will be
here today and tomorrow.
Some of them are coming from some dis
tance, an uncomfortable task in wartime. All
of them will be living under cramped condi
tions during their stay.
They are spending their time and money
and energy to come to Stanford to listen to
speeches on the humanities. The speeches will
be good speeches. They will be given by men
who think and who have some background on
which to base their thinking.
These speeches are open to the public. The
students and soldiers here are invited to go to
the conference. The admission is free, and it
will be well worth their while.â€”Lucile Thomp
