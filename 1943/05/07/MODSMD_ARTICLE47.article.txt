# BULL SESSION
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
Friday afternoon following the Spring Sing,
while Neop Tolemus was riding her piggy-back
across Memorial Court, Tibby was yelling out,
"Johnny, won't you please go home!"
"That was the best one, wasn't it?" she
asked but before Neop could agree, Tibby
wanted to know, "What's that?" A distant
rumbling was approaching.
"That's Emerson Hiler. He's about a mile
away now."
Tibby was about to make more queries on
the approaching basso, when an athletic figure
bicycled into her range of vision.
"Here comes Dean Bunn," said Neop. "Say
'Tallo Ho' to Dean Bun, Tibby."
"Tally Ho, Dean Bunn!" Tibby called out.
And since she is an irresistible Mongolian
idiot, Dean Bunn cheerily stopped to return the
greeting. "Where did you learn about that
expression?" he was curious to know.
But just as Tibby was about to reply, another
figure distracted her attention. "Who's that?"
she asked.
"That is our great Chancellor, Dr. Wilbur,"
Neop replied. "He can play the Jew's harp,
too."
"Tally Ho! Dr. Wilbur," she yelled immedi
ately. "Let's hear you play the Jew's harp."
So the Chancellor too stopped to exchange
greetings with our captivating Mongolian idiot,
and also with Dean Bunn—, which proves the
two are still on speaking terms.
"Well, I happen to have my Jew's harp right
here," and Dr. Wilbur obligingly drew the in
strument from his coat pocket and began to
plung. Dean Bunn got quickly into the spirit
of the occasion, and sang out the tune—for he
recognized what the Chancellor was plunging
—in a robust tenor voice.
At this moment Emerson Hiler arrived sing
ing the "Whiffenpoof Song," which happened to
be exactly what the Chancellor and the Dean
were intoning; and he added his basso to the
concert. "... We're little black sheep who
have gone astray ..." they sang.
At this point, Leslie Langnecker happened to
be skipping merrily home from her 1-o'clock
and was just in time to add a colotura obligato.
When the last "Baa, baa, baa" was dying out,
Tibby pulled Leslie's sleeve, and said, "What's
them?"
And Leslie, who knows all the answers, re
plied, "Those are old-fashioned bathing beau
ties from the Spring Show. They're going to
do an olio act in Lake Lagunita at 2 today."
"It's nearly 2 now," said Dean Bunn. "We're
just in time." And as the group moved across
the inner Quad toward the lake, Chancellor
Wilbur struck up "Behind the Swinging Doors,"
and as the others took up the refrain, Tibby,
riding Neop's back, yelled, "Johnny, won't you
please go home!"
