The Editor, Sir:
From every side I have heard of the success
of Cardinals' Friday night Nitery Housewaming.
Everyone, soldiers and students, seemed to
have a good time. And the only expense was
a little work and a small amount of money used
for refreshments.
Although the Nitery will be open evey Fri
day night, why doesn't Excom or Women's Con
ference provide for a sponsor each time? This ;
way more girls would be inclined to come—if |
they feit they were doing it as part of a goup— |
and perhaps the refreshment problem could be
solved in this way too.
If the individual sponsors didn't want to foot
the expense of providing for all-comers, per
haps a concession system could be worked out.
Here's to the success of the Nitery Habit." I
