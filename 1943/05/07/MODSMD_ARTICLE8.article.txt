ALLIED HQ., North Africa, May
6 (UP). —Allied armies opened a
crushing general offensive on Bi
zerte and Tunis today, and British
| tank and infantry units, advancing
; ten miles across the open plain, cap
i tured Mossicault, only sixteen miles
south of the Tunisian capital.
American troops captured the last
hills on the northwest approaches of |
Bizerte, only nine miles away, and
; to the south and southeast of the
| great naval base advanced on a wide
front against fierce Axis resistance.
The Bizerte harbor area was set
| afire by American artillery.
t Supreme Push
The big Allied offensive was an
nounced in a special communique
j and all reports from the battle front
i indicated this was the final supreme
; push to drive the enemy into the
' sea.
Behind a thunderous artillery
i barrage, the Allies attacked just he
j fore dawn today and with the first
| light hundreds of light bombers and
fighters joined the battle in one of ,
the greatest displays of aerial might j
| ever displayed in any of the African
I theaters.
Massive Attacks
i More than 2,000 sorties were
, fought—l,2oo of them concentrated
in the sector of the British break-
I through where a three-by-four-mile
area was subjected to a hail of
' bombs and bullets to pave the way
; for the First Army's charge.
The massive British attacks hur-
I died the last mountain barriers be
fore Tunis and Massicault and a
wide plain opened out for wheeling
armored movements at which the
British are past masters. The ad
vance also outflanked the remaining
Axis positions in the Merjerda val
ley to the northwest and the Ger
mans were reported evacuating Te
bourba.
Bom hard me nts
Any enemy units remaining in
that area faced encirclement as the
Allies drove on Tebourba from the
! northwest.
Heavier bombers pounded the
harbors of Sicily and Naples, sink
ing a number of potential evacua
tion ships.
