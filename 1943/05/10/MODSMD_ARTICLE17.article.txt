# Reds Make It 4 in a Row, Whip Dons Twice
## Miller, Woody Hurl Victories 
### Bill Allen 
The Stanford baseball nine ran
their win streak up to four in a row
last Saturday afternoon by trounc
ing the U.S.F. Dons twice, 14-7 and
7-2, on the Sunken Diamond. Jack
Miller and Bernard Woody were the
victors for the Reds while Con
Dempsey was charged with both de
feats for the Dons.
In the first game the Cardinals
went out in front by virtue of Bob
Brown's triple, a double by Howie
Dallmar, and a long homerun by
Jay McKie. These blows accounted
for three runs and the Indians were
never headed after that time. Mc-
Kie's homerun was the first round
tripper of the present league season
for the Cards.
Holds Dons lo 4 Hits
Jack Miller went the entire route
allowing 10 hits and 7 runs while the
combined efforts of Dempsey and his
relief. Jack McCarthy, held the Reds
to 11 hits which they were able to
turn into 14 runs.
The second game looked like a
different story until the fifth inning,
for until that time all the honors
either team could gather were two
unearned runs. Then in the last of
the fifth frame the Cardinals came
to life and the Dons blew up com
pletely. The Reds collected all their
hits of the game, three, and the
Dons collected all their errors, six.
This combination enabled the Farm
boys to push across six runs and sew
up the ball game.
Holds Dons to 4
Bernard Woody, who handled the
Stanford mound assignment in the
nightcap, held the Dons to only four
hits, never more than one an in
ning, although the San Franciscans
were able to score two unearned
runs.
Con Dempsey, Don pitcher, was
charged with both defeats but that
sounds worse that it really was. He
had the misfortune to have his team
mates' errors come at the same in
ning that he allowed hits and these
combined to lose him the ball games,
