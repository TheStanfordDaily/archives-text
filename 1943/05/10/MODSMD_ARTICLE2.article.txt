# CON HOME
## Tag Day To Open Drive 
### 
Tag Day, big opener of the Con- j
valescent Home Drive next Monday, |
will feature 50 beautiful girls urging
the campus to "tag up for a tot" and
"get off the dime and give it to the i
kiddies," according to Margery Mize,
general chairman of Tag Day.
"Tags will be a dime apiece, and j
they are not rationed," Miss Mize ;
commented. "You can buy as many
as you wish."
Salesgirls will be located at every
prominent place on Quad, at. the j
Bookstore, the Post Office, the Cel
lar, and even at the Boathouse "to j
catch tag evaders," she said.
Anna Lundstrom is in charge of
the freshman women who will sell
tags.
"We're hoping the soldiers on j
campus will come through and buy
a tag for the benefit of the kiddies in
the Convalescent Home." Miss Mize
added.
Tag Day is a regular feature of the ;
annual drive week, in which Stan- j
lord students and friends contribute ,
to the maintenance of the Conva
lescent Home, Stanford's charity lo
cated on the campus.
