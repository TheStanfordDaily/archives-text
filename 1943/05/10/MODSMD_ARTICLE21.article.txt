# Conference Leaders Discuss New Approach to Humanities
## 
### Cheri Martin 
''Our mission here is to lie intelli
gently self-critical of humanities. If
we can revitalize our whole approach
to the study of man, this conference
will he worthwhile," Dean John W,
Oodds of the School of Humanities
stated in his welcoming address to
the delegates to the Humanities Con
ference which was held here Friday
and Saturday.
A plea for educators to give their
students ."something to live for, to
fight for and to die for" was sounded
by Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina at the opening ses
sion. College and university profes
sors everywhere have filled their
students' minds with generalities and
dead discouragements, have misedu
cated them, and have made them un
fit to face the world they live in with
real imagination, inspiration, and
hope, Green charged in a paper pre
sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
Science Not Substitute
"The world has begun to realize
that science offers no substitute for a
full way of life—of religion and
beauty. China has known this for
thousands of years, though it in
dented gunpowder," he said in a
paper read in his absence to 180
delegates from Western colleges and
universities by Dean Dodds. Mr.
Green was detained at the last mo
ment in Hollywood where he is
working on a war script.
The North Carolina professor of
dramatic arts declared that if edu
cators cannot confess their failure to
give anything but a discouraging list
of facts instead of something to live
for, fight for, and something to die
for, "then it were better that our
calling were abolished and every
Ph.D. of us set to cleaning the guns,
or hauling trash, or dozing in the
.sun out of life and harm's way."
Our Responsibility
For the first time in the 350 years
of American history the cultural and
spiritual leadership of the world is
in American care, Mr. Green said.
"Art, literature, music, drama,
true science, philosophy, and all
the noblest creations of man's
genius are dislodged and beaten
almost beyond surviving there in
Europe and Asia. It is up to us to
provide them a new home, a fane
for their worship, a sheltering ca
thedral over them," be declared.
At the Friday afternoon session,
Frederic Spiegelherg, lecturer in
the School of Humanities, spoke on
the Japanese mind. He stated that
the Japanese have a psychological
weapon, Bushido. Bushido includes
an inferiority complex that ac
counts for the anonymity of their
actions, a lack of individuality,
and the achievement of a highly
detached attitude toward life.
"This detachment leaves the
Japanese unable to distinguish
between good and evil . . .and
takes away the Vestraint of an in
dividual conscience."
"The Japanese thus possess in
their highest cultural heritage in
sights and practices that might give
them a dangerous psychological
weapon," he said. "But these prac
tices draw their entire meaning and
effort from the spiritual moods of
the high and subtle religious tra
dition."
He stated that the leaders are
making the mistake of trusting in
the efficiency of the Bushido methods

without at the same time catering to
j its spiritual background just as the
J Germans are instilling a strong
I "German" feeling without reference
to their cultural background.

"This method is bound to meet
with final disaster," he declared.
'The strong anti-militaristic feeling
that was prevalent and until recently
visible throughout Japan is the most
hopeful basis for a future coopera
tion of the Japanese people in the
coming world of peace," he con
cluded.
State Dominance
Lynn T. White, professor of his
tory, in discussing "The Seeds of
Totalitarianism," pointed to state
dominance and its development
in a group with a chosen-people
complex basing its membership on
some social or religious criterior,
such as anti-Negro, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic, or anti-union senti
ment. He also pointed out the de
velopment of a doctrine of the elite
—that tendency to divide the race
between rulers and those who ought
to be ruled.
A four-point program for the hu
manities in a war and post-war
world was then outlined by Waldo
G. Leland, director of the American
Council of Learned Societies.
IJole During War
During the war, humanities must
fulfill two aims," he said: "Mak
ing specific contributions toward
winning the war through supply
ing our military forces with vital
knowledge of the geography and
languages of strategic areas of the
world and by maintaining the in
tellectual life of the nation at a
high level."
In the post-war world, he said,
"the humanities must contribute
to international understanding
through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under
standing of the needs themselves and
their changing manifestations, and
they must know how to adapt what
they have to offer to the require

ments of the times," he concluded.
Post-War Program
A definite post-war program was j
established Friday night by Dr. G.
A. Borgese, of the University of I
Chicago, who advocated "Domoso- |
cialism" as the cornerstone of a Re
public of the World.
"Our society needs something
more than state capitalism adminis- j
tering social welfare, and something j
better than the unwieldly hybrid of j
j social democracy. The new society
' must be democratic, that is, coop
i erative socialism —with the liberty j
of the single man and groups articu- !
lated in the brotherhood of the '
whole, which is the Republic of the ;
! World."
Humanism, he said, must imply a
a religious spirit, open to all races i
and higher creeds. He branded Na
-1 zism and Fascism as outgrowths of
: the '"religion of pessimism."
General Education
Saturday morning David H. Ste
vens, director of the humanities of
the Rockefeller Foundation, stated
j how the humanities might better
serve the individual need through
systems of general education, liberal
colleges and graduate schools. "Be
cause change of values is constant,
the student should study changes,"
Ihe said. "The teacher should take
account of the chances to assimilate
and discard as well as to fit the work
i to the developing needs of the learn
; er."
"Humanities establishes order
within the individual and he comes
to possess values to live by as well
as to die for. He will develop for
himself not a career but a character,
and he will know his way in the
world of mind and spirit," he said in
describing the benefits of a study of
the humanities.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
of Stanford, discussed environ
ment and its effect on a nation for
the development of cultures de
pending upon the natural re
sources available as analogous to
the development in the humani
ties. He said that studies of the
humanities can demonstrate their
values not only in human happi
ness hut also in advance, for the
trained and penetrating eye can
see false from true in government
and social phenomena and makes
advance more secure and rapid.
Re-orientation Need
Lewis Mumford, professor of hu
manities. gave the final speech of the
conference in which he stated that
this generation was characterized by
two deep-seated failures—a flight
from reality in the enjoyment of
pleasure and disbelief in the higher
lift of man, and the worship of the
created good in the form of the ma
chine, forgetting the creator.
"This is the time for a radical re
orientation in ideas, habits, impulses,
I and directives—such a change as
only a world in catastrophe could
i bring about and carry through," he
declared. "Humanities are not a
rainbow to give hope after the storm,
I but they are an integral part of the
war."
He said that every soldier be not
only armed with weapons but also
with a knowledge of the inheritance
of the past. "He will then be twice
armed and prepared for the even
tualities of defeat or victory, frus
l tration or fulfillment, death or life.
The valid reason for urging a more
| intense dedication to the humanities
j during the war is not merely in or
der that we can live better after the
! war but that we can fight better now
1 when we need fighters, and in gov
' ernment to bring the cool-headed
| tkill and unyielding vigilance of
| Socrates and Plato."
He emphasized the pressing need
. | of typing the future of humanities
| with the future of humanity itself.
He outlined the chief problem in the
post-war world as the need to for
get our belief that our life is a norm
for all civilization and that the hu
manities are not the special creation
of the Western civilizations, in our
attempts to plan and carry out an
[ effective peace.

through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under
standing of the needs themselves and
their changing manifestations, and
they must know how to adapt what
they have to offer to the require

ments of the times," he concluded.
Post-War Program
A definite post-war program was j
established Friday night by Dr. G.
A. Borgese, of the University of I
Chicago, who advocated "Domoso- |
cialism" as the cornerstone of a Re
public of the World.
"Our society needs something
more than state capitalism adminis- j
tering social welfare, and something j
better than the unwieldly hybrid of j
j social democracy. The new society
' must be democratic, that is, coop
i erative socialism —with the liberty j
of the single man and groups articu- !
lated in the brotherhood of the '
whole, which is the Republic of the ;
! World."
Humanism, he said, must imply a
a religious spirit, open to all races i
and higher creeds. He branded Na
-1 zism and Fascism as outgrowths of
: the '"religion of pessimism."
General Education
Saturday morning David H. Ste
vens, director of the humanities of
the Rockefeller Foundation, stated
j how the humanities might better
serve the individual need through
systems of general education, liberal
colleges and graduate schools. "Be
cause change of values is constant,
the student should study changes,"
Ihe said. "The teacher should take
account of the chances to assimilate
and discard as well as to fit the work
i to the developing needs of the learn
; er."
"Humanities establishes order
within the individual and he comes
to possess values to live by as well
as to die for. He will develop for
himself not a career but a character,
and he will know his way in the
world of mind and spirit," he said in
describing the benefits of a study of
the humanities.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
of Stanford, discussed environ
ment and its effect on a nation for
the development of cultures de
pending upon the natural re
sources available as analogous to
the development in the humani
ties. He said that studies of the
humanities can demonstrate their
values not only in human happi
ness hut also in advance, for the
trained and penetrating eye can
see false from true in government
and social phenomena and makes
advance more secure and rapid.
Re-orientation Need
Lewis Mumford, professor of hu
manities. gave the final speech of the
conference in which he stated that
this generation was characterized by
two deep-seated failures—a flight
from reality in the enjoyment of
pleasure and disbelief in the higher
lift of man, and the worship of the
created good in the form of the ma
chine, forgetting the creator.
"This is the time for a radical re
orientation in ideas, habits, impulses,
I and directives—such a change as
only a world in catastrophe could
i bring about and carry through," he
declared. "Humanities are not a
rainbow to give hope after the storm,
I but they are an integral part of the
war."
He said that every soldier be not
only armed with weapons but also
with a knowledge of the inheritance
of the past. "He will then be twice
armed and prepared for the even
tualities of defeat or victory, frus
l tration or fulfillment, death or life.
The valid reason for urging a more
| intense dedication to the humanities
j during the war is not merely in or
der that we can live better after the
! war but that we can fight better now
1 when we need fighters, and in gov
' ernment to bring the cool-headed
| tkill and unyielding vigilance of
| Socrates and Plato."
He emphasized the pressing need
. | of typing the future of humanities
| with the future of humanity itself.
He outlined the chief problem in the
post-war world as the need to for
get our belief that our life is a norm
for all civilization and that the hu
manities are not the special creation
of the Western civilizations, in our
attempts to plan and carry out an
[ effective peace.


LOUIS MUMFORD
''Our mission here is to lie intelli
gently self-critical of humanities. If
we can revitalize our whole approach
to the study of man, this conference
will he worthwhile," Dean John W,
Oodds of the School of Humanities
stated in his welcoming address to
the delegates to the Humanities Con
ference which was held here Friday
and Saturday.
A plea for educators to give their
students ."something to live for, to
fight for and to die for" was sounded
by Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina at the opening ses
sion. College and university profes
sors everywhere have filled their
students' minds with generalities and
dead discouragements, have misedu
cated them, and have made them un
fit to face the world they live in with
real imagination, inspiration, and
hope, Green charged in a paper pre
sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
Science Not Substitute
"The world has begun to realize
that science offers no substitute for a
full way of life—of religion and
beauty. China has known this for
thousands of years, though it in
dented gunpowder," he said in a
paper read in his absence to 180
delegates from Western colleges and
universities by Dean Dodds. Mr.
Green was detained at the last mo
ment in Hollywood where he is
working on a war script.
The North Carolina professor of
dramatic arts declared that if edu
cators cannot confess their failure to
give anything but a discouraging list
of facts instead of something to live
for, fight for, and something to die
for, "then it were better that our
calling were abolished and every
Ph.D. of us set to cleaning the guns,
or hauling trash, or dozing in the
.sun out of life and harm's way."
Our Responsibility
For the first time in the 350 years
of American history the cultural and
spiritual leadership of the world is
in American care, Mr. Green said.
"Art, literature, music, drama,
true science, philosophy, and all
the noblest creations of man's
genius are dislodged and beaten
almost beyond surviving there in
Europe and Asia. It is up to us to
provide them a new home, a fane
for their worship, a sheltering ca
thedral over them," be declared.
At the Friday afternoon session,
Frederic Spiegelherg, lecturer in
the School of Humanities, spoke on
the Japanese mind. He stated that
the Japanese have a psychological
weapon, Bushido. Bushido includes
an inferiority complex that ac
counts for the anonymity of their
actions, a lack of individuality,
and the achievement of a highly
detached attitude toward life.
"This detachment leaves the
Japanese unable to distinguish
between good and evil . . .and
takes away the Vestraint of an in
dividual conscience."
"The Japanese thus possess in
their highest cultural heritage in
sights and practices that might give
them a dangerous psychological
weapon," he said. "But these prac
tices draw their entire meaning and
effort from the spiritual moods of
the high and subtle religious tra
dition."
He stated that the leaders are
making the mistake of trusting in
the efficiency of the Bushido methods

without at the same time catering to
j its spiritual background just as the
J Germans are instilling a strong
I "German" feeling without reference
to their cultural background.

"This method is bound to meet
with final disaster," he declared.
'The strong anti-militaristic feeling
that was prevalent and until recently
visible throughout Japan is the most
hopeful basis for a future coopera
tion of the Japanese people in the
coming world of peace," he con
cluded.
State Dominance
Lynn T. White, professor of his
tory, in discussing "The Seeds of
Totalitarianism," pointed to state
dominance and its development
in a group with a chosen-people
complex basing its membership on
some social or religious criterior,
such as anti-Negro, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic, or anti-union senti
ment. He also pointed out the de
velopment of a doctrine of the elite
—that tendency to divide the race
between rulers and those who ought
to be ruled.
A four-point program for the hu
manities in a war and post-war
world was then outlined by Waldo
G. Leland, director of the American
Council of Learned Societies.
IJole During War
During the war, humanities must
fulfill two aims," he said: "Mak
ing specific contributions toward
winning the war through supply
ing our military forces with vital
knowledge of the geography and
languages of strategic areas of the
world and by maintaining the in
tellectual life of the nation at a
high level."
In the post-war world, he said,
"the humanities must contribute
to international understanding
through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under

fight for and to die for" was sounded
by Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina at the opening ses
sion. College and university profes
sors everywhere have filled their
students' minds with generalities and
dead discouragements, have misedu
cated them, and have made them un
fit to face the world they live in with
real imagination, inspiration, and
hope, Green charged in a paper pre
sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
Science Not Substitute
"The world has begun to realize
that science offers no substitute for a
full way of life—of religion and
beauty. China has known this for
thousands of years, though it in
dented gunpowder," he said in a
paper read in his absence to 180
delegates from Western colleges and
universities by Dean Dodds. Mr.
Green was detained at the last mo
ment in Hollywood where he is
working on a war script.
The North Carolina professor of
dramatic arts declared that if edu
cators cannot confess their failure to
give anything but a discouraging list
of facts instead of something to live
for, fight for, and something to die
for, "then it were better that our
calling were abolished and every
Ph.D. of us set to cleaning the guns,
or hauling trash, or dozing in the
.sun out of life and harm's way."
Our Responsibility
For the first time in the 350 years
of American history the cultural and
spiritual leadership of the world is
in American care, Mr. Green said.
"Art, literature, music, drama,
true science, philosophy, and all
the noblest creations of man's
genius are dislodged and beaten
almost beyond surviving there in
Europe and Asia. It is up to us to
provide them a new home, a fane
for their worship, a sheltering ca
thedral over them," be declared.
At the Friday afternoon session,
Frederic Spiegelherg, lecturer in
the School of Humanities, spoke on
the Japanese mind. He stated that
the Japanese have a psychological
weapon, Bushido. Bushido includes
an inferiority complex that ac
counts for the anonymity of their
actions, a lack of individuality,
and the achievement of a highly
detached attitude toward life.
"This detachment leaves the
Japanese unable to distinguish
between good and evil . . .and
takes away the Vestraint of an in
dividual conscience."
"The Japanese thus possess in
their highest cultural heritage in
sights and practices that might give
them a dangerous psychological
weapon," he said. "But these prac
tices draw their entire meaning and
effort from the spiritual moods of
the high and subtle religious tra
dition."
He stated that the leaders are
making the mistake of trusting in
the efficiency of the Bushido methods

without at the same time catering to
j its spiritual background just as the
J Germans are instilling a strong
I "German" feeling without reference
to their cultural background.

"This method is bound to meet
with final disaster," he declared.
'The strong anti-militaristic feeling
that was prevalent and until recently
visible throughout Japan is the most
hopeful basis for a future coopera
tion of the Japanese people in the
coming world of peace," he con
cluded.
State Dominance
Lynn T. White, professor of his
tory, in discussing "The Seeds of
Totalitarianism," pointed to state
dominance and its development
in a group with a chosen-people
complex basing its membership on
some social or religious criterior,
such as anti-Negro, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic, or anti-union senti
ment. He also pointed out the de
velopment of a doctrine of the elite
—that tendency to divide the race
between rulers and those who ought
to be ruled.
A four-point program for the hu
manities in a war and post-war
world was then outlined by Waldo
G. Leland, director of the American
Council of Learned Societies.
IJole During War
During the war, humanities must
fulfill two aims," he said: "Mak
ing specific contributions toward
winning the war through supply
ing our military forces with vital
knowledge of the geography and
languages of strategic areas of the
world and by maintaining the in
tellectual life of the nation at a
high level."
In the post-war world, he said,
"the humanities must contribute
to international understanding
through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under
standing of the needs themselves and
their changing manifestations, and
they must know how to adapt what
they have to offer to the require

ments of the times," he concluded.
Post-War Program
A definite post-war program was j
established Friday night by Dr. G.
A. Borgese, of the University of I
Chicago, who advocated "Domoso- |
cialism" as the cornerstone of a Re
public of the World.
"Our society needs something
more than state capitalism adminis- j
tering social welfare, and something j
better than the unwieldly hybrid of j
j social democracy. The new society
' must be democratic, that is, coop
i erative socialism —with the liberty j
of the single man and groups articu- !
lated in the brotherhood of the '
whole, which is the Republic of the ;
! World."
Humanism, he said, must imply a
a religious spirit, open to all races i
and higher creeds. He branded Na
-1 zism and Fascism as outgrowths of
: the '"religion of pessimism."
General Education
Saturday morning David H. Ste
vens, director of the humanities of
the Rockefeller Foundation, stated
j how the humanities might better
serve the individual need through
systems of general education, liberal
colleges and graduate schools. "Be
cause change of values is constant,
the student should study changes,"
Ihe said. "The teacher should take
account of the chances to assimilate
and discard as well as to fit the work
i to the developing needs of the learn
; er."
"Humanities establishes order
within the individual and he comes
to possess values to live by as well
as to die for. He will develop for
himself not a career but a character,
and he will know his way in the
world of mind and spirit," he said in
describing the benefits of a study of
the humanities.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
of Stanford, discussed environ
ment and its effect on a nation for
the development of cultures de
pending upon the natural re
sources available as analogous to
the development in the humani
ties. He said that studies of the
humanities can demonstrate their
values not only in human happi
ness hut also in advance, for the
trained and penetrating eye can
see false from true in government
and social phenomena and makes
advance more secure and rapid.
Re-orientation Need
Lewis Mumford, professor of hu
manities. gave the final speech of the
conference in which he stated that
this generation was characterized by
two deep-seated failures—a flight
from reality in the enjoyment of
pleasure and disbelief in the higher
lift of man, and the worship of the
created good in the form of the ma
chine, forgetting the creator.
"This is the time for a radical re
orientation in ideas, habits, impulses,
I and directives—such a change as
only a world in catastrophe could
i bring about and carry through," he
declared. "Humanities are not a
rainbow to give hope after the storm,
I but they are an integral part of the
war."
He said that every soldier be not
only armed with weapons but also
with a knowledge of the inheritance
of the past. "He will then be twice
armed and prepared for the even
tualities of defeat or victory, frus
l tration or fulfillment, death or life.
The valid reason for urging a more
| intense dedication to the humanities
j during the war is not merely in or
der that we can live better after the
! war but that we can fight better now
1 when we need fighters, and in gov
' ernment to bring the cool-headed
| tkill and unyielding vigilance of
| Socrates and Plato."
He emphasized the pressing need
. | of typing the future of humanities
| with the future of humanity itself.
He outlined the chief problem in the
post-war world as the need to for
get our belief that our life is a norm
for all civilization and that the hu
manities are not the special creation
of the Western civilizations, in our
attempts to plan and carry out an
[ effective peace.

ments of the times," he concluded.
Post-War Program
A definite post-war program was j
established Friday night by Dr. G.
A. Borgese, of the University of I
Chicago, who advocated "Domoso- |
cialism" as the cornerstone of a Re
public of the World.
"Our society needs something
more than state capitalism adminis- j
tering social welfare, and something j
better than the unwieldly hybrid of j
j social democracy. The new society
' must be democratic, that is, coop
i erative socialism —with the liberty j
of the single man and groups articu- !
lated in the brotherhood of the '
whole, which is the Republic of the ;
! World."
Humanism, he said, must imply a
a religious spirit, open to all races i
and higher creeds. He branded Na
-1 zism and Fascism as outgrowths of
: the '"religion of pessimism."
General Education
Saturday morning David H. Ste
vens, director of the humanities of
the Rockefeller Foundation, stated
j how the humanities might better
serve the individual need through
systems of general education, liberal
colleges and graduate schools. "Be
cause change of values is constant,
the student should study changes,"
Ihe said. "The teacher should take
account of the chances to assimilate
and discard as well as to fit the work
i to the developing needs of the learn
; er."
"Humanities establishes order
within the individual and he comes
to possess values to live by as well
as to die for. He will develop for
himself not a career but a character,
and he will know his way in the
world of mind and spirit," he said in
describing the benefits of a study of
the humanities.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
of Stanford, discussed environ
ment and its effect on a nation for
the development of cultures de
pending upon the natural re
sources available as analogous to
the development in the humani
ties. He said that studies of the
humanities can demonstrate their
values not only in human happi
ness hut also in advance, for the
trained and penetrating eye can
see false from true in government
and social phenomena and makes
advance more secure and rapid.
Re-orientation Need
Lewis Mumford, professor of hu
manities. gave the final speech of the
conference in which he stated that
this generation was characterized by
two deep-seated failures—a flight
from reality in the enjoyment of
pleasure and disbelief in the higher
lift of man, and the worship of the
created good in the form of the ma
chine, forgetting the creator.
"This is the time for a radical re
orientation in ideas, habits, impulses,
I and directives—such a change as
only a world in catastrophe could
i bring about and carry through," he
declared. "Humanities are not a
rainbow to give hope after the storm,
I but they are an integral part of the
war."
He said that every soldier be not
only armed with weapons but also
with a knowledge of the inheritance
of the past. "He will then be twice
armed and prepared for the even
tualities of defeat or victory, frus
l tration or fulfillment, death or life.
The valid reason for urging a more
| intense dedication to the humanities
j during the war is not merely in or
der that we can live better after the
! war but that we can fight better now
1 when we need fighters, and in gov
' ernment to bring the cool-headed
| tkill and unyielding vigilance of
| Socrates and Plato."
He emphasized the pressing need
. | of typing the future of humanities
| with the future of humanity itself.
He outlined the chief problem in the
post-war world as the need to for
get our belief that our life is a norm
for all civilization and that the hu
manities are not the special creation
of the Western civilizations, in our
attempts to plan and carry out an
[ effective peace.


LOUIS MUMFORD
''Our mission here is to lie intelli
gently self-critical of humanities. If
we can revitalize our whole approach
to the study of man, this conference
will he worthwhile," Dean John W,
Oodds of the School of Humanities
stated in his welcoming address to
the delegates to the Humanities Con
ference which was held here Friday
and Saturday.
A plea for educators to give their
students ."something to live for, to
fight for and to die for" was sounded
by Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina at the opening ses
sion. College and university profes
sors everywhere have filled their
students' minds with generalities and
dead discouragements, have misedu
cated them, and have made them un
fit to face the world they live in with
real imagination, inspiration, and
hope, Green charged in a paper pre
sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
Science Not Substitute
"The world has begun to realize
that science offers no substitute for a
full way of life—of religion and
beauty. China has known this for
thousands of years, though it in
dented gunpowder," he said in a
paper read in his absence to 180
delegates from Western colleges and
universities by Dean Dodds. Mr.
Green was detained at the last mo
ment in Hollywood where he is
working on a war script.
The North Carolina professor of
dramatic arts declared that if edu
cators cannot confess their failure to
give anything but a discouraging list
of facts instead of something to live
for, fight for, and something to die
for, "then it were better that our
calling were abolished and every
Ph.D. of us set to cleaning the guns,
or hauling trash, or dozing in the
.sun out of life and harm's way."
Our Responsibility
For the first time in the 350 years
of American history the cultural and
spiritual leadership of the world is
in American care, Mr. Green said.
"Art, literature, music, drama,
true science, philosophy, and all
the noblest creations of man's
genius are dislodged and beaten
almost beyond surviving there in
Europe and Asia. It is up to us to
provide them a new home, a fane
for their worship, a sheltering ca
thedral over them," be declared.
At the Friday afternoon session,
Frederic Spiegelherg, lecturer in
the School of Humanities, spoke on
the Japanese mind. He stated that
the Japanese have a psychological
weapon, Bushido. Bushido includes
an inferiority complex that ac
counts for the anonymity of their
actions, a lack of individuality,
and the achievement of a highly
detached attitude toward life.
"This detachment leaves the
Japanese unable to distinguish
between good and evil . . .and
takes away the Vestraint of an in
dividual conscience."
"The Japanese thus possess in
their highest cultural heritage in
sights and practices that might give
them a dangerous psychological
weapon," he said. "But these prac
tices draw their entire meaning and
effort from the spiritual moods of
the high and subtle religious tra
dition."
He stated that the leaders are
making the mistake of trusting in
the efficiency of the Bushido methods

without at the same time catering to
j its spiritual background just as the
J Germans are instilling a strong
I "German" feeling without reference
to their cultural background.

"This method is bound to meet
with final disaster," he declared.
'The strong anti-militaristic feeling
that was prevalent and until recently
visible throughout Japan is the most
hopeful basis for a future coopera
tion of the Japanese people in the
coming world of peace," he con
cluded.
State Dominance
Lynn T. White, professor of his
tory, in discussing "The Seeds of
Totalitarianism," pointed to state
dominance and its development
in a group with a chosen-people
complex basing its membership on
some social or religious criterior,
such as anti-Negro, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic, or anti-union senti
ment. He also pointed out the de
velopment of a doctrine of the elite
—that tendency to divide the race
between rulers and those who ought
to be ruled.
A four-point program for the hu
manities in a war and post-war
world was then outlined by Waldo
G. Leland, director of the American
Council of Learned Societies.
IJole During War
During the war, humanities must
fulfill two aims," he said: "Mak
ing specific contributions toward
winning the war through supply
ing our military forces with vital
knowledge of the geography and
languages of strategic areas of the
world and by maintaining the in
tellectual life of the nation at a
high level."
In the post-war world, he said,
"the humanities must contribute
to international understanding
through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under
standing of the needs themselves and
their changing manifestations, and
they must know how to adapt what
they have to offer to the require

sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
Science Not Substitute
"The world has begun to realize
that science offers no substitute for a
full way of life—of religion and
beauty. China has known this for
thousands of years, though it in
dented gunpowder," he said in a
paper read in his absence to 180
delegates from Western colleges and
universities by Dean Dodds. Mr.
Green was detained at the last mo
ment in Hollywood where he is
working on a war script.
The North Carolina professor of
dramatic arts declared that if edu
cators cannot confess their failure to
give anything but a discouraging list
of facts instead of something to live
for, fight for, and something to die
for, "then it were better that our
calling were abolished and every
Ph.D. of us set to cleaning the guns,
or hauling trash, or dozing in the
.sun out of life and harm's way."
Our Responsibility
For the first time in the 350 years
of American history the cultural and
spiritual leadership of the world is
in American care, Mr. Green said.
"Art, literature, music, drama,
true science, philosophy, and all
the noblest creations of man's
genius are dislodged and beaten
almost beyond surviving there in
Europe and Asia. It is up to us to
provide them a new home, a fane
for their worship, a sheltering ca
thedral over them," be declared.
At the Friday afternoon session,
Frederic Spiegelherg, lecturer in
the School of Humanities, spoke on
the Japanese mind. He stated that
the Japanese have a psychological
weapon, Bushido. Bushido includes
an inferiority complex that ac
counts for the anonymity of their
actions, a lack of individuality,
and the achievement of a highly
detached attitude toward life.
"This detachment leaves the
Japanese unable to distinguish
between good and evil . . .and
takes away the Vestraint of an in
dividual conscience."
"The Japanese thus possess in
their highest cultural heritage in
sights and practices that might give
them a dangerous psychological
weapon," he said. "But these prac
tices draw their entire meaning and
effort from the spiritual moods of
the high and subtle religious tra
dition."
He stated that the leaders are
making the mistake of trusting in
the efficiency of the Bushido methods

without at the same time catering to
j its spiritual background just as the
J Germans are instilling a strong
I "German" feeling without reference
to their cultural background.

"This method is bound to meet
with final disaster," he declared.
'The strong anti-militaristic feeling
that was prevalent and until recently
visible throughout Japan is the most
hopeful basis for a future coopera
tion of the Japanese people in the
coming world of peace," he con
cluded.
State Dominance
Lynn T. White, professor of his
tory, in discussing "The Seeds of
Totalitarianism," pointed to state
dominance and its development
in a group with a chosen-people
complex basing its membership on
some social or religious criterior,
such as anti-Negro, anti-Jewish,
anti-Catholic, or anti-union senti
ment. He also pointed out the de
velopment of a doctrine of the elite
—that tendency to divide the race
between rulers and those who ought
to be ruled.
A four-point program for the hu
manities in a war and post-war
world was then outlined by Waldo
G. Leland, director of the American
Council of Learned Societies.
IJole During War
During the war, humanities must
fulfill two aims," he said: "Mak
ing specific contributions toward
winning the war through supply
ing our military forces with vital
knowledge of the geography and
languages of strategic areas of the
world and by maintaining the in
tellectual life of the nation at a
high level."
In the post-war world, he said,
"the humanities must contribute
to international understanding
through the promotion and dif
fusion of all cultures and civiliza
tions, and strive for world-wide
intellectual freedom."
"Humanities service will reach a
peak in the work of restoration and
reconstruction that will follow the
war, but if they are to serve fully,
the teachers must reach an under
standing of the needs themselves and
their changing manifestations, and
they must know how to adapt what
they have to offer to the require

ments of the times," he concluded.
Post-War Program
A definite post-war program was j
established Friday night by Dr. G.
A. Borgese, of the University of I
Chicago, who advocated "Domoso- |
cialism" as the cornerstone of a Re
public of the World.
"Our society needs something
more than state capitalism adminis- j
tering social welfare, and something j
better than the unwieldly hybrid of j
j social democracy. The new society
' must be democratic, that is, coop
i erative socialism —with the liberty j
of the single man and groups articu- !
lated in the brotherhood of the '
whole, which is the Republic of the ;
! World."
Humanism, he said, must imply a
a religious spirit, open to all races i
and higher creeds. He branded Na
-1 zism and Fascism as outgrowths of
: the '"religion of pessimism."
General Education
Saturday morning David H. Ste
vens, director of the humanities of
the Rockefeller Foundation, stated
j how the humanities might better
serve the individual need through
systems of general education, liberal
colleges and graduate schools. "Be
cause change of values is constant,
the student should study changes,"
Ihe said. "The teacher should take
account of the chances to assimilate
and discard as well as to fit the work
i to the developing needs of the learn
; er."
"Humanities establishes order
within the individual and he comes
to possess values to live by as well
as to die for. He will develop for
himself not a career but a character,
and he will know his way in the
world of mind and spirit," he said in
describing the benefits of a study of
the humanities.
Kay Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
of Stanford, discussed environ
ment and its effect on a nation for
the development of cultures de
pending upon the natural re
sources available as analogous to
the development in the humani
ties. He said that studies of the
humanities can demonstrate their
values not only in human happi
ness hut also in advance, for the
trained and penetrating eye can
see false from true in government
and social phenomena and makes
advance more secure and rapid.
Re-orientation Need
Lewis Mumford, professor of hu
manities. gave the final speech of the
conference in which he stated that
this generation was characterized by
two deep-seated failures—a flight
from reality in the enjoyment of
pleasure and disbelief in the higher
lift of man, and the worship of the
created good in the form of the ma
chine, forgetting the creator.
"This is the time for a radical re
orientation in ideas, habits, impulses,
I and directives—such a change as
only a world in catastrophe could
i bring about and carry through," he
declared. "Humanities are not a
rainbow to give hope after the storm,
I but they are an integral part of the
war."
He said that every soldier be not
only armed with weapons but also
with a knowledge of the inheritance
of the past. "He will then be twice
armed and prepared for the even
tualities of defeat or victory, frus
l tration or fulfillment, death or life.
The valid reason for urging a more
| intense dedication to the humanities
j during the war is not merely in or
der that we can live better after the
! war but that we can fight better now
1 when we need fighters, and in gov
' ernment to bring the cool-headed
| tkill and unyielding vigilance of
| Socrates and Plato."
He emphasized the pressing need
. | of typing the future of humanities
| with the future of humanity itself.
He outlined the chief problem in the
post-war world as the need to for
get our belief that our life is a norm
for all civilization and that the hu
manities are not the special creation
of the Western civilizations, in our
attempts to plan and carry out an
[ effective peace.


LOUIS MUMFORD
''Our mission here is to lie intelli
gently self-critical of humanities. If
we can revitalize our whole approach
to the study of man, this conference
will he worthwhile," Dean John W,
Oodds of the School of Humanities
stated in his welcoming address to
the delegates to the Humanities Con
ference which was held here Friday
and Saturday.
A plea for educators to give their
students ."something to live for, to
fight for and to die for" was sounded
by Paul Green of the University of
North Carolina at the opening ses
sion. College and university profes
sors everywhere have filled their
students' minds with generalities and
dead discouragements, have misedu
cated them, and have made them un
fit to face the world they live in with
real imagination, inspiration, and
hope, Green charged in a paper pre
sented to the first annual conference
of the humanities.
