ALLIED H.Q., North Africa, May
9.â€”More than 400 American planes
made a pulverizing raid today on the
great Axis base at Palermo, Cicily, a
special communique announced to
night.
It was an all-American raid and
the greatest ever made by daylight
in this theater of the war.
Besides the fortresses, B-26 Ma
rauders and B-25 Mitchell medium
bombers escorted by P-38 Lightning
fighters made the raid, and crews
reported great damage inflicted in
the harbor area.
From their bases in Tunisia, the
planes streaked over the Sicily
Straits and on to the northwest coast
to attack the big Axis base.
The giant fortresses went over Pa
lermo at non with their escort.
