## Allies Take 50,000 Tunisian Prisoners 
### (By United Press 
ALLIED H.Q., North Africa, May
9â€”The Allies have taken 50,000 pris
oners in Tunisia since Friday, in
cluding the commander and rem
j nants of the famed 15th German tank
! division, a special communique an
j nounced tonight, as triumphant Al
i lied armies drove the enemy's sur
j vivors to the Cap Bon peninsula.
With the end of the Tunisian cam
! paign at hand, more than 400 Ameri
can planes roared over to Sicily, the
1 next stepping stone to Europe, in
j daylight today, and blasted the great
i port of Palermo, on the north coast.
(Gen. Henri Giraud said in a
! few days there would be no more
Germans in Africa and that shortly
1 the fortress of Europe itself would
be attacked.)
The Allied communique said the
Axis air forces appeared to have
j been withdrawn from the battle of
; Tunisia.
The 15th German tank division was
along with the 21st division, one of
! Rommel's proudest units, and fought
in every desert battle in the last two
years.
It surrendered fittingly to its old
foes, the 7th armoured division of
the British Eighth Army, which was
disclosed belatedly to have been
shifted from the southern front to
take part in the final smashing of
fensive on Tunis.

It was the first time in this war
that American troops have captured
German divisional commanders, and
; it was believed the biggest bag of
j German generals ever taken in a
[ single action, except for those cap
tured at Stalingrad.

' The special communique said that
j the American Second Corps was
1 mopping up in the area around Bi-
I zerte, where organized resistance
I ceased with the unconditional sur
render of 5,000 Germans this morn
; ing-
Earlier estimates said that some
j 50,000 Germans might reach Cap
Bon, but the special communique's
disclosure that 50,000 already have
! been captured made it likely the
' number would be far fewer.
