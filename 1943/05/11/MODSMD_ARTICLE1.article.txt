# Bailey, Fisher, Brand To Hold Panel Tonight
## 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
Professors Thomas A. Bailey, Carl
F. Brand, and Harold H. Fisher will
discuss the foreign policy of the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia tonight on the Tuesday Se
ries program at 7:30 in Memorial
Hall. Chairman of the symposium
will be Professor Ralph Lutz.
Professor Bailey, who will lead the
discussion on the foreign policy of
the United States, will attempt to
clarify the various policies outlined
by spokesmen for the government.
Isolationism Alive
He says, "According to recent
polls, about GO per cent of our people
favor some form of post-war organ
ization for peace and that at the
that we shall join one. But isolation
ism is by no means dead."
He points out that most of the 16
different foreign policies outlined for
the United States stem from the At
lantic Charter, which, significantly,
has never been formally ratified by
Congress.
Britain Needs Peace
Professor Brand, who will outline
certain essentials of Great Britain's
foreign policies in different parts of
the world, says:
"It is certain Britain needs peace.
A country that depends for its very
livelihood upon the exchange of
manufactured goods and service for
foodstuffs cannot have that steady
tlow interrupted and survive. This
knowledge has influenced British
statesmen to become advocates of
arbitration and conciliation."
He will discuss the support given
to Britain's foreign policies by po
litical parties and will relate these
policies to recent pronouncements of
statesmen on the problems of the
war as they have arisen.
Mutual Fears
Professor Fisher will cover such
recent Russian policies as the Polish
incident and Soviet territorial
claims. He says:
"The greatest of many obstacles
to the organization of peace is the
fear of the western powers that a
victorious Russia will dominate Eu
rope and threaten the rest of the
world, and the fear of Russia that
a victorious Anglo-American com
bination will try to set up some kind
of an anti-Russian federation of Eu
rope as a preliminary to a capitalist
crusade against the land of social
ism."
This symposium on foreign policies
will develop the ideas presented in
the symposium on "The War, a
Longer View" which was given last
tall. Tonight's speakers will state
the factual case in terms of leaders
and peoples.

the symposium on "The War, a
Longer View" which was given last
tall. Tonight's speakers will state
the factual case in terms of leaders
and peoples.


DR. THOMAS BAILEY
Professors Thomas A. Bailey, Carl
F. Brand, and Harold H. Fisher will
discuss the foreign policy of the
United States, Great Britain, and
Russia tonight on the Tuesday Se
ries program at 7:30 in Memorial
Hall. Chairman of the symposium
will be Professor Ralph Lutz.
Professor Bailey, who will lead the
discussion on the foreign policy of
the United States, will attempt to
clarify the various policies outlined
by spokesmen for the government.
Isolationism Alive
He says, "According to recent
polls, about GO per cent of our people
favor some form of post-war organ
ization for peace and that at the
that we shall join one. But isolation
ism is by no means dead."
He points out that most of the 16
different foreign policies outlined for
the United States stem from the At
lantic Charter, which, significantly,
has never been formally ratified by
Congress.
Britain Needs Peace
Professor Brand, who will outline
certain essentials of Great Britain's
foreign policies in different parts of
the world, says:
"It is certain Britain needs peace.
A country that depends for its very
livelihood upon the exchange of
manufactured goods and service for
foodstuffs cannot have that steady
tlow interrupted and survive. This
knowledge has influenced British
statesmen to become advocates of
arbitration and conciliation."
He will discuss the support given
to Britain's foreign policies by po
litical parties and will relate these
policies to recent pronouncements of
statesmen on the problems of the
war as they have arisen.
Mutual Fears
Professor Fisher will cover such
recent Russian policies as the Polish
incident and Soviet territorial
claims. He says:
"The greatest of many obstacles
to the organization of peace is the
fear of the western powers that a
victorious Russia will dominate Eu
rope and threaten the rest of the
world, and the fear of Russia that
a victorious Anglo-American com
bination will try to set up some kind
of an anti-Russian federation of Eu
rope as a preliminary to a capitalist
crusade against the land of social
ism."
This symposium on foreign policies
will develop the ideas presented in
the symposium on "The War, a
Longer View" which was given last
tall. Tonight's speakers will state
the factual case in terms of leaders
and peoples.
