### Ed Luce 
With Johnny Fulton the feature
attraction, Stanford's cindermen be
gan preps for Saturday's Big Meet
with California yesterday on Angell
Field.
Fulton,, who set a new American
record of 1:18.9 in the 660-yard run
Saturday at Los Angeles, arrived
back at Stanford by plane Sunday.
Johnny didn't find out he was to
run in a special 660 until Friday
morning, when he called up South

Follows Packard
The Stanford ace let George Pep
perdine College's Harrison Packard
lake the lead, figuring to try only to
beat (jut Packard in the last 220.
Packard ripped off the first 440 in
:50.5 with Fulton right behind.
About 100 yards from the fiiflsh,
Johnny turned on his kick and won
easily by about 35 yards.
Fulton told us he first thought he
would try and stay in front the
whole race, but after he had been
told a few times how good the Pep
perdine runner was supposed to be,
decided to just run to win.
Takes Third Lane
Philo Chambers. Fulton's coach at
Los Angeles high school, was the
first to tell Johnny of his new rec
ord. Fuiton hadn't run the 660 in
competition since he was a sopho
more in high school.
