# SENIOR BALL
## Juniors Invited To '43 Dance 
### 
The annual Senior Ball will be
held this year June 11. Juniors will
be invited, and the dance committee
is anxious to know approximately
how many seniors and juniors are
planning to attend. This information
must be obtained before arrange
ments can be completed.
The ball will be held from 11 to 4,
with a breakfast of non-rationed food
being served from 2 to 4. It will be
a night of fun for everyone, well
worth waiting two days after finals
for, according to George Hellyer, co
chairman of the dance committee.
The juniors are urged to attend,
because they may be unable to have
a ball of their own next year.
The committees for the Ball have
been appointed and are ready to go
ahead with their plans as soon as
they receive some idea of how many
seniors and juniors will be at the
dance. The committees, headed by
Barbara Sadler and George Hellyer,
co-chairmen, are:
Ann Byington and Ralph Schaff
arzlek, decorations; Moofie Faris and
Joan Hill, refreshments; Shelly Par
ker, orchestra; Jim Bentley, police;
Betty Derrah and John Jensen,
patrons; and A1 Hampson, publicity.
