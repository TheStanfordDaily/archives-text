Mrs. Barthemus of the American j
Association of University Women j
spoke on the advantages and require- j
merits from membership in that or
ganization at the meeting of Women's
Conference yesterday. She empha
sized for the benefit of graduating
seniors, that the group was primarily
a good way to become acquainted j
with college women in a community.
"Although the group is a national
association, most of its functions are j
carried on in the local sections, i
which consist of pleasure groups,
hobby groups and more serious dis
cussion groups," she said. Fees for
membership vary with the local
group, and the applicants must have
attended an accredited school. She
must be a college graduate to be an
active member, but may enjoy the
privileges of the group as an asso
ciate member after having completed
two years of college. This year the
state board is granting membership
for one year to three outstanding
senior women from each accredited
college in California.
In regard to the selection of these |
three girls, Catherine Connaghan,
chairman of Women's Conference, <
asked that nominations be made by j
the seniors in each living group and
elections will be held next week.
