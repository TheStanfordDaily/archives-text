# SPRING SHOW
## Crew Adorns Olio Costumes With Ruffles 
### 
Paula Kanner, mistress of costumes
for the Spring Show, playing Friday
and Saturday nights in Memorial
Theater, has been living in a maize
of ruffles for the last few weeks.
Both the melodrama, "No Mother
to Guide Her," and the olios demand
yards of ruffles to adorn the gay
nineties costumes worn by the belles
of the cast, she explained.
Anne Simons is assisting Miss
Kanner with the making of the cos
tumes, and Betty Wattenberger is
working under her outfitting the cast
of the emotionally complicated melo
drama.
Altogether, the costume crew has
made about 35 costumes, ranging
from garish can-can numbers to loud
checked and striped suits for the
male performers.
Last night, two of the "bathing
beauties" faking part, in an olio en
titled "Splash Me," visited various
living groups during dinner, exhibit
ing their bathing suits reminiscent
of the 1890's.
"The finale will be a symphony in
pastel colors,"' Miss Kanner said.
Tickets for the program billing "No
Mother to Guide Her" with 20 olio
acts will be on sale this week in the
A.S.S.U. office from 9 to 12 and from
1 until 5. Prices are Si.lo, 75 cents,
and 55 cents.
