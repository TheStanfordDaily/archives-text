# On Ickes and Hearst
## 
### 
THE San Francisco Examiner ran a full page editorial with
three pictures against Secretary of the Interior Ickes and his
act of having Japanese labor on his farm. This is poor, almost
shameful, for a number of reasons. The very headlines that
denounce Ickes and the Japanese question what we are fighting.
Many of the Japanese who have been relocated are Ameri
can citizens with an honest love for the United States. The
broad generalizations which class all Japanese as having
"Treachery, Loyalty to Emperor, Inherent Japanese Traits" are
untrue. In Hawaii today the Japanese are not interned and
.the evacuation of Honolulu was managed by a Japanese.
Ickes is one of the men at the helm of the government.
Whether or not we like him, whether or not we approve of his
policies, has little to do with the Examiner's editorial. We
should not blandly call Ickes "our Jap-doting secretary of the
interior" and refer to his farm as "Mr. Ickes' PRIVATE UNITED
STATES."
Besides these faults, the interview with Frederick T.
Woodman, chairman of the Problems Committee of the Pa
cific League, does nothing but further complicate the already
difficult job of handling the Japanese after the war.
In an honest thinking newspaper there is no place for
such a display as this. There is no excuse for such a man as
Frederick T. Woodman condensing so much hate into one short
nterview with a Hearst paper.
"We should not have the Japanese in this country after the
war!
"I mean Japaneseâ€”whether born here or in Japan.
"It has been my experience that the Japanese cannot be
trusted.
"They show no disposition to express loyalty by action to
the United States."
With such statements as these ringing in the ears of the
American newspaper reader we can surely hope for a just set
tlement after the war and kind treatment for Americans during
the war.
Although "Truth-Justice" heads the Examiner editorial page,
it has betrayed American journalism and prostituted itself for
politics.
