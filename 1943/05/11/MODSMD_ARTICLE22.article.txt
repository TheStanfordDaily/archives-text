For the magnificence of the chapel and the greatness of the
University, the run of guest speakers in Memorial Church has
been not only inferior, but insulting of the intellectual standards
this institution would be expected to maintain.
For those who have long endured the poverty of inspiration
and the barrage of Victorian rhetoric—of guest speakers—, it
was a double gratification that the speaker last Sunday should
have been Rabbi Irving Reichert.
Offhand, I can recall only two other addresses in the past
year—by guest speakers—worthy of Stanford and Stanford's
chapel, and those two happen to have been baccalaureate ser
mons ... by Chancellor Wilbur last March, and Lynn White Sr.,
last June.
Suppose we make a brief observation of these outstanding
sermons in comparison with the average of the others, not for the
purpose of sacrilege, as inevitably will be charged, but as a
possible basis for steps toward a minor Reformation. Since Dr.
Wilbur's manner of address is already familiar, and since it might
be best to keep the discussion pointedly confined to the
preaching profession, let us omit the Chancellor's baccalaureate.
Rabbi Reichert, for one thing, had not the affected pronun
ciations and ascending drone with which congregations are so
often assaulted. But the great difference was organization. For
the singular failing of sermons in Memorial Church is organiza
tion. A series of unrelated aphorisms and quotations do not make
a sermon, however impressive the individual parts.
Dr. White is a mellow sage who has not lost his sense of
humor. His address was a rare instance in which the speaker did
i;ot have as an underlying theme the defensive attempt to con
vince his audience that what they believed was wrong, or that
it could be reconciled to something else.
