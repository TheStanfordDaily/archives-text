# Two Stanford Men Stage Dramatic Ocean Rescue
## 
### Sallie Van Dyke 
Bob Brown and Bob McClean, Stanford students, swam through 200
[ yards of very rough surf off San Gregoria beach Sunday afternoon to
| rescue Henry Kind, a radioman, from a Coast Guard plane which had
| crashed into the ocean.
A group of Stanford students were having a picnic and enjoying the sun

when they saw several planes skim
the water nearby. They all gained
altitude except one. which flipped ,
over as it hit an air pocket and j
crashed into the water. According to ;
McClean it "stalled and hit the |
water rather suddenly."
Rough Ocean
Immediately several of the men |
plunged into the surf and attempted j
to battle their way to the plane. ,
However, the ocean was so rough ]
and the waves were so high that I
Brown and McClean were the only
two that succeeded in reaching the
plane.
Brown, a Deke freshman from
Burlingame, said he and McClean,
an Alpha Delt, reached the wreck
age after swimming through rough
seas for about 10 minutes. They
found the radioman floating upright
in the water, seriously injured but
kept afloat by an inflated life jacket.
They looked in vain for the pilot,
whose identity has not been re
vealed. Kind said that the pilot had
probably been pinned in the cabin
and killed when the plane hit the :
water.
Radioman Injured
The swimmers brought Kind to !
shore, where he was turned over to
Coast Guard authoirties for treat- j
ment. Both his legs were broken j
and he had other injuries from the |
impact of the crash.
It was the pilot's last patrol flight j
before being transferred to another
station.
The Navy and Army retrieved one j
I wing and the fuselage of the plane. I
' However, they are still searching for j
the pilot's body, the other wing, a j
missing engine, and demolition j
; bombs believed to have been on the j
: plane.
Brown is a shortstop on the Stan- j
ford varsity baseball team and is j
Red Cross junior life saver. Mc- ,
Clean is a senior student from Los j
Angeles and is a Red Cross senior !
life saver.

Bob Brown and Bob McClean, Stanford students, swam through 200
[ yards of very rough surf off San Gregoria beach Sunday afternoon to
| rescue Henry Kind, a radioman, from a Coast Guard plane which had
| crashed into the ocean.
A group of Stanford students were having a picnic and enjoying the sun

when they saw several planes skim
the water nearby. They all gained
altitude except one. which flipped ,
over as it hit an air pocket and j
crashed into the water. According to ;
McClean it "stalled and hit the |
water rather suddenly."
Rough Ocean
Immediately several of the men |
plunged into the surf and attempted j
to battle their way to the plane. ,
However, the ocean was so rough ]
and the waves were so high that I
Brown and McClean were the only
two that succeeded in reaching the
plane.

Burlingame, said he and McClean,
