# Seniors Asked To Register
## 
### 
Declaring that the demand exceeds
the supply, Miss Ruth Tracksell of
the Appointment Service in the Ad
building urges senior women who are
interested in employment after
graduation to register in her office as
soon as possible.
Many firms in the Bay Area have
sent requests to her office for college
women, more than are now available.
Although some of the positions to be
filled require special training, a
number of them are open to women
with a general education and ability
to learn, according to Miss Tracksell.
Representing the Sacramento Air
Depot, Miss Janet Clark will be on
the campus Thursday to interview
women interested in working in pro
duction control of maintenance and
supply. Appointments to see her may
be made through Miss Tracksell.
Columbia Steel Co. in San Fran
cisco has indicated it will send a man
to the campus to interview women
for positions as junior accountants,
industrial engineers, production
planners, and position analysts if
enough women indicate an interest
in hearing more about these jobs.
