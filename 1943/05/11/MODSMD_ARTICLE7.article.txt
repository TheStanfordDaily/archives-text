# Barbecue To Use Chicken
## 
### 
Despite rationing, the traditional
barbecue following Labor Day at the
Convalescent Home will be held as a
reward for those students who spend
the afternoon working, according to
Tink Downey, chairman of the La
bor Day barbecue.
"This will be different from other
barbecues," Miss Downey explained,
as she said chicken and noodles
would be substituted for the usual,
now-rationed meat; "But it will be
just as good."
No meals will be on Wednesday of
the Convalescent Home Drive next
week.
"Anyone wanting to eat that night
had better work at the Home in the
afternoon," the chairman said.
The "barbecue" will be served as
soon as the required work is done.
Helen Beatty is in charge of col
lecting sandwiches, also on the menu,
from the sorority houses. All per
sons in other living groups will pay
25 cents, Miss Downey said.
Bill Eberle is arranging entertain
ment to take place during the meal,
Vic Ferrari is in charge of hauling
and setting up tables, and Euna Mc-
Cullers is in charge of equipment
for the meal.
"Twenty beautiful freshman girls
will serve the food," Miss Downey
commented.
The barbecue and Labor Day are
a part of the Annual Convalescent
Home Drive for the benefit of the
kiddies.
