# Spiegelberg Leads Discussion on India
## 
### 
Dr. Frederic Spiegelberg, lecturer
in religion, led the informal dis
cussion on "Understanding and Mis
understanding India" yesterday at
4:15 in the *'Y" rooms, top floor of
the Women's Clubhouse.
Dr. Spiegelberg spoke of the dif
ficulties which the people here have
in trying to understand India be
cause of the actual differences in
characters of the inhabitants of the
two countries. He used the com
parison of the ideas of time to illus
trate these variations.
"The American thinks of time as
a river flowing from the future to
the past while the Indian considers
time a circle which continually re
volves,' said Dr. Spiegelberg,
The American idea is exemplified
in the words, "opportunity knocks
but once,' but the Indian believes
that what is not done today can be
done tomorrow just as well," he
added.
This and other differences in the
basic approaches toward life of the
eastern and western cultures must
be acknowledged and accepted, ac
cording to Dr. Spiegelberg, before
any real understanding of India can
be attained.
