# Schwartz To Take Model 'T' On Test Run With Sea Lions
## 
### Late Williams 
Gome Saturday, and Marchie Schwartz will send this year's model of the
l 'T" into action against the strong Coast Guard Sea Lions eleven. The
game is scheduled to begin at 2:150 on the varsity practice field, but whether
or not it will be a strictly regulation football game, remains to be seen.
Schwartz indicated that the contest will merely be a high class fracas

with the kick-offs eliminated, and
coaches roaring on and off the field
with regularity. However, the game
will go far in indicating just what
kind of squad the Cards will field
come Septemberâ€”if anybody fields
a squad.
Lieut. Joe Verducci's Sea Lions
already have one game under their
belts this season, defeating Cal by
a 14-0 count.
Former Stars
Verducci has a team that is stud
ded with former grid greats includ
ing Gonzales Morales, who was the
sensation* of the St. Mary's team of
last year; Dale Halpert and Quentin
Greenough, who were on the Oregon
State eleven that defeated Duke in
the transplanted Rose Bowl game of
15)42; and Fred Shew, gigantic former
U.S.F. back.
On the Stanford side of the ledger,
it looks like a veteran backfield com
bining with a partially inexperienced
line.
At the key quarterback position,
it looks like Bom Andrews will be
the starter. Behind Andrews are Bill
Gulley and Ted Kenfield. Kenfield
has a bad blister on his heel, but this
should not keep him out of the game.
At halves, Schwartz has three vet
erans to choose from, "Rock" Shel
ler, Don Zappettini, and Ross Dana.
All of these men saw a lot of action
last year, and all three look good in
practice. The starting two remain
to be seen.
Backfield Material
At the fullback spot, Ben Morri
son looks like the choice, however if
the doctor gives Buck Fawcett the
green signal, the latter will undoubt
edly be the choice. Fawcett is nurs
ing a bad leg that he got in rugby,
and has been unable to attend spring
practice.
Add to these men others such as
Dave Pate, Dick Munroe, and Jack
Bariscena, and you have plenty of
of backfield material.
In the line are returning letter
men Jim Cox, Harvey Bernard, Bill
Young, Bob Hall, and Dave Brown.
Cox is a sure thing for a starting
tackle position, while Dick Peal will
be his other tackle mate.
As guards, Young and Bernhard
have the edge over Dick Madigan,
Bob McClean, and Jack Samson,
while ends Hall and Brown, both of
whom were counted upon heavily
last fall, will pair up.
l T se Entire Squad
Tyler Norton has been looking
well in practice, and will probably
be the choice over Bob Young and
Don Weaver.
The choice of an opening lineup is
useless in as far as who will play in
the game.
During the last week, Schwartz
has been sending the team through
dummy drills combined with actual
intrasquad scrimmages. These are
mostly for the purpose of acquaint
ing the newcomers to the formations
and various plays of the "T". On
Fridays the whole squad takes a
turn around the obstacle course to
toughen them up.
