## Zetes Defeat Theta Chi's, 5-1 
### 
It was a big day in (he intramural
softball program yesterday—at least
big as far as the Zetes were con
i cerned. Thes combined a combina
tion of a tight infield, and a few op
! ponents' outfield errors to topple
Theta Chi from the ranks of the un
defeated, 5-1.
Harry Booth gave about three hits
|to the Zetes over a seven-inning
j stretch, while John Eikelman scat
i tered five hits for the victors.
Chi Psi's
Chi Psi, the up and down team of
the league, happened to be up when
| they sent the Phi Psi's home with
lan 8-4 loss. Chi Psi's Bob "Smoke"
i Morrison had to depend on pitching
| alone for the first four innings of the
i game, as he had only six players be
j hind him.
When the rest of the team showed,
however, he was able to relax a
| little—not much, but a little. "Rock"
Sheller pitched great ball for the
i losers, and it was only because of a
few holes in the infield and outfield
that he kept getting in trouble.
It finally happened—the Sigma Nu
j nine won a game. It was the Alpha
i Delt team that proved to be the vic
tim, 7-6., in the twilight affair. Sig
ma Nu had two men down in the last
|of the fifth, the final inning of the
; game, and men on second and third.
Alien Scores
Bill Allen, who has not gained a
respectable hit all season, proceeded
to lay into the three and two pitch
for a double, winning the game. Big
Jim Buckingham hurled for the
winners, while Jim Thomas was
charged with the defeat.
D.U. put down a last-inning eight
run rally by the Chem team in time
to squeeze out a 14-10 win, while
S.A.E. was doing the reverse proce
dure in winning 5-4 over Kappa Sig.
I In the final contest that was re
ported, Sigma Chi fell victim to the
Dekes, 14-5. Jim Gault was the los
ing pitcher, and Jack Clark the win
ner.
