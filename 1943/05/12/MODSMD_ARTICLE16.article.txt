## Crew Disbands Due to Injuries 
### Irma Cunha 
A final stroke of bad luck hit the
Stafford Varsity crew when two
oarsmen were injured, making it
necessary for Stanford to withdraw
from the Pacific Coast Regatta this
Saturday in which Stanford oarsmen
were going to compete in a three
mile pull against Cal and Washing
ton.
Although it looks as if crew is of
ficially through for the duration, all
three Stanford crews, the Varsity.
Jayvee, and Frosh shells will hold
their usual end-of-season banquet
next Wednesday and elect a new
president to succeed Bud Clary.
Stanford's oarsmen are also hop
ing to be able to buy a one-year
old shell from Sacramento Junior
College to store away with their four
shells, all of which are between 14
and 30 years old. The new shell will
have a new type of rigger that makes
the going a lot easier when the wa
ter's rough, and the oarsmen plan
to put this same type of rigger on the
old shells. Right now the crew is
working to get the shells and boat
house in order and ready to go for
the next seasonâ€”whenever that may
be.
All things being equal, and cancel
ing out the war, the Stanford oars
men would be experienced the next
time it was ripe to get the shells
afloat. Counting all three shells, only
six oarsmen are graduating, plus
Cox Walt Drake.
Rowing in Stanford's Varsity shell
were Bud Clary, Ken Young, John
Wise, Welko Gasich, Burt Avery.
Tony Medved, Ned Gates, Paul
Schute, and as cox, Walt Drake.
In the Jayvee boat were Ed Fagan,
Jack Hauser, Bob Niebel, Dick Bul
lis, Charles Haines, Jack Sogorka,
Joe Welsh, Hal Hopper, and Cox Ann
Ashley.
The Frosh shell was accelerated by
Stan Cumberpatch, Hoyt Leisure,
George Pratt, Paul Egeler, John
Hippen, Norman Schieber, Bill Da
vidson, Bob Phillips, and Cox Oliver
Andrews.
