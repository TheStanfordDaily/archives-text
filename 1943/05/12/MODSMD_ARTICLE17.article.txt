# Entrants Named For Track Meet
## 
### 
Declaring that there was not much
use trying to keep it secret, track
Coach Pitch Johnson yesterday re
leased a tentative entry list for Sat
urday's Big Meet with California at
Edwards Field, Berkeley.
It's not official, but from the list
it looks as if Stanford's top track
ster, Johnny Fulton, will run the 220,
440, and the anchor lap on the relay
quarter. Johnny's name is listed in
the 880 column too. but the Card
ace would probably score more
points in the 220 and 440, than in the
100 and 880.
Should either Hal Davis or Grover
Klemmer choose to enter the quar
ter, that race would automatically
become the feature of the day's fes
tivities.
There were no other changes in
Johnson's list, except that Bruce
Meyer, star Indian quarter-miler,
out most of the year with a pulled
leg muscle, will run in the 440.
