# The 						Crew Is Dead: Long Live the Crew

### 
SATURDAY the Pacific Coast regatta will be held on the
Oakland estuary. The Stanford Crew will not be repre
sented. A sprained knee, a hernia, and no replacements have
made it impossible for our crew to participate.
Crew is over for the duration. Now is a good time to take
stock of what we have and to lay plans for the future. In years
past Stanford was a great crew school. It is not impossible to
conceive of it again being ranked with Cal, Washington, and
Columbia. The crew has been a success these last two years
largely because of the efforts of a few boys who have spent
their time, energy and money for the crew. They built a row
ing barge, a boat house. They begged equipment and made
plans. It is they who made crew a success.
Now that crew is through, let us hope that Stanford will
become a great crew school.
