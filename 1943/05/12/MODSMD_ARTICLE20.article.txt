### CYCLONE COVEY 
The dramatic rescue of a radioman whose plane crashed off
San Gregorio beach Sunday recalls to mind a slightly different
catastrophe which involved a slightly different type of heroism,
during the inter-guarter vacation between Summer and Autumn
last fall.
Ray Smith, Ed Edwin (both now in the Army), and Pete
Manson (one foot in) motored to Half Moon Bay—to play a thrill
ing game of three-cornered catch on the beach with a beanbag.
The game was just underway when three other athletes—
who, by the way their veins were so conspicuous, were as
sumed to be Cal men—came over from the upper beach to join
the game of skill. And then a female scream rent the air, and the
six men looked out to sea to see a classic case of a lady in distress.
They had not argued five minutes about the Junior Red Cross
standard holds, before five of the six had jumped in at once,
leaving Edwin holding the bag.

But Smith hit his head on a sandbar in his eagerness; and
Edwin had to pull him out feet first, dragging his face under
water, and give him artificial respiration.
Smith came to fast and heard the scream again. He and
Edwin straightway jumped in together. But two of the Cal men
had got caught in the undertow, and Smith and Edwin had to
rescue them and commence applying artificial respiration. Smith
was still a little weak; so he and his man took turns giving each
other artificial respiration.

Manson, meanwhile, was the only one to make it out to the
region whence the screaming had come. Tossed wildly about by
the waves, he was confronted by a shark. Manson looked him in
the eye and said, "Don't tell me you've been making all this
noise." The shark, apparently full, did not attack Manson but
turned away and. headed back toward Australia, wagging its tail
behind him (for it was a tiger shark).

Soon the monstrous waves washed Manson ashore, where
he found the other Cal man already washed up. Manson gave
him artificial respiration for several hours, then fell exhausted;
whereupon the Cal man came to and gave Manson artificial
respiration, but soon collapsed, and Manson took his turn again.
All six have been breathing steadily since. But they often
wonder what became of the woman who disappeared.

The dramatic rescue of a radioman whose plane crashed off
San Gregorio beach Sunday recalls to mind a slightly different
catastrophe which involved a slightly different type of heroism,
during the inter-guarter vacation between Summer and Autumn
last fall.
Ray Smith, Ed Edwin (both now in the Army), and Pete
Manson (one foot in) motored to Half Moon Bay—to play a thrill
ing game of three-cornered catch on the beach with a beanbag.
The game was just underway when three other athletes—
who, by the way their veins were so conspicuous, were as
sumed to be Cal men—came over from the upper beach to join
the game of skill. And then a female scream rent the air, and the
six men looked out to sea to see a classic case of a lady in distress.
They had not argued five minutes about the Junior Red Cross
standard holds, before five of the six had jumped in at once,
leaving Edwin holding the bag.

But Smith hit his head on a sandbar in his eagerness; and
Edwin had to pull him out feet first, dragging his face under
water, and give him artificial respiration.
Smith came to fast and heard the scream again. He and
Edwin straightway jumped in together. But two of the Cal men
had got caught in the undertow, and Smith and Edwin had to
rescue them and commence applying artificial respiration. Smith
was still a little weak; so he and his man took turns giving each
other artificial respiration.

Manson, meanwhile, was the only one to make it out to the
region whence the screaming had come. Tossed wildly about by
the waves, he was confronted by a shark. Manson looked him in
the eye and said, "Don't tell me you've been making all this
noise." The shark, apparently full, did not attack Manson but
turned away and. headed back toward Australia, wagging its tail
behind him (for it was a tiger shark).

Soon the monstrous waves washed Manson ashore, where
he found the other Cal man already washed up. Manson gave
him artificial respiration for several hours, then fell exhausted;
whereupon the Cal man came to and gave Manson artificial
respiration, but soon collapsed, and Manson took his turn again.
All six have been breathing steadily since. But they often
wonder what became of the woman who disappeared.
