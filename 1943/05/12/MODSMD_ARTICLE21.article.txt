# Campus Opinion

Eyes, along with everything else during wartime, are more
important. For three years, I, along with innumerable others,
have groped my way in and out of the Stanford libraries. My
doctor now assures me I am going blind.
I am convinced it is due to the inexcusable lack of lighting
of the libraries on the campus with the most "modern and health
ful facilities on the Coast." I have even tried vitamin A. Now
I'm making a last appeal. Should I stay in the confusion of my
living group and not do my outside reading but have the advan
tage of precious light, or should I go to the peaceful quiet and
darkness of the library. I'm baffled. Progressive Myopia
