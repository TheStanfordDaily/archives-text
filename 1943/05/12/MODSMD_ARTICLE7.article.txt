# Senior Alumni Membership Drive Begins
## 
### Vickie Sellens 
This year's alumni drive will begin
today when representatives of all
the living groups on campus will
meet with seniors to urge them to
join the alumni association and re
tain their contacts with Stanford
throughout the years after they
leave the University, according to
Robert "Bones" Hamilton, alumni
director.
Each year the officers of the senior
class conduct a drive to explain to
their classmates the functions of the
alumni association and the advan
tages which they will derive from
maintaining a life membership in it.
Information Blanks
Each living group representative is
equipped with blanks for filling out
information regarding the senior's
probable plans for the future and is
prepared to accept payment of dues
in the Alumni Association.
For seniors the dues for life mem
bership are $50, while for alumni the
dues are $60. These amounts may be
paid either in one lump sum or in an
$11 down payment and five yearly
paymnets of $11 each for alumni,
or $5 down and $10 for five years for
seniors.
Alumni File
The University keeps on file an
up-to-date record of the where
abouts, the occupation, the marital
status, and other pertinent data
about every alumnus. This informa-

tion is valuable in arranging contacts
between business firms and former
students, as well as making it pos
sible for friends to get in touch with ;
former classmates through the Uni
versity.
The information filed by the repre- I
sentatives who will speak to their J
living groups between today and j
Friday will be the beginning of the
permanent record for the seniors of I
this year.
Purposes
In some instances, especially for
the men students, information will
also be filed concerning students
who would ordinarily graduate two
or three quarters after this June.
This adjustment is being made es
pecially to accommodate those stu
dents who are being drafted.
One of the main purposes of the
Alumni Association, according to
Mr. Hamilton, is to see that the
alumni out in the world are as well
prepared as possible to be good sales- |
men for their Alma Mater, because !
the standards of Stanford, like those !
of any university, are based to a j
great extent upon the reputation j
which it gains from public comment.
