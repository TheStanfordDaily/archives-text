## 
### 
WASHINGTON. May 11 (UP) —Prime Minister Winston Churchill is here
for another war conference with President Roosevelt, the White House
disclosed tonight. The conference was presumably to draw plans for a
second front invasion of Europe and possibly a Pacific offensive.
Churchill arrived early this evening.
The White House did not reveal the purpose of the visit, but it did say

''that Churchill was accompanied by
a "staff of experts, military and
naval," hence it appeared that the
latest parley would deal with the
next moves in the Allied offensive
against the Axis.
! Casablanca Conference
Churchill and Mr. Roosevelt las'
; met in January at Casablanca when
they blueprinted the "'unconditional
I surrender" of the Axis.
There was speculation that the?
; not only would review previousK
| plotted military moves in the ligh,
j of the Allied victory in Tunisia but
| 'would look beyond—to post-war
I problems.
Lord Keaverbrook
The White House did not nanu
the experts immediately, but a Lon
don dispatch said Lord Beaverbrook
1 former British Minister of Suppl;
and staunch advocate of a secon
; front, was among them. Others wei
| presumed to include high Army an
| Navy officers.
The White House did not indicat
the mode of Churchill's transporta-
I tion, nor were there any details o
| his arrival except that he had bee
met by Mr. Roosevelt. On his tw
• previous visits in December 1941 am
last June he flew across the Atlantic.
Maybe Supreme Commiyider
London reports suggested that one
,of the results of the new meeting
| may be the appointment of a su-
I preme Allied commander for the
j European theater and speculation
! here was that Gen. George C. Mar
: shall, U.S. Chief ol Staff, is the most
likely candidate. The same reports
said there is a possibility that Gen.
Dwight D. Eisenhower, supreme Al
lied commander in North Africa will
return to Washington.
The White House did not say
whether Russian premier Joseph
Stalin had been invited to the latest
: conference.
BRITISH CUT OFF
CAP BON PENINSULA
, ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, No
Africa. May 11 (UP) —All organized
Axis resistance ended on Cap Bor
today when British tanks sealed off
the peninsula and German troop>
in the Zaugun sector to the south
asked the French for an armistice.
The British captured Hammamet
j at the southeastern end of the base
! of the peninsula to divide the sur
i viving Axis armies and swept on up
! the east coast for 18 miles, front
| dispatches reported.
Strong enemy forces trapped near
the coast below the peninsula were
reported still battling fiercely. But
they were under heavy pressure
from the British First Army on the
north and the Eighth Army on the
south, while the request for an
j armistice on the Saugun sector sig
| nified their western flank had crum
! bled.
