# Allies' Foreign Policies Discussed by Professors
## 
### Bernadette Giannini 
Study of the foreign policies of the
United Nations indicate that they
are primarily concerned with se
curity for themselves; this and the
problems that arise in following
these policies were discussed by
Professors Thomas A. Bailey, Carl
F. Brand and Harold H. Fisher for
the Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence last night.
Dr. Fisher declared that Winston
Churchill was correct in declaring
the Russian policy "a riddle wrapped
in a mystery inside an enigma."

However, he found that certain
trends could be followed by study
ing their declarations on foreign pol
icy, and actually considering their
actions to date.
linked States' Policy
Dr. Bailey said the policy of the
United States is just as obscure and
that "for 20 years all that the people
of Europe have known, is that what
they can count on the United States
for, is not being able to count on the
United States."
Great Britain's policy, according
to Professor Brand, is to maintain
the freedom of the lowlands and
vital points of their empire territo
ries that they believe essential to
their own security.
"They realize that the reason they
are not being bombed by Nazis is
because Russia is being bombed by
Nazis. They are now very much
more reconciled "to live in the same
world with socialist Russia."
Atlantic Charter
"The United States, however, still
is not ready to live with Russia,"
said Professor Bailey. The govern
ment follows roughly 13 different
points on foreign policy and post
war organization, as declared by the
President, Secretary of State Hull,
and the Senate at various times.
The ones declared most often are
summed up in the Atlantic Charter
which has been ratified by the House
of Commons and the Supreme Soviet
of the U.S.S.R. but not by the United
States Senate.
Mr. Bailey declared that the Uni
ted States would have to give up
some of its sovereign lights to effect
a sound post-war organization, and
will have to participate in such an
organization to make a peace plan
successful. He said we would have
to sacrifice now as we did in 1787,
that doing it "would not mean a
permanent peace for sure, but fail
ure to do it will mean another war
for sure."
