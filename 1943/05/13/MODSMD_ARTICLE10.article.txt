# Bi-weekly Paper Published by Campus Cub Scouts
## 
### 
Sixth-grader David Beadle, edi
tor of the "Junior Citizen," warned
in a plea for staff recruits . . . '"It'll
be work, and no tea party!" David
v:ho has his hands full meeting
newspaper deadlines and going to
school, knows.
The "Citizen" is an independent
newspaper founded in 11)43 and
published bi-weekly by and for
Cub Scouts.
Staff of 10
The paper began with a staff of
10, much enthusiasm and this well
defined policy. "We thought there
ought to be a free press, edited by
boys and girls. Most school and
organization papers are under di
rect control of adults who select
the material that goes into the
paper and it is written the way
grown-ups want it. At present we
have a grown-up printers devil to
help us with our mechanical prob
lem."
'Tlie 'printers devil' is David's
mother who hectographs the paper
but never corrects spelling or
grammar.)
'Gripes, Crouches and Growls'
Never wore higher ideal ex
pressed than in the policies set
forth by these Cub Scout journal
ists. "The purpose of a free press
is to give the people a chance to
say what they want to and get all
the gripes, grouches and growls
out of their systems. Another pur
pose is to give people the good side
of life. Our aims are to give the
news without featuring the worst
side of life, to get letters from for

mcr campus schol pupils and ex
change ideas with other junior
papers and magazines. Any money
over expenses w.ill be contributed
to the Pack 5
"The Growler" a column pat
terned on The Prowler (Palo Alto
Times), is the medium through
which Editor Beadle talks to his
Cub subscribers and through which
the "gripes, grouches and growls"
are released.
Growler Comments
Says the Growler . . . "The Stan
ford students on campus are get
ting so that they never obey the
signs of the Traffic Boys and don't,
even stop for the permanent STOP
signs. They used to wait patiently,
or impatiently, and then drive on
but now it's getting to be a menace
to the children of the Campus
School." A word to the wise. . . .
Advertising Too

Turner, Toddy Moar, Olavi Hosti
are contributors to the paper. Bus
iness Manager Bob Demson has
managed to secure a full-page ad

News of each Den in the Stan
ford area is contributed by a Den

Business" editor, is good future

Says the Growler . . . "The Stan
ford students on campus are get
ting so that they never obey the
signs of the Traffic Boys and don't,
even stop for the permanent STOP
signs. They used to wait patiently,
or impatiently, and then drive on
but now it's getting to be a menace
to the children of the Campus
School." A word to the wise. . . .

EDITOR AND PUBLISHER David Beadle of the "Junior Citizen" is shown above at left, discussing edi
torial policy with some of the young members of his reading audience. Staff of the paper is composed of
members of the Cub Scout packs at the Campus School, who publish the paper uithout any adult assistance
except in the hectographing of the paper.
Sixth-grader David Beadle, edi
tor of the "Junior Citizen," warned
in a plea for staff recruits . . . '"It'll
be work, and no tea party!" David
v:ho has his hands full meeting
newspaper deadlines and going to
school, knows.
The "Citizen" is an independent
newspaper founded in 11)43 and
published bi-weekly by and for
Cub Scouts.
Staff of 10
The paper began with a staff of
10, much enthusiasm and this well
defined policy. "We thought there
ought to be a free press, edited by
boys and girls. Most school and
organization papers are under di
rect control of adults who select
the material that goes into the
paper and it is written the way
grown-ups want it. At present we
have a grown-up printers devil to
help us with our mechanical prob
lem."
'Tlie 'printers devil' is David's
mother who hectographs the paper
but never corrects spelling or
grammar.)
'Gripes, Crouches and Growls'
Never wore higher ideal ex
pressed than in the policies set
forth by these Cub Scout journal
ists. "The purpose of a free press
is to give the people a chance to
say what they want to and get all
the gripes, grouches and growls
out of their systems. Another pur
pose is to give people the good side
of life. Our aims are to give the
news without featuring the worst
side of life, to get letters from for

mcr campus schol pupils and ex
change ideas with other junior
papers and magazines. Any money
over expenses w.ill be contributed
to the Pack 5
"The Growler" a column pat
terned on The Prowler (Palo Alto
Times), is the medium through
which Editor Beadle talks to his
Cub subscribers and through which
the "gripes, grouches and growls"
are released.
