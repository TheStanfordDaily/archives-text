# Cardinals Change Dates For Con Home Program
## 
### 
; Rearranging the calendar for Con
j valescent Home drive next week,
Cardinals met Tuesday night and
I made final plans for the annual char
ity drive.
Due to rationing and shortages of
! materials usually used for the tra
, ditional Strawberry Brunch, a war
time substitute, a Strawberry Punch,
has been planned by Tickie Elston
for Monday afternoon from 1:30 to
14:30. White cake and fruit punch
I will be sold.
Tag Day, with the slogan, "Do a
| favor for a little shaver," was sched
uled for Tuesday instead of Monday.
Fifty girls, instructed by Marge Mize
and Anna Lundstrom will sell tags
j at places on the campus.
; Con Home Tour
' B. J. McClure, head of the ofl
cainpus drive, announced that a tour
of the Convalescent Home has been
arranged for the couples of students
who will carry on ofT-campus solicit
ing during the week.
The tour will be held Monday aft
ernoon and will be followed by the
| annual dinner which officially be
gins solicitations.
On-campus collections will be
' made on Thursday of drive week.

Instead of the $3.10 necessary to keep
i a child at the Convalescent Home for
j one day, only $2 will be asked from
j each student, Miriam King president
of Cardinals, said. The reduced
j amount, was decided upon as a war
time sum. "But we hope those who
j can will give more," Miss King
j added.
Further arrangements were made
; by Cardinals for fraternities, soro
-1 rities, and small living groups who
| wish to contribute a lump sum in
stead of making individual donations.
, These houses may contribute $40,
| the sum to be prorated among the
I members, Miss King stated.
Victory Garden Work
Another job has been added to the
I quota of work for Labor Day, ac
[ cording to Rube Mettler, general
J chairman. Between 30 and 50 people
i are needed to work in Sam McDon
i aid's victory garden which helps feed
the Convalescent Home kiddies.
Fraternities and the Corporation
Yard are lending tools with which
{to weed and garden, Mettler said.
Paint to redecorate the toys, tradi
tional women's job on Labor Day,
