# Stanford Coeds Act As Brownie Leaders
## 
### 
It would probably startle most of
the Stanford students to learn that
there are little groups of Brownies
living, playing, and working on
their very campus.
They are not the kind of brown
ies housewives leave a saucer of
milk on the dorstep for after a
hard night's work. They look very
much like ordinary little girls
around 7 or 10 with their pig-tails
and hair ribbons.
Under Girl Scouts
They play like other little girls,
too: drop the handkerchief, tag,
jump-rope, and red light. They
work together on plays, reading
books, learning dances. But they
work together as Brownies, part of
the Girl Scouts of America under
the supervision of leaders chosen
from the students here at Stanford.
These leaders, most of them edu
cation or psychology majors, meet
with the youngsters once a week
and direct their activities. The
process has proved equally edu
cational for Brownies and for
leaders.
Varied Activities
The activities of the Brownies
are many and varied. They have
their meetings with their song and

their story. Then they often read
simple plays which they learn and
enact. They listen to music and
learn the complicated steps of the
Virginia Reel and other dances.
When their plays and dances are
prepared, they give teas for their
mothers, serving the punch and
cookies themselves.
The object of the Brownies is to
prepare the younger girls for en
trance into the Scouts or "Hying
up." The lore and principles of
Scouthood are introduced to them
Student Leaders
There are several Brownie
groups in and around Palo Alto
led by Stanford girls. Among the
girls doing this work are Peggy
Shaw, Sybil Harrison, Dorothy
Frost, Priscilla Symonds, Mary
Sweningsen, Sally Van Dyke, Bar
bara Brooke, Marjorie A. Smith,
Joan Tillson, Virginia Soper, and
Barbara Stofer.
Students in a course in child
psychology became scout leaders
as part of a class project last quar
ter, and many have continued this
quarter. For others, scout leading
is a part of war work, for there is
a great need for young women to
take charge of Girl Scout troops.

Stanford women, including Peggy Shaw and Sybil Harrison, from

Shaw's troop, which entertained for their mothers Monday.

work together on plays, reading
books, learning dances. But they
work together as Brownies, part of
the Girl Scouts of America under
the supervision of leaders chosen
from the students here at Stanford.
These leaders, most of them edu
cation or psychology majors, meet
with the youngsters once a week
and direct their activities. The
process has proved equally edu
cational for Brownies and for
leaders.
Varied Activities
The activities of the Brownies
are many and varied. They have
their meetings with their song and

their story. Then they often read
simple plays which they learn and
enact. They listen to music and
learn the complicated steps of the
Virginia Reel and other dances.
When their plays and dances are
prepared, they give teas for their
mothers, serving the punch and
cookies themselves.
The object of the Brownies is to
prepare the younger girls for en
trance into the Scouts or "Hying
up." The lore and principles of
Scouthood are introduced to them
Student Leaders
There are several Brownie
groups in and around Palo Alto
led by Stanford girls. Among the
girls doing this work are Peggy
Shaw, Sybil Harrison, Dorothy
Frost, Priscilla Symonds, Mary
Sweningsen, Sally Van Dyke, Bar
bara Brooke, Marjorie A. Smith,
Joan Tillson, Virginia Soper, and
Barbara Stofer.
Students in a course in child
psychology became scout leaders
as part of a class project last quar
ter, and many have continued this
quarter. For others, scout leading
is a part of war work, for there is
a great need for young women to
take charge of Girl Scout troops.


SERVING AS Girl Scout and Brownie troop leaders arc a number of
Stanford women, including Peggy Shaw and Sybil Harrison, from
left to right above. They are shown with the three officers of Miss
Shaw's troop, which entertained for their mothers Monday.
It would probably startle most of
the Stanford students to learn that
there are little groups of Brownies
living, playing, and working on
their very campus.
They are not the kind of brown
ies housewives leave a saucer of
milk on the dorstep for after a
hard night's work. They look very
much like ordinary little girls
around 7 or 10 with their pig-tails
and hair ribbons.
Under Girl Scouts
They play like other little girls,
too: drop the handkerchief, tag,
jump-rope, and red light. They
work together on plays, reading
books, learning dances. But they
