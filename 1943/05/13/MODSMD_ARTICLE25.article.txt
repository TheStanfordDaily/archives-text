## Mural Relays Start Friday 
### 
Tomorrow and Monday are the
dates for the running off of the in
tramural track retays. The events
will be held on Angcll Field and will
commence at 4:15 p.m. on both days.
Fireworks will get underway to
morrow with the four-man 440-yard
relay followed by the four-man 880-
yard relay. Festivities for the first
afternoon will be closed by the mile
medley relay consisting of two 220's,
a 440 and an 880.
Monday afternoon will feature the
eight-man mile race, the shuttle
hurdles, in which teams are com
posed of four men, and the four-man
mile relay.
There are 16 teams entered in the
events and the race looks at present
as though it will be a toss-up. A
slight edge must be given to the
Zetes at first sight, for their team
seems to be the most balanced out
fit. They are certain to be pressed
for honors by the Dekes and Fire
house who may always be counted
on to turn out strong aggregations.
Dark horses in the meet, but not
to be counted out of that first money
are the Delts and Phi Psi's.
The total entry list includes: Zetes,
Phi Psi, Chi Psi, Kappa Sig, Phi
Delta Theta, Delta Tau Delta,
Wong's Tong, Alpha Delta Phi,
Theta Chi, A.K.L., Dekes, Delta Up
silon, Firehouse, S.A.E., and Sigma
% Chi.
