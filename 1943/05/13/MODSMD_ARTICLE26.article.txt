# Injuries to Fess, Brenchley Hamper Cards' Track Chances
## 
### 
Stanford's best sprinter and best pole vaulter will not be in top shape
for Saturday's Big Meet. Pitch Johnson, Card track coach, gave out the
above news to San Francisco papers yesterday
The sprinter, Bob Fess, pulled a leg muscle against San Jose State, and

thus has had to take it easy for two
weeks. It is possible, however, that
Bob will be near top condition for
the meet. Clare Brenchley, the pole
vaulter, has been bothered for sev
eral weeks with a bad back, and
likewise hasn't been able to work
out very hard.
Johnson's only other worry as far
as injuries is concerned is quarter
miler Dud Cramer, who's been tak
ing typhoid shots for the Army this
week. Cramer worked out yester
day, however, and said he felt good.
Johnson was heartened by the re
turn to form of quarter-miler Bruce
Meyer and high-jumper George
Jones. Meyer, who's been out most
of the season with a pulled leg mus
cle, ran a smooth 440. Jones, out for
three weeks with a pulled groin
muscle, got over 5 feet 10 inches in
the high jump without any trouble.
Meanwhile, with the meet two
days off, dopesters throughout the
Bay Area begin unlimbering pencils
and comparing times. Already two
San Francisco papers have declared
California to be a definite favorite
