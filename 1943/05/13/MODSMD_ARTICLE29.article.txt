# Now That Is All

THIS is the last of the special issues that we of The Daily have
lovingly called the "Mag." When the paper was cut-down to
c tabby, we felt that a great many feature stories which did not
have current news value were kept out of the paper because of
space restrictions. For this reason we have run the "Mag" once
every other week, and this is the last one.
The "Mag" has represented a lot of work. Some of them have
been guite good and some of them have been rather poor, but
all of them have been our attempt at giving the campus some
thing more than the ordinary run of the mill news ... a little
insight into the forces and the persons that make up Stanford.
