# Purgees Hereâ€”--Two Years After Atherton
## 
### 
May 12, 1941 was the date of one
of the most stunning events that
ever hit the Stanford sports scene.
That was the date of ihe Atherton
purge upon those athletes that al
legedly had been lured to this in
stitution by promises of scholar
ships or grants from alumni.
There were a number of fresh
men, .just learning to understand
appreciate the traditions and ways
of their University, who awoke to
learn that they could no longer
participate in intercollegiate events
wearing the Cardinal.
The Eight Purgees
These fellows, eight in number,
were prominent high school ath
letes from all over the West Coast.
Their names were Bob Koch, Jim
Ellis, Matthew Petrlich, Bob Wa
ters, Jean Lamoure, Bill Joslyn,
Hal Petrich, and Bill Nourse.
Thoughts arose in those minds
that morning as to whether or not
they should continue to attend
school here and lose till chance at
the honor and fame that they might
attain on the* field for another col
lege. They said that these boys had
been bribed by illustrious and
wealthy alumni to come to Palo
Alto to enrich the fame and prow

ess of (heir great alma mater. This
may have been true, but they un
doubtedly came here for another
reason, too. They must have liked
it here just a little better than the
other places that gave them offers.
Five Remained
Of the eight boys who received
notice that morning that they were
ineligible, five chose to remain on
the Farm instead of leaving for
other regions. Three of those five
are still here on the campus, the
other two in the service.
A few weeks ago, Excom showed
the appreciation of the student body
in general by awarding these men,
who had not had a fair opportunity
to prove to the sports fans Ihat
they were able and competent to
display the block award for sports.
These men were not martyrs as
some of ihe sports writers in San
Francisco would have the people
believe. They are not being
awarded letters because they
stayed here to prove that Atherton
was in error. Fair or unfair as the
ruling may have been, these men
were granted awards because they
are fine athletes and have proved
it in the spirit of the other projects
they have undertaken.

EDWIN ATHERTON
May 12, 1941 was the date of one
of the most stunning events that
ever hit the Stanford sports scene.
That was the date of ihe Atherton
purge upon those athletes that al
legedly had been lured to this in
stitution by promises of scholar
ships or grants from alumni.
There were a number of fresh
men, .just learning to understand
appreciate the traditions and ways
of their University, who awoke to
learn that they could no longer
participate in intercollegiate events
wearing the Cardinal.
The Eight Purgees
These fellows, eight in number,
were prominent high school ath
letes from all over the West Coast.
Their names were Bob Koch, Jim
Ellis, Matthew Petrlich, Bob Wa
ters, Jean Lamoure, Bill Joslyn,
Hal Petrich, and Bill Nourse.
Thoughts arose in those minds
that morning as to whether or not
they should continue to attend
school here and lose till chance at
the honor and fame that they might
attain on the* field for another col
lege. They said that these boys had
been bribed by illustrious and
wealthy alumni to come to Palo
Alto to enrich the fame and prow

ess of (heir great alma mater. This
may have been true, but they un
doubtedly came here for another
reason, too. They must have liked
it here just a little better than the
other places that gave them offers.
Five Remained
Of the eight boys who received
notice that morning that they were
ineligible, five chose to remain on
the Farm instead of leaving for
other regions. Three of those five
are still here on the campus, the
other two in the service.
A few weeks ago, Excom showed
the appreciation of the student body
in general by awarding these men,
who had not had a fair opportunity
to prove to the sports fans Ihat
they were able and competent to
display the block award for sports.
These men were not martyrs as
some of ihe sports writers in San
Francisco would have the people
believe. They are not being
awarded letters because they
stayed here to prove that Atherton
was in error. Fair or unfair as the
ruling may have been, these men
were granted awards because they
are fine athletes and have proved
it in the spirit of the other projects
they have undertaken.
