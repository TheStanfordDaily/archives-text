# A 						New Spring Show
## 
### 
THE Spring Show will be produced this Friday and Saturday.
It is a different sort of Spring Show than has been produced
at Stanford in the past. Some of the shows in the past have been
good shows with good acting and good songs in them. Some
of them have been not so good. They all have been student
written.
Although this show is a departure from the past, it is adapted
to the changes that the war has forced on the campus. This year
it promises to be as good as any in the past. Rather than strug
gling on with limited ability in writing, Ram's Head has gotten
a good script, although not student written, and guarantees a
good show.
