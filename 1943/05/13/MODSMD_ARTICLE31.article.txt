### CYCLONE COVEY 
The bucketfuls of commentator verbiage still flowing un
abated, it is always a clarifying influence to attend the Tuesday
Series and hear speakers who really know what they are talking
about, as in this week's discussion of war aims by three dis
tinguished faculty men.
How such discussions sguare up with later developments is
a sure test of their reliability. Let us, for example, review some
statements in a panel discussion of nine Stanford faculty men
a few months before Pearl Harbor, and see how they sound now
in the light of intervening history.
Shau Wing Chan, in to Yamato Ichihashi's blaming
of China for Japanese fighting, said that China, on the contrary,
would gladly join efforts toward international co-operation. And
such Chinese willingness has not been in doubt at any time
since.
But Professor Ichihashi's chief point has come to be realized
in the United States as a true statement of future relations with
the East: that Asiatic participation in an organized peace could
be expected only if Asiatics were dealt with in a spirit of equality.
Professor Ichihashi, I remember, resented Karl Brandt's indi
cations of German influence in Japan. To which Dr. Brandt stated
his belief that the German-Japanese connection would become
more apparent as time passed. We cannot yet determine the
extent of German power in Japan; but interrelation of strategy
has so far tended to bear out Dr. Brandt's prediction.
Ralph Lutz said Italy would stand or fall with German for
tunes; and that prophecy is as applicable as ever. Graham
Stuart said the South American republics, disunited, were never
theless sobered by the United States' stand; and we have seen a
proportionate maturation of that soberness as the U.S. stand
matured into war.
On Russia, Vladimir Timoshenko observed, "We can truly
say that the Soviet government now desires to protect its terri
tory. But, if it is successful, v/ill it stop at this? . . . we cannot
be sure." And we still cannot.
