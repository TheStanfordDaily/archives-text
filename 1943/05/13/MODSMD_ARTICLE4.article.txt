# Personalities Comment On Changes in Campus
## 
### 
Because they know Stanford
better than do most students and
are definitely campus personalities,
The Daily has asked Mrs. Mildred
Redeker, Mrs. Dorothy Tibby, Po
lice Chief Gordon Davis, Peter
Keesmaat, and William Phillips for
comments on the changing Farm.
Mrs. Mildred Redeker
After five years of handing out
gym suits over the desk in the girls'
gym, Mrs. Mildred H. Redeker
still likes her job, and is a staunch
supporter of Stanford.
"I like to meet people and the
detail work here at the gym, but
most of all I enioy watching the
girls change from freshmen to sen
iors. When they first come they
are young and inexperienced, but
it's not long before they learn the
game and become more settled."
Mrs. Redeker started her job in
1938 through Dr. Pryor, when the
W.A.A. first started to issue gym
suits to the women. Some of the
original suits still remain, a fact
which adds to Mrs. Redeker's end
less job of mending.
''I'm inclined to believe that
once the girls get into the Univer
sity. it will be hard to ever go back
to the old ways," said Mrs. Rede
ker of Stanford's future ratio in
commenting on campus changes.
Mr. and Mrs. Redeker built their
home in Paly while Mr. Redeker
was still at Stanford. He is a Stan
ford graduate, a title which their
two sons, 14 and 16, are looking
forward to in the future.
"You couldn't keep my boys
away from the athletic meets or
stop them from cheering for Stan
ford."
Mrs. Dorothy Tibby
Mrs. Dorothy Tibby, known to
most simply as "Mrs. Tibby," has
been living in an apartment in the
Women's Clubhouse for three
years, making sure that the build
ing is always leady for the many
meetings, parties, and other func
tions that go on there.
Not only does she keep track of
reservations for the rooms that
may be used for anyone connected
with Stanford, but she also keeps
the lower lounge of the Clubhouse

in spic and span shape for students
to study in.
To go into detail about the things
Mrs. Tibby does would take a good
sized volume: she's everything from
a secretary to an interior deco
rator, but another one of her better
known chores is to keep track of
who's using the three pianos in
the Clubhouse.
When Mrs. Tibby was asked if
she had noticed any changes around
the Farm from where she viewed
it, she said that as far as she could
see, two things have changed with
the coming of the war: food and
the students' attitudes. No longer
do groups have the elaborate
spreads of pre-war days, and n&
longer do the Stanford rough ana
his girl trip lightly into the club
house lounge to glance over their
books. Today the rough (one of
the few that is left) and his girl
stride in with determination and
really dig in.
"And I'm no relation to Tibby in
'Bull Session'," laughed Mrs. Tibby.
Chief Gordon Davis
"Stanford has an enviable record
in traffic," according to Gordon
Davis, chief of the Stanford Police
Department. He has been working
on the police department 14 years,
and for the last two years has been
chief. During his experience, he
has found that "members of the
Stanford student body are rarely
involved in traffic accidents."
The Stanford Police Department
consists of five patrolmen and Chief
Davis. Their work is arranged so
that a policeman is on active duty
24 hours a day. Every police car is
equipped with a two-way radio, so
that a patrolman can be reached in
any emergency.
Chief Davis, known to most of
Stanford as "Gordy," has noticed
one change in particular during the
last 14 years at Stanford: When he
first arrived, the Stanford "Rough''
was still here, and there were many
"jalopies." Gradually, however,
with the arrival of more women
and the end of the "500," Stanford
men began to junk their jalopies
and get better looking cars.

Chief Davis has always found
University people "most coopera
tive and ready to comply with any
new regulation or request. "The
war has changed traffic conditions.
Students now drive slow of their
own accord," says Mr. Davis. ' Also
the iact that there are now less
cars on campus accounts for the
decrease in traffic offenses."
Peter Keesmaal
The Pete who makes the rapid,
proficient movements for cigarettes
and magazines behind the Cellar
counter is Peter Keesmaat, who
now remembers very little about
the Amsterdam, Holland, he left 20
years ago.
Pete still retains a quiet voice
and personality that tell of that
heritage, and his appreciation of
his Stanford job is apparently
equally quiet and sincere: Pete
saye he likes it "very much."
Pete has lived in California since
1931 and for 10 years worked at
Arturo's, a stand next to the Stan
ford Theater. Two years ago it
closed, and he has since worked at
the Cellar.
Pete says he has known many of
the "roughs" in that time, Jack
Rillman, Bobby Grayson and such;
he likes the informal side he sees
of student life. Of the campus
events, the athletic ones get his
greatest attention, and football is
his favorite.
About the war? Pete says he
doesn't know much about any
change around the Cellar; he's kept
"too busy."
William Phillips
A well known Stanford person
ality is William '"Phil" Phillips,
manager of the Encina Gym Store.
A native Californian, he came to
Stanford and the Encina Gym in
1927.
In his time, Phillip says, he has
seen a lot of changes at Stanford,
particularly in the athletic setup.
"Stanford's usually either on a peak
or in a slump," he said. "Right
now, Stanford sports are down on
the rocks, with the war going on
and everything."
One of Phil's favorite stories
about Farm life concerns Fleish
acker and Tiny Thornhill. "Tiny
and the players were always hors
in' around and one day Fleishacker
hits Tiny over the head with a roll
of paper. But the paper roll had a
wooden core and Tiny's knees
buckkled, and he started to weave
around. Herb didn't know about
the wooden core, of course, but it
sure was funny to see the look on
Tiny's face."
The way things are now, Phil
wouldn't be surprised if the Army
eventually took the store over.
"Stock is getting harder to get and
there are fewer men students
around. Every day somebody turns
his locker in to go in the service."
