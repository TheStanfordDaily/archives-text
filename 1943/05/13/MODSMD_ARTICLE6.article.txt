# Stanford Men Trained on Campus in 1918
## 
### 
Fall Quarter, 1918, saw a change
in Stanford's way of life.
The heads of the five stories
played "top point" in the first edi
tion of the Daily Palo Alto of that
quarter read, from right to left,
"Army Will Establish SA.T.C. Unit
in University," "Students Under 18
Not Eligible for SA.T.C. Training,"
"Marine Corps Unit Will Be Part
of 5.A.T.C.," "Many New Courses
for Students in Military Training,"
"Stanford Will Have Naval Train
ing Unit."
As of October 1, 1918. all physi
cally-fit men students were in
ducted into the armed fflrces. They
became subject to military law and
military discipline upon an active
duty status. The government pro
vided uniforms, barracks, subsist
ence, tuition, and $30 a month pay,
that of an Army private of that day.
This was the Student Army Train
ing Corps.
Organized in 1918
The Student Army Training
Corps was conceived by the War
Department in the summer of 1918
and was just being organized when
the nation's colleges re-opened. Its
purpose was to prepare college men
for whatever branch of the service
they were best fitted for and then
to place them in that service as
soon as . they were sufficiently
trained.
The trainees were classified in
five groups: Infantry and Artillery,
Quartermaster's and Ordnance
Corps, Air Service, Engineers and
Chemical Warfare, and Motor
Transport.
Army Field Kitchens
In order to fit in with the gov
ernment's plans, University build
ings were turned over to it and the
curriculum altered to meet the
new conditions. Technical students
were quartered in Old Roble, just
re-named Sequoia. The other four
groups were quartered in Encina.
The boys were fed from Army field
kitchens, while a mess hall was
being built.
The D.P.A. dedicated itself, in its
opening editorial, to the service of
the nation and the S.A.T.C., a
phrase that gained some point
when the editor, Harold G. Swend
sen, resigned to join up. To keep
in touch with the war on all fronts,
the "Dippy" printed weekly articles
on the progress of the war by Pro

fessor Payson J. Treat, of the his
tory department.
1,000 Men Sworn In
On October 2, 1918. over a thou
sand students were sworn in as the
Stanford unit of the Student Army
Training Corps. The ceremonies
were held on the Memorial Oval,
in front of the Quad: Messages
from President Wilson, the Chief of
Staff, and the Assistant Secretary
of War were read, and President
Wilbur spoke. The assembly was
timed to take place at the same

time in 500 colleges and universi
ties all over the country.
The unit was under the command
of Captain Samuel Parker, U.S.A.,
Ret., First Lieut. Morse Erskine
acted as adjutant; Second Lieuts.
Whittlesey, Badenoch, Helm, Lar
key, Mitchell, Spiegelman, Lam
bert, Bergstrom, Ransahoff, McAl
lister, Livernash, White, Parish,
Smith, Keith, and Koll completed
the military staff.
Naval Unit Organized
A naval unit was organized of
more than a hundred men, under
the command of C.P.O. Shirley.
They wore naval uniforms and
were quartered in one wing of En
cina under naval discipline.
The schedule followed by (he
S.A.T.O. was: First Ca11—5:45,
Reveille —(5, Mess Call —G:2O. and
so on, with two hours of drill, seven
hours of classes, and taps at 10.
Technical students were allowed
another hour o£ study, "hitting the
sack" at 11.
The student body planned a
dance to welcome the student sol
diers, but the outbreak of the "flu"
epidemic forced its postponement
and cancellation. The "flu'' epi
demic saw Stanford wearing gauze
masks, the Theta Xi, Fiji. A.T.0.,
and Delta Tau houses and Encina
clubroom all serving as hospitals.
Fraternities Closed
The University had closed the
fraternity houses when the Army
took more of the campus men.
Some were used as dormitories for
the under-age and physically-unfit
students not qualified for the
Army. The Women's War Board
had its headquarters in the Zete
house. The fraternities were not
permitted to initiate S.AT.C. men
until after the Armistice.
Student activities included the
raising of over $11,000 for war
work, and pledges of nearly $25,000
for the Fourth Liberty Loan. The
SA.T.C. men contributed large

amounts in both drives.
Went to Officers' School
During the quarter, 70 men were
sent from the Stanford unit to offi
cers' training camps. Presumably,
if the war had not ended as it did,
more would have been given offi
cers' training, "and many more
Stanford men would have gone out
to take their positions as leaders in
the war, as so many had already
done."
There was no ban in World War
I on S.A.T.C. participation in col
lege sports. Stanford's Army squad
revived American football on the
Farm for the first time since 1906.
Their first game was with a Mare
Island Navy team, whose former
college stars went through the
Cardinal line to the tune of 80-0.
A hard-fought tussle with U.S.C.
was lost 25-8.
Big Game Lost, 67-0
The reunion of Stanford and
California on the football field for
the first time since 1905 was an
occasion, complete with rally and
bonfire, of much excitement and
enthusiasm in which Stanford's
07-0 defeat went practically un
noticed. The eleven that rpet the
Bears included Gunn, Kaigler,
Nuss, Hoist, Holt (captain), and
Henry in the backfield, and Moore,

Clarke. Hawley, Watts, Patrick,
Flood, Maloney, Hill, and Watts in
the line. The S.A.T.C.-Card outfit,
was coached by Lieut. A. H. Bade
noch.
A rugby squad was organized
by the S.A.T.C. men under Pete
Flanagan, formerly with the Aus
tralian Waratahs. Stanford won its
first game with the Palo Alto A.C.
handily, but took only one out of
a series of three with Santa Clara.
Ended in December
It was widely believed that the
Student Army Training Corps
would be continued for the rest of
the academic year, although the
Armistice had come Nov. 11, 1918
Orders however came through to
muster out the student forces be
tween Dec. 4 and Dec. 22. and
Registration Day for Winter Quar
ter, 1919, saw Stanford back in
civilian dress.
Captain Parker, who was to re
main at Stanford as head of the
military department, made this
final statement to the D.P.A., "The
S.A.T.C. has demonstrated its use
fulness in training men for the na
tion's service. I am more than sat
isfied with its progress. I feel sure
however that every man and offi
cer in the S.A.T.C. unit will be
glad of its disestablishment."
