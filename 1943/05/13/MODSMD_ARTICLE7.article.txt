# 'Die Luft der Frieheit Weht'
## 
### 
AN ex-Daily man of a few years back went to work in The City
as a copy boy for the United Press. Early one morning all
the staff reporters were busy and a message came through from
New York to get an interview with a refugee from Germany.
The reporter went out on the pilot boat in the early morning
fog and eventually they met the little freighter that carried the
escaped rabbi. After a little trouble the reporter located the rabbi
in his cabin and set about getting an interview. However, he
lound out fhat the rabbi could speak no English, and he could
speak no German.
He got a fellow passenger to act as translator, and after much
repeating, and a great deal of time and effort, he pieced together
an interview out of the broken English phrases of the fellow
passenger.
As the interview progressed, the ship had passed through
the Golden Gate, and the sun had eaten off the fog. The re
porter picked up his papers to leave and go out on deck. The two
httle sons of the rabbi, who had sat guietly throughout the inter
view, were now looking out the port hole and pointing. The
green hills were bright in the morning sun, and a little wind
v as blowing. The little boys were delighted by the sight of land,
but they didn't realize it was more than the name "Amerika."
The reporter looked at the little boys and said the only phrase
cf German he knew, "Die Luft der Freiheit weht."
The rabbi, who had been persecuted, whose back was per
manently scaried, and whose soul was bitter with hate —the edu
cated rabbi who had been so contained and quiet throughout
the interview, wept.
