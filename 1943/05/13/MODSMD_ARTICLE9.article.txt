When and if the fluctuating blast

dents will be too absorbed in get
ting to their bomb shelters to give
much thought to the behind the
scenes activities of the civilian de
fense groups which have been or
ganized for their protection since

Members of this closely coordi
nated group, however, will have for

alarm been quickly reporting to
their posts and preparing to take
up their respective duties in event
of a disaster.
Stalls Notified

When and if the fluctuating blast
of the siren gives the order for a
blackout of the campus, most stu
dents will be too absorbed in get
ting to their bomb shelters to give
much thought to the behind the
scenes activities of the civilian de
fense groups which have been or
ganized for their protection since
December 7.
Members of this closely coordi
nated group, however, will have for
some time before the general
alarm been quickly reporting to
their posts and preparing to take
up their respective duties in event
of a disaster.
Stalls Notified
When word is received at the
control center that a yellow alert
has been issued by the filter station
this area, Dr. Helen Pryor of the
women's gymnasium is immediate
ly notified; she then phones the di
rectors of the three casualty sta
tions, who in turn notify the staffs
which have been assigned to duty
for that particular night if and
when the blue signal is reported.
By this time the siren may have
blown ordering a blackout. If so,
the girls assigned to duty, equipped
with flashlights and their Red Cross
arm bands, are allowed by the air
raid wardens to proceed immedi
ately to their stations.
Complete Squad
Each station is equipped with
four first-aiders, two girls with gas
masks who are trained to handle
poison gas victims, two messengers,
two adult captains, two doctors, and
one nurse. '
In event of an actual bombing,
incidents are phoned in by the air
raid wardens to the control center,
which in turn notifies the casualty
station for that area to send some

first-aiders to the spot.
Regular Drills
From time to time drills are held
to enable the volunteers to prac
tice coordinating their activities.
Such a drill will be held the day
after tomorrow at 7:15, when all
the civilian defense workers will
report to their posts prepared to
stand by to receive reports of the
"incidents" which will be simulated
at various points on campus.
Taking the casualty station at
the women's gym as an example,
the 39 girls on active duty are di
vided into four squads, each of
which is assigned to stand by for
duty one week a month. Each
group also meets one evening a
month for first aid practice.
Cias Decontamination
The casualty station at the gym
contains a gas decontamination
room, where gas victims may be
treated without contaminating the
other patients. The gym is also
equipped with cots and supplies
sufficient for it to be converted into
an emergency hospital in case the
regular isolation hospital on Por
tola road is filled to capacity or put
out of commission.
The first-aiders at the women's
gym stations are Ann Bowman,
Emily Frank. Joan Hodgman, Betty
Lou Horton, Caroline Kuhns, Kay
Lipman, June Lewis, M'Liss Loed
ing, Margot Lowell, Blanche Mur
phy, Betty Osborn, Jane Phillips,
Florence Porter, Allyn Scarbor
ough, Sally Tiernan, and Catherine
Thomas.
