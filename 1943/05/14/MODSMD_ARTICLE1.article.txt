# Spring Show in Gay Nineties' Mood Opens Tonight
## 
### Jane Glasson 
To a stirring overture of Guy 'Nineties tunes, the curtain will rise on.
Rain's Head's annual Spring Show tonight at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium
A festival of good old music, songs, dances, and a true melodrama,
beautifully satired by a cast of 14, the Spring Show this year departs from
the usual and brings in a tried and true success formula.
Twenty olio acts will be presented between acts of "No Mother to
Guide Her," the melodrama of shooting and spooning, villains and heroes.
Opening the show will be Ed Carpenter directing his all-student or
chestra of 10 pieces, playing a medley of favorite tunes —"Strolling in the
Park," "Ta-ra-ra-boom-de-ay," and "No Mother to Guide Her." an origi
nal song, the music and lyrics by Bill Van Voris.
Members of the orchestra are:
Joan WhiUnore, piano; Ted Mihran, Mary Ann Luhnow, and Ann Stru
art, violins; Brad Morison, trumpet; Frank Herbert, trombone; Norm:
Anzini, flute; Ned Sanford, clarinet; Don Sharp, 'cello; and Don Hillback
drummer.
Property crew for "No Mother to Guide Her" has had a problem, sine
various members of the vallain's gang and the strong arm of the law net
eight guns, three boxes of blank cartridges, a blackjack, and a whisk
bottle.
Two Dogs and a Bit by
But all the properties have been rounded up, including two dogs and ;
pseudo-baby, so the melodrama will hit the stage accompanied by shoot
ing sheriffs, sneaking villains, and a crying infant.
Members of the cast of ''No Mother to Guide Her" are:
Jose de Larious as Father Day; Peggy Fitts as Lindy, an old maid aunt
Bob Hagopian as Livingston, the moustached villain; Bud Semrau ;
Sheriff Silas; Jane Bicknell as Rose, the beautiful heroine; Herb Cabr.

BOSSES of the Spring Show, playing tonight and tomorrow night, seem to get a kick from directing the
some 50 students participating in "No Mother to Guide Her" and the 20 olio acts. Pictured above are Nan
Tillson, executive secretary , Gordon Gibb, director, and Natalie Towle, assistant director, as they watch the
stage from the red plush seats of Memorial Auditoriu in.
Levinson as Mother Tagger, a gypsy hag and villain's accomplice; Wallace
Thompson as Jake, another villain's accomplice; Russ Bryan as the devout
parson; and Bob Kinsinger, Perry Holmes, and Ward Cummings as offi- |
cers of the law.
After the first act of "No Mother to Guide Her," two olios begin a series I
of fast, quick-hitting, short "added attractions."
Taking part in "On to the Morgue" are Dick Linstrum, Ward Cum- !
mings, and Bob Kinsinger. Also between the first and second acts. Nan
Tillson, Gay 'Nineties songbird, will render "Don't. Go in the Lion's Cage
Tonight."
The women's dancing chorus, under the direction of Jacques Poley-
Ogg, will present, "If Your Foot Is Pretty, Show It!" Members of the
chorus are Jackie Armstrong, Jan Wilson, Florence Rollins, Gloria Olivi,
Arlene Aggen, Ruth Froelich, Betsy Savage, and Margaret Morgan.
Father. Dear Father
"Father, Dear Father" will be interpreted by Ellen Marcus and Russ
Bryan.
Following, Herb Cabral will sing "Kissin' on the Sly," while seven Gay
'Nineties belles and beaux provide the action—with parasols. They are
Jackie Armstrong, Jan Wilson, Florence Rollins, Kenneth Jones, Russ
Bryan, Perry Holmes, and Dick Linstrum.
Another olio, entitled "Awfully Clever," is danced by the male chorus,
composed of Russ Bryan, Bob Kinsinger, Perry Holmes, Kenneth Jones,
Jack Coy, Rene Zentner, A1 Cleveland, and Dick Linstrum.
Following the intermission, Jean Robinson will present "The Guiding
Light." Nan Tillson again hits the spotlight when she sings an old favorite,
"Oceana Roll."
The barbershop sextette, recently appearing at the Spring Sing, will
harmonize on "Don't Beat Your Mother, Boys, It's Mean," and "She's
More to Be Pitied than Censored." Members of the sextette are Herb
Cabral, Ward Cummings, Owen Walker, Robert Kinsinger, Bud Semrau,
and Jim Bloch.
Two Bathing Beauties
Two bathing beauties, in late 19th century style, will present a special
olio act. They are NatalicTowle and Jean Levinson.
Ruth Froelich and Russ Bryan will perform to a ditty entitled "When
Francis Dances with Me,," and Hyer and Dryer have prepared a specialty
act.
The whole cast manages to bound into the finale, "Up in a Balloon,"
with music, singing, and dancing that are light, gay, and airy.
Not appearing on the stage, but contributing immeasurarbly to the
success of the show, are the technical crews.
