# STANFORD ARMY UNITS
## Nitery Dance Set Saturday; R.O. Will Be Inducted Today 
### 
The 65 members of the second year
advanced R.O.T.C. will be taken to
the induction center in San Fran
cisco today to be inducted, Col.
Harry B. Allen, commandant of all
Army units at Stanford, said yester
day.
These students will be inducted
today and will return to Stanford
tonight. On Monday they will be
taken to the Presidio at Monterey,
where they will be outfitted in full
military uniform. After spending a
night in Monterey, they will return
to Stanford and resume their studies.
The only difference which the in
duction will make in the students'
status will be that they will have to
wear uniforms and they will be paid
by the government.
The R.O.T.C. members wall con
tinue to live in their present living
groups and under the regulations of
those living groups.
"This change has been made to
put all of the R.O.T.C. in the same
Army status," Colonel Allen said.
' There will be absolutely no change
in the scheduled calling up of the
second-year advanced R.O.T.C. They
will be inducted and will then be
ordered to report to me as their com
manding officer. I will order them
to continue their studies."
