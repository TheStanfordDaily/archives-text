Special airborne aviation engineer
battalions equipped with specially
designed light equipment which can
be transported in transport planes or
gliders are designed for rapid re
habilitation of captured enemy air
dromes or the rapid construction of
minimum air base facilities in for
ward areas. Their light equipment
indicates that they may participate
in many landing operations. This
unit saw action in North Africa,
where it was instrumental in win
ning the battle for Tunisia, the Air
Forces revealed.
Men who enlist or who are about
to be inducted may be assigned to an
