# Farm, Cal Meet Tomorrow In 50th Annual Track Classic
## 
### 
It's the Golden Anniversary of the
Big Meet!
Tomorrow afternoon at Edwards
Field, Berkeley, track squads repre
senting Stanford and California will
battle it out once again in the 50th
renewal of the annual cinder clas
sic. First event, the mile run, gets
under way at 2 p.m.
Underdogs as usual, the Farm's 2G
trackstcrs leave tomorrow morning
by cars for the California campus,
hoping to pull what would be the
biggest upset since the two teams
started fighting it out back in 1880.
Cal Favored
California, rout winner over the
University of Southern California
last week in Los Angeles, is the
choice. The records show us the
Bears should win by anywhere from
20 to 40 points.
But these track meets are funny
things—a hurdler goes down or a
sprinter pulls a muscle and the
whole thing becomes a different
story. Stanford Coach Pitch John
son, who's seen it happen without
anyone having to fall down or pull
iip lame, says that "we might sur
prise 'em."
Coachcs Uncertain
Both Johnson and Bear Coach Al
Ragan are uncertain about just who
-vill run what, which makes the
neet all Ihe more interesting. Ra
gan claims that quarter-miler John
Prader and 880 man Al Stone are
.not ready to go, and thus is think
ing about throwing Grover Klem
mer into the 440 and Jim Dunn into
the half.
Should the Rover enter the one
lap event, he'll run right into Stan
ford's Johnny Fulton. Ragan is also
considering running his distance
ace, Ralph Dewey, in the two-mile
only.
Will Be Ready
Johnson has Bob Fess and Claire
Brenchley on the injured list, but
both will be able to compete even
though they may not be at their
best.
From a psychological standpoint,
Ihe Cards have the advantage. The
Bears were fired up for S.C., and
no matter how much the Big Meet
counts toward their block C's, they'll
]et down somewhat.
Davis Cinch
California figures to have first
•places in the sprints (Hal Davis),
hurdles (Lee Angelich), and broad
■jump and discus (Jim Jurkevich)
cinched. The Indians likewise are
pretty sure of winning the high
ump (Willard Smith), 440 (Johnny
Fulton), and javelin (Al Pande).
Feature events of the meet should
be the mile, 880, relay, pole vault,
and shot put. In the four-lap event,
Card Bob Compton gets another
chance at the two Bear milers, Dew
ey and Terry Ring. Ring is recover
ing from a bad leg, while Compton
is in top shape. -
KleiTimer in 880
Klemmer is pretty certain of win
ning the 880, but the battle for the
other two spots should be interest
ing. Cards Wayne Girdner and Glen
Holtby seem to have the edge, but
Stone and Ring (if he runs) will
give them a tough time.
Should Fulton and Klemmer fail
io meet in the quarter, they'll un
doubtedly get together on the an
chor lap of the relay. If Cal's Davis
also runs in the last event, the Bears
will be hard to beat; if he doesn't,
Stanford should win it.
Second, Third Places
As in most of the other events, the
big battles in the shot and pole vault
will be waged for the place and
show spots. In the former event,
Cards Fred Boensch and Ed Chyno
weth and Bear Tom Hill will fight it
out for second and third. Claire
Brenchley and Martin Anderson of
the Farm and Al Harris are the
contenders in the vault. Keith Gros
wird of Cal is favored to win this
event.
An automobile accident in America
is fun only for three people—Hitler.
Mussolini, and Hirohito.
