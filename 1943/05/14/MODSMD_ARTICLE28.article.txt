## 
### 
Behind the spectacular hurling of I
Bob Morrison, the Chi Psi's con
tinued their winning streak, run
ning it up to two games, by whip- ;
ping the Dikes 7-4. The Chi Psi
boys were forced to come from be- |
hind in their last time at bat with !
two out lo score four runs and win
the game. Jack Clark was the los
ing pitcher.

The intramural track relays will
be held (his afternoon and Monday
on Angell Field as planned. Some
16 teams are signed up to battle for
the title won by the Zctes last year.
The baton passing program will get
underway at 4:15. Track Coach
: Pitch Johnson is in charge.

The hitting was sparked by two
home runs, one for each side. Hugh
West was the "friend in need" for
Chi Psi, cracking his home run in
the early stages of the ball game.
Bill Joslyn, Deke, was not to be
outdone and hit his roundtripper
soon after.
In a four o'clock game, Sigma Nu
rang up their second victory of the
season by defeating the Kappa Sigs
5-4. The Sigma Nu men got off to
an early lead by gaining two runs
in the first inning and three more in
the second. They almost lost the
ball game in the seventh, however,
when a high fly ball to center field
hit right fielder Tom Hilleary on

the head, knocking him to the
ground, the ball going out to the
edge of the field. The Kappa Sigs
were able to score two runs at that
time, but lost their opportunity
when pitcher Jim Buckingham bore
down to retire the side.
There is a slight mystery concern
ing the final score of the Zeta-S.A.E.
game. One source reported the count
as (3-1 in favor of the Zetes, while
another source, considered just as
reliable as the first, reports the score
as 20-3. One thing is certain, how
ever—the Zetes won the game.
In other games played, the Phi
Delts fell before Harry Boothe and
the Theta Chi's 8-0. Page Mill got
away to an early lead and defeated
the A.K.L. squad 2-0.
Sigma Chi continued their win
ning ways, hopping all over Wong's
Tong 12-5. while the Delt boys were
unable to get started and wound up
losers to Theta Delts by 12-6.
In the last game scheduled the
Betas weie forced, by a shortage of
manpower, to forfeit their game to
the Phi Psi's.
