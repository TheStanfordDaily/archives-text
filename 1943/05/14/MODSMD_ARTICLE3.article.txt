### 
Wanta dance with a Stanford
| queen for only a dime? Wanta
| throw garters with the Tri-Delts?
! Wanta visit a mystery cave?
I These and other equally sensa
! tional opportunities will be offered
! to Stanfordites when the 1943 Sopho
| more Carnival, final event of the
; Convalescent Home Drive, hits the
| boards in the Pavilion next Friday
! night at 7:30.
Tomato and egg throwing, bas
; ketball, roulette wheels, plus lots of
I eats will be other features in the
Carnival, traditionally known as the
year's one event at which Stanford
ites really turn hilarious.
At a meeting last night, plans were
made to have 24 booths and there
was a rumor of a raffle, plus the an
nouncements of the booths planned
by the various living groups.
The Phi Delts will, as in former
years, have a taxi dance featuring
Roble queens; Wong's Tong will run
a roulette table; A.O.Pi's will have
a mystery cave which no one knows
' much about; and the Tri-Delts will
have garter throwing. Penny pitch
ing will be conducted by the Sigma
Nus, tomato and egg throwing at
their pledges will be handled by the
Kappa Sigs and the Betas respec
, tively. Candied apples will be sold
by the Alpha Phis and ice cream by
the Gamma Phis. Other groups have
not decided on their concessions but
all sororities and fraternities have
: announced that they will each man
age one.
I "The admission to all these co
i lossal concessions is a dime apiece,"
I said Tom Morton, general chairman
j of the carnival, and the profits will
j be turned over to the Convalescent
Home Drive." He extended a special
; invitation to the members of the
! STAR unit to attend this gala affair
j and help the kiddies too.
