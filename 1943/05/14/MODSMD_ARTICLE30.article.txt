# Red Nine Faces Cat in Big Games Tomorrow
## Mason, Miller Twirl for Cards 
### 
Tomorrow Stanford's victorious
nine will travel across the bay to
engage the State Champions from
California. The two games, one to
be played in the morning at 9:30,
and one in the afternoon at 3:30, will
wind up the conference this year.
The Reds have nothing to gain in
loop standings for even if they should
win both games they will still re
main in third place behind the Bears
and Santa Clara.
The game's principal draw is that
it is California and Stanford. The
league has already been won by the
Berkeleyites, who then continued on
to defeat the Trojans from Southern
California last weekend to clinch the
State Championship.
So whatever happens tomorrow
may be in the form of an anti-climax
to baseball fans, but not so to the
Red team, for it is these two games
that the boys have been pointing
toward all season.
All bets would seem to be on the
Bears before the game starts, for
they have not been defeated in
league competition this year and
have defeated the men from the
Farm once already this season. The
odds are not so simple to figure as
all that however, for the Cards have
looked mighty powerful the last two
weekends. And then, California is
liable to let down a little since they
have already cinched the state crown
and losses would not mean too much
to their record for the year.
Although no certain information
is at hand it is supposed that the
California team will play at top
strength against Coach Harry Wol
ter's men using Bob. Wier, who
defeated Stanford earlier this year,
and Doug Donnan, who was the big
man against the S.C.'s nine, as
pitchers. The rest of the lineup will
be unchanged.
For Stanford it will undoubtedly
be Doc Mason and Jack Miller on
the hill. Mason has returned to his
last year's peak form and is certain
to give the State U. boys a rough
time at bat. Miller has looked good
all season long in relief and start
ing roles and may prove too much
for the Bears tomorrow.
Tlie infield is at its best with
Howie Dallmar, Ben Cardinelli, Bob
Blown, and Jay McKie. The out
field situation seems to be somewhat
cleared with Bill Cunha, Lloyd Mer
riman, and Keith Pinion.
At bat, too, the Indians are a
changed team. In their last four
games they have been smacking the
ball all over the lot, and with a little
luck they can knock the cover off it
tomorrow at Berkeley.
Conditions being what they are,
the games should be rated with a
slight advantage on the side of the
California Bear, but look for an up
set.
