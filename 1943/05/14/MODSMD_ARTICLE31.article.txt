# Card Gridders Take On Coast Guard Sea Lions
## 
### 
It's spring kick-off time again, minus the kick-off, when the Stanford
football team takes the field against the powerful Coast Guard Sea Lions
on the varsity practice field tomorrow at 2:30.
Card Coach Marchie Schwartz has plans to use his entire squad in
tomorrow's game, but nevertheless he has named the following men

for his starting lineup. Just how
long these boys will stay in the con
test as a unit remains to be seen.
Brown to Start
At left end will be Dave Brown,
and at the other end, Bob Hall. Both
are veterans who helped Stanford in
accomplishing its great comeback
last season.
The tackle positions will be filled
by two more members of last year's
squad—Bill Young at right and Har
vey Bernhard at left. Bernhard,
however, is a doubtful starter as he
hurt his ankle in yesterday's prac
tice. If the injury fails to heal prop
erly, his position will be handled by
Dick Madigan.
Weaver at Center
Art Weaver, a new addition to the
team this year, will take over the
center post left vacant by the de
parture of Milt Vucinich.
The backfield lineup is undoubt
edly the strongest part of the Cards'
attack. Every man here has had
varsity experience in the past. Bob
Andrews, who played behind Ray
Hammett at quarterback in 1942,

moves into the spotlight this season.
Andrews has been showing up ex
ceptionally well in practice, and has
been hitting the mark with his
passes.
Rock's in There
At left half is Don Zappettini, ;i
break-away runner.par excellence.
Right half is Willard "Rock" Shel
ler. Sheller played regular first
string last season, and will handle
the blocking jobs, plus a few line
smashes.
The final position, fullback, is
given to Dick Munroe, who moves in
with the absence of Buck Bawcett.
Bob Gulley, quarterback; Ross
Dana, left half; Ben Morrison, right
half, and Bob Barsocchini, fullback,
compose the second string back
lineup. This quartet should see
plenty of action.
As for the power of the Sea Lions,
the onlookers should expect to see
plenty of big football names in their
lineup, and this speaks for itself.
Lt. Joe Verducci has already had his
team come out victorious once this
year—against the Bears of Califor
nia, 14-0 —and probably figures to
do the same thing against the In
dians.
The contest will undoubtedly be
the final one for many of the men
now making up the Stanford team,
and it will be the last game that As
sistant Coach Harry Shipkey will
see the Cards play for the duration.
Shipkey is now Lt. Harry Shipkey
of the Navy, and is scheduled to re
port to the North Carolina Pre-
Flight School on May 22, where he
will continue his athletic duties in
| building up future Navy fliers.
