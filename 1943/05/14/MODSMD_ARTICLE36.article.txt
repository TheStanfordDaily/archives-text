# Light on the Subject

### 
A RECENT Campus Opinion letter to The
Daily called attention to the deplorable
condition of the lights in the main reading room
of the Library. Indeed these lights are dis
graceful. At best they are poor, but with the
hats that are now on them, they are impossible.
If any place in a university should be con
ducive to study, it should be the reading room
of the Library. Stanford's reading room is not.
Apparently it is now impossible to get lights,
fixtures, and electricians to install them. How
ever, if Army men stationed here at Stanford
are going to use the Library, every effort should
be made to get priorities and lights similar to
those in the Engineering Library.
If, however, lights cannot be obtained in the
immediate future, plans should be laid to get
them immediately on the close of the war.
Now lights in the Library are Stanford's most
pressing need.
