### CYCLONE COVEY 
The way we live is side-splitting.
But while, for example, we laugh at Bob
Hope, we do not yet laugh at those who laugh
at Bob Hope; and they are funnier.
Now Bob Hope represents the type of humor
which is in style. When that type goes out of
style, in say, the super-advanced days of 1973,
Americans will probably yet find the Hope hu
mor humorous enough to laugh at; but what will
really make them howl will be the several mil
lion absurdities who in 1943 laughed at Bob
Hope and did not laugh at themselves, who were
funnier.
I can just picture a "period" production at
Stanford in the Hope style of humor in 1973 . . .
The director will yell, "No, no! They didn't do
it that way in those times. You've got to realize
that civilization was in a relatively primitive
stage, and put yourselves into the spirit of it.
"Remember that students here in '43 were
such coffee addicts that they drank a quinine so
lution when they could not get coffee (for it
was not till the Cellar was rebuilt after the 1965
earthquake that coffee replaced quinine at Stan
ford). Remember that it was an age of indivi
duality, and yet the women buried themselves
in cosmetics in order to look alike. Remember
that people rushed all over creation because
they never had enough time, and yet would sit
hours on end watchinq mediocre double fea

tures. Now get into the spirit of such a time."
Well, until the advanced 70's are laughing
at the mad 40's, we can laugh in the mad 40's at
the gay 90's.
And thus we arrive at the point of our dis
course which is the Spring Show. There are
some connected with its production who doubt
that the modern students can guite get into the
spirit of the other age, and whether the humor
of the other age will be laughable to this one.
From what I saw of rehearsals the other
night, I would say that they are not doing so
poorly in projecting themselves backwards. And
I would say that the Gay Nineties humor is not
only still laughable, but that the Gay Nineties
itself was funnier yet. When the jokes fall flat,
you will laugh at the people who once laughed
at the jokes.
Twenty olio acts are going to make the,
Spring Show a combined melodrama and gaie
ties. The uncommonly unfrustrated directing of
Gordon Gibb has made for uncommonly orderly
practice. The orchestra under Ed Carpenter's
direction is going to sound scrumptuous. And
the dance direction of Jacgues Poley Ogg re
mains inimitable.
Somebody asked me before I knew anything
about it, whether I thought the show would be
worth seeing. I will now answer that so it
appears.
