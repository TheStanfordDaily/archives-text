To The Faculty:
Since the beginning of the war, and par
ticularly since the recent heavy demands on
manpower which have depleted the ranks of
the students here, there have been many
changes in both faculty and, more especially,
student personnel. However, despite this
speeding up of the turnover, there has not been
a corresponding increase in the number of stu
dent-faculty contacts of an informal, social na
ture.
This fact is much regretted by many of the
students who have found the faculty members
to be quite human and likeable in spite of their
positions.
Therefore, I would like to invite the mem
bers of the faculty to participate in the Conva
lescent Home Drive next week, May 17-21. Es
pecially, I would like to invite them to the Work
day on Wednesday, May 19, at the Home, where
they will have an excellent chance to meet the
students informally. The students will be work
ing from 1 to 6 p.m. Thank you.
Dick Wilbur, Chairman
Convalescent Home Drive
(Editor's Note: The following is a letter
from Lueil Weed, water safety chairman,
Palo Alto Chapter, American Bed Cross.)
Good work, Bob Brown and Bob McClean!
A good rescue you made on the Coast Guard
patrol plane accident!
Out of many on the beach Bob Brown and Bob
McClean were the only two to make the 200
yards in the surf to the plane and back to shore.
More than ability to swim was necessary.
Endurance and a knowledge of how to swim
through breakers were especially necessary.
These two men, having had experience enough
in such cold water, knew that they could stand
the exposure involved in such a swim.
STANFORD MEN! We can give our blood
for you, roll bandages for you, write V mail
to you, buy bonds and stamps. The Army and
Navy can train you in warfare and provide
you with equipment. But no one can learn to
swim for you.
Can you take care of yourselves in mid
ocean? You have unusual opportunity to learn
Water Safety and Life-Saving at Stanford. Take
advantage of this opportunity while you have it.
And so in closingâ€”TOP HONORS today to
you, Bob Brown and Bob McClean! May there
be many more like you able to meet such an
emergency.
