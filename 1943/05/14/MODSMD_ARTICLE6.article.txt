LONDON, May 13 (UP). â€”The Netherlands government warned Hol
land's population tonight that German occupation authorities were at
tempting to provoke them into premature revolt and advised them that
"resistance is good only if it is carried out in concert."
The warning, broadcast over Radio Orange, the Netherlands station

here, came amid reports of sporadic
resistance against the Nazis, and
strikes and disorders were said to be
spreading across Holland. Disorders
were expected to reach a new climax
with the passing of the deadline to
night for the registration of 400,(KM)
former Dutch servicemen for re
internment.
Dutch quarters, quoted by An eta,
the Netherlands news agency, said
the Germans apparently were em
barked on a plot to incite the Neth
erlands population into quick revolt
for which the Dutch were unpre
pared.
