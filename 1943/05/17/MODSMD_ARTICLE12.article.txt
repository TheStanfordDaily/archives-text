# Panel To Discuss Culbertson Plan
## 
### 
A forum for the discussion of the
Ely Culbertson World Federation
Plan will be held a week from today,
May 24. in the Education Audito
rium at 7:30 p.m.
Sponsored by the department of
political science, the forum is being
held to acquaint the public with the
features of the plan for post-war or
ganization which was formulated
by Ely Culbertson.
''The idea of a panel discussion is
not so much to propagate the Cul
bertson plan as something fixed, but
rather to encourage American citi
zens to think of post-war settlements
in concrete and detailed terms," said
Professor B. Q. Morgan.

Stanford's professor of dramatic
literature, Capt. Hubert Heffner, is
tin 1 newest member of the Farm fac
ulty to receive army orders. He left
yesterday to report at the Presidio
in San Francisco and from there he
will go to the University of Virginia.
