# Spring Show Drama Dull-Olios Sparkle
## 
### Cheri Martin 
"No Mother to Guide Her," the
feature presentation of the Spring
Show, was definitely not a fast-mov
in gand outstanding, clever or hu
morous production as spring shows
usually are. In fact, it was a definite
drag on the olio acts which put the
Spring Show over. When, in the
fourth act, the villain was finally
killed, there were murmurs through
out Friday night's audience of "Why
didn't they do that in act one so we
could enjoy the olios." Indeed, the
fault of the show was not in the
presentation itself, but in the selec
tion of the play.
Semrau Sparkles
In spite of the fact that the play as
a whole was sheer boredom, some of
the players deserve credit for trying
to stimulate it, and the audience.
Very good in his portrayal of the vil
lain was Bob Hagopian who hud down
, to perfection the speech, walk, man
ner, and mustache-twisting associ

ated with the character.
Although he played the not so im
portant part of Silas, Bud Semrau
turned in one of the best perform
ances of the evening. His love-mak
ing to Lindy, played by Peggy Fitts,
was very amusing. Jean Levinson as
the old gypsy who did the villain's
dirtry work was very good, too. The
rest of the players performed in
their stereotyped parts to the best of
their ability.
Can-Can Awfully Clever
Outstanding in the olio acts was
Nan Tillson who sang "Don't Go in
the Lion's Cage Tonight" and
"Oceana Roll" with Beatrice Kay
perfection. Janice Shaughnessy's
song in swing plus the back
ground of modern dress was the
most refreshing part of the show,
although a close second was "Brun
hilda of the Burlesque" interpreted
by Jane Spaulding, for a strip tease
has a certain refreshing quality. In
old time bathing suits, the bathing
beauties Natalie Towle and Jean
Levinson were excellent in their

song and routine.
Along the lines of dancing, the
can-can takes top honors for it was
perfection. Twirling legs and ruffled
panties were displayed in perfect
rhythm. "Awfully Clever" by a
soloist and a male dancing chorus
with canes and derbies was "awfully
clever."
Costumes, like everything else in
the show, were authentic reproduc
tions of the Gay Nineties . The
scenery was elaborate, too. with four
complete changes plus a clever cur
tain as the background for the olio
acts.
Authenticity seems to be the best
word to describe the show as a
whole, and a good job of Gay Nine
ties representation was done. How
ever it can be seen that this au
thentic representation definitely lim
ited the display of talents in the play,
but provided an excellent central
theme for the acts.

Yemen, in southern Arabia, is one
of the few remaining countries which
lack a railroad.
