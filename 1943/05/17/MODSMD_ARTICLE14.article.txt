## BASEBALL Cal Sweeps 3-Game Series With 9-5, 7-6 Weekend Wins 
### 
Coach Harry Wolter used his two
ace pitchers, Jack Miller and Doc
Mason, in both ends of the double
header baseball game with Califor
nia last Saturday, but even this was
not enough to stop the Bear dia
mondmen from emerging with a
clean sweep, 9-5 and 7-6.
In the first game, Miller took the
mound for the Cardinals, but was
replaced by Mason after he had run
into trouble in the fifth and early
part of the sixth inning. Cal's six
run splurge in these two innings
iced the issue for them. They had
been trailing the Cards' 5-3 up until
that time. The Bears gained 11 hits,
while Stanford collected seven.
A belated rally in the last two
innings of the closer fell one run
short, and helped the Bears in com
pleting the league schedule without
a blemish. The Farm nine got to
Bob Weir for nine hits, while Cal
garnered only seven off of Mason,
who started, and Miller.
Jay McKie, third base, led the Card
hittrs in the first game with two for
three, and Bob Brown helped the
Indians' "lost cause" in the curtain
call with three for four. Jack Mc-
Clain ,Bear left fielder and leading
hitter for the season, pounded out a
total of four hits in six official trips
to the bat.
