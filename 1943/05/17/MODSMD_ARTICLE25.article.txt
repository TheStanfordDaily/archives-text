# There Is a War
## 
### 
THERE is a war going on. That is one of the profoundest state- !
ments ever made in the Stanford Daily, but even its triteness
and its obviousness can't make some people realize it.
, In time of war everyone and every institution has a job to do.
The job which Stanford has to do in this war is to train men and
women in the technical knowledge necessary to win the war
and the peace after the war. And it is Stanford's job to do it j
rapidly, while there still is a war.
Consequently, Stanford has gone on the four-quarter system.
Theoretically, Stanford has always been on the four-quarter sys
tem, but in practice nearly every one went to school for only
three quarters.
But that was in the "good old days."
Now Stanford is on the four-quarter system in practice as
well as in theory. The courses given this summer won't be like
those given every other quarter of the year.
And there will be a lot more students at Stanford during this
Summer Quarter. They will be going to school so that they can
aet through Stanford as quickly as possible, so they can go to j
work and do their part while there still is an emergency.
There are a lot of people, however, who still can't realize
that there is a war going on. They aren't going to summer school,
and they aren't going to work. They are just going to do nothing
for the whole summer. That's fun, and every single person at
Stanford this summer will wish that they were doing the same
thing—but there is a war going on, and the United States is in it.
