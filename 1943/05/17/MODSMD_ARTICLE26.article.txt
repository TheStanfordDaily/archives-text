The Editor, Sir:
A while back Excom, taking into consideration the war and
its effect upon sports at Stanford voted to make rugby a major
sport.
Since then there has been nothing but trouble and grief for
the members of the rugby team. According to some of them
whom I know well their letters were held up as long as possible
by Mr. Masters, and then he finally begrudgingly gave them.
However, he gave no Block "S" cards which accompany
each award. One of the players was picked up while hitch
hiking by an old Stanford athlete. Since the boy was wearing
his sweater the alumnus was interested in knowing all about
how it was won. Eventually he wanted to see the boys' block
"S" card and when there was none to show he accused the young
iugby player of stealing the sweater. Needless to say a good
ride was spoiled. This is not enough. The boy asked for a card
and Mr. Masters wouldn't give him one.
The same situation has come about with the managers, who
are not seniors. According to the players on the team they did
a fine job of taking care of the sport, but they will be given no
letter by Mr. Masters. Excom voted them special awards, bul
still Mr. Masters rufused to give them the awards they deserve.
If student government is of any worth at Stanford and nol
a joke to let Mr. Masters do as he pleases, the situation should be
xemedied. A Friend of the Rugby Team.
