## 
### 
Six hundred members of the Stanford "Family" in Northern California
j area attended a dinner last night in the Palace Hotel, San Francisco, honor-
I ing Dr. and Mrs. Donald B. Tresidder and Chancellor and Mrs. Kay Lyman

Wilbur. Dr. rresidder will succeed J
Dr. Wilbur as president of the Uni
versity on Sept. 1.
Foreseeing "the richest kind of fu
ture for the Pacific Coast" after the
war, Dr. Tresidder told the assem
bled guests that universities in this
area must take note of changes to
come and decide whether they are
going to walk backward into the
future, or whether they are going to
look forward and adjust themselves.
"My chief concern is with ideas
and men," he emphasized. "I am
concerned with trying to find the
kind of men who don't sacrifice the
real lessons of the past, who cling
I to those things that are proven, who
! have a clear eye about the things in
| the United States that have made us
j great."
More Than Victory
The president-elect told the Stan
lord group that victory is not all the
! Allies are fighting for.
"Victory is no guarantee that the
| liberty and the way of life that we
| all treasure is going to be restored
' to us," Dr. Tresidder declared. "And
; for that reason, now is the time for
; al 1 of us in civilian clothes to join
with those in the armed forces and

resolutely set our minds to say that
we will recover every liberty and j
every privilege to which we were
entitled before we entered this war. I
Stanford's present war contribu
tions were outlined by the president
elect during the talk. He revealed
that 900 men of the Army are now
at Stanford for testing and training
and more than 1,000 are expected by
the end of summer for training in
engineering, medicine, area and lan
guage studies, and personnel psy- j
chology.
Chancellor Wilbur, in his talk to
the Stanford groups, said that it had
been his privilege to know Stanford
intimately since its earliest days.
Academic Development
He pointed out that advantages
can be taken of changed conditions
for such developments in Stanford's |
academic program that it can keep in
the lead in higher education.
"When the soil is plowed deep the I
best crops are grown," Dr. Wilbur I
said, "This war will plow deep, but ]
it can provide many new educational
procedures if we stand willing to
i discard the less effective, the an
tique, the merely traditional, and
| take full advantage of the war
training experiences, and of the'
radio, the motion pictures, and tele
i vision."


DR. TRESIDDER
