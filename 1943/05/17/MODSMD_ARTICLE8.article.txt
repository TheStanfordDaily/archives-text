# Freshman Formal Open to Campus
## 
### 
Tickets went on sale this morning :
in the A.S.S.U. office for the Fresh- i
man Formal which is to be held next
Saturday night in the Women's Gym. i
As it is the last BIG dance of this or '
any other quarter (with the excep
tion of the exclusive Senior Ball), j
the freshman class has decided to let
it open to the exitire campus.
EncLnamen and non-Encinamen :
alike will pay $2 a couple to spend
an evening in the. atmosphere of a
cool, green glen, conforming with i
the theme of "Stanford in the :
Spring." Howard Fredericks and his j
orchestra and vocalist Marian Vallee i
will provide the music 'neath a false j
ceiling of live greens.
In connection with the dance, a
"Class of *46" picnic will be held in
the afternoon, but will be limited to I
frosh men and women only. It will !
bo a no-date affair for the purpose '
of introducing the new Encinamen !
to the Roble girls and to give the I
class one last get-together before '
Uncle Sam splits them up entirely, j
Student talent will furnish enter
tainment.
'Members of the STAR unit and the
training unit, since they are mem- !
bers of the student body, are also in- j
vited to attend this last of the big i
all-campus affairs for the Quarter.
