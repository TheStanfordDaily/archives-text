### (By United Press 
GENERAL MacARTHUR'S HEADQUARTERS, Australia, Tuesday, May
18 —An enemy submarine torpedoed and sank the clearly identified 3,200-
ton Australian Hospital Ship Centaur off eastern Australia early Friday, a
communique revealed today, and 299 persons are missing in the attack
which Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur described as one of "limitless savagery."

lhe hospital ship sank in two min
utes, it was announced. No pa
tients were aboard. Sixty-four sur
viors, adrift in waterlogged rafts for
36 hours, beat off sharks with planks
which were coated with red paint
from the Centaur's mercy symbol.
The Centaur was unescorted and
was brilliantly illuminated, head
quarters announced.
The submarine torpedo touched
off fuel tanks, turning the ship into
an inferno within a few seconds.
Many victims were burned to
death below decks. Others were
caught in oil slicks, killed by sharks,
or sucked under as the ship sank.
The Centaur was sunk 42 miles
east of Brisbane.
General Mac Arthur declared, "the
limitless savagery of the Centaur's
sinking represents a calculated at
tempt to create a sense of trepida
tion through the practice of horrors
designed to shock normal sensibili
ties."
