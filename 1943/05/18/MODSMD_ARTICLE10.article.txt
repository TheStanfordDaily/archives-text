MURAL TRACK MEET
Stanford nearly lost its intramural
track meet this quarter, and unless
the fraternities and eating groups
sign up in a hurry, the annual event
may still fall by the wayside.
The meet is scheduled for this
coming Friday afternoon out on An
gell Field with Track Coach Pitch
Johnson in charge. Teams planning
to enter should sign up in the Gym
immediately.
BK; MEET LEFTOVERS
Although they took a beating, the
Farm's track squad turned in sev
eral fine efforts over at Berkeley last
weekend, and ought to give the
Bears plenty of competition down
at the Fresno Relays this Saturday.
Topping the list of outstanding
Card performances were Bob Comp
ton's 4:24.7 mile and Willard Smith's
mark of six feet five inches in the
high jump. m
Compton shielded himself from
the wind behind Cal's Terry Ring for
three and a half laps, then sprinted
around the Bear ace on the last turn
to win easily. It was the best mile
race Bob has ever run.
Smith's six feet, five inch jump
was a new record for the Stanford
captain. Willy will be aiming at"six
six" this Saturday.
Glen Holtby, Wayne Girdner, and
Martin Anderson also hit the best
marks of their careers in the Big
Meet. Holtby and Girdner were
caught by Johnson in 1:57 when they
tied for second in the SBO. Anderson
got over 12 feet, 6 inches to tie for
second in the pole vault.
Johnny Fulton also turned in the
best effort of his career in the 440.
Bucking a rough wind most of the
way, Johnny hustled the quarter in
48.1. a tenth of a second better than
he's ever done. Fulton had some
unexpected competition from Cal's
Jim Dunn, who was only three
strides back at the finish.
