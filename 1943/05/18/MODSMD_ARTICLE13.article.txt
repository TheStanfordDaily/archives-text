# REVIEW
## Mrs. Holliday Stars Deanna 
### 
"The Amazing Mrs. Holliday,"
now playing at the Mayfield and
Menlo theaters, stars Deanna Durbin
in her first picture in a year. In it
Deanna is a missionary's daughter
who flees from war-torn China to
San Francisco with nine war or
phans of all nationalities.
It is in this role that she wins the
sympathy of the audience, not in the
role of the secret wife of Comman
der Holliday. Her fans will un
doubtedly enjoy hearing her sing
"Visi D'Arte" by Puccini, Kreisler's
'An Old Refrain," a Chinese ver
sion of "Rock-a-Bye-Baby," and
"Mighty Lak' a Rose."
The plot of the Amazing Mrs. Hol
liday is improbable and scenes of
Deanna conversing with Chinese
coolies in Chinese are far fetched.
However, the simplicity of the chil
dren, the Chinese baby, the Italian
boy who fears airplanes, and the
English gil ls, together with Deanna's
excellent portrayal, make the pic
ture an enjoyable one.
Selected short features replace a
companion feature, and the newsreel
contains captured Jap films on the
bombing of Pearl Harbor.â€”O'Don
