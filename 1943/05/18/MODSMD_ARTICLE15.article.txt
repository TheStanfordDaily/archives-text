# Senior Announcements
## 
### 
The deadline for ordering senior
announcements and programs has
been moved from today to Friday,
May 21. It is urged that all seniors
go to the Bookstore before time
as failure to do so will amount to
a large loss to the class treasury.
The formal graduation an
nouncements cost 10 cents apiece
and the leather-bound programs,
a dollar.
