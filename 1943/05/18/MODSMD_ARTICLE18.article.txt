Files for Soldiers
REALIZING that many of the soldiers on the campus have re
cently come from other colleges with which they would like
to keep in touch, The Stanford Daily invites them to make use of
its files.
Current college newspapers of the West Coast colleges are
kept on file, and publications from leading universities across the
country are received daily. In current files are the Daily Bruin,
Oregon Emerald, Daily Californian, Daily Trojan, University of
Washington Daily, St. Mary's Collegian, and Washington State
Evergreen.
Although the Daily Shack possesses no spacious reading
room, soldiers are welcome to make use of available chairs and
tables, and browse through newspapers of their choice. The
Shack is open every afternoon and evening except Friday and
Saturday. Members of the staff will be glad to locate files for
service men.—Jane Glasson
