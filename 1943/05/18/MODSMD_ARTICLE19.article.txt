### CYCLONE COVEY 
A little girl in the Convalescent Home once wrote Mrs. Tim
othy Hopkins, who was ill: "We hope you have as nice a place
to be ill in as we have."
In the most recovery-conducive atmosphere, 40 boys and 40
girls, at one time, are convalescing from a variety of afflictions.
The "runabouts," who are able to be out of bed part time —
and among them are some whose cases were once judged hope
less—, attend the Home schoolroom and play on the playground.
Those who cannot loave their beds are rolled onto sun
porches, when there is a sun; and they are instructed in school
work at their bedsides. One room of kindergarten pupils becomes
a concert hall for a while every day or so, when each patient takes
up an instrument and swings out.
There are parties every holiday, and the comely Chi-O's put
on an egg hunt every Easter. Magicians and puppet shows also
entertain at intervals. What is most exciting for the kids, however,
is the Stanford band and other noise on Labor Day, when several
hundred students trek over and take up plowshares and paint
brushes and are given a barbecue by "Big Sam" McDonald and
entertainment by Ram's Head.
No other college campus in the nation, so far as anybody here
abouts has been able to discover, maintains a charity on its
grounds. The drive now in progress on campus, together with
proceeds from the Carnival, Punch, etc., will probably provide a
iour-bed endowment for a year; and Labor Day saves such an op
erating expense that it is necessary for but one caretaker to be
hired the year round.
