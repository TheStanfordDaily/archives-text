"The non-deferable list does not
include any students," Dean John
Bunn announced yesterday after
receiving an answer to his inquiry
from the War Manpower Com
mission. "Men in 4F may be re
considered for classification in 1A
at any time but only on physical
grounds."
This means, he said, that a stu
dent will not be reclassified be
cause he is a law student instead
of an engineering student, or in
engineering student instead of a
worker in a war factory. Students
will be reclassified on physical
grounds only.
