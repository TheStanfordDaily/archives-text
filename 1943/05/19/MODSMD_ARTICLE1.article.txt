# American Forces Reach Main Attu Jap Defenses
## 
### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, May 18—America's invasion forces have reached the
main Japanese defenses on Attu Island and are fighting fiercely for a key
mountain pass blocking final conquest of that, fogbound north Pacific out
post, the Navy disclosed today.
Big guns of the fleet are laying down a supporting bombardment as two

American columns drive toward a'
junction, ready to trap the Japs in
the jaws of a pincer.
An American victory appears
near.
At the same time, the Navy dis
closed new offensive blows in other
theaters of the far flung Pacific
front—a bomber attack against Jap
held Wake Island and another aerial
thrust against enemy positions in
the Solomons.
At least two of 22 Jap Zeros
which sought to intercept the big
lour-motored Liberator bombers
over Wake Island were destroyed.
Another was probably destroyed.
