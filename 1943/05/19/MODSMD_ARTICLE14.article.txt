# 'Charley's Aunt' and Olio Acts Travel to Belmont Tonight
## 
### 
For their seventh and final off-campus performance, the Stanford Players
lake their traveling version of "Charley's Aunt" to an audience of Belmont
soldiers tonight. The comedy will open here on May 27.
"We chose this play," says Director David Sievers, "on the theory that a
good elderly joke is funnier than a thin new one.

' 'Charley s Aunt can be com
pared to few other plays written in
the Nineties. It is funny because the
situations are genuinely funny, not
because they seem ridiculously
quaint to moderns. It could be plaj'fed
in modern costumes at high noon in
a cornfield and still bo funny," Siev
ers continued.
Accompanying the players to Bel
mont tonight are several olio num
bers from the Spring Show.
Nan Tillson is going along to sing
"Oceana Roll," and "Don't Go in
the Lion's Cage Tonight." Janice
Shaughnessy will perform her swing
version of "Why Don't You Play
With Me," and Natalie Towle and
â€¢Jean Levinson will i'e-enact their
olio, "Splash Me."
The "can-can" number from the
Spring Show will also dance for the
soldiers, featuring Janice Shaugh
nessy, Joan Hubbard, Joyce Peck
ham, Jacques Poley-Ogg, Pat Ann
de Vere Jones, Gloria Olivi, Mary
Buckner, and Luana Forkner.
