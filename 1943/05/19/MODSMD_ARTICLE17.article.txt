### 
"If I had not been born in China I
would have preferred to be an ac
tress',' said American-trained law
yer, Cecilia Zung, last night on the
Tuesday Evening Series program,
"but my family would not let me.
An actress today in China is an out
cast and respectable families do not
consider it as a profession for their
members."
Dr. Zung came very near to ful
filling that desire before the Series
audience however when she donned
several of the conventional Chinese
costumes and using their graceful
and meaningful gestures performed
a scene from her own play. She
sang several Chinese songs, whose
charm was not entirely lost on her
attentive western audience.
"The most typical thing about the
Chinese drama is what westerners
most commonly misunderstand," she
said. "The peculiar use of props al
lows a chair, according to the posi
tion it lakes, to represent a jail, a
wall, a hill, or, when an actor mounts
it and runs off the stage, a well that
he just jumped down to commit
suicide."
In closing Dr. Zung expressed the
hope that our two countries now
joined in righteous comradeship of
arms" would join hands together
"into eternity to further our friend
ship in culture as well as in politics,
and especially through the drama.
