student dance of this quarter at the
Senior Ball June 11. The ball will
be held in the Women's Clubhouse
and on a platform in Union Court,
according to George Hellyer, co
chairman of the dance committee.
'Blackout, of 1943" will be the

During the dance from 1 to 4 a.m.,
a big breakfast of non-rationed food

long after the class has scattered in
all directions from the campus.
"With an advance view of the danec
committee plans I think this ball will
be a ftting conclusion to four years
at Stafford," said Geori* Hellyer.
