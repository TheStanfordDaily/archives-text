# Thursday Defense Drill Scheduled
## 
### 
First civilian defense drill of the
quarter has been scheduled for
Thursday night at 7:15 by A1 Mas
ters, chairman of the Civilian De
fense Council.
All civilian defense personnel must
be at their posts at 7:15, Masters
said. Since the drill cannot cover
all areas some defense workers will
not be called upon, but they must
report, he stated. Those who are not
given instructions by 7:30 may as
sume that they are relieved and may
leave their posts.
The defense drill has been sched
uled late this quarter because of the
necessity of reorganizing the defense
set-up eliminating members of the
R.O.T.C. who were in charge of many
posts in previous drills.
