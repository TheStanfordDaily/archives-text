## Tom Ashley Leads Theta Chi's To 14-9 Victory Over Phi Psi's 
### 
Theta Chi's Tom Ashley put on one of the top hitting exhibitions of this
quarter's mural softball competition yesterday in leading his teammates
to a 14-9 win over the Phi Psi's.
Ashley hit three homeruns and drove 10 counters across the plate during
the contest. Harry Boothe was on the mound for the winners; Rock Sheller
was the losing pitcher. â™¦

l)ekes Win
The Dekes and D.U.'s kept pace '
with each other by turning in easy !
victories over A.K.L. and Sigma Nu
respectively. The Dekes slaughtered
their rivals, 16-3. Jack Clark was
the winning inoundsman, while Hap
Everett stole fielding honors with
his work around second base.
Bob Barsocchini pitched the D.U.
club to a 13-4 win over the Sigma
Nu's. D.U. has lost only one game
in league competition.
Kappa Sig defeated the Alpha
Delts in a 5 o'clock game, but there
seems to be a difference of opinion
as to the final score. Alpha Delt
claims it was 10-8, while the Kappa
Sigs maintain it was 18-7. Bud
O'Neil was the winning pitcher;
we're sure of that.
Chi Psi, 9-7
Chi Psi ran into a supposedly weak
Kappa Alpha ten, but managed to
eke out a 9-7 win. Bob Morrison
pitched for the Chi Psi's, while Lee
Sweat hit a homerun for the win
ners.
Although they pounded the ball
all over the lot, the Zetes couldn't
hit when it counted and barely beat
the Chem. club, 1-0. Corky Schrei
ber and Johnny Eikelman composed
the Zete battery.
S.A.I'!. Loses
Theta Delt barely nosed out SA.E.
in the day's slugfest, 11-10. Greek
Gasich was the winning pitcher,
Brudie the loser. Beta forfeited to
Sigma Chi in the other game sched
uled.
On the mural track front, plans
went ahead yesterday to hold the
annual meet this Friday afternoon
on Angell Field.
