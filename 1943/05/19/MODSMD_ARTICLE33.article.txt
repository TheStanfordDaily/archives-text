# What We Can Give
## 
### 
STANFORD students have been asked to give money, buy tags,
consume refreshments this week for the benefit of the Stan
ford Convalescent Home.
Today we are asked to do more than take a few minutes, to
give money, or be entertained. We are asked to do good, honest,
hard work. This afternoon we should pull weeds, hoe, rake, and
paint to improve conditions at the Home.
It is fairly easy to give money, especially if it is not too hard
to get. It is another thing to give time and energy and sweat.
Labor Day at the Conavlescent Home this afternoon will in a
measure prove Stanford's devotion to its own charity, a Home for
underprivileged children recuperating from serious illnesses.
In reality, Stanford students contribute very little money for
the maintenance of the Home, although every little bit helps.
The one thing that only we can give is our work, our labor. The
Home depends on us exclusively each Spring to clean-up and
improve the conditions of the grounds.
This afternoon we can wait until barbecue time and then
saunter out to the Convalescent Home to enjoy a meal and a
jolly-up. Or we can go out early and work together in gangs and
do the jobs which we are depended on to do.
This is our big chance to give. Let's not overlook it.—Jane
Glasson.
