### 
THE Women's Gym has reported the theft of three wrist
watches and S4l in cash, as well as identification cards, taker
from lockers during the last two weeks.
Not as a means of correcting ways of thieves, but as a pro
tection to women students, Police Chief Gordon Davis has urgec
that all lockers be locked when not in use.
Although a locked locker will not make a dishonest persoi
honest, it will remove the possibility for theft and prevent th<
less of valuables to women students.â€”Jane Glasson
