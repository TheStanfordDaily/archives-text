Before a person can enjoy and thoroughly understand Bull
Session, it is absolutely necessary that he understand the precise
meaning and real significance of the name. It is to that end that
today's column is dedicated.
The word "bull," according to the first choice in Funk and
Wagnalls Standard Dictionary, means the male of domestic cattle
01 of some other animal such as elephant, moose, giraffe, etc.,
while the meaning of "session" is given as the sitting together of
an organized body for the transaction of business. Without think
ing, it could easily be assumed that a bull session is the getting
together of an organized herd of male cattle to transact some
business.
That is not the case. One must probe further.
It is apparent that the term refers at least partly to people
because the phrase is only used by people, and, strangely
enough, only by English-speaking people. With that in mind,
the revised definition of a bull session reads, "A sitting together
of an organized body of people and bulls to transact business."
Now for a stretch of the imagination. If people and bulls
were to get together for a period of time, someone would surely
become careless someday and wear something red. In the en
suing action, one of two things would happen.
1. The bull would throw the person.
2. The person would throw the bull.
The second choice is highly improbable and if anyone were
to describe such happenings, he would be told that it was just
a whim of his imagination.
From that, the final definition of a bull session is evolved.
"A bull session is the getting together of people, bulls, or
anything else that happens to be around, to give vent to the
whims of the imagination."
There are, however, some people who believe that the deri
vation of the term comes from a different origin.
