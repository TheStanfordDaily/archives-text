### 
Dr. Ann Magaret spoke at a meet
ing of the Student-Faculty Forum
, Sunday in Lagunita on "Questions
! for Tomorrow," in which she dis
-1 cussed the attitude we will have to
; take toward our enemies after the
i war. She pointed out that we need a
motivation after we have won the
war in order to make the peace. At
the present time our goal is to win
j the war, and when this is achieved,
many will feel that the job is fin
! ished.
To prevent an isolationist policy,
we should direct our aggressive and
nationalistic tendencies toward an
I international organization which will
hold the loyalty of the whole world,
for the individual can identify him
self with a larger group and still be
loyal to his own group, thus. Dr.
Magaret illustrated, an individual
can be loyal to his own nation and
, still be more loyal to an interna
tional organization.
