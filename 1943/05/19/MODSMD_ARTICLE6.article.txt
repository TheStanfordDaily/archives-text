# Carnival To End Con Home Drive
## 
### 
I Stanford will enjoy itself—and at
j the same time make its last contribu
tion to the 1943 Convalescent Home
I Drive—when the sophomores stage
their annual Carnival in the Pavilion
from 7:30 to 12 Friday night.
Relying upon the same informality
that has keynoted previous Carni
vals, sophomores this year will pre
sent an array of fun making in 24
booths in the Pavilion and vicinity,
according to Jack Shields and Wright
Cortner, co-chairmen of the con
struction committee.
Sophomores from each living
group should turn in their plans for
their booths in order that an ar
rangement can be made, and some
sophomores from each group should
be on hand Friday afternoon to dec
orate their concessions, according to
Tom Morton, chairman of the Car
nival.
Latest additions to the long lists of
booths and concessions came from
the fraternities. The Zetes an
nounced that they were having a
"surprise" booth, while the K.A.'s
plan on sponsoring a water bag
throwing booth with their pledges
as the goats. The D.U.'s will give
away baby ducks to anyone who can
I throw a ring or. one.
Chi O's will test the ability of all
i comers with their usual candle ex
; tinguishing wth squirt guns, while
Lagunita will # sponsor the coke con
i cession and the Kappas will sell
i pop corn balls.
