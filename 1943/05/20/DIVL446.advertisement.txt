"Sure it's a swell Arrow Tic —
hut what will the Admiral say?"'
What dot's anyone say when lie sees an Arrow Tie?
He savs, swell!"—For several reasons. Arrows
are good-looking, in smart patterns and neat stripes.
Arrows are made well, willi a special lining cut on
the bias to resist wrinkles, and to see that they
make perfect knots. Arrows are made ol fine fabrics
—wear longer, for Army and ISavy men as well as
civilians—at your Arrow dealers, SI and 51.50.
