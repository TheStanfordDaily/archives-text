Forty Stanford junior U.S.O. host
\ esses who are trekking to Hidden
Villa near Los Altos this week-end j
| have high hopes for as much excite-
I ment as a recent week-end provided.
The Hidden Villa proved as se
| cret as its name when, for the sec- i
ond time since these co-operative
I parties started for Bay Area service j
! men, the Navy ran true to form. It
j seems that to them land maps are
but worthless scraps of paper. Four
| sailors from San Francisco became
, lost in the wilds of the Los Altos
: countryside with nary a compass
between them.
The Stanford hostesses, still full
j of hope, phoned madly to locate the
missing sailors. They finally gave
up when bribed by promises of a
i hay ride out to the ranch.
Meanwhile, the preliminary phon- j
ing had not been in vain, and when j
the hayriders disembarked at the j
hostel, the countryside reported that j
the sailors had been sighted 30 miles
j away, and should be in by barbecue
J time.
Before the barbecue the hostesses
tried milking some cows, and then ;
took a swim in the ranch pool. The j
J dinner gong interrupted their swim, I
; and a report came in that the four
! sailors had drifted in.
Although the sailors were ex-
I hausted they soon recovered, just in i
time for the square dancing.
These country week-ends will !
continue all summer, and women j
| from Stanford are recruited from {
| the junior hostesses and others who
have done U.S.O. work.

Senator Stanford owned the Vina !
Ranch of 55.000 acres, which had the
largest vineyard in the world.
