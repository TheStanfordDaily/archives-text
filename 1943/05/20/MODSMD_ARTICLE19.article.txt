# R. O. Men Get Strong Taste of G.I. Routine
## 
### Don Shannon, Pvt. A.U. S 
It was 6:15 a.m. when four Army trucks left the R.O.T.C. headquarters
Monday morning, carrying Stanford's second group contribution to the
Army this quarter, 48 members of the Second Year Advanced Course and
four E.R.C. men. At 11:30 yesterday morning, the same group returned
from Monterey, grizzled veteran:? completely G.1.-equipped, hefting denim
duffle bags from the trucks. â™¦

The rapid transformation was a
minor miracle, since the process I
usually takes about three days.
Prime factors in this achievement
were an aggressive sergeant and a
rigid time schedule.
Receiving the former cadets in
the morning sunshine, the above
mentioned noncommissioned officer
(lashed a genial smile, then bellowed.
"All right, you guys. Shut up and
get going."
From the time of arrival until
taps, the new soldiers had exactly
15 minutes of free time, a quick trip
to the Post Exchange. First on the
schedule was the filling out of the
official records. They then went
through a new mental test, a me
chanical aptitude test, and a radio
operators' test.
Real Butter
After actually tasting butter at ;
lunch, the group went back to the j
process of classification, which was j
done even though the men are sup- |
posed to be sent to the Officer's Can- !
didate School at Fort Sill at the end !
of this quarter. Interviews finished, i
the unit started through the cloth
ing line.
Starting out with civilian clothing j
in the bottom of a duffle bag, each j
man rapidly accumulated one blouse, I
two suits of both wool and cotton, '
two ties, one overcoat, one field j
jacket, *>ne raincoat, two pairs of
shoes, etc., etc. But the prize ac- !
quisition of the day was a "com
mando-type" helmet, in which ev- i
eryone became unreconizably mili- '
tary.
Immediately after staggering out >
under GO pounds of equipment, the
recruits doubletimed over to the dis
pensary for a blood type classifica
tion and a tetanus shot, administered
by an obese sadist. Only three or
four passed out.
Next event was a post prandial
discussion on the benefits of insur
ance, followed by the signing up of
all members for the $10,000 govern
ment insurance plan. Returning to
barracks, everyone learned to make
their beds from a Southern corporal,
who showed them "how it was did."
After receiving "dog tags," metal
labels with pertinent data, every
body went to bed at 10 p.m.
Sometime in the middle of the
night, lights went on and reveille was
played over a loudspeaking system.
Tearing themselves from their cots,
the occupants cleaned up the bar
racks and went to breakfast.
With a fond farewell to the ser
geant. the unit climbed into the
trucks while some member of the
Santa Clara R.O.T.C. called derisive
ly: "I hope they send you to Cali
fornia."
Stanford has thus far had 376 of
its former matriculates listed in
Who's Who in America, 36 of them
women. After Ohio Wesleyan. Stan
lord's Who's Who rate is highest of
the 1.500 colleges in the United
States.
