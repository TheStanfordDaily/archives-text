# SENIOR BALL
## 'Blackout of '43' To Be Theme 
### 
Breakfast will be served from 1 to 4 a.m. at the Senior Ball, June 11. The
refreshments committee of Moofie Faris and Joan Hill has obtained a
menu for a breakfast that will be an unusual and welcomt sight in these
days of rationing and high food prices.
The breakfast will consist of tomato juice or applesauce, scrambled

eggs, buttered toast, cinnamon toast,
coffee with cream and sugar, and hot,
chocolate.
Another feature of this dance,
which will be decorated with the
theme of "Blackout of 1943," is
Gary Nottingham's orchestra, well
known to all Stanford students. The
ball will begin at 10 p.m. and con
tinue with fun and entertainment
for all until 4 a.m.
Bids for the Blackout Ball will go
on sale Monday in the A.S.S.U. of
fice for $6 apiece. Seniors and jun
iors are all urged to obtain their
bids as soon as possible in order that
arrangements may be completed.
