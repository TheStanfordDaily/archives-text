# Culbertson Plan Discussion Will Be Held Monday Night
## 
### 
The public of this community will
be given an opportunity to hear and
take part in a discussion of the Ely
Culbertson World Federation Plan
lext Monday night at 7:30 in the
Education Auditorium.
The Culbertson plan, although es
sentially a plan for the maintenance
of a permanent peace after this war,
jS so formulated that it could be put
partially into effect immediately. In
this manner, the war would come to
an end not by a peace treaty, but by
the cessation of hostilities as each
of the warring nations agreed to
oin the Federation and abide by its
constitution.
The speakers will be Professor
Warren Allen, Professor Eliot Black
welder, Professor B. Q. Morgan, and
Professor Graham Stuart. The chair
nan, who will invite the audience
to ask questions and participate in
the discussion following the ten
minute speeches, will be Professor
Edwin Cottrell, of the political sci
ence department, which is sponsor
ing the forum.
Dr. Allen, whose book "Our
Marching Civilization," about to be
xiublished by the Stanford Press, in

cludes many ideas which coincide
with those of Culbertson, will dis- !
cuss the federation concept of the
plan. Dr. Allen regards the Cul
bertson conception of the World i
Federation as a cluster of planets j
revolving about a central sun as j
one of the most brilliant develop
ments in political theory in 100
years.
Dr. Blackwelder will discuss mat
ters involving the regional divisions
from the point of view of the re- I
gions, which have been made up so
that neighboring countries with the :
most, in common are in the same !
region.
Dr. Morgan will discuss the world
security aspect of the organization j
of the federation. Advocating the j
dual system of policing by both a
mobile corps belonging to the fed
eration and manned with soldiers
from the small powers and the
standing armies of the initial mem
bers of the Federation, Dr. Morgan
believes that there can be no civili
zation in the world without a means
of restraining the international
gangster.
Dr. Stuart, a personal friend of
Ely Culbertson, has an intimate
first-hand knowledge of the devel
opment of the plan and will dis
cuss the criticisms and difficulties
which the plan is facing.
Copies of the plan are available in
the Stanford and Palo Alto Libra
ries and Dr. Morgan's office, and will
be on sale at the forum.
