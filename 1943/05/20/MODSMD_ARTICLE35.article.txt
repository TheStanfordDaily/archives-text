# Class Cancels Frosh Picnic
## 
### 
The freshman picnic, scheduled
for Saturday afternoon, has been
called ofi' because of difficulty in get
ting food and for lack of a place to
hold the affair.
Excommittee refused permission
to hold the picnic at Searsville Lake
as was oiiginally planned, but of
fered to reserve the entire boathouse
for the freshmen on Saturday af
ternoon. However, the main reason
for the cancellation is the difficulty
of getting food for as large a group.
The picnic was to have been much
like the pre-reg barbecue last year
on Freshman Hillâ€”a no-date affair,
with food and entertainment aplenty.
