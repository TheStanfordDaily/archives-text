"We have three more weeks to go
over the top in the stamp drive,"

an investment to buy a stamp. There
has been some complaint that only
15-cent stamps are offered for sale,
And tomorrow 10-cent stamps will
also be available on the Quad and in
the living groups."
Miss Hurwitz also announced that
r.ext Tuesday at 5 in the Women's
Clubhouse there will be a meeting
of all the stamp salesmen on campus.
This includes sorority, fraternity,
hall, and booth salesmen, and she
urged everyone to be present.
