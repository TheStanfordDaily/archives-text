# Roble Girls Donate Toys To Con Home
## 
### Bb Vicky Sellens 
It was not hard to donate money
to the convalescent drive, it was
pleasant to drink strawberry punch j
jin the cool atmosphere of Union
j Court with gay music in the back- !
ground; oven physical labor at the i
j Convalescent Home was fun; but the
! sacrifice that was hard to make for
I Roble girls was the parting with the
i little toy animals which had sat
j upon their beds.
When the announcement was j
made at dinner that the children
at the Convalescent Home did not
have enough toys to play with and j
that all the girls were urged to con- j
tribute their animals, a gasp of in- {
credulity went around the room.
"'Give up Bambi? Why I couldn't
j do ihat!"
But Tuesday evening the senators
1 canvassed the corridors and sad- j
faced girls bade farewell to their !
J wooly lambs, downy ducks, and soft
! elephants, although some girls took
j their.toys to bed with them that
night and turned them in yesterday
j morning.
It is only hoped that the little girls j
! at the convalescent home lavish as
j much affection on their new toys as
j the little girls at Roble have given
| them.
