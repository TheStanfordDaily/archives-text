## 
### 
The first civilian defense drill of
the quarter has been scheduled lor
tonight, with members of civilian
defense auxiliary services ordered to
report to their posts promptly at
7:15, according to A1 Masters, de
fense director.
Evacuation of several women's liv
ing groups, which will come as a
surprise to the residents, have been
included among the eight incidents
planned for the drill.
R.O.T.C. men, the fire-fighting
squad, will report to the Firehouse
and will be sent on assignments
from there, Masters said. Since the
R.O.T.C. on campus has been re
duced to 80 men from 500, it was
impossible to station crews at stra
tegic spots on campus, but Masters
said the new centralized system
would afford equally good protec
tion.
Although all civilian defense

workers must report to their posts at
7:15, not all of them will be needed
in the drill. Masters said that those
who had not received their orders by
7:30 would be free to leave their sta
tions.
