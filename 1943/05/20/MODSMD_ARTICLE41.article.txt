# Doubles Finals Come Tuesday
## 
### 
Though seeded number one in the
all-University mixed doubles, the
combination of Sis Larkin and Dick
Thomas had a tough time pulling
through the semi-finals against Gin
ny May and Chuck Hutchinson.
While this was going on, Barbara
Brooke and Jim Redding had little
trouble in trouncing Beverly Hum
phries and Emery Rogers in straight
sets.
All indications point to a well
fought finals match next Tuesday
afternoon at the varsity tennis
courts. The winning team will be
presented with a Roos Brothers' cup
with their names engraved on it. Sis
Larkin is trying to make it two years
in a row as she won it last year
teamed with Emery Neale.
All those interested in the finals
match should come early for good
seats as there is every indication of
a well-played, hard-fought tennis
match.
The results of the matches were as
follows:
Larkin-Thomas d. IVlay-Hutchi
son. 6-4, 4-6, 6-4.
Brooke-Redding d. Humphries-
Rogers, 6-1. 6-1.
NEW YORK, May 20 (UP).â€”Pro

mittee that might be appointed to
guide the wartime condition of ath
letics.
