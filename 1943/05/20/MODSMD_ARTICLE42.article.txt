### Late Williams 
Last Saturday at California, while
the track and baseball teams of the
Farm were being treated to defeats,
a newly formed team of six Card
freshmen were beating a highly
favored frosh tennis organization of
the Bears, 7-2.
The score itself does not make this
accomplishment anything out of this
world, but the fact that Stanford, up
until a few days before the match
was plyaed, didn't have a frosh team,
does.
It seems that Bob Keenan, Walker
Wallace, Jerry Golby, George Lizsey,
Bud Provost, and Jack Shultz de
cided that they wanted to meet Cal's
team this year, frosh team or no
"rosh learn. t
The first thing that they acquired
was a sanction from A1 Masters that
allowed them to compete for Stan
ford, and they followed this up with
an agreement with Cal.
The Bears must have had high
hopes as they sent their hitherto un
defeated frosh club against an In
dian squad that had not had a match
all season, but after watching tennis
balls going by them all afternoon,
they finally came down to earth,
facing the fact that they had only
won two matches.
Keenan handled the number one
singles for our men. and although
he played his heart out, he dropped
his match by a slim margin.
Wallace, Golby, and Lizsey fol
lowed in that order, taking their op
ponents down the line before they
knew what hit them. Shultz, who
played number five man, came up
against a little too much competi
tion, but as far as the Cal team was
concerned, that was all brother.
INTRAMURALS
If Harry Wolter, erstwhile Stan
ford baseball coach, would drop
around and see some of the intra
mural softball games, he would
probably cash in his chips and take
ihe "Sioux City Flyer" for points
east.
It's not that the boys don't get in
and play the game as it should be
playedâ€”most of the time, but if any
thing ever happened that would
bring the coach screaming out of
the dugout, it happens daily on the
mural fields. Three men ending up
on ihe same base at the same time,
men stealing second, third, and home
when the ball has been juggled
around lor about five minutes; it all
happens. Ah well, anything for
laughs.
