# Baseball Team Meets Stockton Field Today
## 
### 
Continuing their post-season games with service teams, Stanford's bast
ball team goes to bat at 2:30 today against the fliers from Stockton Fief
The game will be played on the Sunken Diamond.
This is the second in a series of contests that the Indians are playing I
finish out the current season.
In the first encounter, the Farm men triumphed easily over the nil

from Fort Winfield Scott. 11-2. Dick*
Flatland and Jack Miller handled
the hurling assignment. Flatland was
not removed because of trouble, but
merely to allow Miller to limber up.
The Red team was in front all the
way and had little trouble climbing
onto the slants of the soldier pitchers
and amassing a large total of runs.
The game featured the return to
the lineup of Jack Brownson, regu
lar second baseman, who has been
on the sidelines all during league
play due to his ineligible status. He
turned in a fine performance both in
field and at the plate.
The same lineup should start the
game today, although Harry Wolter,
Card coach, plans to use as many
players as possible. He will un
doubtedly send Dick Flatland to the
hill again, saving Jack Miller for
fireman duty if the need arises. Doc-
Mason may throw if his back, injured
earlier in the season, is able to take
the strain.
In the field Wolter should start
Howie Dallmar at first, Jack Brown
son at second, Bob Brown at short
stop, and Jay McKie at third. With
this combination Stanford has one of
the tightest fielding outfits in the
league, as well as a strong team at
the plate with Brown leading in the
hitting.
The outfield should shape up with
Lloyd Merriman in center, Keith
Pinion in right, and Bill Cunha in
left. Merriman has been doing an
excellent job since he was switched
to the outer gardens when Dallmar
arrived to take over the initial sack
assignment.
The lineup will be completed by
Ward Walkup behind the plate.
Ward has been turning in marvelous
performances all season long, and
today should be no exception. Walk
up has been elected acting captain
for the Reds this year, replacing the
missing Duke Hammett who has en
tered the armed services.
Coach Wolter's men, who finished
third in the league with a record of
five wins and seven losses for the
season, will be out to continue the
winning streak against service teams.
