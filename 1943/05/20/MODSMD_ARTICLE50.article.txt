# Are Major Sports Valid?
## 
### 
THE trouble that rugby's becoming a major
sport has caused brings to mind the question
as to how valid are major sports.
There seems to be no justification for having
major and minor sports. Although football and
possibly basketball pay for themselves, we all
agree that this should not be the standard for
awarding a Block S.
If the letters are given on the amount of time
devoted by the student to practice, our present
system falls down. The minor sports swimmer,
the minor sports golfer both spend as much time
as the major sport baseball and basketball
player.
On the amount of physical exercise, the pres
ent system again falls down. To the 125 light
weight boxer, his sport is as beneficial as is play
ing guard on the football team.
All competitors should be given equal awards
for excellence in their own particular field. Some
should not get major letters and others who work
just as hard or harder receive minor letters.
