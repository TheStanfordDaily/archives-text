# Just a Small Favor
## 
### 
THE DAILY in the past has usually run an edi
torial about smoking on the Quad when
ever there was nothing more pressing. This edi
torial will be the only one in Volume 103 dis
cussing smoking on the Quad.
It has been our belief that it doesn't make a
tremendous amount of difference one way or the
other if a person smokes on the Quad. There is
no rule to enforce and there should be none. It
is a favor like maintaining quiet around a hos
pital.
For all the money and hope and faith that Mrs.
Stanford gave to University, the simple request
that we do not smoke on Quad seems small
enough.
It is an old and a good traditionâ€”just a favor,
but a rather reasonable one to fulfill.
