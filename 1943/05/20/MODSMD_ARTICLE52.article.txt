# Thanks to the Soldiers
## 
### 
ALREADY, returns from various phases of the
Convalescent Home Drive have reached
unexpected peaks. Despite the shrinkage in the
number of students, in some cases, more money
has been collected than in past years.
Perhaps some of this increase can be attrib

uted to the soldiers on campus, who have gen
erously given their support to our drive.
Girls who sold tags on Tag Day reported that
many soldiers got into the spirit of the day and
flaunted a tag on their uniforms. Many of them
gave more than a dime and did not ask for
change, and others dug out their last pennies
for the benefit of the Convalescent Home.
Other soldiers contributed to the Drive by
giving the dollar they received from taking part
in cardio-vascular tests. These experiments
were hard work. But they gave their money.
Besides giving their money, the soldiers
worked hard on Labor Day at the Convalescent
Home yesterday, too. In the afternoon, some
of them hoed and raked with the students. And
others drove the Army trucks which hauled stu
dents out to the grounds and back.
So we can say, thanks to the soldiers, as well
as regular students, this year's Convalescent
Home Drive is already a success, even though
the week is not yet completed.-â€”Jane Glasson
