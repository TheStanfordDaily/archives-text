# Woe, the 'Nitery Habit'
## 
### 
A LOT of encouragement and Stanford fi- j
nally caught on and got the "Nitery habit." !
A far cry from past years is the scene in the j
well-populated social room. Yes, Stanford has
the "Nitery habit."
But some people, like various heads of the 1
student government, now are worried because,
the "Nitery habit" has gone too far. Students I
seem to be enjoying the social room to too
great an extent. They're carrying parts of it j
away with them.
The fireplace is still there, the heavy pieces
of furniture remain. But light bulbs, ash trays,
and other small, indispensable knick-knacks
have been disappearing.
For obvious reasons, this is very discourag-'
ing to those student leaders who have made the
present "Nitery habit" possible. They want the
room and its facilities to remain available to
anyone who drops in. They'd like to keep the
fixtures from leaving.â€”Jane Glasson
