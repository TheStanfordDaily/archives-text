### CYCLONE COVEY 
It was a clear moonshining night atter the i
Labor Day festivities that I cycled dutifully to
that edifice which is a late example of the Roman
esque revival, intent on indulging a diligent j
hour in study for Farmer's test.
At first I thought the establishment had closed
for lack of help, but I found a door open and went
inside. For some minutes I stood waiting for my
eyes to become accustomed to the dark, then
sidled cautiously leftward, tapping my stick.
Cracking my shins left and right, I arrived in
time within a large room, where I heard voices, j
This proved one of two things; either the place
was open for business, or it was haunted.
I pounded on the counter and yelled in a'
clear, high tenor: "Service! Service!"
"Oh, shut your trap," the lady behind the j
counter came back.
Shutting my trap, I decried a figure in the !
shadows calling out in a raucous, nasal chant: !
"Flashlights! Get your flashlights here. Can't
tell nothing without a flashlight."
I got a flashlight (50 cents, of which 25 cents
is covered by the community fees), and flashed
it behind the counter to see what was the delay.
The lady was arguing with a fragile Stanford
woman. Said the lady to the customer: "That
book is not on reserve; you'll have to go up
stairs."
"Go upstairs?" the girl choked. "Come go
with me then."
"Don't be silly," said the lady behind the
counter. "You can go by yourself.
"You just don't know those Zetes," said the
girl.
"O, them," the lady reconsidered. "O. K. (
I'll go with you."
And there I was without service. So I lit my
way back out with the flashlight, forgetting it
was only rented. But I will say this . . . that if
that vendor let me get out without retrieving
his light, he is as blind as a bat.
