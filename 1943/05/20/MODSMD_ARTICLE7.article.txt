### (By United Press 
WASHINGTON, May 19.—Prime
Minister Winston Churchill today
i solemnly assured the cheering Con
gress that Britain will fight side by
) side with the United States until
Japan is reduced to ashes.
He promised a European invasion
"in due course" and voiced his con
fidence in ultimate victory, but
j again warned that much hard work
| lies ahead before peace comes to
the world.
In a 15-minute address before a
; joint session of Congress—his sec
ond in 17 months—he also declared
that:
1. He and President Roosevelt
are currently meeting to see that
; the campaigns which lie ahead in
Europe and in the Pacific are "well
i conceived and thrust forward with
' out losing a day."
2. His Far Eastern military ex
j perts did not travel all the way io
Washington "simply to concern
themselves about the health and
happiness of the Mikado of Japan."
3. The experiment of attempting
to bomb Germany and Italy to col-
I lapse will be continued but not to
i the exclusion of other operations.
Air power already has reduced Ger
man war industry, particularly in
i the Ruhr, to a condition of "unpar
; alleled devastation."
4. "It is all agreed between us that
1 we should be at the earliest mo
j ment similarly bringing our joint air
power to bear on the military tar
gets in the homelands of Japan."
5. He hoped he and Mr. Roosevelt
may meet soon with Russian Pre
mier Joseph Stalin and, if possible,
with Chinese Generalissimo Chiang
Kai-shek.
(5. U-boat danger is the greatest to
be faced but "I have a good and
! sober confidence that it will not only
be met and contained, but over
come." The last three months and
particularly the last few weeks have
achieved record results in "Allied
killing of the U.boats."
