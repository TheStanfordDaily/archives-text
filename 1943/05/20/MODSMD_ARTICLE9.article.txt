LONDON, May 20.â€”Germany re
ported today that Russia had opened

major attacks in four areas along a
1,100-mile front and indicated the
belief that the Red Army might de
velop its operations into a general
offensive in one or more sectors.
A German news broadcast said
that the Red Army has opened at
tacks on the Volkhov River south of
Leningrad; south of Staraya Russa,
where the front bulges over toward
the Latvian frontier; at Belgarad at
the northern end of the Donets front
above Kharkov, and in the Kuban.
