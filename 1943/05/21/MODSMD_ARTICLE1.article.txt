tank arsenal Saturday and jeopard- j
ize the jobs of 85,000 employees in
the other Chrysler war plants.
Leo Lammont, Chrysler director j
of the UAW-CIO, denounced the j
strikes as "unauthorized" and or
dered the men to return to work at !
once.

Four American planes were lost.
The longest and most spectacular

wrecking 37 enemy planes on the
around.
As they wheeled for the return j

attacked by 50 enemy fighters. In !
a 20-minute battle continuing far
out to sea, the Fortresses and their
P-38 escorts shot down 10 enemy i
craft.
