# WORLD FEDERATION
## Four Professors To Discuss Culbertson Plan on Monday 
### 
The plan for a World Federation formulated by Ely Culbertson will be
oiscussed next Monday night at 7:30 in the Education Auditorium in a
forum sponsored by the Political Science department.
According to Mr. Culbertson and his supporters, it is never too soon to
start making peace plans because one of the causes for the errors of the

Versailles treaty was haste and a
„ack of foresight among those present
At the peacc table.
World Federation Plan
Mr. Culbertson has, therefore,
drawn up a detailed constitution for
A World Federation which has as its
object the democratic governing of
all the nations of the world in per
petual peace.
The plan calls for a world congress
■to which each of the 11 regions of
the world would send six representa
tives, a world court, a world presi
dent who would be chosen from
each of the regions in turn, and a
dual policing system composed of
the mobile corps, whose members
would be recruited from the small
powers of the world, and the stand
ing armies of the initial countries to
oin the league.
Four Speakers
According to the plan, the United
States would belong in a region
which would also include the Latin
Americas.
Four faculty members, all of whom
have devoted much study to the plan,
will present the details in their 10-
rninute speeches and will afterwards
answer questions from the audience.
Federation Phase
Dr. Warren D. Allen, professor of
music and author of "Our Marching
Civilization," a book which presents
some views which coincide with
those of Mr. Culbertson, will dis
cuss the federation phase of the plan.
He will touch especially on Culbert
son's conception of the World Fed
eration as a cluster of planets re
volving about a central sun, the
planets representing the regions with
iheir respective states, and the sun
the world federation congress.
Dr. Eliot Blaekwelder, as a geolo
gist is interested in the regional as
pects of the plan, and will discuss
the matters which are involved in
the grouping of the nations into re
gions without eliminating their own
lational boundaries. His discussion
Will be carried out from the point of
view of the regions themselves.
World Security

Dr. B. Q. Morgan, of the Germanic
language department, will discuss
the provisions of the plan which deal
with world security. "There can be
no civilization in the world unless a
means can be found to restrain the
international gangster as society has
iong since managed to control the
individual criminal," says Dr. Mor
gan.

Dr.Graham Stuart, whose per
sonal friendship with Ely Culbertson
has enabled him to have an intimate
first-hand knowledge of the devel
opment of the plan, will discuss the
criticisms and difficulties which the
plan has encountered.
