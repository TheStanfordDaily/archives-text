FULTON AND KLEMMER
Maybe those S.F. sportswriters
; who've been criticizing Cal's Grover
Klemmer and Stanford's Johnny
j Fulton for purportedly "dodging"
j each other will quiet down after the
j Fresno Relays, where the two are
j scheduled to match strides on the
anchor leg of the mile relay.
An Examiner scribe was the lirst
to raise the cry when he claimed a
couple of days before the Big Meet
that Fulton was the one pulling the
! "dodge." Anybody who know s
Johnny knows he has wanted to run
against Klemmer for years. Pitch
Johnson announced a week before
the Big Meet that Fulton would run
(he 220 and 440. It was thus up to
Klemmer to enter the 440. originally
J his favorite event, to make the
match. The Rover decided against
it. however, and even avoided Ful
ton in the mile relay.
Since then, San Francisco News
Sports Editor Bud Spencer, a former
i Stanford trackster, has rehashed the
Fulton-Klemmer business twice in
his column. The day before the Big
Meet he blamed Fulton, and the
1 Monday after he blasted Klemmer.
i Spencer seemed to think that Fulton
j should have run only the 880 just
I to build up interest in the meet.
Either Spencer is running short of
column material, or he expects a
track coach to run bis men the way
the public wants them to run, in
stead of the way they will help the
team the most.
S.C.-STANFORD DUEL
Getting back to the Fresno meet,
the unheralded battle for the team
title could provide plenty of excite
ment. Cal appears to have enough
all-around strength to win, but the
duel for second spot between Stan
ford and U.S.C. will be nip and tuck.
The Trojans will have an entry in
every event, and may pick up
enough stray points to beat Pitch
j Johnson's squad. S.C.'s relay quar
tets, on the other hand, aren't too
strong. Should California, Univer
sity of Missouri, U.C.L.A.. and Fres
no State shut out the Southerners in
' a couple of races, the Indians might
; win out.
S.C. has a good broad-jumper,
shot-putter, and javelin-thrower en
tered in the field events, and a
couple of sprinters in the open 100.
This quintet could score anywhere
from !) to 18 points, depending on the
type of competition thej get. We
hope it's the best.
MURAL MEET
Frat and club cinder artists will
! put on an exciting show out on An
| gell Field this afternoon, if past
j meets are any criterion. Battle for
; the team title this year should be
j extremely close, with some six
J squads in the running for the award.

MURAL MEET
Frat and club cinder artists will
! put on an exciting show out on An
| gell Field this afternoon, if past
j meets are any criterion. Battle for
; the team title this year should be
j extremely close, with some six
J squads in the running for the award.
FULTON AND KLEMMER
Maybe those S.F. sportswriters
; who've been criticizing Cal's Grover
Klemmer and Stanford's Johnny
j Fulton for purportedly "dodging"
j each other will quiet down after the
j Fresno Relays, where the two are
j scheduled to match strides on the
anchor leg of the mile relay.
An Examiner scribe was the lirst
to raise the cry when he claimed a
couple of days before the Big Meet
that Fulton was the one pulling the
! "dodge." Anybody who know s
Johnny knows he has wanted to run
against Klemmer for years. Pitch
Johnson announced a week before
the Big Meet that Fulton would run
(he 220 and 440. It was thus up to
Klemmer to enter the 440. originally
J his favorite event, to make the
match. The Rover decided against
it. however, and even avoided Ful
ton in the mile relay.
Since then, San Francisco News
Sports Editor Bud Spencer, a former
i Stanford trackster, has rehashed the
Fulton-Klemmer business twice in
his column. The day before the Big
Meet he blamed Fulton, and the
1 Monday after he blasted Klemmer.
i Spencer seemed to think that Fulton
j should have run only the 880 just
I to build up interest in the meet.
Either Spencer is running short of
column material, or he expects a
track coach to run bis men the way
the public wants them to run, in
stead of the way they will help the
team the most.
S.C.-STANFORD DUEL
Getting back to the Fresno meet,
the unheralded battle for the team
title could provide plenty of excite
ment. Cal appears to have enough
all-around strength to win, but the
duel for second spot between Stan
ford and U.S.C. will be nip and tuck.
The Trojans will have an entry in
every event, and may pick up
enough stray points to beat Pitch
j Johnson's squad. S.C.'s relay quar
tets, on the other hand, aren't too
strong. Should California, Univer
sity of Missouri, U.C.L.A.. and Fres
no State shut out the Southerners in
' a couple of races, the Indians might
; win out.
S.C. has a good broad-jumper,
shot-putter, and javelin-thrower en
tered in the field events, and a
couple of sprinters in the open 100.
This quintet could score anywhere
from !) to 18 points, depending on the
type of competition thej get. We
hope it's the best.
