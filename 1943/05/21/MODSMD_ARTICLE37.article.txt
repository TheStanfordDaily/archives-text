## Dekes Hit 3, Get 10 Runs 
### 
Perhaps the most outstanding per
formance on yesterday's intramural
Softball front was the victory of the
Dekes over Theta Chi. Though al
lowing only 3 hits, Harry Boothe of
the Theta Chi house allowed too
many walks in the wrong places, and
that together with several errors by
the rest of the team gave the Dekes
ten runs and the ball game. Clark
pitched for the Dekes and gave up
only 3 runs making the final score
10-.°). The Dekes lead ( the league
currently with only one loss chalked
up against them.
The most thrilling game was be
tween K.A. and Kappa Sig. Going
into the final inning, the score stood
tied at 3 runs apiece. First up in the
fatal inning, the K.A.'s scored 6 runs
to put the game on ice. Proving that
the game is never over until the final
out, the Kappa Sigmas came back to
rally in their half. It fell short by
one run, however, just being able
to score 5. The final score was K.A.
9. Kappa Sigma 8.
Another exciting and close game
was the 8-7 tussle with the Zetes
emerging victorious over the Alpha
Delts. The Alpha Dolts led for part
of the game 2-0 but cracked open
at the seams in the later innings by
making too many errors. Schrei
ber hurled for the Zetes while
Thomas hurled for the losers.
Leading all the way, the D.U.
house survived a four-run rally in
the sixth inning by the Page Mill
soldier boys of Company D to rack
up another victory by the close score
of 6-5. Bob Barsocchini tossed the
winning ball.
"Rock" Sheller pitched the Phi
Psi's to a shut-out victory over the
S.A.E. house. Ted Barr led the 18-
run attack with 3 homers.
In a very close game, not decided
until the final out, Wong's Tong got
back onto the victory trail with a
21-1(3 win over the A.K.L. house.
This game kept the record clean for
the latter team as they have failed
to win a game thus far this season.
Each team made 3 home runs apiece
j with errors rather abundant.
Sigma Chi defeated Delta Tau
; Delta by the score of 14 to 8 in
: another hard-fought game. The ball
' just kept on looking big as every
body was hitting. Jim Gall tossed
i for the winners with Rosecrance on
the mound for the Delts.

In the only other game played,
the Chem boys trounced the Phi
Delts behind the stellar pitching of
Morrison. Forbes, hurling for the
Phi Delts, was not able to hold the
Chem hitters in check as he lost,
9-4.

The Chi Psi's won by default from
the Betas. The other scheduled
game between Theta Delta Chi and
Sigma Nu was called off by agree
ment of the two houses as neither of
them was able to field a team at
hours suitable to the other. The
game will be played off at a later
date.

tween K.A. and Kappa Sig. Going
into the final inning, the score stood
tied at 3 runs apiece. First up in the
fatal inning, the K.A.'s scored 6 runs
to put the game on ice. Proving that
the game is never over until the final
out, the Kappa Sigmas came back to
rally in their half. It fell short by
one run, however, just being able
to score 5. The final score was K.A.
9. Kappa Sigma 8.
Another exciting and close game
was the 8-7 tussle with the Zetes
emerging victorious over the Alpha
Delts. The Alpha Dolts led for part
of the game 2-0 but cracked open
at the seams in the later innings by
making too many errors. Schrei
ber hurled for the Zetes while
Thomas hurled for the losers.
Leading all the way, the D.U.

Delts behind the stellar pitching of

Phi Delts, was not able to hold the
Chem hitters in check as he lost,
9-4.

the Betas. The other scheduled
game between Theta Delta Chi and
Sigma Nu was called off by agree
ment of the two houses as neither of

formance on yesterday's intramural
Softball front was the victory of the
Dekes over Theta Chi. Though al
