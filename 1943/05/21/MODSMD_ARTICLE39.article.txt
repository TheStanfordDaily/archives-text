# Three Quarter Milers, and Warmerdam To Star in Fresno Relays Tomorrow
## 
### Ed Luce 
Six hundred of the West's top
cinder artists, among them Cornelius
Warmerdam and the three greatest
quarter-milers in the country, will
battle it out at Fresno tomorrow
morning, afternoon, and evening in
the annual West Coast Relays.
High School and junior college
events will be run off during the
day, with the open division compe
tition scheduled to start at (5:15 as a
twilight affair.
Mile Relay Feature
However close Warmerdam may
come to a world record, the biggest
thrill of the meet should come on
the final leg of the open mile relay,
where those quarter-milers already
referred to—Cal's Grover Klemmer,
Stanford's Johnny Fulton, and S.C.'s
Cliff Bourland—are expected to hook
up.
Klemmer and Fulton are already
sure of running the anchor legs on
their mile foursomes, while Bour
land. if his leg is okay, will do the
last lap for the Trojans.
Best Races
Outside of the mile relay, which,
with the entry of a strong U.C.L.A.
quartet, looms as a four-way dog
fight, the best race.; should be the
two-mile, and medley baton-passing
events.
In the former race. Bear Coach A1
Ragan has selected Terry Ring, Bob
McCarthy, Ralph Dewey, and Jim
Dunn to take on Indians Wayne
Girdner, Bruce Meyer, Glen Holt by,
and Fulton.
Cal Favored
California has entered Klemmer,
Bob Clark, Ring, and Dewey in the
medley, where they will be slight
favorites over Stanford's entry of
Dud Cramer, Girdner, Dave Bills,
and Bob Compton. Southern Cali
fornia and U.C.L.A. will also be
represented in these races.
Battle for the team championship
shapes up as a three-way affair be-'
tween California, Stanford, and
U.S.C. with the interest centering on
the Indian - Trojan duel. Dean
Cromwell has entered 23 men for
S.C., as against 13 entered by Pitch
Johnson.
Indians Have Fdge
Stanford appears to have the edge
on the Trojans in all relay events
but the sprints, and in the high jump
and javelin. Southern Cal. however,
will have a strong entry in the 100,
shot put, and broad jump, events
where there are no Stanford men
listed to compete.
Of the individual events, the 100,
hurdles, high jump, and javelin
should produce the closest battles. In
the century, Davis will once again
meet St. Mary's Pre-Flight's Peyton
Jordan, in addition to S.C.'s Jack
Trout and Missouri University's
Owen Joggerst and Joe Shy, The
latter two are 9.7 sprinters who
made up half the Missouri sprint re
lay quartet, present Drake Relay
champions.
Fulrell Against Field
In the high hurdles, Fresno State's
Louie Futrell will be up against the
best timber toppers on the Coast:
Lee Angelich and Gene Smith of
Cal; Joe Mardesich of Stanford; Bud
Vereggee of San Jose State; and
George Kryder of U.S.C.
The Farm's A1 Pande for the first
time this year won't be a cinch in
the javelin. Bruce Miller of S.C. last
week heaved the spear 194 feet.
Pande's best is 191 feet 10 inches.
Smith Picked
Farm Captain Willard Smith
shouldn't have any trouble winning
the high jump. San Jose's Hal Cap
ers will be on hand to offer competi
tion, as will Chuck Ennis of Cal,
Kryder of Southern Cal, and Bo!)
Zaleska and Ed Luce of Stanford.
The Stanford squad will leave for
the meet tomorrow morning, and
will return Sunday.

Out of the four games that the An
gels have lots this year, Hollywood
has been the winning team three
times.
