# John Dickshot Hits as Los Angeles Falls
## 
### 
Johnny Dickshot, ace Hollywood
Star outfielder, batted out three hits
for four tries to lead his teammates j
to a 4-2 victory over the league- !
leading Los Angeles Angels, thus
breaking their record-smashing win- ,
ning streak at 21 straight. This
marked the 32 consecutive encoun
ters in which Dickshot has hit safely.
He has only 31 more contests to go
before he equals the Coast League I
record set by Joe DiMaggio of 63 |

straight games.
The Angels are leading the league
by a huge margin at the present time
although they have had only the soft
touches. Hollywood, however, is
leading the Coast boys in batting,
both individually- and as a team.
Dickshot and third baseman Cle
ments are out in front, both knock
ing the ball at a better than a .400
clip. The team collectively is hit
ting at a .290 pace.

Red Grange, the Galloping Ghost
of Illinois, is running again, only
this time in a portrait painted from
a photograph by Bob Zuppke, the
coach who made nis name immortal
two decades ago.
