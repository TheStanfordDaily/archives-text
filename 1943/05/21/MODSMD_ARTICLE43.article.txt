# The

MANY persons have severely criticized Stan
ford for having the church where the Li
brary should be. Often it has been said that the
Library is the heart of the University.
When Stanford was designed Mrs. Stanford
gave this statement thought and defended the
church's location on the campus in a statement
that is on the bulletin board in front of it:
"For no amount of learning can take the
place of decency, and no amount of science
can take the place of back-bone. And as the
moral and spiritual life is more important than
the life of our bodies, so moral and spiritual
instruction is more important to young people
than instruction of any other kind. That is
why I think the church should be the heart
and center of this university.
1 am aware of the fact that complaint has
been made that the church was put where the
library ought to be. That view can be de
fended on some grounds, I know, for I have
heard it so defended, but on the highest pos
sible grounds there is nothing so important
to the young men and women who come here
as the instruction they should get from the
pulpit. And that is why I said that while my
heart is in the university, my soul is in the
church.
Take away the moral and spiritual from
higher education and 1 want nothing to do
with this or any other university. I don't
mean that students require instruction in doc
trines: that is just what 1 do not mean. And
it was for that very reason that 1 wanted the
church to be and to remain non-sectarian.
There is more Christianity than doctrine. And
I want the church building to be left open all
day so that students and others may go in and
sit there in the quiet whenever they choose.
It will do them good."
—Mrs. Stanford
