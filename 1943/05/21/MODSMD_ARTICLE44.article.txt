# Frosh Formal
## 
### 
TOMORROW night the class of '46 is sponsor
ing an all-campus event. But the majority
of the campus isn't fully aware of the fact.
On their own initiative, the freshmen have
planned a Frosh Formal patterned after the
Sophomore Cotillion, the Junior Prom, and the
Senior Prom. It's open to everyone, and it's the
last big formal of the season that is.
They've worked hard on their dance, and
they're doubly anxious that it be a success.
They hope that a lot of tickets are sold and a
lot of couples appear to enjoy themselves. If
a success, they are sure the Frosh Formal will
become as much a Stanford tradition as the
other class dances. In these times, it will assure
the uncertain freshmen at least one dance of
their own.
At the same time, if this Frosh Formal Sat
urday is a success, the coffers of the Stanford
Convalescent Home will be increased. The
freshmen have decided to turn all their pro
ceeds over to the charity which the campus has
worked so hard for this week.
The members of the class of '46 are to be com
mended for their initiative and their planning.
We hope their Frosh Formal is a huge success,
and that the rest of the campus shows some of
the faith in them that they have in themselves.
