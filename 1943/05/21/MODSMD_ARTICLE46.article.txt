### CYCLONE COVEY 
(Editor's note. —Since Covey knows noth
ing whatever about women, this column, ex
pressing the frustration of the Stanford rough,
is written by Bill Rose.
I am jealous—not only jealous but disillu
sioned too. I was never a great ladies' man, but
I always managed to have my share of dates
and a so-called normal social life.
When the ratio at Stanford began to drop, I j
felt my stock as one of the remaining men on
campus rise proportionately. I noticed more i
girls were smiling at me. Some even said
"Hello." I got a date with one whose third
cousin by marriage was a Pi Phi.
With the male majority slumping to a new
low this quarter, I was sure the Kappas would
be calling me up by the end of the first week.
Eut they didn't. Nobody called me. So I tried
calling a few Roble girls. It was no use. I
couldn't get a date. But why? Why, with the
overwhelming made shortage, wouldn't any
one go out with me? I finally called my lab
partner, who has two heads, and asked her if
she'd like to see a show.
She too said she was busy. Then I knew
something was wrong. The next day I looked
out of my window (I live in a small room off
Felton Libe) and saw a large group of men in
uniform walking along the Quad. I couldn't
see their faces; so to be sure it wasn't a Jap in
vasion (not that they could ever find me) I de
cided to go to a class and find out who they
were.
It was then I learned that the Army had
moved into Stanford. Since then I have noticed
more and more soldiers on campus and less
and less girls smiling at me. I am worse off (
now than when the ratio was 3-1. I could make
an attempt at competing with fellow civilians, |
but with soldiers, no.
Things have now reached the state where I.
am without even speaking acquaintances
among the female contingent of the student
body.
The other day I passed a girl to whom I was
engaged last quarter. She was walking with a
smooth-looking soldier, listening raptly to his
conversation, fondly caressing the two stripes
on his arm. "Hello, Ermintrude," I said. But
she only placed her hand in the soldier's and
walked serenely on.
I read something in The Daily about the Nit
ery habit. I already had the habit, but knew
nothing of the Nitery. So I decided to take a
stroll up there—thinking I might get to see a '
girl or something. I did see a girl, but for every
one of them there were three soldiers. All the
co-eds were laughing and talking and dancing
and acting like anything but pre-war Stanford
women. I was pitifully out of it.
I went to a couple of dances (stag, of course)
thinking I might get a chance to tag in. It was
like trying to take Henderson Field single
handed. Needless to say, I lost.
The papers have been full of articles about
various women's living groups entertaining'
service men in their residences, on picnics, etc. :
The only way I can even get into Lagunita now
is when some soldier orders an orchid at the |
florist's where I work and I have to deliver it.
I do not begrudge these service men the treat- 1
ment they are receiving from the female stu
dents. I only express my envy of them.
I have pretty well solved my personal prob
lem by taking residence in a girls' boarding
school. But even those little tikes have begun
entertaining the boys in uniform. Is there no
sanctuary?

I am jealous—not only jealous but disillu
sioned too. I was never a great ladies' man, but
I always managed to have my share of dates
and a so-called normal social life.
When the ratio at Stanford began to drop, I j
felt my stock as one of the remaining men on
campus rise proportionately. I noticed more i
girls were smiling at me. Some even said
"Hello." I got a date with one whose third
cousin by marriage was a Pi Phi.
With the male majority slumping to a new
low this quarter, I was sure the Kappas would
be calling me up by the end of the first week.
Eut they didn't. Nobody called me. So I tried
calling a few Roble girls. It was no use. I
couldn't get a date. But why? Why, with the
overwhelming made shortage, wouldn't any
one go out with me? I finally called my lab
partner, who has two heads, and asked her if
she'd like to see a show.
She too said she was busy. Then I knew
something was wrong. The next day I looked
out of my window (I live in a small room off
Felton Libe) and saw a large group of men in
uniform walking along the Quad. I couldn't
see their faces; so to be sure it wasn't a Jap in
vasion (not that they could ever find me) I de
cided to go to a class and find out who they
were.
It was then I learned that the Army had
moved into Stanford. Since then I have noticed
more and more soldiers on campus and less
and less girls smiling at me. I am worse off (
now than when the ratio was 3-1. I could make
an attempt at competing with fellow civilians, |
but with soldiers, no.
Things have now reached the state where I.
am without even speaking acquaintances
among the female contingent of the student
body.
The other day I passed a girl to whom I was
engaged last quarter. She was walking with a
smooth-looking soldier, listening raptly to his
conversation, fondly caressing the two stripes
on his arm. "Hello, Ermintrude," I said. But
she only placed her hand in the soldier's and
walked serenely on.
I read something in The Daily about the Nit
ery habit. I already had the habit, but knew
nothing of the Nitery. So I decided to take a
stroll up there—thinking I might get to see a '
girl or something. I did see a girl, but for every
one of them there were three soldiers. All the
co-eds were laughing and talking and dancing
and acting like anything but pre-war Stanford
women. I was pitifully out of it.
I went to a couple of dances (stag, of course)
thinking I might get a chance to tag in. It was
like trying to take Henderson Field single
handed. Needless to say, I lost.
