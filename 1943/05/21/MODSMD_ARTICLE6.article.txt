# Dance Saturday Ends Con Drive
## 
### 
As a fitting conclusion to Con
Home Week, the class of '46 is pre
senting their Frosh Formal tomor
row night in the Women's Gym from
9 till 1. Stan Cumberpatch and Bob
bie Upshaw, co-chairmen, have an
nounced that all profits will be given
to the Con Home and urge every
body to "come and dance so that
others may walk."
Like the Junior Prom, the Frosh
Formal will be open to the entire
campus and all soldiers stationed
at Stanford are invited to attend.
The decorations, which will be in
keeping with the theme. "Stanford
in Spring," will be very novel, fea
turing a false ceiling of eucalyptus
greens and an atmosphere of a cool,
green glen. Around the walls will
be paintings of the Stanford campus
in springtime.
Howard Frederic and his orchestra
will be on hand to provide music
both sweet and hot. Lovely Marian
Vallee will supply the lyrics. Free
refreshments will be served to the
dancers during the intermissions.
Tickets may be purchased at the
A.S.S.U. office at $2 a couple. As
this is the last open formal dance of
this quarter, a large attendance is
expected.
