Ah! Mystery
Mystery and secrecy surround
three of the booths for the A. O. Pi's
and the Kappas are having tunnels,
and the Zetes have labeled their
booth a surprise. These groups will
divulge nothing more about their
concessions.
Also news on the concessions is
the fact that the STAR unit in
. I tends to manage a booth but its
classification is indefinite.

The construction committee,
headed by Jack Shields and
Wright Cortner, announced that it
would like the sophomores from
the various living groups to deco
rate their concessions today be
tween 1 and 4 o'clock.

A whale of an evening is prom
ised by the committee. Barkers with
megaphones, sideshow signs, music
and gaudy decorations will provide
authentic atmosphere. And after
turning over the receipts of the eve
ning to the Convalescent Home
Drive, Con Home Week ends.
Twenty-four concessions, spon
sored by sororities, fraternities, and
halls, will occupy the attention of
the crowd.
