# WAR FRONTS
## ALLIED PLANES SWEEP ACROSS MEDITERRANEAN 
### (By United Press 
ALLIED H.Q., North Africa, May |
23—United States and British planes j
operating on an around-the-clock j
basis to soften up Southern Europe 1
invasion defenses have destroyed 18 ;
more Axis planes in heavy attacks j
on Sicilian airdromes and forts and j
in other sweeps across the Mediter- 1
ranean.
The newest victory brought to 303 j
the number of enemy planes de- j
stroyed by American and British j
fliers of the Middle East, North Af- j
rica, and Malta in four days of ac- j
tion that have seen the German and
Italian air arm suffer some of their |
heaviest losses of the war.
Sixteen planes were destroyed by

U.S. Flying Fortresses and Lightning
fighters in a heavy Saturday day
night raid on the Borizzo air field,
in Northern Sicily, which followed
up the raids on Borizzo and three
other fields Friday night by Royal
Air Force Wellington bombers.
R.A.F. Marauder medium bombers,
patroling the coast of Sardinia. Sicily,
and Southern Italy, shot one German
six-engined Meseburg transport and
damaged another after a short battle
on Saturday.
Long range R.A.F. fighters of the
Middle East Command destroyed a
German sea plane and severely dam
aged a sailing vessel in a Saturday
offensive sweep over the Aegean
Sea.
All operations were made at a cost
of five Allied planes—one of the
Middle East and four from North
Africa—which boosted total losses
for the four days to 17, or about 18
enemy planes destroyed for each
Allied ship lost.
.1A I* BOMBERS
ATTACK TWO VESSELS
WASHINGTON. May 23 — Fifteen
Japanese bombers, in an apparent
desperate effort to relieve the rem
nant of their embattled garrison on
Attu Island, attacked two American
naval vessels in that area Saturday
without success, the Navy reported.
The Navy said there was "No
change in the general situation
ashore" where our forces have split
the Japs into three pockets in a tiny
area on the northeastern end of the
island and are proceeding with what
Secretary of Navy Frank Knox de
scribes as the mopping up operations.
The communique did not indicate
where the Japanese twin-engined
bombers came from but it was be
lieved they were based at Paramu
shiru, Jap naval and aerial strong
hold 630 miles west in the Kurile
Island, stepping stone to the Jap
anese "Mother Island."
They conceivably could have flown
from Jap-held Kiska, 198 miles to
the east, but the landing strip there
has been the target for American
I round-the-clock raids and probably
is too badly damaged to permit the
take off of planes of this type.
OIIIAUD PROPOSES
FRENCH UNION
WASHINGTON, May 23 — Gen.
Henri Honore Giraud has proposed
immediate union with Fighting
French Gen. Charles De Gaulle un-
der which top military and civil
j authorities in the French Empire
i would be divided between the two
leaders until a constitutional gov
ernment can be formed in France, it
j was disclosed here today.
The French North African mili
tary mission in Washington made
i public the text of a letter sent to De
I Gaulle by Giraud on May 17, in
which Giraud declared that "The
; rapid fusion of all the French forces
! into a single army of victory is
j urgent."

British delegation to the Interna

.1A I* BOMBERS
ATTACK TWO VESSELS
WASHINGTON. May 23 — Fifteen
Japanese bombers, in an apparent
desperate effort to relieve the rem
nant of their embattled garrison on
Attu Island, attacked two American
naval vessels in that area Saturday
without success, the Navy reported.
The Navy said there was "No
change in the general situation
ashore" where our forces have split
the Japs into three pockets in a tiny
area on the northeastern end of the
island and are proceeding with what
Secretary of Navy Frank Knox de
scribes as the mopping up operations.
The communique did not indicate
where the Japanese twin-engined
bombers came from but it was be
lieved they were based at Paramu
shiru, Jap naval and aerial strong
hold 630 miles west in the Kurile
Island, stepping stone to the Jap
anese "Mother Island."
They conceivably could have flown
from Jap-held Kiska, 198 miles to
the east, but the landing strip there
has been the target for American
I round-the-clock raids and probably
is too badly damaged to permit the
take off of planes of this type.

.1A I* BOMBERS
ATTACK TWO VESSELS
WASHINGTON. May 23 — Fifteen
Japanese bombers, in an apparent
desperate effort to relieve the rem
nant of their embattled garrison on
Attu Island, attacked two American
naval vessels in that area Saturday
without success, the Navy reported.
The Navy said there was "No
change in the general situation
ashore" where our forces have split
the Japs into three pockets in a tiny
area on the northeastern end of the
island and are proceeding with what
Secretary of Navy Frank Knox de
scribes as the mopping up operations.
The communique did not indicate
where the Japanese twin-engined
bombers came from but it was be
lieved they were based at Paramu
shiru, Jap naval and aerial strong
hold 630 miles west in the Kurile
Island, stepping stone to the Jap
anese "Mother Island."
They conceivably could have flown
from Jap-held Kiska, 198 miles to
the east, but the landing strip there
has been the target for American
I round-the-clock raids and probably
is too badly damaged to permit the
take off of planes of this type.

operating on an around-the-clock j
basis to soften up Southern Europe 1
invasion defenses have destroyed 18 ;
more Axis planes in heavy attacks j
on Sicilian airdromes and forts and j
in other sweeps across the Mediter- 1

The newest victory brought to 303 j
the number of enemy planes de- j
stroyed by American and British j
fliers of the Middle East, North Af- j
rica, and Malta in four days of ac- j
tion that have seen the German and
Italian air arm suffer some of their |
heaviest losses of the war.
Sixteen planes were destroyed by

U.S. Flying Fortresses and Lightning
fighters in a heavy Saturday day
night raid on the Borizzo air field,
in Northern Sicily, which followed
up the raids on Borizzo and three
other fields Friday night by Royal
Air Force Wellington bombers.
R.A.F. Marauder medium bombers,
patroling the coast of Sardinia. Sicily,

on Saturday.
Long range R.A.F. fighters of the
Middle East Command destroyed a
German sea plane and severely dam
aged a sailing vessel in a Saturday
offensive sweep over the Aegean
Sea.
All operations were made at a cost
of five Allied planes—one of the
Middle East and four from North
Africa—which boosted total losses
