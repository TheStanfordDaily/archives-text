## 
### 
Although Dick Flatland pitched a
fine ball game the Stanford baseball
team dropped a close game to the
St. Mary's Pre-Ftighters by the
score of 5-3. The game was played
at Moraga in the blazing sun.
It was the eighth inning that cost
the Reds the ball game when the
Fliers combined two Indian errors
and a base hit to score the winning
two runs. Stanford was unable to
master the slants of Cadet Pearson
and so fell by the wayside.-
Flatland should have won his ball
game since he only allowed six hits
during his nine innings on the hill,
and his showing has impressed Coach
Harry Wolter considerably. He is
the latest addition to Wolter's pitch
ing staff and has a fine record so far
i this season, having won two and lost
two.
