# Stanford Sailors Down Cal Twice
## 
### 
Stanford's sailing crew, which
comes into prominence about twice
a year, defeated California's crew in
two racesâ€”P.C. and 60-foot cutter
yesterday afternoon on San Fran
cisco Bay.
The victories put the Indians one
race up in the saiiing competition
between the Farm and Cal that had
its start in 1938, and it also gave
Stanford possession of the perpetual
trophy annually awarded to the win
ners.
In the first race, the Stanford P.C.
boat defeated the Bears by 20 sec
onds over a three-mile course, with
Jim Neville skippering the winning
crew.
