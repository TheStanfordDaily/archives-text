## 
### 
With admission free to Stanford's
men in uniform "Charlie's Aunt,"
popular comedy for over 50 years,
will play Thursday. Friday, and Sat
urday nights in Memorial Audito
rium.
Rehearsed by the Stanford Play
ers over spring vacation, the show
was originally produced by out
standing members of the faculty and
graduates to play before soldier au
diences. Since then the cast has
traveled to seven Army camps, and
the comedy has been such a success
that it was chosen as the last speech
and drama department show of the
quarter.
Family Reunion
For the B. Q. Morgans, the show
is somewhat of a family reunion;
Mr., Mrs., and daughter all have

i parts in "Charlie's Aunt."
Professor Morgan, who is head of
the Germanics department, takes the
i part of Brassett in the show. His
( latest role in the Stanford theater
was that of Orlando in "In Time to
i Come," a story of the Paris Peace
! Conference produced last quarter.
He also played in "Of Thee I Sing,"
i which showed here a few years ago
and is remembered as one of Stan
| ford's greatest stage successes.
