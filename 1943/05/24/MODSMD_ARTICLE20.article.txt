# Free Air

### 
THERE are few of use who do not agree that if we are to have
a world with lasting peace, we must have free trade and no
tariff walls.
In connection with free trade, the airplane has brought about
another wrinkle which we must iron out. After the war there
will be a vast expansion of commercial air transport. To the
high powered, multi-engined plane, the national boundaries mean
nothing. If we are to raise these arbitrary borders so high that
no plane can fly over them, we are making a grave mistake.
If we have nothing to hide in the way of military develop
ments, there is no reason why planes of every nation should
not fly across the United States in direct competition with Ameri
can companies, as well as flying from different nations to Amer
ica.
The airplane can do as much to create understanding as it can
to facilitate war. Maybe if the air were free and if the children
who look into the sky in answer to a plane's roar became as used
to seeing a German Junker as a Mainliner, we would have more
understanding and appreciation of the other nations of the world.
We glibly speak of Freedom of the Seas. This concept is
easily grabbed by the layman, but he too must understand and
demand a "Free Air" for the planes of all nations.
