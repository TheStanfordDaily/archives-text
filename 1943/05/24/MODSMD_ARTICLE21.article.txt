# On Promotions
## 
### 
THOSE members of the staff who could not see fit to brave the
hot weather and come to the last staff meeting of the quarter
yesterday, missed some rather important announcements.
It is of great importance that all requests for promotions be in
the little brown box by 3 p.m. today, since at that time the Misses
Thompson and Glasson leave the Shack to consider the future
of "The Peninsula's Only Morning Newspaper" and the promo
tions for coming Volume 104.
