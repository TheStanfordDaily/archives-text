In one of Mr. Covey's columns a little while back, he briefly
touched upon the subject of what people would think of our pres
ent way of life fifty years hence. In the same line of thought,
what would Stanford life in 1980 be like? Let's take a jump into
'the future.
A very ancient teacher is going to talk before the student
body. The wizened sage looks out over the audience and begins
to speak.
"Yes, when I first came to this institution, way back in 1940,
things were different. The presidents of Stanford used to live
in what is now that old storehouse behind the row, and classes
were held in those buildings which tourists now pay two-bits
to go through.
"Classes- Oh yes, I forgot to tell you that in those days
you couldn't sit in an easy chair, turn on your television set, and
then listen to your history lecture. Students fifty years ago didn't
have escalators going from one building to another either.
"And you don't think you're getting enough for your 5543
a quarter!
"In the 1940's they played a game called football. Each year
a Big Game was held with the now defunct University of Cali
fornia. Football was replaced by pinochle about twenty years
ago.
"Students couldn't go very far on dates then because in 1942
automobiles were still being used. Can you imagine not being
able to go to a dance in New York nor larb in Denver? (Larb in
1980 slang meaning to "chew the fat" or loaf.)
"Drinking was in vogue then. It wasn't until 1956 that a
certain Farm teacher, I forget his name for the moment, put pres
sure on the state legislature and had them make California a dry
state.
"During World War 11, which, you remember, was a couple
of world wars ago," Stanford became practically a fort. Most of
the soldiers were kept in Encina, Toyon, and Brainier dormitories,
which were situated in what is now the east wing of our new lux
ury living quarters. And they didn't have coed dormitories then
either!
"Before 1940? Well, things were really primitive then."
