# Professors To Discuss World Federation Plan
## 
### Vicky Sellens 
The Culbertson World Federation plan will be discussed tonight by Pro
fessors Warren D. Allen, Eliot Blackwelder, B. Q. Morgan, and Graham
Stuart in a forum to be held at 7:30 in the Education Auditorium.
These professors, together with Ely Culbertson. believe that the time tc
! plan for peace is now, so that the winning of the war shall have some im-

| mediate meaning as soon as hostili-""
ties cease, instead of that period
being merely a time of conflicting
| efforts to win the peace as well as j
the war.
To this end, and to open the eyes
of the people of this community to
the need for making concrete plans
for the future, the forum is dedi
cated. "We do not claim that the
| Culbertson plan is the only possible
| feasible plan, but we wish to present
it as a challenge to thinking people
to accept its principles or to make a
better one," said Dr. Morgan.
Eleven Regions
In brief the plan would create a
World Federation of 11 regions,
without destroying, however, the na
tional boundaries within them. These
regions would contain neighboring
countries of similar social, physical,
and economic conditions. The legis
lature of the World Federation
would involve representatives from
| each of the regions; the executive
department would consist of a presi
j dent elected from each region in
| turn; the judicial department would
j consist of a world court; and the
world policing would be done by a
mobile world federation corps with
i the assistance in time of emergency
of the standing armies of all the
countries, united together against
any group or country which began
j a policy of aggression.
Each of the speakers will give a
j 10-minute address on a particular
phase of the plan; after which the
chairman, Dr. Edwin Cottrell, will
| invite questions and discussion from
j the audience.
Federation Concept
The first speaker, Dr. Allen, will
discuss the federation concept of the
! plan, drawing illustrations from his
book, "Our Marching Civilization,"
which is soon to be released by the
| Stanford Press and which contains
i many ideas which coincide with
; those of Culbertson. Dr. Allen re
gards the Culbertson conception of
the World Federation as one of this
j century's most brilliant develop
ments in political theory.
Dr. Blackwelder will discuss the
idea of dividing the world into 11
divisions, under which division the
United States would fall into a re
gion including all of South America,
j Dr. Blackwelder's discussion will be
from the point of view of the regions
themselves, taking into considera
tion their social and economic simi
larities and differences.
World Security
Dr. Morgan will discuss the part
! of the plan which provides for world
security. Believing that there can be
no civilization in the world without
a means of restraining the interna
tional gangster, Dr. Morgan will ex
plain the dual system of policing pre
sented in the plan.
Dr. Stuart, who, through his
friendship with Culbertson, has had
opportunity to watch the develop
ment of the plan, will present some
|of the difficulties which the plan
faces and will discuss the criticisms
1 which are being directed against it.
Copies of the plan will be on sale
! in the lobby of the auditorium.

the World Federation as one of this
j century's most brilliant develop
ments in political theory.
Dr. Blackwelder will discuss the
idea of dividing the world into 11
divisions, under which division the
United States would fall into a re
gion including all of South America,
j Dr. Blackwelder's discussion will be
from the point of view of the regions
themselves, taking into considera
tion their social and economic simi
larities and differences.
World Security
Dr. Morgan will discuss the part
! of the plan which provides for world
security. Believing that there can be
no civilization in the world without
a means of restraining the interna
tional gangster, Dr. Morgan will ex
plain the dual system of policing pre
sented in the plan.
Dr. Stuart, who, through his
friendship with Culbertson, has had
opportunity to watch the develop
ment of the plan, will present some
|of the difficulties which the plan
faces and will discuss the criticisms
1 which are being directed against it.
Copies of the plan will be on sale
! in the lobby of the auditorium.
The Culbertson World Federation plan will be discussed tonight by Pro
fessors Warren D. Allen, Eliot Blackwelder, B. Q. Morgan, and Graham
Stuart in a forum to be held at 7:30 in the Education Auditorium.
These professors, together with Ely Culbertson. believe that the time tc
! plan for peace is now, so that the winning of the war shall have some im-

| mediate meaning as soon as hostili-""
ties cease, instead of that period
being merely a time of conflicting
| efforts to win the peace as well as j
the war.
To this end, and to open the eyes
of the people of this community to
the need for making concrete plans
for the future, the forum is dedi
cated. "We do not claim that the
| Culbertson plan is the only possible
| feasible plan, but we wish to present
it as a challenge to thinking people
to accept its principles or to make a
better one," said Dr. Morgan.
Eleven Regions
In brief the plan would create a
World Federation of 11 regions,
without destroying, however, the na
tional boundaries within them. These
regions would contain neighboring
countries of similar social, physical,
and economic conditions. The legis
lature of the World Federation
would involve representatives from
| each of the regions; the executive
department would consist of a presi
j dent elected from each region in
| turn; the judicial department would
j consist of a world court; and the
world policing would be done by a
mobile world federation corps with
i the assistance in time of emergency
of the standing armies of all the
countries, united together against
any group or country which began
j a policy of aggression.
Each of the speakers will give a
j 10-minute address on a particular
phase of the plan; after which the
chairman, Dr. Edwin Cottrell, will
| invite questions and discussion from
j the audience.
Federation Concept
The first speaker, Dr. Allen, will
discuss the federation concept of the
! plan, drawing illustrations from his
book, "Our Marching Civilization,"
which is soon to be released by the
| Stanford Press and which contains
i many ideas which coincide with
; those of Culbertson. Dr. Allen re
gards the Culbertson conception of
the World Federation as one of this
j century's most brilliant develop
ments in political theory.
