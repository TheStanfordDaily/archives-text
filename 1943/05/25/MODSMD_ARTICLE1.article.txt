# Tradition Broken as Women Run for Editor
## 
### 
For the first time in the history of
The Daily, staff members will
choose between two women for the
editorship when they cast their votes
for Jane Glasson or Lucy Thompson
this afternoon between 1 and 3
o'clock in the Daily Shack.
Both the candidates have served
as associate editors since the first of
this quarter when Ferris Boothe, Bill
Stief, and Newt Wise were called to
active Army duty.
Miss Thompson joined The Daily

staff in her freshman year as a re
porter and has since served as copy
reader, head copy editor, and night
editor. Also starting on The Daily as
a freshman, Miss Glasson has been a
copyreader, head copy editor, review
editor, and night editor.
The successful candidate will be
come editor of Volume 104 of The
Daily and will start her term of of
fice in Summer Quarter. Under the
system started with Volume 103, the
editor's term is two quarters in
length.

Ending his term as editor of The
Daily this week is A1 Hampson, who
took over the office in January from
John Horrall.
While the election is in progress
this afternoon, members of Editorial
Board will meet in the Executive
Committee rooms to make promo
tions for the next volume. These
will be announced and posted on the
bulletin board with the results of the
election by 4 o'clock tomorrow after
noon.
