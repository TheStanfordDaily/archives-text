We've been hunting for two days, I
but we still haven't found out Wil- i
lard Smith broke the Stanford high
jump record at the Fresno Relays '
Saturday. The 8.A.C., where all
University athletic reports are sup- j
posedly kept, was unable to give j
us a list of Farm track records, and
suggested we compile one by going
through the reports of all the meets
since 1924.
We appreciated but turned down
the idea, and are still looking for the
records.
Smith's jump of (> feet 7 :! i inches
betters George Ilorine's mark of <5-7
made back in the twenties, we're sure
of that, Itiit a Stanford jumper named
King also used to get up around (!-7.
The Farm track captain's perform
ance was the second best high jump
mark made in big meets throughout
the country this year. Watkins of
Texas jumped 6 feet 8 inches at the
Drake Relays over a month ago.
New Hampshire's Bob Morcom, at
present the high jump king of the
East, hasn't done better than (i-4 this
year.
THE NATIONALS?
Smith, along with Johnny Fulton
and A1 Pande, looked good enough
in the Fresno meet to score well up
and even take first places in their
respective events in the N.C.A.A.
meet at Chicago this June.
As yet, however, no definite plans
have been made for sending the three
East to compete. California appar
ently has first place in the N.C.A.A.
cinched, but Stanford's trio, by scor
ing around 30 points, could probably
take over the second spot. Michigan
and Illinois, Big Ten track champs,
have few individual stars and would
have trouble scoring over 20 points.
N.Y.U. and Army are the Eastern
champions, but likewise lack any
outstanding athletes. Texas Univer
sity and the University of Missouri
are the two threats from.the Mid
lands
WA KM EH DAM SCORES AGAIN
He had a hard lime doing it. but
Cornelius Warmerdam once again
got over 15 feet last Saturday at
Fresno. "Corny" (the only nickname
he hates) missed twice at 15 feet Iy
inch. then twisted over on his third
try. The officials pushed the bar up
to 15-8 1 2. hut Warmerdam couldn't
get off a successful vault until his
third try, and then kicked (he bar off
on the way up.
Warmerdam, competing for St.
Mary's Pre-Flight, received a great
hand from the crowd for his per
foi mance, and undoubtedly deserved
it.
