## D.U.s Take Over Mural Lead With 10-7 Win Over Phi Psi's 
### Don Langendorf 
As a result of their victory in yes
terday's intramural softball game,
the D.U.s took over first place in the
league standings. The victims of
their upsurge were the Phi Psi's who
scored seven runs to the winners'
ten.
Boh Barsocchini, as usual, pitched
winning ball, scattering hits where
they would hurt the least. The star
of the game both at field and at the
plate was D.U. Fred Ferroggiaro.
By winning today's game with the
Dekes, the D.U.s can make it awfully
tough for any team to catch up with
them. The Dekes are in second place,
only one game off the pace.
Dekes Lose
The Dekes fell into second as a
result of losing to the Theta Delts in
a playoff of a previous tie. The
Dekes were scheduled to combat the
Sigma Nu team which failed to
show, and the Theta Delts added
another game to their string of wins
when the Chem. team defaulted. The
Theta Delt-Deke game was a pitch
er's battle all the way with the
Theta Delts finally winning 5-4.
Jack Miller broke the tie with a
double in the last inning to drive in
the winning run. Gasich was the
winning pitcher; Clark the losing
pitcher.
Zetes Upset
In the biggest surprise of the day,
the Kappa Alphas massacred the
Zetes. The winners say the score
was 25 to 3, while the losers say 30
to 2.
Wayne Price pitched beautiful no
hit, no-run game for five innings,
being unable to put the side out in
the final inning until he was scored
on two or three times, whoever's
version of the game you wish to be
lieve. John Eikelman and Jack Dana
were victims of the run barrage.
Landale Stars
In a high scoring but close ball
game, Wong's Tong were victors
over the S.A.E. house by 13 to 10.
The game was decided by errors.
"Lanny" Landale was the star as
the Kappa Sigs defeated the Phi
Delts 15-4. He not only pitched nice
ball, keeping the hits of the oppos
ing team well scattered, but he also
j knocked out two home runs to lead
i his team in the batting department,
i Marshall McDaniel hurled for the
| losers.
Keeping their record clean, the
A.K.L. house lost another game yes
terday, this lime to the Chi Psi's, by
a score of 11 to 8. '"Smoke" Morri
son was the winning moundsman.
The Alpha Delts won by default
from Co. D of Page Mill.
