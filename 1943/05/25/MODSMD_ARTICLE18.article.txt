# 'Charlie's Aunt' Cast Lacking Authentic Costume Material
## 
### 
Although handicapped by a lack of authentic materials for making Vic- j
torian costumes, the costume staff for the weekend's production ot "Char
lie's Aunt" has turned out 10 brand new garments.
Stock costumes were used for the actors as the production toured seven
Army Camps in the vicinity. Since it was necessary for the characters to 1

dress and make-up before leaving
Stanford in Army trucks, no changes
of costume were possible.
But for the showing of the Gay J
Nineties comedy on the stage of Me- j
morial Auditorium, Miss Hazel!
Brain, costume mistress, has herself I
manufactured eyelit embroidery and
other substitutes to compensate for
the. scarcity of authentic materials. '
Curtain at 8:15
"Charlie's Aunt" will play Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday nights in
Memorial Auditorium and will begin
promptly at 8:15. All tickets are 83 j
cents and seats are reserved. Reser- |
vations may be made through the I
drama department office in Memo- '
rial Hall.
All men in uniform will be admit- |
ted free, and 600 members of the
STAR units are expected to Thurs- |
day night's performance.
Instead of the muslins of the Vic
torian period, Miss Brain has used !
present day cottons for the ladies' j
day dresses, and decorated them with j
braid and laces. According to Miss
Brain, it was hard to get ribbon wire
used for stiffening the bodices, since j
she first had to obtain a priority.
Perhaps Miss Brain's greatest
problem concerns waistlines. The
average Victorian lady measured 18 |
inches around her midriff, while to
day's average more closely approxi
mates 27 inches.
"We're putting out a rush call for
corsets," Miss Brain said, "And a
20-mule team to help us get the girls
into them."
Evening Dress
In the last net of "Charlie's Aunt,"
both men and women characters
change to evening dress. The ladies'
costumes are embellished with the
black jet, lace, and ribbon of the era,
and instead of the now traditional
orchids for evening flowers, their
corsages are cf the old type Ameri
can Beauty roses and violets.
The only costuming problem pre
sented by the male characters is that
of accessories. High stiff collars and
tie scarfs are used, and the straw
boater type hats.

Stanford in Army trucks, no changes
of costume were possible.
But for the showing of the Gay J
Nineties comedy on the stage of Me- j
morial Auditorium, Miss Hazel!
Brain, costume mistress, has herself I
manufactured eyelit embroidery and
other substitutes to compensate for
the. scarcity of authentic materials. '
Curtain at 8:15
"Charlie's Aunt" will play Thurs
day, Friday, and Saturday nights in
Memorial Auditorium and will begin
promptly at 8:15. All tickets are 83 j
cents and seats are reserved. Reser- |
vations may be made through the I
drama department office in Memo- '
rial Hall.
All men in uniform will be admit- |
ted free, and 600 members of the
STAR units are expected to Thurs- |
day night's performance.
Instead of the muslins of the Vic
torian period, Miss Brain has used !
present day cottons for the ladies' j
day dresses, and decorated them with j
braid and laces. According to Miss
Brain, it was hard to get ribbon wire
used for stiffening the bodices, since j
she first had to obtain a priority.
Perhaps Miss Brain's greatest
problem concerns waistlines. The
average Victorian lady measured 18 |
inches around her midriff, while to
day's average more closely approxi
mates 27 inches.
"We're putting out a rush call for
corsets," Miss Brain said, "And a
20-mule team to help us get the girls
into them."
Evening Dress
In the last net of "Charlie's Aunt,"
both men and women characters
change to evening dress. The ladies'
costumes are embellished with the
black jet, lace, and ribbon of the era,
and instead of the now traditional
orchids for evening flowers, their
corsages are cf the old type Ameri
can Beauty roses and violets.
The only costuming problem pre
sented by the male characters is that
of accessories. High stiff collars and
tie scarfs are used, and the straw
boater type hats.
Although handicapped by a lack of authentic materials for making Vic- j
torian costumes, the costume staff for the weekend's production ot "Char
lie's Aunt" has turned out 10 brand new garments.
Stock costumes were used for the actors as the production toured seven
Army Camps in the vicinity. Since it was necessary for the characters to 1

dress and make-up before leaving
Stanford in Army trucks, no changes
of costume were possible.
