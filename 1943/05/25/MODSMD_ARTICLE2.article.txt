## 
### (By United Press 
LONDON. May 25—A tremendous
force of R.A.F. four-engined bomb
ers blasted the industrial and com
munication center of Dortmund ear
ly today in the greatest air attack
ever made and raised to 100,000 tons
the total weight of bombs dropped
on Germany since the start of the
war, the air ministry announced.
The British air fleet loosed more
than 2,000 tons of explosives and in
cendiaries on Dortmund today be
tween 1 and 2 a.m., in an unparalled
demonstration of concentrated at
tack.
The bombs, dropped at a rate of
more than 33 tons a minute, inflicted
'•great damage," returning pilots re
ported.
Thirty-eight bombers were lost in
the latest attack on the bomb
scarred Ruhr, where heavy British
raids, including the blasting of the
Mohne and Eder dams, already had
seriously crippled Germany's war
production.
Radio Vichy left the air tonight at
11:48 p.m., suggesting the probability
that Allied planes were bombing the
Continent again.
(A CBC correspondent reported
from Berne, Switzerland, that an
estimated 37.000 persons were left
homeless in Dortmund and that au
thorities there were still fighting fire
and digging in the ruins for dead
more than 12 hours after the raid.
Dortmund defenses were said to
have been caught completely unpre
pared, partly because one-quarter
of its air raid defensed workers had
been shifted to rescue work in the
area flooded by the R.A.F. attacks on
the Mhne and Eder dams.)
