# "This Is the Law ..."
## 
### 
two young women walked out of The Daily. Today
j. one will return as the new editor and the other will return
defeated.
This is traditionâ€”one shall win and one shall lose. But
whether they win or lose, each has had three years' experience
on a daily newspaper. They have spent their time at college,
hurried and tired. They have always been behind in their school
work. They have been in a position to get a thrill in seeing the
paper on the Quad each morning and reading the stories they
wrote and the ideas they contributed. To both, she who wins and
she who loses, we hope that The Daily has been worth it.
To both of you, good luck.
