### CYCLONE COVEY 
The man for whom Sam McDonald Street is named—the
only man for whom a campus street is named—is a sharp-witted
hard working Negro who came to Stanford as a team driver in
1903, and has for nearly 40 years been Superintendent of Ath
letic Buildings and Grounds.
His innumerable services to Stanford include the personal
laying down and building of Angell Field. And once, in 1917,
he exceeded his official capacity to stage a singfest of 10,000
troops in the old football stadium.
He has known three generations of Stanford students, and
takes keen pleasure in comparing present students of his ac
quaintance with their fathers and grandfathers.
It was he who brought about the organization, Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni, when he began inviting children
of people he had known to picnics at his La Honda home (his
other home is the Track House); and these occasions grew to such
proportions that Mr. McDonald soon had not only a large or
ganization to his credit but a fabulous reputation for barbecuing.
Probably no other man at Stanford has had so many friends
ft is said that Chancellor Wilbur once remarked, "When they
told me I was going to run for President of the University, I would
have been lucky to beat Sam McDonald for the job."
It was during the Lean Years that Stanford came fully to
appreciate its superintendent's resourcefulness. For the admin
istration discovered he could do any and everything. And he
still can, and does. Just a while back, beset with an acute short
age of help and time, he invented a potato planter, which he is
now using successfully for other crops as well.
He is best known to students for his Labor Day barbecues,
which the war has lately obviated. He likes the Convalescent
children so well, his big victory garden is now his chief enthu
siasm; and that he knew exactly how to undertake from the simi
lar experience of the last war.
The Convalescent children invite him to their parties, and
when he was recently ill, flooded him with letters. Incidentally,
he is whom the Ham Howard Hits audience a couple of weeks
ago saw cutting watermelon for the kids in the technicolor short.
Everybody tells Mr. McDonald he works too hard, but Mr.
McDonald, who is something of a philosopher, explains that there
is just so much time to do certain things that have to be done.
And he does not stop till they are done.
He will take time off to talk with anybody who comes to see
him, but he will talk fast, because he has so much to do. He has
found you cannot tell children you are too busy, however, for
they do not understand that. And so when a child comes around,
Mr. McDonald shows him how to plant beans or something to
make him feel satisfied.
You cannot learn much about Sam McDonald from Sam
McDonald, though you can learn a lot from him about most any
thing else. His long service, however, speaks for itself. He must
be getting up in years; but there is nothing but the fact of that
long record, and a few gray hairs, to indicate he might be over 35.
So with the vigor of one in his prime of life, the man for
whom Sam McDonald Street is named continues to be, for Stan
ford, an institution in himself.

Daughters of Stanford Alumni, when he began inviting children
of people he had known to picnics at his La Honda home (his
other home is the Track House); and these occasions grew to such
proportions that Mr. McDonald soon had not only a large or
ganization to his credit but a fabulous reputation for barbecuing.
Probably no other man at Stanford has had so many friends
ft is said that Chancellor Wilbur once remarked, "When they
told me I was going to run for President of the University, I would
have been lucky to beat Sam McDonald for the job."
It was during the Lean Years that Stanford came fully to
appreciate its superintendent's resourcefulness. For the admin
istration discovered he could do any and everything. And he
still can, and does. Just a while back, beset with an acute short
age of help and time, he invented a potato planter, which he is
now using successfully for other crops as well.
He is best known to students for his Labor Day barbecues,
which the war has lately obviated. He likes the Convalescent
children so well, his big victory garden is now his chief enthu
siasm; and that he knew exactly how to undertake from the simi
lar experience of the last war.
The Convalescent children invite him to their parties, and
when he was recently ill, flooded him with letters. Incidentally,
he is whom the Ham Howard Hits audience a couple of weeks
ago saw cutting watermelon for the kids in the technicolor short.
Everybody tells Mr. McDonald he works too hard, but Mr.
McDonald, who is something of a philosopher, explains that there
is just so much time to do certain things that have to be done.
And he does not stop till they are done.
He will take time off to talk with anybody who comes to see
him, but he will talk fast, because he has so much to do. He has
found you cannot tell children you are too busy, however, for
they do not understand that. And so when a child comes around,
Mr. McDonald shows him how to plant beans or something to
make him feel satisfied.
You cannot learn much about Sam McDonald from Sam
McDonald, though you can learn a lot from him about most any
thing else. His long service, however, speaks for itself. He must
be getting up in years; but there is nothing but the fact of that
long record, and a few gray hairs, to indicate he might be over 35.
So with the vigor of one in his prime of life, the man for
whom Sam McDonald Street is named continues to be, for Stan
ford, an institution in himself.
The man for whom Sam McDonald Street is named—the
only man for whom a campus street is named—is a sharp-witted
hard working Negro who came to Stanford as a team driver in
1903, and has for nearly 40 years been Superintendent of Ath
letic Buildings and Grounds.
His innumerable services to Stanford include the personal
laying down and building of Angell Field. And once, in 1917,
he exceeded his official capacity to stage a singfest of 10,000
troops in the old football stadium.
He has known three generations of Stanford students, and
takes keen pleasure in comparing present students of his ac
quaintance with their fathers and grandfathers.
It was he who brought about the organization, Sons and
Daughters of Stanford Alumni, when he began inviting children
of people he had known to picnics at his La Honda home (his
other home is the Track House); and these occasions grew to such
proportions that Mr. McDonald soon had not only a large or
