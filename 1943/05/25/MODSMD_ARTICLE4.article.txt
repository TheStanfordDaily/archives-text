# Stanford Professors Speak On Culbertson Federation Plan
## 
### 
The Ely Culbertson plan for a
World Federation was discussed last
night in the Education Auditorium
by Dr. Warren D. Allen, Dr. Eliot
Blackwelder, Dr. B. Q. Morgan, and
Dr. Graham Stuart, before an audi
ence which included many soldiers
stationed on campus.
After an introduction by Dr. Ed
win Cottrell, Dr. Allen explained the
federation concept of the plan.
Neutrals' Position
Comparing the plan of federating
the nations of the world into a world

federation to the union of the 13
sovereign states after the Revolu
tionary War, Dr. Allen said that
each state must be prepared to give
up a part of its sovereignty, stating
that "there are no neutrals in total
war and there must be no neutrals
in a total peace."
Touching upon Culbertson's con
ception of the world federations as
a galaxy of suns revolving about the
central sun. Dr. Allen reminded
the audience that Copernicus was
at first thought a fool for conceiving
this same theory about the solar
system and that Culbertson had sub
stituted in his concept laws of social
attraction for those of physical at
traction.
Union Possible
Dr. Blackwelder, speaking on the
concept of the plan which divides
the world into 11 regions, said that
union is most possible now when
many nations of the world are united
in a war effort, and went on to dis
cuss specific reasons why the regions
were constructed as they are, point
ing out that some nations, for ex
ample Switzerland, would belong to
two regions because their social and
economic conditions pointed two
ways.
Dr. B. Q. Morgan, speaking on the
world policing policy of the plan
compared the World Federation's or
ganization against aggression to the
policing in our cities which combats
gangsterism. Stating that Culbert
son has formulated a mathematically
conceived principle based on a
quota principle of armament as an
answer to the need for force suffi
cient to preserve peace without be
coming a menace in itself. Dr. Mor
gan suggested a replacement of the
ancient formula of "Divide and
Rule," with a new one of "Unite and
Relax."
Objections to Plan
Dr. Graham Stuart, who was asso
ciated with Ely Culbertson in the
School of Political Science in Paris
just before the last war, brought up
several of the objections which the
plan has encountered, emphasizing
especially the apparent lack of pro
vision for international law based on
a moral code.
After the speeches, questions' in
volving punishment of Axis coun
tries, international economics, and
armaments were brought up by
members of the audience.

After an introduction by Dr. Ed
win Cottrell, Dr. Allen explained the
federation concept of the plan.
Neutrals' Position
Comparing the plan of federating
the nations of the world into a world

federation to the union of the 13
sovereign states after the Revolu
tionary War, Dr. Allen said that
each state must be prepared to give
up a part of its sovereignty, stating
that "there are no neutrals in total
war and there must be no neutrals
in a total peace."
Touching upon Culbertson's con
ception of the world federations as
a galaxy of suns revolving about the
central sun. Dr. Allen reminded
the audience that Copernicus was
at first thought a fool for conceiving
this same theory about the solar
system and that Culbertson had sub
stituted in his concept laws of social
attraction for those of physical at
traction.
Union Possible
Dr. Blackwelder, speaking on the
concept of the plan which divides
the world into 11 regions, said that
union is most possible now when
many nations of the world are united
in a war effort, and went on to dis
cuss specific reasons why the regions
were constructed as they are, point
ing out that some nations, for ex
ample Switzerland, would belong to
two regions because their social and
economic conditions pointed two
ways.
Dr. B. Q. Morgan, speaking on the
world policing policy of the plan
compared the World Federation's or
ganization against aggression to the
policing in our cities which combats
gangsterism. Stating that Culbert
son has formulated a mathematically
conceived principle based on a
quota principle of armament as an
answer to the need for force suffi
cient to preserve peace without be
coming a menace in itself. Dr. Mor
gan suggested a replacement of the
ancient formula of "Divide and
Rule," with a new one of "Unite and
Relax."
Objections to Plan
Dr. Graham Stuart, who was asso
ciated with Ely Culbertson in the
School of Political Science in Paris
just before the last war, brought up
several of the objections which the
plan has encountered, emphasizing
especially the apparent lack of pro
vision for international law based on
a moral code.
After the speeches, questions' in
volving punishment of Axis coun
tries, international economics, and
armaments were brought up by
members of the audience.
The Ely Culbertson plan for a
World Federation was discussed last
night in the Education Auditorium
by Dr. Warren D. Allen, Dr. Eliot
Blackwelder, Dr. B. Q. Morgan, and
Dr. Graham Stuart, before an audi
ence which included many soldiers
