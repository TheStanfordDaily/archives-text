and ceremonies.
The first division of this film pre
sents some of the best preserved pre- i
historic Indian ruins of the South- j
west. Shots show how these pre
historic Indians lived in their pit
houses and cliff pueblos. Some of
the people who occupied these ruins
lived before Columbus came to
America, and are probably forerun
ners to the modern Pueblo Indians'
civilization.
The second division deals with the
Hopi Indians of Northern Arizona.

the religious ones, are secret. Some
