## Hunt Discusses Life of Indians 
### 
The Tuesday Evening Series audi
ence saw the cliff pueblos, the pit
houses and pre-historic ruins of
various tribes of pueblo Indians last
night at Memorial Auditorium. E.
P. "Husky" Hunt, the photographer,
also showed some of the sacred secret
rites of the Hopi Indians of North
Dakota, along with their famous
Hopi Butterfly Dance. These In
dians were filmed in their native
country at the edge of the Black
Mesa.
The famed Navajo sand-painter
was shown at the Navajo Indian
Reservation en route to the New
Mexican pueblos. At the reserva
tions, Navajo weavers work finding
inspiration for their highly original
designs from the beautiful, fresh
colors of the Painted Desert of Ari
zona.
The Jemez pueblo of New Mexico
boasts some of the most skillful of
Indian dancers, and the film showed
parts of the Jemez Hoop Dance and
the Buffalo Dance, accompanied by
Mr. Hunt's recordings of authentic
Indian music. A lovely family of the
tribe, friends of the photographer,
Mr. Hunt, were shown with the
group.
One of the most interesting scenes
showed a five-story pueblo which is
visited yearly by hundreds of tour
ists, however the Indians have clung
to their traditional customs largely,
and have been filmed in their whited
doe-skin boots and native dress.
