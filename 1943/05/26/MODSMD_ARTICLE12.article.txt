# 'Charlie's Aunt' Stage Set, Ready for Opening Tomorrow
## 
### 
Playing in stage settings for the first time in their series of performances,
the Stanford Players will open their three-day run of "Charlie's Aunt"
tomorrow night at 8:15 in Memorial Auditorium.
Since the first seven performances of "Charlie's Aunt" were given at
Army Camps, the actors performed before bare walls or simple draperies.

â–ºBut William Girvan has designee
two sets for the Stanford production.
The first act takes place in Jack's
j room at Oxford, where beer stein?
i adorn the yellow wallpaper, and
pewter mugs and plates rest on the
bright green woodwork.
The set is completed with leaded
window panes, heavy oak furniture.
I and a large sofa.
The exterior of the college, with its
! heavy walls and arches provides the
setting for the second act. In thi?
garden scene, a long chase, reminis
cent of the Keystone Cop era, takes
place, as members of the cast rur.
through doors, up stairs, and over
walls.
During the show, David Sievers,
who portrays "Charlie's Aunt," is
forced to gobble down quantities of
sliced tomatoes and mayonnaise.
The acts have been arranged so
| that the shift between acts will be
rapid.
