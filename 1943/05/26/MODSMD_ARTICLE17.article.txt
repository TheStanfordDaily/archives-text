LONDON, Wednesday, May 26 â€”A
great force of R.A.F. heavy bombers
screamed across the channel toward
Europe early today in a procession
that lasted 13 minutes, as the Allied
air offensive against Germany con
tinued unabated.

American-built bombers of the
R.A.F. yesterday attacked an enemy
field at Abbeville, France, while
German planes in a weak reprisal
for the devastation of Dortmund,
battered a town on the south coast
of England.
Twenty-five German planes swept
in over the south coast town Tues
day afternoon, bombing a working
class district where they demolished

several houses and killed at least 12
persons.
