This next Saturday marks the end
of the current baseball season as far
as the Stanford team is concerned.
Some might say that it has been a
disastrous season for the Reds, but
those who look more closely might
see the situation in a different light.
It would appear to be more of a
tribute to the fine coaching ability
of Ilarry YVolter and to the fine team
spirit of the boys he coached. It is
hard for a team to lose and still
carry on with the chatter and hustle
that denotes a first class ball club.
It is hard also for a coach to keep
from becoming disheartened when
he sends his men onto a field with
the feeling that no matter what, all
is useless.
At the start of the season things
looked mighty bad for Stanford and
they resided in the cellar for better
than half the season. Every team
had beaten them at least once. Then
the coaching and spirit that Wolter
had lent the team began to show it
self and the boys really started to
look like a house-afire. So, the In
dians finished the circuit in third
place, winning one game from sec
ond-place Santa Clara and two
each from St. Mary's and U.S.F.
That is not a bad record for a team
that lost a large amount of its per
sonnel to the Armed Services

Let's not overlook a few facts like
these before we condemn a fine ball
club and label it as an all-time loser.
Wolter put out the best team he
possibly could and he is deserving of
the praise due him.
