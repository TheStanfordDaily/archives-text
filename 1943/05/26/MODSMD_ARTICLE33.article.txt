ONE of the most unpleasant duties of the Editor is to write the
traditional editorial to the loser. It's difficult to do .Yet one
cannot work on The Daily for three years without knowing the
worth of a person.
The position of managing editor is a hard, thankless, unend
ing job. It is she who assigns the stories, checks on the erring
reporters. It is she who fills the paper with news.
As you were a good copyreader, H.C.E., Night Editor, and then
Associate, so will you be a good Managing Editor.
