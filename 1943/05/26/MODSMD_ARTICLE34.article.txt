# On Steering a Course
## 
### 
NOW we are in the midst of a great transition. By discussion
and planning we are trying to shape for ourselves and for
all humanity a world of happiness and peace. This is not 6nly a
transition for the world, but in a much smaller sense, for our
University.
It is for us to give some thought to what course we want
Stanford to follow and what kind of a college we want it to be.
When Stanford was first founded, it was tuition free. Since then
much has changed. Stanford is now and always has been an
educational institution of high standard, but in recent years we
seem to have gone astray.
The privately endowed university has many advantages. It
has freedom from state politics, its complete mastery over its own
destiny. But too, it has its disadvantages. It does not have the un
limited bankroll that state supported institutions have.
Stanford is in the business 01 selling education which is
almost a non-salable commodity. Too often the students get the
teeling that they are "being promoted," and that upon entering
Stanford they are embarking on a four-year siege for pleas to
support their University and a great many charities. The students
are not selfish nor do they not love their University the less, but
the "make all checks payable" feeling—that of being high pres
sured into something —persists.
Stanford is not a trade school turning out vast classes of men
and women who are capable of paying the tuition. It is a great
University of high degree. It is for us to keep it such and again
steer it on the right track.

If we are to have publicity, let it be of a dignified nature —not
how much money has been collected in gifts. We have great pro
fessors who are making original contributions to education. It
is they who deserve the credit.
Let us steer toward a University that is the best. Let us make
Stanford more academic. Let us have, as the Financial Vice-
President recently said in Los Angeles, "a goal of quality rather
than quantity"—harder to get in and harder to stay in.
