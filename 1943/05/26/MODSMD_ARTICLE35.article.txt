# Campus Opinion

The Editor, Sir:
I was talking to some soldiers the other night. They were
part of Stanford's STAR Unit. Both were college graduates. One
had graduated from Law School, had received three college de
grees. Both agreed upon one statement, that there was a barrier
which existed between the soldiers on campus and the students.
They felt that students tended to look down upon the soldiers with
a feeling that they, the soldiers, were inferior.
Stanford students should be ashamed that such an attitude
should exist, even if only among a few soldiers on campus. Every
boy in the STAR Unit is here at Stanford because he is a specialist
in some particular field. Most of them have obtained their college
degrees or have had at least two years of college. Many have
received other degrees besides their A.B. They are decidedly
not inferior to the Stanford student.
The boys in the STAR Unit are each and every one taking
the place of a student in order that the latter might finish his
college year.
It is up to the Stanford student to see that this barrier will
no longer exist between the soldiers and the student civilians.
Signed: ONE WHO HEARS.
