# 'Charlie's Aunt' Begins Campus Showing Tonight
## 
### 
"Charlie's Aunt,'' popular British comedy for over 50 years, opens tonight
in Memorial Auditorium promptly at 8:15 and will continue to play Friday
and Saturday nights.
" 'Charlie's Aunt' can be compared to few other plays written in the
Nineties," said David Sievers, leading man. "It is funny because the situa-

'tions are genuinely funny, not be
cause they seem ridiculously quaint j
to us moderns. It could be played ijj
in modern costumes at high noon in :
a corn-field, and it would still be j
funny."
Sievers played the role of "Char
lie's Aunt" last summer with Wood
stock of New York, and associated
with a Britisher and an Australian
who had played the same part in
their countries.
Tips on the Role
According to Sievers, he received
much of the heritage of the part from
these gentlemen who gave him many ,
tips on the comic side of the role.
"I love the part of 'Charlie's
Aunt'," Sievers said. "I've played in
many other shows, but I'd rather
play in this than anything that's
been written."
Sievers learned the lines in a week
last summer while he was playing
nights in another show. Then he
didn't look at the lines for a year, he
said, but they stuck. This spring he
was ready to begin immediate re
hearsal of them.
Discovered by Strickland
Beginning his dramatic career
while still in high school, Sievers, j
who is now assistant dramatic di
rector here, was discovered by F.
j Cowles Strickland in his St. Louis j
j school. Sievers' first big part was in
"Winterset."
I :
Since then he has played in "Our
Town" with Thornton Wilder, and
with Clifton Webb, Libby Holman,
Louis Calhern, Sam Jaffe, Stella Ad
. ler, Julie Hayden, Michael Whalen,
j Claire Luce, Donald Cook, and
j others.
In 1936 he spent the summer with .
j the Globe Shakespearian Theater j
Company in San Diego.
Sievers commented that in "Char- |
lie's Aunt" he has but five pages of |
! script in which to change his dress
I from that of an Oxford scholar to '
I the maiden aunt. He has the change ,
| so perfected that on a certain line j
he hooks his skirt, on another he j
puts on his wig, and so on.
' Show Splits His Seams
His costume has to be resewn j
after every performance, since he's
treated so roughly that all the |
seams split.
In the course of rehearsals and â– 
performances at Army Camps, Siev- ,
ers has had to smoke about 15 ci
gars, which he loathes, and has bro
ken three fans, to which he really j
gives a workout.
Strickland is directing the show,
and Ruth Froelick is stage manager,
j The sets have been designed by Wil- !
j liam Girvan. lighting is by Theo I
| Linhart, properties by Chris Mans

I rector.
