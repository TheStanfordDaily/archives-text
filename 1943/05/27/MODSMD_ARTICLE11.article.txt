The end of this week will mark
the first two weeks of classes fo:
the ASTU soldiers; this "getting
bac kin the groove" deserves a cele
bration. Company E and Company F
are both composed of real G.I. stu
dents and as such intend to celebratt-:
the fact this Friday night at the G.I
Dance.
Cadet Capt. L. Rich of Company E
has been pondering about what thr;
gal back home would think, but he
has finally decided that it would be
treason to miss the fun. Talk about
fun, it has been impossible to sleep
the past few nights with some of the
men practicing original songs to be
sung by the only quartet in the
world consisting of six men.
For you who are worrying about
the difference between the ASTUS
and ASTARS, the ASTARS even
tually become ASTUS, but not nec
essarily at the same school. The
ASTARS are taking tests to find
their places in an ASTU unit. But
forget this alphabet soup stuff ana
see it first hand at the G.I. Dance
this Fridav in the Women's Gym.
