## Klemmer Won't Run Saturday In 880 Against Johnny Fulton 
### 
Grover Klemmer, California world record hClder, once again has chosen
not to run against Stanford's Johnny Fulton. Card track Coach Pitch
Johnson was informed of this fact Tuesday by two San Francisco sports
writers.
Klemmer, according to these scribes, is behind in his studies and must

spend his time over the weekend â™¦
preparing for finals, instead of run
ning against Fulton in the 880 in the
Pacific Association meet Saturday.
The Stanford runner, who has J
been looking forward to meeting i
Klemmer all year, elected Monday
to enter the 880 only, just to get a
crack at the Cal star. Johnny will
still run the two-lap event Satur
day, however.
Johnson also released the rest of
the Farm entry list for the meet, j
The 18-man team entered includes ;
Bob Fess and Bob Carr in the 100;
Fess in the 220; Glen Holtby, Bruce
Meyer, and Dud Cramer in the
quarter; Wayne Girdner and Fulton ;
in the 880; Bob Compton in the mile; j
Dave Bills in the two-mile; Willard
Smith, Bob Zaleska, Ed Luce, and !
George Jones in the high jump; Carr
and Johnny Smith in the broad jump j
and hop-step-and jump; Ed Chyno- ;
weth in the shot; Milt Walkup in ;
the discus; and Walkup, Chynoweth, j
and A1 Pande in the javelin.
In addition to Klemmer, several
other California trackmen probably j
won't compete because of finals, thus j
giving the Cards their best chance I
of the year to upset the Bears.
