# Student Government and Mr. Masters
## 
### 
AN unfortunate situation exists at Stanford. The Executive
Committee passes on athletic awards, yet it is the B.A.C.
which gives them out. Even in normal times this divided author
ity is unhealthy, but in this time of war the situation has proved
disastrous.
Mr. Masters, the general manager of the 8.A.C., has ag
gravated this already unfortunate situation by not cooperating
with the A.S.S.U. He has paid little or no attention to the requests
of the student government.
The following situations have developed as a result of this
lack of cooperation:
1. Excom, taking into consideration the effect war has had
upon the sports situation at Stanford, voted to make rugby a
major sport. Mr. Masters held these awards up as long as pos
sible. He has refused to grant Block S cards to those deserving
them. This is very unfortunate since even if they are eventually
granted the players will be in the Armed Services.
2. Excom voted special awards to the two rugby managers
on the recommendations of the coach and the players. This was
a special award to these bodies and had nothing to do with the
regular senior managerial award usually given. For weeks Mr.
Masters delayed and now having been forced by a serious and
determined Excom has condescended to give one award. Both
deserve them. Both should get them no matter what the disposi
tion of Mr. Masters.
If student government is of value, let us have justice and
dispatch on the athletic awards. At the same time we should
endeavor to clarify the relation of the A.S.S.U. and the B.A.C.
2nd Mr. Masters' relation to the whole picture.
