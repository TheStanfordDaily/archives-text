## To You, Miss Stanford 
### 
We owe our thanks.
Yes, thank you for your social generosity, your bubbling
welcome, your untempered enthusiasm.
We appreciate it . . . and to show our gratitude we're saluting
you this Friday evening, May 28, at the Women's Gym with an
informal Cadet-Coed G.I. Dance. We'd like to have you on hand
io help us to thank you.
Your admission price will be a popular brand of cigarettes
. . . and one cadet.
Won't you come? Cadet Si Weintraub
