## 
### Joan Hodgdon 
Plans for this year's traditional
Senior Ball indicate that it will be
the same magnificent occasion that
it has been in years past despite the
problems produced by the war. The
ball, the last formal congregration
of the Class of '43 before they grad
uate, will be held June 11 in the
"blaeked-out" Women's Clubhouse
and Union Court.
The Senior Ball, one of Stanford's
traditions, has always been a night
which graduating students remem
ber long after they have left the
Farm." This year will be no ex
ception. The night of June 11 prom
ises to be a gala occasion, enjoyed
and remembered by everyone.
"Plans for the ball are nearing
their completion," says George Hell
yer. co-chairman of the dance com
mittee, "and we expect it to be a
smooth dance that will be a fitting
climax to four years at Stanford."
Juniors are being invited to this
ball, which has been in the past ex
clusively for seniors, because many
of the juniors may be unable to
com? back for their last year, and
there may be no Senior Ball next
ye;.r. Juniors, therefore, are urged
to remain two days after finals in
order to attend this dance, the last
of the quarter.
All seniors and juniors are urged
to obtain their bids right away for
the ball, They are on sale at the
A.S.S.U office for $(> a couple, which
is a reduction of GO cents from last
year. The dance will be held from
10 p.m. to 4 a.m.
Gary Nottingham and his orches
tra. familiar to all Stanford stu
dents. will provide the music for the
dance. The Clubhouse and Union
Court will be decorated with the

theme of "blackouts as we remem- t
ber them." Lighted with dim lights, J
familiar sights will become recog
nizable to the dancers. Parts of the
clubhouse will be decorated as Di
nah's, L'Omelette, and Mangini's.
In the basement of the Clubhouse,
which will represent Dinah's, break
last will be served from 1 to 4 a.m.
; This breakfast will include a plenti
ful supply of tomato juice or ap- j
i plesauce, scrambled eggs, cinnamon !
