# Charlie's Aunt Is Success
## 
### 
Wars may come and wars may go j
but "Charlie's Aunt" goes on for- i
ever. It is one of the most succss
ful plays ever written and the Stan
ford Players' presentation is a howl
ing success with the emphasis on the
howling.
After a rather slow start, the play
gets off to a fast clip with the en- ,
trance of David Sievers as Lord Bab- |
berley. His lordship is strongly re
quested to play the part of Charlie's j
aunt because that esteemed lady has I
not shown up. She was to have been j
chaperone at a luncheon Charlie and j
his friend were giving for their lady '
loves. The girls could not come with
out the chaperone, hence Lord Bab
berley as Charlie's aunt. And what
a picnic David Sievers has with the
part.
"Babby," as a venerable old lady,
causes the two young fellows a great
deal of anguish. The complications
which arise when the father of one
of the boys and the guardian of the
two young girls propose to him are
very amusing for the audience. Vir
gil Anderson as the father and Ches
ter Barker as the grouchy guardian
are excellent. The chases through
the garden with Babby in long skirts
leading, and the two men pursuing,
j are a highlight of the second act.
