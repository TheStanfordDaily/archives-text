# Bookstore Gives 8 Per Cent Rebate
## 
### 
The Stanford Bookstore will dis- j
tribute an 8 per cent rebate to all
students who have turned in their
rebate slips on next Monday, May
31, between the hours of 8-11 and
2-4.
The 8 per cent rebate is equal to
last year's June rebate which was
the highest return the Bookstore had
made to students since the boom year i
of 1929.
