# Stanford Life Changes With War Year
## 
### 
Touching ihe unique high points of a war year at
Stanford, it becomes apparent that women and men
in uniform have taken over the campus for the dura
tion.
Heading the list of women who filled top posts va
cated when the some 500 members of the Enlisted Re
serve Corps was called up in March is Janet McClana
han. who was elected first woman student body presi
dent of the University.
Shortly after the E.R.C. left, soldiers began to take
up lodgings in Sequoia, Branner. Toyon, and finally
Encina. Marching columns have become a familiar
sight between classes on the Quad, and uniforms have
been the predominate dress as some 12.000 men have
been stationed here.
Later Spring Quarter, the Farm's second year ad
vanced R.0.1.C. units were transferred to the E.R.C.
and made a quick trip to Monterey, returning com
pletely G.I. equipped.
Most important news of the year on the administra
tive side of the University was the election of Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder to the presidency, by the Board
of Trustees. He will succeed Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur in September.

Throughout the year, Stanford
students not directly connected with
war service have done their part in
auxiliary capacities. A regular
quota has been filled at the Red
Cross Blood Donor service, and dur
ing the harvesting season, many stu
dents worked on crop crews.
Coordinating the campus war
work was Betty May Hale, head of
the War Board, which took charge
of vital duties performed by stu
dents.
Although Spring Quarter found
students left with little time to bask
in the sun, two Stanford men. Bob
Brown and Bob McClean, found
themselves heroes after spending a
day at San Gregorio beach. These
two rescued a Coast Guard flier
after witnessing a plane crash 200
yards beyond the ocean breakers.
At the end of Winter Quarter, fol
lowing a shortened rushing system,
Roble sponsors petitioned to repre
sentatives ol the nine sororities that
they eliminate the so-called evils of
the rushing system by withdrawing
from the campus. Actions and plans
are still pending.
