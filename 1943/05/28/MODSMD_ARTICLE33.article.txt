# Dear Jane:

Writing a letter to a girl is difficult at best, but writing an
open letter is very difficult—an open letter that will be read
by hundreds of passively interested readers —that can't help
incorporate some of the little secret personal feelings about The
Daily that have been accumulated in three years of work.
The Daily has changed from the prosperous eight-column
paper that we knew as tryoutees to the starving, ad poor, little
Tabby that is the questionable object of our affection. The noisy
electrifying pounding of the United Press teletype machines is
gone. The staff is reduced. But for all these changes we hope
that our Tabby—that Volume 103—has been as good as those
in the past, and timorously we hope that it has been better than
some.
Volume 103 has been severely criticized for its editorials and
the fact that it has not commented adequately on the war and
national political situations. This criticism is justified to a large
degree, but it has always been our idea that The Daily should
be a campus newspaper. It is about affairs on the campus that
our readers are most interested in finding in it. Too, we felt that
we were not qualified to write more than the opinions of rank
amateurs on serious world events. We feel that there are enough
unqualified armchair generals in this war without our adding
to the confusion.
The change to the five-column paper has created many new
problems. We have tried to improve the readability of the paper
by running labels. Although we never got the one on the Tues
day Series correct, they are good. So is Bodoni type.
As John said to me so I will say to you. There are a great
many factions at Stanford. People will want their names in the
paper, the names of their houses, or a special editorial. You,
fane, are now an ex-officio member of many committees. At first
they are sort of interesting, but then they will bore you. You
will see that they are like house meetings where you argue for
an hour whether to take the funny papers upstairs when it won't
do any good anyway—but then that is committee life at Stanford.
Don't let it get you down. Committee members, each with his
own little axe to grind, take their duties pretty seriously. Keep
them in perspective—laugh at them. Make fun of them occa
sionally.
In this last editorial, it has long been the tradition to say nice
things about everyone on the staff, and to pick out individuals
for special compliments. Not here. I have had a good staff both
this quarter and last quarter. Rather than list each according to
bis merit, and then hand out long lists of compliments that, listed
in the grey type of editorials, look like paid testimonials, I hope
the personal satisfaction of a job well done will be ample re
ward.
If The Daily has had any editorial policy this year it has
been for the abolition of sororities. For the good of Stanford I
hope that you will carry on this campaign editorially. It merits
the dignified, honest support of The Daily.
The Daily is the voice of the student body. When its mem
bers don't get a square deal, don't hesitate to help them. But
then too, Jane, remember that your voice is three thousand times
as loud as the ordinary individual's, so don't shout.
Charlie's coming in tonight was good. To him and to the
Batman we owe much. To Mr. Jones and to Lon we owe much
also. All have been harsh masters and good friends.
As the last of a line of male Daily editors 22 years long, I am
in a unique position. To be cited in my favor is the new spot of
floor in the shack. i i|«. •
To you I leave The Daily. You were elected because of your
worth. To you I leave the task of arguing in Polish with the en
graver and then fixing his off-size cuts. To you I leave the messy
ciesk, and the swivel chair. It's tricky. As John said, don't let
it throw you.
As the man in Flanders Field said, as the 22 years of male
editors would say, "To you from failing hands we throw the
torch; be yours to hold it high."
Good luck. A1
