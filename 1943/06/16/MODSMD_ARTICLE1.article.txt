FOOTBALL AND THE ARMY
According to the United Press,
three former athletes now Congress
men '"kicked off" the other day to
open the battle against the War De
partment's ban on participation by
soldier-students in college athletic
competition.
The Representatives — Monroney
(D., Okla.), R. Weiss (D., Wis.), and
A. Weiss (D., Pa.)—declared that
only by dropping this ban could
intercollegiate football keep going
next fall.
The three Congressmen have made
a good start in the right direction,
but it will take plenty of high-pres
suring to force the idea through be
fore the grid season.
There can be little argument as to
its worth. Although all the coaches
on the Coast carried out strenuous
spring practice sessions, the majority
agree that not more than five or six
of those gridders around now will
be back in the fall. Anyone can't
be molded into a football player in
a couple of weeks' time, so those in
tercollegiate teams to be fielded in
the fall could hardly measure up
even to high school standards with
out recruits from the ranks of the
soldier-students.
Then there's this point: The four
Southern Division schools have ten
tatively planned a home and home
schedule which would prove one of
the toughest ever attempted. Lack
ing, as they probably will, depth in
most positions, coaches will have to
work their first strings longer and
harder. With the soldier-students
available, howeve r, substitutes
would be plentiful and the yearling
gridders wouldn't be forced to pull
iron man stunts every time they
went out on the field.
The big objection to soldier-stu
dent participation comes from the
Army, or rather from Maj. Gen. M.
J. White, the gentleman who wrote
the older which keeps the Army's
college trainees out of intercollegiate
competition.
According to the three Congress
men already mentioned. White just
"can t understand—he's never played
football. He's assuming an arbitrary
attitude."
It looks as if Maj. Gen. White's
attitude will either have to change,
or football as we know it is through.
RECORDS DUG UP
Mr. Edgar McDowell, a Stanford
grad, is what the city sportswriters
would term a "track nut." After
reading Slants of Tuesday, May 25,
in which we crabbed about the lack
ot a list of Stanford track records,
Mr. McDowell sat down with his file
of Quads and track programs and
compiled such a list.
Thursday night he brought it over
to us, along with just about all the
data on Stanford nigh jumpers from
1912 on up. The dope is just what
we wanted, and proves that Stanford
track captain Willard Smith now
holds the University record for the
high jump at 6 feet 7 :, .j inches.
Histroy of the record runs some
thing like this: In 1912 Card track
ster George Horine set a new world
record for the high jump at 6 feet 7
inches. In 1928, after a new type of
jumping standards making it much
easier to knock the bar off had been
instituted, King of Stanford leaped
(>-(>'.i. Then in 193G down at U.C.
L.A., Farm jumper Humbert Smith
cleared 6-7 Vi on his first try, after
making G-5 on his fourth. Thus the
high jump record is all Willard's, and
we think he'll improve on it before
the season's over—perhaps tomor
row or in the N.C.A.A. meet.
LAST COLUMN
Today's column is 30 for this quar
ter's Sideliner, and we can't say
we're too sorry about the whole
thing. With the help of Late Wil
liams and Bill Allen, who turned
out plenty of swell sports copy, we
kept the page going against the on
slaught of the rest of the predomi
nantly feminine staff. We had a
rough but great time doing it.

FOOTBALL AND THE ARMY
According to the United Press,
three former athletes now Congress
men '"kicked off" the other day to
open the battle against the War De
partment's ban on participation by
soldier-students in college athletic
competition.
The Representatives — Monroney
(D., Okla.), R. Weiss (D., Wis.), and
A. Weiss (D., Pa.)—declared that
only by dropping this ban could
intercollegiate football keep going
next fall.
The three Congressmen have made
a good start in the right direction,
but it will take plenty of high-pres
suring to force the idea through be
fore the grid season.
There can be little argument as to
its worth. Although all the coaches
on the Coast carried out strenuous
spring practice sessions, the majority
agree that not more than five or six
of those gridders around now will
be back in the fall. Anyone can't
be molded into a football player in
a couple of weeks' time, so those in
tercollegiate teams to be fielded in
the fall could hardly measure up
even to high school standards with
out recruits from the ranks of the
soldier-students.
Then there's this point: The four
Southern Division schools have ten
tatively planned a home and home
schedule which would prove one of
the toughest ever attempted. Lack
ing, as they probably will, depth in
most positions, coaches will have to
work their first strings longer and
harder. With the soldier-students
available, howeve r, substitutes
would be plentiful and the yearling
gridders wouldn't be forced to pull
iron man stunts every time they
went out on the field.
The big objection to soldier-stu
dent participation comes from the
Army, or rather from Maj. Gen. M.
J. White, the gentleman who wrote
the older which keeps the Army's
college trainees out of intercollegiate
competition.
According to the three Congress
men already mentioned. White just
"can t understand—he's never played
football. He's assuming an arbitrary
attitude."
It looks as if Maj. Gen. White's
attitude will either have to change,
or football as we know it is through.

Mr. Edgar McDowell, a Stanford
grad, is what the city sportswriters
would term a "track nut." After
reading Slants of Tuesday, May 25,
in which we crabbed about the lack
ot a list of Stanford track records,
Mr. McDowell sat down with his file
of Quads and track programs and
compiled such a list.
Thursday night he brought it over
to us, along with just about all the
data on Stanford nigh jumpers from
1912 on up. The dope is just what
we wanted, and proves that Stanford
track captain Willard Smith now
holds the University record for the
high jump at 6 feet 7 :, .j inches.
Histroy of the record runs some
thing like this: In 1912 Card track
ster George Horine set a new world
record for the high jump at 6 feet 7
inches. In 1928, after a new type of
jumping standards making it much
easier to knock the bar off had been
instituted, King of Stanford leaped
(>-(>'.i. Then in 193G down at U.C.
L.A., Farm jumper Humbert Smith
cleared 6-7 Vi on his first try, after
making G-5 on his fourth. Thus the
high jump record is all Willard's, and
we think he'll improve on it before
the season's over—perhaps tomor
row or in the N.C.A.A. meet.

FOOTBALL AND THE ARMY
According to the United Press,
three former athletes now Congress
men '"kicked off" the other day to
open the battle against the War De
partment's ban on participation by
soldier-students in college athletic
competition.
The Representatives — Monroney
(D., Okla.), R. Weiss (D., Wis.), and
A. Weiss (D., Pa.)—declared that
only by dropping this ban could
intercollegiate football keep going
next fall.
The three Congressmen have made
a good start in the right direction,
but it will take plenty of high-pres
suring to force the idea through be
fore the grid season.
There can be little argument as to
its worth. Although all the coaches
on the Coast carried out strenuous
spring practice sessions, the majority
agree that not more than five or six
of those gridders around now will
be back in the fall. Anyone can't
be molded into a football player in
a couple of weeks' time, so those in
tercollegiate teams to be fielded in
the fall could hardly measure up
even to high school standards with
out recruits from the ranks of the
soldier-students.
Then there's this point: The four
Southern Division schools have ten
tatively planned a home and home
schedule which would prove one of
the toughest ever attempted. Lack
ing, as they probably will, depth in
most positions, coaches will have to
work their first strings longer and
harder. With the soldier-students
available, howeve r, substitutes
would be plentiful and the yearling
gridders wouldn't be forced to pull
iron man stunts every time they
went out on the field.
The big objection to soldier-stu
dent participation comes from the
Army, or rather from Maj. Gen. M.
J. White, the gentleman who wrote
the older which keeps the Army's
college trainees out of intercollegiate
competition.
According to the three Congress
men already mentioned. White just
"can t understand—he's never played
football. He's assuming an arbitrary
attitude."
It looks as if Maj. Gen. White's
attitude will either have to change,
or football as we know it is through.
RECORDS DUG UP
Mr. Edgar McDowell, a Stanford
grad, is what the city sportswriters
would term a "track nut." After
reading Slants of Tuesday, May 25,
in which we crabbed about the lack
ot a list of Stanford track records,
Mr. McDowell sat down with his file
of Quads and track programs and
compiled such a list.
Thursday night he brought it over
to us, along with just about all the
data on Stanford nigh jumpers from
1912 on up. The dope is just what
we wanted, and proves that Stanford
track captain Willard Smith now
holds the University record for the
high jump at 6 feet 7 :, .j inches.
Histroy of the record runs some
thing like this: In 1912 Card track
ster George Horine set a new world
record for the high jump at 6 feet 7
inches. In 1928, after a new type of
jumping standards making it much
easier to knock the bar off had been
instituted, King of Stanford leaped
(>-(>'.i. Then in 193G down at U.C.
L.A., Farm jumper Humbert Smith
cleared 6-7 Vi on his first try, after
making G-5 on his fourth. Thus the
high jump record is all Willard's, and
we think he'll improve on it before
the season's over—perhaps tomor
row or in the N.C.A.A. meet.
