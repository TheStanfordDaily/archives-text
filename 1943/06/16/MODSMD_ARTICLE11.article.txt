# Water Polo, Swimming Teams Top Pacific Coast in Strength
## 
### 
It was a big year for the Cards in
swimming and water polo. In both
sports Coach Ernie Brandsten turned
j out teams that shaped up as the best
! in the country, although their prow
| ess was never tested beyond the re
| gions of the Pacific Coast.
In water polo Brandsten's men
I turned in a six won and only two
: lost record for the season, a record

compiled against the best "competi
tion that the Coast had to offer.
In the opening game of the year,
the Cards took a 4-2 decision from
a highly touted Pre-Flight team,
and added four more wins in a row.
San Jose succumbing 7-4, Pre-
Flight again falling, this time 12-7,
j the Olympic Club, 10-8, and the

I Dons again, 9-6.
The mermen tasted their first de
i feat in a rematch with the Club, 8-5,
1 after the Farm squad had been
J weakened with injuries.
Still in a weakened condition, and
coupled with a tight California de
i fense, the Indians dropped their sec
ond and final contest, 3-2 to the
' Bears.
In the rematch, it was Stanford all
I the way, Cal smothered under a 6-4
| score.
Highlights in swimming were
| Emmett Cashin and an undefeated
' team. Although possessing what was
| considered to be the top club in the
I nation, the Cards had only a couple
! of meets in which to prove it.
Stanford and Cashin both came
through to nip the number two
j ranked team on the Coast, College
I of Pacific, 38-37, by virtue of win-
J ning the final event on the program,
i the 400-yard relay.
Far overshadowing the teams win,
j however, was the individual per
| formance of Cashin, who did the sup
posedly impossible task of erasing
seven breaststroke records off the
| books, including three world marks.
California was dropped by the In
dians 40-35, with Cashin this time
smashing the 12-year Stanford-Cal
record in the 220-yard freestyle.
Added mention should be given to
j freshman Brenda Helser who cap
tured the A.A.U. 220 free style cham
, pionship in Chicago.

a highly touted Pre-Flight team,
and added four more wins in a row.
San Jose succumbing 7-4, Pre-
Flight again falling, this time 12-7,
j the Olympic Club, 10-8, and the

I Dons again, 9-6.
The mermen tasted their first de
i feat in a rematch with the Club, 8-5,
1 after the Farm squad had been
J weakened with injuries.
Still in a weakened condition, and
coupled with a tight California de
i fense, the Indians dropped their sec
ond and final contest, 3-2 to the
' Bears.
In the rematch, it was Stanford all
I the way, Cal smothered under a 6-4
| score.
Highlights in swimming were
| Emmett Cashin and an undefeated
' team. Although possessing what was
| considered to be the top club in the
I nation, the Cards had only a couple
! of meets in which to prove it.
Stanford and Cashin both came
through to nip the number two
j ranked team on the Coast, College
I of Pacific, 38-37, by virtue of win-
J ning the final event on the program,
i the 400-yard relay.
Far overshadowing the teams win,
j however, was the individual per
| formance of Cashin, who did the sup
posedly impossible task of erasing
seven breaststroke records off the
| books, including three world marks.
California was dropped by the In
dians 40-35, with Cashin this time
smashing the 12-year Stanford-Cal
record in the 220-yard freestyle.
Added mention should be given to
j freshman Brenda Helser who cap
tured the A.A.U. 220 free style cham
, pionship in Chicago.
