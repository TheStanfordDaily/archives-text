# STANFORD T ENDS UP BEST ON
## COAST 
### 
On Sept. 26. 1042, Stanford had the
worst football team on the Coast;
Nov. 21 Stanford had the best.
The miracle thus wrought by Head
Coach Marchie Schwartz, developing
as he did a green backfield into a
polished T-formation quartet, was
one of the two features of the Farm's
'42 grid season. The other, of course,
was Stanford's 26-7 victory over
California.
A big, powerful Washington State
squad was the Indians' first oppon
ent, and ended up with a 6-0 victory,
after the Stanford lads had dis
played a feeble offense and a much
feebler pass defense.
The following week it was much
the same story; Stanford's line held
the Santa Clara Broncos scoreless,
but the backfield let a couple of Jess
Freitas' passes get over their heads
into the arms of Alyn Beals, and the
Broncs had a 14-0 lead. The Indians
suddenly came to life in the final
quarter as Buck Fawcett took a fiat
pass and went 34 yards down the
sidelines to score in the waning
minutes.
Back at South Bend after the Santa
Clara loss, the luckless Cards took
an aerial beating once again, Notre
Dame scoring all its touchdowns on
passes. In the first half Buck Faw
cett, Chuck Taylor, and the rest of
the gang nearly got going a couple
of times, but once within the Notre
Dame 30, couldn't do a thing.

Having lost three games in a row
Stanford was little better than evei
money to top Idaho, its next oppon
ent. All the stored-up T-formatior
power the Farm's backfield had beer

Don Zappettini, A 1 Hoisch,

came to life at once, resulting in the
54-7 walkaway.
Victory fever hit the Stanford
campus once again as Schwartz be

Stadium 10-8 underdogs, came out
