# Rugby Squad Goes Through Season Undefeated; Voted Major Sport
## 
### 
Rugby had its best season in years
coming through a tough schedule
vithout suffering a defeat. The Ex
ecutive Committee put the final cap
on a perfect season by raising Rugby
1o the rank of a major sport and
awarding letters for the first time.
The Indians opened the season
f.gainst the Royal Navy and pro
ceeded to give them a sound wallop

ing to the tune of 29-0. Continuing
their winning ways the ruggers next
took on the powerful Olympic Club
crew and beat them twice, taking
them completely to camp in the first
contest 17-3. Another win from the
British Navy and the crowning
achievement of the season, the de
feat of the California Bears, rounded
out the program.

Captain Rog Laverty led his team
all season long in the scoring depart
ment as well as playing a fine game
all around. He was ably assisted in
the backfield by Buck Fawcett, Dick
Munroe, Jack Shields, Bob Lamport,
and Bob Hind.
In the scrum the outstanding play
ers were Hank Norberg, Howie
Council and Bill Mannon who, with
McClean, Monteverde, Bernhardt,
Brown, and Ross, made up the
toughest front line in these parts.
As usual Coach Harry Maloney
ably guided the boys through the
season. As a new inovation he was
assisted this year by Marchie
Schwartz, Jim Wylie, "Ducky" Da
vis, and Ralph Ebner.
Rugby is growing in importance
due to the war for it is a sport that
requires little traveling and thus
does not necessitate the trips to dis
tant places in order to find compe
tition.
