Soccer had only a mediocre sea
son winning two. losing four and
tying three. The Keds were able to
come out on top against only San
Mateo and Menlo Junior Colleges.
The big thorn in the side of Coach
Harry Maloney's boys was the Royal
Navy eleven who beat the Farm men
three games in a row.
Against the Bears, the best Stan
ford was able to salvage was a tie
out of the two-game series, losing
the first game by a 3-1 score and
coming from behind in the second to
lie it tip 2 and 2.
Ties with U.S.F. and San Fran
cisco State completed the season for
the Cards.
