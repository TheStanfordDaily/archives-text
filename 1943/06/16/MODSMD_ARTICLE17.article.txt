# Cardinal Cagers
## Tie for Second 
### 
Although Everett Dean's basket
ball team did not hit the glory road
to the N.C.A.A. title for a repeat
performance, they did manage to
put together enough wins to garner
a tie for second place in the South
ern Division of the Pacific Coast
Conference.
Highlights of the season were a
three-game win splurge against
U.C.L.A. and Cal that brought the
Indi farsnom the depths of ladder
standings, the fact that center Ed
Voss took third place in the indi
vidual scoring race, and the placing
of guard Howie Dallmar on the All-
Southern Division first string.
The Cards opened the year against
the Great Lakes Naval Training Sta
tion and the University of Illinois.
The Sailors whipped the Indians
57-41, and the fighting Illini took a
38-26 decision.
Hank Too Much
In their first home games, the
great Hank Luisetti proved to be a
little too much, as he led the St.
Mary's Pre-Flight to decisive wins
over the Stanford five.
Southern California came north to
meet the Cards in the opening game
of the conference season with a
team that later won the southern
division crown, losing to Washing
ton in the Coast finals. Although
Dean's cagers put on a desperation
rally in the final half, the Trojans,
by virtue of piling up a 12-3 lead in
the first 10 minutes, took the game
41-32. In the rematch with S.C. in
Los Angeles, Trojans' Gene Rock,
and the long prayer shots of Ted
Gossard broke up a tight ball game
in hte second half. Result—67-49.
liig Series
The Big Series against California
went to the Indians, three games to
one, the Bears taking the first game
33-32, thanks to Chuck Hanger's
free throw in the final minute of the
game.
In their second meeting, the Cards
came out on the long end of a 36-34
score, this time Stanford's Jack Dana
dropped a two-hand set shot with
10 seconds to go for the clincher.
Split With U.C.L.A.
The third and fourth games of
the series went to the rejuvenated
Indians with little difficulty. In the
first, iLnari's 16 points, coupled with
14 by Voss, made the winning mar
gin 53-45. The last game proved to
be a repeat performance of the pre
vious evening.
It was an even split for Stanford
in their two games with U.C.LA.
At West wood, U.C.L.A. managed to
hold on long enough to take a 60-41
lacing.
