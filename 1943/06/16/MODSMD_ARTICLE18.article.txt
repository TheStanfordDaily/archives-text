# Golfers and Fencers Have Banner Year: Boxers Split Two With California Bears
## 
### 
Showing better than average per
formances in most rmivisions, Stan
ford's minor sports representatives
had a better season this year than
was at first to be expected.
Golfers and fencers were the most
consistent winners, with the divot
men rated as the best squad on the
Coast. The fencers won the Bay
Area championship and continued
their efforts by winning Pacific Coast
Junior Foil Team Championship.
Boxing was not far behind when
they split their two-match series
with Cal. winning the first meeting
by a score of six to four, only to
drop the second encounter to the
Bears 6-3. Crew dragged along in
last place, being able to only eke out
one win, that by the Junior Varsity
over the U.C.L.A. Jayvee.

GOLF
After winning the National Col
legiate Title last year, Coach Eddie
Twiggs turned another top-notch ag
gregation this season. Due to the
transportation difficulties the team
was unable to schedule many
matches, and finally settled for a
home match with San Jose State.
Winning both ends of this easily,
the divotmen looked around for
more worlds to conquer, but were
unable to engage either California
or either of the southern universi
ties.
George Traphagen was number
one man, closely followed by Dave
Doud and Jack Wilson. These three
men formed an invincible trio in
the singles and when followed by
Bob Rosecrance. Bob Barber, Jack
Phillips, Bill Lowe, and Bruce Cord
ingly, the opposition was lucky to
garner a point.
Jack Euphratt. as manager, and
Coach Twiggs believe that this
year's team was another title win
ner if they had had the opportunity
to travel East and compete in the
tourney.

FENCING
Showing up with the '"best team
on the Farm in years," the Indian
fencers walked away with the Paci
fic Coast Junior Foil Team Cham
pionship held in San Francisco by a
score of 5-4. The Reds dropped
their first two bouts, took the third
and then lost the fourth and fifth.
Seemingly out of things the Cards
came back to win the next four and
slide by under the wire with the
title.
Their match was with the strong
Los Angeles Athletic Club aggrega
tion who they became eligible to
meet by winning the Bay Area
eliminations held earlier in the sea
son.
Three men led the team in a fine
fashion. They were Carroll Brad
berry, Harvard Lomax, and John
Carr.
BOXING
Under the able direction of Minor
Sports Director Harry Wolter and
Vic Lindskog, the Red boxing team
was able to split its two-game match
with ihe Bears.

After spotting the Californium
two matches in the first encountei
the Indians came from behind tc
whip the Bears 6-4. Captain Hy He
bert, Malcolm Mynderse, Jim Fer
rari, Ross Dana, Dick Pehl, and Jack
Reynolds were the Stanford poin
winners. In order to give every oru
on the squad a crack at competi
tion, Coach Maloney used his re
serves in the seeond meeting of tht
two squads. The regular Bear powei
was too much and the Reds fell b'
the wayside 6-3.
CKEYV
Unable to get going in the clutch
the crew was able to win only on*
race. Even that was not the first
string crew but the Junior Varsity
who defeated the Bruins juniors b>
one length. In other races the var
sity was nosed out by California
twice and by U.C.L.A. once. The In
dians dropped their first race of tht
season to the Bears by four feet aftei,
having only 20 days practice. In tht
second encounter they were not sc
fortunate, losing by eight lengths
Against the Bruins the rowers agaii
proved impotent and were subdued
by three lengths.
