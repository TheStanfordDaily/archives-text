# Wolter's Nine Wins 5, Drops 7
## 
### 
Placing third in a field of five.
Stanford's baseball nine had only an
average season. They won five games
and lost seven. This record is not as
bad as its sounds, however, for three
of these games were against the Cal
ifornia Bears, who eventually won
the State Crown.
The Red team dropped two series
and won two. They were successful
in defeating the U.S.F. Dons and the
St. Mary's Gaels in two out of three
games. Their other losses were three
games to California and two to Santa
Clara.
Large holes were left in the team
at the end of Winter Quarter when
the Army called the E.R.C. into
service. Principal among those called
was Ray Hammett, football star and
stellar first baseman, who left the In
dians weak at the plate.
Coach Wolter was forced to set up
a new combination afield and at bat.
It was not until late in the season
that this combination smoothed out
and became errorless. Howie Dall
mar was recruited to fill Hammett's
shoes and soon began to hit well.
Hugh Elliot and Jerry Roinestad
started the season alternating at the
keystone sack but were soon re
placed by the freshman find Ben
Cardinelli. With Bob Brown at
short and Jay McKie at third this
formed the youngest and one of the
best infields in the league.
The outfield was composed of four
men who alternated of! and on.
These were Keith Pinion, Ed Wash
burn. Bill Cunha, and Lloyd Merri
man. Merriman was the only regu
lar member of the trio, playing in
every game.
Most of Coach Wolter's troubles
centered around his pitching staff,
where two of his starting pitchers
were useless to him for almost half
the season. Doc Mason, star of the
staff, was injured in the first game
and was unable to pitch again until
the last two games of the season.
Bernard Woody became eligible in
time to pitch only two games before
he was called into the armed forces.
This left most of the hurling duties
to Jack Miller, who came through in
fine style. Dick Flatland, another

freshman, was discovered at the end
of the season and showed up very
well.
To finish off his ball club Wolter
had one of the best catchers in the
league, Ward Walkup. Walkup
stari'ed all season long with his sen

sational play behind the plate anci
was elected acting captain in lieu o
Hammett's absence.
The hitting department was led by
Brown who had an average ug in the
.400's. He was closely followed bj
Merriman, Dallmar, and McKie.


WARD WALKUP, Card first string catcher shown above, proved himself
one of the two top backstops in the C.1.8.A., Northern Section, this
year. Walkups fielding, especially, was outstanding throughout the sea
son. The Card backstop captained the squad after Ray Ilainmctt had
been called bv the E.R.C,
