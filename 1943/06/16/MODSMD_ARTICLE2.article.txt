# Reds Complete Season Against Service Team
## 
### 
Closing the season, Stanford's
baseball team will play the soldiers
from Camp Beal on the Sunken Dia
: mond tomorrow at 2:30. This is the
last game of the season for the Reds
and also the last game of the college
career for most of the players, since
( they will be leaving for the armed
forces.
Coach Harry Wolter will probably
start his ace hurler, Jack Miller,
saving the still injured Doc Mason
for fireman duty if the need arises.
Behind Miller, the infield will line
up the same as it has in the last
I three games, Dallmar, Brownson,
Brown ,and McKie.
In the outer gardens it should be
Bill Cunha, Keith Pinion, and Lloyd
Merriman.
There is a large possibility that
all those on the squad may see ac
tion since this is the last game. If
that should happen it would give the
tans to see one of the only lelt
handed hurlers in the league this
year.
Bob Brown is still leading the
team in hitting, closely followed by
Lloyd Merriman and Howie Dall
mar. Jay McKie is coming out of his
slump and starting to hit long balls
which may connect for home runs
at any time.
All are urged to turn out and
witness the last appearance of the
Indian nine.
