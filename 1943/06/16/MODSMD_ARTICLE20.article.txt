# Four Army Units Start Stanford Classes
## 
### 
After a false start last December
when the Navy issued a letter of
intent to establish a naval cadet
school, the Army began to come to
Stanford.
First, letters of intent were issued
by the Army to establish units in
advanced engineering, personnel
psychology, and European area
studies at Stanford.
At the beginning of Spring
Quarter, Branner Hall was evacu
ated ami was kept by the University
for the three units.
Next, a letter of intent was is
sued to establish a STAR (Special
ized Training Assignment and Re
classitic ation) unit at Stanford.
The STAR unit began to arrive
about the middle of April. It was
decided to put these soldiers in Se
quoia Hall. The entire hall was
subsequently given to the STAR
unit.
But even this soon proved inade
quate. In rapid succession, members
of the STAR unit were put in the
basement of Encina Hall and fn the
Branner dining hall.
Finally, on May 17, classes were
begun for the members of the three
training units. These were put. as
was originally planned, in Branner
Hall.
To take care of the STAR unit
which had begun to overflow into
Branner. Toyon Hall was evacuated,
and the members of the STAR unit
began to move in there.

their interviews and tests are giving these refresher courses.

MARCHING ON THEIR WAV to class in the Quad building is tliis de
tachment of soldiers. They arc members of the Personnel Psychology
Training unit. There are a total of 100 in this unit. They arc taking the
equivalent of a 20-unit course in psychology, in addition to which, they
also take military training and physical education training. Each of the
members of this unit have had at least two courses in psychology in some
college or university. In addition thy have been qualified for this course
by some STAR unit. The academic director of the Personnel Psychology

Training unit is Dr. Paul Farnsworth, professor of psychology. As sol
diers, however, the Training unit is also under the command of Col.
Harry B. Allen, commandant of all Army units at Stanford. There are
two other Training units al Stanford. These are studying Advanced En
ginering and European area studies. Dr. Samuel Morris, Dean of the
School of Engineering, is the academic director of the Engineering unit,
and Dr. Edwin A. Cottrell, professor of political science, is the director
of the area studies unit. The engineering unit contains 200 soldiers, the
area studies unit 100 soldiers.

These STARS are taking tests and interviews, from
the results of which they are classified and are sent to
some Training unit which is opening shortly after, or
arc recommended for a refresher course in some branch
of their work. All of this is done under the direction

of an academic committee chairmaned by Dr. J. I*.
Mitchell, registrar. The examinations are given l)\ the
appropriate department. The problem is to find out
how much each soldier lias learned so that he may be
fitted in the Training class to which his knowledge
qualifies him. This is a problem because there is no
standardized course of study in the many colleges and
universities in the United Stales.

area studies unit 100 soldiers.


ADOPTING AN (1LD Stanford custom, these members
of (he STAR unit are lounging on the steps of the Libe
talking to a Stanford woman, in tliis case Kvc ISruckncr.
These STARS are taking tests and interviews, from
the results of which they are classified and are sent to
some Training unit which is opening shortly after, or
arc recommended for a refresher course in some branch
of their work. All of this is done under the direction

of an academic committee chairmaned by Dr. J. I*.
Mitchell, registrar. The examinations are given l)\ the
appropriate department. The problem is to find out
how much each soldier lias learned so that he may be
fitted in the Training class to which his knowledge
qualifies him. This is a problem because there is no
standardized course of study in the many colleges and
universities in the United Stales.
