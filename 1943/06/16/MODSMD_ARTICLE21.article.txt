## Army News SUMMER Entertainment Schedule Made 
### 
Plans are already being made for
entertaining the Army units on cam
pus during Summer Quarter, accord
ing to Betty May Hale, War Board
coordinator, and Dodie Crile social
coordinator of the War Board.
"The basic problem for Summer
Quarter wil lbe," Miss Crile said,
"that there will be more soldiers on
campus during Summer Quarter
than there will be girls. Admittedly,
the Training unit will not want to
go in for extensive social activities,
but then the girls have to study also.
And there will be the STAR unit."
Open Houses Continue
Plans are being made, however,
she said, to continue the program of
open houses on Sunday afternoons
as was don ethis quarter.
In addition, several living groups
will probably try an open house on
Sunday night until 8 p.m.
The Nitery dances will also be i
continued. Cardinals will remain as
the sponsor for all of the dances, but j
each women's living group will be i
asked to be hotsess for some one j
night.
During Week
The Nitery will also remain open
during the week as it is now. There j
will be dancing, but there will be no
hostesses present. The Nitery has
appropriated $2 per week to buy i
magazines for the Nitery.
And then, as they were this quar
ter, all ol the soldiers on campus will
be invited to all campus functions.
Arrangements will be mdae through
the social chairmen to get dates for
those soldiers desiring them.
Campus functions include all of
the dances which are open to all ;
students who are on the campus, !
plus such events as the regular Tues- !
day Series, the Concert Series, the |
weekly Sunday Movie Series, the
Student-Faculty Forum, the Hu- I
inanities panels, and the Dramatics J
Department productions. Some of
these are free, some have an admis
sion price.
The social chairman system, Miss
Crile said, will be continued. It has
worked very well this quarter, and
there is no reason why it should not }
be continued. Of course, during the j
Summer Quarter, new social chair- i
men will have to be appointed, such !
since all of the women will be living j
in Lagunita and Roble only instead i
of in the smaller houses.

Summer Quarter, new social chair- i
men will have to be appointed, such !
since all of the women will be living j
in Lagunita and Roble only instead i
of in the smaller houses.
Plans are already being made for
entertaining the Army units on cam
pus during Summer Quarter, accord
ing to Betty May Hale, War Board
coordinator, and Dodie Crile social
coordinator of the War Board.
"The basic problem for Summer
Quarter wil lbe," Miss Crile said,
"that there will be more soldiers on
campus during Summer Quarter
than there will be girls. Admittedly,
the Training unit will not want to
go in for extensive social activities,
but then the girls have to study also.
And there will be the STAR unit."
Open Houses Continue
Plans are being made, however,
she said, to continue the program of
open houses on Sunday afternoons
as was don ethis quarter.
In addition, several living groups
will probably try an open house on
Sunday night until 8 p.m.
The Nitery dances will also be i
continued. Cardinals will remain as
the sponsor for all of the dances, but j
each women's living group will be i
asked to be hotsess for some one j
night.
During Week
The Nitery will also remain open
during the week as it is now. There j
will be dancing, but there will be no
hostesses present. The Nitery has
appropriated $2 per week to buy i
magazines for the Nitery.
And then, as they were this quar
ter, all ol the soldiers on campus will
be invited to all campus functions.
Arrangements will be mdae through
the social chairmen to get dates for
those soldiers desiring them.
Campus functions include all of
the dances which are open to all ;
students who are on the campus, !
plus such events as the regular Tues- !
day Series, the Concert Series, the |
weekly Sunday Movie Series, the
Student-Faculty Forum, the Hu- I
inanities panels, and the Dramatics J
Department productions. Some of
these are free, some have an admis
sion price.
The social chairman system, Miss
Crile said, will be continued. It has
worked very well this quarter, and
there is no reason why it should not }
be continued. Of course, during the j
Summer Quarter, new social chair- i
men will have to be appointed, such !
since all of the women will be living j
in Lagunita and Roble only instead i
of in the smaller houses.
