# Training Unit Men Describe Their Days in STAR Units
## 
### 
"My STAR unit was paradise. You
i should have seen all of the women."
I "Mine was the friendliest school I
J have ever attended."
Thus the members of the Training
j units at Stanford who had been at
j STAR units at other colleges ex
| pressed their opinion of these col
l leges.
"At my unit," one of them said,
"there were 700 women and 30 men
when we arrived. The second day
| after that, they gave a "mixer" for
! us, and from that time on every sol
j dier knew at least six girls. It was
I wonderful."
,
Civilian Smokers
"To start the mixer, they lined us
up, and then marched us up and we
! started dancing with the girls we
] came out opposite. It worked all
; right for some of them, and if you
didn't like the girls you could shift
j around.
"There wasn't any bad feeling be
: tween the civilian men and the sol
i diers. They came to the same dances
i we did, and we had several smokers."
j Male University
According to another soldier, "The
STAR unit I was at didn't have much
i social activity because it was a
| strictly masculine university,
i "They had a regular R.O.T.C. unit
! there, a unit of sailors, another of
i Marines, the STARS, some of the
j regular Army, and some of their ci
vilian students.
"Better Organized"
'Perhaps because they had had so
much experience in handling large
groups of men, things were much
better organized there. The dormi
tories and eating halls were
1 equipped to take care of us.
"There weren't any refresher
courses being given, but the drill
was well under control, too well.

'"Even though there weren't any
women there, some dances were
given at the Country Club nearby.
We had to walk about three miles to
get there, but it was worth it.
"They had more spirit tiiere of any
school I have ever attended. The
whole school used to come out for
the baseball games, and they really
yelled.
"Then the civilian students used
to come up to us on the campus and
introduce themselves. Later on we
found out that all freshmen were
told to do this, but anyway it sure
made us feel good.
