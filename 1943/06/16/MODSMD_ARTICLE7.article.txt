One day last March Ann Ashley,
five-foot-three and weighing 108
pounds, went down to the Palo Alto
Yacht Harbor with some friends to
watch the Stanford crew go through
a workout. While there, she saw
Coach Carl Pedersen, a friend of
hers, and before anyone knew what
had happened, Ann Ashley had
been engaged as coxswain for the
Frosh shell after a few successful
tryuots.
She soon became the Jayvee cox,
and life for her became a round of

practice runs on the bay for two
hours before her 8 o'clock. And it
paid: although the Jayvee bowed to
Cal, the oarsmen did beat U.C.L.A.,
with Ann Ashley's "Stroke" push
ing them.
