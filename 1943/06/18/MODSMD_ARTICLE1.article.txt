# Men Still Lead Registration
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
The famed ratio of "one point ni
yun" is now 1.09. . . men to women,
on the Stanford campus where the
men used to come to the ''Harvard
of the West" and lord it over the tra
ditional meek "500." Stanford wom
en, holding the top student govern
ment posts are coming into their
own, while the Stanford men who
left last quarter with the ERC and
the R.0.T.C., and those who-are now
in the Navy, are raising the ratio of
other Universities all over the coun
try.
If the soldiers on campus are in
cluded, the ratio is 3.59 men to

First-Day Registration Figures
Men Students 704
Women Students (i45
Total— 1,349

women, one of the highest ratios re
corded.
Total Drop
Contrary to expectations, men led
the women in the first day of en
rollment for summer quarter. 704
men and 645 women totaled 1,349
registrants, a drop of 380 from last

year's record-setting first day of
registration. The total number of
men included 173 medical students
enrolled in San Francisco; the wom
en included nine med registrants.
A record registration is expected
by Monday, since a conflict of high
school and junior college gradua
tions with the first day of registra
tion at Stanford will lead to a stag
gered registration over the weekend.
And the Army
With 1,000 STAR students and 400
ASTP men, the ratio of men to wom
en, approximately 2,100 to 645, is
misleading. However, if social acti
vities of students and Army are ar
ranged as they were last quarter, the
soldiers on campus will be treated as
though they were regular students.
Thus for practical purposes raising
the ratio.
On June 18 of last year, the first
day of the quarter, 1,143 men en
rolled, 439 more than returned this
year. However, 586 women came in
last year, which was surpassed by
this year's 645. This year's registra
tion ratio is more comparable to the
registration in 1941 when 503 men
and 371 women made checks pay
able.

Total Drop
Contrary to expectations, men led
the women in the first day of en
rollment for summer quarter. 704
men and 645 women totaled 1,349
registrants, a drop of 380 from last

year's record-setting first day of
registration. The total number of
men included 173 medical students
enrolled in San Francisco; the wom
en included nine med registrants.
A record registration is expected
by Monday, since a conflict of high
school and junior college gradua
tions with the first day of registra
tion at Stanford will lead to a stag
gered registration over the weekend.
And the Army
With 1,000 STAR students and 400
ASTP men, the ratio of men to wom
en, approximately 2,100 to 645, is
misleading. However, if social acti
vities of students and Army are ar
ranged as they were last quarter, the
soldiers on campus will be treated as
though they were regular students.
Thus for practical purposes raising
the ratio.
On June 18 of last year, the first
day of the quarter, 1,143 men en
rolled, 439 more than returned this
year. However, 586 women came in
last year, which was surpassed by
this year's 645. This year's registra
tion ratio is more comparable to the
registration in 1941 when 503 men
and 371 women made checks pay
able.

The famed ratio of "one point ni

on the Stanford campus where the
men used to come to the ''Harvard
of the West" and lord it over the tra
ditional meek "500." Stanford wom

left last quarter with the ERC and
the R.0.T.C., and those who-are now
in the Navy, are raising the ratio of
other Universities all over the coun
