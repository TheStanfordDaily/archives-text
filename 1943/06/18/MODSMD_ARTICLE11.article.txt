# Day Camp Counsellors to Sign
## 
### 
Another type of war work is being
offered campus women who are in
terested in signing up for specific
hours this summer as counsellors of
the Day Camp which will be spon
sored by the Palo Alto Girl Scout
Council and City Recreation Depart
ment. The Camp will be situated on
San Francisquito Creek, near Sears
ville Road on Campus.
Beginning on June 22 about 50
Palo Alto and Campus girls in or
above the third grade will attend the
camp from 9:30 to 4:30 on Tuesday,
Thursday, and Friday. The project is
being sponsored to relieve the strain
on parents in war work who cannot
find chaperones for their grammar
school children during the summer

i vacation months. Depending on its
success, the camp will continue for
two or three months.
Miss Eda Jean Boulton, graduate
I student at Northwestern, who has
had many years of scouting, will be
head counsellor of the camp. Campus
women who volunteer to assist her
j need have no previous camping ex
perience. The Camp schedule will
emphasize real outdoor life with out
door cooking, camp craft, and some
overnight camping. Girls who at
tend the camp do not necessarily
have to be Girl Scout members.
Stanford women who are inter
j for their war work this summer
should call Mrs. Paul Kirkpatrick.
Chairman of the Camp Committee
