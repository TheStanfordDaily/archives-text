# LATE TIPS
## 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Gentlemen, and those lew women
who are interested, meet the sports
staff . . . Late Williams and Don
Langendorf.
Perhaps some new names will be
added to this extensive list as the
quarter progresses, but for now,
that's all brother.
The days of guys fighting to get
their copy into print are all washed
up. Today it is merely a question of
dragging the nearest character that
comes into the Shack to a typewriter
and, with the aid of a Chinese boot,
make him give out with some news.
Don Langendorf, although having
no previous newspaper experience,
will act as our baseball expert. In
that department, the man is sensa
tional. We usually have to drag him
down from the Seals Stadium, where
he rooms in the "sassy ones'" dugout,
to get a story out of him, but once
we nail him, he's good for a half
page of sports news.
As for the text and size of the
page, let's just say that we will be
given enough room in each edition
to adequately cover the sports news
on hand.
This means, considering the pres
ent sports boom at Stanford, that
we're practically washed up before
we begin.
OF FOOTBALL
AND STANFORD
For the past week in San Fran
cisco, members of coast conference
athletic boards have been hashing
over the subject of football. Just
how well they've ironed out the con
fusing situation remains to be seen.
Although a tentative schedule has
been agreed upon, and one in which
the Indians vyill have only one Big
Game instead oi the previously sug
gested two, just how the teams are
going to get transportation to and
from the games remains a moot
point.
Also, there is the possibility that
Stanford will not play football next
fall. The reason beingâ€”no men.
If the Army reverses their de
cision, and allows their men to com
pete as the Navy does now, the "T"
will undoubtedly be rolling in Sep
tember.
Al Masters, director of athletics,
says that as far as he is concerned,
all preparations for the coming sea
son will have to be forgotten until
the Army makes their position on the
subject definite.
OF CAL AND
THE TROJANS
Whereas Stanford's position with
the Army is on the "yes" or "no"
basis, there are at least two univer
sities in the southern division of the
conference that are looking forward
to the coming season with a defi
nitely "bring 'em on and we'll mur
der 'em" attitude. Namely. Cali
fornia and U.S.C.
At Cal they have a combination of
Navy, Marines, and Army. Lots of
material to choose from, but with the
Army men, at present, destined to
stand on the sidelines and watch.
U.S.C. will be using the "T" forma
tion according to advance informa
tion. and with the school loaded with
present and former football stars,
watch out, Sam.
With the Navy in command, plus
a couple of boys named McCardle
and Fellows, it looks like a banner
pigskin year for the Trojans.
