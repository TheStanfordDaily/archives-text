# Unusual Business As Usual
## 
### 
EXCEPT for the heat, registration yesterday was much like other
days we remember. A good number of old students re
turned for the summer, and the long lines of pre-reged members
of the class of 1947 looked much the same as any other incoming
freshman class. There was the same scrambling and waiting in
the Ad Building. There was the same business-like but friendly
spirit. Checks for $143 were still made payable. On the surface,
registration day business progressed as usual.
For the many new Stanfordites, this reg day will be the one
remembered. And this summer quarter will leave the deepest
impression. To them, all this will be Stanford—all it has been
and may be.
Yet, to we seasoned registrants, the mere reg day atmosphere
of this quarter proves to us that this business as usual is most un
usual for Stanford—-as we remember it.
Students this summer know they aren't registering for a play
quarter. Full unit programs in Quad classrooms will replace sun
ning on beaches. And young women and men working hard on a
regular, full-time activity program will know this isn't the casual,
easy-going summer quarter that used to be.
Despite the belying atmosphere in the Ad Building yester
day, old students know how different this summer quarter will
be. Just as last spring quarter produced a great change in campus
tile, so this quarter will produce a greater one. Though we say
the new class of 1947, that class will be just as indeterminant as
ihe rest are now. College in three years and early graduations
have split class distinctions. And, obviously, men in unjffinß-k€rve~
for the most part replaced the traditional "Stanford Rough."
Yes, the only thing usual about this business is the fact that
college life and University institutions will go on despite the
unusual changes.
The Daily will continue to be published as a student enter
prise. A skeleton staff composed mainly of women, will publish
cur Tabby on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Due
to printing arrangements, The Daily will be circulated an hour or
two later in the morning, however.
It has long been the tradition for the new editor to outline
policy in the first editorial. Feeling that this is no time for stirring
campaigns and radical changes, the staff will continue the prece
dent of Volume 103. We will sincerely strive to present the news
honestly. We will try to give the campus the paper it wants. As
A 1 Hampson said, we will not try to be armchair generals. In
covering world news, we will not reach above our scope as col
lege students.
We feel the most The Daily can do this quarter and next is
carry on in the best possible manner. In his last editorial, A 1
closed, "As the 22 years of male editors would say, To you from
failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high'." So
we will try to bear the torch and keep it high and bright. We will
carry it until the men return to take over the Shack and the
editor's office and the swivel chair which is rightfully theirs.

failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high'." So
we will try to bear the torch and keep it high and bright. We will
carry it until the men return to take over the Shack and the
editor's office and the swivel chair which is rightfully theirs.
EXCEPT for the heat, registration yesterday was much like other
days we remember. A good number of old students re
turned for the summer, and the long lines of pre-reged members
of the class of 1947 looked much the same as any other incoming
freshman class. There was the same scrambling and waiting in
the Ad Building. There was the same business-like but friendly
spirit. Checks for $143 were still made payable. On the surface,
registration day business progressed as usual.
For the many new Stanfordites, this reg day will be the one
remembered. And this summer quarter will leave the deepest
impression. To them, all this will be Stanford—all it has been
and may be.
Yet, to we seasoned registrants, the mere reg day atmosphere
of this quarter proves to us that this business as usual is most un
usual for Stanford—-as we remember it.
Students this summer know they aren't registering for a play
quarter. Full unit programs in Quad classrooms will replace sun
ning on beaches. And young women and men working hard on a
regular, full-time activity program will know this isn't the casual,
easy-going summer quarter that used to be.
Despite the belying atmosphere in the Ad Building yester
day, old students know how different this summer quarter will
be. Just as last spring quarter produced a great change in campus
tile, so this quarter will produce a greater one. Though we say
the new class of 1947, that class will be just as indeterminant as
ihe rest are now. College in three years and early graduations
have split class distinctions. And, obviously, men in unjffinß-k€rve~
for the most part replaced the traditional "Stanford Rough."
Yes, the only thing usual about this business is the fact that
college life and University institutions will go on despite the
unusual changes.
The Daily will continue to be published as a student enter
prise. A skeleton staff composed mainly of women, will publish
cur Tabby on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday. Due
to printing arrangements, The Daily will be circulated an hour or
two later in the morning, however.
It has long been the tradition for the new editor to outline
policy in the first editorial. Feeling that this is no time for stirring
campaigns and radical changes, the staff will continue the prece
dent of Volume 103. We will sincerely strive to present the news
honestly. We will try to give the campus the paper it wants. As
A 1 Hampson said, we will not try to be armchair generals. In
covering world news, we will not reach above our scope as col
lege students.
We feel the most The Daily can do this quarter and next is
carry on in the best possible manner. In his last editorial, A 1
closed, "As the 22 years of male editors would say, To you from
failing hands we throw the torch; be yours to hold it high'." So
we will try to bear the torch and keep it high and bright. We will
carry it until the men return to take over the Shack and the
editor's office and the swivel chair which is rightfully theirs.
