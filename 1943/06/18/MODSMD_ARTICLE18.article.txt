To The Editor:
The members of the Board of Directors of The Stanford
Convalescent Home cannot individually thank "the Student Body
other than through the columns of The Stanford Daily for the
generous response made by the students to our annual appeal
for help.
We shall appreciate it if you will be good enough to permit
us, through you, to thank those members of the Student Body
who so generously and cheerfully gave their day to the work
that was done on the grounds at the Home. The grounds had,
because of the necessity of using funds for the actual care of the
children, not been adeguately provided for and the entire outside
appearance of the Home is now in such a condition that we may
be proud of it.
We wish to thank, too, those generous students who gave
of their time so willingly to interest others in giving money con
tributions which have helped us out materially. Each year it
means that our needs at the Home are being brought more and
more to the attention of those who otherwise would forget that
we are bringing new life and health to the underprivileged chil
dren for whom we are giving a new start in life.
IRA S. LILLICK, President Board of Directors.
