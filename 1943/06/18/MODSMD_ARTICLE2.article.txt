# RESIDENCES
## Men Occupy Fraternities 
### 
New Lower Division men will be
housed in ex-fraternity houses this
summer as the Army will occupy
Encina, traditional hall of frosh men,
according to John Bunn, dean of
men.
Each house was renamed after a
president of the United States. (For
complete list of renamed houses see
box to the right.) Four of these will
be occupied by freshmen, and the
remainder will be opened for re
turning students.
Major Subjects
New students will be assigned to
houses according to their major sub
jects. Lower Division engineers will
occupy Lincoln Hall; social science
majors, Buchanan Hall; science stu
dents, Tyler Hall; and pre-med stu
dents will be housed in Arthur Hall.
Graduate students will be housed
in Madison Hall; first year med stu
dents in Fillmore Hall; and Upper
Division engineer majors will be in
McKinley Hall instead of Harrison
Hall as previously announced.
Resident Assistants
Several halls will be unclassified so
that returning students may have
their choice of living groups. They
are: Monroe, Hayes, and Cleveland
Halls.
A student resident assistant will
be in charge of each hall,
