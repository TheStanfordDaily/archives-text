### United Press 
WASHINGTON. —American fighter
pilots ripped apart a great Japanese
air armada over Guadalcanal yester
day (Solomon Island time) and shot
down 77 enemy bombers and Zeros
at a cost of only six U.S. planes in
the greatest Yank aerial triumph in
the Southwest Pacific, the Navy an
nounced today.
A brief communique reported that
the Jap losses included 32 bombers
and 45 Zero fighters—an unofficial
record number of enemy planes shot
down in a single engagement by
planes alone. The previous high was
74 Axis planes destroyed by Allied
fliers last April 18 during the battle
of Tunisia.
After announcing the American
triumph, the Navy added cryptically:
"No further details have been re
ceived."
Neither did the Navy reveal the
number of planes in the Jap armada
nor the number of U.S. fighters which
rose to meet the challenge. The
brilliant victory, however, may have
thwarted an attempt to knock out
Henderson Field on Guadalcanal.
American fliers have now shot
down 1,115 Jap planes in the Solo
mons since last August. By contrast,
the U.S. airmen have suffered only
about one-fifth thut number loos»es.
