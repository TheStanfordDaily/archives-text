# WAR WORK
## Women Plan Busy Program 
### 
Plans for a busy summer are being
formulated by Betty May Hale, co
ordinator of the Stanford War Board,
and Meriam Margetts, Y.W.C.A. crop
crew chairman, who are cooperating
in organizing war work among wom
en students.
Miss Hale has announced that the
Red Cross is desperately in need of
women to fold surgical dressings.
During vacation so many of the
regular workers were not here the
quota for the month is far from
filled.
Red Cross
During the summer the Red Cross
room will be open from 10 to 12
a.m., and 1 to 4 p.m. on week days.
However, if enough women volun
teer, it will open from 4 to 5 on week
days and perhaps from 7:30 to 9:30
p.m. on Wednesday nights. This will
be to accommodate those women who
have classes all day. Miss Hale has
asked all those women who want the
room to remain open those hours to
state it on their sign-up sheets.
The sign-up sheets will be circu
lated in Roble Monday. Miss Hale
will speak to freshmen women at
that time, explaining our war work
program to them. The sign-up sheets
will be circulated at Lagunita on
June 28.
New Cards
A new form has been printed so
that each quarter the women will
just add the work they intend to do
beneath that of the preceding quar
ter.
Again each woman will be asked
to do eight hours of work a week.
Those who have worked 100 hours
can be instructors.
Although crop crews will not be
gin actual picking until mid-July,
Miss Margetts has announced that
Sam McDonald, in charge of garden
ing at the Con Home, was so pleased
with work on Con Home Day he has
asked for 30 volunteers for Saturday,
June 26. The women will work from
9 a.m. to noon. Transportation will
be furnished. There will be sign-up
sheets in the halls Monday.
USO Course
A course in planning parties for
men in service will be offered this
summer. It will consist of five hours
of instruction and will begin as soon
as the women are settled in their
residences.
Requests have been made for
women to work at the Girl Scout
Camp on San Francisco Creek. Vol
unteers should call Miss Pat David
son, 9810.
Any women who wish to volun
teer for War Board work should call
at Room 14 in Old Union or 9411â€”
local 313.
