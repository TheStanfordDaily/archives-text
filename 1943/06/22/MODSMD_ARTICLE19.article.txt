# LATE TIPS
## 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
All right men, bring out your base
ball gloves, Louisville sluggers, and
oil up your throwing arm, because
intramural softball is going to get
underway once more.
Harry Wolter, dean of intramural
activities, announces that the games
would probably be twilight affairs,
with the diffrent organizations and
Frats—oops, we msan Halls, com
peting.
When we phoned Wolter about the
sports plans for the summer, he
quickly came up with a classic moni
ker for the program —the Presidents
League. He said it too fast for him
to have picked the name from thin
air. You can go to bed now, Mr.
Wolter, and catch up on your sleep.
As usual, men umpires will be
needed to officiate the games, so all
men that are interested and have the
correct qualifications — a natural
sarcastic disposition and either a
Brooklyn or Jersey accent—please
get in touch with Wolter immedi
ately.
There will be a sign-up in
the past—located on the bulletin
board in the gym, where all houses
can enter a team. Added advice is
given that each organization appoint
one man to handle this delicate job,
so that there will be no confusion
when it comes to making the round
robin schedule.
In the last column when we were
hashing over the football situation,
we took it for granted that every
body had seen the Indians' tentative
schedule. However, hundreds of
phone calls swamped the Daily office
demanding to know exactly what the
sked is, so, we cheerfully reverse our
decision and instead of taking it for
granted that you know, we make
sure by putting it in type.
Sept. 25—U.5.F.; Oct. 2—U.C.L.A.
at Los Angeles; Oct. 9—Del Monte
Pre-Flight; Oct. 16—U.S.C. at Stan
ford; Oct. 23—Santa Clara at Kezar;
Oct. 30—U.C.L.A. at Stanford; Nov.
G—St. Mary's Pre-Flight; Nov. 13—
U.S.C. at Stanford; and Nov. 20—
STANFORD VS. CALIFORNIA.
That's the way it stands, and it
looks pretty good, but neverthelss,
every time that we talk to A 1 Mas
ters about the football question, he
just looks at us with a slight grin on
his face, and says, "Well, if the Army
doesn't change their decision about
playing, do you think we'll field a
team?"
Then, our answer is — with the
same kind of a grin on our face—
"Well, il the Army doesn't change
their decision, are we going to play
the Big Game with Paly High in the
stadium or on their field?
