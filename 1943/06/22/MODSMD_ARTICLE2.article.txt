# Wilbur Sees Model School
## 
### 
Sixty years ago Dr. Ray Lyman
Wilbur spent his days pouring over
his books and having snowball fights j
at Garfield School, Boone, lowa, j
Yesterday when he walked into the !
i
lobby of the Education Building, j
those days in lowa were brought |
back to him by a model of the old j
schoolhouse, which took Miss Gene- ;
vra Boggs of Mountain View, his j
classmate at Garfield, seven years of I
delicate work to reconstruct.
When asked if he remembered his
old school, Dr. Wilbur cocked his j
head, and with a serious face but a !
twinkle in his eye, said, "I was so
devoted to my books at that age
I—," and stopped when Miss Boggs ;
began to chuckle.
Miss Boggs has also made a cov- j
ered wagon train, a relica of those
which used to go by the school. When
asked if he remembered these, Dr. j
Wilbur's reply was, "I don't remem- j
ber the covered wagons, but I do re
member tiie drunks that used to go
by.
'"I can't remember where I sat,
but I remember the girl who sat in
front of me. She jumped equally as
high—no matter which pigtail was
pulled," he finished.
