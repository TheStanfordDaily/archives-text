# Needy in Europe To Be Fed To Preclude Hunger—Bennett
## 
### 
Dr. Merrill Kelley Bennett, ex
ecutive director of the Stanford
Food Research Institute was the
i author of an article, "Food for Eu
rope—Seven Questions," which ap
peared in the May issue of Free
World.
"Barring one major misfortune,"
i says Dr. Bennett, "the needy of Eu
! rope can probably be fed when they
| become accessible—perhaps not at a
I level of adequate nutrition, but at a
level to preclude hunger."
The event to be most feared, he
says, is weather unfavorable for
[ grain production either in Conti
nental Europe or in North America.
According to Dr. Bennett, the
tendency, in forecasting food need
| of Europe may be unduly high. This

is because most of the population of
Continental Europe is rural and can
raise much of its own food. He also
says that "food needs of Europe
ought to be appraised not by com
parison of current consumption with
our own level, but with the accus
tomed levels of Europe which were
very much lower than ours so far
as concerns composition of diet."
In the United States, says Dr.
Bennett, the impression is far too
common that we as a nation are fur
not the case, for other important food
received either through purchase,
on lend-lease, or on gift. That is
not the cas, for other important food
exporters are Argentina, Canada,
New Zealand, Brazil, South Africa,
India, and French West Africa.
