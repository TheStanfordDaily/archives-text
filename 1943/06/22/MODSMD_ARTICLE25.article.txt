MORE than any other country at war, the Russian people
have suffered untold hardships and cruelties. The Nazi
war on Russian civilians has so far destroyed about 10,000,000,
and over 3,000,000 more have been taken into slavery. Those
who have been killed probably suffered such torture and anguish
ihey were glad to die. And children in occupied Russia know
life as only hard and bitter and cruel. To the civilian population,
war has been real and horrible.
Today has been named "Tribute to Russia Day." It is the
climax of a month-long observance honoring the Russian people
ior their courage and their role in the war. And it falls on the
.second anniversary of Russia's invasion by Germany.
Throughout the month, the Russian War Relief has asked
Americans to write letters of friendship to the Russian people. It
has collected clothing for war orphans, prepared special kits for
soldiers, and collected watches for Red Army doctors and nurses.
All these will be presented today as anniversary gifts.
In this way, we, to whom war has meant compulsory military
service and ration stamps, pay tribute to our new friends and al
lies, the fighting people of Russia.
