### BILL STRUTHERS 
A group of senior students—obviously seniors because they
v/eren't smoking their own cigarettes —were stymied by the re
naming of the fraternities. Three years of college had made them
confident, perhaps overconfident, at least certain, that there had
been a mistake made. Who had ever heard of men named Hayes,
or Arthur, or Harrison being President of the United States?
Sounds like something out of the Dean's office rather than straight
stuff from a history book, they confided to each other. Besides,
for all these seniors knew, Hayes, Arthur, and Harrison might
have been the Democratic Party's Presidential candidates. Or
they might just have been Democrats. Or even union officials.
Now being students of unlimited experience they approached
the problem carefully. Here was a research problem that must
be handled delicately. They couldn't even accept the help of an
ex-reader of poli. sci. 1. He might be a company man, and after
all, if the company or the University wanted to warp the minds
of the new freshmen by distorting a list of the Presidents of the
United States, there wasn't a lot that could be done. Anyway,
they knew that they must become an underground movement.
So they made a sound like a torpedo when they met on the Quad
and silently winced when someone spoke of "Arthur Hall."
The Secret Order Against Renaming Fraternities, as they
called themselves, decided that they needed a source of infor
mation much more reliable than was available here on the cam
pus. So they wrote a personal and confidential letter to the Direc
tor of the Library of Congress, Washington, D.C., explaining the
situation. That is, they started to write the letter. You see there are
the typewriter broke down. The three of them had to go hash.
They met again and started a rough draft by pencil. Then they
quarreled—rather violently quarreled about the case of the pro
noun when used as the subject to the verb "to be." Perhaps you
heard them shouting. "Him wasn't . . "He wasn't . .
The letter never reached the Library of Congress, but the
S.O.A.R.F. became a success. They ended up playing fah tan
for a cent a point, and decided to meet for the same purpose on
the first and third blackouts of every month.
So far I'm four-bits winners.
