### 
Speaking of international action in education, Grayson N. Kefauver,
Dean of the School of Education, will discuss ''Postwar International Co
operation in Education" in the Tuesday Evening Series tonight at 8 p.m.
in Memorial Hall.
Participating in this panel discussion will be Philip W. Buck, professor

of political science; I. James Kuillen,
| associate professor of education;
i Ralph H. Lutz, professor of history;
and Bayard Q. Morgan, professor of
; German.
Proposals
In outlining his pi - oposals for in
ternational cooperation in education
in the May issue of New Europe, Mr.
Kefauver says:
"We can establish political ma
chinery to promote peace in the
world and to realize the other im
! portant social goals. But this is not
enough. Social machinery will be
ineffective and in time will collapse
if it is not supported by widespread
social understanding among the peo
ples of the participating nations.
"Existing governments cannot ig
nore the dominant public opinion of
their citizens. If they assume re
sponsibilities not supported by the
people, they are likely to be sup
planted by governments more in
harmony with the public will.
"First thought must consequently
be given to the social intelligence of
the people as we approach postwar
reconstruction and the peace."
Peace Threats
Mr. Kefauver states further that
the peace of the world will be threat
ened just as long as any people is
taught a superior-race megalomania,
worship of power, and hatred of
other racial, religious, and national
groups.
"In this war, we have seen how
victorious psychological warfare can
be. We have here a new instrument
in total warfare which must be
eradicated if we are to have total
peace."
Dean Kefauver has just returned
from Washington where he has been
working for the last three months on
the problem of postwar international
cooperation in education. He ini
tiatd the establishment of a liaison
committee for international educa
tion to which he has been elected
chairman.
The Series, sponsored by the Com
mittee of Public Exerciss of the Uni
versity, Ls open to the public and is
given every Tuesday throughout the
quarter.
