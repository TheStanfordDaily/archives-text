The War Board office will be open
from 1 to 5 Monday through Friday
for the first two weeks of school,
according to Betty Mae Hale, War
Board Coordinator. After that time,
the office will be open from 1 to 5
on Monday, Tuesday, and Thursday,
and from 3 to 5 on Wednesday and

"If any girl would like to work as
a receptionist in the office, she can
get in touch with me in Room 14 in
the Old Union or call 9411, local

The Red Cross workroom is open
to all women students for bandage
rolling on Monday through Friday
from 10 to 12 and from 1 to 4. Com
petition for hours of work done will
be between corridors in Roble, and
between Casas in Lagunita.
'If all campus women would wear
a clean wash dress and a bandana,
it would be appreciated," said Mrs.
LaPiere of the workroom. "If that
isn't possible we can supply work
gowns and bandanas."
The first of the Stanford crop
crews will probably begin to pick
apricots about the second week of
July, according to Miriam Margetts,
crop chairman. As yet crews have
not been organized, and so all plans
are tentative.
However, 30 Stanford women will
have a chance to work outdoors at
the Con Home Saturday by signing
up on the Lagunita and Roble bulle
tin boards today. The Con Home
truck will pick up the volunteers at
8:45 in front of Roble, and they will
work in the Con Home gardens un
der Sam Mac Donald until noon.
Any two women who want a regu
lar job selling Con Home vegetables
every Saturday are asked to contact
