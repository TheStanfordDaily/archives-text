## Men Still Lead With 1.09 Ratio 
### 
The well known Stanford men to
J women students ratio remained the
same as that of last quarter's regis
trationâ€”l.o9. The new freshmen
helped the already low ratio from
receding any farther.
j The Stanford women are coming
|to the foreground now and are
! maintaining the leading offices in
the University. Stanford can not
very well be called the "Harvard of
the West" with the famed 500 wom
en any longer.
I Including the soldiers on campus
| the ratio is 3.59 men to women, one
| of the highest ratios recorded.
Although it was the general opin
! ion that women would lead the men
lin this summer's registration, the
j men slill lead with 831 to 762 women
J totaling 1,593 students. This number
i includes the men and women medi
| cal students enrolled in San Fran
| cisco.
The registration of this quarter, as
compared to last summer's enroll
| ment, has dropped 342 students from
the total of 1,290 men and 645 wom
en registered last year.
