# Outbreaks Threaten Further Race Riots

DETROIT. June 22â€”Scattered out
breaks of violence tonight threatened
to rekindle the bloody rioting that
left 25 Negroes and three whites dead
before federal troops restored order
in Detroit last night at the request
of President Roosevelt. A constant
series of calls were received by po
lice tonight reporting minor scuffles
and the gathering crowds of whites,
while in the colored district four
squad cars and a patrol wagon were
called before an unidentified Negro
sniper was subdued and taken to
jail.
Most of the violence tonight was
of a minor nature. Federal troops
continued to patrol the city, with
fixed bayonets, usually riding in
squads of eight or 10 in trucks.
Governor Harry F. Kelly extended
his state of emergency proclamation
for at least another day, and 99-day
jail sentences were imposed on 34
Negro rioters earlier.
In the meantime, white and Negro
leaders joined in an attempt to fer
ret out ringleaders of the nation's
worst race riot since 1917. Both at
tributed the outburst to fifth column
activities and a group of whites spe
cifically named the Ku Klux Klan.
