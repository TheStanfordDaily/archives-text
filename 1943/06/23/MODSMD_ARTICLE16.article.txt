### Ewell Sale 
LONDON—(Release from Ameri
can Red Cross) —Grooming the tho
roughbreds of the air is the job that
pleases Sgt. Quentin L. Warren,
former Stanford graduate, mqre than
any other. Except, of course, riding
them himself. But that is something
for him to look forward to.
Taking it easy on leave at the new
American Red Cross Liberty Club in
London, Quentin told of his work
with the U.S. Air Corps. "We look
after the big Fortresses before and
after their missions over enemy ter
ritory," said he"And we back them
all to win at any odds. And they
usually do."
Quentin says the boys on the
ground crews take great pride in
their work, which is to keep every
thing in perfect working order. Be
sides the mechanical details to be
seen to, there is refueling, patching
and mending, not to mention the
loading of the big bomb loads in the
Fortresses, which are appropriatly
named with such titles as "Mr. Five
by Five," or "Hitler's Gremlin."
Quentin, following graduation from
Stanford, traveled extensively in Eu
rope and paid a number of summer
holiday visits to England. "This
country seems different in war time,
of course," he said. "What impresses
me most about London is the myriad
of uniforms you see in the stx - eets
representing every Allied country.
It makes a gay parade, but under
neath it all, you seem to feel how
seriously the United Nations are
working to win this war."
The son uf Mr. and Mrs. Howard
S. Warren of Montclair, New Jersey,
Quentin has a brother in the Navy.
He hopes some day to be piloting one
of those same Fortresses which just
now he is looking after so well.
