### BY LATE WILLIAMS Don Langendorf 
As all you who are athletic minded
know, there will be intramural soft
ball this summer between the dit
ferent men's dorms. If you didn t
know, you do now. The real reason
Sports Editor Late Williams is not
writing this column for today is that
he wishes to rest his pitching arm as
he hopes to pull a few victories out
of the bag for Monroe Hall, known
better as the Beta Fraternity. Time
will tell.
COAST LEAGUE BALL
This week, Los Angeles and San
Francisco again fight it out for the
leadership of the league. Should the
Seals cop every game from the An
gels, they would still be one-hall
game out of the lead. Chances of
doing that are very slim. In fact,
chances of taking the series are
small.
Sports writers in the two cities
will undoubtedly take much space
in emphasizing the relative merits
of Frisco's Georgie Metkovich and
L.A.'s Andy Pafko. It is my opinion
that the much praised Metkovich will
turn out to be a bust by the end of
the season. In the recent Hollywood
series he had trouble hitting his own
weight.
The pitchers were slow-balling him
to death. They will continue to do
that all the way around the circuit.
Of course, no one can take away the
fact that Georgie has a wonderful
throwing arm. His big fault in hit
ting seems to be that he is con
tinually aiming for the fences. If he
hits a few homers at Wrigley Field,
don't be too surprised, for the fences
are very close in. "Lefty" O'Doul,
one of the best teachers of hitting in
baseball, should be able to correct
this fault.
Last week we saw Andy Pafko
play three games at Emeryville. He
suppsoedly hit 400 for the week. He
didn't look too good when we saw
him for he struck out several times
when a base-hit would have driven
in a run. The week before, he ended
the game in San Francisco by hitting
into an easy double-play when a
bingle would have tied the game.
We saw Pafko hit a ball into right
field that went for a double that in
the majors would have been a simple
out. He seems to me a minor league
sensation, something like Oscar Ek
hart, who won't click in the big time.

that all the way around the circuit.
Of course, no one can take away the
fact that Georgie has a wonderful
throwing arm. His big fault in hit
ting seems to be that he is con
tinually aiming for the fences. If he
hits a few homers at Wrigley Field,
don't be too surprised, for the fences
are very close in. "Lefty" O'Doul,
one of the best teachers of hitting in
baseball, should be able to correct
this fault.
Last week we saw Andy Pafko
play three games at Emeryville. He
suppsoedly hit 400 for the week. He
didn't look too good when we saw
him for he struck out several times
when a base-hit would have driven
in a run. The week before, he ended
the game in San Francisco by hitting
into an easy double-play when a
bingle would have tied the game.
We saw Pafko hit a ball into right
field that went for a double that in
the majors would have been a simple
out. He seems to me a minor league
sensation, something like Oscar Ek
hart, who won't click in the big time.
As all you who are athletic minded
know, there will be intramural soft
ball this summer between the dit
ferent men's dorms. If you didn t
know, you do now. The real reason
Sports Editor Late Williams is not
writing this column for today is that
he wishes to rest his pitching arm as
he hopes to pull a few victories out
of the bag for Monroe Hall, known
better as the Beta Fraternity. Time
will tell.
COAST LEAGUE BALL
This week, Los Angeles and San
Francisco again fight it out for the
leadership of the league. Should the
Seals cop every game from the An
gels, they would still be one-hall
game out of the lead. Chances of
doing that are very slim. In fact,
chances of taking the series are
small.
Sports writers in the two cities
will undoubtedly take much space
in emphasizing the relative merits
of Frisco's Georgie Metkovich and
L.A.'s Andy Pafko. It is my opinion
that the much praised Metkovich will
turn out to be a bust by the end of
the season. In the recent Hollywood
series he had trouble hitting his own
weight.
The pitchers were slow-balling him
to death. They will continue to do
that all the way around the circuit.
