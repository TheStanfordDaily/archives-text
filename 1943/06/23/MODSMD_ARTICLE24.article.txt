# Hazardous Season
## 
### 
CALIFORNIA is approaching one of the most hazardous forest
and brush fire seasons in its history. The past winter and
spring rains have provided an unusually heavy growth, which is
last becoming inflammable material. And coupled with this hazard
is a reduction in manpower available for fire fighting.
Of particular importance to us in this area is the need for con
trol of fires for civilian security reasons. This summer's fire season
might be disastrous unless every effort is made to develop a fire
consciousness among the people.
Recently there have been several brush fires in the vicinity
caused only by carelessness. Thre is no excuse for the motorist
who throws matchs or burning cigarettes from moving vehicles.
It is every person's duty to be on the alert to prevent and suppress
fires.
We must preserve our timber and agricultural products essen
tial to the war effort. Our fire fighting eguipment this summer
must be an understanding of the existing dangers. Public co
operation and extreme caution must be exercised in this fire
hazard area.
