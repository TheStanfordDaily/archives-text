•SUMMER school is different from other quarters. Although a
large number of the students are regular Stanfordites, many
graduate students and transfers from other universities are here
who have brought with them new ideas. From their experience
it other places, they may have plans or thoughts which will be
of value in our University.
Aside from the social and friendly angle, it is up to us to take
advantage of this opportunity to get acquainted with these new
students and find out the different opinions they have to offer. In
any undertaking there is room for improvement, and perhaps we
will be the benefactors, both in friends and in new ways of
doing things.
At the same time we should take stock of ourselves. We
should decide what we wish to accomplish. We should steer
away from academic courses and activities which will be of no
value so that we may get the most from our college education.
We must take inventory and profit from it.—Jane Donald
