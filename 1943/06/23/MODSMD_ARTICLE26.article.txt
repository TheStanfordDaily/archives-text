George was the best roommate I've ever had. We were to
gether our sophomore year and it was tops. Never a dull moment,
George used to say.
I remember the time he pledged the Saturday Evening Post
boy. The kid came up to the house every Wednesday with a
new Post. George would take the magazine without paying for
it and then he would teach the kid a couple more Greek letters.
Pretty soon he got to collecting dues from the kid, so he had to
give the little guy a pin. When the other kids in the low fifth
grade saw the pin they came up to the house with him. George
took his cut and pledged them all before the house president
made him stop. The house manager saw the possibilities of the
racket, but we decided to keep our frat club on the up and up.
The first quarter George and I were together he was going
steady with a girl from Mountain View High. Now this was a
lousy situation for a Stanford man. Even with the pre-war ratio
it was poor. I used to talk to George about it. Many a time I've
stayed up till 3 in the morning telling George how nice Stanford
women are. I didn't exactly waste all that time, because pretty
soon George started going with one of the nurses from the
Convalescent Home, which was a step closer to Stanford.
One thing against George. He used to post signs, sort of
memos to himself, all around the room. There were always five
or six sheets of binderpaper on the walls saying "Go to the gym
tomorrow" or "Life of Marcus Aurelius due at Libe" or "See Cel
lar re bounced check."
We said goodbye to each other on the board walk back of
Dinah's. My mother keeps asking about George. He's the type
of guy she wants me to be, but she doesn't know him very well.
Well, George is at Camp Roberts now. He writes occasionally
—"Me and the draftees from Missouri . . . never a dull moment,"
he savs.
