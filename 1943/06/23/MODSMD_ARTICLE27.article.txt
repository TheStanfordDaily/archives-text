Dr. Howard Lytle, Stanford '33,

Medical Corps, recently captured a
large collection of tropical insects
from the Japanese during the first
American offensive in the South
Pacific.
The collection, which was rescued
when the American Naval forces
captured Tulagi, once the stronghold
of the Japanese in the Solomons
area, has been transported to the
entomology department at Stanford
and turned over to Dr. Gordon Fer
ris.
Dr. Ferris, a professor of biology
and curator of entomology, said that
the collection, which must have re
quired several years to assemble, in
cludes a variety of unusual and in
teresting specimens. It was original
ly made by an entomologist in the
Australian colonial government in
the Solomons, who was forced to flee

lection behind.
After the recapture by Dr. Lytle,
