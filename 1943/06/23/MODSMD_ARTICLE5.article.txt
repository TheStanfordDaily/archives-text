Dean Grayson N. Kefauver, Dean of the Stanford School of Education,
; who just returned from Washington where he discussed intellectual co-
I operation in education after the war with foreign representatives, presented
| plans and ideas for re-education of nations after the war to the Tuesday
Evening Series audiences last night.
Dean Kefauver stressed the idea that the United Nations must riot

"♦"transplant education to conquered
I countries, but must instead help lib—
' erals within those countries to for
| a democratic type of education.
Professor John W. Dodds, Dean of
; the School of Humanities, introduced
Dean Kefauver, whose talk was fol
j lowed by a panel discussion. Mem
i bers of the panel were Philip W.
| Buck, professor of political science;
i I. James Quillen, associate professor
of education; Ralph H. Lutz, pro
fessor of history; and Bayard Q.
Morgan, professor of German.
Dean Kefauver's talk opened with
I a review of the war's effect on edu
cation, and told of the devastation of
educational machinery in some of
the Axis conquered nations.
"As many as 28 universities or in
! stitutions have been ruined in Po
land," he said. "Teachers have been
: shot or sent to concentration camps.
I Many other countries — Czechoslo
vakia. Greece, Yugoslavia, and China
have also had their educational fa
cilities ruined."
He went on to say that he be
lieved the youth and men of Ger
many would revolt against the Nazi
type of education forced upon them.
Professor Buck questioned educa
tion's place in post-war reconstruc
tion, contending that political and
economic questions must be settled
before any educational reconstruc
tion could become effective. Dean
Kefauver agreed that political and
! economic settlements of an interna
tional cooperative scale were impor
tant. but upheld his view that edu
! cation was undoubtedly one of the
most important aspects of interna
tional organization.
Professor Morgan wanted to know
j where the books and necessary funds
! could be found. Professor Buck won
j dered if there might not be a short
j age of brains.
Professor Quillen felt that there
would be a conflict between nation
alism. He stated that people should
have pointed out to them that just
as the good community is the one
that contributes to the state, the
i good state is the one that contributes
1 to the world. Dr. Lutz was skeptical
1 about an international plan and felt
that Dean Kefauver's proposal was
j idealistic.
