## 
### 
LONDON, June 22 —American Fly
ing Fortresses blasted one of Ger
many's biggest synthetic rubber
plants in the Ruhr and bombed the
important Antwerp motor factories
in daylight today, a few hours after
more than 700 R.A.F, planes smashed
the industrial city of Krefeld in one
of the war's heaviest raids.
American-built Mitchell bombers
of the RA.F. rounded out the day
night operation, the most extensive
in several weeks, by smashing at
Rotterdam while many squadrons of
British, American, Canadian, and
other Allied fighters staged diver
sionary sweeps and supported the
bigger planes.
A big force of Allied planes swept
over the southeast English coast in
the direction of Boulogne, France,
late this afternoon for another blow
at Adolf Hitler's European fortress.
A large formation of fortresses
struck at the rubber factories at Huls
20 miles northeast of Essen. Nestled
in the forest and considered one of
Germany's most skillfully camou
flaged industrial centers, the whole
Bona plants produce about 20 per
cent of the Reich synthetic rubber.
Pilots said that the Ruhr Valley
anti-aircraft fire was intense but
centralized only over the target it
self. It was one of the deepest Amer
ican penetrations of the Reich.
