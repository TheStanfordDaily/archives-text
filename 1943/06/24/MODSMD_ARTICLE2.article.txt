# Stamps To Be Sold Quarterly
## 
### 
Instead of having each student con
tribute to a weekly stamp drive, the
War Board has decided to ask each
Stanford man and woman to give
$2.50 to one drive at the beginning
of the quarter, according to Betty
May Hale, War Board coordinator.
This amount is equivalent to the
purchase of one stamp per week.
Women may buy their stamps
from their living group representa
tive, and stamps for men's halls will
be sold through resident assistants.
Stamp booths on Quad will be open
weekly next Thursday for the con
venience of faculty and also for
students to purchase more than §2.50
in war stamps.
Pledge Cards
Pledge cards are still being col
lected, and students will be called to
work as soon as possible. Red Cross
