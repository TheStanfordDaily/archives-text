Instead of having each student con
tribute to a weekly stamp drive, the
War Board has decided to ask each
Stanford man and woman to give
$2.50 to one drive at the beginning
of the quarter, according to Betty
May Hale, War Board coordinator.
This amount is equivalent to the
purchase of one stamp per week.
Women may buy their stamps
from their living group representa
tive, and stamps for men's halls will
be sold through resident assistants.
