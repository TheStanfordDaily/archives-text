Language Grammars
According to Mr. W. Youngs, ref
j erence librarian, the presence of
these men and their requests for
grammar and reading books of many
minor languages, as well as the more
popular ones, have shown up the
weak spots in the Library's stock.
Men have asked for books written
in such languages as Polish. Finnish,
I Hungarian, and Pidgin English. The
j Library is making every effort to
| obtain the desired books, but many
| must be sent from New York pub
i lishers and consequently require
! extra time to be delivered.
J Guide Series
Also of interest particularly to the
| Army men are the volumes now on
| exhibit which may be taken from
the cases at any time upon request,
j These books compose the American
! Guide Series, a Federal Writers'
! Project, and contain illustrations,
maps, and interesting information
concerning each of the States, Alas
ka, Puerto Rico, and the District of
Columbia. Each book was compiled
and written as part of a nationally
planned and directed program.
