### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Stanford has had its ups and downs j
in sports this year, but in one sport
at least, golf, the team has been both j
up and down at the same time. Bro
ther, that's a tie-up if we ever heard
of one.
The Indian golfers were undefeat
ed this year; of course they only
played two matches, but neverthe
less they were undefeated.
Nevertheless, these two matches
plus all the rounds that the men
played on their own, has led Coach
Eddie Twiggs to make the profound I
statement that this year's team would
have been a cinch to do a repeat per
formance in the National Collegiate
tournament.
The only trouble, as well as the
only reason the Farm is not sending
the squad back East to defend their ,
title, is because the armed forces j
has grabbed all but two players. I
On Guilder the Haetfg
Guilder Haegg. Finland's gift to
speedmerchants, has been apologiz
ing to newspaper writers about the
poor time that he made in the 5,000-
meter run in the A.A.U. meet.
Before the meet, the Finn com- i
plained of a headache and that he
was not yet in proper condition for
a good race. Then what does the guy
do but beat the American sensation, i
Greg Rice, by 40 meters.
Did Rice complain about a head
ache before the race? Na.
Did Rice say that he wasn't in good |
shape yet? Na.
All of this blurb only leads to the i
question of just how far the Flying
Finn would have beaten the Notre
Dame Dynamo if he had been in top
shape.
Considering all facts, we feel that }
there is only one way to show the
American public how fast Gunder
the Gun can run.
How about matching him against j
the fastest thing on legs in America i
—Count Fleet. Probably he the
closest race of the year. We accept.

played on their own, has led Coach
Eddie Twiggs to make the profound I
statement that this year's team would
have been a cinch to do a repeat per
formance in the National Collegiate
tournament.
The only trouble, as well as the
only reason the Farm is not sending
the squad back East to defend their ,
title, is because the armed forces j
has grabbed all but two players. I
On Guilder the Haetfg
Guilder Haegg. Finland's gift to
speedmerchants, has been apologiz
ing to newspaper writers about the
poor time that he made in the 5,000-
meter run in the A.A.U. meet.
Before the meet, the Finn com- i
plained of a headache and that he
was not yet in proper condition for
a good race. Then what does the guy
do but beat the American sensation, i
Greg Rice, by 40 meters.
Did Rice complain about a head
ache before the race? Na.
Did Rice say that he wasn't in good |
shape yet? Na.
All of this blurb only leads to the i
question of just how far the Flying
Finn would have beaten the Notre
Dame Dynamo if he had been in top
shape.
Considering all facts, we feel that }
there is only one way to show the
American public how fast Gunder
the Gun can run.
How about matching him against j
the fastest thing on legs in America i
—Count Fleet. Probably he the
closest race of the year. We accept.
