COUNTLESS editorials have been written on the Honor Code.
But this is a special editorial because it is directed to just
you, the new students at Stanford. We are not going to preach
adherence to the Honor Code. We want you to know exactly
what it means to us. Then we are sure you will live up to it in the
best way you can.
Materially the Honor Code at Stanford means unproctored
examinations and the lack of other steps by the University to
prevent student dishonesty.
But the Honor Code means more to us than these freedoms,
ft is proof of confidence in us as college adults. It is a manifesta
tion of faith in the honor of Stanford students. It means that we
are people to be trusted.
There is little that is more important than faith when people
are working together. The Honor Code is the guarantee of faith
and freedom which binds Stanford men and women together in
a sense of pride, honesty, and common tradition.
Specifically, the Honor Code is an undertaking of the students,
individually and collectively, that they will not give or receive
aid in examinations, class work, the preparation of reports; and
that they will obey the rules of the Library. The Honor Code
states that each student will do his share and take an active part
.in seeing to it that others obey the spirit and letter of the Code.
Traditions are dying at Stanford. The war has killed some of
the time-honored practices of students. But the Honor Code,
always the biggest and most important tradition, must not die.
We who know and appreciate it, and you who are being intro
duced to it, must know its worth and keep it solid.
Cherish the Honor Code, and it will not only be Stanford's to
keep, it will be yours.
