### BILL STRUTHERS 
Have you noticed the increase in the number of blondes on
campus? Bleached blondes at that. Where Palo Alto merchants
used to sell one quart of hydrogen peroxide to Stanford women,
I bet they sell two quarts now. Not that it bothers me. I sort of
like blonde hair, natural or artificial. Especially since I met Jane.
Or Zelda as we decided she should call herself.
You see I first saw Zelda looking at a time schedule as though
it was an entree of egg plant on the Cellar's dinner. I asked her
what was wrong and she explained it all. Zelda wants to be a
professional hostess on a luxury liner going to Latin or South
America after the war. She's a girl that looks into the future. She
figures that after the war, instead of weekending in the moun
tains, we'll probably go to Mexico or Panama. Whether we go by
boat or plane won't matter, she said. She was sure that there
would be parties both going and coming, and of course party
time on a weekend cruise needs a lot of hostesses.
I tried to talk her out of going four years to Stanford. Sha
really doesn't look like the college type. She said she thought
knowing Stanford men would be much better preparation than
working as a hat-check girl up at the International Settlement.
So we went out on the lawn in front of the Libe and looked at
the time schedule together. Since her advisor was completely
unsympathetic, I offered to take his place. I'm rather proud of
the program I planned for Zelda.
Training of the Speaking Voice to modify her Oklahoma
twang, Lectures in Comtemporary Art to help her fill in conver
sations about paintings and etchings, and Beginning Spanish and
Defensive Hygiene just to help her. A couple of friends are
tt.aching her to rumba and tango and I am teaching her how to
play bridge several evenings a week. Dodie Crile, social co
ordinator number one, is going to let her help entertain the
STARS at the Summer Shuffle, which is good.
But right now, Zelda is sort of lonesome. Say hello to her if
you see her on Quad.

But right now, Zelda is sort of lonesome. Say hello to her if
you see her on Quad.
Have you noticed the increase in the number of blondes on
campus? Bleached blondes at that. Where Palo Alto merchants
used to sell one quart of hydrogen peroxide to Stanford women,
I bet they sell two quarts now. Not that it bothers me. I sort of
like blonde hair, natural or artificial. Especially since I met Jane.
Or Zelda as we decided she should call herself.
You see I first saw Zelda looking at a time schedule as though
it was an entree of egg plant on the Cellar's dinner. I asked her
what was wrong and she explained it all. Zelda wants to be a
professional hostess on a luxury liner going to Latin or South
America after the war. She's a girl that looks into the future. She
figures that after the war, instead of weekending in the moun
tains, we'll probably go to Mexico or Panama. Whether we go by
boat or plane won't matter, she said. She was sure that there
would be parties both going and coming, and of course party
time on a weekend cruise needs a lot of hostesses.
I tried to talk her out of going four years to Stanford. Sha
really doesn't look like the college type. She said she thought
knowing Stanford men would be much better preparation than
working as a hat-check girl up at the International Settlement.
So we went out on the lawn in front of the Libe and looked at
the time schedule together. Since her advisor was completely
unsympathetic, I offered to take his place. I'm rather proud of
the program I planned for Zelda.
Training of the Speaking Voice to modify her Oklahoma
twang, Lectures in Comtemporary Art to help her fill in conver
sations about paintings and etchings, and Beginning Spanish and
Defensive Hygiene just to help her. A couple of friends are
tt.aching her to rumba and tango and I am teaching her how to
play bridge several evenings a week. Dodie Crile, social co
ordinator number one, is going to let her help entertain the
STARS at the Summer Shuffle, which is good.
But right now, Zelda is sort of lonesome. Say hello to her if
you see her on Quad.
