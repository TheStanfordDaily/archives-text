"Stanford in war, with your help, will see that the
America of the past becomes the America of the fu
ture," said Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur as he ad
dressed more than 1,200 students and members of the
faculty at an all-University assembly yesterday.
"It is up to us to give every man and woman a fair
chance to take part in life around them without com
pulsion. We must accept the compulsion only for the
time being," he stated.
Dr. Wilbur spoke of the University as a place where
one man in research can do more for the war than
several in something else; he pointed out that you
never know who is great or who will be great in a
university, and that some twist in the mind of an ex
pert at college may be more important to victory than
in actual fighting.
"Victory won't come soon nor easy and it will be
somewhat difficult to recognize it when it does come,"
he emphasized and told how students must prepare
themselves to assist with the rehabilitation in the oc
cupied countries.
"Our success in war can be measured in some degree
by our success here. All of the changes at Stanford are
aimed at getting a product that is good."
It is toward this end that the Army units are being
trained; the soldiers here in advanced units are to be
come experts in engineering, medicine, personnel psy
chology, and foreign area languages. In a short time
basic units will arrive here which will be trained in
pre-medicine, physics, math, and engineering.

''For (he lirst time we are in a position to use letters
and social science for training men in war science. The
complicated problems which will face us if we are to
deal with the peoples in countries when we move into
them demand that we have trained men in psychology
and languages alongside the combat officers," Dr. Wil
bur said.
'"College is being squeezed together and punched
with holes to give concentration of study," he con
tinued.
The Chancellor explained that the men in the ad
vanced training units are as much Stanford students as
those registered in the University. They will get credit
for their work here and are in line for degrees from the
University.
In speaking of the changes in Stanford life, Dr. Wil
bur said that intercollegiate athletics were a war cas
ualty because of the necessity of speeding up the train
ing of officers. He also mentioned that the fraternities
now don't have Greek letters over their doorways, but
the names of presidents of the United States.
He emphasized that student government is a feature
of Stanford life which, although it does not always
receive a passing mark, is the best form of government
because of the Honor Code.
"The Honor Code means that no one gets a dirty
diploma. It means that we should live clean, decent
lives. When we meet a Stanford man, we know what
we may expect from him. The Honor Code is in the
hands of the students to enforce and to cherish."
He stated that student government must be one of
the institutions at Stanford which must survive the
war.

"Stanford in war, with your help, will see that the
America of the past becomes the America of the fu
ture," said Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur as he ad
dressed more than 1,200 students and members of the
faculty at an all-University assembly yesterday.
"It is up to us to give every man and woman a fair
chance to take part in life around them without com
pulsion. We must accept the compulsion only for the
time being," he stated.
Dr. Wilbur spoke of the University as a place where
one man in research can do more for the war than
several in something else; he pointed out that you
never know who is great or who will be great in a
university, and that some twist in the mind of an ex
pert at college may be more important to victory than
in actual fighting.
"Victory won't come soon nor easy and it will be
somewhat difficult to recognize it when it does come,"
he emphasized and told how students must prepare
themselves to assist with the rehabilitation in the oc
cupied countries.
"Our success in war can be measured in some degree
by our success here. All of the changes at Stanford are
aimed at getting a product that is good."
It is toward this end that the Army units are being
trained; the soldiers here in advanced units are to be
come experts in engineering, medicine, personnel psy
chology, and foreign area languages. In a short time
basic units will arrive here which will be trained in
pre-medicine, physics, math, and engineering.

''For (he lirst time we are in a position to use letters
and social science for training men in war science. The
complicated problems which will face us if we are to
deal with the peoples in countries when we move into
them demand that we have trained men in psychology
and languages alongside the combat officers," Dr. Wil
bur said.
'"College is being squeezed together and punched
with holes to give concentration of study," he con
tinued.
The Chancellor explained that the men in the ad
vanced training units are as much Stanford students as
those registered in the University. They will get credit
for their work here and are in line for degrees from the
University.
In speaking of the changes in Stanford life, Dr. Wil
bur said that intercollegiate athletics were a war cas
ualty because of the necessity of speeding up the train
ing of officers. He also mentioned that the fraternities
now don't have Greek letters over their doorways, but
the names of presidents of the United States.
He emphasized that student government is a feature
of Stanford life which, although it does not always
receive a passing mark, is the best form of government
because of the Honor Code.
"The Honor Code means that no one gets a dirty
diploma. It means that we should live clean, decent
lives. When we meet a Stanford man, we know what
we may expect from him. The Honor Code is in the
hands of the students to enforce and to cherish."
He stated that student government must be one of
the institutions at Stanford which must survive the
war.
