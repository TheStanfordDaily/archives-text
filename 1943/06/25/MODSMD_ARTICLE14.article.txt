# Stuart Sees Foreign Service As a First Line of Defense
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Foreign service, according to Pro
fessor Graham H. Stuart of the Po
litical Science Department, is one of
the first lines of a country's defense
against war. Through diplomatic
channels men who have traveled and
studied people, languages, govern
ments, customs, are able, through
experience, to help make the func
tions of international relations run
more smoothly.
Stanford has trained or had part
in the education of the third largest
group of foreign diplomats and state
department personnel from any uni
versity in the United States. Men
and women who once paced daily
from the Stanford poli. sei. depart
ment to the main library and back
to the law school or econ. depart
ment in liberal preparation for their
careers are now in every corner of
the earth using their knowledge
during one of the most interesting
phases of the world's diplomatic his
tory.
