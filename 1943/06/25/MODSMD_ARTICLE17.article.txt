# LaMarr, Boyer To Star Sunday
## 
### 
Slated for Sunday night at the
Memorial Auditorium is "Algiers,'
first of the Tillson Talkies. The pic
ture, starring Charles Boyer and the
glamorous Hedy LaMarr, is the story
of the North African city which is
close to the center of much of the
present war activity.
The film was produced some time
ago and the plot involves an escaped
French jewel thief played by Boyer
who meets the lovely LaMarr. Then
follows the romance between the two
in which LaMarr attempts to plan
for his escape, but being unsuccess
ful, finally leaves without knowing
that he is later captured.
On the whole, it is both entertain
ing and subtle and since newer films
cannot be obtained at present. Miss
Tillson believes that it will be en
joyed by both the students and the
men of the Army units.
Accompanying "Algiers" will be a
recent newsreel and a cartoon, whose
title has not been announced. Cur
tain goes up at 7:15 p.m. and admis
sion price is 20 cents.
