# LATE TIPS
## 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
With each passing clay, the fall
sports picture at the Farm lakes on
a little more gloom. We've been
harping on this same subject for
two weeks, saying, "If the Army
does this," and "If the Army does
that," Stanford will or will not have
a football team next season.
Well men. still no definite word
from the heads of the Army or from
the three-man committee that Presi
dent Roosevelt was supposed to have
picked regarding the armed forces
stand as to competitive athletics.
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
speaking at the all-University as
sembly, hinted that intercollegiate
athletics were through for the dura
tion. He stated that athletics had
become a "war casualty."
That statement slams the door for
Stanford, unless some unforeseen
event occurs.
However, with the Navy allowing
their men to compte, we still think
that ALL intercollegiate sports are
not washed up.. Schools such as Cali
fornia and U.S.C. have so much ma
teria! noY. r they will probably take
up half the stadium seating capacity
with the squads alone.
Let's hope that the unforeseen
event does occur—but quick.
TIPOFFS AND KISSOFFS—Per
haps we were thinking of the great
Paavo Nurmi Wednesday night when
we were writing about Guilder
Haegg. Anyway, the fact remains
that we said Haegg was from Fin
land. An inexcusable error. Mr.
Haegg is from Sweden, but definitely.
We apologize . . . Stanford's pride
and joy of the swimming circles is
Emniclt Cashin who did the impos
sible last season by shattering seven
major breaststroke records and on
the same day in the same race.
Cashin is planning to go after
seven or eight world marks in the
Stanford pool sometime in July be
fore going East to compete in the
nationals. Better be there when he
goes gunnin' for those marks . . . .
Harry Wolter stopped us yesterday
and mentioned that Ward Walkup.
captain and catcher of last season's
Indian nine, had been sent to Cal
by the Navy. It would be ironical if
Walkup faced Wolter's team next
season from the Bears' side of the
diamond. It would probably be even
more ironical if the Indians had a
baseball team next season. Let's face
facts .... We've been waiting to see
Johnny Fulton before discussing the
A.A.U. track meet but it's way over
due. and still no Fulton. First, let's
tip our hat to Johnny for his third
place in the 400-meter race. Fulton's
big ambition this year was to meet
Cal s (Jrover "the Rover" Kleniiner,
but somehow, the Bear flash always
seemed to be doing something else
when the time presented itself. The
finish oi the 400-meter job in the
nationals this year marked the sec
ond time this season that Fulton has
followed the spikes of Southern
California's athlete of the year, Cliff
Bourland to the tape in dual compe
tition. . . . There should be a battle
royal between the intramural soft
ball teams when the season opens
next Wednesday. The only trouble
so far, is that there are not enough
teams signed up to make things real
ly interesting. . . . Come on men, get
your house into the fracas. Let's
play ball, get hep, hit the line. etc.
Nuff said.

TIPOFFS AND KISSOFFS—Per
haps we were thinking of the great
Paavo Nurmi Wednesday night when
we were writing about Guilder
Haegg. Anyway, the fact remains
that we said Haegg was from Fin
land. An inexcusable error. Mr.
Haegg is from Sweden, but definitely.
We apologize . . . Stanford's pride
and joy of the swimming circles is
Emniclt Cashin who did the impos
sible last season by shattering seven
major breaststroke records and on
the same day in the same race.
Cashin is planning to go after
seven or eight world marks in the
Stanford pool sometime in July be
fore going East to compete in the
nationals. Better be there when he
goes gunnin' for those marks . . . .
Harry Wolter stopped us yesterday
and mentioned that Ward Walkup.
captain and catcher of last season's
Indian nine, had been sent to Cal
by the Navy. It would be ironical if
Walkup faced Wolter's team next
season from the Bears' side of the
diamond. It would probably be even
more ironical if the Indians had a
baseball team next season. Let's face
facts .... We've been waiting to see
Johnny Fulton before discussing the
A.A.U. track meet but it's way over
due. and still no Fulton. First, let's
tip our hat to Johnny for his third
place in the 400-meter race. Fulton's
big ambition this year was to meet
Cal s (Jrover "the Rover" Kleniiner,
but somehow, the Bear flash always
seemed to be doing something else
when the time presented itself. The
finish oi the 400-meter job in the
nationals this year marked the sec
ond time this season that Fulton has
followed the spikes of Southern
California's athlete of the year, Cliff
Bourland to the tape in dual compe
tition. . . . There should be a battle
royal between the intramural soft
ball teams when the season opens
next Wednesday. The only trouble
so far, is that there are not enough
teams signed up to make things real
ly interesting. . . . Come on men, get
your house into the fracas. Let's
play ball, get hep, hit the line. etc.
Nuff said.
With each passing clay, the fall
sports picture at the Farm lakes on
a little more gloom. We've been
harping on this same subject for
two weeks, saying, "If the Army
does this," and "If the Army does
that," Stanford will or will not have
a football team next season.
Well men. still no definite word
from the heads of the Army or from
the three-man committee that Presi
dent Roosevelt was supposed to have
picked regarding the armed forces
stand as to competitive athletics.
Chancellor Ray Lyman Wilbur
speaking at the all-University as
sembly, hinted that intercollegiate
athletics were through for the dura
tion. He stated that athletics had
become a "war casualty."
That statement slams the door for
Stanford, unless some unforeseen
event occurs.
However, with the Navy allowing
their men to compte, we still think
that ALL intercollegiate sports are
not washed up.. Schools such as Cali
fornia and U.S.C. have so much ma
teria! noY. r they will probably take
up half the stadium seating capacity
with the squads alone.
Let's hope that the unforeseen
event does occur—but quick.
