## Mural Signup Ends Monday 
### 
Two more teams sighed up yester
day for play in the President's
League, bringing the list up to seven.
Monday still remains as the deadline
for prospective softball teams to
make their appearance on the signup
sheet in the gym.
Not only are houses up the
Row eligible, but also Army units
on and off campus and the different
organizations such as the Firehouse
on the campus. The Army has al
ready taken steps to enter a team.
It is expected that they will field
several teams since Army men are
considered as student body members.
"There is a dire need for umpires
to arbitrate the softball games,"
Harry Wolter, director of intramural
activities, announced late yesterday.
Wolter also made it clear that each
official would be paid a fee lor each
game he works.
