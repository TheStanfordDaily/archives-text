# Pafko's Homer Helps L.A. Win
## 
### 
With Andy Pafko again leading
the attack wilh his third homer in
consecutive games, Los Angeles
hammered out its third victory in
the series over a quintet of San
Francisco pitchers yesterday. Char
lie English followed suit with his
second homer of the series and
Georgie Metkovich hit one for the
Seals.
Jodie Phipps, trying for his tenth
victory of the season against no
losses, couldn't hold the Seals in
check and had to be relieved in the
fourth with Olin Baker finally re
ceiving credit for the victory.
"Lefty" O'Doul paraded Harrell,
Buzolich, Parsons, Ballou, and Gib
son to the mound, but none of them
were able to hold down the terrific
power of the Angels.
In another Coast League game,
Portland's Joe Orrell approached
baseball's hall of fame with a one
hit masterpiece over San Diego in
the second game of a double-header.
