# Sad Story of the Libe
## 
### 
THERE is a common courtesy at Stanford which is being
neglected. And it is maintaining quiet in the Library.
Time was when visiting the Library in the evening was the
social thing to do. It meant a visit with one's friends and a pos
sible coke date. This form of entertainment has gone by the
boards; or, at least, it should have.
Now, there are students who go to the Libe because they are
ordered to, and there are students who wish to work hard and
study earnestly. Perhaps both categories of students realize the
present necessity for learning and the seriousness of the times.
And both groups undoubtedly still wish to be social and have as
good a time as possible.
But the latter groups of students, those who study of their
own free will, do not visit the Libe on evenings they wish to be
social. The other group hasn't much choice.
It sems hardly necessary to point out that those students who
are ordered to study at the Libe should refrain from the type of
sociability which disturbs the other half. Quiet in the Library is
not only a rule, it is a courtesy.
