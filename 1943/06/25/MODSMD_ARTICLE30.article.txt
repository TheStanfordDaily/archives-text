### BILL STRUTHERS 
Every time I write a letter to my friends in the service it takes
me 500 words to explain what I'm still doing at Stanford. It used
to take only 250 words, which shows I am taking the war and
my own civilian status more seriously. This is good.
In fact I've been thinking about it guite a bit lately. I've even
managed to work Dr. Wilbur's speech yesterday into my think
ing. Dr. Wilbur is right. We've got to work more and play less.
We've got to sacrifice individual freedom to preserve our col
lective freedom. We've got to feed and clothe and rehabilitate
end put new glass in the broken windows for the people of the
invaded countries. It's a big job and we—"the younger genera
tion"—must do it.
But parallel to that thought is one that I, and perhaps a few
others here at Stanford, have. I've got about 50 days of college
left before I go. I plan to come back to college after the war,
but I'll be changed. I'll be older, more studious, guieter. So in
the end I've about fifty days left of college as I know it today.
What can I do to get the most out of those last days? How can
I make my last guarter mean the most to me?
Here's the way I've worked it out. In a lot of ways I'm a
typical American. Too much so in some ways, because I don't
do things like winning the war unless I get mad. Good and mad.
So mad that I want to rip every Jap and German apart personally.
Now Stanford is a very nice place. It's extremely hard to feel
that way while I'm sunning myself on the English corner. Even
reading war news leaves me far from mad.
So that's the situation. I want to help win the war. I want to
get the most from my last guarter at Stanford. I also want the
biggest two months of party-time that I've ever had in my life.
Something's got to go. So far it hasn't been my sleep.
If you've got any ideas, please let me know.
