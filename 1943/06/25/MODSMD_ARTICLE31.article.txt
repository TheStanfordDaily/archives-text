# Service Man Explains Army To Students
## 
### Pfc. H.F. Sawyer 
For the information of new Stan
ford students as well as some who
were on campus last quarter, it is
thought necessary to explain the part
being played in University life by
the many service men stationed
here.
The three groups in uniform on the
! campus are the Army Specialized
Training Unit 3905 (ASTU), Army
Specialized Training Assignment and
Reclassification Unit 3903 (ASTAR),
and the men who are enrolled in the
advanced course of the Stanford Re
serve Officers Training Corps unit.
Take Standard Courses
Men in the AST unit are taking
standard University courses under a
I quickened program. These men may
! remain here until their prescribed
I courses are completed, a period of
j approximately a year.
ASTAR unit, by far the largest,
is composed of men being classified
j and recommended, if selected, for
training in the AST program. While
at Stanford, these men are subjected
to numerous tests, and, if the results
are satisfactory, these men are
transferred to AST units in this and
j other colleges of the nation.
j If the examination results are not
satisfactory, the men are returned for
duty in the armed forces. ASTAR
men are stationed here for periods
of from one to four weeks.
Regular Stanford Students
Last, but by no means least, is the
I ROTC. These men were all regular
| Stanford students before being called
to active duty and are taking various
courses here while awaiting orders to
j enter an officer candidate school.
J Certain of the men, now on active
! duty with the enlisted reserve, will
! probably remain here throughout
j Summer Quarter.
All military units at Stanford are
under the command of Col. Harry
j B. Allen as commandant.
