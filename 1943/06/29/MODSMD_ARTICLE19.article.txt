The world today forgot about
strikes and raging buttles and turned
its eyes upon the little city of Orazo,
Peru where the annual Chuscumbora
turnament is taking place. Chus
cumbol'istas from all over South
America make an annual higira to
the tiny city to partake in one of
the most important sports events of
our neighboring continent.
Chuscumbora requires extreme
muscular precision. A balloon filled
with water is dropped from a hun
dred foot tower and the Chuscum
borista must kick the balloon with
out breaking it before it hits the
ground. The man kicking it the
greatest distance is the winner.
Last year Eduardo Jose Manuel
Chardino y Glutz broke the world's
record before a record crowd of 500
screaming spectators.
There is intense interest in this
year's contest for an unknown from
an undisclosed South American
country is expected to give the pres
ent champion quite a run for his
money.
Chuscumbora was introduced into
this country a few years ago but
onlv met with mild success.
