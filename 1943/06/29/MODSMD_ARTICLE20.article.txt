## Murals Start Tomorrow Eve. 
### 
With 13 teams signed up for intra
mural Softball, Director of Intra
mural Sports Harry Wolter set him
self to the task today of making out
a schedule to last for the remainder
of this quarter.
Another thing troubling Wolter
concerning intramural Softball is the
lack of umpires. They are needed
and needed badly. All those inter
ested in making some small change
should see Wolter immediately. Um
pires will be paid for each game
worked.
The first games will come off
Wednesday at 7:15 sharp on the frosh
football field and the field immedi
ately across from it.
Teams that signed up to participate
include 10 halls and three campus
organizations. They are McKinley,
Monroe, Hayes, Tyler, Cleveland,
Fillmore, Garfield, Lincoln, Arthur,
Buchanan, Gerona A.C., Boat House
Boys, and the Firehouse.
