YESTERDAY The Daily welcomed a new group of tryoutees.
The staff was glad to see them, not only because the paper
must have new blood to keep it going, but because they will
benefit from the experience of working on The Daily.
We hope that the obligation of The Daily to present the cur
rent events of the campus clearly and accurately to the students
is important to these newcomers. And we hope that they will
see that obligation reflected in their own responsibility to find
and cover fully the news of our war-time campus.
Through the four years that they will comprise the Daily
staff these potential reporters, copyreaders, and eventual editors,
will find themselves ex-officio members of important campus
groups and publicity chairmen of all campus committees. It is
their privilege to be the chroniclers of Stanford history during
the time they are here. In years to come, future students will
open volumes of The Daily to their papers for data of Stanford
in World War 11.
Copy desk work and news reporting looks difficult and com
plex now. But the old staff members will be patient, remember
ing their early mistakes and bewilderment, in return for the
enthusiasm and effort of the tryoutees. It's an old Daily tradition.

Lest We Forget
DESCRIBING a recent American raid over the continent of Eu
rope, a news broadcaster simply said, "Thirty-seven Flying
Fortresses failed to return."
Perhaps the American public is becoming calloused to war
and death. Perhaps we cannot evoke enough emotion to sorrow
over each war casualty. Perhaps we cannot take time in harried
war living to stop and realize just what it means when 37 planes
fail to return.
Yet there are those who have written of the tragedies of war.
There are those who have realized the suffering and the sacri
fice. In 1897 Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called "Recessional."
For the 37 Flying Fortresses that failed to return, to the announ
cer who revealed the fact, for the public we quote:
"God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle-line,
.... Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget!"

open volumes of The Daily to their papers for data of Stanford
in World War 11.
Copy desk work and news reporting looks difficult and com
plex now. But the old staff members will be patient, remember
ing their early mistakes and bewilderment, in return for the
enthusiasm and effort of the tryoutees. It's an old Daily tradition.

Lest We Forget
DESCRIBING a recent American raid over the continent of Eu
rope, a news broadcaster simply said, "Thirty-seven Flying
Fortresses failed to return."
Perhaps the American public is becoming calloused to war
and death. Perhaps we cannot evoke enough emotion to sorrow
over each war casualty. Perhaps we cannot take time in harried
war living to stop and realize just what it means when 37 planes
fail to return.
Yet there are those who have written of the tragedies of war.
There are those who have realized the suffering and the sacri
fice. In 1897 Rudyard Kipling wrote a poem called "Recessional."
For the 37 Flying Fortresses that failed to return, to the announ
cer who revealed the fact, for the public we quote:
"God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle-line,
.... Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget!"
YESTERDAY The Daily welcomed a new group of tryoutees.
The staff was glad to see them, not only because the paper
must have new blood to keep it going, but because they will
benefit from the experience of working on The Daily.
We hope that the obligation of The Daily to present the cur
rent events of the campus clearly and accurately to the students
is important to these newcomers. And we hope that they will
see that obligation reflected in their own responsibility to find
and cover fully the news of our war-time campus.
Through the four years that they will comprise the Daily
staff these potential reporters, copyreaders, and eventual editors,
will find themselves ex-officio members of important campus
groups and publicity chairmen of all campus committees. It is
their privilege to be the chroniclers of Stanford history during
the time they are here. In years to come, future students will
open volumes of The Daily to their papers for data of Stanford
in World War 11.
