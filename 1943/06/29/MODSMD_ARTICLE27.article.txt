### BILL STRUTHERS 
This is going to be a good quarter. I know it is. You see,
I've met a girl, but that's only part of it. Besides this girl is like
the two of hearts in a game of seven-card stud with deuces wild.
I am the jack of clubs, which isn't very close, and I am usually
in the unused part of the deck. But she's a blonde with a nice tan
who looks good in a bathing suit, so I'm just waiting for a game
of fifty-two pickup.
More encouraging is my cigarette situation. I've discovered
that Paul Egeler, Frankie Frazier, and Blossom Parke are repre
sentatives tor Phillip Morris cigarettes. Three bosom buddies
from the old school with plenty of samples to give away. I love
them tenderly and I want them to know that their cigarettes leave
my throat in swell shape. Just like they said it would be.
Tom Murrieta and I are going to have Inter-Fraternity meet
ings at the men's pool. We chose the pool because everybody
looks quite alike without clothes on, and Company G will think
we are Company A wishing we could stay at Stanford.
Another high point this quarter will be the parties that I've
sort of arranged for myself. You see, another guy and I are the
only guys left from our frat club, but there are numerous women
wearing pins and rings which indirectly belong to our bros.
Now from all appearances and for several reasons these women
aren't getting around as much as they did before their men went
io war. This is the kind of thing that I notice and take advantage
of. So these women are taking us out for a milkshake on them,
which is good, because I'm thirsty. Also, it's the only way I've
found to learn just where the absent bros. are. They don't write
to me.
Yes, it's going to be a good quarter.
