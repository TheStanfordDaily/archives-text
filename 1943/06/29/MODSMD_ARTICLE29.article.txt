# "Crash Dive" Features Old Triangle Plot
## 
### 
; CRASH DIVE —now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
I Featuring some fine technicolor
! photography, "Crash Dive" is an en
tertaining "war version" of the old
'■ eternal triangle.
The plot in a nut shell concerns
two American naval officers, played
by Tyrone Power and Dana An
drews, who are in love with the same
gal, portrayed by Ann Baxter.
Power wins out and the two officers
go to sea in a submarine with a little
friction between them. The subma
! rine gets its chance to help beat the
1 Axis and everything ends happily.
Realistic action shots and good act
ing in the supporting roles all help
make "Crash Dive" worth the ad
mission price.
Also playing is "He Hired the
Boss" with Stuart Erwin.—Gugel
