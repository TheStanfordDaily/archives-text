# BLOOD BANK
## Donors Needed For Thursday 
### 
For the first time this quarter I
Stanford students, 28 of them, will j
go to the Community Center this I
Thursday to donate a pint of their j
blood to the Red Cross Blood Bank j
mobile unit.
As yet the quota has not been j
filled, but any student who wishes !
to help complete it may make an
appointment with Helen Herring or
at the War Board office.
Students must sign up by 5 this
afternoon. The War Board will be
open between 10 and 12 and between
1 and 4.
Appointments are open for 11:20,
11:40, and 1:40, and the entire proc
ess takes a half hour, according to j
Miss Herring. The Red Cross will 1
furnish transportation to those who
need it.
''Students between 18 and 21 must !
have slips signed by their parents, j
and they can get these blanks at the i
War Board office," said Miss Her- ,
ring, blood bank chairman. "If
you've given blood before, remem- j
ber that there has to be an eight- |
week period between each dona- :
tion."
Last Quarter the blood unit came
to Palo Alto four times and each j
time Stanford's quota was filled with
28 students, making a total of 112 '
students who gave their blood dur- j
ing the quarter.
