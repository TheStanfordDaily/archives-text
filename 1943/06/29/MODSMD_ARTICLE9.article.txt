# Soldier Orchestra To Play At Stan-Stu Dance July 10
## 
### 
A 15-piece orchestra composed of j
personnel of the 53rd Infantry regi- !
ment has been selected to furnish
music for the Stan-Stu "At Ease" to
be given July 10 in the Women's
Gvm by Stanford students in co
operation with Companies E and F
of AST Unit 3905.
Of interest to Stanford students is
the fact that Art McHugh, Stanford
graduate, is the arranger and pianist '
for the orchestra, the best available
in the San Francisco area.
Decorations for the dance will
have a military theme and feature ]
replicas of the distinctive insignia of
several arms of the service. The '

| decorations are being planned by
Pfc. Norbourne Shrader and T .
Robert Aby.
Besides a variety program under
the direction of Sergt. Melwyn Klar
and Pfc. Bert Hill there will be games
and buffet refreshments.
In contrast to dances given here
recently there will be no signups.
Invitations will be sent to women at
their dormitories. A special invita- j
: tion has been extended to regular '
Stanford men students. They may |
obtain tickets through their halls; â– 
j men of E, F. G. and H companies i
J should see their social chairmen for
' tickets.
