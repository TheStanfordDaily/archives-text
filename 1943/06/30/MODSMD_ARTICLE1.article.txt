# Wallace, Jones Disagree On Administrative Policy
## 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON. June 29—President Roosevelt, beset by a new feud in
his official family—a battle of invective between Vice-President Henry A.
Wallace and RFC Chairman Jesse Jones—today deplored the public airing
of administrative quarrels.
He conceded that he was taken by surprise by the Wallace blast, a 28-

page statement characterizing Jones'*
as a "ham-stringing, bureaucratic
obstructionist, and back-door com
plainer" who had "failed dismally
to build up adequate government
stockpiles of war-needed materials.
Jones 'fanned the flames by coun
tering that Wallace wa: indulging in
malice and misstatement."
The latest feud involves the RFC,
headed by Jones, and the Bureau ol
Economic Welfare, headed by Wal
lace.
No Adequate Stockpiles
Wallace charged that Jones and
the RFC, besides failing to build ade
quate stockpiles, then resorted to
"obstructionist tactics" when the
BEW sought to do the job.
The charges and countercharges
apparently were made without Mr.
Roosevelt's prior knowledge. He told
his press conference he had seen a
newspaper headline on the Wallace
statement only about five minutes
before reporters filed into the White
House executive office.
Wallace's blast carried a preface
saying he was impelled by a "sense
of public duty" to air the facts
against Jones whom he accused of
"creating false impressions" before !
Congress.
BEW Independent
He proposed that Congress made
the BEW financially independent of j
the RFC in the purchase of imported i
strategic materials, saying "we are |
helpless when Jesse Jones, as our
banker, refuses to sign checks in ac
cordance with our directions."
He said the BEW was succeeding
at the job of building up stockpiles
despite "exasperating rearguard ac
tion by RFC officials who are still
