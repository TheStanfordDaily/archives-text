# Farm Men Fight War With K.P., Guard Duty
## 
### A Sgt. Ferris Boothe 
It's just three months since that
fateful April 5 when Stanford's ERC
checked into the Army at Fort Mac-
Arthur, Presidio of Monterey, and
other induction centers, and, con
trary to our expectations, we haven't
yet won the war. Most of us are very
little cogs doing little jobs in a very
large machine—the Army has made
us realize that.
The story of Stanford's stay at
Monterey has already been told. We
spent from 4 to 40 days waiting to
be shipped out as Army requisitions
demanded.
Atlantic City
A group of us were sent to At
lantic City, N.J., for basic training,
where we found a huge military post
sprawling in the middle of America's
largest beach resort. It looked like
an exciting place, and it was—after
duty hours if we weren't restricted
or didn't have guard duty or" K.P.
or a G.I. scrub party.
Stanford men scattered among the
various training groups and hotels
included Daily Night Editor Bill
Hornby, Harry Strick, Gaieties star
and director Bob O'Neill, Tiny
Mosher, Jack Henigan. Dan Mc-
Ganney, debater Jim Kessler, bowler
Hex Golobic, ace hurler Don Reiss,
Jack Coppage, Bob Cubberly, Ray
Smith, baseballer, boxer Jeff Howe,
and myself.
Familiar Faces
Mostly we saw each other just on
weekends, but occasionally we would
hear, as I did, a shout. "Corporal of
the Guard. Post Number Three!" and
see the familiar face of Willie Hornby
on guard duty at the mess hall in the
midst of a bitter argument with two
corporals and about 250 hungry men.
Or we would be spending one of
those long minutes in chow line and
see Kessler's perspiring face come
up from behind one of the steaming
three-loot G.I. kettles or see Howe's
damp visage behind a stack of G.I.
eating trays.
Convention Hall
Atlantic City was an experience—
marching men in fatigues and gas
masks sometimes carrying rifles were
everywhere along its eight-mile
Boardwalk — a four-column drab
centipede among the gaily dressed
vacationers loitering to watch "the
boys."
We had the Atlantic City Conven
tion Hall, largest in the world, which
could seat 44,000 persons to see a
football game on an indoor field of
regulation size, and could seat 5,000
to see movies in the second-floor

I movies and talks which broke up our
days. As the weeks wore on, our
days became a succession of three
! mile marches from and to the drill
field for weary hours of calisthenics,
| running, close order and extended
drill, and combat teaching.
The monotony was broken up by
the three Army details—K.P.. fa
tigue duty, and guard duty. Of these,
K.P. was the worst because of the
long work day from 2:45 a.m. to 8
! p.m. And we pulled K.P. at bad
times —Sundays, Decoration Day,
plus regular duty days during our
i stay.
You learn to goldbrick on K.P.,
it's the only way to finish the day;
do your work and no more; if you
work fast, they just think up more
for you to do.
Drill Field
Guard duty consists of moving into
the guard room of some other hotel
and spending a 24-hour shift two
hours on and four hours off. Fatigue
duty is the easiest—an eight-hour
I day of cleaning.
Our drill field was a mile-square
piece of land near the ocean which
had previously seen service, lots of
service, as the city dump. Filled with
cinders, broken glass, and lots of
dust. it. was a hell-hole when 10,000
men started double-timing around
the field.
Basic Finished
But it was soon over—time goes
fast in the Army—and our group of
Stanford men was brooken up once
more—Hornby, Strick, O'Neill, and
Henigan went to CCNY in New York
for ASTP. (Ed. note—Hornby is now
stationed in the ASTU at Stanford.)
Howe went to radio school in Illinois
with Jim Kessler. I wound up in
Greeley, Colo., in Air Corps Ad-
S ministration.
Our basic training is over and most
of us are taking training leading
either into specialized work with
I further training, into permanent
| party at some military post, or to a
1 POE (Port of Embarkation) within
! a couple of months. Many of us in
specialized schools have received
ratings—Corporal, PFC, Technician
Fourth or Fifth. These ratings
seemed insignificant in civil life, but
we accept them with gratitude.
Tarining' Continues
We live in dormitories in the Colo
rado State College of Education,
a beautiful little college with a green
campus that makes me homesick for
Stanford.
So our training goes on. We've
changed a lot in the past three
months—we've lost all our cocky
i ideas about college training being
; open sesame to OCS or ASTP. In
many camps, this one included, we
are not even allowed to apply until
we leave and then, we realize op
portunities are very limited. If we
go POE. we just forget about being
an officer or returning to school.
We've lost a lot of our individuality
and initiative because the Army
moves as a whole" and the individual,
ahead or behind, is out of line. But
the Army has given us good physical
1 condition, a discipline which many
| ol us lacked, and a lot of valuable
i knowledge — curricular and extra
-1 curricular.
