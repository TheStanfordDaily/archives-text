### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Patience. Yep, that's what you
need men, patience.
We were sitting around chewing
pencils last night (an old Daily prac
tice, by the way) and who should
drop into the Shack but Bill Hornby,
former sports writer for The Daily.
Now Bill has been in the Army for
some time, and in the line of duty,
he has gotten around the country
quite a bit. This brings us up to
the point of the thing that we were
going to make a point of. (Sharp,
eh?)
Bill happened to be on hand at the
National A.A.U. track meet, and
consequently saw Johnny Fulton
run.
Hornby said that the reason Ful
ton only took fifth place in the quali
fying heat was because he got
bounced on a turn early in the race.
It was lucky that he even qualified.
In the finals, there was just too
much competition, and Hornby
pointed out that Cliff Bourland mere
ly outran the Stanford flash. Al
though the pictures that have been
printed in papers of the race indi
cate that there was quite a distance
between Bourland and the field, in
reality there was only two or three
yards between the first three men.
Bill brought out the fact that the
reason Johnny didn't finish close to
the leaders in the 880 was simply be
cause he didn't finish the race. At
the start of the half-mile, Fulton
took a spill, running second at the
time, and although he regained his
feet and continued for a couple of
laps, the reaction that he acquired
from the fall forced him to drop out.
