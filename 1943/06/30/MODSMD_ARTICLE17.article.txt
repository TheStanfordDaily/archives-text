mural softball league tonight at 7:15.
The games will be the starters for a
| round-robin schedule that will be
{ carried through the Summer Quar-
I ier.
Different from the games of last
quarter, the schedule has been ar
i ranged so that near the completion of
! the regular season, the team that has
; topped the league it is in wins, will
j play the leader of the second divi
sion for the championship.
This means that the number one
team will play the squad that, at the
! completion of the round robin, is in
eighth position in the total standings.
Harry Wolter, director of the pro-
I gram, has announced that due to the
lack of baseball equipment,- the first
seven teams (teams are numbered
from 1 to 14) must sign out equip-

ment in the gym store, and be re
sponsible for same until it is cheeked
in at the end of the season. Each
club must bring its own ball.
The fourteen teams in numerical
order are as follows:
Team I—McKinley; Team 2—
Monroe! Team 3—Hayes; Team 4 —
Tyles; Team s—Cleveland; Team (i
—Fillmore; Team 7—Garfield; Team
B—Gerona8 —Gerona A.C.; Team 9—Boat
House Boys; Team 10—Lincoln;
Team 11—Arthur; Team 12—Bu
chanan; Team 13—Firehouse; Team
14—Coaches' Club.
In the same order, diamonds will
be numbered from one to seven. The
list of these is as follows:
Diamonds No. 1 and 2—lntramural
sottbal lfield located just beyond the
left field fence of the Sunken Dia
mond.
Diamonds No. 3 and 4—Frosh foot
ball field across street from diamonds
and 2.
Diamonds No. 5, 6, and 7—Sunken
Diamond, with 5 in left field, 6 in
center field, and 7 in right field.
At the completion of the games,
the managers of the different teams
must mark on the chart which will
be posted on the bulletin board in
the gym whether their organization
won or lost.
This is necessary so that an ac

j curate tabulation may be kept of
the clubs' standings.
A new entry was made yesterday,
( an organization that calls themselves
the—Coaches' Club. The lineup will
' undoubtedly have numerous of the
younger Stanford coaches represent
-1 ed, whlie the others will stand by
]to form the cheering section. It
