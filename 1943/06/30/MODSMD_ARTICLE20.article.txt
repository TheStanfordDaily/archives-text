### United Press 
The San Francisco Seals today de
feated the Portland Beavers 8 to 2
in the first game of the two-club
series scramble for second place in
the Pacific Coast baseball league.
The Seals had two three-run in
nings, the third and the fifth, in
which George Metkovich's three
bagger drove home two men and he
scored on Hener Steinbacher's long
fiy. Then in the fifth Logan Hooper
doubled. Metkovich, Gussie Suhr,
Del Young, and Willie Enos all
singled to bring in three more tallies.
San Francisco already has a good
grip on the second round of the
league ladder, but the Portlanders,
staging a fast campaign from having
been in last place, were putting up a
hard fight in an attempt to push
closer to the league-leading Angels.
