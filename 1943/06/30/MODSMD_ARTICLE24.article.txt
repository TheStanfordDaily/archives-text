BATTLE seasoned men returning from combat areas where
they have fought and suffered emphasize the new meaning
of religion to them. And today, neat khaki and navy blue covered
Eibles are distributed for use in the armed services.
But this discovery of the added importance of faith and belief
during a war is not new. Nearly three centuries ago, Britain's
Council of State ordered a Bible for each file of British soldiers
at the garrison of Dunkirk. In 1643, a 16-page pamphlet known as
the Soldier's Pocket Bible was published in England for the men
in Cromwell's army. Later, in our Civil War, the New Testament
was printed by the Confederate States for the Southern soldiers.
Later testaments were printed expressly for fighting men to
supply the want of the whole Bible which soldiers could not con
veniently carry. All these represent the deep importance, in
wars of the past 300 years, as well as in World War 11, which has
been placed upon helping the man in the armed forces in his
purpose.
