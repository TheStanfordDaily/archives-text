# The 						Honor Code
## 
### 
TONIGHT student leaders and members of the faculty will lead
a roundtable discussion on the Honor Code and its application
to all phases of University life.
The Honor Code at Stanford has a long enviable history; it
i« an integral, vital part of each student's life at Stanford. As Dr. 1
Wilbur said when he spoke at the all-University assembly last
week, if you meet a Stanford man in the South Pacific, North Af- ]
rica, or Iceland, you know he has lived under the Honor Code,'
and you know what treatment to expect.
These men and women know the true significance of the
Honor Code; that it means a way of life, not just honesty on exes ■
and academic work. The Honor Code and its continuance, as !
we have known it throughout our three years at Stanford, rests
in our hands.
The men who founded the Honor Code here entrusted it to
us, the student body, to uphold; tonight our campus leaders are
asking us to stop and consider just what it does mean to us, its
significance, and the ways in which we may apply it in our
lives. The meeting begins at 7:3o.—Vashti O'Donnell.
