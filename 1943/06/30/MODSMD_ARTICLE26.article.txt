### BILL STRUTHERS 
A friend from home-town is in an unfortunate situation. That
is he was. You see he's one of the newer freshmen who didn't
acquire any brass. So when he wanted to do something like pin
the home-town girl friend, he was out of luck.
Outof luck till he talked it over with me. I'm the big brother
type and I've been around here long enough to find a deal where
formerly theie was no deal.
His girl just graduated from high school. She doesn't know
too much about college. So this guy and I figure out that he
could get the same results, the same reaction, by hanging a Stan
ford pennant on his girl.
A brilliant idea. I'm proud to have a part in it.
He bought a fine pennant at the Bookstore. The 14-inch size.
'White letters saying "STANFORD" on a red background.
He hung it the night of the San Leandro Job's Daughters' In
stallation and Formal Dance. Now this is a big night in home
town. He couldn't miss. Next morning I asked him how he did.
He said, "Ugh," and mumbled so I thought it went over all right.
Later he broke down and gave me the whole story. It seems
he argued about whether she should wear it on her sweater or
hang it on the wall of her room. In fact they had a big fight about
it. "You wear it or else . . . he shouted.
"Or else what?" she asked.
"Or else this is the end," he said. He even confessed that he
made her walk home.
Nov/ this was the first sign of degeneracy that I've noticed in
his family. They're all nice people, ranging from bank presidents
to third assistant vice-presidents of banks. But just to play safe
I sent my friend over to the psych department for an I.Q. test
and a general interview.
I'll let you know how he came out.
