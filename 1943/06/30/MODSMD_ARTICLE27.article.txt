## U.S. Increases Use of Wheat 
### 
"The most important feature of
the wheat situation of the past four
months has been the expansion of
wheat utilization in the United
tSates. For feed and alcohol alone,
the use of wheat in this country will
considerably exceed the world's net
exports of wheat and flour in 1942-
43."
So great has this increase become
that if the present conditions con
tinue," the available wheat supplies
would be virtually exhausted before
the end of the year, and even essen
tial working reserves for the summer
of 1944 would be in jeopardy."
Flour Increase
This was the conclusion drawn by
Helen C Far ns worth, associate
economist in the Food Research In
stitute, V. P. Timoshenko, economist
in the institute, and Meriam A.
Clough, associate economist in the
institute, in the recent issue of the
Wheat Studies on "World Wheat
Survey and Outlook, May 1943."
One of the factors causing the un
precedented wheat disappearance in
the United States has been an in
crease in the flour milling. A part
of the increase is presumably owned
by the military services, "which have
perhaps built up stockpiles abroad
as well as at home." In addition
large supplies remain in private
hands.
Greatest in History
But more spectacular than this has
been the expansion in the utilization
of wheat used for these purposes and
for seed will reach a total about
equal to that of mill grindings for
actual domestic flour consumption.
"In total," tue studies report, "do
mestic wheat utilization (including
building of flour stocks) thus seems
likely to come to over a billion
bushels for the first time in history."
Allocation
So great is this consumption in
crease that "it is entirely conceivable
(though on general principle un
likely) that before the present war
ends that United States may harvest
a wheat crop as small as 550 million
bushels and at the same time face
domestic needs for 800 million bush
els or more."
The War Food Administration
must thus allocate the wheat sup
plies so as to bring about a maximum
of animal products without reducing
wheat stocks below the minimum
level. Too high a goal for stocks will
mean the possible maintenance of an
excessive wheat surplus to be car
ried into the postwar period: ex
cessively low stocks hold the threat
of food shortage in the event of a
poor harvest.
