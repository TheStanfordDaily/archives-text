## Edman Defends War Philosophy 
### 
Defending philosophy as one of the '
essentials both to culture and to the j
peace which we hope to achieve was |
the central idea of Professor Irwin j
Edrnan's speech before the Tuesday j
Evening Series audience last night
in Memorial Hall.
"Too many people," said Professor j
Edman, "are inclined to look on
philosophers as men who pen them- |
selves up in studies, glean the best
from other men's ideas, without ever |
going out to mix with the common |
man." They have grown away from
the natural language and at times
seem to be the representation of j
William James' definition of meta- ;
physics: "A hunt for a black cat at
midnight in a dark room where the |
cat does not happen to be."
Three Charges
Continuing, Professor Edman out- J
lined three general charges which '
have been brought against philoso
phers since the time of Socrates. All j
of these border on suspicions, the ,
first being that philosophy is irrele- j
vant. In answer to this, Erdman )
agreed that many philosophers en- J
gage in self-hypnotic double talk
and discuss such abstract things as j
essence and existence and finally !
arrive at a mumbo-jumbo definition I
of something which is generally !
deemed irrelevant. Therefore, in j
wartime it seems that they should |
have something more pertinent to ;
talk about.
The second charge, that philosophy ;
is impertinent in the literal sense of j
the word was illustrated by the j
parallel of an old lady talking to a
rude, impatient boy. "It seems," !
said Edman, "that philosophy is gen
erally critical of existing systems [
and usually sets up in contrast to
these an ideal which appears as a j
betrayal to the present order.
Work Impractical
In turn, philosophers receive their 1
third criticism, that they are useless !
and impractical and could divert !
their work to more profitable chan- |
nels during the war emergency.
Yet, in spite of his work and all |
the criticism brought against philos
ophy, the speaker agreed that many
of them appeared plausable. His
defense of war philosophy remained,
however, that it must remain as a <
basic pattern toward which we can !
shape and guard the peace to come
out of the war.

their work to more profitable chan- |
nels during the war emergency.
Yet, in spite of his work and all |
the criticism brought against philos
ophy, the speaker agreed that many
of them appeared plausable. His
defense of war philosophy remained,
however, that it must remain as a <
basic pattern toward which we can !
shape and guard the peace to come
out of the war.
Defending philosophy as one of the '
essentials both to culture and to the j
peace which we hope to achieve was |
the central idea of Professor Irwin j
Edrnan's speech before the Tuesday j
Evening Series audience last night
in Memorial Hall.
"Too many people," said Professor j
Edman, "are inclined to look on
philosophers as men who pen them- |
selves up in studies, glean the best
from other men's ideas, without ever |
going out to mix with the common |
man." They have grown away from
the natural language and at times
seem to be the representation of j
William James' definition of meta- ;
physics: "A hunt for a black cat at
midnight in a dark room where the |
cat does not happen to be."
Three Charges
Continuing, Professor Edman out- J
lined three general charges which '
have been brought against philoso
phers since the time of Socrates. All j
of these border on suspicions, the ,
first being that philosophy is irrele- j
vant. In answer to this, Erdman )
agreed that many philosophers en- J
gage in self-hypnotic double talk
and discuss such abstract things as j
essence and existence and finally !
arrive at a mumbo-jumbo definition I
of something which is generally !
deemed irrelevant. Therefore, in j
wartime it seems that they should |
have something more pertinent to ;
talk about.
The second charge, that philosophy ;
is impertinent in the literal sense of j
the word was illustrated by the j
parallel of an old lady talking to a
rude, impatient boy. "It seems," !
said Edman, "that philosophy is gen
erally critical of existing systems [
and usually sets up in contrast to
these an ideal which appears as a j
betrayal to the present order.
Work Impractical
In turn, philosophers receive their 1
third criticism, that they are useless !
and impractical and could divert !
their work to more profitable chan- |
nels during the war emergency.
