About GO interested Stanford
women spent two hours in the Wom
en's Clubhouse last night discussing
the Honor Code, and alter many
suggestions and questions from the
Hoor following a preliminary dis
cussion of the panel, left the club
house with the firm opinion that at
all costs the 22-year-old Stanford
Honor Code would be preserved.
Discussions, objections, and sug
gestions are all worth many lines of
print, but in the whole, this is a re

« v' of lp.oi night's proceedings:
tattling. There is a difference
between this and reporting a viola
tion, and only education can point
out this difference.
2. Honor Code Clarification. It was
suggested that there be a booklet on
the Honor Code sent to students be
fore entrance into the University.
15. Constructive Penalties. There
should be penalties, but they should
be of a helpful nature, rather than of
a purely reprimanding type.

4. Method of Reporting Violations.
First, person suspected is spoken to.
Then, if shef ails to turn herself in,
the third party is responsible.
5. Failure of Faculty Responsi
bility. Professors should show abso
lute trust toward students.
(Because of lack of time and space,
a detailed report of the Honor Code
meeting is not possible in today's
Daily. However, tomorrow's paper
will carry a complete report, illus
trating and clarifying today's article,
and adding other points discussed.)
