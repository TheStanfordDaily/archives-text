# DRAMA
## Players Open Season July 14 
### 
The Stanford Players will present
'"Squaring the Circle" in the Little
Theater July 14 to 17.
It took over six months to decide
on the play to be the first Summer
Quarter show, according to F.
Cowles Strickland, acting head of
drama at Stanford, but rehearsals
are now well under way.
"For a long while we have wanted
to do a play of our Russian allies,
Mr. Strickland said, "but the play
wrights of old Russia wrote about
gloomy, soul-searching, frustrated
individuals; while most of the Soviet
dramatists write obvious propaganda.
Avoids Pitfalls
"Plays of both eras seem to trans
late poorly into English, and in
variably call for a prohibitive num
ber of male actors. "Squaring the
Circle" avoids all these pitfalls, and
in addition is good comedy in any
language."
The author of the play, Valentine
Katten, is known for his satiric
novels, especially "The Embezzlers,"
a Book of the Month choice in this
country. "Squaring the Circle" was
successful in Russia where it was ac
cepted as good-natured self-criti
cism.
On Five-Year Plan
Instead of the usual "triangle"
formula, Katten involves four young
Russians in a series of farcical situa
tions rising out of the "five-year
plan," the housing shortage, and
Soviet marriage and divorce ethics.
Director David Sievers is com
bining three different translations
for the Stanford version in order to
produce a fluent acting script.
The cast for the play includes
David Regenery as Vasya, Sally
Stocker as Ludmilla, Peggy Fitts as
Tonya, Roger Brander as Abram,
Tom Flynn as Emilian, and Jean
Levinson as Rabinovitch.
The players will give their second
presentation for the summer in Au
gust in the Little Theater.
