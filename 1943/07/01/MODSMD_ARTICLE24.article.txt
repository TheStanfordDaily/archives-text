### BY LATE WILLIAMS Late (Shakespeare) Williams 
SCENE: Seal Stadium.
CHARACTERS: Don (Get Home
stead Bread Instead) Langendorf, 1
Aclolph (Barney) Gugel, and Late
(Teeps) Williams.
SITUATION: Fifth inning of the
Seal - Los Angeles series. (Any
;;pries.)
Don:. Hi Late.
Late: Hi Don.
Barney: Hi fellows.
Late and Don: Hi Barney.
Late: Too bad that we had to" miss
the first four innings.
Don: Well. I told you that the
local didn't go direct to the Stadium.
Barney: Well, can't win 'em all.
Don: I wish somebody would tell
O'Doul that.
Late: Nobody has to tell O'Doul.
Barney: Say men, what's the score
anyway?
Don: Nine to one in favor of the
Sassy Ones.
Late: Epperly's on the mound.
Barney: Who is this guy coming to
bat, Don?
Don: Why that's George Metko
vich. Can't hit his hat anymore.
Late: Yea, only batting .400 or '
something. It must be tough to be
in such a slump.
Barney: Well, the bases are loaded.
Now we'll see just how the guy can [
hit.
Late: You better pass that all-day
sucker over this way, Barney. That's
the first base coach, the third base
coach, and the Angel second base
man on the bags. Metkovich is the
(irst batter.
Don: Well, here comes the first
pitch. Oops, what happened? No. 1
No. Metky couldn't have hit it to
the wall. The guy that just hit must
be an imposter.
Barney: Oh. Donny boy? I thought
you said the guy couldn't last the
season. That's only four for four
today.
Don: I must have been thinking
of "Homer" Meatkovitch, the Pil
ber City slugger. What a ringer.
Late: Speaking of ringers, what
inning is it now, Don?
Don: First half of the seventh, San
Francisco leading nine to eight.
Barney: Do you notice how the
stands cleared at the end of the last
inning? Even the Mayor got his
stuff and cleared out.
Late: That's because they can't
bear watching Epperly go through
this inning. Some of them stick J
around just to hear "Win" Balou's :
arm creak in the bull pen.
Barney: We've been sitting here I
for a half-hour now since the seventh I
was supposed to have started. What's
the score?
Don (through a maze of tears):
They've done it again. L.A. has
scored 13 more runs, and there's
still none away. I can't stand it.
Let's blow.
Late: Might as well, even O'Doul
has gone home.
SO THEY BLEW!—CURTAIN.

Don: I must have been thinking
of "Homer" Meatkovitch, the Pil
ber City slugger. What a ringer.
Late: Speaking of ringers, what
inning is it now, Don?
Don: First half of the seventh, San
Francisco leading nine to eight.
Barney: Do you notice how the
stands cleared at the end of the last
inning? Even the Mayor got his
stuff and cleared out.
Late: That's because they can't
bear watching Epperly go through
this inning. Some of them stick J
around just to hear "Win" Balou's :
arm creak in the bull pen.
Barney: We've been sitting here I
for a half-hour now since the seventh I
was supposed to have started. What's
the score?
Don (through a maze of tears):
They've done it again. L.A. has
scored 13 more runs, and there's
still none away. I can't stand it.
Let's blow.
Late: Might as well, even O'Doul
has gone home.
SO THEY BLEW!—CURTAIN.
SCENE: Seal Stadium.
CHARACTERS: Don (Get Home
stead Bread Instead) Langendorf, 1
Aclolph (Barney) Gugel, and Late
(Teeps) Williams.
SITUATION: Fifth inning of the
Seal - Los Angeles series. (Any
;;pries.)
Don:. Hi Late.
Late: Hi Don.
Barney: Hi fellows.
Late and Don: Hi Barney.
Late: Too bad that we had to" miss
the first four innings.
Don: Well. I told you that the
local didn't go direct to the Stadium.
Barney: Well, can't win 'em all.
Don: I wish somebody would tell
O'Doul that.
Late: Nobody has to tell O'Doul.
Barney: Say men, what's the score
anyway?
Don: Nine to one in favor of the
Sassy Ones.
Late: Epperly's on the mound.
Barney: Who is this guy coming to
bat, Don?
Don: Why that's George Metko
vich. Can't hit his hat anymore.
Late: Yea, only batting .400 or '
something. It must be tough to be
in such a slump.
Barney: Well, the bases are loaded.
Now we'll see just how the guy can [
hit.
Late: You better pass that all-day
sucker over this way, Barney. That's
the first base coach, the third base
coach, and the Angel second base
man on the bags. Metkovich is the
(irst batter.
Don: Well, here comes the first
pitch. Oops, what happened? No. 1
No. Metky couldn't have hit it to
the wall. The guy that just hit must
be an imposter.
Barney: Oh. Donny boy? I thought
you said the guy couldn't last the
season. That's only four for four
today.
Don: I must have been thinking
of "Homer" Meatkovitch, the Pil
ber City slugger. What a ringer.
