# The Cellar Call
## 
### 
THE sign posted on the gate of the Cellar entrance which says
Closed—Labor doesn't appear there so often this quarter. A
rail issued last quarter lor more student help was answered by
a few students. They decided that it would be worthwhile to
spend a few hours a week helping out.
However, for every student who actually applied for work,
there were probably ten others who thought about helping and
did nothing about it.
The hours when the Cellar is closed during the day now are
between two and four. Surely some of those students who drop
by for their usual afternoon coke, read the sign, and saunter off
again could profitably spend an hour working.
Working in the Cellar may not be furthering a great cause,
but it does help to revive the normal life of the University.—Jane
