# Staff Revival
## 
### 
JK N old-fashioned revival will be in order today when members
,/l of the Daily editorial staff drop in at 2 p.m. for their weekly
meeting. Freshly painted walls of a lush Nile green will greet
the staff, although the grut board remains intact. The grand old
custom of afternoon club will be revived by the editor. It is vital
that every member be on hand.
