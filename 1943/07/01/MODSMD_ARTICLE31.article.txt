### BILL STRUTHERS 
My name is George Ambrose, private first class. I'm here at
Stanford with the ASTP. At least that's what the Army record
says, so I guess I am. It's not what I thought Stanford would be
like, but I'm sure glad to be here.
You can't imagine what six months of taking running dives at
barbed wire entanglements with a gas mask and 60 pounds of
equipment is like. At Camp Roberts it's either muddy, or swelter
ing and dry. There's nothing down there.
That's why I'm glad to be here. Just looking at all these women
is a pleasure. I'm sure it'll take me a couple of months to get used
to them. It'll probably take me six months to meet one, and a year
before I really know her well.
I'm not griping. You hear some of the men moan about how
stuckup these Stanford women are. I expect them to be that way.
They've got a reason to be exclusive. I guess. Besides a lot of
guys use that for an excuse to save their own ego. Those blind
dates don't always turn out too well.
One thing about us. When Dr. Wilbur said that we were just
as much Stanford students as the men and women who used to
figure up the ratio, we weren't too impressed. We don't expect to
be accepted 100 per cent. We're back to college in uniform, and
we've got to study. Things aren't the same as they were before
we were drafted, and we don't expect them to be.
Like Colonel Allen says, we are Stanford men with all hte privi
leges and responsibilities that Stanford men have. But before that
we're United States soldiers under military jurisdiction. We don't
mind if these two roles conflict occasionally.
A few dances, a little of your social life, the Church, the
Cellar, the Campus, the feeling of being among people again . . .
that's almost enough. But for gosh sake, don't feel sorry for us.
We're at Stanford.
