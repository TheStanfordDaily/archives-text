### United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS. Australia, Friday, July 2â€”Specially trained
United States combat troops consolidated their position today on a huge
700-mile offensive line stretching from New Guinea Trobrienda and Wood
lark Islands to Rendova in the Solomons.
The southwest and south Pacific forces, under the supreme command of

General Douglas Mac-Arthur and
with Admiral William F. Halsey Jr.
directing the Rendova attack, struck
swiftly and efficiently in a perfectly
timed combined operation plan
which involved the United States
infantry and Marines, United States
Navy units, and the United States
and Australian air forces.
By a move, long in preparation,
which obviously caught the Japanese
by surprise, Mac Arthur, using his
first combined forces operation had
moved the United Nations offensive
line menacingly closer to the remain
ing Japanese bases in the south and
southwest Pacific zone.
