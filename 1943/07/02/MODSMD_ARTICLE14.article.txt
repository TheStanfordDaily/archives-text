A sum of $1,000 in the Doris Clayburgh Steiner fellowship in advanced
English will be reserved for service men who return to Stanford after the
war to finish their education, Chancellor Ray Lymon Wilbur announced

l lished in 1940 as a memorial to their
| daughter, Doris Clayburgh Steiner,
who graduated from Stanford with
! the class of 1937.
She died in July 1939, at the age of
21. Since then her parents have
given $1,000 each year on her birth- j
