# Dance Routine Makes Cadet A â€˜Casualty'
## 
### Pfc. Richard Dale 
Number one on S.T.U. Co. F.'s
casualty list this week is Pfc. Robert
Lauder who is suffering from a
sprained ankle .It seems that Cadet
Lauder tried one twirl too many
while rehearsing an intricate dance
routine in which he and Pfc. Glen
Thompson are to be featured at the
A.S.T.P. dance scheduled for July 10.
Pfc. Lauder sincerely hopes that
the other fellows appreciate his sac
rifice, especially since he isn't going
to be awarded the Purple Heart for
his efforts. He believes, however,
that the injured limb will be suffi
ciently healed by July 10.
Another highlight of the evening's
entertainment arises from the fact
that Co.'s E and F have each pro
duced an A.S.T.P. song. Co. E's is ?>
tricky ballad in a solid four, written
by T/5 Carl Frutkoff and Pfc. Rus
sell Beierman; the other a snappy 6-8
number by Pfc. Richard Dale and
Pfc. Clay Orvis of Co. F. A quartet
from each company will sing its song,
and the audience will decide which
one is to become the official song of
the Stanford S.T.U.
