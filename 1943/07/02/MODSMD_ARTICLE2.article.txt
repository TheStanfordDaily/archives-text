WASHINGTON — American in- I
vasion forces, making "satisfactory |
progress" in their prolonged south- j
west Pacific offensive, destroyed 65
Jap planes and seized Viru Harbor !
at a cost of one empty troop transport
and 17 planes during the opening 1
round of the central Solomons phase
of the big push, it was disclosed to
day.
The Navy revealed in a com- j
munique that both the enemy and j
U.S. losses were suffered in a bril- i
liant air battle in which 110 Japanese j
planes of all types unsuccessfully at- j
tempted to thwart Tuesday morning's
landing on Rendova Island—five
miles from the important Jap air
base at Munda on New Georgia Is
land.
The 7.712-ton U.S. transport, Mc-
Cawley, formerly the Grace liner j
Santa Barbara, was crippled by tor- |
pedo bombers after landing troops j
on Rendova and later was sunk by a
Jap submarine. The Navy said re
oorts indicate there was no loss of i
life.
Secretary of War Henry Stimpson
reported the American drive in the j
southwest Pacific appears to be 1
making satisfactory progress and j
proceeding according to plan.
