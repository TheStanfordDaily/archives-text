## MURAL SOFTBALL Unknown Coaches' Club Highlights Mural Return 
### 
Mural softball returns to the cam
put tonight at 7:15 after a brief leave
of absence. After the first set of
games, the powerhouse team seems
to be the Boat House Boys with
"Smoke" Morrison on the mound.
The Coaches' Club still remains an
unknown quantity, both in regard to
who plays on the team and how
good they are. It should be no secret
after tonight, for it is then that they
play their first game.
Umpires are still needed badly.
Anybody with two eyes and two feet
is eligible to arbitrate. Several of
the games Wednesday night were
played without any officiating what
soever. How about lending a hand?
