# LATE TIPS
## 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS Don Langendorf 
After losing a mound duel to the
Firehouse, Late Williams, your sports
editor, decided to rest his pitching
arm for today's game, so he thought
he had better not pound a typewriter
until the end of the battle. Let's
hope he wins a game.
All PCL Team
Since I wrote my last column for
the Daily, I have received many com
plaints in regard to my few choice
words about George Metkovieh and
Andy Pafko. I will admit my mis
take concerning Pafko, but I still

believe that Met. is just a Mash in
the pan. His hitting against Los An
geles while under pressure sort of
bares me out.
Here and now. I would like to pre
sent to you, my dear pets, this col
umn's all-Coast League team of the
year 1943. Be sure to hang it up for
posterity. If you don't like it, please
don't hang me instead.
The entire Los Angeles team out
side of Searsella of Oakland at first.
Dickshot of Hollywood in left field,
and Billy Raimondi of Oakland at
catcher makes up the magnificent
outfit. Everybody on the Angels is
of major league caliber today, even
the ones I didn't mention. My opin
ion is that there is one thing missing,
a good catcher. That is what the
league is missing this season. Rai
mondi is the best of a none too good ;
lot.
Now you can begin to fire away.
