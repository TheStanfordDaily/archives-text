# SEALS WIN 3 STRAIGHT
## 
### 
The San Francisco Seals pulled
another game out of the fire yester
day to make it three in a row over
the un-Lucky Beavers of Portland.
Behind three to two going into the
last half of the ninth inning, Gussie
Suhr opened the stanza none too well
by being an easy out.
