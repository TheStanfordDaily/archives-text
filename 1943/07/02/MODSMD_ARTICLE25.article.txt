# Honor Code Discussion

PAT THURESSON, Roble president and
chairman for the evening, opened the Honor
Code meeting upstairs in the Women's Club
house and asked everyone to go downstairs;
there were too few persons present to half fill
the auditorium. But after the meeting was
well under way, it seemed as though there
were too many present —there were more gues
tions and ideas put on the floor than could be
reckoned with.
Janet McClanahan, Student Body president,
spoke for the student body as a whole and
started her talk by describing the amazement
with which students of other universities viewed
the Honor System at Stanford.
She pointed out that women's council deals
with the social as well as the academic phase
of the Honor Code, whereas men's council is
concerned only with the academic application,
causing men to think of women's social rules
as pertaining only to house regulations and
not to the Honor System.
Neva Haight told of her experience at a uni
versity where professors patrolled the aisles
during tests and where the lights were blinked
in the living rooms five minutes before men
visitors were to leave. If visitors didn't leave,
they were ushered to the door.
Almost everyone went on "sneak dates"
after the living group monitors had checked
their hall each night to report to the matron in
charge that every girl was in. In Miss Haight's
words, "everyone took a childish delight in
doing anything that was wrong."
Margaret lameson presented a different pic
ture when she related her experiences at Skid
more, a college with an effective honor system.
The main feature of the Skidmore honor sys
tem is this: Upon application for admittance,
students are sent a booklet, ' 'Honor Code,"
which explains and interprets the system. Be
fore any student is admitted she has to write
an essay on the system and its meaning to her.
The third person responsibility (that of re
porting someone else's violation) is successful.
First, the accused person is asked to report
herself. Then, if she refuses, she is reported.
Members of a standing Honor Board, com
posed of students, faculty, and administration,
is the judicial body. Penalties are constructive
and include not only probation but also help
in adjusting and edcuating the offender to the
school society and the honor system.
She told of an incident in which two students
were accused of cheating because their test
papers were almost identical. Both denied the
charge. Conseguently, the entire class agreed
to take the test over; the tests of the two girls
were again identical, even though the girls
had been at opposite sides of the room.
Georgiana Fitzgerald, chairman of Women's
Council, began her talk by giving statistics: In
the three year period between 1938 and 1940,
Council handled eight academic violations and
30 social violations. During Spring Quarter
this year, one academic case and 15 social vio
lations were handled.
She explained that most of the violations
were reported by chance, and that the success
of the Honor Code was being questioned be

cause of the failure of the third person respon
sibility.
A member of the audience stated that the
difference for reporting a violation and tattling
was not made clear to new students.
Someone pointed out that students hesitate
in adopting a third person responsibility be
cause there is a stigma attached to being ac
cused, and an accused person, if guilty, is not
helped by the penalties imposed by Council.
Miss Fitzgerald pointed out that after a girl
is penalized by Council for an Honor Code vio
lation, she is considered as clear as any other
Stanford woman.
In regard to penalties, it was pointed out
that Council does not have enough time to
consider Honor Code violations because there
! are too many cases of simple violations such
as lockouts. Miss Fitzgerald said that Council
: was anxious to have suggestions regarding
: more constructive penalties.
One objection to the Honor Code raised
from the floor was that it is no different from
a proctoring system.
But it was generally agreed by those present
that in any society there must be some such
system and that the Honor Code is far superior
to the system presented by Miss Haight. Miss
Fitzgerald pointed out that when 1,700 students
petitioned to the administration for the Honor
: Code, they agreed to third person responsibility.
Besides eliminating the tattler complex, is
suing constructive penalties, and gaining fac
ulty cooperation, the following suggestions
were made:
1. Smaller committees, like the Lagunita
committee of seven, could handle matters con
i cerning technicals and lockouts, allowing Coun
cil more time in which to handle the Honor
Code.
2. Revise the Honor Code into a clearer state
ment, incorporating in it the method of first
speaking to the person accused before taking
the matter to Council.
3. Send to entering freshmen an Honor Code
! booklet.
j 4. Do away with the pledge signed in reg
i booklets, it loses its significance among so
j many other things.
5. Divide the Code into two parts: A pledge
of personal honor, and a pledge of honor to
your friends and to the group.
The final statement came from the floor and
it was generally agreed the matter should be
handled entirely by the students. And in an-
I swer to chairman Thuresson's guestion, "Do
you feel the Honor Code should be abolished
for some other system-" there was a unanimous
ly voiced "NO!"

the auditorium. But after the meeting was
well under way, it seemed as though there
were too many present —there were more gues
tions and ideas put on the floor than could be
reckoned with.
Janet McClanahan, Student Body president,
spoke for the student body as a whole and
started her talk by describing the amazement
with which students of other universities viewed
the Honor System at Stanford.
She pointed out that women's council deals
with the social as well as the academic phase
of the Honor Code, whereas men's council is
concerned only with the academic application,
causing men to think of women's social rules
as pertaining only to house regulations and
not to the Honor System.
Neva Haight told of her experience at a uni
versity where professors patrolled the aisles
during tests and where the lights were blinked
in the living rooms five minutes before men
visitors were to leave. If visitors didn't leave,
they were ushered to the door.
Almost everyone went on "sneak dates"
after the living group monitors had checked
their hall each night to report to the matron in
charge that every girl was in. In Miss Haight's
words, "everyone took a childish delight in
doing anything that was wrong."
Margaret lameson presented a different pic
ture when she related her experiences at Skid
more, a college with an effective honor system.
The main feature of the Skidmore honor sys
tem is this: Upon application for admittance,
students are sent a booklet, ' 'Honor Code,"
which explains and interprets the system. Be
fore any student is admitted she has to write
an essay on the system and its meaning to her.
The third person responsibility (that of re
porting someone else's violation) is successful.
First, the accused person is asked to report
herself. Then, if she refuses, she is reported.
Members of a standing Honor Board, com
posed of students, faculty, and administration,
is the judicial body. Penalties are constructive
and include not only probation but also help
in adjusting and edcuating the offender to the
school society and the honor system.
She told of an incident in which two students
were accused of cheating because their test
papers were almost identical. Both denied the
charge. Conseguently, the entire class agreed
to take the test over; the tests of the two girls
were again identical, even though the girls
had been at opposite sides of the room.
Georgiana Fitzgerald, chairman of Women's
Council, began her talk by giving statistics: In
the three year period between 1938 and 1940,
Council handled eight academic violations and
30 social violations. During Spring Quarter
this year, one academic case and 15 social vio
lations were handled.
She explained that most of the violations
were reported by chance, and that the success
of the Honor Code was being questioned be

cause of the failure of the third person respon
sibility.
A member of the audience stated that the
difference for reporting a violation and tattling
was not made clear to new students.
Someone pointed out that students hesitate
in adopting a third person responsibility be
cause there is a stigma attached to being ac
cused, and an accused person, if guilty, is not
helped by the penalties imposed by Council.
Miss Fitzgerald pointed out that after a girl
is penalized by Council for an Honor Code vio
lation, she is considered as clear as any other
Stanford woman.
In regard to penalties, it was pointed out
that Council does not have enough time to
consider Honor Code violations because there
! are too many cases of simple violations such
as lockouts. Miss Fitzgerald said that Council
: was anxious to have suggestions regarding
: more constructive penalties.
One objection to the Honor Code raised
from the floor was that it is no different from
a proctoring system.
But it was generally agreed by those present
that in any society there must be some such
system and that the Honor Code is far superior
to the system presented by Miss Haight. Miss
Fitzgerald pointed out that when 1,700 students
petitioned to the administration for the Honor
: Code, they agreed to third person responsibility.
Besides eliminating the tattler complex, is
suing constructive penalties, and gaining fac
ulty cooperation, the following suggestions
were made:
1. Smaller committees, like the Lagunita
committee of seven, could handle matters con
i cerning technicals and lockouts, allowing Coun
cil more time in which to handle the Honor
Code.
2. Revise the Honor Code into a clearer state
ment, incorporating in it the method of first
speaking to the person accused before taking
the matter to Council.
3. Send to entering freshmen an Honor Code
! booklet.
j 4. Do away with the pledge signed in reg
i booklets, it loses its significance among so
j many other things.
5. Divide the Code into two parts: A pledge
of personal honor, and a pledge of honor to
your friends and to the group.
The final statement came from the floor and
it was generally agreed the matter should be
handled entirely by the students. And in an-
I swer to chairman Thuresson's guestion, "Do
you feel the Honor Code should be abolished
for some other system-" there was a unanimous
ly voiced "NO!"
PAT THURESSON, Roble president and

Janet McClanahan, Student Body president,
spoke for the student body as a whole and
started her talk by describing the amazement
with which students of other universities viewed
the Honor System at Stanford.
She pointed out that women's council deals
with the social as well as the academic phase
of the Honor Code, whereas men's council is
concerned only with the academic application,
causing men to think of women's social rules
as pertaining only to house regulations and
not to the Honor System.
Neva Haight told of her experience at a uni
versity where professors patrolled the aisles
during tests and where the lights were blinked
in the living rooms five minutes before men
visitors were to leave. If visitors didn't leave,
they were ushered to the door.
Almost everyone went on "sneak dates"
after the living group monitors had checked
their hall each night to report to the matron in
charge that every girl was in. In Miss Haight's
words, "everyone took a childish delight in
doing anything that was wrong."
Margaret lameson presented a different pic
ture when she related her experiences at Skid
more, a college with an effective honor system.
The main feature of the Skidmore honor sys
tem is this: Upon application for admittance,
students are sent a booklet, ' 'Honor Code,"
which explains and interprets the system. Be
fore any student is admitted she has to write
an essay on the system and its meaning to her.
The third person responsibility (that of re
porting someone else's violation) is successful.
First, the accused person is asked to report
herself. Then, if she refuses, she is reported.
Members of a standing Honor Board, com
posed of students, faculty, and administration,
is the judicial body. Penalties are constructive
and include not only probation but also help
in adjusting and edcuating the offender to the
school society and the honor system.
She told of an incident in which two students
were accused of cheating because their test
papers were almost identical. Both denied the
charge. Conseguently, the entire class agreed
to take the test over; the tests of the two girls
were again identical, even though the girls
had been at opposite sides of the room.
Georgiana Fitzgerald, chairman of Women's
Council, began her talk by giving statistics: In
the three year period between 1938 and 1940,
Council handled eight academic violations and
30 social violations. During Spring Quarter
this year, one academic case and 15 social vio
lations were handled.
She explained that most of the violations
were reported by chance, and that the success
of the Honor Code was being questioned be

cause of the failure of the third person respon
sibility.
A member of the audience stated that the
difference for reporting a violation and tattling
was not made clear to new students.
Someone pointed out that students hesitate
in adopting a third person responsibility be
cause there is a stigma attached to being ac
cused, and an accused person, if guilty, is not
helped by the penalties imposed by Council.
Miss Fitzgerald pointed out that after a girl
is penalized by Council for an Honor Code vio
lation, she is considered as clear as any other
Stanford woman.
In regard to penalties, it was pointed out
that Council does not have enough time to
consider Honor Code violations because there
! are too many cases of simple violations such
as lockouts. Miss Fitzgerald said that Council
: was anxious to have suggestions regarding
: more constructive penalties.
One objection to the Honor Code raised
from the floor was that it is no different from
a proctoring system.
But it was generally agreed by those present
that in any society there must be some such
system and that the Honor Code is far superior
to the system presented by Miss Haight. Miss
Fitzgerald pointed out that when 1,700 students
petitioned to the administration for the Honor
: Code, they agreed to third person responsibility.
Besides eliminating the tattler complex, is
suing constructive penalties, and gaining fac
ulty cooperation, the following suggestions
were made:
1. Smaller committees, like the Lagunita
committee of seven, could handle matters con
i cerning technicals and lockouts, allowing Coun
cil more time in which to handle the Honor
Code.
2. Revise the Honor Code into a clearer state
ment, incorporating in it the method of first
speaking to the person accused before taking
the matter to Council.
3. Send to entering freshmen an Honor Code
! booklet.
j 4. Do away with the pledge signed in reg
i booklets, it loses its significance among so
j many other things.
5. Divide the Code into two parts: A pledge
of personal honor, and a pledge of honor to
your friends and to the group.
The final statement came from the floor and
it was generally agreed the matter should be
handled entirely by the students. And in an-
I swer to chairman Thuresson's guestion, "Do
you feel the Honor Code should be abolished
for some other system-" there was a unanimous
ly voiced "NO!"
PAT THURESSON, Roble president and
chairman for the evening, opened the Honor
Code meeting upstairs in the Women's Club
house and asked everyone to go downstairs;
there were too few persons present to half fill
the auditorium. But after the meeting was
well under way, it seemed as though there
were too many present —there were more gues
tions and ideas put on the floor than could be
reckoned with.
