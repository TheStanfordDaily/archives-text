Things that make a Bull Session . . .
The crossword puzzles I've found in the Sal
vation Army's magazine, War Cry. Solve it
and read every other line -across. "Then shall
the righteous shine forth as the sun in the I
Kingdom of their Father," last week. "Selfish- '
ness never answered a doubt or dried a tear," ;
the week before.
Plus: The girl who asked Dean Mary Yost
for the stationery concession at the Libe. Seems
so many soldiers spend their libe hours writ- i
ing letters that this girl wanted to handle the
concession much like night clubs sell cigarettes.
A pretty girl in shorts going from table to table
. . . "Stationery . . . stationery?"
Add people: The girl who wore a notebook
around her neck—she had lots of ideas, but
forgot them if she didn't write them down. The |
bewildered Man-About-Quad —he was a cal- !
loused senior who found himself stimulated by
Prof. Treat's history of the Far East course. The
Boathouse Boy who felt bad four aspirins ago.
The professor with a personality like a pay
phone booth—dark, sguare, cold, and business
like. The freshman who thought the Food Re
search Institute tested ovens. The Robleite who
learned to say "NO" at Pasadena J. C.
That's Bull Session. .
