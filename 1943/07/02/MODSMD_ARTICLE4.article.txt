# TUES. SERIES
## Sea-Life Movie To Be Shown 
### 
"Secrets of the Tide Pools," a
colored motion picture, will be pre
sented on the Tuesday Evening Se
ries program by Alice H. Robertson
next Tuesday at 8 p.m. in the Audi
torium of the Memorial Hall, it was
announced by the Committee on
Public Exercises.
Filmed in natural color, "Secrets
of the Tide Pools" is a motion pic
ture of the animal life of the sea
shore, particularly around the Mon
terey peninsula. The picture was
taken by Dr. J. W. Robertson, who
spent over two years photographing
the marine creatures in their nat
ural habitat, using telescopic lenses
in most instances.
Dr. Robertson, who was formerly
staff physician at the Livermore
Sanitarium, is now in North Africa.
Mrs. Robertson, who is presenting
the film in her husband's absence,
will give the commentary. She ac
companied Dr. Robertson and as
sisted him on his photographic ex
peditions.
While the picture is authentic and
completely accurate, it is not tech
nical, and one need not be a scien
tist, biologist, or marine hobbyist to
understand and enjoy it, according to
the Committee on Public Exercises.
