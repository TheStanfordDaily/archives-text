# University Plans 12-Week Sessions
## 
### 
Stanford University today an
nounced its 1943-44 calendar to syn
chronize with the four-term calen
dar of the Army Student Training
, Program.
This changes the opening of the
Autumn Quarter from Sept. 27 to
Oct. 11 and the first day of the usual
Christmas recess from Dec. 18 to Jan.
1. The new calendar will require
civilian students to study through
the Christmas period and postpone
their Christmas visit home until the
first week in January.
The change also has the effect o.
moving commencement exercise
from June 11 to July 2.
Probable Enrollment
When Autumn Quarter opens nex
Oct. 11, Stanford will probably havt
5.000 students of whom about 3,00
will be in Army training programs.
Of the 2,000 civilian students, aboir
1,300, the usual number, will be
women.
According to the registrar, the 700
I civilian men students will include
entering freshmen below 18 years of
J age, older students of engineering
| and medicine, who are deferred from
I selective service to complete their
| education, some men in the 4-F clas
; sification, and a few who have been
, discharged from the services for
physical reasons.
| No Football
This will probably mean an Au
tumn Quarter without intercollegiate
: football since the Army does not per
mit its soldier students to engage it:
intercollegiate sports and the 16-
and 17-year-old civilian students are
regarded as too young to compete
I against mature men in the service
schools that permit participation in
intercollegiate sports.
Since the Army is using all of
Stanford's men's dormitories, civilian
students will be housed in the 20
available fraternity houses. These
houses, now leased to the University,
can accommodate from 100 to 200
more men than have so far applied
for admission.
