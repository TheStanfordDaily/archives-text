# Undersea Life Described In Tuesday Series Film
## 
### 
Describing her motion pictures on
â– undersea life as an '"outgrowth of a
hobby," Mrs. Alice H. Robertson
opened the Tuesday Evening Series
last night. The subject of her talk
was "Secrets of the Tide Pools,"
which was accompanied by two
kodachrome reels taken of the sea
animals around the Monterey Penin
sula.
The films, which were made re
cently by Mrs. Robertson and her
husband, Dr. J. W. Robertson, were
taken with telephoto lenses which
showed in gigantic sizes the various
starfish, sea urchins, anenome, and
rock life to be found around Point
Lobos on the Carmel coast.
Mrs. Robertson became interested
m the study through a course at the
Hopkins Marine Station in Monterey,
and rapidly discovered that rubber
boots, glass jars and a pail were as
important as lectures and slides. So
began the extensive study which was
captured in kodachrome.
"Sea life," said Mrs. Robertson,
"is so densely populated that on one
.square* yard of scraped rock, a stu
dent discovered 6,000 small animals."
"Work," said Mrs. Robertson,
' usually began at 4 or 5 or even as
late as 6 in the morning when the
tide was out and specimens avail-

I able." Alter a morning's work of
I gathering material in the tide pools,
Mrs. Robertson and her husband
took the animals to their home lab
oratory where they were examined
and photographed, and then returned
to the pools in accordance with the
I marine conservation program.
