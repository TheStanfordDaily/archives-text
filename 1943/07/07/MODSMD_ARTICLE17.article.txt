## 'Coney Island' Draws Praise From Critic 
### 
CONEY ISLAND — Now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Starring Betty Grable, George
Montgomery, Caesar Romero, and
Charles Winninger, "Coney Island"
is probably one of the better musical
comedies of the year.
Besides being a fine musical, it
precents'a picture of the days of the
derby and the bustle in brilliant
technicolor, sometimes a bity gaudy,
however.
The songs and the dance routines
are good as is the fine supporting
acting of comedian Sid Silvers, who
with Charlie Winninger, helps keep
the show moving.
It is unfortunate that "Coney Is
land" is put on a double bill with a
second rate, picture like "They Came
to Blow Up America," which fea
tures Nazi spies, U-boats, and Ger
man officials trying to match wits
with a lone FBI man.—Gugel
