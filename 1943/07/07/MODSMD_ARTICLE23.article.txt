Intramural Softball is a great sport.
Anything can happen, and it usually
does.
Takes the Hayes vs. Coaches' Club
game of last Friday for instance, and
you see what we mean.
Hayes, after scouring the campus
for eligible players—in fact what
they were really after was a few pro
fessional sluggers, went into the
fourth inning behind by a close 4-3
count.
The first batter for the coaches
popped out, and then it happened.
The coaches began parting pitcher
Dun Langendorf's hair with line
drives, and when the dust had lifted,
the athletic profs had gained 10
runs. Final result, Hayes, 4; Coaches'
Club. 36. A pitcher's battle all the
way.
In the same order. Monroe and
McKinley fought until darkness to
a 11-8 or 12-8 decision in favor of
the latter group.
Now we hate to come right out and
say that the ehucker for Monroe was
wild, but after the first three innings
when he had given up about 15 free
passes to first base, the McKinley
batters didn't even bother to bring
their bats to the plate.
L.A. Folds?
It could be that the Los Angeles
Angels are heading into another el
foldo routine —a practice that through
the years has been their custom.
We remember that last year the
Angel City boys were heading for
the league title .and all they needed
to do was take one measly game
from Sacramento to sew up the title.
They lost seven straight.
Again, a few seasons ago, the Se
raphs clubbed their way to some
thing like a 19-game lead before the
other teams in the league got out of
their dugouts. Once again they col
lapsed.
This season, the Angels looked like
they were out for blood when they
piled up a 14'2-game margin, and
now what is it? Nine and one-half
games. They might well be starting
into the old "Here we go again'"
song and dance specialty.
On the other hand, they have one
of the best managers in the business,
thanks to the heads of the Hollywood
club—Bill Sweeney.
Sweeney did what most fans
thought was impossible last year by
bringing the Stars from the depth of
the league cellar, and hoisting them
into fourth place. Brother, believe
me, it takes something to do that,
especially with those Hollywood
Bums.
II Sweeney has to take his arm out
of mothballs and get in the lineup
himself to stop a losing streak, he'd
do it. Lord help the Angels, though,
if this situation arose.
All that we can do is hold tight,
and see what happens. Anyway, the
talk about splitting the league into
two sections has died. That's some
thing.
