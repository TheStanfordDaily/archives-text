# Beavers Drop Series to S.F.
## 
### 
By taking seven out of nine games
from the un-Lucky Portland Beav
ers, San Francisco moved two games
closer to the top of the PCL during
the last week. This was affected
when Seattle, with the help of Um
pire Ed Borski, took their series from
Los Angeles. The Seals are now only
nine and a half games off the pace
setting Angels.
The Seals had all the luck in the
world to win several of their skirm
ishes last week. Sid Cohen, Beaver

pitcher, was the fall guy both times
with victories in sight. The same
players figured in both cases. What
happened was Joe Sprinz hit easy
double play balls to Packy Rogers,
only both times to have the ball hit
pebbles to bounce out to the boards
to give San Francisco two unde
served wins.
With all this bad luck running
against them, the Beavers were
lucky enough to drop no lower than
a notch in the standings.
