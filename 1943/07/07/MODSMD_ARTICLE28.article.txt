# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL STRUTHERS 
When you've got something to say and want
io say it straight, Bull Session is the place to say
it. It's sort of like brushing your teeth the morn
ftng after. I write it and you read it and we both
have a better taste in our mouths. I know, be
cause I spent the weekend finding it out. It
took me about ten hours and a swirl of khaki
that spun my head much faster than getting
caught in the Bookstore when they're passing
out slide rules. But this time I think I've got a
.more accurate picture of the soldier-student situ
ation, and I know I can give it to you.
You see there's apt to be some friction be
tween the soldiers and the civilian students.
Even new freshmen have trouble getting used to
Stanford. They have an adjustment to make
and so do soldiers. But if we can look at the sol
diers' viewpoint, we can make Stanford a better
place for them and for us.
First, it's about time that we civilians around
here get to know the soldiers enough to dis
tinguish between the STARs and the ASTUs.
The STARs are here at Stanford for only a few
weeks, during which they take tests to deter
mine just what they will study. Then they are
sent to another college for about nine months
of concentrated study. That's when they are in
the ASTU, which means Army Specialized
Training Unit. The ASTUs are the fellows in
Stanford's Companies E, F, G, H, and I. They
are the ones that have been here at Stanford
[or some time and want to become an intimate
part of the school. They are concerned with
what we civilians think of them, because they
have to live here and they are more certain of
being here next quarter than most men are.
Second, the soldiers are not here at Stanford
because they want to be here. It's an assign
ment, not a choice, this being sent to college
again. Ask them what college they would pre
fer and they won't name Stanford, in spite of
my little character named Pvt. George Ambrose.
Although it's easier here, they aren't griping
about the camp they came from. They expect
the Army to be rough, and they brag about the
tough two months they spent on maneuvers in
the desert rather than the soft time they had tak
ing the STAR placement tests at some Midwest
ern college.
Third, I don't think we realize what a wide,
diverse group these soldiers are. It's not like
it used to be when every Stanford student had
almost the same background. Right now the
STARs and the ASTUs have men ranging from
18 to 30 years of age. Some of them have M.A.s
or Ph.D.s from other colleges. They come from
the East, the South, and the Midwest. Some of
them have enough money to buy Stanford.
Others didn't have enough money to buy shoes
till they were 15 years old. And then they had
to earn it themselves. Some still like the old
'.rah-rah life. Others got enough of it when Hoo
ver was President.
But right now they're in uniform. Khaki is a
great leveler. The guys with the convertibles
don't have them here. The tennis champ from
Vanderbilt and the president of the lowa State
student body and the guy who wrote a radio
show for Texas A. & M. all look alike in khaki.
In fact, unless we go out of our way to look at
their faces, all of these more brilliant guys look
just like their roommate who maybe is a boor

and hasn't done a think in his life except get
drafted.
As I see it, Stanford women have had a few
experiences with some soldiers who didn't care,
who were a little crude, or who just didn't ap
peal to them. Stanford women are further frus
trated by conflicting suggestions for conduct
from the administration, from their home train
ing, and from what they feel like doing. Con
seguently, Stanford women have become some
what cold and exclusive, which the soldiers
naturally can't understand, because they know
that they are just as good as anybody else.
They're not asking favors from civilians. That's
what gripes them. They just want us to get rid
of our false superiority.
Another slant o nthe whole setup. Nothing
gripes a soldier more than having us build up
Stanford University to them. Most of them are
disillusioned and sadly so. They've been around
. . . they've seen too much . . . they've left too
much at home to believe that Stanford is the best
of possible places in the world. So when we—
and this includes W.A.S., Jr. on July 1st —tell
them how swell it is that they are at Stanford,
they naturally think we are patting our own
backs, which we are. Thus we are displaying
a superiority that irritates them no end. Thus
they write home and say, "Stanford is not what
I thought it would be. You people back home
have much too good an idea about Stanford."
Take two thousand soldiers times how many
letters they will write and think of the advertis
ing we are doing for ourselves. Think of the
advertising we could be doing for Stanford. And
look at how it's going to affect us. It's just poor
business. These soldiers are going to be around
after the war and their kids are going to college
somewhere.
So let's wise up. Let's do more than strike up
a condescending conversation on quad or go
to the AT EASE dance Saturday. Let's change
our thinking about soldiers.
