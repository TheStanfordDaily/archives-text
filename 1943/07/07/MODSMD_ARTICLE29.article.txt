To The Editor:
Yep, the women here at Stanford are keep
ing away from us soldiers because, yardbird,
we are on trial here, and until we pass the test,
we aren't going to be accepted into their society
like we would if we were at home. You see,
the Army is pretty new to this town and the
people here have heard about and seen a lot of
soldiers doing things they don't like, until they
think every guy in O.D.'s is the same.
Now they have the idea that we aren't a
j regular bunch of soldiers, but still we are the
G.l.'s so we have to show them we are different.
And the way to do that is to watch ourselves.
If we can't help whistling at the girls, we'd
best stick some crackers in our pockets and use
them when we feel the urge. If we do this, the
people will make up their minds that they like
us. Then they won't shy away, but they'll mul
tiply the kindness they have already shown.
Another thing, we're proud to be here.
We've got plenty of work ahead of us and we
intend to work like we've never worked before!
We're thankful that we're here, not only be
i cause of the living conditions, but because
we've been selected to do a special job. Yes,
we've got something to offer, too, and if we're
worrying about the social life at Stanford, just
remember that unless we mess it up ourselves
by acting like a bunch of kids, the people are
going to be as proud to have us around as we
are to be here!—A PRIVATE

Another thing, we're proud to be here.
We've got plenty of work ahead of us and we
intend to work like we've never worked before!
We're thankful that we're here, not only be
i cause of the living conditions, but because
we've been selected to do a special job. Yes,
we've got something to offer, too, and if we're
worrying about the social life at Stanford, just
remember that unless we mess it up ourselves
by acting like a bunch of kids, the people are
going to be as proud to have us around as we
are to be here!—A PRIVATE
