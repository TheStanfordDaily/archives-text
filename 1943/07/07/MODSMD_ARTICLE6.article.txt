Friday night the W.A.A. and Card

evening, according to Sis Larkin,
president of the W.A.A.
There will be folk-dancing in the
gym until 9 p.m. when there will be
a shift to ballroom dancing. Outside,
there will be volleyball for those who
would like to play.
" This is open to all Stanford stu
dents, Miss Larkin said. "It is free,
and students are asked to come with
or without dates. The W.A.A. and
Cardinals are sponsoring this," she
continued, "so that the students will
have some place on campus to go on
Friday night."
