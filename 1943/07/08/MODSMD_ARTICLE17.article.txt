## LATE TIPS 
### LATE WILLIAMS

umnist is Bill Allen, who is now
putting in time for the Navy at
California. Allen handled all base
ball assignments while on the Daily
staff last quarter. Play ball.)

Really seems good to be back in
the old shack seated once again at a
typewriter pounding out a little
blurb for the greatest bunch of stu
dents iii the country. Believe me I
can say that, after spending a week
at the state U. up in the fog
enveloped hills of Berkeley.
Looks as though the sports picture
on the Farm is not very bright
most of the athletes whose names
were familiar to the tongues of Red
rooters are now attempting to find
their way around the largest and
most mixed up place ever.
Most of the men who played foot
ball last year in the colors of Cardi
nal and White are planning to com
pete for Cal if the naval commander
gives his permission. Such notables
as Bob Barsocchini, Bill Joslyn, Fred
Boensch, and many others.
Others, such as Leo McCaffrey and
Ward.Walkup may not be there long
enough to play in their respective
sports, but all plan to do so if pos
sible.
It is going to be funny to listen to
the rooting sections when and if the
two teams meet. Who is going to
root for who?
On P.C.L. Ball
My pet hobby. P.C.L. baseball, is

| certainly progressing very badly this
season. Most of the teams look like
bushers in action. The only bright
spot in the picture seems to be the
Angels, and now even they show
signs of loosening at the seams.
George (Gorgeous Georgus) Met
kovich of the Sassy Seals was ped
dled yesterday tot he Boston Red
Sox. One of two things is certain,
either Joe Cronin of the Sox is harder
; up than anyone realizes, or Charlie
J Graham is the greatest salesman in
j the business.
During the last few weeks, pitch
| ers of the Coast League have been
! slow-balling Met to death, and he
can't seem to hit the stuff. If he can't
hit Coast pitching, how does anyone
expect him to come near the ball in
i the big time. If Pappy Joiner of the
Stars can set him down twice in a
row via the whiff method, and at the
j same time allowing his teammates to
I pile up six runs in two innings, with
I only a soft ball between him and
| defeat, think of what the Yankee
staff will do to Brother Met. Cronin
had better start realizing that you
don't pick up a Ted Williams every
[ day in the year.

Really seems good to be back in
the old shack seated once again at a
typewriter pounding out a little
blurb for the greatest bunch of stu
dents iii the country. Believe me I
can say that, after spending a week
at the state U. up in the fog
enveloped hills of Berkeley.
Looks as though the sports picture
on the Farm is not very bright
most of the athletes whose names
were familiar to the tongues of Red
rooters are now attempting to find
their way around the largest and
most mixed up place ever.
Most of the men who played foot
ball last year in the colors of Cardi
nal and White are planning to com
pete for Cal if the naval commander
gives his permission. Such notables
as Bob Barsocchini, Bill Joslyn, Fred
Boensch, and many others.
Others, such as Leo McCaffrey and
Ward.Walkup may not be there long
enough to play in their respective
sports, but all plan to do so if pos
sible.
It is going to be funny to listen to
the rooting sections when and if the
two teams meet. Who is going to
root for who?
On P.C.L. Ball
My pet hobby. P.C.L. baseball, is

| certainly progressing very badly this
season. Most of the teams look like
bushers in action. The only bright
spot in the picture seems to be the
Angels, and now even they show
signs of loosening at the seams.
George (Gorgeous Georgus) Met
kovich of the Sassy Seals was ped
dled yesterday tot he Boston Red
Sox. One of two things is certain,
either Joe Cronin of the Sox is harder
; up than anyone realizes, or Charlie
J Graham is the greatest salesman in
j the business.
During the last few weeks, pitch
| ers of the Coast League have been
! slow-balling Met to death, and he
can't seem to hit the stuff. If he can't
hit Coast pitching, how does anyone
expect him to come near the ball in
i the big time. If Pappy Joiner of the
Stars can set him down twice in a
row via the whiff method, and at the
j same time allowing his teammates to
