The President's League, Stanford's j
intramural Softball loop, resumed
play today after a four-day layoff
over the Fourth or July weekend.
Every one of the seven scheduled j
games was played. In the day's top
: contest, Buchanan maintained its un-
defeated record with a 14-6 win over
I Garfield.
Leon Watson, Buchanan Hall's '
counterpart of the Boston Braves'
Jim Tobin, pitched and batted his
j team to victory. He had a perfect
j day at bat, getting four hits, includ
fng one homer, out of as many trips
to the plate. It was the third straight
j win for Buchanan.
Gerona A.C. beat Arthur Hall, 6-5,
in an extra-inning pitchers' battle. !
Arthur did well in keeping even J
; with the undefeated Gerona boys for
; the regulation seven innings. Ge- |
rona and Buchanan, both undefeated,
are the only teams who have thus |
far won three games.
Oliver Baer pitched the Firehouse j
nine to a 14-3 win over Cleveland, i
He struck out a total of 13 men in |
! five innings. The game was called at
j the end of the fifth inning after the
Firehouse had scored eight runs in
| the fourth.
| Monroe beat Tyler, 10-6, in one of j

he day's biggest upsets. Tyler, pre
viously unbeaten, got off to a one
run lead in the first inning. Monroe
came back with nine in the second,
and coasted to an easy win.
Hayes Hall, the league's most con
j sistent team, kept its record clear
1 (of victories) by losing again, this
time to McKinley. in a 31-17 comedy
of errors.
