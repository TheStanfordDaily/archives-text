PERHAPS more than anything else, young men and women
desire security—a sense of something stable and solid to
look for in the future. Under present world conditions, such a .
want is hardly satisfied. It is difficult to look ahead and see any-;
thing but chaos and uncertainty.
Youth has grown to accept, or at least recognize, the fact that 1
tor the duration of the -war any semblance of security or cer
tainty is out. But urgent in the thinking of all college-age students,
:in the services and out, is the manner in which they will find a
.'living when the war is over—the way they can make for their
own personal security and happiness.
A troubling question immediately presents itself. When they
release millions from the services after the war, will there be jobs j
enough to go around? The answer depends largely on Congress, j
But the outline for a "yes" answer now lies in the 450,000-word
National Resources Planning Board report on "Security, Work, |
md Relief Policies."
A parallel to England's Beveridge Plan, the report outlines j
suggestions to keep our economy running during the transition
irorn war to peace. A detailed section deals with the demobiliza-!
lion of men, machines, and economic controls when the war ends. '
Dismissal wages for soldiers, government supervision of indus-1
trial reconversion, aid in opening new areas for investment, as- ,
sistance to industries in need of capital, enforcement of labor
standards, initiation of large scale public works programs—all
these recommended policies will mold the answer which can be i
given thousands of collegians who enter adult civilian life for ;
ithe tirst time when they doff uniform.
The report doesn't call for immediate legislation, and it hasn't
had much pushing from the administration. But, because of the
provisions and planning of jobs after the war, college students
stand to lose if the program is not supported. For in these con
crete suggestions, perhaps we can find the answer to our need
for security; and the straw on which to build our plans and hopes
;for the future.
