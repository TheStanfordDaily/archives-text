### BILL STRUTHERS 
THINGS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE:
The Dean of Women sitting on her desk, swinging her legs
over the side, leaning intimately towards a naive freshman, and
saying, "Well, woman to woman, it's this way ..."
Pat George in a capsule labeled Benzadrene sulphateâ€”a small
but powerful heart stimulant . . . The guys in my navigation class
at Dinah's every night . . . Chief of Police Gordy Davis reviewing
his troops . . . Stanford's V-l and V-7 boys getting up at 5:30
a.m. in the Berkeley fog . . . The soldier that gave me a bridge
hand, jack high, six no trump bid, and asked me to play it for
him because he had to answer a roll call . . .
ADD: The sailor I met. A second class torpedo man, Sub
marine Service. "Look," he said, pointing to a young Air Corps
lieutenant, "glamor boys they are. Nothing more. Hollywood
haircuts, tan faces, well-trimmed mustaches, lots of show, plenty
of zoom, they make pretty pictures. But who gets the work done?
Look at the figures of the number of ships sunk, at the blows
struck at the Axis. It's the Submarine Service that does the work,
gets the dirt, and misses the credit.
"And what do I get. I've been outside of Tokyo harbor with
out seeing daylight for 90 days, but everybody shoves me around
like another drunken gob."
So I'm going to write a song for the Submarine Service and
have Fred Waring sing it and make my sailor friend happier.
PLUS: The "Thank Gosh It's Friday" Club started on this
campus . . . The girl who lives in her post office box and comes
out only when mail comes in . . . Someone with a good New
Orleans jazz record collection . . . And last but not least, the
Stanford "sosh" at the AT EASE dance this Saturday. Looks
like it'll be the biggest and best dance this quarter.
