# EDUCATION
## Workshop Aids Current Needs 
### Jim Ford 
Meeting to determine the charac
teristics of the wartime national edu
cation program, the two weeks'
workshop held at Stanford in the
summer of 1942, provided oppor
tunity for a group of teachers and
administrators to set down current
needs in devoting education to vic
tory and a lasting peace.
Education today has a magnificent
opportunity to contribute to the war
effort, the workshop pointed out, as
education can interpret the issues
involved in the conflict, and can help
mold a democratic society through
out the world.
Major Aims of Nations
As set down by the workshop, there
are two major aims of the United Na
tions —military defeat of the Axis, and
world-wide achievement of demo
cratic values. Military success de
pends upon the cooperation and zeal
of the total population. This attitude
of the people can be developed
through a deep understanding of
democratic privileges provided by
education.
"To establish world-wide demo
cratic conditions." the workshop
stated, "we must spread the ideas of
brotherhood and basic rights, pro
vide equality of opportunity to the
individual, and establish a world
federation which will insure peace
and democratic values. Education
will create the attitudes and under
standings necessary to these achieve
ments."
Educational Goals
Believing that education is essen
tial to victory and peace, the work
shop analyzed these various areas in
which education contributes to the
United Nations' goals:
1. Education must help to bring
about an understanding of the issues
of the war, explaining the inequali
ties which exist in the political, eco
nomic, and cultural life of the world.
2. Education is obligated to aid in
the ultimate establishment of effec
tive peace by inspiring loyalty to
and faith in democracy.
3. Education should promote men
tally and physically healthful living
through the establishment of desir
able health habits, and through dis
seminating reliable information con
cerning mental and physical health.
Use of Resources
4. Education can encourage intel
ligent utilization of resources, by
teaching which materials are most
urgently needed, and how children
and adults can act to conserve and
salvage the existing supplies of es
sential goods.
5. Education can contribute to in
creasing effectiveness in the per
formance of civic duties by arousing
enthusiasm for and a sense of re
sponsibility concerning all civic af
fairs.
7. Education can help develop ef
fectiveness in production for war and
peace by building worker morale and
adequately supplying skilled workers
and trained managers.
Develops Character
7. Education can develop character
for war and peace by giving students
opportunities to face moral issues
and to make decisions which they
are willing to support.
8. Education will produce a sense
of world citizenship by developing
skill in interpreting world problems,
presenting information about world
problems, and ability to get along
with other types of people.

administrators to set down current
needs in devoting education to vic
tory and a lasting peace.
Education today has a magnificent
opportunity to contribute to the war
effort, the workshop pointed out, as
education can interpret the issues
involved in the conflict, and can help
mold a democratic society through
out the world.
Major Aims of Nations
As set down by the workshop, there
are two major aims of the United Na
tions —military defeat of the Axis, and
world-wide achievement of demo
cratic values. Military success de
pends upon the cooperation and zeal
of the total population. This attitude
of the people can be developed
through a deep understanding of
democratic privileges provided by
education.
"To establish world-wide demo
cratic conditions." the workshop
stated, "we must spread the ideas of
brotherhood and basic rights, pro
vide equality of opportunity to the
individual, and establish a world
federation which will insure peace
and democratic values. Education
will create the attitudes and under
standings necessary to these achieve
ments."
Educational Goals
Believing that education is essen
tial to victory and peace, the work
shop analyzed these various areas in
which education contributes to the
United Nations' goals:
1. Education must help to bring
about an understanding of the issues
of the war, explaining the inequali
ties which exist in the political, eco
nomic, and cultural life of the world.
2. Education is obligated to aid in
the ultimate establishment of effec
tive peace by inspiring loyalty to
and faith in democracy.
3. Education should promote men
tally and physically healthful living
through the establishment of desir
able health habits, and through dis
seminating reliable information con
cerning mental and physical health.
Use of Resources
4. Education can encourage intel
ligent utilization of resources, by
teaching which materials are most
urgently needed, and how children
and adults can act to conserve and
salvage the existing supplies of es
sential goods.
5. Education can contribute to in
creasing effectiveness in the per
formance of civic duties by arousing
enthusiasm for and a sense of re
sponsibility concerning all civic af
fairs.
7. Education can help develop ef
fectiveness in production for war and
peace by building worker morale and
adequately supplying skilled workers
and trained managers.
Develops Character
7. Education can develop character
for war and peace by giving students
opportunities to face moral issues
and to make decisions which they
are willing to support.
8. Education will produce a sense
of world citizenship by developing
skill in interpreting world problems,
presenting information about world
problems, and ability to get along
with other types of people.
Meeting to determine the charac
teristics of the wartime national edu
cation program, the two weeks'
workshop held at Stanford in the
summer of 1942, provided oppor

needs in devoting education to vic
