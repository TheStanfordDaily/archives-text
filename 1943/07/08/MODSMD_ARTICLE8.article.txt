# Russian Farce Starts July 14
## 
### 
Farce and comedy will feature the
production in the Little Theater
Wednesday through Saturday of
next week when the Stanford Play
ers present the Russian play, "Squar
ing the Circle."
Written by Valentine Katsav. noted
for his satirical novels, the plot is a
result of the housing shortage, the
â€¢five-year plan," and the Soviet
marriage and divorce ethics.
The action of the play, the first
production to be given by the play
ers this Summer Quarter, centers in
a tenement house room in which two
married couples live.
The cast includes David Regnery
as Vasya, Sally Stocker as Ludmilla,
Peggy Fitts as Tonya, Roger Blan
der as Abram, Tom Flynn as Emilian,
and Jean Levinson as Rabinov. The
part of Rabinov was originally titled
Rabinovitch and enacted by a man.
Rehearsals, under the direction of
David W. Sievers, followed the try
outs of June 22. The Russian names
and nicknames have caused trouble
to the players, but all are now ac
customed to the addition of syllables.
All members of the cast have
played in previous production either
on campus or in other theater
groups.
