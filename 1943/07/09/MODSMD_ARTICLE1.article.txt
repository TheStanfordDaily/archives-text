# Lil' Injun To Don War Bonnet For STU Dance
## 
### Pfc. Allen B. Schall 
The Lil' Injun, renowned to thousands of Stanfordites for his feats of
daring as the bearer of Stanford's colors throughout the years, has doffed
mufti and will appear in heroic size both in caricature and flesh Saturday

evening at the Women's Gym when Companies E
and F of Stanford ASTU present "At Ease."
One more chapter to this mite's interesting life
will unfold when he appears resplendent in the latest
model steel war bonnet (complete with feathers) as
an integral part of the decorative motif for the dance.
Wears Pfc. Chevrons
A symbol of his complete assimilation into Army
routine are the chevrons of a private first class which
adorn his tribal arm bands.
Since his birth from the fertile pen and brain of
Tommy Thompson in 1936 the Lil' Injun has, in the
words of Kipling met "with triumph and disaster"
and treated both impostors as the same. After each
struggle he has arisen smiling and ready for the
future.
Hides in a Jeep
In 1940 a red racing car became his means of loco
motion and remained with him until the rubber
shortage at which time he traded it for a jeep. In
late months he has his activities to
campus philosophizing.
A recent review of his life prophesied an un
certain future which held possibilities of service with
the armed forces. This prophecy bore fruit when
Pfc. Norbourne L. Shrader of E Company turned his

artistic bent —polished by a year of study at the Sorbonne in Paris—into
drafting the mighty redskin into the service of his country.
Tickets Available
Shrader, in line with his fostering of the Injun's latest deed, will portray
this offspring of Tommy Thompson as a part of the program to be presented
during the dance Saturday evening.
Time of the dance is 9 p.m. Civilian students may still obtain tickets at
the A.S.S.U. office and men of Companies E. F, G, H. and I may obtain their
tickets from their social chairmen or orderly rooms.
