## 
### Jane Donald 
"America's Town Meeting of the
.Air" broadcast a debate yesterday
afternoon from the Memorial Thea
er on the question, "Must Western
Supremacy Be Restored in East Asia
..After the War?" in which Dr. Harold
Fisher took the affirmative and Owen
Lattimore maintained the negative.
Dr. Fisher, professor of history,
maintained that the economic and
socail revolution of East Asia has
gone too far to turn back, but not
far enough to go forward under local
leadership.
Westernization
"I maintain that this process of
Westernization can bring security
and well-being to the peoples of East
.Asia only if it proceeds under what
:ts in reality Western supremacy re
gardless of what we call it," Dr.
Fisher declared.
In asserting the negative side of
.the question, Mr. Lattimore, director
of Pacific operations for the Office of
War Information, emphasized that the
one issue which really matters is the
creating of a real world standard of
democracy.
"I cannot think of anything more
un-American than a war to establish
supermacy. We were forced into this
war by two nations which have been
poisoned by racial theories, the Ger
mans and the Japanese. Are we to
to end up a war against the fascist
racialism of the Nazis and the Jap
anese militarists by trying to set up
our own racialism?"
Norris Speaks
Mrs. Kathleen Norris, noted au
thoress. and Paul B. Ma lone, major
general U.S. Army (retired), acted
as interrogators for the program,
assisted in bringing out important
points that had been overlooked, and

tried to detect flaws in the argument.

vancement of an honestly informed
public opinion.

question by Dr. Fisher and Mr. Lat
timore. the audience asked questions

I the questions, said, "Our objective
j should not be a Western standard
| but a world standard, to which all
J can obtain and receive assistance in
i reaching."
After Defeat
Mr. Denny, during the course of
the discussion, directed to Dr. Fisher
and Mr. Lattimore the question,
"What are we going to do with Japan
| after its defeat?"
Dr. Fisher suggested that after
beating the Japanese, the U.S. must
find a way to save for the East and
; the world certain qualities which
| the Japanese have maintained in
) their lives.
Punishment of Guilty
Mr. Lattimore said that when the
| guilty are punished, care must be
! taken that there is a safeguard to
prevent Japan from going out again
! on the rampage, and yet Japan must
, not be a colonial dependency.
He proposed that Japan's indus
j tries and her right of economic ac
cess to raw be left, but
that her political control over them
be taken away.
