# Stanford Tax Worries Ended
## 
### 
Stanford and all other privately
endowed colleges of California may
lease their facilities to the Govern
ment without worry about real and
personal tax problems, Atty. Gen.
Robert W. Kenney ruled yesterday.
His opinion cleared Stanford and
the other private colleges of tax
worries as a result of the case of
fered by St. Mary's College which
faced a tax bill of $30,000.
"I believe," he ruled, "that the use
of St. Mary's College property by the
United States Navy is a use for edu
cational purposes. Although the cur
riculum is devoted to those things
necessary to the science of flying, it
would appear that in view of modern
developments courses preparing our
youth for such an activity are just
as proper as courses preparing them
for a career as lawyers, businessmen,
or engineers."
The case was raised by a decision
in the office of the district attorney
of Contra Costa County. In an opin
ion prepared by Dep. Dis.t. Atty. John
L. Garaventa, a graduate of St.
Mary's, the college was declared tax
able.
Stanford was saved by the new
opinion from war taxation so long as
the Army uses its campus. St.
Mary's, the College of the Pacific, and
others were also relieved from war

taxation while the Army or the Navy
uses their campuses.
When he made the decision, Ken
ney also suggested that universities
and colleges concentrate their pro
grams on war courses.
