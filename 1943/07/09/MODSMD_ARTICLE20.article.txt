# LATE TIPS

### LATE WILLIAMS 
Gunder Hagg, to be chased by Gil
Dudds. will attempt to set a new two
mile record this Saturday at Los An
geles on the Coliseum track.
The "come on" articles have begun
to appear, with most of them featur
ing a build-up of the track itselfâ€”
that is, how fast it is, and the num
ber of records that have been broken
on it.
Our opinion is that Mr. Hagg will
have to streamline his hair before he
cracks his own record on that oval.
The old Coliseum track ain't what
it used to be in 1932. Granted, it isn't
too rough for the long distances, but
as the races shorted, watch out.
It is possible that Hagg might turn
the trick, if Dodds pushes him
enough, and if the flying Swede is in

top shape. This remains to be seen.
However, if the southland boys
really wanted to see Hagg run, they
ought to hold the meet on the Comp
ton track. Before the war, this sta
dium used to be the scene of the
famous Compton Invitational, and all
that you have to do to realize how
fast this track is, is to look over the
meet marks. If anything, the track
is getting faster year by year.
We doubt very much if Hagg will
top the record. If we're wrong, ah
well. If we're right, chalk it up as
one of the few that we've won.
