# The
						Cellar

### 
rN a response to a call by the Daily and the War Board, many
L girls volunteered to work in the Cellar from 2 to 4 in the after
noon, a time when it was closed because of labor shortage.
When these girls applied for the job, they were told that labor
jvas no longer needed, but still the Cellar remained closed for
two hours each afternoon. The Director of University Dining
Halls and the Cellar has clarified this by explaining that the
Cellar is closed during this time to enable the janitors to clean up.
Previously, such work was done after closing hours in the eve
ning, but now janitorial work must be done in the afternoon.—
