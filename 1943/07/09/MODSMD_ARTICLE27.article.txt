### BILL STRUTHERS 
SUMMER AT STANFORD: Dark glasses and tan skin. Sprin
klers on the lawn. Swallows above the Quad. The front steps
of the Libe spattered with olive drab. Thin crisp blouses and
white skirts with rolled sleeves and open necks. Big people with
little problems and little people with big problems.
And what do we do? Take a deep breath of a soft warm night.
Listen to a tenor sax solo of "Body and Soul," or the final move
ment of Cesar Franck's Symphony in D minor. Or the metallic
chirp of crickets from the stubble fields. Let the green leaves of a
.low branch brush our foreheads. Write our name in the dust on
a yellow convertible.
And what should we do? Look at the little insignificant, il
logical, haphazard things; the nouns and verbs; the prepositions
I, you, and us; the things that aren't in a report of a Roosevelt-
Churchill conference; the things that aren't said by the mayor of
our home-town speaking to the Rotary Club on post-war prob
lems. Realize that it is 4hese little things that we really live by.
These little things—the piece of paper that missed the waste
basket, the cigarette we chocked on, the coke we spilled, the let
ter we didn't get today, the notes we didn't take because our pen
went dry—they are the things in this world that we can feel.
We don't have to think about them or be logical about them. We
can absorb them and let them expand our bodies, clear our minds,
and charge our emotions with new sensitivity.
And we can live a fuller life without thinking about it.
