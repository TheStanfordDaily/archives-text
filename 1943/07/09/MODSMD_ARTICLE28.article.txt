To The Editor:
Shocked by the realization that the Zoot Suiters could parade
on the hallowed grounds of this pearl of the Peninsula, Stanford
University, Northern California, we saw on geology corner one
of their clan. Is this Fifth Column activity? Is this a sign of the
hordes that are to follow? Has Stanford women's attire degen
erated to naked toes spilling out of vivid orange sandals; to four
inches of black and white checked skirt and five feet of reve
pleated topcoat?
Miss Five-by-Five strolled by Company XYZ who retaliated
with "Pipe the Zoot Suit." Several L.A.'ers screamed "Caramba"
and passed out cold. What dumb dodo would dress like this?
She must cease or be seized.
