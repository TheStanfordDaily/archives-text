# FIREHOUSE
## Something New For the Boys 
### Jim Weinberg 
Something new has been added to
the old Stanford Firehouse. Long
noted for putting out winning intra
mural teams and fires, the Firehouse
is now the proud possessor of a brand
new fire-egnine.
Well, perhaps not '"brand new."
Due to the war and the priorities
situation, it was impossible to buy a
ready-made new engine, so the Fire
house boys did the next best thing.
They had one of the Corporation
Yard' slate-model General Motors
trucks converted into a fire-wagon.
Tank Truck
The new engine is a tank truck,
and carries 300 gallons of water. It
has a self-contained pumping unit,
and thus is able to get along without
the old-fashioned fire hydrant. In
fact, it has all the latest features es
sential to fire trucks, including a "T"
gasoline ration card Another unique
feature is the fact that the engine has
12 forward speeds, about three times
as many as the average truck.
The only thing missing is the
familiar Stanford Axe that adorns
the doors of the other engines, and
perhaps it will be added later. After
all, the engine has only been around
the Firehouse for a short time, and it
does take a while to catch on to the
Firehouse traditions.
The firehouse now has two tank
trucks and will be much better
equipped to fight future fires. This
brings their grand total up lu six
pieces of equipment.
Fire-Engine Chasers
Good news is in store for the fire
engine chasers on campus. They will
have a chance to see the new engine
in action every Sunday morning
when the firehouse boys hold their
regular drill. The only catch is that
they'll have to get up at 9:30 to see
it. In case you're interested, the
number is 83. and the color is red—
bright red.
The news isn't all good, however.
Those hoping for free rides on the
new truck will be disappointed to
hear that regulations prevent them.
Sorry!

Good news is in store for the fire
engine chasers on campus. They will
have a chance to see the new engine
in action every Sunday morning
when the firehouse boys hold their
regular drill. The only catch is that
they'll have to get up at 9:30 to see
it. In case you're interested, the
number is 83. and the color is red—
bright red.
The news isn't all good, however.
Those hoping for free rides on the
new truck will be disappointed to
hear that regulations prevent them.
Sorry!
Something new has been added to
the old Stanford Firehouse. Long
noted for putting out winning intra
mural teams and fires, the Firehouse
is now the proud possessor of a brand
new fire-egnine.
Well, perhaps not '"brand new."
Due to the war and the priorities
situation, it was impossible to buy a
ready-made new engine, so the Fire
house boys did the next best thing.
They had one of the Corporation
Yard' slate-model General Motors
trucks converted into a fire-wagon.
Tank Truck
The new engine is a tank truck,
and carries 300 gallons of water. It
has a self-contained pumping unit,
and thus is able to get along without
the old-fashioned fire hydrant. In
fact, it has all the latest features es
sential to fire trucks, including a "T"
gasoline ration card Another unique
feature is the fact that the engine has
12 forward speeds, about three times
as many as the average truck.
The only thing missing is the
familiar Stanford Axe that adorns
the doors of the other engines, and
perhaps it will be added later. After
all, the engine has only been around
the Firehouse for a short time, and it
does take a while to catch on to the
Firehouse traditions.
The firehouse now has two tank
trucks and will be much better
equipped to fight future fires. This
brings their grand total up lu six
pieces of equipment.
