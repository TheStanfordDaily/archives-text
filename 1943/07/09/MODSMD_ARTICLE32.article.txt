## 'Ox-Bow' Has Unusual Plot 
### 
THE OX-BOW INCIDENT â€” Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
According to the previews, "The
Ox-Bow Incident" was supposed to
be unusual and different. And it is.
but that's all.
The story, taken from the well
known novel, could very likely have
been made into a first rate picture
before the war, but now, with Holly
wood so depleted of man power, the
picture was handled in a rather slip
shod manner, and with too much
emphasis on the morbid and depress
ing side of the plot.
The two most important roles were
played by Henry Fonda and Dana
Andrews, although the picture could
have gotten along just as well with
out emphasis on any of the roles.
