At the last Honor Code panel dis

house before an audience of 60 Stan

and by members of the audience re

this Thursday.
"The last discussion was a lively
one and successful," said Georgians
Fitzgerald, chairman of Women's
Council. "This one promises to be a
bigger and better one, though, with
even more concrete results. Each
faculty member will receive an in
vitation, and although it's impossible
to send one to each Stanford woman,
everyone is welcome."
