# Plot Fails In Current Film

i LADY (>r BURLESQUE, now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
When Hollywood makes a poor
I version of a good novel it is bad, but
j when they put out a poor version of
a not so sharp novel it is inexcusable.
| Such is the case with "Lady of Bur
! lesque."
In fact, to make matters worse, the
: movie version of Gypsy Rose Lee's
j "G String Murder" isn't even a good
mystery. The plot is confusing to
j start out with, gets more and more
! confusing as it progresses and then
suddenly ends. At least it is fortu
! nate that it ends at all because there
were still oodles of people that could
have been killed off.
But the way it ended! There were
at least a dozen people who could
! have been the murderer but the
script writers (or Miss Lee) had to
be different and had to make—Well,
I (here's no point in telling who the
murderer is because that would spoil
j the picture.
The second feature is an "epic" of
| the race track, "Harrigan's Kid,"
i which is no better than the feature
J attraction.—Gugel
