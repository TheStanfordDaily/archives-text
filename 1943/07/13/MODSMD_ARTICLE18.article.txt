### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
We were enroute to the Union
Dining Hall yesterday to do our time
at hashing when we saw Stanford's
middle distance star Johnny Fulton
strolling down the Quad.
This was the first time we had seen
Johnny since he had taken off for
points east to compete in the N.C.-
A.A. Since this meet, he has com
peted in the National A.A.U., and
special races in Chicago and last
week at Los Angeles. At present he
is preparing to compete in the track
meet this Saturday at Kezar Stadium
in San Francisco.
Fulton will be out to nip U.S.C.'s
Cliff Bourland in the 440. a feat that
he has been unable to do in several
attempts this year. He said that if
Gunder Hagg runs the mile, he.
meaning Fulton, might even enter
that event. From this angle, strictly
on the laugh basis. Fulton said that
he thought he could keep up to the
long-striding Swede for at least the
first two laps, but after that, that's
all brother.
Most of the things that one reads
in the papers about Hagg's peculi
arities — including his dislike for
newspapermen—are mostly pure un
adulterated blurb. Hagg, unable to
speak English is forced to do his talk
ing through an interpreter, and that
is pretty tough. The only thing that
Gunder realy seems adverse to is
cameramen. He likes to have his
picture taken when in action, or not
at all.
The conversation switched to the
subject of one Gil Dodds, the man
who has been chasing the Swede
around numerous tracks this season.
Fulton is of the belief that the Bos
ton distance runner stands a fairly
good chance of beating Hagg if they
race over a mile course at Kezar in
stead of the heretofore two-mile.
Dodds ran the equivalent to a 4:07
mile by himself a short while back,
and Fulton thinks that he might be
able to pull this down to about 4:04.
If this is the case, anything can hap
pen Saturday.
Speaking of Sweden, the country
now has 10 runners that can navigate
the mile in 4:09 or better. It used to
be Finland that people looked to for
distance stars every few years, but
ever since Hagg began drawing
crowds, Sweden seems to have hit
the jack pot.

long-striding Swede for at least the
first two laps, but after that, that's
all brother.
Most of the things that one reads
in the papers about Hagg's peculi
arities — including his dislike for
newspapermen—are mostly pure un
adulterated blurb. Hagg, unable to
speak English is forced to do his talk
ing through an interpreter, and that
is pretty tough. The only thing that
Gunder realy seems adverse to is
cameramen. He likes to have his
picture taken when in action, or not
at all.
The conversation switched to the
subject of one Gil Dodds, the man
who has been chasing the Swede
around numerous tracks this season.
Fulton is of the belief that the Bos
ton distance runner stands a fairly
good chance of beating Hagg if they
race over a mile course at Kezar in
stead of the heretofore two-mile.
Dodds ran the equivalent to a 4:07
mile by himself a short while back,
and Fulton thinks that he might be
able to pull this down to about 4:04.
If this is the case, anything can hap
pen Saturday.
Speaking of Sweden, the country
now has 10 runners that can navigate
the mile in 4:09 or better. It used to
be Finland that people looked to for
distance stars every few years, but
ever since Hagg began drawing
crowds, Sweden seems to have hit
the jack pot.
We were enroute to the Union
Dining Hall yesterday to do our time
at hashing when we saw Stanford's
middle distance star Johnny Fulton
strolling down the Quad.
This was the first time we had seen
Johnny since he had taken off for
points east to compete in the N.C.-
A.A. Since this meet, he has com
peted in the National A.A.U., and
special races in Chicago and last
week at Los Angeles. At present he
is preparing to compete in the track
meet this Saturday at Kezar Stadium
in San Francisco.
Fulton will be out to nip U.S.C.'s
Cliff Bourland in the 440. a feat that
he has been unable to do in several
attempts this year. He said that if
Gunder Hagg runs the mile, he.
meaning Fulton, might even enter
that event. From this angle, strictly
on the laugh basis. Fulton said that
he thought he could keep up to the
long-striding Swede for at least the
first two laps, but after that, that's
all brother.
