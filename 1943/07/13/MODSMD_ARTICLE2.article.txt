# War Board Urges Students to Support New Saving System
## 
### 
A total of $806.05 has been turned in for the stamp and bond sales in the
living groups on campus that started at the beginning of this quarter. This
was the first trial for the new system of selling stamps and bonds at one
time instead of bothering' the people throughout the quarter at the begin
ning of each week.
"If this new system does not meet with success," said Betty May Hale,

■♦■president of the Stanford War
| Board, "we will have to resort to
the old system of asking people to
j buy a 25-cent stamp at the beginning
j of each week. Therefore, all students
j should back it in order to make it
| more successful. Students should
[ buy more stamps and bonds than
j ever."
The men were leading the girls in
this quarter's stamp drive. The men's
I halls bought a total of 5186.75 with
j three halls buying 100 per cent.

chanan 100, Lincoln 100. Hayes 90,
Tyler 52, and Garfield 41 per cent.
The women bought a total of 5619.30

$277.25 worth as Magnolia had 100,
