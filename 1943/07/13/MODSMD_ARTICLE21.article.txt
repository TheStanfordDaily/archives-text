LIL' INJUN with his helmet and chevrons of a private first
class did himself proud at the STAN-STU "At Ease' dance
Saturday night. The transformation from the pre-war Lil' Injun
with his red racing car was complete.
The orchestra, decorations, floor-show, and other attractions
combined to make the dance a very successful affair. The sol
diers in Companies E and F are to be commended for being such
genial hosts.
The way in which civilian men and soldiers mingled, and the
congenial attitude between them is worthy of mention. This
•showed not only that the Army Specialized Training Units have
become Stanford men more than just in name, but that the civilian
students are doing their part to make them feel at home.
The fitting climax to the evening's entertainment was the
STAN-STU song. The tribute to the Farm was appreciated.—
