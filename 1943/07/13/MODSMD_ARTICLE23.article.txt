# Bull Session
## 
### BILL STRUTHERS 
I don't read newspapers or go to movies or listen to the radio
because all of them remind me of the war. And I am the kind
of guy that would rather lie on the grass and think about Stan
ford in the summer. Even A 1 Hampson will tell you that. But
wanting to forget the war doesn't make me forget what I learned
:in high school history.
You see tomorrow is the 14th of July and that is Bastille Day
in France. It's a hangover from the time the French Revolution
hit the jackpot—democratically speaking. Because of the abnor
mal situation which the Germans have caused in gay Paris, there
will be only a minor celebration there. I say that without trying
to be a political commentator. But outside of France—every place
you find a Frenchman, inside of which you find a heart, you find
the spirit of Free France. Thus if you want a few hours of party
time tomorrow, all you have to do is find a son or daughter of
Free France.
For myself, I plan to start the celebration at 9 o'clock when
Monsieur Le Maitre, professeur de francais, rides past the post
office on his bicycle.
"Vive la France," I shall shout, and the multitude will respond
the same. The professor will start us singing "La Marseillaise"
and we will proceed towards the Quad. I'm sort of worried about
the crowd getting emotional and storming the engineering corner
in the manner that the original Bastille was stormed in 1789.
They're both made of stone, and I think they are both full of
fossils, either political offenders or social misfits.
At this point I expect a small boy—a pale and undernourished
victim of faulty child labor laws—to run up with a message from
the Committee on Public Exercises telling us that they have no
record of granting us a date for such a gathering. This, of course,
can be handled in a diplomatic way by exchanging a few formal
notes with the committee. The only danger comes from Cal
transfers who are lonesome for some of their old Sather gate
rallies and informal meetings. Sort of sad if you can't be demo
cratic in your own back yard, they will think.
The crowd will eventually break up. Some will go to L'Ome
lette's and some will go to class. I will go to the reserved book
room and read the worn, finger-marked parts oi Voltaire's Can
dide.. I haven't been to L'Omelette's since that sailor insisted
the cute little redhead was his wife

you find a Frenchman, inside of which you find a heart, you find
the spirit of Free France. Thus if you want a few hours of party
time tomorrow, all you have to do is find a son or daughter of
Free France.
For myself, I plan to start the celebration at 9 o'clock when
Monsieur Le Maitre, professeur de francais, rides past the post
office on his bicycle.
"Vive la France," I shall shout, and the multitude will respond
the same. The professor will start us singing "La Marseillaise"
and we will proceed towards the Quad. I'm sort of worried about
the crowd getting emotional and storming the engineering corner
in the manner that the original Bastille was stormed in 1789.
They're both made of stone, and I think they are both full of
fossils, either political offenders or social misfits.
At this point I expect a small boy—a pale and undernourished
victim of faulty child labor laws—to run up with a message from
the Committee on Public Exercises telling us that they have no
record of granting us a date for such a gathering. This, of course,
can be handled in a diplomatic way by exchanging a few formal
notes with the committee. The only danger comes from Cal
transfers who are lonesome for some of their old Sather gate
rallies and informal meetings. Sort of sad if you can't be demo
cratic in your own back yard, they will think.
The crowd will eventually break up. Some will go to L'Ome
lette's and some will go to class. I will go to the reserved book
room and read the worn, finger-marked parts oi Voltaire's Can
dide.. I haven't been to L'Omelette's since that sailor insisted
the cute little redhead was his wife
I don't read newspapers or go to movies or listen to the radio
because all of them remind me of the war. And I am the kind
of guy that would rather lie on the grass and think about Stan
ford in the summer. Even A 1 Hampson will tell you that. But
wanting to forget the war doesn't make me forget what I learned
:in high school history.
You see tomorrow is the 14th of July and that is Bastille Day
in France. It's a hangover from the time the French Revolution
hit the jackpot—democratically speaking. Because of the abnor
mal situation which the Germans have caused in gay Paris, there
will be only a minor celebration there. I say that without trying
to be a political commentator. But outside of France—every place
you find a Frenchman, inside of which you find a heart, you find
the spirit of Free France. Thus if you want a few hours of party
time tomorrow, all you have to do is find a son or daughter of
Free France.
