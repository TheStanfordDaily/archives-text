armies in three days of ligntning invasion had captured 11 towns and 4,0t)
! armies in three days of lightning invasion had captured 11 towns and 4,00.
; that big east coast port Sunday.
Stepping onto Italian soil from a destroyer which brought him across th-

channel from Africa without inci
dent, the Allied generalissimo ex
pressed satisfaction with the opera
tion and said, "Everything is
on nicely," official dispatches said. •
Big Acceleration
His arrival coincided with spec
tacular acceleration of the Allied ir -
vasion pace. The landings on th
beaches near Catania Sunday fc;
British troops extended the attai
area along 135 miles of the east an.-
southern coasts.
British and Canadian forces ha:
pinched off 147 square miles of the
southeast tip of Sicily and front re
ports said the Americans now con
trolled a bridgehead 25 miles wide
and 10 miles deep around Gela and
Licata on the southern coast. The
Allies were also in firm control of
the short line extending up the east
coast past captured Syracuse.
Syracuse Falls
Syracuse fell to veterans of the
British Eighth Army under Gen. Sit'
Bernard L. Montgomery at 9 p.m.
Saturday, and the new landings to
the north seemed to indicate a drive
to cut off Sicily from the Italian
mainland. Catania, the next objec
tive, lies on the east coast railway
to Messina which is only two miles
by the Straits Ferry to the toe of
Italy.
The American Seventh Army was
disclosed to have captured Licata
along with 300 Italian prisoners at a
cost of only four dead.
German Reserves
After speaking with officers on the
beach and watching sweating
troops, bared to the waist, landing
equipment, Eisenhower was driven
by jeep to the front headquarters of
Lieut. Gen. George F. Patten.
The Allies were reported driving
deeply inland against fierce opposi
tion which now included German
reserves as the Axis strove desper
ately to bulwark their sagging south
Sicily front.
In addition to pinching off 147
square miles of the southeast tip of
Sicily the Allies were in firm con
trol of the shoreline extending west
ward to Licata and northward to
Syracuse, official dispatches said
