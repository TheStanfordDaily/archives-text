# TUESDAY SERIES
## Darrow To Talk On Cosmic Ray 
### 
Illustrated with lantern slides, a
lecture of Cosmic Rays will be given
by Dr. Karl K. Darrow, physicist and
member of the technical staff of the
Bell Telephone Laboratories, on the
Tuesday Series program tonight at
8 in the auditorium of the Memorial
Hall.
This lecture is designed for the
layman and not for the physicist, ac
cording to the Committee on Exer
cises. Dr. Darrow will trace the
story of cosmic rays from its humble
beginnings some 40 years ago to the
present time when the}' are recog
nized as electricity and radian energy
in the most intense and concentrated
forms which are known.
Work Wonders
Dr. Darrow says these messengers
from inter-stellar space are able to
work wonders which our laboratories
as yet can scarcely approach: pene
tration of thickness of metal and
rock far beyond the scope of X-rays,
transmutation of light into electricity
ctnd of electricity into light, and gen
eration of radioactive particles hith
erto unknown.
The slides will show some of these
events and the scenes where they are
studied.
Professor at Stanford
A graduate of the University of
Chicago in 1911, Dr. Darrow re
ceived his Ph.D. there in 1917. He
served as acting professor of physics
at Stanford in the summer of 1929.:
in 1931, at the University of Chicago;
in 1932, at Columbia University. In
1941 Dr. Darrow served as William
Allan Neilson professor at Smith
College.
In a book entitled "The Renais
sance of Physics" Dr. Darrow has
embodied a series of public lectures
which he gave at the Lowell Insti
tute. He is also secretary of the
American Physical Societv.
