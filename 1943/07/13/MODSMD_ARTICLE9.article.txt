## Russian Play Opens Thurs.

"The only way to explain the title
of 'Squaring the Circle,' the Stan
ford Players' first summer production
to be given in the Little Theater
starting tomorrow night at 8:11 and
continuing through Saturday, is to
tell the plot of the story," said David
Sievers, director, when asked if he
was a member of the mathematics
faculty because of the play book he
carried.
'"Two young Muscovites share a
dilapidated tenement room, loaned to
them by the poet, Emilian. Vasya, the
studious one, has just married Lud
milla, a pretty, kittenish girl, de
scribed as a 'Bourgeois degenerate'
while his comrade, Abram, who
thinks more of food than of Marx,
has just married Tonya, a deadly
serious, though attractive girl," Mr.
Sievers said.
"Four-in-One-Room"
"Each brings his bride back, un
known to the other, promising her a
spacious apartment. In the midst of
adjustments to this four-in-one-room
situation, Emilian returns, full of
poetry and muscle, and decides to
stay to watch 'the building of social
ism in one room—a collective of do
mestic bliss'," Mr. Sievers added.
"The complicated situation soon
makes clear that both couples are
mis-mated. Abram and Ludmilla are
two of a kind, and so are Tonya and
Vasya," he continued.
Interlocked Triangle
"So instead of a triangle play,"
said Mr. Sievers, "it is a play of two
interlocked triangles; or, in other
words, a sort of emotional ring
around-the-rosy circle in need of
.squaring—or shall we say in need of
resolving into two two-sided fig
ures?"
Although the plot of the play is
really only a clever variation on the
usual English or American farce
comedy, Valentine Kataev, the au
thor, has used it merely as a frame
work on which to satirize much of
the Soviet ideology.
"But Is It Ethical?"
Examples of this satire can be seen
when Abram finds himself in an
emotional involvement, and asks,
"But Ls it ethical?" and thumbs
through a manual for corroboration.
The lines of the other characters
also show this satire. Tonya does
not say, "You do not love me," she
says. "There is no worker's solidar
ity between us." All of the charac
ters think, "What would I do in this
situation if I were Lenin?"
Somber Costumes
Colorful Russian costumes of the
Ballet Russe type are out for the
duration of the play, according to
Hazel Brain and Muriel Lievsay,
speech and drama costumers.
At the time of the play, according
to Miss Lievsay, the first Five Year
Plan was well under way in Russia,
and not only were gay. frivolous
materials frowned upon, but they
were hard to get.
