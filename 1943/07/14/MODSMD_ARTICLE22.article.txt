# Americans Win All-Star Game
## 
### 
Led by Bobby Doerr's three-run
homer into the lower deck of the
Shibe Park stands in Philadelphia,
the American League team defeated
the National League aggregation,
5-3.
Try as he did. Vince DiMaggio
couldn't win the game by himself as
he led both teams in hitting with a
homer into the upper decks of left
field stands, 390 feet away, a triple
off the top of the boards and a single,
not going out once. Billy Herman
also made three hits.
Dutch Leonard started the game
for the winners and received credit
for the defeat. Mort Cooper, who just
can't beat the junior circuit, was
charged with the defeat.
Billy Southworth paraded four
pitchers to the mound in an effort to
stop the Americans.
