# LATE TIPS

### BY LATE WILLIAMS Don Langendorf 
The big sports question on and off
the Farm today seems to be whether
Stanford will or will not field a foot
ball team this fall. Dr. Wilbur says
that intercollegiate sports in general
is a "war casualty." The War De
partment won't allow the soldiers to
compete in college sports. The maxi
! mum number of civilian men that
will register next quarter has been
set at 700. And yet with all those
obstacles in the way, A 1 Masters,
graduate manager, has contracted for
three games to be played at Kezar
Stadium in San Francisco. Those
dates are for the San Francisco,
Santa Clara, and Southern California
| games.
With these difficulties facing him,
what could Mr .Masters have in mind
j by taking the dates he did? It could
be that he was taking out insurance
just in case we are going to field a
j team. The question remains as to
! what kind of a team we can field
with just about a fourth the number
of men that Stanford had last year.
| Examples of small colleges with
teams are Santa Clara and St. Mary's.
I However, our situation is much dif
i i'erent.
Let's have a look at other colleges
and universities with the Army on
their campus and see how they are
going to face the problem. The Uni
versity of San Francisco has been all
J but taken over by Army personnel
as has been the University of Santa
Clara, and yet we notice that they
1 are on our schedule. In other words,
i they plan to play football this year.
| Perhaps the quality of our team
! won't be as good as in previous
years, but we should attempt to play
ball this year as other teams intend
to do.
Great Team for U.S.C.
There is little doubt that if we have
! a team, it will be soundly trounced
; by Southern California, for they will
j have one of the best, if not the very
j best, team in their history. The Ma
! rines plus the Navy have taken over
I the U.S.C. campus and have sent
! them some of the best talent in the
I nation. The Trojans plan to use the
T-formation and they will have some
of the fastest backfield stars on the
l coast to kep it going. Besides the
| sophomore flash, Micky McCardle,
who is returning, Jackie Fellows,
| Fresno State's candidate for All-
American honors, has been stationed
at U.S.C. Anybody that heats them
will be doing quite well.
Navy, Marines at Cal
Look also for our cross-bay rivals,
; California, to have a team hard to
beat, as they will be reinforced by
j the Navy and the Marines. Many of
us can still remember the way Gro
ver "the Rover" Klemmer was in the
Indians hair in Berkeley Memorial
; Stadium last year. He will again be
' in our hair this fall as the Navy has
sent him back to his alma mater.
As for the other member of the
Coast Conference on our schedule,
U.C.L.A.. besides having the Army
stationed on their campus, the Navy
i has also moved which just about
| guarantees that they wiil have a
team, and a good team, this fall.
With these facts in mind, it looks
j as though Stanford is .going to have
a tough time winning a Coast Con
[ ference game this year, let alone a
| iion-conference game.
