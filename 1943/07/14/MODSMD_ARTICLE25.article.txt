## Gerona A.C. Gears Team For Sixth Straight Win 
### Late Williams 
Fourteen intramural Softball teams are scheduled to come out of their
corners fighting tonight when the sixth round of the round-robin gets 1
under-way.
As the teams stand now, the standings can practically change with each
pitch and umpire's decision. Even the league-leading Gerona A.C. club j

can drop into a tie for second with a - *
maze of teams if they drop their
game.
The A.C.'s will attempt to keep
their record clean when they tackle '
Tyler.
Jim Gault. who last year pitched
for Sigma Chi. will probably be on
the mound for the potential champs,
while Tyler will trust its fate to
Chuck Donkin.
In winning five straight games, j
Gerona has depended more on a tight
defense than pitching finesse and ;
hitting. It has paid oft' so far. and will
probably continue until their op
ponents begin hitting the ball where
they ain't.
Normal conditions are going to be
reversed when Buchanan tries to
squelch the Firehouse's fire, and the !
Firemen try to keep it going. The
winner of the game will automati
cally push the loser into third spot in
Lhe standings.
The Boat House Boys, who have
only dropped one game, face Hayes, '
and it might safely be said that when
the game has been completed, the
"Boys" won't have dropped another.
However, if Hayes had three fielders
and an infield, they might be able to
win a game before the season is over.
This is a questionable point.
Lincoln, a three-time winner and
a two-time loser, will cross bats
with the "now we're on and now
we're oft" Monroe club. The edge
goes to Lincoln, but Monroe was a
pretty tough man.
A toss-up is in store for the Gar
field-Cleveland game, with Cleve
land the likely choice to come out on
top. The crystal ball says so.
Fillmore's hitting its stride and
also its hat, but McKinley will be
fighting to revenge their last Mon
day's defeat. You take one team, and
we'll take the other.
The Coaches' Club looks'like the
winner in its Arthur contest. Chalk
it up to experience.
