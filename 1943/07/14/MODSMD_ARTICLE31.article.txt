FEELING that the soldiers stationed on the campus are part
of the student body and as such should receive The Daily,
we have been formulating plans to distribute it to them for sev
eral weeks.
Plan after plan bit the dust as financial and circulation prob
lems could not be wrinkled out. But finally a scheme to provide
The Daily for every soldier on campus, both ASTU's and STARs,
has passed the torture test. And we are pleased to announce that
distribution to the entire student body begins this morning on the
Quad.
To the many soldiers who came over to The Shack with sug
gestions for distribution, and to those who cooperated in plan
ning for the increased circulation, our sincere thanks. We hope
you are as glad to receive The Daily as we are to give it to you.
