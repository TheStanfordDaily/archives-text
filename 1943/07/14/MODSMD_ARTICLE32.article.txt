### BILL STRUTHERS 
It's funny how vivid experiences you have at a tender age
persist even into your adult college life. Take the time I learned
about engagement rings. It was back in the days when I was
going to shows and drinking milkshakes afterwards. A crowd
of us went into a creamery and were eating when the waitress
got just slightly friendly. I got tired of shouting "hey" at her
so I asked her what her name was.
Then hell broke loose. All of my friends jumped at me.
"Can't you see that single diamond ring on her third finger,
ieft hand? Don't you know that she's engaged? Are you the
kind of guy that goes around walking on other people's grass?
Are you the type of guy who pulls this love-making business on
other people's fiancees?" they asked me.
I told them I didn't think so, but it didn't do much good.
Right after that it got so I didn't speak to women who were
wearing engagement rings. It got so I'd cross the street or duck
into a clothing shop and buy a tie I didn't need just to avoid
speaking to someone whom I knew to be engaged.
Wedding rings didn't bother me so much. Nobody accused me
of making an advance at someone's wife, but just to make sure
I always called young married women Mrs. So-and-so.
Of course my life was somewhat narrowed by this awful
experience of my youth, but it really didn't start to cramp my
personality until lots of girls my own age became engaged.
Trying to be a "Cellar torpedo" was out of the question for me.
I kept running into engaged women whom I knew,
I was even assigned a seat next to one in a Winter Quarter
8 o'clock class. The professor didn't understand why I cut so
much and I think he thought it was hard for me to get up that
early. The truth is, I was disciplining myself. On the wall of
my room I would hang pictures from the society page of engaged
girls whom I had known. I would practice calling them by their
first names. On bright sunny mornings I would joke with them
and ask them why the hell they had become engaged. Then I
would confidentially tell them what a heel their fiance was.
In real life I only tried that a couple of times. It didn't take
me long to figure out that most of them thought quite a bit of their
fiances.
So I changed my approach. Nov/ I slap them on the back and
say, "What do you hear from the 8.F." "8.F." means boy friend
and they think I'm a card. The best of all, I've gotten over being
afraid of those rings. Which makes it easier to live on a campus
that is full of them.

going to shows and drinking milkshakes afterwards. A crowd
of us went into a creamery and were eating when the waitress
got just slightly friendly. I got tired of shouting "hey" at her
so I asked her what her name was.
Then hell broke loose. All of my friends jumped at me.
"Can't you see that single diamond ring on her third finger,
ieft hand? Don't you know that she's engaged? Are you the
kind of guy that goes around walking on other people's grass?
Are you the type of guy who pulls this love-making business on
other people's fiancees?" they asked me.
I told them I didn't think so, but it didn't do much good.
Right after that it got so I didn't speak to women who were
wearing engagement rings. It got so I'd cross the street or duck
into a clothing shop and buy a tie I didn't need just to avoid
speaking to someone whom I knew to be engaged.
Wedding rings didn't bother me so much. Nobody accused me
of making an advance at someone's wife, but just to make sure
I always called young married women Mrs. So-and-so.
Of course my life was somewhat narrowed by this awful
experience of my youth, but it really didn't start to cramp my
personality until lots of girls my own age became engaged.
Trying to be a "Cellar torpedo" was out of the question for me.
I kept running into engaged women whom I knew,
I was even assigned a seat next to one in a Winter Quarter
8 o'clock class. The professor didn't understand why I cut so
much and I think he thought it was hard for me to get up that
early. The truth is, I was disciplining myself. On the wall of
my room I would hang pictures from the society page of engaged
girls whom I had known. I would practice calling them by their
first names. On bright sunny mornings I would joke with them
and ask them why the hell they had become engaged. Then I
would confidentially tell them what a heel their fiance was.
In real life I only tried that a couple of times. It didn't take
me long to figure out that most of them thought quite a bit of their
fiances.
So I changed my approach. Nov/ I slap them on the back and
say, "What do you hear from the 8.F." "8.F." means boy friend
and they think I'm a card. The best of all, I've gotten over being
afraid of those rings. Which makes it easier to live on a campus
that is full of them.
It's funny how vivid experiences you have at a tender age
persist even into your adult college life. Take the time I learned
about engagement rings. It was back in the days when I was
going to shows and drinking milkshakes afterwards. A crowd
