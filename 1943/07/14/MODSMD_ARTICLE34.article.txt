# 'Y' Hostesses To Meet Friday
## 
### 
Feature topic for this Friday's
Y.W.C.A. discussion group of junior
hostesses will be "After the Ball Is
Over," with Mrs. Nielson and Georgi
anna Fitzgerald as the main speakers.
The group, which meets in the
Eucalypto Social Room at 1 o'clock
on Fridays, has sponsored two pre
vious programs, is an open discussion
of the problems arising for Stanford
women on campus with the pres
ence of several Army training units.
Last year, the hostess program was
designed to help the girls who vol
unteered for USO work in Palo Alto,
but in addition to that this year is
the slant toward friendliness on cam
pus with advice on what to wear,
how to act at the frequent open
houses and what is expected in the
way of conversation.
Especially interesting will be this
Friday's program, which deals with
problems of dating which often con
front the various social chairmen as
well as the students. Mrs. Nielson,
the first speaker, is the head of La
gunita and Geraldine Fitzgerald is
the president of Women's. Council.
It was stressed, however, that the
meeting will not center around the
Honor Code, but rather on the ques
tions facing Summer Quarter stu
dents.
In addition to the Friday meetings,
Miss Pat Davidson, "Y" head, has
begun a series of Sunday morning
breakfasts, the first of which was
held last Sunda3' at her home. The
groups, which are small, will usually
consist of a few soldiers and girls
plus a small number of the faculty
and it is hoped that gatherings of
this kind will bring about informal
friendships and meetings between
the students and soldiers.
