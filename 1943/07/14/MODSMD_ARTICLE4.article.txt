Illustrating his lecture with pho
tographic slides of actual radioactive
cosmo showers, Dr. Karl K. Darrow,
physicist and Secretary of the Amer
ican Physical Society, spoke on Cos
mic Rays at the Tuesday Series
program in the Memorial Audito
rium last night.
Stressing the ability of cosmic rays
to penetrate vast substances, Dr.
Darrow pointed out that cosmos are
active thousands of feet into the
earth, although their source is in
inter-stellar space.
Discovered by a German physicist
some 40 years ago, cosmic rays are
still mystifying scientists, and not a
great deal is known about their true
nature and origin.
"However, at present we're inter
ested in what we can observe in cos
mos. and not so much in their ori
gin," Dr. Darrow explained.
Apparently, cosmic rays have the
ability to spring out of the air, a
piece of lead, a block of wood, and
similar matter. Basically, their na
ture is electrical, and it is this prop
erty which allows the phenomenon
of cosmic showers to be photo
graphed.
Although cosmos do spring from
terrestial objects, Dr. Darrow ex
plained that physicists believe all
original cosmic energy comes from
the outer world. The
