# â€˜Flying Swede,' Gil Dodds Train at Stanford's Angell Field Yesterday
## 
### H. Leighton Williams 
Guilder Hagg, the great Swedish distance runner with the flying
blond hair, unexpectedly put in an appearance yesterday afternoon at
Stanford's Angel Field. Hagg was accompanied by Gil Dodds. the Boston
divinity student, who has been furnishing Hagg with most of his com
petition on his American tour.
Word of the great Swede's appearance began to spread throughout
the campus at about 12::!0, and by 1 p.m., there were approximately 100
students gathered at the field to view Ilagg for the first time.
Hagg was extremely quiet, except when asking questions of Kkell
Peterson, his manager for his tour. His English is limited to a few
phrases, thus all of his comments came by way of an interpreter.
When the two athletes stepped onto the track, the first words that
we heard Dodds mention were; "This is the same track that Ben Eastman
set his world records on." He referring to the year 1932 when Stan
ford's "Big Ben" stole the national spotlight by setting his 440-yard
record in 4(5.2, and his 880-yard mark on the same track.
Both runners "jogged" about a mile, Hagg in the lead, with Dodds
hugging the Swede's right shoulder. This was a warm-up for a fast
220. which both men sprinted neck-and-neck.
It was then that Hagg, wearing blue trunks and a yellow sweatshirt,
showed the meager audience the form that has carried him to interna
tional track fame.
Dodds was impressed with the track, and after Hagg had completed
his workout, he continued to jaunt around the oval for an additional
mile and a quarter.
This was probably the next to last warm-up before these two men
tangle in San Francisco's Kezar Stadium next Saturday and attempt to
break the present unofficial mile record of 4:02 6 set a short time ago
by Hagg's countryman. Arne Andersen.
