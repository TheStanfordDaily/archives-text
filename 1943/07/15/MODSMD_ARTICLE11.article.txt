## First Play Is Lively Farce 
### Adolph Gugel 
Sparked by lively dialogue and an'
abundance of amusing situations, the
Stanford Players' presentation of
Valentine Kataev's farce comedy,
"Squaring the Circle," proved an in
teresting as well as entertaining per
formance.
As far as the individual perform
ances are concerned, there were none
that were really outstanding, but on
an average, the play was fairly well
cast. The best performances, at leas*
as this reviewer sees it, were thost?
of Sally Stocker as the frivolous,
childish Ludmilla, and Roger Bran
der as the food loving Abram. Both
completely put themselves in their
parts and were the most convincing
of the cast.
Jean Levinson. who portrayed
Rabinova, a party organizer and a
dyed in the wool communist, was good
in the first act. but in the other two
acts was not as convincing as in the
first. Tom Flynn's portrayal of Emil
ian, the rougish and not very suc
cessful poet, was rather uneven, al
though at times good.
Although the play occasionally
pokes fun at things that Americans
can not so well appreciate, the plot
never loses its vitality. Taking every -
thing into consideration, "Squaring
the Circle" is quite good.
The play was directed by David.
Sievers and will run until Saturday
night.
The stage sets and costumes were
well done and gave the play much of
its atmosphere.
