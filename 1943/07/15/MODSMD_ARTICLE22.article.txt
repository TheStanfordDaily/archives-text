### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
"We'd heard about him. Wed
seen pictures of him. But yesterday
was the first time that we'd actually
seen him. The affair led us to be
lieve that Sweden really has some
thing there."
'"0.K., Williams, that's taken for
granted. What has the guy got that
makes liim make like an airplane.'
"That's what we were getting
around to. In the first place, he's
got legs like a runner. In the second
place, he's got form par-deluxe, and
in the third place, he is an airplane.
A human airplane."
"Did you talk to him."
"Well, yes and no. That is, we
talked to him indirectlyâ€”through
his manager, Kjell Peterson. For in
stance. we asked his manager how
fast Hagg had run the first half of
his 4:04.6 mile. Peterson, in turn,
turned to Hagg and spoke Swedish
lor a couple of minutes, and then
Hagg, in turn, spoke Swedish for a
couple of minutes. Finally, Peterson
looked at us and said, 'Gundar
doesn't know.' Very discouraging."
"Did (lie styles of Hagg and Dodds
compare."
"They were exactly the opposite
of each other. Hagg has that long
stride that makes him look as if he
were floating over the ground. Some
thing like the stride that Pittsburgh's
John Woodruff Used to use. Com
pletely relaxed. What a runner!"
"On the other hand, Dodds' style
of running employed power instead
of ease. On the Gregg Rice style.
The way he swung his arms as he
ran, reminded us a little of Louie
Zamperini. What a runner!"
"Do you think that Johnny Fulton
will be able to pace one of them to a
new world's record?"
"From what Peterson told me, Ful
ton might be able to pace Dodds to
a record, but it is doubtful if he
would have any effect on the way
Hagg runs. Peterson said that they
tried to pace him in Chicago, but
Hagg didn't pay any attention to the
guy. He plans his race beforehand,
and runs it like he plans it. If you
get what we mean."
"What do you think of Dodds'
chances of taking Guilder. Satur
day?"
"From what we saw yesterday,
we'd say that the race can go either
way, but our chips are resting on
Hagg. Could be wrong, though, Yup.
we could be wrong."
