### BILL STRUTHERS 
While driving across a small California valley, I stopped at
a railroad crossing. My engine and brain idled contentedly. The
putt of a tractor and the whistle fronxthe train dissolved into the
rhythm and melody from the rails. I watched the freight cars
pass me. My mind rambled and my eyes focussed on the dif
ferent names on the box-cars. . . .
Pennsylvania RR, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, Great-North
western-refrigerator-car-No. 37521998, and an empty flat car.
The fertile level soil waved with the heat. Foothills on both
sides of me were padded with a soft ill-fitting haze. The hot air,
the dry dirt, and the distant blue sky became a stage that couldn't
change. I took a deep breath that dried my lungs and flushed my
face. And I caught the trace of a gardenia. . . .
New York Central System, Rock Island, Baltimore £■ Ohio,
Southern Pacific, and a Texaco tank car.
The gardenia lay on the car floor dried and shrunken. Its
petals were brown and crisp. Last night it was different. And her
hair was blonde. And the stars were close. And the cigarette
butts in the ashtray: Half of them lipsticked. Half of them hers,
.half of them mine. And the echo of the things we had said over
them went through my head above the noise of the train. . . .
Soo Line, Central Pacific, Burlington Route, and a load of anti
tank guns crated except for their muzzles.
The car seemed to become alive. It shouted to me like a
friend across the Quad. The Indian sticker faded with four years
of sunshine, the soiled tux shirt that I should have taken to the
laundry three weeks ago, the worn binder and navigation book
beside me, the swim suit, the golf clubs, the empty coke bottles,
the delicious debris, the Irish stew of college that my car had
collected—that was me as I was that day. . . .
Pennsylvania, Chesapeake & Ohio, Western Pacific, Sacra
mento-Northern, S.P.
I thought of college, of college life, and of living life at college.
"I want to come back," I said aloud.
Then I thought of my friends who had graduated or gone to
war or both. I tried to imagine what they and I—what we would
be like after four of five years of war, after maturing with the
responsibility of a battle, after learning to use a gun, after cal
lousing our minds and becoming lopsidedlv sentimental at
the wrong time. How different from the men as I know them now.
How different from the roommate I call "Room-house," the guy
I spilled coffee on, and the guys I hash with at Lagunita. Yes,
how changed we will all be. . . .
Santa Fe, Canadian Pacific, New York Central-automobile
return-to-Detroit-when-empty, Southern Pacific, and a caboose
with a toy man standing on the platform.
And I sat there watching the train become smaller and feeling
weak and futile and knowing that once I had left college I couldn't
come back and find what I had left.

war or both. I tried to imagine what they and I—what we would
be like after four of five years of war, after maturing with the
responsibility of a battle, after learning to use a gun, after cal
lousing our minds and becoming lopsidedlv sentimental at
the wrong time. How different from the men as I know them now.
How different from the roommate I call "Room-house," the guy
I spilled coffee on, and the guys I hash with at Lagunita. Yes,
how changed we will all be. . . .
Santa Fe, Canadian Pacific, New York Central-automobile
return-to-Detroit-when-empty, Southern Pacific, and a caboose
with a toy man standing on the platform.
And I sat there watching the train become smaller and feeling
weak and futile and knowing that once I had left college I couldn't
come back and find what I had left.
While driving across a small California valley, I stopped at
a railroad crossing. My engine and brain idled contentedly. The
putt of a tractor and the whistle fronxthe train dissolved into the
rhythm and melody from the rails. I watched the freight cars
pass me. My mind rambled and my eyes focussed on the dif
ferent names on the box-cars. . . .
Pennsylvania RR, Southern Pacific, Santa Fe, Great-North
western-refrigerator-car-No. 37521998, and an empty flat car.
The fertile level soil waved with the heat. Foothills on both
sides of me were padded with a soft ill-fitting haze. The hot air,
the dry dirt, and the distant blue sky became a stage that couldn't
change. I took a deep breath that dried my lungs and flushed my
face. And I caught the trace of a gardenia. . . .
New York Central System, Rock Island, Baltimore £■ Ohio,
Southern Pacific, and a Texaco tank car.
The gardenia lay on the car floor dried and shrunken. Its
petals were brown and crisp. Last night it was different. And her
hair was blonde. And the stars were close. And the cigarette
butts in the ashtray: Half of them lipsticked. Half of them hers,
.half of them mine. And the echo of the things we had said over
them went through my head above the noise of the train. . . .
Soo Line, Central Pacific, Burlington Route, and a load of anti
tank guns crated except for their muzzles.
The car seemed to become alive. It shouted to me like a
friend across the Quad. The Indian sticker faded with four years
of sunshine, the soiled tux shirt that I should have taken to the
laundry three weeks ago, the worn binder and navigation book
beside me, the swim suit, the golf clubs, the empty coke bottles,
the delicious debris, the Irish stew of college that my car had
collected—that was me as I was that day. . . .
Pennsylvania, Chesapeake & Ohio, Western Pacific, Sacra
mento-Northern, S.P.
I thought of college, of college life, and of living life at college.
"I want to come back," I said aloud.
Then I thought of my friends who had graduated or gone to
war or both. I tried to imagine what they and I—what we would
