# Campus Opinion

To The Editor:
We thank you, Companies E and F, for the swell job you did
to give this campus a dance to remember! We thought the band
was terrific and would have made the dance a success by itself, :
but you made it even better by putting on a show. You-showed
us that you have talent and you made us laugh. It was great to
see "Lil' Injun" enjoying the festivities, and especially because
he has become a P.F.C.
Many of us felt that the Stanford Spirit was really there, not
as it used to be, but with a new element involved. It was you who 1
made your dance a Stanford dance—we are the ones to thank I
you.
