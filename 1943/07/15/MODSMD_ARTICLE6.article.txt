bridgehead which is an unbroken arc
6 to 30 miles deep around the south
eastern end of the island.
Eight thousand captives, including
many Germans from the crack Her
mann Goering division, fell to the
U.S. Seventh Army during fierce
fighting in the southwest sector
where American troops are now in
firm control of a 60-mile line from 8
to 20 miles deep.
The rest were captured by British
and Canadian troops, an announce
ment said, and it was disclosed here
for the first time —on the occasion of
the first unrestrained celebration of
Bastille Day since the fall of France
—that French forces are taking part
in the Sicily campaign.
The Allied bridgehead now ex

north of Augusta, which, an Allied
communique announced, fell this
morning around Cape Passero to
within a few miles of the big enemy
south coast base at Agrigento. Two
more air fields were added to the
lengthening list of conquests.
