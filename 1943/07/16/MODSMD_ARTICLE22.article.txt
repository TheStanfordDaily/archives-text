## Critic Praises De Mille Movie 
### 
REAP THE WILD WIND, Now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Cecil B. De Mille's spectacular
I "Reap the Wild Wind," winner of last
j year's Academy Award for techni
color photography, and recently re
| released at popular prices, was prob
ably one of the best four pictures of
j 1942.
J Packed with action, it features not
[ only an all-star cast, but what is
1 quite possibly the best color photog
i raphy in the history of the motion
picture industry. Of special interest
i to photography "fans" are the excel
lent under water scenes in the closing
| part of the picture.
Raymond Massey, who portrays
; "King" Cutler, leader of a band of
crooked ship salvagers, gave, as al
ways, a first rate performance. It
! would take up too much space to
: list all the actors and actresses who
! deserve mention. The leading parts
were played by Paulette Goddard.
Ray Milland, and John Wayne.
The film ends in a tremendous
j climax which includes a dramatic
j trial, a descent by divers into a sunk
en ship, a battle with a giant squid.
! some sort of a Caribbean tidal wave,
plus a little gun play to top it off.
Second feature was the Mercury
Players' "Journey into Fear," which.
; in spite of a mediocre plot, proved
j interesting because of the very dra
! matic way in which it was handled.
| the numerous unorthodox yet clever
shots, and many of Orson Wells'
other "tricks" of the trade. "Journey
into Fear" does not, however, keep
up to the high standard of the two
pictures done by the Mercury Play
j ers. —Gugel
