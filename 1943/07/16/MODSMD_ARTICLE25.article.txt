# Hagg, Dodds Gun for New World's Record Tomorrow
## 
### Don Langendorf 
San Francisco track fans are looking for a new world record in the mile
come tomorrow afternoon when they will be treated to the long awaited
meeting in the mile between Gunder Hagg, Sweden's gift to the track
world and holder of six world records, and Gil Dodds, Boston divinity
student and America's foremost miler. Also running will be Stanford's

Johnny Fulton, in there to set
pace for the first half-mile, and j
Bobby Madrid, the pride of Lemoore I
Army Air Field.
Hagg's Record Broken
Arne Anderson broke Hagg's I
world record by almost two seconds
and Hagg would like to regain the
mile title. He was persuaded to
choose San Francisco's Kezar Sta
dium as the spot to start his on
slaught. If anyone can force him to
a record, Gil Dodds should, as he is j
good for around 4:07.
Don't be too surprised though if it !
happens the other way around with I
the Swede forcing Dodds to the rec- j
ord. Dodds has been pointing for a !
win throughout their tour, and San
Francisco is as good a place as any
to beat Gunder. Anderson's record
stands at 4:02.G.
Other Stars Compete
Even without the. great Gunder,
the rest of the meet would be a I
drawing card in itself. In the pole 1
vault will be Dutch Warmerdam of !
the Del Monte Pre-Flight school
making another attempt at the "im- j
possible" 16-foot ceiling. Hal Davis, <
national sprint champion from Cali
fornia, will compete in the century
and furlong. There is a possibility
that Grover Klemmer, ClifT Bour
land and Fulton will meet in the 440.
Because of the interest in Sweden,
the mile race will be short-waved
across the Atlantic to that country.
There are still plenty of tickets to
be had at the Crane Hotel in San*
Francisco, and the Olympic Club in
the same city. Tickets may also be
bought at the stadium directly be
fore the meet.
