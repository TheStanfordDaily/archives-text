### BILL STRUTHERS 
My mother is a great gal. I've just decided that. You see it
:ook me a while to learn to appreciate her.
She's a big woman, but well proportioned. She has a way of
looking down her nose that makes you think of Queen Victoria
and Mussolini all at once. And she has a way of saying "NO"
that makes you certain she's never been to Pasadena J.C.
Last time I was home she was in top form.
"Where did you get those shoes? Were they cast off by one
of your fraternity brothers?" she asked me.
They were my school shoes and they were just getting com
fortable, but she wouldn't understand.
"I traded my good black ones for them," I said.
Then she eyed my beautiful, dirty, but not soiled, corduroys.
I shouldn't have worn them home. I knew it would be a tough
fight to get them back to school before she got them to the dry
cleaners. That night she won the battle. Next day after a two
hour search I found them under the mattress in the guest room.
Towards the end of the week they disappeared again. It was
close this time. I found them in the trunk of her car 10 minutes
before she was going to leave for the cleaners.
I solved the problem by taking them over to a friend whose
name I can not disclose. This guy let me keep my cords in his
garage till the quarter started.
One Sunday morning I was in the living room reading Terry
and the Pirates and shuffling a deck of cards. My brother and
some of his friends and my uncle and aunt dropped in and I got
a game of blackjack going.
I was eager to play and had to coax everybody into the game.
In spite of Mother's frowning I got a good game going. But I lost
heavily. Mom was all set to go into a 20-minute lecture on the
sin of gambling, when I got a phone call that let me get out the
back door.
The next blow came at dinner when she apologized to the
maid for my table manners.
"He got that way at college," Mom explained.
Yeah, Mother is a great woman if you understand her, but
just the same I spent most of my time watching Dad spade his
Victory garden.

just the same I spent most of my time watching Dad spade his
Victory garden.
My mother is a great gal. I've just decided that. You see it
:ook me a while to learn to appreciate her.
She's a big woman, but well proportioned. She has a way of
looking down her nose that makes you think of Queen Victoria
and Mussolini all at once. And she has a way of saying "NO"
that makes you certain she's never been to Pasadena J.C.
Last time I was home she was in top form.
"Where did you get those shoes? Were they cast off by one
of your fraternity brothers?" she asked me.
They were my school shoes and they were just getting com
fortable, but she wouldn't understand.
"I traded my good black ones for them," I said.
Then she eyed my beautiful, dirty, but not soiled, corduroys.
I shouldn't have worn them home. I knew it would be a tough
fight to get them back to school before she got them to the dry
cleaners. That night she won the battle. Next day after a two
hour search I found them under the mattress in the guest room.
Towards the end of the week they disappeared again. It was
close this time. I found them in the trunk of her car 10 minutes
before she was going to leave for the cleaners.
I solved the problem by taking them over to a friend whose
name I can not disclose. This guy let me keep my cords in his
garage till the quarter started.
One Sunday morning I was in the living room reading Terry
and the Pirates and shuffling a deck of cards. My brother and
some of his friends and my uncle and aunt dropped in and I got
a game of blackjack going.
I was eager to play and had to coax everybody into the game.
In spite of Mother's frowning I got a good game going. But I lost
heavily. Mom was all set to go into a 20-minute lecture on the
sin of gambling, when I got a phone call that let me get out the
back door.
The next blow came at dinner when she apologized to the
maid for my table manners.
"He got that way at college," Mom explained.
Yeah, Mother is a great woman if you understand her, but
just the same I spent most of my time watching Dad spade his
Victory garden.
