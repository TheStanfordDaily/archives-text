# Rathbun Leads Honor Code Student Panel
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Professor Harry Rathbuti, chair
man of the student-faculty panel
discussion on the Honor Code held
in the Education Auditorium last
night, observed that what happens
to our Honor Code should be of the
greatest importance to Stanford stu
dents.
"The Honor Code is one aspect of
freedom and democracy . . . neither
can exist anywhere without respon
sibility assumed by members of the
group."
Panel Members
Members of the panel were Mrs.
Frances Neilson, director of Lagunita
and former president of Women's
Council; Georgiana Fitzgerald, presi
dent of Women's Council; Pat Thur
esson, president of Roble; Professor
Harold Bacon of the mathematics
department; Bill Struthers, president
of Men's Council.
Question; Is the Honor Code work
ing satisfactorily at Stanford?
Professor Bacon: "Book reports,
themes, term papers have whole
paragraphs lifted with no references
cited and entirely irrelevant foot
notes. In such cases the Honor Code
is not as workable as in formal ex
aminations."
Miss Fitzgerald
Mr. Struthers: "Men accept the
Honor Code and don't realize they
should turn people in."
From the floor: "Professors have
let down, too, when they ask that
students stay in the room to take
the exams."
Miss Fitzgerald: "So much trouble
has occurred because of suspected
violations that this precaution is
taken for the safeguard of the stu
dents."
From the floor: "Nine out of ten
students wouldn't report an infrac
tion in any case. We shouldn't have
this responsibility a part of the Honor
Code when students never intend to
uphold it."
Miss Fitzgerald: "Until we accept
the responsibility the Honor Code
is not working."
Mrs. Neilson: "Some people think
it is wrong to take the Honor Code
from its high plane and make it ap
ply to everything."
Miss Fitzgerald: "Women have the
entire responsibility of enforcing the
Honor Code socially. Men have no
comparable responsibility."

to our Honor Code should be of the
greatest importance to Stanford stu
dents.
"The Honor Code is one aspect of
freedom and democracy . . . neither
can exist anywhere without respon
sibility assumed by members of the
group."
Panel Members
Members of the panel were Mrs.
Frances Neilson, director of Lagunita
and former president of Women's
Council; Georgiana Fitzgerald, presi
dent of Women's Council; Pat Thur
esson, president of Roble; Professor
Harold Bacon of the mathematics
department; Bill Struthers, president
of Men's Council.
Question; Is the Honor Code work
ing satisfactorily at Stanford?
Professor Bacon: "Book reports,
themes, term papers have whole
paragraphs lifted with no references
cited and entirely irrelevant foot
notes. In such cases the Honor Code
is not as workable as in formal ex
aminations."
Miss Fitzgerald
Mr. Struthers: "Men accept the
Honor Code and don't realize they
should turn people in."
From the floor: "Professors have
let down, too, when they ask that
students stay in the room to take
the exams."
Miss Fitzgerald: "So much trouble
has occurred because of suspected
violations that this precaution is
taken for the safeguard of the stu
dents."
From the floor: "Nine out of ten
students wouldn't report an infrac
tion in any case. We shouldn't have
this responsibility a part of the Honor
Code when students never intend to
uphold it."
Miss Fitzgerald: "Until we accept
the responsibility the Honor Code
is not working."
Mrs. Neilson: "Some people think
it is wrong to take the Honor Code
from its high plane and make it ap
ply to everything."
Miss Fitzgerald: "Women have the
entire responsibility of enforcing the
Honor Code socially. Men have no
comparable responsibility."
