# 'Squaring Circle' To End Tomorrow
## 
### 
Repeating the fine performance of
opening night, the Stanford Players
last night gave their second presen
tation of "Squaring the Circle" in
the Little Theater. The play, a Rus
sian farce, will be presented tonight
and tomorrow at 8:15 p.m.
The play, written by Valentine
Kateav—known for his satiric novels,
especially "The Embezzlers." a Book
of the Month selection in this coun
try—is a clever variation on the
usual American farce-comedy theme,
according to David Sievers, director.
The plot involves four young Rus
sians in a series of farcical situations
arising out of the Five Year Plan,
the housing shortage, and Soviet
marriage and divorce ethics. The
play satirizes much of Soviet ideol
ogy, but was accepted in Russia in
a spirit of good-natured self-criti
cism.
The members of the speech and
drama department who helped in the
production of the play were William
Girvan, stage designer; Philomene
Trotter, stage manager; Theo Lin
hari, lighting; Cecelia Bergeda. An
nabelle Anderson, Charlotte Clary,
and Agnes Howe, lighting assistants.
Margaret Coope and Helen Rice,
properties; Sylvia Hyde, sound
effects: Sil Onesti. stage carpenter;
Hazel Brain and Muriel Lievsay,
costumes, and Althea Brown, costume
assistant.
