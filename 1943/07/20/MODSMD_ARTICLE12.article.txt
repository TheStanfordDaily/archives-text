Toyon Hall, now the Army's own,
houses what might bo termed the
most colorful company in the world
.short of the Foreign Legion. Com
pany G, an area-language group,
represents a league of languages
trom Swedish to Arabic and Hindu
stan to Dutch. Company men not
only speak the languages fluently but
in many cases have lived in or were
natives of the country.
A great portion of the continental
Europeans were swept from one Eu
ropean country into another by Hit
ler's rapid initial "expansion," and
;so added new languages to their
repertory.
Each man has some college educa
tion with schools such as Harvard,
Yale, Columbia, and Stanford repre
sented. The Army has the material

I tu turn out a group of elite officers,
[ well versed in the language, culture,
| government and geography of the
countries under their study.
It is not unusual to hear at 6:15 in
the morning when the first whistle
blows Corporal Brown asking sleep-
I ily in Japanese: "Nanda?" (What's
i up?)
"Ce sacre coup de sifflet." replies
! Pfc. Berger in French.
Corporal Youes, thereupon inquires
i in Arabic. "Kif Alak?" or "How are
' you?"
And Corporal Voge replies in
Serbo-Croatian, "Chvala dobro,"
"Thanks, 0.k."
Then at 6:30 a.m. the sleepy crowd
"falls out" under such colorful eb
clamations as "Verflucht, "Zut alors,"
"Caramba," "Pshacrerff."
The Army has curtailed such wide
and unbridled cosmopolitanism and
has divided the company into a Eu
ropean and an Asiatic group. The
former gives instruction in German
and Italian and the latter in Japa
nese, Chinese, and Malay. The
courses are intensive and comprise
as much of the natural environment
and culture of the area as is possible.
Soon we may hear the platoons pass
by drilling in Pidgin English.
These hard-working "G.1." at
Stanford are waiting for the day
when they can use their hard
earned knowledge of the enemy to
; the enemy's best disadvantage.
