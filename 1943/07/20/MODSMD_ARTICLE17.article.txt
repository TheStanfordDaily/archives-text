### 
ACTION IN THE NORTH ATLAN-to lever pitch at these points.

TIC —Now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
Warner Brothers spent much time
and money filming "Action in the
North Atlantic," with the result that
this tense drama of the heroic efforts
of the seamen in America's merchant
marine is a really "big" picture—
both in entertainment value and pro
duction cost.
Humphrey Bogart is first mate and
Raymond Massey is the skipper of a
new Liberty ship headed through
treacherous North Atlantic waters to
Murmansk. En route their vessel en
counters a sub pack and Nazi dive
bombers, besides being ravaged by
a devastating fire. Excitement runs

Bogart and Massey both turn in
their usual stellar performances,
while Julie Bishop, an attractive
newcomer portraying Bogart's wife,
and Alan Hale, as a boisterous crew
member, are good in supporting
roles.
The only criticism of the picture
is its excessive length, as the two
and one-quarter hour running time
will evidence. Good photography
and a fine musical score help in the
rough spots which a picture of this
length inevitably has.
"Lady Bodyguard." a fluffy little
comedy starring Eddie Albert and
Anne Shirley, completes the double
bill.—Bower
