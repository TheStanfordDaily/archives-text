## MURAL SOFTBALL Fillmore Drops Undefeated Gerona A.C. by 4-1 Score 
### 
The impossible has finally hap
pened. Gerona A.C.. victor over the
Boat House Boys and the Firehouse
and heretofore undefeated, was fi
nally humbled at the hands of Fill
more Hall.
Gerona took a one-run lead in the
first inning by combining a hit with
two errors. It wasn't long before
Fillmore came back to score four
runs and put the game on ice.
After the first inning, Wayne Price
allowed only one hit, making only
two hits in all for Gerona.
Only three errors were made
throughout the entire game, as both
teams played heads-up ball. The
final score was 4 to 1.
Hayes Wins a Game
Yes, another unheard-of thing
happened last Friday night. Hayes
Hall won a game. In their first vic
tory of the season, Hayes dumped
a team made up of Arthur Hall and
the Boat House Boys, whose game
with Cleveland was postponed, by
the score of 17 to 12.
After pitching his heart out all
season long, Ted Noble of Hayes
was finally rewarded as his team
mates gave him a little support both
in the field and at bat. Even Smoke
Morrison couldn't stop the onslaught
as the winners batted around in the
final inning to tally 7 runs. Hayes
jumped into the lead in the first in
ning by scoring 7 runs. They coasted
from there on until they were
threatened in the late innings as
Arthur attempted to catch up. Then
came Smoke Morrison and the ex
plosion.
Other Games Friday
In other games, the Firehouse

team was victorious over the
Coaches' Club. Garfield Hall de
feated McKinley Hall by default.
Monroe climbed closer 1o the top
with a win over the slipping Bu
chanan Hall. Lincoln was definitely
in this time as they defeated Tyler.
Last Night's Games
The team that played sensational
j ball last Friday night, the team that
I upset the Gerona A.C.. the team that
i could be up on top, lost last night to
the aggregation from Lincoln Hall.
1 That team is Fillmore Hall. That
I goes to show that in the Presidents'
i League anything can happen.
Going into the last of the sixth
j by five to two, Fillmore just could
j not hold back the Lincoln power.
Lincoln scored six runs that in
ning to take the lead and the game.
Final score was 8 to 6.
Gerona came back onto the vic
tory trail by taking an 11 to 8 deci
sion over McKinley Hall. They
scored 11 runs in the first two in
nings and couldn't touch pitcher
Bob Barber after that. McKinley
packed away at that lead for the
rest of the game but Gerona's Jim
Gault was able to hold them in
check.
In the closest game of the eve
ning, Monroe took a 9 to 8 win over
the Coaches' Club. The coaches
started with only three men but
were able to pick up more men as
the game progressed. Late WilliAms
kept his hitting streak alive by col
lecting four hits in four times at
bat. He has now hit seven consecu
tive times.
Cleveland Hall made it four vic
| tories in a row by defeating the Ar
j thur Hall team in a wide-open game
16 to 13. Arthur has so far not been
able to win a ball game in the league
all season. Cleveland used several
pitchers, but Arthur only used one,
j Dick Bartle.
Hayes Hall went back to its regu
| lar methods last night and lost. This
i time they lost to the Firehouse as
Olie Baer shut them out 9 to 0 al
lowing two hits as only one player
reached third base. Ted Noble was
the losing pitcher.
"Smoke" Morrison pitched the
t Boat House Boys to another win,
this time over the Garfield team.
Dick Wilbur was the losing pitcher
with the score 7 to 1.
Buchanan versus Tyler was post
poned.
