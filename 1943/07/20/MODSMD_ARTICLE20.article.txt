# LATE TIPS

### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
We caught the trackmeet at San
Francisco last Saturday, and about
the only thing that we got out of it
was a cold. Kezar Stadium was like
a wind tunnel at Lockheed.
Everybody in the press box had a
pretty good idea before the meet
began that there weren't going to
be any records broken. That was
obvious.
The track itself is probably the
slowest one on the Coast, and this
coupled with the cross winds, tail
head winds, and a few whirl
winds that the contestants had to
face, brought the meet from the sen
sational class down to the ordinary
class.
Gunder Ilagg, while not breaking
any records, gave the crowd a thrill,
just because he was Gunder Hagg,
and nothing else. The story of the
mile run that day is past history, so
there is no use elaborating on it. We
join in with ''Dink" Templeton in
wishing that Hagg had run a mile on
Angell Field.
They had a classic field announcer,
an army officer, who continually kept
getting races, contestants, heights,
times, and distances mixed up.
Instead of announcing the events
and what lane the contestant was
running in, he would describe the
whole affair, explaining that the
lanes were numbered from the in
side of the track, or the north side
of the stadium, and proceed to give
the life history of every runner, cli
maxing his performance with a typi
cal Clem McCarthy broadcast from
the start to the finish. Very boring,
but it followed in the general pat
tern of the meet, so we guess it's all
right.
The 440 could have been a lot bet
ter if Johnny Fulton had decided to
run against Cliff Bourland. As it
turned out, the race ended up with
the S.C. flash counting the-house as
he crossed the finish line.
We might add that if Fulton had
had any ideas as to pacing Hagg and
Dodds for the first half mile, he
didn't have them twenty feet from
the start. All of the runners got off
to a fast break, and Fulton had all
he could handle trying to keep up
with them. He was in it until about
the three-quarter mark, and then he
couldn't resist doing the old el foldo
act. It wasn't his fault, but the fault
of the men who finished one-two.
Just before the meet got under
way, the field announcer (here
comes that man again) stated that
the wind velocity was under the
AA.U. limit, and that all records
would be official. Just as he com
pleted the sentence, the "official
wind" blew the cross bar of the pole
vault off the standards, and about
30 feet from the pit. Timely.
Irving Moore of the Olympic Club
cleared 15 feet in the vaulting event,
but two men were holding the bar
in place with poles at the time. As
our friend with the microphone said,
"Moore's vault will not be allowed."
