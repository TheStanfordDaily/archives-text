QUOTING Madame Chiang Kai-shek, in an address at Welles
ley College:
. . With the riches of the ages within your grasp, with the
.vide field of specialized branches of knowledge to be had at
your will, with the maturity of mind to be gained in your contacts
with your professors and advisors, you should beware of
machine-made processes of thinking.
"Do not be afraid to strike out and explore the fertile realm
of your own minds and let them lead you in your conclusions to
what they will, so long as you are true and honest to yourself.
"This present world struggle is a battle of light against dark
ness, of justice and right dealing against selfishness and greed.
Indehiscence and mawkish maunder will not equip us for our
battle through life. Stern days are still ahead. Yet within these
very portals is the cenote of learning. It is here where your
strength could be reinforced."
Though Madame < Chiang's words are directed to a special
of students, they should be realized as commands to those
of us still fortunate enough to be in college. As a very small
privileged group, we will do well to heed the advice of one who
so closely understands the value of education.
Let us take full advantage of the situation we are in. For the
mentally lackadaisical breed the evils of today, and it is only
by translating thoughts into action that we differ from animals.
