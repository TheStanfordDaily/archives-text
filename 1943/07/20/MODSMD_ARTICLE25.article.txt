### BILL STRUTHERS 
Monday morning and you wonder why. There's fuzz on your
teeth and fog on your brain. Your pen won't take notes and
you're sorry you went to class. The world is a spoonful of honey
that you can't get to your bread without soiling the table cloth
or getting your fingers sticky. The world is a piece of gum on
the sole of your shoe. Take it off if it bothers you; leave it on if
you're too tired.
And have another cup of coffee and think of why it was all
right to cut that last class. And learn about things.
Learn about the Third Pan American Conference of Santiago
of 1922. Learn about the prime meridian of the celestial sphere.
Learn how to change British Thermal Units into calories. Learn
to conjugate the verb dormir into the past subjunctive tense.
And tell your friends you're feeling fine at the same time
you're cussing the size of your head.
It's still Monday so you yawn instead of smile, grunt instead
of talk, scribble instead of write, and don't think about it. Think
about the weekend and the things you did that weren't important.
Forget the studying you should have done, the paper you should
have written, and the earlier bus you should have caught.
But the weekend is over and you've got to get started. You've
got work to do. So try running around the block. Try singing
"Buckle down Winsocki." Try lacing your shoes so tight that
your feet hurt and you can't stand still. Wash your face again,
but this time use cold water.
But do it right away. You've got to get going because this is
Monday morning and in America we work from Monday to
Saturday, and we've got to be ready to play hard next weekend.
