# English Prof Gives Cadets Math Course

### Ed Gribi 
English professors traditionally
aren't supposed to know anything
other than how to not split infinitives
and that prepositions are bad to end
a sentence with. The University,
however, has at least one member of
its English department whose talents
go beyond English. He is Professor
James Cunningham, erstwhile math
instructor at the Santa Ana Air Corps
Replacement Center.
Professor Cunningham taught re
fresher courses in mathematics for
nine months from September 1942 to
June 1943, to the aviation cadets in
training at the center. He received
the same pay as regular Army offi
cers and lived the regular Army post
life except that he was not a member
of the armed forces.
Classes Differed
The classes differed from the usual
college classes in the strict military
discipline and the speed of turning
out the men. Professor Cunningham
estimates that over 1,000 students
passed through his classes in the
nine-month period, so that he didn't
get to know any of them. The actual
classes themselves were composed of
from 45 to 60 cadets and were held
four times a week. They lasted from
four to six weeks, depending on the
educational policy of the Air Corps
at the time.
The course covered arithmetic, ele
mentary algebra, certain phases of
"geometry, and vectors as applied to
navigation. The class time was com
posed mostly of working problems
and very little lecturing was done.
According to Professor Cunning
ham, the bulk of the cadets were
very weakly prepared in basic math
ematics and even after the intensive
course, many of them were still, in
his opinion, unable to work the com
plex problems found in the operation
of modern military aircraft. He at
tributes this appalling dearth of
mathematical knowledge mainly to
the system of education in the sec
ondary schools and suggests that ad
vanced mathematics could be taught
in high schools, thus giving students
much more time for other subjects
in military or college training as the
case may be.

a sentence with. The University,
however, has at least one member of
its English department whose talents
go beyond English. He is Professor
James Cunningham, erstwhile math
instructor at the Santa Ana Air Corps
Replacement Center.
Professor Cunningham taught re
fresher courses in mathematics for
nine months from September 1942 to
June 1943, to the aviation cadets in
training at the center. He received
the same pay as regular Army offi
cers and lived the regular Army post
life except that he was not a member
of the armed forces.
Classes Differed
The classes differed from the usual
college classes in the strict military
discipline and the speed of turning
out the men. Professor Cunningham
estimates that over 1,000 students
passed through his classes in the
nine-month period, so that he didn't
get to know any of them. The actual
classes themselves were composed of
from 45 to 60 cadets and were held
four times a week. They lasted from
four to six weeks, depending on the
educational policy of the Air Corps
at the time.
The course covered arithmetic, ele
mentary algebra, certain phases of
"geometry, and vectors as applied to
navigation. The class time was com
posed mostly of working problems
and very little lecturing was done.
According to Professor Cunning
ham, the bulk of the cadets were
very weakly prepared in basic math
ematics and even after the intensive
course, many of them were still, in
his opinion, unable to work the com
plex problems found in the operation
of modern military aircraft. He at
tributes this appalling dearth of
mathematical knowledge mainly to
the system of education in the sec
ondary schools and suggests that ad
vanced mathematics could be taught
in high schools, thus giving students
much more time for other subjects
in military or college training as the
case may be.
