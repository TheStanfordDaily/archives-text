# Carnival Set For August 13 By War Board
## 
### 
A carnival, much like the Sopho
more Carnival of pre-war Stanford
days, will be held by the War Board
on Friday, Aug. 13, from 7:15 to 11:15,
according to Betty May Hale, War
Board coordinator. Ticki Elston is
in charge of the concessions and the
Y.W.C.A., Klahoya, Stanford Daily,
will each have a booth, and Lagunita,
Roble, men's halls (under Dick Bar
tie), and the Army (under Jack
Pickering) have signed up for two
concessions.
With all profits going toward the
Dimes for Diplomas Drive, Caidinals
will donate the food which will be
sold by uniformed students at the
Red Cross canteen. Admission will
be a package of cigarettes for men
and a '"bauble for buddies" from
women, all of which will be sent
overseas.
Play concessions will begin at 7:15
and continue until 8:30. Then there
will be dancing in the Gym to rec
ords, jive and romantic numbers,
until 10:30, at which time the pro
gram will start. It's still a secret as
to just what the program will be, but
according to Miss Hale, it will be
good as will be the surprises given
at the concessions and at the end of
the program.
Everyone will be asked to go over
the Esquires, New Yorkers, etc.. and
with the aid of paste and scissors,
glue their best contents into scrap
books. Those men and women who
do the best and most work in 15
minutes will be given an honorable
mention.
"This will be like the soph carni
val, but with a new spirit of Stan
ford at war," said Miss Hale. "I'd
appreciate it if anyone having an
idea for a concession could let me
know about it by Fridav."
