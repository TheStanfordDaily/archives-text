# Quartet Opens Group Of Concerts
## 
### Steve Benedict 
The London String Quartet is with
us again. The first of a series of four
concerts by the re-constituted en
semble took place in Memorial Hall
Auditorium yesterday evening, with
quartets of Cherubini, Brahms, and
Haydn making up the program.
The seldom-heard Cherubini
quartet, the second in C major,
proved to be a delightful opener with
its pungent rhythms. The four brief
movements were tossed off by the
Londoners with an aplomb which
bespoke of a true insight into the
music's lighthearted and jovial char
acter.
Brahms' Opus 51
Next in program order came the
somber-hued but exhilarating Opus
51, No. 1 in C minor of Brahms.
Written in Vienna in 1873 and dedi
cated to the famous Viennese sur
geon and amateur violinist, Theodor
Billroth, the work reveals Brahms
at his most austere. This "severe
simplicity" makes the quartet more
accessible than many of Brahms'
works in the larger forms, yet still
proving as satisfying as the incom
parable symphonies and concertos or
the Requiem.
Realize Character
The men of the London seemed to
realize much of the music's essential
character, notwithstanding an occa
sional lapse in cohesiveness and bal
ance due, no doubt, to limited re
hearsal time. But it was an out
standing performance and certainly
the high spot of the evening's music
making. The Romanze Poco Adagio
was done superbly and will long re
main in this writer's memory.
The concert concluded with
Haydn's lovely B Flat Quartet, Opus
71. No. 2. Haydn's compositions in
the quartet idiom are his greatest
creative products. Few musicians
will dispute this statement. Of last
night's quartet you remark that it
is superficial? Yes, perhaps, but
what an engrossing superficiality it
is! The music seems almost to be
scoffing at us for attempting to make
of it something it is not.
Spirited Conclusion
The four men gave the work the
dashing vitality and enthusiasm it
required for a compelling exposition
of its contents, bringing the evening
to a spirited conclusion.
The second program is scheduled
for next Friday evening at 8 o'clock
and lists quartets by Mozart. Brahms,
and the modern Australian composer,
Ernst Toch.

will dispute this statement. Of last
night's quartet you remark that it
is superficial? Yes, perhaps, but
what an engrossing superficiality it
is! The music seems almost to be
scoffing at us for attempting to make
of it something it is not.
Spirited Conclusion
The four men gave the work the
dashing vitality and enthusiasm it
required for a compelling exposition
of its contents, bringing the evening
to a spirited conclusion.
The second program is scheduled
for next Friday evening at 8 o'clock
and lists quartets by Mozart. Brahms,
and the modern Australian composer,
Ernst Toch.
The London String Quartet is with
us again. The first of a series of four
concerts by the re-constituted en
semble took place in Memorial Hall
Auditorium yesterday evening, with
quartets of Cherubini, Brahms, and
Haydn making up the program.
The seldom-heard Cherubini
quartet, the second in C major,
proved to be a delightful opener with
its pungent rhythms. The four brief
movements were tossed off by the
Londoners with an aplomb which
bespoke of a true insight into the
music's lighthearted and jovial char
acter.
Brahms' Opus 51
Next in program order came the
somber-hued but exhilarating Opus
51, No. 1 in C minor of Brahms.
Written in Vienna in 1873 and dedi
cated to the famous Viennese sur
geon and amateur violinist, Theodor
Billroth, the work reveals Brahms
at his most austere. This "severe
simplicity" makes the quartet more
accessible than many of Brahms'
works in the larger forms, yet still
proving as satisfying as the incom
parable symphonies and concertos or
the Requiem.
Realize Character
The men of the London seemed to
realize much of the music's essential
character, notwithstanding an occa
sional lapse in cohesiveness and bal
ance due, no doubt, to limited re
hearsal time. But it was an out
standing performance and certainly
the high spot of the evening's music
making. The Romanze Poco Adagio
was done superbly and will long re
main in this writer's memory.
The concert concluded with
Haydn's lovely B Flat Quartet, Opus
71. No. 2. Haydn's compositions in
the quartet idiom are his greatest
creative products. Few musicians
will dispute this statement. Of last
