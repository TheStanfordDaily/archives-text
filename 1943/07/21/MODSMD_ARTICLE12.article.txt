# PENICILLIN
## Clifton Finds New Process 
### 
Penicillin, one of the new "wonder
| drugs," is the object of research car
i ried on by Dr. Charles E, Clifton,
I professor of bacteriology at Stanford
I University. After working for sev
eral months, Dr. Clifton finally suc
| ceeded in developing a process for
| producing and preventing the de
-1 terioration of this substance, which
' is a product of a mold commonly
found in bread.
The culture medium may not ex
| ceed one inch in depth, and even the
| slightest changes in its nature will
affect the yield, whose maximum is
| less than one gram in one liter of
! medium for one week.
Though not a substitute for sulfa
drugs, it is much more active and is
used in those places where sulfono
mides have no effect. Penicillin is
much better in that it produces none
of the ill effects of sulfa.
Cases of gonorrhea have been
cured in 24 hours by penicillin after
sulfonomides have had no effect on
them. It may also be injected di
rectly into the blood stream or be
neath the skin, and may even be
used locally on wounds, without in
juring the normal processes of the
body or preventing the growth of
| new cells, which is necessary in re
pairing wounds and burns.
An advantage over such common
antiseptics as iodine, silver nitrate,
| and bichloride of mercury is its
ability to penetrate to the actual sites
| of bacterial multiplication and start
work at the source of infection.
Recent research indicates that peni
! cillin may be a complex member of
! the aromatic, or coal-tar, group of
' compounds, and may eventually be
synthesized from coal-tar derived
compounds. When the exact struc
ture is known, work may be carried
on with greater rapidity, and perhaps
a substitute compound, structurally
| simpler and equally as active, will be
found.

Recent research indicates that peni
! cillin may be a complex member of
! the aromatic, or coal-tar, group of
' compounds, and may eventually be
synthesized from coal-tar derived
compounds. When the exact struc
ture is known, work may be carried
on with greater rapidity, and perhaps
a substitute compound, structurally
| simpler and equally as active, will be
found.
