### Vashti O'Donnell 
"All salvagable material, silk and
nylon stockings, rags, old clothes, tin
:ans, and scrap metal will be col
lected in one big drive at the end of
.he quarter," announced Beverly
Andreucetti, new salvage chairman,
is she clarified the collection of
campus salvage.
This quarter tin cans and light
metal will be collected from living'
groups and homes on campus on the
third Saturday of August by the
Peninsula Sanitary Company in con
junction with the Palo Alto tin can

, drive.
Central Depot Established
A central depot for scrap metal,
stockings, old clothes, and magazines
will be located in the Corporation
i Yard next to the office in the middle
of the yard. Campus residents are
asked to leave their salvage there,
| with the exception of tin cans, or to
phone the War Board office, local

Boxes will be placed in the halls of
Roble, Lagunita, and men's living
groups for this purpose. The commit
tee asks that students put their sal
vage in these and not in the Cor

Rubber Salvage
The Rubber Reserve Corporation,
j the federal agency entrusted with
the purchase of all rubber for re
claiming purposes, announces that
j efforts in rubber salvage can "at
least for the time being be suspend
l ed."
This finally eliminates demand for
all household and other miscellan
eous rubber items, as the supply of
this secondary scrap is ample, ac
cording to a letter from the office of
j rubber director which states:
"Considering the large tonnage of
scrap now available, it would seem
| unnecessary so far as the rubber
! program is concerned to continue the
activities of the Salvage Division in
j collection of scrap rubber."
Temporary Solution
A letter to the salvage committee
from Judge Edward P. Murphy,
I chairman, State Salvage Committee,
j stated that the suspension of salvage
J collection efforts merely indicates a
j temporary solving of the raw mate
! rial supply problem in respect to re
j claimed rubber but should in no case
be construed as an indication that
i scrap rubber may now be destroyed
j since in the future it may be needed.
The Rubber Reserve Company will
purchase truck and bus tires, pas
| senger tires, and inner tubes. For
j information regarding sale of tires
see local service stations.
All housewives on campus are
! urged to save cooking fats, oils, and
; grease as these can be salvaged and
I converted into glycerine and ammu-
I nition. Local butchers will buy them.
Arrangements for collection of
j heavy metal may be made by phon-
I ing the War Board office.

! urged to save cooking fats, oils, and
; grease as these can be salvaged and
I converted into glycerine and ammu-
I nition. Local butchers will buy them.

j heavy metal may be made by phon-
I ing the War Board office.
"All salvagable material, silk and
nylon stockings, rags, old clothes, tin
:ans, and scrap metal will be col
lected in one big drive at the end of
.he quarter," announced Beverly

is she clarified the collection of

junction with the Palo Alto tin can

, drive.
Central Depot Established
A central depot for scrap metal,
stockings, old clothes, and magazines
will be located in the Corporation
i Yard next to the office in the middle
of the yard. Campus residents are
asked to leave their salvage there,
| with the exception of tin cans, or to

groups for this purpose. The commit
tee asks that students put their sal

Rubber Salvage
The Rubber Reserve Corporation,
j the federal agency entrusted with
the purchase of all rubber for re
claiming purposes, announces that
j efforts in rubber salvage can "at
least for the time being be suspend
l ed."
This finally eliminates demand for
all household and other miscellan
eous rubber items, as the supply of
this secondary scrap is ample, ac
cording to a letter from the office of
j rubber director which states:
"Considering the large tonnage of
scrap now available, it would seem
| unnecessary so far as the rubber
! program is concerned to continue the
activities of the Salvage Division in
j collection of scrap rubber."
Temporary Solution
A letter to the salvage committee
from Judge Edward P. Murphy,
I chairman, State Salvage Committee,
j stated that the suspension of salvage
J collection efforts merely indicates a
j temporary solving of the raw mate
! rial supply problem in respect to re
j claimed rubber but should in no case
be construed as an indication that
i scrap rubber may now be destroyed
j since in the future it may be needed.
The Rubber Reserve Company will
purchase truck and bus tires, pas
