### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Mighty Gerona A.C. has finally
fallen. Once a team boasting of its
undefeated record, it is now fighting
to hold its place in a tie for first
spot.
The defeat last Friday was a sur
prise, but not an overwhelming one.
We saw it coining, and by gar it
came. Fillmore, and especially their
pitcher, Wayne Price, was keyed up
for that one game. If they don't
win another game all season, a hap
pening whic'h isn't likely, they can
dream of their one great moment.
While the Softball league at the
present moment looks like a three
way fight to the finish between the
Boat House Boys, Gerona, and the
Firehouse, it would be wise to keep
your eyes on the teams that are
gradually making their way up in
Ihe standings.
It is always possible for a team
sucb as Hayes or Tyler to clean up
on one of the high and mightys, and
send the victims power-diving into
the lower division.
Take the game coming on July
26 between the Coaches Club and
Gerona. By all logic, Gerona should
turn tlie table and teach the coaches
something that night, but if the ath
letic professors by fair means or foul
get mure than their usual three play
ers out on the field at the same time,
watch out. For their benefit, we will
state that there ai'e not three players
that go into the "making of a Softball
team, gentlemen, there are ten.
Than-Q.
On the same day, the Firehouse
is scheduled to cross cleats with the
B.H. Boys. If the outcome of this
battle doesn't change the league
standings, nothing short of a typo
graphical error will.
Quotes and Notes
Quote —From the Southern Cali
fornia Trojan comes, "It is rumored
that Troy's head man, Jeff Cravath.
will use two grid teams this fall. One
of the squads will be a "B" group,
made up of leftovers from the first
string." Continuing, "Main idea for
having a "B" team springs from the
fact that there will be no frosh this
coming season.
Note—Tough about frosh football
falling through. Jeff. Hard to take.
Quote —From the California Bruin
(U.C.L.A.), and referring to the cali
ber of coast football this coming sea
son, "According to reports from the
north, the Navy has done right well
for California, and Stanford has been
far from forgotten when Uncle Sam
dealt the cards."
Note — Well, what d'ya know.
Somebody must be wrong about
Stanford's football prospects, and it
isn't us. On the ball, Bruin.
Quote —From the Stanford Daily,
and discussing Ben Eastman. "He
was referring to the year 1932 when
Stanford's 'Big Ben' set the world
440 record in 46.2.'
Note—lt was "Blazing Ben," and
his time was 46.4. We should criti
cize?
