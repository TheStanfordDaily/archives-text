THE Stanford War Board has planned a carnival for August 13.
It's a good idea. Not only will it be a lot of fun, but it's for a
worthwhile cause.
The War Board is doing all it can to make it a success. How
aver, unless the entire campus gets behind this affair, it can't go 1
over either financially or as good entertainment.
There are soldier students here from colleges all over the :
country who must have different ideas for concessions and en- j
:ertainment. If they will contact Betty May Hale, War Board co
ordinator, and make suggestions, it will go a long way toward j
.making the carnival a whooping Success. —Jane Donald.
