### BILL STRUTHERS 
It's awfully easy to be pessimistic about the war. All you have
to do is talk to people who are more or less in the war. Get a
broad picture of it, then make a guess. Personally I predict the
war to last far into 1950.
Here's why, starting at the top. The Americans think that
they are winning the war for the British and vice versa. In the
United States, the Army thinks that they are doing all the work
and the Navy is getting all the credit and all the pay. Or vice
versa.
In the Army, the Infantry thinks that they are doing more to
win the war than the Air Corps, which is not aware of any
other branch in the entire Army.
Closer to home is the little grudge the STAR and the ASTU
units have. They seem to be able to find a few things to fight
about, including who really whistles at the Stanford women.
And there's more. The W.C.T.U. is fighting the other half.
The Parent-Teachers Association is fighting juvenile delinquency.
The minister at the Tenth Avenue Baptist Church is fighting sin.
The cops are fighting the robbers. Fathers with small families
are fighting their draft boards. Fellows at Fort Ord are re-fighting
the Civil War. My uncle is fighting an ulcer. And I am fighting
the B.A.C. for a medical excuse for Monday morning.
Now this obviously leaves too little time to devote io the war.
And obviously there are too many disagreements going on now,
BUTâ€”I know a guy, Merrill Peavy, who would make a good yell
leader if we need a yell leader when we have to fiqhi Cal next
fall. He is a not-too-serious guy who learned to lead yells at
Eakersfield High. So for him I challenge any other prospective
yell leader to a fight.
And don't say I didn't tell you it would be a loud fight and a
long war.
