# Russians Need Medical Texts
## 
### 
In response to requests from the
Russian Society for Cultural Rela
tions with Foreign Countries, the
Russian War Relief is making a new
appeal for contributions of medical
literature.
It is pointed out by Russian offi
cials that many Soviet schools of
medicine were evacuated thousands
of miles to Central Asia and the
Urals from Kharkov, Kiev, and other
occupied cities. In most cases libra
ries had to be left behind, and the
Russian War Relief is sending Amer
ican medical textbooks tp Russian
schools training surgeons and doc
tors for the front lines.
Many of these books sent from
America to these and other medical
schools were contributed by doctors
and medical associations from all
parts of the United States. They
range in subject from child develop
ment to neuroses in war.
All inquiries or gifts of medical
books should be sent to Russian War
Relief, Inc., 11 East 35th street, New
York 16, N.Y.
