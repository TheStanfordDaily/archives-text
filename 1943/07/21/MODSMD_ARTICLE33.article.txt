# Stickers Replace Licenses in 1944
## 
### 
The Department of Motor Vehicles
in Sacramento announced that the
1944 windshield stickers will have a
blue background with a small gold
seal of the State of California in the
center, and that each will be serial
ly numbered. These stickers will be
displayed in the lower right-hand
corner of the windshield and will be
oblong in shape, taking up a space
of about eight square inches.
These stickers were adopted by
Gordon H. Garland, director of the
Department of Motor Vehicles, as a
means of reducing the cost and of
saving precious steel for war pur
poses. Garland admonished motor
ists to take good care of the existing
license plates on their vehicles in
order that they may last all through
1944.
It will be impossible to remove
these stickers once they have been
put on the windshield, and they can
not be duplicated.
