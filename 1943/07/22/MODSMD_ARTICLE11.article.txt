### Aline Bubb 
Dr. Philip VV. Buck, professor of European area and languages school, said
in an interview with the Stanford Daily that he favored a joint council
handled by all Allied nations for the type of government which should be
established in Allied occupied territories.
Dr. Buck declared, "Even though difficulties of joint Allied actions are

great, the advantages of more than
one power handling the risks of gov
ernment far outweigh the weak
points of such a system."
At present the Sicilian government
in occupied territories is known as
AMGOT, Allied Military Govern
ment of Occupied Territories. Ger..
H. Alexander is in charge of
agency.
This temporary government was
set up shortly after the invasion o L .
this strategic island south of Italy.
The British and Americans are co
operating in the system; they have
removed the Fascists from office,
taken over food rationing, and other
governmental functions, in order to
assist the military units in the in
vasion.
Dr. Buck continued, '"We must re
vive local institutions and use them
to every advantage. Residents, as
far as is possible, should be permitted
to conduct their own governmental
affairs."
By reviving native constitutional
forms of government, the Allies wilt
have more cooperation from the
peoples in these occupied territories.
Thus self-government will be per
mitted in every possible instance.
Stanford's soldiers are playing a
large role in the future occupation
