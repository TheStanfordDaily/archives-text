### Aline Bubb 
Dr. Philip VV. Buck, professor of European area and languages school, said
in an interview with the Stanford Daily that he favored a joint council
handled by all Allied nations for the type of government which should be
established in Allied occupied territories.
Dr. Buck declared, "Even though difficulties of joint Allied actions are

great, the advantages of more than
one power handling the risks of gov
ernment far outweigh the weak
points of such a system."
At present the Sicilian government
in occupied territories is known as
AMGOT, Allied Military Govern
ment of Occupied Territories. Ger..
H. Alexander is in charge of
agency.
This temporary government was
set up shortly after the invasion o L .
this strategic island south of Italy.
The British and Americans are co
operating in the system; they have
removed the Fascists from office,
taken over food rationing, and other
governmental functions, in order to
assist the military units in the in
vasion.
Dr. Buck continued, '"We must re
vive local institutions and use them
to every advantage. Residents, as
far as is possible, should be permitted
to conduct their own governmental
affairs."
By reviving native constitutional
forms of government, the Allies wilt
have more cooperation from the
peoples in these occupied territories.
Thus self-government will be per
mitted in every possible instance.
Stanford's soldiers are playing a
large role in the future occupation
of the continent according to Dr.
| Buck. "Stanford's function is to pre
| pare these men in the knowledge of
i a language and the area to which the
j language is appropriate."
Two units of men are now being
j trained. In addition to the one area
| in which the language is predomi
j nantly spoken, one other area where
| the language might be useful is re
| quired by the military department.
I For instance some soldiers are learn
ing Italian and the countries of Ger
i many and Italy.
A third complement of men who
can already speak one or more for
! eign tongues have recently started
special area training only.
Area training in itself is taught
along four lines: the geography of
the country, the political structure of
the government, economic institu
tions and activities, and social, cul
tural, religious, and educational cus
toms. This last even includes the
popular literature and drama of the
day.

Dr. Philip VV. Buck, professor of European area and languages school, said
in an interview with the Stanford Daily that he favored a joint council
handled by all Allied nations for the type of government which should be
established in Allied occupied territories.
Dr. Buck declared, "Even though difficulties of joint Allied actions are

great, the advantages of more than
one power handling the risks of gov
ernment far outweigh the weak
points of such a system."
At present the Sicilian government
in occupied territories is known as
AMGOT, Allied Military Govern

H. Alexander is in charge of
agency.
This temporary government was
set up shortly after the invasion o L .
this strategic island south of Italy.
The British and Americans are co
operating in the system; they have
removed the Fascists from office,
taken over food rationing, and other
governmental functions, in order to
assist the military units in the in

Dr. Buck continued, '"We must re
vive local institutions and use them
to every advantage. Residents, as
far as is possible, should be permitted
to conduct their own governmental
affairs."
By reviving native constitutional
forms of government, the Allies wilt
have more cooperation from the
peoples in these occupied territories.
Thus self-government will be per
mitted in every possible instance.
