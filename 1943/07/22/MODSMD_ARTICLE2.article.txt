forces have captured the Sicilian communications huh of Enna. cutting off
large numbers of Axis rear guard troops, and the surviving enemy was re
ported in headlong retreat to the Catania-Mt. Etna line tonight for a final
stand with German reinforcements from Italy.

Battling desperately to cover the
retirement, German tanks counter
attacked against British seige forces
south of Catania but were beaten
back with heavy losses and casual
ties in continuation of the fiercest
fighting of the 12-day old campaign.
Get Half of Sicily
Half of Sicily's 9.936 square miles
lay under Allied control and with
the fall of Enna all remaining Axis
positions to the west were cut oft
from supply except by way ol the
dangerous north coast road. Consid
erable numbers of enemy rear guard
troops were reported trapped.
But despite the rapid conquest of
central Sicily, the battle was far from
over. General Dwight D. Eisen
hower, just returned from a second
visit to the front, emphasized this in
a press conference when he revealed
the Germans on the '"Mt. Etna line"
—based on Catania—were reinforc
ing themselves from the Italian
mainland.
Bitter Fighting Ahead
' Due to the nature of terrain and
the location of the enemy forces, the
task facing the Eighth Army includ
ing Canadian forces is one of bitter
fighting with the generally slow ad
vance," Eisenhower said.
' The Seventh American Army is
making a more or less rapid advance
through resistance.
