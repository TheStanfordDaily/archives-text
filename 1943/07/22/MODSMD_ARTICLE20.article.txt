### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
There's only one way to look at
the situation from our point of view,
and that is that Stanford will not
play football this year.
The Army officials who have the
yes and no powers have quite defi
nitely given a negative answer so
far, and there is no indication that
their decision will be reversed. If
that's the way they want to handle
the situation, that's their business.
They could probably give you more
reasons why they aren't letting their
men play than you could give them
why their men should play. They've
got their program marked out the
way they believe it should be run,
and there's nothing we can do about
it.
That's the way the Army stands,
we think, and here's the way Stan
ford stands.
We doubt that if the Army fails to
change their present athletic policy
Stanford officials will allow us to
field a team of men under the draft
age requirement.
If they did, we can only see a
large scale slaughter of the Indian
team that does battle with the boys
at Berkeley, the Trojans from South
ern California, and any other schools
that can draw their material from
Navy and Marine manpower.
From the sports angleu. we could
see no sense in dragging down the
high athletic reputation that Stan
ford has held during the past, and is
holding in the present.
We'd rather see Stanford coast
along on her laurels until the war is
finished, and then continue its inter
collegiate athletics when it has some
manpower of its own.
From the sports angle, we could
turn out a football team in the fall
that would be well coached in funda
mentals—and we .know Schwartz
could—but we doubt if even he could
have the courage to send these men
against a team that includes a strong
er personnel than it could normally
field in times of peace.
That's why we think that we had
better face the facts that are staring
us in ihe face now. and look for no
football at Stanford come fall.
If we're wrong, and the Army does
change their present stand, well, that
much the better, and the brighter the
situation will be when the news
breaks.
But the Army had better make a
definite decision one way or the
other quick, or there won't be any
lootball at the Farm anyway.

turn out a football team in the fall
that would be well coached in funda
mentals—and we .know Schwartz
could—but we doubt if even he could
have the courage to send these men
against a team that includes a strong
er personnel than it could normally
field in times of peace.
That's why we think that we had
better face the facts that are staring
us in ihe face now. and look for no
football at Stanford come fall.
If we're wrong, and the Army does
change their present stand, well, that
much the better, and the brighter the
situation will be when the news
breaks.
But the Army had better make a
definite decision one way or the
other quick, or there won't be any
lootball at the Farm anyway.
There's only one way to look at
the situation from our point of view,
and that is that Stanford will not
play football this year.
The Army officials who have the
yes and no powers have quite defi
nitely given a negative answer so
far, and there is no indication that
their decision will be reversed. If
that's the way they want to handle
the situation, that's their business.
They could probably give you more
reasons why they aren't letting their
men play than you could give them
why their men should play. They've
got their program marked out the
way they believe it should be run,
and there's nothing we can do about
it.
That's the way the Army stands,
we think, and here's the way Stan
ford stands.
We doubt that if the Army fails to
change their present athletic policy
Stanford officials will allow us to
field a team of men under the draft
age requirement.
If they did, we can only see a
large scale slaughter of the Indian
team that does battle with the boys
at Berkeley, the Trojans from South
ern California, and any other schools
that can draw their material from
Navy and Marine manpower.
From the sports angleu. we could
see no sense in dragging down the
high athletic reputation that Stan
ford has held during the past, and is
holding in the present.
We'd rather see Stanford coast
along on her laurels until the war is
finished, and then continue its inter
collegiate athletics when it has some
manpower of its own.
