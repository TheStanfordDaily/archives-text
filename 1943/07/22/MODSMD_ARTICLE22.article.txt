# Gerona Crushes Lincoln, 9-2
## 
### 
Pouring on the heat late in the
game, Gerona A.C. beat Lincoln if
to 2 in the feature tussle of the Presi
dent's Softball League last night,
Gerona put the game on ice by push
ing seven runs past the crumbling
Lincoln defense in the fifth inning.
Sharing mound chores for the victors
were Jim Gault and Walt Ball. The
win further entrenched Gerona in
the league lead, one-half game ahead
of the Boat House Boys.
In a wild and woolv contest, the
Boat House Boys nosed out Mc-
Kinley 112) to 8. Somewhat off his
usual form. Smoke Morrison had
just enough smoke left to hold Mc-

Kinley to eight runs while his mates
provided the margin of victory.
The Coaches' Club turned victory
into defeat by pounding out nine
runs in the last inning to knock over
Tyler If! to 10.
Two games were won by default.
Fillmore beat Buchanan, and Monroe
beat Hayes.
Finally achieving the impossible,
Arthur beat Garfield 10 to 7. The
victory was Arthur's first win after
seven straight defeats. The entire
Arthur squad didn't show up, but the
vacant posts were filled by pickups
and the patched up aggregation did
better than the first string had been
able to do all year.
