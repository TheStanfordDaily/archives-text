# Student Throat-Cutting
## 
### 
PERHAPS unknowingly, but more likely not, some Stanford
students are cutting their own throats and those of the rest
of the student body.
It seems the Concert Series Office is bucking the problem of
students buying up the best seats for outside agents.
In the past, off-campus agents have attempted to purchase
blocks of the beat seeds in the Memorial Auditorium for their
customers. This type of move has met with strong protest from
the Concert Series manager. The organization which brings out
standing artists to the campus is run for the benefit of Stanford
students primarily. And interested townspeople have obtained
'heir tickets directly from the Concert Series office.
Since the Concert Series is presented for the students, it is
only right that they should have the first choice of the best avail
able seats.
Therefore, students who buy blocks of the best seats in ad
vance sales for outside agents, unable to obtain large numbers of
'ickets themselves, are cheating the entire student body.
In these times the Concert Series office is working under ex
treme difficulties. This student throat-cutting is one handicap
which can be easily removed.
