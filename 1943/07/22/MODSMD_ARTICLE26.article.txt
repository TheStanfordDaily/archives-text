# Stockings Gone to War
## 
### 
O ILK and nylon stockings are still vital salvage material. In
O this state, approximately 1,784,400 pairs of hose have thus
far been collected, but the drive is still on.
According to the Stanford Salvage Committee, all salvage
able materials will be collected at the end of the quarter. So for
the sake of more glider tow ropes, parachute shrouds, and powder
bags, save all worn-out silk and nylon stockings until then.
They'll go to war.
Old nylons are "chemically unraveled" by boiling them in a
.solution which reduces them to liquid. They are then put through
a chemical process which produces a ribbon of solid nylon. By
breaking the ribbon to flakes and forcing them through tiny
holes, nylon filament is obtained which is used to make nylon
ropes and nylon parachutes.
Silk stockings are shredded into fibers which are woven into
threads for use in making powder bags to hold the charges used
in firing the big guns on warships. Silk is especially valuable for
gunpowder cloth because it burns rapidly and leaves no gummy
residue.
