### BILL STRUTHERS 
When you live in a family where there are two generations
and one of them is the "older" and the other is the "younger,"
there is apt to be a little friction. Now and then, that is.
In such a situation, a little oil in the form of cooperation within
one of the generations helps a lot. My brother and I learned to
do this by cutting corners and making minor excuses for each
other. But once our system of cooperation sort of backfired.
You see we both went to the same meeting one night. It was
San Leandro Troop Eight, Boy Scouts of America. Afterwards
my brother went home like a good guy shouldâ€”according to the
song. I went out with the boys.
Mother kept looking into our room every hour or so to see if
I had gotten in yet. Long about 1 o'clock she was beginning to
disturb my brother. So he carefully rolled up a blanket and put
it in my bed.
He did a good job, because the next time Mother came into
the room she gave a relieved sigh and went back to bed con
tentedly.
When I finally got in, I did it quietly. I carefully counted the
stairs, but when I got near the top I couldn't remember whether
it was the 11th or the 12th that squeaked. My guess was poor
and I went to my room rather confused.
"Somebody's in my bed," I muttered when I saw the dummy,
"Chuck must have brought a friend home for the night."
So I slept on the living room couch. And I had a hard time
explaining why.
