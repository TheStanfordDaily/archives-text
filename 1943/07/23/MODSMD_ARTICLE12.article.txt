# Draft Status Of Students Is Changed
## 
### LaVerne Bravo 
Student deferment under the Se
lective Service System has recently
been modified so that a student is
now eligible if he can complete his
training in one of the vital fields, sci
entific, specialized, or pre-profes
sional, within 24 months after his
draft certification and if he has
maintained good standing.
The change came about when 3
telegram was sent to all state di
rectors of Selective Service by Gen
eral Hershey.
Shortage in the designated field
is so acute and the need for con
tinuing training so urgent, states the
bulletin by the American Council or
Education at Washington, that stu
dents should be given consideration
for occupational deferment.
Old Limit Was 1945
Formerly, under
Bulletin No. 11, undergraduate stu
dents in one of the vital studies—fe.
which students were offered defer
ment—would be considered for oc
cupational classification "if he is
full-time student in good standing
. . . . competent, and gives promise
of successful completion of sue:
course of study and if he will gradu
ate on or before July 1, 1945."
It is the latter provision which was
amended in the Council on Educa
tion's Bulletin No. 56 of July 10.
1943. It eliminates the date July 1,
1945, by which time the student to be
eligible for deferment must have
completed his training.
Opportunity Increased
Under the new arrangement a stu
dent who enters a college or univer
sity in one of the specified fields be
fore he is 18 years old will have more
opportunity to receive his degree or
finish his pre-professional study.
Concerning the pre-professional stu
dent, if he is "certified by a recog
nized medical, dental, veterinary, os
teopathic, or theological college, hy
will be accepted for admission and
will be admitted to undertake pro
fessional studies upon completion of
his pre-professional work."
This limitation of the time fo:
completion of training to 24 months
from the date of certification will
undoubtedly stimulate acceleration
in the secondary schools, the bulletin
continues. Unless this is done, onlv
a few, the youngest, students will
have progressed far enough in col
lege to (a) provide the institutions
with sufficient knowledge of the in
dividual's abilities to justify a request
for deferment, (b) enable the indi
vidual to begin his work in an es
sential field, and (c) complete the
training within the time allotted.
According to the bulletin, students
should be assured that they are fill
ing a war need in an activity de
clared essential by the War Man
power Commission and the Selective
Service system.

completion of training to 24 months
from the date of certification will
undoubtedly stimulate acceleration
in the secondary schools, the bulletin
continues. Unless this is done, onlv
a few, the youngest, students will
have progressed far enough in col
lege to (a) provide the institutions
with sufficient knowledge of the in
dividual's abilities to justify a request
for deferment, (b) enable the indi
vidual to begin his work in an es
sential field, and (c) complete the
training within the time allotted.
According to the bulletin, students
should be assured that they are fill
ing a war need in an activity de
clared essential by the War Man
power Commission and the Selective
Service system.
Student deferment under the Se
lective Service System has recently
been modified so that a student is
now eligible if he can complete his
training in one of the vital fields, sci
entific, specialized, or pre-profes
sional, within 24 months after his
draft certification and if he has
maintained good standing.
The change came about when 3
telegram was sent to all state di
rectors of Selective Service by Gen
eral Hershey.
Shortage in the designated field
is so acute and the need for con
tinuing training so urgent, states the
bulletin by the American Council or
Education at Washington, that stu
dents should be given consideration
for occupational deferment.
Old Limit Was 1945
Formerly, under
Bulletin No. 11, undergraduate stu
dents in one of the vital studies—fe.
which students were offered defer
ment—would be considered for oc
cupational classification "if he is
full-time student in good standing
. . . . competent, and gives promise
of successful completion of sue:
course of study and if he will gradu
ate on or before July 1, 1945."
It is the latter provision which was
amended in the Council on Educa
tion's Bulletin No. 56 of July 10.
1943. It eliminates the date July 1,
1945, by which time the student to be
eligible for deferment must have
completed his training.
Opportunity Increased
Under the new arrangement a stu
dent who enters a college or univer
sity in one of the specified fields be
fore he is 18 years old will have more
opportunity to receive his degree or
finish his pre-professional study.
Concerning the pre-professional stu
dent, if he is "certified by a recog
nized medical, dental, veterinary, os
teopathic, or theological college, hy
will be accepted for admission and
will be admitted to undertake pro
fessional studies upon completion of
his pre-professional work."
