# Stanford Researchers Seek Amino Acid Test

With funds seen red from the Nutrition Foundation in support of the work,
i'oiir Stanford graduate students, l)rs. (i. W. Beadle, E. L. Tatum, N. 11.
Horowitz, and I). M. Bonner, are developing new methods for testing com
mon foods for their amino acid content.
The amino acids are the "building blocks" of proteins and are the basic

constituents of all protoplasm. There 1
are 10 of these acids which are
known and which cannot be artifi
cially manufactured.
Formerly, man has obtained suffi
cient quantities of these acids from
neat. Now, however, new sources
must be found.
Before, research in discovering the
vitamin content of common food
,stuffs has been complicated and has
involved long chemical processes
which could be performed only by
experts.
A newer method, a bio-assay, is
i simpler one which is performed on
vats and guinea pigs. Essentially the
same method is being worked out in
tinding strains which cannot manu
facture particular amino acids.
The Stanford researchers have se
cured these strains in red bread mold
through treating it with X-rays or
ullra-violet light. It is possible, in
this way to secure strains which can
not, make their own vitamin B-l,
for example.
The amount the mold grows when
pure B-l is added to the diet of this
.strain is compared with the amount
•of growth obtained when a foodstuff
vvith an unknown amount of B-l is
added to its diet. The amount of B-l
in the unknown substance can thus
be estimated.
