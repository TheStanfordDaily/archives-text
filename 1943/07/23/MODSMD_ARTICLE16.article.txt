## 
### 
Twenty Stanford women, clad in
their best gardening outfits, will
work in the Con Home victory gar
den tomorrow morning under the
eye of Sam McDonald, their boss
from 9 to 12 o'clock. Signups are
still open on the Roble and Lagunita
bulletin boards. Women will be
picked up by a truck in front of
Roble at 8:45.
Most of the work done at the vic
tory garden is the bleaching of cel
ery, according to Louise Phillips, who
has been elected foreman by the
workers. She said they also pulled
up carrots and beets, and ate a few.
