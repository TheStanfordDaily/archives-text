the need for giving the men mate
rials that will enable them to find
their way around wherever their
I military activities may take them,
| and to establish good relations with

the people in those ocuntries.
The men must be able to meet any
emergency which may arise and they

operations with the greatest of efli
ciency.

ogist and has accompanied her hus
band on his researches. She is the

strap-hanging on crowded buses as
the chief mode of transportation.
