# LATE TIPS

Here we go again on this column's
favorite subject, Georgie Metkovich.
As most of you know, Joe Cronin of
the Bosox got a bad deal when his
boss, Tom Yawkey, bought George
from the Seals for $25,000 plus an
outfielder, Dee Miles. In the six
games that Met has played for Bos
ton, he has batted out four hits in 26
times at bat. That is only an average
of .154. In that same period of time,
his team has won just one measly
game.
To show that his leaving hasn't
hurt the Seals, San Francisco has
won 10 and lost 5 since he left. That
isn't bad at all considering that he
was supposed to be the bulwark of
their attack. In the meantime Dee
Miles has saved a ball game for the
Seals with his throwing arm, and he
has also had a good share of hits.
Maybe this column was right after
all concerning the prospects of
George Metkovich. This closes the
file on him.
Joe Louis
The National Boxing Association
announced their ratings early this
week with Joe Louis, as usual, on top
of the crowd. The name Joe Louis
brings to our nose a bad odor. Why?
To begin with, Joe seems to be get
ting quite a raw deal by the War
Department.
It seems he was scheduled to battle
Billy Conn last summer for the
world title. The War Department
called it off as it would interfere too
much with his training. Not so long
afterwards, Louis was assigned to
Hollywood for work in the motion
pictuie, "This h: the Army." Reason
given was that it was for a good
cause. Wouldn't it be for a good
cause if he defended his title with
the price of admission a war bond'.
We think so.
As of now. Louis is competing in
the Hale America golf tournament
being held in Chicago. That brings
up the question, doesn't that inter
fere with his training? Is he doing
that as an aid towards the carrying
on and the winning of the war? I
don't think so. He would be helping
his country more in the ring fighting
under the terms we mentioned be- !
fore. Suppose the War Department
makes up its mind concerning the
case of Joe Louis.

his country more in the ring fighting
under the terms we mentioned be- !
fore. Suppose the War Department
makes up its mind concerning the
case of Joe Louis.
Here we go again on this column's
favorite subject, Georgie Metkovich.
As most of you know, Joe Cronin of
the Bosox got a bad deal when his
boss, Tom Yawkey, bought George
from the Seals for $25,000 plus an
outfielder, Dee Miles. In the six
games that Met has played for Bos
ton, he has batted out four hits in 26
times at bat. That is only an average
of .154. In that same period of time,
his team has won just one measly
game.
To show that his leaving hasn't
hurt the Seals, San Francisco has
won 10 and lost 5 since he left. That
isn't bad at all considering that he
was supposed to be the bulwark of
their attack. In the meantime Dee
Miles has saved a ball game for the
Seals with his throwing arm, and he
has also had a good share of hits.
Maybe this column was right after
all concerning the prospects of
George Metkovich. This closes the
file on him.
Joe Louis
The National Boxing Association
announced their ratings early this
week with Joe Louis, as usual, on top
of the crowd. The name Joe Louis
brings to our nose a bad odor. Why?
To begin with, Joe seems to be get
ting quite a raw deal by the War
Department.
It seems he was scheduled to battle
Billy Conn last summer for the
world title. The War Department
called it off as it would interfere too
much with his training. Not so long
afterwards, Louis was assigned to
Hollywood for work in the motion
pictuie, "This h: the Army." Reason
given was that it was for a good
cause. Wouldn't it be for a good
cause if he defended his title with
the price of admission a war bond'.
We think so.
As of now. Louis is competing in
the Hale America golf tournament
being held in Chicago. That brings
up the question, doesn't that inter
fere with his training? Is he doing
that as an aid towards the carrying
on and the winning of the war? I
don't think so. He would be helping
his country more in the ring fighting
under the terms we mentioned be- !
fore. Suppose the War Department
makes up its mind concerning the
case of Joe Louis.
