From the Saturday Evening Post, Editorial Page. July 24, 1943:
"There are educators who agree that the old three-month
cooling-off period between college years will never come back
and that college education from now on is not going to be the gay
shenanigan which the old grads like to recollect ....
"We would take no bets against a big dose of change in the
academic way of life. On the other hand, we shall be looking
around after the war for the first college president to announce
that his institution has no traffic with new and significant trends;
that there will be 'sings' .... that there will be eccentric pro
cessors who can be relied on to put the most alert student to sleep;
and that the letters awarded to players on the football team will
be at least eight inches high.
"Should an American educator come out with a policy like
that, making it clear also that his was the College Without a Pro
gram, the scoundrel would get a lot of clients."
