### BILL STRUTHERS 
The bus station on sth and Mission in San Francisco is like
a funnel. It opens wide to the city, catches all those who travel,
dissolves them, and drains them slowly through a small opening
in the bottom. The bus station is like a valve to the heart of the
city. The fluid blood of the nation passes through it, but doesn't
notice it. None of the swollen, tangible, bell-shaped curve of
aumanity that enters or leaves the city notices the station at sth
and Mission any more than a red blood cell notices which
ventricle of the heart it is in.
But that doesn't stop the blood from flowing. And it didn't
stop me from thinking.
I sat there with leanie. Jeanie who I labeled "Winter of 1942."
Who wasn't worth describing. Who just filled a blank in my life,
jeanie who was someone to talk to, who made me shudder every
lime I heard Bing Crosby sing "White Christmas," who made
me feel at ease—at home in a bus station that smelled like a
dirty dog that had just come out of the rain into a warm room.
The deck of cards in my hands purred regularly. I shuffled
them on my knee without noticing them.
"Why do you always shuffle cards when you don't feel like
talking?" she asked.
"Flux," I said.
Then I ran through the deck and picked out the two of hearts
and the jack of clubs and put them together.
"You are the red one and I am the black one," I said. "Watch
the change. Say 'flux' when you see it."
I shuffled the deck twice, then showed her the faces.
"Look," I said, "you are with the five of spades and the nine
of diamonds. I am with the king of hearts and the seven of clubs."
"Flux," she said.
"Time does the shuffling," I said. "We must catch the beauty
of the arrangement of the cards, each coincident of our lives."
I kept shuffling the deck and showing her where she was
and where I was and not saying anything but listening to her say
"flux" every time she spotted the two of hearts and the jack of
clubs. The regular, surf-like ripping of my shuffling, the loud
speaker droning "Oakland, Tracy, Manteca, Modesto, Fresno,
points south .. . the haphazard pounding of feet over the ci
garette butts I stared at—
Feet that were uniformed; feet that were too young to walk,
to vote, to work; too old to run, to jump, to travel. Feet that the
funnel of a bus station in a wartime whirlpool called San Fran
cisco had caught, had held for a moment or maybe a lifetime.
Then I showed her the backs of the cards. I carefully turned
the backs to her, one at a time.
"The backs are all alike," I said. "Look at each one carefully.
There's a brown wood-grain design with a porthole in the center
and through the porthole you see a ship. A square-rigger in full
sail. But without a magnifying glass they all look alike."
"Just the same," she said, "but on the other side . . . flux."
"Yes," I said.
And I shuffled the cards till our bus was called. And the two
of hearts and the jack of clubs were not together again.

But that doesn't stop the blood from flowing. And it didn't
stop me from thinking.
I sat there with leanie. Jeanie who I labeled "Winter of 1942."
Who wasn't worth describing. Who just filled a blank in my life,
jeanie who was someone to talk to, who made me shudder every
lime I heard Bing Crosby sing "White Christmas," who made
me feel at ease—at home in a bus station that smelled like a
dirty dog that had just come out of the rain into a warm room.
The deck of cards in my hands purred regularly. I shuffled
them on my knee without noticing them.
"Why do you always shuffle cards when you don't feel like
talking?" she asked.
"Flux," I said.
Then I ran through the deck and picked out the two of hearts
and the jack of clubs and put them together.
"You are the red one and I am the black one," I said. "Watch
the change. Say 'flux' when you see it."
I shuffled the deck twice, then showed her the faces.
"Look," I said, "you are with the five of spades and the nine
of diamonds. I am with the king of hearts and the seven of clubs."
"Flux," she said.
"Time does the shuffling," I said. "We must catch the beauty
of the arrangement of the cards, each coincident of our lives."
I kept shuffling the deck and showing her where she was
and where I was and not saying anything but listening to her say
"flux" every time she spotted the two of hearts and the jack of
clubs. The regular, surf-like ripping of my shuffling, the loud
speaker droning "Oakland, Tracy, Manteca, Modesto, Fresno,
points south .. . the haphazard pounding of feet over the ci
garette butts I stared at—
Feet that were uniformed; feet that were too young to walk,
to vote, to work; too old to run, to jump, to travel. Feet that the
funnel of a bus station in a wartime whirlpool called San Fran
cisco had caught, had held for a moment or maybe a lifetime.
Then I showed her the backs of the cards. I carefully turned
the backs to her, one at a time.
"The backs are all alike," I said. "Look at each one carefully.
There's a brown wood-grain design with a porthole in the center
and through the porthole you see a ship. A square-rigger in full
sail. But without a magnifying glass they all look alike."
"Just the same," she said, "but on the other side . . . flux."
"Yes," I said.
And I shuffled the cards till our bus was called. And the two
of hearts and the jack of clubs were not together again.
The bus station on sth and Mission in San Francisco is like
a funnel. It opens wide to the city, catches all those who travel,
dissolves them, and drains them slowly through a small opening
in the bottom. The bus station is like a valve to the heart of the
city. The fluid blood of the nation passes through it, but doesn't
notice it. None of the swollen, tangible, bell-shaped curve of
aumanity that enters or leaves the city notices the station at sth
and Mission any more than a red blood cell notices which
ventricle of the heart it is in.
But that doesn't stop the blood from flowing. And it didn't
stop me from thinking.
