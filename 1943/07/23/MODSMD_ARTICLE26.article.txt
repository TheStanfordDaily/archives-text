FIVE GRAVES TO CAIRO — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
"Five Graves to Cairo" is the "Hol
lywood" version of why Rommel got
licked in Northern Africa. The story
is strictly something dreamed up by
the boys at Paramount, but excep
tionally good jobs of acting and pi'o
duction transform the picture into
an exciting drama of espionage and
intrigue.
Franchot Tone is seen as a British
corporal left behind in the retreat
who manages to pass himself off as a
Nazi agent, and is able to uncover
Rommel's secret plans for his final
push to Cairo.
Akim Tamiroff plays the owner of
the desert hotel which Rommel uses
as headquarters and where Tone
turns waiter for the occasion. Anne
Baxter, a French chambermaid in
the same hotel, joins hands with Tone
to solve the mystery of the "five
graves," which solution we shall
leave for you to witness.
There's nice casting in this picture,
with Erich Von Stroheim really lay
ing it on thick as the pompous Rom
mel. Tone and Miss Baxter turn in
creditable performances in the ac
tion and romantic departments, while
Akim Tamiroff provides just enough
comic relief.
The second feature, "Cinderella
Swings It," featuring Guy Kibbee, is
a miserable little number in which
everybody who's not a swing addict
is put to public shame. It's really
very disgusting.—Bower
