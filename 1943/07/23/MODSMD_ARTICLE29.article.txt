# BERRY ACREAGE DROPS
## 
### 
The 1943 strawberry acreage in
the three Pacific Coast states is esti
mated at 17,000 acres, as against
25,120 in 1942. Inability to get pick
ers has discouraged growers.

The Federal order for a 35-miie
an-hour driving limit brought aver
age speed throughout the count:
down to about 37 miles an hour.
