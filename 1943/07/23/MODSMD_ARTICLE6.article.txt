# String Quartet Will Perform Again Tonight
## 
### Adolph Gugel 
The second concert of the London
: String Quartet will be held tonight
lat 8 o'clock in Memorial Hall and
! will feature works by Toch, Brahms,
and Mozart.
The program will open with the
Quartet in A minor, Opus 12, by
Ernest Toch, an Austrian born con
temporary composer who now lives
in Hollywood. Although Toch is not
generally considered to be one of the
"great" modern composers, he has
written numerous works which have
attained some degree of popularity.
The Toch Quartet is to be followed
by Johannes Brahm's Quartet in A
j minor, Opus 51, No. 2, which is the
companion work to the Quartet in
C minor, played at last Tuesday's
j concert. It is not as somber as the
| C minor Quartet, and is more con
trapuntal in nature.
Brahms wrote three string quar
tets, the C minor, the A minor, and
the great but very difficult one in B
flat major, Opus 67, which will be
given on next Tuesday's concert.
Tonight's program will conclude
with the Quartet in B flat major (K.
589) by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
This work was written in 1790. the
, year before Mozart's death and some
months after he composed the "Jupi
j ter" Symphony.
The members of the London String
Quartet are John Pennington, first
violin; Laurent Halleux, second vio
lin; William Primrose, viola; and C.
Warwick Evans, 'cello.
The concert is free to the public
and will begin promptly at 8 p.m.
