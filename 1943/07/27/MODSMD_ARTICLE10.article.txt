# Daily Ad Brings Back Lost Thesis
## 
### 
Through an insert in last Wednes
day's Stanford Daily, an entire sum
mer's work was regained yesterday
when a woman's folder containing
I the work on her doctor's thesis was
returned to the locker from which it
disappeared last week.
Leaving her folder in an open
locker in the Education Library, the
woman returned to find it gone. The
following day. an editorial and clas
sified ad were published in the Daily.
These insertions were noticed by the
person who found the folder.

â™¦ The surprisingly warm reception
that the Quartet in A minor by
Ernst Toch received last Friday night
at the second concert of the London
String Quartet, was undoubteldv due
to the light and "catchy"' quality of
the work and not to its merits as a
musical composition.
If the listener did not know better,
the work could easily have been
passed off as an excerpt from a light
opera, although it must be admitted
that while the Quartet is shallow and
more or less meaningless, it is never
theless enjoyable if not taken too
seriously. It also must be remem
bered that Toch was only 18 years
old at the time of its composition. In
spite of its limitations, the work was
well performed, its possibilities being
fully explored.
The Brahms Quartet in A major,
Opus 51, No. 2, was performed by the
London group with the same warmth
and understanding as Opus 51, No. .1
was on the first concert. When it
comes to Brahms, the London Quar
tet seems to be playing on the "home
ball field."
This is unfortunately not true of
their Haydn and Mozart.
All in all, the Brahms work was
the real event of the evening.
