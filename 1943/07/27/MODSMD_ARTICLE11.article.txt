# 'Bataan' Features Gripping Action
## 
### 
BATAAN—Now playing at the Stan
ford Theater.
You'll see lots of silence, suspense,
and shooting in this starkly grim
motion picture. Twelve assorted sol
diers and a sailor form an "expend
able'' unit to slow down the omni
present Japs during the last days of
; the battle for Bataan Peninsula.
The main body of action takes
place in an encampment placed by
an important bridge, the enemy's
! thoroughfai'e. Following the Lost
Patrol theme, the men are expected
i to fight Japs and malaria to the last
| man, to cover the retreat of our
Army.
The captain of the company, a
young West Pointer, is shot by a
sniper as camp is being made ready,
leaving Robert Taylor in command
| as Sergeant Bill Dane. His business
[ like fighters form a superb cast —
Thomas Mitchell. Lloyd Nolan, and
Robert Walker.
"Bataan" pulls no punches; it is
heads above recent releases capital

j izing on action furnished by war
scenes. It was inevitable that a
J studio should turn out a picture
! based on our last stand stall for time
in the Philippines, but assurance
| wanes as the easy possibilities for a
, weak vehicle loom. MGM has turned
| out a story of a Philippines patrol
i with no nonsense.
If you want to see a good war pic
ture, don't miss this one. It gets
pretty noisy and bloody, so don't take
your little brother.
'"High Explosive," starring Chester
Morris and Jean Parker, is the sec
ond feature. It's a shallow and half
hearted attempt to show how care
ful people will be when they drive
I a truck full of nitro. —Hyer
