# LATE TIPS
## 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
We got a letter the other day.
About the first one since we took
over, and naturally we thought that
it was some beef a guy wanted to get
; off his chest. But it wsan't. It was
' exactly the opposite.
It had to do with an army team
playing softball, and instead of try
ing to explain the situation in my
own words—a near impossibility—l
hereby give you the letter.
"Dear Late, (They love me at
Stanford.)
"We have iust recently organized
| a softball team in the military head
■ quarters here on the campus but
have thus far met with little success
in finding teams to play. Mr. Wolter
was reluctant, and rightly so, about
admitting us to the President's
League as the season is so far ad
j vanced.
"We can play any week night ex
i cept Saturday and would like very
much to meet some of the teams in
the President's League on the nights
| when they aren't scheduled. We
would appreciate it a great deal if
you would give us a little 'plug' in
your column or otherwise advertise
our being on the ball market. You
can get in touch with us by calling
I Corporal Eigeman at local 31! l or
' Sergeant Nelson at local 555.
"Thanks a lot.
"Sincerely.
"Ted Eigeman, Cpl.
"G. Arthur Nelson, Sgt."
Well that's about it, and it's too
bad that you didn't form your team
! when the regular intramural league
| got underway. Anyway, if you ac
| cept, Monroe Hall will meet you at
7:15 this Thursday evening. The dia
j mond will be decided later.
That's the starter game, and it de
pends on the rest of the organizations
; in the league to keep the ball rolling.
Speaking of baseball, it looks as
if the Los Angeles Angels are going
| to coast home with at least a six
game margin over San Francisco.
! For a while it looked as if the Angels
I were going to have their wings
clipped again, a procedure to which
j they have become acquainted in the
past. Andy Pafko, the Angels' sen
i sational slugger, had been in a slump
last week, his average falling to
about .380. Did this boy give up? No.
1 He buckled down, and once again
his average is rising.
It's a wonder that in our illustrous
j assistant, Don Langendorf's, column,
he didn't pick Pafko to end up in the
three-eye league. By the way. the
boy did all right with the subject of
"Georgie" Metkovitch. Somebody's
I about finished, and it isn't Metko
vitch. That's all brother.

Well that's about it, and it's too
bad that you didn't form your team
! when the regular intramural league
| got underway. Anyway, if you ac
| cept, Monroe Hall will meet you at
7:15 this Thursday evening. The dia
j mond will be decided later.
That's the starter game, and it de
pends on the rest of the organizations
; in the league to keep the ball rolling.
Speaking of baseball, it looks as
if the Los Angeles Angels are going
| to coast home with at least a six
game margin over San Francisco.
! For a while it looked as if the Angels
I were going to have their wings
clipped again, a procedure to which
j they have become acquainted in the
past. Andy Pafko, the Angels' sen
i sational slugger, had been in a slump
last week, his average falling to
about .380. Did this boy give up? No.
1 He buckled down, and once again
his average is rising.
It's a wonder that in our illustrous
j assistant, Don Langendorf's, column,
he didn't pick Pafko to end up in the
three-eye league. By the way. the
boy did all right with the subject of
"Georgie" Metkovitch. Somebody's
I about finished, and it isn't Metko
vitch. That's all brother.
We got a letter the other day.
About the first one since we took
over, and naturally we thought that
it was some beef a guy wanted to get
; off his chest. But it wsan't. It was
' exactly the opposite.
It had to do with an army team
playing softball, and instead of try
ing to explain the situation in my
own words—a near impossibility—l
hereby give you the letter.
