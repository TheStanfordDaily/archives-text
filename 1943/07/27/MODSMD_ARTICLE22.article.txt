BY NOW Mussolini's resignation is old news. Sunday after
noon the nation was in a furor of excitement as terse radio
broadcasters and screaming headlines revealed the world-shak
>ng facts.
Most of us were surprised—and glad, for to the layman it
seems one step closer to victory. Speculations run rampant as to
the ultimate meaning of the shakeup.
The conviction grows that harassed Italy, with cities in ruins
and internal unrest, has moved toward eventual peace. But in the
meantime, to Marshal Pietro Badoglio go the gravest problems
r hat could face a man.
And the initial excitement and joy dies down a little as we
vatch intently the moves this man makes. With a one-party gov
srnment, with a dispirited army, with German troops and police
on Italian soil, the load of reconstruction lies heavy and pressing
Dn Badoglio's shoulders.
