Economics textbooks make the world sound awfully compli
cated. They talk about supply and demand, labor and capital,
wealth, money, inflation, and a lot of other things. And they ex
press the relation of all of these things with curves or straight lines
on charts. If you try to learn about all these things the night before
the final, you begin to wonder how the system really does manage
to work as well as it does. But even more discouraging was the
conversation I had while hitch-hiking with a labor organizer.
When I saw his 1928 Buick coupe down the road traveling far
ander the 35 m.p.h. speed limit, I started to pull in my thumb. No
use riding with a snail when there are enough rabbits to go
around. But the Buick stopped and I crawled in. I spent the first
mile trying to close the bent door. When I had finished the driver
turned to me and introduced himself. He spoke too slowly and too
distinctly. His smile was calculated to be warm and winning.
Oh, oh, I thought, the old personality kid, a la Dale Carnegie.
The man was about 37 years old and rather poorly worn. He
said that he had been going to the University of California Exten
sion School off and on for 16 years. The school had awarded him
a high school diploma and granted him enough credits so that he
could teach manual training in some high schools.
But right now he was a labor organizer. He was on his way to
Livermore, Calif., to collect back dues from some of the members.
"These men don't have time or gas to get into town for the
meetings," he explained, "so they lose interest and get behind in
their dues. I come out hre about once a month."
His company had given him a leave of absence at the request
of the union. For the past three months he had worked to get the
men to join a union. The next three months, according to the pro
visions of some labor agreement, was to be spent deciding
whether the union should be the C.1.0. or the A.F. of L.
His union was on the short side just then, but it was coming up.
Tust the same the work was discouraging at times. He said that
he would spend a week with the men in some valley plant and
then the organizer for the other union would go down there and
undo all his work. The men are pretty fickle, and need reminding
now and then, he explained.
But my friend enjoyed working with people and teaching them
unionism and that was his job, so he had found a little crevise or
canyon in society for his playground. His Buick, his life, and his
battered brief case went down the highway together. And with
them went his appreciation of Harry Bridges, a multitude of regu
lations. contracts, and appendixes to contracts, and his love for (
people that textbooks in economics fail to mention.
