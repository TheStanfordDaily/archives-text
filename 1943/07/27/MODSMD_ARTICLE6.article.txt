# MUSSOLINI COUP
## Professors Say New Move Brings Italy Closer to Peace 
### Jean Hanssen 
The downfall of Mussolini is a step toward the withdrawal of Italy from
the war while she makes as cheap a peace as possible, according to opinions
expressed by Professors Stuart, Bailey, Fisher, and Buck in interviews with
The Stanford Daily.
Dr. Graham Stuart, professor of political science, believes that because of

the heavy bombings which the Ital-""
ian cities have suffered, especially
Naples, Italy has decided to get out
ol" the war as soon as suitable terms
can be arranged.
''Italy is suffering for no reason
and she sees no' hope of future vic
tory," he said.
In South America
Dr. Stuart believes that secret ne
gotiations will begin almost imme
diately now and Italy will try to see
if the "unconditional surrender"
proclaimed by President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill, at
Casablanca, will be applied in in its
more severe terms or if leniency will
be granted.
The Italian coup will affect Axis
prestige in Latin America, he said.
There are more Italians than any
nationality other than Spanish in
Latin America. Now that Italy seems
to be breaking away from the Axis,
the pressure which these people
automatically possess will now be
used on the side of the United Na
tions, and the increase in pressure
may even cause Argentina now to
break off diplomatic relations with
the Axis.
"Why Not Hitler?"
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, believes that the Allies are
' one step nearer victory as a -result
of the ousting of Mussolini."
Since Hitler and Mussolini have
been associated with aggression," he
said, "the defeat of one will make
possible the defeat of the other in the
minds of the public. If Mussolini can
be overthrown, why can't Hitler?"
There has been no evidence to in
dicate that the Fascist regime has
been thrown out. on the contrary,
this move seems to be a result of the
unpopularity of Mussolini himself.
Mussolini permitted the loss of the
Italian Empire in Africa and the in
vasion of Sicily, which will undoubt
edly end in an Allied victory. The
Italians acquired their empire at a
great expense of both men and ma
teriel and they did not like to see
them lost so easily.
Weakened Loyalty
Dr. Bailey said that it was Musso
lini's war from the very beginning;
the Italians never wanted to fight.
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, professor of
history, believes that this coup will
weaken the loyalty of the countries
in central Europe and in the Balkans
toward the Nazis.
"Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania
have been closer toward the Italians
than toward the Nazis," he said, "and,
consequently, the fall of Italy will
mean that it is possible that the fall
of Germany will not be long in
coming."
World War I Parallel
In comparing the situation with
| that of World War I, a definite
parallel can be seen. Dr. Fisher said.
Turkey was the first to fall, with
Bulgaria and Austro-Hungary fol
lowing. However, he pointed out, the
Germans of today are better prepared
to resist.
He believes that the change of
government indicates an Italian ef
fort to meet the conditions of the
Allies with as little sacrifice as pos
sible on the part of Italy.
"I think that the Badoglio ap
pointment is the cheapest price that
the Italians are offering for peace.
They are giving up as little as they
can. It doesn't represent any pro
found change in the situation in
Italy."
"Badoglio Is Pacifist"
Dr. Fisher believes that Badoglio
is a pasifist and that he will try to
discourage all efforts to create a dis
turbance; that no profound change
will immediately be forthcoming,
though there is a possibility that this
! is the beginning of a change.
He believes that the"resignation"
j of Mussolini came as a direct result
| of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting last
j week.
| Personal Enemy
Dr. Philip W. Buck, professor of
political science, believes that Ba
doglio, who is Mussolini's personal
enemy, represents the traditional
j ruling class of Italy.
If Mussolini had resigned for rea
sons of ill health, as is claimed, then
| Cailo Scorza, Secretary General of
the Fascist party, would have suc
! ceeded Mussolini due to his position
; as the highest ranking Fascist party
| officer, Dr. Buck said.
Bargaining Purposes
"My guess is that the war will be
; continued with a considerable degree j
! of persistence for some time if only !
| for bargaining purposes. Italy must ;
I continue to fight so that she will be
able to get something from the
! United Nations for ceasing to fight."
I Any separate peace, he said, must
j have the look of unconditional sur
; render. There will have to be Allied
! military control for the duration of
| the hostilities. Then, according to
j the principles of the Atlantic Char- I
ter, the Allies will have to set up an
Italian government of Italy. This will :
be very difficult because of the long
duration of Fascism in Italy.

be overthrown, why can't Hitler?"
There has been no evidence to in
dicate that the Fascist regime has
been thrown out. on the contrary,
this move seems to be a result of the
unpopularity of Mussolini himself.
Mussolini permitted the loss of the
Italian Empire in Africa and the in
vasion of Sicily, which will undoubt
edly end in an Allied victory. The
Italians acquired their empire at a
great expense of both men and ma
teriel and they did not like to see
them lost so easily.
Weakened Loyalty
Dr. Bailey said that it was Musso
lini's war from the very beginning;
the Italians never wanted to fight.
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, professor of
history, believes that this coup will
weaken the loyalty of the countries
in central Europe and in the Balkans
toward the Nazis.
"Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania
have been closer toward the Italians
than toward the Nazis," he said, "and,
consequently, the fall of Italy will
mean that it is possible that the fall
of Germany will not be long in
coming."
World War I Parallel
In comparing the situation with
| that of World War I, a definite
parallel can be seen. Dr. Fisher said.
Turkey was the first to fall, with
Bulgaria and Austro-Hungary fol
lowing. However, he pointed out, the
Germans of today are better prepared
to resist.
He believes that the change of
government indicates an Italian ef
fort to meet the conditions of the
Allies with as little sacrifice as pos
sible on the part of Italy.
"I think that the Badoglio ap
pointment is the cheapest price that
the Italians are offering for peace.
They are giving up as little as they
can. It doesn't represent any pro
found change in the situation in
Italy."
"Badoglio Is Pacifist"
Dr. Fisher believes that Badoglio
is a pasifist and that he will try to
discourage all efforts to create a dis
turbance; that no profound change
will immediately be forthcoming,
though there is a possibility that this
! is the beginning of a change.
He believes that the"resignation"
j of Mussolini came as a direct result
| of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting last
j week.
| Personal Enemy
Dr. Philip W. Buck, professor of
political science, believes that Ba
doglio, who is Mussolini's personal
enemy, represents the traditional
j ruling class of Italy.
If Mussolini had resigned for rea
sons of ill health, as is claimed, then
| Cailo Scorza, Secretary General of
the Fascist party, would have suc
! ceeded Mussolini due to his position
; as the highest ranking Fascist party
| officer, Dr. Buck said.
Bargaining Purposes
"My guess is that the war will be
; continued with a considerable degree j
! of persistence for some time if only !
| for bargaining purposes. Italy must ;
I continue to fight so that she will be
able to get something from the
! United Nations for ceasing to fight."
I Any separate peace, he said, must
j have the look of unconditional sur
; render. There will have to be Allied
! military control for the duration of
| the hostilities. Then, according to
j the principles of the Atlantic Char- I
ter, the Allies will have to set up an
Italian government of Italy. This will :
be very difficult because of the long
duration of Fascism in Italy.
The downfall of Mussolini is a step toward the withdrawal of Italy from
the war while she makes as cheap a peace as possible, according to opinions
expressed by Professors Stuart, Bailey, Fisher, and Buck in interviews with
The Stanford Daily.
Dr. Graham Stuart, professor of political science, believes that because of

the heavy bombings which the Ital-""
ian cities have suffered, especially
Naples, Italy has decided to get out
ol" the war as soon as suitable terms
can be arranged.
''Italy is suffering for no reason
and she sees no' hope of future vic
tory," he said.
In South America
Dr. Stuart believes that secret ne
gotiations will begin almost imme
diately now and Italy will try to see
if the "unconditional surrender"
proclaimed by President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill, at
Casablanca, will be applied in in its
more severe terms or if leniency will
be granted.
The Italian coup will affect Axis
prestige in Latin America, he said.
There are more Italians than any
nationality other than Spanish in
Latin America. Now that Italy seems
to be breaking away from the Axis,
the pressure which these people
automatically possess will now be
used on the side of the United Na
tions, and the increase in pressure
may even cause Argentina now to
break off diplomatic relations with
the Axis.
"Why Not Hitler?"
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, believes that the Allies are
' one step nearer victory as a -result
of the ousting of Mussolini."

been associated with aggression," he
said, "the defeat of one will make

can. It doesn't represent any pro
found change in the situation in
Italy."
"Badoglio Is Pacifist"
Dr. Fisher believes that Badoglio
is a pasifist and that he will try to
discourage all efforts to create a dis
turbance; that no profound change
will immediately be forthcoming,
though there is a possibility that this
! is the beginning of a change.
He believes that the"resignation"
j of Mussolini came as a direct result
| of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting last
j week.
| Personal Enemy
Dr. Philip W. Buck, professor of
political science, believes that Ba
doglio, who is Mussolini's personal
enemy, represents the traditional
j ruling class of Italy.
If Mussolini had resigned for rea
sons of ill health, as is claimed, then
| Cailo Scorza, Secretary General of
the Fascist party, would have suc
! ceeded Mussolini due to his position
; as the highest ranking Fascist party
| officer, Dr. Buck said.
Bargaining Purposes
"My guess is that the war will be
; continued with a considerable degree j
! of persistence for some time if only !
| for bargaining purposes. Italy must ;
I continue to fight so that she will be
able to get something from the
! United Nations for ceasing to fight."
I Any separate peace, he said, must
j have the look of unconditional sur
; render. There will have to be Allied
! military control for the duration of
| the hostilities. Then, according to
j the principles of the Atlantic Char- I
ter, the Allies will have to set up an
Italian government of Italy. This will :
be very difficult because of the long
duration of Fascism in Italy.
The downfall of Mussolini is a step toward the withdrawal of Italy from
the war while she makes as cheap a peace as possible, according to opinions
expressed by Professors Stuart, Bailey, Fisher, and Buck in interviews with
The Stanford Daily.
Dr. Graham Stuart, professor of political science, believes that because of

the heavy bombings which the Ital-""
ian cities have suffered, especially
Naples, Italy has decided to get out
ol" the war as soon as suitable terms
can be arranged.
''Italy is suffering for no reason
and she sees no' hope of future vic
tory," he said.
In South America
Dr. Stuart believes that secret ne
gotiations will begin almost imme
diately now and Italy will try to see
if the "unconditional surrender"
proclaimed by President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill, at
Casablanca, will be applied in in its
more severe terms or if leniency will
be granted.
The Italian coup will affect Axis
prestige in Latin America, he said.
There are more Italians than any
nationality other than Spanish in
Latin America. Now that Italy seems
to be breaking away from the Axis,
the pressure which these people
automatically possess will now be
used on the side of the United Na
tions, and the increase in pressure
may even cause Argentina now to
break off diplomatic relations with
the Axis.
"Why Not Hitler?"
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, believes that the Allies are
' one step nearer victory as a -result
of the ousting of Mussolini."
Since Hitler and Mussolini have
been associated with aggression," he
said, "the defeat of one will make
possible the defeat of the other in the
minds of the public. If Mussolini can
be overthrown, why can't Hitler?"
There has been no evidence to in
dicate that the Fascist regime has
been thrown out. on the contrary,
this move seems to be a result of the
unpopularity of Mussolini himself.
Mussolini permitted the loss of the
Italian Empire in Africa and the in
vasion of Sicily, which will undoubt
edly end in an Allied victory. The
Italians acquired their empire at a
great expense of both men and ma
teriel and they did not like to see
them lost so easily.
Weakened Loyalty
Dr. Bailey said that it was Musso
lini's war from the very beginning;
the Italians never wanted to fight.
Dr. Harold H. Fisher, professor of
history, believes that this coup will
weaken the loyalty of the countries
in central Europe and in the Balkans
toward the Nazis.
"Hungary, Bulgaria, and Rumania
have been closer toward the Italians
than toward the Nazis," he said, "and,
consequently, the fall of Italy will
mean that it is possible that the fall
of Germany will not be long in
coming."
World War I Parallel
In comparing the situation with
| that of World War I, a definite
parallel can be seen. Dr. Fisher said.
Turkey was the first to fall, with
Bulgaria and Austro-Hungary fol
lowing. However, he pointed out, the
Germans of today are better prepared
to resist.
He believes that the change of
government indicates an Italian ef
fort to meet the conditions of the
Allies with as little sacrifice as pos
sible on the part of Italy.
"I think that the Badoglio ap
pointment is the cheapest price that
the Italians are offering for peace.
They are giving up as little as they
can. It doesn't represent any pro
found change in the situation in
Italy."
