# MUSSOLINI COUP
## Professors Say New Move Brings Italy Closer to Peace 
### Jean Hanssen 
The downfall of Mussolini is a step toward the withdrawal of Italy from
the war while she makes as cheap a peace as possible, according to opinions
expressed by Professors Stuart, Bailey, Fisher, and Buck in interviews with
The Stanford Daily.
Dr. Graham Stuart, professor of political science, believes that because of

the heavy bombings which the Ital-""
ian cities have suffered, especially
Naples, Italy has decided to get out
ol" the war as soon as suitable terms
can be arranged.
''Italy is suffering for no reason
and she sees no' hope of future vic

In South America
Dr. Stuart believes that secret ne
gotiations will begin almost imme

if the "unconditional surrender"
proclaimed by President Roosevelt
and Prime Minister Churchill, at
Casablanca, will be applied in in its
more severe terms or if leniency will
be granted.
The Italian coup will affect Axis
prestige in Latin America, he said.
There are more Italians than any
nationality other than Spanish in
Latin America. Now that Italy seems
to be breaking away from the Axis,
the pressure which these people
automatically possess will now be
used on the side of the United Na
tions, and the increase in pressure
may even cause Argentina now to
break off diplomatic relations with
the Axis.
"Why Not Hitler?"
Dr. Thomas A. Bailey, professor of
history, believes that the Allies are
' one step nearer victory as a -result
of the ousting of Mussolini."
Since Hitler and Mussolini have
been associated with aggression," he
said, "the defeat of one will make
possible the defeat of the other in the
minds of the public. If Mussolini can
be overthrown, why can't Hitler?"
There has been no evidence to in
dicate that the Fascist regime has
been thrown out. on the contrary,
this move seems to be a result of the
unpopularity of Mussolini himself.
Mussolini permitted the loss of the
Italian Empire in Africa and the in
vasion of Sicily, which will undoubt
edly end in an Allied victory. The
Italians acquired their empire at a
