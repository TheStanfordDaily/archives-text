Bayshore are the jobs done by the Stanford men volunteers.

All men who wish to work this
] weekend are asked to be on the
1 northbound side of the Palo Alto
I depot this Saturday or Sunday at
! 7:1)0 a.m. From there they will either
be taken by train to San Francisco
to df> special work in the San Fran
| cisco yards or else will be taken by
! truck to Mountain View to do track
! work.
Men are paid at the depot at the
: end of the day and may work a 10-
hour day. On Sunday, pay is 78 cents
an hour and on Saturday it is 52
cents. Traveling hours are counted
as work hours, according to Mr.
Moulthrop.
"Regular pay is 52 cents an hour,
and Sunday is time and a half," ex

Pacific handles the heaviest rail traf
fic in the West, and the help of the
Stanford men is certainly appre
ciated."
