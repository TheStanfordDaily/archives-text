# Allies Repulse Strong German Counterattack
## 
### 
ALLIED H.Q.. North Africa â€”
American and Canadian troops driv
ing abreast into northern Sicily have
hurled back a strong counterattack
by German forces who are bringing
in fresh troops by '"flying coffin"
transports and spotting them along
the front to watch their no longer
trusted Italian allies, it was reported
tonight.
RAF Spitfires shot down 21 Junk
ers transports packed with shock
troops in an air battle reminiscent of
the waning days of Tunisia when the
enemy made similar desperate at
tempts at reinforcements.
