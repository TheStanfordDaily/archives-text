# MURAL SOFTBALL
## Mural Loop Playoffs Near; All-Stars Will Flay Champs 
### 
i Alter the dust has settled on the
intramural diamonds next Monday
| night, and the Daily sports depart
i ment has figured the final standings,
j the teams will really begin playing
I ball.
The game which have preceded
j these playoffs have tended to show
: what caliber each team has, and how
| to place the teams in the champion
ship flight.
The schedule for the final pull
can't be released as yet, because of
I the closeness of the league race.
After the champion of champions
' is decided, the final game of the sea
son will find the Champs matching
j their prowess with an All-Star or
! ganization to be picked through a
I joint poll to be taken in the different
! houses. Each house should pick an
All-Opponent team, and the Daily
will make the final decision as to the
i winners. Names of the players will
not be necessary, only the team for
which he played, and his position.
A review of last Friday night's
I games found the Monroe vs. Cleve
j land contest to be outstanding. The
i contest got under way shortly after
| 7:30 p.m. and wound up seven innings

later at 7:55 p.m. with Monroe on '
the long end of a 2-0 eount.
Pitcher John Carr of Monroe gave
up but one hit, and not a runner '
reached rst base. Tom Ashley gave
up only three hits in going the route,
but these were grouped, and that
was the margin.
