### BILL STRUTHERS 
LIGHT CAMPUS CHATTER:
People You Don't Know About But Overheard on Quad: "Is
he a psych major or is he 4-F for moral reasons?" "Is he a pro
fessor or a butler?" "She's from Kansas City, Missouri, the big
best meat packing center in the country." "He's the Poet Laureate
of Salinas J.C." "We're sort of cousinsâ€”his sister-in-law's niece
married my uncle's brother-in-law." "I wouldn't be seen with her (
for a stack of A coupons." "He had a nervous breakdown trying
to classify the architecture of the Chapel." "She doesn't really
live at the Hacienda, does she?" "So I borrowed an Army uni
.form and hid for three days before anybody recognized me."
NOT SO LIGHT:
Louise Thille, Concert Series manager, risks lockouts finding
the missing nickel to balance the books before 10:30 every night.
John Charles Thomas, singer, probably risks forgetting his trip
to Stanford except for a reminder from his business manager.
The picture will be different when Louise and J.C.T. get together
under the sponsorship of the A.S.S.U. John will sing and Louise !
will beam and everybody will enjoy the concert and say that
Stanford shouldn't wait too long for the next one.
