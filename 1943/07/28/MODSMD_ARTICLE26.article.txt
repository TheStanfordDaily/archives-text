## Players To Use No Stage Sets 
### 
Without scenery and with the au
dience on all lour sides of the actors,
the Stanford Players will present
three of Noel Coward's plays in the
Memorial Theater on Aug. 11
through 14. The plays are "Family
Album," "Hands Across the Seas,"
and "Ways and Means."
The best-known examples of this
style of production which is much
like a circus, according to Mr. John
F. Sollers, director of the plays, are
those held in the University of
Washington Penthouse Theater. The
Penthouse holds 200 people and was
built especially for this type of pro
duction.
The Pasadena Bandbox Theater is
on much the same style.
Emphasis on Acting
Since the actors don't have scenery
for a background there is more em
phasis on the acting Jay itself, said
Mr. Sollers, and some directors say
that having the audience watch the
actor from all angles is equivalent to
acting before movie cameras where
the actors are photographed from all
angles.
"The audience seems to get pleas
ure out of the novelty of the arrange
ment, the intimacy with the actors as
they are practically sitting in the
room with the actors, and the ob
servation of other members of the
audience across the stage, according
to Mr. Sollers.
Audience on Stage
The audience for the plays will be
seated on comfortable chairs on
raised platforms on the big stage of
the Memorial Theater. The entrance
to the performance will be through
the Green Room.
"It has been found that fast mov
ing comedies and melodramas adapt
themselves best for this production,
according to Mr. Sollers, and conse
quently Noel Coward's plays are
ideal choices since they are all three
fast-moving, intimate comedies."
Ambitious Attempt
According to Mr. Sollers, "Family
Album" is the most ambitious at
tempt of the three as it contains inci
dental music, three or four songs,
and interpolated dancing.
The dances are under the direction
of Jacques Poley-Ogg. Dr. Herbert
Jan Popper is in charge of music for
the production.
Mr. Sollers ran a summer theater
the last two years in Idaho which
used this same procedure in pro
duction.

actor from all angles is equivalent to
acting before movie cameras where
the actors are photographed from all
angles.
"The audience seems to get pleas
ure out of the novelty of the arrange
ment, the intimacy with the actors as
they are practically sitting in the
room with the actors, and the ob
servation of other members of the
audience across the stage, according
to Mr. Sollers.
Audience on Stage
The audience for the plays will be
seated on comfortable chairs on
raised platforms on the big stage of
the Memorial Theater. The entrance
to the performance will be through
the Green Room.
"It has been found that fast mov
ing comedies and melodramas adapt
themselves best for this production,
according to Mr. Sollers, and conse
quently Noel Coward's plays are
ideal choices since they are all three
fast-moving, intimate comedies."
Ambitious Attempt
According to Mr. Sollers, "Family
Album" is the most ambitious at
tempt of the three as it contains inci
dental music, three or four songs,
and interpolated dancing.
The dances are under the direction
of Jacques Poley-Ogg. Dr. Herbert
Jan Popper is in charge of music for
the production.
Mr. Sollers ran a summer theater
the last two years in Idaho which
used this same procedure in pro
duction.
Without scenery and with the au
dience on all lour sides of the actors,
the Stanford Players will present
three of Noel Coward's plays in the
Memorial Theater on Aug. 11
through 14. The plays are "Family
Album," "Hands Across the Seas,"
and "Ways and Means."
The best-known examples of this
style of production which is much
like a circus, according to Mr. John
F. Sollers, director of the plays, are
those held in the University of
Washington Penthouse Theater. The
Penthouse holds 200 people and was
built especially for this type of pro
duction.
The Pasadena Bandbox Theater is
on much the same style.
Emphasis on Acting
Since the actors don't have scenery
for a background there is more em
phasis on the acting Jay itself, said
Mr. Sollers, and some directors say
that having the audience watch the
actor from all angles is equivalent to
acting before movie cameras where
the actors are photographed from all
angles.
