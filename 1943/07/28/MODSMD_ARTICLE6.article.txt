## London String Quartet Shows Mastery in Third Appearance 
### Steve Benedict 
i The third concert of the London String Quartet in Memorial Hall Audi
torium last night brought to mind several comparisons and conclusions
) concerning the group's efforts, both individually and collectively. The pro
j gram itself consisted of the single Verdi Quartet, the third and last Brahms
1 Quartet in B flat. Opus 67, and Haydn's Quartet in F major. Opus 74, No. 2.

One becomes more and more con
vinced with repeated hearings that
Mr. Primrose has now achieved a
mastery of his viola, both mechani
cally and interpretively, comparable
in our time only to that of Szigeti,
Casals, and Schpabel on the violin,
'cello, and piano, respectively.
Known by Hearsay
By hearsay we know of the
achievements on the viola of Lionel
Tertis and Paul Hindemith, but it is
hard to believe that there has ever
been a more consummate artist upon
this instrument than Mr. Primrose.
Long may he reign supreme!
It is also the belief of this writer
that, if only by virtue of his stylistic
mastery alone, Mr. Pennington is one
of our great violinists. Style, how
ever. is but one facet of Mr. Pen
nington's art. A superb command of
the dynamics of the instrument and
a thorough knowledge of both its
capacities and its limitations seem
further to distinguish his playing.
There is seldom a forced tone or an
inaccurately judged crescendo or di
minuendo. His greatness is indicated
by the very fact that while a member
of the quartet an inspired playing
style is characterized by a beautiful
restraint.
Two Fine Musicians
It would be a grave injustice, in
deed. if. while bestowing lavish
praise upon the foregoing artists,
mention were omitted of the two fine
musicians who constitute the other
half of the quartet. Both Mr. Evans
and Mr. Halleux are men of the ut
most musical integrity. Their un
erring command, also, of style and
phrasing should not be minimized.

'cello, and piano, respectively.
Known by Hearsay
By hearsay we know of the
achievements on the viola of Lionel
Tertis and Paul Hindemith, but it is
hard to believe that there has ever
been a more consummate artist upon
this instrument than Mr. Primrose.
Long may he reign supreme!
It is also the belief of this writer
that, if only by virtue of his stylistic
mastery alone, Mr. Pennington is one
of our great violinists. Style, how
ever. is but one facet of Mr. Pen
nington's art. A superb command of
the dynamics of the instrument and
a thorough knowledge of both its
capacities and its limitations seem
further to distinguish his playing.
There is seldom a forced tone or an
inaccurately judged crescendo or di
minuendo. His greatness is indicated
by the very fact that while a member
of the quartet an inspired playing
style is characterized by a beautiful
restraint.
Two Fine Musicians
It would be a grave injustice, in
deed. if. while bestowing lavish
praise upon the foregoing artists,
mention were omitted of the two fine
musicians who constitute the other
half of the quartet. Both Mr. Evans
and Mr. Halleux are men of the ut
most musical integrity. Their un
erring command, also, of style and
phrasing should not be minimized.
