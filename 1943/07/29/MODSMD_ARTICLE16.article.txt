# Stanford Oak Tree Loses Ground Because of Fungus
## 
### Bettye Monell 
Stanford lost one of its first alumnus recently. When the library was
built, its present location was determined by the two oak trees which stood
there. Today only one remains. The other was killed by fungus growth,
according to James McDonnell, superintendent of buildings and grounds.
A tree surgeon was called into consultation.
But the tree was so decayed that an undertaker was needed. Immediate

* removal was necessary because the
roots were so rotten that there was
danger of the tree falling on some
student as he went to the library to
study.
Nothing can be planted iri place of
the oak at present because the in
fected ground must be cured by al
j lowing chemicals to lie in it.
Stanford also lost another tree
[ during the week when the Santa Lu-
I cia pine in front of Hoover Library
had to be removed. The location of
this tree had been changed twice
| during the year and the shock of this
I moving had killed it.
: Woodmen, spare our trees, please!
