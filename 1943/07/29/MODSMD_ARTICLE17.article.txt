Dr. Hadley Kirkman, assistant
professor of anatomy, is now carry
ing on experiments with macro
phages in the kidney. It is thought
by some people that macrophages
are the source of antibodies, which
combat disease.
Though they have been studied
and experimented with in other parts
of (he body, Dr. Kirkman is one of
the first to study them in the kidney.
He has found, by accident, that they
are concentrated more in one part of
the kidney than another.
The kidneys are the main organ
for the excretion of nitrogeneous
products, such as urea, and conse
quently this work is very important.
