### LATE WILLIAMS 
This is about Stanford's football
situation for the coming season, but
thii time, the views come from the
Daily Californian's sports editor, in
stead of from this corner.
We haven't the space or the time
to waste by quoting word for word
what was said, so we will brief some
of their ideas.
To give you a rough idea of the
tone of the article, the opening re
mark was the following, "We don't
think that Stanford is taking the
right attitude towards its football sit
uation. For one thing, the Indians
seem to be giving up too easily."
This is a typical statement that we
would expect to be presented. It
shows that they know nothing of the
athletic situation that confronts Stan
ford.
Stanford is not giving up football.
Perhaps we will if conditions do not
improve, but as yet, there has been
no announcement to that fact. We
have little doubt that if it is remotely
possible for the Farm to field a team
in September, a team will be fielded.
The articles raves on and says,
"But there are still some 700 civilian
men on the Stanford campus which
is more than St. Mary's or Santa
Clara had even in their most pros
perous peacetime years."
Perhaps the same number of men,
and we doubt that, but certainly a
comparison between the caliber of
the 700 men at St. Mary's and Santa
Clara before the war, to the "700"
civilian men now at Stanford, is
nothing but a fantastic nightmare.
The Cal dreamer continues to rave
on. explaining that the Gaels and
Broncos are going to play ball, but
that "The Indians on the other hand
are ready to give up the sport at the
drop of a hat."
Now look, brother. Indications
might point to the fact that the In
dians are going to drop football, but
these are only indications. In fact,
Stanford has said nothing about
dropping any of their games which
have been scheduled.
The idea behind the Berkeley mas
terpiece lies in the concluding sent
ence. "We'd hate to see a great tra
dition like the California-Stanford
Big Game pass into oblivion." We
would too, but obviously for an en
tirely different reason.
