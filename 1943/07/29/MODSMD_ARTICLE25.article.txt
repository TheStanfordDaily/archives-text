# Boathouse Vies With Gerona
## 
### 
With only two more days of play
left on the schedule, the pennant race
of the President's Softball League
has developed into a tossup between
Gerona A.C. and the Boathouse Boys.
Both have won 10 games and lost
only 1, while their nearest rival, the
1 Firehouse, has a record of 7 and 2.
The only loss for the Boathouse
i Boys came early in the season at the
! hands of Gerona. Since then they
have blazed their way through the
opposition with little trouble. The
high-riding Gerona aggregation went
undefeated through most of the sea
son. only to fall to underrated Fill
more.
Gerona has the best of the rest of
the schedule, playing lowly Hayes
and Cleveland. It's conceivable that
Cleveland might pull a surprise, but
Hayes, with a record of one victory
against nine defeats, should be easy
meat. The Boathouse, on the other
hand, comes up against two fairly
tough teams, Tyler and Monroe.
Monroe, an "in and out" team all
season, can spring a few fireworks if
they get hot.
