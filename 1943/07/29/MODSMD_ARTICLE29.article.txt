WE BOAST of the part the United States is playing in the war
—we feel each minor victory is all our doing. We talk of
our sacrifices on the various fronts, and of the heroic dead who
have fought for democracy. In a recent poll of the United States,
the opinion was that we, more than any other nation, had done
r he most towards eventual victory.
Yet look at the actual facts. Comparative statistics through the
month of June, 1943, show:
U.S. war dead since Pearl Harbor—ls,l23.
U.S. traffic dead in the same period —40,000.
These few numbers tell a long tale. They speak little of the
materiel contributions of our country in this struggle. But in
comparison to other countries, they show that our human sacri
fices have been few and insignificant. Personal bereavements
due to the war can be considered "for a glorious cause," if the
ndividual is-inclined towards patriotic thinking at such a time.
But for every American killed in battle, nearly three times as
many have been killed on the well known home front. These
sacrifices are neither glorious nor for a worthy cause. They are
cruel and careless, unnecessary and unjustifiable.
Before we can speak of "our heroic dead," before we can
squirm over reports of Americans killed, before we can speak of
our losses and sacrifices, we should note the other figures—the
numbers killed at home.
