# Bull Session
## 
### BILL STRUTHERS 
I'm trying to work out a theory on a theory about my pro
longed mid-quarter lethargy. You see I'm in a rut right here on
campus that is the size of the Grand Canyon. Perhaps I need a
rest. Perhaps I need a laxative. I perhaps should listen to the
Pepsi-Cola commercial that starts, "Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle . . . Boy
what a drink ..." a few more million times.
But I've got to do something. The symptoms are serious.
Why, the other night I caught myself talking to my roommate on
the responsibility of the family in American democracy just as
though I were delivering a graduation address at Paly High.
Monday morning I ran to get to my 9 o'clock in time, and when I
got there I didn't even get 50 per cent right on a true-false mid
quarter. On top of that I can't figure out whether Kay Hammond's
cat that hangs around the Daily Shack is a male or a female.
Little things get on my nerves. Lipstick on the cups at the
Cellar. Emptiness in my post office box. No coke in the coke
machine. The bulge in the right rear tire on my car. It's gotten so
that I don't distinguish between the STAR dance this Saturday
and the Blood Bank next Thursday but I know that I am going to
both.
My theory is based on the Palo Alto laundry tie-up. You see
[ haven't had a clean shirt for a week and don't expect one till
after finals. One can't beam or be brilliant in a dirty shirt, can
one?
So read the tail end of yesterday's Bull Session that didn't
quite get printed:
ALSO. If you aren't going to study all the time next weekend,
the dance is on the STARS this time. They really plan on keep
ing up with the high set by the ASTUS. The music will come
from 16 live musicians, all playing right here on campus at one
time. This is darn good when you realize that American Legion
Post 117, San Leandro, has to use records for its annual dance.
On top of the orchestra is the "Hayes Hall Swing Society of
the Lower Row" (for lack of another name.) They started as a trio,
but may be a quintet by now. Maybe you heard then: the night
I did. They had a piano, a clarinet, and a drummer with one stick.
Whatever they are, they'll sound good at the STAR dance this
Saturdav.

both.
My theory is based on the Palo Alto laundry tie-up. You see
[ haven't had a clean shirt for a week and don't expect one till
after finals. One can't beam or be brilliant in a dirty shirt, can
one?
So read the tail end of yesterday's Bull Session that didn't
quite get printed:
ALSO. If you aren't going to study all the time next weekend,
the dance is on the STARS this time. They really plan on keep
ing up with the high set by the ASTUS. The music will come
from 16 live musicians, all playing right here on campus at one
time. This is darn good when you realize that American Legion
Post 117, San Leandro, has to use records for its annual dance.
On top of the orchestra is the "Hayes Hall Swing Society of
the Lower Row" (for lack of another name.) They started as a trio,
but may be a quintet by now. Maybe you heard then: the night
I did. They had a piano, a clarinet, and a drummer with one stick.
Whatever they are, they'll sound good at the STAR dance this
Saturdav.
I'm trying to work out a theory on a theory about my pro
longed mid-quarter lethargy. You see I'm in a rut right here on
campus that is the size of the Grand Canyon. Perhaps I need a
rest. Perhaps I need a laxative. I perhaps should listen to the
Pepsi-Cola commercial that starts, "Tinkle, tinkle, tinkle . . . Boy
what a drink ..." a few more million times.
But I've got to do something. The symptoms are serious.
Why, the other night I caught myself talking to my roommate on
the responsibility of the family in American democracy just as
though I were delivering a graduation address at Paly High.
Monday morning I ran to get to my 9 o'clock in time, and when I
got there I didn't even get 50 per cent right on a true-false mid
quarter. On top of that I can't figure out whether Kay Hammond's
cat that hangs around the Daily Shack is a male or a female.
Little things get on my nerves. Lipstick on the cups at the
Cellar. Emptiness in my post office box. No coke in the coke
machine. The bulge in the right rear tire on my car. It's gotten so
that I don't distinguish between the STAR dance this Saturday
and the Blood Bank next Thursday but I know that I am going to
both.
