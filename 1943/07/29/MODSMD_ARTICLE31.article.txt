# London Quartet finishes Series At 8 Tomorrow
## 
### 
The present series of chamber mu
sic concerts by the London String
Quartet, now being given at Stan
ford, are sponsored by the Elizabeth
Sprague Coolidge Foundation of the
Library of Congress, as have been
the chamber music series given at
this university for many summers
past. The quartet will conclude its
series tomorrow night at 8 in Me
morial Auditorium.
Mrs. Coolidge, who has done more
for chamber music in the United
States than any other one person,
began her career as the "good angel"
of the small music ensemble about
15 years ago when she financially
backed the chamber music at the an
nual Birkshire Festivals.
Since that time she has taken nu
merous chamber music groups under
her wing and sponsored concerts at
university campuses all over the
United States.
Mrs. Coolidge is a composer in her
own name, having written a quartet
which was recorded by Victor Rec
ords. Many contemporary composers
have dedicated compositions to her
because of her never tiring work in
the interest of chamber music.
Tomorrow's program will include a
quartet by the contemporary Russian
composer Dimitri Szostakowicz, as
well as quartets by Beethoven and
Mozart.
