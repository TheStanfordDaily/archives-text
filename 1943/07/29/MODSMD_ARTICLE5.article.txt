# Badoglio Ousts Fascist Party
## 
### 
LONDON. July 28â€”Marshal Pietro
Badoglio swept the Fascist grand
council and its dread secret courts
from the minds of the Italian nation
by special decree tonight as police
started mass arrests of Fascist news
paper executives and radio propa
gandists, and turbulent crowds dem
onstrated against Fascism and for
peace.
Badoglio's special decree made
formal the dissolution of the entire
Fascist party. Men long exiled were
returning to Italy and newspapers
long suppressed by the Fascists were
springing into life.
