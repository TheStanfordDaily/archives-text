### Adolph Gugel 
The final concert of the London
String Quartet will be held tonight
at 8 in Memorial Hall, the program
comprising quartets by Szostakowicz,
Beethoven, and Mozart.
The Quartet in C major, Opus 49,
by the much publicized contempo
rary Russian composer, Dimitri
Szostakowicz, will be the first work
on the program. Although it is hard
ly for this generation to decide as to
the importance of Szostakowicz as a
composer, the fact remains that his
compositions have attained tremen
dous popularity, especially in the last
few eyars.
The feature work on the program
is, of course, Beethoven's great
Quartet in B flat major. Opus 130,
which the composer affectionately
dubbed his "Liebquartet."
The final movement of the quartet
was the last work that Beethoven
ever wrote, the original finale being
withdrawn because it was a bigger
bite than the music public of that
time could chew.
The program will conclude with
the Quartet in D major (K. 575) by
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
