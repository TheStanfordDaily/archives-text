Among many peculiar happenings
in the major leagues this year is the
latest involving the Philadelphia
Phillies and the managership of that
club.
It seems that Owner Bill Cox per
suaded the owner of the Brooklyn
Dodgers, Branch Rickey, to give
Freddy Fitzsimmons his uncondi
tional release so that he could take
over the management of the Phillies.
What really crossed everyone up was
an announcement to come from the
Dodgers to the effect that Fitz was to
manage the Phillies.
Change of Pilots
No one had any idea that there was
going to be a change of managers in
that "city of brotherly love." The
announcement was the first indica
tion that Bucky Harris, the manager
at the time, had that he was going
to be out of a job.
The reason was given that the
players were discontented, so what
should happen when Fitz comes to
take over the club, but that the play
ers go on strike. Harris talked to the
players and they agreed to go back
and play ball. That same day, the
team broke the 11-day win streak of
the St. Louis Cards by scoring four
runs in the first inning and coasting
in from there on in.
Ofl to a Good Start
Bill Cox is new at this baseball
racket. It's about time that he finds
out that he can't push ball players
around. Cox got off to a good start
in Philadelphia and the fans liked
him, for he gave them a winning
team for a change. Unless he changes
his habits a little, the fans are going
to change their minds about Cox. A
word to the wise is sufficient.
Talking about major league ball,
a few poeple on campus have asked
for more info on the teams. When
ever there is room on the page, we
will put the scores and pitchers in.
