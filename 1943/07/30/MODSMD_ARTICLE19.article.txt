With only two more nights of play
left in the regular season's schedule
of the President's League, it looks
as if Gerona and Boathouse will fin
ish out their season tied as they are
for the number one position.
Gerona had better watch its step
tonight when it comes up against the
heretofore impotent Hayes squad, as
that team has been preparing all
quarter for this game. It has been
rumored that for once they will field
a full team.
The Boathouse Boys will also have
a tough time tonight when they cross
bats with the men of Monroe Hall.
Monroe has won more games than
any other living group on campus
and is therefore a team worthy of
mention. The Boathouse must be
favored, however, because of its im
pressive victory over the Firehouse.
The third-place Firehouse should
have an easy time tonight against
last-place Arthur Hall. It won't even
be close, according to the standings.
