## ARMY SOFTBALL ASTP Ten Defeats Monroe 5 to 3, Proves Strong Club 
### 
j Moryoe answered the Army's
j challenge last night to a softball
game, and was in turn treated to a
neat 5-3 setback. The Army ten
fielded a team that proved to be solid
I as far as pitching strength went, and
I weak as a hitting club. Their pitch
ing was all that they needed.
Late Williams started on the
mound for Monroe and held the
Army scoreless for two innings. In
the third canto, the ASTP men
j pushed across a marker as the result
I of a walk and a costly error at third
! base.
In their half of the third, Monroe
tied the count, mainly due to fast
base running on the part of Bob
| Fess, third baseman, and a line single
1 to right field by Ken Sharp.
I The fonrth inning looked like
| ladies' day, with Williams making
i more free passes than the bases could

hold, and Fess finally coming in to
relieve him and stop the flood of
runs. The damage was done.
The Army men will accept any
challenges offered, and will play any
evening except Saturday. They also
have two good bats, men.
