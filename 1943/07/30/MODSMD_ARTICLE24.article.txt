# To the Faculty
## 
### 
WE SPEAK a lot about those who are working and sweating
for the war effort. And when the term is mentioned, we
think of the men on the graveyard shifts in essential industries,
of service men in rigorous training programs, of volunteer Red
Cross workers, and of harassed public servants in Washington.
Bringing the war effort closer to the campus, we think of those
students who spend Saturdays at the Convalescent Home Vic
tory garden, of the stamp committees, the salvage committees,
and the War Board workers.
Nearly all the people we think of as connected with the war
effort are those in extraordinary circumstances, or those who are
doing something off their beaten path for the first time.
Yet, there is a group here on the campus composed of men
and women who have guietly stuck to their jobs through all the
mad scramble to join up with "essential outfits." These people
*re just as overworked, just as tired at night, just as indispensable
in their jobs as the glorified man in welder's hood or the idolized
commando in steel helmet.
It is the members of the faculty have taken on the added
•duties of training the hundreds of soldiers on the campus—2,ooo
soldiers taking 27 units is equivalent to nearly 4,000 civilian stu
dents. And they are further burdened with irregular hours—and
12 o'clock classes.
To the old standbys, to those whose service is training young
minds for big problems, to those who work quietly in research
laboratories and libraries, our nomination for recognition as "in
dispensable in an essential industry."
