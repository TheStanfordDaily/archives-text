# SPANISH FILM
## Mexican States Star in Movie 
### 
The Mexican states of Jalisco and
Michoacan will be the subject of
travelogues in color, with comments
in English, Sunday night when the
Spanish honor society presents its
motion picture program.
The program, to be given at 7:15 in
the school of Education auditorium,
will feature the Argentine film "Los
Caranchos de la Florida.'' a regular
commercial Spanish-language pic
cure based on the novel of an Argen
tine writer.
Rael Praises Film
Dr. Juan B. Rael, assistant profes
sor of Spanish, says that this film is
'the best picture I've ever seen." He
points out the excellent photography
and the wonderful shots of the pam
pas. "The acting," he says, "is far
superior to that of any other Argen
tine pictux - e."
The vast pampas of central Argen
tina form the setting for a drama of
tragic realism in this picture.
The travelogues have been se
cured, after trying for a couple of
years, through the cooperation of the
Consul of Mexico in San Francisco.
They picture two of the most pic
turesque regions of all Mexico. The
adjoining states of Jalisco and Mi
choacan are located in central Mex
ico, on the Pacific coast.
Film Features Mexican Life
Jalisco, with its capital of Guada
lajara, is the home of much of the old
aristocracy of Mexico. Its inhabi
tants, who are called taptios, origi
nated the famous Mexican hat dance,
the jarabe tapatio, and are still its
most famous exponents. Add to that
the fact that Jalisco is noted in Mex
ico for its beautiful women.
Michoacan is noted also for the
gaudy jicaras, or brightly colored
lacquer trays, which the Indians
make.
