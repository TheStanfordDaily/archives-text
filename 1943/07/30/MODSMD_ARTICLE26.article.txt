## 'Pilot 5' Lacks Central Plot 
### 
PILOT NUMBER s—Now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
M-G-M seldom releases a really
bad picture, but in "Pilot Number
5" Franchot Tone, Marsha Hunt, and
Gene Kelly find themselves thrown
into a wretched story that deals with
everything from corrupt politics to
the bombing of Japs, with a morbid
murder thrown in for good measure.
Franchot Tone plays the title role,
and his career as a political heel be
fore joining the air corps is told in
Hashback style. Marsha Hunt can't
seem to decide whether she prefers
Tone or his partner in politics, Gene
Kelly, and spends most of the pic
ture deciding.
'"Pilot Number 5" was produced on
a shoestring, with false scenery and
airplanes on strings abounding'. The
cast struggles along as ebst it can,
but can't make much headway with
such an involved and twisted plot.
"Saludos Amigos," the second at
traction, is a Walt Disney production
that takes the cinemagoer on a myth
ical tour of South America along
with our old friends Donald Duck
and Goofy, together with newcomers
Pedro the Airplane and man-about
town Joe Carioca. The color is good,
but the music falls below the usual
Disney standard. —Bowen
