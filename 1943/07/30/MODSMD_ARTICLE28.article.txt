# TUES. SERIES
## 'Damask Cheek' To Be Read 
### 
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington will
give a reading of "The Damask
Cheek" in the Tuesday Evening
Series, Aug. 3, at 8 p.m. in the Audi
torium of the Memorial Hall, it was
announced yesterday by the Com
mittee on Public Exercises.
Written by John van Druten and
Lloyd Morris, the play is a comedy
dealing with New York in 1909 and
an English girl who visits a well to
do New York family.
Mrs. Farrington has portrayed the
various members of the families in
"The Barrets of Wimpole Street"
and "Life With Father" in previous
Tuesday Series readings. In "The
Damask Cheek" she will have a
chance to play characters ranging in
age from 16 to 60.
Mrs. Farrington's ability to create
living people on a bare stage without
benefit of stage-sets, scenery, or cos
tumes gives her audience the illusion
of having witnessed a stage perform
ance. During the past year she has
appeared in a series of radio pro
grams on radio station KGO, and is
soon to begin a new series.
Acclaimed by New York critics as
a human and extremely pleasant bit
of entertainment, "The Damask
Cheek" recaptures the spirit of
America at the turn of the century.
