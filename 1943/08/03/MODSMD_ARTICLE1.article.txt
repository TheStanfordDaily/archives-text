# Cannery Issues Urgent Appeal For Workers
## 
### 
The Sutter Packing Co. in May
field is urgently in need of men and
women workers every night from 7
to 12 p.m. and from 1 to 5 a.m., ac
cording to Betty May Hale, War
Board Coordinator. Transportation
is not furnished, but the cannery is
six blocks below the highway at
May field.
. '"Students can catch the Mayfield
bus," said Miss Hale. "This is one of
tiie most urgent calls. The crops are
spoiling simply for lack of workers,
and it's up to students to help. Those
wishing to work can sign up in the
War Board office beforehand."
Volunteers
Mrs. Maria Hoge, director of the
Office of Inter-American Relations
at the Hoover War Libe, reports that
she took five Stanford students to
work at the cannery on Friday night
and they found that the A.F. of L.
has not completely lifted union ob
ligations of war emergency workers.
'"It seems that students must be
come union affiliates, although not
union members," said Miss Hoge.
'"Being an affiliate means that the
workers must pay 25 cents for his
badge and 50 cents each week he
works toward the union. The group
I took to the cannery Friday couldn't
work because they didn't have work
permit cards and neither did they
happen to have the necessary change
to pay for their badges."
Union Dues
(Regular union members pay $2.50
at the beginning, $2.50 after the first
month, and $1 monthly union dues
thereafter.)
''With the union situation such as
it is, profits will be very little," said
Miss Hale. "But just because the
union may cause a tie-up, there is
no reason why students can't come
through."
