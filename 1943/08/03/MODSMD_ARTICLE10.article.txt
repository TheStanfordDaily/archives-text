fathers, 18 through 37. will be sub
ject to induction into the aruiei
forces ''without distinction regarding
the number or ages of their depend
ent children.''
He stressed that the decision to ta-.i
the pool of 6,559.000 class 3-A regis
trants did not mean abolition of the
3-A classification. Men will be re
classified out of that group only a.
needed to meet the demands of loe..
boards, he said.
The WMC directive set forth on';
two conditions as a possible basis ic.
deferment:
1. Fathers who are key men i -
agriculture or essential industries.
2. Fathers whose induction wou.:
cause extreme hardship and priva
tion to their families.
McNutt said the decision to re
move the ban on drafting of fathers
was forced by the approaching ex
haustion of other pools of registrants
He said that fathers would be in
ducted only as absolutely necessary
to meet monthly calls that cannot be
filled by other eligibles.
