ments for a joint meeting of the li
aison committee for international ed
ucation and the international edu
cation assembly, an unofficial group
of educators from the United Nations.

posed of representatives from all over
the United States, presided over by

International
A plan calling first for a temporary
and finally a permanent international
organization for education of the
post-war world with the cooperation
of all nations has been advanced by
Dean Kefauver and will undergo
consideration.
Under thjs plan a temporary Inter
national Commission on Education
should be formed without delay to

develop recommendations for the
handling of education in the peace
treaty. He also suggests that the
committee should assist the new Axis
governments in the reconstruction of
their programs of education to har
monize with an internationally ac
cepted pattern of social goals and
values.
Public Understanding
This commission would also study
and propose means to aid public un
derstanding of the interdependence
among nations today, the peace aims
of the United Nations, and the prob
lems of the post-war world.
According to the second part of
Dean Kefauver's plan, a permanent
international education commission
would be founded with the aim to
"advance human welfare through
education in all countries."
Representatives
In his proposed organization, the
highest body would be composed of
five representatives from each mem
ber nation. Working with it would
be regional education assemblies of
delegates from geographical units,
national commissions made up of the
international assembly members,
technical commissions appointed to
make special studies, and a govern
ing board composed of representa
tives of Great Britain, China, the So
viet Union, and the United States.
If Dr. Kefauver's plan were ac
cepted. an international office would
be established, which would be con
trolled by the governing board. The
organization would be financed by
the member nations.

aison committee for international ed
ucation and the international edu
cation assembly, an unofficial group

posed of representatives from all over
the United States, presided over by

International
A plan calling first for a temporary
and finally a permanent international
organization for education of the
post-war world with the cooperation
of all nations has been advanced by
Dean Kefauver and will undergo
consideration.
Under thjs plan a temporary Inter
national Commission on Education
should be formed without delay to

develop recommendations for the
handling of education in the peace
treaty. He also suggests that the
committee should assist the new Axis
governments in the reconstruction of
their programs of education to har
monize with an internationally ac
cepted pattern of social goals and
values.
Public Understanding
This commission would also study
and propose means to aid public un
derstanding of the interdependence
among nations today, the peace aims
of the United Nations, and the prob
lems of the post-war world.
According to the second part of
Dean Kefauver's plan, a permanent
international education commission
would be founded with the aim to
"advance human welfare through
education in all countries."
Representatives
In his proposed organization, the
highest body would be composed of
five representatives from each mem
ber nation. Working with it would
be regional education assemblies of
delegates from geographical units,
national commissions made up of the
international assembly members,
technical commissions appointed to
make special studies, and a govern
ing board composed of representa
tives of Great Britain, China, the So
viet Union, and the United States.
If Dr. Kefauver's plan were ac
cepted. an international office would
be established, which would be con
trolled by the governing board. The
organization would be financed by
the member nations.
