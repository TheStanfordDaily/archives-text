# Unusual Plot Featured in New Comedy

### 
MK. LUCKY—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Since the war, the good pictures
coming out of Hollywood have been
lew and far between, and "Mr.
I Lucky" is one of those few pictures
j in which the film capital gives out its
best.
The exceedingly clever plot is
I sparked by both comedy and drama
| and the picture is quite well cast.
Cary Grant plays the part of a
j big-time gambler who takes the
' name of a deceased comrade in order
to evade the draft. In order to get
[ money so that his gambling boat can
| go to Havana, he becomes involved
i with a female-run war relief agency.
One of these females is Laraine Day
and of course the plot thickens. Of
interest are Mr. Grant's striking ties.
The high point of the picture was
when Cary Grant was being taught
to knit with a whole crowd of men
j staring at him through the store
' window.
I Second feature was a dismal west
j ern comedy, "Calaboose" starring
j Noah Beery Jr. —Gugel
