# LATE TIPS

### LATE WILLIAMS 
Ah. come on men, kick through.
This is directed to the managers of
the different Softball teams in the
President's League. It is a plea, and
not a demand.
Last week we mentioned that
there would be a playoff for the soft
ball title, and. following that, there
would be an All-Star game with the
Champs. The All-Stars were to be
made up of the players that the dif
ferent players in the league were
supposed to choose. (Confusing, but
nevertheless true.)
Now—what we want to say is—
the all-opponent teams are not com
ing in very fast. In fact, we might
say that tilings are at a standstill.
This ain't good. This ain't good at aIJ.
Unless we get some suggestions as
to the outstanding men, the whole
idea will probably be a farce. A
farce in nine innings. Let's get on
the ball, men. Let's geev heem ze
works. In other words, get in there—
AND FIGHT! Please turn in your
selections, managers, as soon as pos
sible. Nuff said.
Here We Go Again
In our last three columns there has
been nothing about football, and like
a deep river, we think that the situ
ation must be brought from the
depths slowly.

We talked to Marchie Schwartz
yesterday, as the football mentor was
i enroute to the tennis courts. We
wanted to lind out exactly what he
thought of the situation on the Farm,
and how the thing was going to wind
up.
We said: "Hello Marchie, what do
you think of the football situation?
Marchie said: ''There is nothing to
think about. We still have 10 games
booked for us."
We said: "Meaning that we will
play football?"
Mam-hie continued with: "Mean
ing that we still have 10 games sched
uled and that's all. I don't know any
more than the next fellow how this
thing is going to come out."
Marchie continued to continue
with: "Well, I have to go now, how
ever, if you want to talk the situation
over with me, I'll be at the tennis
{ courts."
Schwartz
Figuring that Schwartz knew noth
ing about the situation in the first
place, we could see no reason to
swelter in the sun and find out more
nothing of the nothing we already
knew. (It must be the heat.)
Anyway, we have a feeling that in
maybe a couple of days, we can make
a definite statement of some kind or
other about football.
It may be important, and it may be
! just a filler, but nevertheless, we
have the feeling that something will
come up. If we get scooped by the
Chronicle again, we're washed up.
We distinctly remember the mem
: orable day this quarter when the
i B.A.C. folded. The day before the
I thing happened, we had been at the
B.ArG. and they said that nothing
was going on. They had a top story
1 in the "Green Sheet," we followed
the thing up with a sensational one
inch job. That's life.

not a demand.
Last week we mentioned that
there would be a playoff for the soft
ball title, and. following that, there
would be an All-Star game with the
Champs. The All-Stars were to be
made up of the players that the dif
ferent players in the league were
supposed to choose. (Confusing, but
nevertheless true.)
Now—what we want to say is—
the all-opponent teams are not com
ing in very fast. In fact, we might
say that tilings are at a standstill.
This ain't good. This ain't good at aIJ.
Unless we get some suggestions as
to the outstanding men, the whole
idea will probably be a farce. A
farce in nine innings. Let's get on
the ball, men. Let's geev heem ze
works. In other words, get in there—
AND FIGHT! Please turn in your
selections, managers, as soon as pos
sible. Nuff said.
Here We Go Again
In our last three columns there has
been nothing about football, and like
a deep river, we think that the situ
ation must be brought from the
depths slowly.

We talked to Marchie Schwartz
yesterday, as the football mentor was
i enroute to the tennis courts. We
wanted to lind out exactly what he
thought of the situation on the Farm,
and how the thing was going to wind
up.
We said: "Hello Marchie, what do
you think of the football situation?
Marchie said: ''There is nothing to
think about. We still have 10 games
booked for us."
We said: "Meaning that we will
play football?"
Mam-hie continued with: "Mean
ing that we still have 10 games sched
uled and that's all. I don't know any
more than the next fellow how this
thing is going to come out."
Marchie continued to continue
with: "Well, I have to go now, how
ever, if you want to talk the situation
over with me, I'll be at the tennis
{ courts."
Schwartz
Figuring that Schwartz knew noth
ing about the situation in the first
place, we could see no reason to
swelter in the sun and find out more
nothing of the nothing we already
knew. (It must be the heat.)
Anyway, we have a feeling that in
maybe a couple of days, we can make
a definite statement of some kind or
other about football.
It may be important, and it may be
! just a filler, but nevertheless, we
have the feeling that something will
come up. If we get scooped by the
Chronicle again, we're washed up.
We distinctly remember the mem
: orable day this quarter when the
i B.A.C. folded. The day before the
I thing happened, we had been at the
B.ArG. and they said that nothing
was going on. They had a top story
1 in the "Green Sheet," we followed
the thing up with a sensational one
inch job. That's life.
Ah. come on men, kick through.
This is directed to the managers of
the different Softball teams in the
President's League. It is a plea, and
not a demand.
