FROM THE TICKERâ€”A detach- 1
ment of 190 "Seabees" on duty in the !
Southwest Pacific decided they want- j

bought $37,800 worth of War Bonds.
The Navy said a check for that
amount had been received by the
Treasury and bonds with a maturity
value of $54,400 will be placed to the I
"Seabees' " credit.
The bond drive among the Navy's
combat construction unit was ini- |
tiated by Paul Houser, carpenter's J
mate, third class, of 1615 Admiral :
