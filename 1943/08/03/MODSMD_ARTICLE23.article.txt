# Hulse Paces Hagg To Mile Record
## 
### 
The Americans have finally found
a man who can compete closely with
Sweden's Gunder Hagg. His name is
Bill Hulse. It was Hulse who set the
pace that forced Hagg to set a new
American mile record of 4:05.3 in
Boston a little over a week ago. It
was this same Hulse who finished a
mere yard behind Hagg in the time
of 4:05.4 in Cleveland just last Sat
urday.
Perhaps it will be Hulse who might
force the Scandinavian to a new
world record at Cincinnati next Sat
urday. Perhaps he himself will set
the mark with Hagg trailing. Then'
is no doubt now that Hulse and no'
Gil Dodds is the main competition
for Hagg.
