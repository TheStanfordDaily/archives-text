rHE fury of Berlin master propagandist has again been un
leashed against the Allies.
Berlin radio yesterday attacked the announcement of Britain,
(he United States, and Russia asking neutral nations of the world
to grant no asylum to Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo or any other "war
criminals" who may seek "to escape their just deserts."
Attempting to arouse the anger of neutral nations and their
own subjugated countries, Berlin radio said that the joint an
nouncement was "characteristic of the height of arrogance, im
pudence, and contempt of the law that the Allied governments
have reached."
It termed the move as a "gross violation" of international law
and stated:
"It is one of the most primitive human rights to grant refuge
:o the persecuted. The political right of the refugee plays a spe
cial part in international law."
According to international law, it is the right of each country
to admit persons or to refuse them entrance into their country.
It is discretionary with a country whether it gives refuge to a
fugitive.
In the first World War, Kaiser Wilhelm fled from Germany
and was given refuge in the Netherlands; he was a political
.refugee and as such could not be extradited.
Criminals, under international law, may be extradited if the
country asking for extradition can prove his criminal guilt. If a
neutral country such as Switzerland, Spain, or Argentina were to
grant refuge to any Axis political leader, we could not extradite
them as political refugees for war guilt trials which President
Roosevelt said the United Nations would conduct after the war
without the consent of the harboring country.
But the President, in his joint announcement, termed the Axis
leaders "war criminals." Never before have we had "war crim
inals"; if these men are considered such we could extradite them
under international law if we could prove our case to the country
harboring them.
It would be long and difficult to prove Mussolini and Hitler
were actual criminals. If the neutral nations do not give them
asylum, our job of bringing justice to bear upon those men who
.have murdered ruthlessly, persecuted viciously, and brought
this war upon the world will be speeded.
The announcement was merely a petition and a plea—not a
threat—to the neutrals to assist us in this task. It reaffirmed our
.intentions to conduct war guilt trials. It is clearly not a violation
cf international law.
Berlin obviously is looking forward to the day when the Axis
leaders will have to flee and seek refuge. Goebbels is trying to
lengthen the rope. But it is ironic that the nation which accuses
us of violating international law is the nation that has repeatedly
violated it—if only each time a gestapo murders a civilian or a
hostage of war.—Vashti O'Donnell

Criminals, under international law, may be extradited if the
country asking for extradition can prove his criminal guilt. If a
neutral country such as Switzerland, Spain, or Argentina were to
grant refuge to any Axis political leader, we could not extradite
them as political refugees for war guilt trials which President
Roosevelt said the United Nations would conduct after the war
without the consent of the harboring country.
But the President, in his joint announcement, termed the Axis
leaders "war criminals." Never before have we had "war crim
inals"; if these men are considered such we could extradite them
under international law if we could prove our case to the country
harboring them.
It would be long and difficult to prove Mussolini and Hitler
were actual criminals. If the neutral nations do not give them
asylum, our job of bringing justice to bear upon those men who
.have murdered ruthlessly, persecuted viciously, and brought
this war upon the world will be speeded.
The announcement was merely a petition and a plea—not a
threat—to the neutrals to assist us in this task. It reaffirmed our
.intentions to conduct war guilt trials. It is clearly not a violation
cf international law.
Berlin obviously is looking forward to the day when the Axis
leaders will have to flee and seek refuge. Goebbels is trying to
lengthen the rope. But it is ironic that the nation which accuses
us of violating international law is the nation that has repeatedly
violated it—if only each time a gestapo murders a civilian or a
hostage of war.—Vashti O'Donnell
rHE fury of Berlin master propagandist has again been un
leashed against the Allies.
Berlin radio yesterday attacked the announcement of Britain,
(he United States, and Russia asking neutral nations of the world
to grant no asylum to Hitler, Mussolini, Tojo or any other "war
criminals" who may seek "to escape their just deserts."
Attempting to arouse the anger of neutral nations and their
own subjugated countries, Berlin radio said that the joint an
nouncement was "characteristic of the height of arrogance, im
pudence, and contempt of the law that the Allied governments
have reached."
It termed the move as a "gross violation" of international law
and stated:
"It is one of the most primitive human rights to grant refuge
:o the persecuted. The political right of the refugee plays a spe
cial part in international law."
According to international law, it is the right of each country
to admit persons or to refuse them entrance into their country.
It is discretionary with a country whether it gives refuge to a
fugitive.
In the first World War, Kaiser Wilhelm fled from Germany
and was given refuge in the Netherlands; he was a political
.refugee and as such could not be extradited.
