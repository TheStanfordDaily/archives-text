# North African Story

### 
A FEW days ago The Daily received a copy of a letter writ
ten by a soldier who fought in one of the major battles of the
North African campaign. An extremely well-written letter, it
tells a personal story and describes the men and fighting at El
Guettar, Sedjenane, and Mateur.
The letter in itself is interesting. But it should be of special
interest to Stanford, for it was written by Lt. Robert Springmeyer
who graduated in June, 1942.
Therefore, we are publishing the letter in four parts, begin
ning today, so that Daily readers may appreciate the experiences
of one member of the Stanford Family.
