# Life on Tunisian Battlefronts Related by Stanford Alumnus

### 
(Editor's Note: The Stanford Daily has received permission to publish
the following letter from a Stanford alumnus who fought with the Ameri
can forces in Tunisia. It will be printed in four installments this week.)
Lt. Robert L. Springmeyer, who graduated from Stanford in June, 1942.
wrote this personal account of the battlefront and the fighting conditions in

North Africa to his wife.
Lieutenant Springmeyer was
awarded the Purple Heart for
wounds received in action in the
campaign. He landed at North Africa
with the first American troops in
Casablanca, Nov. 7.
While at Stanford, Lieutenant
Springmeyer received the ordnance
scholarship award when he gradu
ated, was a member of Phi Beta
Kappa, and majored in engineering.

May 22,1943
Now the story can be told. When I
left the Third Division and went up
to the front for battle training, I was
attached to the Ninth Division for
the month.
When I arrived at the front area,
the Ninth was located in the area
eastof Gafsa and El Guettar. The
country there is very similar to that
around the salt flats in Utah. The
valley floors were flat and barren,
and the mountains rose abruptly into
high, rugged, rocky ridges.
El Guettar was just a small village
of Arab mud houses clustered around
an oasis. Everything down there was
dry and dusty. It was terrible coun
try for fighting. Many is the time
then and later that I felt truly sorry
for the poor doughboys (Infantry.)
"Gabes or Bust"
It was impossible to launch. Jerry
had all of the high ground up ahead.
The armored outfits tried such an
assault. The cry for them was "Gabes
or Bust." Well, on the first try it was
the latter. To drive Jerry from the
hills took the infantry, and was a
slow, dirty job.
Imagine the doughboys inching
their way forward in the gullies at
the bottoms of the mountains, dig
ging foxholes in the almost solid rock
to get under cover from the ex
tremely accurate enemy artillery and
mortar fire.
Dead Man
On one occasion I crossed a ridge
on foot, going to an advance com
mand post on a mine field recon
naissance. Lying there on the top
was a man dead with a gaping hole
where his stomach had been.
I later found out that a few min
utes before I came along this man
had been walking over the ridge I
did. The Germans felt a little play
ful, so they shot an 88 mm. cannon
at him. This gun is usually used to
penetrate the armor plate of tanks.

Now the story can be told. When I
left the Third Division and went up
to the front for battle training, I was
attached to the Ninth Division for
the month.
When I arrived at the front area,
the Ninth was located in the area
eastof Gafsa and El Guettar. The
country there is very similar to that
around the salt flats in Utah. The
valley floors were flat and barren,
and the mountains rose abruptly into
high, rugged, rocky ridges.
El Guettar was just a small village
of Arab mud houses clustered around
an oasis. Everything down there was
dry and dusty. It was terrible coun
try for fighting. Many is the time
then and later that I felt truly sorry
for the poor doughboys (Infantry.)
"Gabes or Bust"
It was impossible to launch. Jerry
had all of the high ground up ahead.
The armored outfits tried such an
assault. The cry for them was "Gabes
or Bust." Well, on the first try it was
the latter. To drive Jerry from the
hills took the infantry, and was a
slow, dirty job.
Imagine the doughboys inching
their way forward in the gullies at
the bottoms of the mountains, dig
ging foxholes in the almost solid rock
to get under cover from the ex
tremely accurate enemy artillery and
mortar fire.
Dead Man
On one occasion I crossed a ridge
on foot, going to an advance com
mand post on a mine field recon
naissance. Lying there on the top
was a man dead with a gaping hole
where his stomach had been.
I later found out that a few min
utes before I came along this man
had been walking over the ridge I
did. The Germans felt a little play
ful, so they shot an 88 mm. cannon
at him. This gun is usually used to
penetrate the armor plate of tanks.
