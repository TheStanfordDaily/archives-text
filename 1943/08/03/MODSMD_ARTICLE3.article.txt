(Acme Radio-Telephoto)
The first picture to reach the United States showing how Italians took news of Mussolini's fall, this radio
photo shows a crowd in Milan cheering Italian troops driving through the city. Latest reports are that Ital
ian soldiers have revolted in Milan and refused to obey orders to fire on throngs crowding streets shouting
peace demands. The picture was radioed from Bern, Switzerland, to London to New York.
