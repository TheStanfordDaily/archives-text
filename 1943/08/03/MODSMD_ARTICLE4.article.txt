### 
Mrs. Guy Stevens Farrington of San Francisco will read the comedy,
"The Damask Cheek" at 8 p.m. today in the Memorial Auditorium as a
feature of the Tuesday Evening Series.
This is the third time Mrs. Farrington has appeared on the Tuesday Eve
ning Series. The other times she read "The Barrets of Wimpole Street" and

â™¦"'Life with Father," both stories of
| family life which are similar to the
I "Damask Cheek."
j English Gill
Written by John van Druten and
Lloyd Morris, the story of "The
Damask Cheek," is that of an English
girl visiting a well-to-do New York
family.
Mr. Coleman of the Daily Mirror
claims that "The Damask Cheek" is
gay, giddy, romantic, and civilized;
it is recommended to all who want
to laugh. Tlie play ran on Broadway
I last year from October to April.
Creative Ability
Mrs. Farrington's ability to create
1 living people on a bare stage without
| benefit of stage-sets, scenery, or cos
j tumes gives her audience the illusion
I of having witnessed a stage perform
| ance. In fact, it has been stated by
persons who have both listened to
Mrs. Farrington's readings and seen
| the stage productions of the same
! plays that her presentations are so
vivid and lively that the actual pro-
I ductions are much less impressive,
i Howard Barnes of the Herald
] Tribune said in review, "The play
I avoids all the challenging and ter
| rible issues of the moment. It still
succeeds in being an extremely
| pleasant entertainment.
