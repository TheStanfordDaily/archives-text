# No Sabe, Senior!

### 
Some hundred persons were left
in suspense last Sunday night!
There was no end to the Spanish
movie!
And properly repentant are
members of Sigma Delta Pi, Span
ish honorary society. They have
apologized to all and sundry be
cause there was no conclusion to
the movie they sponsored Sunday
evening. Although Dr. Juan Rael
came to the rescue and supplied the
ending to the story, the society will
show satisfactory (it hopes) films
next Sunday evening. Aug. 15.
There will be no admission.
