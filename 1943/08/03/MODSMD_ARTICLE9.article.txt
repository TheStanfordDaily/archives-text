# Quartet Receives Farewell Ovation
## 
### Adolph Gugel 
Last Friday night marked the close
of the series of concerts by the Lon
| don String Quartet, given under the
auspices of the Elizabeth Sprague
j Coolidge Foundation of the Library
j of Congress.
The Szostakowicz Quartet in C
major, which opened the concert, re
; ceived a larger ovation than any
other quartet given during the series.
Especially well played was the
1 catchy Allegro Molto of the work
which requires the performers to
play with their instruments muted.
The high point of the program was
an excellent rendition of Beethoven's
Quartet in B fiat major, Opus 130.
Their performance of the lyrical
Cavatina was probably the finest
performance of the whole, senes.
The conceit closed with Mozart's
Quartet in D major (K. 375).
