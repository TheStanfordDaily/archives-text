# Daily Biz Staff Adopts Kitten
## 
### Irma Cunha 
Late at night about three weeks
ago Manager Kay Hammond and the
Daily business staff were hard at
work in the Dippy Shack trying to
figure out the financial end of the
paper. But they went home because
no one could concentrate —there was
\ terrific, consistent howling' coming
t'rom somewhere out in the darkness.
The next day, Manager Kay Ham
mond went back to the Shack at noon
to try again, but the howling was
still going on; she decided the howler
was in need of something or other,
and after tracing the noise to a gar
age in the Corporation Yard, she got
the key, unlocked the door, and went
in.
Over in a far corner, spitting, claw
ing, and being brave despite the hair
raised on his back, was "Dippy"—
all five inches of him—letting her
know that he'd fight to the death,
He fought, but soon decided that
sucking warm milk out of an eye
dropper wasn't such a bad idea.
The next few days of "Dippy's..
life were precarious. But he sur
vived, and when it was felt that he
could stand the loud, unsympathetic
atmosphere of the Shack, "Dippy,"
sandbox and all, moved to the office
from "Shangri-La."
And now, a couple of inches long
er, his belly rounded out from the
many bottles of milk given him by
Daily staff members, "Dippy" prides
himself on being the official mascot
of The Stanford Daily.
