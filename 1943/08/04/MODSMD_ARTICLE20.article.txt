# Stanford Army Instructor Tells of Situation in Germany
## 
### 
Born in Germany and raised by German foster-parents, John Brown
Mason, assistant professor in the European Area and Language School, is
an authority on Germany.
"No German could afford to say he was anti-Nazi when I was in Germany
in 1936," asserted Mr. Mason. "Many Germans complied to the 'Heil Hitler,'

but they did not enjoy Nazism."
Mr. Mason studied the German
School system the last time he was in
Germany. He found the greatest dif- I
ference under the Nazi regime was |
j the stifling of individualism. Stu
dents, he said, are told the facts
which the government wants them to 1
i know, and they are given the con- j
elusions which they are to draw from
these facts.
Asked which people will be the
j hardest to convert to a decent demo- j
cratic system, Mr. Mason declared, i
"The men and women who were from
! 14 to 16 years old when Hitler gained
: power tend to be fanatical because
they have spent the last 10 years un
der intense Nazi indoctrination. They
I remember no good from the pre-Hit
ler days."
Although these men would be the j
| ones whose ranks would be the j
heaviest hit in war, Mr. Mason con
j tinued, the problem of x - e-educating
them will be one of the greatest tasks I
we have to.face. The people who still
i remember the political and personal i
: freedom which they once enjoyed \
will be more likely to conform to a
democratic way of life.
Such outrages as the anti-Jewish
j movement and the concentration J
camps cannot be blamed on the Ger
j mans as a whole but rather on the j
! Nazi leaders, he said. However, the
Germans in general have not shown '
very much courage in opposing any
thing the Nazis have done except in
j the field of religion.
''It is much easier to get Germans
| to fight than Americans," Mr. Mason
admitted. "The war against Poland
was very popular with the masses.
The Germans were bitter over the
Polish Corridor."
Mr. Mason did not think, however,
that the people were prepared to take
on the war against England and
| France, and they were distressed j
when the United States entered in
;1941,
"The Germans do not yet know
! they are beaten," Mr. Mason eon
| eluded. "They are still strong from
j a military standpoint. They are also 1
j afraid of a second defeat, and that j
! will make our victory doubly hard." '
