### BILL STRUTHERS 
When I graduate from college I'm going to write my Dad a
letter.
Thanks, Dad, old man, I'm going to say, for the four years of
college. Then I'm going on to say that I think college is a great
place in which to grow up. The atmosphere is nice and there is
a good balance of work and play that keeps you out of trouble
hat you might get into if you're palling around with taxi drivers
or taxi dancers.
Whether or not I learned anything doesn't particularly bother
me, but Dad will feel better if he thinks that I came out with a lot
of knowledge. So I will carefully explain that I have systemati
:ally filed my notes and not sold any of my textbooks, in spite
of the sgueeze at the end of each quarter.
Dad is the kind of guy that likes to think that he never makes
d poor investment. Well, my college education has been rather
expensive and if it could be called 'a' poor investment," I know
it's my fault. But just the same I wish I could remember the name
}112 that 100 shares of preferred stock that went bad back in 1935.
I think I lack a sort of perspective that I'll probably get after
i few years of war or just 10 years of getting older. Right now,
( can't see that college has been anything but a leisurely way of
.becoming an adult. But with me, it will be four years this Sep
tember, and I still don't feel very old. Old enough to settle down
' ; or graduate work, anyway.
Maybe I missed the boat. Maybe I v/as drowsing when the
professor gave away the secret. Or maybe I have a lot more of
hell-raising in me that didn't quite come out in high school or
college.
These four years have taught me a few things, though. I've
found out that I'm not going to be President of the United States.
I've found out that by a reasonable amount of work I can get a
"C" average. I've looked at my home-town in a different light.
First as a place to get away from. And later as a place to get back
to â€”if I can't find anything else.
The old grads tell you that it's the people that you meet in
college that make it worthwhile to you. Maybe so, but I'm not
looking for a job right now. I don't plan on seeing much of the
:friends I now have after I leave Stanford. Instead, I'll probably
see someone I occasionally spoke to on Quad after a couple of
years in the Navy, and we'll be old buddies in spite of the fact
that we never knew each other's names. I might meet a few mem
bers of the class of '43 at an alumni meeting back in Pittsburgh in
1950. I'll end up getting sentimental about the old school with a
guy who graduated 10 years before me, and happened to take a
course from a professor that is still lecturing from the same set
of notes.
But why get sentimental about leaving college now? I've still
got to grow up some more. And this time I'll do it in the Navy.
