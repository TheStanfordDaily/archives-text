To The Editor:
The six-week delay between the close of this quarter and the
awarding of degrees is unnecessary and unreasonable. For some
of those graduating the delay will cause much trouble and red
tape. Since the Navy wants its information promptly, it will be
necessary for me to get letters from both my major department
and the registrar, saying that in October I SHOULD be awarded a
degree, all this AFTER having fulfilled the requirements for
graduation.
Possibly the members of the academic council feel that they
are entitled to their full vacation, and to blazes with the graduat
ing seniors. Nevertheless, after having attended Stanford for 11
quarters during which the watchword has been "Speed! Speed!
Speed!" I see no apparent reason why members of the academic
council should not remain here for a week and award the degrees
as promptly as possible. Herbert F. Bowerman.
