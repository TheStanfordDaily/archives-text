So much for the general conditions
at El Guettar. The main job of the
engineer company to which I was j
attached was clearing mine fields and
repairing roads from enemy bomb
ings. For about the first week I was
there at El Guettar, enemy air acti
vity was pretty dam heavy. They
would bother us all day and keep us
awake most of the night. They would
drop small demolition bombs, and
strafe in the daytime, and at night
they would come over, drop para
chute flares and drop personnel or
demolition bombs at will. These per
sonnel bombs were of several varie
ties, but most of them were "butter
fly" bombs. They would repeat the
bombing, sometimes two or three
times at night. It was very nerve
wracking, especially when you could
hear the bomb fragments whine over
your head. We were also kept busy
blowing up German unexploded or
"dud" bombs.
Toward the end of this action we
went in as infantry, this battalion to
which I was attached. We moved in
to the low hills at the end of the
valley east of El Guettar to guard
against an impending German Panzer
attack. A day later we moved up at
night to replace one of the infantry
battalions. This is the very front
line, and we moved up under the
heaviest barrage Jerry had ever laid
down in this sector. The next morn
ing our artillery laid down a tre
mendous barrage on the Germans,
but they weren't there. They had
changed their minds and run in the
early morning. Since the way was
then clear for the armored forces,
they rolled on and made the much
awaited juncture with the Eighth
Army on the road to Gabes. This was
the end of the action in this sector.
The next day after, the outfit moved
back to rest for a couple of days be
fore going up north. I went into the
hospital to get the infection in my
finger cleared up.
I caught up with the outfit again
just before the big Second Corps
push toward Mateur started. The
Ninth Division had just moved into
position in the hill mass east of Sed
jenane. When I say hill mass, I mean
everything was hills and mountains.
All the country up north there near
the sea was green. The mountains
were rocky and covered with cork
forests. There had been a lot of
fighting in this territory. On the
roadsides around Sedjenane were
many British and German graves.
These graves, as always, were
marked with a cross or a helmet.
This had been the battlefield of the
British First Army. The stench of
death was everywhere, just as it had
been in the hills and gullies around
the minefields at El Guettar. I wish I

j could describe this odor. Smelling
this once is enough to make anyone
hate war.

sonnel bombs were of several varie
ties, but most of them were "butter
fly" bombs. They would repeat the
bombing, sometimes two or three
times at night. It was very nerve
wracking, especially when you could
hear the bomb fragments whine over
your head. We were also kept busy
blowing up German unexploded or
"dud" bombs.
Toward the end of this action we
went in as infantry, this battalion to
which I was attached. We moved in
to the low hills at the end of the
valley east of El Guettar to guard
against an impending German Panzer
attack. A day later we moved up at
night to replace one of the infantry
battalions. This is the very front
line, and we moved up under the
heaviest barrage Jerry had ever laid
down in this sector. The next morn
ing our artillery laid down a tre
mendous barrage on the Germans,
but they weren't there. They had
changed their minds and run in the
early morning. Since the way was
then clear for the armored forces,
they rolled on and made the much
awaited juncture with the Eighth
Army on the road to Gabes. This was
the end of the action in this sector.
The next day after, the outfit moved
back to rest for a couple of days be
fore going up north. I went into the
hospital to get the infection in my
finger cleared up.
I caught up with the outfit again
just before the big Second Corps
push toward Mateur started. The
Ninth Division had just moved into
position in the hill mass east of Sed
jenane. When I say hill mass, I mean
everything was hills and mountains.
All the country up north there near
the sea was green. The mountains
were rocky and covered with cork
forests. There had been a lot of
fighting in this territory. On the
roadsides around Sedjenane were
many British and German graves.
These graves, as always, were
marked with a cross or a helmet.
This had been the battlefield of the
British First Army. The stench of
death was everywhere, just as it had
been in the hills and gullies around
the minefields at El Guettar. I wish I

j could describe this odor. Smelling
this once is enough to make anyone
hate war.
(The third installment of the letter
will be published tomorrow.)
So much for the general conditions
at El Guettar. The main job of the
engineer company to which I was j
attached was clearing mine fields and
repairing roads from enemy bomb
ings. For about the first week I was
there at El Guettar, enemy air acti
vity was pretty dam heavy. They
would bother us all day and keep us
awake most of the night. They would
drop small demolition bombs, and
strafe in the daytime, and at night
they would come over, drop para
chute flares and drop personnel or
demolition bombs at will. These per
sonnel bombs were of several varie
ties, but most of them were "butter
fly" bombs. They would repeat the
bombing, sometimes two or three
times at night. It was very nerve
