# Players To Give Noel Coward's One-Act Series
## 
### 
: Twenty-two different people will
! take part in the Stanford Players
production of three of Noel Coward's
! "Tonight at 8:30" plays in the Me
j morial Hall Aug. 11 through 14.
The Stanford Players have chosen
I three of these plays best suited for
! "center-staging," "Ways and Means,"
; "Hands Across the Sea," and "Fam
! ily Album." The first two plays are
j comedies. "Family Album" includes
j a number of songs and dances in the
Victorian manner.
Original One-Acts
Originally written as a series of
nine one-act plays, the "Tonight at
8:30" sequence represents an attempt
to revive the short play as theater
j fare.
These plays were not accumulated
odds and ends of creative work, ac
; cording to Mr. Coward, but were
j written especially for himself, Ger-
I trude Lawrence, and a small sup
porting company to act in. Three of
the plays were performed each night
for three nights, and the process re
peated.
Three of the nine plays were seri
ous, three were comedies, and three
were musicals. One of each type
was given each evening.
Since the original production-, "the
plays have been particularly popu
-1 lar in the summer theaters, accord
ing to John Sollers, director of the
players production, where Coward's
smart, brittle comedy dialogue is
considered good hot weather enter
! tainment.
Play Without Scenery
Furniture for the play, to be per
formed without scenery, is placed in
the actingarea exactly as it would be
in a room, and the actors play a$
though the four walls of the room
were still there, according to Director
Sollers.
"The audience will sit on raised
; seats surrounding the acting area,
and the actors will enter and exit
through the audience. No curtain
will be used as the lights will be
blacked out to indicate the end of a
play." said Sollers.
The plays will be presented on the
I large main stage of Memorial Hall.
! The front curtain will be drawn, and
the flies, flats, and stage rigging will
i furnish a back-stage atmosphere.
The audience will be limited to 200
each night and will be admitted by
the west side door, through the
; "Green Room."
