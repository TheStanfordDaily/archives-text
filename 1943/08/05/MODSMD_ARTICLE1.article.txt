# John Charles Thomas Gives Concert Tonight
## 
### Beverly French 
' Tonight at 8:15 when John Charles Thomas makes his appearance before
Stanford audiences we hope to see students and faculty en masse in Me
morial Hall," states Louise Thille, Concert Series manager.
Upon the success of tonight's recital depends the future of the series. If
students do not manifest an interest in the concerts, the series will have to
be discontinued.
Commenting on his programs for the current season, Mr. Thomas said,
"Well, I'm going to attempt to glorify the music teacher, the song-writer
and the poet in these concerts. Too little attention has been given them."
When he last appeared before Stanford students, Mr. Thomas was
awarded much acclaim as an artist who sought to please the musical tastes
of all his listeners. Tonight's program is designed to appeal to both those
who are musicians themselves and those who know little music.
After his appearance here, Mr, Thomas will continue to make tours of
the army camps, where he has won many admirers. Before the war, the
artist spent about one-half of each year touring America giving recitals.
Now, however, much of his time is devoted to entertaining the service men.
One of the artist's main diversions is boating. His hobby has been
abandoned for the duration, however, because he donated his boat to the
United States Government for national defense.
The program for tonight consists of settings from the texts of Shakespeare.

"If Music Be the Food of Love, Play On" from Twelfth Night (John.
Charles Clifton), '"Where the Bee Sucks" from The Tempest (Thomas Ame),
"When That I Was a Tiny Boy" from Twelfth Night (Joseph Vernon), "It;
Was a Lover and His Lass) from As You Like It (Roger Quilter), and
"Sigh No More, Ladies" from Much Ado About Nothing (Sir Arthur Sul
livan.
The second feature will be piano solos by Carroll Hollister, Mr. Thomas'
accompanist, who will play "Tambourin" by Rameau-Godowsky, '"The
Submerged Cathedral" by Debussy, and "Taccato" by Khatchatourian.
Mr. Thomas will next present a monologue "Nemico Delia Patrio" from.
"Andrea Chenier" by Giordano.
After intermission, the baritone will sing a group of Irish and Scotch folk
songs, "The Minstrel Boy," arranged by William Fisher, "Ye Banks and
Braes," arranged by Ainsley Murray, "Ballynure Ballad" arranged by
Herbert Hughes, "Lord Randel" arranged by Cyril Scott, and"The Ringers"
by Hermann Lohr.
The fifth group includes "Roll Along Home" by Easthope Martin, "Down
by the Salley Gardens" by Alice de Cevee, "The Greatest Man" by Charles
Ives, "Fulfillment" by Sydney King Russell, "He's Got the Whole World
in His Hands" from the collection of Marion Kerby, arranged by Hamilton
Forrst, and "Blow Me Eyes" by Albert Hay Malotte.
The box office will be open tonight at 7:15 in order to accommodate those
who have not purchased their tickets as yet.
