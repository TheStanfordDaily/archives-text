# The 						Stanford DAILY
## MURAL SOFTBALL Gerona, Boathouse Hoys Meet Friday for Title 
### Don Langendorf 
Friday is the big day in the Presi
dent's League for that is the time of
the long awaited meeting between
the Boathouse Boys and Gerona A.C.
for the intramural Softball champion
ship. That game will decide not only
the winning of the league but will
serve also to eliminate the losing
team for the playoffs. The winner
will probably take the playoffs.
Gerona Wins Again
Gerona advanced another step to
wards the finals by winning the first
game of the elimination tournament
over Cleveland Hall, the same team
they defeated last' Monday night. It
was rather convincing as they played
around with Cleveland scoring in all
but one inning and allowing them
only two runs.
Jim Gault was in his usual excel
lent form allowing, only two hits.
Cleveland's Tom Ashley was higher
than a kite as he allowed 19 (count
them) runs on only 14 hits. The game
ended in a semi-blackout with Ge
rona giving Cleveland six outs in
the final inning in order to speed up
the game.
Boathouse Advances
Scoring an impressive victory
against Fillmore in their round to
night. the Boathouse Boys advanced
towards their game with Gerona
Friday night with only one black
mark against them, and that a defeat
registered by the very same Gerona.
With that in mind, they will be try
ing harder than ever for a victory.
Smoke Morrison and Chuck McCoy
shared the slab duties for the Boys
with Smoke receiving the victory.
Fillmore threatened only once and
then too late for it was the final
stanza and fell short by eight runs.
Wayne Price was charged with the
loss.
Firehouse Takes Lincoln
In a comedy of errors, nine tallied
in all, the Firehouse trounced Lin
coln Hall by 11 to 5. By winning, the
Firehouse virtually went into the
finals as only Monroe stands between
them and the game between them
and the winner of Gerona vs. Boat
house.
Although errors figured a lot, the
Firehouse was really slugging the
ball as both shortstop Darwin Dor

seely and pitcher Olie Baer hit re
sounding home runs.
Hayes Drops Close One
Hayes ' lost a heart-breaker lasl
night to McKinley Hall in the best
played game of the evening. Going
into the sixth leading 3 to 2. Mc-
Kinley loaded the bags with two
away. With the count of three and
two on the batter, he hit a scratch
single over first driving in two runs
to take the game. Bob Barber took
the win with Ted Noble being
charged with the loss.

the winning of the league but will

team for the playoffs. The winner
will probably take the playoffs.
Gerona Wins Again
Gerona advanced another step to
wards the finals by winning the first
game of the elimination tournament
over Cleveland Hall, the same team
they defeated last' Monday night. It
was rather convincing as they played
around with Cleveland scoring in all
but one inning and allowing them
only two runs.
Jim Gault was in his usual excel
lent form allowing, only two hits.
Cleveland's Tom Ashley was higher
than a kite as he allowed 19 (count
them) runs on only 14 hits. The game
ended in a semi-blackout with Ge
rona giving Cleveland six outs in
the final inning in order to speed up
the game.
Boathouse Advances
Scoring an impressive victory
against Fillmore in their round to
night. the Boathouse Boys advanced
towards their game with Gerona
Friday night with only one black
mark against them, and that a defeat
registered by the very same Gerona.
With that in mind, they will be try
ing harder than ever for a victory.
Smoke Morrison and Chuck McCoy
shared the slab duties for the Boys
with Smoke receiving the victory.
Fillmore threatened only once and
then too late for it was the final
stanza and fell short by eight runs.
Wayne Price was charged with the
loss.
Firehouse Takes Lincoln
In a comedy of errors, nine tallied
in all, the Firehouse trounced Lin
coln Hall by 11 to 5. By winning, the
Firehouse virtually went into the
finals as only Monroe stands between
them and the game between them
and the winner of Gerona vs. Boat
house.
Although errors figured a lot, the
Firehouse was really slugging the
ball as both shortstop Darwin Dor

seely and pitcher Olie Baer hit re
sounding home runs.
Hayes Drops Close One
Hayes ' lost a heart-breaker lasl
night to McKinley Hall in the best
played game of the evening. Going
into the sixth leading 3 to 2. Mc-
Kinley loaded the bags with two
away. With the count of three and
two on the batter, he hit a scratch
single over first driving in two runs
to take the game. Bob Barber took
the win with Ted Noble being
charged with the loss.
