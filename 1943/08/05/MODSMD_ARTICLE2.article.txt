### Irma Cunha 
A round-up of labor shortage news by the Stanford Daily of organiza
tions in Palo Alto and Stanford needing student help to overcome critical
periods shows that at present the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. is most in
need of student aid. And according to Mr. W. H. Moulthrop, labor depart
ment supervisor, there is no limit to the number the company can use. Last

weekend. 27 Stanford men worked in
the Southern Pacific Bayshore yards.
"We could have used 127" said Mr.
i Moulthrop. "But we certainly Jtp
preciate the help rendered by the
Stanford men."
Dining Halls
i Mrs. Erna Lehan, director of La
gunita dining halls, spoke for Miss
Christine Ricker, campus dining hall
director, in saying that at present
there is no need for student workers
in University dining halls.
"The problem of the moment is
laundry," said Mrs. Lehan. "The
University itself has no laundry fa
cilities, and the agencies that pre
viously have done table linen and
kitchen workers' and hashers' uni
forms can give us only partial laun
dry service."
There is a possibility that students
may be asked to help during Fall
Quarter by volunteering to iron
kitchen uniforms after they have
been washed and starched by the
laundries. Mrs. Lehan also urged
any students wishing to sign up for
hasher or kitchen work during Fall
Quarter to contact Miss Ricker at
the Union office or to get in touch
| with any of the directors of the vari
ous dining units.

until mid-September. However, it's
hard to say just when the peak of
the season will come."
A round-up of labor shortage news by the Stanford Daily of organiza
tions in Palo Alto and Stanford needing student help to overcome critical
periods shows that at present the Southern Pacific Railroad Co. is most in
need of student aid. And according to Mr. W. H. Moulthrop, labor depart
ment supervisor, there is no limit to the number the company can use. Last

weekend. 27 Stanford men worked in
the Southern Pacific Bayshore yards.
"We could have used 127" said Mr.
i Moulthrop. "But we certainly Jtp
preciate the help rendered by the
Stanford men."
Dining Halls
i Mrs. Erna Lehan, director of La
gunita dining halls, spoke for Miss
Christine Ricker, campus dining hall
director, in saying that at present
there is no need for student workers
in University dining halls.
"The problem of the moment is
laundry," said Mrs. Lehan. "The
University itself has no laundry fa
cilities, and the agencies that pre
viously have done table linen and
kitchen workers' and hashers' uni
forms can give us only partial laun
dry service."
There is a possibility that students
may be asked to help during Fall
Quarter by volunteering to iron
kitchen uniforms after they have
been washed and starched by the
laundries. Mrs. Lehan also urged
any students wishing to sign up for
hasher or kitchen work during Fall
Quarter to contact Miss Ricker at
the Union office or to get in touch
| with any of the directors of the vari
ous dining units.
