# Smoke Brings Fire
## 
### 
NEED all Farm traditions be shattered?
We saw the "no socks on Quad" and "no women on law
steps" fall victim to the war; we lamented their passing in the
parade of traditions.
Today we see the "no smoking on Quad" tradition violated at
every corner and turn of the arched walks. For 50 years Stanford
men and women have respected the wishes of Mrs. Stanford that
students do not smoke on the inner Quadrangles and on the
//alks under the arches.
For those students who cannot respect 50 years of established
tradition, for those who have no regard for the wishes of the
ounder of the University, we offer these practical reasons for
lot smoking on the Quad and in the classrooms:
The tradition has enabled Stanford to obtain lower fire in
surance rates; lower fire insurance rates in the long run means
lower tuition fees for students.
In many of the buildings, especially the psychology building,
n valuable records are housed. Fire would completely destroy
v hese records and with them would go the work of many men
">ver a long period of years.
Smoke brings discomfort to some persons and makes others
11—when you are trying to fill a blue book, your head must be
■rlear and you must feel your best.
It doesn't take much effort to walk out of the room or to step
jff the Quad to smoke; we do not need to lose this tradition, its
continuance depends upon the cooperation of the student body.
