### BILL STRUTHERS 
Today I have something to tell you. You see I am chairman
if the Publicity Committee of Leland Stanford Junior University's
Pant & Garter Club. And in my official position I shall tell you
ibout the club.
Some rather prominent campus characters who hash at La
gunita got to thinking after watching Tuesday's tappings by Cap
and Gown. Why, they asked themselves, don't the men have a
similar honor society? Many big men on campus deserve more
recognition than having somebody accidentally run across their
-lame and in the bawlout and wonder if it's true. Thus the Pant
& Garter Club has been formed to fill this need.
At an informal business meeting in the dishroom of the La
gunita kitchen, the charter members decided to outdo the Cap
and Gown Society in every possible way. Specific proof of this
is our motto: "Onward, upward, and outward!"
A B average is a nice thing to have, but some just don't have
it. Therefore we need a new criterion. A pair of worn down
saddle shoes, someone suggested. One hundred hours flying
time down the highway was another. I suggested a jump from
r he high tower into the men's pool, which would automatically
'nclude Mr. Sprague's last quarter pre-Ensign class. A jump
from the same tower into the women's pool, someone else said.
So I don't think they took me seriously.
We also started an auxiliary, which Cap and Gown doesn't
have. Bev Duncan is the president. Her inaugural speech was a
complete success.
"I think you boys are nice," she said, and that is what we
wanted to hear.
At present we're trying to get Mrs. McKenzie, receptionist in
the Dean of Men's office, to be one of our senior members. Most
of us see more of her than we do of the dean. Besides, if she
would sponsor us, we could consider it a semi-official approval
of the administration.
At this first real meeting, the acting dean of women is to
lecture on the latest murder mystery. She is also going to read
the last chapter of The Thirty-Nine Steps, which is her favorite.
So let me publicly announce, that if you are at all deserving
of membership in the Pant <S Garter Club keep on the straight
and narrow.
Cap and Gown has done their tapping.
We have yet to do our snapping.
