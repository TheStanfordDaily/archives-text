# Lt.Springmeyer Describes Raids On Sedjenane

(Editor's Note: This is the third of
four installments of a letter to be
published in the Stanford Daily this
week. The letter is from a Stanford
alumnus, Lt. Robert L. Springmeyer, !
who wrote this account of the battle
front and fighting conditions in Tu
nisia to his wife.)

Part 111
The village of Sedjenane, as the
other villages irt the vicinity, was an
empty hollow ruin. The roadsides
were pockmarked with bomb craters
sometimes 20 or 30 feet across and 10
or 12 feet deep. Ruined trucks and
tanks were scattered about here as
they had been at El Guettar. The
charred, twisted masses of metal
were grim reminders that someone
had died there.
When I arrived at the company all
was quiet except for the occasional
bark and rumble of the usual artil
lery duel. Enemy air activity here
was nothing to what it had been at El
Guettar. Nothing to say that first
night when I arrived at Ninth Di
vision headquarters and was await
ing further orders. The bombers
came over four times inside of an
hour. It was just getting dark. For
the first couple of raids I dove for a
foxhole. I was a little surprised when
a colonel jumped in this one foxhole
on top of me. How did I know it was
his hole? For the last raid I stood
and watched and it was a beautiful
sight. The streams of tracer bullets
from our guns lit up the sky like a
Fourth of July celebration. I saw
one German bomber very clearly
through an opening in the palm
trees. It was a big four-motored
bomber and was swinging close in
very low toward us. It dropped two
bombs very close and threw dirt our
way. I kept watching and saw the
tailgunner in the plane frantically
shooting back as our 50 caliber ma
chine guns found their mark. That
plane jetsoned its bombload and
crashed about two miles away. Then
there was the time at El Guettar
when I saw three Spitfires sneak
through the German fighters, play
hide and seek in the clouds and final
ly go down in flames with another
•German four-motored bomber. That
was a beautiful sight. The Germans
didn't have enough planes left to
trouble us at all up at Sedjenane.
Well, to get back to the story. My
first morning up there with the com
pany, Jerry started shelling a mosque
about 400 yards to our left. I found
that he did that every morning to
get his range for the day's shooting.
One over, one short, and then, wham!
One l ight in, and he was ready to
start throwing those artillery shells
at any target. Later that morning
that one gun made me take cover
under a little concrete bridge to get
out of the fire. While I was about
10 teet away, one shell landed and
blew one side of the concrete bridge
railing off. I must give the Germans
credit, they know how to use their
artillery. Of course, our artillery is
plenty good. As testimony. I can
remember one hill east of Sedjenane
on which we saw about 200 Germans
who had been killed by our artillerv.

Many of them were killed by our
artillery. Many of them were still in
their holes with blankets over them. ,
killed instantly in their sleep.
(The final installment of the letter
will be published tomorrow.)

There are spots in the Florida
Everglades where one can jiggle uy
and down and the surface of the
muck will quiver in wave sfor dozens
of feet around.

artillery. Many of them were still in

killed instantly in their sleep.

Part 111
The village of Sedjenane, as the
other villages irt the vicinity, was an
empty hollow ruin. The roadsides
were pockmarked with bomb craters
sometimes 20 or 30 feet across and 10
or 12 feet deep. Ruined trucks and
tanks were scattered about here as
they had been at El Guettar. The
charred, twisted masses of metal
were grim reminders that someone
had died there.
When I arrived at the company all
was quiet except for the occasional
bark and rumble of the usual artil
lery duel. Enemy air activity here
was nothing to what it had been at El
Guettar. Nothing to say that first
night when I arrived at Ninth Di
vision headquarters and was await
ing further orders. The bombers
came over four times inside of an
hour. It was just getting dark. For
the first couple of raids I dove for a
foxhole. I was a little surprised when
a colonel jumped in this one foxhole
on top of me. How did I know it was
his hole? For the last raid I stood
and watched and it was a beautiful
sight. The streams of tracer bullets
from our guns lit up the sky like a
Fourth of July celebration. I saw
one German bomber very clearly
through an opening in the palm
trees. It was a big four-motored
bomber and was swinging close in
very low toward us. It dropped two
bombs very close and threw dirt our
way. I kept watching and saw the
tailgunner in the plane frantically
shooting back as our 50 caliber ma
chine guns found their mark. That
plane jetsoned its bombload and
crashed about two miles away. Then
there was the time at El Guettar
when I saw three Spitfires sneak
through the German fighters, play
hide and seek in the clouds and final
ly go down in flames with another
•German four-motored bomber. That
was a beautiful sight. The Germans
didn't have enough planes left to
trouble us at all up at Sedjenane.
Well, to get back to the story. My
first morning up there with the com
pany, Jerry started shelling a mosque
about 400 yards to our left. I found
that he did that every morning to
get his range for the day's shooting.
One over, one short, and then, wham!
One l ight in, and he was ready to
start throwing those artillery shells
at any target. Later that morning
that one gun made me take cover
under a little concrete bridge to get
out of the fire. While I was about
10 teet away, one shell landed and
blew one side of the concrete bridge
railing off. I must give the Germans
credit, they know how to use their
artillery. Of course, our artillery is
plenty good. As testimony. I can
remember one hill east of Sedjenane
on which we saw about 200 Germans
