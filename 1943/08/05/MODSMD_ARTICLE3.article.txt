# Tillson Schedules Historical Drama
## 
### 
Back again after a few weeks'
absence will be the Tillson Talkies
this Sunday evening, Aug. 8, at the
Memorial Theater. Featured on this
Sunday's program will be the film,
'"Nine Days a Queen," starring Sir
Cedric Hardwick and Nova Pilbeam.
The picture, made a couple of
years ago, is the historical drama of
Lady Jane Grey of Tudor times with
Miss Pilbeam playing the lead. Hard
wick gives an excellent portrayal of
king Henry the Eighth.
Accompanying the picture will be
the 13th chapter of the Clutching
Hand, a melodramatic mystery, and
also another short starring Clark
Gable and his course at officer's
training school.
As usual, the opening time is 7:30
and admission 20 cents.
Sunday's presentation will be the
third this quarter. The first two pic
tures shown were "Algiers" and
'"Knight Without Armor."
