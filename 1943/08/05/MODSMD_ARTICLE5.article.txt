go Hawaiian at the Roble-Lagunita
Beach Ball to be held at the Women's
Gym next Saturday night. The
theme of the Hawaiian Welakahao
will be carried out in the decorations
which will suggest a tropical beach
sceneâ€”a blue sea and sky mural
with silhouettes of people surfboard
ing, canoeing, or just loafing on the
beach. Of course there will be palm
trees, a canvas awning, beach furni
ture, even a moon to make the set
ting complete.

planned and carried out by the Roble
and Lagunita decoration committees
headed by Lola Jungbiut and Lora
