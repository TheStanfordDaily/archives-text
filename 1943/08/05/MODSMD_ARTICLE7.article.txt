# German Radio Announces Nazi Evacuation of Orel
## 
### 
LONDON, Thursday, Aug. 5â€”A
German broadcast announced the
evacuation of Orel today after the
Russians had broken into the ruined
city and started driving the desper
ately resisting enemy rear guard
through its streets in hand to hand
fighting.
A German official DNB agency
bulletin recorded here shortly before
1:30 a.m. admitted the first great
summer triumph of the Red Army
in the capture of the city and anchor
point for the entire German front,
which the blitzkrieg of the German
wehrmacht had taken nearly 22
months ago.
The DNB announcement meant
that the shattered garrison was flee
ing for its life to escape a Red Army
death trap. Smashing the German
rear guard fighting to save the main
enemy body of 250,000 men, the Red
Army broke through at the railroad
which runs north and south of Orel
and poured into the city streets. En
tire units were wiped out as the Rus
sians drove through 80 towns and
villages.
