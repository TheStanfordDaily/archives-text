## 'Bombardier' Scores Hit 
### 
IU)MHARDIER —Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
"Bombardier" is R-K-O's tribute
! to the famous Norden bombsight and
[ the men who use it. It's an effective
recruiting poster that relates the
j story of a group of trainees from
! ground school to enemy combat.
Pat O'Brien, in charge of the
; training center, and Randolph Scott,
| an officer of lesser rank, are contin
-1 ually battling with each other during
the picture on every imaginable sub
ject. Ann Shirley provides the ro
| mantic element and has a large per
| centage of the cast seeking her af
| fections.
The plot is meager, but the action
shots, especially of the staged raid
upon Tokio, are well done and in
! teresting. The picture is excessively
| long, however, and provides only
| passable entertainment.
The second feature, "Street of
Chance, "begins as a psychological
| drama and ends by becoming a mur
i der mystery. .—Bower
