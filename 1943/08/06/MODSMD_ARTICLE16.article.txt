will be Smoke Morrison, while Jim
Gault or Red Holman will handle the
mound chores for Gerona. Both
pitchers are rated among the best in
I the league.

division of the playoffs, the Fire
house clashes with Monroe. Fresh
from their Wednesday night's trounc
ing of Lincoln, the Firehouse looms
as the favorite, but Monroe has been
an in and out team all season, and if
j hot tonight, can spring an upset.

I cuffed the Lincoln batters Wednes
! day will pitch for the Firehouse,
while Johnny Carr will be up for
Monroe.
