# LATE TIPS

### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Gunder Hagg (or Ilaegg) flashed
across the finish tape in 4:05.4 at
Cleveland, and close behind came a
comparatively unknown runner by
the name of Bill Ilulse,
Ilulse had entered the race, but
no one would have bet a plus nickel |
that the guy would be only five yards
behind the Swedish ace at the finish
of the mile run. The second-place
spot bad been conceded to Gil Dodds.
Hulse is a former New York Uni
versity student, having graduated in
1942. and had spent most of his time
chasing his classmate Leslie Mac-
Mitchell around the oval. Nobody
paid much attention to Ilulse in
those days, and he was a virtually
forgotten man until his great race
against Hagg.
Rags to Riches
It reminds us of the dramatic
"Rags to Riches" yarns that Bill ;
Stern used to tell over his weekly
radio program. The typical "Reel
Six—The Story Behind the Story."
There are thousands of incidents i
of a nobody becoming famous over- i
night, but most of them have to take
a back seat to Hulse's feat of becom
ing the unofficial fastest outdoor
American miler in history. Hats off
to Hulse, and we're waiting until he
really gets hot. Maybe he's going to
be the man who will eventually
clock the "impossible" 4:00 mile.
Even the Kitchen Sink
In Ilagg's grand finale at Triboro
Stadium in New York next VVednes- ;
day, it looks like the A.A.U. is
throwing all of their chips into the i
pot in a final desperation effort to
see somebody, not necessarily Hagg. !
but anybody, erase the world mark
of 4:02.(i.
Not only are they having Hagg,
Dodds, and Hulse in the event, but
they have thrown in Don Burnham.
Jim Rafferty, Rudy Simms and Frank
Martin for good measure—just to
make things interesting. The last
four men will be given handicaps, j
while the first three will start from
scratch—naturally.
If sensational things keep happen
ing to the American milers, as it
happened to Ilulse, men, keep your
eyes on Simms and Martin. Just for
kicks.
