# STANFORD PLAYERS
## Three Noel Coward Comedies To Initiate Circus Seating 
### 
Noel Coward's "Tonight at 8:30" playlets are excellent examples of his
comedy writing, according to John F. Sollers of the speech and drama staff,
who will direct the Stanford Players in their production of three of the
plays on the main stage of Memorial Hall Aug. 11 to 14.
The plays, which will be staged circus style, are ''Hands Across the Sea,"
— ♦ "Wavs and Means," and "Family

i Album."
The plot in '"Hands Across the Sea"
j revolves around an extended case of
mistaken identity. Lady Maureen is
j entertaining a family from Malaya
i who put her up when her plane was
I grounded on a round-the-world trip.
Confused Identities
Confusing this family with another
from Penang, Lady Maureen enter
tains them with an assortment of
violent, frivolous friends on the
j theory that "the least you can do
! when people are kind to you in far
' off places is to be a little gracious in
I return."
Half-way along, she discovers that
! they are the wrong family, and her
struggles to ascertain their true iden
tity make up the balance of the play.
Slight Plot
This rather slight plot becomes an
; excellent vehicle for the actress play
ing Lady Maureen, according to Di
rector Sollers. Written for Gertrude
Lawrence, Joyce Henderson, last
j seen as the outspoken mother in
"Do-Re-Mi," will play the part here.
Richard Ogg will portray her hus
band: Laura Jo Shafer and Nicholas
! Vogulkin, the "colonials"; and Jean
Levinson, Norman Philbrick. and
Steve Benedict, the friends who help
| entertain. Others in the cast are Aili
Pentinnen and Dennis Churchill.
Ways and Means
In "Ways and Means" the Cart
wrights, having lost all their money
J at the Casino, are stranded in a villa
>on the Riviera. Their hostess is on
! the point of practically evicting them,
but they don't even have enough to
! tip the servants.
All efforts to raise capital failing,
j they are about to throw themselves
on the' mercy of their hostess and
borrow from her, when the chauffeur
I of a former friend, arriving unex
! pectedly, comes to the rescue.
David Sievers, last seen in "Char
i lie's Aunt," plays the Noel Coward
role, while Nan Tillson takes the
Gertrude Lawrence part. Natalie
J Towle is the "suicidal" hostess. Harry
J Zion, the ex-chauffeur; and Jean
Levinson, Peggy Mayer. Robert Win
slow, and Steve Benedict also appear.
Victorian Comedy
"Family Album," a Victorian com
; edy with music, starts with a typical
| Featherways family reunion follow
ing their father's funeral and pro
ceeds to anything but a funeral con
j conclusion.
