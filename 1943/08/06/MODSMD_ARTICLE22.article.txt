PUBLIC BEACH:
Pick a spot of sand that's clean of human bodies. Spread out
your blanket, rub on your oil. Get things organized. Your dark
glasses high on the bridge of your nose, your cigarettes on your
right, and Collier's open to the third installment of that serial.
Lie there and half read and half keep up a patter of conversation
with your partner.
Let the rest go unnoticed. Forget the man with the large wart
on his back; the women with hair too blonde, too red, or too
black; the bathers with skin too red from the sun, too white from
"he office, or too black, burned, and crisp from hours of life
guarding.
Or tune your mind to the frequency of the public beach.
Watch the adolescent high school kids fight over the jug of cider
and get drunk as though it were sauterne. Feel uncomfortable
and sticky watching the Portuguese family drip watermelon all
over their J. C. Penney swim suits.
Study the legs of the old women. Look at their faces and
see if you can figure out why their legs are so lumpy, so veiny,
so scarred. Catch the flash of wedding rings where you wouldn't
expect to see them for five years. Let someone's boy friend, girl
friend, uncle, aunt, father, mother, sister, brother kick sand in
your face on their way to the water and sprinkle you on their
way back. Wonder why the kid with the head that looks like a
misused shaving brush didn't get a haircut a month ago.
Listen to the portable radio on the other side of the man with
the tattoo â€”the woman with the ill-fitting suit singing to the
anemic youngster whom you can't decide is a boy or a girl.
Let the radio shout, "Praise the Lord and pass the ammuni
tion . . just as the juke box at the corner creamery has done
for the last two weeks.
Let someone's grandmother line up the kids and take their
picture. Let the dribble of conversation through your ears . . .
"Hold still, Johnny, do you want me to waste all my film-"
"Don't throw sand at Bessie." "Do you want some more water
melon?" "Are you going to the skating rink tonight?" "Your
.ice-cream cone is melting."
Let the cover page of the American Weekly blow past you
and watch Daddy lift Junior on his shoulders and trot like a horse,
prance like a horse, neigh like a horse. Let the man in the loose
green trunks shout, 'Whoa . . . giddap . . . whoa!"
And roll over so you can sun your other side.
