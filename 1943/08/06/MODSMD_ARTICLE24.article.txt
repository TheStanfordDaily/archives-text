# Conclusion
## 
### 
Most of the work at Sedjenane at
first was repairing and making roads.
Later most of the # time was spent on
removing German mine fields and
clearing out "booby traps." Thefe
were plenty of both in this sector.
This work is unnerving because the
slightest slip will send you to
"Kingdom Come."
I left the Ninth Division and re
turned to the Third a few days be
fore the breakthrough came, and
they pushed on to Matner. The fight
ing at Sedjenane was bitter and
tough, but when the Germans re
alized that they were defeated, they
pulled out and left just as they had
at El Guettar. The Italians are poor
fighters and usually are happy to
surrender when pressed, but the
Germans are good fighters and go to
the very end. The Germans don't
know that they're losing the war yet,
and their spirit is good, so don't
think that Africa's falling is a signal
for a quick finish. It wish it were:
the Germans aren't halfway beaten
yet.
As you probably already know. I
started to go back to the Third Di
vision by train. As things happened,
after about five days on the train I
met the Third Division going up
where I had just come from. So I
hopped off the train and joined the
company. We then slowly moved up
toward the front, ready to go in the
line whenever we were needed. The
Third Division was in the II Corps
reserve. The end came too soon; we
weren't needed after all.
The fight was still on in the Cape
Bon peninsula when we moved up
just south of Bizerte and started
cleaning up. The hills had to be
combed for enemy guns, ammunition,
etc. All the mine fields and "booby
traps had to be removed; that was
our job. You should have seen the
salvage dumps after a few days"
work. They were piled high with
captured enemy stuff. Prisoners were
still coming in. In fact, two walked
through our camp one night and

went on to headquarters before they
could find anyone to surrender to.
One thing I noticed was that prac
tically all of the German officers
spoke excellent English. I had an
opportunity to get into Bizerte. There

was nothing left of the city. I couldn't
find one building that hadn't been
hit by one of our bombs. From what
I hear Tunis is quite different. Noth
ing in the city is damaged, just th.>
docks, etc. have been hit.
