# Railroad Needs More Workers
## 
### 
To fill the most critical labor need
at present in this locality, Stanford
men are asked to sign for track work
for Southern Pacific tomorrow or
Sunday by W. H. Moulthrop, super
visor of the railroad labor employ
ment office.
Men who wish to do track work
may sign up in the War Board office
in the Old Union or may phone the
nearest Southern Pacific agent. Last
weekend, 24 Stanford men worked
in the Bayshore yards of the com
pany.
For track work, men are to report
by 7:30 a.m. for transportation at the
Palo Alto ticket office. Men will
take the train on the northbound
side of the station for work near San
Francisco.
