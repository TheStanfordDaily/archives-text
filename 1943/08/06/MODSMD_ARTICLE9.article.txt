### Barbara Stevens 
Saturday morning victory garden
ers at the Con Home have been faith
ful and cooperative, according to
Betty May Hale. War Board chief.
Their enthusiasm and industry has
brought up some professional-look
ing beans, yellow corn, unexcelled
potatoes, and luscious deep red to
matoes.
From 15 to 20 Farm women have
oegun the early hours of their Sat
urday mornings during Summer
Quarter planting the vegetables,
wrapping celery, weeding, thinning
â€¢he beets and turnips, and praying
over the watermelon and cucumber
vines.
Each Saturday at 8:45 a.m. a truck
stops by Roble and Lagunita when a
few lone souls are starting out for
,abs. Mostly the co-eds are taking
advantage of the opportunity to sleep
ate. With the appearance of the
truck the victory gardeners come out
and noisily climb into the back end.
Clad in slacks, shorts, jeans, culottes,
bright colored shirts, bandanas, they

, bump and bounce over the road to
! the Con Home.
Sam McDonald, colored friend of
; three generations of Stanford stu
dents, and for 40 years superintend
ent of athletic buildings and grounds.
; takes over from there. He supervises
the vegetables, the sweet potatoes
and peanuts and popcorn rows, bol
; sters the spirits of the workers with
backets of fresh vegetables for imme
! diate consumption and appreciation
iof their efforts. He says,"The girls
j do marvelous work, we couldn't pro
i mote a garden venture without
I them."
; "Ladies More Accurate'
When questioned as to the com
! parative efficiency of women and
men garden helpers, he said, "Ladies
i are more accurate than men."
During the week the employees of
| the Home come out and keep the
garden growing. The produce is
j raised primarily to feed the Con
j valescent Home itself, but the sur
plus is used at Allied Arts which is
j run for the benefit of the Home, and
if any vegetables are still left over at
the height of the season they are
j used at Stanford.
Louise Phillips, Roble, was elected
captain of the garden crew on the
j first Saturday. She works as a sub
supervisor under Sam and keeps the
Roble spirit toward the gardens
j especially cooperative.
Take Pride in Work
Comments from the girls who were
bending busily over a plot of toma
toes or were resting in the shade of
| a large tree testing the quality of the
i tomatoes evinced a special pride in
1 this, "the vegetable of their efforts."
Many of them had worked in gar
i dens at home, and most of them pre
! ferred rowing corn. '"The tomatoes
j mented with professional noncha
| lance.
On Saturday, Aug. 14, at the in
j vitation of Mrs. Atwood the girls
| will be guests of the Convalescent
j Home at a picnic.
