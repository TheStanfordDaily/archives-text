# War Board Plans Fete Friday Night
## 
### 
Stanford students will get in the
spirit of carnival time at the War
Board Victory Carnival from 7:15 to
11:30 p.m. Friday night at the Wom
en's Gym. Admission is a package of
cigarettes for men and a piece of junk
jewelry for women, all of which will
be sent overseas. Carnival proceeds
will go toward the Dimes for Diplo
mas drive.
Besides concessions, which will be
kept going all evening, dancing will
begin at 8:30. Each couple will pre
sent a ticket, and instead of being
given a return stub if they leave,
their hands will be stamped.
Short Program
A short program will be held at 9
p.m. at which Chaplain L. R.
Schmieder, a navy man who has just
returned from the South Pacific, will
tell a few short stories about some
action in Pacific battles.
'"Following that, Rick Supple will
lead the Axe yell—and this one is
directed at the Axis," said Betty May
Hale, War Board coordinator. "The
program will end with the singing of
the Stanford Hymn."
Concessions will be placed around
the arcade in the gym and according
to Miss Hale, booth spaces have been
marked out in chalk. Concessions
chairmen are asked to go to the gym
to see how much space is allowed
their booth.
Concessions
Concessions include:
Tyler Hall, with Ralph Miller in
charge: the idea will be to throw
baseballs at records, with the pieces
going to the scrap drive.
Lagunita (Magnolia, Naranja, Oli
vo) will feature penny throwing with
Jean Hinchman in charge.
Lincoln Hall, Ward Austin in
charge, is keeping their idea a secret.
Roble 1. 2, and 3, with Helen Steale
and Patsy Wogan in charge also have
secret novel ideas, but did let out
something about throwing darts at
Hitler.
Cleveland Hall will put on a
strength contest with Henry Mc-
Cauley in charge.
Lagunita (Eucalypto, Adelfa. Gra
nada) will offer a similar challenge
by having a nail pounding contest
with Eleanor Lamb in charge.
More Concessions
Klahoya will engage in fortune
telling under the direction of Clarice
Brown.
Buchanan Hall, under Jim Mitchell,
will hold a bingo game.
Monroe Hall, headed by Tom
