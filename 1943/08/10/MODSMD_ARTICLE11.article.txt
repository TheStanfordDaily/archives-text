# Stanford Players Plan Unique Productions In r Center-Staged' Noel Coward Playlets
## 
### 
The audience will get to see the !
furniture carried oft" during the in- i
termissions between the Noel Cow- j
aid "Tonight at 8:30" plays to be i
given Aug. 11 through 14 in the Me- j
morial Hall, according to John F. |
Sellers, director.
''The production requires no seen- i
ery, but a different suite of furniture j
is necessary for each play; and as !
the performance is to be ''center- j
staged," the changes will take place ;
in full view of the audience," said i
Mr. Sollers.
The three plays to be given by the j
Stanford Players are "Hands Across j
the Sea." which requires a smart (
London living room setting. '"Ways j
and Means." which uses a bedroom j
in a pre-war Riviera villa as a back- \
ground, and "Family Album" which
takes place in a Victorian parlor. '

1 The "Ways and Means" furniture,
; covered in padded peach and green
sateen with pleated or net skirts, will
; carry out the description given in the
; play. Olive, the owner of the home,
has decorated this house with re
| markable restraint considering her
| inate vulgarity, according to William
I Girvan, set designer.
I
The real technical job. according to
| Director Sollers, is building the seat
ing arrangement on the big stage of
' the Memorial Theater. Huge plat
j forms have been banked on each side
I and chairs placed on them so that
I every spectator will have a clear
' view of the acting area.
"The task is comparable to build
j ing a new auditorium on the stage,"
1 said Mr. Sellers.
The audience for the performances
' will enter the west door of the Me

!mo rial Hall through the '"Green
j Room."
Costumes for the plays will be
modern except those for "Family Al
bum" which are uniformly 1875
I mourning attire. One character,
j Charles, is in uniform but will wear
a mourning band. Bustles and side
i bums will be in evidence.
Stage managers for the production
I are Margaret Coope, Sylvia Hyde,
and Helen Rice. Philomene Trotter
i and Fay Johnson are in charge of
! properties. The lights will be man
aged by Cecilia Bergeda. Anabel An
| derson, and Agnes Howe.
Earl Douglas, Sil Onesti, Mickey
Garms, and Thomas Lee are the
stage crew for the presentation. Mar
j ?aret Morgan, Louise Bacon, Mabel
! Barker. Rosemary Bell. Mary Ellen
! Emmons, Nancy Anne Squires, and
Roberta Suiter will do make-ups.
