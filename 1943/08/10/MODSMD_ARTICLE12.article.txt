# Brandt Holds Optimistic View On U.S. Wartime Fats Supply
## 
### 
Karl Brandt, professor of Agricultural Economics, presents an optimistic
outlook on America's wartime fats supply in comparison with that of other
nations in his new War-Peace Pamphlet, '"Fats and Oils in the War," pub
lished by the Stanford Food Research Institute and Stanford University
Press.
"Even with direct consumer rationing of fats in force, the people in the

■♦•United States are still as well sup
plied as they were during the decade
preceding this war," Professor Brandt
declares.
He expresses the opinion that re
ports of catastrophic fats shortages
have likely been exaggerated, al
though a real crop failure at the pres
ent time would make drastic adjust
ments in consumption of fats inevit
able.
America's present adequate supply
of fats, Professor Brandt explains, is
due largely to raised production goals
for all animal and oilseed fats since
January, 1942. Crops with revised
goals included peanuts, soybeans,
j linseed, and flaxseed.
Causes of Rationing
I The shortages of fats responsible
| for rationing were not caused by lack
of home front production, but in-
I stead by the heavy concentration of
; lend-lease buying and military pur-
I chases.
However, the pamphlet points out
| that definite shortages of fats exist
in Europe, especially the occupied
countries, due to the Allied blockade,
j Japan has wrested the Western
[ world's main sources of imports of
: vegetable fats in Manchuria, Malaya,
! and the Netherlands Indies.
By exploitation of the resources of
occupied countries, Germany has suc
' ceeded in keeping her fats economy
j on an even keel, causing severe
| shortages in France, Belgium, Hol
| land and Italy.
Germany's Situation
As a result of this exploitation and
pre-war preparations, Germany has
j succeeded exceedingly well in con
trolling its wartime fats economy.
Between 1933 and 1939, Germany
carried out an extensive program in
the domestic production of animal
and vegetable fats. However, these
supplies are diminishing, and the
blockade prevents further imports.
"Continental Europe produced 3.3
million tons of animal and vegetable
fats in 1941-42 compared with 3.9
| million tons in pre-war years, owing
to the loss of feed imports," Professor
Brandt states.
Because of this lessening supply of
fats, soap is now made partially or
entirely of brasives and fillers in
, Europe. In France, soap has become
| as scarce as butter.
The fats situation in the remaining
j neutral European countries is far
better than in the occupied countries.

Germany's Situation
As a result of this exploitation and
pre-war preparations, Germany has
j succeeded exceedingly well in con
trolling its wartime fats economy.
Between 1933 and 1939, Germany
carried out an extensive program in
the domestic production of animal
and vegetable fats. However, these
supplies are diminishing, and the
blockade prevents further imports.
"Continental Europe produced 3.3
million tons of animal and vegetable
fats in 1941-42 compared with 3.9
| million tons in pre-war years, owing
to the loss of feed imports," Professor
Brandt states.
Because of this lessening supply of
fats, soap is now made partially or
entirely of brasives and fillers in
, Europe. In France, soap has become
| as scarce as butter.
The fats situation in the remaining
j neutral European countries is far
better than in the occupied countries.
Karl Brandt, professor of Agricultural Economics, presents an optimistic
outlook on America's wartime fats supply in comparison with that of other
nations in his new War-Peace Pamphlet, '"Fats and Oils in the War," pub
lished by the Stanford Food Research Institute and Stanford University
Press.
"Even with direct consumer rationing of fats in force, the people in the

plied as they were during the decade
preceding this war," Professor Brandt
declares.
He expresses the opinion that re
ports of catastrophic fats shortages
have likely been exaggerated, al
though a real crop failure at the pres
ent time would make drastic adjust
ments in consumption of fats inevit
able.
America's present adequate supply
of fats, Professor Brandt explains, is
due largely to raised production goals
for all animal and oilseed fats since
January, 1942. Crops with revised
goals included peanuts, soybeans,
j linseed, and flaxseed.
Causes of Rationing

of home front production, but in-
