## Farm Will Try To Field Team 
### 
Stanford's head football coach, j
Marchie Schwartz, announced yes- (
terday that Stanford will try to field
a football team this year despite the
final stand that the Army may take. |
Schwartz said, in regard to the I
army viewpoint, "I don't know I
whether Army is going to let j
their men now in training at the j
Universities throughout the country, j
play football or not, but I do know I
that we want to field a team at Stan
ford if such a thing is possible."
Schwartz added, "I'd like every |
man registered in the University who
is interested in playing football, to !
contact me before leaving for vaca
tion. either at my office at the B.A.C.
or in the Gym."
This call for men is merely a feel
ing out measure to indicate how
many can be counted on to report for
practice this fall.
The Army, as yet, has released no
definite information as to whether
their men will or will not play, but J
most of the present releases regard- j
ing the subject have indicated that
they will not.
At the present time Stanford has a â– 
10-game football schedule, and res
ervations on Kezar Stadium for three j
of the contests.
