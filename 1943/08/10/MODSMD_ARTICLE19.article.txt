## Boathouse Boys Upset By Firehouse in Finale 
### 
Aided by some of the worst um
piring to be seen all season, the Fire
house team squeezed through to
victory by a score of 2-1 over the
Boathouse Boys to capture the play
oft championship. The game, played
on the Sunken Diamond, was called
on account of darkness after the
Firehouse had pushed across the
winning run in the last half of the
sixth inning.
The Boathouse got off to an early
lead in their half of the initial inning
when lead-off man Emmet Cashin
found himself perched on third as a
result of a drive through the infield
which the center fielder couldn't
handle. When he finally picked up
the ball, he threw it into the second
baseman who kicked it for a while.
Cashin scored on an infield out by
Hebert.
Firehouse Ties Game
The Firehouse came back in their
half of the first to tie the ball game.
After Halstead had been retired,
Pefley walked. Smith hit a single,
driving Pefley all the way around to
third. In an attempt to catch the
runner off third, Howie Dallmar,
Boathouse catcher, threw low to
third-baseman Albright and the ball
escaped into left field, allowing Pef
ley to score. Nicholson went out to
end the rally.
The winning marker came across
in the sixth when Smith walked to
start the winning. Nicholson then
hit the ball through the slot between
first and second into right field.

Smith scored all the way from first
I as both the right fielder and the sec
j ond baseman were sound asleep on
; the play.
Smoke Loses, Olio Wins
With a little more control, Smoke
! Morrison would be the best pitcher
in the league. He showed that to
â–  night when he let the Firehouse
j down with only two hits. He was
bested in this mound duel by Olie
| Baer who spaced six hits rather well.
| All three runs were unearned.
