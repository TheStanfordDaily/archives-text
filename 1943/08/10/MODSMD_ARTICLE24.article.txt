# The
						Story of the Banner
## 
### 
•pOR over 50 years all entering Stanford freshmen lived in
.17 Encina Hall. And each year the spirit of the men was one
of the biggest parts of campus life. But lumped together and
tempered by time, it wasn't the class of '97 or '21 or '44 that be
came important. It was Stanford —and the years of tradition that
made a great intangible, the Stanford Spirit.
Last year the Encina clubroom was redecorated. And when
the job was finished, the men who lived there decided to material
ize a bit of the Stanford Spirit and tradition. They purchased a
large red felt banner with STANFORD spelled in white. It was
it finishing touch. It meant the old Stanford which 50 years of
men had known—it meant the University to which thousands of
men would come in years ahead.
And when the Army moved into the old freshman hall, the
oanner in their social room and reading room distinguished
Stanford from other Army posts. When the STAR Units waited
< { or interviews, the banner was there to remind them that Encina
was once a great University hall.
But a few weeks ago someone stole the banner. There is no
.eason to believe it was a soldier. And civilian students have
seen in Encina since the Army took it over.
So to the regular Stanford students, if you know where the
banner is, we make this plea to you.
The banner means relatively little to an individual. Now it
ts the loot from a college raid. But in a few years, or months,
hat value will be gone. The immeasurable value of the same
banner, hanging in Encina, can not be matched.
In the possession of one or two, it is simply a large piece of
.ed and white felt; in the Encina clubroom, it is STANFORD to
'housands of men to come.
Please return the banner.
