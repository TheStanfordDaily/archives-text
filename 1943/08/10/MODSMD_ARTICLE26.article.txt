# Bull Session
## 
### BILL STRUTHERS 
The Victory Carnival this Friday promises to hit a new high.
That is, if I can get the Pant & Garter Club to carry out my idea.
Our little club wants to help the War Board win the war, and
we also want to keep Dr. Wilbur from feeling like a forgotten man
as this quarter—his last as acting-President—comes to an end.
My idea is to have a public dedication song sung in a booth
at the carnival. You would pay a nickel and go into the booth and
the members of the Pant & Garter Club would be lined up. Then
you would say, "I want to hear So-and-so sing it." And you
would sit there in our comber, classical booth and think of the
many ways that Dr. Wilbur had directly or indirectly influenced
your education here at Stanford, while your favorite member of
Pant <£ Garter sang the "Dr. Wilbur Dedication Song of 1943."
The song itself is taken from the Negro tune, "The St. James
Infirmary Blues." Just imagine the inspiration you would get
.from our booth. Someone would be reading a brief biography
of Dr. Wilbur in a monotone while your favorite singer moaned
out these parting blues.
"Let him go . . . let him go . . . God bless him
Wherever he may be.
I'll never find another sweet Prexv
Like the one he was to me . . . !"
Then while you slowly and thoughtfully and sadly walk out,
one of the members would give you an understanding slap on
the back and tell you what a good man Dr. Tresiddei is.
And you would feel much better—all for a nickel
(Editor's Note: This is worth a dime.)
