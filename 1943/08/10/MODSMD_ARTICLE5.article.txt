ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, North Africa, Aug. 9—The Germans col
lapsed rapidly in Sicily tonight before fresh Allied drives netting seven key
towns, one taken by a bold American landing coup behind the north coast
lines, and enemy remnants fled toward Messina, covered by suicide rear
guard squads.
Already the enemy was attempting to escape by small boats and barges

across the narrow Messina Strait t;
the Italian mainland, and front dis
patches reported hundreds were be
ing killed daily by Allied aerial
sweeps.
Striking with complete surprise
early Sunday, American troops who
had made the original landings ir
Morocco last November storme:
ashore six miles east of the Genua:*
line at San Agata.
The landing was unopposed, but
scarcely had the Americans go"
ashore when a German reinforce
ment column rolled up from the ea>*
and in a sharp battle the American
captured 300 prisoners and routed
the remaining enemy troops.
So unbalanced were the Germans
by this maneuver that the Americans
were able to seize San Agata and Sa::
Fratello, four miles inland, without a
fight.
