# Stanford Spirit Lost With Encina Banner
## 
### 
The last touch of the old Stan
ford in Encina has disappeared.
The red and white banner which
hung in the Encina cluhroom and
was purchased last year by the
freshmen in the Hall has been
taken.
A plea for its return is made by
the students who don't want the
Stanford Spirit to die; for its empty
place 011 the wall is no longer a
reminder to Encina's new occu
pants of the spirit which carried
the University through 50 years
and will continue.
