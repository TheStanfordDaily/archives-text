### 
Presenting a program which
showed off her skillful technic to the
utmost, Kato Mendelssohn proved
herself a very capable pianist in her
; piano recital on the Tuesday Evening
Series last night.
The program began with Godow
skys' transcription of the Pastorale
j from the "Christmas" Concerto by
! Archangelo Corelli, and was fol
lowed by the Beethoven Rondo,
i Opus 129. one of the master's lesser
| works.
Miss Mendelssohn performed the
: Chopin Berceuse excellently, not
; only playing it with a display of
! technical precision, but also showing
| a full understanding of the work.
She again exhibited her fine tech
nic in the gaudy Venezia e
Napoli. The audience, evidently not
being familiar with the composition,
burst into applause during a pause
in the middle of the work, but Miss
Mendelssohn did not seem disturbed
| and continued with perfect poise
i after the interruption.
j The second half of the program
| was made up of compositions by
modern composers, including Le
, cuona s Malaguena, which, however,
' seemed a bit out of place on the
j program.
Miss Mendelssohn stated that she
i enjoyed playing at Stanford because
j the campus is so beautiful and the
t audiences are so receptive, This was
| her third appearance on the campus.
A native of Hungary, Miss Men
| delssohn is a direct descendant of the
great German composer of the 19th
century. Felix Mendelssohn-Bai'th
oldy.
