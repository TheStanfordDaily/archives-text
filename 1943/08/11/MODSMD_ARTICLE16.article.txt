# Geology Group Studies Shells
## 
### 
The most complete collection of
seashells west of New England is
now being classified and interpreted
by several members of the geology
department. Each specimen is identi
fied and typed as to the date, place of
its collection, and its scientific name.
Indices and cross-files are kept for
each shell.
The geologists are not interested in
the beauty of their collection, but in
finding out what went on millions of
years ago. They can get this informa
tion from the recent and fossil shells
they have for observation.
Here at Stanford, a well-organized
suite of recent material is available
alongside a paleontological collection,
according to Miss Myra Keen, cur
ator, so that students can gain a
clearer insight into the structure,
classification, and ecologic I'elations
of the organisms they study.
The collection of contemporary and
fossil shells is fairly complete, Miss
Keen said, and geologists from Cali
fornia oil companies frequently con
sult it when they find specimen shells
they are unable to identify. With the
aid of the comparative material that
has been accumulated at Stanford for
over 50 years, they often can find
the right origin and species.
The government geologists, too, are
making use of the Stanford collection.
