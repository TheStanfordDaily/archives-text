# HONOR CODE
## Excom Creates New Committee 
### 
A standing committee has been
| created by Excom to supervise the
I education of students on the Honor
Code through their sponsors. They
will also help in strengthening the
j Honor Code whenever necessary, and
! in clarifying questions relating to
this subject arising between students,
| faculty, and soldiers.
So far this quarter the committee
has met just twice, but it is planning
I to meet again in the near future to
I draw up an Honor Code handbook,
which will go to each entering stu
dent. This book will clearly state
j the principles of the code and the
j students' responsibility under it.

! lish a statement of the Honor Code in
classrooms, on the army bulletin
boards, and in the Library. This
committee is to be composed of three
members from Ex Committee, two
J soldiers, the chairmen of Men's
j Council and Women's Council, and
I two faculty members. If there are
! any questions or suggestions about
| this committee, they may be taken to
