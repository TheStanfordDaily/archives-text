# Argentine Film To Play Sunday
## 
### 
Spanish-language posters which
are to be seen on various bulletin
boards on campus are Sigma Delta
Pi's means of announcing the Argen
tine-made film in Spanish, "Lo Que
Adoran las Mujeres," which is to be
exhibited next Sunday, 7:15 p.m.. in
Memorial Hall.
The posters, made in Mexico, are
the property of Axteca Films, of El i
Paso, Tex., the distributors of the i
picture. Each poster carries, under i
the title of the picture, this legend:
'"A super-production entirely in
Spanish, with the ideal couple of the
screen Hugo del Carril (Star of the ,
Tango) and the enchanting Amanda
Ledesma. The famous singer, in an
idyll full of poetry, sees his great j
love lost within the cold walls of a i
convent." Photographs taken from |
the film show, however, that the
story develops mostly in the milieu i
of modern Buenos Aires society.
Two short subjects, in color, will j
complete the program. The Stanford
Spanish group is offering this enter
tainment free to the public. Students !
of Spanish are especially urged to be j
present, but all who wish to come are
also welcome.
