## LATE TIPS 
### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
OPEN LETTER TO THE EDITOR,
I AND IN RETURN AN EXTIN
GUISHER FOR THE FIREIIOUSE.
"Here I go again, I hear the trump
ets blow again, All a—alio, what's
this?"
"Looks like a note pinned on the
door. Ah well, just the popularity
kid. Probably one of my many over
joyed faps. I'm going to have to hire
a secretary one of these days if this
keeps up.
"Dum-da-duin-dum-dum, taking
a chance on love —'The Editor, Sir:'
I That's a good start. Formal, but
nevertheless, a good start."
THIS IS IT
"There has been a general moan in
papers all over the country about
inaccuracies of sport writeups . . . .
particularly in Bill Leiser's column
in the Chronicle. The one in our
paper today about the game between
the Firehouse and Boathouse is a
'good' example. Mr. Leiser really has
I a right to moan. . . . You said it.
. . . Let's tear the article apart. . . .
(Ed's Note: Wonder how this thing
got in here? Well. I'm ready, spread
out and let's dance.)"
"A Raw Umpire"—Well!
"First the umpiring for both sides
i was raw —lousy; in fact; damn poor!
Not only was the Firehouse (Ed's.
Note: No one knows what the next
word is), but was the Boathouse, oh,
no, how about the slide into home
plate, out was he Mr. Langendorf?;
how about getting close (Ed's. Note:
Everybody take a -deep breath, it's
only the beginning) so you can see
the play? . . . Next. Nicholson's hit
was a clean triple; it was right down
j the first-base line and no matter
(Ed's. Note: Here we go again) how
j much asleep the fielders, one look at
I Nicholson would tell you that a man
| of less size might have made a home
j run out of it! Nick 'ain't' so fast on
his feet. . . . Look at the summary:
Whoever kept score must have played
fielder for the Boathouse for we
i garnered live hits that can be recol
lected. . . . Two by Bills, one by
Smith, one by Chamberlain, and one
by Pefly. . . . Also the little deal about
'Smoke' may be all right, but take a
look about how many walks were
' issued and also who won the game—
j Ollie isn't so bad. . . ."
"In the future let's try to do as
Leiser says, keep the sport sheets
clean. ... A unbiased sports writer
iis supposed to be unbiased (this
! makes a lot of sense) .... in other
words, wise up! or else get a new
| pair of eyes.
Print it.
The Firehouse."
The Extinguisher
Things like this make us so happy,
I and how in the heck did Bill Leiser
! get mixed up in this affair?
We think that Mr. Leiser has more
important things to do than get
mixed up in our personal Softball
arguments. If you have a kick against
Leiser or the Chronicle, let them
hear about it, and not us. Personally,
we like the "Green Sheet." That's
all. brother. 'Null said.
As to the game itself, you won,
I didn't you? Wise up. By the way,
I the letter was addressed to "The Edi
' tor, Sir:" Take a look at the "Mast
i head" sometime. There've been some
1 changes made.
