# Farm Summer Softball Teams Finish Season
## 
### Don Langendorf 
With Gerona A.C., the O'Bathouse
Boys, and the Firehouse completely
monopolizing summer Softball, the
President's League ended in a blaze
of glory Monday night with the Fire
house taking a 2 to 1 decision over
the O'Bathouse in the playoff series.
Last Friday evening, the O'Bathouse
reversed the results of an earlier
game when they defeated Gerona to
take the title. Previous to that game,
the two teams were tied for the lead
ership of the league.
Buchanan Fades
Buchanan and Gerona surged into
an early lead at the beginning of
the season. After the first four
games, however, Buchanan faded and
fast. With those four victories under
their belt, they went on to lose every
game after that.
In their first four games, Gerona
defeated both the Firehouse and the
Boathouse Boys. From there on, it
looked as though Gerona would end
the season undefeated. This wasn't
the case, however, as a bunch of the
boys living at Fillmore decided that
something should be done about the
mighty Gerona AG. That something
was done on a certain Friday night
in mid-July when Fillmore sprang
the biggest surprise of the season to
set Gerona down.
Boathouse Kises
After losing to Gerona in the sec
ond game of the season, the Boat
house Boys were not again to be
headed in the regular season as they
won 10 games in a row to end up in
a first-place deadlock. Counting the
play-offs, they won 12 straight games
before they suffered their second
defeat of the campaign.
Firehouse Finishes Third
The Firehouse, playing heads-up
ball all the time, finished up the sea
son in third place with only two
losses chalked up against them. Ex
cept for Gerona and the Boathouse.

the sensational pitching of Olie Baer.
the ]• irehouse defeated Monroe and
the Boathouse in the play-off series
to take the post-season title.
When it came around to living
quarters, Monroe Hall ended up at
the top of the heap, a full game
ahead of Lincoln Hall, top team of
the Freshman Halls.
After losing their first three
games, Cleveland came back with a
burst of speed to take their next four
games. They ended the season at an
even .500.
Fillmore, victors over Gerona,

finished in sixth place. After taking j
a sensational 36 (get the adding

defeated both the Firehouse and the
Boathouse Boys. From there on, it

the season undefeated. This wasn't
the case, however, as a bunch of the

something should be done about the
mighty Gerona AG. That something
was done on a certain Friday night
in mid-July when Fillmore sprang
the biggest surprise of the season to
set Gerona down.
