# A Third Front?
## 
### 
PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT hase been vacationing in Canada,
but his trip was not all pleasure. Yesterday, after Roosevelt
.returned to the White House, the arrival of Prime Minister Win
ston Churchill in Canada was announced.
Churchill arrived with members of his staff to confer with
Roosevelt for the sixth time since 1941.
We might well speculate upon the topic for this conference,
but first let us review the past five Roosevelt-Churchill confer
ences.
In August 1941, the chiefs of United States and Britain had
heir first historic meeting at sea somewhere in the Atlantic. They
formulated the "Atlantic Charter" which was a declaration of
*he principles for which the United Nations are fighting.
At the White House in December, almost immediately after
.Pearl Harbor, Churchill, Russian and Chinese Ambassadors, the
Canadian Prime Minister, Netherlands Minister, and Roosevelt
net to plan "the defeat of Hitlerism throughout the world."
The third meeting, on June 23, 1942, was also in Washington.
Vleeting with them were 10 Anglo-American shipping experts,
and together they planned how we could obtain the earliest
naximum concentration of Allied war power upon the enemy.
The most dramatic of all meetings was held in Casablanca,
January 14-24, 1943. Roosevelt announced that the United Na
tions would demand "unconditional surrender" from the Axis
oowers.
May 11, 1943 was the fifth meeting between the men, and the
hird to be held at Washington. Churchill brought a staff of
nilitary and naval experts with him, and we were told that they
vere planning a single concerted effort of all Allied power
against the Axis. We now know that the invasion of Sicily was
he strategy discussed at this meeting.
The conquest of Sicily is nearly over. Italian resistance is
slacking although Badoglio still shuns peace. Hamburg has been
razed by bombs . . . civilians have evacuated Berlin, the Russians
advance on all fronts and the news comes that Churchill and
Roosevelt are meeting for the sixth time.
A third front might well be underway.â€”Vashti O'Donnell
