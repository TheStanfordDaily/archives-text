# Students and Housing
## 
### 
atEARLY 50 officers and 90 enlisted men on campus who are
IN not being trained in the ASTU cannot live in University res
dences, and must obtain living quarters in Palo Alto. Many
wives of army personnel also desire housing in the vicinity, also.
The facilities of this area are already crowded with service
men and defense workers and their families. If it is within his
power, it is the duty and privilege of the Stanford student to
help alleviate this serious shortage.
Approximately 500 civilian students are living off-campus
"his quarter. If the rooms occupied by these students were made
available to army personnel, it would go a long way toward
easing the present situation.
Some of the halls available to University students are vacant
at present, and cannot be occupied by anyone except registered
students. It seems too bad that they should be empty when there
:is such a great housing emergency.â€”Jane Donald
