Our soldiers here in the ASTU have been known to criticize
Stanford women for their snobbishness. And Stanford women
with them have become somewhat unpopular because of their
superior attitude.
Dick Arnold, former Stanford drinker, lover, and writer, writes
:trom Colorado College that the same thing has happened to the j
100 Stanford men now stationed at Colorado Springs with the !
Navy College Training Program.
Women here are so-so, he said. There are enough good ones
to go around for the guys from Stanford, but that's all. Funny
ihing is that Stanford men are extremely unpopular with these !
local girls. It seems that in various subtle ways we have been j
showing them that we think they are not good enough for us.
That ought to make Stanford women feel good.
