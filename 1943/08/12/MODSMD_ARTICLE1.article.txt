## 
### 
Stanford men and women will bring packages of cigarettes and pieces of
junk jewelry to the Women's Gym at 7:15 Friday night to gain admission to
the War Board Victory Carnival, a celebration with a high aim. and will
spend their nickels and dimes on everything from cokes to throwing pennies.
At 8:.'»0, couples will buy tickets to go to the juke box dance in the gym.

and instead of being bothered with
return stubs every time they want
to leave the floor to patronize con
cessions, couples will have their
hands stamped.
With 15 concessions placed around
the gym arcade by different campus
organizations and living groups, the
War Board hopes to gain profit,
which will be turned over to the
campus Dimes for Diplomas drive.
'"This will be more fun than the
annual Soph Carnivals," said Betty
May Hale, War Board coordinator.
' And this time, we'll be spending
money, true, but for a good cause.
Besides, it's possible to win cigarettes,
popcorn, peanuts, etc., at t>he con
cession booths."
Give 'Em the Axe
The fact that it's not football sea
son will not stop Rick Supple from
leading Farm students in the famous
Axe yell. But this time it goes to a
much more important enemy than
Cal—the Axis, according to Miss
Hale.
Preceding the yell, the program
will be opened by a talk given by a
Navy Chaplain recently returned
from battle in the South Pacific area.
The Stanford Hymn will be the
finale.
Scrapbook Concession
One of the concessions will be a
scrapbook table, and this will be the
only one than can be played with
for no cost. Evei'y person attending
the Carnival will be asked to work
for about 10 minutes at this table,
cutting pictures out of Esquires, New
Yorkers, and other magazines and
pasting them in scrapbooks. These
will be sent to convalescing service
men.
Cardinals will sponsor the foods
concession, and cokes and ice cream
will be available.
' Everyone on campus is invited,
including civilians, soldiers, faculty,
and other campus residents," said
Miss Hale. "This is one of the most
useful projects attempted by Stan
ford students, and by turning out
en masse, they will help make it
possible for Stanford men to con
tinue their education after the war."
