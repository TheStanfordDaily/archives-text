# 'Clutching Hand' Delayed Enroute
## 
### 
"What happened to the Clutching
Hand, Chapter 13?" was the question
asked Sunday night after the Tillson
, Talkies program in the Memorial
I Auditorium.
In answer, Miss Tillson announced
| that due to difficulties and misunder
-1 standings in transportation, the com
! pany which handles the short was
unable to have the much talked of
chapter on campus by Sunday. In
stead, the film traveled from Los An
geles to Atlanta, then back to Chi
cago, and will probably arrive here
sometime this week.
