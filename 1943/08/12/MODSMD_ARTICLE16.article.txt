## One-Acts Win Critic's Land 
### Adolph Gugel 
The Stanford Players gave the first
1 performance of their final production
for Summer Quarter, three one-act
plays from Noel Coward's "Tonight
at 8:30," last night.
â€¢The opener, "Hands Across the
Sea," proved far the best of the
three, being not only the best cast,
but also having the best script of the
three plays. '
Mysterious Plot
The plot concerns a case of mis
taken identity and the play has an
abundance of really good lines. The
leading role, that of Lady Maureen,
was played by Joyce Hendei'son and
the part of her husband was por
trayed by Richard Ogg. Jean Levin
son, who played one of Lady Mau
reen's friends, stole the show, how
ever.
The circus style of seating used in
the presentation of the plays was not
only novel, but well adaptable to the
plays.
The staging was also well done,
and the sets and costumes also added
to make it an enjoyable performance.
The second play, "Ways and
Means" was not so clever as the first,
but was nevertheless amusing. David
Sievers and Nan Tillson played the
j leading roles.
, "Family Album"
The last of' the three plays, "Family
Album," was the dullest of the three,
and moved rather slowly. This cast
I requires not only actors but singers.
While there can be no important
! complaint about the acting, the sing
ing on the other hand, was weak and
i lacked spark as well as vocal talent.
The outstanding performance in
j "Family Album" was Dr. B. Q. Mor
gan's portrayal of the aged and deaf
family butler.
"Tonight at 8:30" will be presented
again tonight, tomorrow, and Satur
day nights. John F. Sollers is di-
I rector.
