# LATE TIPS

### BY LATE WILLIAMS 
Ten men. That's how many have |
reported to Marchie Schwartz so far j
in his quest for football talent.
There are undoubtedly many more [
potential players on the campus that {
will turn out —that is, we hope that I
there are.
One thing is certain. If Stanford |
does field a team this fall —and indi
cations are pointing more and more
that way—it won't come within
shooting distance of the size of for
mer squads.
We remember when the radio an- j
nouncer used to say, ". . . and now j
coming on the field is the University i
of Stanford football team . . and |
a seemingly endless line of Red and I
White warriors would pour out on !
the field and cover it from goal to J
goal.
This won't be the case this season.
The Main Thing
We think that the important thing
will be the fact that Stanford fields
a team, regardless of its size in num
bers.
Marchie Schwartz is one of the
best coaches in the business for our
money, and regardless of the quantity
of players he will have to work with,
you can be pretty sure that his fin
ished product will be high in quality.
The truth of this remains to be seen,
but we will stick with our guns no
matter what happens.
It's going to take quality and
quality plus to stand up against
teams such as the University of
Southern California and the Univer
sity of California will field. We can
expect no wins from these two op
ponents, but if we play them, we can
be sure of one thing right now.
Schwartz will field a team that will
make a ball game out of it.
The Effort's Here
What we like at the present time
is the definite effort being made to
have a team despite what the Army's
final decision may be. A while back,
it looked, or rather seemed, that we
were going to cash in our chips with
out even looking at our cards.
The question as to the possibility
ol us having a team has been hashed,
re-hashed, and finally laid aside by
nearly everybody inerested. Now,
they are only waiting for the final
word to break. There is nothing
more to say on the subject. Yet
still ....
Ten men. One more and we'll have
11.
LATE'S FATE . . .
This is it.
Thanks to the entire sports staff
for their help ... all three of them:
Don Langendorf, who handled the
brunt of the job and did a good job
while doing it.
Jim Weinberg, who doubled on
sports and H.C.E., and . . .
Hog Corman, who helped us keep
above water on intramural write-ups.
Our sincere apologies to the Boat
house Boys and the Firehouse if they
feel they've been slighted. We
couldn't win 'em all. but we hope
that we've won a few of them.
That's it. •—3o—

The question as to the possibility
ol us having a team has been hashed,
re-hashed, and finally laid aside by
nearly everybody inerested. Now,
they are only waiting for the final
word to break. There is nothing
more to say on the subject. Yet
still ....
Ten men. One more and we'll have
11.
LATE'S FATE . . .
This is it.
Thanks to the entire sports staff
for their help ... all three of them:
Don Langendorf, who handled the
brunt of the job and did a good job
while doing it.
Jim Weinberg, who doubled on
sports and H.C.E., and . . .
Hog Corman, who helped us keep
above water on intramural write-ups.
Our sincere apologies to the Boat
house Boys and the Firehouse if they
feel they've been slighted. We
couldn't win 'em all. but we hope
that we've won a few of them.
That's it. •—3o—
Ten men. That's how many have |
reported to Marchie Schwartz so far j
in his quest for football talent.
There are undoubtedly many more [
potential players on the campus that {
will turn out —that is, we hope that I
there are.
One thing is certain. If Stanford |
does field a team this fall —and indi
cations are pointing more and more
that way—it won't come within
shooting distance of the size of for
mer squads.
We remember when the radio an- j
nouncer used to say, ". . . and now j
coming on the field is the University i
of Stanford football team . . and |
a seemingly endless line of Red and I
White warriors would pour out on !
the field and cover it from goal to J
goal.
This won't be the case this season.
The Main Thing
We think that the important thing
will be the fact that Stanford fields
a team, regardless of its size in num
bers.
Marchie Schwartz is one of the
best coaches in the business for our
money, and regardless of the quantity
of players he will have to work with,
you can be pretty sure that his fin
ished product will be high in quality.
The truth of this remains to be seen,
but we will stick with our guns no
matter what happens.
It's going to take quality and
quality plus to stand up against
teams such as the University of
Southern California and the Univer
sity of California will field. We can
expect no wins from these two op
ponents, but if we play them, we can
be sure of one thing right now.
Schwartz will field a team that will
make a ball game out of it.
The Effort's Here
What we like at the present time
is the definite effort being made to
have a team despite what the Army's
final decision may be. A while back,
it looked, or rather seemed, that we
were going to cash in our chips with
out even looking at our cards.
