i the ground in a 4:0(5.9 mile run.
Undefeated in seven previous starts
j in this country, Hagg had sought, to
i regain the world record for the mile
in this race, but the track was off and
the long-legged Scandinavian was
unable even to approach the 4:02.0
mark established by Arne Anderson,
a fellow Swede.
Although his time was not up to
expectations, the Smorgasbord Spe
cial kept his record' clean as he fin
ished a stride ahead of Gilbert Dodds,
the Boston theological student, with
big Bill Hulse, former N.Y.U. ace
third, another five yards back. Dodds

crossing in 4:08.2.
Hagg, who will return to Sweden

disappointed" in not breaking the
world record or at least smashing
the 4:05.3 American mark he estab
lished July 24 at Boston.
It was Hagg, Hulse, and Dodds all
the way and the fact that the disap
pointed fans knew there would be
no record did not detract from the
spine-tingling battle they fought all
the way io the tape.
