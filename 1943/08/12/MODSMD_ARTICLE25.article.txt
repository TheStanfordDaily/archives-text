# Why Men Should Live in Halls
## 
### 
NEXT week room reservations for Autumn Quarter will be
received in the Dean of Men's office from those men students
not now living in the halls.
This quarter a peculiar housing situation existed here. While
There were calls every day at the Dean of Men's office for living
accommodations for those servicemen and their families who
must live off-campus, many of the halls were vacant. However
these halls can be occupied only by students.
This quarter one-third of the men students lived off-campus.
This was not caused by financial difficulties, for in general, living
on campus is less expensive. The University makes no profit
::rom these halls, for any profit is turned over to the fraternities,
all losses are taken by the University.
It is hoped that a large percentage of those civilian students
planning to attend Stanford this fall will reserve rooms in Univer
sity residences next week. It is one answer to the civilian hous
ing shortage. â€”Jane Donald
