THE Library becomes a popular place at this time of the quarter.
Term papers are due and finals are approaching.
All quarter the. main library has closed at 4 p.m. on Saturdays
and all day Sundays. The labor shortage is probably the reason.
However, now more than ever, the students need that time to
do reference work which can be done nowhere else. If it were
oossible to open the Library during those two days for the re
mainder of the quarter, the everlasting gratitude of the students
would be inspired.—Jane Donald
