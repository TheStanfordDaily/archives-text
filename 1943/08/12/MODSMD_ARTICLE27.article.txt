# Bull Session

### BILL STRUTHERS 
AT LAST I've been criticized for the rah-rah tint in this quar
er's Bull Session. It's a valid criticism and something I've felt,
so I want to explain why I have called your attention to the Pant
5r Garter Club instead of our responsibility in winning the war.
You don't have to be told when to blow your nose if you're
Did enough to go to college. I think it's the same with the impor
tance of winning the war. We're old enough and intelligent
enough to be bored with propaganda movies. We can develop
a love for America without sitting through four hours of flag
waving—or reading about Hitler's challenge to Democracy in the
Bull Session.
I have felt no responsibility to comment one way or another
Dn the war, because I am not that kind of a guy. I do not say this
is right or this is wrong. Instead I say this is the way things are.
I try to be articulate. No more. I try to put into tangible words
what you yourself have been half-forming into half-ideas.
I want to be more subtle about winning the war. I go off on
•the big subject of Life with a capital L. I try to get you to see the
beauty of the natural arrangement of things about you. Not as
they are carefully lined up for you by professors or God, but as
they happen to haphazardly land around you. i want you to sub
merge yourself, to breathe deeply, to drain each moment, to filter
your impressions for quality, to be vigorous about it, and to be
proud of what you really see.
I want you to be so enthusiastic about the things and people
that you see that you will want to get into the v/ar to increase the
urgency and the tempo of their impressions.
Fighting the war or building ships or being a nurse is one way
of increasing this tempo and getting a closer contact with the
■reality of life.
And after the war, local politics does the same thing. Be
mayor of your home town or alternate member of the school
board or president of the P.T.A. and you'll contribute the same
service to peace as fighting means to the war.
But above all, I want to encourage you to express yourself,
io release the energy that's inside each of us—whether you run
a gas station, or be the Napoleon of an insane asylum, or write
a symphony, or sit on a cocktail stool, or write a Bull Session of
campus chatter.
But by telling you to release this energy I don't mean that
we should forget about winning the war.

Did enough to go to college. I think it's the same with the impor
tance of winning the war. We're old enough and intelligent
enough to be bored with propaganda movies. We can develop
a love for America without sitting through four hours of flag
waving—or reading about Hitler's challenge to Democracy in the
Bull Session.
I have felt no responsibility to comment one way or another
Dn the war, because I am not that kind of a guy. I do not say this
is right or this is wrong. Instead I say this is the way things are.
I try to be articulate. No more. I try to put into tangible words
what you yourself have been half-forming into half-ideas.
I want to be more subtle about winning the war. I go off on
•the big subject of Life with a capital L. I try to get you to see the
beauty of the natural arrangement of things about you. Not as
they are carefully lined up for you by professors or God, but as
they happen to haphazardly land around you. i want you to sub
merge yourself, to breathe deeply, to drain each moment, to filter
your impressions for quality, to be vigorous about it, and to be
proud of what you really see.
I want you to be so enthusiastic about the things and people
that you see that you will want to get into the v/ar to increase the
urgency and the tempo of their impressions.
Fighting the war or building ships or being a nurse is one way
of increasing this tempo and getting a closer contact with the
■reality of life.
And after the war, local politics does the same thing. Be
mayor of your home town or alternate member of the school
board or president of the P.T.A. and you'll contribute the same
service to peace as fighting means to the war.
But above all, I want to encourage you to express yourself,
io release the energy that's inside each of us—whether you run
a gas station, or be the Napoleon of an insane asylum, or write
a symphony, or sit on a cocktail stool, or write a Bull Session of
campus chatter.
But by telling you to release this energy I don't mean that
we should forget about winning the war.
AT LAST I've been criticized for the rah-rah tint in this quar
er's Bull Session. It's a valid criticism and something I've felt,
so I want to explain why I have called your attention to the Pant
5r Garter Club instead of our responsibility in winning the war.
You don't have to be told when to blow your nose if you're
