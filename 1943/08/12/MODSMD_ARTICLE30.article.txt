# Children's Gym Classes Teach Folk Dancing, Summer Sports
## 
### Beatrice Paul 
The Stanford Children's Gym classes are meeting again this year in the
Women's Gym with Mrs. Maude Knapp in charge. Originally started as
swimming classes, they are enlarged to include tennis, archery, modern
dance, and folk dancing.
This year the swimming classes have been discontinued due to the closing

of the pool. For this class, games and
stunts have been substituted.
The reason for beginning the i
classes was to provide instruction for
the children of graduate students and i
faculty in the summer, and to dem- I
onstrate proper teaching methods to
P.E. majors.
The program became so popular,
both with parents and children, that
the enrollment has been steadily in
creasing. Enrollment is by reserva
tion, and no class is larger than can
be well taken care of, most of them
numbering about 30. An increasing
number of children have been com
ing from areas near Stanford.
At present, the groups consist of
girls of 8, 9, and 10 who take i-hythm
and elementary dancing from Mrs.
Lidster. Mrs. Roth has replaced their :
swimming course with stunts and
tumbling, kick ball, relays, and run
ning games. The older girls, who are
11 and 12, study dancing and archery.
Mrs. Lidster's classes study folk
dancing and modern dance. The old
est girls (12 to 16) do some work
comparable to beginning work in i
college, and later will do composition, j
The younger girls study rhythm and
folk dancing.
While the children are enjoying
themselves, they are really learning, |
as are the faculty and grad students I
who are teaching them.
