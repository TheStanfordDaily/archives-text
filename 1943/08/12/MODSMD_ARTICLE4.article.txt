# INTER HOUSE
## Men Organize New Council 
### 
Initiating a new movement in
campus student government, Men's
Council met Tuesday, July 10. at 4
p.m. with representatives from living
groups to form the Inter House
Council, an organization for im
proved student government.
Although promoted by Men's
Council, this body will be purely in
dependent, exercising only legislative
powers, while Men's Council is in
the judicial department.
Excom's Idea
The idea was suggested in the last
Excom meeting at which time Janet
McClanahan, A.S.S.U. president, de
scribed the relation of the proposed
council to the student body as one of
a link between Excom and the stu
dents. Thus through this new or
ganization, the average person would
be able to exercise more direct con
trol over student body government.
Miss McClanahan also explained that
this council would take the place of
the Inter Hall Council and Inter
Fraternity Council of former days.
The purposes of the Inter House
Council will be to carry information
from Excom to the students, to pre
sent problems of the dormitories to
take responsibility for government of
the houses.
House Representatives
According to Bill Struthers, Men's
Council chairman, the president or
man most like the president, accord
ing to the type of government prac
ticed in the house, will be its repre
sentative, and membership is com
pulsory.
Meetings will be held once a week
and at the next meeting the repre
sentatives will choose a president to
serve Fall Quarter.
