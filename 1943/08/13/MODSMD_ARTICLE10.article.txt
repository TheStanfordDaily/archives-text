### 
Nothing definite lias been said
as yet and the War Department
i* still hedging on the subject but
authoritative sources claim that a
service medal will soon be struck
commemorating the Battle of
Stanford. The proposed medal
>hown above, as conceived by the
artist in his studio at the Long
barn. consists of a bronze medal
lion suspended by a red. white
and blue ribbon. Clasps on the
ribbon denote encounters during
the struggle. More information on
the awarding of the medal will be
made as new developments are
discovered. At present there lias
been no word on requirements to
be met other than active partici
pation in the campaign.
