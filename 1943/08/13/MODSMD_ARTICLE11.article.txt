Training Units, including the one on
this campus.
Organized on company lines, en
listed men do the work of commis
sioned officers and ax~e graded for
their efficiency and officerlike qual
ities. It is their job to see that dis
cipline is maintained, that attendance
is "all present or accounted for," that
mail and laundry are collected and
distributed, and that passes are given
out to those eligible for them.
Personnel of the cadet system in
cludes the company captain, his ex
ecutive officer (a first lieutenant),
two second lieutenants attached to
the company headquarters, platoon
lieutenants, a first sergeant, mail and
supply sergeants and squad leaders.
Each member of a company is usual
ly appointed to one of these positions
during his training period here.
Cadet officers and noncoms are en
titled to the respect due regular offi
cers and. should they be acting in
the capacity of commissioned officers,
they are entitled to a salute from the
