# Gremlin Company Found at Stanford
## 
### 
Don't make a date with a soldier
from Company J, ladies of Stan
ford. for that's the Gremlin outfit
110 phone, no dorm, and no men.
Somehow or other, the Army has
come to regard a J company as a
sort of 13th floor and has omitted
this letter from all of its organiza
tions. In ancient times Company
.1 was said to he the goldbrick out
fit of an army, so the Stanford
ASTU is taking no chances.
