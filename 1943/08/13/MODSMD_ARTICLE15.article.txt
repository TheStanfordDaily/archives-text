## Army Forms Ball League 
### Pfc. Murray Olderman 
The Stanford soldier has too many
encounters with passe antcrieur
tenses,, C'hir.t?se voice tones, and
geometric equations to preoccupy
himself with Stan Musial's hatting
or the progress of Brooklyn's Bums.
But like his compatriots in the Pa
cific, Europe, or even the California
desert, sports symbolize America for
him.
Although the Army has not al
lowed its soldiers to participate in
intercollegiate competition, the Uni
versity has organized an extensive
physical fitness program. First, Har
ry Maloney, director of minor sports
and a Stanford man for 34 years,
puts the ASTU's through a torso
: twisting drill each afternoon at 3:30
i o'clock . After half an hour the ac
| tivities branch out.
Topping the list are the two soft
ball leagues organized in the ASTU
j companies, E, F, G. H, I, and K.
i First is the Col. Harry B. Allen
League, and the Gen. Douglas B.
Mac-Arthur League is only a notch
lower. The special service officer in
charge of the leagues is Capt. J. F.
Hoon.
i Volleyball League
A volleyball league starts Mon
day. Swimming, handball, football,
gymnastics, etc., are also on the list
| of daily activities.
Because of the uncertain status
| of its men, the STAR unit does not
: have organized intramurals, but
; they do have calisthenics and intra
! company games every morning.
Too many men here aren't fa
| miliar with the brand of instruction
j they're getting. The fellow with the
rolled-up pants cuffs, the turned-up
! hat, and the wry smileâ€”he's Harry
| Wolter, who banged around pro
fessional baseball for 19 years, 10
| of them in the major leagues with
! Boston, New York, Chicago, and
j Cincinnati.
Football Coach
Mild, unobtrusive, black-haired
! Marchie Schwartz may be standing
next to him. He's Stanford's war
| time football coach, a product of
Knute Rockne's last year at Notre
Dame.
Everett Dean is the tall, heavy
fellow who issues daily activity in
structions and is an integral part
of Stanford athletics.
