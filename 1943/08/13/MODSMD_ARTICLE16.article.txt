# Army Specialized Program Trains Engineer Technicians
## 
### 
Not the glamour of the Far East
ern area nor the romance of the
European theater but rather the
fundamentals of good old Yankee
'know how" are the rewards of the
engineers as a result of their stud
ies under the Army Specialized
Training program.
While the work and studies of the
engineer in school do not compare
with various foreign areas in color
and interest, his studies are of the
variety that foster the growth of
great cities, planes that climb to
new heights, and, through all this,
the implements for carrying on

modern warfare . . . and reconstruc
tion after the victory has been won.
Advanced course engineers, such
as those who form the entire com
plement of E Company, are taking
subjects usual to the engineering
field: mechanical, civil, electrical,
chemical. In pursuance of these
studies the men are studying
calculus, physics, thermodynamics,
electronics and other related sub
jects.
The present war brought to the
fore the dearth of men with this type
of training, training vitally needed
to carry on a modern war.
