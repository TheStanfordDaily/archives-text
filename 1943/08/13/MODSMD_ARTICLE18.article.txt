# The 						Soldier-Student
## 
### 
WITH the institution of the Army Specialized Training Program
at Stanford a major innovation both in method of military
training and in technique of college education has occurred. The
soldier-student of World War II may well be the guinea pig that
paves the way for a better trained soldier and a more highly
educated student after the war.
A constant stream of khaki-clad students has been pouring
into this campus since mid May and when each one leaves he
will be minutely prepared for specific war tasks, whether they
be in the field of engineering, medicine, psychology or govern
ment administration and liaison work in foreign areas. Men on
this campus are being prepared to win the war and secure the
peace that follows. In many cases they will be concerned with
the constructive rather than the destructive aspects of warfare
and in this manner the effects of the training given here will be
far reaching.
Not a few college courses have been completely scrapped
and new ones compiled which will be directly applicable to the
preparation that is needed. For instance, in the Far Eastern Area
and Language School such courses as anthropology, geography,
history, and political science have been combined under one staff
of instructors; brought into line with the phases of the subject
which the Army desires its soldiers to know; and then delivered
to the soldier-student with strong emphasis on the application of
these subjects to the problems he must face.
The soldier-student himself is in a particularly fortunate posi
tion. Not only is he being given a tailor-made education to train
him for military service, he is also the recipient of much of the
practical knowledge which a college education can instill; and
this, of course, can be utilized in his later, civilian life.
All in all, the advent of war has brought one great benefit to
the American soldier-student—it has given him the opportunity
to use his mind as well as his body to defend his country and its
ideals.—Warren W. Unna
