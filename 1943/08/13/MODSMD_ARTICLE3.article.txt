# ASTU's Must Start Now To Assume Leadership
## 
### 
To the ASTU:
We are getting the bugs ironed out as we move forward into
another term. Though we can all see a few more kinks that need
straightening out (mostly in the other fellow, maybe!) I person
ally wouldn't want to be with any other bunch in the Army.
Here at any rate the boys are guick on the trigger mentally.
You can get an intelligent discussion on world affairs and things
worth bull-sessioning about. Back in the barracks, in our Cam-;
at least, there wasn't much thinking at all above the Comic Book
Jazz, Sex, and Corn level.
So we're the bright boys of the Army? At least that's wha.
they tell us. (We may murmur cynically "Heaven help the
Army. But there s some truth in the idea that we've got less thar.
the usual amount of ivory between the ears. Secretly, we may
even be a little proud of it.)
Where Government Begins
Why shouldn t our future be as bright as our brains are sup
posed to be? You may say we don't know what our future is tc
be. Personally I think it depends a lot on how much responsibil
ity we take, regardless at the moment whether our sleeves o:
shoulders are decorated with strips of angular cloth or wit:
metal bars. It is right here in the ASTU that our training in Mil.
tary Government begins. If we can't govern ourselves, how ths
heck are we going to govern the Germans or Italians?
Our future jobs may be a darn sight more important than anv
of us think. It often happens when you're in the middle of a
thing that you don't see how important it is or can be. Civilians
in responsible positions to whom I have talked about our training
at Stanford at once grasp its significance and spark to the whole
idea. You've probably found the same.
Winning the Peace
Obviously, the first job is to win the war, and we're ready at
the drop of the Army's hat to do our part in that. But after we get
victory, what are we going to do with it? Somebody's got to
tackle the no less tough and brain-cracking job of winning the
peace.
We'll have to deal with very practical matters, including the
raw—and it will be raw—material out of which nations are made
—good old, bad old human nature. The basic problems will boi.
down to hates whose intensity may surprise us, resentments
fears and the corrosive selfishness which have eaten into the
heart of all countries and brought on the biggest bust-up i::
history.
Yet out of this raw material, this human nature that lies bac!
of economics, politics, and social problems, we will have a pa:
in shaping a new civilization, one that must hold together an,
go places. It will be a different kind of fight, but it will be
fight none the less. It will reguire as much brain-sweat, carinc
teamwork and willingness to take responsibility as any arnr,
leadership demands.
War of Ideas
This world war is a War of Ideas, of rival philosophies. It :
a battle to control the minds of the millions. To miss that fact i
to be blind to what the war's all about. World philosophies a:
on the march, mobilizing millions for world ideological suprer.:
acy. We need air supremacy. But we also need ideological s;..
premacy. We need the force of arms plus the Superforce of a.
unconquerable spirit.
Ideas are explosives. They are "mental blockbusters." Yov
cannot bayonet an Idea. You cannot shoot it down with a fighte.
plane. To conquer Ideas you have to have better Ideas.
Hitler fired nation before he fired a shot. He had a Big Ides
So did Marx and Lelin. Millions march today to bring to powe.
the dictatorships of the Super Race or the Super Class.
What is our answer? What is America's Big Idea that wiil
conquer the "isms"? Is it just the dictatorship of the Super
Dollar? Is Materialism and the Worship of Things enough? Oi
have we something that sticks with us from the foundation of
our country, the answering Big Idea that kept George Washing
ton and his men going at Valley Forge. That gave Lincoln his
strength in dark years of war.
What philosophy and program are we going to put before
the citizens of Axis countries we occupy and Axis-held lands we
liberate? What have we got down in black and white that would
win over a young Nazi from the doctrines of "Mein Kampf"?
This war is being fought with brains as well as bullets. The
ideologies use mind and muscle both. Unless we have an ade
quate ideology and live up to it, we'll find that some ideology
less to our liking is taking us over. You know what happens to
a vacuum sooner or later.
Why shouldn't our gang here in ASTP set the pace in thinking
