# Paul Fejos Brings ASTU Picture of Native Life
## 
### 
Surrounded by indignant native
relatives who are forcing an Indo
nesian "shotgun" wedding, the har
med ASTU hero of a recent soldier
cartoon bemoans the fact that "Fejos
didn't tell me about this."
Object of the soldier's misgivings is
Dr. Paul Fejos—physician, anthro
pologist, explorer, and author—who
since early July has been a lecturer
in the Army's Far Eastern Area and
Language School.
To begin the bridging of the gap
between the average American's
stereotype of the native as an unin
telligent, inhuman "savage," and the
ruth, which is for the most part
directly opposite, is the job falling to
he Hungarian lecturer.
Fejos was born in Budapest in
1897 and educated in medicine, re
ceiving a degree from the Royal
Hungarian University in 1919. Until
1926 he stayed with medical research.
Then, motivated by a desire for
travel, he began his anthropoligical
studies and field work which have
ed him over truly "unbeaten" paths.
Expedition
Madagascar, Portuguese Mozam
bique, the Seychelles Archipelago,
China, Siam, the Malay Peninsula,
the East Indian islands of Sumatra,
Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, New
Guinea, the Peruvian Andes, and the
headwaters of the Amazon River
have all been locales for his expedi
tions between 1934 and 1941.
A typical expedition led into the
Southeastern Cordillera of the Peru
vian Andes in 1940-41. There, ac
companied by 15 white specialists
and a native group ranging from 38
o 800, depending on terrain, the ex
pedition mapped some 45,000 square
kilometers of virgin jungle, un

earthed seven pre-Columbian cities,
and specialized in observing and re
cording the cultural pattern of the
j Yaguaindians.
After a forced landing by hydro
| plane, the explorers discovered a lost
colony of Spanish and Brazilian rub
ber collectors who, after their white
employers had abandoned them to
the jungle, had intermarried with
1 the native Indians to form a new
, colony, the Pinquins.
Interims
In the interims between travels,
Fejos writes, lectures, advises in mo
j tion picture production. At the pres
ent time he is director of the Viking
Foundation, prominent anthropolo
gical organization in New York City.
Equipped with a wealth of ex
! amples, humorous and tragic, and a
repertoire of physical expression,
perhaps coming from long years of
explaining his presence to jungle
audiences, Fejos constantly spot
lights two points—that native peoples
j are human in their reactions and will
i respond favorably to treatment as
humans, and that they must be ap
j proached with an understanding of
I native customs, and a "native" view
! point.
His audience never ceases to be
I fascinated by a modest "jack of all
! trades" who, with the certainty of
having been many places and done
j many things, could outline the.ap
proach to problems of a far wider
! range than time allows, including
| those of a G.I. Romeo and his native
j love life.

Surrounded by indignant native
relatives who are forcing an Indo
nesian "shotgun" wedding, the har
med ASTU hero of a recent soldier
cartoon bemoans the fact that "Fejos
didn't tell me about this."
Object of the soldier's misgivings is
Dr. Paul Fejos—physician, anthro
pologist, explorer, and author—who
since early July has been a lecturer
in the Army's Far Eastern Area and
Language School.
To begin the bridging of the gap
between the average American's
stereotype of the native as an unin
telligent, inhuman "savage," and the
ruth, which is for the most part
directly opposite, is the job falling to
he Hungarian lecturer.
Fejos was born in Budapest in
1897 and educated in medicine, re
ceiving a degree from the Royal
Hungarian University in 1919. Until
1926 he stayed with medical research.
Then, motivated by a desire for
travel, he began his anthropoligical
studies and field work which have
ed him over truly "unbeaten" paths.
Expedition
Madagascar, Portuguese Mozam
bique, the Seychelles Archipelago,
China, Siam, the Malay Peninsula,
the East Indian islands of Sumatra,
Java, Bali, Lombok, Sumbawa, New
Guinea, the Peruvian Andes, and the
headwaters of the Amazon River
have all been locales for his expedi
tions between 1934 and 1941.
A typical expedition led into the
Southeastern Cordillera of the Peru
vian Andes in 1940-41. There, ac
companied by 15 white specialists
and a native group ranging from 38
o 800, depending on terrain, the ex
pedition mapped some 45,000 square
kilometers of virgin jungle, un

earthed seven pre-Columbian cities,
and specialized in observing and re
cording the cultural pattern of the
j Yaguaindians.
After a forced landing by hydro
| plane, the explorers discovered a lost
colony of Spanish and Brazilian rub
ber collectors who, after their white
employers had abandoned them to
the jungle, had intermarried with
1 the native Indians to form a new
, colony, the Pinquins.
Interims
In the interims between travels,
Fejos writes, lectures, advises in mo
j tion picture production. At the pres
ent time he is director of the Viking
Foundation, prominent anthropolo
gical organization in New York City.
Equipped with a wealth of ex
! amples, humorous and tragic, and a
repertoire of physical expression,
perhaps coming from long years of
explaining his presence to jungle
audiences, Fejos constantly spot
lights two points—that native peoples
j are human in their reactions and will
i respond favorably to treatment as
humans, and that they must be ap
j proached with an understanding of
I native customs, and a "native" view
