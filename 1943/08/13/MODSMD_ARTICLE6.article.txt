# Long Chow Lines To Disappear Soon
##

The seemingly endless lines of
hungry soldiers waiting their turn
for chow should disappear in about
two months.
Since the inauguration of the
Army Specialized Training Program
on campus every soldier has been fed
at Eneina Commons. However, in
October the old dining room at Bran
ner Hall will be activated and much
of the breadline will be thinned.
Although it is not yet decided who
shall use which mess hall, it is prob
able that those companies living in
Toyon and Branner halls will use the
new dining room and those com
panies occupying Encina and Sequoia
halls will continue to eat at the
Commons.
