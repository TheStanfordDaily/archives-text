# Deans Welcome New Men, Women
## 
### 
A very hearty welcome to both
civilian and Army students this Au
tumn Quarter. We have an interest
ing and challenging year ahead of
us. For it we shall need courage and
intelligence to put first things first,
understanding that old customs and
privileges, however good, may have
to be set aside under present condi
tions, and cheerful cooperation with
the University and Army officials
and with fellow students in making
and accepting new patterns for cam
pus life,
A good motto for us all is a state
ment made by Mrs. Stanford when
years ago she was addressing the
Board of Trustees: "Let us not be
afraid to outgrow old thoughts and

ways, and dare to think on new lines
as to the future of the work under
our care."

a stable position in this program.
The academic curriculum, the so
cial calendar, the activity schedule—
each has been planned so that it will
haye the greatest meaning to both
civilian and military students. There
is real meat here for you to chew.
To get the most out of your ex

periences on the campus and to play
your patriotic part, you must plan

The exigencies of war require your
full cooperation in order that the
facilities of the University may run
smoothly and for the benefit of all.
This is a year of work and then
more work. It is a challenge to us
all—a challenge which I am sure all
will meet with enthusiasm, with op
timism. It is our investment in a
better future.
I am glad to welcome you to this

understanding that old customs and
privileges, however good, may have
to be set aside under present condi
tions, and cheerful cooperation with
the University and Army officials
and with fellow students in making
and accepting new patterns for cam
pus life,
A good motto for us all is a state
ment made by Mrs. Stanford when
years ago she was addressing the
Board of Trustees: "Let us not be
afraid to outgrow old thoughts and

ways, and dare to think on new lines
as to the future of the work under
our care."

Like industry, educational insti
tutions are now completely convert
ed and geared to the war effort and
the reconstruction period that will
, follow. Beginning with the Autumn
Quarter, Stanford will have attained
a stable position in this program.
The academic curriculum, the so
cial calendar, the activity schedule—
each has been planned so that it will
haye the greatest meaning to both
civilian and military students. There
is real meat here for you to chew.
To get the most out of your ex

periences on the campus and to play
your patriotic part, you must plan
wisely and use your time efficiently.
The exigencies of war require your
full cooperation in order that the
facilities of the University may run
smoothly and for the benefit of all.
This is a year of work and then
more work. It is a challenge to us
all—a challenge which I am sure all
will meet with enthusiasm, with op
timism. It is our investment in a
better future.
I am glad to welcome you to this
kind of a busy life at Stanford. Good
luck to all of you—new students, old
students, soldiers, men and women.
JOHN W. BUNN,
Dean of Men.
