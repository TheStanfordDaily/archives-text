# Professor Describes Poisonous Fish
## 
### 
To protect soldiers and sailors who
might lie tempted to cat those pretty
fish they catch in the South Seas, Dr.
Albert W. Herre, curator of ichthy
ology at Stanford, has prepared
pamphlets on poisonous and venom
ous fish for the Army and Navy to
distribute to their men.
Members of the "puffer" family
are the commonest among the poison
ous fish, and some can cause death
in a few hours, Dr. Herre said. The
Polynesian name for one species
means "sudden death."
The puffer can be identified by its
scaleless skin and the minute spines
which cover its body. In the porcu
pine fish the spines stick out all over
like a pincushion when the fish is in
flated.
Dangerous Eating
Also dangerous for eating, although
not fatal, are the trigger-fish and the
cow-fish, which has a box-like armor
of bony scales.
The sailor who is fishing for his
dinner must remember also that
some fish are poisonous only during
the breeding season and others con
centrate their poison in a specific or
gan. Dr. Herre advises, however,
that all doubtful cases be left strictly
alone.
The venomous fishes which are
found in South Pacific waters are
among the most dangerous of any
animals, Dr. Herre said. Most of
them are members of the Scorpae
nidae family, and after the poison
glands have been removed, are good
eating.
Poison Lump Fish
The most poisonous member of the
family is the lump fish, so called be
cause it looks like a rock. Its harm
less exterior hides 12 sharp spines,
each with two poison glands, and if
a person should step on it and get
a full charge of venom, he would die
in one to four hours in great pain,
Dr. Herre said. The venom impairs
breathing and circulation, as well as
breaking down tissues around the
wound.
Many other members of the family
are brightly patterned in beautiful
colors. Others can change their color
to match their surroundings. To
complete their disguise, their spines
are hidden in waving fiesh that looks
much like seaweed, and their body is
covered with protrusions and horns
that resemble algae growing on a

rock. Some members are hardly an
inch long.
Cautions Fishermen
While the fish make good eating,
Dr. Herre cautions fishermen never
to touch them with bare hands until
they are absolutely sure they are
dead. s
Other venomous fish that the sailor
in Melanesian or Polynesian waters
must look out for are the stinging
catfish and several kinds of sting
ray. The latter may cause a deep
and painful wound, but it is not fatal.
Now that he has cautioned soldiers
and sailors on Pacific duty about the
fish they must not touch or eat, Dr.
Herre is preparing a pamphlet on the
most important edible fishes.
Dr. Herre was chief of the bureau
of fisheries in the Philippine Islands
from 1920 to 1928, and since then has
made five expeditions to Malaya,
Micronesia, and other South Pacific
points.

animals, Dr. Herre said. Most of
them are members of the Scorpae
nidae family, and after the poison
glands have been removed, are good
eating.
Poison Lump Fish
The most poisonous member of the
family is the lump fish, so called be
cause it looks like a rock. Its harm
less exterior hides 12 sharp spines,
each with two poison glands, and if
a person should step on it and get
a full charge of venom, he would die
in one to four hours in great pain,
Dr. Herre said. The venom impairs
breathing and circulation, as well as
breaking down tissues around the
wound.
Many other members of the family
are brightly patterned in beautiful
colors. Others can change their color
to match their surroundings. To
complete their disguise, their spines
are hidden in waving fiesh that looks
much like seaweed, and their body is
covered with protrusions and horns
that resemble algae growing on a

rock. Some members are hardly an
inch long.
Cautions Fishermen
While the fish make good eating,
Dr. Herre cautions fishermen never
to touch them with bare hands until
they are absolutely sure they are
dead. s
Other venomous fish that the sailor
in Melanesian or Polynesian waters
must look out for are the stinging
catfish and several kinds of sting
ray. The latter may cause a deep
and painful wound, but it is not fatal.
Now that he has cautioned soldiers
and sailors on Pacific duty about the
fish they must not touch or eat, Dr.
Herre is preparing a pamphlet on the
most important edible fishes.
Dr. Herre was chief of the bureau
of fisheries in the Philippine Islands
from 1920 to 1928, and since then has
made five expeditions to Malaya,
Micronesia, and other South Pacific
points.
To protect soldiers and sailors who
might lie tempted to cat those pretty
fish they catch in the South Seas, Dr.
Albert W. Herre, curator of ichthy
ology at Stanford, has prepared
pamphlets on poisonous and venom
ous fish for the Army and Navy to
distribute to their men.
Members of the "puffer" family
are the commonest among the poison
ous fish, and some can cause death
in a few hours, Dr. Herre said. The
Polynesian name for one species
means "sudden death."
The puffer can be identified by its
scaleless skin and the minute spines
which cover its body. In the porcu
pine fish the spines stick out all over
like a pincushion when the fish is in
flated.
Dangerous Eating
Also dangerous for eating, although
not fatal, are the trigger-fish and the
cow-fish, which has a box-like armor
of bony scales.
The sailor who is fishing for his
dinner must remember also that
some fish are poisonous only during
the breeding season and others con
centrate their poison in a specific or
gan. Dr. Herre advises, however,
that all doubtful cases be left strictly
alone.
