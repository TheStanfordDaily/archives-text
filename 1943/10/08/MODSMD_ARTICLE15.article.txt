# Quartermaster School Opens
## 
### 
A second Army Quartermaster
Corps school will open in the Stan
ford Graduate School of Business
Oct. 11, with most of the enrollees
men who completed the first quar
termaster course last fall.
Approximately 60 men will take
the third and fourth quarters of the
regular business school course and
will be in classes with the civilian
students, Dean J. Hugh Jackson of
the Graduate School of Business an
nounced.
After completing the first two
quarters of the business course at
Stanford, or another university, last
Autumn and Winter quarters, the
quartermaster school was sent to
Fort Warren in Wyoming for tech
nical training. On completion of the
second academic course, they will be
commissioned and assigned to active
duty, Dean Jackson said.
Present plans for housing the new
school are to distribute the men
among the ASTP companies. They
will act as administrative officers and
perform regular quartermaster du
ties.
More than 40 of the enrollees had
arrived on the campus by the first of
the week, and the rest were expected
from Sacramento soon. They are ex
pected to be here until April.
