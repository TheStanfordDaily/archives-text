# ASSU Heads Extend Welcome To Incoming Men, Women
## 
### 
WELCOME, STANFORD MEN
AND WOMEN:
This Fall Quarter and in the quar
ters to come, we want you students
to become an integral part of Stan
ford life. In these war times, the
Stanford Family will be more closely
drawn together than ever before.
Class distinctions have been largely
wiped out; and we predict that you
"frosh" will ripen into "old Stan
ford ites" sooner than any of your
petrified predecessors!
And this is all for the best. No
longer will the lowly "frosh" imitate
the upperclassman by following in
his footsteps up a traditional ladder
of college activities. Speaking for
both the academic and extra curri
cula fields, we old students are as
fresh to the wartime challenge for
progressive change as you are. We
want to work with you to build a
better Stanford!
JANET McCLANAHAN.
ASSU President.

TO THE FRESHMEN:
Although war has come and many
of the civilian men have gone, stu
dent activities at Stanford will go on
forever, with your help. To you, the
incoming freshmen, we extend not
only a sincere welcome, but an earn
est invitation to carry on student
government until normal times re
turn.
By looking at the publications
staffs, the music and drama per
formers, and the campus committee
workers, you can see there is no
shortage of opportunities for par
ticipation. Arranging a social pro
gram for the soldiers and civilians on
campus is a big project in itself, one
for enthusiastic students.
During your first weeks on the
Farm, various activities will an
nounce tryouts for all interested
students. They, like Uncle Sam. want
you. And they offer much in ex
perience, in friendships, and in
knowing Stanford.
PEGGY ROOTIIE,
ASSU Vice-President.
