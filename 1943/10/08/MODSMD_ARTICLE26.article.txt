# The 						Stanford Way
## 
### AN EDITORIAL 
This is a special editorial because it is directed to just you,
the new Stanford men and women. It is for you who have
heard that honor plays a vital role in the lives of each student
here—you will learn that Stanford's unique Honor Code is a
privilege and a responsibility that binds the Stanford Family
together in mutual trust and self respect.
We are not going to preach adherence to the Honor Code.
We want you to know exactly what it means to us. Then we
are sure you will live up to it in the best way you can.
Materially the Honor Code insures unproctored examina
tions and the lack of other steps by the University to prevent
student dishonesty.
But the Honor Code means more to us that these freedoms.
It is proof of confidence in us as college adults. It is a manifesta
tion of faith in the honor of Stanford students. It means that
we are people to be trusted.
There is little that is more important than faith when people
are working together. The Honor Code is a guarantee of faith
and freedom, of pride, and honesty. It is a manifestation of
the feeling that we, simply by practicing honor and accepting
its responsibility, may yet preserve the ideal of man's humanity
to man.
To achieve this end, the Honor Code is an undertaking of
students, individually and collectively, that we will not give
or receive aid in examinations, class work, the preparation of
reports, and that we will obey the rules of the Library. The
Honor Code contract states that each student will do his share
and take an active part in seeing to it that others obey the
spirit and letter of the Code.
Now traditions are dying at Stanford. The war has killed
some of the time-honored practices of students. But the Honor
Code, always the biggest and most important tradition, must
not die. We who know and appreciate it, and you who are
being introduced to it, must realize its worth and keep it firm.
Cherish the Honor Code, and it will not only be Stanford's
to keep, it will be yours for life.—Jane Glasson
