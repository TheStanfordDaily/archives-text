### 
Tryouts for positions on The Daily
staff will begin October 25. according
to Start Editor Barbara Stevens. The
first tryoutee meeting will be held in
Room 8 of the Journalism Building,
at which time the editor, Jane Glas
son, will welcome newcomers to the
staff and Miss Stevens will explain
the tryout system.
The tryout period will last two
weeks and at the end of this time edi
torial board will make permanent
appointments to the staff. Positions j
are open for copyreaders, reporters,
and cub reporters.
Tryoutees are required to work on ;
the copy desk five hours a week,
cover stories, and attend tryoutee
meetings. During these meetings,
members of the editorial board in
struct the tryoutees in copyreading,
proofreading, headline writing, news
and feature writing, and Daily style.
No previous experience on a news
paper is necessary, and both freshmen
and returning undergraduates are
welcome to try out for a staff posi- j
tion, according to Miss Stevens.
"In addition to earning a position j
on the paper, trying out for The )
Daily is one way of meeting upper
classmen and members of your own
class. The Stanford War Board has
also decided that Daily wrok is es- '
sential and that it is to be counted as j
war work, thereby filling your two
hours a week pledge," says Miss
Stevens.
