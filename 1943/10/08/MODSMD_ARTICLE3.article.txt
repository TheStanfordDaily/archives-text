# ENROLLMENT
## 2,000 Civilians To Register 
### 
According to the Registrar's Of
fice, approximately 2,000 civilian
students are expected to register for
Fall Quarter, from 375 to 400 being
incoming freshmen.
Among the 2,000 civilians will be
an estimated 1,300 women and 700
men. The men and women are ex
pected to be equally divided in the
incoming freshman class.
Registration will be slightly over
half of last Fall Quarter's enrollment
of 3,(>50, and about 800 less than the
2,815 enrollment of last Spring Quar
ter.
On the other hand, the figures of
the Dean of Men's office are more
skeptical, expecting only about 400
undergraduate civilian men and
about 140 new freshman men. This
would give the women a slightly
over three-to-one ration over the
men. However, including the ap
proximately 3,000 soldiers stationed
on the campus, the ration would be
a little over two and one-half to one
in favor of the men.
According to Dr. Karl M. Cowdery,
associate registrar, men who will
have completed their pre-medicine
requirements in two years and have
been accepted into a school of medi
cine before they turn 18 are eligible
for draft deferment. Students major
ing in engineering, physical sciences,
and bacteriology, who can graduate
within 24 months after they register
for the draft, are also eligible for de
ferments.
