# Three Dorms Will House Frosh Women
## 
### 
Stanford women of '47 take resi
dence this week in Roble Hall, Ven
tura, and part of Lagunita. No longer
is the famed Roble Hall the exclusive
hall for frosh women; the numbers
of freshman women have grown in
such proportion in the last two years
that Roble can no longer hold all of
the incoming class.
In the days of the 500, all Stanford
women lived in what is now Sequoia
Hall and in sorority houses. As the
enrollment of women at Stanford
grew, so did the women's halls.
Stanford is a residence University
and through its University halls it
has enabled every student to make
his choice between hall and row.
After Lagunita was built in 1934,
Roble became the traditional hall for
freshman women just as Encina was
the traditional hall for frosh men.
During their first year at Stanford,
all Lower Division women lived in
Roble, and at the beginning of their
second year, they ordinarily begin
living in their permanent campus
home, whether it be one of the nine
sororities or one of the dormitories.
Today frosh women take residence
in three halls for their first year at
the Farm.
