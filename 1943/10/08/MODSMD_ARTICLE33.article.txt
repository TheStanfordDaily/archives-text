## 
### Pat Clary 
Close to 3,000 soldier-students, in
cluding members of Army Special
ized Training Units, and advanced
ROTC men awaiting assignment to
officer candidate schools, will be sta
tioned at Stanford Fall Quarter, ac
cording to Col. John R. Eden.
Colonel Eden is professor of mili
tary science and tactics and com
mandant of all military units at
Stanford, replacing Col. Harry B.
Allen, who went on terminal leave
Oct. 1.
Awaiting vacancies in officer can
didate schools, 150 former Stanford
men who were members of advanced
ROTC units have been returned to
the campus and will continue with
their academic work under the spon
sorship of the ASTP until they are
called.
Stanford Men
These men, who were Stanford
juniors or seniors in their third or
fourth year of reserve military train
ing when they were called to active
duty last April, have been assigned
among all the companies.
In a schedule synchronized with
the civilian program, all ASTP stu
dents except those in psychology will
begin a new term Oct. 11. The psy
chology course will finish Oct. 30,
ad the students will not be replaced,
Colonel Eden said.
Beside the personnel psychology
students, the AST program includes
basic engineering, the largest single
group, advanced engineering, Far
Eastern and European Area and Lan
guage studies, and pre-medicine.
Not included in the specialized
training program are other and
smaller Army units which also be
gin classes Oct. 11. A few advanced
ROTC men continuing academic
work, GO advanced Quartermaster
Corps students in the Graduate
School of Business, 20 VV'ACs study
ing physical therapy, and a Civilian
Allans Training School composed
entirely of commissioned officers.
Most ol the 1,325 basic engineering
students are included in the first
battalion, Companies A, B. C, and D,
are housed in Encina, former fresh
man men's hall. The rest are in
Company L and are housed in Se
quoia Hall.
All of the soldier-students study
ing advanced engineering and Euro

pean areas and languages are in the
second battalion, Companies E, F, G.
! and H, and are housed in Branner
j and Toyon Halls.
Language Groups
In order to house the rest of the
men in the Far Eastern Area and
Language group and some psychol
ogy students, the Army has taken
over eight fraternity houses. Mem
bers of Company I are housed in
Roosevelt, Taylor, Pierce, and John
son halls (formerly the Zeta Psi,
Kappa Alpha, Phi Delta Theta, and
Phi Kappa Sigma fraternity houses
respectively.)
i The language students in Company
j K are in Van Buren, Harrison, and
| Taft halls (the Delta Chi, Theta
| Delta Chi, and Delta Kappa Epsilon
j fraternities); and the psychology
j students are in Grant Hall (the Phi
Sigma Kappa fraternity).
Included in the engineering, psy
chology. and advanced ROTC stu
! dents in Company L, in Sequoia
Hall, are 200 ASTP reserves, stu
dents who are under 18 and there
fore cannot be put on active duty.
They will do the same work as the
other soldier-students, but will not
he in uniform.
At the end of the quarter in which
they reach their 18th birthday, they
will be sent for 13 weeks' basic train
ing, and then will return to some
university to complete their special
' ized training program.
In order to give the specialized
training students, who are all pro
j spective commissioned or non-com
missioned officers, practice in leader
ship, experience in the management
! of the companies is given to cadet
officers and non-coms.
The highest cadet officer is com
pany commander. No inter-company
j cadet officers have been established,
! Colonel Eden said, because the pri
mary emphasis in the specialized
; training program is on the academic
; work, not on the Army discipline.
On Active Duty
Since the specialized training pro
gram began at Stanford last spring,
several advanced foreign area and
language students have been judged
by the faculty to be well prepared
and have been sent on active duty.
As other groups of students finish
the highest term in their course,

j they also will be sent on active duty
I and will be replaced.
The STAR unit, a group of soldiers
| sent to Stanford for testing and for
i assignment to specialized training
units in relation to their abilities,
was closed at Stanford this summer,
and its members were replaced by
specialized training students.
The specialized training program
was established by the Army to
j give non-commissioned men college
training in specific fields. Stanford's
registrar, Dr. J. Pearce Mitchell, an
nounced this summer that soldier
students would be given transcripts
of credit to apply toward graduation
j from any university on satisfactory
i completion of their course.
