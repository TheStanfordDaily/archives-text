# Classes Held On Swing Shift
## 
### 
In order to utilize the University
to its fullest capacity, Stanford
classes next quarter have been sched
uled from 8 o'clock in the morning
to 7 o'clock at night, Registrar J.
Pearce Mitchell announced when the
preliminary time schedule was pub
lished.
Heavier class schedules carried
both by civilian students and by
members of Army Specialized Train
ing Units made the "swing shift"
classes necessary by increasing the
load on the available classrooms, Dr.
Mitchell said.
Late afternoon and evening classes
have been scheduled especially in
the schools of Humanities and Social
Sciences, since the large lecture
rooms are needed for classes all day
long.
