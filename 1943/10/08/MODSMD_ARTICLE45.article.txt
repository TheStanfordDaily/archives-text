# Card Women Aid in War Work To Relieve Labor Shortage
## 
### 
To aid the war effort and relieve
the labor shortage on campus, Stan
ford women each quarter pledge
themselves to do at least eight hours
of war work a month.
This plan, whereby each Farm
woman signs a pledge card to con
tribute & minimum of two hours a
week toward eliminating the labor
shortages, was inaugurated last
Spring Quarter by Betty May Hale,
War Board coordinator.
Pledge cards are distributed by
the War Board auxiliary representa
tives in each living group. On these
cards, each woman lists her prefer
ence for war work and the hours
which she is free to work. The War
Board then has a permanent file of
available workers and means for
keeping a record of hours actually
worked.
War Work Defined
War work includes any class or
activity which helps Stanford women
prepare for, contribute to, or di
rectly participate in any phase of the
present emergency.
Hours spent at Red Cross surgical
dressing room rolling bandages, at
Red Cross courses, such as Motor

Corps and Nurses' Aides, USO work,
such as entertaining at the Hospi
tality house in Palo Alto or faculty
entertainment on campus. and
courses in Civilian Defense are
counted.
Hours spent in volunteer work at
the War Board office, on committee
work dealing with the stamp and
bond drive, salvage collections, the
blood bank, and posters are con
sidered war work.
Relieve Labor Shortage
Any work which relieves the local
labor shortage is also counted. This
includes hashing jobs, clerical work
for any of the departments or asso
ciations, and care of children.
''With the labor shortage and need
for war work, the best use must be
made of all available workers. Ev
eryone wants more workers, but they
want workers who are steady. The
eight-hour-a-month program is de
signed to remedy this situation," says
Miss Hale.
"When the women sign up fpr war
work in this manner, it guarantees
steady workers and thus relieves the
problem. This system also gives each
girl an opportunity to contribute di
rectly to the war effort," she added.
