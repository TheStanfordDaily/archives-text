# USC Tops Conference In Football
## 
### Pvt. Late Williams 
Now that Stanford has thrown in
the towel as far as football at the
Farm goes, we might as well forget
our failure to field a team and re
member it only as a fond memory.
Superficially, however, we're still
in the ball game. Whether it's Cali
fornia or UCLA playing, a check of
the first string, and the substitutions,
shows that the nucleus of both clubs
are Stanford men.
At the Bruin's Westwood camp,
three of the starters, and sometimes
four, are former Indian gridders. Bob
Andrews leads the Bruin Q-T for
mation at quarterback, and at an end
and guard spot are Dave Brown and
Bob Rohrer, respectively. Hal Hol
man on last year's frosh team with
Rohrer, sometimes breaks into the
halfback post.
Indians at Cal
At the Cal campus. Stub Allison
has no less than seven former Stan
ford athletes, and perhaps more, that
form the basis of his team. Fred
Boensch, Jim Cox, Dick Munroe,
George Rasmussen, Dick Madigan,
Bill Nourse, and their ace fullback,
Bill Joslyn.
Without the benefit of any former
Stanford men, but with a galaxy of
stars from which to draw, is what
shapes up to be the class of the Pa
cific Coast, the University of South
ern California.
The Trojans, with a line that hits
a 217-pound mark, and a backfield
that boasts both power and speed, is
definitely the team to beat in western
collegiate circles.
I SC Wallops UCLA
We caught the USC-UCLA opener
at the Coliseum September 25, in
which the final score was a lopsided
20 to 0 affair with Jeff Cravath's men
having it their own way throughout
the contest. The final score isn't the
story. It could as easily of been 40
to 0.
In their 7 to 0 win over Cal at
Berkeley last Saturday, it was only
a case of fumblitis and a rough after
noon with the officials that held
down the score.
Troy's first-string line looks like
one of the best in the country, and
their pass defense seems to be a
little better than in pasl years.
McCardlc Great Back
Mickey McCardle, who is the ball
handler in their "T" formation is one
of the great backs of the country.
His passes this year have continually
hit their mark, and when he packs
the ball, he's always dangerous. Add
to McCardle, Howie Callanan, Eddie
Saenz, and either Duane Whitehead
or Chuck Page, who was out of the
Bear game because of injuries, and
you've got a tremendous backfield.
Sometimes as you watch McCardle
sneak away for a long gain, you have
the feeling that some of the potential
offensive power is being lost as
Mickey carries the ball only on oc
casional plays off the "T."
Cravath Loses Men
Occasionally one also wonders why
Cravath keeps pulling the first string
out of the game after having ac
quired only a seven or so point lead.
The logical answer to this well be
seen very shortly when several of
the Trojan's key men, including Mc-
Cardle, will leave the field for the
last time this year. Under Navy
specifications these men will have
completed their education, and will
thereby go onto active duty.
Cravath has seen this time coming,
and it adds up to the fact that he is
trying to train adequately his re
maining men to handle first string
duty without the loss of too much
power.
We will see what will happen to the
Trojans after their game with USC.
From there on in it will be a Trojan
team of less adeptness, facing op
ponents with more punch than any
they have yet faced.
If California hangs on to most of
their men, the second meeting be
tween these two teams ought to be
a herculean battle. Come what may,
we'll stick with the Trojans.

they have yet faced.
If California hangs on to most of
their men, the second meeting be
tween these two teams ought to be
a herculean battle. Come what may,
we'll stick with the Trojans.
Now that Stanford has thrown in
the towel as far as football at the
Farm goes, we might as well forget
our failure to field a team and re
member it only as a fond memory.
Superficially, however, we're still
in the ball game. Whether it's Cali
fornia or UCLA playing, a check of
the first string, and the substitutions,
shows that the nucleus of both clubs
are Stanford men.
At the Bruin's Westwood camp,
three of the starters, and sometimes
four, are former Indian gridders. Bob
Andrews leads the Bruin Q-T for
mation at quarterback, and at an end
and guard spot are Dave Brown and
Bob Rohrer, respectively. Hal Hol
man on last year's frosh team with
Rohrer, sometimes breaks into the
halfback post.
Indians at Cal
At the Cal campus. Stub Allison
has no less than seven former Stan
ford athletes, and perhaps more, that
form the basis of his team. Fred
Boensch, Jim Cox, Dick Munroe,
George Rasmussen, Dick Madigan,
Bill Nourse, and their ace fullback,
Bill Joslyn.
Without the benefit of any former
Stanford men, but with a galaxy of
stars from which to draw, is what
shapes up to be the class of the Pa
cific Coast, the University of South
ern California.
The Trojans, with a line that hits
a 217-pound mark, and a backfield
that boasts both power and speed, is
definitely the team to beat in western
collegiate circles.
I SC Wallops UCLA
We caught the USC-UCLA opener
at the Coliseum September 25, in
which the final score was a lopsided
20 to 0 affair with Jeff Cravath's men
having it their own way throughout
the contest. The final score isn't the
story. It could as easily of been 40
to 0.
In their 7 to 0 win over Cal at
Berkeley last Saturday, it was only
a case of fumblitis and a rough after
noon with the officials that held
down the score.
Troy's first-string line looks like
one of the best in the country, and
their pass defense seems to be a
little better than in pasl years.
McCardlc Great Back
Mickey McCardle, who is the ball
handler in their "T" formation is one
of the great backs of the country.
His passes this year have continually
hit their mark, and when he packs
the ball, he's always dangerous. Add
to McCardle, Howie Callanan, Eddie
Saenz, and either Duane Whitehead
or Chuck Page, who was out of the
Bear game because of injuries, and
you've got a tremendous backfield.
Sometimes as you watch McCardle
sneak away for a long gain, you have
the feeling that some of the potential
offensive power is being lost as
Mickey carries the ball only on oc
casional plays off the "T."
Cravath Loses Men
Occasionally one also wonders why
Cravath keeps pulling the first string
out of the game after having ac
quired only a seven or so point lead.
The logical answer to this well be
seen very shortly when several of
the Trojan's key men, including Mc-
Cardle, will leave the field for the
last time this year. Under Navy
specifications these men will have
completed their education, and will
thereby go onto active duty.
Cravath has seen this time coming,
and it adds up to the fact that he is
trying to train adequately his re
maining men to handle first string
duty without the loss of too much
power.
We will see what will happen to the
Trojans after their game with USC.
From there on in it will be a Trojan
team of less adeptness, facing op
ponents with more punch than any
they have yet faced.

power.
We will see what will happen to the
Trojans after their game with USC.
From there on in it will be a Trojan
team of less adeptness, facing op
ponents with more punch than any
they have yet faced.
If California hangs on to most of
their men, the second meeting be
tween these two teams ought to be
a herculean battle. Come what may,
we'll stick with the Trojans.
Now that Stanford has thrown in
the towel as far as football at the
Farm goes, we might as well forget
our failure to field a team and re
member it only as a fond memory.
Superficially, however, we're still
in the ball game. Whether it's Cali
fornia or UCLA playing, a check of
the first string, and the substitutions,
shows that the nucleus of both clubs
are Stanford men.
At the Bruin's Westwood camp,
three of the starters, and sometimes
four, are former Indian gridders. Bob
Andrews leads the Bruin Q-T for
mation at quarterback, and at an end
and guard spot are Dave Brown and
Bob Rohrer, respectively. Hal Hol
man on last year's frosh team with
Rohrer, sometimes breaks into the
halfback post.
Indians at Cal
At the Cal campus. Stub Allison
has no less than seven former Stan
ford athletes, and perhaps more, that
form the basis of his team. Fred
Boensch, Jim Cox, Dick Munroe,
George Rasmussen, Dick Madigan,
Bill Nourse, and their ace fullback,
Bill Joslyn.
Without the benefit of any former
Stanford men, but with a galaxy of
stars from which to draw, is what
shapes up to be the class of the Pa
cific Coast, the University of South
ern California.
The Trojans, with a line that hits
a 217-pound mark, and a backfield
that boasts both power and speed, is
definitely the team to beat in western
collegiate circles.
I SC Wallops UCLA
We caught the USC-UCLA opener
at the Coliseum September 25, in
which the final score was a lopsided
20 to 0 affair with Jeff Cravath's men
having it their own way throughout
the contest. The final score isn't the
story. It could as easily of been 40
to 0.
In their 7 to 0 win over Cal at
Berkeley last Saturday, it was only
a case of fumblitis and a rough after
noon with the officials that held
down the score.
Troy's first-string line looks like
one of the best in the country, and
their pass defense seems to be a
little better than in pasl years.
McCardlc Great Back
Mickey McCardle, who is the ball
handler in their "T" formation is one
of the great backs of the country.
His passes this year have continually
hit their mark, and when he packs
the ball, he's always dangerous. Add
to McCardle, Howie Callanan, Eddie
Saenz, and either Duane Whitehead
or Chuck Page, who was out of the
Bear game because of injuries, and
you've got a tremendous backfield.
Sometimes as you watch McCardle
sneak away for a long gain, you have
the feeling that some of the potential
offensive power is being lost as
Mickey carries the ball only on oc
casional plays off the "T."
Cravath Loses Men
Occasionally one also wonders why
Cravath keeps pulling the first string
out of the game after having ac
quired only a seven or so point lead.
The logical answer to this well be
seen very shortly when several of
the Trojan's key men, including Mc-
Cardle, will leave the field for the
last time this year. Under Navy
specifications these men will have
completed their education, and will
thereby go onto active duty.
Cravath has seen this time coming,
and it adds up to the fact that he is
trying to train adequately his re
maining men to handle first string
duty without the loss of too much
power.
We will see what will happen to the
Trojans after their game with USC.
From there on in it will be a Trojan
team of less adeptness, facing op
ponents with more punch than any
they have yet faced.
If California hangs on to most of
their men, the second meeting be
tween these two teams ought to be
a herculean battle. Come what may,
we'll stick with the Trojans.
