# Langendorf Picks Football Results
## 
### 
These forecasts are the first of a
series for football games of the 1943
season. Without further ado, here is
edition number one of Langendorf's
Follies:
College of Pacific over California
by six. One of the closest games of
the day. COP proved itself in de
feating St. Mary's Prc-Flight.
Southern California over St.
Mary's Pre-Flight by six. but don't
count on it. Pre-Flight now has
Bruce Smith, while USC will suf
fer the loss of Micky McCardle.
Del Monte Prc-Flight over
Plcasanton Navy by at least 0. A
slaughter.
Coast Guard over USF by 13. A
victory at last.
Michigan over Notre Dame by
one in a high scoring battle to the
finish between the top two of the
nation. Daley, Hirsh & Co. should
squeeze through.
Navy over Duke by seven and
don't ask why.
