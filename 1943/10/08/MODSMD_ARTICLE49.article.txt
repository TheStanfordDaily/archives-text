# Will Stanford Give Up Other Sports As Well As Football?
## 
### Don Langendorf 
Stanford has given up football as
everyone knows by now. But will
Stanford participate with other col
leges and service teams in basketball,
track and baseball? That is what
everyone living in this area wishes
to know.
By press time, we weren't able to
know whether we had thrown in the
towel in basketball as we had in
football. When we talked with A 1
Masters, graduate manager, on Tues
day, he said that he was waiting
word from President Donald B.
Tresidder as to how the Farm stands
in this winter sport. Masters was
very pessimistic about sports at
Stanford. Although in favor of inter
collegiate sports, Masters doesn't see
how it is possible for Stanford, with
nothing to draw on but 17 year olds
and 4-F's, to face teams like Del

Monte, USC, California, and others
without being massacred at every
turn. By the time you read this, it is
possible that the verdict will be in.
We talked with Masters on the
possibility of fielding a Frosh team in
all sports in order to play high
schools on the Peninsula, in San
Francisco, and in the East Bay.
Masters was dubious, but we went
into the idea further by finding out
how many men on campus are eli
gible to participate in any such un
dertaking.
There are 123 new men coming to
Stanford for Fall Quarter. Left over
from those entering in Summer
Quarter are 131 more. In all, we
would have approximately 254 men
to draw from if we shoud happen to
end up with a Freshman team. These
figures are based on room reserva
tions from the Dean of Men's office.
