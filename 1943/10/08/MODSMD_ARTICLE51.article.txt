# Del Monte Fields Coast Powerhouse
## 
### Don Langendorf 
With no team of its own to root
for, interest of Stanford students will
center around football as played by
our neighbors, civilian and service
alike.
So far this season, we have viewed
six games and eight teams. We have
seen every major team in the state
outside of UCLA and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight. From what we've heard, we
haven't missed much.
By far the best team on the coast
is Del Monte Pre-Flight. Their of
ficer team can score anytime, any
where, at will. They have played
twice, and won twice. Against Coast
Guard they were marvelous. Coast
Guard was lucky enough to score s
touchdown against them, insulting
the officers.
On the second play after the Coast.
Guard kick-off, Del Monte sprung
Parker Hall loose off tackle for 72
yards and a touchdown. The next;
chance on offense that Del Monte l
had, Paul Christman threw a perfect
pass to Len Eshmont, good for 5G
yards and another score. That was
convincing enough that they could
score at will.
Del Monte Wins
Del Monte proved themselves
again Sunday against St. Mary's
With all the breaks going against,
them, Del Monte erased a seven
point deficit to come out victorious
33-7. With the breaks going the other
way, the score would be nearer 60
points. The outstanding play of the
game was Len Eshmont's 81-yard
run from punt formation through tht
entire opposition for a touchdown,
Within two minutes after that, Park
er Hall did a repeat of the previous,
week by going some 60 yards oft
tackle for another touchdown.
Del Monte should take every tean
they play including Southern Cali
fornia.
Showing just enough to win, Col
lege of Pacific trounced the Coast,
Guard 14 to 7. They looked like i;
good ball club and proved they were
in following weeks by defeating both
St. Mary's Pre-Flight and UCLA
Their tussle with California next:
Saturday should test their capabili
ties. If Johnny Podesto should gev
injured, COP is lost, for he is the
team.
Cal Has Fair Team
Contrary to what you may have
heard, the California Bears are still
operating as usual with their regu«
lar down-the-middle type of play.
The Bears have the best line Stan
ford could give them. (Just think of
what a marvelous team Stanford
would have in peace time —Joslyn,
I Boensch, Cox, Nourse, Hachten, An
drews, Brown, and so many more.)
