# Del Monte Fields Coast Powerhouse
## 
### Don Langendorf 
With no team of its own to root
for, interest of Stanford students will
center around football as played by
our neighbors, civilian and service
alike.
So far this season, we have viewed
six games and eight teams. We have
seen every major team in the state
outside of UCLA and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight. From what we've heard, we
haven't missed much.
By far the best team on the coast
is Del Monte Pre-Flight. Their of
ficer team can score anytime, any
where, at will. They have played
twice, and won twice. Against Coast
Guard they were marvelous. Coast
Guard was lucky enough to score s
touchdown against them, insulting
the officers.
On the second play after the Coast.
Guard kick-off, Del Monte sprung
Parker Hall loose off tackle for 72
yards and a touchdown. The next;
chance on offense that Del Monte l
had, Paul Christman threw a perfect
pass to Len Eshmont, good for 5G
yards and another score. That was
convincing enough that they could
score at will.
Del Monte Wins
Del Monte proved themselves
again Sunday against St. Mary's
With all the breaks going against,
them, Del Monte erased a seven
point deficit to come out victorious
33-7. With the breaks going the other
way, the score would be nearer 60
points. The outstanding play of the
game was Len Eshmont's 81-yard
run from punt formation through tht
entire opposition for a touchdown,
Within two minutes after that, Park
er Hall did a repeat of the previous,
week by going some 60 yards oft
tackle for another touchdown.
Del Monte should take every tean
they play including Southern Cali
fornia.
Showing just enough to win, Col
lege of Pacific trounced the Coast,
Guard 14 to 7. They looked like i;
good ball club and proved they were
in following weeks by defeating both
St. Mary's Pre-Flight and UCLA
Their tussle with California next:
Saturday should test their capabili
ties. If Johnny Podesto should gev
injured, COP is lost, for he is the
team.
Cal Has Fair Team
Contrary to what you may have
heard, the California Bears are still
operating as usual with their regu«
lar down-the-middle type of play.
The Bears have the best line Stan
ford could give them. (Just think of
what a marvelous team Stanford
would have in peace time —Joslyn,
I Boensch, Cox, Nourse, Hachten, An
drews, Brown, and so many more.)
Ait Honnegger has been playing
much better than anyone expected.
Bill Joslyn has been throwing good
passes. With their style of play, Cal
will lose several more games. The
Bears will lose to USC, Del Monte,
and possibly College of Pacific.
Several things came to our atten
tion during the UC-USC battle last
Saturday. Cal can play marvelous
football when in her own territory.
It pays off, though, when she can
gain in her opponent's land. South
ern Cal will lose several games be
cause of failure to realize scoring
opportunities when they are staring
her in the face. The Trojans are not
the team the pre-season experts ex
pected. Though they may have the
best team in collegiate circles west of
the Rockies, they can be beaten, as
Del Monte will prove.
Both Nevada and University of
San Francisco have poor teams. With
their schedule, the Dons will be
lucky to win another game the rest
of the season.
Wedemeyer Sparks
The best football newcomer on the
coast if not in the nation is young
Herman Wedemeyer of St. Mary's,

one of several Hawaiians now play
ing ball for the Gaels. He has played
60 minutes in both of his college
games. Against UC, he played ter
rificly and made a highly favored
Bear eleven fight for victory. In the
Del Monte game, he engineered his
squad's only score with a brilliant
40-yard run to put St. Mary's in
scoring territory. This is Wede
meyer's first year of collegiate foot
ball, and if he does as well in his next
three years, he is a cinch for Ail-
American honors by his junior year.
Del Monte could show the West
Coast a Big Ten brand of football if
it could find some opposition. It isn't
very often that three men like
Christman, Hall, Eshmont, are on
the same team in any one season.
It's too bad that such a team finds
Cal a conglomeration of lease-lend
ers and 4-F's, St. Mary's a bunch of
17-year-olds first tasting college
football, COP, USC, et. al. slightly
ersatz. There just isn't a team on
the coast that can give Del Monte
a run for its money. How about
Daly, Hirsh leading an invading
Michigan team out to the coast to
take on Christman & Co.? Let's put
that in the form of a motion!

game was Len Eshmont's 81-yard
run from punt formation through tht
entire opposition for a touchdown,
Within two minutes after that, Park
er Hall did a repeat of the previous,
week by going some 60 yards oft
tackle for another touchdown.
Del Monte should take every tean
they play including Southern Cali
fornia.
Showing just enough to win, Col
lege of Pacific trounced the Coast,
Guard 14 to 7. They looked like i;
good ball club and proved they were
in following weeks by defeating both
St. Mary's Pre-Flight and UCLA
Their tussle with California next:
Saturday should test their capabili
ties. If Johnny Podesto should gev
injured, COP is lost, for he is the
team.
Cal Has Fair Team
Contrary to what you may have
heard, the California Bears are still
operating as usual with their regu«
lar down-the-middle type of play.
The Bears have the best line Stan
ford could give them. (Just think of
what a marvelous team Stanford
would have in peace time —Joslyn,
I Boensch, Cox, Nourse, Hachten, An
drews, Brown, and so many more.)
Ait Honnegger has been playing
much better than anyone expected.
Bill Joslyn has been throwing good
passes. With their style of play, Cal
will lose several more games. The
Bears will lose to USC, Del Monte,
and possibly College of Pacific.
Several things came to our atten
tion during the UC-USC battle last
Saturday. Cal can play marvelous
football when in her own territory.
It pays off, though, when she can
gain in her opponent's land. South
ern Cal will lose several games be
cause of failure to realize scoring
opportunities when they are staring
her in the face. The Trojans are not
the team the pre-season experts ex
pected. Though they may have the
best team in collegiate circles west of
the Rockies, they can be beaten, as
Del Monte will prove.
Both Nevada and University of
San Francisco have poor teams. With
their schedule, the Dons will be
lucky to win another game the rest
of the season.
Wedemeyer Sparks
The best football newcomer on the
coast if not in the nation is young
Herman Wedemeyer of St. Mary's,

one of several Hawaiians now play
ing ball for the Gaels. He has played
60 minutes in both of his college
games. Against UC, he played ter
rificly and made a highly favored
Bear eleven fight for victory. In the
Del Monte game, he engineered his
squad's only score with a brilliant
40-yard run to put St. Mary's in
scoring territory. This is Wede
meyer's first year of collegiate foot
ball, and if he does as well in his next
three years, he is a cinch for Ail-
American honors by his junior year.
Del Monte could show the West
Coast a Big Ten brand of football if
it could find some opposition. It isn't
very often that three men like
Christman, Hall, Eshmont, are on
the same team in any one season.
It's too bad that such a team finds
Cal a conglomeration of lease-lend
ers and 4-F's, St. Mary's a bunch of
17-year-olds first tasting college
football, COP, USC, et. al. slightly
ersatz. There just isn't a team on
the coast that can give Del Monte
a run for its money. How about
Daly, Hirsh leading an invading
Michigan team out to the coast to
take on Christman & Co.? Let's put
that in the form of a motion!
With no team of its own to root
for, interest of Stanford students will
center around football as played by
our neighbors, civilian and service
alike.
So far this season, we have viewed
six games and eight teams. We have
seen every major team in the state
outside of UCLA and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight. From what we've heard, we
haven't missed much.
By far the best team on the coast
is Del Monte Pre-Flight. Their of
ficer team can score anytime, any
where, at will. They have played
twice, and won twice. Against Coast
Guard they were marvelous. Coast
Guard was lucky enough to score s
touchdown against them, insulting
the officers.
On the second play after the Coast.
Guard kick-off, Del Monte sprung
Parker Hall loose off tackle for 72
yards and a touchdown. The next;
chance on offense that Del Monte l
had, Paul Christman threw a perfect
pass to Len Eshmont, good for 5G
yards and another score. That was
convincing enough that they could
score at will.
Del Monte Wins
Del Monte proved themselves
again Sunday against St. Mary's
With all the breaks going against,
them, Del Monte erased a seven
point deficit to come out victorious
33-7. With the breaks going the other
way, the score would be nearer 60
points. The outstanding play of the
game was Len Eshmont's 81-yard
run from punt formation through tht

and possibly College of Pacific.
Several things came to our atten
tion during the UC-USC battle last
Saturday. Cal can play marvelous
football when in her own territory.
It pays off, though, when she can
gain in her opponent's land. South
ern Cal will lose several games be
cause of failure to realize scoring
opportunities when they are staring
her in the face. The Trojans are not
the team the pre-season experts ex
pected. Though they may have the
best team in collegiate circles west of
the Rockies, they can be beaten, as
Del Monte will prove.
Both Nevada and University of
San Francisco have poor teams. With
their schedule, the Dons will be
lucky to win another game the rest
of the season.
Wedemeyer Sparks
The best football newcomer on the
coast if not in the nation is young
Herman Wedemeyer of St. Mary's,

one of several Hawaiians now play
ing ball for the Gaels. He has played
60 minutes in both of his college
games. Against UC, he played ter
rificly and made a highly favored
Bear eleven fight for victory. In the
Del Monte game, he engineered his
squad's only score with a brilliant
40-yard run to put St. Mary's in
scoring territory. This is Wede
meyer's first year of collegiate foot
ball, and if he does as well in his next
three years, he is a cinch for Ail-
American honors by his junior year.
Del Monte could show the West
Coast a Big Ten brand of football if
it could find some opposition. It isn't
very often that three men like
Christman, Hall, Eshmont, are on
the same team in any one season.
It's too bad that such a team finds
Cal a conglomeration of lease-lend
ers and 4-F's, St. Mary's a bunch of
17-year-olds first tasting college
football, COP, USC, et. al. slightly
ersatz. There just isn't a team on
the coast that can give Del Monte
a run for its money. How about
Daly, Hirsh leading an invading
Michigan team out to the coast to
take on Christman & Co.? Let's put
that in the form of a motion!
With no team of its own to root
for, interest of Stanford students will
center around football as played by
our neighbors, civilian and service
alike.
So far this season, we have viewed
six games and eight teams. We have
seen every major team in the state
outside of UCLA and St. Mary's Pre-
Flight. From what we've heard, we
haven't missed much.
By far the best team on the coast
is Del Monte Pre-Flight. Their of
ficer team can score anytime, any
where, at will. They have played
twice, and won twice. Against Coast
Guard they were marvelous. Coast
Guard was lucky enough to score s
touchdown against them, insulting
the officers.
On the second play after the Coast.
Guard kick-off, Del Monte sprung
Parker Hall loose off tackle for 72
yards and a touchdown. The next;
chance on offense that Del Monte l
had, Paul Christman threw a perfect
pass to Len Eshmont, good for 5G
yards and another score. That was
convincing enough that they could
score at will.
Del Monte Wins
Del Monte proved themselves
again Sunday against St. Mary's
With all the breaks going against,
them, Del Monte erased a seven
point deficit to come out victorious
33-7. With the breaks going the other
way, the score would be nearer 60
points. The outstanding play of the
game was Len Eshmont's 81-yard
run from punt formation through tht
entire opposition for a touchdown,
Within two minutes after that, Park
er Hall did a repeat of the previous,
week by going some 60 yards oft
tackle for another touchdown.
Del Monte should take every tean
they play including Southern Cali
fornia.
Showing just enough to win, Col
lege of Pacific trounced the Coast,
Guard 14 to 7. They looked like i;
good ball club and proved they were
in following weeks by defeating both
St. Mary's Pre-Flight and UCLA
Their tussle with California next:
Saturday should test their capabili
ties. If Johnny Podesto should gev
injured, COP is lost, for he is the
team.
Cal Has Fair Team
Contrary to what you may have
heard, the California Bears are still
operating as usual with their regu«
lar down-the-middle type of play.
The Bears have the best line Stan
ford could give them. (Just think of
what a marvelous team Stanford
would have in peace time —Joslyn,
I Boensch, Cox, Nourse, Hachten, An
drews, Brown, and so many more.)
Ait Honnegger has been playing
much better than anyone expected.
Bill Joslyn has been throwing good
passes. With their style of play, Cal
will lose several more games. The
Bears will lose to USC, Del Monte,
and possibly College of Pacific.
