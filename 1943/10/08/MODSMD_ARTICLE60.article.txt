Its coming again!
The laughs, the songs, the gags
I that are THE GAIETIES will be back
i at Stanford this quarter.
i Already the call for scripts, music, J
I gags, and ideas has been put out by
j Jean Levinson, director, and Nan
Tilson, assistant director; for the j
Gaieties is an entirely student writ
ten, student produced, and student j
acted show.
Because of the shortage of avail
able civilian male talent at Stanford, |
Miss Levinson has also sent out a
call for soldier talent which can be
used in both acting and writing jobs.
The only students who will not be
allowed to participate in the Gaieties
are first quarter freshman women.
The Gaieties is the major Stanford
theatrical production of every year,
I and was formerly the highlight of
the pre-Big Game festivities. This
year the historic California-Stanford
clash is called off "because of rain";
but the Gaieties will go 011 anyway.
Curtain call will be Dec;. 4. and ro

hearsals will begin within the next
month. Watch the Daily for try-out
dates and for crew calls. Ram's
Head, the honorary dramatic society
at Stanford, will award points toward
membership to anyone working on
any one of the costume, scenery, or
make-up crews as well as on the
acting, writing or producing side.
