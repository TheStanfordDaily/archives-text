# Focus on the Meaningful

THIS IS YOUR WELCOME TO STANFORD—
Even two years ago, we hauled out tom-toms and beat a lusty
greeting to the freshmen. We handed them a loud and gala rah
rah. We whipped through rallies and parades and cheering
sessions. We blasted loudly and the shouting died. And we found
the noise was hollow and the meaning empty. For the collegiate
swing tempo was hushed by a more powerful symphony of
horror. And the old superficial welcome is now outmoded.
Today we greet you, the new members of the Stanford Family,
in a truer key, a tune we have learned the hard way. The welcome
is serious. And perhaps it is guiet because we have learned to
take time out to be thankful that we, in these times, are privileged
to attend a University where we have the opportunity to see
beyond the chaotic present.
We at Stanford have changed some of our ideas of college
life. Our Ivory Towers of blissful isolation and protection, the
sanctum of our Inner Quad, have been invaded by the startling
and meaningful black-face headlines, the unavoidable exigencies
of war, the khaki.
You may miss the old introduction. And perhaps college for
you won't be like the stories you've heard. Perhaps the rooter's
caps and pom-poms will be gone. Perhaps there will be no Yo
semite weekends, no late City dates, no beach parties, and no
lavish formals. You will find that Stanford has changed from the
fable, the "good old days," the "remember when "
But we hope you will see beyond these trivial superficialities.
We hope that you will soon know that in spite of the war, in spite
of changes, Stanford has remained a kind of haven—a place not
only occupied with grim and realistic preparation for the present,
but an institution where a chosen few may prepare for a bigger
future, where original love of independence is maintained, where
belief is unhampered and stimulated by thought and discussion,
where criticism and evaluation are concomitants of intellectual
liberty.
We hope you will learn why Stanford is unafraid to quote the
words of a German, Ulrich Von Hutton, "Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht."
