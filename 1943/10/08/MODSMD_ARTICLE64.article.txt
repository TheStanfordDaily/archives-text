COLLEGE IS WHERE YOU LEARN THINGS:
You learn to blame high school teachers for not teaching you
how to study. You learn to sleep in an unmade bed without
changing the sheets all quarter.
You learn to relax reading a New Yorker short story by Gypsy
Rose Lee while listening to a radio speech against jay-walking—
and at the same time filing your fingernails.
You learn to talk about parties, automobile accidents, and
money you've spent.
You learn early that you're not going to be a Phi Bete.
You see that some people study because they are conscien
tious—others because they are neurotic and need an escape
from college life.
You learn to listen to the same record twelve times before
you get up to change it ... . and the same lecture twice before
you cut it. You learn to write checks with your hand rather than
your head.
You learn to have salted peanuts and a chocolate coke for
breakfast. You learn to look up through your eyebrows Holly
wood-like. You'd better learn or some Mills gal will teach you
the hard way.
College is a perfect place to grow up. Now it's like going
up to the registrar: "I've got six months or six quarters," you
say, "put four years worth of facts, muscle, and poise on me."
So you'll work harder, play more intensely, and get old more
quickly.
But don't cry for the "old days." Times have changed. And
so have college and you.
