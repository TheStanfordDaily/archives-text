# New Dimout Rules Take Effect Now
## 
### 
With an improvement in the Pa
cific defense situation, Lt. Gen. Delos
C. Emmons, chief of the Western
Defense Command, announced last
; week that coastal dimout regulations
| would be eased.
Most important change in the reg
ulations to students is that they no
| longer need pull their shades at sun
set. One of the changes permits in
} terior lights to shine unshielded in
! Zone C, which includes Stanford and
| most of Palo Alto.
The liberalized regulations also
allow exterior lights of under 100-
watt size to shine without shields,
and the restriction on lights in out
door areas has been changed to five
foot-candle power instead of one
foot-candle power in this zone. As
much sports lighting as necessary is
allowed, except that special permis
sion must be obtained for lights over
30-foot-candles in strength.
