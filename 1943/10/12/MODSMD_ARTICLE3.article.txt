# DRAMA
## Play Tryouts Begin Tonight 
### 
Tryouts will begin this evening at
7:30 and will continue through to
morrow night for three plays which
will compose the first in a series of
six productions by the Stanford
Players this season. The plays will
be presented November 10, 11, 12, 13,
and 15 in the Little Theater.
Every student registered in the
University, with the exception of
first-quarter freshman women, is
eligible to participate in the tryouts,
which will be in the Little Theater of
Memorial Hall. It is not at all neces
sary to be a drama student.
Rehearsals begin immediately after
the appointment of the casts. The
selections will be announced in the
Daily.
Of the three plays, Mr. David Siev
ers will direct "Hello Out There," by
William Saroyan, Mr. Norman Phil
brick will direct "The Happy Jour
ney" by Thornton Wilder, and Mr.
F. C. Strickland will direct "A Vil
lage Wooing" by George Bernard
Shaw.
According to Mr. Strickland, di
rector of dramatics, one student may
play a role in each of the three plays
if he is suited for them, but re
hearsals will be lighter for those
persons taking only one part.
'"Hello Out There" offers three
large and three small parts, "The
Happy Journey" has six parts, and
"A Village Wooing" has two parts.
Season tickets for the series of
six productions given by the Stan
ford Players may be purchased at
Mr. Strickland's office in Memorial
Hall; it will be limited to 600 books.
