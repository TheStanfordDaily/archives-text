# Yanks Down Cards Again; Nab Series
## 
### 
The New York Yankees gained
revenge yesterday over the St. Louis
Cardinals by defeating them, 2-0, to
regain the World's Championship by
winning four games to one for the
Cards. It was sweet revenge as the
Bronx Bombers used the exact same
tactics to win this series as the new
edition of the Gas House Gang used
in taking the series from the Yanks
last year.
Mort Cooper, star moundsman for
the Cards, started off the day in
splendid fashion by striking out the
first five men to face him to come
within one of the world series record.
Cooper was in magnificent form as
he had New York silenced for over
half the ball game. Victory was not
to be had however as the Red Birds
were not able to push a run across all
day long, leaving 12 players stranded
on base.
Victory came for New York in the
sixth inning when Bill Dickey, one of
the game's greatest catchers, hit his
fifth homer of the year with Joe Gor
don perched on second. Just the day
before, Dickey broke the World
Series record for number of games
in World Series play with the same
team. Yesterday's game made it
number 38.
Lineup Revamped
For the first time in the series,
Manager Billy Southworth of St.
Louis revamped his lineup in order
to try and find a winning combina
tion. He inserted Debs Garms and
Johnny Hopp in the outfield in place
of Danny Litwhiler and Harry
Walker.
A combination of daring base-run
ning by the Yankees and the Card
inal failure to hit in the clutches are
the causes of the St. Louis downfall.
In the past two games, for instance,
Lou Klein made an out when a hit
might have meant the ball game.
The outstanding player on the field
was Joe Gordon of the Yankees, who
turned in several brilliant plays, and
fielded like an all-time great. Be
sides his great plays, Gordon hit a
homer off of Max Lanier. Bill Dickey
played good consistent ball for the
champs. Spud Chandler pitched two
beautiful ball games. Marius Russo
showed his 1941 form in pitching and
batting the Yanks to their third win
of the series. Morton Cooper stood
out for the Cards as he won their
only victory only a few hours after
hearing about the death of his father.
Bill Johnson played great ball in his
first series as he gave the champs a
victory Thursday by hitting a triple
with the bases loaded.
The Yankees were charged with
five errors lor the series as against
12 for St. Louis.
