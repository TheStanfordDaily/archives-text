## Stanford Withdraws Teams From All Sports 
### Don Langendorf 
The question of participation in
inter-collegiate sports for Stanford
has finally been answered. The first
part of the answer came eight weeks
ago with the announcement that the
Farm would not field a football team
this year. Installment number two of
the answer came late last week when
Stanford notified its opponents that
their games would be cancelled in
all sports.
With the end of football, many
thought that there still would be a
good chance for basketball, baseball,
track, and the minor sports that don't
need as many men. After all, foot
ball takes at least two dozen men.
For basketball, less than a dozen
would be sufficient. We could par
ticipate on a par with the University
of San Francisco or with St. Mary's.
If Stanford would have played bas
ketball, so would Santa Clara. There
would then be four teams in the area
of equal strength. Maybe San Jose
State and Fresno State, who have a
manpower shortage such as Stanford,
would consider sending a team onto
the floor.
With that kind of a setup, Stanford
could drop out of the conference for
the duration and form a six-club
league with those other teams. The
caliber might not be as high as in

previous years, but that would not
dull the spirit of battle still left on
the campus of Stanford or of other
colleges.
Baseball only needs slightly over a
dozen men. Stanford could and
should field a ball club. It is a proven
fact that baseball players mature
much earlier than football or basket
ball men. Some have even come out
of high school. As an example, Bill
Sarni of the Angels or Todd Davis of
Hollywood or even Mel Ott of the
New York Giants, will do. Surely i
there are a dozen men at Stanford
interested, out of which might come j
another Mel Ott.
Track is another story entirely, j
With Johnny Fulton, best middle
distance runner on the coast, and Ed j
Luce, six-foot two-inch high jumper, |
returning to form the nucleus of a >
team, there is no reason why the I
Farm shouldn't be represented on
the racks of the nation.
Highlighting the tennis situation
around Stanford is the return of Bob
Forbes from last year's varsity.
Among the entering frosh are Scott
Chaffee, high-ranking in state jun
iors, and Gill Seton, seventh ranking
in boys' singles in Southern Califor
nia. From here it looks as though
Stanford would be missing a good
opportunity in not using their
talents.
