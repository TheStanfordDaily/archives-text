### 
In smothering the mighty Michigan
grid machine 35 to 12 last Saturday,
the Fighting Irish of Notre Dame
proved themselves the top team in
the nation. The highly touted Wolv
erines were completely outplayed as
Bertelli and company went over and
around them to tally in every quar
ter but the last.
Easily the best team in the country,
the Notre Dame squad of today ranks
with the great teams turned out by
the late Knute Rockne.
Pointing for their annual clash,
both Army and Navy looked good
against their opponents. Navy
dropped Duke from the ranks of the

undefeated, 14 to 13, in one of the
i best games of the day. while power
ful Army romped through Temple
i 51 to 0.
On the coast, Southern California
maintained their unbeaten and un
scored upon record at the expense
of a gallant St. Mary's Pre-Flight
team that went down to defeat 13 to
0. With Captain Ralph Heywood and
others soon to be called by the Ma
rines, however, the Trojan jugernaut
may be slowed down sooner than
most people think.
In the other top coast contest. Col
lege of the Pacific showed that it
| has a team to be reckoned with as
1 the Tigers downed California, 12 to 6.
