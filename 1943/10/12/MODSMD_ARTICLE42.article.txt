# And Autumn Changes
## 
### 
Another Reg day, another Autumn Quarter, another year.
"Even two years ago, we hauled out tom-toms and beat a
lusty greeting to the freshmen. We handed out a loud and gala
rah-rah. We whipped through rallies and parades and cheering
sessions. We blasted loudly and the shouting died. And we
found the noise was hollow and the meaning empty. For the
collegiate swing tempo was hushed by a more powerful sym
phony of horror. And the old superficial song is now outmoded.
"Today, we start a new Fall Quarter in a truer key, a tune we
have learned the hard way. The beginning is serious, and per
haps it is more quiet because we have learned to take time out
to be thankful that we, in these times, are privileged to attend
a university where we may have the opportunity to see beyond
the chaotic present.
"We at Stanford have changed some of our ideas of college
life. Our Ivory Towers of blissful isolation and protection, the
sanctum of our Inner Quad, have bene invadde by the startling
and meaningful black-face headlines, the unavoidable exigenices
of war, the khaki. . . .
"We hope that you will soon know that in spite of the war, in
spite of changes, Stanford has remained a kind of haven —a place
not only occupied with grim and realistic preparation for the pres
ent, but an institution where a chosen few may prepare for a bigger
future, where original love of independence is maintained, where
belief is unhampered and stimulated by thought and discussion,
where criticism and evaluation are concomitants of intellecetual
liberty. •
"We hope you will know why Stanford is unafraid to quote the
words of a German, Ulrich Von Hutton, 'Die Luft der Freiheit
Weht.' " —Reprinted from the Pre-Reg Daily, a message to the new
Stanford men and women.
