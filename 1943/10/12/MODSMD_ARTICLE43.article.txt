It's hard for one down in this god-forsaken state of Texas to
keep track of Coast sports. But recently I received a Daily Cali
fornian, in which the view was expressed that the abandonment
of football at Stanford would lower the University's prestige.
Possibly some universities put such emphasis on football that
their so-called prestige rises and falls on the shoulders of their
gridiron players. It's true that Stanford teams have been to the
Rose Bowl more than any other, and that have won a ma
jority of the Big Games. But to universities in Stanford's class,
greatness is reached by more noteworthy achievements. To be
specific, such things as a higher precentage of law students pass
ing the state bar examination than those of other institutions, win
ning a great majority of Commonwealth Club debates with Cal,
giving a president to the United States, having as ex-President of
the University a national leader like Dr. Wlibur, and insisting on
higher scholastic standings to qualify one for entrance than other
universities require.
And now, instead of Stanford's prestige being lowered, as the
young Cal aspiring journalist would have us believe, it is being
raised even more. There are nearly 3,000 Army students on the
Farm. In relation to total enrollment, is not that a higher per
centage of service men than Cal has?
To those of us in the service, it is a far greater tribute for the
government to see fit to send so many students to Stanford, than
to have the Indian Model T repeat the Strawberry Canyon mas
sacre of last year.
