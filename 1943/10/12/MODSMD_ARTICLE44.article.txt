## Anti-Nazi Film Stars Davis 
### 
WATCH ON THE RHINE — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
As a picture showing the contrast
between life in these United States
and the hide-and-seek game played
with the Gestapo in Europe by an
anti-Nazi, Watch on the Rhine is an
excellent bit of propaganda. The .act
ing is a trifle over-done, but makes
up for lack of plot.
The situation in which Bette Davis
finds herself on her return home
after 17 years, during which she had
married a German and had three
children, is a pleasant one in con
trast to her life as the wife of a man
the Gestapo wanted, but it becomes
unpleasant when she finds that a
guest of her mother's would be glad
to blackmail her husband in order to
raise himself in the estimation of the
local Nazis.
The performance of the children is
outstanding. They had seen many
hardships and had matured long be
fore their time because of them. They
had never had time to play with
slingshots and dolls—they were too
busy pulling mice out of bathtubs
and dodging Gestapo agents while
their mother sewed so they would be
able to have something to eat.
Also on the program is The March
of Time and a cartoon which is defi
nitely unusual.—Hanssen
