The United Air Lines has estab
lished a research fund at Stanford
University for the advancement of
aviation education, President Donald
B. Tresidder has announced.
The fund is under the direction of
Dr. L. B. Kinney, acting dean of the
School of Education, who stated it
would be used for scholarships for
teachers of aviation subjects and for
research projects in the new field of
aviation education.
Trained teachers and textbooks to
teach the fundamentals of aviation
mechanics, mathematics, and geog
raphy are lacking. Dr. Kinney said,
and that is why the fund was made
available to Stanford.
