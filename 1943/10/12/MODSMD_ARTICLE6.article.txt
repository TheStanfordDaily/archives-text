# WAR BOARD
## Bond Booth Set To Open Thurs. 
### 
The new War Board Bond Booth
will stage a grand opening Thursday
morning at 10 in front of the Cellar.
Victory maidens will be on hand
ready to sell stamps and bonds to all
students. This new booth is under
the management of Beverly Andru
cetti, new stamp chairman, who is
urging everyone to adopt the habit
this quarter of buying at least one,
preferably two or three, stamps each
week.
Returning women students are
urged to change their pledge cards
at the War Board Office, in Room 14
of the Old Union. Freshman women
will be asked to sign the War Board
pledge of two hours a week war
work.
There are many opportunities in
essential war work open for students,
men and women. The Red Cross
rooms in the Women's Clubhouse
are now open from 10-12 and 1-4,
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday.
Girls are needed urgently to help
fill this month's quota of surgical
dressings. A new slogan has been
suggested: "Give an hourâ€”save a
life."
Civilian men are also needed this
quarter, and their interest and active
support will be appreciated by the
SWB.
Crop crews are needed by the
Santa Clara Valley farmers, who are
asking Stanford students to help pick
the tomatoes before the first frost.
Walnuts, too, must be picked. Vol
unteers may apply at the SWB office.
