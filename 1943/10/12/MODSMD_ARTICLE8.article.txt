A record enrollment of 5.!M)0 soldier and civilian students was reporter!
last night by Registrar Dr. J. P. Mitchell at the end of the registration for
the Fall Quarter.
Of this number, almost 3.04)0 were soldiers stationed on the campus in
the Army Specialized Training Program. Civilian students numbered

1,425 women and 950 men.
Totals at the end of the first day's
registration for Summer Quarter
were 645 women and 704 civilian
men. At least 275 of the women stu
dents were lower division women in
their first quarter at. Stanford.
The number of women registering
was several hundred above the esti
mate made last week by Dean of
Women Mary Yost, and they
swamped facilities in the Adminis
tration Building. The lines of women
waiting for registration booklets ex
tended at times out into the Outer
Quad, the grass, and down the front
steps.
Gym Registration Moved
To save shoe leather for women
students, registration for physical
education classes was moved from
the physical education building to
Room 122 of the Graduate School of
Business.
About 300 freshmen were included
in the group which took the English
A examination. This figure, however,
does not include new students this
quarter.
No estimates were made as to how
many more students would register
today and Wednesday. Nor could the
Registrar's Office announce how
many upper and lower division stu
dents were registered.
Specialized training units studying
at Stanford include basic engineers,
advanced engineers, European and
Far Eastern area and language stu
dents, personnel psychologists, and
pre-medical students.
Outside the specialized training
program are other and smaller Army
units, including 20 WACs studying
physical therapy, a second quarter
master corps in the Graduate School
of Business, and' a Civil Affairs
Training School composed entirely of
officers.
