# Fall Civilian Registration Rises to 2,441
## 
### 
Adding to Monday's record regis
tration of 5,300 soldier and civilian
students, 66 latecomers registered
yesterday for Stanford's Fall Quar
ter, Registrar J. Pearce announced
last night.
This brought the civilian total for
the quarter to 2,441, including 1,459
women and 982 civilian men. The new
registrants were divided almost
equally, 34 women and 32 men.
The Registrar's Office estimated
that about 600 of the registrants were
new to Stanford this quarter. About
1,000 women and 800 men were re
turning students.
Both Miss Mary Yost, Dean of
Women, and John Bunn, Dean of
Men, expressed surprise and pleas
ure at the unexpectedly large civilian
enrollment, but commented on the
housing difficulties which had re
sulted.
The number of women registering
wass everal hundred above the esti
mate made last week by Dean Yost,
and they swamped facilities in the
Administration Building Monday.
iLnes of returning women students
ran far down the steps of the Outer
Quad during the morning rush. Most
students Monday registered by noon.
Miss Yost, remarking she had "just
come up for air," said that more
women than she had expected had
returned to live in sorority houses or
were living with their parents, and
that there might also be more gradu
ate students living off campus than
her office had anticipated. She added
that the women's age level had
dropped with the registering of so
many lower division women.
She attributed the high women's
enrollment to the fact that people
had more money to spend and were
spending it on their daughters since
their sons were in uniform; and to
the growing realization of the value
of college training, which the Army
and Navy had emphasized in their
college programs.
Dean Bunn said that the registra
tion figures for men, most of whom
he assumed to be lower division stu
dents, was very encouraging. He said
that his office had anticipated only
700 civilian men, but that they were
succeeding in finding living quarters
for all since some were living in pri
vate homes and twice as many as
usual were living with their families.

The Registrar's Office estimated
that about 600 of the registrants were
new to Stanford this quarter. About
1,000 women and 800 men were re
turning students.
Both Miss Mary Yost, Dean of
Women, and John Bunn, Dean of
Men, expressed surprise and pleas
ure at the unexpectedly large civilian
enrollment, but commented on the
housing difficulties which had re
sulted.
The number of women registering
wass everal hundred above the esti
mate made last week by Dean Yost,
and they swamped facilities in the
Administration Building Monday.
iLnes of returning women students
ran far down the steps of the Outer
Quad during the morning rush. Most
students Monday registered by noon.
Miss Yost, remarking she had "just
come up for air," said that more
women than she had expected had
returned to live in sorority houses or
were living with their parents, and
that there might also be more gradu
ate students living off campus than
her office had anticipated. She added
that the women's age level had
dropped with the registering of so
many lower division women.
She attributed the high women's
enrollment to the fact that people
had more money to spend and were
spending it on their daughters since
their sons were in uniform; and to
the growing realization of the value
of college training, which the Army
and Navy had emphasized in their
college programs.
Dean Bunn said that the registra
tion figures for men, most of whom
he assumed to be lower division stu
dents, was very encouraging. He said
that his office had anticipated only
700 civilian men, but that they were
succeeding in finding living quarters
for all since some were living in pri
vate homes and twice as many as
usual were living with their families.
Adding to Monday's record regis
tration of 5,300 soldier and civilian
students, 66 latecomers registered
yesterday for Stanford's Fall Quar
ter, Registrar J. Pearce announced
last night.
This brought the civilian total for
the quarter to 2,441, including 1,459
women and 982 civilian men. The new
registrants were divided almost
equally, 34 women and 32 men.
