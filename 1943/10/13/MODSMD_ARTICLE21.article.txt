# Picturization Of Hemingway Novel Tiresome

### 
FOR WIIOIM THE BELL TOLLS—
I now playing at the Paramount The-
J ater in San Francisco.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" will
undoubtedly be the disappointment
of the year in the motion picture in
dustry. Paramount's two million
I dollar production of Ernest Heming
i way's novel of love and the Spanish
| Civil War has been transformed by
| the Hays Office into a mild romance
which ignores sex and historic sig
•r
nincance.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls'' has as
its strong points superb characteriza
tions and magnificent photography
that compensate in some measure for
the long and tiresome story. Gary
Cooper as Robert Jordan, the Amer
| ican newspaperman who has come to
the aid of the Spanish Loyalists, and
. Ingrid Bergman, the girl who has
j become entangled in the web of
fascism, are good in the feature roles,
i but top honors must be given to the
excellent supporting cast. Katina
Paxinou as Pilar and Akim Tamiroff
| as the treacherous Pablo give per
| formances that are really outstand
i ing.
The running time of "For Whom
the Bell Tolls" has been cut from
three hours to two hours and thirty
five minutes, but the picture still
drags throughout, due mainly to the
long dialogues and close-ups that
occur frequently. The last few min
utes, however, when Jordan dyna
mites a bridge that spans a mountain
pass, are intensely exciting. A fur
ther streamlined edition of the pic
ture will probably be presented
when it returns for popular prices
t in 1945.
Everybody who has read "For
Whom the Bell Tolls" will be bitterly
disappointed at the screen version.
Those who haven't read the novel
! will agree that the picture has been
"built up" too much. While this is
| certainly true, a large share of the
blame belongs to the Hays office for
i its rough treatment of the picture's
highly emotional moments.—Bower
