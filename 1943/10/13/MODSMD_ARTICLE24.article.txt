## Germans Advise Pope To Leave Vatican 
### 
LONDON, Oct. 12. â€”Germany has
advised Pope Pius XII to leave Rome,
because it cannot guarantee the
Vatican's safety if the city becomes a
battleground, and has "offered" to
move him to the neutral Duchy of
Liechtenstein or to Germany itself,
dispatches from neutral capitals said
today.
The Pope refused the "offer" and
said he would not leave the Vatican
while he was alive, the dispatches
said.
