# Allies Hit Volturno With Heavy Artillery

ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, AL
| GIERS, Oct. 12.â€”A thundering ar
j tillery blazed across the flooded Vol
turno Valley today as Allied troops
prepared to storm the river barrier
while American and British forces
in an outflanking drive to the east
punched deep into the Germans'
mountain ring.
Rain pelted down over the entire
Italian front for the fourth successive

day, official reports said, and in the
Fifth Army sector ground operations
were limited to patrolling.
(The Cairo radio said a heavy
battle was in progress northwest of
Capua which would mean the Fifth
Army already had crossed the Vol
turno in force.)
