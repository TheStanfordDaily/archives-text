# Roosevelt In Uncertain Of Russian Policy
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, October 12.
President Roosevelt said today that
if Russia allowed the United States
the use of Siberian bases to bomb
Japan, the Japanese would probably
invade Siberia. Thus the whole mat
ter of bases comes down to the ques
tion of whether Russia is ready to
fight Japan.
The President told his news con
ference that Russia might give a
negative answer to the question, on
the theory that she thinks she has
something more important to do,
such as delivering the final knockout
blow against Germany.
In view of this situation, he added,
he did not think we knew enough
about it to go very far into the ques
tion.
