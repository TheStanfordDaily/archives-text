# Roos Bros. Open Shop on Campus
## 
### 
Alongside the Stanford Bookstore
and back of Madrona is the site
selected by Roos Brothers for their
new store, The Shack, which is open
ing today. Apparel for men and
women will be featured, and there
will also be some articles which will
be of interest to the Army.
A sweater worth $12.95 and a man's
jacket will be given away free to the
lucky man or woman who enters the
store today and draws the lucky
ticket. The drawing will be held
shortly before the store closes. Stan
ford students are invited to come to
the shop to smoke, chat, and look it
over.
