## SOUTHERN FOOTBALL Blue Devils Picked as Tops; Southwestern Top Contender 
### Roger Corman 
(Editor's note: This is the first in

analyzing the top football teams of
the nation, section by section.)
The Blue Devils are at it again!
Led by Battling Bob Gantt, two-year
All-Southern Conference end, Duke
rates as the top team in the South.
Although toppled from the ranks of
the undefeated last Saturday by
Navy, the Iron Dukes gave the Mid
dies a terrific battle, only to lose by
the point after touchdown, 14 to 13.
Howie Hartley, sub back, was a one
man team against Navy, and his
passing, coupled with the catching
of Gantt, will give the Blue Devils a
potent aerial punch.
Southwestern
Little giant killers of the border
territory is outhwestern. Disregarded
by the experts in pre-season ratings,
Southwestern is still undefeated and
has beaten such top teams as Texas,
North Texas, and the Cropus Christi
Air Base. Southwestern is definitely
the surprise team of the year in the
South, and can go far.
Texas A. and M.
By trampling previously unbeaten
Louisiana State last week, Texas A.
and M. marked itself as a top con

| lender for Southern honors. Sparked
I by veteran Barney Welch, the Aggies
look good and deserve their place as
, | one of the South's better teams.
Georgia Tech
With a lart/e Navy V-12 unit to
call on, the Yellowjackets of Georgia
i Tech have a powerful squad with
; only one blemish on its record. The
i terrific beating the Engineers took
j from Notre Dame has lost them a
lot of prestige, but they still have a
powerful, tricky squad. If Coach
Alexander can locate a good passer
or two to go with ends Ed Ryckley
and Ed Scharfschwerdt, Georgia
Tech can become a Southern power.
Louisiana State
The speedy backfield combine of
Steve Van Buren, Alvin Dark, and
freshman Bill Schroll is really mak
ing things hum for Louisiana State.
The Tigers have an offensive punch
that can be matched by few schools
1 in the Southland, but a weak de
fensive secondary showed up in the
only game they'vel ost so far. The
only team that stopped L.S.U. was
Texas A. and M., another high-scor
ing club. The Tigers have whipped
| Georgia and Rice and seem headed
j for big things.
i Tulsa
Missouri Valley champs last year
j and favored to win again this year.—
J That's the story of Tulsa, unbeaten
throughout the regular season last
year. Sax Judd, of last year's Dobbs
to Judd passing combination, is still
one of the best receivers in the busi
ness, and with Clyde Leforce, the
Bristow Breeze, heaving the pigskin,
should make ail-American. The
Huricanes can give their passer
plenty of protection with a veteran
line up front and a good blocking
backfield around him.
All in all. Duke's Blue Devils seem
too good for the field and should
finish way out in front and in line for
a possible bowl bid. Southwestern
could pull a surprise and so could
! Georgia Tech or Texas A. and M.,
but the chances are slim, and I don't
have much hesitation in putting my
money on Duke. Here are the teams
j in order of potential power, not their
records to date:
1. Duke.
2. Southwestern.
3. Texas A. and M.
4. Georgia Tech.
5. Louisiana State.
G. Tulsa.
7. Texas.
8. Georgia
9. Texas Christian.
10. Tulnae.

The Blue Devils are at it again!
Led by Battling Bob Gantt, two-year
All-Southern Conference end, Duke
rates as the top team in the South.
Although toppled from the ranks of
the undefeated last Saturday by
Navy, the Iron Dukes gave the Mid
dies a terrific battle, only to lose by
the point after touchdown, 14 to 13.
Howie Hartley, sub back, was a one
man team against Navy, and his
passing, coupled with the catching
of Gantt, will give the Blue Devils a
potent aerial punch.
Southwestern
Little giant killers of the border
territory is outhwestern. Disregarded
by the experts in pre-season ratings,
Southwestern is still undefeated and
has beaten such top teams as Texas,
North Texas, and the Cropus Christi
Air Base. Southwestern is definitely
the surprise team of the year in the
South, and can go far.
Texas A. and M.
By trampling previously unbeaten
Louisiana State last week, Texas A.
and M. marked itself as a top con

| lender for Southern honors. Sparked
I by veteran Barney Welch, the Aggies
look good and deserve their place as
, | one of the South's better teams.
Georgia Tech
With a lart/e Navy V-12 unit to
call on, the Yellowjackets of Georgia
i Tech have a powerful squad with
; only one blemish on its record. The
i terrific beating the Engineers took
j from Notre Dame has lost them a
lot of prestige, but they still have a
powerful, tricky squad. If Coach
Alexander can locate a good passer
or two to go with ends Ed Ryckley
and Ed Scharfschwerdt, Georgia
Tech can become a Southern power.
Louisiana State
The speedy backfield combine of
Steve Van Buren, Alvin Dark, and
freshman Bill Schroll is really mak
ing things hum for Louisiana State.
The Tigers have an offensive punch
that can be matched by few schools
1 in the Southland, but a weak de
fensive secondary showed up in the
only game they'vel ost so far. The
only team that stopped L.S.U. was
Texas A. and M., another high-scor
ing club. The Tigers have whipped
| Georgia and Rice and seem headed
j for big things.
i Tulsa
Missouri Valley champs last year
j and favored to win again this year.—
J That's the story of Tulsa, unbeaten
throughout the regular season last
year. Sax Judd, of last year's Dobbs
to Judd passing combination, is still
one of the best receivers in the busi
ness, and with Clyde Leforce, the
Bristow Breeze, heaving the pigskin,
should make ail-American. The
Huricanes can give their passer
plenty of protection with a veteran
