# SIDELINE LANTS...

After an absence of a quarter,
"Sideline Slants" returns to the
I Stanford Daily. For those that
i weren't here Summer Quarter,
| "Sideline Slants" was sidetracked in
favor of "Late Tips" by Late Wil-
J liams. In the two quarters preceding
J summer, "Slants" was used in the
reign of both Ed Luce and Zip Walt.
llf anyone can remember farther
J back, Salty Sontag used "Salty Sez."
Before that H. D. Thoreau used
"Slants" for the column. After
searching through back editions, we
come upon Tuesday, February 12,
1929, as the first time "Sideline
I Slants" was used in the Stanford
I Daily, nearly 15 years ago.

"Slants" has seen Stanford sports
at their best. In football, "Slants"
has seen the greatest teams in this
school's history. In its memory are
the Vow Boys who went to the Rose
Bowl three times in succession. From
that team comes memories of all-
American Bobby Grayson, Bones
Hamilton, Monk Moscrip, Keith Top
ping, and Frank Alustiza. From pre-
Thornhill memories recall all-Amer
ican guard Bill Corbus. Yes, we also
took the bitter with the sweet. We
recall the days when Stanford was
dwindling in the lower portions of
the conference. Memories also recall
the year of Shaughnessy's rags to
riches team, nicknamed the Wow
Boys. Ail-Americans were plentiful
then. There were Frankie Albert,
Norm Standlee, Chuck Taylor, Hugh
Gallerneau among others. But now.
we have no team; memories are all
that remain.
"Slants" recalls, as if it were only
yesterday, the greatest natural bas
| ketball player of all times, Hank
Luisetti. It recalls the night Hank
was knocked cold in the California
pavilion only to return later on in
j the game to break the collegiate
j scoring record of America. Memory
| of that one night brought a drop or
j two to our eyes for on Hank's return
to the floor, the Cal cheering section
came to their feet in a resounding
cheer for Hank, a tribute to a sports
| man. We can't recall another time
; when a California opponent ever re-
I ceived a round of applause such as

Hank received that night. "Slants 4 *
recalls other great basketball names
of Hank's day such as Turner, Cal
derwood, Stoefen, Lee, among others.
Of recent date we remember Jim
Pollard, tabbed by many as another
Luisetti, Howie Dallmar, Don Burn
nes.s and Ed Voss. By dropping
sports, will we ever have other
names to add to those memories?
'"Slants" recalls track memories as
well as the others. We recall the day
in 1932 when Blazing Ben Eastman
broke the official world's record for
the quarter mile by one second on
the Angell Field track. Memories
bring us back to the day only a few
weeks later when Blazing Ben broke
the accepted record for the half mile.
We recall the great middle-distance
races between Carr and Eastman and
the jinx Carr supposedly held over
Ben. We recall the championship
teams of not so long ago headed by
Clyde Jeffrey, Mushy Girard, Paul
Moore, Shaw, Williamson, and Clark,
and the many records broken or tied.
Their relay team was unbeatable.
More recently the names Smith, Ful
ton, Hertel, and Hart brings back
memories. Yes, "Slants" has seen
them all come and go.
It might be that we are a bit senti
mental. It might be tradition. But
regardless of what it might be,
"Sideline Slants" is back with us for
Autumn Quarter. Though sports
have been called off, we still have
memories of old daysâ€”but we have
nothing to add to them.
