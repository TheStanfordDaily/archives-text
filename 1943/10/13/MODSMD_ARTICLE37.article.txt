# "Journal of Delight"
## 
### 
WE were sitting in the editorial offices of The Daily Shack
yesterday afternoon, mulling over ideas and plans for an
Autumn Quarter policy. We were carefully considering The
Daily's obligation to its reading public—just what we should
stand for and against in our columns—just how we could accu
rately present the news the campus wants.
We browsed through some of the works of our compatriots
in the southland, and caught the name of our publication in print,
in a letter to the editor of the California Bruin, we read:
"As for the enjoyment of the Bruin, did you ever see a Stan
ford Daily? Why don't you get a few reporters? It seems in two
days you could dig up more than nine or ten items of student
interest for the paper. World news should be summarized in one
item. The Stanford Daily comes out every day and has about
three times the material in it that is in the Bruin.
Of course these candid remarks were adeguately answered
in the same issue, referring to The Daily as "that newsy little
journal of delight" and"the typesetter's gift to Palo Alto."
But even such professional jealousy failed to irk us, for we
v/ere somewhat pleased by the notice. And we were impressed
that a reader on another campus should recognize The Daily's
efforts.
And our guestions of policy were answered for us. We shall
continue to strive to publish a paper our readers want. We shall
not reach above our scope as college students. We shall try to
preserve eguilibrium and unity in University life.
