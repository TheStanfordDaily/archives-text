# Bull Session
## 
### BILL ROSE 
I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF
Big Senior coming back to the old haunts, the familiar faces,
the friendly voices. Ah, yes! With three years on the Farm be
hind me, I could at last feel I belonged here —that I was part of
that wonderfully heterogeneous group, the Stanford Ramily.
Yes, that was me—the day before I returned this quarter. It
was not me the day after I returned. For there was no more piti
ful sight on campus Monday than yours truly. I was lost (and
not because Frank Sinatra told me to get that way either). The old
haunts weren't there, the familiar faces had disappeared, the
friendly voices were hollow echoes from the Quad's walls.
Well, when I arrived, all I had was an address of the place
where I was to live. It was a hall and it was named after a presi
dent. I had never heard of the hall or the president, so I drove
up and down the campus streets —getting lost several times en
route —looking for a sign. There weren't any.
In desperation I went up to Lagunita Knoll (this is a bit far
fetched, but it makes a good story) to see if I could get any dope
(Yes, I said dope) from Dr. Wilbur. I was met by a garrulous
looking caretaker who said: "He don't live here no more. But
they's gwine to be somebody else livin' here purty soon." This
was followed by a sinister laugh.
Coming down the hill I met a clean-cut lad of 13 or 14 years.
"Perhaps you could help me," I said. "I'd like to know the loca
tion of a certain hall."
When I gave him the hall's name, he responded gleefully,
"Why, sure, that's over here. I'm living there too. This your
first quarter?" To avoid confusion, I said "yes" and followed
obediently.
A picture of defeat, I trod slowly toward the Daily Shack—
my last tie with the Stanford I knew. Upon opening the door I
was met by conglomerate howls of "Tryoutee," "Tyro," "Suck
er!"
Three beaming girls threw their arms around me and led me
to a seat at the copy desk. One of them handed me a pencil and
paper. "Here," she said, "put a head on this. Ever write one be
fore?"
"But I'm going to write Bull Session," I wheezed.
"Oh, you'll have to wait till you're on the staff awhile," the
girl answered. "Besides, a fellow named Bill Rose is doing it this
quarter."

first quarter?" To avoid confusion, I said "yes" and followed
obediently.
A picture of defeat, I trod slowly toward the Daily Shack—
my last tie with the Stanford I knew. Upon opening the door I
was met by conglomerate howls of "Tryoutee," "Tyro," "Suck
er!"
Three beaming girls threw their arms around me and led me
to a seat at the copy desk. One of them handed me a pencil and
paper. "Here," she said, "put a head on this. Ever write one be
fore?"
"But I'm going to write Bull Session," I wheezed.
"Oh, you'll have to wait till you're on the staff awhile," the
girl answered. "Besides, a fellow named Bill Rose is doing it this
quarter."
I'M A STRANGER HERE MYSELF
Big Senior coming back to the old haunts, the familiar faces,
the friendly voices. Ah, yes! With three years on the Farm be
hind me, I could at last feel I belonged here —that I was part of
that wonderfully heterogeneous group, the Stanford Ramily.
Yes, that was me—the day before I returned this quarter. It
was not me the day after I returned. For there was no more piti
ful sight on campus Monday than yours truly. I was lost (and
not because Frank Sinatra told me to get that way either). The old
haunts weren't there, the familiar faces had disappeared, the
friendly voices were hollow echoes from the Quad's walls.
Well, when I arrived, all I had was an address of the place
where I was to live. It was a hall and it was named after a presi
dent. I had never heard of the hall or the president, so I drove
up and down the campus streets —getting lost several times en
route —looking for a sign. There weren't any.
In desperation I went up to Lagunita Knoll (this is a bit far
fetched, but it makes a good story) to see if I could get any dope
(Yes, I said dope) from Dr. Wilbur. I was met by a garrulous
looking caretaker who said: "He don't live here no more. But
they's gwine to be somebody else livin' here purty soon." This
was followed by a sinister laugh.
Coming down the hill I met a clean-cut lad of 13 or 14 years.
"Perhaps you could help me," I said. "I'd like to know the loca
tion of a certain hall."
When I gave him the hall's name, he responded gleefully,
"Why, sure, that's over here. I'm living there too. This your
first quarter?" To avoid confusion, I said "yes" and followed
obediently.
