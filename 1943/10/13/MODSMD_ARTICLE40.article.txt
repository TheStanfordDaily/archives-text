# Groups To Aid Red Cross
## 
### 
The Red Cross surgical dressing !
room, under the management of Mrs. j
La Pierre and a new student chair- j
man, to be appointed by the War
Board, is planning to ask each living
group to pledge a certain number of i
hours. This quota will be determined
in relation to the number of girls
living in each residence.
In this way the War Board, ac
cording to Betty May Hale, SWB co
ordinator. hopes to make each living
group feel responsible as a group for
the satisfactory filling of the Red
Cross surgical dressing quota.
The War Board still wants every j
girl to sign War Work Pledge Cards
in the SWB office pledging to work
at least two hours each week.
The Red Cross quota has been
lowered this quarter, and since most
girls have more free time, it should j
be filled easily. "All that is needed." ;
declared Miss Hale, is enough en
thusiasm both on the part of the in
dividuals and their living groups."
