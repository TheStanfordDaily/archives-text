# Stanford Professor Reports On Vocational Interest Tests
## 
### 
Evidence of the validity of his
■widely used vocational interest tests
is given by Dr. Edward K. Strong
Jr., professor of psychology at Stan
lord. in the first full report on results
of using the tests for thousands of in
dividuals in the past 20 years.
His book, "Vocational Interests of
Men and Women," was published
last month by the Stanford Univer
sity Press.
Scores Check With Jobs
To check the validity of his tests
in really finding where vocational
interests lie, Dr. Strong followed up
every five years students whom he
had tested when they were college
freshmen and seniors. He found that
in general they held jobs which
were in harmony with the interest
scores they made in college.
As an example of the kind of voca
tional counseling the tests make pos
sible, Dr. Strong cites the case of a
young man who showed fairly high
interests in forest service, personnel,
social science teaching, advertising,
law, and journalism. He became a
public relations man for the park
service.
Interest Most Important
Ability and interest are both in
volved in vocational choice, Dr.
Strong says, but interest is more im
portant. Until his tests were de
vised, counselors had no way of as
certaining interests. He reports that
in a typical test of the Stanford senior

class, 36 per cent were not sure which
| vocation they were interested in. In
another test of students at a teach
ers' college, only 10 per cent made
I scores on the interest test indicating
that their interests were the same as
• those of successful teachers.
It was Dr. Strong's conviction of
the need for "personalized education"
—some method whereby a counselor
! could determine where a student's
real vocational interests lay and what
i field he was likely to enter so that he
could be trained for it—that led to
his interest tests.
Professional Predictions
"Until educators can .determine a
young person's best place in life, we
will never have a satisfactory educa
tional system," Dr. Strong says.
But in order to train students effi
j ciently in school, educators must be
able to predict what professions the
| students will enter and be happiest
i in.
These predictions are made on the
basis of the interests of 'Successful
men and women in each profession.
Dr. Strong learned in interviewing
j 23,000 members of about 60 occupa
j tions that they could be differentiated
| remarkably well by the interests of
their members.
Interests Are Permanent
Objectors often say that interests,
j especially among young persons, are
1 transitory. Dr. Strong agrees, but
i has designed his tests to measure
J more of the underlying attitudes
I than the temporary interests.
