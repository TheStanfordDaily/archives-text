# Original Scripts and Songs Sought for 1943 Gaieties
## 
### 
Ad urgent call has been sent out
by Jean Levinson. director of the
I 1943 Gaieties, for scripts, songs,
i "black-out" gags, or good ideas for
| the Gaieties which will be premiered
| at the Memorial Auditorium on Dec.
4.
For those students who have not
! seen a Stanford Gaieties before,
: scripts usually center around gags
i satirizing campus life. "If you see
any funny incident in the Cellar, at
! the Libe, on Quad, or in your living
! group, write it up and bring it over
to the Dramatic Council's office in
the Old Union as soon as possible,"
i says Miss Lfvinson.
Also if you have part of a song—
the lyrics without the tune, or the
tune without the lyrics—or just a
theme running through your head, be
I sure to let Miss Levinson or Nan
Tillson, assistant director, hear about
i it.
Tryouts will be held in the next
i few weeks and will be announced
beforehand in the Daily.
Students are also needed to work
on the make-up, scenery, props,
lighting, costume, and stage crews;
work on any of these will give points
toward Ram's Head, the honorary
j dramatic society at Stanford.
