# Stanford Men Will Still Play Football
## 
### 
It was announced yesterday by
football coach Marchie Schwartz that
there will be inter-squad football for
all those taking that sport. The only
thing holding up the issuance of
equipment, however, is the lack of
players. According to Schwartz,
there are only 23 men out for the
sport.
Although Stanford has given up
football as an inter-collegiate ac
tivity, sports still hold a position in
the physical education curriculum
for all those wishing to play tackle.
Anyone not yet signed up but who is
interested should see Schwartz at
the Men's Gym at once.
