# War-Time Welcome
## 
### 
TODAY Stanford officially greets its new president. There
will be no elaborate inauguration ceremony. There will be
no solemn procession of scholars in academic robes. Rather,
the faculty and students, both soldier and civilian, will gather to
hear Dr. Tresidder speak in Memorial Auditorium.
Because of the war, the usual formalities will not be present.
But the solemnity and deep 'importance of the occasion cannot
be touched by the lack of ritual and show. And we hope that
the spirit of sincerity and anticipation with which we greet our
president will only be enriched by the simplicity which sur
rounds his introduction.
