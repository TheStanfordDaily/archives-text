### BILL ROSE 
FOR THE SAKE OF THE ENGLISH GBADS
One of my classes this quarter is being held in the Briggs
Room. I wonder how many of you know where the Briggs Room
is. Better still, how many of you have even heard of it?
Now don't get me wrong. I like the Briggs Room. It has nice
overstuffed chairs and big comfortable couches. The point I'm
trying to bring out is that the Briggs Room is not normally a class
room—it is a lounge for English grad students. It is being used
as a classroom because of the shortage of space on the Quad
caused by the influx of Army students.
It seems to me highly unfair that the English grads should be
deprived of their lounge for even one hour of the day. After all,
a lounge is a pretty vital room for an English grad.
In order to remedy this situation, I herewith submit, with
comment, several suggestions of places on campus which could
be used instead of the Briggs Room and other graduate students'
lounges:
The belfry in Hoover Library—especially good for music ap
preciation classes.
The bottom of the fountain in front of the Libe—rather costly, as
would involve the use of diving helmets; but would afford an
excellent opportunity for a course in pisciculture. Or don't you
agree?
The Boathouse —at last something to justify its being there
Fall and Winter quarters.
That tower next to the fire house —must be good for some
thing.
The cactus gardens—an ideal spot for the course in Marriage
and the Home.
My room—there are no chairs in it (That's the truth!), but I'd
be glad to have my rug cleaned if it will help the University.
