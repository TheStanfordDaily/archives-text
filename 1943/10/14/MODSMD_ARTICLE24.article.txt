# German Youths Hurt by Defeat, Says Karl Bode
## 
### 
When the Germans are defeated,
young Nazis who grew up under Hit
ler will have more difficulty than any
other class in adjusting to defeat,
says Dr. Karl Bode, associate pro
fessor of economics at Stanford.
Dr. Bode's conclusions on the psy
chological considerations involved in
the peace are advanced in an article
entitled "Acceptance of Defeat in
Germany" published in the "Ameri
can Journal of Abnormal and Social
Psychology."
Socialist Working Class
The fact that the youth of Ger
many have carried the burden of the
actual fighting and probably have
acquired a deep revulsion to war
may make them accept the armistice
as the lesser of two evils, he added.
Members of the German working
class, however, will have little or no
psychological problem in adjusting
to defeat, he said, for most of them
were Socialists before the war. To
them the end of Naziism means the
return of freedom.
Leaders To Be Condemned
Dr. Bode believes the United Na
tions will have little trouble with
either the Nazi leadership or the
military leaders. The former group,
he says, will commit suicide with the
fall of their government, will be as
sassinated, or will be condemned to
death by Allied courts. Defeat will
be harder for the Army leaders to
take, because of their long tradition
of victory, but they can cause no
trouble if they have no military ma
chine to work with, he said.
The most difficult psychological
adjustments to make will be those of
the German middle class and intel
lectuals, he said. If the peace treaty
is too unjust they will acquire an
other "Versailles complex" which
may lead to a Third World War. He
suggested also that future peace
would be affected as much by the
time structure of the treaty as by its
severity â€” long drawn-out repara
tions keep issues alive. Immediate
sacrifice places the burden where it
should fall.
Papal Report Proposed
Voluntary restitution may replace
compulsory reparation on the part of
the Germans, Dr. Bode suggested, if
through a neutral and unimpeachable
agency they are given knowledge of
the moral debt of their country to the
rest of the world. He proposed a re
port by the Pope on Nazi rule in
Poland and a report by the Swedish
church on the occupation of Norway.
Dr. Bode received his degree from
the University of Berne. Switzerland,
and has studied in Vienna, Geneva,
and Cambridge. He has been at Stan
ford since 1937.
