ALLIED H.Q., South Pacific, Oct.
13.â€”Allied planes, carrying out the
heaviest raid of the war in the South
west Pacific, have dropped 350 tons
of bombs on Rabaul, crippling almost
two thirds of Japan's air strength at
the powerful New Britain base and
destroying or damaging more than
100 warships and large and small
merchant vessels and harbor ships, it
was announced today.
General Douglas Mac Arthur's
Thursday communique said 177 Jap
planes were destroyed on the ground
at Rabaul or shot down in combat.
Three destroyers and three merchant
ships, 43 seagoing cargo vessels and
70 harbor craft, a submarine tender,
and a 700-ton cargo vessel were
sunk, destroyed, or severely dam
aged.
"The enemy has sustained a dis
astrous defeat from the attack at
Rabaul," the communique said.
"With complete secrecy the mass
of our air force was concentrated and
launched against his air and naval
forces there using fields made pos
sible by our occupation late in June
of island groups north of New
Guinea. Recently we crushed the
right wing of his command at Wewak.
This time our objective was his left
wing at Rabaul."
The Allied airmen caught the en
emy unawares. His planes were on
the run when the raider struck, de
stroying 100 aircraft on the ground,
severely damaging 51 others, and
shooting down 26 of 47 which were
able to get into the air.
