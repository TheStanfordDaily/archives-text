# Students Sign For Crop Crew
## 
### 
Walnut pickers and boys to shake
the trees are needed urgently by the
Shumate Ranch this weekend. Crop
crews will work on four-hour shifts
Saturday and Sunday mornings from
8:30 to 12:30. Transportation will be
provided from the post office at 8.
Volunteers for this vital war work
are asked to sign up at once in their
living groups.
Chairmen in charge of crop crew
signups in the living groups are:
Beverly Leggett, A.O.Pi; Connie Mc-
Guire, Alpha Phi; Katherine Supple,
Chi Omega; Beverly Adams, Delta
Gamma; Julia Cook, Gamma Phi
Beta; Belle Keeney, Theta; Marion
Bush, Kappa; Betty Lou Terry, Pi
Phi; Jeanette Karn, Tri Delt.
In Lagunita Doreen Bailey is in
charge of Eucalypto; Pat May, Na
ranja; and Barbara Stofer, Granada.
Julia Bonnett will handle Roble and
Mary Lewis, Elm. Chairmen are be
ing appointed in the rest of the wom
en's living groups and in the men's
halls.
Barbara Pike, in charge of Crop
Ciews, urges that both men and
women students continue the en
thusiasm that was shown last year
by the walnut pickers. "If large
groups of girls sign up together,"
she said, "they will be sure of having
a good time working, and at the same
time will be earning some extra
money and helping the war effort."
