# Dr. Tresidder Presented to Students
## Informality Wins Record Audience 
### Vashti O'Donnell 
A tall, smiling man rose to greet
the associated students and faculty
for the first time since his assump
tion of the duties of president of
Stanford University yesterday in
Memorial Hall.
The students rose in acclaim, and
as he gestured for them to be seated,
a hush fell over the record audience
and each Stanford man and woman
wanted to hear the words of Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president.
The President's Part
"The University tries to combine
the strength of youth and age and
each must try to understand and be
tolerant of the traditional shortcom
ings of the other. I am prepared to
encounter the gap in age and reduce
its impact to its absolute minimum,"
he told his students.
"For my part, I shall try to stay
on the sidelines as much as possible,"
he said, telling of the relationship
between the president and students
at Stanford, "but if I cry out at times
you must realize it is only the cry of
a man who knows how close you are
to danger."
Dr. Tresidder then told, in his
quiet, informal voice, an anecdote
about one of his fishing trips in Yo
semite which well illustrated his
point that self-discipline is the first
lesson a free man must learn.
Purpose of Faculty
"It is the purpose of all of us at
Stanford," he said, "to offer you such
guidance and friendly understanding
as you are willing to accept."
Speaking directly to the students,
he said all would be easy if one could
always remember the simple rules of
living: consideration for others, sym
pathy for the less fortunate, and re
spect for the rights and opinions of
others.
He declared that for 52 years the
University has had one primary in
terest, interest in the citizen to be—
the leader of tomorrow, and that it is
"our hope that you will learn here
an attitude of mind."
Welcomes Soldiers
To the soldiers at Stanford, the
new president said, "We want you
to be a part of Stanford, and we hope
that before your education is com
pleted you will get to know Stanford
in peace time."
Dr. Tresidder completely won his
audience when, with a twinkle in his
eye, he asked, "Is it too old fashioned
to suggest hikes over the hills or
rides down the bridle paths in back
of campus to Redwood Canyon or
bicycle rides to Saratoga?—the fac


PRES. DONALD B. TRESIDDER
ulty do. Or is it even more old
fashioned to suggest evenings around
a fire with friends or books, or good
music to take the place of big-name
orchestras you have had to give up
for the war?"
Replaces Inauguration
In closing his address, which took
the place of a formal inauguration
ceremony, Dr. Tresidder said, "There
is one recognition I have hope of
earning and that is to have you in
stinctively consider me a Stanford
man when I walk down Quad. It is
because of you I am here."

Speaking directly to the students,
he said all would be easy if one could
always remember the simple rules of
living: consideration for others, sym
pathy for the less fortunate, and re
spect for the rights and opinions of
others.
He declared that for 52 years the
University has had one primary in
terest, interest in the citizen to be—
the leader of tomorrow, and that it is
"our hope that you will learn here
an attitude of mind."
Welcomes Soldiers
To the soldiers at Stanford, the
new president said, "We want you
to be a part of Stanford, and we hope
that before your education is com
pleted you will get to know Stanford
in peace time."
Dr. Tresidder completely won his
audience when, with a twinkle in his
eye, he asked, "Is it too old fashioned
to suggest hikes over the hills or
rides down the bridle paths in back
of campus to Redwood Canyon or
bicycle rides to Saratoga?—the fac


PRES. DONALD B. TRESIDDER
ulty do. Or is it even more old
fashioned to suggest evenings around
a fire with friends or books, or good
music to take the place of big-name
orchestras you have had to give up
for the war?"
Replaces Inauguration
In closing his address, which took
the place of a formal inauguration
ceremony, Dr. Tresidder said, "There
is one recognition I have hope of
earning and that is to have you in
stinctively consider me a Stanford
man when I walk down Quad. It is
because of you I am here."
Chancellor Emeritus Ray Lyman
Wilbur opened the all-University
assembly by introducing the Presi
dent of the Board of Trustees, Wil
liam P. Fuller Jr.
Former Presidents
Mr. Fuller presented Dr. Tresidder
to the faculty, board of trustees, stu
dents, and ASSU President Janet
McClanahan as a man well fitted to
succeed such three distinguished
predecessors.
A tall, smiling man rose to greet
the associated students and faculty
for the first time since his assump
tion of the duties of president of
Stanford University yesterday in
Memorial Hall.
The students rose in acclaim, and
as he gestured for them to be seated,
a hush fell over the record audience
and each Stanford man and woman
wanted to hear the words of Dr.
Donald B. Tresidder, Stanford's
fourth president.
The President's Part
"The University tries to combine
the strength of youth and age and
each must try to understand and be
tolerant of the traditional shortcom
ings of the other. I am prepared to
encounter the gap in age and reduce
its impact to its absolute minimum,"
he told his students.
"For my part, I shall try to stay
on the sidelines as much as possible,"
he said, telling of the relationship
between the president and students
at Stanford, "but if I cry out at times
you must realize it is only the cry of
a man who knows how close you are
to danger."
Dr. Tresidder then told, in his
quiet, informal voice, an anecdote
about one of his fishing trips in Yo
semite which well illustrated his
point that self-discipline is the first
lesson a free man must learn.
Purpose of Faculty
"It is the purpose of all of us at
Stanford," he said, "to offer you such
guidance and friendly understanding
as you are willing to accept."
