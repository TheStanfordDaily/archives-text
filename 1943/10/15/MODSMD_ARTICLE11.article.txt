# Daily Tryoutee Period Changed
## 
### 
Date of The Daily edit staff try
outee period has been moved up to
Thursday evening, Oct. 21, when Ed
itor Jane Glasson will meet students
interested in working for the Daily
and Barbara Stevens, staff editor,
will explain the intricacies of the
tryoutee period and the responsibili
ties connected with a permanent po
sition on the staff.
During a two-week period, try
outees will meet the managing edi
tor, associate editors, feature editor
and sports editor of the staff, who
will each outline the work in a par
ticular field of The Daily. Tryoutees
will be asked to give five hours of
work a week on the copy desk. In
preparation for this, Miss Stevens
will instruct in copyreading and
proofreading. Outside reporting will
also be asked so that the Edit Board
can make permanent appointments
based equally on writing ability, ac
curacy on the copy desk, willingness
and enthusiasm. At the end of the
two weeks appointments will be
made to the positions of copy reader,
head copy editor and reporter.
No previous experience is required.
Old students who would like to work
for the Daily, freshmen and transfers
who are interested in journalism or
in contacts with daily life of the Uni
versity will be welcomed.
