WASHINGTON—The Navy today
reported the loss of two new U.S.
destroyers in the Mediterranean and
also revealed that 10 Japanese bomb
ers attacked Attu Island ineffec
tually Wednesday in the first enemy
raid on the Aleutian outpost since
American forces recaptured it early
in June.
The 3-year-old destroyer, Buck,
was lost off Salerno Oct. 9, with
"Somewhat heavy casualties, and the
2-year-old destroyer, Bristol, went
down yesterday—both after under
water explosions. The Bristol casual
ties were moderate.
The Attu raid was aimed at the
Massacre Bay area and while no
damage was caused, U.S. interceptor
planes failed to bag any of the enemy
bombers.
