# Stanford Musical Hour Series To Begin on Sunday Afternoon
## 
### 
The first in a scries of Stanford Musical Hours will be held in Memorial
Church Sunday afternoon at 5 p.m., when D. Sterling Wheelwright, acting
organist, will present an organ recital with Sgt. Virgil Fox as guest organist
and Edna C. Wheelwright as soloist.
At the suggestion of Warren D. Allen, University organist now on sab-

batical leave, these programs, to be
held every Sunday and Thursday at
5 p.m., have been planned for the
enjoyment of the campus in general
but with special consideration for the
military students.
Service Men
The Thursday afternoon programs
will feature talented service men sta
tioned on campus as guest artists.
Although the late afternoon hour
was chosen to accommodate the mili
tary students, Mr. Wheelwright com
mented that the choice of time was
fortunate from a standpoint of beauty
since the horizontal rays of the after
noon sun streaming through the
stained glass windows make an ap
propriate setting for the swelling
tones of the organ music.
Mr. and Mrs. Wheelwright ar
rived recently from Washington,
D.C., where for six years they have
collaborated in presenting com
munity musicals at Washington
chapel.
Stanford Organ Praised
"The Stanford organ is noted for
its brilliance and thrilling power
and the church provides a colorful
setting unsurpassed for the enjoy
ment of music," said Mr. Wheel
wright.
Sunday's program will include two
meditations by Bach, French Rondo
by Boellman, and Vierne's first sym
phony. Mrs. Wheelwright will sing
O Del Mio Amato Ben by Donaudy,
Now Sleeps the Crimson Petal by
Quilter, and Homing by Del Riego.
