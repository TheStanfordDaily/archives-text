## EASTERN FOOTBALL Army and Navy Selected As Best Grid Teams in East 
### Roger Corman 
(Editor's nofe: This is the second of a series of articles hy Roger Corman
analyzing the top college football teams of the nation, section by section.)
Army
Take the speed of a P-3H, the maneuverability of a Spitfire, and the power
of a Flying Fortress, mix thein all together and you've got a striking force

about equal to this year's Army foot
ball team. After losing to Navy four
straight years the Kaydets are out
for blood, and should get it this sea
son. Coach Earl Blaik has scrapped
the old single wingback system and
come up with the tricky "T" forma
tion, which has resulted in the Black
and Gold roaring through its opposi
tion undefeated and unscored on.
Army has a powerful line, but the
back field is where the Kaydets really
shine. Behind the line are such
standouts as Tom Lombardo, George
Troxell, Doug Kenna, Max Minor,
Bob Woods, and Glen Davis, plebe
sensation from Bonita High School,
California.
Navy
Like Army, Navy is still undefeat
ed. The Middies have looked strong
in all their games, especially the 14 to
33 victory over Duke, top team in
the South. Hal Hamberg, 150 pounds
of Texas dynamite, is the big gun in
a tricky passing attack, while Grady
Gay. Hillis Hume, Roe Johnston, and
Joe Sullivan handle the other back
field chores.
Pen n
Pennsylvania, perennial Ivy
League champ, figures to repeat
again this year. With lopsided vic
tories over Yale and Princeton and a
hard fought 7 to G win from Dart
mouth already accounted for, the un
beaten Quakers are looking forward
to one of their most successful sea
sons in recent years. Joe Kane, hard
driving wingback, is the spearhead of
a powerful attack which includes
Johnny Noble and John Makar in the
backgfield and Walt Bubien, Bob
lYeabsley, and Hank Broderson on
the ends.
Dartmouth
Right behind Penn in the Ivy
League race is Dartmouth. With the
ene-point defeat from Penn their
only loss, the Indians have a well
balanced squad which emphasizes the
strong defense that has let only one
touchdown cross the goal line all
year. One of the most powerful lines
in the East is responsible for the fine
defensive showing, while Larry Bart
nick and Johnny Sayers are the best

of a better than average backfield.
Reviewing the field, the service
teams, Army and Navy, are far and
away the best, with Army rated a
slight edge over the Middies. Penn,
the only other unbeaten team in the
East, is the best of the civilian out
fits, but no match for the two leaders.
Dartmouth or Cornell have the
material, and with a few breaks
could pull an upset; while little
Rochester, bolstered by military per
sonnel, has a good record against the
smaller schools and may even give
the bigger teams a scare or two. Get
ting off to a bad start with a terrific
beating from Notre Dame, Pitt hasn't
shown much, but won last week in
convincing fashion, and may be the
dark horse of the season.
Here are the ratings of the Eastern
teams, not according to their records
to date, but according to their po
tential power.
1. Army.
2. Navy.
3. Pennsylvania.
4. Dartmouth.
5. Cornell.
6. Colgate.
7. Penn State.
8. Holy Cross.
9. Rochester.
10. Pittsburgh.

analyzing the top college football teams of the nation, section by section.)
Army
Take the speed of a P-3H, the maneuverability of a Spitfire, and the power
of a Flying Fortress, mix thein all together and you've got a striking force

about equal to this year's Army foot
ball team. After losing to Navy four
straight years the Kaydets are out
for blood, and should get it this sea
son. Coach Earl Blaik has scrapped
the old single wingback system and
come up with the tricky "T" forma
tion, which has resulted in the Black
and Gold roaring through its opposi
tion undefeated and unscored on.
Army has a powerful line, but the
back field is where the Kaydets really
shine. Behind the line are such
standouts as Tom Lombardo, George
Troxell, Doug Kenna, Max Minor,
Bob Woods, and Glen Davis, plebe
sensation from Bonita High School,
California.
Navy
Like Army, Navy is still undefeat
ed. The Middies have looked strong
in all their games, especially the 14 to
33 victory over Duke, top team in
the South. Hal Hamberg, 150 pounds
of Texas dynamite, is the big gun in
a tricky passing attack, while Grady
Gay. Hillis Hume, Roe Johnston, and
Joe Sullivan handle the other back
field chores.
Pen n
Pennsylvania, perennial Ivy
League champ, figures to repeat
again this year. With lopsided vic
tories over Yale and Princeton and a
hard fought 7 to G win from Dart
mouth already accounted for, the un
beaten Quakers are looking forward
to one of their most successful sea
sons in recent years. Joe Kane, hard
driving wingback, is the spearhead of
a powerful attack which includes
Johnny Noble and John Makar in the
backgfield and Walt Bubien, Bob
lYeabsley, and Hank Broderson on
the ends.
Dartmouth
Right behind Penn in the Ivy
League race is Dartmouth. With the
ene-point defeat from Penn their
only loss, the Indians have a well
balanced squad which emphasizes the
strong defense that has let only one
touchdown cross the goal line all
year. One of the most powerful lines
in the East is responsible for the fine
defensive showing, while Larry Bart
nick and Johnny Sayers are the best

of a better than average backfield.
Reviewing the field, the service
teams, Army and Navy, are far and
away the best, with Army rated a
slight edge over the Middies. Penn,
the only other unbeaten team in the
East, is the best of the civilian out
fits, but no match for the two leaders.
Dartmouth or Cornell have the
material, and with a few breaks
could pull an upset; while little
Rochester, bolstered by military per
sonnel, has a good record against the
smaller schools and may even give
the bigger teams a scare or two. Get
ting off to a bad start with a terrific
beating from Notre Dame, Pitt hasn't
shown much, but won last week in
convincing fashion, and may be the
dark horse of the season.
Here are the ratings of the Eastern
teams, not according to their records
to date, but according to their po
tential power.
1. Army.
2. Navy.
3. Pennsylvania.
4. Dartmouth.
5. Cornell.
6. Colgate.
7. Penn State.
8. Holy Cross.
9. Rochester.
