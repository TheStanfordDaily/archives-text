Series number one of the brain
trust pick on American football be
gins today and will run on subse
quent Fridays during football sea-
I son. Our predictions are based on
I previous games, national rankings,
j and—probably the main thing—in
tuition. Besides those, we visit our
favorite astrologers semi-weekly. We
promise our picks to be second-to
none in the nation —which nation,
we refuse to disclose.
The experts participating this week
include Ed Luce, former sports editor
j of the Stanford Daily; Barney Gugel,
| well-known review editor; Roger
j Corman, noted authority on national
football; and, last but not least, Don
Langendorf, acting sports editor of
the Stanford Daily.
California over their cousins from
Westwood, UCLA, by 12. We com
pletely agree on that.
Coast Guard over St. Mary's— not
| Pre-Flight—by 7. Again it's unani
mous.
Southern California taking it easy
over University of San Francisco by
at least 19. Call your own score.
Del Monte Pre-Flight over College
of Pacific by 7, with Corman going
overboard on Pacific.
Army over Columbia. Call your
j own, we say by 21, which makes it
j legal.
Navy over Penn State. Another
| close game; say about 19 points. Illi
j nois over Pittsburgh with complete
agreement by (i.
Notre Dame over Wisconsin by 20.
| A cinch.
Texas A & M over Texas Christian
with everyone agreed that the Aggies
! should win by 7.
Cornell to beat Holy Cross by 7,
| say the experts.
Indiana over lowa by 6. Expert
j Langendorf disagreed, but he was
overruled by the rest of the brain
-1 trust.
Minnesota over Camp Grant by a
| mere one point. In other words, it
will be very close. The vote by the
experts was split two and two, but
■ after some analyzing and quite a bit
of crystal gazing, the Minnesota Go
phers was picked to take Grant into
[ camp.
Great Lakes over Northwestern by
7, figuring Juzwik to be better than*
I Graham. Expert Corman cast the
dissenting vote.
Tulsa should beat Oklahoma by 6.
say three of the experts, but Gugel
elected to string along with the
! Sooners.
lowa State will ease through Ne
braska by a mere three points. This
was a tough one to pick for the ex
perts with the voting again split. We
examined the two teams thoroughly
and came to the conclusion that
lowa State will end up the game on
the long end of the score.
