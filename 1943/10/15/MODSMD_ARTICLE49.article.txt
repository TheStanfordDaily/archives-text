# Ventura Made Separate Unit
## 
### 
Casa Ventura, housing 50 first
quarter freshman women, is oper
ating this quarter for the first time
as a separate directorate apart from
Lagunita. The director, Mrs. Ida
Hueneryager, works immediately
with the Dean of Women's Office,
which gives Ventura an equal status
with Lagunita, Roble, and Union
Unit.
Mrs. Hueneryager, from the Uni
versity of Arizona, has already made
many friends since her arrival on
campus during Summer Quarter.
She is the sister of Miss Pat David
son, YWCA secretary.
Because of the lack of facilities,
Ventura women still eat in the La
gunita dining room. But for the first
time the unit has an integral feeling
of its own . . . not a feeling of being
a disjointed part of Lagunita. The
women, realizing the importance of
making a success of the new unit
have worked enthusiastically on the
gardens, which have a convenient
barbecue pit, and are making a ten
tative social program and expect to
have an open house for faculty mem
bers, for civilian students, and pos
sibly for military guests. They are
an extremely congenial group, ac
cording to Mrs. Hueneryager.
June Ellis, president of the unit, is
directing the establishment of rules,
regulations, and traditions. Margie
Dorris, Betty Kenny, Florence Edds,
and Marion Kirkpatrick are the
sponsors working with her.
