# Nazi Main Rome Defenses Crack as Allies Smash Across Volturno River
## 
### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERS.â€”In their most important victory
since the capture of Naples, Allied troops have cracked the main Nazi
defenses before Rome, hammering out bridgeheads across the Volturno
River on both sides of the main road to the Eternal City, which was now
less than 1(H) miles away, it was announced today.

(Berlin broadcasts acknowledging
that the Allies had established them
selves on the north bank of the Vol
turno said that several Allied war
ships supported the crossings by
standing off the estuary of the river
and hurling broadsides against
German positions inland.)
Smashing across the Volturno
with tanks, the Fifth Army won its
bridgehead north of Capua, and to
night men and machines were pour
ing across the stream to reinforce
the new springboard to come.
By special assault craft, ferries,
and even swimming, the Fifth Army
attacked across the Volturno the
night before last, official dispatches
said, negotiating the steep banks as
improved weather dried the mud
that had made the front a quagmire
for two weeks. A heavy two-day
artillery bombardment preceded the
assault.
The Germans, massed along the
Volturno in the straits of strength
of seven divisions, fought fiercely
to prevent the crossings, and, an
ticipating them, had attacked first
themselves, driving to the south
bank and into Capua before they
were hurled back and the powerful
Allied offensive began.
