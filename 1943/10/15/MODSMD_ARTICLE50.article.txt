# Crop Crews Will Work in Shifts
## 
### 
Barbara Pike, girl in charge of
Crop Crews, announced that the
quota for this week's pickers has
been more than filled and is pleased
with the cooperation shown by the
many volunteers.
Next week, instead of having one
four-hour shift of 40 members as is
the case this week, there will be two
shifts of 20 pickers in each group.
This change will help the men who
must supervise and empty the boxes.
Therefore both Saturday and Sun
day will have a four-hour shift in the
morning and one in the afternoon so
all who can pick in the afternoon
and who sign up for next week
please choose the afternoon.
Barbara Pike urges that both men
and women students continue the
enthusiasm that was shown last year
by walnut pickers. It helps the war
effort greatly and is a lot of fun
besides.
The person you should see to sign
up for picking is the chairman in
your living group. They are: Beverly
Leggett, A.O.Pi; Connie McGuire,
Alpha Phi; Katherine Supple, Chi
Omega; Beverly Adams, Delta Gam
ma; Julia Cook, Gamma Phi Beta;

ing appointed in the rest of the wom
