# Two Mates Make Double Trouble
## 
### 
'"Too Many Husbands," starring
Jean Arthur as the perplexed wife
of both Fred Mac-Murray and Mel
vyn Douglas, will be shown this Sun
day evening at 7:30 in the Memorial
Auditorium as the first of this quar
ter's Tillson Talkies.
The picture, which presents a new
slant on an old triangle, opens with
the homecoming of Fred Mac Murray
who returns from what was general
ly believed to be a watery grave to
find that during his absence his
"widow," Jean Arthur, has married
his best friend, Melvyn Douglas.
Amusing and only slightly censored
complications develop.
Accompanying attraction will be
the first chapter of a new and thrill
ing serial, "Secrets of Treasure Is
land," which promises to hit a new
high in entertainment and have noth
ing to do with Long John Silver.
