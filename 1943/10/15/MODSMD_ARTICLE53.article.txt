# Bond Booth Opens In Front of Cellar
## 
### 
The new red, white, and blue Wax-
Board Bond Booth opened yesterday
afternoon in front of the Cellar. Vic
tory maidens, Beverly Andreucetti
and Julie Cook, sold 179 stamps to
talling $44.75. This was only the first
day, and the War Board hopes for
and expects bigger and better results
in the future.
The booth will be open from 1 to
4:45 Monday, Wednesday, and Fri
day afternoons. Students are urged
to buy at least one and preferably
more stamps each week either at the
booth or in their living groups. Fac
ulty and soldiers are also invited to
stop at the bond booth and invest in
a stamp or a bond.
