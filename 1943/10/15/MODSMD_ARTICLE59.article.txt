# Hello, Dr. Tresidder
## 
### 
The following editorial, written by ex-Edi
tor Al Hampson, Jr., is reprinted from The
Daily, January 25, 1943.
DR. TRESIDDER is a Stanford man. He has
stood in line at the General Delivery win
dow. He has learned the spirit of sportsman
ship from Harry Maloney. He has hashed for
Mrs. Green and has shouted himself hoarse
giving the "Axe" yell at the Big Game.
He has put himself through Stanford and
knows her and what she represents. He knows
in what spirit she was conceived and in what
spirit she carries on.
Dr. Wilbur said about Stanford's next Presi
dent, "Dr. Donald B. Tresidder has a fine mind,
a fine spirit, and an appreciation of the true
values of higher education."
Stanford has had three great Presidents in
the past that have led her far in her first fifty
years. It is for Dr. Tresidder to continue to lead
Stanford to the best of her possibilities.
When you see Dr. Tresidder on the Quad,
say "Hello" to him, for he is a Stanford man.
