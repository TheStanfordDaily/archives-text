### BILL ROSE 
REAP THE WILD WALNUTS
Every day thousands of telephone calls,
telegrams, cablegrams and letters pour into my
office. They all concern the same thing and
ask about the same question, i.e., "What is
my part in the war effort?"
Most of the callers and writers tell me they
are already doing something to help out, but
they all want to do more.
A mother of seven small children writes that
she is now working the swing shift in an air
craft plant and the graveyard in a shipyard.
The combined salaries from these two jobs she
invests in war bonds. In addition to this she
makes surgical dressings for the Red Cross,
gives her blood three times a week, and acts
as hostess at her local U.S.O. on her night off.
Yet this little woman says,"I want to do
something which will make me feel that I am
taking a direct part in this battle for freedom.
I want to do my share."
I told her the only thing more she could do
was join the paratroops. But if there are some
among you who are having qualms of con
science about your part in the war effort, I have
an easier solution to your problem.
Help the harvest. Pickers and shakers are
needed by the nearby walnut ranchers. The

hours are short, the pay good. For details see
the crop chairman in your living group.

THE POETRY OF NUMBERS
"Just ten today,"
We used to say.
Then came the war;
We got but four.
To bring vict'ry
They made it three.
But don't be blue;
It could be two.
Before we're done
It might be done!
