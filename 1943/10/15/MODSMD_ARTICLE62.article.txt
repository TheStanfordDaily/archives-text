To the Editor: South Pacific
As we have long heard of the fame and glory
of Stanford, we've decided to write to your
co-eds and ask their help in our plight. Our
morale has been sadly neglected during our
stay on this most desolate island, and, as the
siege looks long and heavy, it sure will need
a great deal of boositng.
To us, there is nothing like mail and snap
shots for morale, and most of us would go with
out dehydrated potatoes for a few letters. This
is where your most beautiful co-eds could
come into play with their trusty pens and
paper. Thanking you and hoping to hear from
the co-eds in the very near future, we remain,
Servicely yours,
Pvt. Jack Noyes
Corp. Jim Duncan
Hq. Sq. Marine Air Group 21
Navy No. 60, c o Fleet Marines
San Francisco, Calif.
P.S. Please write Air Mail because it gets
here months earlier. We are both over six
feet tall, light brown wavy hair, blue eyes,
age 22.
