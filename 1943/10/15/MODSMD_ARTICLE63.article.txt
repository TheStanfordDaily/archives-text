# OPEN UP THE LIBE
## 
### 
To the Editor:
Since so many of the classes are in the
afternoon, especially those with the most out
side reading, why doesn't the Library open at
eight o'clock instead of nine? There never used
to be any difficulty in opening at eight; why
should there be now?
If the labor problem is bothering the Library,
why don't they apply to the War Board for
volunteers? The War Board is now furnishing
girls to work for the Army and at the Alumni
Office, the School of Humanities, the Poli Sci
Department, and in several other offices. If
they caxi supply the labor for these places,
surely the War Board can find enough people
so that the Libe can open an hour earlier in the
mornings.
Furthermore, why shouldn't the Libe open
on Sundays now. Since so many students are
taking more units, they have to study on Sun
days, and if the Libe is closed it often means
that they can't get the books which they need.
This situation will grow worse during the quar
ter. It will also mean that fewer people will
be able to use a book that is in demand since
one person can keep it out all week-end under
the present system.
The Libe ought to open on Sundays, and it
ought to open at eight o'clock in the mornings.!
If they can't get enough workers, why don't
they go to the War Board and get them?
We won't complain about the lights again.
We walk down to the Libe from the Education j
Building along the archway connecting them;
we're always nearly blinded by the brightfiess (
radiating from the engineering libe, but the
soft lights of the reserve book room are always
soft and comforting after the glare. No, we
won't complain about the lights. Please.
