# Yank Troops Push Ahead; Threaten German Rear
## 
### United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, Oct. 17.—Pounding ahead in two columns
in gains from 3 to 5 miles north of the Volturno, Allied troops today
squeezed and threatened to cut off a strong rear guard force holding out
along the Rome road and widened their bridgehead across the stream to
330 miles. *■
The main German forces were reported retreating to the next natural

defense line, along the Garigliadno
River—lB miles beyond the Volturno,
pressed relentlessly by the Fifth
Army.
One Allied column, driving up the
Italian west coast, reached a canal
five miles north of the Volturno in
a three-mile gain and spread out in
land; the other, pushing forward five
miles after heavy fighting along the
Titerno River, a tributary of the Vol
turno was advancing north of cap
tured Amorosi along the Volturno
valley where the river abruptly
swings to a northward course.
