# Staff Bats .800 on Forecast
## 
### 
Looking over the weekend's grid
results, we find that the Daily sports
staff did right well by itself in its
forecast. Four members of the staff
made 15 predictions apiece. Of these
GO predictions, 48 were correct, which
gives us a neat batting average of
.800 even.
Taking individual honors among
the experts was Roger Gorman, who
picked 13 out of 15 correctly. Run

ners-up were Ed Luce and Barney
Gugel, each with 12 for 15. Bringing
up the rear, with 11 right out of 15
tries, was Don Langendorf.
The two games which gave the ex
perts the most trouble were the De!
Monte Pie-Flight-College of Pacific
contest, which the Staggmen won,
16-7, and the Great Lakes-North
western game, which the Wildcats
won by a 13-0 count.
