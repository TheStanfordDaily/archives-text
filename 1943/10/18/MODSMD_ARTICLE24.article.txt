# A 						Common Bond

YOU might say the new president has been on probation in
the eyes of the students this past week. We've been watching
him closely, taking time to form definite opinions. Though polite
and respectful, we've retained an element of skepticism—even
though he is a Stanford man.
We heard him speak Thursday, and Friday we serenaded him.
Yesterday we listened to his address in the Chapel. And now
we can't help but be enthusiastic and completely satisfied.
Even more, we are pleased and grateful that such a man as
Dr. Tresidder has been chosen to guide us in these uncertain,
trying days. Spontaneously and genuinely, we admire and like
this rugged, friendly man. He has immediately and completely
won our hearts with his ready, sincere smile, his informal cor
diality, his full understanding of our youthful problems and
feelings.
Dr. Tresidder may be a great man, universally known, before
his career at Stanford is through. But even now, after his few
days here as president, he is great in the eyes of the students.
He has inspired us with complete confidence and loyalty —he
has established a common bond of understanding. Dr. Tresidder
has spoken of the great men of the University who have influ
enced his life. We know we will come to speak of him in the same
manner, for we realize we can learn much and benefit greatly
from his example—and we want to.
