CONGRATULATIONS, STANFORD!
To tell the truth, I didn't expect much in the way of anything
at the Tresidder sing Friday night. But when I arrived at the
Post Office a little after seven and saw that raucous and some
what forbidding throng of co-eds charging down Santa Theresa,
I knew everything was going to be all right. And it was.
Never since I've been at Stanford have I seen such a spon
taneous and wholehearted expression of school spirit. Every
one from the meekest frosh to the most seasoned senior seemed
to realize the importance of the occasion.
That tremendous body of humanity surging up the row, the
effervescent bursts of song, the absolute stillness when Dr.
Tresidder spoke, the impressive rendition of the hymn . . . these
will take their place in our albums of college memories.
As we walked down the hill singing "Goodnight Ladies," I
think even the most sophisticated collegiates must hvae eflt
they were now part of Stanford—the Stanford we've been told
about, the Stanford that isn't just the Quad or the Row or football
games, the Stanford in our minds and in our hearts.

Since there were no introductory remarks in my first column,
I think it's time I said a few things. First of all, this column —and
all the rest of the Daily for that matter—is open to suggestions
of any nature and from any source.
We know that nothing is perfect; so if you have criticisms,
please send them on to us. "And remember the Campus Opinion
column is open to anyone who signs his name to his letter—and
that will be withheld from publication on request.
As for this column in particular, we'd be plenty thankful for
any comments. And if any of you would like to take a flier at
writing a column, don't hesitate to send it in. If it's in English, we
might even print it. Just think of it, publication in the Peninsula's
only morning paper. lust think of it!
