## 
### 
"We of America must do every
thing that we can to help the Chinese
advance their educational program,
for through that advance will come
much of our own progress and that
of the other peoples of the Pacific."
This was the key point in the
speech given last week by Chancellor
Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur, which
was heard locally on Friday after
noon over station KPO. Dr. Wilbur
went to San Francisco on Sunday,
October 10, and spoke over a coast
to-coast hookup. The speech was
transcribed for later release here.
Oriental Universities
The program was one of a series of
dramatizations of interesting events
in the history of the Pacific, and was
called Pacific History.
Dr. Wilbur described the universi
ties he saw in China and in Japan
and the conditions which he noticed
while he was in those countries. He
began by telling of his visit to Nan
kai University. During the course of
this visit, the first president of Nan
kai University told Dr. Wilbur how
the idea of building the university
had come to him. and how, in the
face of great difficulty, he made his
dream a reality.
"I have never seen devotion
greater than that shown by the
members of the Nankai faculty nor
have I ever met more enthusiastic
and serious students," Dr. Wilbur

said.
Chinese Education
"I saw the difference, too. between
the Chinese brand of higher educa
tion, based on freedom, and the high
er education that was under the aus
pices of the invader as I had observed
it in Korea under Japanese domina
tion," continued Dr. Wilbur. He said
that this bright outlook for the fu
ture of China undoubtedly hastened
Japan's attack upon China and di
rected a definite part of this attack
to the destruction of all Chinese in
stitutions of higher education.
"The autocratic conqueror of a
country knows by instinct that his
greatest enemy is the university and
all that it stands for. Universities and
tyrannies do not go well together."
Heroic Efforts
Doctor Wilbur went on to tell of
the heroic efforts of the Chinese Uni
versities to continue their programs
in spite of the horrors of war and
the advance of the Japanese invad
ers. Entire universities were moved
to escape the invaders.
Chancellor Wilbur emphasized that
"Our future as a nation in the Pa
cific (and that really means our fu
ture) is wrapped up with that of
China. The United States and China
must work together, both to win the
war and to organize the economic
and social forces of the Pacific after
tlie fighting Ls over."
"We of America must do every
thing that we can to help the Chinese
advance their educational program,
for through that advance will come

the Chinese brand of higher educa
tion, based on freedom, and the high
er education that was under the aus
pices of the invader as I had observed
it in Korea under Japanese domina
tion," continued Dr. Wilbur. He said
that this bright outlook for the fu
ture of China undoubtedly hastened
Japan's attack upon China and di
rected a definite part of this attack
to the destruction of all Chinese in
stitutions of higher education.
"The autocratic conqueror of a
country knows by instinct that his
greatest enemy is the university and
all that it stands for. Universities and
tyrannies do not go well together."
Heroic Efforts
Doctor Wilbur went on to tell of
the heroic efforts of the Chinese Uni
versities to continue their programs
in spite of the horrors of war and
the advance of the Japanese invad
ers. Entire universities were moved
to escape the invaders.
Chancellor Wilbur emphasized that
"Our future as a nation in the Pa
cific (and that really means our fu
ture) is wrapped up with that of
China. The United States and China
must work together, both to win the
war and to organize the economic
and social forces of the Pacific after
tlie fighting Ls over."
"We of America must do every
thing that we can to help the Chinese
advance their educational program,
for through that advance will come
much of our own progress and that
of the other peoples of the Pacific."
This was the key point in the
speech given last week by Chancellor
Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur, which
was heard locally on Friday after
noon over station KPO. Dr. Wilbur
went to San Francisco on Sunday,
October 10, and spoke over a coast
to-coast hookup. The speech was
transcribed for later release here.
Oriental Universities
The program was one of a series of
dramatizations of interesting events
in the history of the Pacific, and was
called Pacific History.
Dr. Wilbur described the universi
ties he saw in China and in Japan
and the conditions which he noticed
while he was in those countries. He
began by telling of his visit to Nan
kai University. During the course of
this visit, the first president of Nan
kai University told Dr. Wilbur how
the idea of building the university
had come to him. and how, in the
face of great difficulty, he made his
dream a reality.
"I have never seen devotion
greater than that shown by the
members of the Nankai faculty nor
have I ever met more enthusiastic
and serious students," Dr. Wilbur

said.
Chinese Education
"I saw the difference, too. between
the Chinese brand of higher educa
tion, based on freedom, and the high
er education that was under the aus
pices of the invader as I had observed
it in Korea under Japanese domina
tion," continued Dr. Wilbur. He said
