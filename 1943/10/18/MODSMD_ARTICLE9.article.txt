# WACs Arrive, Occupy Ex-Presidential Mansion
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Every Stanford student knows the road that leads to the chimneyed
mansion on the hill above the campus with its view of the Quad, the bay,
and across the valley to the hills beyond. Now this palatial landmark where,
a short time ago, freshmen got lost on their way to meet Chancellor and
Mrs. Wilbur, is "home" to 17 WACs who will be Stanford students tempo-

rarily while they take a six-month"•
course in physical therapy.
Six of the WACs are from Fort
Des Moines, the rest are from the
field. They are mostly natives of
eastern and southern states though
there is a rumored southern Califor
nia native daughter.
Enlisted from colleges, business and
professional life, they have one thing
in common—a background of some
training in science which will be
valuable when they begin their
classes in anatomy, psychology, kin
esiology, massage, hydrotherapy,
medicine, and neurology, and the
psychology of the handicapped.
When they leave Stanford they will
begin a three-months' training per
iod in some hospital.
After their graduati6n they will
become second lieutenants in the
Army Medical Corps as part of the
Nursing Corps. Their work may be
overseas but will be in rehabilitation
for the most part.
Another group of WACs are ex
pected to begin the course here in
three months so that there will be a
group coming and one finishing the
practical work every quarter. Stan
ford academic credit will be given for
the courses.
Quartered two flights up in the
Wilbur home the tidy WACs have
already cleaned out the dust and
have straightened their rooms. Their
very military, olive-drab beds are
made up neatly. They have probably
the most unique quarters of any
Stanford women on campus.
They haven't all arrived and their
commanding officer will arrive today,
but the few who have been here long
enough to find the Union Residence
and public dining halls where they
go to mess, are enthusiastic about
California and Stanford in particular.
An LSU co-ed said, "I was pleased
with that, I'm more pleased with
this."
A former lab technician from New
York City was particularly happy to
have been transferred to Stanford
and is impressed with the view of
the Santa Cruz mountains from her
window. "Never having seen the
West before, I love it, especially the
warmth."
A corporal from Pennsylvania
thought Stanford the most beautiful
place she had ever been.
All love the Wilbur home, expect
to be spending most of their free time
"in books," but are hopeful that they
will see the Redwoods, the Golden
Gate, and other high spots in Cali
fornia. More particularly, they want
to meet Stanford co-eds and begin to
feel that they are part of campus life.
As one expressed it,"I don't know
whether we'll march to classes or
not, but it would be useful—that way
we won't get lost in this big place."
