# Graduates To Have Quad Pictures Taken
## 
### 
Students who are to graduate
this fall, winter, spring, and sum
mer are asked to come to the Quad
office to make appointments to have
their pictures taken. Appointments
will be made from Oct. 25 to Dec.
1, from 1 to 5 p.m. at the Nicholas
Johnston Studio located next to
Roos Bros, store in Palo Alto. If
an appointment is not kept, a fine
will be assessed unless a day's
advance notice is given.
In order to avoid delay, con
fusion, and the usually long lines,
appointments will be made at 15-
minute intervals; in that way, the
photographer will have time to do
better work. As there is not
enough film for everyone to have
an individual picture taken, non
graduates will be included in pic
tures of their living groups.
