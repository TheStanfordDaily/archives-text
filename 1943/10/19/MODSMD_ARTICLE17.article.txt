# Ten Volunteer To Give Blood
## 
### 
Ten students have volunteered to
donate their blood this Thursday, the j
first Blood Bank Day of the quarter. '
Twenty more are needed to fill the 1
quota for Stanford students. All
those wishing to be blood donors are
asked to sign up immediately in the
War Board office, Room 14 of the Old
Union.
Appointments have been set for j
11:20, 11:40. 1:20, and 1:40. Trans-]
portation will be provided to the
Blood Bank at the Community Cen
ter in Palo Alto for those who need
it.
Since students who are under 21 j
must obtain permission from their j
parents before being a blood donor,
only those who are over 21 will be
able to give their blood this week, j
but younger students may obtain
permission blanks for their parents
to sign in the War Board office. The j
only other requirements for donors
are that they must be in good health j
and weigh at least 115 pounds.
