What a time for the four brain
trusters over last weekend! Lots of
congratulations should be heaped on
sports expert Rog Corman for his
magnificent picks of Friday last. The
staff lost only two games over the
weekendâ€”Del Monte vs. College of
the Pacific and Great Lakes vs.
Northwestern. Corman was the only
member of the brain-trust to pick
the winners, Pacific and Northwest
ern. That's good picking Rog. By the
way, where did you get the crystal
ball?
Talking about Del Monte and COP,
the game next Saturday should be
one of the, best of the year and
should decide the championship of
the coast. Pacific takes on Southern
California down at the Coliseum. Be
fore the game this last weekend, we
thought Del Monte to be the best on
the coast. Because of Pacific's tri
umph, we'll take the Tigers over
anybody, and that includes USC.
Due to information arriving too
late for yesterday's edition, the aver
age for the brain-trust has risen. The
staff garnered 12 out of 14 for an
average of .858, which is much higher
than the .800 in the previous paper.
On the games that we thought would
be the tough ones to pick, the staff
came through with lots of glory. It
was on the two games that we
thought were cinches that we fell
through.
Students of Stanford are looking
forward to Nov. 13, when Stanford
plays Stanford in Memorial Stadium
at the home of the state school in
Berkeley. On that Saturday, the
University of California meets their
cousins from Los Angeles, the UCLA
Bruins. On the Bears starting team
are six Stanford men while there are
11 on the entire squad. The Bruins
have six former Farm men on their
team. Already interest is high on
campus. It would be swell if we
could buy a block of tickets for the
game and sit in a section of our own.
No matter who scores, Stanford wins.
We could have our own yells, our
own songs, perhaps even our own
band. After all, it was only yester
day that Boensch, Cox, Brown, An
drews, and the others were wearing
the Cardinal of Stanford instead of
the Blue and Gold of Cal and UCLA.
How about it? Shall we show these
former Stanfordites that we still re
member them? Shall we be down on
the field after the game to congratu
late these players as we did in the
days of the "Sons of the Stanford
Red?" Let's show OUR boys that
well-known Stanford spirit.
