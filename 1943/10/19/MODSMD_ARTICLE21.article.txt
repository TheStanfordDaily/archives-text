# Sports The Stanford Daily
## Sign Up Progresses In Six Mural Sports 
### Don Langendorf 
Mural signup is still progressing at a fair pace over in the men's gym.
Contrary to previous reports in the Stanford Daily, touch football will not
be the only sport involved the Autumn Quarter's intra-mural program.
Other sports include boxing, horseshoes, volleyball, tennis, and golf, making
six sports in all.
So far, not one team has taken the effort to sign the sheet for boxing.

! Only one team, the Theta Hashers,
has signed up for horseshoes. The
Theta Hashers are again the only
team to sign the register for tennis.
Volleyball boasts of two teams,
Dinah's and the T.H.'s have also
shown their intention of competing
In golf. Although these sports don't
get the publicity that football does,
they are quite as important as foot
ball.
i Boxing
Stanford is well known as having
j good boxers year in and year out,
but intra-mural boxing will be con
ducted as team competition and not
on an individual basis. The team
winning the most fights in each set
of matches will be declared the win
i ner.
!

The situation is the same in tennis
in that matches will be played on a
team basis. As tennis players are
plentiful on the Farm, there is no
no excuse for not having a team from
each organization.
Every man on campus has played
horseshoes at one time or another.
With this in mind, intra-mural
horseshoes is suggested for those
who like it. Here again, there should
be more than one organization with
an interest.
There should also be more of a
signup in both golf and volleyball. As
it now stands, there are only two
teams for each. Are the rest of the
houses going to forfeit all claim to
these sports? Let's hope not.
Football
Everybody seems to be pepped up
over touch football as an even dozen
teams have stated their intention of

fielding a team. Leading the list was
the Fillmore Floggers followed in the
order of signing by Dinah's, Tyler
Hall, Med School, Firehouse, McKin
ley Bashers, Fighting 0.M., Veritas
A.C., Wish Washers, the Stoates,
' Monroe Hall, and (he Theta Hashers.
With all these teams, the league
| should be very interesting, but this
â–  is only the beginning. There are sev
j eral houses yet to be heard from,
i The signup ends Friday with action
due to get under way sometime next
j week.
We may as well face facts that
j sports as far as inter-collegiate va
| riety are concerned is out for the
duration no matter what we do or
say about the situation. The only
sports left on the Farm are of the
intra-mural type, and we should
j take advantage of them. With this
in mind, let's get off the dime and
' sign up for these various activities.
