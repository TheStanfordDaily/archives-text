YESTERDAY 17 members of the Women's Army Corps came
to Stanford. The novelty of welcoming an equal number of
soldiers would be slightly worn by this time, but it is with
mingled curiosity and admiration that we greet you women in
uniform.
We have gotten used to seeing the major part of the male
student body in khaki and it will be easy to make you an integral
part of life on the Farm. We hope that instead of knowing you
as a group we will be able to meet and know all of you as indi
viduals.
Stanford is known as the Farm because of its traditions of
informality and friendliness and when we get through eyeing
you with curiosity and become used to your presence on the
Quad and walking up Lagunita Knoll, we feel sure you will find
this same friendship and respect that all Stanford people receive.
You are the newest members of our large family and we are
happy to welcome you as its latest addition.â€”Esther Belew
