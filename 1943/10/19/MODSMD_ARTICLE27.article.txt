To the Editor:
Most of the men in the ASTP units here on the campus are
complete strangers to California as well as to Stanford. Yet the
fame of the Stanford girls—that is, their beauty and hospitality
—has by no means been an unheard of thing in the other 47
states.
We have seen their beauty, but we're still a bit lonesome for
some of that "Southern hospitality" our girls back home are
showing some of the Stanford boys now on our own campuses.
Perhaps, I might add, a bit jealous too.
We have also seen that the same harvest moon shines over
the Stanford campus. These things —along with a bit of nostalgia
—make us want to walk hand-in-hand with a girl just once more,
for as you know, with some of us it has been rather a long time
since we have had that opportunity.
Can't something be arranged—not necessarily a rendezvous
for two; for we know the girls would like to look us over also.
Now take my unit for example. There are about 70 of us em
bryonic doctors just waiting to be adopted.
In times like these "war orphans" shouldn't be neglected,
should they- I know we would be forever appreciative if some
sorority or living group would be so kind as to take us under
protective wing. The morale here, as well as overseas, needs a
good boost. Couldn't charity start at home?
