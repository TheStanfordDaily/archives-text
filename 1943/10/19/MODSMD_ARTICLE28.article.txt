To the Editor:
I was very surprised when I read that there were going to ;
be six intra-mural sports this quarter, for I remember the diffi
culties that were encountered last quarter in trying to run one
mural sport, namely baseball.
As you no doubt remember, a large number of the halls were j
unable to get a full sized team together for a game and had to 1
borrow players from other sources. Besides, the interest was not
very enthusiastic.
Now, if one mural sport is just able to get by, how can any
body expect a mural program with six sports planned to be a
success? Wouldn't it be much wiser to have only a few mural
sports with a large number of students entered, than to have six
flops? Irred. j
