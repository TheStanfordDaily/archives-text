# Wallace Beery His Old Sell in Marines Film
## 
### 
SALUTE TO TIIE MARINES—Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
"Salute to the Marines" stars
Wallace Beery, who bellows and
blows through the film in a manner
that should delight the great com
pany of Beery fans. Wally keeps
coming on like "old man river" and
all concerned seem to love it.
Beery plays the role of a Marine
sergeant, long in the service, who is
eager for action, but ever gets it, ex
cept in saloon brawls. He is trans
ferred to the Philippines, where his
wife (Fay Bainter), a solid isola
tionist, rejoices when Wally is finally
discharged from the service. Wally
has a hard time keeping out of
trouble until the Japs pull their
sneaker. Then he takes command
and almost singlehanded destroys a
whole column of Japs.
"Salute to the Marines" is another
picture that wraps itself up in the
Hag and strives for the patriotic wal
lop. The plot has been told a thou
sand times but you'll probably enjoy
seeing our old friend Beery, blast
his leathery hide.
The second half of the bill is a
little number titled "Nobody's Dar
ling." It's a rather feeble attempt at
revealing the lives of the teen-aged
children of Hollywood movie stars.
Mary Lee has the title role and does
a good job in singing "It Had to Be
You" and "On the Sunny Side of the
Street."—Dick Bower
