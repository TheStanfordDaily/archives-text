The theme of '43 Gaieties (drop
ping the prefix "Big Game") will be
"Stanford's Gone G.1." OR "The
Army Hits the Farm," announced
Jean Levinson, director, as Colonel
Eden has given his permission for
members of the ASTU to participate
if their grades are passing. Soldiers
are therefore urged to write skits,
songs, and specialty acts picturing
the usual or unusual happenings in
the life of G. I. Joe.
Miss Levinson also asks that sol
diers work up something that they
can practice in their spare time as
rehearsals for them will be limited.
