# WAR BOARD
## Pledge Cards Due by Friday 
### 
Women students are requested by
the War Board to fill out pledge
cards by Friday, Oct. 22, volunteering
to do at least eight hours of war
work each month. Old students
must change their pledge cards to
fit their schedule this quarter. All
new students, who haven't done so,
are asked to fill out pledge cards this
week.
Students may either apply per
sonally at the War Board office to
change their cards, or telephone the
office.
War activities for which students
may volunteer include: crop crews,
office work. Red Cross, Nurse's
Aides, Motor Corps, Canteen, Ci
vilian Defense Courses, knitting, and
USO.
"This war work is really vital."
says Betty May Hale, SWB coordi
nator, who wishes that Stanford stu
dents- will devote their free time to
essential activity instead of to ''bull
sessions" and bridge. Some students
may not be able to work eight hours
a month because of a particularly
heavy schedule, but they are asked
to volunteer to work whenever pos
sible.
