### Laura Bertino 
Believing that the present conflict
is more than a battle among nations
but a conflict between ideas, repre
sentatives from 30 educational asso
ciations and 29 nations met recently
at Harper's Ferry, W.Va., under the
leadership of Stanford's Dean of
Education, Grayson Neikirk Ke
fauver, to discuss proposals for the
formation of an International Or
ganization for Education and Cul
tural Development. This meeting
has received nationwide attention.
The findings of the assembly in
cluded the adoption of four funda
mental propositions: the rebuilding
of facilities in devastated countries;
the reconstruction of education in
Axis countries; the establishment of
an international office to aid in the
international cooperation; and the
advancement of a program of world
citizenship.
Support Received
This concept of a worldwide sys
tem of education has won State De
partment support through recogni
tion of the need of understanding
other peoples as a basis for any sort
of cooperation. The rapid expansion
of knowledge, extension of com
munication, and the greater eco
nomic and cultural interdependence
are factors in this unprecedented
program.
The committee report commented
on the hope and fiorward-looking
spirit of the foreign educators, many
of whom have witnessed extreme
devastation but show total lack of
despair.
At the conference with Dean Ke
fauver, who has been granted an
indefinite leave of absence from the
University for this work, were Stan
ford Professors Paul Hanna, Isaac
James Quillan, and Paul Leonard.
More Meets Planned
Additional meetings of the assem
bly are planned so that steps toward
postwar intellectual cooperation will
have been taken before peace arrives.
Toward this end and following the
lead of the Harper's Ferry Assembly,
the United States officially moved
into the London meeting of the Uni
ted Nations education committee last
week. At this meeting a bureau was
proposed in which Russia, Great
Britain, and the United States would
have one representative each, while
large regions would have group
members. To supply liberated lands
with books, films, and laboratory
equipment would be the immediate
duty of this organization.
