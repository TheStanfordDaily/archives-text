# Practice Begins On Wilder Play Happy Journey
## 
### 
The cast for Thornton Wilder's
"The Happy Journey," to be present
ed by the Stanford Players as one of
three one-act plays on Nov. 10, 11,
12, 13, and 15, has launched into an
enthusiastic schedule of rehearsals.
Norman Philbrick is directing this,
the best-known of Wilder's one-acts.
Wilder won early prominence with
his novel, "Bridge of San Luis Rey,"
before he became known in theater
circles.
Wins Pulitzer Prize
"Our Town," his first successful
three-act play and winner of the
1938 Pulitzer Prize is perhaps best
known to the general public. It is
noted for its unique lack of stage
properties and for its simple, homey
atmosphere.
"The Skin of Our Teeth" followed
the 1938 success and resulted in
Wilder's being awarded the Pulitzer
Prize again this season. This play
also has novel stage construction
though in a different sense than
"Our Town." Complete with dino
saurs, it depicts a convention of
mammals in Atlantic City who es
cape a sudden flood in an arc, cre
ating a more complex situation than
"Our Town."
Yale Premier
"Happy Journey," premiered at
Yale, was one of Wilder's first at
tempts with the property-less type
ol play. Like "Our Town," it also has
a simple, homespun quality.
According to Mr. Philbrick, it is
remarkable that such a quiet person
as Wilder should have done such
revolutionary things, that such philo
sophical overtones and profundity
should still have such popular ap
peal. The experiment-loving author
is now a major in Army public rela
tions.
Season tickets for this and the
other two one-acts, "Hello Out
There," by William Saroyan, and
George Bernard Shaw's "A Village
Wooing," are on sale now in Room
202 in Memorial Hall and may be
purchased for $2.75. Over half of the
quota of 600 books haave already
been sold.
