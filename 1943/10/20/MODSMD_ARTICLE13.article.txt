# Illustrated Lecture Takes Audience on Alaska Tour
## 
### Jim Weinberg 
In the second of this quarter's Tuesday Evening Series, Karl Robinson
gave a highly entertaining and beautifully illustrated lecture on "Roads
North" last night.
It was the second appearance on the series for Robinson. Two years ago,
in a lecture delivered here shortly before Pearl Harbor, Robinson empha-

"sized the strategic importance of
Alaska in the fast-approaching war.
Last night he told of the opportuni
ties for motorists which lie ahead in
the days of peace.
The film began by taking the audi
ence from the Golden Gate Bridge,
up through Northern California,
Oregon, and Washington to Canada
and the Alcan Highway. Leisurely
stops were made along the way to
observe the scenic beauty of the
country and the inhabitants, both
humans and animals.
Mr. Robinson's pictures of the
wild life were especially good.
They included a sequence on the
building of a darn by beavers in
Oregon. The wonders of Crater Lake
in Oregon and Mount Rainier in
Washington were also shown.
Alcan Highway Shown
The second reel of the film was
concerned mainly with the Alcan
Highway itself. Army engineers
were asked to have the road ready
by summer, 1942, a seemingly im
possible task. They succeeded, how
ever, though the resulting highway
is not comparable to the smooth
roads in California. Convoys have
already gone through, but it will
take much reconstruction before ci
vilian motorists will be able to use
the highway for pleasure driving to
Alaska.
Mr. Robinson paid tribute to the
Negro soldiers who have done such
a fine job under adverse conditions
in the initial construction work.
Robinson's well-timed narration
was liberally interspersed with
humor.
