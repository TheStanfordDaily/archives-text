### 
WASHINGTON, Oct. 17â€”The Uni
ted States airfleet is now clearly su
perior to the enemy in both perform
ance and quality and has recorded a
combat advantage of roughly 4 to 1
for all theaters of war, the Office of
War Information reported tonight.
Plane production has been im
peded, OWI reported, by such serious
mistakes as faulty inspections, in
adequate supervision, and lack of
imagination by labor and manage
ment but in spite of this, official fig
ures show the Army Air Forces at a
loss of only 1,861 planes from the
start of the war to Sept. 1 set these
records:
Flew 223,758 sorties.
Dropped 105,649 tons of bombs.
Destroyed 6,312 craft.
Probably destroyed 2,196 planes
and damaged 2,535.
