# California Newsmen Visit Campus A.S.T.P.
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Nearly 50 men and women of the
Northern California press were on
the campus yesterday as guests of
the Army Specialized Training Pro
gram personnel. A day-long pro
gram designed to acquaint the news
men with the activities of the ASTP
began with an introductory panel of
talks in the Little Theater and ended
with guests hurrying in the sudden
afternoon rain to the Hoover War
Library for a topside view of the
Stanford Campus.
Col. John R. Eden, new com
mandant at Stanford welcomed the
guests in the Little Theater at 1000
(Army time). Col. George E. Arne
man spoke on behalf of the Com
manding General of the Ninth Serv
ice Command at 1002, thanking
Stanford for outstanding cooperation
with the Army. President Donald B.
Tresidder addressed the group,
characterizing Stanford as "an
agency of the armed forces," and he
observed that every department of
the University has been subordinated
to Army needs, but said, "We can
not lose sight of the fundamental
purpose of the University—the train
ing of young people. Our principal
interest will always be young people
who are trained to lives of dignity,
peace, and happiness, as well &s those
who are being trained to fight."
Dr. John Dodds, dean of the
School of Humanities, summarized
the history and work of the training
program and gave supplementary
statistics on the Army personnel. He
explained the need of Foreign Lan-

guage Area men to study not only
the language in which they specialize
but also the geography, economics,
religion, and a background of cus
toms, taboos, and motivations of the
people who speak the language. In
giving the men opportunity to study
in these supporting fields, all Stan
ford departments have worked to
gether and become more closely knit,
he said. The program has also indi
cated that subjects that were once
learned leisurely can be learned just
as well in condensed periods.
Throughout the day the press tour
clicked with Army efficiency despite
the unexpected rain. Pressmen sat in
on a 9L and a Malay Language Class
and heard "Tipperary" sung in Ma
layan. "Stanford" and "Palo Alto,"
were the two recognizable words that
brought laughs from the audience.
A caravan of Army cars carried
the visitors to mess in the Encina
Commons and inspection of the En
cina kitchens and living quarters of
Toyon Hall. They saw men go over
the hurdles in the obstacle course,
and watched a faultless squad do the
silent drill.
During the afternoon a formal
ceremonial review, impressive de
spite, or perhaps because of the rain
fall and military raincoats, was held
in the Stadium. Eight companies
passed before the stands marching to
the music of the Western Defense
Command Band from San Francisco.
Four of the companies stayed to give
a demonstration of mass calisthenics
directed by Harry Maloney.

Stanford Campus.
Col. John R. Eden, new com
mandant at Stanford welcomed the
guests in the Little Theater at 1000
(Army time). Col. George E. Arne
man spoke on behalf of the Com
manding General of the Ninth Serv
ice Command at 1002, thanking
Stanford for outstanding cooperation
with the Army. President Donald B.
Tresidder addressed the group,
characterizing Stanford as "an
agency of the armed forces," and he
observed that every department of
the University has been subordinated
to Army needs, but said, "We can
not lose sight of the fundamental
purpose of the University—the train
ing of young people. Our principal
interest will always be young people
who are trained to lives of dignity,
peace, and happiness, as well &s those
who are being trained to fight."
Dr. John Dodds, dean of the
School of Humanities, summarized
the history and work of the training
program and gave supplementary
statistics on the Army personnel. He
explained the need of Foreign Lan-

guage Area men to study not only
the language in which they specialize
but also the geography, economics,
religion, and a background of cus
toms, taboos, and motivations of the
people who speak the language. In
giving the men opportunity to study
in these supporting fields, all Stan
ford departments have worked to
gether and become more closely knit,
he said. The program has also indi
cated that subjects that were once
learned leisurely can be learned just
as well in condensed periods.
Throughout the day the press tour
clicked with Army efficiency despite
the unexpected rain. Pressmen sat in
on a 9L and a Malay Language Class
and heard "Tipperary" sung in Ma
layan. "Stanford" and "Palo Alto,"
were the two recognizable words that
brought laughs from the audience.
A caravan of Army cars carried
the visitors to mess in the Encina
Commons and inspection of the En
cina kitchens and living quarters of
Toyon Hall. They saw men go over
the hurdles in the obstacle course,
and watched a faultless squad do the
silent drill.
During the afternoon a formal
ceremonial review, impressive de
spite, or perhaps because of the rain
fall and military raincoats, was held
in the Stadium. Eight companies
passed before the stands marching to
the music of the Western Defense
Command Band from San Francisco.
Four of the companies stayed to give
a demonstration of mass calisthenics
directed by Harry Maloney.
Nearly 50 men and women of the
Northern California press were on
the campus yesterday as guests of
the Army Specialized Training Pro
gram personnel. A day-long pro
gram designed to acquaint the news
men with the activities of the ASTP
began with an introductory panel of
talks in the Little Theater and ended
with guests hurrying in the sudden
afternoon rain to the Hoover War
Library for a topside view of the
Stanford Campus.
