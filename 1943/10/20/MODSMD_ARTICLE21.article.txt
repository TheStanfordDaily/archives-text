# Women To Make Surgical Dressings
## 
### 
The Red Cross Surgical Dressing
Room is open every Monday, Tues
day, and Wednesday from 10 to 12
a.m. and 1 to 4 p.m. Women are
urged to volunteer to work there in
their free time.
Although the quota for this quar
ter has been lowered, the urgent
need for surgical dressings has by
no means diminished. Ruble women
have been very enthusiastic in vol
unteering, and other women students
are asked to follow their example.
This vital work will count as war
work, and is an excellent way for
women to fill their war-work pledge.
