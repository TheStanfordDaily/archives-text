We heard quite a bit of favorable
comment on yesterday's idea of a
rooting section at the California vs.
UCLA game in Berkeley on Nov. 13.
Every student we talked to was very
enthusiastic about it. One student
commented that the presence of
Stanford rooters would indicate that
the famed Stanford Spirit is not dead
but very much alive.
We would be very happy to see
letters from the students on the sub
ject to learn more the feeling of the
student body.
We were talking to a New Yorker
the other day on the merits of the
incomparable Angelo "Hank" Lui
setti. We discussed the team at the
time which consisted of Luisetti,
Stoefen, Calderwood, Lee, and Zonne.
He stated that he only saw Luisetti
once and lor his money, Luisetti was
the greatest player he has ever seen,
and he has seen them all at one time
or other in Madison Square Garden.
What surprised me however was his
statement that were it not for the
publicity that was given Hank, he

would think that Art Stoefen was
just as good. It so happened, how
ever, that Stoefen played as he never
played before during that series in
the East. In regular season ball,
Stoefen wasn't even good enough to
hold Luisetti's shoes. Now don't
think that Stoefen wasn't any good.
In fact he was. The thing was that
Hank was so much better than the
others, that there was no comparing
anybody else with him.
One thing that happened last week
is not understandable to us. That is
the firing of Merv Shea as manager
of the Portland Beavers. It doesn't
seem right that he should be fired
after bringing the Beavers up from
the cellar into fourth place.
