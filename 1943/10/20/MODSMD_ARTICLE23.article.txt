## Mural Sports To Start Next Week 
### 
Intra-mural signups are still com
ing along, rain or no rain. This
weather, however, isn't helpful at
all for practice sessions on the various
lawns throughout the campus.
During the regular season of intra
mural competition, rainy weather
will undoubtedly occur on days that
contests are scheduled. Certain
sports won't be affected by bad
weather although some will. The

ones that will be affected will be
postponed until the day of the next
scheduled games, which in turn will
move back the mural calendar.
Signups end Friday with play
slated to begin early next week. Fol
low the Daily sports page for com
plete mural data. Competition will
be found in golf, volleyball, horse
shoes, tennis, six-man touch football, i
and boxing. Sign-up sheets are still |
in the Men's Gym.
