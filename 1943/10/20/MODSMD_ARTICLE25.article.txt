# A 						New Understanding

YESTERDAY The Daily was fortunate enough to be included
on a comprehensive press tour of the Army Specialized
Training Program at Stanford. We sat in on classes, visited labs,
ate "chow," inspected dorms, and viewed men on the athletic
field from command cars. And it was the most fascinating and
instructive day we have spent at Stanford.
We wish it were possible for every campus civilian to not
only know what the Army is doing here, but to see how they
accomplish it. Our respect for the soldier-students increased
immeasurably. We have a true conception of the important
needs they can fulfill; we can sincerely admire the diligence
with which they master intensive courses of study.
And when we watched a class solving a problem in the
occupation of an island, we felt a new sense of prideâ€”our fellow
students in khaki here may soon be indispensable factors in the
winning of a peace.
