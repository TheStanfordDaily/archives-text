### BILL ROSE 
TO ERR IS HUMAN
The following, which is herewith printed without the author's
consent, arrived yesterday by slow freight. To anyone who read
last Friday's column, it should be self-explanatory:
What could be worse
Than to spoil a verse
By a careless mistake in your writing?
Instead of ONE,
You wrote the word DONE;
And hence this answer so biting.
Your column's so simple,
It looks like a pimple
On the face of the Daily so fair.
In your effort to be clever
You ruined my endeavor
Prepared with great forethought and care.
In the future I ask
That you tackle the task
By checking each word that you write,
So you won't lose the point
And louse up the joint
With words that sound stupid and trite.
In Calabasas are some
Who to Stanford will come
To conk Mr. Rose on the brain;
My dad will be there,
So tear out your hair
If you make a mistake agayne.
F. V., Calabasas, Calif.
