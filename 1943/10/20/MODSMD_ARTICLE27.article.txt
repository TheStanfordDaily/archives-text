To the Editor:
After five months on Stanford's campus as members of
ASTU 3905, a goodly number of us have grown to like the school
and the people who attend it. We were very disappointed in
our brother soldiers when we read the puerile letter from the
Pre-Medics of Company F.
Until we read this letter we believed the men in the ASTU
were adults in intellect and not merely juveniles. However, now
we wonder. We would like to remind certain parties that this is
not a Mission street corner.
We have found that soldiers who are not hopelessly socially
backward have little trouble in becoming acquainted on this
campus.
However, if any living group on campus wishes to adopt the
Pre-Medics of Company F, they're welcome to them.
Sincerely, Company E.
