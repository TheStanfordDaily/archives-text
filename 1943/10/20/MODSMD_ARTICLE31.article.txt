# School To Handle Ration Book No. 4
## 
### 
Stanford University has appointed
Mrs. Verlan Andersen to handle ra
tion books of all students eating in
University dining halls and will take
care of getting ration book four for
those who have turned in number
three to the University, according to
Dean of Men John Bunn.
Students who go home on week
ends may contact Mrs. Andersen in
her office in Room 13 in the Old
Union, and although no information
is yet available on book four, stu
dents were allowed two red points
from number three to take home on
weekends.
Book four must be applied for by
Oct. 22, and so those students who
have not yet turned in number three
are urged to do so immediately if
they wish the University to get the
new book for them.
Those students not living in Uni
versity dining halls may apply for
book four personally at the campus
school or may turn in number three
to their house mothers who may ap
ply for the new ration book for the
entire living group.
