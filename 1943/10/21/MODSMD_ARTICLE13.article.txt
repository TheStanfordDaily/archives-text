LONDON — Soviet troops driving
across the big bend of the Dneiper
today smashed five miles southward
toward the iron center of Krivoirog
and moved closer to Dnepropetrovsk,
threatening entrapment- for tens of
thousands of enemy troops in the
hook of the river.
Battering down German counter
attacks in Melitopol, guardian of the
main escape route from the Crimea,
Soviet troops captured several more
blocks in fierce street fighting.
