From Oran, Algiers, and Bermuda Mr. Robert D. Collyer has received a
wide assortment of camel-skin bags, sweet grass baskets, Arab sandals, for
eign money, and leather goods. For "this man's navy" is giving a new
education to his son, Ensign Robert D. Collyer Jr., Stanford '139.
Since his induction into the Navv in 1942, Ensign Collyer has seen active

service on the U.S.S. Stanton and
has made an interesting study of the
people and countries which he has
visited.
"The Arab people," he wrote, "are
particularly interesting. While an
chored in Algiers, I visited the Cas
bah. These slums — made known to
most Americans through the movie,
; Algiers'—are a place of unspeak
able filth and sanitary conditions."
On one of his sight-seeing trips to
: the French Foreign Legion Head
quarters, he met a small Arab boy,
an orphan who had lived in an army
camp all his life. This boy spoke
four languages. Most of the Arabs,
j Ensign Collyer wrote, are bi-lin
guists, and children learn English
during their early schooling. This
practice Ensign Collyer thought most
I commendable, and he sincerely re
gretted his inability to speak French.
Algiers is a modern city with an
opera house, a natural museum of
| history, and paved streets. The high
ways throughout the country are
very good. A familiar sight to be
seen on one of these highways is a
man riding a donkey while his wife
rides in a cart with the children and
j market animals, showing the wom
an's place of inferiority.
