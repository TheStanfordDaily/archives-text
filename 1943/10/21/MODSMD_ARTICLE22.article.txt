Tpoiorrpw will be a big day for
tlu- sports department. Things are
liable to pop that will sooner or later
be heard about throughout the na
tion. .This story might very well be
the most terrific thing to hit the
Farm all quarter, if not all year.
Don't miss it. It will be in tomor
row's paper.
Outside of the story mentioned
above, tomorrow's paper will feature
series number two of the brain-trust
pick of the major football games
throughout the nation. Remember
the great picks of last week? Well,
be sure not to miss this week's pre
dictions in tomorrow's paper.
On the West Coast there are still
four untied, undefeated football
teams. After this coming weekend,
there will be only two. The charmed
circle consists of March Field. Uni
versity of Washington, College of
the Pacific, and the University of
Southern California. Next Saturday,
Pacific comes face to face with the
unscored upon Southern California
Trojans in the Los Angeles Coliseum;
while in Seattle March Field comes
to grips with the Washington
Huskies.
Out of five games played. Pacific
has been the underdog in four. It
is quite conceivable that they will
again run onto the field with the
odds favoring their opponents. In
our opinion. COP has the best line
on the coast. In Amos Alonzo Stagg's
estimates, the Tigers have "the
greatest backfield I have ever
coached." That takes in quite a bit
of territory, for Stagg has been
coaching since the turn of the cen
tury and before, 54 years in all.
Don't sell the Trojans short, how
ever, as they have the fastest team
on the coast if not in the nation.
Operating out of the "T" as they do,
it is very easy to spring a man loose
on occasion. The problem is whether
Troy is fast enough to escape the
hard-charging McCaffrey and Klop
stien. That is hard to determine.
Look for our predictions tomorrow.
The game up north will also be a
thriller-diller, but will not receive
the publicity that the COP-USC
game will. Many believe that this
game and not the game in the south
will decide the coast champ. Take
your choice; we'll string along with
the winner in the south.

Troy is fast enough to escape the
hard-charging McCaffrey and Klop
stien. That is hard to determine.
Look for our predictions tomorrow.
The game up north will also be a
thriller-diller, but will not receive
the publicity that the COP-USC
game will. Many believe that this
game and not the game in the south
will decide the coast champ. Take
your choice; we'll string along with
the winner in the south.
Tpoiorrpw will be a big day for
tlu- sports department. Things are
liable to pop that will sooner or later
be heard about throughout the na
tion. .This story might very well be
the most terrific thing to hit the
Farm all quarter, if not all year.
Don't miss it. It will be in tomor
row's paper.
Outside of the story mentioned
above, tomorrow's paper will feature
series number two of the brain-trust
pick of the major football games
throughout the nation. Remember
the great picks of last week? Well,
be sure not to miss this week's pre
dictions in tomorrow's paper.
On the West Coast there are still
four untied, undefeated football
teams. After this coming weekend,
there will be only two. The charmed
circle consists of March Field. Uni
versity of Washington, College of
the Pacific, and the University of
Southern California. Next Saturday,
Pacific comes face to face with the
unscored upon Southern California
Trojans in the Los Angeles Coliseum;
while in Seattle March Field comes
to grips with the Washington
Huskies.
Out of five games played. Pacific
has been the underdog in four. It
is quite conceivable that they will
again run onto the field with the
odds favoring their opponents. In
our opinion. COP has the best line
on the coast. In Amos Alonzo Stagg's
estimates, the Tigers have "the
greatest backfield I have ever
coached." That takes in quite a bit
of territory, for Stagg has been
coaching since the turn of the cen
tury and before, 54 years in all.
Don't sell the Trojans short, how
ever, as they have the fastest team
on the coast if not in the nation.
Operating out of the "T" as they do,
it is very easy to spring a man loose
on occasion. The problem is whether
Troy is fast enough to escape the
hard-charging McCaffrey and Klop
stien. That is hard to determine.
