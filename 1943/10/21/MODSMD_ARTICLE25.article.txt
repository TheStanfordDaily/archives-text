### 
California was dealt a supreme
blow yesterday when it was an
nounced that Fred Boensch, Jim Cox,
and Bill Joslyn among others would
be lost to the team for the season as
they will be transferred elsewhere
next Saturday. Instead of going into
the St. Mary's Pre-Flight game as
favorites, the Bears are definitely

the underdogs as they face Bruce
j Smith & Co.
These three players formerly at
tended Stanford before they were
enlisted in the Marines. Joslyn was
injured in the UCLA game, so his
! loss will not be felt as badly as that
of Cox and Boensch.
