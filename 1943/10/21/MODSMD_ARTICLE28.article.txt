NOW that the first hectic days of registration
and bill paying are over, the organizations
on campus are beginning to issue their calls
.for tryoutees. This week The Daily, Quad,
Concert Series office, and War Board, have all
scheduled meetings and invited all interested
students, with or without experience for most
of the positions, to come and try out.
These opportunities should -be of special in
terest to freshmen and students who are new
to Stanford this guarter. This work is a good
way to meet people as well as to get a lot of
practical experience and fun.
Nearly all of the groups calling for tryoutees
are shorthanded at present and have excellent
positions for people who would like to work.
The wide variety of organizations gives an op
portunity for everyone to use his particular
talents, and there are many chances for ad
vancement.â€”Esther Belew
