# BULL SESSION

### BILL ROSE 
PLEASE. MR. VAN PATTEN
It was cold. The rain beat against the squares
of pavement in knife-like sheets. The narrow
colonnade offered little protection to the three
of us already there. We huddled close together,
trying to afford each other what little protection
we could.
As other grey-mantled figures emerged out
of the banks of falling water, we remained
silent. There were no friendly salutations, no
cheery Helloes. We stood there—cold and wet
and quiet.
Our group grew larger and larger till, like a
host of imprisoned specters, it filled the entire
colonnade. Still there was no sound. Steely
eyed and tight-lipped we waited—a single pur
pose in all our minds.
Suddenly a high, brittle voice broke through
the water-filled air. "I can't stand it!" it shrieked.
"I'm going mad. When . . . when ..." A moist

hand slipped over the maniac's quivering lips.
All was silent again.
A few of the apparitions drifted back into the
sleet—their heads bent in an attitude of defeat.
Most of us stayed on and waited . . . waited . . .
waited for that triumphant hour when the doors
would swing open and we would file quietly
into the Main Libe.

Now, I ask you, is there any reason why
such a scene as the above should occur? No,
I answer, absolutely, positively no! The Li
brary can and ought to open at 8 in the morning.
There's no need for the students to wait out
side until 9.
I am not advocating this change just for the
sake of griping. It seems to me, rather, that this
involves a benefit to the entire student body.
The University must realize that breakfasts
in most campus eating groups are over at 8
or before, so that the hashers will be able to
make their 8 o'clocks. This means that those of
us who get up for breakfast (We might as well
eat it if we're paying for it) and do not have 8
o'clocks have a free hour between 8 and 9.
No one will deny the great value of early
morning hours for clear, concise thinking and
working. Yet the morning is usually a poor
time for study in our living groups. If we can't
go to the Libe, nine chances out of ten we will
waste that hour.
Can't something be done to remedy this situ
ation? If only the Reserved Book Room were
opened, it would be some satisfaction. How
about it?
