Editor's Note: The Campus Opinion column
is for the use of any reader who wishes to
express an opinion, gripe, criticism, or com
pliment. The Daily will publish letters which
might interest the campus at large, but no
letter will be published which is not accom
panied by the author's name and address.
This information will be withheld on reguest
if a pseudonym is also provided.
To the Editor:
When an injustice occurs to an individual or
a group, it is the American custom to weigh
both sides of the case and then pass judgment.
In our opinion an injustice has occurred; so the
following facts are submitted for the followers
of this column.
In the Tuesday issue of this paper an article
appeared that supposedly represented the
opinion of the Pre-Medics of Company F. In
actuality we were undoubtedly the most sur
prised group on the campus. We were, as can
be understood, quite indignant on finding our
selves the authors of such a childish article.
It can truthfully be stated that only the author
and the publisher were aware of the content or
existence of the article.
We were inclined to let the matter drop and
accept the ridicule that naturally resulted. Then
on Wednesday an article was printed that was
of injurious nature, accordingly we were forced
to reply out of self-respect. We hope that this
reply has made clear that an individual, not a
group, was responsible for the original article,
r The 69 other Pre-Medics of Company F.
