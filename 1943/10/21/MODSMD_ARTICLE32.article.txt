To the Editor:
In order to put the blame where the blame
is due, I wish publicly to acknowledge having
written the letter published Tuesday, Oct. 19.
Totally without the knowledge of the body of
the medics of Company F was it written. I
humbly apologize for it and for the embarrass
ment it has caused both the Pre-Meds of Com
pany F and the other men in the ranks here at
Stanford. To you all—the ASTU's—I apologize
and hope the matter will be quickly forgotten.
Pfc. James F. Hooker,
Pre-Medic, Company F.
