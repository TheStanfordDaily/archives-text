# German Line Falls Back As Allies Advance on Rome With Capture of 17 Towns
## 
### United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERSâ€”The Germans were reported
fleeing tonight to a new defense line only 83 miles from Rome, burning
farms and shooting cattle and even civilians as Fifth Army troops pursued
them across the northern arm of the Volturno loop in a seven-mile drive.

The Germans were shifting abrupt
ly to a north-south line from their
shattered lateral position on the
lower Voltumo. This left a tempo
rary gap in their central Italy de
fenses and to divert pressure from
that sector the Germans launched
powerful counterblows against the
British Eighth Army on the Adriatic
front, but all were turned back.
All across the Italian front, now
shortened to 95 miles, the Allies
gained from five to seven miles and
captured 17 more towns, including
Gragoni, on the south bank of the
upper Volturno, which American
troops took in a stifl fight. Without
pausing, the Americans splashed on
across the shallow stream under
withering machine gun fire and es
tablished positions on the north bank.
It was this American advance
along the upper Volturno, threaten
ing to veer west and cut the Rome
road, that forced the Nazi's eastern
Italy army to begin a general re
treat to a new 22-mile line stretching
from Mondragone to Venafro beyond
the northern arm of the river.
