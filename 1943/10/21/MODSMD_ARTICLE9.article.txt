# Stamp Drive Opens Tonight
## 
### 
War stamps will be sold tonight in
each living group by the stamp
chairmen. This is the first Stamp
Day of the quarter, and living groups
are asked by the War Board to make
a special effort to obtain 100 per
cent contributions.
Women students are asked to buy
one or more stamps each week of the
quarter, but men students are being
asked to buy $3 worth of stamps now.
This is the equivalent of buying one
25-cent stamp each week and is a
method that proved very successful
this summer in the men's halls.
The War Board Bond Booth has
been open in front of the Cellar and
has sold $275 in stamps and bonds.
Students, soldiers, and faculty are
urged to continue patronizing the
Bond Booth where Stanford Victory
Maidens will be selling stamps and
bonds Monday, Tuesday, and
Wednesday afternoons from 1 to 5.
Beginning next Monday the Bond
Booth will sell war stamps of all
denominations instead of only 25-
cent stamps. Beverly Andrucetti is
in charge of the Bond Booth, and
Joan Hall is head of the living group
stamp chairmen.
