### United Press 
LONDON, Oct. 21â€”Soviet troops
cleared the center of embattled Meli
topol. isolating German forces in the
northern part of the city, while other
Rod Army units south of Kremen
chug drove to within 23 miles of the
iron and communication center of
Krivoirog.
Battling German units that often
consisted only of tanks and self
propelled guns, without infantry sup
port. the Russians smashed the Ger
mans back from the cathedral area,
clearing the entire central section of
Melitopol.
The Germans are "holding the
northern part of the town and suf
fering enormous losses in manpower
and materials" in their stand-or-die
defense of the guardian city of the
Crimea, a Russian communique re
ported. Both north and southwest of
Melitopol, the last obstacle to an
assault on the Crimea and the Dnie
per, across open steppes land in this
area, the Soviets dislodged the Ger
mans from a number of defense
points.
An indication that the Germans
might be evacuating the Dnieper-
Petrovsk sector came in a Berlin
press dispatch to Stockholm.
"The situation in Kremenchug,"
northwest of Dnieperpetrovsk, the
dispatch said, "may without exag
geration be described as particularly
grave and it is likely soon to force
the Germans to withdraw still far
ther westward to avoid encircle
ment."
