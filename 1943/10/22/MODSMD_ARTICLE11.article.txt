# Players Will Give Shaw's One-Act
## 
### 
Critics have said that 87-year-old
George Bernard Shaw has lost a lot
of the fire for which the red-headed
Irish reprobate has long been fa
mous, but according to F. C. Strick
land, who will direct the Stanford
Players in one of the playwright's
best-known one-acts, "there are a
few valuable sparks left."
The fire was all there when Shaw
wrote "A Village Wooing," which
will be presented with William â€¢
Saroyan's "Hello Out There," and
Thornton Wilder's "Happy Journey,"
on Nov. 11, 12, 13, and 15 in the
Memorial Auditorium.
The Shaw play has some of the
best of the author's quips. The great
remarks that he couldn't get in his
other plays have all been included in
this incomparable piece which has a
spicy, typical humor, an amusing,
but completely inconsequential plot,
commented the director.
Strickland was once invited to
Reed College to direct this play,
which he characterized as not really
a play, but a conversation piece. It
isn't like most of Shaw's great re
form works but is an attack on the
romantic ideal.
"A Village Wooing," was pre
miered at Dallas after the vogue for
one-acts was past so that it has been
neglected rather than overdone.
"St. Joan" was the last of the Shaw
plays done at Stanford. The reper
toire of this master of salt and pepper
Irish wit, who doesn't believe in
anything, yet believes everything,
and who has respect for nothing, has
been popular with the theater public. !
