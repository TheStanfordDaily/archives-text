## 
### 
"The Humanities Look Ahead," a compilation of the speeches presented
at the First Annual Conference held under the auspices of the Stanford
School of the Humanities on May 7 and 8, 1943, has just been published.
Containing the speeches of such famous contributing authors as Ray
Lyman Wilbur, Frederic Spiegelberg, Lynn T. Jr., and many more

delegates from the far western ,
states, this pamphlet presents many '
enlightened opinions about our pres
ent world situation.
Of particular interest to most peo
ple today would be Dr. Spiegelberg's
"The Japanese Mind and the West
ern World." Said Dr. Spiegelberg,
"A Study of Bushido will reveal to
us the three main characteristics of
the Japanese mentality: first, an in
feriority complex; second, a lack of
individuality; and third, the dangers
that are implied in the achievement
of a highly detached attitude toward
life."
Speaking of China in regard to the
study of humanities, Dr. Ch'en Shou-
Yi stated, "When the Occidental
world thinks of the humanities, it
leaves out habitually and unknow
ingly the cultural heritage of exactly
one-half of humanity; for it is true
that literally up to yesterday West
erners discussed such subjects as
world art, world philosophy, and i
world history, as if Eastern Asia
had not existed at all." He went on
to plea for more full-fledged depart
ments of East Asian studies in
American colleges.
John W. Dodds, dean of Stanford's
School of Humanities, declared in his !
welcome address to the conference, !
"Our responsibility is great; but so !
is our opportunity. Future of hu- j
manistic education will be carved out
in the interstices of a global war. |
We must prepare for the future we j
want or the future will not bother to !
ask us what we want."
