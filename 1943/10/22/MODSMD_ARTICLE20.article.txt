is high in proportion to those enrolled from other colleges, since the total
11 nmher of trainees is less than 400.
A letter from one of the former Stanfordites, enclosing the article, reveals,

"If the truth must be known, the
hoys from the Farm are the leaders

IS CALIFORNIA STILL IN THE
UNION? OR STANFORD COMES
TO COLORADO COLLEGE
California is a large territory west
of the States of Nevada and Arizona.
Although its physical boundaries are
restricted by the necessary geologi
cal limitations of the earth, its influ
ence, any Californian will tell you,
is boundless.
Ask any Californian about his
country. You will be amazed at the
manifold qualities it possesses. Cali
fornia, any Californian will be glad
to tell you, has the sunniest sun, the
cloudiest clouds, the coldest cold,
the hottest heat, the windiest wind,
the rainiest rain, the bluest blue sky,
the highest mountains, the lowest
valleys, the most desolate deserts,
the most fertile farms, the largest
orchards, of any section of the world.
Another amazing phenomenon in
this mystical territory located just
west of the States of Arizona and
New Mexico, is a thing called Los
Angeles. Los Angeles is neither a
city, state, or country. It's animal,
but it's also vegetable and mineral.
Los Angeles is known by several
other names, namely, Hollywood,
Westwood, Pasadena, Eagle Rock,
L.A., and the like. This amorphous
mass is known to extend westward to
at least Honolulu, for several keen
eyed observers have noted signs near
the Islands setting the westernmost
limits of Los Angeles there. Up un
til July 1 its easternmost boundaries
were unknown, but several score
creatures from this territory located
just west of Nevada and Arizona
were spied planting a sign stating
"Los Angeles City Limits" on top
of Pikes Peak, near Colorado
Springs, Colo.
The territory located just west
of Nevada and Arizona also contains
the most intellectual institutions, the
most collegiate colleges, the most
unusual universities. A typical ex
ample of one of the most collegiate
of colleges is a substance known as
Stanford. This substance is really
not a college at all: nor is it a uni
versity. It is difficult for an illiterate
(Stanford slang for a non-Stanford
man) to put his finger on just exactly
what Stanford is. It may be com
pared with Colorado College. It has
championship football teams; yet it
isn't an athletic establishment. It
has a brilliant faculty; yet it isn't an
intellectual institution. It has fra
ternities and college life; yet it isn't
a Joe College. It lias beautiful girls.
It is a misnomer to call California
one of the United States. California
has everything, it seems, and con
siders itself as a something to be
emulated. It doesn't desire a 47-
state millstone around its neck. The
main reason the second front in Eu
rope was delayed for so long is sim
ply this: California had just got
around to declaring war on the Axis
this winter!
