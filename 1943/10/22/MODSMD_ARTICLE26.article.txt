# Time Now to Get Ration Book Four
## 
### 
Today is the deadline for those
students who have not yet turned
in ration book three and who are not
now eating in University dining halls
to secure ration book four; they
must apply in person at the campus
school to obtain their books.
Mrs. Verlan Anderson, secretary in
charge of ration books, will be on
hand in Room 13 of the Old Union
today to issue books to all students
