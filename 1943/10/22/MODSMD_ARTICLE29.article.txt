# Terman Tot Wins Success, Carves Bust of Professor
## 
### Jim Ford 
"Success doesn't depend entirely on intelligence."
This was the statement made yesterday by Lewis M. Terman, professor
emeritus of psychology, who is concluding a 22-year survey of 1,300 gifted
children whose development he began to study at Stanford in 1921.
During his years of research, watching the progress of the children whom

he called Terman Tots, Professor
Terman noticed that high mental
ability alone does not guarantee suc
cess, but that other qualities such as
personality and enthusiasm are im
portant.
Mrs. Betty Ford Acquina, one of
the Tots, who graduated from Stan
ford at the age of 17, in 1930, and
attained success as a sculptress in the
United States and abroad, returned
to the campus last month to carve a
bust of Terman, who has observed
her progress for over 20 years.
Although Professor Terman hesi
tates to discuss any individual Tot,
he explained that Mrs. Acquina had
studied sculpture in Germany and
Austria following her graduation
from college. She has held many
exhibits of her work, and one of her
pieces was on display at the 1940
World's Fair.
When Professor Terman first se
lected his 1,300 gifted children in
1921, he gave them various mental
and personality tests, which he fol
lowed up six years later, in 1927,
with retests. During the last four
years he has carried on a more ex
tensive follow-up on the group, and
he is now compiling the material of
this study in a fourth volume of his
book, "Genetic Studies of Genius."
The results of Terman's extensive
research reveal that the Tots' in
telligence placed them in the top 1
per cent of the population. In addi
tion, their physiques were announced
by physicians to be above average.
In all school work, the group rated
very high, and most of them attended
college, even though it was during
depression days. They graduated
from college with high honors more
frequently than other students.
Most of the Tots married, and have
produced a total of 800 offsprings,
600 of which Professor Terman has
tested. The divorce rate has been
very low among them.
In nearly every case, Professor
Terman's Tots have achieved suc
cess, and often eminence, although
Terman admitted that even in such
a group as his there were some
failures.

Most of the Tots married, and have
produced a total of 800 offsprings,
600 of which Professor Terman has
tested. The divorce rate has been
very low among them.
In nearly every case, Professor
Terman's Tots have achieved suc
cess, and often eminence, although
Terman admitted that even in such
a group as his there were some
failures.
"Success doesn't depend entirely on intelligence."
This was the statement made yesterday by Lewis M. Terman, professor
emeritus of psychology, who is concluding a 22-year survey of 1,300 gifted
children whose development he began to study at Stanford in 1921.
During his years of research, watching the progress of the children whom

he called Terman Tots, Professor
Terman noticed that high mental
ability alone does not guarantee suc
cess, but that other qualities such as
personality and enthusiasm are im
portant.
Mrs. Betty Ford Acquina, one of
the Tots, who graduated from Stan
ford at the age of 17, in 1930, and
attained success as a sculptress in the
United States and abroad, returned
to the campus last month to carve a
bust of Terman, who has observed
her progress for over 20 years.
Although Professor Terman hesi
tates to discuss any individual Tot,
he explained that Mrs. Acquina had
studied sculpture in Germany and
Austria following her graduation
from college. She has held many
exhibits of her work, and one of her
pieces was on display at the 1940
World's Fair.
When Professor Terman first se
lected his 1,300 gifted children in
1921, he gave them various mental
and personality tests, which he fol
lowed up six years later, in 1927,
with retests. During the last four
years he has carried on a more ex
tensive follow-up on the group, and
he is now compiling the material of
this study in a fourth volume of his
book, "Genetic Studies of Genius."
The results of Terman's extensive
research reveal that the Tots' in
telligence placed them in the top 1
per cent of the population. In addi
tion, their physiques were announced
by physicians to be above average.
In all school work, the group rated
very high, and most of them attended
college, even though it was during
depression days. They graduated
from college with high honors more
frequently than other students.
