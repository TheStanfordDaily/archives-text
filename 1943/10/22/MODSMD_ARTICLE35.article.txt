# Pfc. Maurice Forshaw Plays Carillon in Hoover War Libe
## 
### 
Your reporter took an interesting tour yesterday. The guide was Pfe.
Maurice Forshaw, probably known to most as "the man who plays the bells
in the Hoover Tower." The tr.'p was to the belfry and console room of the
Hoover Libe.
Maurice Forshaw is a 20-year-old native of La Jolla, Calif. He began

his music career at an early age with'
piano lessons, and at the age of 15
began a study of the organ. His
training was continued at UCLA,
where he sang in the a capella choir
and played the glockenspiel, or bell
lyre, in the Bruin football band.
In March 1943 the Army ERC
called Maurice, and after his basic
training, he entered Stanford as a
STAR. He is now in the foreign area
and language unit, majoring in
French.
Church Organist
During Summer Quarter, Pfc.
Forshaw acted as organist for Me
morial Church. When Mr. Lefevre,
who used to play the carillon, left to
play the large 52-bell carillon in the
Riverside Church, Warren D. Allen,
former organist and head of the
music department, now on leave of
absence, asked Maurice ii he had any
desire to learn to play the bells.
Naturally the soldier jumped at
the chance, for bell playing is a rare
and unique art. And that is how
Maurice got his start. The tour of
the bell tower began, oddly enough,
in the main hall on the first floor,
where we noted the inscription tell
ing the history of the bells.
Bells Cast in Belgium
They were cast in Belgium in 1939
for the Belgian Pavilion at the 1939-
40 New York World's Fair. The
carillon is a gift to Stanford Univer
sity from the Belgian American Edu
cational Foundation as acknowledg
ment of the work done by Hoover for
Belgian relief following the World
War.
Then my soldier guide introduced
this reporter to "Mo," the ever
present, highly efficient, automatic
elevator boy. The bells are located
in an especially constructed steel
frame on the 14th floor. They num
ber 35, and cover a range of three
octaves. They range in size from
one about the size of a pei'son's head
to the largest, about three feet in
diameter, which has been nicknamed
'"Hai'ry E."
Console Room
Directly under the belfry is located
the console room, where Pfc. For
shaw explained the workings of the
carillon as consisting of hand and
foot levers, connected directly by
wires to the bell clappers. There are
two banks of levels, the lower cor
responding to the white keys and
the upper to the black keys on a
piano, plus a bank operated by foot
below.
Fortunately the carillon console
resembles that of the organ in many
ways, and Maurice was able to learn
quickly by marking the handles with
tape. By mid-July he was picking
out his first tunes. Now he can play
almost anything, since, he said, the
carillon is a surprisingly versatile
instrument.
The bells are now being used as
church call, as well as for evening
concerts. Every Sunday morning
Pfc. Forshaw will give a concert on
the carillon immediately before the
31 o'clock service in the Memorial
Church.
