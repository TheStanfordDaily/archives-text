VICTORY THROUGH AIR POWER
—Now playing at the Stanford The
ater.
"Victory Through Air Power,"
Walt Disney's latest full-length fea
ture, is a technicolor picturization of
Major Alex de Seversky's much dis
cussed novel of the same name. The
film traces the development of avia
tion from the Wright brothers to the
present day and presents de Sever
sky's theory of winning the war by
long-range bombing.
"Victory Through Air Power" is a
unique as well as an informative ex
perience. It really brings this com
plex problem of war down to the
common man. Disney does little
flag waving but instead strives to
give convincing support to de Sever

sky's attack by air theory.
The color effects in the picture are
truly spectacular, at times being even
dazzling. Most of the film is done in
animation, with the remaining por
tion being given over to interviews
of Major de Seversky. "Victory
Through Air Power" is a salute to
Billy Mitchell and the pioneers of
aviation.
The second feature, "Passport to
Suez," deals with the adventures of
the dapper Lone Wolf, as played by
Warren William. The "Wolf" chases
down a group of spies who have de
signs against the Suez Canal but
puts most of the theater to sleep in
doing so. What you'll need for this
one is a passport to the nearest exit.
