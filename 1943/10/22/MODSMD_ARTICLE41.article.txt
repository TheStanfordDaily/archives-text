We're sorry about the comment in
yesterday's paper aboul the big story
about to break. As you know, it
didn't break. It will definitely break
early next week, so watch for it.
Today we bring to you edition
number two of the brain-trust pick.
As you all know, the brain trust con
sists of Ed Luce, former Daily sports
editor; Barney Gugel, review editor;
Roger Corman, Daily sports analyst
and noted authority on national
football; and yours truly, Don Lan
gendorf. In case you haven't heard
about last week's pickings, we came
through with 12 out of 14 for the
high percentage of .858. We aren't
saying that our know-all, see-all
crystal ball tells all, and that we
will repeat our great accomplish
ment of last week, but we do say
we will do as good as any other
so-called expert in the country, we
hope. But enough with this trite and
on with the prognosticating!
To start the day off right, the
brain trust takes the College of the
Pacific over Southern California by
a mere three points. Realizing that
the Trojans are unscored upon, Rog
Corman elects to pin his hopes on
U.S.C. and thereby out-pick the
rest of us. The question is: Can
C.O.P. halt the speed of the Tro
jans? The answer to that gives us
the winner of the game.
March Field versus the Washing
ton Huskies again offers us quite a
problem. After much consultation
back and forth, Corman and Luce
took March Field, and Gugel and
yours truly picked Washington. As
far as the record book goes, the
trust stands by March Field to win
by one point. It can and may go the
other way.
St. Mary's Pre-Flight gets the nod
in our estimation over California by
at least seven points. It will take
at least two weeks of practice be
fore Cox and Boensch can be ade
quately replaced. Besides St. Ma
ry's has Bruce Smith. 'Nough said.
There is no doubt in our minds
that Del Monte Pre-Flight is by far
a better team than the University
of San Francisco. Make it by about
26 points. Could be higher still.
Another big deadlock came with
the decision on the game between
Indiana and Wisconsin. Gugel and
yours truly thuoght Wisconsin to be
better because of the benefit of the
coaching of Harry Stuhldreher, one
of the members of the four horse
men. Luce and Corman stuck ob
stinately to Indiana, so this col
umn's choice goes to Indiana by one.
One of the day's best games in the
Mid-West,
Ed Luce decided to stick his neck
out and take Minnesota over Michi
gan, but the rest of the brain trust
elected to stick by Daley,' Hirsch &
Co. in the expectation of seeing
Michigan win their first game from
the Gophers in a decade and there
by win back the Brown Jug. By 7.
The brain trust figures that Cor
nell should have little trouble in de
feating Colgate, even with Andy
Kerr coaching, by at least seven.
Purdue merely has to go through
the actions in piling up a decisive
victory over Slip Madigan's lowa
team. Purdue should win in their
own sweet way by thirteen.
The pick of Notre Dame over
Illinois is just a game to raise our
average. They are a cinch by 27.
Another high scoring tussle should
he the contest between Pennsylva
nia and Columbia, with Penn the
winner by 19.
Northwestern should have little
trouble taking Ohio State into camp
