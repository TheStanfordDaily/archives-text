(Editor's note:—This is the third in
a series of articles by Roger Corman
analyzing the top footliall teams ot
the nation, section by section.)
Mighty Notre Dame, undefeated,
untied in four starts, rates as the top
grid team in the Midwest. With no
college in the country capable of
competing with them on anywhere
near an even basis, the Fighting Irish

with thirteen points to spare.
Although we all accepted Navy
to beat Georgia Tech, it will be
exceedingly close. We came to the
conclusion that about three points
would separate the two teams.
Army is figured as a cinch to de
feat Yale by as much as they please.
We put down eighteen points.
Texas is expected to escape with
out much damage at the hands of
Rice. They' should breeze through
by about 18.
Our concluding pick is Great
Lakes over a weak Missouri team
by about seven. It may turn out to
be a rout though.

rank as one of the greatest squads
ever to come out of South Bend. So
lar the Irish have rolled over all op
position with ease, high spot of the
season being the 35 to 12 walloping
they handed Michigan.
Angelo Bertelli, certain All-Amer
ican for the second straight year, is
the big gun of the Notre Dame pass
ing and running attack, while Julius
Rykovich, Creighton Miller, and Jim
Mello furnish a powerful supporting
cast .
Michigan
Michigan has only one defeat on its
otherwise perfect record. The beat
ing the Wolverines took from Notre
Dame cost them a lot of prestige, but
they still rate as one of the top teams
in the nation. Sparked by Elroy
Hirsch, Bill Daley, and Captain Paul
White, the Michigan offense packs
plenty of power and speed, and may
bring the Wolverines the Big Ten
championship.
Purdue
Purdue's Marine-manned Boiler
makers are smashing through all op
position this year. Unbeaten in five
starts, the Engineers are a top con
tender tor Big Ten honors and could
finish ahead of Michigan. Tony But
kovich, Marine transfer, is the
sparkplug of the speedy backfield
that operates behind the protection
of one of the strongest lines in the
country.
Northwestern
Beaten only by Michigan, North
western may have the squad that
will break the string of lean years
the Wildcats have seen lately. Hard
driving Otto Graham is the man to
watch in the backfield and could
make All-American.
Minnesota
After a year away from the spot
light, Minnesota is roaring back into
the circle of top grid teams. The
Golden Gophers look like the Min
nesota teams of old and with Bill
Garnass at quarter could upset the
dope and take the Big Ten title.
Looking them all over, Notre Dame
rates as the leaders, way out in front
and with no competition. Michigan
is the best of the other schools, but
isn't in the same class as the Irish,
who will finish the year as the top
team in the nation.
Here is the way they rate, not ac
cording to their records to date but
according to their potential power.
1. Notre Dame.
2. Michigan.
3. Purdue.
4. Northwestern.
5. Minnesota.
6. Marquette.
7. Indiana.
8. lowa.
9. Illinois.
10. Wisconsin.

Mighty Notre Dame, undefeated,
untied in four starts, rates as the top
grid team in the Midwest. With no
college in the country capable of
competing with them on anywhere
near an even basis, the Fighting Irish

with thirteen points to spare.
Although we all accepted Navy
to beat Georgia Tech, it will be
exceedingly close. We came to the
conclusion that about three points
would separate the two teams.

We put down eighteen points.
Texas is expected to escape with

Our concluding pick is Great

by about seven. It may turn out to
be a rout though.

rank as one of the greatest squads
ever to come out of South Bend. So
lar the Irish have rolled over all op
position with ease, high spot of the
season being the 35 to 12 walloping
they handed Michigan.
Angelo Bertelli, certain All-Amer
ican for the second straight year, is
the big gun of the Notre Dame pass
ing and running attack, while Julius
Rykovich, Creighton Miller, and Jim
Mello furnish a powerful supporting
cast .
Michigan
Michigan has only one defeat on its
otherwise perfect record. The beat
ing the Wolverines took from Notre
Dame cost them a lot of prestige, but
they still rate as one of the top teams
in the nation. Sparked by Elroy
Hirsch, Bill Daley, and Captain Paul
White, the Michigan offense packs
plenty of power and speed, and may
bring the Wolverines the Big Ten
championship.
Purdue
Purdue's Marine-manned Boiler
makers are smashing through all op
position this year. Unbeaten in five
starts, the Engineers are a top con
tender tor Big Ten honors and could
finish ahead of Michigan. Tony But
kovich, Marine transfer, is the
sparkplug of the speedy backfield
that operates behind the protection
of one of the strongest lines in the
country.
Northwestern
Beaten only by Michigan, North
western may have the squad that
will break the string of lean years
the Wildcats have seen lately. Hard
driving Otto Graham is the man to
watch in the backfield and could
make All-American.
Minnesota
After a year away from the spot
light, Minnesota is roaring back into
the circle of top grid teams. The
Golden Gophers look like the Min
nesota teams of old and with Bill
Garnass at quarter could upset the
dope and take the Big Ten title.
Looking them all over, Notre Dame
rates as the leaders, way out in front
and with no competition. Michigan
is the best of the other schools, but
isn't in the same class as the Irish,
who will finish the year as the top
team in the nation.
Here is the way they rate, not ac
cording to their records to date but
