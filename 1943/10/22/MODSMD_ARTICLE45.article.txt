# Military Commencement
## 
### 
rn OMORROW morning Stanford will have a
JL chance to see its first military commence
ment when 30 officers in the Civil Affairs Ad
ministration course receive certificates from
Colonel Eden.
Faculty, students, and the general public
are invited to attend the exercises in the Edu
cation Auditorium, so it is hoped that these
Stanford trainees will have a good audience.
There are several reasons why civilian stu
dents should be particularly interested in the
event. Not many people here have had a
chance to see a military commencement; with
regular Stanford commencement exercises held
but once a year, many students graduating in
summer, fall, and winter will never see Uni
versity graduation exercises; with over half our
student body in uniform, there should be a nat
ural interest on the part of civilian students in
the affairs of "the other half."
