# Contested Social Life
## 
### 
THERE seems to be a great deal of contro
versy, centering in the Campus Opinion
column, concerning the role of soldiers in the
social life of the University.
Perhaps not everyone is aware of the some
what elaborate social calendar prepared and
directed by the ASSU. Dates for campus events
are arranged through social chairmen repre
senting all women's living groups and com
panies of soldiers. Dances and jolly-ups are
given to provide a suitable meeting ground for
soldiers and women.
And this quarter most of the women's living
groups are holding open houses several times
a month to which different groups of soldiers
are invited. These informal get-togethers have
proved popular with both groups concerned,
and as the quarter progresses, they will be
more frequent.
It is rather difficult for some 1,400 women at
tending school to entertain all the men on the
campus. Most people, realizing this, are satis
fied with the social program as it stands.
