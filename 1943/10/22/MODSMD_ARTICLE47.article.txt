### BILL ROSE 
APOLOGIES TO HENRY LUCE
As it must to all college campuses, war has
come to tile-roofed, sun-baked, tradition-hal
lowed Stanford University.
Long noted as an educational country club
for children of the west coast's rich and promi
nent, fun-loving Stanford, located 35 miles
south of San Francisco on what Californians like
to call The Peninsula, is now the home of more
than 3,000 soldiers enlisted in the Army's ASTP
and other educational training programs.
After war broke out, Stanford caused many
a lifted eyebrow in higher educational circles
with the establishment of a School of Humani
ties under the aegis of swarthy educauthor,
lewis Mumford. Rumors that Stanford was not
doing its part rippled the U.S.'s otherwise glassy
academic surface.
However, when it came time for Stanford to

swing into action, she did so with maximum
effectiveness and minimum cahotage. And
Lewis Mumford's Humanities proved them
selves not a little useful in the shift to a war-time
program.
With the change in Stanford's body has also
come a change in its head. Last week, before a
packed assembly of civilian and military stu
dents, tall, dignified, ex-Secretary of Interior,*
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, the University's Chan
cellor since Jan. 1, 1942, and its President for
25 years before that, bowed quietly out. His
successor: Dr. Donald B. Tresidder.
Gangling, grey-wisped, Carl Sandburg-like
Don Tresidder, Stanford's fourth President,**
is a Stanford man. He is a graduate of the Uni
versity and of its justly renowned School of
Medicine. He has long been associated with
its alumni activities.
As an able outdoorsman, Dr. Tresidder is
well equipped for lordship of his new domain—
Stanford's sprawling 9,000-acre campus. As a
man, confidence-inspiring Dr. Tresidder is
ideally suited for fathership of his new family
—Stanford's 5,000 war-time students.
Bull Session wishes Stanford and its new
President all the luck they deserve in their
new careers as militant defenders of democracy.
* Under ex-President Herbert Clark Hoover.
Others: Nature-loving David Starr Jordan;
beaver-bearded geologist, John Caspar Bran
ner; Dr. Wilbur.
