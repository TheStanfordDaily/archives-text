# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
The Stanford "women" feel that there is a
serious problem on the campus â€”unnecessary
bad-feeling between the Stanford girls and the
Army units. We do not want the boys to leave
Stanford with a false impression. This should
be brought to light NOW!
First, the best thing for us girls to do is to
define our position on the campus. It is cor-1
rect to suppose that the majority are spending
these days to study and prepare for the post
war work in the reconstruction days to follow.
It has always been a Stanford tradition to be
friendly and greet fellow students with a sin
cerely warm "hello." Now the Army boys here
should be no exception to this rule. But the
women of Stanford are today overwhelmed by
the vast numbers which flock along the Quad !
and up the Libe steps. It is plain to realize that!
it will demand adjustments from all students.
However, we want to be friendly as we have
always been and we want it taken in the right
spirit. As for some of the Army boys branding :
us as snobs, we think it is rather unjust, absurd,
and a poor defense on the part of a few mal
contents.
We want the boys to answer this one:
At this time, your "Mission street" attitude:
discourages our natural impulse to be friendly,
so when we smile and say "hello" will you I
understand it as a FRIENDLY gesture or merely
misinterpret it as a "come-hither" PICK-UP?

To the Editor:
We have followed the turmoil taking place
in the Campus Opinion the past few days with}
acute amazement. At this point, we should like
to pose a few questions.
What has happened to the sense of humor I
of Company E, Company F, and the ASTU's
in general? Although we fully realize that I
Stanford is at war, is that any reason to com
pletely obliterate all traces of the lighter side
of life?
It has been reputed since time began that
the male species stick together in time of crisis.
Why hasn't Company F got the intestinal forti- i
tude to stand behind the member in question? I
We agree that '"war orphans" should not be;
neglected. In short, while being perfectly will
ing to let Company F fend for themselves, we
should be delighted to adopt Pfc. Hooker.
