# Tyler To Give Ball Saturday
## 
### 
Taking a cue from October on the
Farm, Tyler Hall has planned a
Harvest Ball for this Saturday night.
The dance which will be held from
9 until 1, is the first social function
to be held by one of the men's living
groups this quarter.
The dance is open to the whole
campus, but is a date affair. Social
chairmen for the various Army units
have been notified that soldier stu
dents with dates are invited.
Corn stalks, farm animals, fruits
and vegetables will be used as deco
rations. Since the moon will not ap
pear, the necessary harvest moon is
being improvised.
Appropriate dress for the fellows
will be jeans and plaid shirts, while
gingham dresses or jeans and pigtails
should be worn by the girls. Cos
tumes, however, are not required.
Adding to the harvest atmosphere,
Tyler men will call for their dates
and drive them to the hall on a hay
rack.
Chairmen of the dance are Dick
Hyde and Jack Taylor, retiring and
incoming social chairmen of the
group. Bud Gates and Fulton Camp
are arranging decorations, while Bill
Warren and Ralph Miller are plan
ning the refreshments.
