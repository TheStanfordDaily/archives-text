## 
### 
Little did Dede Bergerot and Bar
j bara Porter suspect the luck to be
theirs at Tyler Hall. They were
there to give a pep talk on war bonds
and stamps. No sooner did Dede and
I Barbara stop speaking than one
freshman, Ralph Miller, stepped up
and put down 75 silver dollars. All
told, the 33 men of Tyler Hall con
tributed $10ti. over 1,283 per cent of
their quota.
