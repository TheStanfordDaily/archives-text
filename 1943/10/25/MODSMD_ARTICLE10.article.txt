Carol Hurwitz is in charge of the
redecoration and will work with Mrs.
Sam Morris of the Stanford Mothers'
Club. The decoration committee will
consist of Ruth Larsen, Gail Good
win, Joyce Costello, Bobbie Upshaw,
Elizabeth Liesk, Janie Hart, Nancy

The new Canteen will continue to
be open the same hours as the Nitery
with the exception that special par
ties are being planned for the sol
diers who are free Saturday and
Sunday.
