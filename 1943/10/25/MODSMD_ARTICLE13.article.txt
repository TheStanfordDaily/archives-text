Colonel Means Talks
"Your days as desk commandos are
over," Colonel Means said to the offi
; cers, warning them of the responsi
| bility they will bear as representa
j tives of the United Nations. He de
scribed them as the real ambassadors
| to the people of the reconquered or
: occupied territories.
"You will have the difficult job of
: carrying the principles of the Four
Freedoms into the everyday lives of
the people," Colonel Means told the
; graduates. "The military government
which you will help to administer, if
badly handled, can be a grave mili
tary liability," he cautioned.
Tresidder Speaks
Dr. Tresidder called on the new
' administrators for "objectivity, gen
erosity, wisdom, thoughtfulness, and
respect for the people of the con- |
quered countries."
Scoring rumors that the Army, in
conducting civil affairs training I
| schools, plans to set up a series of
military governments, Colonel Means \
said, "It should be made clear that
; civil affairs is a function of command, j
; primarily military in character. Gov
ernment is not the business of the
United States Army once the fighting
! is over."
