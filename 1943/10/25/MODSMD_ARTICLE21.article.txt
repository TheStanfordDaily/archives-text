The Daily sports experts failed to
repeat last week's success in picking
the fotball winners. They only got
12 out of 15 games right this week,
and this gives the experts an .827
average for the season.
Expert Roger Corman again out
picked his colleagues and kept his
individual average up at .931. The
other individual records are: Gugel,
.827; Langondorf and Luce, .793.
The big stumbling block for the
experts this week was the USC vs.
College of Pacific battle. Corman
was the only holdout for the Trojans
and not only picked the winner, but
the score, 6-0. The sports staff was
also fooled on the Cornell-Colgate
game, Colgate walloping the Ithacans
in a surprising upset. The experts
made their third and last mistake on
the Washington-March Field game.
This column has called attention to
a big story that was supposed to
break early this week. According to
the latest information, tine chances
are that we will have to keep our
silence until the end of the week.
