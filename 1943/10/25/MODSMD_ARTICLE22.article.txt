# State Recognizes Salvage Committee
## 
### 
The Stanford Salvage Committee,
which is headed by Martha Austin
and John Carr, has recently been
awarded a certificate of recognition
from the California State Salvage
Committee in Sacramento. This year,
according to Miss Austin, the com
mittee will endeavor to obtain even
more cooperation from the living
groups and other campus residents.
The central salvage depot for stu
dents not living in University resi
dences will be at the Corporation
Yard as it was Summer Quarter.
These students are asked to turn in
their salvage Nov. 6.
