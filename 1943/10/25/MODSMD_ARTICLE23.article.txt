The "get-acquainted" tea held last
, Friday afternoon in the Women's
| Clubhousef or the benefit of new
j women students who wished to
! meet the "Y" cabinet was attended
by a larger group of girls than in any
I previous year according to Muriel
Tarr, social chairman in charge of
i the affair.
Guests Present
Miss Anastasia Doyle, Dean Mary
Yost, ASSU President Janet Mc
i Clanahan and Vice-President Peggy
Boothe were present at the tea,
which was held in connection with
the "Y" drive.
Members of the "Y" Cabinet will
meet Wednesday to present plans for
J the quarter's activities in the various
interest groups in which YWCA
| membership entitles girls to partici
| pate.
These groups include sections on
such current problems as "Race
Problems," "World Affairs," and
"War Marriages." Speakers promi
nent in each of these fields will be
available to address the meetings of
j the interest groups and conduct open
forum discussions on subjects of
; present-day importance.
Worthwhile Work
"Comparatively few girls who take
out 'Y' membership cards are active
in all 'Y' affairs, but in this type of
organization it pays to be able to
take part in even a few of its activi
ties," said Miss Pat Davidson, "Y"
director.
Among the prominent faculty
members who spoke at "Y" meetings
last year were Dr. Irwin Abrams,
who talked on the activities of the
Quakers; Professor Phillip Buck,
whose subject was "The War
Fronts"; and Professor Graham
Stuart, who discussed the practical
applications of the Good Neighbor
Policy.
