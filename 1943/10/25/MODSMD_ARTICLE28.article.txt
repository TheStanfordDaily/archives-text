# Nominations Today
## 
### 
r ~P HIS morning when you v/alk on Quad you will see the
.1 nomination boxes with the petitions on top that are a sign of
election week. In your classes or your living groups you may
be asked to sign someone's petition; or you may yourself be
seeking endorsements for a friend.
You who are fresh from high school or some other college
may find that elections at Stanford are different from what you
had imagined. For one thing, no campaign posters are allowed
—no signs, no handbills, no cards. For another, student officers
at Stanford are chosen from the whole student body on the basis
of their merit and not their affiliations. Think carefully on the
candidates today*, tomorrow, when you will see them at an
assembly, and Wednesday. Then vote, and take advantage of
your privilege as a Stanford student to mold the policies of your
University.—Clary
