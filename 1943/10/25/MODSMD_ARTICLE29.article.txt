To the Editor:
In lieu of the opinion both written and verbal that has been
flying around hot and fast, we wish to go on record as being
willing to adopt the whole of Stanford, exclusive of any of that
now famous "Mission street" influence that sprang up like the
"Hut-Sut" song and has become just as obnoxious.
We are more than willing to and are doing our best to comply
with the traditions that make up the spirit of Stanford, but we
have begun to wonder if these traditions apply to the Army alone.
If the traditional "Hello" has to be dropped due to the vast
number of students, how about a smile? W eadmit that we've
been guilty of wolfish attitudes, but can you blame us?
We were suddenly plucked from the unvarnished setting of
our Army camp and set down in the beautiful surroundings of
Stanford University teeming with lovely damsels. This was just
a little too much for most of us, and we hope that Stanford hasn't
judged us for all time by our first appearance.
We're inclined to agree with Pfc. Hooker that the women of
Stanford are really friendly if you give them a chance, rather
than the snobs they are presumed to be. Two Privates.

To the Editor:
We were glad to see that most of the Stanford co-eds resent
the attitude prevalent among at least part of the ASTU's. Many of
us are also disgusted with the actions of these misfits, who are
giving the co-eds a wrong impression of the ASTU as a whole.
We will be happy when this situation is cleared up so that a girl
may give a friendly smile without fear of being misunderstood.

To the Editor:
We are a few of the oh, so happy recipients of the warm Stan
ford-female smile delivered in a traditional fashion. Permit us
to state our gratitude forthwith.
However, we much prfeer some of the others we have met.
Of course, they were not of the aristocracy, but their smiles were
not dictated by tradition, and they were not inhibited by any
pre-war, drawing-room conceptions of manners.
As for being "pick-ups," yes, they were, if by "pick-ups" we
mean girls who would not only smile at you, but also talk to
you. We were not averse to any familiarity, but that was en
tirely for the female of the species to decide.
We admit that we have not seen such beauty gathered in one
spot as we have at Stanford. Feminine charm abounds. Many
of us are seeing more girls in one day than we had previously
seen in months. Can you blame us for openly admiring—per
haps more than gentility prescribes—the Stanford beauties?
We hope and know that all Stanford girls are not like "some
Stanford women." Let's not make a psychological problem out
of it; let's not prate about maladjustment. Let things ride, and
everything will be all right.
And for heaven's sake, let this be the last of the letters.

with the traditions that make up the spirit of Stanford, but we
have begun to wonder if these traditions apply to the Army alone.
If the traditional "Hello" has to be dropped due to the vast
number of students, how about a smile? W eadmit that we've
been guilty of wolfish attitudes, but can you blame us?
We were suddenly plucked from the unvarnished setting of
our Army camp and set down in the beautiful surroundings of
Stanford University teeming with lovely damsels. This was just
a little too much for most of us, and we hope that Stanford hasn't
judged us for all time by our first appearance.
We're inclined to agree with Pfc. Hooker that the women of
Stanford are really friendly if you give them a chance, rather
than the snobs they are presumed to be. Two Privates.

To the Editor:
We were glad to see that most of the Stanford co-eds resent
the attitude prevalent among at least part of the ASTU's. Many of
us are also disgusted with the actions of these misfits, who are
giving the co-eds a wrong impression of the ASTU as a whole.
We will be happy when this situation is cleared up so that a girl
may give a friendly smile without fear of being misunderstood.

To the Editor:
We are a few of the oh, so happy recipients of the warm Stan
ford-female smile delivered in a traditional fashion. Permit us
to state our gratitude forthwith.
However, we much prfeer some of the others we have met.
Of course, they were not of the aristocracy, but their smiles were
not dictated by tradition, and they were not inhibited by any
pre-war, drawing-room conceptions of manners.
As for being "pick-ups," yes, they were, if by "pick-ups" we
mean girls who would not only smile at you, but also talk to
you. We were not averse to any familiarity, but that was en
tirely for the female of the species to decide.
We admit that we have not seen such beauty gathered in one
spot as we have at Stanford. Feminine charm abounds. Many
of us are seeing more girls in one day than we had previously
seen in months. Can you blame us for openly admiring—per
haps more than gentility prescribes—the Stanford beauties?
We hope and know that all Stanford girls are not like "some
Stanford women." Let's not make a psychological problem out
of it; let's not prate about maladjustment. Let things ride, and
everything will be all right.
And for heaven's sake, let this be the last of the letters.

To the Editor:
In lieu of the opinion both written and verbal that has been
flying around hot and fast, we wish to go on record as being
willing to adopt the whole of Stanford, exclusive of any of that
now famous "Mission street" influence that sprang up like the
"Hut-Sut" song and has become just as obnoxious.
We are more than willing to and are doing our best to comply
with the traditions that make up the spirit of Stanford, but we
