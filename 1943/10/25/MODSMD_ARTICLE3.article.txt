# British Smash 8 Miles In Advance Toward Rome

ALLIED H Q.. ALGIERS, Oct. 24â€”
The British Eighth Army, resuming
its offensive, smashed eight miles
along the Adriatic coast, forcing a
crossing of the Trigno River, and has
captured three strategic towns inland
in sharp fighting with Nazi rear
guards, it was announced today.
On the Fifth Army front, American
troops widened their salient pointed
toward Rome in the Alife area, cap
turing the road junction of Baia E
Latina in a one-mile gain, and ad
vanced farther west to positions close
to the new Nazi defense line based on
Mt. Massico.
Except for the Eighth Army's
coastal spurt, the advances were
slow and laborious owing to stubborn
German delaying action, widespread
demolitions, and the rough terrain.
Allied fliers knocked out three
bridges to disrupt German traffic
around Rome, and it was learned
that as a result of a week of constant
aerial assault on communications
nearly every German troop train has
to be re-routed, if it reaches its des
tination at all.
The Eighth Army had driven Ger
man rear guards to the west bank of
the Trigno, which empties into the
Adriatic 11 miles above Termoli, for
a considerable distance inland and
had forced at least one crossing de
spite blown bridges and stiff German
resistance.
