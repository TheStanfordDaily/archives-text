# REVIEW
## Berlin's 'Army' Is Musical Hit 
### 
THIS IS THE ARMY—Now playing
at the Stanfdfd Theater.
"This Is the Army" is a galaxy of
laughs, lyrics, and love that pro
vides good entertainment. Produced
by Warner Brothers and adapted
from Irving Berlin's stage produc
tion, '"This Is the Army" features 350
men from the original cast as well as
the screen talents of George Murphy,
Joan Leslie, Lt. Ronald Reagan, and
many others.
The rather weak plot revolves
around the efforts of George Murphy
and a group of his World War bud
dies to whip up a morale building
show for the present conflict.
Reagan. Leslie Romance
Ronald Reagan, seen as Murphy's
son, and Joan Leslie are o-so in love
and spend a lot of good footage de
ciding to get married. It's not until
the soldiers take over with their
variety show that affairs get moving.
There're some good and there're
some bad songs in the picture.
Berlin's Song Hits
Among the former, we have Irving
Berlin's "Oh, How I Hate to Get Up
in the Morning" and Kate Smith
singing "God Bless America." The
latter group is too numerous to men
tion. Laughs come thick and fast at
several points, especially when Alan
Hale gallops around in women's
clothes looking for all the world like
a plowhorse.
"This Is the Army" really shapes
up into a lavish Technicolor musical
that will please most spectatoi's. As
all proceeds of the film go to the
Army Emergency Relief Fund, it will
really be worth your while to see
this picture glorifying the American
soldier.—Bower
