The Health Instruction Yearbook
! â€”1930, first in an annual series to be !
compiled by Dr. Oliver E. Byrd of !
Stanford's School of Health, was '
made ready for use in schools this j
fall and received this comment from j
Dr. Hay Lyman Wilbur in its fore
word :
'"Professor Byrd has started out on t
a new and important project in the :
preparation of these yearbooks on
health instruction. Health has be- j
come an important part of education ;
in our American schools and institu
tions of higher learning. With the I
development of preventive medicine i
and of new ideas of health care, the
responsibility of the school for health 1
education has become more and !
more important each year." j
The book is for the use of health |
educators in and out of schools and '
makes it possible to keep abreast of J
latest health developments because it i
covers material in the current health j
journals and organizes it into topics j
of live interest.
Dr. Byrd is associate professor of i
hygiene and director of the Division '
of Health in Stanford's School of I
Health. He has had teaching expe
rience from elementary to university
level and has been at Stanford for J
six years. He is noted for his prep- !
aration of the Byrd Health Attitude j
Scale for high school and college j
students.
