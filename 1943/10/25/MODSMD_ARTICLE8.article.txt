# New Red Cross Hours Alloted
## 
### 
Each of the women's living groups
has been alloted a certain number of
hours to be filled in the Red Cross
Surgical Dressing Room. These al
lotments are made according to the
number of girls living in each resi
dence.
Sign-up sheets will be distributed
to War Board Auxiliary members
by Twink Da vies, chairman of the
Red Cross, at the auxiliary meeting
this afternoon at 4 in the Women's
Clubhouse.
Girls are requested to sign up for
hours and plan to go to the surgical
dressing room regularly each week
at that time. If they are unable to
go one week they are asked to pro
vide a substitute in order that the
quota be filled.
The surgical dressing room is open
Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday
from 10 to 12 and from 1 to 4. This
is essential war work, but is not very
difficult and is a very profitable way
to spend free time.
