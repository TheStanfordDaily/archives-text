# Tues. Series Will Feature Dr. Robinson
## 
### 
One of Stanford's most distin
guished faculty members, Dr. Edgar
E. Robinson, Margaret Byrne pro
fessor of history, will address Stan
ford students and faculty members
tonight at 7:30 in the Memorial Hall
in the third of the quarter's Tuesday
Evening Series.
His subject will be "America"—
its creation, intention, and experi
ence. Against the background of his
more than 30 years of study of our
country and its institutions, he will
try to answer questions vital to its
progress.
The questions are:
1. Has America completely altered
its habitat and its purposes since
1900?
2. As an "island in the sky," can
America survive?
3. Why have Americans rejected
their greatest prophets?
4. Will the United States join a
league of nations?
5. Why must minorities be pro
tected in America?
Studied Foreign Policy
The foreign policy of the United
States especially has been Dr. Rob
inson's subject of study, at the time
the United States entered the first
World War, he published with the
late Professor Victor J. West, ' The
Foreign Policy of Woodrow Wilson."
The utilization of air power has
completely changed the United
States' world position, Dr. Robinson
said, and left it an "island in the
sky," vulnerable to attack from all
directions.
Although the people doubtless will
not wish to, he said, they unques
tionably will join some concert of
power after the war. He believes
their only hope of avoiding attack is
to unite with other nations "going
our way."
Problem of Minorities
The persecution of minorities in
America always has been a problem,
Dr. Robinson said, and he indicated
that he would discuss the reasons for
it. He also planned to touch upon the
slowness with which a democratic
people recognizes its heroes.
A member of the Stanford faculty
since 1911, Dr. Robinson is a past
president of the Commonwealth Club
and a permanent member of its
board of governors. He also is past
president of the California branch
of the English Speaking Union.

One of Stanford's most distin
guished faculty members, Dr. Edgar
E. Robinson, Margaret Byrne pro
fessor of history, will address Stan
ford students and faculty members
tonight at 7:30 in the Memorial Hall
in the third of the quarter's Tuesday
Evening Series.
His subject will be "America"—
its creation, intention, and experi
ence. Against the background of his
more than 30 years of study of our
country and its institutions, he will
try to answer questions vital to its
progress.
The questions are:
1. Has America completely altered
its habitat and its purposes since
1900?
2. As an "island in the sky," can
America survive?
3. Why have Americans rejected
their greatest prophets?
4. Will the United States join a
league of nations?
5. Why must minorities be pro
tected in America?
Studied Foreign Policy
The foreign policy of the United
States especially has been Dr. Rob
inson's subject of study, at the time
the United States entered the first
World War, he published with the
late Professor Victor J. West, ' The
Foreign Policy of Woodrow Wilson."
The utilization of air power has
completely changed the United
States' world position, Dr. Robinson
said, and left it an "island in the
sky," vulnerable to attack from all
directions.
Although the people doubtless will
not wish to, he said, they unques
tionably will join some concert of
power after the war. He believes
their only hope of avoiding attack is
to unite with other nations "going
our way."
Problem of Minorities
The persecution of minorities in
America always has been a problem,
Dr. Robinson said, and he indicated
that he would discuss the reasons for
it. He also planned to touch upon the
slowness with which a democratic
people recognizes its heroes.
A member of the Stanford faculty
since 1911, Dr. Robinson is a past
president of the Commonwealth Club
and a permanent member of its
board of governors. He also is past
president of the California branch
of the English Speaking Union.
