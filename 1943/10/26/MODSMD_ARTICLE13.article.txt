# ROOS BROS.
## Campus 'Shack' Displays Latest Collegiate Clothes 
### Barbara Stevens 
Nestled under tall trees on the
Union side of Madrono and across
the alley from the Bookstore is the
Campus Roos Shack, where students
can save their tires and time and
browse in free moments looking at
sport ensembles in the atmosphere of
a chic resort shop.
According to Cheri Martin, student
manager, the Shack is still being run
under some difficulty with incom
plete furnishings. She referred to the
large wide windows that looked out
on the Union and shady Salvatierra
where soon softer rays of light will
come through swank Venetian blinds,
and to the grey-painted front door
which will soon be Stanford Red.
Clear, full-length, well-lighted
mirrors are placed strategically near
long racks of selected Roos Bros,
wool sport dresses and men's suits.
Smart cashmere sweaters and socks,
useful rain hats and coats, have been
the best sellers since the Shack
opened this quarter. Cute hats, col
orful bandanas, tie pins, blouses,
shirts — T and otherwise — are in
stock.
Free cigarettes make the browsers
feel more welcome and a coke ma
chine will be installed in the shack
as soon as possible.
"This is the first time women's
clothes have been sold on campus,"
commented Mary Lou McClure, as
sisting in the women's department.
"But remember," reminded Dick
Driseoll, in charge of the men's de
partment, "Roos has always been
clothier to the Stanford male, and
the Shack is a men's store too."
New clothes come in continually
and students can come in and order
anything they want, or make any
helpful criticism of the pi'esent stock.
Because a large percent of the
present Stanford student body is
clothed in khaki, a line of army stock
is being put in as quickly as possible.
It is not quite complete but the man
agers are trying valiantly to get
everything requested.
The Shack will eventually carry a

full line of ski clothes in time to ac
commodate students who still take to
the snow come winter. There is ev
erything but lingerie and the Roos
line of shoes.
Building an impromptu slogan on
the basis of her several weeks' ex
perience with the Shack, Miss Mar
tin said, "Com in 'to look' and stay
to buy."
No deliveries will be made but
students may call 3283 to get the
Shack and ask for information or
have clothes saved for them.
