# MURALS
## Football Kickoff Begins Farm Mural Season This Thursday 
### Don Langendorf 
Intra-murals open Thursday after
noon with six-man football. With 25
teams competing, Harry Wolter, di
rector of intra-mural sports, was
forced to divide the league into two
sections. The first section will con
sist of 12 teams playing twice a week.
The other 13 teams will be placed in
another league with one team re
ceiving a bye each day that there is
football. At the end of the season,
which will be at the beginning of
December, there will be a series of
playoffs in order to find but the real
champion of the University.
Games Twice Weekly
Games are scheduled to be played
twice a week, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Bad weather will not
cause the cancellation of any games,
because if games were to be post
poned, the season wouldn't end until
too near finals week. With this setup,
the fast team might bog down in wet
weather; the power team might sur
prise all of the days of sunshine are
few; the team with the marvelous
passers might not be worth two cents
if conditions aren't right. And in all,
this kind of play should prove to be
very interesting and should give
more teams a chance.
4 Fields
Wolter mentioned yesterday that
he was sure of the use of the varsity
football field, the frosh football field,
the intra-mural field, and possibly
the Stadium. We will know more
about the use of the Stadium later
after Wolter talks with A 1 Masters.
The fields will be divided into three
parts each and games will be played
crossways. This will make 12 fields
in all, just enough to handle every
game. The varsity field will be num
bered 1 to 3 from north to south; the
frosh field 4 to 6 again north to
south; the intra-mural field 7 to 9
from south to north; and the stadium
10 to 12 going from south to north.
The pattern resembles a semi-circle.
Each house will have to furnish
one official for each game. Then
there will be two arbiters for each
contest, therefore making sure every
thing is on the up and up. As for
what infractions of the rules will be
called, that is for the two officials

I together with the respective teams
to decide.
Service Clubs Join
We were happy to notice that sev
eral teams from the ASTP have
j signed up to participate. In all, six
1 Army teams will be represented. The
j Navy is not to be outdone however,
j as the pre-med sailors got together
and formed a ball club of their own.
This is the first time since the service
: men have moved on campus that
they have taken a notion to try out
| their talents on the field of sports.
i The seven service teams should give
i a good account of themselves.
Several houses entered more than
one team for touch. McKinley and
the Business School entered two out
fits each. Company E went farther
j than any of the clubs by tossing three
! outfits into the fray.

The fields will be divided into three
parts each and games will be played
crossways. This will make 12 fields
in all, just enough to handle every
game. The varsity field will be num
bered 1 to 3 from north to south; the
frosh field 4 to 6 again north to
south; the intra-mural field 7 to 9
from south to north; and the stadium
10 to 12 going from south to north.
The pattern resembles a semi-circle.
Each house will have to furnish
one official for each game. Then
there will be two arbiters for each
contest, therefore making sure every
thing is on the up and up. As for
what infractions of the rules will be
called, that is for the two officials

I together with the respective teams
to decide.
Service Clubs Join
We were happy to notice that sev
eral teams from the ASTP have
j signed up to participate. In all, six
1 Army teams will be represented. The
j Navy is not to be outdone however,
j as the pre-med sailors got together
and formed a ball club of their own.
This is the first time since the service
: men have moved on campus that
they have taken a notion to try out
| their talents on the field of sports.
i The seven service teams should give
i a good account of themselves.
Several houses entered more than
one team for touch. McKinley and
the Business School entered two out
fits each. Company E went farther
j than any of the clubs by tossing three
! outfits into the fray.
Intra-murals open Thursday after
noon with six-man football. With 25
teams competing, Harry Wolter, di
rector of intra-mural sports, was
forced to divide the league into two
sections. The first section will con
sist of 12 teams playing twice a week.
The other 13 teams will be placed in
another league with one team re
ceiving a bye each day that there is
football. At the end of the season,
which will be at the beginning of
December, there will be a series of
playoffs in order to find but the real
champion of the University.
Games Twice Weekly
Games are scheduled to be played
twice a week, on Tuesdays and
Thursdays. Bad weather will not
cause the cancellation of any games,
because if games were to be post
poned, the season wouldn't end until
too near finals week. With this setup,
the fast team might bog down in wet
weather; the power team might sur
prise all of the days of sunshine are
few; the team with the marvelous
passers might not be worth two cents
if conditions aren't right. And in all,
this kind of play should prove to be
very interesting and should give
more teams a chance.
4 Fields
Wolter mentioned yesterday that
he was sure of the use of the varsity
football field, the frosh football field,
the intra-mural field, and possibly
the Stadium. We will know more
about the use of the Stadium later
after Wolter talks with A 1 Masters.
