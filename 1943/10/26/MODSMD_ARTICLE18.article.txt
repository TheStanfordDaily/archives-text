# Great Day Tomorrow
## 
### 
TOMORROW is going to be a great day; maybe it will be
be just the usual thing for most people. For fighting men, it
will be another day of matching wits with the other side; for
war workers, it will mean another day closer to completing a
ship; to housewives, it will mean another day of standing in
line waiting for butter.
But at Stanford, it's a great day because it's the day when
some thousand students show their student body cards at English
and Engineering corners and are granted the privilege of voting
for their candidates.
Some voters will forget to read the directions on the ballots
and so their efforts are wasted. And in every election, there are
those who mark on the diagonal because they don't know any
of the candidates. But to compensate for these there are always
the conscientious voters who make a point of reading the direc
tions and at least knowing what kind of faces are to be connected
with the names on the ballots.
The assembly this morning can help a person learn to do the
latter; and surely, any Stanford man or woman can read a few
simple directions. —Irma Cunha
