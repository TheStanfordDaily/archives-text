To the Editor:
HELLO!
As I was on my way to class,
A pretty girl I chanced to pass.
With a sound like heaven, and a voice so low
She gently murmured a warm "HELLO."
Now I'm not a pre-med of Company F; -
I'm not a brain, and I'm a little deaf;
But now I'm happy as can be,
For a Stanford girl said "HELLO" to me.
"D. McKay," Sec. 1, Co. B

To the Editor:
For the sake of our morale, please stop printing those puerile
appeals for "smiles from the co-eds." Those heroes who pa
thetically seek sympathy for the terrible affliction of being in the
Army make me cry in my 4.2. This morning I passed solid lines
of Stanford "beauties" all brightly displaying their teeth in the
best approved Pepsodent manner. Let's leave that stuff to the
LJSO. They do it much better. It's getting so a fellow can't even
enjoy a Monday morning grouch any more.

To the Editor:
In the opinion of this humble observer, much ado about com
paratively nothing is being made over the rather more fancied
than real difficulties in co-ed-soldier social relationships.
In the first place, unless the co-eds here are like none I have
ever known, they have no desire to lead a cloister-like existence.
It seems reasonable to assume that for the most part the girls
are willing and in many cases, anxious to meet soldiers (or civil
ians for that matter) with whom they can lead normal social lives.
The soldier on the campus should realize that he is a student
and expect to be treated as any other student. None to my knowl
edge has been wounded in action or been in a war zone. There
are no heroes at Stanford. Let him act just as he did at his own
school, whether it be Dartmouth, U.S.C., or East Moline State
Teachers. There, as well as here, it was up to the man to make
the first move. The machinery has been set up through the
social committees for a simple sensible solution to the problem
without violating any of the "pre-war, drawing room conceptions
of manners," which I for one believe worth preserving, war or
no war.
I suggest that The Daily reprint the story about these com
mittees in some prominent place so that there will be no more
useless squabbling about the subject.
