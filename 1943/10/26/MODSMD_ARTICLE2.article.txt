# Saroyan's Play Opens Series
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Wlliam Saroyan, author of "Hello j
Out There," which David Sievers
will direct as part of the Stanford
Players presentation of three one
acts on Nov. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15,
couldn't be judged guilty of modesty.
He rejected the coveted Pulitzer
Prize which he was awarded for his
play "Time of Your Life" because he
didn't feel that the play was extraor
dinary for his usual run of work—
it didn't warrant any more praise
than any of his other efforts.
He is deeply impi'essed with his
own plays and can laugh and cry as
deeply • moved the third or tenth
time as at the time he writes his
dramatic scenes.
Saroyan is perhaps more popularly I
known for his two books selected by
the Book of the Month Club, "My
Name Is Aram," and"The Human
Comedy." The latter has been staged
and filmed and both are supposed to
give an insight into the author's
private life.
Born in Fresno in 1910 of Ar
\ menian parents, Saroyan was or
phaned when he was three and spent
; many later years struggling to gain
I recognition. Now at 33 he is wealthy
and a private in the Army with prob
ably more colorful fabrications woven
around his life than any other thea
| ter "character."
When questioned as to his educa
; tion he commented "I read every
l damn book in Fresno's Public Li
l brary."
In 1939 he had three plays on
Broadway at once and he has writ
ten hundreds of short stories. George
! Bernard Shaw is his idol. He has
dedicated "'Hello Out There" to the
Irish playwright.
"Time of Your Life" will be pre
sented with two other one-acts,
I Shaw's "A Village Wooing," Thorn
ton Wilder's "The Happy Journey,"
! by the Stanford Players next month, i
The Players will schedule five other
' products for later in the season
which will be announced by The
1 Daily.

Wlliam Saroyan, author of "Hello j
Out There," which David Sievers
will direct as part of the Stanford
Players presentation of three one
acts on Nov. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15,
couldn't be judged guilty of modesty.
He rejected the coveted Pulitzer
Prize which he was awarded for his
play "Time of Your Life" because he
didn't feel that the play was extraor
dinary for his usual run of work—
it didn't warrant any more praise
than any of his other efforts.
He is deeply impi'essed with his
own plays and can laugh and cry as
deeply • moved the third or tenth
time as at the time he writes his
dramatic scenes.
Saroyan is perhaps more popularly I
known for his two books selected by
the Book of the Month Club, "My
Name Is Aram," and"The Human
Comedy." The latter has been staged
and filmed and both are supposed to
give an insight into the author's
private life.
Born in Fresno in 1910 of Ar
\ menian parents, Saroyan was or
phaned when he was three and spent
; many later years struggling to gain
I recognition. Now at 33 he is wealthy
and a private in the Army with prob
ably more colorful fabrications woven
around his life than any other thea
| ter "character."
When questioned as to his educa
; tion he commented "I read every
l damn book in Fresno's Public Li
l brary."
In 1939 he had three plays on
Broadway at once and he has writ
ten hundreds of short stories. George
! Bernard Shaw is his idol. He has
dedicated "'Hello Out There" to the
Irish playwright.
"Time of Your Life" will be pre
sented with two other one-acts,
I Shaw's "A Village Wooing," Thorn
ton Wilder's "The Happy Journey,"
! by the Stanford Players next month, i
The Players will schedule five other
' products for later in the season
which will be announced by The
1 Daily.
Season tickets for the series are on j
i sale now in Room 202 in Memorial
, Hall and may be purchased for $2.75.
