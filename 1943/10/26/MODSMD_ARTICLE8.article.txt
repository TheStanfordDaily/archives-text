# YWCA Drive For Members Nears Finish
## 
### 
As the YWCA week-long mem
bership drive which began last
Wednesday rolls into its last day,
hopes are high that the $500 goal
will be reached. Today "Y" repre
sentatives will finish canvassing liv
ing groups with the $1 membership
cards which entitle holders to any of
the "Y's" stimulating activities.
Muriel Tarr, the associatiqn's social
chairman, urged girls to take advan
tage of these activities which are
highlighted by the various interest
groups. She clarified the purpose of
these groups by saying, "You can
join the 'Y' and do nothing, but these
interest groups help you to get the
most out of the association. Because
they bring you in touch with every
day problems, they might well be a
supplement to your college educa
tion."
She said "Their purpose is to en
rich the lives of University women.
If a person can make it a point of
actively engaging in 'Y' work, she
will get more out of the 'Y' and more
out of college."
Because of present conditions, the
War Marriages and Race Relation
Groups have been especially popu
lar. Well known professors speak at
these meetings.
At the second cabinet meeting of
the year, Wednesday, definite sched
ules will be planned so that interest
groups will start at regular inter
vals. Each member will bring a re
port of proposed activities for the
coming year.
