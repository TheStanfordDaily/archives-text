about a German pocket left on the
Volturno plain during the general
retirement of the Nazis to their new
j line anchored at Mondragone on the
j Tyrrhenian.
The pocket also was being
j squeezed from the west by British
! troops on the coast, and from the
south by Americans who captured
Rocheta in a two-mile drive north
from Pignatoro.

adding that Nazi demolition experts
had started to dynamite and flood
Krovoi Rog mines.
