# No Publicity At Polls Today
## 
### 
"Voting students today are re
minded that there is to be no elec
tioneering around the polls," Irma
Cunha, Election Board chairman an
nounced today. "In addition, there
is to be no printed matter circulated
on the campus about any nominee,"
she added.
For several offices, notably class
positions, several students have
asked to be write-in candidates and
their names appear either following
the list of nominees for that office or
in a box in this columnn. In order to
vote for these candidates, students
must add their names in ink to the
blank space on the ballot below the
other printed names for the desig
nated office and then draw a box on
the right in which to place a check
mark for the candidate.

Before the Daily went to press
last night, it was asked that Jody
Scowcroft be a write-in candidate
for junior class president.

In order to vote today, students
must present their student body
cards, which will be punched when
the ballot is given out to the indi
vidual.
Voting for class officers on the sep
arate ballot for this purpose is regu
lated by the number of units the
voter has fulfilled. All students with
less than 45 units will participate in
freshman class elections, those with
45 to 87 in sophomore class elections,
those with 87 to 132 for junior class
elections and those with more than
that number for senior class elec
tions.
