# U.S. Historic Themes Guide to Future Acts

America today cannot escape an
active, decisive role forced by the
worldwide human crisis and in mak
ing such decisions she likewise can
not help but be driven by attitudes
developed in her 154-year historical
experience.
Stanford's outstanding "traveler
into the history of our own people,"
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, Mar
garet Byrne Professor of American
History, reported on the findings of
his journey to the Tuesday Evening
Series audience last evening, seeking
to draw together from his 30 years of
professional work the dominant
themes which will guide "America"
in its democratic role of "deciding."
Americans have stood for inter
national peace, for cooperation. They
live in a land which emphasizes the
differences in men and glorifies their
achievements in making good in an
individual, aggressive way.
America has been the land of ex-

pansion, of the growth of a "quizzical
Uncle Sam," conditioned by frontier
experience and individualistic in
dustrial and commercial growth. The
1789 post-crisis planners decided "to
go on deciding" with a flexible con
stitution, securing freedom from the
tyranny of man, time, place, and cir
cumstance.
Prophets Rejected
At many times in our history the
basic decisions made, the forces en
gendering them, and great leaders'
attempts to follow them have been
misunderstood or rejected by the
mass of the people.
But American experience has also
shown that their failure to appreci
ate leadership which did follow lines
of historical continuity resulted in
failure such as that of the League of
Nations and the discrediting of Wil
son.
There are many misapprehensions
which creep into the American mind

about its own history, some wilfully
created by those who would" serve
their personal ends, but more often
than not created by the tendency of
man to look at his personal position,
as of now in 1943, as being the only
guiding influences.
Looking Farther
If one would look farther, he
would find that Americans are not
internationalist, and today they face
their greatest, most wrenching de
cision in the choice between sur
render of certain traditional inde
pendence for common security or
the sure death of isolation. For it
is a sure death, and a death the lay
ers of the foundations never intended
in their maligned opinion about "for
eign entanglements."
Likewise America, although ac
tually a land of courageous radical
ism, has never fostered that idea of
"social revolution" which allows an
aquiescent mass to lead merely be
cause "the masses say it must be so."
Unless We Fall
"Calls among them for such revo
lution or internationalism in its im
perialistic form will fail, unless our
policy of independence and coopera
tion fails to produce results. Then
the world will have grown too much
for us and we have failed."
The Dangers
The dangers of today? That a mod
ern cult of mediocrity, looking to
mere numbers as leadership, will
stifle prophets who see our funda
mental paths, that those who state
that "necessity for action adjourns
necessity for thought" will be heed
ed, and that the cynical conditioning
to the war and its consequences
growing among our people will pro
duce acceptance off orce as the rul
ing weight, not the American ideal of
permanent peace and progressive de
velopment.
And in what ways will America
be most likely to move in meeting
these dangers? Toward a peace
which emphasizes freedom for mi
norities, probably to a confederation
type of machinery for insurance and
to "order through law" and "peace
through cooperation" as keystones of
the structure.
Platitudes?
"The Gettysburg Address was as
much a platitude as the Four Free
doms, for a platitude means a truism,
a commonplace." And, Robinson
concluded, it would be better for us
to live by the commonplace themes
which have been our history, for out
of them will come the only secure
future.

America today cannot escape an
active, decisive role forced by the
worldwide human crisis and in mak
ing such decisions she likewise can
not help but be driven by attitudes
developed in her 154-year historical
experience.
Stanford's outstanding "traveler
into the history of our own people,"
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, Mar
garet Byrne Professor of American
History, reported on the findings of
his journey to the Tuesday Evening
Series audience last evening, seeking
to draw together from his 30 years of
professional work the dominant
themes which will guide "America"
in its democratic role of "deciding."
Americans have stood for inter
national peace, for cooperation. They
live in a land which emphasizes the
differences in men and glorifies their
achievements in making good in an
individual, aggressive way.
America has been the land of ex-

pansion, of the growth of a "quizzical
Uncle Sam," conditioned by frontier
experience and individualistic in
dustrial and commercial growth. The
1789 post-crisis planners decided "to
go on deciding" with a flexible con
stitution, securing freedom from the
tyranny of man, time, place, and cir
cumstance.
Prophets Rejected
At many times in our history the
basic decisions made, the forces en
gendering them, and great leaders'
attempts to follow them have been
misunderstood or rejected by the
mass of the people.
But American experience has also
shown that their failure to appreci
ate leadership which did follow lines
of historical continuity resulted in
failure such as that of the League of
Nations and the discrediting of Wil
son.
There are many misapprehensions
which creep into the American mind

about its own history, some wilfully
created by those who would" serve
their personal ends, but more often
than not created by the tendency of
man to look at his personal position,
as of now in 1943, as being the only
guiding influences.
Looking Farther
If one would look farther, he
would find that Americans are not
internationalist, and today they face
their greatest, most wrenching de
cision in the choice between sur
render of certain traditional inde
pendence for common security or
the sure death of isolation. For it
is a sure death, and a death the lay
ers of the foundations never intended
in their maligned opinion about "for
eign entanglements."
Likewise America, although ac
tually a land of courageous radical
ism, has never fostered that idea of
"social revolution" which allows an
aquiescent mass to lead merely be
cause "the masses say it must be so."
Unless We Fall
"Calls among them for such revo
lution or internationalism in its im
perialistic form will fail, unless our
policy of independence and coopera
tion fails to produce results. Then
the world will have grown too much
for us and we have failed."
The Dangers
The dangers of today? That a mod
ern cult of mediocrity, looking to
mere numbers as leadership, will
stifle prophets who see our funda
mental paths, that those who state
that "necessity for action adjourns
necessity for thought" will be heed
ed, and that the cynical conditioning
to the war and its consequences
growing among our people will pro
duce acceptance off orce as the rul
ing weight, not the American ideal of
permanent peace and progressive de
velopment.
And in what ways will America
be most likely to move in meeting
these dangers? Toward a peace
which emphasizes freedom for mi
norities, probably to a confederation
type of machinery for insurance and
to "order through law" and "peace
through cooperation" as keystones of
the structure.
Platitudes?
"The Gettysburg Address was as

America today cannot escape an
active, decisive role forced by the
worldwide human crisis and in mak
ing such decisions she likewise can
not help but be driven by attitudes
developed in her 154-year historical
experience.
Stanford's outstanding "traveler
into the history of our own people,"
Dr. Edgar Eugene Robinson, Mar
garet Byrne Professor of American
History, reported on the findings of
his journey to the Tuesday Evening
Series audience last evening, seeking
to draw together from his 30 years of
professional work the dominant
themes which will guide "America"
in its democratic role of "deciding."
Americans have stood for inter
national peace, for cooperation. They
live in a land which emphasizes the
differences in men and glorifies their
achievements in making good in an
individual, aggressive way.
America has been the land of ex-

pansion, of the growth of a "quizzical
Uncle Sam," conditioned by frontier
experience and individualistic in
dustrial and commercial growth. The
1789 post-crisis planners decided "to
go on deciding" with a flexible con
stitution, securing freedom from the
tyranny of man, time, place, and cir
cumstance.
Prophets Rejected
At many times in our history the
basic decisions made, the forces en
gendering them, and great leaders'
attempts to follow them have been
misunderstood or rejected by the
mass of the people.
But American experience has also
shown that their failure to appreci
ate leadership which did follow lines
of historical continuity resulted in
failure such as that of the League of
Nations and the discrediting of Wil
son.
There are many misapprehensions
which creep into the American mind

about its own history, some wilfully
created by those who would" serve
their personal ends, but more often
than not created by the tendency of
man to look at his personal position,
as of now in 1943, as being the only
guiding influences.
Looking Farther
If one would look farther, he
would find that Americans are not
internationalist, and today they face
their greatest, most wrenching de
cision in the choice between sur
render of certain traditional inde
pendence for common security or
the sure death of isolation. For it
is a sure death, and a death the lay
ers of the foundations never intended
in their maligned opinion about "for
eign entanglements."
Likewise America, although ac
tually a land of courageous radical
ism, has never fostered that idea of
"social revolution" which allows an
aquiescent mass to lead merely be
cause "the masses say it must be so."
Unless We Fall
"Calls among them for such revo
lution or internationalism in its im
perialistic form will fail, unless our
policy of independence and coopera
tion fails to produce results. Then
the world will have grown too much
for us and we have failed."
The Dangers
The dangers of today? That a mod
ern cult of mediocrity, looking to
mere numbers as leadership, will
stifle prophets who see our funda
mental paths, that those who state
that "necessity for action adjourns
necessity for thought" will be heed
ed, and that the cynical conditioning
to the war and its consequences
growing among our people will pro
duce acceptance off orce as the rul
ing weight, not the American ideal of
permanent peace and progressive de
velopment.
And in what ways will America
be most likely to move in meeting
these dangers? Toward a peace
which emphasizes freedom for mi
norities, probably to a confederation
type of machinery for insurance and
to "order through law" and "peace
through cooperation" as keystones of
the structure.
Platitudes?
"The Gettysburg Address was as
much a platitude as the Four Free
doms, for a platitude means a truism,
a commonplace." And, Robinson
concluded, it would be better for us
to live by the commonplace themes
which have been our history, for out
of them will come the only secure
future.
