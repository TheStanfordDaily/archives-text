# CALIFORNIA MEETS USC
## 
### 
Coast Football this coming week
end takes a back scat to that of the
other sections of the country. Only
one outstanding clash, what promises
to be a rather one-sided affair be
tween California and USC, is sched
uled for this area. Single game in the
Bay Area this weekend pits St.
Mary's against USF Sunday at Kezar
Stadium.
