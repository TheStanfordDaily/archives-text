## 
### 
Dr. Harold Fisher, professor of
history and vice-chairman of direc
tors of Hoover Library, spoke over
station KPO Sunday night on the
program called "Pacific Story," the
same program on which Chancellor
Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur spoke
Oct. 10. The program was one of a
series of dramatizations of interesting
events in the history of the Pacific.
Principles of War
Professor Fisher warned his lis
teners that though no American can
think of the battle of Stalingrad
without reverence and gratitude, the
full significance of it will be missed
if we consider it only in terms of the
defeat of the Nazis.
"We must," he declared, "think of
it in terms of the fundamental issues
of the war." He summed up these
issues in the single word used by a
young Chinese writer, "emancipa
tion."
By the word emancipation Profes
sor Fisher explained, that Chinese
youth "mean emancipation from for
eign aggression, from foreign rule,
and from native exploitation. They
mean the application to all the peo
ples of East Asia of the principles
that Russia has applied to the Asiatic
peoples of the Soviet Union — the
principles of national and racial
equality and the end of imperialism."
He declared that the realization of
these great principles depends on the
standing between us and Russia in
the face of this struggle for emanci
pation.
Unity of Spirit
Fisher emphasized the significance
of the 5,000-mile frontier which Rus
sia and China hold in common, but
pointed out that it is not so easy to
understand the "political significance
of the frontier or the spirit that joins
Russia and Asia."
Fisher urged his listeners to recog
nize the spirit that has so changed
the Asiatic peoples of Russia within
a single generation, and warned them
that it is to their interest to give the
people aid and leadership, as Russia
has done, but on no account should
they stand aside and let matters go
as they will.
Dr. Fisher will speak on the "Pa
cific Story" program again in No
vember.

Fisher emphasized the significance
of the 5,000-mile frontier which Rus
sia and China hold in common, but
pointed out that it is not so easy to
understand the "political significance
of the frontier or the spirit that joins
Russia and Asia."
Fisher urged his listeners to recog
nize the spirit that has so changed
the Asiatic peoples of Russia within
a single generation, and warned them
that it is to their interest to give the
people aid and leadership, as Russia
has done, but on no account should
they stand aside and let matters go
as they will.
Dr. Fisher will speak on the "Pa
cific Story" program again in No
vember.
Dr. Harold Fisher, professor of
history and vice-chairman of direc
tors of Hoover Library, spoke over
station KPO Sunday night on the
program called "Pacific Story," the
same program on which Chancellor
Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur spoke
Oct. 10. The program was one of a
series of dramatizations of interesting
events in the history of the Pacific.
Principles of War
Professor Fisher warned his lis
teners that though no American can
think of the battle of Stalingrad
without reverence and gratitude, the
full significance of it will be missed
if we consider it only in terms of the
defeat of the Nazis.
"We must," he declared, "think of
it in terms of the fundamental issues
of the war." He summed up these
issues in the single word used by a
young Chinese writer, "emancipa
tion."
By the word emancipation Profes
sor Fisher explained, that Chinese
youth "mean emancipation from for
eign aggression, from foreign rule,
and from native exploitation. They
mean the application to all the peo
ples of East Asia of the principles
that Russia has applied to the Asiatic
peoples of the Soviet Union — the
principles of national and racial
equality and the end of imperialism."
He declared that the realization of
these great principles depends on the
standing between us and Russia in
the face of this struggle for emanci
pation.
Unity of Spirit
Fisher emphasized the significance
of the 5,000-mile frontier which Rus
sia and China hold in common, but
pointed out that it is not so easy to
understand the "political significance
of the frontier or the spirit that joins
Russia and Asia."
Fisher urged his listeners to recog
nize the spirit that has so changed
the Asiatic peoples of Russia within
