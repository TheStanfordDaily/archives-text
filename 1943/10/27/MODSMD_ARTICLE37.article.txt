# Libe Suffers Labor Shortage
## 
### 
Complaints have been made about
the main library for its failure to open
at an earlier hour in the morning.
In replying to these criticisms, Mr.
Nathan van Patten, director of Uni
versity libraries, stated that the main
trouble was in the difficulty of ob
taining experienced librarians. Not
only is the labor shortage to blame
for this inconvenient situation, said
Mr. Patten, but the library is limited
as to the budget available for wages.
When it was found necessary to
close the Libe for a short period dur
ing the day, it was decided that the
morning period from 8 to 9 would in
convenience the least number of stu
dents, since there were rarely more
than 12 readers present at that time.
If the library were to open between
8 and 9, it would be necessary to
close it for a corresponding time dur
ing some other hour of the day.
Student help, if available, could be
used to fill certain limited positions.
However, the main vacancies occur
in jobs requiring trained librarians.
Mr. van Patten assured students
that as soon as the personnel is
available and the budget permits, the
Library will be opened during the
morning hours.
