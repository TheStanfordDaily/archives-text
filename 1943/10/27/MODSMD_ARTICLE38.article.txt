# Union Dining Hall To Close Sunday
## 
### 
Because of the labor shortage, The
Union Public Dining Room will be
closed every Sunday, Mrs. Frank V.
Walker, financial vice-president of
Stanford, announced yesterday.
"We have deeply regretted having
to make this move," said Miss Ricker,
director of University dining halls,
"but because of an acute shortage of
kitchen help we are being forced to
close one day a week as so many of
the restaurants in this area are
doing."
Among the ever-increasing diffi
culties that Miss Ricker is facing are
the limited deliveries of food sup
plies, and the unpredictable short
ages of different foods from day to
day which make meal planning very
far in advance impossible.
According to law, milk deliveries
can now be made only once a day,
while the living groups on President's
Hill are having to go without orange
juice because the delivery man re
fuses to risk his truck's already well
worn tires on the ascent.
Breaking dishes, though always a
fi'owned-upon procedure, has now
become a major catastrophe since it
takes from 17 to 18 months to re
place even one order. To make mat
ters worse, there is even a shortage
of dustpans to pick up the broken
pieces.
