# Walnut Pickers Needed Sunday
## 
### 
Walnut pickers are needed again
this weekend at the Shumate Ranch.
Arrangements have been made for
the pickers to be returned to campus
in time for lunch and dinner.
The bus will leave the Post Office
Saturday morning at 7:45 and will
return before 12, and in the after
noon the bus will leave at 1 and re
turn at 5:30. Sunday morning pick
ers must be at the Post Office at 11
and will work until 3 p.m.
Twenty pickers are needed for
each of the four-hour shifts. Those
interested may sign up in their liv
ing groups with their crop crew rep
resentatives, or in the War Board
office where Barbara Pike is in
charge of Crop Crews.
The Janeke Ranch at 873 Embarca
dero, Palo Alto, is still badly in need
of tomato pickers. Volunteers may
go to the ranch anytime during the
week, but transportation cannot be
provided unless a large group plans
to go. A bus will go to the Janeke
Ranch Sunday morning at 11 and
will meet the pickers at the Post
Office.
Miss Pike expresses her apprecia
tion of all those students who have
volunteered to help the ranchers the
last two weekends. She hopes that
students will continue to show such
splendid cooperation.
