Last Saturday afternoon we had
the pleasure of watching Mr. Smith
go to town. This Mr. Smith is by no
means that fictitious character of the
movies; ask Stub AlLison. He'll tell
you that this Smith is one of the best
ball players he has ever seen. What
he might not say is that Mr. Smith is
directly responsible for the lowering
of Allison's prestige and perhaps re
sponsible for the loss of his job. We
shall see about that later on.
Bruce Smith, former All-American
from Minnesota, ran Cal ragged last
Saturday afternoon on the turf of
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley.
Smith and his teammates from St.
Mary's Pre-Flight gave UC the worst
licking they have received since
Tommy Harmon & Co. came West a
few years ago and walked all over
Cal, 42 to 0. Pre-Flight missed that
score by a mere three points. It
will be a long time before we see
another player the likes of Smith.
We were disappointed last week
end to see COP go down to defeat
at the hands of Southern California.
Stagg's men held the Trojans for
three quarters before Troy could
put across the winning marker. In
fact Pacific scored two touchdowns
herself which were both called back.
Although the coaching of Jeff Cra
vath has been good enough to bring
USC this far along in the season
without as much as being scored
upon, the Trojans are going to need
much more coaching to stay that way,
considering they lose Mickey Mc-
Cardle, Ralph Heywood, and others
before their next game.
Cravath is thankful, however, that
he has finished the major part of his
schedule, with the March Field Fly
ers as the only tough team left to
stand in his way.
Facing each other in the featured
game on the coast next Saturday will
be St. Mary's Pre-F.light and the
March Field Flyers. Fresh from their
massacre over Cal, Smith & Co. will
probably be favored over the Flyers.
Don't sell the Flyers short, however,
as they still have a good club, despite
their loss to Washington.
