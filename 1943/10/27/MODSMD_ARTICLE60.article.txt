# NATIONAL FOOTBALL
## Notre Dame Leads Country; Army, Michigan, Navy Next

(Editor's note: This is the last in

analyzing the top football teams in
the country.)
Roaring through all opposition
with no trouble at all, the Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame late as the top
football team in the country today,
and one of the greatest of all time.
The Irish haven't even been ex
tended yet, and it's doubtful whether
they will all season. If the Rose Bowl
is staged next January, Notre Dame
is the logical representative from the
East; and if they accept, they'll ruin
Southern California's perfect record;
if the Trojans maintain it—that's a
lot of it's, but they all add up to one
fact. Notre Dame is the greatest col

lege grid team in the country this
season.
Army is a solid choice Tor the No.
2 spot in the nation. The Army-
Notre Dame game will be the battle
of the year, but just as was the case
with the Michigan "Dream Team,"
the Kaydets will go down to a light
ing defeat. The best team in the
East, Army is unquestionably good,
but not quite good enough for the
Mighty Irish.
Hailed as the team to beat by the
experts, Michigan has been beaten—
but only once, and that was by Notre
Dame, who just can't be stopped.
Michigan shouldn't Jose another
game for the rest of the season, and
probably- will take the Big Ten
championship, though not without
bitter competition from Purdue.
As usual, Navy is fielding a strong
squad this season. Year after year
the Middies have climaxed their sea
son with a victory over Army, but
this time it may be different. The
Kaydets will go into the big game as
the favorites, but anything can hap
pen and usually does in this tradi
tion-packed encounter.
Boasting the best record of any
team in the country, Southern Cali
fornia hasn't had a point scored on
them all season. The Trojans are the
best team on the coast, but were bad
ly scared by College of the Pacific.
Here are the national ratings:
1. Notre Dame
2. Army
3. Michigan
4. Navy
5. Southern California
G. Purdue
7. Duke
8. Pennsylvania
9. College of the Pacific
10. Texas A. and M.

squad this season. Year after year
the Middies have climaxed their sea
son with a victory over Army, but
this time it may be different. The
Kaydets will go into the big game as
the favorites, but anything can hap
pen and usually does in this tradi

Boasting the best record of any
team in the country, Southern Cali
fornia hasn't had a point scored on
them all season. The Trojans are the
best team on the coast, but were bad
ly scared by College of the Pacific.
Here are the national ratings:
1. Notre Dame
2. Army
3. Michigan
4. Navy
5. Southern California
G. Purdue
7. Duke
8. Pennsylvania
9. College of the Pacific
10. Texas A. and M.

Roaring through all opposition
with no trouble at all, the Fighting
Irish of Notre Dame late as the top
football team in the country today,
and one of the greatest of all time.
The Irish haven't even been ex
tended yet, and it's doubtful whether
they will all season. If the Rose Bowl
is staged next January, Notre Dame
is the logical representative from the
East; and if they accept, they'll ruin
Southern California's perfect record;
if the Trojans maintain it—that's a
lot of it's, but they all add up to one
fact. Notre Dame is the greatest col

lege grid team in the country this
season.
Army is a solid choice Tor the No.
2 spot in the nation. The Army-
Notre Dame game will be the battle
of the year, but just as was the case
with the Michigan "Dream Team,"
the Kaydets will go down to a light
ing defeat. The best team in the
East, Army is unquestionably good,
but not quite good enough for the
Mighty Irish.
Hailed as the team to beat by the
experts, Michigan has been beaten—
but only once, and that was by Notre
Dame, who just can't be stopped.
Michigan shouldn't Jose another
game for the rest of the season, and
probably- will take the Big Ten
championship, though not without
bitter competition from Purdue.
As usual, Navy is fielding a strong
squad this season. Year after year
the Middies have climaxed their sea
son with a victory over Army, but
this time it may be different. The
Kaydets will go into the big game as
the favorites, but anything can hap
