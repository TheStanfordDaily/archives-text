### 
With the addition of three more
teams to the mural football leagues,
14 teams will be in each circuit at
the beginning of the season. Two
more service teams were added along
with the well known aggregation
from Gerona road, known as the
Gerona Athletic Club. Many of you
many remember Gerona from the
Summer Softball League.
Harry Wolter announced yesterday
that he had received notice from A 1
Masters, graduate manager, that ihe
stadium will be used for intramural
football. Although this 90,000-capa
city stadium will not by any means
be expected to be filled with spec
tators, it is the general opinion that
it will be of good for the Farm in
training men for the battles not so
distant.
As stated in yesterday's Daily, each
team will have to furnish one official
apiece, thereby assuring fairness for
both teams.
Due to the large amount of teams
and the amount of games scheduled,
come rain or shine, no games will be
postponed. While rain may be un
favorable to one team, it may help
another. The same is true of hot
weather. Indications point to a great
season, no matter what kind of
weather.
