# Navy Day

### 
ONE hundred sixty-eight years ago in the
month of October the Continental Con
gress founded a Navy. It was composed of
of the United States Navy, but the first Admiral
of the United States Navy, John Paul Jones,
fought a gallant battle in the English Channel.
It is said he never knew when he was licked.
Then the Navy's war in 1812, when the Con
stitution sunk the larger British frigate, the
Guerriere, and Commodore Perry flew his im
mortal flag, "Don't Give Up the Ship," on Lake
Erie.
In the Civil War, Farragut, lashed to the mast
of his ship, directed the historic bombardment
and capture of New Orleans, and will be re
membered for, "Fire when ready, Gridley."
In the last World War, the United States'
fleet under Admiral Sims developed the convoy
system, then transported the A.E.F. to Europe
without losing a man.
In this war, the Navy carries on its great,
colorful tradition. With 800 vessels it convoyed
safely to Africa the American forces. In spirit
and deed it has re-enacted the commands of
early officers. It is remembered for heroism,
valor, and victory connected with the Coral
Seas, Midway, Guadalcanal, Marcus Island, and
many more encounters.
Today, Navy Day, we officially pay tribute
to the men and ships which sail the seven seas,
leaving in their wake the basis for a victorious
peace.
