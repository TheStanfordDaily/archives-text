# The 						Big Day
## 
### 
WE MUST bring our Autumn Quarter stu
dent body cards to the polls. We vote
lor the class office for which we ourselvse
could be running. We read and follow the di
rections on the ballots. We don't electioneer
around the polls or print any campaign matter.
And that's all there is to the mechanics of
voting in the big election today. But there are
more things to be considered about the elec
tion than just the mere mechanics—more im
portant things.
Yesterday it was hard to see some of the
candidates at the assembly. But we did see
some of them, or at least a part of them, even
if that part was just the top of a head. And from
that glance and a few things we found out about
the candidates by the grapevine method, we
should have made at least a fair estimate of
their qualifications.
And now it's up to us to turn out today and
show some interest in Stanford University by
helping to decide who shall run it for the best
interest of all concerned.—lrma Cunha
