# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
All of the men of the ASTU have been fol
lowing the "Campus Opinion" for the past few ■
days. We, naturally are greatelv interested in
the letters that have been sent to the editor, con

cerning the lack of friendship between the j
co-eds and the G.l.'s.
Today, finally, we got the opinion of the
co-eds, and the majority agree with '"Some j
Stanford Women," that their "hellos" would be I
taken the wrong way by many of the ASTU's. !
But, let me assure these "Stanford Women" j
that the "wolves" would be in a very small
minority.
Most of the ASTU's would feel a hell of a lot
better about the whole thing if someone would
say "Hello!" once in a while and really mean
it.
Several girls said "Hello" to the fellows in
my section today and their morale has jumped
from 0 to 75.

Editor's Note: The following is an answer
to this challenge appearing in the Campus
Opinion column Oct. 22. "We want the boys
to answer this one: At this time your "Mission
Street' attitude discourages our natural im
pulse to be friendly, so when we smile and
say "hello' will you understand it as a
FRIENDLY gesture or merely misinterpret it
as a 'come-hither' PICKUP?"

To the Editor:
As a former Stanford student returning to the
campus on leave, I have taken quite an interest
in the current squabble between the Stanford
women and the Army men stationed here.
As I understand the situation, when one of
the so-eds smiles or says hello to an Army man,
he thinks that the girl is asking for a "South of
Market pick-up," yet when the girls go by
without so much as a smile, the Army thinks
they are snobs. It seems a little silly to me.
Stanford has always been a friendly school.
It has been a tradition to give everyone a j
friendly smile and say hello to them when pass-;
ing. Now, why can't the soldiers take it the
same way we did as civilians? When a girl
passes and gives a cheery hello, answer her [
with a smile and return her salutation. There is
no need to answer her with cat-calls and
whistles.
Be friendly, soldier, these gals are trying to
be friendly to you, and above all, remember
that they aren't the type of girls you would meet
on the south side of Market street.

cerning the lack of friendship between the j
co-eds and the G.l.'s.
Today, finally, we got the opinion of the
co-eds, and the majority agree with '"Some j
Stanford Women," that their "hellos" would be I
taken the wrong way by many of the ASTU's. !
But, let me assure these "Stanford Women" j
that the "wolves" would be in a very small
minority.
Most of the ASTU's would feel a hell of a lot
better about the whole thing if someone would
say "Hello!" once in a while and really mean
it.
Several girls said "Hello" to the fellows in
my section today and their morale has jumped
from 0 to 75.

Editor's Note: The following is an answer
to this challenge appearing in the Campus
Opinion column Oct. 22. "We want the boys
to answer this one: At this time your "Mission
Street' attitude discourages our natural im
pulse to be friendly, so when we smile and
say "hello' will you understand it as a
FRIENDLY gesture or merely misinterpret it
as a 'come-hither' PICKUP?"

To the Editor:
As a former Stanford student returning to the
campus on leave, I have taken quite an interest
in the current squabble between the Stanford
women and the Army men stationed here.
As I understand the situation, when one of
the so-eds smiles or says hello to an Army man,
he thinks that the girl is asking for a "South of
Market pick-up," yet when the girls go by
without so much as a smile, the Army thinks
they are snobs. It seems a little silly to me.
Stanford has always been a friendly school.
It has been a tradition to give everyone a j
friendly smile and say hello to them when pass-;
ing. Now, why can't the soldiers take it the
same way we did as civilians? When a girl
passes and gives a cheery hello, answer her [
with a smile and return her salutation. There is
no need to answer her with cat-calls and
whistles.
Be friendly, soldier, these gals are trying to
be friendly to you, and above all, remember
that they aren't the type of girls you would meet
on the south side of Market street.
