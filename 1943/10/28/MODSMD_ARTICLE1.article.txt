WASHINGTON, Oct. 27. â€”Presi-
dent Roosevelt called upon Congress
today to enact a one billion dollar
post-war educational program em
bracing one year's vocational or aca
demic training for most service men
and women and added schooling up
to three extra years for those with
special aptitude.
He suggested in a message to Con
gress that the basic year's training be
available to all who have served the
minimum period in the armed forces.
His advisory committee recommend
ed a minimum of six months.
Post-War Responsibilities
Mr. Roosevelt stressed that the na
tion must replenish its supply of per
sons qualified to discharge heavy
post-war responsibilities.
"We have taught our youth how to
wage war; we must also teach them
how to use useful and happy lives in
freedom, justice, and decency."
The program would be as follows:
1. Veterans taking the proposed one
year training would be provided with
tuition and a monthly living allow
ance of perhaps $50 for a single per
son and $75 for a married man and
an additional $10 for each child.
Federal Loans
2. Similar financial arrangements
would be provided for those taking
further schooling, and federal loans
up to $50 monthly would be available
for those unable to meet expenses.
3. Despite federal provision of nec
essary funds, state and local control
of educational program would be re
tained.
