# DEBATE
## Squad Seeks New Members 
### 
Although pleased with the pros
pects of the 10 new members of the
•debate squad, Director Gordon Em
erson would like to .see many more
students go out for debate work.
Deba.te may be taken either as a
course for two units credit or purely
as an extra-curricular activity.
Squad members meet two evenings a
week, on Monday and Thursday. So
far the meetings have been Con
cerned with acquiring a general
knowledge of the various aspects of
the topic of post-war education, with
.special emphasis on the advisability
or non-advisability of federal aid to
education after the war.
Full Year Foreseen
In spite of war-time conditions,
this year promises to be a full one as
tar as tournaments are concerned.
Especially since the curtailment of
many other competitive activities in
which Stanford has heretofore taken
part, it is expected that interest in
forensic activities will run high.
USC spokesmen have already sug
gested a renewal of the old platform
debates, complete with audience, and
plans are being made to hold one of
these contests on the USC campus
and one at Stanford.
I„.A. Trip Planned
According to Professor Emerson,
the possibilities of Cal and Stanford
sending joint teams to debate UCLA
and USC in Los Angeles are also
being discussed.
As in past years, Stanford will send
representatives to San Francisco to
contend against a Cal team for the
Commonwealth Club plaque.
Joffre Meet at Cal
The 50th annual contest for the
Medaille Joffre will be held this year
on the Cal campus. "The Big Game
may have been called off, but we
still have our big verbal bout with
the university which is our greatest
rival in forensics as well as in foot
ball," said Virginia Schwartz, debate
manager.
Besides participating in tourna
ments and their accompanying ex
pense-paid trips, squad members will
be given the opportunity to take part
in forum discussions over San Fran
cisco radio stations and speak,
through arrangements by the Stan
ford Speaker's Bureau, before vari
ous civic organizations in the Penin
sula area.

knowledge of the various aspects of
the topic of post-war education, with
.special emphasis on the advisability
or non-advisability of federal aid to
education after the war.
Full Year Foreseen
In spite of war-time conditions,
this year promises to be a full one as
tar as tournaments are concerned.
Especially since the curtailment of
many other competitive activities in
which Stanford has heretofore taken
part, it is expected that interest in
forensic activities will run high.
USC spokesmen have already sug
gested a renewal of the old platform
debates, complete with audience, and
plans are being made to hold one of
these contests on the USC campus
and one at Stanford.
I„.A. Trip Planned
According to Professor Emerson,
the possibilities of Cal and Stanford
sending joint teams to debate UCLA
and USC in Los Angeles are also
being discussed.
As in past years, Stanford will send
representatives to San Francisco to
contend against a Cal team for the
Commonwealth Club plaque.
Joffre Meet at Cal
The 50th annual contest for the
Medaille Joffre will be held this year
on the Cal campus. "The Big Game
may have been called off, but we
still have our big verbal bout with
the university which is our greatest
rival in forensics as well as in foot
ball," said Virginia Schwartz, debate
manager.
Besides participating in tourna
ments and their accompanying ex
pense-paid trips, squad members will
be given the opportunity to take part
in forum discussions over San Fran
cisco radio stations and speak,
through arrangements by the Stan
ford Speaker's Bureau, before vari
ous civic organizations in the Penin
sula area.
Although pleased with the pros
pects of the 10 new members of the
•debate squad, Director Gordon Em
erson would like to .see many more
students go out for debate work.
Deba.te may be taken either as a
course for two units credit or purely
as an extra-curricular activity.
Squad members meet two evenings a
week, on Monday and Thursday. So
far the meetings have been Con
cerned with acquiring a general
knowledge of the various aspects of
the topic of post-war education, with
.special emphasis on the advisability
or non-advisability of federal aid to
education after the war.
