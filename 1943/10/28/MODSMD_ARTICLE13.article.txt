# Dr. Willis Comments On Recent Earthquake
## 
### Joe Hawkins 
The temblor which shook up the
Peninsula and area last Monday
| night, causing considerable damage
in San Jose, was described by Dr.
Bailey Willis, professor emeritus of
geology, as "comparatively slight.''
He explained that formerly earth
i quakes were estimated by the dam
age they did, a number five quake
breaking windows, cracking weak
I walls, and frightening people in gen
! eral.
Centered in San Jose
This approximately describes the
' effects of the shake-up in San Jose,
where the damage in broken win
dows, cracked walls, and fallen plas
ter has been estimated at several
thousand dollars.
The earthquake which started at
j 9:49 p.m. and continued for three
J minutes, was centered northeast of
j San Jose in the foothills, along the
; Hayward rift. The Hayward rift is a
break in the earth's crust running
J through the University of California,
! Hayward, and along the foothills 20
miles south of San Jose, where it
! joins the San Andreas fault which
; was active in 1906.
San Andreas Quiet
According to Dr. Willis, the San
j Andreas fault had nothing to do with
| this quake, and has been relatively
| quiet for several years. However, the
Hayward rift has developed slight
activity for several years.
j "As to when the next earthquake

may be," stated Dr. Willis," the only
sure thing is that the farther you
are from the last one, the nearer you
will be to the next one."
Earthquake Recorded
The earthquake was recorded on
campus by a seismograph located
near the Stanford golf course. This
instrument is owned by the earth
quake department of University of
California, and is one of a group of
lour located at Mount Hamilton,
U.C., Stanford, and Golden Gate
Park in San Francisco. Local and
distant quakes are recorded on all
four and from the records it is pos
sible to say where the shock centered
and what its energy output was.
The quake was so sharp that
needles on several seismographs in
this area were damaged.
