The Shumate Ranch needs more
walnut pickers this weekend. Stu
dents are asked to volunteer for four
hour shifts on Saturday or Sunday.
Transportation will be provided from
the Post Office at 7:45 a.m. and 1
p.m. Saturday and at 11 a.m. Sunday.
Those interested in picking may
sign up in their living groups with
their crop crew representatives or in
the War Board office. Arrangements
have been made for the pickers to be
returned to campus in time for lunch
and dinner.
Tomato pickers are needed at the
Janeke Ranch, 873 Embarcadero,
Palo Alto. Volunteers may go to the
ranch any time during the week,
