# Why We Publish Election Results
## 
### 
THERE has been some criticism of The Daily's
policy of publishing the complete results
of balloting in ASSU elections. Rather natural
ly, this gripe become very pronounced on elec
tion day.
The arguments of those who would dispense
with any sort of report on election returns other
than the listing of winning candidates seem to
revolve around one thought—that the campus
is only interested in knowing who won the
elections and therefore the feelings of the losing
candidates should be spared.
We acknowledge this viewpoint to a certain
extent, but we also feel there are other factors
which inevitably enter the picture and must be
considered.
Our reasons for printing the entire results are:
1) Every voter has the right to know how his
candidate fared in the election. • Therefore, if
the results were not published in The Daily,
they would have to be made public through
some other medium.
2) Anyone who is nominated and consents to
run in an election must realize he is sticking his
neck out. In elections where up to a dozen
people compete for the same office, the chances
are very great that he will not be elected. De
feat is no blight.
3) People of college age are supposedly ma
ture enough to run in an election without fear
of the voters knowing the complete results.
This is no place for excess pampering; we
would not get it outside of college, and now is
not too soon to start facing reality.
4) We hope the system where complete re
sults are published will induce candidates to
run who are sincere and capable and eliminate
those who are ungualified and give no thought
to being nominated for a position in the student
government.
