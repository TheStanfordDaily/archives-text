### BILL ROSE 
THE GREAT PREROGATIVE
Yesterday was a "great day" at Stanford,
according to our personable associate editor,
Irma Cunha. Far be it from me to doubt Miss
Cunha's word—especially when it comes to
elections. Miss Cunha, who is election chair
man at Stanford, probably knows more about
Stanford elections than anyone who knows
anything about Stanford elections.
To get back to this "great day" business. I
guess election day is a "great day" at Stanford
—not as great as Meatless Tuesday or Fishy
Friday, but pretty great nevertheless. My point
is that election day at Stanford is not near as
great as it should be.
I attribute this to the fact that we have so
many elections around here. In fact, Stanford
is about the most election-minded place in the
world. We elect student body officers, class
officers, hall officers, club officers, excommittee
members, cheerleaders, and hundreds of other
officers.
I even know a girl who was elected 2nd vice

president of Lagunita—not just Ist vice presi
dnet, but 2nd vice-president. Now isn't that
carrying things a little far? Next thing you know
we'll be voting for the office of Picker-up of
Waste Paper and Cigarette Butts around the
Quad.
There is a compensating aspect to this welter
of political intrigue, however. We at least can
be sure that democracy is very firmly estab
lished at Stanford.
There have been rumors (which I am in
clined to discount) that there will be no presi
dential election in 1944. Have you ever heard
it even intimated that there will be no election
for the post of vice chairman of Women's Con
ference in 1944? I should say you haven't! Of
course, vice-chairman of Women's Conference
is a pretty important position; but so is the
U.S. presidency.
Seriously though, I'm all for these elections.
You see, people usually aren't very nice to me.
But when election time rolls around, I find sev
eral students smiling at me as we pass on the
Quad. Some even say "Hello."
