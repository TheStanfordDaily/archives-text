To the Editor:
Since letters to the editor pertinent to the
soldier-co-ed relationship seem to to be the
popular (?) rage, we can't resist telling all
Stanford about our ill-fated love affair.
Since these are days of meat shortage and
red ration points, our affair was one of those mul
tiple-triangle things with all 69 of us in love with
the same young lady. Ever since her first debut
at Lasuen Court some two weeks ago she has
caused many a hungry gleam in the eyes of
not only the "Mission Street Boys" but also in
the eyes of the civilians and local canine popu
lation.
What a gal! She had the most beautiful big
bluish-gray eyes, and her skin was as soft, <
lovely, and white as the down on a duck's back.
Her figure was trim and neat, and when she
walked down the street, she had the cutest and
most enticing waddle on campus. (Now don't
take us wrong! It was her natural stroll and
not a "I'm a pickup" swing.) When she whis
pered sweet nothings into your anxious ears,
she cooed as though it was the song of a bird. |
With her athletic prowess she was typically
a boy's girl. If you don't think that she was a
great swimming and diving champion then
you've never seen her in our bathtub. However,
also being feminine, she was at first a bit shy
and bashful because of her new super-supply
of men and the greedy looks cast in her direc
tion; nevertheless she soon overcame her
timidity and would even spend the nights in our
room with only the slightest urging. Since
many of us are '"fresh" from the desert, can
you blame us for falling in love with one so
fair, even though she did have a "fowl" out
look on life?
Well, last Friday our campus cutie either
went AWOL or was forcibly kidnaped. Nat
urally, we've been broken-hearted over the
loss of such a darling friend. The only clue to
her disappearance that we have been able to i
find has been a solitary litle white feather.
Won't someone please help mend our broken
hearts? We would be forever grateful if anyone
finding a duck answering to the name of Yashi
wara, and also to the above description, would
kindly phone 8920 or please give her a gentle
little pat in the vicinity of her tail feathers and
set her off in the direction of Taft Hall.

finding a duck answering to the name of Yashi
wara, and also to the above description, would
kindly phone 8920 or please give her a gentle
little pat in the vicinity of her tail feathers and
set her off in the direction of Taft Hall.

To the Editor:
Since letters to the editor pertinent to the
soldier-co-ed relationship seem to to be the
popular (?) rage, we can't resist telling all
Stanford about our ill-fated love affair.
Since these are days of meat shortage and
red ration points, our affair was one of those mul
tiple-triangle things with all 69 of us in love with
the same young lady. Ever since her first debut
at Lasuen Court some two weeks ago she has
caused many a hungry gleam in the eyes of
not only the "Mission Street Boys" but also in
the eyes of the civilians and local canine popu
lation.
What a gal! She had the most beautiful big
bluish-gray eyes, and her skin was as soft, <
lovely, and white as the down on a duck's back.
Her figure was trim and neat, and when she
walked down the street, she had the cutest and
most enticing waddle on campus. (Now don't
take us wrong! It was her natural stroll and
not a "I'm a pickup" swing.) When she whis
pered sweet nothings into your anxious ears,
she cooed as though it was the song of a bird. |
With her athletic prowess she was typically
a boy's girl. If you don't think that she was a
great swimming and diving champion then
you've never seen her in our bathtub. However,
also being feminine, she was at first a bit shy
and bashful because of her new super-supply
of men and the greedy looks cast in her direc
tion; nevertheless she soon overcame her
timidity and would even spend the nights in our
room with only the slightest urging. Since
many of us are '"fresh" from the desert, can
you blame us for falling in love with one so
fair, even though she did have a "fowl" out
look on life?
Well, last Friday our campus cutie either
went AWOL or was forcibly kidnaped. Nat
urally, we've been broken-hearted over the
loss of such a darling friend. The only clue to
her disappearance that we have been able to i
find has been a solitary litle white feather.
Won't someone please help mend our broken
hearts? We would be forever grateful if anyone
finding a duck answering to the name of Yashi
wara, and also to the above description, would
kindly phone 8920 or please give her a gentle
little pat in the vicinity of her tail feathers and
