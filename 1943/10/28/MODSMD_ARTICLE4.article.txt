# ONE-ACTS
## Priorities on Lumber Cut Stage Settings 
### 
Two main problems are bothering John Ford Sollers. technical director
for the one-acts to be presented by the Stanford Players on Nov. 10. 11,
12, 13, and 15 in the Memorial Theater. Because of priorities on lumber the
theater must use odds and ends from other productions to piece out the
scenes for the November show.
More important is the need for volunteer help for technical work in

Khe show. In past years pre-med
students or engineers not particu
larly interested in acting, but inter
ested in the theater were signed on
the technical crews.
Mr. Sollers particularly asks for
students who have had experience in
the work before. No particular
amount of time is required.
Sets Built Low
Sets for the one-acts are being
built low and the width of the stage
has been reducedâ€”possibly because
of the small cast in each play. No
setting is required for Thornton
Wilder's ''Happy Journey" which de
pends entirely upon the pantomime
of the actors for the audience inter
pretation. The curtain will go up on
a stage dressed no more than it
would be for a rehearsal.
Two sets are required for George
Bernard Shaw's "A Village Wooing."
The first, to portray a scene on ship
board, will be accomplished with
deck chairs placed at a ship railing.
The second scene presents a problem.
Three chairs and a store counter can
be found to simulate a store but no
tin cans are available for properties.
Faculty members are cooperating
admirably in donating what tin cans
they have for the shelves, but most of
the donations so far have been baby
food cans. However, appropriate
costumes are being thought up as a
disguise.
Jail Dominates Setting
William Sferoyan's "Hello Out
There" takes place in the jail of a
small Texas town. A corner of the
cell and bars will dominate the set
ting, slightly distorted to fit the mood
of the play. The mood will be cap
tured mostly in the low lighting ef
fects while the action will be sym
bolized in the subtle lighting changes.
