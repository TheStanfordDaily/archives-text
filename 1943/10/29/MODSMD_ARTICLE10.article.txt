Accepting an invitation from the University of California, Stanford stu
dents will have a rooting section at the California-UCLA football game on
Nov. 13, in which over a dozen former Farm athletes will participate.
This invitation was inclosed in a letter from Natalie Burdick, President
of the Associated Students of the University of California to Janet Mc-

student ooay president
here at Stanford. Miss McClanahan
immediately accepted the invitation
in the name of the Stanford students.
California, through their graduate
manager, Clint Evans, has set aside
the section directly across the field
from her own to be used by the
Stanford students. Only 800 can be
accommodated, however, due to
tickets already promised to Cai
alumni and friends. The tickets will
sell at $1.20 per person, a special rate
saving each Stanford student one
dollar. Because of this special rate,
only one ticket will be sold to each
person who presents his Stanford
student body card, either soldier or
civilian.
Tickets will go on sale Monday at
the ASSU office.
Although several outstanding
Farm athletes were transferred from
Cal a week ago. there is still a good
representation with such men as
Hachten, Madigan, Frisbee, Monroe,
Barsocchini and others still playing
for the Bears.
Down at Westwood on the Bruin
campus there are Brown, Andrews,
and Rohrer who once played for
Stanford, as well as three other
former Indians.
Stanford will have a rooting sec
tion at the game, under the leader
ship of Ric Supple, newly elected yell
leader. Further announcements con
cerning the rooting section will be
made by Cardinals.
