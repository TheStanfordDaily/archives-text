# School Will Train Army Dietitians
## 
### 
Stanford women who are inter
ested in applying for positions as
Army dietitians may receive all the
necessary training in the nutrition
department here at Stanford; then
may make application to the govern
ment and receive a rank equivalent
to second lieutenant in the Army,"
according to Miss Dorothy Tilden,
assistant professor of nutrition in the
School of Health.
If the women wish to apply at the
end of four years for a six-month
apprenticeship, they will complete
their training in an Army hospital,
she added.
An introductory course in Foods
and Nutrition is being offered by {
Miss Tilden, which is open to all I
women on the campus. If anyone is
interested in becoming a trained !
dietitian, she should see Miss Tilden !
in Room 12 of the Education Build
ing.
So much interest has been shown
in the food courses that it has been
necessary to make two additions to |
the staff. Miss Virginia Harger, who
is from Ohio University, and Mrs. |
Marchand from San Francisco State j
College have been added to the ;
teaching staff.
