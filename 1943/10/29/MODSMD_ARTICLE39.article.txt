Volunters to work in the Victory
Garden of the Con Home are needed
this Saturday morning. Twenty
workers are asked to sign up in their
living groups. Transportation will be
provided and will leave Roble at
9:15 a.m.
Work at the Con Home will in
clude picking vegetables, weeding
the garden, and performing various
odd jobs that will be assigned by
Sam McDonald, caretaker.
Tomato pickers are still urgently
needed at the Janeke Ranch, 873
Embarcadero, Palo Alto. A bus will
take workers to the tomato ranch at
11 a.m. Sunday morning from the
post office. Mr. Janeke owns a 30-
acre farm but has only one helper to
pick his tomatoes, and therefore will
be very grateful for help from stu
dents.
