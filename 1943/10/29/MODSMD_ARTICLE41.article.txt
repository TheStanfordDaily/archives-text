# New Exhibit in Hoover War Libe
## 
### 
Two collections of weapons used in
the first World War are now on ex
hibit in the west display room of the
Hoover Library. They are from two
collections, one made by Ist Lieut.
Frank Marisehof the 23rd Engineers,
AEF, and the other by Capt. H. L.
Detriek of the 24th Engineers, AEF;
•nd have been presented to Stanford
during the last academic year.
The Marisch collection was given
to the University by Mr. Marisch,
whose son, Frank Marisch Jr., is now
:n the advanced ROTC here. Mr.
Detriek died several years ago and
his collection was presented by his
two sons, Foster Detriek, Stanford
'27, and Dana Detriek, Stanford '33.
Although most of the articles are
German, there are also two French
machine guns, bayonets, and helmets
•included in the Marisch collection.
The display also includes two Amer
ican helmets; so that the three types
may be compared. It is rather sig
nificant that only the German hel
mets are the ones that are camou
flaged.
In a letter to the University Mr.
'Marisch stated that he was in France
several months after the armistice
cleaning up the battlefields. The
German machine gun which is in the
collection was found on Christmas
Day. 1918, in the Argonne Forest
near Varennes.
