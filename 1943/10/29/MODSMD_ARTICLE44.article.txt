# Bike Traffic Problem Arises
## 
### 
Any Stanford man or woman who
! can remember the Farm as it was in
! the "good old days" before the war,
will recall the 1,200 automobiles
which all but wore the pavement off
the streets day and night, and which
; crowded every available bit of park
ing space on the campus.
There were bright, new converti
bles and scratched-up Model A's.
; And there was plenty of gasoline in
| those days to keep them going. Even
those students who didn't own cars
could always get rides to Paly across
from English Corner.
But as the automobile ratio
j dropped with the war. the bicycle
ratio rose to create a new traffic
problem for Stanford Police Chief
Gordy Davis.
As the number of bikes on campus
increased, the parking problem in
creased more than any other. With
only a limited number of bike racks
in front of the Union Cellar, Educa
tion Building, and Main Libe, stu
j dents found it necessary to park their
' bikes in the streets, walks, and door
| ways.
Meanwhile, as more parking facili
ties are being arranged by the police
i department, Gordy Davis has issued
I a special appeal to students not to
[ park their bikes in busy doorways,
especially the Cellar entrance, which
is entirely blocked at times.
Students riding their bikes in the
Central Quad has created another
j headache for Davis, who has request
,ed that bikes be kept, out of the
Quad arcades. Above all, he has
i asked that bikes be parked only in
j racks and adjacent areas to lessen
I congestion and avoid accidents.
