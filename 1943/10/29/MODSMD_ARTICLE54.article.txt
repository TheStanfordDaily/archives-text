After many hours of studying as
trological charts, the four Daily
football experts finally made their
predictions on the important games
to be played this week-end. For the
benefit of those who have not been
following the predictions for the j
past weeks, the experts are: Roger '
Corman, noted authority on foot
ball; Ed Luce, former sports editor
of Ihe Daily; Don Langendorf, pres
ents sports editor, and yours truly.
Now for a look at the picks.
U.S.C. is picked to beat Califor- :
nia by at least 20, maybe more.
The experts expect St. Mary's to
take U.S.F. by 7, with the Dons put
ting up their best fight of the sea
son, possibly even eeking out a win. j
St. Mary's Pre-Flight should take I
March Field by 7, while San Diego
Naval Training Station should be 6
points better than U.C.L.A. Expert
Corman held out for the Uclans.
In the only remaining important !
game on the coast, the Washington |

Huskies were picked to take the Sec
ond Air Force by 14.
Texas A. and M., the powerhouse
of the Southern Conference, should
have very little trouble with Ar
kansas. Make it the Aggies by 20.
One of the big games of the week
end is the Army-Penn game. The
experts think it will be Armv bv 13.

Holy Cross should take a beating a f
the hands of Colgate—but not by
much, while Columbia is expected,
to take a drubbing from Cornel!.
The Ithacans will be pretty mad
after last week's defeat at the hand-}
of Colgate and will win by 14 points
—at least, the experts say so.
Here are the rest of the choices.
Yale over Dartmouth by 12. Duke
over Georgia Tech by 12. Tulane
over Georgia Pre-Flight by 3, with
Langendorf picking the Pre-Flight -
ers to win. Michigan over Illinois
by 19. Indiana over Ohio State by
7. Expert Langendorf again held
out, picking the Buckeyes by 3.
The experts were split on the
Texas Christian - Louisiana State
game and it was finally decided that
L.S.U. should win by 1.
Northwestern over Minnesota by
12. Expert Gugel held out for the
I Gophers. Notre Dame over Navy
by at least 9. Purdue over Wiscon
sin by 21. Texas over S.M.U. by 12
and Southwestern over Tulsa by 7.
Corman disagreed and chose Tulsa.
In the special pick of the week,
the experts decided that Bowling
