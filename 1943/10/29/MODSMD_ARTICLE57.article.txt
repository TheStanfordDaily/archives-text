ON THE front page is an invitation from the
University of California to attend their foot
ball game with UCLA. We are sure the entire
student body will realize and appreciate this
gesture of friendliness.
California has offered us a block of 800 seats
opposite their rooting section at half the price.
We can have our own yells, and we can see a
good football game with our former stalwarts on
the field.
But in accepting this invitation, there are a
:few important things we must remember.
We will be the guests of Cal and not their
rivalsâ€”our spirit must be impartial and by all
means positive for both teams. Our purpose in
attending the game will be to show the Sons
of Stanford in the Service that our famed spirit
is not dead. To accomplish this we cannot take
sides.
