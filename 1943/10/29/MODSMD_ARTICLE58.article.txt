# The 						Place to Eat
## 
### 
BECAUSE of the present difficulty in hiring
cooks, not all of the University dining halls
located in former fraternity houses were able
to begin serving at the beginning of the quar
ter. Men who would have been able to eat in
these halls had to get their meals at the Union
Dining Hall or at the Cellar.
These public facilities have been seriously
overcrowded, and long lines of students have
had to wait to get lunches and dinners.
Now the sixth student dining room has
opened in Cleveland Hall. But it is only serving
to half its capacity â€” 20 more men students
could be accommodated. And the strain could
be partially lifted from the Union and Cellar.
Applications for meal tickets for Cleveland
Hall are obtainable at the Office of the Dean of
Men. And from every angle, it would be de
sirable to fill that dining hall.
