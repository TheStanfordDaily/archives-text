# Hello and Goodbye
## 
### 
ALTHOUGH Wednesday was officially des
ignated as Navy Day, this has been Navy
Week on the Stanford campus, and much navy
blue has mingled with the familiar khaki on
the Quad these last few days.
From Colorado College, Cal Tech, UCLA,
and Cal have come the Stanford students who
left the Farm a few months ago for active duty
with the Navy and Marines.
Wherever they have been assigned, they
have given generously of their ability and lead
ership in college activities. But that they have
taken a few days of their brief leaves to return
to this campus is pleasant evidence that their
hearts still belong to Stanford.
To them we say welcome and farewell; it's
been nice seeing you again.â€”Peggy Boothe
