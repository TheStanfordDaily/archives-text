### BILL ROSE 
SHE LOST IT AT DINAH'S
Wednesday's Daily carried a small story con
cerning the theft of a Wave's hat at Dinah's
Saturday, Oct. 15. We could say: "What was

the Wave doing at Dinah's anyway?" But let
us be more sympathetic. Let us say we are
sorry the Wave lost her hat. Waves' hats are,
as Wartime Vogue would say, "tres chic." It
is too bad they have to be lost.
What gripes me is that this Wave, or Dinah's,
or whoever it was, would so underestimate the
Stanford student body as to implicate it in this
larceny.
After all, what is a Wave's hat to a Stanfordite
or a Stanfordite to a Wave's hat? I, personally,
have no use for one. Have you?
There is an old service tradition about a girl
taking a soldier's cap and expecting a kiss in
return. Whether or not this has been carried
over to the female branches of the service in
vice versa form, I do not know. However, I
contribute this angle free of charge to any de
tectives who might be working on the case.
I should like also to know why the loss of her
hat might lead to this Wave's discharge I can
imagine the serious consequences if her head
was in the hat at the time. But otherwise, I
am really befuddled as to why this is such a
grave misdemeanor.
If officials are intending a thorough search
of the campus for the missing chapeau, might
I suggest the head of the Angel of Grief as a
likely place for a Wave's hat?

If you see an extra large number of eager
young faces around the campus tomorrow,
don't think that we're suddenly getting a new
flock of freshmen. These inspired visages will
be the property of the delegates to no less an
auspicious gathering than the 20th Annual
Convention of the Central California Scholastic
Press Association.
This collection of Daily fodder will be treated
to an all-day program of lectures, conferences
and tours under the sponsorship of the Univer
sity's Department of lournalism.
If any of you run across these high school
Winchells, please be courteous and pleasant to
them. One of them might be a future editor of
The Daily or (than which there is nothing
worse) a future Bull Sessioner.
