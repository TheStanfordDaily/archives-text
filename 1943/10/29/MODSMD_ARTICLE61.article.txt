To the Editor:
Set us right. We have always assumed that
the privileges of being a Stanford student in
clude use of the library and its seating accom
modations. If so, even in the face of a national
emergency, we who have been told that we will
be the educators of the future generation think
it should be possible to augment our classroom
instruction with the outside reading suggested.
Unfortunately this is not possible under the
present conditions.
One enters the library only to find that every
single seat is occupied—predominantly by
olive drab clad figures. We realize that the
barracks lack ample facilities for studying and
therefore only a few soldiers can be accom
modated there. Of course we do not condemn
them for frequenting the library when they find
it is necessary to use books on reserve. It is
their privilege as a part of Stanford. However,
we do condemn all those soldiers (and civilians)
who occupy valuable and much needed space
for social and other such unnecessary purposes.
One can chat, write letters, or read Life else
where.
Either other rooms on the Quad should be
opened to the Army for use or more tables (and
seats) should be supplied in the library. Other
wise, how can we possibly fulfill our outside
reading requirements unless we sit on the heads
of the learned stone statues on the front of the
Libe?
