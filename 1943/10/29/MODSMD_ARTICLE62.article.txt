STORMY WEATHER—Now playing
'"Stormy Weather" is a gay, spark
ling musical with an all-colored cast
headed by exotic Lena Home and
dancing Bill Robinson. Sepia enter
tainment seems to be much in de
mand these days and 20th Century
Fox has certainly done all right by
this film. There're a half dozen fine
tunes in the picture, including the
tantalizing "Stormy Weather" and
the seductive "I Can't Give You
Anything But Love, Baby."
The plot, or what little there is of
it, relates the struggle of Bill Robin
son, just back from the first World
War, to dance his way to fame. He's
given more than moral encourage
ment by Lena Horne, who winds up
as Bill's bride-to-be in the final
close-up. Cab Calloway and his band
are also on hand to lend a lot of
noise to the occasion. The high spots
of the film, at least to this reviewer,
were Lena Home's really terrific
songs. Brother, when she starts to
sing, the whole world stops to listen.
The second feature is the spy
drama "Background to Danger"
which finds George Raft matching
wits with sinister Peter Loire and
rotund Sidney Greenstreet. Brenda
Marshall is on hand just to keep the
romantic element alive. "Background
to Danger" has its share of thrills,
besides some good acting jobs, and
will make good entertainment for
those who can swallow a rather fan
tastic plot.—Bower
