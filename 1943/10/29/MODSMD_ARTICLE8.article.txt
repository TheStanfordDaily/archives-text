After hearing Carol Hurwitz re
port on the War Board's plans for
renovating the Nitery, Excom at its
meeting Wednesday night voted its
full approval and recommended that
the proposal be referred to the Un
ion Board of Governors as soon as
possible.
Committee members expressed
the opinion that the increased use
of the Nitery justifies the improve
ments. They agreed also that redec
orating would simplify the problem
of keeping the place clean as well
as making it a more attractive rec
reation center for students.

dent's office asking for suggestions
