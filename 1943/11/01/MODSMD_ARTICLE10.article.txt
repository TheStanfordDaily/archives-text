# Allies Take Towns Near Isernia Road
## 
### 
ALLIED HQ., Algiers, Nov. 1â€”
Driving three miles along both sides
of the Isernia Road in a bid to split
the new German line in Italy, Allied
troops have captured San Massino
and San Elena, but on the Adriatic
sector our forces have fallen back
slightly before sharp Nazi counter
blows, it was announced today.
Allied air and sea forces added
new weight to the developing Ital
ian land offensive. United States
warships shelled the road and the
railway tunnel entrance at Scauri,
in their second attack in three days
on enemy communications along the
Gulf of Gaeta. Flying Fortresses
pounded three key rail points on the
Italian Riviera for the first time
and Liberators gave Genoa its second
hammering in two days.
