UCLA has now'lost five straight
football games while winning none.
The strange thing about the Bruins'
poor showing is that they are bol
stered by a Navy V-12 unit. If this
is the best the Uclans can do with the
help of the Navy, think about what
would have happened to Stanford if
we had attempted to field a team of
17-year-olds, 4-F's, and 2-A's. It
would have been a great gesture of
sportsmanship fqr the alumni and
sports writers to brag about, but it
would have been sheer murder for
the fellows who made up the team.
Thinking it over, maybe the big
Red Machine made a wise move
when it decided to depart from the
grid wars for the duration.
Football, however, is an entirely
different story than basketball, base
ball, track, and tennis, our other
major sports. Football would have
been a hardship on a small, weakly
manned squad expected to compete
with such powerful grid giants as
S.C., C.0.P., and others, but putting
less emphasis on brute strength and
weight than the grid sport, the other
sports can and should be continued.
The athletes want the other sports
and the student body wants them.
Transportation is no problem as there
are enough colleges in the Bay Area
to provide a good schedule. We might
not have a championship team, but
we have the men to put together
squads that would be a credit to the
University. If small colleges like St.
Mary's and San Francisco can main
tain full sports programs, Stanford
can certainly maintain a modified
program. There was a good reason
for dropping football, but there is
none for abolishing all other sports.
