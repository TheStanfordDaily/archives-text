# Red Cross Knitters To Meet; Inexperienced Girls Welcome
## 
### Joan Hodgdon 
If you know how to knit you can join the knitting group that .meets
Tuesday and Thursday afternoons from 3:45 to 5:45 in Dean Mary Yost's
home. If you don't you can learn while you make articles needed by sol
diers overseas.
The yarn is furnished by the Red Cross, and girls are now knitting rifle

*â–  mittens, knee bands, beanies, and
j sweaters. More yarn is expected
I soon so that those who wish may
I start work on socks, scarfs, and hel
i mets.
All girls on campus are invited by
Sally Van Dyke, War Board knit-
I ting chairman, to "come and knit
j even if they have never seen a knit-
I ting needle." "We always have fun."
j says Miss Van Dyke, "chatting and
listening to the radio while we knit."
Girls are asked to provide their
| own knitting needles, but instruc
tions for the various articles are pro
vided by the Red Cross. Knitters may
come on either Tuesday or Thursday
I or for one hour both days.
