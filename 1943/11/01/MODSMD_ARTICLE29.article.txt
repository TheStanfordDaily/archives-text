### BILL ROSE 
GLOOMY MONDAY
It's wonderful how easily Stanfordites can break through
iheir shiny gloss of smooth sophistication and reveal themselves
as the school kids they really are. It took only the impetus of
a children's holiday (Hallowe'en) to do the trick this time.
The result: a Model T at the bottom of the D.U. pool. This
marks the all-time low in the sordid history of ungentlemanly
deeds perpetrated by Stanford "gentlemen." It ranks with the
famous mock graduation in Frost Amphitheater as the nadir of
collegiate behavior.

Speaking of charges, I received guite a formidable one in the
mail yesterday. It concerned Friday's column. A deluge of
approbrium has been heaped upon me for my treatment of the
hatless Wave.
My accuser claims that the hat actually was taken by Stan
ford studentsâ€”three male ones to be exact. If this is true, let
me herewith apologize to the maligned Ensign for my defense
of my fellow students.
Let me also suggest that the person who wrote the letter
make some attempt to recover the young lady's noggin piece,
[112 he recognized the thieves as Stanford students, he must have
seen them on campus frequently. Therefore, he should have no
great difficulty in identifying them. And certainly the Wave
could easily prove her ownership of the hat.
However, this whole matter strikes me as somewhat trivial.
I only mentioned the incident in my column because I thought
it would give me a good chance to be funny. Evidently I laid
an egg. I'm sorry.
