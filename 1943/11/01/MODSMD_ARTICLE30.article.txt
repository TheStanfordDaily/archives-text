To the Editor:
We men of Taft Hall thought the phrase "every cloud has a
silver lining" a tritism as we moped, brokenheartedly, mourning
the loss of our beloved Yasiwara. Was this the spirit, the tradi
tion of Stanford that we had heard about, to take this poor,
defenseless female from us, to deprive us of the love and affec
tion we had come to know?
Suddenly, in our darkest hour, as our torch song was being
sung on the Quad, in the shadow, of the Libe, and on Maloney
Field, our answer came to us. Through the gloom cast on Lasuen
came a roar of thunder and a golden ray of sunshine disguised
as a truck. The delicious spray of excited laughter drifted to our
door as a group of sorority girls clambered down from the chariot.
Peering into the midst of the confusion the emotions of all
turned to joy, for there stood one whom we took to be our
lovable Yashiwara; howveer, the kindled flame guickly died as
we found her to be other than our "thing of beauty and joy
forever." Saddened, too, by our great loss, our neighbors, the
altruistic A.O.Pi's, had brought us a substitute. Immediately,
the old adage "beware of Greeks bearing gifts" overpower our
thoughts. However, overcoming the feeling that there is no
love like the first love, we accepted the young lady into out
open arms. After all, if the women are for you, who cares who's
against you.
With her mysterious authority of beauty "Hasemawaru" (in
one mouthful it's just plain "Hase") has turned the tide of our
favoritism in her favor. She really does your eyes a favor when
you gaze upon her trim figure of dangerous curves. With her
red nose she waddles up to you like an inebriate approaching
from various directions. Unlike Yashiwara our new feathered
friend has already exhibited her aerial antics. If gazing into the
sky at any time you should see a silver streak, you'll imme
diately know that it's not a bird, it's not a plane, it's not Super
man, it's Hashimawaru!
