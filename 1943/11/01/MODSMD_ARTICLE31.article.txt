## Carradine Is Good Hamlet 
### 
By the way—Shakespeare wrote
that stuff with the presumption that
it would be acted, with all due credit
to Shakespeare authorities by book
or inclination throughout the land,
it's got to be acted, even now.
John Carradine and his Shake
speare Players are at the Geary now,
beginning the last week of a two
week engagement in which they will
do "The Merchant of Venice" until
Wednesday night and "Othello" from
Thursday to Saturday.
John Carradine is their Shylock
and he was Hamlet in the first play
of the trio. He was not a fine-looking
Hamlet but he was a fine-speaking
sincere, and understanding Hamlet
who made the most popularly cari
catured and time-worn speeches
something thrilling, startlingly fresh,
and eloquent. Speeches were superb,
but then the lines are hard to make
otherwise, 'tis said.
The movements of Carradine are
even as eloquent. The gait that the
moody Hamlet assumes in the scene
with Ophelia, when she and Polonius
attempt to convince the king that she
is the cause of Hamlet's sad dispo
sition, was magnificently indicative
of the youth he wished to be, con
trasted with his general mien of
despair.
Carradine's bent, impressive Shy
lock had the same forcefulness in
every detail. He aroused both pity
and contempt, and understanding for
both. This play abounds in humor
ous by-play, with an especially good
"Gobbo," the clown.
Such good Shakespearean inter
pretation is not confined to Carradine
but he is supported by an excellent
cast of young people surprisingly
harmonious in interpretation and
well cast. The women in the cast are
noticeably weak in their roles, but in
all adequate.—Giannini
