# Sororities Plan Open Houses For Weekend
## 
### 
Rushing for transfer women in
Upper Division and second prelim
inary rushing for freshman women
will begin this Friday, according to
Dorothy Suppiger, Panhellenic presi
dent. The sororities will hold a series
of open houses to which both fresh
men and transfer students will be in
vited. This is preliminary rushing
for freshmen women, for whom for
mal rushing will not begin until
Winter Quarter.
Miss Suppiger stated that the most
important rule for the transfer
women to remember during their
rushing period is that one woman
may go to one sorority a maximum
of three times. The transfers will be
invited to a variety of social func
tions: luncheons, teas, dinners, and
dances. Informality will be stressed
throughout the transfer rushing.
Friday dessert from 7 to 9 p.m. will
be the first function for freshman
women. On Saturday there will be
teas from 3 to 5 p.m. and dessert
parties from 7 to 9, and afternoon tea
will be served again on Sunday. All
women are asked to wear Quad
clothes and name tags.
Freshman women will be classified
alphabetically and the sorority
houses divided into four groups. The
women will go to the houses accord
ing to their alphabetical group. Later
this week the Daily will publish both
the divisions of the sororities and
the new women.
Transfer rushing will end Dec. 7,
as new pledges wishing to live in
the houses must make reservations
for living accommodations Winter
Quarter by Dec. 8.
