The trek to Cal will be for the pur
pose of rooting for the various former
Stanford athletes on the California j
I Bears and the UCLA Bruins. Num- I
j bering over a dozen men, these ath- j
! letes form the nucleus of both the i
Bear and the Bruin team. On the \
: Bruin first team are three former j
| Cards: Brown, Rohrer, and Andrews;
while on Cal's firsts q-uad are Hach- i
ten, Madigan, and possibly Frisbee.
California has sent 800 tickets to be
sold at the reduced rate of $1.20, in- |
eluding the tax. Only persons pre
j senting student body cards will bo

sold tickets. Tickets will be sold only
i one to a person, so that outsiders
| won't be allowed.
Soldiers also will be able to get
tickets by presenting their ASSU
cards. Only 800 persons can be ac
commodated in Memorial Stadium
due to committments already made
to alumni and friends of the Bears.
If there should be any tickets un
sold by Nov. 11, they will have to be
returned to Cal to be sold at general
| sale at the time of the game.
The game on the 13th starts at 2
j p.m. in Berkeley. Students having
j 11 o'clock classes on Saturday should
i try to drive to the game. It takes
j roughly an hour and a half to drive
to Cal. By taking the 10:44 train,
j students will arrive in San Francisco
i at 11:30.
Hie Supple, newly elected yell
; leader, will direct all the yells for
! the rooting section which will be di
rectly across from UC's.
