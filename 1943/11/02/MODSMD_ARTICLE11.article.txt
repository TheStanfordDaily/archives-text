## Cal Promises More Tickets 
### Don Langendorf 
Making the ASSU office look as
though a tornado had swept through
it, Stanford students yesterday pur
chased the 800 tickets allotted them
in a mere hour and a half. Strewn
around the office were papers, ciga
rette butts, and plenty of dust
brought on by a mob, the likes of
which the office hasn't seen in years.
Although our supply of tickets has
been exhausted, we have been prom
ised 500 more tickets by Clint Evans,
graduate manager of the University
of California. The tickets are on
their way by mail and it is expected
that they will arrive in time to go on
sale at 1 p.m. Wednesday. Not all
these tickets are in the same section
as the original 800, because, as we
have stated, tickets had been prom
ised to Cal alumni and season ticket
holders. Those not getting tickets in
the Stanford section may buy tickets
for seats not so far away.
Itw as never expected by the
ASSU officers that the tickets would
be sold so soon. They were even
doubtful whether the students would
be behind the invitation with the
enthusiasm enough to buy as many
as 500 tickets, let alone 800. Through
this demonstration, we have seen
that Stanford Spirit is not dead but
very much alive.
Those who haven't purchased their
ducats as yet are reminded that they
have to present their student body
cards at the time of purchase. Not
more than two tickets will be sold to
a student. The soldiers stationed on
campus are also welcome to come to
the game as they are considered
Stanford men.
The Stanford section will be di
rectly across from the Bear section
and will be led by Ric Supple, newly
elected yell leader.
No tickets will be sold today.
