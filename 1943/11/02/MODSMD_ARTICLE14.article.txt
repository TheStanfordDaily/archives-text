## 
### 
Professor Morgan, who is a member-elect for 1944, will take part in the
for New York, where he will attend a meeting next weekend of the Com
mission on Trends in Education of the Modern Language Association of
America.
Professor Morgan, who is a member elect for 1f)44, will take part in the

discussions of the revision of the
Commission's 1940 report on "Lan
ijui'ge in American Education."
The new teaching methods in use
.at Stanford and other universities
which now have Army language
classes will be taken into account in
the preparation of the new edition,
according to Dr. Morgan.
"I am inclined to believe that the
.sensational claims made about the
shortness of time necessary to ac
quire a fluent speaking knowledge of
a foreign language under this widely
advertised intensified study plan are
being mis-interpreted and misunder
stood," said Professor Morgan.
Mr. Morgan believes that although
the achievements of the intensified
â€¢plan have been considerable, they
represent an emergency endeavor,
and that in a peacetime situation,
where speed is not an essential factor,
best results can be attained by
spreading the training time out over
a longer period.
"In a report like the one the Com
mission is preparing, we must lay the
main stress on procedures which can
be developed and maintained in nor
mal times, and in the deliberations
of the Commission, I hope to work
toward long-term planning for lan
guage teaching," Professor Morgan
stated.
