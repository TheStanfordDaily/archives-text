Roble, Lagunita, and a number of
the sororities were serenaded Sunday
night by a large group of Stanford
men, under the direction of Ric
Supple, head yell leader.
The "Hallowe'en Serenaders"
started out about 9 and stopped first
at Roble where they sang Stanford
songs and gave some yells. They
then went to Lagunita and got per
mission to go into the inner court,
where they sang more songs and
gave more yells.
The group then turned back and
started up the row, stopping at each
sorority along the way.
A group of girls from Lagunita also
went serenading last night, stopping
at Roble, Casa Ventura, and Sequoia.
