ALLIED H.Q., Southwest Pacific,
Nov. 2. â€” American amphibious
troops, side-stepping the strongly
held Japanese bases at Buin and
Faisi in the southern Bougainville
area, landed in strength on the
western coast of Bougainville Mon
day to place forces within 250 miles
of the major enemy strongholds at
Rabaul, New Britain, a communique
announced today.
Gen. Douglas Mac Arthur an
nounced that the American troops
went ashore at Empress August Bay
only 45 air miles northwest of Buin.
The main invasion forces jumped
200 miles from Allied bases in the
southern Solomons to go behind the
Japanese seaplane base at Faisi on
Shortland Island off the southern
Bougainville coast.
American troops now are behind
outlying enemy forces still holding
out on Mona and Sterling islands in
the Treasury group where American
and New Zealand forces landed last
Wednesday, and on Choiseul Island
nearly 100 miles to the southeast
where American paratroops landed
from sea craft Thursday.
Adin. William F. Halsey's forces
from the South Pacific carried out
the new offensive thrusts in the drive
against Rabaul, meeting little op
position in the landing. The Ameri
can troops now threaten New Britain
Island and menace the Japanese in

the entire south and southwest Pa
cific area.
