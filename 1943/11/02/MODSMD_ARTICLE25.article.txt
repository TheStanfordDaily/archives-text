## Football Enters Second Round 
### Roger Corman 
Getting under way this afternoon,
the second round of the intramural
touch football league will feature the
game between unbeaten Tyler Hall
and powerful Gerona A.C. The top
game in League A, the game is rated
a toss-up, however the potent scor
ing combination of Joe Scott and
Scott Chaffee for Tyler may give the
frosh hall a slight edge.
Fresh from a crushing victory over
Company D of the Army, Dinah's
should be several touchdowns better
than Fillmore. Loren LaPrade and
Hy Hebert can really make things
hot for the opposition and will prob
ably head a Dinah's touchdown pa
rade.
Navy Meets Co. D
Unbeaten Navy clashes with Co. D
team 2 in what should be one of the
best games of the day. The strong
and tricky Navy club should prove
too much for the Army squad, but
anything can happen and probably
will. Take Navy by a touchdown.
Potentially the strongest team in
the circuit, the undefeated Firehouse
should coast to an easy victory over
undermanned Adams.
Other League A games pit McKin
ley against Theta Hashers, Fightin'
O.M. versus Monroe, and Veritas
A.C. against the Stoates.
Army Favored
The top game of League B brings
together Army Co. C and Tappa
Kegga Lager. The Army showed a
tricky running attack in nosing out
Lincoln Hall last week and rates an
edge over their opponents.
The Walter Thompson Co-op op
poses the McKinley B team, and on
the strength of their last week's win
shouldn't have much trouble with
the weak McKinley squad.
One of the closest contests of the
day pits Buchanan against Army Co.
D. Both teams looked good in their
previous games, but the soldiers
should have the reserve power to
outlast the civilians.
Lincoln Plays Monroe
Undefeated Co. L.F.A. meets Co.
E team 2 and should emerge on the
long end of the score. They ran
through Garfield Hall last week
without much trouble, and although
their competition is tougher this
week .they'll probably maintain their
undefeated record.
Lincoln Hall was nosed out by
Army Co. C last Thursday in one of
the best games of the day, and should
bounce back into the win column to
day at the expense of the Monroe B
team.

undefeated record.
Lincoln Hall was nosed out by
Army Co. C last Thursday in one of
the best games of the day, and should
bounce back into the win column to
day at the expense of the Monroe B
team.
Other games in League B pit Army
Co. E team 3 against Vanßuren
Hall, and Army Co. E team 1 against
Garfield.
Getting under way this afternoon,
the second round of the intramural
touch football league will feature the
game between unbeaten Tyler Hall
and powerful Gerona A.C. The top
game in League A, the game is rated
a toss-up, however the potent scor
ing combination of Joe Scott and
Scott Chaffee for Tyler may give the
frosh hall a slight edge.
Fresh from a crushing victory over
Company D of the Army, Dinah's
should be several touchdowns better
than Fillmore. Loren LaPrade and
Hy Hebert can really make things
hot for the opposition and will prob
ably head a Dinah's touchdown pa
rade.
Navy Meets Co. D
Unbeaten Navy clashes with Co. D
team 2 in what should be one of the
best games of the day. The strong
and tricky Navy club should prove
too much for the Army squad, but
anything can happen and probably
will. Take Navy by a touchdown.
Potentially the strongest team in
the circuit, the undefeated Firehouse
should coast to an easy victory over
undermanned Adams.
Other League A games pit McKin
ley against Theta Hashers, Fightin'
O.M. versus Monroe, and Veritas
A.C. against the Stoates.
Army Favored
The top game of League B brings
together Army Co. C and Tappa
Kegga Lager. The Army showed a
tricky running attack in nosing out
Lincoln Hall last week and rates an
edge over their opponents.
The Walter Thompson Co-op op
poses the McKinley B team, and on
the strength of their last week's win
shouldn't have much trouble with
the weak McKinley squad.
One of the closest contests of the
day pits Buchanan against Army Co.
D. Both teams looked good in their
previous games, but the soldiers
should have the reserve power to
outlast the civilians.
Lincoln Plays Monroe
Undefeated Co. L.F.A. meets Co.
E team 2 and should emerge on the
long end of the score. They ran
through Garfield Hall last week
without much trouble, and although
their competition is tougher this
week .they'll probably maintain their
undefeated record.
