# When the Lights Go on Again
## 
### 
YESTERDAY, Nov. 1, the dimout was officially lifted from the
Pacific Coast area. Last night the bright street lights and
gaudy neon signs were once more burning brilliantly for the
first time in over a year.
The cheery night-time illumination, which had become to
seem a thing of the past, gives us new spirit and added hope. It
is physical proof that we are a step nearer victory, that the Jap
anese sub menace has been driven back to its own waters, that
we are about ready to take the offensive.
We hope that the lifting of this war-time restriction will not
mean a let down in effort, and that the time is not far distant
"When the Lights Go on Again All Over the World."
