# Come and Read
## 
### 
REALIZING that many of the members of the ASTP now on
campus have recently come from other colleges, the Stan
ford Daily invites all the soldiers to use its files.
The Daily Shack is open every afternoon and night from
Sunday to Thursday and soldiers are welcome to come and read
their college papers during their free time.
Current college newspapers on the Pacific Coast are kept in
complete file and publications of colleges in other parts of the
country are received daily. The current files include the Daily
Bruin, Oregon Emerald, Daily Californian, Daily Trojan, Univer
sity of Washington Daily, St. Mary's Collegian, and Washington
State Evergreen.
Papers from William and Mary College and the Daily Kansan,
Utah Chronicle, Purdue Exponent, and Duke Chronicle are among
the publications of other colleges in the files.â€”Esther Belew
