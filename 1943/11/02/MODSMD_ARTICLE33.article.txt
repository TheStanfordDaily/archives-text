### 
A FURTHER proof of the fact that Stanford "gets around" ap
peared recently in a pictorial review of Kalamazoo College
campus.
The article, which described the changes in college activities
since the advent of the Army Specialized Training Units stationed
there, contained a picture of a Kalamazoo freshman girl holding
one of the familiar slate-grey binders with Stanford spelled in
.large white letters down the right-hand side.
