## THE 						CARDINAL WAVES AGAIN 
### BILL ROSE 
Something good is going on around here. I don't know what
you'd call it—a rebirth of school spirit or maybe a "back to the
farm" movement. Anyway, it's pretty gratifying to those of us
who have been around for quite awhile—those of us who were
here before that mess of Dec. 7.
Two events of the past couple of days bring this regeneration
particularly to our attention. One is the Sunday night serenade
of the women's living group by a surprisingly large number of
male students; the other is the overwhelming response to the
sale of rooters' tickets for the Cal-UCLA game.
No one sponsored the serenade. There was no great publicity
drive preceding yesterday's ticket sale. They were spontaneous
demonstrations of the students' feelings. They showed not only
a willingness, but an active enthusiasm on the students' part to
keep alive the (apologies to F. Albert) Spirit of Stanford.
When the rah-haw days of football season, Big Game week,
organized rushing, and big name bands disappeared from the
campus, many of us thought the real Stanford, the Stanford we
knew, was dead—for the duration anyway.
Instead, it appears that the real Stanford, the Stanford that was
here long before any of us and that will be here long after we're
gone, received a shot in the arm with our entrance into war.
Obviously, the surface was changed; but the inside—the soft
part—has become firmer.
We know now that war chan change the looks of Stanford, but
it can't harm the heart of Stanford.
