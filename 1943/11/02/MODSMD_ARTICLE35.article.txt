# Saturday Night Impressions Of City Inspire Philosophizing
## 
### A Soldier on Pass 
There are a lot of service men here tonight in all frames of mind. San
Francisco seems a Mecca of all war orphans near and far, hardly a service
or an Allied nation is not amply represented in this adult playground.
From a hotel lobby I can see out on the street, and am watching the
better cross section of an evening's entertainment going by. True, it's

Saturday night, so that civilians
in a minority, but they too are
abundantly present. What a far cry
is this 24-hour city to the dawn-to
dark, walled towns common but 500
years ago; what little resemblance I
there is between this modern spe- j
cialized and global war from those J
personal and physical wars of not so ]
very long ago.
Forms of Entertainment
As times, habits, conditions, and
modes of living change, so change the
forms of entertainment. But as all
living processes are basically sub
stantial, so the fulfillment of man's
idle hours are similar.
Burlesques are filled with smirk
ing, staring men, in and out of uni
form; bar after bar all over the hilly,
sprawling city is crowded with men
and women in all degrees of so
called happiness or forgetfulness.
Theaters showing Westerns, love
stories, or war pictures vie with each
other for drawing out part of the
wages paid but once a month; retail
stores open until all hours have
cheap, unnecessary but glittering
junk for sale at fantastic prices.
Street corners are crowded for many
blocks in all directions with men in
uniform vainly striving for amuse
ment that will satisfy.
Few Find Satisfaction
Some find their satisfaction, but
these are few. Some men find happi
ness temporarily in an opera, a play,
or watching the crowds go by; others
fill their stomachs or take it liquid.
Some are sane, go to nice places—
churches, USO's, or parties. The
large majority try to dilute their
minds or completely drown them. In |
short, everyone is spending money
desirous of pleasure; few get it.
There is an empty spot in the vast
numbers, that can only be filled by
going home to stay, to laugh, to
dance with someone you know, to I
eat in pleasant, homey surroundings, |
and most of all, to be loved.

abundantly present. What a far cry
is this 24-hour city to the dawn-to
dark, walled towns common but 500
years ago; what little resemblance I
there is between this modern spe- j
cialized and global war from those J
personal and physical wars of not so ]
very long ago.
Forms of Entertainment
As times, habits, conditions, and
modes of living change, so change the
forms of entertainment. But as all
living processes are basically sub
stantial, so the fulfillment of man's
idle hours are similar.
Burlesques are filled with smirk
ing, staring men, in and out of uni
form; bar after bar all over the hilly,
sprawling city is crowded with men
and women in all degrees of so
called happiness or forgetfulness.
Theaters showing Westerns, love
stories, or war pictures vie with each
other for drawing out part of the
wages paid but once a month; retail
stores open until all hours have
cheap, unnecessary but glittering
junk for sale at fantastic prices.
Street corners are crowded for many
blocks in all directions with men in
uniform vainly striving for amuse
ment that will satisfy.
Few Find Satisfaction
Some find their satisfaction, but
these are few. Some men find happi
ness temporarily in an opera, a play,
or watching the crowds go by; others
fill their stomachs or take it liquid.
Some are sane, go to nice places—
churches, USO's, or parties. The
large majority try to dilute their
minds or completely drown them. In |
short, everyone is spending money
desirous of pleasure; few get it.
There is an empty spot in the vast
numbers, that can only be filled by
going home to stay, to laugh, to
dance with someone you know, to I
eat in pleasant, homey surroundings, |
and most of all, to be loved.
There are a lot of service men here tonight in all frames of mind. San
Francisco seems a Mecca of all war orphans near and far, hardly a service
or an Allied nation is not amply represented in this adult playground.
From a hotel lobby I can see out on the street, and am watching the
better cross section of an evening's entertainment going by. True, it's

Saturday night, so that civilians
in a minority, but they too are
abundantly present. What a far cry
