## Menlo Shows Horror-Opera 
### 
PHANTOM Or THE OPERA—Now
playing at the Menlo and Mayfield
Theaters.
Universale "Phantom of the Op
era," in technicolor, is a remake of
the famous 1922 picture of the same
name which featured Lon Chaney as
the diabolical phantom. The present
version sacrifices some of the original
horror in favor of music but is still
a creditable picture.
Claude Rains, without makeup, is
seen as the musician who spills acid
on his face and turns into the men
acing phantom. Nelson Eddy, when
not singing, helps trap the phantom;
and Susanna Foster is the near
victim of the prowling Mr. Rains.
Much of the activity takes place in
the dark, damp sewers under the
opera house as everyone chases
around in pursuit of the elusive
phantom.
The best scene of the picture is
that in which the phantom hack
saws the heavy chandelier and it falls
kerplunk into the audience attending
theopera. Mr. Rains as the phantom
isn't awfully scarey but there're some
grand operatic airs sung by Mr.
Eddy and Miss Foster. '"Phantom of
the Opera" is one of the few bright
stars in the present lusterless movie
heaven.
The second feature has rubber
legs Leon Errol and curvesome
Frances Langford in something about
a "Cowboy in Manhattan." It's' a
comedy-musical, that's O.K. for a
"B" picture.—Bower
