## 
### 
The Army Specialized Training
Program and the Navy College V-12
program will hold the second nation
wide test on Nov. 9. The test will be
given at any preparatory school,
high school, or college in the United
States for those wishing to take it.
Students interested and eligible
must notify their principal or college
official and fill out an admission
identification blank. Karl Cowdery,
associate registrar, is in charge of
registration for the test at Stanford.

in April, and who are still eligible,
must take it Nov. 9, if they wish to
be reconsidered.

On the day of the test, students
must indicate their preference for
either the Army or the Navy pro
gram, but taking the test does not
mean enlistment in either branch,
nor does it obligate the student to
enter either program in which he is
accepted. This does not mean, how
ever, that a preference for Navy may
be considered by Army, or vice
versa. Anyone wishing to take the
test must therefore consider the re
quirements for both programs in his
preference for either.

vision 20/200, correctible with glasses
to 20/40; weight in proportion to
height, hearing 15/15, and general
good health.
Navy Requirements
The Navy physical requirements
are: minimum height 5 feet, 51/2
inches, maximum of 6 feet, 4 inches;
minimum vision 18/20, correctible to
20/20; weight proportional to height,
normal color perception, good teeth,
and general good health.
It is imperative to fill out the ap
plication blank at the back of the
information book, sign it, and have
Dr. Cowdery countersign it, by Mon
day night, Nov. 8. The test will be
given at 8:45 on Tuesday morning,
Nov. 9.
The Army Specialized Training
Program and the Navy College V-12
program will hold the second nation
wide test on Nov. 9. The test will be
given at any preparatory school,
high school, or college in the United
States for those wishing to take it.
Students interested and eligible
must notify their principal or college
official and fill out an admission
identification blank. Karl Cowdery,
associate registrar, is in charge of
registration for the test at Stanford.
Students who did not pass the test
in April, and who are still eligible,
must take it Nov. 9, if they wish to
be reconsidered.
Indicate Preferences
On the day of the test, students
must indicate their preference for
either the Army or the Navy pro
gram, but taking the test does not
mean enlistment in either branch,
nor does it obligate the student to
enter either program in which he is
accepted. This does not mean, how
ever, that a preference for Navy may
be considered by Army, or vice
versa. Anyone wishing to take the
test must therefore consider the re
quirements for both programs in his
preference for either.
Physical requirements for the
Army program are: minimum height
5 feet, maximum 6V2 feet; minimum
vision 20/200, correctible with glasses
to 20/40; weight in proportion to
height, hearing 15/15, and general
good health.
Navy Requirements
The Navy physical requirements
are: minimum height 5 feet, 51/2
inches, maximum of 6 feet, 4 inches;
minimum vision 18/20, correctible to
20/20; weight proportional to height,
normal color perception, good teeth,
and general good health.
It is imperative to fill out the ap
plication blank at the back of the
information book, sign it, and have
Dr. Cowdery countersign it, by Mon
day night, Nov. 8. The test will be
given at 8:45 on Tuesday morning,
