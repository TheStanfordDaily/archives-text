## 
### BARBARA STEVENS 
Shaw is the only playwright I, as ;
j a director, take seriously. So did F. [
C. Strickland, of the Drama depart- 1
j ment, sum up his opinion of the
! famed Irish eccentric, author of "A
i Village Wooing," to be presented by
j the Stanford players in a program !
jof three one-acts on Nov. 10, 11,
I 12, 13 and 15.
"Shaw writes script as it ought I
i to be played," Strickland says. If
i the copy is lead honestly it will be j
j interpreted as it was originally in- j
: tended. For every Shaw script is pub-
J lished to be comma, period, semi- |
' colon, and pause perfect. Strickland
j learned to rely upon these scripts
| from Claude Rains who was once a
j favorite Shaw actor in London.
"A Village Wooing" is not a one
| act play but a three-act play con
j densed. It has the meat of a three-
I act; the girl-meets-man first act,
j girl-loses-man second act, and cli—
\ max third act, rolled into one act
with the non-essentials eliminated, i
"And it's good comedy on how to j
get a man to propose."
