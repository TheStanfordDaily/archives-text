# Committee Boosts Income Taxes
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 1. â€” The
House Ways and Means Committee
today voted an indirect increase of
$140,000,000 in individual income
taxes by eliminating deductions for
some excises, and approved a hike
from three to four cents in out-of
town postage rates and confirmed
previous hikes in local rates from
two to three cents.
Heretofore deductions for excise
taxes on gasoline, amusements, tele
phone and telegraph tolls, jewelry,
and certain other federal-taxed items
have been permitted in computing
income obligations.
The action represented the second
indirect boost in individual levies, as
integration of the victory tax with
the regular liability will result in a
$12,000,000,000 hike.
