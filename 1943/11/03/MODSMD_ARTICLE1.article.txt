## 
### Don Langendorf 
The ticket sale f<Â»r the California game with UCLA resumes today al 1
p.m. in the ASSU office above the Union. After a one-day respite. Card
inals will go back to work to the task of selling the remaining 500 tickets
which are expected to arrive by mail in time to he sold this afternoon. If
Monday's sale is any indication at all. the tickets should be sold by 2 p.m.

Cardinals request that students act
in an orderly manner while buying
their tickets. There will be two lines
for the two windows used. One line
will be for those that have signed the
preference, list, the other line for
those who haven't a ticket or who
haven't signed up for one. All those
that signed up are warned to be at
the ASSU office at 1 p.m. in order to
claim their tickets. Seats will be
held reserved for them only for a
limited amount of time. On this list
are over 200 students.
ASSU Card Needed
Students are again reminded that
they must have their student body
card in order to buy a ticket. Only
one ticket will be sold to each per
son, although a student may pur
chase another student's ticket if he
has his student body card plus a note
authorizing him to buy that ticket.
If these 500 seats are sold today as
expected, it is doubtful that more
tickets can be obtained, although
student officials will attempt to get
more.
Soldiers are also encouraged to
buy tickets with their student body
cards on an equal basis with civilian
students, for they are as much a part
of the Stanford family as any ci
vilian.
These new tickets will not all be in
the main section with the 800 seats
sold Monday. A few will be on the
same side of the field, but separated
by a few seats. The Stanford section
will be directly across from Cal's.
The price of tickets remains the
same as it was Monday, $1.20 apiece.
Ric Supple, newly elected yell
leader, will direct the students in
their yells and songs. He will be as
sisted by two other men yet to be
named.
Cardinals plan to have a big yell
session the evening before the game.
Norm Schieber has been placed in
charge of arrangements. During this
session, scheduled to last only about
a half-hour, Rick Supple will direct
the students in the different Stan
ford yells as well a.s the yells of
California and of U.C.L.A.
Directions will also be given that
evening for seating arrangements,
proper conduct, time schedule, pom
poms. and rooters' caps. More an
nouncements concerning this yell
session on November 12 will be an
nounced in The Daily as soon as
developments are announced.
In charge of ticket sales for the
game is Cally Curtis.
