# Is 50 Bucks Worth It?

### Pfc. Barry McMenamy, Co. D 
Two thousand soldiers overran
Encina Hall Monday night, all trying
to receive their hard earned wages
at one time. Amid shouts, cheers,
and inharmonious singing, the dif
ferent company commanders strove
valiantly to get names straight and
count out the proper amount of
"pecunia."
Enlisted permanent personnel were
in their element—swaggering around
with pistols, belts, and holsters, and
praying that some unfortunate would
tiy to make off with the pay roll.
As your timid reporter stepped up
to receive his share of the "swag,"
one of the watch-dogs growled out,
"Gimme your dog tag." I hastily
obliged. The watch dog then put his
hand on the butt of his pistol and
growled again, "Okay—what's your
serial number?"
By this time my knees were begin
ning to knock in a very disconcerting
manner, and I was beginning to won
der if it were worth $50 for a fellow
to risk his life. One number out of
line, and I'd have been chewing a
cold steel pistol barrel.
Maybe the Stanford co-eds could
suggest an appropriate attire for a
soldier about to receive his pay.
