## Rally Planned For Cal Game 
### 
A "Pe-Orientation Rally" is being
planned by Cardinals for Nov. 12 to
help Stanford students become more
familiar with their school songs,
yells, and hymn. A portion of the
rally will also be devoted to learning
the University of California's and
UCLA's songs and yells; in order
that students will be prepared to join
in with the singing and yelling at the
lootball game between the two
schools on the next day.
The plan for the rally which will
be held on the street in front of the
Cellar was proposed by Ric Supple,
newly elected cheer leader. He ex
pressed the hope that through the
rally, "students will become better
acquainted with our own songs as
well as those of Cal and UCLA."
It is hoped that the recently
formed Stanford band, under the di
rection of Ed Carpenter, will be on
hand to provide music for the rooters.
Norm Schieber, who will be in
charge of the affair, announced that
Cardinals has asked all students
planning on going lo the game to
leave early as trains and buses will
be very congested if all spectators
leave at one time.
Cardinals also discussed plans for
a dance which will be held on Nov.
24 if the civilian and soldier students
are given a holiday for Thanksgiving.
Further information about the dance
will appear in the Daily if these plans
formulate.
A bond rally is also being planned
by the committee for Dec. 10. at
which war bonds and stamps will be
auctioned and students will be able
to give off a little steam by yelling in
the traditional Stanford rally fashion.
