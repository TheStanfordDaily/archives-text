# Comedy Proves Eddy's Decline
## 
### 
M.G.M.'s lavish musical comedy,
"The Chocolate Soldier," intended
primarily to introduce to the movie
going public their operatic find, Rise
Stevens, probably does nothing more
than confirm the fact that Nelson
Eddy is fast becoming a candidate
for the middle-aged gentleman roles,
instead of the usual dashing Lothario.
Eddy amply fills the uniform, but
not the role of the singer who mas
querades as a Russian in order to test
his wife's fidelity. So disguised he
woos and apparently wins the faith
less wife. We were more than
pleased to find that La Stevens rec
ognizes her husband from the very
first, as even we weren't fooled by
the beard and accompanying para
phernalia. As you have probably
guessed, everything turns out with a
thick sugar coating, and the happy
couple return from their digressions
to lead a sane and sober life of sing
ing for their supper.
Rise Stevens' voice leaves little to
be desired, but we hardly think her
suited to flitting across such unin
teresting celluloid. Nelson Eddy
comes through in true baritone style,
but is a complete flop in scenes
where a little acting is required. The
supporting cast does an excellent job
in a place where support was defi
nitely in demand.
The redeeming feature of the film
is the familiar music of Oscar Strauss,
presented in all its mirth, melody,
and fascination. Unhappily, the
movie docs not follow the original
script, a point which Hollywood pro
ducers should take into considera
tion. Maybe the old boys did know
something about audience appeal.
If music is your dish, see "The
Chocolate Soldier," but if not, you'd
better hope for a good newsreel.—
