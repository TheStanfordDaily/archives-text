# EXCOM
## New Plans for 1944 Election 
### 
Although deciding to retain the
women's nominating committee, Ex
com at its meeting last night recom
mended that some changes in pro
cedure be made before the next
election. These will be acted upon
by Excom next year.
According to a report by Catherine
Connaghan, the work of the com
mittee in the last election was fa
vorably received except that its
purpose should have been made bet
ter known. The A.S.S.U. constitu
tion provides that the committee is
to interview and nominate women
for positions on Excom, Council and
Conference in order to insure that
there will always be competent can
didates.
It was also suggested that the
committee make nominations for
class officers, since there is often a
dearth of candidates for these posi
tions. The possibility of having two
days for nominations in order to
stimulate interest was also discussed.
Dates granted by the committee
included: Roble, Nov. 6; Cardinals
Rally, Nov. 12; Lincoln Hall, Nov.
13; Sunday Movie, Nov. 14; A.S.T.U.
Dance, Nov. 20; Klahoya, Nov. 27;
Bond Rally, Dec. 10; Gamma Phi
Beta. Dec. 18. Lincoln Hall's dance
for Dec. 10 was canceled.
