### JIM WEINBERG 
In the fourth event on Stanford's
Autumn Quarter Tuesday Series.
Miss Mary M. Cannon gave an in
formative lecture on "South Ameri
cans in War Time" in the Memorial
Auditorium last night.
Miss Cannon is chief of the Inter-
American Division of the Women's
Bureau of the Department of Labor,
and in this capacity she has traveled
to South America twice since the
outbreak of the war. Most of hen
lecture last night was devoted to a
discussion of the four countries
she visited on her last trip,
j These were Brazil. Paraguay, Peru,
and Ecuador. Miss Cannon discussed
each of these countries in turn, tell
ing of the effects of the war on the
nation as a whole, and emphasizing
its effect upon the women in par
ticular.
Lack of Gasoline
j In Brazil, Miss Cannon said, one
of the most evident effects of the
j war which the traveler notices when
he arrives is the lack of gasoline.
Fuel oil, which Brazil imported from
other countries before the war, is
j almost nonexistent. Private auto
; mobiles have been laid up. and fac
i torics have been converted from fuel
j oil to coke, wood, and other fuels.
The country of Brazil has been
; tremendously industrialized as a re
; suit of the war. Consumer goods in
dustries especially have expanded
greatly, while many war industries
have been added.
This industrialization has not
brought many benefits to the work
ing classes, however, largely bee; use
of the increase in the cost of living.
Wages in Brazil have gone up 30 per
cent, whereas the c'ost of staple
foods, for example, has risen as much
as 300 per cent.
Women Replace Men
The women of Brazil are becom
ing more and more important in in
| dustry, and have replaced men in
many jobs, just as they have in the
United States. Women are also tak
ing the lead in civilian defense work.
The wife of the Brazilian president
J has founded a women's legion which
1 is doing much war work.
Paraguay, although it is much far
ther from the war than is Brazil,
has still felt the war's effect. The
1 greatest improvement in the status of
Paraguayan women came as a result
I of the great part they played during
the Chaoc war with Bolivia in the
early 1930'5.
Development in Peru
In Peru, as in Brazil, there has
I been much development as a result
of the war. Roads, hotels, hospitals,
j and industries are being built up.
| An interesting women's organization
has been founded to unite women
against Nazi-Fascism, and it has had
wide appeal.
"The people of Peru," Miss Can
non said, "are undoubtedly heart and
soul with the United Nations."
j Ecuador Aids War
Ecuador is also contributing much
to the United Nations' war effort.
Last year Ecuador was second only
to Brazil in rubber production in
South America.
In conclusion, Miss Cannon said
that we must learn to understand
the problems of the South Ameri
can people, and they must learn to
understand ours, if we are to have
I successful co-operation in the post-
I war wodld.

In the fourth event on Stanford's
Autumn Quarter Tuesday Series.
Miss Mary M. Cannon gave an in
formative lecture on "South Ameri
cans in War Time" in the Memorial
Auditorium last night.
Miss Cannon is chief of the Inter-
American Division of the Women's
Bureau of the Department of Labor,
and in this capacity she has traveled
to South America twice since the
outbreak of the war. Most of hen
lecture last night was devoted to a
discussion of the four countries
she visited on her last trip,
j These were Brazil. Paraguay, Peru,
and Ecuador. Miss Cannon discussed
each of these countries in turn, tell
ing of the effects of the war on the
nation as a whole, and emphasizing
its effect upon the women in par
ticular.
Lack of Gasoline
j In Brazil, Miss Cannon said, one
of the most evident effects of the
j war which the traveler notices when
he arrives is the lack of gasoline.
Fuel oil, which Brazil imported from
other countries before the war, is
j almost nonexistent. Private auto
; mobiles have been laid up. and fac
i torics have been converted from fuel
j oil to coke, wood, and other fuels.
The country of Brazil has been
; tremendously industrialized as a re
; suit of the war. Consumer goods in
dustries especially have expanded
greatly, while many war industries
have been added.
This industrialization has not
brought many benefits to the work
ing classes, however, largely bee; use
of the increase in the cost of living.
Wages in Brazil have gone up 30 per
cent, whereas the c'ost of staple
foods, for example, has risen as much
as 300 per cent.
Women Replace Men
The women of Brazil are becom
ing more and more important in in
| dustry, and have replaced men in
many jobs, just as they have in the
United States. Women are also tak
ing the lead in civilian defense work.
The wife of the Brazilian president
J has founded a women's legion which
1 is doing much war work.
Paraguay, although it is much far
ther from the war than is Brazil,
has still felt the war's effect. The
1 greatest improvement in the status of
Paraguayan women came as a result
I of the great part they played during
the Chaoc war with Bolivia in the
early 1930'5.
Development in Peru
In Peru, as in Brazil, there has
I been much development as a result
of the war. Roads, hotels, hospitals,
j and industries are being built up.
| An interesting women's organization
has been founded to unite women
against Nazi-Fascism, and it has had
wide appeal.
"The people of Peru," Miss Can
non said, "are undoubtedly heart and
soul with the United Nations."
j Ecuador Aids War
Ecuador is also contributing much
to the United Nations' war effort.
Last year Ecuador was second only
to Brazil in rubber production in
South America.
In conclusion, Miss Cannon said
that we must learn to understand
the problems of the South Ameri
can people, and they must learn to
understand ours, if we are to have
I successful co-operation in the post-
I war wodld.
