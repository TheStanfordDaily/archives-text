# Bloody Battle Gives Victory to Russians

### 
LONDON. Nov. 3. â€” The fourth
Ukraine army yesterday captured the
historic city of Kakhovka, where
thousands of Germans drowned in
the swirling Dnieper or died under
murderous Russian fire as they at
tempted to flee to the west bank of
the river.
Another German force, encircled
Monday and Tuesday in the south of
the Travida steppes was driven back
to the shores of the Sivash lagoon
and "completely annihilated," the
communique announced. A large
number of prisoners was taken.
The Soviet command gave no new
details of the fighting within the
Parenkop Isthmus but they disclosed
that Soviet columns had raced 35
miles west of the isthmus to take the
town of Skadovsk on the Black Sea
coast in a direct threat to flank the
important German-held cities of
Kherson and Nikolaev.
