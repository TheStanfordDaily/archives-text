## 
### 
"Girls are needed badly to help fill our quota of 1.000 surgical dressings
a day for the Red Cross," stated Twink Davies, Red Cross Chairman for the
War Board, yesterday. She added that all girls who have not yet decided
how they want to fill their required two hours of war work a week are more
than welcome to sign up at their living groups for work on surgical

dressings.
The group meets every Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday from 10 to
12 a.m. and from 1 to 4 p.m. on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house, and 20 seats are available to
workers each hour of each day. Ev
ery living group is allotted certain
hours on certain days that it must fill
in work for this department alone.
Any girl who finds that she cannot
fit in her hours with those of her
living group is urged to leave a note
to that eflect for Miss Davies at the
War Board office in the Old Union."
"Hours to Suit You"
"There are always living groups
that are unable to fill their specified
hours," said Miss Davies, "and we

can fit girls into the hours allotted to
some living group other than their
own." Any girl who is unable to at
tend on her day can send someone in
her place; the substitute may sign
her own name on the roll, and it
does not matter who is absent as long
as there are girls to fill all the avail
able seats.
Mills College has a system where
by each girl is required to put in a
certain amount of hours on surgical
dressing work alone, and must pre
sent an exemption slip if she is un
able to attend.

"Such a system is not and will not
jbe the case here. Every girl is re
quired to do two hours of war work
I a week, and whether she fills her
I hours in the surgical dressing room
jor not is purely optional. "But,"
reiterated Miss Davies, "bandage
rolling is vital work and we want
I just as many girls as are able to
! come. The closest we have yet come
' to reaching our quota is 947 bandages
that were rolled last week on
| Wednesday. It is very important that
i all the girls who have signed up to
work on surgical dressings start to
| come their regular hours as soon as
: possible. We really need every girl
we can get, so if you've signed up,
come; and if you haven't signed up,
I do so right away."

I do so right away."
"Girls are needed badly to help fill our quota of 1.000 surgical dressings
a day for the Red Cross," stated Twink Davies, Red Cross Chairman for the
War Board, yesterday. She added that all girls who have not yet decided
how they want to fill their required two hours of war work a week are more
than welcome to sign up at their living groups for work on surgical

dressings.
The group meets every Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday from 10 to
12 a.m. and from 1 to 4 p.m. on the
third floor of the Women's Club
house, and 20 seats are available to
workers each hour of each day. Ev
ery living group is allotted certain
hours on certain days that it must fill
in work for this department alone.
Any girl who finds that she cannot
fit in her hours with those of her
living group is urged to leave a note
to that eflect for Miss Davies at the
War Board office in the Old Union."
"Hours to Suit You"
"There are always living groups
that are unable to fill their specified
hours," said Miss Davies, "and we

can fit girls into the hours allotted to
some living group other than their
own." Any girl who is unable to at
tend on her day can send someone in
her place; the substitute may sign
her own name on the roll, and it
does not matter who is absent as long
as there are girls to fill all the avail
able seats.
Mills College has a system where
by each girl is required to put in a
certain amount of hours on surgical
dressing work alone, and must pre
sent an exemption slip if she is un
able to attend.
Not for Us
"Such a system is not and will not
jbe the case here. Every girl is re
quired to do two hours of war work
I a week, and whether she fills her
I hours in the surgical dressing room
jor not is purely optional. "But,"
reiterated Miss Davies, "bandage
rolling is vital work and we want
I just as many girls as are able to
! come. The closest we have yet come
' to reaching our quota is 947 bandages
that were rolled last week on
| Wednesday. It is very important that
