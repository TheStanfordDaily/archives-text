# Sports The Stanford Daily

Led by Rick Supple, Farm students
will trek over to Berkeley to the
State school on Nov. 13 to root for
the many athletes who formerly went
to Stanford but now attend Califor
nia and UCLA in the uniform of the
Navy and of the Marines. These
athletes will be spurred on in their
game by their former schoolmates,
by men and women they used to talk
to on the Quad, by the students who
formerly cheered for them in our
own stadium.
It's been a long time since they
have received the cheers of a Stan
ford rooting section. Let's show
them that there is still that same
Stanford Spirit. Five hundred more
tickets go on sale tomorrow after
noon. Five hundred tickets will be
sold by tomorrow evening. If more
tickets are needed, we will try to get

them. We will show these former
students that we haven't forgotten
them by cheering them on with as
many students as Cal will seat in
their stadium.
These athletes who play for the
Bears and the Bruins today—An
drews, Brown, Machten, Madigan,
Rohrer, Frisbee, and the others —
would in peacetime have been the
nucleus of this year's Model U T." The
boys at Westwood have been oper
ating under this system as taught to
them by Marchy Schwartz.
Bears Use Old System
Those at Cal have not been quite
as fortunate, as the Bears have been
using their century-old system of
driving through the line. The Bears
won the opening engagement 13 to
0, but since then they have lost for
mer Stanfordites Boensch, Cox, and
Joslyn. The engagement on the 13th
should be more interesting than the
first and very hard fought.
In peacetime at Stanford, soccer
wouldn't cause any interest whatso
ever, but we are at war and times
have changed. With the intercol
legiate athletics cancelled for the
duration, the soccer enthusiasts re
fused to give up hope, and, as a con
sequence, will be rewarded this Fri
day with a game between Harry Ma
loney's soccer students and the soc
cer players of the ASTU. From what
we've heard, quite a few of these
players competed on crack Euro
pean outfits. As the only sport left
on the Farm, outside of murals, in
terest should run high with a good
crowd anticipated.

Schwartz, Stanford football coach,

athletes now stationed at Cal and
UCLA.
