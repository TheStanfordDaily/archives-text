### Jim Weinberg 
Intramural touch football swung
into its second round yesterday aft
ernoon with most of the important
games going according to form. In
the feature game of the day, un
beaten Gerona A.C. handed Tyler
Hall its first defeat by a 19-12 score.
Gerona piled up a 13-0 lead in the
first half, and was never headed.
Both of Tyler's two touchdowns came
in the last few minutes of play.
Dinah's gave Fillmore a 30-0
whitewashing in a game that was
featured by long passes from Caruso
to Hebert and good downfield block
ing by the Dinah's squad. Also a
standout for Dinah's was Loren La-
Prade, both at blocking and catching
passes. It was the second win for
Dinah's as against no defeats.
In the feature game in League B,
Buchanan Hall nosed out Co. D of
the Army by 18-12. At the end of the
regulation period the score was tied
up at 12-all, and an overtime period
was necessary to decide the issue.
Jim Travis made all of Buchanan's
touchdowns.
Thompson Co-op piled up 50

! points in snowing under the Mc-
Kinley B team, 50-0. McKinley's A
i team did better, however, defeating
the Theta Hashers, 18-6.
Co. E Team 1 ran all over Garfield
Hall for a 24-6 victory. Adams Hall
was outclassed by the Firehouse
squad by an identical score.
Monroe Hall broke even in two
1 games, losing in the A league and
| winning in League B. Fightin' 0.M.,
with plenty of reserve strength, beat
the Monroe A team 20-0, in a game
that was closer than the score would
indicate. The Monroe B team won
over Lincoln, 12-6.
Veritas A.C. and The Stoates have
postponed their game until Saturday.
The highly touted Navy team, which
used the T-formation with great
success against the Theta Hashers
last week, was also idle. Their game
with Co. D, team 2, scheduled for
yesterday, may be played later.
From the results to date, it looks
i as if the teams to beat in League A
I are Dinah's, Gerona, the Firehouse,
! and Navy. The standouts in League
| B are Buchanan Hall and the Thomp
son Co-op House.

From the results to date, it looks
i as if the teams to beat in League A
I are Dinah's, Gerona, the Firehouse,
! and Navy. The standouts in League
| B are Buchanan Hall and the Thomp
son Co-op House.
Intramural touch football swung
into its second round yesterday aft
ernoon with most of the important
games going according to form. In
the feature game of the day, un
beaten Gerona A.C. handed Tyler
Hall its first defeat by a 19-12 score.
Gerona piled up a 13-0 lead in the
first half, and was never headed.
Both of Tyler's two touchdowns came
in the last few minutes of play.
Dinah's gave Fillmore a 30-0
whitewashing in a game that was
featured by long passes from Caruso
to Hebert and good downfield block
ing by the Dinah's squad. Also a
standout for Dinah's was Loren La-
Prade, both at blocking and catching
passes. It was the second win for
Dinah's as against no defeats.
In the feature game in League B,
Buchanan Hall nosed out Co. D of
the Army by 18-12. At the end of the
regulation period the score was tied
up at 12-all, and an overtime period
was necessary to decide the issue.
Jim Travis made all of Buchanan's
touchdowns.
Thompson Co-op piled up 50

! points in snowing under the Mc-
Kinley B team, 50-0. McKinley's A
i team did better, however, defeating
the Theta Hashers, 18-6.
Co. E Team 1 ran all over Garfield
Hall for a 24-6 victory. Adams Hall
was outclassed by the Firehouse
squad by an identical score.
Monroe Hall broke even in two
1 games, losing in the A league and
| winning in League B. Fightin' 0.M.,
with plenty of reserve strength, beat
the Monroe A team 20-0, in a game
that was closer than the score would
indicate. The Monroe B team won
over Lincoln, 12-6.
Veritas A.C. and The Stoates have
postponed their game until Saturday.
The highly touted Navy team, which
used the T-formation with great
success against the Theta Hashers
last week, was also idle. Their game
with Co. D, team 2, scheduled for
yesterday, may be played later.
