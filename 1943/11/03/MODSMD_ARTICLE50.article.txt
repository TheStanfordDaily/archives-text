## 
### Joe Hawkins 
The Stanford Varsity soccer and
the Army 9-L's soccer team will
tangle in what promises to be a real
battle this Friday afternoon at 4:30
p.m. on the Intramural Field. Ac
cording to Harry Maloney, director
of minor sports, this is sure to be a
"game worth watching," since both
teams have excellent individual
players, and have had considerable
experience.
Although this year's varsity team
as a whole has not participated in
any inter-collegiate games as in the
past, many of the players have re
turned from last year's squad. Some
of the "old timers" who came back
to form a nucleus for the team in
clude Robert Demott, George KofTer,
Enrique Sidwell, and Richard Wil
bur.
New players who show great
promise, according to Harry Ma
loney, are: Bob Neibel, Fernando
Salinas, and Washington Canas.
Refereeing will be done by Harry
Maloney, assisted by Louis Chan,
former soccer man, and now assistant
instructor in languages.
