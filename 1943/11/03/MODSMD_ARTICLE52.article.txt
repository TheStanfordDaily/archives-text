THE GUIDING LIGHT
There is is an old adage which tells us that behind the career
of every great man stands a woman. The woman is often one of
those guiet, unprepossessing, warm-hearted people with a gleam
of aspiration in her eye and the will to achieve in her mind.
Mary Curry Tresidder, Stanford's first lady, is such a person.
Even without Dr. Tresidder's freguent mention of her in his ad
dresses, we could surmise the importance of this attractive little
woman's influence on her husband s life- —the kind of influence
we associate with Madame Chiang rather than Lady Macbeth.
Mrs. Tresidder is a member of one of California's prominent
families. She has two brothers —one, who as a child was very
meek, was called "Lamb;" the other, who as a child was very
small, was called ' Shrimp. _ m
Now Lamb had a friend named Jim Rice. Jim was such an
obstreperous lad that he was nicknamed "Wild." Lamb and Wild
were great pals. They often went hiking together around Lamb's
folks' place in Yosemite.
One Summer they were high up on a cliff in Yosemite when
they met a bear. There was no place to run to, so they faced
the bear bravely.
"What's your name?" the bear asked.
"Curry," Lamb answered. "What's yours?"
"Bear," the bear said. "I am going to have you and your
friend for my dinner tonight."
"Please do not eat us," Lamb pleaded.
"I must," the bear replied. "My brother Golden, who lives
in Berkeley, will be mad at me if I don't. You see, he does not
like your family."
"But why?" little Lamb asked. Tears now filled his eyes and
streamed down his cheeks.
"Because one day your sister is going to live with a tribe of
Indians in Palo Alto. She will become their gueen and will make
them very happy. Golden does not like to see those Indians
happy."
"Oh," Lamb said resignedly. And he and Wild rode off on
the bear's back like good soldiers, proud of the sacrifice they
v/ere about to make. That night the bear ate them.
Now, many, many years later the bear's augury has come
true. The Indians have their gueen and they are very happy.
And in memory of that justly famous event in Yosemite, the
Cellar is offering tonight—on the 85 cent dinner—Lamb Curry
and Wild Rice.
