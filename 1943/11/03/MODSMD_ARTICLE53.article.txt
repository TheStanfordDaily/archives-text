To The Editor:
We'd like to have a point clarified. Will someone please tell
us what the soldier's status is here at Stanford?
After having the hallowed traditions of Stanford, the greater
part of which seem to be almost entirely disregarded by the civil
ian students, crammed down our throats, we find that some in
dividuals do not even consider us students of the university. We
are continually being upbraided about items of little, or no, im
portance; all of which can be traced, by devious methods, to in
fractions of the traditions allegedly established by Mrs. Stanford
to be observed by the students.
If we were carrying a mere fifteen credit hours instead of
thirty-four, we might be willing to let the accusations made in
Friday's Daily pass; but we'd like to see one of these poor, un
fortunate stackstanders do his homework on the arm of one of
the desks that are to be found on the Quad.
We, who have been told we hold the destiny of the World
in our hands, would like to know who can call themselves stu
dents of Stanford if we can't.
