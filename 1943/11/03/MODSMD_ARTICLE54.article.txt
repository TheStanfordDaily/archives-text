## Hour Features Request Songs 
### Gloria Brooks 
The program for the Stanford
Musical Hour from 5 to 5:30 p.m. on
Thursday at Memorial Church in
cludes request selections and two
masterworks for the organ. They
will be played by the acting organist,
D. Sterling Wheelwright.
The first selection, '"Come Sweet
Rest" by Bach, is an example of a
short masterpiece that might be
called an immortal melody. Follow
ing it will be the "Fantasy-Chorale
in A Minor" by Franck. Here is an
elaboration of the original theme or
chorale in four choruses. As if test
ing the power of the organ, the
choruses swell into crescendos and
back into softer interludes.
"A Peasant Longs for Home" by
Bull and the '"Country Dance" by
Chenoweth are next. The first i$
written with a Scandinavian touch,
while the second is by an American
composer.
As Oct. 31 was Reformation Day,
the program will conclude with a fan
tasy on the Reformation Hymn, "A
Mighty Fortress." An English ca
thedral organist, Faulkes, has made
a vigorous arrangement of this
'"Battle Hymn" of the Protestant
Reformation. The theme appears in
fragments interspersed by harmonic
deviations, with the pedal organ
triumphantly playing the tune at the
end.
