LONDON — Yugoslav partisans
have crossed the heavily guarded
Rumanian frontier and clashed with
Axis satellite groups, it was reported,
today as Gen. Josit Brozovich re
vealed that Allied planes had car
ried out previously unannounced
bombing raids on Adriatic ports.
A communique from the head
quarters of the partisan leader gave
no details of the penetration of Ru
manian soil.
