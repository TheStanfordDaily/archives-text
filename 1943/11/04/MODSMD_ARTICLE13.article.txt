With world wheat supplies for
1943-44 about equal to the unprece
dented total of 5.9 billion bushels
last year, the crucial wheat problems
now are ones of policy and manage
ment which must make sure that too
much of the grain is not diverted to
non-food uses.
New Publication
This is one of the major conclu
sions presented today in the study
entitled "Wheat Outlook and Poli
cies," by Dr. Joseph S. Davis, director
of the Food Research Institute at
Stanford and professor of economic
research. The publication is the new
est of the "Wheat Studies" issued by
\the institute.
The report points out that "judi
cious restraints on use of wheat for
i'eed, alcohol, and fuel are needed if
ample reserves are to be held for
prospective food relief and other
purposes. The problems ahead call
for vital policy decisions and far
sighted management, national and
international."
Sound management can insure that
all military, lend-lease, relief, and
commercial demands for export ship
ment will be supplied, the report de
clares, but "the difficulties lie in
achieving such management.
Need for Plan
"The urgent need for a United
Nations policy and plan for handling

1 relief in Europe and the Orient has
yet to be met, although progress i.s
being made."
There must be continuous study,
the report emphasizes, "not only by
! national governments in London,
| Washington, Ottawa, and elsewhere,
but also by the International Wheat
I Council and the Interim Commission
; on Food and Agriculture.
"By contrast with 1917-18 and
11918-19," the report continues, "wheat
, has been and is extremely abundant.
Abundance, however, is relative. If
wheat supplies were reserved solely
for seed and food use, there is no
doubt that the aggregate would be
ample to provide for maximum po
tential requirements in 1943-44 and
l leave large carryovers againse the
i possible conjuncture of shorter crops
and larged food needs in 1944-45."

No Food Shortage
In its conclusion, Dr. Davis' study
criticizes "wheat we regard as seri
ously inflated notions as to the size
and duration of the food shortage,"
which "continue to be voiced in some
official and trade quarters.
"The danger of these notions lies
in the prospect that they may pro
mote over-expansion and maldistri
bution of wheat production, and both
delay and make more difficult the
process of post-war readjustment."

Need for Plan
"The urgent need for a United
Nations policy and plan for handling

1 relief in Europe and the Orient has
yet to be met, although progress i.s
being made."
There must be continuous study,
the report emphasizes, "not only by
! national governments in London,
| Washington, Ottawa, and elsewhere,
but also by the International Wheat
I Council and the Interim Commission
; on Food and Agriculture.
"By contrast with 1917-18 and
11918-19," the report continues, "wheat
, has been and is extremely abundant.
Abundance, however, is relative. If
wheat supplies were reserved solely
for seed and food use, there is no
doubt that the aggregate would be
ample to provide for maximum po
tential requirements in 1943-44 and
l leave large carryovers againse the
i possible conjuncture of shorter crops
and larged food needs in 1944-45."

No Food Shortage
In its conclusion, Dr. Davis' study
criticizes "wheat we regard as seri
ously inflated notions as to the size
and duration of the food shortage,"
which "continue to be voiced in some
official and trade quarters.
"The danger of these notions lies
in the prospect that they may pro
mote over-expansion and maldistri
bution of wheat production, and both
delay and make more difficult the
process of post-war readjustment."
With world wheat supplies for
1943-44 about equal to the unprece
dented total of 5.9 billion bushels
last year, the crucial wheat problems
now are ones of policy and manage
ment which must make sure that too
much of the grain is not diverted to
non-food uses.

This is one of the major conclu

entitled "Wheat Outlook and Poli
cies," by Dr. Joseph S. Davis, director
of the Food Research Institute at
Stanford and professor of economic
research. The publication is the new

\the institute.
The report points out that "judi

i'eed, alcohol, and fuel are needed if
ample reserves are to be held for
prospective food relief and other
purposes. The problems ahead call
for vital policy decisions and far
