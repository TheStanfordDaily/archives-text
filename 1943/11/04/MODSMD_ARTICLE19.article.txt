The mural season is in full sway
; now and it looks as though Dinah's is
| the class of the league headed by
j Loren LaPrade. In case you have
| never heard of LaPrade, he was one
j of the outstanding guards on Marchy
J Schwartz's eleven of the last two
j years. From what we have heard,
| La Prade is the outstanding player in
the league. If anyone thinks differ
ently, let us know about their candi
j date for outstanding league player.
We've been reading in the papers
j where Southern California is to rep
resent the Pacific Coast Conference
in the Rose Bowl come Jan. 1, 1!)44.
That sounds okay, except for (he
problem of what to do with the Uni
versity of Washington. After all.
! Washington is also untied and unde
feated. The Huskies have defeated
the March Field Flyers by two
touchdowns. No one else has de
feated March Field. Washington has
as much claim to the Bowl bid as
| Southern California has. Is the Con
j ference showing favoritism? We
! think so. From the looks of things, it
seems to us as if the authorities are
| figuring on * gate receipts and not
thinking of the best team. Our sug
gestion is that Southern California
should face Washington at the Los
; Angeles Coliseum on Christinas with
! the winner meeting an Eastern op
ponent in the Rose Bowl 011 New
I Years as originally scheduled.
Tomorrow is the day for the ex
| perts to pick the winners. Watch this
i space for sure football results the day
| before the games. Our average is up
1 pretty high in the .800's, threatening
.900. The favorites are liable to be
; defeated with Bertelli gone from
Norte Dame, Daley missing from
Michigan, Podesto with 10 others
â€¢'one from College of Pacific. Don't
miss installment No. 4 of the Brain
Trust to appear in tomorrow's paper.
