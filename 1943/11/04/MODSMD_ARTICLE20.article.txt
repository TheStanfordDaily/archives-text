# Soccer Set for Friday
## 
### Joe Hawkins 
The Intramural Field promises to be an exciting spot tomorrow, Friday,
at 4:30 p.m. when the Stanford Varsity soccer and the Army 9-L's soccer
teams will tangle. Both individual skill and considerable group experience
should really make it a "game worth watching," according to Harry Ma
loney, director of minor sports.
The Army 9-L team comes from Co. I foreign language group, stationed

at Pierce Hall, and is reported to
have an excellent squad, having
played in Europe and elsewhere. It
is said that they have never been
defeated.
The Stanford Varsity soccer team
has not participated in any inter
collegiate games this quarter. How
ever, the group has been practicing
faithfully three afternoons a week.
"Old timers" from last year's team
such as Robert Demott, George Kof
fer, Enrique Sidwell, and Richard
Wilbur have returned to form a nu
| cleus for this team.
New players who show great
promise, according to Harry Ma
loney, include Bob Niebel, Fernando
Salinas, and Washington Canas.
Coach Maloney, assisted by former
soccer man Louis Chan, will referee
j the game.
In the past, the soccer team has at
I all times enjoyed phenomenal suc
j cess. At one time the varsity squad
won 42 inter-collegiate games in suc
| cession.
Part of these accomplishments has
been due to the long standing im
portance of soccer in campus ath
letics.
