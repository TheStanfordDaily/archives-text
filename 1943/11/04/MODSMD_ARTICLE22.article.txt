TWO years ago to the day there was an article in the Stanford
Daily which was headlined "Soph Cotillion Sells 279 Bids."
The story continued:
"Featuring the music of Duke Ellington, one of the outstand
ing bands of the nation, the formal dance will be held the night
before the Washington State - Stanford football game."
The dance was on a Friday night, and it was one of the usual
Stanford productions—a crowd, tuxedos, fashionable formals,
and a big-name band. It was fun, too.
Today there's an article in the Stanford Daily which starts
out "Roble, Casa Ventura, and Casa Naranja women will be
hostesses at the Roble Ranch Rumpus Saturday night in the
Women's Gym."
You can bet there won't be tuxedos, fashionable formals, and
certainly not a big-name band (except via records), but there
probably will be one remnant of that dance two years ago—a
crowd.
Because Stanford has learned to stop talking about the good
old days, because we've learned that it's almost as much fun
to jive or glide to records—there are two of the reasons why the
dance Saturday night will mean as much fun to us as Duke
Ellington did to Stanford men and women a couple of years ago.
