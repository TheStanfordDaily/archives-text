TWO weeks ago 60 enthusiastic and eager tryoutees showed
up at The Daily Shack. The seasone dold-timers on the staff
were frankly and obviously amazed at the turnout. But we man
aged to collect ourselves enough to put on a . rigorous try-out
period.
Today 29 new members have been chosen for the staff of
The Daily. A few more will be added when they have com
pleted the requirements. These aspiring journalists have worked
hard. They've spent tedious hours on the desk, composed count
less heads, and written all types of stories. Finally, they took an
examination that we fiendishly created in the small hours of the
morning—and stayed up till the same hours correcting.
To the new staff members who have weathered these past
two weeks, our congratulations. We hope you will continue to
work hard on The Daily, that you will help to make it a better
paper, that you will learn all you can from hours spent on our
"tabby."
Remember, you will be the editors of Volumes to come.
