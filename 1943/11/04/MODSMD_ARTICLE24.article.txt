# Bull Session
## GOD BLESSE YOU! 
### BILL ROSE 
According to yesterday's Daily, there is no cold epidemic on
Campus. Far be it from me to dispute the Student Health Serv
ice, but I have a cold and everyone I know has a cold; so it's
an epidemic as far as Bull Ssesion is concerned.
The causes of all these colds are manifold, I suppose. Cer
tainly one of the principal ones is the heating system around
here. My 1 o'clock classroom is so like a steam bath that many
of the students are contemplating wearing Turkish towels instead
of their normal attire. (This has its possibilities, I'll admit.)
The room where my 2 o'clock is held has undoubtedly been
conditioned as a training ground for the ski troops. The varia
tion in temperature between the two places is, I'm sure, not less
than 20 degrees.
Dr. Helen B. Pryor of the Women's Health Service adds two
more very plausible reasons for this quantity of catarrh: im
proper diet and irregular sleeping and exercise. No one can deny
that the majroity of students are fed an improper diet and that
their sleeping and exercising hours are irregular, if not chaotic.
Just wha we're going to do to improv ethe situation I don't know.
Dr. Pryor gives a third cause, which I am inclined to disavow.
That is, the loose social restrictions. Perhaps the restrictions on
Farm women are a little lenient compared to those enforced at
Tehachapi, but one could hardly call them loose.
