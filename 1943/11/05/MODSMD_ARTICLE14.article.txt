## Popper To Talk On Czech Music 
### 
A native of Czechoslovakia, who
until four years ago was conductor
at the Prague opera house, and who
now is a professor of music at Stan
ford—Dr. Herbert Jan Popper—will
speak on the music of his homeland
at the Tuesday Evening Series on
Nov. 9.
Dr. Pepper's subject is "The Mu
sic of Czechoslovakia." The lecture,
which begins at 7:30 p.m. in the
Memorial Hall, is free to the public.
History
Narrating the history of Czecho
slovakia and its sufferings under
Nazi rule, Dr. Popper will show
how the nation's music has helped
it to hang together.
A few strains of Nazi music he
will play during the program will
demonstrate, Dr. Popper says, the
fundamental difference in the ide
ologies of the two nations.
Music
Accompanying the lecture will be
samples of Czechoslovakian music,
played by Dr. Popper and sung by
his wife. Mrs. Popper will sing first
a group of folk songs in Czechoslo
vakian, and then will sing Dvorak's
gypsy song cycle, one of the out
standing Czech compositions, ac
cording to Dr. Popper.
A group of dancers directed by
Jacques Poley-Ogg will demonstrate
the Czech polka and furiant, ac
companied by Dr. Popper's Czech
music.
