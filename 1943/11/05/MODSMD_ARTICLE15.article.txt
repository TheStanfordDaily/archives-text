ions traditionally change from cot
tons and linens to warmer woolens.
Milady's gingham frock is replaced

Lil' Indian, who has switched from
the cool sun-tans which he wore
last summer to the warm olive drabs
which he now wears. Smartly at

dies all over the campus appear quite
striking, if not fetching, as they
march to class or relax on the library
steps.
An addition in the dress of some
Stanford soldiers is the black arm
band with white bars which they

the wearer as a cadet officer, whose
position is only temporary.
