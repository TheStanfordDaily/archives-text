# Professor Discusses Russia's Part in War
## 
### JEAN HANSSEN 
"I don't think Russia will fight
Japan," said Henry Lanz, professor
of Slavic languages and philosophy,
yesterday. "Russia will supply China
with tanks and airplanes in abun
dance. She will fight with China's
hands and her ammunition."
Professor Lanz does not believe
that it will be to the best interests
of the Soviet government to crush
Germany unless German armies are
completely demoralized and defeated
before reaching the frontier, because
Russia would like to xase Germany
as a sort of buffer state against en
emy invasions. He believes that
Russia is just as afraid of the West
iis the West is afraid of her, and if
Germany were left a weak country,
Russia would be in a vulnerable po
sition.
According to Professor Lanz:
The Russians are very well sat
isfied with the lend-lease aid they
have been receiving from the
United States. If it had not been
for those supplies the Russian
victories of the past few months
would have been impossible. Rus
sia is trying to play up to the
American public. She has used a
very friendly diplomatic tone and
has made some important inter
national gestures to prove her
good will to the United States.
She is trying to pacify the public
opinion of this country and Pro
fessor Lanz believes that the
lution of the Third International was

one of those gestures to promote
United States good will.
When questioned about Russia's
plans for after the war, Professor
Lanz said that she will insist on free
commercial routes through Poland
and the Baltic states and will de
mand the demilitarization of the
Dardanelles. Bessarabia, formerly
part of Russia, and the Baltic states
will be asked for Russia also. As

far as Russia is concerned, Poland
and Finland will be left as sovereign
states.
Russia's sole idea at present, ac
cording to Professor Lanz, is to force
Germany back to her frontier. She
does not intend to interfere with the
post-war arrangements in Germany
except to eliminate fascism and Na
zism from the world. A democratic
German government would be set

up with all the political parties rep
resented except the National So
cialists.
Russia will not stay in the war
and fight Japan after Germany
has been defeated unless she is
attacked by the Japs, who will
not be so foolish as to do thoi, ac
cording to Professor Lanz.
Professor Lanz has just been nom
inated for election to the Council

of the American Geographical So~
ciety as a fellow of the society.
He was a student at the Imperial.
| University in Moscow from 1904 to
1906. From 1906 to 1911 he studied
in Heidelberg and got his Ph.D.
there in 1911. He lectured in aes
thetics at the Beethoven School of
Music in 1914 in Moscow. He has
been at Stanford since 1918 and has
not been to Russia since 1926.

attacked by the Japs, who will
not be so foolish as to do thoi, ac
cording to Professor Lanz.
Professor Lanz has just been nom
inated for election to the Council

of the American Geographical So~
ciety as a fellow of the society.
He was a student at the Imperial.
| University in Moscow from 1904 to
1906. From 1906 to 1911 he studied
in Heidelberg and got his Ph.D.
there in 1911. He lectured in aes
thetics at the Beethoven School of
Music in 1914 in Moscow. He has
been at Stanford since 1918 and has
not been to Russia since 1926.
"I don't think Russia will fight
Japan," said Henry Lanz, professor
of Slavic languages and philosophy,
yesterday. "Russia will supply China
with tanks and airplanes in abun
dance. She will fight with China's
hands and her ammunition."
Professor Lanz does not believe
that it will be to the best interests
of the Soviet government to crush
Germany unless German armies are
completely demoralized and defeated
before reaching the frontier, because
Russia would like to xase Germany
as a sort of buffer state against en
emy invasions. He believes that
Russia is just as afraid of the West
iis the West is afraid of her, and if
Germany were left a weak country,
Russia would be in a vulnerable po
sition.
According to Professor Lanz:
The Russians are very well sat
isfied with the lend-lease aid they
have been receiving from the
United States. If it had not been
for those supplies the Russian
victories of the past few months
would have been impossible. Rus
sia is trying to play up to the
American public. She has used a
very friendly diplomatic tone and
has made some important inter
national gestures to prove her
good will to the United States.
She is trying to pacify the public
opinion of this country and Pro
fessor Lanz believes that the
lution of the Third International was

one of those gestures to promote
United States good will.
When questioned about Russia's
plans for after the war, Professor
Lanz said that she will insist on free
commercial routes through Poland
and the Baltic states and will de
mand the demilitarization of the
Dardanelles. Bessarabia, formerly
part of Russia, and the Baltic states
will be asked for Russia also. As

far as Russia is concerned, Poland
and Finland will be left as sovereign
states.
Russia's sole idea at present, ac
cording to Professor Lanz, is to force
Germany back to her frontier. She
does not intend to interfere with the
post-war arrangements in Germany
except to eliminate fascism and Na
zism from the world. A democratic
German government would be set

up with all the political parties rep
resented except the National So
cialists.
Russia will not stay in the war
and fight Japan after Germany
has been defeated unless she is
attacked by the Japs, who will
not be so foolish as to do thoi, ac
cording to Professor Lanz.
