# Cashier's Office Is Lost-Found Center
## 
### 
Besides selling time schedules,
handling food bills, and numerous
other financial items, the University
Cashier's Office is a lost and found
center —the place where students take
liens, wallets, binders, and other fre
quently lost articles daily between
8:30 and 4:30.
Students who have lost something
usually rush straight to the Cashier's
"Office —about a minute after discov
ering their loss, consequently, before
the article is turned in. And so the
office has a book in which they keep
the name and address of all persons
who come in. When the lost article is
brought in, Mrs. Henrietta Casaretto,
cashier, sends the "looker" a card
reporting the find.
Unclaimed articles are held for an
appropriate period of time and then
are given to the Convalescent Home,
a rummage sale or a comparable
cause. If money is not called for it is
held for a month, after which time
the finder is notified he can have it.
