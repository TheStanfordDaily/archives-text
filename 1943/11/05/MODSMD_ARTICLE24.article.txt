# Stanford Players To Present One-Act Series Next Week
## 
### 
Three of the greatest contemporary
playwrights have written the one-act
plays which the Stanford Players
wlil present next week in their an
nual one-act series.
Experienced Actors
William Saroyan is the author of
"Hello Out There," which stars Duke
Douglass as The Young Man and Jo
Sawyer as The Young Girl.

Both leading characters are expe
rienced in dramatics. Mr. Douglass
appeared in "Glorious Morning" in
Menlo, and Miss Sawyer had the
leading part in the Spring Show, "No
Mother to Guide Her."
"A Village Wooing," the play by
George Bernard Shaw to be pre
sented, originally was a three-act
play condensed to one act.
"It has the meat of the three-act
play, says Director F. C. Strickland,
"the girl-meets-boy first act, the
girl-loses-boy second act, and the
climax in the third act, all rolled into
one with no essentials omitted."
Morgan Stars
Margaret Morgan, who has acted
in the Gaieties and for Orchesis,
stars in this play in her first im
portant role. Stanley Willis, who
plays opposite her, is a junior trans
fer who has had experience at the
Pasadena Community Playhouse.
Like "Our Town," the Thornton
Wilder play, "The Happy Journey"
has a simple homespun quality. It
was one of Wilder's first plays with
the property-less set. The audience's
impressions depend entirely on the
pantomime of the actors, Strickland
said.
A former Stephens College drama
student, Mary Higgins, takes the
central part of Ma Kirby in the one
act. She has worked under the per
sonal direction of Maude Adams.
Other Players
Others in the cast are John Liev
say, Duane Heath, and Henry Zion,
who have appeared in other Stan
ford productions.
The one-acts are scheduled for
Nov. 10, 11, 12, 13, and 15 at 8:15
p.m. in the Memorial Hall audito
rium. Season tickets, which include
admission to five other Stanford
Players' productions during the aca
demic year may be purchased in the
Memorial Hall for $2.75. Sale is
limited to 600 books.
