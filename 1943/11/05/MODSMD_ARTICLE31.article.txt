# Musicale To Feature Elizabeth Popper
## 
### 
Elizabeth R. Popper, contralto, will |
sing the selections played by D.
Sterling Wheelwright, acting organ
ist, at the Stanford Musicale pre
sented next Sunday at 5 p.m. at the
Memorial Church.
The program will include "Largo
in E" by Handel, less well known !
than the Largo movement from
Xerxes but full of dignity. Bo row
ski's "Sonata in A Minor" will come
next, based on the structural pat
tern of most sonatas â€”opening move

| ment, andante movement, and clos
ing with a symphonic march.
The "Song of Autumn" by
Stoughton and a group of songs by
Brahms and Faure are next in the
program. The first is "Ah Death
the Still Cool Night Will Be" and
the second "The Cradles," both sung
by Miss Popper.
Concluding the program will be
"The Festival Toccata" by Fletcher.
The quick repetition of chords makes
this simple melody exciting.
