# Chaparral's First Issue Appears Soon
## 
### 
Contrary to the hopes of the
English Department, Stanford's
own Chaparral will definitely
make its appearance this year. The
first edition will he out around
Thanksgiving and promises to he
filled with more gags, humor, re
partee, bon-mots, and witty epi
grams than ever before. There
will be only four issues this year
but the stalV claims the quality
will make up for lack of quantity.
Doug Hastings, editor, and Bill
Ilyer, managing editor, say they
need 50 beautiful women to sell
Chappies on Quad and work 011
the business staff. There are also
two positions open to men who
want to earn an honest dollar 011
the biz stalT. The usual call for
any and all contributions is made.
Those interested should submit
material to the Chappie office by
Monday.
