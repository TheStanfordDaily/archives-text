## Wooley Stars In Warners' Hit 
### 
THE MAN WHO CAME TO DIN
NEK—Now playing at the Varsity
Theater.
Warner Brothers did a really fine
ob in transferring "The Man Who
Came to Dinner" from the stage to
the silver screen. Some of the "fast"
.ines of this lampoon on the life of the
iate Alexander Woolcott were lost in
the change, but much of the biting
satire still remains.
Monty Wooley is seen as the
famous writer who comes to a small
town for a speaking engagement but
is incapacitated when he slips on the
icy steps of one of the town's leading
residences.
In his hectic period of recovery in
this same house he heaps abuse on
friend and foe alike. Belte is
Wooley's private secretary and, when
not restraining her employer from
destructive measures, rolls those
saucers she calls eyes at handsome
Richard Travis.
Ann Sheridan further complicates
matters by likewise being in love
with the popular Mr. Travis. The
situations that arise from this com
plex plight are indeed amusing.
"The Man Who Came to Dinner"
is one of the top comedies of recent
years. Sophisticated in every respect,
it's a masterpiece of modern wit and
humor.
The second half of the bill tells of
the experiences of "The Youngest
Profession," or autograph hunters.
Virginia Wieldler is the head of a
club of teen-aged autograph hounds
and meets during the course of the
picture Lana Turner, Walter Pidgeon,
Greer Garson, Robert Taylor, and
William Powell.
But in doing so the dynamic Miss
Wieldler gets her family in a mix-up
by spreading the rumor that her
parents are to be divorced. Things
look pretty dark until the script
writers come through with the solu
tion to this domestic problem. "'The
Youngest Profession" is a refreshing
?.nd different comedy, well acted and
entertaining.—Bower
