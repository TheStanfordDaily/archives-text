home to repairing plugs under the cold stare of a corpse in the Anatomy

building, checks in at the Corpora- *
tion Yard every afternoon and from
there is sent out on electrical repair
jobs all over the campus. All her
knowledge of electricity she gained
from a 120-hour course taken in
Casper, Wyo., under the Maritime
