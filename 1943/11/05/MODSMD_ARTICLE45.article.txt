## Army 9-L Soccer Team To Meet Varsity Today 
### Joe Hawkins 
The soccer game scheduled for 4:30 this afternoon on the Intramural
Field between the Stanford Varsity soccer team and the Army 9-L team
will probably be a contest of experience vs. youth, according to Otto Brand,
captain of the Army squad.
He explained this statement by saying that most of his men had come

from Europe, where soccer holds the
same position as does football in this
country. However. Brand continued,
the average age of his team is about
30, as compared with less than 20 for
the varsity. Naturally, this is a de
cided disadvantage, since the game
of soccer requires quite a bit of
endurance, and, as the captain said,
''We are not getting any younger."
The nucleus of the 9-L team was
formed by five members who played
on a STAR unit team when stationed
in Wyoming. At this time they beat
a Navy soccer team, 1-0.
The 9-L's have been here at Stan
ford for only six weeks, and the team
was formed by the men of Pierce
Hall in their spare time about three
weeks ago. They practice three times
a week under the direction of Harry
Maloney, director of minor sports.
Otto Brand said that other foreign
language halls also have good mate
rial for soccer teams, but probably
have not had time to organize.
The 9-L's really have an interna
tional team, since seven European
countries are represented: Austria,
Germany, Hungary, Switzerland.
Belgium, Italy, and Czechoslovakia.
The lineup and experience of the
planers includes: captain of the
team, Otto Brand—University of Vi
enna; Schreiber; Gablik — Hungary
University; Anger—Switzerland and
Dartmouth; Laurens—played in Ital
ian high school; Cramer—played for
the first time in Wyoming; Helling
and Heller—both played in Germany;
Sortes — formerly an outstanding
hockey player; Wolinsky — school
mate of Brand's at the University of
Vienna; and Legrelle—University of
Louvain.
Substitutes include: Kunney—a
U.S. player; Rand, a linguist speak
ing 11 languages—Prague; Feuer—
New York; and Wien and Moses —
both played in Germany.
This team faces several disadvan
tages, not only due to age, but also
because of the difficulty of obtaining
soccer shoes and shin guards. How
over, Brand spoke for the men, say
ing that they would "offer, if not a
good game, at least a fair game, and
would try to avoid injury." He also
stated that after more preparation
they would be able to put on a bet
ter exhibition, but since the 9-L's
are here "primarily as soldiers" they
play soccer mainly for the physical
benefits. Because these men are all
post-graduates, they do not plan to
be here long and all "hope to go
overseas." However, they would like
to play more games as long as they
remain at Stanford.
Starting lineup for the Stanford
Varsity is: De Mott, Smith, Sidwell,
Canas, Salinas, Van Reekum, Koffer,
Bernhard, Niebel, Burnham, and
Wilbur. Players and especially sub
stitutes are asked to be on the Intra
mural Field about 4:15.

overseas." However, they would like
to play more games as long as they
remain at Stanford.
Starting lineup for the Stanford
Varsity is: De Mott, Smith, Sidwell,
Canas, Salinas, Van Reekum, Koffer,
Bernhard, Niebel, Burnham, and
Wilbur. Players and especially sub
stitutes are asked to be on the Intra
mural Field about 4:15.
The soccer game scheduled for 4:30 this afternoon on the Intramural
Field between the Stanford Varsity soccer team and the Army 9-L team
will probably be a contest of experience vs. youth, according to Otto Brand,
captain of the Army squad.
He explained this statement by saying that most of his men had come

from Europe, where soccer holds the
same position as does football in this
country. However. Brand continued,
the average age of his team is about
30, as compared with less than 20 for
the varsity. Naturally, this is a de
cided disadvantage, since the game
of soccer requires quite a bit of
endurance, and, as the captain said,
''We are not getting any younger."
The nucleus of the 9-L team was
formed by five members who played
on a STAR unit team when stationed
in Wyoming. At this time they beat
a Navy soccer team, 1-0.
The 9-L's have been here at Stan
ford for only six weeks, and the team
was formed by the men of Pierce
Hall in their spare time about three
weeks ago. They practice three times
a week under the direction of Harry
Maloney, director of minor sports.
Otto Brand said that other foreign
language halls also have good mate
rial for soccer teams, but probably
have not had time to organize.
The 9-L's really have an interna
tional team, since seven European
countries are represented: Austria,
Germany, Hungary, Switzerland.
Belgium, Italy, and Czechoslovakia.
The lineup and experience of the
planers includes: captain of the
team, Otto Brand—University of Vi
enna; Schreiber; Gablik — Hungary
University; Anger—Switzerland and
Dartmouth; Laurens—played in Ital
ian high school; Cramer—played for
the first time in Wyoming; Helling
and Heller—both played in Germany;
Sortes — formerly an outstanding
hockey player; Wolinsky — school
mate of Brand's at the University of
Vienna; and Legrelle—University of
Louvain.
Substitutes include: Kunney—a
U.S. player; Rand, a linguist speak
ing 11 languages—Prague; Feuer—
New York; and Wien and Moses —
both played in Germany.
This team faces several disadvan
tages, not only due to age, but also
because of the difficulty of obtaining
soccer shoes and shin guards. How
over, Brand spoke for the men, say
ing that they would "offer, if not a
good game, at least a fair game, and
would try to avoid injury." He also
stated that after more preparation
they would be able to put on a bet
ter exhibition, but since the 9-L's
are here "primarily as soldiers" they
play soccer mainly for the physical
benefits. Because these men are all
post-graduates, they do not plan to
be here long and all "hope to go
overseas." However, they would like
to play more games as long as they
remain at Stanford.
