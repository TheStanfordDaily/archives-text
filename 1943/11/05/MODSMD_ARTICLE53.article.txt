# Row Opens Houses
## 
### 
NINE living groups, the sororities on the Row,
will hold open houses this weekend for new
lower division women. Informality will keynote
first off-the-Quad introductions for new women
who wish to visit the sorority houses.
During the series of simple teas, new women
will have the opportunity of dropping in at any
or all of the living groups as they choose. Casual
Quad clothes will be in order.
Pan Hellenic has designed this extremely
informal social weekend so that new women can
become acquainted with sororities under normal
conditions and be introduced to another branch
of campus living.
