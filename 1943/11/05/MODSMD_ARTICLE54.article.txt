# Gather 'Round, Staff
## 
### 
THE enlarged staff of The Daily will gather for
a historic meeting in the Shack Sunday after
noon at 12:30. Both new members and old are
reminded of the importance of showing, for the
Editorial Board has no desire to waste its pearls
of wisdom on the Grut Board Ghosts.
As an added attraction, the Editor will pro
vide tradition-hallowed "afternoon club" for the
assembled throngs following the day's business.
Night Editors and Head Copy Editors are po
litely reminded of COMPULSORY meetings of
the respective groups at 12 noon. Don't shy away
because the powers that be consider these of
tremendous importance.
Naturally, role will be taken and absentees
subjected to fiendish torture.
