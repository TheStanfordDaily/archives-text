# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL ROSE 
SHALL WE DANCE?
Our contributing editor, F. V. of Calabasas
(God bless her!), offers the following bit of bal
derdash concerning the Sweater Sway to be
held tomorrow night by the Monroe Maulers:
Is it "Sweater Sway"
Or "Sweat or Sway?"
I'm sure I can discern.
I hope and pray
It's "Sweater Sway,"
As it's to sway I yearn.
Sweating's no fun
Even in a pun,
And it leaves you kinda wet.
To a "Sway," my hon,
I'd really run,
For it'd be fun, I bet.
Besides I'm took
For a picture book
In my sweater that fits tight;
And when I'm shook,
They'll surely look,
'Cause I'm wearing it tonight.

Good news from Dinah's where, our on-the
spot reporter tells us, the Wave's hat has been
found and returned to its rightful owner, the
much maligned Ensign. It seems the hat was
brought back to Dinah's by the culprits or some

one else. Whether or not they were Stanford
students we do not know.
Anyway, Bull Session is vindicated —at
least in part — for its stand in the case. Perhaps
we even had something to do with its return.
Maybe the column is good for something after
all!
* * *
A grave injustice has been done The Cellar.
In Wednesday's column we Sdid the Lamb Curry
and Rice would be on the 85 cent dinner. In
stead —due to ceiling prices—it was on the 65
cent dinner (a real bargain, I might add). We
apologize, Cellar, for our error and hope sin
cerely that it did not cause you any loss of
trade.
