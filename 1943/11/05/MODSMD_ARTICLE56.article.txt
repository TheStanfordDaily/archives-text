To The Editor:
Here is my complaint: I have just been down
trying to get a reserve book out of the engin
eering library. Evidently the library staff thinks
engineers don't study on Sunday because there
is a polite little sign on the door informing who
ever is interested that the engineering library
is closed on Sunday.
This stopped me for a moment, but then I
had a brilliant idea. I went upstairs to the loan
desk and asked them to enter the library via
the stacks and get the book I needed. They
couldn't do this, however, because they had no
key. In fact, nobody I asked seemed to know
any way of getting in because (they said) there
was no key available.
Now it seems to me that there ought to be
an extra key around just in case of an emer
gency, if for no other reason. If the library is
short of funds, I would be glad to lend them a
buck (at a reasonable interest rate) so that an
other key could be made.
I think the whole unhealthy situation has
resulted from a combination of mismanagement
and a lack of interest in the students' point of
view* by the persons deciding library policy.
I am sure that if they reconsidered it from our
angle, this and many other inconveniences
could be cleared up. —T. M.

To The Editor:
When I first came to Stanford last June, I
was thoroughly drilled by upperclasemen on
what the Honor Code meant at the Farm and
how many other things had come to be tradi
tions. One which struck me as a tradition never
to be broken was the one about no smoking on
Quad. I thought this was a practical idea, as well
as a beautiful one. Not only does it look bad, but
the debris of cigarettes that are left really de
stroys the beauty of the handsome Quad.
Students in uniform are offenders, probably
because they are ignorant of the tradition. But
every day as you walk through the Quad you
see many a civilian, who looks as though he
or she had been around quite awhile, wielding
a cigarette. Even the large signs posted on Quad
don't seem to do much good.
This is a gripe which many students have
expressed, and I wish you would print it, as a
voice for hundreds of tradition following mem
bers of Stanford. —J. Z.

To the Editor:
I am a poor lost civilian, overlooked in the
Battle of the Smiles, Stanford Campaign. I
have come from a long distance and I should
like to add that since their advent, I have never
seen such lovely WACS as now inhabit our
Chancellor's former residence. Since the popu
larity of we male civilians has practically faded
to nothing before the ivory onslaught of the
G.I. boys, and now that the co-eds are priming
their teeth for the Army, I wonder if some
WACS would adopt a poor little male civilian?
Should I smile first, or should I let them make
the advances?

engineers don't study on Sunday because there
is a polite little sign on the door informing who
ever is interested that the engineering library
is closed on Sunday.
This stopped me for a moment, but then I
had a brilliant idea. I went upstairs to the loan
desk and asked them to enter the library via
the stacks and get the book I needed. They
couldn't do this, however, because they had no
key. In fact, nobody I asked seemed to know
any way of getting in because (they said) there
was no key available.
Now it seems to me that there ought to be
an extra key around just in case of an emer
gency, if for no other reason. If the library is
short of funds, I would be glad to lend them a
buck (at a reasonable interest rate) so that an
other key could be made.
I think the whole unhealthy situation has
resulted from a combination of mismanagement
and a lack of interest in the students' point of
view* by the persons deciding library policy.
I am sure that if they reconsidered it from our
angle, this and many other inconveniences
could be cleared up. —T. M.

To The Editor:
When I first came to Stanford last June, I
was thoroughly drilled by upperclasemen on
what the Honor Code meant at the Farm and
how many other things had come to be tradi
tions. One which struck me as a tradition never
to be broken was the one about no smoking on
Quad. I thought this was a practical idea, as well
as a beautiful one. Not only does it look bad, but
the debris of cigarettes that are left really de
stroys the beauty of the handsome Quad.
Students in uniform are offenders, probably
because they are ignorant of the tradition. But
every day as you walk through the Quad you
see many a civilian, who looks as though he
or she had been around quite awhile, wielding
a cigarette. Even the large signs posted on Quad
don't seem to do much good.
This is a gripe which many students have
expressed, and I wish you would print it, as a
voice for hundreds of tradition following mem
bers of Stanford. —J. Z.

To the Editor:
I am a poor lost civilian, overlooked in the
Battle of the Smiles, Stanford Campaign. I
have come from a long distance and I should
like to add that since their advent, I have never
seen such lovely WACS as now inhabit our
Chancellor's former residence. Since the popu
larity of we male civilians has practically faded
to nothing before the ivory onslaught of the
G.I. boys, and now that the co-eds are priming
their teeth for the Army, I wonder if some
WACS would adopt a poor little male civilian?
Should I smile first, or should I let them make
the advances?

Here is my complaint: I have just been down
trying to get a reserve book out of the engin
eering library. Evidently the library staff thinks
engineers don't study on Sunday because there
is a polite little sign on the door informing who

is closed on Sunday.
