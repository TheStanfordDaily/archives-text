# Chapel's Organist Needs Filing Case
## 
### 
"Filing case, filing case, who has a
filing case?"â€”at least so queries Dr.
Wheelwright, acting organist and lec
turer for Memorial Church.
Dr. Wheelwright explained that
when he left Washington, D.C., he
was forced to leave his filing cabinet
there and bring all the class notes in
cardboard cartons. Upon arriving
here, he found the church files al
ready filled, and both the purchasing
department and the corporation yard
completely out of any sort of cab
inets.
Thus Dr. Wheelwright is now
forced to leave in storage material
which, according to him, he "should
be sharing with the students."
Anyone who has a filing case not
in urgent use and who will lend,
lease-lend, or sell, is asked to contact
D. S. Wheelwright, Chapel office, or
call 22894. The case may be either
letter or legal size, constructed of
wood or metal. Dr. Wheelwright
stated that he would provide storage
cases for material from the file not
in ugrent ase, and guaranteed safe
care and transport for the case.
