Preparations for the Roble Ranch
Rumpus are well under way to pro
vide novel and enjoyable entertain
ment for the soldiers and freshman
boys. "Enthusiasm anion? the sol
diers is running high," stated Cour
taney Perren, dance manager, "and
we expect the Roble. Ventura, and
Naranja women to turn out en masse
in their ginghams and jeans to meet
the boys."
Festivities will start promptly at
9:30. Miss Perren announced that
the hostesses would introduce the
soldiers to women so that there
would no "unescorted" men.
There will be both social dancing
and folk dancing, she said, but she
hopes that no one would stay away
from the dance because they could
not folk dance. Regular dance call
ers will familiarize even the most
bashful soldier with the schottische
and polka.
No admission will be charged at
this no-date dance. The Ranch
Rumpus might prove the beginning
of a long series of social activities
with Stanford's Armv boys.
