# Medics Set War Chest Drive Pace
## 
### 
Stanford students this week will try to equal or outdo the effort of
the Med School as the national War Chest Drive begins today.
The Med School drive started when Bob Ayan, a member of the school,
heard about the drive to be conducted for all members of the student
body and decided to sponsor one among the medical students before it
began on campus.
His objective, he said, was to discover how well he could do and to
set an example for all of Stanford.
Ayan's drive was held during the week of Oct. 25 with the help of
Chuck Secor, John Fennington, and Birdsall Carle. A large thermometer
placed in the Med School was used to encourage donations.
The "mercury" was at a "critical condition" level at the beginning of
the week. The mark at the top of the thermometer, indicated "patient
recovered," and was set at $250 in War Chest donations.
The "mercury" overshot its mark when the medical students con
tributed $2!)7 to the drive. This total was collected from 95 per cent of
the school with $7(i received in cash and $221 promised on pledge cards.
The drive on campus will begin today with announcements in house
meetings in every living group, Chick Brubaker, chairman, said yester
day. This drive consolidates all previous war drives and will be the
only one of its kind this year.
Four dollars from each member of the student body is the expected
donation. If the cash is not available during the week of the drive,
pledge cards may be filled out, stating the date and amount of the
donation.
Solicitors in each house, corridor, and casa will collect donations
and pledges all this week. A card will be issued to each student on
which he will indicate the amount of his donation or pledge.
The pledges will be collected on the date indicated on the card. This
date may he any time in the near future.
Funds collected from the Stanford War Chest Drive will be dis
tributed among Dimes for Diplomas, War Student Service Fund, Wat-
Fund Drive (the former Community Chest Drive), and Infantile Pax-al
ysis Fund.
Thirty per cent of the total received from the students will go to
each of these funds, except the Infantile Paralysis Fund, which will
receive 10 per cent of the total.
Members of the War Chest Drive committee assisting Chairman Bru
baker, are Janet Hale, who is in charge of finance; Cally Curtis, who
will collect donations and pledge cards from her representatives and
solicitors in each of the women's living groups, and Norm Schieber, who
is in charge of men's donations.

Stanford students this week will try to equal or outdo the effort of
the Med School as the national War Chest Drive begins today.
The Med School drive started when Bob Ayan, a member of the school,
heard about the drive to be conducted for all members of the student
body and decided to sponsor one among the medical students before it
began on campus.
His objective, he said, was to discover how well he could do and to
set an example for all of Stanford.
Ayan's drive was held during the week of Oct. 25 with the help of
Chuck Secor, John Fennington, and Birdsall Carle. A large thermometer
placed in the Med School was used to encourage donations.
The "mercury" was at a "critical condition" level at the beginning of
the week. The mark at the top of the thermometer, indicated "patient
recovered," and was set at $250 in War Chest donations.
The "mercury" overshot its mark when the medical students con
tributed $2!)7 to the drive. This total was collected from 95 per cent of
the school with $7(i received in cash and $221 promised on pledge cards.
The drive on campus will begin today with announcements in house
meetings in every living group, Chick Brubaker, chairman, said yester
day. This drive consolidates all previous war drives and will be the
only one of its kind this year.
Four dollars from each member of the student body is the expected
donation. If the cash is not available during the week of the drive,
pledge cards may be filled out, stating the date and amount of the
donation.
Solicitors in each house, corridor, and casa will collect donations
and pledges all this week. A card will be issued to each student on
which he will indicate the amount of his donation or pledge.
The pledges will be collected on the date indicated on the card. This
date may he any time in the near future.
Funds collected from the Stanford War Chest Drive will be dis
tributed among Dimes for Diplomas, War Student Service Fund, Wat-
Fund Drive (the former Community Chest Drive), and Infantile Pax-al
ysis Fund.
Thirty per cent of the total received from the students will go to
each of these funds, except the Infantile Paralysis Fund, which will
receive 10 per cent of the total.
