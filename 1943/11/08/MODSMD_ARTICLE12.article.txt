Gay red and white paint has re

Nitery walls and the windows are
gleaming. These are the (irst signs of
he transformation of the Nitery into
che new Stanford canteen.
The walls were painted by the
Corporation Yard Saturday morning,
.following the approval of the Union
Board of Governors, who also voted
$150 toward the entire project. Carol
Hurwitz, Nitery chairman, mid her
committee have started in by wash
ing the windows.
The committee is now working on
plans for the new wooden coke bar,
drapes for the windows, and a group
>112 caricatures to be put on the walls.
Elizabeth Lieck is in charge of the
wall decorations.
Miss Hurwitz has announced that
the Nitery will be closed until fur
ther notice, probably about two
weeks. She requests that all students
not actually working on the remodel
ing please stay out of the room.
The transformed Nitery will serve
as a place for mass informal enter
tainment and a program will be
planned each weekend by different
women's living groups.
The Nitery will also be open during
the week after the remodeling is
finished.
