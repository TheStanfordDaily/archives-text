## Miners Resume Work Today 
### United Press 
WASHINGTON, Nov. 7.â€”The na
tion's 530.000 coal miners were ex
pected to obey a United Mine Work
ers back-to-work order and to re
sume full production tomorrow co
incident with the start of a de
termined new labor assault on the
litel steel wage ceiling formula which
was a key factor in the long mine
dispute.
The union's policy committee has
directed all soft and hard coal miners
to return to the pits without waiting
for final approval of their new gov
ernment negotiated wage contracts.
The War Labor Board approved the
agreement Friday subject to certain
adjustments.
The miners' gains notwithstanding,
CIO President Philip Murray will
begin the most vigorous attack yet
undertaken to force the scrapping of
the little steel formula.
