## Varsity Squad Defeats Army 
### Jim Mitchell 
1 In its first game of the season, the
Stanford varsity soccer squad defeat
ed the Army 9-L team, 5-1, last Fri
day on the Intramural Field. The
game was a hard-fought one
throughout and up until the last few
] moments of the game it was impos
sible for anyone to make any pre
dictions as to what the final outcome
would be. It was the youth and team
work of the varsity squad which
finally won out over the greater ex
perience of Ihe Army 9-L team.
The contrast between the team
work of the Stanford varsity team
| and the Army squad became evident
i early in the game. While the Army
team far outranked the varsity squad
i in the individual excellence of its
players, they lacked the teamwork
i necessary to win soccer games, soccer
| being a sport which requires a great
deal of teamwork among the various
players and not just individual skill
| at the sport. Particularly noticeable
was the high-speed passing among
the varsity forward line which had
their opposition going around in
| circles.
Varsity Aggressive
The ball, during the first half of
! the game, stayed in the Army's end
I of the field while the varsity team
; scored the greater part of their goals.
Almost all the players on the forward
line scored a goal, DofTer. DeMott.
Salinas, and Smith scoring for the
Reds.
Along toward the end of the game,
| the Army team made a comeback
and threatened to score several
times, and probably would have, but
for the excellent work of the varsity
backfield. Their one score was made
by Wolinsky of the Army forward
line assisted by Legrelle.
Plan Soccer League
According to Soccer Coach Harry
j Maloney, plans are being made to
| form an All-Stanford soccer league.
This league will consist mainly of
service soccer teams formed by the
various Army units now at Stanford,
| although the Stanford varsity soccer
squad will be invited to join.
