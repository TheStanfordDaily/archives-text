The End Is Not Yet
TATITH the relaxing of the dimout regulations and reports of
V V the new victories on the Russian front, there arises the
danger of over optimism and the feeling among many people
•that the war will be over soon so why worry.
A reminder that such is not the case came this past weekend
when Japanese forces in the South Pacific showed they were
still a threat and a factor that must be considered in predicting
the outcome of the war.
This tendency to laxness was furthered by the absolving of
the Volunteer Aircraft Observation Corps and its 24-hour watches.
The new legislation by Congress to raise more money to finance
the final effort for victory has, however, helped to rouse some
out of their false security and remind them that there is still a
lot to be done.
The gains in the Bougainville area, the rest of the Solomons,
and the capture of Kiev are, of course, not things to be taken
lightly, but they must be thought of as another step toward the
final one which will bring ultimate victory and not as the final
step itself.—Esther Belew
