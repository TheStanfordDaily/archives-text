RATION points go fast. Even if a person has ration points to
spend, the markets seldom have the produce on which he
wants to spend them. Eggs are a food you order when you go
to a restaurant, just as you do a steak. And milk is again a food
for babies only.
But somehow Stanford University's dining halls serve eggs
and milk. They serve butter. They serve meat. They serve a
lot of dishes that many persons seldom catch sight of at home in
these times.
And so if you don't like a few meals that Stanford has given
you, just try to remember that maybe the person next to you
does. Look back a few days and remember a meal that you did
tike. Always remember that Stanford meals are not as elaborate
as they were, but they fill the bill as far as food values are con
cerned.â€”lrma Cunha
