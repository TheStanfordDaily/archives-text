# Get the Nitery Habit

### 
TN APPROVING the War Board's plan to convert the Nitery to
J. the Stanford Canteen, the Union Board of Governors put their
seal on the culmination of a year's fitful and haphazard attempts
to make the Nitery an on-campus recreation center.
A juke box and coke machine were added to the Nitery last
fall, when Cardinals tried to push the Nitery as the place for on
campus dating necessitated by Excom's social policy and even
more so by cuts in late leaves and gasoline.
Since then, however, the social picture has changed, and it
is for mass informal entertainment that the new Canteen is de
signed. A woman's living group will have the privilege of plan
ning the program for each night of the weekend. The Canteen
also will be open during the week. Drop around soon and see
how you like it.â€”Pat Clary
