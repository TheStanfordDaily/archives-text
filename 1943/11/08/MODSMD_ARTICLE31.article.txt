To the Editor:
Unlike nearly every other library in the country, the Stanford
Library does not open its stacks to the public. Such a course not
only handicaps the student who wishes to browse but makes for
long waits at the loan desk and too much work for the few as
sistants behind it.
Surely Stanford students, admittedly above the average in
intelligence, are intelligent enough to be permitted in the stacks.
Is there any doubt that they will be more careful of the books
and more accurate in returning them to their places than the
general reader in a large city library?
Moreover, since Stanford is presumed to operate on the Honor
Code, there should be no question as to the safety of letting the
students alone in a room with a large number of books.
If the Library does not trust us, wouldn't it save them labor
to post an attendant at the door to the stacks to check books out
.instead of having three at the loan desk running back and forth
getting books which the student decides he does not want?
