## Stanford Film Features Henie 
### 
WINTERTIME—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
Sonja Henie's movie vehicles have
gone steadily downgrade and "Win
tertime" is a big step in the same
direction.
Miss Henie's current musical for
Twentieth Century-Fox finds the
blond athlete stuck in a bankrupt
Canadian hotel with an equally bank
rupt story that is at times positively
stupid. Jack Oakie, as the hotel's
manager, and Caesar Romero, a
singer in the same establishment, are
on hand to lend confusion to the sit
uation and both do grand jobs of
overacting. Cornel Wilde is the
owner of the above hotel and falls in
love with nearly all the feminine
guests. He finally goes all out for
Sonja in best Hollywood style.
Miss Henie's skating scenes are, as
ever, breathtaking as well as beau
tiful. Woody Herman, his clarinet
and his orchestra, help a lot to liven
up the very uninteresting proceed
ings. Woody even warbles a chorus
or two himself. "Wintertime" has
some fine moments of skating and
music but bogs down in the mire of
an extremely poor plot.
The second half of the bill, "Here
Comes Kelly," tells of the escapes of
two young gentlemen named Jimmy
Kelly and Sam Cohen. You can
imagine what happens. The two nit
wits chase everything from night
club dancers to racketeers. "Here
Comes Kelly"—and there goes the
audience.—Bower
