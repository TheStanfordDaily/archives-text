## 
### 
Mischa Elman, eminent violinist,
was presented last Thursday evening
at the War Memorial Opera House in
San Francisco under the auspices of
California Concerts, Inc. Mr. Elman's
program was dominated by the
works of old-world masters.
Brahms' "Sonata in D Minor" was
especially well performed by Mr. El
man as he brought out all the rich
and vibrant tones of this masterpiece.
Another number in which Mr. Elman
showed his polished and flawless
style was Handel's "Sonata in A
Finor."â€”Bower

An improved design for a bomb fin
in mass production will save enough
steel to build two Liberty Ships.
