# Allies Advance on Rome
## Clark's Fifth Smashes Ahead 
### United Press 
ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS, Nov. 7.â€”
Allied armies battled today to the
threshold of the flat valleys leading
to Rome, hammering out fresh gains
of up to five miles all along the Ital
ian front and capturing seven towns
despite increased resistence from
Nazi troops reinforced by a second
new division in as many days.
Two weeks of hard fighting had
carried Lieut. Gen. Mark W. Clark's
Fifth Army past the Volturno line
and the Mt. Masico-Matest defenses
to the Garigliano, last major river
barrier separating the British and
American forces from Campagno di
Roma, the flat lands before Rome.
Light British units already were
across the Garigliano near its mouth
and were striving northward into the
Aurunci mountains where the Ger
mans have anchored their new line.
But these positions already were in
danger of being outflanked by Amer
ican troops smashing in two columns
through the hills west and northwest
of Benefro in an attempt to cut back
to the main Rome road in the Sacco
Valley.
(Disclosing a new deep British
Eighth Army penetration into the
center of the front, the German DNB
agency said German rear guards had
abandoned Carovilli, 10 miles north
east of Isernia in the Suonoma rail
way, as well as Forli and Agnone to
the east.)
