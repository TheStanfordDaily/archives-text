Rehearsal Problem
i The current problem in the re
j hearsals rises out of the fact that
"The Happy Journey" is pantomime
acting. It is proving difficult to cut
things that aren't butter as though
they were butter. The problems of
the play have eliminated some of
the usual cares of the properties de
partment, however. Says Strickland,
"They have to eat hot dogs . . . but
they don't have to actually have
them, they just eat them in their
i imagination."
In response to a plea from David
Sievers, director of "Hello Out
There." a large group of the mascu
line element, predominantly from
J Monroe Hall, turned out for the
! lynching mob scene. Herbert Rubin
jis the leader, Frank Griswold the
I jail keeper, and Jack Lawson, Ellen
Ellery, Pat Nielson, Louise Brierton,
Betty Tweedy, Corinne Woollmaan
(the wife). Betty Rice, Marcia Hoyt,
C. W. Brown, Jean Robinson, Bob
Roantree, Dick Moorsteen. Fred Wil
