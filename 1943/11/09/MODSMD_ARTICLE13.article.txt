## Marton To Talk On Microscope 
### 
The Stanford Electron Microscope,
its performance and construction,
will he the subject of a seminar given
this afternoon at 4:.'50 in the electron
optics laboratory hy Dr. Ladislaus
Marton. His lecture will be accom
panied hy a movie on the construc
tion of this microscope.
Dr. Marton has been working on
the microscope for one and a half
years. He started when the Rocke
feller Foundation made a $65,000
grant to Stanford for the construction
of an improved electron microscope;
and the University, creating the Di
vision of Electron Optics, placed Dr.
Marton, famed Belgian scientist, in
charge.
Many interesting, as well as useful,
applications have been found for this
instrument. Since the first demon
stration in 1937, a great number of
bacteria have been photographed and
their properties and reactions to some
agents studied.
Important uses have been found in
virus research. Infective agents be
yond the limits of visibility of the
best light microscope are visible in
the electron microscope. Their prop
erties can be studied and reactions
investigated tinder the microscope
and important conclusions drawn
about the action of these extremely
small particles.
In chemistry and metallography,
the electron microscope plays an im
portant part, especially in wartime.
The investigation of particle size and
shape distribution of smoke and dust
particles, of colloidal carbon, of col
loidal gold, and of clay particles, are
just a few of its uses.
