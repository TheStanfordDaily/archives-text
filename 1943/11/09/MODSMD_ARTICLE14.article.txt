# 'Big Game' Rally Set For Friday Night
## 
### 
The ''Big Game" rally will be held
Friday night, Nov. 12, in the Union
for all who are planning to attend
the Cal-Bruin game. Not like those
of the old days, this rally will be
more an expresison of Stanford
spirit. Ric Supple says its main pur
pose is "to teach all the kids the
Stanford yells as well as those of
UCLA."
No exact time has yet been de
cided, but it will not last longer than
half an hour at the most, according
to Supple.
