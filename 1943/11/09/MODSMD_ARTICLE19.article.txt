## MURALS Gerona Picked Over Soldiers In feature Tilt of Football 
### Roger Corman 
Pitting the undefeated Fightin'
Q.M. against once beaten Gerona
A.C., the fourth round of the intra
mural touch football league gets un
derway this afternoon. The Fightin'
Q.M.'s have looked good in all their
games to date, but Gerona has lost
only to league-leading Firehouse,
j and rates a narrow edge over the
I soldiers.
After their convincing win over
j Gerona last week, the Firehouse will
have it fairly easy this afternoon

against Tyler Hall. The Firehouse
rates as a solid choice for victory, but
Tyler features a tricky passing and
! running attack spearheaded by Joe
Scott and Scott Chaffee, and could
make things hot for the Firemen.
Navy has a breather against Fill
more, and should have little trouble
in taking the lowly hall team, who
I have yet to win a game.
Tied with the Firehouse for the
league leadership, Dinah's will run
j into some stiff competition from un
beaten McKinley. This game may
have a bearing on the final standing
I of the league, with Dinah's the favor
| ite to take it.
Other League A games put Veritas
A.C. against Co. D Team 2, the
Stoates vs. Adams, and Monroe vs.
the Theta Hashers.
In League B, unbeaten Co. C and

J A meets unbeaten Co. L and F. Both
teams are knocking on the door of
a potential championship, with Co.
C and A slightly the better team due
to a powerful running attack.
The Walter Thompson Coop,
league leaders, have an easy day
I against weak Garfield Hall. Unable
to break into the win column all sea
i son, Garfield should chalk up an
other deleat at the hands of Thomp
l son.
In an all-Army game, Co. E Team
1 should have little trouble in run
ning through Co. D Team 1. Co. E
is undefeated and may step from this
victory to big things.
Co. E Team 3 meets its stifTest
competition to date in Co. E Team 2.
[lie idea ot a third string beating the
second string is something new, but
it could happen. We say Co. E Team
3 by a touchdown.
Finally having gotten a win under
their belts, Lincoln should continue
in the victorious class by taking the
McKinley B's.
Other League B games match Bu
chanan against Tappa Kegga Lager,
and Van Buren opposite Monroe B.
The Dinah's vs. Navy contest,
which was scheduled for last
Thursday, was played Sunday morn
ing. Putting across the first marker,
Dinah's took an early lead and went
on to win one of the best games of
the year, 12-6. The first score came
on a 40-yard pass from Caruso to
Miller, putting Dinah's out in front,
until the third quarter, when Malloy
caught a long pass for Navy and
went over to tie the game up at 6all.
The final tally came on another Ca
ruso heave and won the game for
Dinah's.
