## Escape Issue ‘Reglanded’ 
### Henrietta Nussbaum 
Even more sensational than the
1939 Quad, the reglanded Stanford
Chaparral will burst into publication
once more with a sparkling Novem
ber issue. Edited by a tremendous
staff, the well known local mag could
still use volunteers in the art, liter
ary, and business departments.
Announced by the executive board
early last Thursday was the annual
Chappie Queen-it contest. Winner
of this traditional form fest is tradi
tionally conveyed up the traditional
Row under a traditional full mounted
moon in a 1927 Maxwell. Runners-up
who will vie for positions as Chappie
sales girls for this quarter will be or
ganized by Sidney Hendricks, P.A.
8826.
Theme for the premiere issue will
be an Escapist number. Core around
which the mag will be built is the
recent statement made by Major
Harlow Scroffnik, '17, at a recent
"America Last" convention, "Shrdlu
shrdlu ikhannipan Shrdlu."
