# Resist That Temptation!

### 
BACK in the frontier days of privation and scarcity, when a
man's best friend was his horse, horse thieves were the
lowest form of criminal and were summarily dealt with by
lynch law.
In these wartime days of privation and scarcity, bicycle
thieves fall in the same category and merit the same cruel death
—at least in the opinion of those harassed bicycle owners who
leave home with two minutes to make their 1 o'clock to find
that some friend, acquaintance, or total stranger has "borrowed"
their bicycle.
Bicycles are "borrowed" most frequently from racks outside
the residences by well meaning persons in a hurry. Even down
on Quad, though, one has no guarantee when he leaves his bike
at the Library that he will find it there when he comes out.
Such thoughtless borrowing of course greatly inconveniences
the bicycle's legal owner, who may be counting on its speed to
get to class on time or make an appointment. One girl whose
bicycle was among the missing last week had to run all the way
to her class and arrived out of breath and five minutes late for
an examination. Her bicycle turned up two days later in front
of the Cellar.
Bicycle owners can apply one remedy to the situation—lock
their bikes, whether they leave them in front of their residences
or on the Quad.
Bicycle borrowers can do more, however, by remembering
the Golden Rule, asking the owner's permission, or buying their
own bike. —Pat Clary
