### BILL ROSE 
TO DIE, TO SLEEP!
New York has its Forty-Second and Broadway, San Francisco
its Powell and Market, Hollywood its Hollywood and Vine, and
we have our sleeping porch.
Don't let the word "sleeping porch" fool you. The room I j
speak of is a porch (after a fashion), but what it has to do with
sleeping is beyond me.
Let me illustrate with a hypothetical account. I've got my
studying done (Is this ever hypothetical?) and decide to put in
a good night's rest —say 12 hours. At 10:30 I hop into my night
gown, pull on my nightcap, and—lantern in hand—head for the :
sleeping porch (Webster: A porch where one sleeps. Rose: A
porch).
I stealthily open the door and tip-toe in. I do not turn on the
lights, because —unlike everyone else —I am considerate. I
grope my way through the room, stubbing my toe on every bed
I pass. When I reach my bed (Circa 1860), I slip quietly in. The
sheets are out at the bottom; but I don't fix them, because I don't J
want to disturb anyone. 3esides, I've only lost two toes through '
freezing this quarter and still have several to spare.
When I am settled, I become conscious of the conglomerate
ticking of 50 (some of the fellows have two in case one doesn't
work) Big Ben alarm clocks. I'm not going to let it get on my
nerves, I say. By 11 I am in a cold sweat. By 11:30 I have fallen J
asleep from sheer exhaustion.
I am awakened by a voice calling my name. "Rose!" the
voice calls.
"Yeh," I say.
The reply I receive is unworthy of a college student and un
printable. I go back to sleep.
I awake again. The lights are on and three fellows are stag
gering around the room screaming "Party time, party time."
As they wander out, someone throws an alarm clock at the light. l
All is dark and quiet again. I finally go back to sleep.
Yet again my sleep is broken. This time it's four bridge
fiends. "I still think we could have made that if you'd sloughed
your spade," one of them says.
"Shut up!" a voice cries. I look at my watch. It is 3:30.
At 5:30 the first alarm goes off (one of the fellows has a milk
route). From then till 10:30 an alarm goes off every 15 minutes.
At 10:30 I get up —bedraggled as I am—and wander off to
my 11 o'clock, where I get my best hour's sleep of the day.
