## Grad Writes War Story 
### Nada Skidmore 
In the current Colliers' John Bid
die Dorcy, former Stanford man,
tells a new and fascinating story of
the war, about a small American
built tug "The Massawa Miracle,"
which was partly responsible for
Rommel's defeat by the British Bth
Army in Africa.
Dorcy, who entered Stanford Uni
versity in 1923 and was affiliated with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, graduated
from Stanford in 1927 to follow a
fast moving, dangerous career. He
did commercial diving in the Philip
pines, and then returned to the
United States to become a stunt man
for motion picture studios.
Movie Stunt Man
His assignments included swim
ming the rapids in "Northwest Pass
age," and doubling for Ray Milland
in "Reap the Wild Wind" in an un
dersea struggle with a giant squid.
Lu In the summer of 1942 Dorcy
signed a contract with Captain Edi
son B. Brown to join a deep-sea
diving expedition with destination
unknown. With 13 other men, he
sailed from Port Arthur, Tex., on the
small tug Intent. The mystery voyage
was explained.
The men discovered that their
mission consisted of clearing the
channel at Massawa, a port on the
western African coast, where nine
sunken ships were blocking all pass
age of British supply ships rein
forcing the Bth Army.
Undersea Work
The Atlantic voyage was nerve
straining in its slow progress. Dan
ger seemed to follow the Intent in
the form of constant storms and
nearby subs. A British transport,
mistaking the low-lying Intent for
an enemy submarine one night, at
tempted to ram her. Captain Brown
switched on the running lights an
instant before it would have been too
late for the transport to change her
course.
The Intent reached Massawa and
began her four-month salvaging job.
In 29 days the crew raised the 15,000-
ton German freighter, Liebenfels,
and established a world's record for
speed. In the next three months the
Intent, assisted by two other salvage
vessels, raised eight ships.
Underseaa Work
Their work was done undersea,
the dread of setting oft "booby traps"
left by enemy sabotage officers in the
holds of the sunken ships constantly
before them. Dorcy and his fellow
divers faced death innumerable
times; and yet he wrote, "After en
during the intense heat, flies, and
tropical fever hovering over Mas
sawa, sometimes I think it was better
down below."
Salvagers Return
The salvage ships returned to
America the hard way, down around
the Cape of Good Hope and across
the long stretch of the Atlantic.
To Biddle Dorcy, world-wanderer,
goes the credit for having told at last
the story behind these tense days
while the Intent fought against time
to clear the way for the Bth Army's
desperately needed supply ships. He
has chronicled one of the most vital
feats of the war.

divers faced death innumerable
times; and yet he wrote, "After en

Salvagers Return
The salvage ships returned to
America the hard way, down around
the Cape of Good Hope and across
the long stretch of the Atlantic.
To Biddle Dorcy, world-wanderer,
goes the credit for having told at last
the story behind these tense days
while the Intent fought against time
to clear the way for the Bth Army's
desperately needed supply ships. He
has chronicled one of the most vital
feats of the war.
In the current Colliers' John Bid
die Dorcy, former Stanford man,
tells a new and fascinating story of
the war, about a small American
built tug "The Massawa Miracle,"
which was partly responsible for
Rommel's defeat by the British Bth
Army in Africa.
Dorcy, who entered Stanford Uni
versity in 1923 and was affiliated with
Sigma Alpha Epsilon, graduated
from Stanford in 1927 to follow a
fast moving, dangerous career. He
did commercial diving in the Philip
pines, and then returned to the
United States to become a stunt man
for motion picture studios.
Movie Stunt Man
His assignments included swim
ming the rapids in "Northwest Pass
age," and doubling for Ray Milland
in "Reap the Wild Wind" in an un
dersea struggle with a giant squid.
Lu In the summer of 1942 Dorcy
signed a contract with Captain Edi
son B. Brown to join a deep-sea
diving expedition with destination
unknown. With 13 other men, he
sailed from Port Arthur, Tex., on the
small tug Intent. The mystery voyage
was explained.
The men discovered that their
mission consisted of clearing the
channel at Massawa, a port on the
western African coast, where nine
sunken ships were blocking all pass
age of British supply ships rein
forcing the Bth Army.
Undersea Work
The Atlantic voyage was nerve
straining in its slow progress. Dan
ger seemed to follow the Intent in
the form of constant storms and
nearby subs. A British transport,
mistaking the low-lying Intent for
an enemy submarine one night, at
tempted to ram her. Captain Brown
switched on the running lights an
instant before it would have been too
late for the transport to change her
course.
The Intent reached Massawa and
began her four-month salvaging job.
In 29 days the crew raised the 15,000-
ton German freighter, Liebenfels,
and established a world's record for
speed. In the next three months the
Intent, assisted by two other salvage
vessels, raised eight ships.
Underseaa Work
Their work was done undersea,
the dread of setting oft "booby traps"
left by enemy sabotage officers in the
holds of the sunken ships constantly
before them. Dorcy and his fellow
divers faced death innumerable
times; and yet he wrote, "After en
