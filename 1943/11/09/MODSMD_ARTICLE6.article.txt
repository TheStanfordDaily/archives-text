## 
### 
LONDON, Nov. B.—Adolf Hitler
told the German people tonight they
faced victory or destruction and
called on them to fight to a finish, to
the limit of endurance and the ex
treme of fanaticism.
"However long the war may last
Germany will never capitulate," Hit
ler said. "Believe it or not, the hour
of retribution for the bombing of
German cities will come.
' Our enemies will discover it is
one thing to land against Italians in
Sicily and a very different thing to
land against Germans on the English
Channel in France, or in Norway."
Promising German vengeance for
Allied air raids. Hitler shouted:
"Thank God. although I cannot
reach America today. I have an op
ponent within reach and I will exact
retribution from him."
