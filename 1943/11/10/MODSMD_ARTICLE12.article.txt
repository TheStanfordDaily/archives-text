## 
### 
The Red Ci'oss needs 25-cent
I "pocket-edition" novels to fill
| overseas kits for servicemen. All
girls on campus are asked by
: Twink Davies, Red Cross chair
{ man, to donate these books to the
i War Board office.
Miss Davies announces that this
is purely a voluntary donation
I that will take the place of the kits
; usually made up by the Red Cross
i here. Girls are asked in house
i meetings this week to donate 25
' cents if they don't have any books.
but Miss Davies stresses that the
j books are preferred and the money
can be spent more profitably for
i war stamps.
