# Volleyball Gets Poor Start
## 
### 
Intramural volleyball got off to a
poor start tonight with only two out
of four games being played. Arthur
Hall won over the Theta Hashers by
default; and Buchanan Bearcats beat
Hayes Hall by the same.
In both other games the Army
teams showed skill, endurance, and
oetter organization. Co. E triumphed
jver Washington Hall in a close bat
tle by winning two out of three—
scores: 13-15, 14-4, and 15-6. Co. L.
F.A. showed early superiority over
Garfield Hall by scores of 15-5 and
L 5-9.
By tomorrow night the teams
should be warmed up and we may
expect some good games. Schedule
for Wednesday and Thursday is:
Nov. 10—(7:15) —McKinley Bash
;rs vs. Tyler Hall, and Monroe Hall
v's. Fillmore; —(B:ls) —Dinah's vs.
Theta Hashers, Buchanan Bearcats
vs. Co. E, and Washington Hall vs.
»3ye.
Nov. 11—(7:15) —Garfield Hall vs.
Co. E. and McKinley vs. Hayes:—
,B:ls)—Monroe vs. Co. L. F.A.. Fill
more vs. Tyler Hall, and Dinah's vs.
Bye.
As some may have noticed in yes
terday's schedule for the week, some
|ames have to be played Saturday
norning. This is a regretable cir
cumstance due to the shortage of
:ourts and time.
