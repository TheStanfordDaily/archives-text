## 
### 
An open house is being held this
Sunday at 4 p.m. at the home of Mrs.
Marguerite Slater, 14.Â°>1 Webster
avenue, Palo Alto, for all students
who are interested in music. Dr.
Herbert Popper, assistant professor
of music, will discuss the founding of
a group foi the sole purpose of listen
ing to and enjoying music.
The group will operate in no way
like a class, nor will it include any
rigid organization or dues, according
to Mrs. R. B. Childs, chief sponsor
and advocate of' the group. Records
will be played from the collectio?i of
Mrs. Slater and all other contribu
tors; and members who are inter
ested in playing instruments before
the group will do so on a purely vol
untary basis. An informal spirit will
prevail throughout the meetings.
Although the first meeting will be
held in the afternoon, members will
hereafter assemble in the evening if
it is convenient to those concerned,
Mrs. Childs continued. Any person
interested in this group is invited to
be present this Sunday.
