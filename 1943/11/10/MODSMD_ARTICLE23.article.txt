# Belgian Scientist Lectures On Electronic Microscope
## 
### 
Dr. Ladislaus Marlon, famed Bel
gian scientist, gave a lecture yester- .
! day on the construction and per
formance of his new Stanford Elec
i tron Microscope. This instrument has
| aroused considerable interest be
cause of its ability to transgress very j
considerably the limits set previously ,
lot microscopic observation.
Its outstanding feature is that it 1
operates with electrons instead of j
with light and the optical system is
| constructed of "immaterial" lenses,
i made of electric or magnetic fields.
These fields must be of special shape
i and have properties which are satis- I
factory for the conditions imposed
j tor the optical system. Once these j
conditions are attained, the electron j
optical system is operated exactly as ;
a light optical system.
Other requirements besides these
; are needed. Since an electron can
travel without hindrance only in a
vacuum, the whole microscope must j
be pumped out to a high degree.
This means that specimens and
photographic plates must also be in ;
i a vacuum.
Slides for electron microscopes
! must be extremely thin, owing to I
j special properties of the image-form- j
' ing mediumâ€”the electrons. Collodion
j films of about 1 2,500,000 of an inch
; thick are the supports most common- ;
] ly used.
A great advantage over light op- !
j tical systems is its highly increased
I resolving power. The resolving
; power is the smallest distance shown
by an optical system, and that of the
! electron optical system is about I
1 200 of a wave length of light.
The Stanford microscope has an
! improved optical system and me
; chanical changes in the auxiliary
[construction. The new instrument is
a combination of an electron micro

| scope and electron diffraction cam
era. This latter is an instrument
1 used for exploring the distribution
of atoms in matter. It is also pro
vided with means for stereoscopic
observation of the specimens.
