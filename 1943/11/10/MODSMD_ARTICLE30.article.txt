# CHINESE TOUR
## ASTU Language Students Broadcast, See Chinatown 
### Pfc. Warren W. Unna, Co. K 
Not Mandarin, but definitely a
dialect of Chinese —that is what some
30 second-quarter Chinese language
and area men and a bevy of their
faculty members heard when they
visited San Francisco's Chinatown
last Friday.
Besides touring the largest and
most typical Chinese setlement to be
found in America, the soldiers took a
"breather" in the occidental world
and made an Office of War Informa
tion broadcast to China, employing
conversation accumulated during the
last four months of instruction. The
broadcast was concluded with the
singing of "Ch'i Lai," the march of
the Chinese Volunteers. The entire
OWI performance was made on re
cording discs and will be broadcast
at a later date.
Eat Sliarkfin Soup
Sharkfin soup, the ne plus ultra of
Chinese cuisine, was part of a sump
tuous repast at the Far East Cafe.
Since the meal contained no bread
and the one starch, rice, didn't ap
pear until the end of the meal, the
men considered themselves still half
starved after licking clean some
dozen different dishes.
Included in the tour was a visit to
the Chung Sai, first Chinese news
paper to be established outside of
China. The typesetters, unaided by
such time-saving devices as the lino
type and the rolling press, set the
entire paper by hand. Next came a
glimpse of the St. Mary's school
where Chinese children study their
native language from 5 to 8 p.m.
every day after having attended their
American classes. Soldiers, peeping
in through the classrom doors, made
timid first-graders bury their faces
in books and giggle.
Wrong Dialect
Like an invading Army—the sol
diers and faculty trooped into the
sanctum sanctorium of the Chinese
Six Companies, political, social, and
economic center for the Chinese on
the West Coast.
Since practically all the residents
of San Francisco's Chinatown orig
inally came from Kwantung Prov
ince, the dialect spoken is Cantonese
—a dialect completely different from
the Mandarin (that spoken in North
and Central China and which is now
being taught at Stanford). Conse
quently, when a group of Chinese
six-year-olds came swooping down
on the empty G.I. trucks, the sol

diers' "pu yao" (or, "you shouldn't
do that") was to no avail.
Chinese Opera
The last stop on the Chinese
group's itinerary was a visit to the
Chinese opera house. This reporter
thought he would be very brave and.
having entered, addressed the first
sweet young thing he saw. "Ni hao
ma?", said he. "Hell-o," she purred.
The opera house proved to be quite
a contrast to the Western form of
pomp and circumstance. The house
lights were left on throughout and
perhaps 1/10 of 1 per cent were
listening to the performance. The
rest of the audience was making the
most of the gathering of friends and
munching bits of social discourse.
Fatal Faux Pas
But the soldiers did their best to
watch the opera, and as the curtain
came down on one of the acts (for
the acts seemed to be without num
ber) they applauded vigorously.
Whereupon the rest of the audience
immediately ceased chattering,
wheeled around and then burst into
laughter.
It seems you don't applaud at the
Chinese opera.

in books and giggle.
Wrong Dialect
Like an invading Army—the sol
diers and faculty trooped into the
sanctum sanctorium of the Chinese
Six Companies, political, social, and
economic center for the Chinese on
the West Coast.
Since practically all the residents
of San Francisco's Chinatown orig
inally came from Kwantung Prov
ince, the dialect spoken is Cantonese
—a dialect completely different from
the Mandarin (that spoken in North
and Central China and which is now
being taught at Stanford). Conse
quently, when a group of Chinese
six-year-olds came swooping down
on the empty G.I. trucks, the sol

diers' "pu yao" (or, "you shouldn't
do that") was to no avail.
Chinese Opera
The last stop on the Chinese
group's itinerary was a visit to the
Chinese opera house. This reporter
thought he would be very brave and.
having entered, addressed the first
sweet young thing he saw. "Ni hao
ma?", said he. "Hell-o," she purred.
The opera house proved to be quite
a contrast to the Western form of
pomp and circumstance. The house
lights were left on throughout and
perhaps 1/10 of 1 per cent were
listening to the performance. The
rest of the audience was making the
most of the gathering of friends and
munching bits of social discourse.
Fatal Faux Pas
But the soldiers did their best to
watch the opera, and as the curtain
came down on one of the acts (for
the acts seemed to be without num
ber) they applauded vigorously.
Whereupon the rest of the audience
immediately ceased chattering,
wheeled around and then burst into
laughter.
It seems you don't applaud at the
Chinese opera.
Not Mandarin, but definitely a
dialect of Chinese —that is what some
30 second-quarter Chinese language
and area men and a bevy of their
faculty members heard when they
visited San Francisco's Chinatown
last Friday.
Besides touring the largest and
most typical Chinese setlement to be
found in America, the soldiers took a
"breather" in the occidental world
and made an Office of War Informa
tion broadcast to China, employing
conversation accumulated during the
last four months of instruction. The
broadcast was concluded with the
singing of "Ch'i Lai," the march of
the Chinese Volunteers. The entire
OWI performance was made on re
cording discs and will be broadcast
at a later date.
Eat Sliarkfin Soup
Sharkfin soup, the ne plus ultra of
Chinese cuisine, was part of a sump
tuous repast at the Far East Cafe.
Since the meal contained no bread
and the one starch, rice, didn't ap
pear until the end of the meal, the
men considered themselves still half
starved after licking clean some
dozen different dishes.
Included in the tour was a visit to
the Chung Sai, first Chinese news
paper to be established outside of
China. The typesetters, unaided by
such time-saving devices as the lino
type and the rolling press, set the
entire paper by hand. Next came a
glimpse of the St. Mary's school
where Chinese children study their
native language from 5 to 8 p.m.
every day after having attended their
American classes. Soldiers, peeping
in through the classrom doors, made
timid first-graders bury their faces
in books and giggle.
