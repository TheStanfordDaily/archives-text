# Transfers Tell Former College War Troubles
## 
### Janice Jaqucs 
So you think Stanford has changed
this year! If you're one of the many
complaining about all the incon
veniences of the war, you should
come over and talk to some of the
Naranja transfers at Lagunita who
really know what college war con
ditions are.
This casa has girls from all over
the country: Vassal - , Stevens, Smith,
Greenbriar, Alabama, Occidental,
Utah U., Washington U., Nevada,
Arizona, and from junior colleges
all over California. Some of these
girls bring tales of woe that would
make the most down-hearted Stan
fordite thank her lucky stax - s she is
here.
The girls from the East have the
saddest story to tell, with gasoline
really curtailed because of the great
fuel shortage. Besides these evils, at
Vassar, for instance, the girls have
to do most of the cleaning and vol
unteer waiting on tables. Their late
leaves are in a sad state also, because
of a new system of compulsory Sat
urday classes. Since these classes
can't be cut, the girls are not able to
get away from school very often on
weekends.
They are, however, blessed with a
six-weeks Christmas vacation which
to us sounds like something out of
this world. The reason for this long
vacation is the fuel shortage.
The girls from Arizona say they
were very pleased with our late
leave system for there it is much
more strict. The girls get one 12
o'clock on Friday and a 1:30 on Sat
urday with very strict regulation on
overnights and absolutely no mid
week leaves. To them, therefore,
Stanford is a paradise of freedom.
Smith College with her Waves and
Utah with the thousands of cadets
has more strict late leaves.
The total opinion of all the trans
fers is that they think Stanford is
wonderful in spite of the old Stan
ford students who keep reminiscing
on "the good old days" of 2:3o's. and
cars, and a 3-1 ratio.
