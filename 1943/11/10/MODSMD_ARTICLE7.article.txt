## 
### 
ALGIERSâ€”Gen. Henri Giraud re
signed today as co-president of the
French Committee of National Lib
eration, leaving his rival, Gen. Chas.
de Gaulle, with full power in a re
shuffle of the "trustee" French gov
ernment which eliminated all but
two Giraudists and made room for
French resistance leaders.
Giraud's resignation in no way
affects his command of French forces
in the field, said a communique is
sued by the committee but this com
mand already was limited by the fact
that the committee controlled move
ment of reserves and mobilization of
additional troops.
