### Beth MacVicar 
Picture a quiet evening, a warm
fire, soft music, and you—sprawled
out on the floor in complete and
wonderful relaxation. This is the at
mosphere that will prevail at the
meetings of the music group now
being organized by Mrs. R. C. Childs
of Palo Alto.
Started first among the adults of
this community, the idea of an or
ganization of music lovers is being
spread to include the younger men
and women who are interested in
music for .its own sake.
Observing the lack of attention and
appreciation of music today among
the young people, Mrs. Childs con
ceived the idea of setting aside a
definite time each week for listening
to good music, and if desired by the
members, for discussing it. The music
heard at these meetings will be a
matter of choice of the participants;
they may bring records they enjoy,
or they may volunteer to play an
instrument before the group.
The first meeting will be held at
4 p.m. this Sunday at the home of
Mrs. Mildred Slater, 14151 Webster
avenue. Palo Alto. Dr. Herbert Pop
per, assistant professor of music, will
discuss the theme of the group and
help them formulate plans. The pro
posed program includes one meeting
each week on whatever evening is
agreed upon by all those concerned.
Mrs. Slater, who has volunteered
her home for the first meeting, has
also offered her record collection as
a nucleus of the music which will be
selected for playing. As a result of
the enthusiasm Mrs. Childs has
awakened among the young people,
30 high school students have already
volunteered their support of the
group.
