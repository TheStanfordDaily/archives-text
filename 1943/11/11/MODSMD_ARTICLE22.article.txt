## 
### 
Barbara Pike, crop crew chairman,
has announced the results of this
quarter's crop picking, which ended
last weekend. She praises and thanks
the students for their fine spirit of
cooperation in helping to relieve the
labor shortage by picking walnuts
and tomatoes.
Both men and women students
helped to fill the quotas every week
end. In all, 185 students picked wal
nuts. which represents 700 hours of
work. The 50" volunteers for tomato
picking did a total of 200 hours of
work.
''The Shumate and Jeneke ranches
both greatly appreciated the aid of
the pickers," said Miss Pike, "as it
helped to save their crops. All those
who have worked on the crop crews
will receive checks through the mail."
Every Saturday morning a group
of 10 or more girls worked in the
victory gardens of the Con Home.
These girls have been a great help to
Sam Mac Donald, Con Home care
taker, according to Miss Pike.
The Con Home will need workers
again Nov. 20. but this weekend
work has been called off because of
the football game.
