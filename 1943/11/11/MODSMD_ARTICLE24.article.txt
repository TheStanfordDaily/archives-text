# Engineering Prepares Soph Woman for Post-War Job
## 
### Bernadette Giannini 
Four quarters of six labs a week, mechanical engineering, surveying,
machine shop, and a couple of language courses might be considered quite
an adequate course even for wartime, and the person who accomplished
such a course and was considered the most promising freshman engineering
student as a result, is a young lady at Lagunita Court, Barbara Seaver of
Mar Vista. +

Far from being daunted by what
most of us would call a heavy sched
ule, Barbara has been "thrilled by
every minute here at Stanford" with
possible qualifications arising now
that she has gotten around to the
regular lower division requirement,
Western Civilization, concerning
"that philosophy business."
Watches South America
The most immediate problem fac
ing Miss Seaver seems to be the
possibility that, with her complete
civil engineering course, she won't
be able to take many other subjects
she finds interesting, such as politi
cal science and Eastern history.
Miss Seaver has her mind open to
future possibilities for engineers and
all Americans in post-war South
America, and plans to take more
Spanish courses in preparation.
Parents Happy
Her parents are quite happy that
she has settled upon a program that
she finds enjoyable. She finds the
great variety of courses that her
program offers one of the best fea
tures of it. Surveying takes her into
the countryside, calculus wasn't too
difficult, and machine shop gives her
"a real sense of accomplishing some
thing," even though she gets "a
little dirty."
Miss Seaver claims her first period
of machine shop was about as disad
vantageous for women as she has
found her course. She went unpre
pared to do machine work the first
time and wore a new yellow sweater;
needless to say, she won't do that
again.
