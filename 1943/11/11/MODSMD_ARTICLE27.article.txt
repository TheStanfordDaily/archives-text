## Navy To Face McKinley Team As Underdog 
### Roger Corman 
Suddenly elevated to the position
of favorites in League A by virtue
of their win over the then unbeaten
Dinah's football machine, the Mc-
Kinley Bashers run into some stiff
opposition from powerful Navy »n

the feature game of today's round of
the intramural touch football league.
Unbeaten in four starts, McKinley,
sparked by Tugger Neville, rules as
the pre-game favorite, but Navy
could pull an upset.
The undefeated Firehouse should
have little trouble in running over
Fillmore, who has yet to win a
game, while the Fightin' Q.M. has a
tough contest with Tyler Hall, but
should emerge on top by a fairly
comfortable margin.
Two unbeaten teams clash in the
main contest on the League B sched
ule, Co. E Team 1 and Co. C and A.
Both squads have rolled up impres
sive records, and anything can hap
pen in this game which may decide
the League B champs. Call it Co. C
and A by a touchdown.
The Walter Thompson Co-op,
has made some good showings and
is still undefeated, shouldn't have
much trouble in snowing under the
Co. C Team 2 squad.
The other top game of League B
pits Co. E Team 3 against Co. D
Team 1. Co. D has had a lot of tough
luck all season, but even with all the
horseshoes they can find, they won't
be able to take Co. E.
