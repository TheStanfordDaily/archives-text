# Varsity Meets Co. K in Soccer
## 
### 
Another of those fast-moving
games of soccer has been scheduled
for tomorrow at 4:30 on the intra
mural field. This game is between
the ASTU Co. K team, and the Stan
ford varsity soccer team.
Although the Co. K team has not
had as much practice as the varsity
team, due to the shortage of time,
they should still put up a pretty
fair fight.
Coach Harry Maloney, who will
officiate at the game, stated that
there was some chance for the for
mation of a soccer league, not con
nected with the intramural league,
for playoffs between various Army
teams, as well as with the varsity
soccer team.
