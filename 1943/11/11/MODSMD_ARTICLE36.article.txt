# "Finds Me Unafraid"
## 
### 
TODAY is the 25th anniversary of the Armistice of the first
World War. On the surface, this day is apt to mean little to
us who are cencentrating our thoughts on a new Armistice Day.
But out of that war came one spirit and feeling hard to define.
Perhaps it is the spirit of our men in arms in this war—the ones
who are fighting and dying today for a cause we once believed
was won.
William Henley's Invictus captures the essence of that in
domitable spirit:
"Out of the night that covers me.
Black as the pit from pole to pole,
I thank whatever gods may be
For my unconquerable soul.
In the fell clutch of circumstance
I have not winced nor cried aloud.
Under the bludgeonings of chance
My head is bloody, but unbow'd.
Beyond this place of wrath and tears
Looms but the Horror of the shade,
And yet the menace of the years
Finds and shall find me unafraid."
