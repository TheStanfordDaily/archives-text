UTA7E ARE fighting," said Woodrow Wilson, "for what we
V V believe and wish to be the rights of mankind and for the
future peace and security of the world."
A year later, 25 years ago today, the war was ended. The men
came home—those who had survived. They had survived, but
only physically, because something inside of them had died—
that important something that had made them think only a year
before that they had a cause.
Their cause became a joke, something to be sneered at and
ridiculed. The war was a farce to them, a thing created by a few
.men who started it for financial reasons. All of that talk about
saving the world for democracy was just so much bunk.
But it wasn't bunk. It was true. No matter how much we've
doubted it at times, the cause we're fighting for exists, and it has
to be fought for; anything that's worthwhile does.
So far 80 Stanford men have been listed as prisoners, missing
in action, or killed. And if we here let them go through that for
us and come out of this war with the same cynicism, the same
bitterness that overcame the '20's, we should be shot. It's up to
us from now on.
At 11 this morning a lot of people will stop their business for
just a few seconds to give a thought to the dead of World Wars I
and 11. The thoughts that run through their minds must be the
right kind or we've already lost another war.—lrma Cunha
