These Are Worth Fighting For
STANFORD has always been a tradition-loving place. As
Sherman Mellinkoff once said in this column, "Stanford's favorite
tradition is making traditions." That was true when Mellinkotf
was here. It was still true when I came. I wonder if it is now.
Probably 75 per cent of the present students were not here
before Dec. 7, 1941. Some of them might have been instructed in
the traditions, but there has been no concerted effort to keep the
home fires burning. The few of us pre-war relics who are still
here have made no active attempt to revive or stimulate the time
honored custom for which Stanford is so noted.
So let's—those of us who know them —help the new students
in orienting themselves into the true Stanford spirit of traditions.
Both the lower classmen and the ASTP students have shown
their willingness to adapt themselves to the habits and customs
of the Farm. Let's give them a lift.
Let's stop all smoking on Quad (I've been a flagrant violator
of this one myself, but I'll quit if you will). Let's enforce the
Honor Code —our greatest tradition. Let's keep the girls off the
Law Steps. Let's say "Hello" (I don't know if this has ever been
practice, but now might be a good time to start). And, for gosh
sake, let's give rides to and from Paly.
