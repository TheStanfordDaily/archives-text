A strictly G.I. Glee Club!—at least that's the latest news on the Army
music front, according to Hal Rodrian, under whose direction the singing
group first got started.
Hal went on to explain that this club, known as the Stanford ASTU
Glee Club, was formed about two weeks ago purely to provide relaxation

and recreation, to keep up interest
among the soldiers in music, and, if
the occasion arose, to furnish enter
tainment at any social gatherings.
Sang in Berlin
The glee club is in capable hands,
for Hal has had a long musical
career. He first started as a choir
singer in Berlin, and then took up
the violin. After coming to America,
Hal played in a symphony and choir
in Detroit, where he later directed
his own church choir.
When Hal was sent to Stanford as
a part of the ASTU foreign language
division, he joined the church choir
and played in the Stanford Sym
phony under Ferenc Molnar. Thus
it was that when the music depart
ment first discovered Hal's talents,
Dr. Popper, Professor Molnar, and
especially Dr. Wheelwright combined
efforts tp help him form a soldiers'
glee club.
Will Ship Out
As it comes to all men in uniform,
so it happened to Hal Rodrian. He
received his orders to ship out. The
glee club will continue to practice,
however, under the very capable di
rection of Kurt Wiem of Co. I, and
will be managed by Rudy Nelson,
also of Co. I.
The singing group started with
only a very few, but has gradually
built up to about 18 members now.
Although Dr. Wheelwright was kind
enough to start the club off with
music, they are still looking for new
pieces. The rehearsals are held every
Monday and Friday at 1800 to 1915—
Army time.
