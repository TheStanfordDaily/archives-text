## 
### 
Chvo' Brubaker, chairman of the
War Chest Drive, announced today
that the Dimes for Diplomas fund
will be increased by a 30 per cent
amount from the total contributions
to the War Chest Drive.
Formerly dimes were collected
weekly from the students for this
scholarship fund. This year dona
tions will be included in the $4 that
each member of the student body
will pay or pledge to the War Chest
Drive.
The Service Men's Scholarship,
which is commonly called Dimes for
Diplomas, was set up and will be
administered by the University. All
Stanford men who were not gradu
ated before entering the service will
be eligible to apply for a "War Stamp
Scholarship." Both graduate and un
dergraduate students will be eligible.
The Service Men's Fund originated
in April, 1942, when War Bonds and
Stamps began to be sold regularly on
the Quad every Thursday. On "bond
day" a box, labeled Dimes for Di
plomas, was passed among the tables
at dinner in every living group on
campus, and each student contributed
a dime weekly.
This procedure of collecting dimes
continued until last quarter, when it
was changed under the direction of
Pauline Holcomb Secor.
