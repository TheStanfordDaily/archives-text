# Armistice Day Gaiety Opposed

'"The celebration of Armistice Day
has no place in a world at war." One
of the soldiers on the Stanford cam
pus summed up his idea of the view
point of the general public toward
the anniversary of the first Armistice.
His buddies nodded in agreement.
"You're right, pal, we'd rather not
celebrate this Armistice Day . . . .
just make the next and final one a
day sooner."
The 26th year since the end of the
first World War arrives with no par
ticular fanfare. Dr. David Elton
Trueblood, Stanford chaplain, ex
plains the attitude of the American
public as natural in view of the pres
ent world conditions. He says of the
1918 armistics, "It was a 20-year
armistice and not much more. Today
Armistice Day has lost its meaning
entirely.' Dr. Trueblood points out
that when the next armistice comes,
there will not be the naive accep
tance of peace that was prevalent in
1918. At the first news of surrender,
the people went mad with complete
relief and happiness.
The joy-crazed celebration of the
Armistice was almost universal, ac
cording to Georges Lemaitre, pro
fessor of Romanic languages, who
was in Algiers when peace came and
saw its effect on the citizens there.
Dr. Trueblood's belief is that the
next armistice will bring the Ameri
can people to the most dangerous and
critical period in their history as they
face the problem ot world reorgani
zation. He offers a conclusion that
until that time. Armistice Days will
have no significance, and from the
standpoint of thinking people
throughout the world, "It has lost its
point."
