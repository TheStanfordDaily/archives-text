The resignation of Co-president of
the French Committee of National
Liberation, General Henri Giraud,
leaving General Charles de Gaulle
in full power, is clearly a victory for
the vigorous, independent French
faction, but is not entirely conducive
to close Allied-French cooperation,
according to Georges Edouard Le
! maitre, Stanford professor of Ro
manic languages.
Professor Lemaitre pointed out the
two movements on the French politi
cal scene. The group led by Giraud,
j though democratic, believes that
| France must take a back seat among
I nations after the war; that the gov
j ernment is weak; and that the people
I can never again rise to the heights of
J their former glories.
The DeGaullist movement is com
, posed of vigorous, nationalistic
I French who will not rest until their
j country is once again an influential
| nation. The group, however, is
characterized by strong communistic
tendencies, but, says Lemaitre, '"The
resignation of Giraud is no surprise
to the French; they have been ex
pecting it for several months."
