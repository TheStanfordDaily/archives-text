# Stanford Buries the Axe; Students Migrate En Masse to Berkeley
## 
### Don Langendorf 
The mass trek to Berkeley by some 1.300 Stanford students proves to be
a reality tomorrow morning. Literally speaking, the campus will be about
dead as far as civilians are concerned, with almost three out of every four
students going. A large percentage of the students will go up by car,
! while the remainder will probably take the train.

For those driving, a map is pro
vided with the main roads leading
to California Memorial Stadium. The
best and most practical way is to
take the East Shore Highway as far
as either Ashby or University Ave.
On Ashby, drive as far up as Pied
mont and turn left. If you go early
enough, you might get a good park
ing space. Otherwise, the best way
to go is by way of University and
drive up as far as the street goes,
which is to the entrance to the
campus. On game day, no cars are
allowed inside the entrance. Hunt
around until you find a space—it
won't take more than half an hour
to find one—and walk the remainder
of the way through the Berkeley
campus. In case you should get into
trouble with the directions plus the
map, go into your nearest friendly
service station and ask for directions.
Trains reach the city at Third and
Townsend at 10:15, 11:10, and 11:30.
From the train, the next problem is
to get to the East Bay Terminal. A
large group would find it profitable
to take a taxi. Otherwise take a bus
or a street car on Third street as far
as Mission and walk to First street.
Take the Berkeley train and you are
practically at the stadium. Plan to
arrive at the stadium slightly after
1 p.m.
For those traveling by train or
bus see schedule on Page 8. From
the train depot at Third and Town
send to the East Bay Terminal, the
best way is to go by street car or
bus to Mission street and walk to the
Terminal on First. The bus lets you
off at Seventh and Mission, A street
car will take you to the Terminal.
Take the Berkeley train and you're
as good as at the stadium.
For those wishing to remain in the
East Bay after the game there are
numerous good eating places. Stan
ford students will be welcome to the
Cal after-game dance. The Hotel
Claremont is open for dinner and
dancing.

Take the Berkeley train and you are
practically at the stadium. Plan to
arrive at the stadium slightly after
1 p.m.
For those traveling by train or
bus see schedule on Page 8. From
the train depot at Third and Town
send to the East Bay Terminal, the
best way is to go by street car or
bus to Mission street and walk to the
Terminal on First. The bus lets you
off at Seventh and Mission, A street
car will take you to the Terminal.
Take the Berkeley train and you're
as good as at the stadium.
For those wishing to remain in the
East Bay after the game there are
numerous good eating places. Stan
ford students will be welcome to the
Cal after-game dance. The Hotel
Claremont is open for dinner and
dancing.
The mass trek to Berkeley by some 1.300 Stanford students proves to be
a reality tomorrow morning. Literally speaking, the campus will be about
dead as far as civilians are concerned, with almost three out of every four
students going. A large percentage of the students will go up by car,
! while the remainder will probably take the train.

For those driving, a map is pro
vided with the main roads leading
to California Memorial Stadium. The
best and most practical way is to
take the East Shore Highway as far
as either Ashby or University Ave.
On Ashby, drive as far up as Pied
mont and turn left. If you go early
enough, you might get a good park
ing space. Otherwise, the best way
to go is by way of University and
drive up as far as the street goes,
which is to the entrance to the
campus. On game day, no cars are
allowed inside the entrance. Hunt
around until you find a space—it
won't take more than half an hour
to find one—and walk the remainder
of the way through the Berkeley
campus. In case you should get into
trouble with the directions plus the
map, go into your nearest friendly
service station and ask for directions.
Trains reach the city at Third and
Townsend at 10:15, 11:10, and 11:30.
From the train, the next problem is
to get to the East Bay Terminal. A
large group would find it profitable
to take a taxi. Otherwise take a bus
or a street car on Third street as far
as Mission and walk to First street.
