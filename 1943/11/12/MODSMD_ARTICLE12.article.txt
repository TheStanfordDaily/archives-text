# One-Acts Applauded; Opening Night Promises Good Run
## 
### Barbara Stevens 
Whether or nol the playgoers cared for scenes of sentiment, and whether
or not they cared for Saroyan's bald feeling for life, the excellence with
which Jo Sawyer and Duke Douglass interpreted "Hello Out There" on
the opening night of the one-acts promised all ticket-holders a worth
while evening, no matter how well the two other plays turned out.

' Miss Sawyer was gentle and be
wildered and sincere enough to con
trast well with the gruff, rumpled,
unfortunately - jailed vagabond,
played by Mr. Douglass. Dim light
ing helped to carry the mood of the
audierfce completely.
Even George Bernard Shaw, the
hypercritical, would have applauded
the intellectually bored, slightly
Monty Woolyish, English accent of
Stanley Willis in "Village Wooing."
Margaret Morgan did her share of
the wooing with well portrayed,
open-faced, village-maiden reality.
Involved phrases with long words
nearly tripped the actors at times,
but as a whole the play was excel
lent comedy.
Mary Higgins as Ma Kirby in
Thornton Wilder's "The Happy Jour
ney" brought in a good quota of
reminiscent laughs with her por
trayal of a conscientious, simple
woman, who thought she lived on
the "best street in the world" because
her husband and children lived there.
John Lievsay as a 12-year-old Ar
thur, and Roberta Peeke as sister
Caroline were mischievous, inquiring,
and good support to Miss Higgins.
Harry Zion did very well as a solid
but slightly overridden citizen.
Roberta Suiter was the married
daughter. Incidentally, Norman
Philbrick, the director, filled in ad
mirably for Duane Heath whose ill
ness prevented him from taking his
part as stage manager.
The Stanford Players will give the
one-acts presentation tonight, to
morrow night, and Monday nighkin
the Little Theater.
