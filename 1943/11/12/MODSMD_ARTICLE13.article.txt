# Lost Coke Bottles Expense to ASSU
## 
### 
In the last two months the Asso
ciated Students lost $38.24 because
students have not returned the empty
bottles after using the coke ma
chines near the Nitery, according to
Student Manager Bruce Jessup in a
report to Excom Wednesday night.
During the two-month period,
1,912 bottles, the contents of 79 cases,
were lost at a cost to the ASSU of
two cents per bottle. Many of them
have either been left on the steps
outside or taken home.
"If this shortage continues," Jessup
said, "it will be necessary to remove
the machines permanently. We'll
wait a week to see if the situation
improves."
