# Old-Time Spirit Carries 1,300 to Cal Tomorrow
## 
### 
Approximately thirteen hundred
Stanford students will journey to
3erkeley tomorrow to witness the
Cal-U.C.L.A. game, and to take part
in Stanford's only official rooters'
demonstration for this year.
In lieu of the annual Stanford-
California Big Game, Cal has in
vited Stanford to take over an en
tire section of their stadium, and to
form a rooters' section for the pur
pose of cheering Farm boys now in
the service and playing on both
teams.
"We are not cheering for eithpr
team as a whole, although there will
oe some individual preferences,"
stated Callie Curtis, ticket sales
chairman for the game.
This year's game is a far cry from
past Big Games, but the spirit is
.-till with us in even greater quan
tity, and it must stay with us with
out the benefit of football for the
duration of the war.
Big Games of old have always
been characterized by frenzied pa
triotism on the part of Stanford
rooters, with girls going crazy wor
rying about clothes for the game,
and boys going crazy wondering
how they could start a good brawl
at Cal on the night before the game.
Pre-game activity was climaxed by
the Big Game Gaieties (G.I. Gaie
ties this year, for benefit of frosh),
:he float parade, and finally by the
Big Game Rally where enthusiasm
ran wild, and all speakers were
madly applauded—with the excep
tion of the Cal student body presi
dent. The climax of the rally itself
was the bonfire, built traditionally
by the freshmen to a veritable tower
of wood.
It was at the rallies that the spirit
it' the Stanford Axe reached its full
meaning and where the enmity
against Cal was able to let loose.
But even all this was nothing com
parable to the chaos of Big Game
day. when rooters all, undergradu
ates and alumni alike, really went
:o town. The cheering standards, a
mass of red and white, were a sight
o remember, and the noise and
spirit of the yells was something
more to keep in mind.
Tomorrow's game will be a little
different. There won't be the pro
. usion of rooters' caps, pompoms,
..nd card stunts.

Stanford students will journey to
3erkeley tomorrow to witness the
Cal-U.C.L.A. game, and to take part
in Stanford's only official rooters'
demonstration for this year.
In lieu of the annual Stanford-
California Big Game, Cal has in
vited Stanford to take over an en
tire section of their stadium, and to
form a rooters' section for the pur
pose of cheering Farm boys now in
the service and playing on both
teams.
"We are not cheering for eithpr
team as a whole, although there will
oe some individual preferences,"
stated Callie Curtis, ticket sales
chairman for the game.
This year's game is a far cry from
past Big Games, but the spirit is
.-till with us in even greater quan
tity, and it must stay with us with
out the benefit of football for the
duration of the war.
Big Games of old have always
been characterized by frenzied pa
triotism on the part of Stanford
rooters, with girls going crazy wor
rying about clothes for the game,
and boys going crazy wondering
how they could start a good brawl
at Cal on the night before the game.
Pre-game activity was climaxed by
the Big Game Gaieties (G.I. Gaie
ties this year, for benefit of frosh),
:he float parade, and finally by the
Big Game Rally where enthusiasm
ran wild, and all speakers were
madly applauded—with the excep
tion of the Cal student body presi
dent. The climax of the rally itself
was the bonfire, built traditionally
by the freshmen to a veritable tower
of wood.
It was at the rallies that the spirit
it' the Stanford Axe reached its full
meaning and where the enmity
against Cal was able to let loose.
But even all this was nothing com
parable to the chaos of Big Game
day. when rooters all, undergradu
ates and alumni alike, really went
:o town. The cheering standards, a
mass of red and white, were a sight
o remember, and the noise and
spirit of the yells was something
more to keep in mind.
Tomorrow's game will be a little
different. There won't be the pro
. usion of rooters' caps, pompoms,
..nd card stunts.
Approximately thirteen hundred
Stanford students will journey to
3erkeley tomorrow to witness the
Cal-U.C.L.A. game, and to take part
