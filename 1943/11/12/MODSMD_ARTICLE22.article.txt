# WSSF Will Receive War Chest Donation
## 
### 
The World Student Service Fund
will receive its support from Stan
ford next week when 30 per cent of
the War Chest Fund is donated to
this WSSF. This relief fund aids stu
dents that are in prison or internment
ment camps, or living in a strange
land as refugees.
This autumn 11 colleges and uni
versities are raising funds or col
lecting goods to send to fellow stu
dents of 17 countries—students who
are victims of World War 11. More
than a million dollars have been
raised from all parts of the globe
since the program began in 1937.
American students contributed $425,-
000 of this amount.
The roots of this enterprise lie in

World War I. Since devastation was
largely confined to the continent of
Europe, the program was known as
European Student Relief. Its amaz
ing work of individual aid and re
construction of university life be
tween 1920 and 1925 has set a stand
ard for the work in this war. The
program became international in
1925 and in the period between the
wars it carried on valuable work in
student aid and in the fostering of
in ternational understanding.
Today this organization of World
| Student Relief exists with a world
headquarters in neutral Switzerland
and with administering center in
Geneva, London, Chungking, New
York, and Stockholm.

World Student Service Fund pro
videdes direct relief for students who
are prisoners of war in Germany,
Japan, Canada, India, ad the United
States. The program's first problem
in prison camps is that of morale and
"barbed-wire disease," which results
in neurosis. The WSSF helps to
provide something for the men to do
with their minds and hands, which
is the only preventive of this disease.
These prisoners of war, who are on
both sides of the conflict, are given
a chance to continue their education
by the WSSF who distributes books
and other equipment, and even
makes it. possible for British prison
ers of war in Germany to receive a
degree from the University of

London.
Students who are refugees in
America receive scholarships and
cash loans for school and living ex
penses from the WSSF.
| In China uprooted students are
continuing their studies in meager
j hovels in the hinterland, to which
! they migrated when their universi
ties in the east were destroyed by the
enemy. The Student Relief Commit
j tee aids these dispossessed Chinese
' students by supplementing their food,
supply, helping them to do self-help
work to meet their general expenses,

dents of 17 countries—students who
are victims of World War 11. More
than a million dollars have been
raised from all parts of the globe

American students contributed $425,-
000 of this amount.
The roots of this enterprise lie in

World War I. Since devastation was
largely confined to the continent of
Europe, the program was known as
European Student Relief. Its amaz
ing work of individual aid and re
construction of university life be
tween 1920 and 1925 has set a stand
ard for the work in this war. The
program became international in
1925 and in the period between the
wars it carried on valuable work in
student aid and in the fostering of
in ternational understanding.

headquarters in neutral Switzerland

World Student Service Fund pro
videdes direct relief for students who
are prisoners of war in Germany,
Japan, Canada, India, ad the United
States. The program's first problem
in prison camps is that of morale and
"barbed-wire disease," which results
in neurosis. The WSSF helps to
provide something for the men to do
with their minds and hands, which
is the only preventive of this disease.
These prisoners of war, who are on
both sides of the conflict, are given
a chance to continue their education
by the WSSF who distributes books
and other equipment, and even
makes it. possible for British prison
