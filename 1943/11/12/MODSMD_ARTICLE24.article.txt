# Take It With You

### 
PAGE eight of today's Daily contains all the vital statistics nec
essary for tomorrow's game at Berkeley. We have printed the
most popular Stanford songs and yells, train and bus time sched
ules, instructions to rooters, and even an editorial suggesting
proper conduct.
Tear this page off and take it with you to the game. It'll come
:n handy.
The cartoon, product of the pen of The Daily's great friend,
Ed McLellan, will probably recall nostalgic memories to old Stan
fordites. For several years, the "Li'l Indian" cavorted and con
nived in similar cartoons on game week-ends. He and his "Big
Red Machine" have been out of commission this year because of
lack of replacement parts, but he's managed to put in an appear
ance this week-end, for he lives with the Stanford Spirits.
