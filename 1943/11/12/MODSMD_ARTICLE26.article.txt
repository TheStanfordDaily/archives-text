BECAUSE we're all trekking up to Berkeley Saturday and be
cause some of us are making a week-end of it, the Daily staff
will skip the usual Sunday meeting. BUT the staff will make up
for this playtime by gathering in the Shack at 2 p.m. on Monday.
It might be wise to say now that Edit Board has begun a new
policy: If staff members can't come for some legitimate reason,
:hey had better leave a note with Barbara Stevens ... or else.—
