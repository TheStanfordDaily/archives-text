### BILL ROSE 
THE INVASION IS ON
Tomorrow is a big day for Stanford. Cal plays U.C.L.A. at
Memorial Stadium in Berkeley; and we, in our quiet way, have
stolen fire from both competing schools and turned the game into
an intramural contest staged exclusively for our benefit.
Did anyone stop to think what the Cal and U.C.L.A. students
might feel about our interference? It's like giving a party and
having an aqgressive visitor assume the position of host without
any of the duties it involves. We have done all but demand that
:he game be held down here. (Why we didn't I'll never be able
to figure out.) N
It took plenty of crust to do what we've done. But Cal and
U.C.L.A. have accepted our usurpation of the limelight graciously
â€”even a little patronizingly. Perhaps they feel sorry for their
poor teamless friends in Palo Alto and understand their unpre
dictable ardor.
Anyway, they've been pretty decent about the whole thing.
Let us repay their hospitality by being appreciative guests. Let's
iorget about the dandruff-ridden bear. Let's leave the red paint
3nd hand grenades at home. Let's be good sports!

The definite announcement concerning the Thanksgiving holi
day was good news to all. The statement was so long in coming
some of us were beginning to fear they were waiting for F.D.R.
:o decide whether he was going to run before they'd tell us if
we were going to have turkey at home this year.
However, it's settled now, and everyone is happy. Christmas
at school will be bad enough, but Thanksgiving too would be
sort of hard to take. The thought of at least one home-cooked
meal between now and January 1 should be enough to keep us
going while we sit down to those (to quote Irma Cunha's editorial
Monday's Daily) "dishes that many persons seldom catch sight
of at home."
