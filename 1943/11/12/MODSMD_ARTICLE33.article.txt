# 5-L Army Team To Play Soccer
## 
### 
The second in a series of campus
soccer games will be played today
when Ihe Stanford varsity soccer
team tangles with a Co. K 5-L
squad. Play begins at 4:30 this aft
ernoon on the intramural field.
This is the second real workout
of the quarter for the varsity, since
they played Co. I 9-L last Friday.
Coach Harry Maloney, who is to
officiate at the game, has decided
that there should be free substitu
tion instead of one set of men going
through a complete 30-minute half
as is customary. This is to aid
sportsmanship and to give more ex
perience to both teams.
The Army squad is comparatively
new, having been formed only since
the beginning of Autumn Quarter.
Most of the members had never
played soccer before. However,
three of the men played in Shang
hai when they were very young;
Staff Sergeant Lopez, field captain
for the team, has had some experi
ence; and Peter Chang played at
the University of Hawaii under di
rection of Professor Keesing, who
is now coaching the squad.
Thus with little background to
go on the team started training
from scratch, improving rapidly in
the short time, due a great deal to
the efforts and suggestions of Pro
fessor Keesing.
According to Sidney Heyman,
manager of the 5-L team, the coach
impressed on the men their relative
inexperience and said, "If the var
sity beats us by less than 12 points,
I'll be satisfied." However, the
manager continued by saying that
the team planned to give the var
sity soccer men "a good scrap."
