# Tennis Preliminaries Will End This Week
## 
### 
With most of the preliminaries
still to be played off, the intramural
tennis season is well under way. The
various teams from the living groups
will compete on an elimination basis.
As soon as a team is defeated, it is
eliminated from any further part
in the competition. Harry Wolter,
director of intramural activities,
asks that all preliminary matches be
played off this week-end. If these
matches are not played off by then,
the tournament will have to be
called off.
