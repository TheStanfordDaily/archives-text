At a late hour last night, the four
Daily football experts set aside theii
ouija boards and made their pre
dictions of the big games of the
weekend.
The important game of the week
end is, of course, the Cal-U.C.L.A,
game. After a great deal of bicker
ing, the experts decided that Cal
would win by 6 points. Expert Rog
er Corman, who has the best record
for the season, held out for the
Uclans, figuring that they would,
win by about 7.
