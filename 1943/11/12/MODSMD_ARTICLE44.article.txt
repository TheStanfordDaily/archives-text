# Coburn Movie Weak Attempt
## 
### 
MY KINGDOM FOR A COOK—Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Charles Coburn was a smash hit as
the jolly Dingle in "The More the
Merrier." But he just doesn't have
the fire to carry a picture alone —
especially one sporting such a weak
plot as "My Kingdom for a Cook."
Mr. Coburn is seen as the famous
British novelist and lecturer Rudyard
' Morley, who has come to this coun
j try to improve British-American re
i lations. Whil'e in this country, Mr.
j Coburn's appetite gets the best of
him and he searches in vain for a
I cook, which involves him in all kinds
i of silly goings-on. Poor Charlie tries
so hard for the laughs which just
j don't come.
Marguerite Chapman, a stunning
brunette, portrays Coburn s daugh
: ter, and has the bad luck to fall in
! love with Bill Carter, who is without
j reservation the saddest leading man
this reviewer has seen in many a
day. Mr. Carter had better go back
I to Oklahoma.
Paramount has another of its spy
i thrillers for the second half of the
I bill. This trip dashing Richard Arlen
stars in "Submarine Alert." Wendy
Barrie, looking like something the
| cat brought, in, provides the roman
tic interest. There's the usual quota
of gun play, car chases, and in
trigue as the Germans and Japs come
in for another licking.—Bower
