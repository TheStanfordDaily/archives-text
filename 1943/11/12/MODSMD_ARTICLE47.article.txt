# Rally To Be Held Tonight At 7:30 in Union Square
## 
### 
Don't forget the rally tonight! It will be the only all-student
extra-curricular activity of the year, and the same Stanford spirit
shown in the successful Hallowe'en sing will make the rally a
success. We have the Cardinals to thank for this event, for they
are the ones responsible for the planning of the rally.
Its purpose is a reorientation rally in order to better acquaint
the old students with Stanford songs and yells, as well as teach
the cheers to new Farm members, in or out of uniform.
To start off the evening, a parade led by Ed Carpenter and the
band will march down the Row, collecting students from the halls
and sororities as it goes, until it arrives at the Cellar corner at a
little before 7:30. Everyone should join the ranks, just as in the
good old days.
The rally will start at 7:15 in front of the Cellar. Ric Supple,
assisted by John Carr and Bob Fess, will lead the proceedings
from the roof of the Union, 'his proved successful last spring at
the War Board bond rally.
As a special added attraction, Nan Tilson, associate director
of the "Gaieties," will sing one of the feature songs, "You Big,
Attractive Man." Music and lyrics were written by Blossom
Parke, musical director of the "Gaieties."
Be sure to bring your copy of today's Daily to the rally tonight,
for the song sheets may not go around to all the students. It you
are not sure of the yells and songs after the rally, bring your
Daily to the game on Saturday.
The running order of events is:
1. "Come Join the Band
2. The old spell yell
3. "Sons of the Stanford Red"
4. U.C.L.A. yell
5. Bruin yell
6. "The Cardinal Is Waving"
7. The Indian chant yell

Norm Scheiber, member of the Cardinals and chairman of
the rally, said last night: "It's going to be a big glory-glory affair
just like the old days, band and skit included. The only thing
lacking is a little bonfire, but the fire can be provided by the
rooters. It so happens that the moon will be full, too."
He also stressed the point about game conduct. "It's all right
to say you're going to bury the axe, but you've got to prove it
by acting as if it were buried already. It is expected that good
sportsmanship will be shown by everyone tomorrow."
After the rally, the "Monroe Maulers" will give an open house
from 8:o0 until 11:30 in Monroe Hall. Everyone on campus is
invited to come, date or no date.

sportsmanship will be shown by everyone tomorrow."
After the rally, the "Monroe Maulers" will give an open house
from 8:o0 until 11:30 in Monroe Hall. Everyone on campus is
invited to come, date or no date.
Don't forget the rally tonight! It will be the only all-student
extra-curricular activity of the year, and the same Stanford spirit
shown in the successful Hallowe'en sing will make the rally a
success. We have the Cardinals to thank for this event, for they
are the ones responsible for the planning of the rally.
Its purpose is a reorientation rally in order to better acquaint
the old students with Stanford songs and yells, as well as teach
the cheers to new Farm members, in or out of uniform.
To start off the evening, a parade led by Ed Carpenter and the
band will march down the Row, collecting students from the halls
and sororities as it goes, until it arrives at the Cellar corner at a
little before 7:30. Everyone should join the ranks, just as in the
good old days.
The rally will start at 7:15 in front of the Cellar. Ric Supple,
assisted by John Carr and Bob Fess, will lead the proceedings
from the roof of the Union, 'his proved successful last spring at
the War Board bond rally.
As a special added attraction, Nan Tilson, associate director
of the "Gaieties," will sing one of the feature songs, "You Big,
Attractive Man." Music and lyrics were written by Blossom
Parke, musical director of the "Gaieties."
Be sure to bring your copy of today's Daily to the rally tonight,
for the song sheets may not go around to all the students. It you
are not sure of the yells and songs after the rally, bring your
Daily to the game on Saturday.
The running order of events is:
1. "Come Join the Band
2. The old spell yell
3. "Sons of the Stanford Red"
4. U.C.L.A. yell
5. Bruin yell
6. "The Cardinal Is Waving"
7. The Indian chant yell
8. Nan Tilson
_9. Big six
10. New spell yell
Norm Scheiber, member of the Cardinals and chairman of
the rally, said last night: "It's going to be a big glory-glory affair
just like the old days, band and skit included. The only thing
lacking is a little bonfire, but the fire can be provided by the
rooters. It so happens that the moon will be full, too."
He also stressed the point about game conduct. "It's all right
to say you're going to bury the axe, but you've got to prove it
by acting as if it were buried already. It is expected that good
sportsmanship will be shown by everyone tomorrow."
