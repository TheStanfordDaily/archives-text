# UC-UCLA Tilt Slated Tomorrow
## 
### Don Langendorf 
Much has happened since the last
meeting between California and their
cousins from Westwood, UCLA, in
which the Golden Bears emerged vic
torious by a 13 to 0 score. When they
first met, Cal had Boensch, Cox, and
Joslyn. The Bruins hadn't achieved
any organization. They were de
cidedly weak. There was no doubt
as to which team was superior.
Tomorrow, in their second contest
of the year, California is not the
cinch winner she appeared to be sev
eral weeks ago.
Her crowning achievement of the
year was the game with COP in
which she lost by a mere six points.
Since then, she has lost to St. Mary's
Pre-Flight by 39 points. Last week
she defeated USF by 32. That vic
tory doesn't look as good as it
sounds; for USF has scored only
twice all season.
While Cal has been getting worse,
UCLA has been improving with each
games. Though the Bruins have also
lost recently to San Diego Navy and
Del Monte Pre-Flight, they were not
pushed around as in their early
games and have been exhibiting some
offensive power which may show to
a distinct advantage against the
Bears.
The University of California will
depend upon the hard-charging Dick
Munroe and fast-running Bob Fris
bee, both former Farm athletes, as
well as the shifty right half, Honeg
ger , to sew up the game. It will be
up to the former Stanford men at
guards, Bill Hachten, and Dick Mad
igan, to stop the plunges of the
Bruins. If these former Stanfordites
hold up their end, it looks like a
Cal victory. Other former Farm men
playing for the Bears include Ras
mussen, Whipple, Barsocchini,
Nourse, and Avery
On the other hand, the Bruins have
a couple of former Stanford men on
their first string that can and prob
ably will offer the Bears plenty of
trouble during the afternoon. Op
erating at the quarterback position
in the "T" formation will be Bobby
Andrews, understudy to Ray Ham
mett last year. On the receiving end
of many of his passes will be Dave
Brown from last year's Stanford
varsity. Bob Rohrer will face a for
mer teammate tomorrow at guard
when he lines up opposite either
Madigan or Hachten. The aerial at
tack from Andrews to Brown has
netted the Bruins quite a bit of
yardage this year. It may win to
morrow's game.
Thirty thousand fans are expected
at Berkeley tomorrow to view this
close contest between two poor
teams. Neither has shown much this
season.
