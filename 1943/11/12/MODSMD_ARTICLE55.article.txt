# We'll Swing The Axe Together

An Editorial
TOMORROW we will be the guests of our traditional rivals
in Berkeley. They have invited us to attend their football
game with U.C.L.A. And this fact we must not forget. It
is only through Cal's courtesy and friendly interest that we
will be able to see a good game, en masse, at half the regular
price of admission.
There could be the tendency to recall too vividly the
recent years when Cal was our rival on the football field. All
our interest and spirit was directed towards winning the
game from them.
Tomorrow we will not be their rivals—this year we are
no one's rival. We are going to the game with one purpose
in mind. That is to show our former Indian gridmen, now in
the service, that the Stanford Spirit still lives with us. These
men are playing under different colors now. Our cheers will
be for them, no matter for which team they play. Our spirit
must be impartial and positive for both teams, for in rooting
for both, we are rooting for Stanford men.
We hope that we are not putting ideas in gullible minds
when we say forget the old rivalry with Cal. This is our
chance to prove to the public that we, known for our "Ivory
Towers," have gracefully accepted the fact that training men
for active places in a world at war is more important to us
now than a football team. Sure, we still love a good football
game, and we can still loyally cheer for them men who
once chose to play ball for us. But we're not brainless "Joe
Colleges" trying to revive something temporarily passe.
In accepting Cal's invitation, we assumed responsibilities
to each other as Stanford individuals and to our University
as a whole. Above all, remember that we must be ladies and
gentlemen as a group. We must behave as guests—be spir
ited, yes, but within the bounds of social decorum that rule
the conduct of a guest to his host. We must not give anyone
the right to say:
"Look at those silly Stanford kids. They're letting off that
old collegiate rah-rah, all right, but they've got the WRONG
STADIUM and the WRONG YEAR!"—Jane Glasson.
