ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS, Nov. 11,
(UP) —The Germans have blocked
the big Italian harbors of Leghorn
and Pascara with scuttled ships and
dynamited piers in evident fear of
new Allied landings, it was disclosed
today as British troops, battling
through heavy snows, drove a three
mile salient into the center of the
Nazi defense before Rome.
The Fifth Army plowed through
mud along the western sector after
capturing two key heights overlook
ing the vital German stronghold of
Mignano on the road to Rome. Six
towns tell in the course of advances
all along the front.
The Germans continued sharp but
fruitless counterattacks and took
drastic measures to safeguard their
sea-exposed flanks on both Italian
coasts.
Nearly 275 miles northwest of the

battle line but only 70 miles from
Allied-held Corsica the Nazis blocked
the harbor of Leghorn by scuttling
the obsolete Italian cruiser Quart.»
and a 330-foot merchant ship, re
connaissance photographs showed
Four additional merchant ships were
moved into the harbor entrance to
serve as an outer barricade.
The German trans-ocean news
agency, in a Berlin dispatch recorded
in New York', claimed Thursday two
Allied merchant ships totaling 9,000
tons were sunk and seven other
freighters totaling 40.000 tons were
damaged in a German bombing raid
on Naples harbor Tuesday night.
