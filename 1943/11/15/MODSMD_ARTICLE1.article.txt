# Campus War Chest Drive Opens Today
## 
### 
Today (he War Chest Drive at
Stanford will begin with announce
ments in house meetings in every
living group on campus, according to
Chic Brubaker, chairman of the
War Chest committee. This drive,
which consolidates all previous war
drives, will last one week.
Four dollars is the expected con
tribution from each student. If cash
is not now available, pledge cards
may be filled out stating the date and
amount of donation.
Four Funds Benefit
In addition to the National War
Fund, three ohter funds will be
increased by Stanford's War Chest
Drive. These are Dimes for Diplo
mas, World Student Service Fund,
and Infantile Paralysis Fund.
Each of these four funds will re
ceive 30 per cent of the total con
tributed by Stanford, except the In
fantile Paralysis Fund, which will
receive 10 per cent of the amount.
The student body will try to equal
or outdo the drive conducted in the
Med School by Bob Ayan. This
earlier drive was an effort to set an
example which would challenge the
rest of the students. The $250 goal of
the medical students was surpassed
when $297 was contributed by 95 per
cent of the school.
Committee Members
Members of the War Chest Drive
committee assisting Chairman Bru
baker are Janet Hale, who is in
charge of finance; Cally Curtis, who
will collect donations and pledge
cards from her representatives in
each of the women's living groups;
and Dick Bartle, who is taking over
Norm Schieber's job of collecting
contributions from the men's halls.
Cally Curtis has four assistants who
will head the campaign in the various
women's living groups. These are
Ewell Sale in Roble; Dodie Crile in
Lagunita; Peg McClean in Union,
