# HONOR CODE
## Reynolds Talks To 150 ASTU's 
### 
Men's Council Chairman Jim Rey
; nolds opened a drive to bring Stan
■ ford's Honor Code home to members
!of the armed forces stationed on
campus Saturday morning at 9 when
| he spoke to 150 new trainees on the
! history and significance of the code.
The talk was enthusiastically re
ceived by the new soldiers, who
! voted almost unanimously in favor of
! the Honor Code over any other class
| room examination system.
Emphasizes Importance
Reynolds spoke to the group for
I some 20 minutes, emphasizing during
j that time the importance of the
■ Honor Code at Stanford, both inside
and outside the classroom.
"The Honor Code is a matter of
! individual responsibility," he de
j clared, "and its success will depend
! entirely upon the willingness of the
| individual and the group to comply
j with its rules."
Trainees Discuss Code
The 150 trainees, members of Pro
fessor E. A. Cottrell's foreign area
and language study group, discussed
the Honor Code for half an hour fol
lowing Reynold's talk, and agreed
that it is a much better plan than the
system of proctering now being used
in most of the ASTP classrooms.
Reynolds and other members of
Men's Council hope to discuss the
Honor Code before all the ASTP
groups on campus, with the hope that
the soldiers will ask to have the code
replace the system now being used
in their classrooms.
Should the Army adopt the Honor
Code, it would probably set up a
cadet committee similar to the Men's
and Women's councils to handle any
code violations by soldiers.
