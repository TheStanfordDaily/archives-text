# BETTER-HEALTH TALK
## To Conquer Disease, Adopt Army, Navy Measures—Wilbur 
### 
"If we could apply to our whole
people the preventive and curative
measures being used for the Army
and the Navy we could not only save
,an untold number of lives, but we
..•ould gain complete mastery over
such diseases as typhoid fever, small
pox, yellow fever, lockjaw, and some
others."
With these words Chancellor
Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur began
his discussion of better health care,
which was broadcast Saturday over
station KPO at 4 p.m. as a part of
NBC's "For This We Fight" series.
Personality Factors
Dr. Wilbur stated that although we
have had advanced in science and
medicine, there are so many factors
in the human personality that it is
difficult to control conduct.
"The doctor for soldiers and sailors
can do tar more for them than is
don for those in civilian life, for he
has to take advantage of concentrated
medical facilities and staff and of
dealing with disciplined men under
a prescribed medical or physical ex
amination plan," Dr. Wilbur said.
Too small a number of civilians,
according to the Chancellor, have
periodical physical examinations or
bother with medical care until a
severe illness or accident occurs.
Clinic Systems
Dr. Wilbur told of the extensive
hospital and clinic system which has
arisen since "the advances in medi
cal science have emphasized every
day the increased importance of
medical centers where trained phy
sicians, nurses, laboratory techni
cians and many other helpers can
give adequate and prompt care to
those needing relief."

The better care has been possible,
according to Dr. Wilbur, because (lie
equipment of the centers can be
much more elaborate and expensive
than that possible in every doctor's
office or in places where house to
house attention is given.
Pre-Payment Plan
A pre-payment plan for both pre
vention of disease and the cure of
disease conditions on a voluntary
basis has arisen in many parts of the
country as a means of financing these
new centers, he added.
''With fewer doctors, due to the
war, groups of doctors are coming
together and dividing up the work
that has to be done, and many meth
ods for time saving are being used,"
Dr. Wilbur said.
The well trained physician will
have no trouble finding a place for
his work in the post-war period, ac
cording to Wilbur, because "soldiers
and sailors returning from the war,
after experiencing just what modern
medicine can do, will inevitably seek
lor similar care for themselves and
their families."
Surplus of Nurses
Dr. Wilbur added that there might
be a surplus of nurses and others
who have helped to care for the sick
in connection with the armed serv
ices but that these would be par
tially taken care of also by the de
mand for more modern medical care.
"Medical knowledge is for all, Dr.
Wilbur concluded, "Undoubtedly we
in America will get the best, but
science, with its application in medi
cine, offers to the whole human fam
ily relief from disease, malnutrition,
and injury to a degree never before
possible.
