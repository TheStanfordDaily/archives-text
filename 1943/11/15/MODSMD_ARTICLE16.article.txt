# REVIEW
## Acting Superb In Cagney Film 
### 
JOHNNY COME LATELY — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Johnny Come Lately" is a nos
talgic flash-back into the first years
of the 20th century that tells the
story of a vagabond reporter who
helps a charming old lady run her
newspaper honestly. You've seen the
story time and time again but seldom
with such superb characterizations.
James Cagney portrays Tom Rich
ards, the tramp newspaperman who
is arrested on a charge of vagrancy,
and Grace George, making her film
debut, is the person who saves Cag
ney from jail by giving him a job on
her paper.
Good Performances
Together they rid their newspaper
and the town from the clutches of a
political boss. Both give fine, sincere
performances.
The splendid supporting cast in
cludes Hattie McDaniel as Miss
George's housekeeper and Marjorie
Main as Gas House Mary, proprietor
of the town's "classiest" saloon. Bill
Henry and Marjorie Lord are on
hand for the romance and all the
stuff that goes with it.
Captures Charm of Period
''Johnny Come Lately" moves
rather slowly but in doing so cap
tures all the charm and artistry of
the period. Here's a sentimental
glance back into another day that
will certainly make you forget your
cares of this day.
The second feature, "Yanks Ahoy,''
is another picture that attempts to
make a big joke out of the present
war. William Tracy and Joe Sawyer
act like a couple of dumbbells and
it's lucky for us that the rest of our
Army doesn't act like these two
clowns.—Bower
