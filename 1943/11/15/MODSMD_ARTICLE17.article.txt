# Business Courses To Fill War Need
## 
### 
To meet the need for trained office
| workers for war industries and gov
ernmental agencies, the Graduate
School of Business is sponsoring
I courses in shorthand, typewriting,
j office practice, secretarial accounting,
merchandising, and similar fields.
A prominent military officer re
cently stated to a Washington audi
ence, "The modern lighter is essen
tially an operator of machines, and
j in nearly every replica of modern
lighting conditions the business ma
chine is to be found along with the
jeep, the howitzer, and the gun
carriage."
Harry B. Mitchell, president of the
United States Civil Service Com
mission, says that the government
has been searching lor adequately
j trained office workers which are so
I necessary for efficient war produc
tion and war campaigns. He says
that this search has only met with
I partial success.
Students, both men and women,
who are interested in this type of
service should see Mrs. Campbell,
| executive secretary of the school,
with reference to the courses. Ac
cording to present plans they will
be offered during the forthcoming
Winter Quarter.
