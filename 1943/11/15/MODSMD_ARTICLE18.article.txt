## 4L's Kickin' Dutchmen Schedule Soccer Game With Company K 
### 
Fresh from a hard fought 3-2 victory over the 9L Soccer Stars,
the Kickin' Dutchmen of 4L Roosevelt Hall have scheduled a soccer
game with the 5L Soccer team of Co. K. Coached by Professor Felix
M. Keesing, the 5L squad will oppose the Dutchmen Saturday at
1 p.m.
Last Friday the Dutchmen overpowered the 9L team in one of the

closest matched battles seen at Stan
ford this year. Led by Captain Ralph
Berger, John Scoville, and Henry
Saltwick, the Dutchmen grabbed an
early lead, saw it tied up, and then
scored twice more to win.
On a smooth breaking play, Sco
ville kicked the first goal of the
match, to put the Dutchmen out in
front. Charging back, the Stars
dominated the play, maneuvering the
ball clown the field to score, and even
the game up again. From here the
two teams fought back and forth on
an equal basis, until Saltwick tallied
for the Dutchmen.
Taking advantage of their op
ponents' errors, the Dutchmen again
charged down the field to score, this
time Scoville booting the sphere over.
Behind by a 3-1 score, the Stars
rallied to score again and put them
selves back into the game. The final
whistle blew a little later, ending a
series of desperate Star tries, as the
Kickin' Dutchmen won 3-2.
