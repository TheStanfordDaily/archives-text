### Roger Corman 
The Daily sports experts really
came through this week. Alter being
just average among pigskin prog
nosticators for week after week, the
staff turned on the heat this time,
picking 24 games correctly out of 25,
for one of the best records all over
the nation this week.
Deciding factor in the good show
ing was the work of Sports Editor
Don Langendorf, who trailed the
other experts all season long, only
to take top individual honors this
week with a record of 23 out of 25.
Langendorf picked the favorite in
each game and came out all right
with the exception of the Arkansas
versus Southern Methodist game, in
which Arkansas upset the dope
bucket by dropping SMU 14-12; and
the Bowling Green-Ohio Wesleyan
contest, which Ohio won.
Second man was Ed Luce, who
picked 22 correctly, while Barney
Gugel and Roger Corman picked 21.
For the season's total, Corman
leads with a record of 86 out of 98, or
.878. Breaking a two-week deadlock,
Luce pulled ahead of Gugel with a
total of 84 out of 98, or .857, while
Gugel picked 83 correctly for an
average of .848. Cutting down the
dead of his rivals, Langendorf still
trails with a record of 82 out of 98,
or .838.
