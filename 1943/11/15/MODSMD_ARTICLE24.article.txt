# We Swung the Axe Together

[T WAS good to hear the California section give the Stanford
spell Saturday as the 1,300 Stanfordites did who journeyed to
Berkeley to root for the ex-Stanford men on both the Bear and
Bruin teams.
Since the Stanford section was impartial the rooters yelled
for both teams, though it seemed strange to spell out California
and UCLA instead of Stanford. We want to thank Cal for their
invitation which gave us the opportunity to show the former Farm
men now in the service that the Stanford spirit is still alive.
The after-game period when the Cal section came across the
field not only showed that the traditional rivalry is still present,
but also, to guote Friday's Daily, that "we're not brainless 'Joe
Colleges' trying to revive something temporarily passe."â€”Esther
