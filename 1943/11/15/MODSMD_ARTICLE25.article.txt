### BILL ROSE 
Was It Harry-Kiri?
All is again quiet in Nassau and thousands of American
women (and men, I suppose) must content themselves with the
boring details of Russian victories and successful air attacks on
Rabaul until some one-year-old raises an incriminating, though
besucked, thumb at Errol Flynn and squeals, "Dada!"
The highly exaggerated importance of the DeMarigny trial
in the news was to me very humorous and not a little indicative
of the tenor of the American reading public. I'll bet a great many
Americans could talk longer and more passionately on the guilt
or innocence of the rather insignificant count than on their opinion
of America's position in the post-war world.
The comparatively conservative S.F. Chronicle went overboard
Friday and placed the words "De Marigny Acquitted of Murder"
across the top of its front page. Below this was the name of the
paper and below that a headline about the Bougainville fighting.
Obscurely scattered over the rest of the page were small
articles about the Soviets capturing more than 100 towns, Roose
velt sending Henry F. Grady to Italy, Churchill creating a Min
istry of Reconstruction, and similar trivia.
The more sensational S.F. Examiner dispensed with a war
headline entirely Friday and simply splashed
DeMARIGNY ACQUITTED!
DEPORTATION DEMANDED
in heavy black print across the face of its paper. Over half of the
rest of the page was filled with news and pictures of the trial.
Best laugh of all, however, was a picture in the Chronicle
which showed the count seated beside a large, round-faced, very
black man. The caption underneath read something like this:
"Count DeMarigny (RIGHT) and a Bahaman detective on their
way to the trial."

A fellow who listened to Saturday's game over the radio
tells me it was a very amusing performance. The announcer
was continually turning the mike over to the "UCLA rooting
section and band,' 'whereupon the familiar strains of "Come Join '
or "Sons of" would come blaring out.
At one point, my friend tells me, the sportscaster announced
"a yell from the UCLA rooters." What he heard sounded remi
niscently like "Steee-N-For-D." To top it off the game concluded
with "The UCLA Hymn," which began "Where the rolling foot
hills rise."
The confusion of the announcer was understandable, however.
Even the rooters themselves didn't seem to know just who or
what they were cheering for. One girl (who will undoubtedly end
up as Roble sponsor if she isn't one already) solved the dilemna
diplomatically, I think.
When Cal was threatening the UCLA goal in the third quarter
this co-ed shrieked—all in one breath, mind you—"Hold that line!
We want a touchdown!"
Another example of the turmoil created in the students' as
well as the radio listeners' minds came when an unoffensive little
man walked up to a Stanford girl in the S.P. station after the game
and asked, "Who won?"
"We did," the girl answered gleefully.
"Oh," the little man said and he walked awav.
