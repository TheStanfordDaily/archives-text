# WAR CHEST
## Relief Funds Get Donations 
### 
When you contribute your four
dollars to the War Chest Drive, only
30 per cent of it will actually go to
the War Chest Drive that is being
staged all over the United, according
to Chic Brubaker, chairman.
This National War Chest Drive is
one combined, annual campaign for
war relief funds in an effort to save
the time and effort of individual con
tributors and the many volunteer
workers who would otherwise have
to call over and over again for the 17
separate organizations now included
in one contribution.
National Quotas
The national quota for the War
Fund is $125,000,000. Of this total
55 per cent is for services to the
armed forces: the USO, which is
"the home away from home" for
America's fighting men throughout
the United States and overseas; the
United Seamen's Service, which
provides similar aid, including rest
homes, and convalescent centers for
merchant sailors carrying men and
munitions to forces overseas; and the
War Prisoner's Aid, which gives edu
cational, spiritual, and recreational
service in prison camps to relieve the
monotony of stagnant idleness.
Twenty-one per cent of the Na
tional War Fund is for relief to the
United Nations. Aid to our three
major Allies is administered through
the Russian War Relief, which gives
chiefly medical supplies and clothing;
the United China Relief, which aids
the war-weary Chinese; and the
British War Relief Society, which
gives support mainly to hospitals,
children's homes, and ambulance
units.
Relief in Occupied States
Eleven per cent of the national
fund is for relief in occupied coun
tries. Food and medical supplies are
distributed, as far as possible, in
Greece, Poland, Belgium, Czecho
slovakia, and Norway.
The remainder of the fund will be
needed for refugee relief; for the
care of European children that are
now homeless in America; and for a
reserve for future contingencies in
countries which will be reoccupied
by the Allies.
The War Chest Drive in Palo Alto

United Seamen's Service, which
provides similar aid, including rest
homes, and convalescent centers for
merchant sailors carrying men and
munitions to forces overseas; and the
War Prisoner's Aid, which gives edu
cational, spiritual, and recreational
service in prison camps to relieve the
monotony of stagnant idleness.
Twenty-one per cent of the Na
tional War Fund is for relief to the
United Nations. Aid to our three
major Allies is administered through
the Russian War Relief, which gives
chiefly medical supplies and clothing;
the United China Relief, which aids
the war-weary Chinese; and the
British War Relief Society, which
gives support mainly to hospitals,
children's homes, and ambulance
units.
Relief in Occupied States
Eleven per cent of the national
fund is for relief in occupied coun
tries. Food and medical supplies are
distributed, as far as possible, in
Greece, Poland, Belgium, Czecho
slovakia, and Norway.
The remainder of the fund will be
needed for refugee relief; for the
care of European children that are
now homeless in America; and for a
reserve for future contingencies in
countries which will be reoccupied
by the Allies.
The War Chest Drive in Palo Alto
is being conducted by "General"
Frank Walker, to whom Stanford will
present 30 per cent of the total fund
raised by this week's War Chest
Drive.
When you contribute your four
dollars to the War Chest Drive, only
30 per cent of it will actually go to
the War Chest Drive that is being
staged all over the United, according
to Chic Brubaker, chairman.
This National War Chest Drive is
one combined, annual campaign for
war relief funds in an effort to save
the time and effort of individual con
tributors and the many volunteer
workers who would otherwise have
to call over and over again for the 17
separate organizations now included
in one contribution.
National Quotas
The national quota for the War
Fund is $125,000,000. Of this total
55 per cent is for services to the
armed forces: the USO, which is
"the home away from home" for
America's fighting men throughout
the United States and overseas; the
United Seamen's Service, which
provides similar aid, including rest
homes, and convalescent centers for
merchant sailors carrying men and
munitions to forces overseas; and the
War Prisoner's Aid, which gives edu
