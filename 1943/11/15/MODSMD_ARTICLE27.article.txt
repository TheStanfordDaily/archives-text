# Roble Presidents Serve in WAVE's
## 
### 
That Roble Hall does nothing half
heartedly is again proved by the fact
that not one, but two of its past pres
idents are now serving in the
WAVE'S.
Miss Rosamond Clarke, director of
Roble, has received frequent letters
from Sylvia Berry, class of June
1941; and Barbara Sadler, 1942. En
sign Berry, a Phi Beta Kappa, was
one of the first officers to graduate
from Smith College in Massachusetts.
In the service since October 1942, she
is now chief of the communications
office at Smith and also welcomes
new recruits. One of the first re
cruits she met was Lieut, (j.g.) Mil
dred Worswick. former secretary of
the Stanford Committee of Public
Exercises.
Barbara Sadler, who succeeded
Sylvia as president of Roble and
joined the WAVE's largely under
her influence, is now an ensign in
the Naval Procurement Office at
Portland, Ore.
Both girls speak of the immense
pleasure and satisfaction they gain
in filling a vital role in the war ef
fort. They describe Navy life in
glowing terms and express the wish
to talk to Stanford's senior women
and urge them to take their place in
the service.
First to break the line of Roble
presidents in the WAVE's will be ,
Pat Thuressen. present head of the !
freshman hall. After graduation. Pat
plans to join the Red Cross.
