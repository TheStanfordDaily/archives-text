# Humanities Class Meets Tonight
## 
### 
Special evening sessions of Hu
manities 15, Introduction to Music,
will start tonight. They will be held
on Monday and Thursday evenings
from 7:30 to 9 in the Women's Gym
nasium. The public is also invited to
these classes.
As a consultant and guest lecturer
in the course, Mrs. Miriam Lidster
will present phases of music and the
dance. On Monday evening she will
teach the class the steps of early
classical dances such as the pavane
and gavotte and on Thursday eve
ning, in connection with the regular
folk dancing program, the combined
groups will learn certain nationalist
dances such as the polka, mazurka,
and the schottisch.
"Rhythm is learned only by ex
perience and not lectures," said D.
Sterling Wheelwright, instructor of
the music course. "We shall remem
ber more the steps by which the
symphony grew if we actually dance
to the classical suites from which
modern concert music has evolved."
