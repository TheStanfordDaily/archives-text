Servicemen want books and maga
zines. An all-campus drive to collect
reading material for the servicemen's
libraries will open today and con
tinue throughout the quarter. The
year's goal is 1,500 books or maga
zines per month, according to lan
Bradley, chairman.
The Service Library Committee
distributes books and magazines to
training camps, ships and battle
fronts. British and American freight
ers are equipped with books. Fifteen
thousand magazines a week are sent
overseas to Guadalcanal, North
Afrcia, and other battle fronts.
Books on Carriers
Four aircraft carriers on active
i duty are carrying books originally
j from the Stanford Library. Page
Mill Camp is also served by a Serv
i icemen's Library. The Palo Alto
branch of the committee is headed
by Mrs. Eugenia Frost and located at
370 University avenue.
During last year's drive 1,000
books and magazines were collected
from Stanford in one month. This
year boxes will be placed at points
about the campus, such as the Libe,
the Quad, and in all civilian living
groups, according to Bradley. Maga
zines should not be more than three
months old unless they are Esquires
or Fortunes, he said.
