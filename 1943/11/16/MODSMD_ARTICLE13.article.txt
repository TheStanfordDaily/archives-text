# Halls Answer Pan-Hell Plan
## 
### 
In answer to a Panhellenic pro
posal to solve the sorority question
by establishing two new houses on
the campus, hall women last night in
their house meetings signed a state
ment giving their reasons for op
posing the plan.
The hall statement, prepared by
Beverly Duncan, president of La
gunita, and Jane Mason, president of
Union Unit, will be presented to the
committee of the Board of Trustees,
headed by George Ditz, which has
been considering proposals to abolish
sororities since last February.
Four Changes Suggested
The Panhellenic proposal, which
suggests four changes, will also be
offered to the board. It includes the
addition of two more sororities now
and more after the war; the pledging
of more girls and housing of the
overflow in the halls; postponement
of rushing to Spring Quarter; and
postponement of pledging to the
junior year.
The hall women's statement said
that if more women were pledged,
the campus would be more divided
into hall and row, and those who did
not pledge would be more hurt. They
added that national sororities would
not be likely to risk setting up a new
chapter at Stanford at this time.
Tlie row women advocated pledg
ing 45 instead of 30 members, thus
permitting more women to pledge,
but allowing them to continue to live
in the halls until there were vacan
cies in the houses.
"If row and hall sophomores were
living side by side ill feeling would
only be increased," the hall state
ment declared.
Gain in Deferred Pledging
The hall statement admitted that
deferring pledging to the junior year
would have advantages in that
women would know better which
house they liked. They warned, how
ever, that if a woman waited twc
years to be pledged and then was re
jected, her disappointment would be
intensified.
Latest in a series of agitations
against Stanford sororities which be
gan in 1918, the current move for
abolition was opened last winter by
a group of Roble sponsors, including
both row and hall women.
They proposed that there be no
rushing or pledging; that the Uni
versity take over the sorority houses,
and that a dormitory be built after
the war to replace them.

Union Unit, will be presented to the
committee of the Board of Trustees,
headed by George Ditz, which has
been considering proposals to abolish
sororities since last February.
Four Changes Suggested
The Panhellenic proposal, which
suggests four changes, will also be
offered to the board. It includes the
addition of two more sororities now
and more after the war; the pledging
of more girls and housing of the
overflow in the halls; postponement
of rushing to Spring Quarter; and
postponement of pledging to the
junior year.
The hall women's statement said
that if more women were pledged,
the campus would be more divided
into hall and row, and those who did
not pledge would be more hurt. They
added that national sororities would
not be likely to risk setting up a new
chapter at Stanford at this time.
Tlie row women advocated pledg
ing 45 instead of 30 members, thus
permitting more women to pledge,
but allowing them to continue to live
in the halls until there were vacan
cies in the houses.
"If row and hall sophomores were
living side by side ill feeling would
only be increased," the hall state
ment declared.
Gain in Deferred Pledging
The hall statement admitted that
deferring pledging to the junior year
would have advantages in that
women would know better which
house they liked. They warned, how
ever, that if a woman waited twc
years to be pledged and then was re
jected, her disappointment would be
intensified.
Latest in a series of agitations
against Stanford sororities which be
gan in 1918, the current move for
abolition was opened last winter by
a group of Roble sponsors, including
both row and hall women.
They proposed that there be no
rushing or pledging; that the Uni
versity take over the sorority houses,
and that a dormitory be built after
the war to replace them.
In answer to a Panhellenic pro
posal to solve the sorority question
by establishing two new houses on
the campus, hall women last night in
their house meetings signed a state
ment giving their reasons for op
posing the plan.
