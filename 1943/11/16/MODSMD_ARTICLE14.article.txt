# Students of Japanese Now in Armed Forces
## 
### Jim Ford 
After Pearl Harbor, America found
herself facing an enemy whose
unique and exceedingly difficult
language was understood by only a
handful of persons other than the |
Japanese themselves. The govern
ment's urgent need for translators
and interpreters of the Japanese lan
guage could be met only by compe
tently training the hundreds of ex- |
perts needed by the War and Navy
departments.
Joining in this program were 24
Stanford students who enrolled last
Winter Quarter in the School of Hu
manities' intensive Japanese course, j
which was offered with 20 units of i
University credit. All of these 24 !
students are now in government j
service, with the exception of one !
woman, Audrey Salter, who is now !
finishing her undergraduate work â– 
nere at Stanford.
{() Hours a Week
Six hours a day, five days a week, j
the group took liberal doses of read
ing, writing, and conversing in this
most complicated of all languages,
which the students laconically de
scribed as "one helluva workout."
All this stiff program they pursued
with the idea that it would some day

lead to equally stiff jobs. Now they
have those jobs.
Among those students now serving
in the Navy are two WAVE's, Jean
Barnes and Caroline Tyson. Dr. Hunt
B. Jones, who was on duty with the
Navy at the time he took the 20-unit
course, is now serving as a flight sur
geon in the South Pacific area.
Other class members now in the
Navy include Donald Ayers, Travel's
Durkee, Jay Reeve, and Donald J.
Wilson. Jack Burdick is in the Ma
rine Corps.
Sent to Michigan
Others of the group were sent to
1 the Army Japanese language schools
J at Ann Arbor, Mich., and Savage,
i Minn. These Army students include
John Boucher, Robert Butow, James
i'Frolik, James Keister, James Lester,
j William Miller, Charles Rosenberg,
j Clark Palmer, Joseph Running, Wal
! lace Smith, Ward Lane, Alvin P.
Zelver, and John Leddy.
! Serving as civilians in other gov
j eminent agencies are G. Luhrs
Stroud and James Welsh. Welsh is
employed at the Tule Lake Intern
ment Camp.
Atcheson Directs Course
Directing the intensive Japanese
! course was Acting Instructor Doug
las Atcheson, who was assisted by
! Mrs. Tuksoon Kim. Margarita Kopf.
and Kuang Hao Hsiao of the Hu
manities Department, and Professor
j W. L. Schwartz of the Romanic Lan
| guage Department.
"One of the basic reasons for the
I students' success was the fact that
j they cooperated wholeheartedly in a
task which was difficult for them and
| the instructing staff," Atcheson
j stated recently in observing the
I progress of Stanford's "intensive 24."
