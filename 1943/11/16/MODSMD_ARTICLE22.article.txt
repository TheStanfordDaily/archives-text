# MURAL FOOTBALL
## Firehouse Picked To Beat Fightin' Q.M. in Top Game 
### Roger Corman 
Battling to keep their undefeated records clear, the Firchouse and the
Fightin' Q.M., the two most powerful teams in League A of the intramural
football circuit, meet this afternoon. Both squads have records of five wins
against no losses, and are tied for the league lead. On the basis of previous
form, the Firemen rate a slight edge, but the soldiers have a fast and tricky

team that may give them the game"*
and the inside track for the cham
pionship.
After reaching the heights against
Dinah's, McKinley reached a low in
losing to Navy, 36-12, yesterday
morning and should roar back with
a resounding victory over Fillmore,
which has been getting a little more
potent lately, but still hasn't won a
game.
The unbeaten Stoates meet Tyler
in an affair that can go either way.
Tyler should be just good enough to
make a battle of it, but the Stoates
will take this one.
Navy Will Win
Fresh from pounding previously |
unbeaten McKinley, Navy won't :
have much trouble with Veritas A.C., |
who have yet to win a game.
Dinah's, who lost to McKinley,
who lost to Navy, who lost to Dinah's,
will get a real fight from Monroe,
but should emerge on top with a
fairly safe margin.
Theta Hashers are on the up j
grade, while Gerona A.C. is on the
down grade. The Hashers rate a !
slight edge, but Gerona may find j
enough of their early season form to !
pull an upset.
Co. I> To Take Adams
Co. D Team 2 should take Adams !
by a comfortable margin. Adams j
hasn't won yet, and there's no reason j
why they should today.
The Monroe B's, dark horse of
League B, run into tough company
when they meet Co. E Team 2. Mon
roe has the better record, but the
soldiers are much stronger than their j
record would indicate. String along
with the dope sheet, and take Monroe
by a touchdown.
Co. E Tean*i 1 has too much fight {
for Tappa Kegga Lager, and should j
win easily.
Co-op Loses
The Walter Thompson Co-op was
toppled from the ranks of the unde
feated last week, but should bounce
back with a victory over Co. D team
1.
In a game which will mean the
end to the loser's championship
hopes, Buchanan meets Co. L. F.A.
Buchanan has a smooth working
team, but the soldiers should prove
too much for them.
Other League B games pit Lincoln
against Co. A, Garfield versus Mc-
Kinley B, and Co. E Team 3 against
Co. C and A.
