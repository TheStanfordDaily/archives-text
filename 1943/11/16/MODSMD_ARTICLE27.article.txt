# Defaults Feature Mural Volleyball
## 
### 
After soundly defeating Monroe
Hall 15-0 and 15-4 last Thursday
j night and proving to all watchers
| that they were easily the best team
in the volleyball league, the L, F.A.
Army team was not able to show up
last night due to compulsory study
hall, and thereby had to default to
Tyler Hall.
The LFA group had excellent
teamwork and individual stars and
were expected to walk away with the
title. It is probable that they may
have to default most of the games
they have scheduled.
Returning to their ways of last
' quarter, Hayes Hall failed to put in
an appearance last night, forfeiting
j to Fillmore Hall.
Completing the evening's activities,
Buchanan and Garfield were victors
| over Dinah's and Washington re
spectively in some more defaults.
