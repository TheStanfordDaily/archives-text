# Maloney Forms Soccer League
## 
### 
Soccer, fast becoming an important
University sport, has finally realized
its ambitions with the formation of a
soccer league under the sponsorship
of Harry Maloney, director of minor
sports, and various company com
manders, particularly Ist Lieut. Mc-
Coy of Co. I; and organized by the
able soccer man Pfc. Otto Brand of
Co. I.
Five teams have been organized
already: the Stanford Varsity, three
teams from Co. I, and a team from
' Co. K. Signups for new squads will
i be held this week, and it is hoped
that at least three will enter to fill
out the league. Those interested are
urged to contact Harry Maloney or
Pfc. Brand and give the name of the
J team, the company, and the man in
j charge.
When signups are completed, rep
j resentatives from each team will be
contacted to meet to draw lots for
: playing positions and to unify the
I rules, since some of the details of
; European soccer differ from the
American version. Play will prob
! ably begin next week, or as soon as
' possible since the men may ship
at any time.
