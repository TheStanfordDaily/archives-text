### Sgt. GASTON VALCOURT COMPANY I, A.S.T. P 
The Treasury Department regretfully informed the public
the other day that there is a shortage of $10,000 bills—a condition
of which Stanford's G.I. students have been acutely aware for
some time.
The poor and the improvident may take heart, however, in
the fact that money is likely to become obsolete as a purchasing
agent if wartime tendencies persist. And a good thing too, we
say, fresh from an inspection of our billfold which revealed
nothing but the decomposed cadaver of a moth.
Proof of our suspicion lies in the current story of a govern
ment employee whose salary was recently upped from $2,300
to $2,400 a year. On the strength of her raise, she embarked on
an expensive bender, only to discover on her return that her
inflated paycheck, minus additional tax deductions to which her
raise subjects her, leaves her in effect somewhat poorer than she
was before.
In North Africa, Italy, and New Guinea, natives have found a
ready market for their wares among G.I. souvenir hunters. But
do you think for a moment that a mere greenback is going to pry
these souvenirs loose from their manufacturers? Not on your
life. An Arab burnoose will cost you 525 or a can of beans.
Famished Sicilians adamantly refuse to exchange their terra
cotta for any currency at all, although the doughboy may take
his pick simply by parting with a few cans of Field Ration C. In
New Guinea, practical belles of the South Seas aren't selling
their grass skirts for dollar bills this season. But, offer them a
piece of junk jewelry and you can carry away enough sarongs
to clothe a line of Rockettes.
All of which seems to us a step in the right direction. Per
sonally, we have always been allergic to money—more accu
rately, money has been allergic to us—,and we have reached
the stage where we regard currency, like a thrice-bidden guest
who spurns our invitation, as a commodity which can very well
be done without.
"I get along without you very well," will be the leitmotif of all
our business transactions from now on, and we only hope our
business associates will cooperate with us. The resurrection of
the ancient custom of barter should have a fine purgative effect
upon our cluttered homes. Personally, we can't wait to dump the
bulk of our accumulated treasures on the counter of the green
grocer on the corner in exchange for a combination salad.
The barter system would provide a dignified outlet for un
wanted wedding gifts and inherited furniture. And the most
conventional business transaction would assume a sociological
significance in establishing the relative values of a leg of lamb
and your ancient aunt's garnet necklace. Expensive trivia would
descend to their proper level in the natural scheme of things,
giving way to subsistence commodities, construction materials,
helicopters, player pianos, girdles, and similar items, vital to life
itself.
In the final analysis, even the priests of high finance have
always betrayed a latent distrust of currency for, while the gentle
man from the credit company may listen respectfully to your
rosy accounts of checks in the mail, you know darn well that
he is simultaneously figuring how to get your piano down the
back stairs.
A fig for money, we say, snapping our impecunious fingers
derisively. You can't take it with you anyway. What if there is
a shortage of $10,000 bills? We don't care. It's the five-spots
we're worrying about.
At this point, we must be excused to attend to a matter in
volving the loan of a dollar bill. Of course, we wouldn't touch the
stuff except that our cleaner is a retrogressive creature, no candi
date for the world of tomorrow, who clings to his old fashioned
ideas and insists on cash before relinquishing our only clean
pair of pants. Too bad. We had a perfectly beautiful moustache
cup picked out for his approval.

The barter system would provide a dignified outlet for un
wanted wedding gifts and inherited furniture. And the most
conventional business transaction would assume a sociological
significance in establishing the relative values of a leg of lamb
and your ancient aunt's garnet necklace. Expensive trivia would
descend to their proper level in the natural scheme of things,
giving way to subsistence commodities, construction materials,
helicopters, player pianos, girdles, and similar items, vital to life
itself.
In the final analysis, even the priests of high finance have
always betrayed a latent distrust of currency for, while the gentle
man from the credit company may listen respectfully to your
rosy accounts of checks in the mail, you know darn well that

back stairs.
A fig for money, we say, snapping our impecunious fingers
derisively. You can't take it with you anyway. What if there is
a shortage of $10,000 bills? We don't care. It's the five-spots
we're worrying about.
At this point, we must be excused to attend to a matter in
volving the loan of a dollar bill. Of course, we wouldn't touch the
stuff except that our cleaner is a retrogressive creature, no candi

ideas and insists on cash before relinquishing our only clean
pair of pants. Too bad. We had a perfectly beautiful moustache
cup picked out for his approval.

The Treasury Department regretfully informed the public
the other day that there is a shortage of $10,000 bills—a condition
of which Stanford's G.I. students have been acutely aware for
some time.
The poor and the improvident may take heart, however, in
the fact that money is likely to become obsolete as a purchasing
agent if wartime tendencies persist. And a good thing too, we
say, fresh from an inspection of our billfold which revealed
nothing but the decomposed cadaver of a moth.
Proof of our suspicion lies in the current story of a govern
ment employee whose salary was recently upped from $2,300
to $2,400 a year. On the strength of her raise, she embarked on
an expensive bender, only to discover on her return that her
inflated paycheck, minus additional tax deductions to which her
raise subjects her, leaves her in effect somewhat poorer than she
was before.
In North Africa, Italy, and New Guinea, natives have found a
ready market for their wares among G.I. souvenir hunters. But
do you think for a moment that a mere greenback is going to pry
these souvenirs loose from their manufacturers? Not on your
life. An Arab burnoose will cost you 525 or a can of beans.
Famished Sicilians adamantly refuse to exchange their terra
cotta for any currency at all, although the doughboy may take
his pick simply by parting with a few cans of Field Ration C. In
New Guinea, practical belles of the South Seas aren't selling
their grass skirts for dollar bills this season. But, offer them a
piece of junk jewelry and you can carry away enough sarongs
to clothe a line of Rockettes.
All of which seems to us a step in the right direction. Per
sonally, we have always been allergic to money—more accu
rately, money has been allergic to us—,and we have reached
the stage where we regard currency, like a thrice-bidden guest
who spurns our invitation, as a commodity which can very well
be done without.
"I get along without you very well," will be the leitmotif of all
our business transactions from now on, and we only hope our
business associates will cooperate with us. The resurrection of
the ancient custom of barter should have a fine purgative effect
upon our cluttered homes. Personally, we can't wait to dump the
bulk of our accumulated treasures on the counter of the green
grocer on the corner in exchange for a combination salad.
