# REVIEW
## Bob Hope Film Not up to Par 
### 
THEY GOT ME COVERED — Now
playing at the Menlo Theater.
"They Got Me Covered" is not one
of Bob Hope's best pictures. It has a
plot that should be a natural for
Hope's brand of wisecracking, but
the dialogue moves slowly and isn't
up to par. Paulette Goddard, as ever,
proves to be a good foil for Bob's
jokes besides presenting plenty of
feminine allure.
Hope is seen as a foreign corre
spondent who doesn't get the scoops
he should and is brought back to this
country by his hard-boiled editor.
Everything goes bad for Hope, with
his girl (Paulette Goddard) even
turning against him. Finally he gets
on the trail of some German spies
and, after several futile attempts,
captures them for the police. Of
course the fickle Miss Goddard re
turns to Bob in time for the final
l'adeout.
The picture is pretty bad until the
late few minutes when the spies are
apprehended in a hilarious beauty
parlor scene. You'll probably be
disappointed at "They Got Me Cov
ered" but this fact won't bother most
people who are seeking escapist en
tertainment.
The second feature is a wretched
mess that bears the title "Girls in
Chains." It's a story about the
troubles and loves of women prison
ers, in which positively sickening
actresses play the feature roles. Any
further comment would be unprint
able.—Bower
