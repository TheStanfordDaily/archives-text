# Drive Chairmen Announce Goal
## 
### 
Fifteen thousand books and maga
zines are needed to fill the quota of
the Servicemen's Book Drive, ac
cording to Inky Bradley and Martha
Stratton, chairmen. This reading
material, after being collected, will
be given to servicemen in training
camps, on ships, and at the battle
fronts.
Boxes for books and magazines
have been placed in men's and wom
en's living groups, the main library,
the Cellar, and on the Engineering
Corner. Magazines should not be
more than three months old unless
they are Esquires or Fortunes,
Bradley said.
The Servicemen's Library Com
mittee has been distributing donated
reading material to British and
American freighters, to such battle
fronts as North Africa and Guadal
canal, to aircraft carriers, and to
training camps in this country for
the last two years.
This year's all-campus drive start
ed yesterday and will continue
throughout the quarter. Soldiers and
faculty members are not being so
licited; but any donations they wish
to make will be appreciated by the
library committee.
This drive is not affiliated with the
Red Cross drive for 25-cent pocket
editions of novels. These pocket edi
tions will be put in overseas Christ
mas kits and should be handed in to
the War Board office.
The Palo Alto branch of the Serv
icemen's Library Committee is head
ed by Mrs. Eugenia Frost and is lo
cated at 370 Universitv avenue.
