LONDON, Nov. Mi. â€”Striking into the eastern edge of the Pripet marshes,
Soviet troops yesterday extended their seige arc around Gomel, main Ger
man base in southern White Russia, by cutting the next to last railroad
out of the city and narrowing the enemy's escape route to a 40-mile corridor
on the northwest.
Tanks, cavalry and infantry under Gen. Markian M. Popov, advancing 12

miles north on the fifth day of the'
latest Gomel offensive, stormed into
the rail town of Demcchi, 35 miles
west of Gomel, splitting another seg
ment from transportation routes
joining German forces in Northern
Russia with those in the Ukraine.
Moscow communiques announced
the fall of 14 towns fortified by the
Germans on the Gomel front and
more than 40 others 170 miles to the
southwest on the Zhitomir-Koresten
sector.
Moscow announced that more than
4,600 Germans were killed and 95
tanks were destroyed in Monday's
fighting extending from the Gomel
area to the Kerch sector of the Cri
mean peninsula.
Up to 3,000 Germans were killed in
the fighting south and southwest of
Rechitsa, 28 miles west of Gomel,
along the right bank of the Dneiper
where the Russians maneuvered
through the marshland between the
Dnieper and Pripet rivers to score
victories which left the Germans
faced with evacuation of Gomel or
certain entrapment.
