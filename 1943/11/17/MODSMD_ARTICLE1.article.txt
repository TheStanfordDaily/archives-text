# War Drive Supported By Students
## 
### 
Returns from Stanford's first War
Chest Drive show complete backing
by Farm students. The drive began
with a bang when A.O.Pi and Gam
ma Phi contributed 100 per cent in
the first day of the drive. Each of
these sororities donated approxi
mately $105, according to Janet Hale,
in charge of finances for the War
Chest Committee.
Corridor 3A in Roble almost
reached the 100 per cent ranks when
23 of the 24 girls contributed their
four dollars.
The War Board office helped the
War Chest Committee by contacting
all students who live off-campus for
their contribution. Besides the War
Board receptionists who assisted in
this work, there are also four girls
who receive special merit for their
assistance. These are Mary Ellen
Boothe, Emily Metzger, Joan Vande
carr ,and Elaine Wood.
War Chest Chairman Brubaker
urges all solicitors to turn in their
collections and pledge cards as soon
as possible, either after the conclu
sion of their collection or partially as
the drive progresses.
