With soldiers marching up and
down the Quad, WAC's occupying
the President's home, and officers
and men snapping quick salutes en
route to an 8 o'clock class, Stanford
graduates Capt. Margaret Hale Stone
and 2nd Lieut Betty Pleasant John
ston would probably feel quite at
home if they returned to visit the
campus.
Both women are now taking an
active part in the war by serving in
the WAC, Captain Stone at Fort
Oglethorpe, Ga., and Lieutenant
Johnston at Perrin Field, Texas.
Captain Stone, class of 1939, en
tered the third training corps of the
WAC in August, 1942, and has been
at her present post since January of
this year. While at Stanford she
served as business manager of the
Quad. Her husband, Jim Stone, '38,
former editor of the Daily, is now a
staff sergeant at Camp White, Ore.
His father is Calvin Perry Stone,
Stanford professor of psychology.
Recruiting and administration is
the job of Lieutenant Johnston, class
of 1940. Lieutenant Johnston was
affiliated with the Alpha Omicron Pi
sorority, as is her sister, Marjorie
Pleasant, now attending Stanford.
