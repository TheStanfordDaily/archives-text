the Firehouse in an 18-12 thriller
yesterday afternoon. Yesterday's
games marked the sixth round of

The Fightin' Q.M. made their first
touchdown in the opening minutes
of play. The Firemen came back
with one of their own on a sneak
pass play, with Gene Smith going
over for the score. The Quarter
master men then proceeded to march
down the field on a series of short
passes for their second touchdown.
Smith returned the ensuing kickoff
for another six points for the Fire
house. and the score stood at 12-all.
The Q.M.'s passing attack finally
settled the issue, enabling them to
score their final touchdown and win,
18-12.

perfect record of the Stoates by
handing them an 18-16 beating in
another see-saw battle. Joe Scott,

and wont down to an 18-0 defeat.
Co. E, Team 2 snapped the Monroe

an 18-0 win. Monroe went down
fighting, but just couldn't cope with
the soldiers' passing combination of
Corky Caprin and Norm Gilchrist.

20-0 decision won by Dinah's. Mc-
Kin ley's League A Bashers kept in
