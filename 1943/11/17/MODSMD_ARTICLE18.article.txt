## Preliminary Tennis Matches Near End 
### 
"We would like to have the pre
liminary tennis matches played off
this weekend, so we can start playing
the second round by Sunday," stated
Janet Busse, president of the Tennis
Club, last night.
Most of the first-round matches
have been played off; the delay is
due largely to the fact that service
men on the teams can only play on
weekends.
