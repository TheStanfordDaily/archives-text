## 
### United Press 
ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS.—Under
sharp Nazi counterattacks, American
troops have fallen back from their
forward positions on Mount Croce
northwest of Venafro, it was an
nounced today, as bad weather over
the rest of the Italian front precluded
all but patrol activities.
(The German radio reported, how
ever, that a lively artillery duel had
developed on the western end of the
front.)
Tlie Germans had been counter
attacking repeatedly in the vital
Venafro sector where Lieut. Gen.
Mark W. Clark's Fifth Army threat
ened to turn the so-called German
winter defense line at the central
Appenine Mountains.
Realizing this danger, the enemy
launched two sharp counterblows
yesterday and during the second the
Americans withdrew a small dis
tance. It was emphasized they still
held most of their hard-won posi
tions above Venafro.
Aside from the Venafro fighting
the only other action reported was
a patrol clash near Montazzoli in the
center of the British Eighth Army
sector where Gen. Sir B. L. Mont
gomery's troops were stabbing into
the Sangro River line.
Except for the slight withdrawal in

I the Venafro salient, there was no
I change in the official battleline, al
though the Eighth Army occupied
high ground of local importance
north of Atessa. Patrols made several
more sorties across the Sangro.
