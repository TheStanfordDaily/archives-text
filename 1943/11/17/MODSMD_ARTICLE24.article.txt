### BILL ROSE 
BRIGHTEN THE CORNER ....
Those of you who are kicking at the lack of opportunities on
the campus to contribute materially to our national effort can
stop kicking and kick overâ€”to the tune of four semoleons.
That's a lot of money isn't it? It will buy seven tickets to the
Stanford Theater, 26 packs of cigarettes, or several drinks (the
amount depending on your preference).
It will also make things a little easier for someone your own
age who is having a rough time of it over where things can be
rough. It will aid some student whose education was cut short
by the war to continue his education. It might even help some
child to walk again.
The War Chest Drive is on now. The above-mentioned causes
are only a few of the many that your contributions to this drive
will benefit. Those of you who can spare more than four dollars
are asked to go above the standard donation. Every student is
requested to give at least four.
This will be the only war drive on the campus this year. Don't
wait for your living group representative to see you. You see
him! Let that new sweater or skirt go. I imagine there are plenty
of kids in the world who would give more than four dollars (if
they had it) for a slice of bread.

It's apology time again. This time Bull Session asks forgive
ness of that valiant vanguard of law students who are arduously
attempting to maintain the law steps tradition against what we
may call overwhelming odds. Keep it up, law students! That s
the spirit that democracies are made of.
Remark of the week was made by a freshman woman(?) at
Saturday's game. Speaking of one of the Stanford yell leaders,
she said: "He's so handsome it hurts." (Who says the Sinatra
Age hasn't hit the Farm?)

The people over in the Women's Gym must be anxious to
keep the majority of our civilian students out of their pool. They
have posted a sign there which reads, "Men over fourteen years
of age are not allowed to use the diving boards. If broken they
are irreplaceable."
