# Blossom Parke Directs Music In Stanford Gaieties Program
## 
### Ellon Marcus 
For the first time in history, a woman has been put in charge of musical
direction of a Stanford Gaieties. She is Blossom Parke, whose name
adorned many a piece of music beside the heading "lyrics and music" dur
ing both her high school years and her two years at the Farm.
Miss Parke contributed the tunes of six songs and the lyrics of four to

the musical score of the Gaieties."
One of her hit songs from last year's
show, "Love Plays the Strangest
Games," will also be featured by
request, with its composer singing it
and accompanying herself on the
piano.
Landalc To Sing
"Cabernet and Candlelight," a
sentimental ballad, will be sung by
Don Landale to the rhythm of a fox
trot, and then will be waltzed by
couples in an act arranged by Miss
Parke. Landale will also sing, ac
companied by Bev Richards, in an
other Parke special, "I Believe I
Belong."
Students who attended the rally
last Friday will remember Nan Till
son's novel interpretation of the
Gaieties' song "You Big Attractive
Man," with music and lyrics by
Parke.
Parke and Mieners
The finale of the show will feature
the most famous of all Stanford say
ings, 'See Ya on Quad." Miss Parke
collaborated on it with Janice Brad
bury Mieners, a former Stanford stu
dent, who wrote the hit song for the
'40 Gaieties, "Men Are Mean." Miss
Parke composed the music, and Miss
Mieners the words. This team also
worked together on the music for the
most spectacular act in the Gaieties,
"Pin-Up Girl."
Working under Miss Parke in the
musical direction of the show are
Dick Flint, who will lead the orches
tra, and Charles Reader, who is doing
the orchestrations.
Boogie Woogie
Claude Wilson, a graduate of the
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness, has also written two numbers
for the Gaieties. One is a boogie
woogie song entitled, "Ten Bucks and
24 Hours Leave"; the other, named
"Jerico," is also something for jazz
fans to rave over.
