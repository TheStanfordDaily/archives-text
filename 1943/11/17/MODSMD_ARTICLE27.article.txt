### 
THE MALE ANIMAL —now playing j
at the Varsity Theater.
Warner Brothers' "The Male Ani
mal" is a clever pre-war comedy
that features Olivia de Havilland,
Henry Fonda, and Joan Leslie.
Adapted from the stage success of the j
same name, the film has a college j
background with the usual number i
of complications that seem to infest
campus life.
Henry Fonda is seen as an easy go
ing professor who comes to blows
with school authorities when it is re
ported that he is to read to his Eng- !
lish class a selection having to do ;
with communism. And Fonda's wife, !
Olivia de Havilland, is having quite j
a fling with ex-football star Jack j
Carson. Fonda and Carson finally !
settle their differences via the manly '
art of self defense and, in doing so,
Fonda wins back the affections of
his wife.
Stanford Hit
The second half of the double bill
features comedienne Rosalind Rus
sell and handsome Walter Pidgeon in
an enticing little number called "De
sign for Scandal." Miss Russell por
trays a woman judge and Pidgeon is j
an artist. The picture leans heavily !
on tongue-in-cheek humor and
therefore should make a big hit with
all Stanford students.
Sex is sex the world around but !
in yesterday's article this reviewer
mentioned Paulette Goddard as play
ing opposite Bob Hope in "They Got
Me Covered." The little lady in the
film was not Miss Goddurd. but none
other than Dorothy Lamour. Yours
truly should have had his glasses on
when he saw the picture—or maybe
he should have seen the picture in
the first place.—Bower
