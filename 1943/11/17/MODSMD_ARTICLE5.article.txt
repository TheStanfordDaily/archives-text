# Facts About 'Pan-Hell Plan'
## AN EDITORIAL 
### 
In yesterday's Daily there appeared a story
describing the "Hall's answer to the Panhellenic
proposal to solve the sorority problem." Un
fortunately the halls who had opposing state
ments signed in housemeetings Monday night
were misled. Panhellenic has completed no
such plan as the hall leaders have described.
Although The Daily gave a full report
of the proceedings at the meeting, it does
not vouch for the authenticity of these state
ments. The Daily has tried, and will so
continue, to remain impartial in this con
troversy. And since yesterday's story omit
ted Panhellenic's side, we feel it necessary
to clarify the immediate situation to our
readers.
Since the challenge of Roble sponsors last
winter that sororities improve their system or
abolish themselves, Panhellenic has attempted
to devise plans which will satisfy all the women
on the campus. Panhellenic is fully cognizant
of the faults of the sorority system as it now
stands.
However, attempts at having both Row and
Hall women work on the same investigating
committees failed. A proposal present the
problem last summer when both groups of
women were living together was denied. No
spirit of cooperation could be maintained on
either side.
This fall Panhellenic continued to work on
plans which might improve the contested situ
ation. The revised contact rules, reducing arti
ficial barriers between sorority and new women,
and the informal rushing rules are examples of
this. But to get at the heart of the problem, sev
eral solutions were drawn up from the work of
both last year's Panhellenic council and this
year's. No solutions were to be considered as
final plans to submit to the committee of the

Board of Trustees until they had met with the
absolute approval of all sorority members.
The plans which the halls attacked in
Monday night's meeting previously did
not meet with the unanimous approval of
the sororities. Also since the attacked plans
were based on spoken and not written word,
they did not represent accurately the plans
the sororities were considering.
At a joint meeting of Panhellenic and house
presidents held last Sunday night, the following
resolution was, in spirit, unanimously adopted,
with the consideration that Panhellenic was,
nevertheless, willing to continue working now
on proposed plans for reconstruction of the
program:
"In the last year the entire Stanford program has
been geared to a war-time scale. Every student is put
ting forth a maximum effort in studies, war-work, and
school activities. Correlating the industrial reorgani
zation of our country at war. Stanford, too, has dis
pensed with "non-essentials" such as Rally Committee,
big name hands, and football. The time formerly spent
in these playtime activities has been reallocated to
War Board work. Red Cross. Nurse's Aide, and indus
trial work. At the same time most students have ac
celerated their school programs to graduate early. In
short, every Stanford student is doing a big job.
"In the face of this schedule, Panhellenic unanimously
feels that the sorority problem is diminutive, inoppor
tune. and insignificant. The advantage of one living
group over another appears a ridiculous matter beside
the many ways we can help win the war. We feel there
is a definite and important problem in reconstructing
the sorority program, but is war-time the proper time
to give it adequate consideration and significance?
"Panhellenic suggests that this problem be post
poned until the war is over, at which time everyone
can have a true appreciation of its significance and its
import on the future of Stanford and will desire to
devote concentrated attention to it
". . . . In the meantime, we feel that any split among
the students is to be avoided at all costs as direct op
position to the war effort. We feel the most valuable
thing we can do is strive for unity within the Univer
sity when it cannot be found without. We would like
to .concentrate now on learning th'is important lesson
at home."

on the campus. Panhellenic is fully cognizant
of the faults of the sorority system as it now
stands.
However, attempts at having both Row and
Hall women work on the same investigating
committees failed. A proposal present the
problem last summer when both groups of
women were living together was denied. No
spirit of cooperation could be maintained on
either side.
This fall Panhellenic continued to work on
plans which might improve the contested situ
ation. The revised contact rules, reducing arti
ficial barriers between sorority and new women,
and the informal rushing rules are examples of
this. But to get at the heart of the problem, sev
eral solutions were drawn up from the work of
both last year's Panhellenic council and this
year's. No solutions were to be considered as
final plans to submit to the committee of the

Board of Trustees until they had met with the
absolute approval of all sorority members.
The plans which the halls attacked in
Monday night's meeting previously did
not meet with the unanimous approval of
the sororities. Also since the attacked plans
were based on spoken and not written word,
they did not represent accurately the plans
the sororities were considering.
At a joint meeting of Panhellenic and house
presidents held last Sunday night, the following
resolution was, in spirit, unanimously adopted,
with the consideration that Panhellenic was,
nevertheless, willing to continue working now
on proposed plans for reconstruction of the
program:
"In the last year the entire Stanford program has
been geared to a war-time scale. Every student is put
ting forth a maximum effort in studies, war-work, and
school activities. Correlating the industrial reorgani
zation of our country at war. Stanford, too, has dis
pensed with "non-essentials" such as Rally Committee,
big name hands, and football. The time formerly spent
in these playtime activities has been reallocated to
War Board work. Red Cross. Nurse's Aide, and indus
trial work. At the same time most students have ac
celerated their school programs to graduate early. In
short, every Stanford student is doing a big job.
"In the face of this schedule, Panhellenic unanimously
feels that the sorority problem is diminutive, inoppor
tune. and insignificant. The advantage of one living
group over another appears a ridiculous matter beside
the many ways we can help win the war. We feel there
is a definite and important problem in reconstructing
the sorority program, but is war-time the proper time
to give it adequate consideration and significance?
"Panhellenic suggests that this problem be post
poned until the war is over, at which time everyone
can have a true appreciation of its significance and its
import on the future of Stanford and will desire to
devote concentrated attention to it
". . . . In the meantime, we feel that any split among
the students is to be avoided at all costs as direct op
position to the war effort. We feel the most valuable
thing we can do is strive for unity within the Univer
sity when it cannot be found without. We would like
to .concentrate now on learning th'is important lesson
at home."
In yesterday's Daily there appeared a story
describing the "Hall's answer to the Panhellenic
proposal to solve the sorority problem." Un
fortunately the halls who had opposing state
ments signed in housemeetings Monday night
were misled. Panhellenic has completed no
such plan as the hall leaders have described.
Although The Daily gave a full report
of the proceedings at the meeting, it does
not vouch for the authenticity of these state
ments. The Daily has tried, and will so
continue, to remain impartial in this con
troversy. And since yesterday's story omit

absolute approval of all sorority members.
The plans which the halls attacked in
Monday night's meeting previously did
not meet with the unanimous approval of
the sororities. Also since the attacked plans
were based on spoken and not written word,
they did not represent accurately the plans
the sororities were considering.
At a joint meeting of Panhellenic and house
presidents held last Sunday night, the following
resolution was, in spirit, unanimously adopted,
with the consideration that Panhellenic was,
nevertheless, willing to continue working now
on proposed plans for reconstruction of the
program:
"In the last year the entire Stanford program has
been geared to a war-time scale. Every student is put
ting forth a maximum effort in studies, war-work, and
school activities. Correlating the industrial reorgani
zation of our country at war. Stanford, too, has dis
pensed with "non-essentials" such as Rally Committee,
big name hands, and football. The time formerly spent
in these playtime activities has been reallocated to
War Board work. Red Cross. Nurse's Aide, and indus
trial work. At the same time most students have ac
celerated their school programs to graduate early. In
short, every Stanford student is doing a big job.
"In the face of this schedule, Panhellenic unanimously
feels that the sorority problem is diminutive, inoppor
tune. and insignificant. The advantage of one living
group over another appears a ridiculous matter beside
the many ways we can help win the war. We feel there
is a definite and important problem in reconstructing
the sorority program, but is war-time the proper time
to give it adequate consideration and significance?
"Panhellenic suggests that this problem be post
poned until the war is over, at which time everyone
can have a true appreciation of its significance and its
import on the future of Stanford and will desire to
devote concentrated attention to it
". . . . In the meantime, we feel that any split among
the students is to be avoided at all costs as direct op
position to the war effort. We feel the most valuable
thing we can do is strive for unity within the Univer
sity when it cannot be found without. We would like
to .concentrate now on learning th'is important lesson
at home."
