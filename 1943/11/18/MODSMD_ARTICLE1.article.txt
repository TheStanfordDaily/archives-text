# WAR CHEST
## Drive Begins Fourth Day 
### 
The third successful day of the
student's War Chest Drive brought in
more cash contributions and pledges
that will be paid on Dec. 10, accord
ing to Chic Brubaker, chairman of
the War Chest committee.
"Still we are far from our goal of
four dollars per civilian student, so
give now â€”this is the only war drive
of the year, and the need is urgent,"
Brubaker said.
This' War Chest Drive is the first of
its kind and incorporates four im
portant relief federations: National
War Fund, whose aim it is to help
win the war sooner, with a minimum
loss of life, by sustaining war vic
tims around the world with the kind
of help that gives them the will to
win; World Student Service Fund, a
channel through which American
students send relief to their fellow
students who are victims of war in
all parts of the world; Dimes for Di
plomas, providing after - the - war
scholarships to Stanford men who
were drafted or enlisted before
graduation; and the Infantile Paral
ysis Fund that President Roosevelt
established for aid to children
stricken with the same disease that
he was inflicted with in his youth.
Drive Ends Monday
The War Chest Drive will termi
nate on campus next Monday, when
all solicitors will turn in their re
ports of contributions or pledges to
either Cally Curtis or Dick Bartle,
who are in charge of women's and
men's collections, respectively.
The War Board office today sent
out War Chest Drive contribution
cards to all students who do not live
in University residences or sororities.
Army Contributes
Army students on campus are con
tributing to the drive, if they wish,
through representatives in each of
the companies.
Thirty per cent of the total sum
received from Stanford students will
be presented to Frank Walker, who
is the general chairman of the Palo
Alto-Stanford War Chest Drive. He
will contribute this amount, with that
which is collected from Palo Alto
residents, to the National War Fund.
Two solicitors whose names were
omitted in Tuesday's list are Barbara
Bernard in Casa Ventura and Margie
Dorris in Casita.
