# Red Cross Sponsors War Work Sewing
## 
### 
Tuesday was the only day this
week that the Red Cross surgical
dressing quota of 1,000 was filled.
This decline is probably due to mid
quarter exams, but girls are remind
ed that they should work each week
at the same time or provide a substi
tute.
'Monday 45 4x4 and 788 2x2 dress
ings were made, on Tuesday 210 4x4
and 819 2x2, and on Wednesday GOO
dressings.
The Red Cross has organized a
sewing room. This room will be
located in the same place as the
surgical dressing room and will be
open Friday from 10 to 4.
Volunteers for sewing will do ma
chine and hand work making gar
ments for refugees and soldiers.
Quilts also will be made. This sew
ing will count as war work, and all
volunteers will be appreciated.
