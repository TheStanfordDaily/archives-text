"The Stanford girls are wonderful,"
said Miss Marion Theobald, head of
the Palo Alto Girl Scouts, as she gave
whole-hearted praise to the efforts of
the Stanford women who are assist
ing in the leadership of Girl Scout
troops throughout the city.
Seventy-five girls from Stanford
have entered this service group,
which is receiving training in leader
ship, camp counseling, and other
types of social service work. These
girls are from all over the campus,
coming from different classes and
living groups.
Troop Leaders
At present the Stanford girls are in
two general groups as assistant lead
ers of scout troops or as program
specialists. Program specialists have
a large field of activity ranging from
singing and folk dancing to handi
craft work. The work of troop lead
ers varies with the work of then
particular group and includes mak
ing service posters, dressing dolls
for charity, and assisting at the Con
valescent Home.
A new project of the Girl Scouts
is Saturday morning care for chil
dren of working mothers. The Stan

lord girls are assisting in its or

to be held at the day-camp on the
campus under the direction of a
trained recreational worker, Mrs.
Margaret Barr, assistant professor of
physical education for women at
Stanford.
War Work
The Stanford students are enthu
siastic about their Girl Scout work
which is considered regular war
work by the War Board. One of the
members of the group commented
that for those who plan on careers of
social service work, it is yn ideal
war-time activity.
The Girl Scout leaders of Palo Alto
consider the arrangement as favor
able as do the Stanford workers. Miss
Theobald explained that as the Girl
Scouts are the only girl's service
group maintained in the Palo Alto
area, they are called upon for as
sistance in many fields.
