## MURAL FOOTBALL League-Leading Fightin' Q.M.'s Favorites to Take Fillmore 
### Roger Corman 
The two extremes meet in the seventh round of the intra-mural football
league today, when unbeaten FigJitin' Q.M. comes up against Fillmore
Hall, who has yet to win a game. The soldiers figure to make this seven in
a row without much trouble.
Knocked off their league-leading perch Tuesday by the Fightin' Q.M.,

the Firehouse should bounce back"*
into the win column today at the ex- 1
pense of The Stoates. The Stoates
has looked pretty good, but was up
set by Tyler in the last start, and
will probably see defeat again this
afternoon.
The high-riding McKinley A team
is rated as one of the few good ci
vilian squads in action, and should
take Veritas A.C. with ease,
Navy Faces Monroe
Navy shouldn't have much trouble
in outscoring the Monroe "A"' team.
Monroe has looked good in spots, but
the powerful and speedy Navy back
field should prove too much for the
civilians.

Upsetting the dope bucket Tues
day by nosing out The Stoates, Tyler
is on the victory path, and should
have an easy time against the Theta
Hashers.
Other League A games pit Dinah's
against Adams and Co. D against
Gerona A.C.
C'. & A. Favored
At the head of the League B sched- I
vile, Co. C. & A. takes on the potent
Walter Thompson Co-op. Co. C. & A.
is tied for the league lead, a place
the Co-op held until a little while
ago. Thompson started off like a J
whirlwind, but has bogged down in !
the past few games, and shouldn't be
able to do much better than give the j
soldiers a good fight.
Co. E, Team 1 meets the smooth- j
working Buchanan squad in the ;
other feature game of League B. Tied
with Co. C. & A. for the loop lead. :
Co. E rates as the heavy favorite to j
take this one.
The Monroe "B" team, which has
been terrific in places, and not so j
terrific in others, has its last chance
to stay in the running for the title j
by beating Co. D, Team 1.

Upsetting the dope bucket Tues
day by nosing out The Stoates, Tyler
is on the victory path, and should
have an easy time against the Theta
Hashers.
Other League A games pit Dinah's
against Adams and Co. D against
Gerona A.C.
C'. & A. Favored
At the head of the League B sched- I
vile, Co. C. & A. takes on the potent
Walter Thompson Co-op. Co. C. & A.
is tied for the league lead, a place
the Co-op held until a little while
ago. Thompson started off like a J
whirlwind, but has bogged down in !
the past few games, and shouldn't be
able to do much better than give the j
soldiers a good fight.
Co. E, Team 1 meets the smooth- j
working Buchanan squad in the ;
other feature game of League B. Tied
with Co. C. & A. for the loop lead. :
Co. E rates as the heavy favorite to j
take this one.
The Monroe "B" team, which has
been terrific in places, and not so j
terrific in others, has its last chance
to stay in the running for the title j
by beating Co. D, Team 1.
The two extremes meet in the seventh round of the intra-mural football
league today, when unbeaten FigJitin' Q.M. comes up against Fillmore
Hall, who has yet to win a game. The soldiers figure to make this seven in
a row without much trouble.
Knocked off their league-leading perch Tuesday by the Fightin' Q.M.,

the Firehouse should bounce back"*
into the win column today at the ex- 1
pense of The Stoates. The Stoates
has looked pretty good, but was up
set by Tyler in the last start, and
will probably see defeat again this
afternoon.
The high-riding McKinley A team
is rated as one of the few good ci
vilian squads in action, and should
take Veritas A.C. with ease,
Navy Faces Monroe
Navy shouldn't have much trouble
in outscoring the Monroe "A"' team.
Monroe has looked good in spots, but
the powerful and speedy Navy back
field should prove too much for the
civilians.
