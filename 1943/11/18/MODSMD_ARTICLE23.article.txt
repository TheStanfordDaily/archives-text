# Women's Volleyball Teams Improving
## 
### 
Wednesday's women's intra-mural 112
volleyball games were all fast- !
moving and well matched. Lagunita
vs. Ever Ready played a tense game,
Lagunita winning two out of three
games, 17-15, 6-15, 15-9.
This was Lagunita's second game
of the series, and Sylvia Lisberger,
intramural official, commented on
their noticeable teamwork improve
ment.
