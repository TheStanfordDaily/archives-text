# Arthur Takes Volleyball Win
## 
### 
Tonight's volleyball turnout was
very poor in view of the fact that
three teams won by default. In the
7:15 games Arthur Hall won from
Fillmore two games out of three. In
the first game Arthur trampled Fill
more 15-5, and lost 6-15 in a very
sloppy second game. In the stiff final
game the Arthur boys nosed out their
opponents 15-11. A McKinley team
won by default from the Theta
Hashers.
In the 8:15 games Tyler won from
Co. E which failed to show up. Co.
L, F.A. won from irregular and un
predictable Hayes Hall by default.
Since both Tyler and Co. L, F.A. had
no opponents they agreed to play off
their games which had been sched
uled last Monday. From the begin
ning the army completely outclassed
Tyler, winning the opener 15-1. Co.
L slackened its pace and won 15-4
in the second.
Thursday Nov. 18 â€”7:15: Dinah's
vs. Garfield and McKinley vs. Bu
chanan. 8:15: Monroe vs. Washing
ton, Tyler vs. bye, and Fillmore vs.
Theta Hashers.
