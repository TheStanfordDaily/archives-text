# Three Soccer Games Planned
## 
### 
Soccer on this campus is really
getting into full swing this weekend
with the playing of three games.
Friday the Encina Engineers will
meet the Stanford Reserve soccer
team on the Intramural Field at 4:30.
Saturday at 1 p.m. the Co. K and
Roosevelt Hall squads will play a
practice game as will Co. L and
Pierce Hall Co. I. These games are
not part of the newly formed soccer
league play.
The Co. L team signed up under
the management of Tommy Trent
only yesterday, bringing the total
number of squads to sixâ€”the Stan
ford Varsity, three Co. I teams, Co.
K team, and the Co. L one. Accord
ing to Pfc. Otto Brand, organizer of
the league, the sign-up period would
probably be closed this week or at
least as soon as a few more teams
contact either him or Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports. Teams plan
ning to enter the league are urged to
notify one of these men as soon as
possible since, when the league is
completed, a meeting of team repre
sentatives will be held to unify rules
and get play underway.
