# FOLLOW YOUR PROFESSOR
## 
### 
A STANFORD professor went to Motley's for a cup of coffee
a few mornings ago. Just as he was drinking his last gulp, a
waitress locked the door and hung up a sign which stated that
Motley's must remain closed for an hour in order to get ready
for the noon rush.
Then the lone waitress began to clean up, carrying dirty
dishes into the kitchen. At the same time the Stanford professor
got up. He walked over to a trayload of dirty dishes and carried
them into the kitchen —and he repeated this procedure with two
other trays.
By that time the waitress was staring at him, wide-eyed, and
so he walked out, tossing over his shoulder, "It's war, you know."
No one knows who he is, but it's certain the Cellar hashers
would like to know. Because maybe he could shame persons
into reading the signs posted in the Cellar: "Please deposit dirty
dishes in the tray."—lrma Cunha
