# Lil' Indian To Frolic At Company E Dance
## 
### Pfc. Al Schall 
Although the Lil' Injun's Big Red Machine is retired for the duration
due to the lack of replacement parts, the mighty sprite is still able to in
dulge in a bit of escapism. (See picture above.) At least that's what he'll
be doing at the "Indian Summer" dance at 9 p.m. Saturday at the Pavilion.
However, let's not be beguiled by the street attire of his coed dancing
partner. The dance, to be given by E Company, ASTU 3905, is to be semi
formal, the first dance of the quarter at which Stanford women may make
their appearance in evening gowns.
A variety program will be presented during intermission. Pfc. Bert Hill,
a former member of the late Ben Bernie's orchestra, headlines the program.
Music for the dance will be furnished by a 10-piece orchestra under the
direction of Larry Goss.
