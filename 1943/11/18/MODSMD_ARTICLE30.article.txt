### BILL ROSE 
MAKE MINE THE SAME
I was sort of hungry the other day, so I stopped by the Cellar
for a 301 (mocha shake to you). I used to drink 101's (choc shake);
but once somebody dared me to order a 301, and—in the rut
that I am—l've been ordering them ever since.
As I took a seat at the counter facing the coffee urn (my
favorite spot), a smiling waitress confronted me. "What'll it
be?" she asked.
"301," I said, hoping she'd have to refer to a menu to see
what it was. But she didn't; for she was a very exceptional wait
ress—as you shall see.
"Squared or round or squared and round?" she came back.
"Just plain."
"Whoever heard of a plain 301?"
I was a little embarrassed, but I overcame my pride and asked
the inevitable "What's the difference?"
"Plenty. Squared has an egg in it. Round has mocha ice
cream."
"And squared and round?" I queried.
"An egg and mocha ice cream."
I was impressed. "0.K., you win," I said. "Make it round."
She smiled contentedly and called to a little boy up at the
end, "301 round."
"No mocha ice cream!" The retort came back fast and sharp.
Now it was my turn to smile. "How about a plain one then?"
I wheezed.
"Sure you don't want it squared?"
"No, I don't want it squared."
"How about the square root of a 301 squared?" (I told you
this was an exceptional waitress.)
"And what may that be?"
"That's a 301 with an egg in it without the egg in it."
"Listen," I said. "Let's forget it. Just give me a fresh lemon
coke."
"Large or small?"
"Large!"
"No fresh lemon." She was still smiling, believe it or not.
"O.K. Make a plain coke."
"No coke."
"How about a peanut butter sandwich?" I asked weakly.
"Peanut butter and jelly san!" she called out.
"But I don't want jelly." I was getting mad now.
"Whoever heard of a peanut butter san without jelly?"
That's all I can remember. I am now in the rest home suffer
iound dead in the coffee urn in the Cellar. They tell me there was
foun dead in the coffee urn in the Cellar. They tell me there was
a faint smile on her lips when they pulled her out.

"And what may that be?"
"That's a 301 with an egg in it without the egg in it."
"Listen," I said. "Let's forget it. Just give me a fresh lemon
coke."
"Large or small?"
"Large!"
"No fresh lemon." She was still smiling, believe it or not.
"O.K. Make a plain coke."
"No coke."
"How about a peanut butter sandwich?" I asked weakly.
"Peanut butter and jelly san!" she called out.
"But I don't want jelly." I was getting mad now.
"Whoever heard of a peanut butter san without jelly?"
That's all I can remember. I am now in the rest home suffer
iound dead in the coffee urn in the Cellar. They tell me there was
foun dead in the coffee urn in the Cellar. They tell me there was
a faint smile on her lips when they pulled her out.
MAKE MINE THE SAME
I was sort of hungry the other day, so I stopped by the Cellar
for a 301 (mocha shake to you). I used to drink 101's (choc shake);
but once somebody dared me to order a 301, and—in the rut
that I am—l've been ordering them ever since.
As I took a seat at the counter facing the coffee urn (my
favorite spot), a smiling waitress confronted me. "What'll it
be?" she asked.
"301," I said, hoping she'd have to refer to a menu to see
what it was. But she didn't; for she was a very exceptional wait
ress—as you shall see.
"Squared or round or squared and round?" she came back.
"Just plain."
"Whoever heard of a plain 301?"
I was a little embarrassed, but I overcame my pride and asked
the inevitable "What's the difference?"
"Plenty. Squared has an egg in it. Round has mocha ice
cream."
"And squared and round?" I queried.
"An egg and mocha ice cream."
I was impressed. "0.K., you win," I said. "Make it round."
She smiled contentedly and called to a little boy up at the
end, "301 round."
"No mocha ice cream!" The retort came back fast and sharp.
Now it was my turn to smile. "How about a plain one then?"
I wheezed.
"Sure you don't want it squared?"
"No, I don't want it squared."
"How about the square root of a 301 squared?" (I told you
this was an exceptional waitress.)
"And what may that be?"
"That's a 301 with an egg in it without the egg in it."
"Listen," I said. "Let's forget it. Just give me a fresh lemon
