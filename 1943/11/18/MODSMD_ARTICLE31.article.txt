The impact of global war that con
fronts American education has re
sulted in a hectic adaptation to a
world at war. Many temporary
changes of an inconvenient nature
have been thrust upon American
educational institutions and some
great progressive changes have also
been precipitated that will hereafter
be a permanent element of American
education.
The Department of Geography in
the School of Humanities is one of
the latter. When it started July 1,
Stanford surrendered its position as
one of the last important colleges in
the country without a geography
division.
Human Aspect
Stanford's geography department
is headed by Professor C. Langdon
White from Western Reserve Uni
versity. He states that the depart
ment instruction will place emphasis
upon human aspects of geography
such as determine peoples' economic,
political, and social destinies and not
only form the basis for wars like the
present one, but give the under
standing necessary for world co
operation in the future.
Holbrook Bonney and Joseph E.
Williams are giving courses in the
department. Mr. Williams, a car
tographer, is at present working on
a series of maps that are very much
needed. The next to be published by
the Stanford University Press will
be the world from the North Polar
regions in equi-distant area.
AST Instruction
Instruction is now being given to
over a thousand basic engineers,
foreign language and area majors,
and members of the Civilian Affairs
Training School.
Plans are now being considered to
open at least one course to civilian
students Winter Quarter. The sub
ject seems well entrenched at Stan
ford after only this short time, and
what a leading exponent, J. Russell
Smith, calls "the most civilizing sub
ject of all" is a part of the Stanford
curricula at last.
