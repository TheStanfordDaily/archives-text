## 
### 
Every student who expects to
graduate before next Autumn Quar
ter is urged to make arrangements
immediately for his picture for the
1944 Quad. Nan McLaren, Quad edi
tor, announced: '"The pictures must
be taken in November and appoint
ments made accordingly. I'd like to
remind everyone that appointments
have to be made in person at the
Quad Studio between 1 and 4 any
afternoon."
The photographer is the Nicholas-
Johnson Studio, located next to Roos
Bros, in Palo Alto; the cost is $1.50.
Unless all seniors cooperate and
make appointments now, the pic
tures will pile up and result in end
less confusion. Therefore, the ab
solute deadline has been set for Dec.
1, as announced in yesterdav's Daily.
