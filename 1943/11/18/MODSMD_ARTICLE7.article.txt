LONDON. Nov. 17.—Moscow acknowledged tonight the Red Army, in
the first reported retreat since the start of its smashing offensive last July,

had abandoned several inhabited
places in the Zhitomir area under
pressure of German attacks.
The Soviet communique reported
that the First Ukraine Army had
abandoned several places "in the
area of Zhitomir and Korostishev,"
but it told of continuing Russian suc
cesses on other fronts.
Gen. Markian M. Popov's Soviet
forces were reported fighting "in
the western approaches" of Rechitsa,
southernmost of Germany's four
great bases in White Russia. North
of Gomel, Popov's forces enlarged
their bridgehead positions on the
west bank of the Sozh river, inching
their way toward the gates of the
city.
More than 30 towns and villages
were taken in the drive on Koresten,
north of Zhitomir, and its companion
junction of Ovruch, 25 miles above
Koresten.
The latest Soviet gains placed first
army vanguards five miles east of
Koresten and 12 miles southeast of
Ovruch.
