ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS, Nov. 17.
â€”Striking along a 1,000-mile aerial
front in Southern Europe, powerful
American bomber formations ripped
Nazi airfields near Marseilles and
Athens Tuesday while mud-bound
Allied armies in Italy hammered out
slight gains in their laborious march
on Rome, it was announced today.
Flying Fortresses celebrated a
year of operation in the Mediteran
nean by blasting the big Istres le
Tube airdrome northwest of Mar
seilles, and Marauders rained frag
mentation and explosive bombs on
nearby Salon. A second strong fronce
of medium bombers carried out a si
multaneous attack Tuesday on the
Elusis airfield just outside Athens.
