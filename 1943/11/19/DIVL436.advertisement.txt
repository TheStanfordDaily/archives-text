If you're forever getting out the needle and thread,
here are some tips:
When a button comes off, sew it on well the
first time. A slip-shod job just means you'll have
to do it over again soon.
Make your next shirt an Arrow. Arrow but
tons are attached with a patented stitch, which
"anchors" them to a shirt.
Check your size—you may he wearing too small
a shirt and therefore causing too great a strain
on the buttons and seams. The Sanforized label
in an Arrow shirt guarantees shrinkage no greater
than I%—no danger of an Arrow ever getting
too small!
