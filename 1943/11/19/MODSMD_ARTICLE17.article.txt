# Abrams To Plan Post-War Relief
## 
### 
Mr. Irwin Abrams, instructor of j
history, will leave soon to join the
staff of the American Friends Serv
ice Committee in Philadelphia to
help plan its post-war relief and re
construction program.
This committee represents the So
ciety of Friends (Quakers) in its
relief work in this country and
abroad, and it has been one of the
most important of the private agen
cies engaged in such activities. Dur
ing the last war American Quakers
helped rebuild devastated villages in
northern France, and after the war
they undertook large-scale relief op
erations in central and eastern Eu
rope, including the feeding of over
one million German children a day.
In their work the Friends have al
ways sought to administer to human
needs, entirely apart from any poli
tical or any other qualifying con
siderations. Thus, Quakers fed chil
dren on both sides during the Span
ish Civil War, and they were per
mitted by the Germans to continue
their feeding of school children in
France even after the German occu
pation and until the entry of the
United States into the war. Today
the Quakers are carrying on relief
operations in England, Portugal,
Spain, North Africa, and China, and
the scope of the work is to be en
larged.
Mr. Abrams' part in this program |
will be to engage in research and j
planning for the foreign service op- !
orations, as well as to help advise on I
the training of personnel for this
work. This will involve consultation
with the new Office of Foreign Eco
nomic Administration and the United
Nations Relief Administration.
Mr. Abrams feels that this will be
a great opportunity, not only to help
bring relief to the victims of the war,
but to take a more direct part in
helping build the peace.
