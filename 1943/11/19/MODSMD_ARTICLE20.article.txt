# Grable Musical Is Gay, Giddy Movie
## 
### 
SWEET ROSIE O'GRADY — Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Betty Grable, legs and all, is back
again to give the bald-head brigade
and everyone else a big thrill in
'Sweet Rosie O'Grady." It's another
of Twentieth-Century Fox's gay,
giddy technicolor musicals that have
proved their drawing power on many
previous occasions.
Miss Grable is seen as a former
Brooklyn burlesque queen who goes
snooty when she becomes a London
and New York stage favorite. Robert
Young, a reporter for that famous
pink sheet, the Police Gazette, insists
upon exposing Miss Grable's bur
lesque days. Eventually he does but
in the meantime Miss Grable has
made a laughing stock out of him by

spreading the rumor that they are to
be married. Finally thoy realize that
marriage would be the thing and
Betty's former sweetheart, Reginald
Gardner, goes over the boards. .
The outstanding songs in the pic
ture are the title number, "Sweet
Rosie O'Grady," and the new tune by
Mack Gordon and Harry Warren,
"My Heart Tells Me." Miss Grable
sings both in her best manner and in
doing so demonstrates once again
that she's got the right things in the
right places.
The second feature is an excellent
documentary film that relates the
heroic struggle of the Soviet Union
in this war. It's called "Battle ot
Russia" and, although rather long,
is an absorbing and interesting pic
ture.—Bower
