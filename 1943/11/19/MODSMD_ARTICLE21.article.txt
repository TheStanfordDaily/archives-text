# Professor Hanna Completes Triology of Social Textbooks
## 
### 
'A triology of social textbooks for grade-school children from the fifth to
seventh grades has just been completed by Professor Paul R. Hanna of the
School of Education.
The general theme of this triology is to show man's use of resources, his
methods of producing goods in a factory economy, and the ways in which

goods are distributed from the pro
ducer to the consumer. In the first
book, "This Useful World," Pro
fessor Hanna shows how various
peoples have used resources from the
time of primitive man to the ultimate
development of the factory system. .
Factory System
The second book, "Making the
Goods We Need," deals with our
present factory system, showing how
man has learned to use machines and
power, and how factories are or
ganized and operated. "Marketing
the Things We Use'' is concerned
with the problems of distributing
goods and shows the interdependence
of all peoples in our "economic
world."
The series was begun in 1935 by
Professor Hanna, who is general edi
tor in the elementary school field.
He was aided by Mr. 1. James Quil
len, associate professor of the School
of Education, who participated in
co-authorship of the books. Mr.
Quillen is general editor in*the sec
ondary school field, and he and Pro
fessor Hanna are now collaborating
on a new series of books for the
seventh to ninth grades.
World Triology
This series, consisting of a world
geography, a text concerning the
world geography, a text concerning
the power of invention in American
union, and a final volume dealing
with living in communities, will
bring together the triology in terms
of the entire world, the United States,
and the local community.
In a recent issue of Time Maga
zine, Professor Hanna has been
called Stanford's ambassador to the
U.S. government. He is now in
Washington, D.C. as director of Uni
versity services. His major responsi
bility is the relation between the
Stanford War Program, reputed to be
the largest in the U.S. for the spe
cialized training of soldiers, and the
national government.

'A triology of social textbooks for grade-school children from the fifth to
seventh grades has just been completed by Professor Paul R. Hanna of the
School of Education.
The general theme of this triology is to show man's use of resources, his
methods of producing goods in a factory economy, and the ways in which

goods are distributed from the pro
ducer to the consumer. In the first
book, "This Useful World," Pro
fessor Hanna shows how various
peoples have used resources from the
time of primitive man to the ultimate
development of the factory system. .
Factory System
The second book, "Making the
Goods We Need," deals with our
present factory system, showing how
man has learned to use machines and
power, and how factories are or
ganized and operated. "Marketing
the Things We Use'' is concerned
with the problems of distributing
goods and shows the interdependence
of all peoples in our "economic
world."
The series was begun in 1935 by
Professor Hanna, who is general edi
tor in the elementary school field.
He was aided by Mr. 1. James Quil
len, associate professor of the School
of Education, who participated in
co-authorship of the books. Mr.
Quillen is general editor in*the sec
ondary school field, and he and Pro
fessor Hanna are now collaborating
on a new series of books for the
seventh to ninth grades.
World Triology
This series, consisting of a world
geography, a text concerning the
world geography, a text concerning
the power of invention in American
union, and a final volume dealing
with living in communities, will
bring together the triology in terms
of the entire world, the United States,
and the local community.
In a recent issue of Time Maga
zine, Professor Hanna has been
called Stanford's ambassador to the
U.S. government. He is now in
Washington, D.C. as director of Uni
versity services. His major responsi
bility is the relation between the
Stanford War Program, reputed to be
the largest in the U.S. for the spe
cialized training of soldiers, and the
national government.
