# Cop Coupe Dons New War Color
## 
### 
If red means caution, maroon
means more caution as far as you're
concerned, because the Stanford Po
lice Department is performing its
duties in the interest of campus
safety in a new (at least as new as
possible) 1942 maroon Chevrolet
coupe.
The little black and white Ford
that produced a conditioned reflex
to "watch one's step" was replaced
Sept. 1. The department still has one
of its noted black cars with the silver
stars.
The change came, of course, be
cause of the war-time restrictions on
automobile production which curtail
even painting of newly purchased
cars. Police Chief Gordon Davis said
the car has caused considerable
comment on the campus. However,
there is little chance of confusing it
with the fire department, except as
wishful thinking.
24-llour Patrol
The new car will take up its share
of the regular 24 hours a day, seven
days a week patrol that the force
maintains. It is equipped with a two
way radio hookup which places it
readily at the call of the Palo Alto
Police Department in any emergency.
It is hoped that its sturdy color will
stand for sturdy wear because the
new patrol car will probably have to
be for "the duration," according to
Chief Davis. Its duties are somewhat
lighter than they might have been a
year or two ago when the number of
automobiles on campus was double
what it is now. However, it will be
on the alert for increased bicycle and
pedestrian hazards.
