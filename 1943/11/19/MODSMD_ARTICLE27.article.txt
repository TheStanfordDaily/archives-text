# War Chest Drive Hits New High; Halls Pledge 100%
## 
### 
Another day of the students' War Chest Drive brings the total sum
contributed in cash and pledges to $1,366.10. This is a surprising figure con
sidering the number of solicitors that have reported, and it proves Stanford's
whole-hearted cooperation in this phase of our war effort.
Alpha Phi has equalled Gamma Phi and D.G. by supporting the War
Chest Drive 100 per cent. Lincoln Hall proved itself to be superior among
the men's halls when its solicitor, Garwin Barry, handed 100 per cent con
tributions to Janet Hale, financial head of the War Chest Committee.
When Corridor 1A and 3B came through 100 per cent yesterday, Ewell
Sale, sub-chairman at Roble, said, "We expect Roble to go 100 per cent by
Friday night."
Casita joined the 100 per cent ranks when its new solicitor, Janet Oss
man, who-replaced Margie Dorris, turned in $72 in cash and $16 in pledges
that will be paid by Dec. 10.
At Lagunita, Casa Naranja is in the lead with almost 100 per cent of
the girls donating, according to Dodie Crile, sub-chairman.
Financial Chairman Hale urges all solicitors to turn in their reports
just as soon as they have completed their campaign, and that should be
very soon. In case the termination of collection of any solicitor is prolonged
for some reason or other, it is that a partial record of coverage be
reported.
To those students who have not as yet been contacted by their solicitor,
the War Chest Committee desires that they take it upon themselves to see
that four dollars is contributed to this drive. The time is growing short, as
the drive closes and official count is taken next Monday.
This is the only time this year that you will be asked to give to a war
drive, as this new drive includes the previous annual drives for Dimes for
Diplomas, World Student Service Fund, and the Infantile Paralysis Drive.
Also incorporated in this campaign is the National War Fund, which is
being increased by War Chest drives in every city of the United States.
About 50 per cent of the funds of this national relief federation will support
USO's on the America continent and in the many far-flung battlefronts all
over the world.

To those students who have not as yet been contacted by their solicitor,
the War Chest Committee desires that they take it upon themselves to see
that four dollars is contributed to this drive. The time is growing short, as

This is the only time this year that you will be asked to give to a war
drive, as this new drive includes the previous annual drives for Dimes for
Diplomas, World Student Service Fund, and the Infantile Paralysis Drive.

being increased by War Chest drives in every city of the United States.
About 50 per cent of the funds of this national relief federation will support
USO's on the America continent and in the many far-flung battlefronts all
over the world.
Another day of the students' War Chest Drive brings the total sum
contributed in cash and pledges to $1,366.10. This is a surprising figure con
sidering the number of solicitors that have reported, and it proves Stanford's
whole-hearted cooperation in this phase of our war effort.
Alpha Phi has equalled Gamma Phi and D.G. by supporting the War
Chest Drive 100 per cent. Lincoln Hall proved itself to be superior among
the men's halls when its solicitor, Garwin Barry, handed 100 per cent con
tributions to Janet Hale, financial head of the War Chest Committee.
When Corridor 1A and 3B came through 100 per cent yesterday, Ewell
Sale, sub-chairman at Roble, said, "We expect Roble to go 100 per cent by
Friday night."
Casita joined the 100 per cent ranks when its new solicitor, Janet Oss
man, who-replaced Margie Dorris, turned in $72 in cash and $16 in pledges
that will be paid by Dec. 10.
At Lagunita, Casa Naranja is in the lead with almost 100 per cent of
the girls donating, according to Dodie Crile, sub-chairman.
