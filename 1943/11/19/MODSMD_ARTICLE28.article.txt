### 
WASHINGTON. Nov. IS (UP) —Secretary of State Cordell Hull told a
joint session of Congress today that the four-power Moscow declarations
can rid the world of war-breeding power politics by establishing a brother
hood of peaceful nations.
Just a week after returning from his greatest triumph of statesmanship
—— 1 -f—thi» Mmimw cimfpronfr of fnrafim

ministers—the 72-year-old secretary
said the parley "is believed to have
been an important step in the direc
tion of shortening the war and of
making provisions for the future."
Most vital of the achievements, he
said, was the declaration in which
Russia, Britain, the United States,
and China pledged themselves to
"carry forward to its fullest develop
ment a broad and progressive pro
gram of international cooperation" to
maintain post-war peace.
"No Need for Alliance"
"As the provisions of the four
nation declaration are carried into
effect, there will no longer be need
for spheres of influence, for alliances,
for balance of power, or any other of
the special arrangements through
which the nations strove to safe
guard their security or to promote
their interests," he solemnly assured.
The first cabinet member ever to
address a joint session, he was given
a hero's welcome as he strode into
the House chamber where he once
served as a Tennessee representative.
Speaker Sam Rayburn introducd
him as "one of our most distinguished
ex-members" who started in Con
gress "a career that has led to world
wide fame."
Moscow Achievements
1. Important agreements were
reached "but there were no secret
agreements and none was suggested."
2. The main point of the four
power declaration—"the principal of
sovereign equality of all peace-loving
states, irrespective of size and
strength, as partners in a future sys
tem of general security—will be the
foundation stone upon which the fu
ture international organization will
be constructed."
3. The basic policy of international
cooperation for peace and security
must be carried forward "in the
principles and spirit of the Atlantic
Charter and the declaration by
United Nations."
4. There were problems—such as
boundary questions — "which must,
by their very nature, be left in abey
ance until the termination of hostili
ties.
5. The supremely important fact is
that the conference revitalized and
gave practical expression to "the
whole spirit of international coop
eration, now and after the war," thus
launching a "forward movement,
which, I am firmly convinced, will
steadily extend in scope and effec
tiveness."
6. Only by carrying forward a pro
gram of international cooperation
"can we expect, in the long range of
the future, to avoid becoming victims
of destructive forces of international
anarchy."
7. The conference gave prelim
inary attention to problems of the
transition from war to peace. There
was a "fruitful exchange of views on
such questions as the treatment of
Germany and its satellites, phases of
economic relations, promotion o£.so
cial welfare, and the assurance of
general security and peace.''

their interests," he solemnly assured.
The first cabinet member ever to
address a joint session, he was given
a hero's welcome as he strode into
the House chamber where he once
served as a Tennessee representative.
Speaker Sam Rayburn introducd
him as "one of our most distinguished
ex-members" who started in Con

wide fame."
Moscow Achievements
1. Important agreements were
reached "but there were no secret
agreements and none was suggested."
2. The main point of the four
power declaration—"the principal of
sovereign equality of all peace-loving
states, irrespective of size and
strength, as partners in a future sys
tem of general security—will be the
foundation stone upon which the fu
ture international organization will
be constructed."
3. The basic policy of international
cooperation for peace and security
must be carried forward "in the
principles and spirit of the Atlantic
Charter and the declaration by
United Nations."
4. There were problems—such as
boundary questions — "which must,
by their very nature, be left in abey
ance until the termination of hostili
ties.
5. The supremely important fact is
that the conference revitalized and
gave practical expression to "the
whole spirit of international coop
eration, now and after the war," thus
launching a "forward movement,
which, I am firmly convinced, will
steadily extend in scope and effec
tiveness."
6. Only by carrying forward a pro
gram of international cooperation
"can we expect, in the long range of
the future, to avoid becoming victims
of destructive forces of international
anarchy."
7. The conference gave prelim
inary attention to problems of the
transition from war to peace. There
was a "fruitful exchange of views on
such questions as the treatment of
Germany and its satellites, phases of
economic relations, promotion o£.so
cial welfare, and the assurance of
general security and peace.''
WASHINGTON. Nov. IS (UP) —Secretary of State Cordell Hull told a
joint session of Congress today that the four-power Moscow declarations
can rid the world of war-breeding power politics by establishing a brother
hood of peaceful nations.
Just a week after returning from his greatest triumph of statesmanship
—— 1 -f—thi» Mmimw cimfpronfr of fnrafim

ministers—the 72-year-old secretary
said the parley "is believed to have
been an important step in the direc
tion of shortening the war and of
making provisions for the future."
Most vital of the achievements, he
said, was the declaration in which
Russia, Britain, the United States,
and China pledged themselves to
"carry forward to its fullest develop
ment a broad and progressive pro
gram of international cooperation" to
maintain post-war peace.
"No Need for Alliance"
"As the provisions of the four
nation declaration are carried into
effect, there will no longer be need
for spheres of influence, for alliances,
for balance of power, or any other of
the special arrangements through
which the nations strove to safe
guard their security or to promote
their interests," he solemnly assured.
