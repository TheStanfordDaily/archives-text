# Jap Economy Threatens Long War
## 
### 
"Japan is feeling her greatest pinch
today in the problem of shipping,"
said JohnW. Masland, professor in
the Army's Far Eastern School, yes
terday. He added that, "otherwise,
Japan's economic condition is im
proving."
The shortage of ships presents a
real problem to Japan, however, in
that they are needed badly to carrjn
her vital resources and to bring mu
nitions and military supplies to her
troops. The Allies are sinking just, a
few more ships than Japan can re
place. To alleviate this shortage the
Nipponese are building small wooden
vessels of from 50 to 250 tons for
small shipping between their con
quered outposts and Japan.
"The Japanese have enough raw
materials and resources on hand to
last them for some time," added Mr.
Masland, "and though we are in
creasing our production at a much
greater rate than they are propor
tionately, we can make no great
headway against them until we top
them sufficiently to increase our rate
of advance in the South Pacific.
"If we continue at the speed we're
going, the war will last indefinitely,
and we'll eventually get tired of it
and just quit."
Burma Offensive
But this isn't likely to happen, he
continued, saying that as soon as the
Burma offensive under Lord Louis
Mountbatten is launched we will be ■
able to move much faster; moreover. !
our production is accelerating at a
rate that will soon be sufficiently
greater than Japan's to enable us to
really start rolling.
"The strategy of 'island hopping'
now being pursued by military chiefs
in the Far East is just to enable us
to get a hold on the island bases that
will give us an edge over Japanese
control in the South Pacific," Pro
fessor Masland said.
Japs Not Suffering
Mr. Masland revealed that the
average Japanese is not suffering any
more than usual. He is pinched for
iood, but yet manages to export more
fats and oils than before. He is keyed
to a high pitch of patriotism; and
though the government chiefs see
the handwriting of defeat on the
wall, the Japanese people believe
firmly in the complete superiority of
the emperor and are sure that Japan
js gaining greater victories every
day.

Japan's economic condition is im
proving."
The shortage of ships presents a
real problem to Japan, however, in
that they are needed badly to carrjn
her vital resources and to bring mu
nitions and military supplies to her
troops. The Allies are sinking just, a
few more ships than Japan can re
place. To alleviate this shortage the
Nipponese are building small wooden
vessels of from 50 to 250 tons for
small shipping between their con
quered outposts and Japan.
"The Japanese have enough raw
materials and resources on hand to
last them for some time," added Mr.
Masland, "and though we are in
creasing our production at a much
greater rate than they are propor
tionately, we can make no great
headway against them until we top
them sufficiently to increase our rate
of advance in the South Pacific.
"If we continue at the speed we're
going, the war will last indefinitely,
and we'll eventually get tired of it
and just quit."
Burma Offensive
But this isn't likely to happen, he
continued, saying that as soon as the
Burma offensive under Lord Louis
Mountbatten is launched we will be ■
able to move much faster; moreover. !
our production is accelerating at a
rate that will soon be sufficiently
greater than Japan's to enable us to
really start rolling.
"The strategy of 'island hopping'
now being pursued by military chiefs
in the Far East is just to enable us
to get a hold on the island bases that
will give us an edge over Japanese
control in the South Pacific," Pro
fessor Masland said.
Japs Not Suffering
Mr. Masland revealed that the
average Japanese is not suffering any
more than usual. He is pinched for
iood, but yet manages to export more
fats and oils than before. He is keyed
to a high pitch of patriotism; and
though the government chiefs see
the handwriting of defeat on the
wall, the Japanese people believe
firmly in the complete superiority of
the emperor and are sure that Japan
js gaining greater victories every
day.
"Japan is feeling her greatest pinch
today in the problem of shipping,"
