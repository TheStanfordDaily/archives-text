ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERS, Nov. 18.—Breaking up a threat
ened Na/.i counterattack, British troops have advanced two miles through
the mud and rain of eastern Italy while American bombers have pounded!
airfields around Athens for the third time in 48 hours in support of the
Aegean campaign, it was announced today.

Fighting a ghostly war on the*
mist-shouded western Italian sector,
the Fifth Army exchanged patrol
tallies with the Germans and enemy
big guns boomed blindly without j
benefit of observation in an effort to
smash Lt. Gen Mark W. Clark's of- |
fensive plans.
Front dispatches said rain was bat- i
ing down so steadily on the Fifth
Army lines that troops had to bail
out their foxholes with their helmets.
The Eighth Army finally broke the I
week-long Italian stalemate 12 miles •
inland from the Adriatic where |
Gen. Sir B. L. Montgomery's troops !
moved up two miles to high ground j
overlooking the Nazi Sangro River !
line.
Earlier, strong enemy formations i
had been observed forming for a j
counterattack in the area of Atessa to I
the northwest. British and Canadian
troops went into immediate action I
and, supported by RAF Kittyhawks,
forced the Germans to call off the j
attack.
