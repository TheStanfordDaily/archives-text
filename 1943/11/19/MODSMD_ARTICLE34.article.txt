Large piles of dope sheets on the
fioor of the Daily Shack indicate that
the Daily football experts have once
again made their predictions of the
football games of the weekend. Be
cause of the tremendous success of
Don Langendorf last week in using
the dope sheets the other experts
have decided to put aside their ouija
boards and take a crack at the dope
sheet method instead. But now for
the predictions.
Arkansas over a fair Oklahoma
A & M eleven by 9; Army over
Brown by 14. Coast Guard over
California by 6, but it's possible to
go the other way; Colgate over the
weak Columbia Lions by 12; Dart
mouth over Princeton by 18; and
Duke over North Carolina by 7.
North Carolina could very possibly
win the game, as they showed evi
dence of great strength in their sur
prise upset of Pennsylvania last
week.
Northwestern over Illinois by 7.
Expert Gugel went against the II-
Zini this week after picking them to
win for two straight weeks and losing
both times.
Purdue over Indiana by 12, with
expert Luce picking the Roosiers
in hopes of an upset; lowa over Ne
braska by 10 in a game that could go
either way; Missouri over Kansas by
9; lowa State over Kansas State by
3, Luce again not agreeing with the
other experts; LSU over Tulane by
13; and Great Lakes over Marquette
by 15.
Michigan over Ohio State by 21;
Minnisota over Wisconsin by 7, in a
closie; Notre Dame over lowa Pre-
Flight by 13; Georgia Tech over
Cleinson by 13, probably more; Col
lege of Pacific over USF by 27; and
Penn State over Pittsburgh by 7.
Rice over TCU by 6; UCLA over
St. Mary's by 3; Texas Tech over
SMU by 6, with Roger Corman, the
master-mind of the experts, picking
Southern Methodist by the same
score; Villanova over Temple by 12;
Tulsa over Drake by 19, with a pos
sibility that the score may reach
astronomical figures; and last but far
from least, Del Monte Pre-Flight
over St.* Mary's Pre-Flight by 7.
Corman again disagreed with others
and chose St. Mary's by 6.
