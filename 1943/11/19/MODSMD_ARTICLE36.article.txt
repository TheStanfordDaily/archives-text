## Fightin' Q.M. Ruins Fillmore; Still Holds League Leadership 
### Roger Corman 
Proving that their rating as lead
ers of League A in the intramural
football league means something,
the Fightin' Q.M. overwhelmed
Fillmore Hall yesterday afternoon,
30-6.
Holding the vaunted Firehouse
power to one touchdown, the Stoates
played one of their best games of
the year, only to come out on the
short end of a 6-2 count. The vic
tory by the Firemen kept them in
the running as the top contenders
for the league lead, now held by
the Fightin' Q.M., while the loss by
the Stoates just about put them out
of the championship race.
McKinley won by default from
Veritas A.C., who failed to show up.
Going way out in front with two
first period touchdowns, Navy
coasted to an easy 18-0 win over the
Monroe A's. The victory places
Navy up there with the Firehouse
and McKinley.
A fighting Adams Hall team caught
mighty Dinah's off balance and

marched down the field for two first
period touchdowns, to take an early
lead over their heavily favored op
ponents. Roused by the two scores,
Dinah's then proceeded to turn on
the heat and sweep to a decisive
30-12 victory. The win placed Di
nah's up there with the Firehouse,
McKinley. and Navy as the top chal
lengers for the league leadership.
With touchdowns scored by Dick
Olson and Joe Scott, Tyler extended
their winning streak by shutting
out the Theta Hashers, 12-0.
Co. D team 2 ran into unexpect
edly stiff opposition when Gerona
A.C. fought them to a 12-12 tie for
| the regulation 60 minutes. An over
| time was declared and the two teams
battled evenly until a desperation
I pass connected for the soldiers,
j winning the game, 18-12.
Taking an early lead and holding
it through a series of wild on-
I slaughts, Co. C and A overwhelmed
I the Walter Thompson Co-op, 30-18,
i in a free scoring contest. The loss
j dropped the Co-op out of the run-
I ning for the League B title, while
[adding another win to the soldiers'
victory streak.
Tied with Co. C and A for the
, League B lead, Co. E team 1 had a
field day, murdering Buchanan, 42-
6. The Buchanan defense fell apart,
and the offense went with it, as the
game spelled finis to Buchanan't
j title hopes.
Co. E team 2 broke the winning
streak of Co. A at three games in a
row, winning 26-18. Co. A entered
the league late, and until yesterday
was the only undefeated team in
League B.
Following the example of teams
1 and 2, Company E team 3 won.
The McKinley B team was the stooge
for the soldiers, going down to de
feat, 24-0.
Another team was dropped from
the list of potential league winners,
as the Monroe B's came out on the
sad end of a 33-6 count, with Co. D
team 1 on the top side. Ed Luce
accounted for the civilians' lone
tally, while the entire Co. D squad
had a hand in running up the 33
points.
Co. L, F.A., took an early lead
over Lincoln and held it for the en
tire game, winning handily, 18-6.
A well-balanced combination of
running and passing plays made the
soldiers a constant threat, while the
Lincoln offense showed only once.
In the dying minutes of the game,
Lincoln marched the length of the
field with Bob Larrabee and Verne
Purcell alternating in the tailback
spot. A Purcell to Burke pass ac
counted for the score.
