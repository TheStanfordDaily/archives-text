# Monroe Wins Volleyball Tilt
## 
### 
In a game that started out to be a
rout and wound up as one of the
best contests this season, the Monroe
Maulers last night defeated Wash
ington Hall in intramural volleyball.
Monroe took the first game handi
ly, 15-4. The game was closer than
the score would indicate, but it didn't
look as though Washington would be
able to put up much of a fight in the
second game. Washington then pro
ceeded to give Monroe a 10-6 lead in
the second game. It was at this point
that Washington's game tightened up
considerably, and the game from
then to the finish was a nip-and
tuck battle.
After being behind, 10-6, Wash
ington came back to take the lead
themselves at 14-13. They were un
able to make the 15th point, how
ever, and the serve reverted to Mon
roe, who promptly deuced the score
at 14-all. Monroe then added two
more points to take the game and the
match, 15-4 and 16-14. The Monroe
attack was led by Bob Fess. Walter
Lull and Walton Brown played good
games for Washington.
In the only other clash of the eve
ning, the McKinley Bashers smeared
the Buchanan Bearcats in two
straight games, 15-6 and 15-9. The
other two scheduled games were not
played. All four teams—Dinah's,
Garfield, Fillmore, and Theta Hash
ers—failed to show up.
Four games have been scheduled
for Saturday morning, Nov. 20. At
9:45, Co. I, F.A. plays Arthur Hall,
and Hayes Hall meets Co. E. At
10:45, Dinah's tangles with McKinley
Hall, while Monroe attempts to con
tinue its winning ways against Gar
field.
