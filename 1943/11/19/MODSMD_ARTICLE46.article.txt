# ASTP Student Discusses Post-War Plans Concerning European Educational System
## 
### Joe Hawkins 
A great many plans and subjects are being discussed at present in con
nection with post-war reconstruction of Europe. Not the least of these
concerns the question of "What to do as regards European education aftei
the war?" Should we impose on Germany our own system of teaching?
Should we allow them complete freedom to work out their own problem?

These questions can best be an
swered by first understanding the
present or at least the pre-war edu
cational system in effect in Europe as
interpreted by some experienced ob
server. Such a person is Pfc. Otto
Brand of ASTU Co. I, who com
pleted his university education in
Austria. Pfc. Brand studied in the
University of Vienna from 1929 to
193(5. He took medicine for two
semesters, and then changed to law,
receiving his degree as Doctor of
Law in 1935.
Hitler took over Austria in March
1938, and in July of the same year
Brand left, going to Italy and France,
and finally to New York. He worked
on odd jobs until he was classified in
the draft, at which time he asked for
immediate induction. He was called
in September 1942 and because of his
foreign experience is now in the
foreign language post - graduate
group.
Schools Different
In explaining the educational sys
tem in Austria, which is very much
like that in Germany, Pfc. Brand
stated that we must understand the
peculiar situation there before we
can make any plans at all. We must
realize that the schools hold a very
different place over there. Many
countries do not need outside edu
cational plans and others have their
own ideas as to what they want. Pfc.
Brand emphasized the European
trend to take life as it is and make

the best of it. He also reminded us
that his facts would only concern
the pre-war systems, and that he had
no idea what changes had been made
in recent years.
Beginning at the very first, Brand
stated that the average student will
begin what corresponds to our gram
mar school at the age of six. After
four years here he can branch off
either into the more academic Mit
telschule, or to the lower class
Hauptschule, both of which are par
allel to our high schools. The Haupt
schule leads into the learning of a
trade or into a purely professional
or business school.
Three Main Courses
The Mittelschule is divided into
three parts: Realschule, which re
quires two modern languages and
which leads into technical college
and an Engineer's degree; Gym
nasium, which requires two classic
languages such as Latin and Greek;
and Realgymnasium, which is about
half way between these two ex
tremes. All of these three teach
pretty much the same subjects with
the exception of those mentioned.
Study in the gymnasium generally
leads to entering the university, but
a change to technical college be
made at any time by taking and
passing supplementary exams. The
student remains in, the university
about five years and is approxi
mately 24 when he receives his de
gree.

the draft, at which time he asked for
immediate induction. He was called
in September 1942 and because of his
foreign experience is now in the
foreign language post - graduate
group.
Schools Different
In explaining the educational sys
tem in Austria, which is very much
like that in Germany, Pfc. Brand
stated that we must understand the
peculiar situation there before we
can make any plans at all. We must
realize that the schools hold a very
different place over there. Many
countries do not need outside edu
cational plans and others have their
own ideas as to what they want. Pfc.
Brand emphasized the European
trend to take life as it is and make

the best of it. He also reminded us
that his facts would only concern
the pre-war systems, and that he had
no idea what changes had been made
in recent years.
Beginning at the very first, Brand
stated that the average student will
begin what corresponds to our gram
mar school at the age of six. After
four years here he can branch off
either into the more academic Mit
telschule, or to the lower class
Hauptschule, both of which are par
allel to our high schools. The Haupt
schule leads into the learning of a
trade or into a purely professional
or business school.
Three Main Courses
The Mittelschule is divided into
three parts: Realschule, which re
quires two modern languages and
which leads into technical college
and an Engineer's degree; Gym
nasium, which requires two classic
languages such as Latin and Greek;
and Realgymnasium, which is about
half way between these two ex
tremes. All of these three teach
pretty much the same subjects with
the exception of those mentioned.
Study in the gymnasium generally
leads to entering the university, but
a change to technical college be
made at any time by taking and
passing supplementary exams. The
student remains in, the university
about five years and is approxi
mately 24 when he receives his de
gree.
A great many plans and subjects are being discussed at present in con
nection with post-war reconstruction of Europe. Not the least of these
concerns the question of "What to do as regards European education aftei
the war?" Should we impose on Germany our own system of teaching?
Should we allow them complete freedom to work out their own problem?

These questions can best be an
swered by first understanding the
present or at least the pre-war edu
cational system in effect in Europe as
interpreted by some experienced ob
server. Such a person is Pfc. Otto
Brand of ASTU Co. I, who com
pleted his university education in
Austria. Pfc. Brand studied in the
University of Vienna from 1929 to
193(5. He took medicine for two
semesters, and then changed to law,
receiving his degree as Doctor of
Law in 1935.
Hitler took over Austria in March
1938, and in July of the same year
Brand left, going to Italy and France,
and finally to New York. He worked
on odd jobs until he was classified in
the draft, at which time he asked for
immediate induction. He was called
in September 1942 and because of his
foreign experience is now in the
foreign language post - graduate
group.
