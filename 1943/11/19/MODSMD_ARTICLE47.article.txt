# Vienna Barber Now Clips 9L's Of Pierce Hall
## 
### Pfc. George Lobbenberg, Co. I 
Company I, that amazing conglom
eration of 9L's, containing everything
from Hollywood scriptwriters to
Seattle brewmasters and Austrian
soccer captains, has only one M.T.A.
—Master of Tonsorial Arts.
His name is Cpl. Otto Link, and,
as does the other Otto of the group,
he hails from Vienna. Corporal Link
came to this country in 1941, after
barbering his way through, and out
of a French concentration camp, St.
Cyprien. There he had to exercise
his profession for five months in a
shop consisting of one deep hole,
where customers had to place them
selves in order to be trimmed.
Corporal Link is still, understand
ably, somewhat reluctant in describ
ing the details of his escape, but at
any rate he managed to reach Spain
after an adventurous trip over the
Pyrenees.
In Spain, where he was promptly
nabbed by the police as a suspicious
foreigner, he managed to talk and
clip his way to the Portuguese bor
der, and finally, after waiting for
months in Lisbon, he got passage to
the United States.
Corporal Link practiced his art in
various New York establishments,
and, after his entry into the U.S.
Army, became a most popular and
sought-after man in camp. He had a
definitely privileged position in Camp
Atterbury, Ind., where he was the
official officers' barber.
Here at Stanford Otto continues
his work in spare hours, and is rec
ognized as a most valuable member
of our community. Stanford coeds
tend to comment favorably on his
"'continental smoothness" in manners
and conversation, but when you ask
him about his ideas in matters femi
nine, he will invariably sigh and
shake his head: "Oh. il I could only
be in Brooklyn " And frankly,
after seeing "Brooklyn's" picture, we
tend to agree with Otto.
