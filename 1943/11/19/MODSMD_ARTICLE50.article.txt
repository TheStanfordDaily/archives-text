### 
TOMORROW night the members of Company
E will give their "Indian Summer" dance in
the Pavillion. This dance is the second given
by this company who joined Company F in
giving an "At Ease" dance last July.
The July dance v/as a great success with one
of the largest crowds ever to attend a Stanford
dance. The one tomorrow night promises to
be even better with all the advantages and
none of the bad points of the one this summer.
The dance will be an opportunity for all
Stanford students, in and out of uniform, to
mingle as it is open to all students on campus.
It is semi-formal so the fellows won't have to
Worry about dress clothes. It is also one of
the first dances this quarter to have an orchestra.
