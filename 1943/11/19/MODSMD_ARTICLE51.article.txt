# Keep the Canteen Clean
## 
### 
THE new Stanford Canteen opens tonight in
the renovated Nitery. Students have re
painted and redecorated and now the rest of
us must see that it stays ship-shape.
Let's remember not to drop cigarette ashes
on the floor, scuff the paint, or leave coke bottles
wherever we happen to be.
The committee has spent a lot of time and
work doing over the Nitery. It's our turn now
to show them we appreviate their effort by
keeping the Canteen clean.—Esther Belew.
