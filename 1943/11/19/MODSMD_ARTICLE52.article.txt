### Sgt. GASTON VALCOURT Company I. ASTP 
It may seem a little late in the day to ac
quaint civilians with the significance of the
various non-commissioned ranks but, judging
from the variety of titles with which we are
addressed by well-intentioned co-eds on the
campus, it might be a good idea to clarify
some of the errors with which they seem to
be hopelessly beset.
The rank of private first class (PFC) rarely
lends itself to error. Parents in particular are
quick to grasp the title which is, after all, no
more than official confirmation of their already
established appraisal of Junior's talents.
But the word corporal, in its various abbre
viations, plunges the layman into confusion.
Imagine our embarrassment when our ancient
aunt used to insist of mistaking "corp" for
"capt" and doggedly continued to address us
as the latter in the face of our startled protests
and the ribald comment of our buddies.
However, such an error is at least flattering in
its implications, unlike the bewildered query of
a fogbound sorority sister who asked "What on
earth is a CPL?" A cpl or corporal is the back
bone of the army, or so we believed until we
were promoted to the rarefied ranks of the triple
striped.
As a technician fourth grade, we are entitled
to be addressed as sergeant, a word which falls
pleasantly on our unaccustomed ears. It is
theremore than somewhat irritating to be pains
takingly addressed by an English friend in
Washington as "Corporal Gaston Valcourt,

Tech 4th grade." "Sergeant" or "T 4" will suf
fice, pal. Cut out that corporal.
Of course, if you want to make another com
mon mistake, and address us as "technical ser
geant," our protests will be feeble, if any. For
a technical sergeant belongs in the upper strata
of noncommissioned ranks, one step below the
almighty master sergeant, one above the en
viable staff sergeant.
Now do you catch on? There is all the differ
ence in the world between a technician and a
technic*! sergeant, and the rank of corporal,
abbreviated to "cpl" or "corp," is in no way
comparable with "capt" or "col."
Of course we have no doubt that our ancient
aunt, who is a rugged individualist, allergic to
correction, will read this column carefully, ab
sorb its contents, and continue bithely to ad
dress us as "capt." But let us hope that other
soldiers will be spared our embarrassment. For
promotion comes to the deserving in due course,
without the unconscious prompting of well
intentioned but obtuse relatives who jump to
the conclusion that "cpl" means a commission,
while "T 4" must inevitably indicate the lofty
status of technical sergeant.

more than official confirmation of their already
established appraisal of Junior's talents.
But the word corporal, in its various abbre
viations, plunges the layman into confusion.
Imagine our embarrassment when our ancient
aunt used to insist of mistaking "corp" for
"capt" and doggedly continued to address us
as the latter in the face of our startled protests
and the ribald comment of our buddies.
However, such an error is at least flattering in
its implications, unlike the bewildered query of
a fogbound sorority sister who asked "What on
earth is a CPL?" A cpl or corporal is the back
bone of the army, or so we believed until we
were promoted to the rarefied ranks of the triple
striped.
As a technician fourth grade, we are entitled
to be addressed as sergeant, a word which falls
pleasantly on our unaccustomed ears. It is
theremore than somewhat irritating to be pains
takingly addressed by an English friend in
Washington as "Corporal Gaston Valcourt,

Tech 4th grade." "Sergeant" or "T 4" will suf
fice, pal. Cut out that corporal.
Of course, if you want to make another com
mon mistake, and address us as "technical ser
geant," our protests will be feeble, if any. For
a technical sergeant belongs in the upper strata
of noncommissioned ranks, one step below the
almighty master sergeant, one above the en
viable staff sergeant.
Now do you catch on? There is all the differ
ence in the world between a technician and a
technic*! sergeant, and the rank of corporal,
abbreviated to "cpl" or "corp," is in no way
comparable with "capt" or "col."
Of course we have no doubt that our ancient
aunt, who is a rugged individualist, allergic to
correction, will read this column carefully, ab
sorb its contents, and continue bithely to ad
dress us as "capt." But let us hope that other
soldiers will be spared our embarrassment. For
promotion comes to the deserving in due course,
without the unconscious prompting of well
intentioned but obtuse relatives who jump to
the conclusion that "cpl" means a commission,
while "T 4" must inevitably indicate the lofty
status of technical sergeant.

It may seem a little late in the day to ac
quaint civilians with the significance of the
various non-commissioned ranks but, judging
from the variety of titles with which we are
addressed by well-intentioned co-eds on the
campus, it might be a good idea to clarify
some of the errors with which they seem to
be hopelessly beset.
The rank of private first class (PFC) rarely
lends itself to error. Parents in particular are
quick to grasp the title which is, after all, no
more than official confirmation of their already
established appraisal of Junior's talents.
