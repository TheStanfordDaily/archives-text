### BILL ROSE 
MIEUX VAUT TARD QUE JAMAIS
It's a little late for summer, but the men of
Company E are idealists —or something. So
they are giving a dance tomorrow and calling
it "Indian Summer." Despite the anachronism,
it should be a nice brawl.
The soldiers have termed this a semi-formal
affair, which means the girls can wear long
dresses but the fellows don't have to wear
tuxes. At least, that's what the Daily fashion
editor tells me—and she ought to know.
The idea sounds very sans, I think. They
tell me Company E's Summer Quarter dance—
which was called Indian Autumn—was a great
success. There's no reason why this one
shouldn't be too. So let's everybody go. (I get
10 per cent of the take for writing this blurb.
Needless to say, I hope the crowd is tremen
dous.)
The moron who copyreads my column has
my best interests at heart. That's why he (or
more probably she) cobbed up the most im
portant line in yesterday's column. Now maybe
you'll appreciate how vital every part of Bull
Session is to the whole.
The omitted last line in yesteray's last para
graph was: "ing from a nervous breakdown. I
just heard a waitress was" Put this in wherever
you think it fits best. It will really do wonders.
