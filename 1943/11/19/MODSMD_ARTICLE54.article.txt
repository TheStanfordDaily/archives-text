This is just a little note of appreciation in
regards to The Stanford Daily.
I left Stanford last Spring Quarter to go
into the service. Used to the gay and free
college atmosphere, I had a little trouble at
first with my sergeant. On account of these
"misunderstandings" I was doing Kitchen Police
one night. I had a losing fight with a sack of
onions until the mail was brought in.
Mine consisted of a few copies of The Daily
which some patriotic Stanfordite had sent me.
Forgotten were the onions with their "heavenly
aroma" as I was taken back, at least in spirit,
to my college days . . .
... In other words, what I'm trying to say
is that a soldier enjoys those sweet memories
of his college days more than anything else.
Encourage the Stanford co-eds to save their
Dailies, and after reading them, ask the girls
to pass them on to their former Stanford friends
now in the Army, Navy, or Marine Corps. It
is only a little trouble to the Stanfordites, and
it means so much to us!
