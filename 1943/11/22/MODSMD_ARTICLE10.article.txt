# All Med School To Donate Blood
## 
### 
The entire Stanford Medical
School, has volunteered to donate
blood on the next Blood Bank day,
Dec. 2.
"We were very glad," said the head
of the Palo Alto Blood Bunk, "to see
such enthusiastic response by the
Stanford students. This is a very
urgent cause, and it is gratifying to
see it so strongly supported."
As the Medical School is taking all
the afternoon appointments, volun
teers are asked to sign for morning
appointments only, announced Chair
man Helen Herring.
The regular quota of 30 donors will
be lowered to 20 for Dec. 2, but stu
dents and soldiers must sign up in
the War Board office before Wednes
day of this week. They may sign for
appointments at 11:20 or 11:40.
A new shipment of permission slips
has arrived at the War Board office,
Miss Herring announced. Persons
who wish to donate on Dec. 2 but
are not 21 must have one of these
silps signed by both parents before
they can give their blood.
