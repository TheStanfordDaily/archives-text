# City Symphony Season Opens
## 
### 
Featuring compositions by Bee
thoven, Prokofiev, and Richard
Strauss, the San Francisco Symphony
Orchestra opened its 32nd season
with a pair of concerts last Friday
afternoon and Saturday night, in the
War Memorial Opera House in San
Francisco.
Of special interest was the first San
Francisco performance of Serge Pro
kofiev's Suite from his ballet, "Ro
meo and Juliet." The work was
typical Prokofiev; well constructed
with perfusion of catchy thematic
material and having a witty, tongue
in-cheek character. The last section
of the Suite, "The Death of Tybalt,"
has the same sarcastic quality as the
Funeral March in the composer's
Lieutenant Kiji Suite, although the
approach in the two is entirely dif
ferent.
Pierre Monteux, the orchestra's
regular conductor, presented a stir
ing rendition of Richard Strauss's
"Till Eulenspiegel's Merry Pranks,"
although in the opening passages, he
took a faster tempo than is generally
the case.
The other works on the program
were Beethoven's "Coriolan Over
ture" and "Pastoral Symphony."-—
