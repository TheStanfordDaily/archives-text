# Students Behind the Scenes "Bear the Brunt' of Gaieties
## 
### Ellen Marcus 
In any theatrical production, it is always the actors, sometimes, possibly
the authors, who receive the applause and praise. Behind every show,
there is a director, a costume designer, and wardrobe mistress, and a
technical director who carry most of the responsibility, endure the innum
erable headaches, and receive the brunt of every complaint thrown by

critics and participants alike. The
man backstage gets his reward only
from the knowledge of a job well
done.
Anyone connected with the Gaie
ties will tell you that Jean Levinson,
director, is busier than any two peo
ple in sight. Besides being head man
of the whole show, Miss Levinson
has had a hand in the writing of
many of the scripts, and will appear
on stage during the performance.
Stanford Players Work
Miss Levinson, the director, now
a first-quarter senior, has worked
with the Stanford Players in three of
their productions, "Time to Come,"
"Squaring the Circle," and "Tonight
at 8:30," presented Summer Quarter.
Her famous ,; Kith Me," from the
civilian defense skit of last year's
Gaieties was the hit of the show.
Miss Levinson also received plaudits
for her portrayal of the gypsy hag in
"No Mother to Guide Her," the
melodrama presented in the last
Spring Show.
Technical Director
Moofie Faris, technical director,
has worked backstage on all the
Gaieties and Spring Shows during
her two years at Stanford. Miss
Faris has also acted in the Stanford
Players' "The Eve of St. Mark,'' and
for Ram's Head, of which she is now
president, in their last one-acts,
playing the heroine in "A Very Un
scrupulous Woman."
Paula Kanner holds one of the
most important and thankless jobs in
the show, costume designer and
wardrobe mistress. Miss Kanner is
a third-quarter senior and has been
designing and making costumes for
the last three Gaieties and for two
Spring Shows.
Work on '42 Gaieties
She is especially proud of three of
her creations for the '43 Gaieties
which she explains as, ''a hot pink
and Kelly green mid-rift top with a
black satin split-skirt for the dancers
in the Harlem number, and a formal
w hiat silver sequin top and purple
skirt trimmed with silver sequins for
the 'Cabernet and Candlelight' num
ber."
Miss Kanner has also designed a
specially seductive evening gown for
comedienne Nan Tillson to wear
when she sings "You Big Attractive
Man."
