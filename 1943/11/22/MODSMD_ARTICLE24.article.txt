The Daily football experts came
another step closer to fame and for
tune this week, by raising their sea
sonal average from .868 to .877, an
average that only an handful of foot
ball prognosticators throughout the
nation can boast. In fact one of the
nation's best known football experts,
whose picks appear in papers all
over the country has only an average
in the low ,800's for the season.
As a result of this last weekend,
not one of the experts has an average
of lower than .86.9!
Expert Corman, who has led the
experts for the last seven weeks, is
now tied for first place honors with
expert Gugel. Both have picked 107
games out of 122 for an average of
.877. Experts Langendorf and Luce
are tied for second place with 106
out of 122 for an average of .869.
As the four are so close, next
week's predictions will decide who
will take the final honors. It's still
anybody's game. However, the ex
perts will be confronted with two
really tough games next week, the
Army-Navy game and the Texas-
Texas A & M game. Both games are
practically toss-ups, and the final
standings will very probably be de
cided on how they pick these games.
