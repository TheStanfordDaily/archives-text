In thinking of education in Europe,
particularly in Germany, we must
realize that we are dealing with an
entirely different kind of people, ac
cording to Pfc. Otto Brand.
One of the fundamental differences

! is the motive for study. In Europe
! the student prepares himself for one
| and only one profession or trade. !
' This tends to make the person more J
one-sided. Thus if circumstances ;
happen to change, the student has a i
difficult time adjusting himself to the j
new environment.
Pfc. Brand explained that the main j
diversion for men students in Eu- j
rope was in a Burschenschaft, a club i
or social gathering of young men !

with common interests — often for
furthering political power. These
clubs were divided into the fighting
| and non-lighting ones —or into those
in which dueling was a prerequisite j
and those which concentrated mainly
j on drinking.
The "lighting" organizations re
quired that each member must en
gage in at least one duel a month.
Although this was in reality only a
practice match, if, at any time, a

member's honor was threatened, he
was forced by fear of public ridicule
to challenge his opponent to a duel
which often resulted in had wounds.
Pfc. Brand, when he first arrived
in this country, said that he con
sidered the co-educational system
one of the best features of American
schooling until he found that its ob
ject lay not in the intention of raising
young people to accept their coop
erative responsibilities in society, but

rather more of a matrimonial insti
tution. which, considering the short
age of male population, might not be
such a bad idea after all.
Continuing to compare the univer
sity life here and abroad, Pfc. Brand
stated that in Europe sex is taker
more as a matter of course, while
here it is spoken and written about a
great deal.
In the courses themselves, students
are not required to attend any lec
tures. They are supposed to learn
just so much, and it does not make
any difference how they accomplish
this. Students are graded for then
subjects as a whole, not for each
separate study. Grading is arranged
by the professors in four stages:
excellent, good, satisfactory, and un
satisfactory.
By and large, Pfc. Brand states, he
has noticed that "undoubtedly the
overwhelming majority of the Amer
ican studeuts lead a much happier
life than the Europeans."

one-sided. Thus if circumstances ;
happen to change, the student has a i
difficult time adjusting himself to the j
new environment.
Pfc. Brand explained that the main j
diversion for men students in Eu- j
rope was in a Burschenschaft, a club i
or social gathering of young men !

with common interests — often for
furthering political power. These
clubs were divided into the fighting
| and non-lighting ones —or into those
in which dueling was a prerequisite j
and those which concentrated mainly
j on drinking.
The "lighting" organizations re
quired that each member must en
gage in at least one duel a month.
Although this was in reality only a
practice match, if, at any time, a

member's honor was threatened, he
was forced by fear of public ridicule
to challenge his opponent to a duel
which often resulted in had wounds.
Pfc. Brand, when he first arrived
in this country, said that he con
sidered the co-educational system
one of the best features of American
schooling until he found that its ob
ject lay not in the intention of raising
young people to accept their coop
erative responsibilities in society, but

rather more of a matrimonial insti
tution. which, considering the short
age of male population, might not be
such a bad idea after all.
Continuing to compare the univer
sity life here and abroad, Pfc. Brand
stated that in Europe sex is taker
more as a matter of course, while
here it is spoken and written about a
great deal.
In the courses themselves, students
are not required to attend any lec
tures. They are supposed to learn
just so much, and it does not make
any difference how they accomplish
this. Students are graded for then
subjects as a whole, not for each
separate study. Grading is arranged
by the professors in four stages:
excellent, good, satisfactory, and un
satisfactory.
By and large, Pfc. Brand states, he
has noticed that "undoubtedly the
overwhelming majority of the Amer
ican studeuts lead a much happier
life than the Europeans."
