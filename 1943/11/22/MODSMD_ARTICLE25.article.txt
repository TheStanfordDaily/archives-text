(Editor's Note: This is the second
of a series of two articles concerning
the European educational system
gathered from information given hy
Pfc. Otto Brand.)
In thinking of education in Europe,
particularly in Germany, we must
realize that we are dealing with an
entirely different kind of people, ac
cording to Pfc. Otto Brand.
One of the fundamental differences

! is the motive for study. In Europe
! the student prepares himself for one
| and only one profession or trade. !
' This tends to make the person more J
one-sided. Thus if circumstances ;
happen to change, the student has a i
difficult time adjusting himself to the j
new environment.
Pfc. Brand explained that the main j
diversion for men students in Eu- j

furthering political power. These
clubs were divided into the fighting

The "lighting" organizations re
quired that each member must en
gage in at least one duel a month.
Although this was in reality only a
practice match, if, at any time, a

member's honor was threatened, he
was forced by fear of public ridicule
to challenge his opponent to a duel
which often resulted in had wounds.
Pfc. Brand, when he first arrived
in this country, said that he con

one of the best features of American
schooling until he found that its ob

young people to accept their coop
erative responsibilities in society, but

rather more of a matrimonial insti

age of male population, might not be
such a bad idea after all.
Continuing to compare the univer
sity life here and abroad, Pfc. Brand
stated that in Europe sex is taker
more as a matter of course, while
here it is spoken and written about a
great deal.
In the courses themselves, students
