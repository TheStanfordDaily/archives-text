## 'Sergeant' Bogart Combats Desert Sand, Nazis in 'Sahara' 
### 
SAIIAKA—Now playing at the Stanford Theater.
"Sahara" is a sand-blown, wind-swept desert tale of an Allied tank unit,
with Humphrey Bogart featured as a Yank sergeant in command of a
strange crew of soldiers from many nations. The film shows their des
perate struggle against thirst and Nazi troops on the burning African dunes.

► As the picture begins Bogart and
his crew of Americans are lost in
the hectic African retreat of last
! summer. They meet up with the
remnants of a British medical corps
that has been bombed out of ex
istence by the Germans. The little
band then begins their long trek to
the nearest waterhole during which
they capture an Italian prisoner and
a German pilot.
Finally Bogart and his 12 comrades
reach their destination where they
are forced to make a last stand
against a German column. The Ger
mans are tricked into surrender and
Bogart is acclaimed the hero of the
day.
"Sahara" is an honestly told, well
done story that is one of the better
war films of the day. Humphrey Bo
gart turns in his usual fine job as the
tough sergeant while the supporting
cast, headed by J. Carrol Naish and
Bruce Bennett, is also good.
The second "hit" is a forlorn little
thing called "Footlight Glamour."
It's another of the weak Blondie
series and this time Penny Singleton
decides she wants to go on the stage.
Of course the play flops—as likewise
does the picture. Blondie had better
dye her golden locks and try some
thing else.—Bower
