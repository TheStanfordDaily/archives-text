# Juniors Invited To Cal Informal
## 
### 
The University of California will
once again hold its annual Junior
Informal Saturday, Nov. 27, at the
Claremont Hotel in Berkeley. This
! year it will be traditional in all re
j spects except oneâ€”Stanford men and
| women will mingle with the throng
! of Cal people.
1 In view of the many Farm men
; who are attending Berkeley in the
V-12 and Marine Reserve programs,
i the U.C. junior class president. Peggy
Kohrland, has extended a special
welcome to the members of the Stan
ford junior class. The invitation
| which Stanford received for last
Saturday's Cal-UCLA game was
only the first extension of friendship
from the Golden Bear to the Little
1 Indian.
