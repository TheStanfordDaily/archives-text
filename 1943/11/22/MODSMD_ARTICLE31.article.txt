# Starved Nazi Prisoners Aided By Quakers, Relates Refugee
## 
### Dave Davis 
The personal tragedy of war was
made very real that peaceful Au
tumn afternoon as Mrs. Helene
Heymans quietly recalled her ex
periences during two and one-half
years of life under the Nazi Hag.
Mrs. Heymans is a Dutch citizen,
at present occupying her mind with
the instruction of Army language
students at Stanford. Occupying her
mind is the correct phrase, for if
there were one split second of
leisure, the memories of mass mur
j der, disease, and starvation would
overwhelm her.
: Tells of Exodus
"I was manager of personnel in a
department store at Antwerp in 1940
when the invasion began," she said.
"After the 18th bombing of the city
we decided to leave. Into France by
train, walking, gypsy trailer, coal
truck—any means —until we arrived
in Auch, a little place in Southern
France, near Toulouse.
'it may have been Unoccupied
France," Mrs. Heymans said gent
ly. "but there were concentration
camps and the camp of Gurs near
Auch was one of the worst—men
and women, old people, children."
Mrs. Heymans volunteered to work
with the Quakers and a Swiss wel
fare committee to alleviate the suf
fering at Gurs.
Prisoners Die at Camp
"I was allowed to go in and out of
the camp," she said. "The food was
so poor that if prisoners had no help
from the outside they died of starva
tion. Many did—l,soo died of hunger
and cold during the month of De
cember in 1940.
"I was there for 27 months. My son
left for England and Canada to
serve in the RCAF, but I stayed on.
The Quakers were wonderful and
they did a magnificent job; they lived
at the camp and distributed supplies
received at Marseilles from America
—dried fruit, bedding, milk, medi
cine—they saved hundreds of lives,"
has continued.
Causes of Death
But conditions grew worse at the
camp. Poor sanitation, fleas, and
rats contributed to the mounting
death rate. German agents took a
toll also.
Under the 19th clause of
the armistice a German com
mission was permitted to en
ter the camp every two weeks i
to remove anti-fascists to Ger
many. "Many people—" Mrs. Hey
mans thoughtfully rubbed her left
wrist, as though her fingers held a ;
razor blade.
In 1942 the Germans systematically
confiscated food intended for pris- ,
oners. The Quakers were arranging j
to leave. "The radio was our only i
encouragement." Mrs. Heymans said.
"You have no idea what it meant. It
was forbidden to listen but of course
we did—to the BBC constantly, to \
Churchill, and when President
Roosevelt spoke, I had to get up in
the middle of the night to listen; but
I did—and how."
Radio and Morale
Her mouth smiled, but not her i
eyes, "If we had had to listen to the
news the Germans broadcast we j
couldn't have lived. The Germans
knew what the radio did for our i
morale; they confiscated a million i
sets, but still we listened."
In 1942 Mrs. Heymans left France I
and arrived in Lisbon after a week
of travel. She went directly to the i
Dutch Legation, to work there until
May 1943. At that time she left for
the United States on a Portuguese
liner. At the Azores 155 American
merchant mariners and Navy men
who had been torpedoed, were taken \
aboard. After the ship had been j
cleared by the Germans to the U- I
boat packs they left, and arrived in 1
the United States two weeks later.
Gets Stanford Job
Mrs. Heymans rested in New York :
for two weeks then came to San
Francisco to visit relatives. Finding j
that no work was available was dis- I
heartening, she told, but then "the
miracle" happened. She received a I
call from the Netherlands Informa- '

tion Office —a request to teach the
Dutch language to Army students in
training at Stanford.
"I can only thank my boys for
being willing to learn the Dutch
language." she said, "for I know
that you Americans are going to
Holland and the Dutch Indies after
the war to help my people.
"I see how these men are being
trained, the care and expense and
thought that goes into their training
and I know you will help my people.
I can only thank you, and plunge
myself into my work."
For Mrs. Heymans has another
reason to work and to work hard.
On Oct. 25, 1943, a terse cable notified
her of the death of her son in Can
ada, a member of the RCAF.
(Editor's Note: Mrs. Heymans will
speak on the Dutch underground to
morrow at 4:.'}o p.m. at the "Y" rooms
of the Women's Clubhouse.)
