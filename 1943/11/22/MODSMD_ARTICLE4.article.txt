# Contributions To War Fund Over $2,000
## 
### 
As the War Chest Drive among
Stanford students draws to a finish,
contributions have reached a total
of $2,135.60, with $445 of this prom
ised in pledges, according to Janet
Hale, chairman of finance.
Outstanding in its approach to the
four dollar per person goal is Roble,
where almost all corridors have con
tributed 100 per cent. Not far behind
is Lagunita, where Casas Naranja,
Magnolia, and Granada, have do
nated or pledged 100 per cent.
Four sororities have already co
operated 100 per cent: Theta, Gamma
Phi, A.O.Pi, and Alpha Phi. D.G. has
almost reached this goal. Of the
seven men's halls that have reported
their campaign, only Lincoln Hall
has succeeded in getting 100 per
cent cooperation.
Peg McClean, co-chairman of the
drive in Union residence and units,
reports that 100 per cent contribu
tions, although all of them do not
amount to four dollars per person,
have been received from all of Union
residence and Hawthorne, Manzanita,
Mariposa, The Oaks, and Hilltop.
Only Pat Meyer's floor in the resi
dence obtained four dollars from
each girl.
All solicitors' reports are due to
day, and must be turned in to Miss
Hale.
