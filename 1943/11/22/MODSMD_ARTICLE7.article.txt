PACIFIC FLEET HEADQUARTERS, PEARL HARBOR, T.H., Nov. 21 —
U.S. Marines and soldiers, opening the long awaited offensive again*!
Japan mid-Pacific strongholds guarding the road to Tokyo, invaded Makin
and Tarawa atolls in the Gilbert Islands at dawn Saturday and hand to
hand fighting was believed underway today as the Americans fought to

'extend their beachheads.
Nimitz Announces Invasion
The invasion, first of the war
against the hundreds of coral islands
forming Japan's easternmost Pacific
ramparts, was announced at 11 a.m.
by Admiral Chester W. Nimitz, Pa
cific Fleet commander, who has been
predicting for several weeks that the
Japanese soon would be dug from
their island positions.
Nimitz announced that more than
24 hours after the invasion began
doughboys and devil dogs were bat
tling the Japanese on the beaches of
Makin and Tarawa and in the coco
nut groves, fighting side by side, as
they are 1,500 miles southwest oil
Bougainville Island.
Marines First Ashore
It was believed that Marines led
the way ashore at Makin the
Americans met only "moderate"
Japanese resistance. At Tarawa,
composed of nine large islands and
numerous small ones which ring a
large lagoon, "strong resistance" was
met.
Four-engined Liberator bombers
of the U.S. Seventh Air Force, which
had struck six straight days at the
Marshall and Gilbert islands last
] week along with one carrier-based
j raid in pre-invasion softening-up as
saults, joined the invasion with di
versionary attacks on the Marshall
Islands.
Liberators Bomb Marshalls
The Liberators dumped tons of
bombs on unspecified targets in th<;
Marshalls, 270 miles north of the
Gilberts, in an apparent smash to
prevent Japanese fighters and bomb
ers from winging southward to the
invasion area.
While the Liberators were blasting
their targets to the north, the in
vasion barges and landing craft were
putting away from transports and
sneaking their way ashore.
Nimitz announced that the Amer
icans established beachheads on both
atolls, indicating they might have
swarmed ashore at a number o£
points.
