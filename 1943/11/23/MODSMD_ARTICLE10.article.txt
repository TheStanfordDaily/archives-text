# Sokol Analyzes Pacific War
## 
### Nada Skidmore 
The United States attack on the
Gilbert Islands is but a diversion: a
minor part of the United States'
major offensive in the Pacific, ac
cording to Anthony E. Sokol, assist
ant director of the Far Eastern Lan
guage and Area program at Stanford,
and instructor in courses of naval
history.
Mr. Sokol sees our present actions
in the Pacific as being divided into
two main objectives. The first ob
jective is to cut the Japanese lifelines
of supply which reach to their out
posts in southeastern Asia and to the
Pacific islands under their control.
This may be accomplished by estab
lishing a base either at Guam, Palau,
Truk, or in the Carolines: and driv
ing from that base to the Philippines

where the Japanese lifeline could be
i cut. The offensive would have the
! further advantage of re-establishing
! direct connection with China for re
j inforcement.
Diversions Important
Mr. Sokol stated that the second of
i these principal objectives consists of
i "feints and diversions in order to
| draw attention from our main line
' of attack." It is also an endeavor to
i draw the Japanese fleet out into the
;open.
Mr. Sokol has coined a phrase,
"sphere of superiority" to describe
| the areas near warring nations which
give them military advantage be
cause of their proximity to supply
i bases and relative superiority in de
; fensive weapons. This phrase is ap
| plicable to the situation in the Pacific

| where the two nations are each try
ing to force a battle within their own
spheres of superiority.
Mentions Contrast
There is a contrast between the
Solomon Islands campaign and the
new development in the Gilberts, in
that the Solomons lie along the main
line of attack and the Gilberts are
more on the periphery. According to
Mr. Sokol, this indicates that the
new attack is a diversion and thus
part of the second objective.
As a phophecy for those who look
to the future, Mr. Sokol concludes,
I"I do not believe that the Japanese
j fleet will come out and fight until we
approach their last line of outer de
fense â€”which is either Guam, Yap.
Palou, or the Philippine Islands. If
they do not come out then, they are
licked anyway."
