# Army Collects Talent For Gaieties' Success
## 
### Ellen Marcus 
If the Gaieties is the hit it is ex
pected to be, then it's '"Thanks to the
Yanks"; for without the help of some
20 to 30 of Stanford's soldier-stu
dents, the show would surely be of
inferior quality due to the lack of
civilian talent. Soldiers have assisted
Technical Director Mootte Faris in
building and painting the sets, arc
helping Cecilia Bergeda with the
lights, have written and arranged a
large portion of the music, and are
singing, dancing, and acting in the
show itself.
Claude Wilson, formerly of the
Harvard Graduate School of Busi
ness and now in the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business, is responsible
for the catchy opener, "Be Happy,"
and is directing and leading the
Gaieties orchetsra. Two of his other
compositions, "Jericho" and "Ten
Bucks and Twenty - Four - Hour
Leave" will also be previewed in the

show. "Jericho" is a smooth, haunt
ing number which Janice Shaugh
nessy will .sing. "Ten Bucks and
Twenty-Four-Hour Leave" has a
Harlem swing to it and will be the
music to one of the dances arranged
by Miss Shaughnessy and Mrs.
Jacqueline Poley-Ogg.
Army Orchestrates
Wilson and another Harvard man,
Charles Reeder, are doing all the
orchestrations for the Gaieties. While
attending the "Stanford of the East,"
two men wrote the music and
did the orchestrations for a student
show similar to the Gaieties. Reeder
had also done arranging for small
dance bands while attending Ohio
State University, and will play the
piano in the Gaieties band.
Two other outstanding khaki
members of the band are Don 'Mar
vel, guitar, and Tommy Farr,
trumpet. Marvel hails from South
Bend, Ind., where he played the
guitar and the electric guitar for
small orchestras.
Fair has played professionally
with Tony Pastor and Woody Her
man, from whose band he was
drafted several months ago. For
merly he had appeared with college
bands at North Carolina University,
where many of the present day pop
ular musicians come from, including
Kay Kyser. Fair soloed on the Decca
recording of "I'll Pray for You"
while he was with Pastor, and on
"There Will Never Be Another You"
with Herman.
Army Gives Dancers
Taking the honors for dancing in
the Gaieties will be Bob Fuller, who
has danced professionally at the
"Raven Club" in Chicago and in
night clubs in Dallas and Houston.
Fuller will do a waltz with Cecilia
Bergeda in the number, "Cabernet
and Candlelight," a rumba with
Jackie Poley-Ogg, and a boogie
woogie with Janice Shaughnessy.
Gene May, who attended USC be
fore he went into the Army, has col
laborated with Dan Shannon on a
skit entitled "Strictly G.1." and will
appear in a few of the skits. He is
also director of the G.I. show which
was given last night for Co. A. May
has worked for M.G.M., singing with
the studio orchesrta in many pic
tures, including "Best Foot For
ward," and for Twentieth-Century
Fox singing in the musical comedy,
"Springtime in the Rockies." He has
also sung over the Columbia Broad
casting System.

Fair has played professionally

man, from whose band he was
drafted several months ago. For
merly he had appeared with college
bands at North Carolina University,
where many of the present day pop
ular musicians come from, including
Kay Kyser. Fair soloed on the Decca

Army Gives Dancers
Taking the honors for dancing in
the Gaieties will be Bob Fuller, who
has danced professionally at the
"Raven Club" in Chicago and in
night clubs in Dallas and Houston.
Fuller will do a waltz with Cecilia
Bergeda in the number, "Cabernet
and Candlelight," a rumba with

Gene May, who attended USC be
fore he went into the Army, has col

the studio orchesrta in many pic
tures, including "Best Foot For
ward," and for Twentieth-Century
Fox singing in the musical comedy,
"Springtime in the Rockies." He has
also sung over the Columbia Broad
casting System.
If the Gaieties is the hit it is ex
pected to be, then it's '"Thanks to the
Yanks"; for without the help of some
20 to 30 of Stanford's soldier-stu
dents, the show would surely be of
inferior quality due to the lack of
civilian talent. Soldiers have assisted
Technical Director Mootte Faris in
building and painting the sets, arc
helping Cecilia Bergeda with the
lights, have written and arranged a
large portion of the music, and are
singing, dancing, and acting in the
show itself.
Claude Wilson, formerly of the
Harvard Graduate School of Busi
ness and now in the Stanford Gradu
ate School of Business, is responsible
for the catchy opener, "Be Happy,"
and is directing and leading the
Gaieties orchetsra. Two of his other
compositions, "Jericho" and "Ten
Bucks and Twenty - Four - Hour
Leave" will also be previewed in the

show. "Jericho" is a smooth, haunt
ing number which Janice Shaugh
nessy will .sing. "Ten Bucks and
Twenty-Four-Hour Leave" has a
Harlem swing to it and will be the
music to one of the dances arranged
by Miss Shaughnessy and Mrs.
Jacqueline Poley-Ogg.
Army Orchestrates
Wilson and another Harvard man,
Charles Reeder, are doing all the
orchestrations for the Gaieties. While

did the orchestrations for a student
show similar to the Gaieties. Reeder
had also done arranging for small
dance bands while attending Ohio
State University, and will play the
piano in the Gaieties band.
Two other outstanding khaki
members of the band are Don 'Mar
vel, guitar, and Tommy Farr,
trumpet. Marvel hails from South
