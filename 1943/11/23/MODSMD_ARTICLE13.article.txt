# Formal To Be Held By Lagunita, Union
## 
### 
"Arabian Nights" will be the
theme of the Lagunita-Union formal
dance to be held on Saturday, Dee.
11.
This theme was chosen after sev
eral meetings of the various com
mittee heads with the dance com
mittee chairman for Lagunita, Ev
elyn Jackson; and the Union chair
man, Marjory Troy.
Those who favored a Mexican
Christmas theme were finally won
over to the Arabian Nights idea
when they saw its many possibilities
for decoration and entertainment.
The "ticket-bids" will be sold to
Lagunita and Union in advance,
from Nov. 29 to Dec. 6, because of the
necessity of limiting the number to
400 couples. From the 6th on they
will be sold to the rest of the cam
pus women.
