U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HEADQUARTERS, PEARL HARBOR—American
Marines and infantrymen have landed on Abemama atoll in the Gilberts
and are improving their positions on the Makin and Tarawa atolls against
desperate Japanese resistance, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz announced in a
communique today.
It was disclosde that Lieut. Col. James Roosevelt, eldest son of the Presi-

dent, and his Marine raiders are in
the Makin attack, aiding Army forces
to clean out the Japanese from
strongly entrenched positions.
At their three invasion points, the
Marines and infantrymen were driv
ing in from beachheads under close
range Japanese artillery fire, digging
out the Japanese defenders.
News was expected at any time
that the invasion of the enemy de
fense fringe had been extended to
other islands in the Gilberts.
The Abemama atoll where the new
landing was made, is circular in
shape, and 80 miles south of Tarawa.
It is the most southerly of the Amer
ican beachheads.
Nimitz' first communique since his
announcement Sunday night that the
Gilberts had been invaded disclosed
that the intrepid Marines, veterans of
Guadalcanal, made the Gilberts
landing aided by troops of the 27th
Infantry Division, largely made up
of New Yorkers.
As the Marines and infantrymen
battled the Japanese, Army Lib
erator bombers continued their di
versional attacks on the heavily de
fended Marshall Islands north of the
Gilberts, a possible early American
objective.
