With the football season rapidly
approaching the end of the trail, let's
look back and see how the former
Farm athletes shined during the 1943
season.
Not much has bene heard from the
many Stanford students now in the
Rockies at Colorado College. Ask
them about football, though, and
they will tell you that the best player
in that area was Willard "Rock"
Sheller, former Stanford halfback
who played two games this season
for C.C. If he wasn't injured in the
second game of the season, there is
no doubt in the minds of Colorado
sportswriters that Rock would have
been a cinch bet for all-American
honors. Sheller was that outstand
ing. Reports from that sector point
him out as the outstanding back
since Whizzer White. Here is what
one vvriter thought of him: ''For the
rest of this year and next year and
for a long time after that, wherever
local grid-lovers congregate, the
name 'Rock Sheller' will be men
tioned again and again. For Sheller
contributed something to the grid
sport that isn't quickly forgotten. He
was a great line-plunger, a good
kicker, a tough man to tackle, a
beautiful tackier himself, and an ex
pert blocking back. These are the
qualities that gained him fame in a
few short weeks on the gridiron." A
tribute to a ball player!
The outstanding Stanford product
on the West Coast this season has
been Hank Norberg, now playing end
for the March Field Flyers. Hank
has been a demon on defense, stop
ping all plays coming his way plus
several not in his territory. His pass
catching has been nothing short of
sensational. Norberg has been play
ing the best ball of his career for the
Flyers, and when time comes for
mentioning all-Coast teams, Hank is
almost a certainty to be put at one
of the end posts.
Freddy Meyer, another former
Stanford end, has been a shining
light in the offense of the cadet
eleven of the Del Monte Pre-Flight
ers.
Those are just the outstanding
names to be heard this season. The
California and UCLA players for
merly of Stanford are too numerous
to mention again, but each plaj'er
was a* Stanford man to be proud of.

was a* Stanford man to be proud of.
With the football season rapidly
approaching the end of the trail, let's
look back and see how the former
Farm athletes shined during the 1943
season.
Not much has bene heard from the
many Stanford students now in the
Rockies at Colorado College. Ask
them about football, though, and
they will tell you that the best player
in that area was Willard "Rock"
Sheller, former Stanford halfback
who played two games this season
for C.C. If he wasn't injured in the
second game of the season, there is
no doubt in the minds of Colorado
sportswriters that Rock would have
been a cinch bet for all-American
honors. Sheller was that outstand
ing. Reports from that sector point
him out as the outstanding back
since Whizzer White. Here is what
one vvriter thought of him: ''For the
rest of this year and next year and
for a long time after that, wherever
local grid-lovers congregate, the
name 'Rock Sheller' will be men
tioned again and again. For Sheller
contributed something to the grid
sport that isn't quickly forgotten. He
was a great line-plunger, a good
kicker, a tough man to tackle, a
beautiful tackier himself, and an ex
pert blocking back. These are the
qualities that gained him fame in a
few short weeks on the gridiron." A
tribute to a ball player!
The outstanding Stanford product
on the West Coast this season has
been Hank Norberg, now playing end
for the March Field Flyers. Hank
has been a demon on defense, stop
ping all plays coming his way plus
several not in his territory. His pass
catching has been nothing short of
sensational. Norberg has been play
ing the best ball of his career for the
Flyers, and when time comes for
mentioning all-Coast teams, Hank is
almost a certainty to be put at one
of the end posts.
Freddy Meyer, another former
Stanford end, has been a shining
light in the offense of the cadet
eleven of the Del Monte Pre-Flight
ers.
Those are just the outstanding
names to be heard this season. The
California and UCLA players for
merly of Stanford are too numerous
to mention again, but each plaj'er
was a* Stanford man to be proud of.
