# Don't Put Off Until Tomorrow

### 
LAST week a letter was sent out by the members of the Schol
arship Committee giving their views on incompletes. The
letter stated that all incompletes were regarded as failures by
the committee until made up.
This may not be new information to some, but perhaps it is
to those new to Stanford this quarter. This ruling means that
everyone should think twice before taking an incomplete unless
it is absolutely essential and going home for the holidays is not
considered essential.
The final schedule this quarter, coming as it does between
Christmas and New Year, may tempt some to put off examina
tions until next quarter. We would all like to be with our families
over the holidays, but we must remember that these are not usual
times. A desire to go home is not an essential reason for an in
complete.
Another reason for finishing each course in the quarter it is
taken is the heavy teaching load carried by the instructing staff
at present. This means it will be doubly hard for the incomplete
student to make up his work along with the rest of his own ac
celerated program. —Esther Belew
