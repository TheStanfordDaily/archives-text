### United Press 
WASHINGTON — House demo
cratic leaders today decided to seek
final vote tomorrow on disputed
legislation to ban food subsidies de
spite the sudden death of the two
principal opponents of the adminis
tration program, repx - esentatives
Henry B. Steagall (D„ Ala.), and J.
William Ditter (R., Penn.).
The house is expected to admin
ister emphatic defeat to the subsidy
program when the issue comes up
tomorrow. The ban is attached to a
measure extending the life of the
Commodity Credit Corporation and
would rule out all subsidies after
Jan. 1.
AFL President William Green
urged the house to keep subsidies
alive. In a letter to democratic lead
ers he said farmers were willing to
accept them during peacetime and
should therefore agree to them now.
