To the Editor:
NEWSPAPER proofreaders—a race of gremlins, charged with
the sabotage of the printed word—walk in peril of their lives
since a line from Bill Rose's column, carelessly omitted from
Thursday's Daily, appeared to haunt the guilty typesetter in the
Friday edition.
(The "guilty typesetter" denies all.—Etaoin Shrdlu.)
The missing line—"ing from a nervous breakdown. I just
heard a waitress was"—had evidently been hurled at the office
cat by your lighthearted typesetter, who little realized that his
playful disregard of other people's prose was in effect a last
straw, charged with dynamite.
(Accused again, I deny it again.—Etaoin Shrdlu. 1
We can well imagine intrepid Mr. Rose, stripped to the waist,
diving into the guicksands of the Shack's discarded copy, to
reappear on Friday, holding .the missing line firmly between his
teeth.
(Could be.—Et.)
Bravo, Rose. Newspaper offices across the land will soon
resound to the shrill cries of litterateurs, rummaging and re
trieving fragments of imperishable prose, cast aside or considered
insignificant by dipsomaniac proofreaders. The millenium is at
hand when the proofreader will have to abandon his crossword
puzzle and read his copy.
This, of course, calls for a new race of proofreaders, since it
is believed that the existing species is apt to be struck blind by
the printed word.
Without regretting for a moment his departure, let us salute
the passing of the familiar news office character. He had his
faults, but he has also contributed some classic lines to English
literature, among which we must not overlook "ing from a
nervous breakown. I just heard a waitress was." Handsome
prose, Mr. Rose, with a fine Chaucerian ring to it, which might
have passed unnoticed but for the absentmindedness of a whim
sical proofreader.

tween "Columnists" Valcourt and Rose?—Et Shrdlu.,
