# Anti-Subsidy Bill Opposed
## 
### 
Dr. Joseph S.' Davis, director of
Stanford's Food Research Institute,
in an interview concerning the anti
subsidy bill now being introduced in
Congress, stated that subsidies, wise
ly applied, would be valuable in a
sound food program.
"The cost-of-living subsidy is a
device that should not be denied the
Administration, but it should be used
sparingly as well as judiciously," Dr.
Davis states in his booklet, "War
time Food Management," published
in the August issue of the Economic
Sentinel. "There is unfortunately no
prospect that subsidies will be spar
ingly and judiciously used," the
booklet went on to say.
The conflict has arisen between the
farmers, who are demanding an in
increase in prices, and the wage
earners, who demand a lower cost of
living. President Roosevelt is urging
subsidy payments to insure that re
tail food prices can be reduced and
kept from rising. To do this for each
and every food, Dr. Davis says,
would be extremely costly. Accord
ing to him, subsidies should not be
applied to products in or near the
luxury class, such as meats and but
ter, and should be applied to more
essential foods, such as flour and
bread, only in combination with
other methods of reducing.
Subsidies have become a vital part
of the food programs in Great Britain
and Canada, and have been helpful
in checking inflation without impos
ing heavy fiscal burdens, declared
Dr. Davis. If subsidies could be used
to bring about an intelligently di
rected readjustment of prices, Dr.
Davis believes they would be worth
while in solving the present problem.
