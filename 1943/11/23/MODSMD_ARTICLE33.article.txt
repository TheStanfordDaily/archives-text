# British Aegean Push Failure, Say Nazis
## 
### 
LONDONâ€”The German radio said
that Samos fell to Nazi invasion
forces today and the silence with
which official quarters received the
enemy claim indicated that Britain's
bid to crack the Nazis' Aegean de
fense ring had met final defeat.
Due to overwhelming German
aerial superiority in the area, the fall
of Samos had been virtually a fore
gone conclusion since the Germans
captured Lero to the south last
week.
