# No Incompletes To Vacationers
## 
### 
The Committee on Scholarship an
nounced yesterday that it does not
consider absence from final exam
inations in any course because the
student desires to be home for the
holidays as an adequate reason for
j requesting an incomplete in his
| work.
Students Reminded
J. B. Wells, chairman of the com
mittee, reminded students that an
j incomplete is considered a minus or
failure when grade point records are
compiled until it is made up and then
a grade is given only if the work
. which has been done is entirely sat
| isfactory.
| Incompletes are granted for per
j sonal illness, illness in the family,
I and those few additional cases con
sidered by the instructor as "un
-1 questionably justified."
Osborne Quoted
In regard to changes in the exam
| ination schedules, G. E. Osborne,
chairman of the Committee on Ex
aminations and Schedules, said:
"No individual instructor has the
power to give a student permission
to take a final early or to change the
time of the examination from the
time scheduled by the committee."
Mr. Osborne explained that a stu
dent must petition the committee if
he wishes to have the time of his ex
{ animation changed.
Policy Rigid
"The policy of the committee in
! granting such petitions is rigid." he
! said; ''we will grant them in general
j only in cases concerning the exam
! ination schedule itself, such as con-
I flicts of time or three finals on one
! day."
