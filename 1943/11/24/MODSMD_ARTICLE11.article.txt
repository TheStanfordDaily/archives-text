Mrs, Helene Heymans, A.S.T.P.
instructor in the Dutch language,
who worked for 27 months with the
underground in Unocupied France
and more recently as secretary of
the Dutch legation at Lisbon, spoke
to the Y.W.C.A. World AfTairs and
Race Relations groups yesterday af
ternoon about her experiences and
her knowledge of the conditions in
Prance, Holland and Belgium.
'"The spirit of the Dutch people is
marvelous," stated Mrs. Heymans.
'People who had not known each
other before are now helping each
other in all possible ways. The 20
newspapers published regularly by
the anti-Nazi factions in Holland
and the distribution of news derived
from hidden radios are the prime
factors in sustaining the morals of
the people."
rood Waste Appalling
Since her arrival in New York
six weeks ago Mrs. Heymans said
that, she had been deeply shocked to
•observe the waste of food in the
cafeterias and restaurants, because
'people in Europe would climb the
Himalayas for one piece of bread.
Each person in Holland is allowed
one egg a month, a half pint of
skimmed milk each week, and ex
tremely small amounts of meat and
vegetables. The Germans have con
fiscated nearly all the available
food."
Concentration Camp Seen
Mrs. Heymans described the con-

I eventration camp in Fiance to which
she frequently had access. The
; camp, surrounded by electrified
j barbed wire, consisted of wooden
barracks without windows or heat
j in which GO and 80 people were
I crowded. The prisoners lie on filthy
j straw, without covering and often
I clad only in newspapers, according
to Mrs. Hey mans. In one mottth last
winter, 15,000 died from cold and
hunger.
70 Men Saved
In recounting her personal ad
ventures, Mrs. Heymans told of
: helping eight Dutch boys to escape
| the concentration camp in the guise
'of nurses. In order to enter the
camp, Mrs. Heymans had to pretend
that she was the fiancee of eight
different prisoners. At times the
i bribe of a chicken or a dozen eggs
would save a life. In all, she has
i saved 70 men rfom the death that
| awaited them in the camp."I was
j very, very lucky," she said.
In quoting an official report, Mrs.
Heymans said that 3,000,000 people
had been killed in the poison gas
chambers of Poland to which Jews
| and prisoners have been deported
from time to time.
Quakers' Work Praised
Mrs. Heymans highly praised the
j work of the Quakers in the occupied

countries. They have provided all
the hospitals of Free France and
have sent food, bedding, clothing,
«nd medical supplies to the suffer
ing people. She also mentioned the
line work of the Swiss Red Cross
in aiding the children of these coun
tries.
