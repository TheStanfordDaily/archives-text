# Holiday Rush Begins Early At Bookstore
## 
### 
The Christmas season is already
running rampant at the Stanford
Bookstore; in fact, the old atmos
phere of autumn has been replaced
by holiday decorations meant to be
guile the student into doing most of
his shopping on the campus this year.
However, the Bookstore has been
hit by war shortages to the extent
that shoppers are warned, "There is
a shortage of everything." Twenty
per cent of last year's purchases is
the present allotment, and the Book
store is on a strict quota basis in
maintaining their stock.
This week the store has received
a shipment of books termed "splendid
stock" by attendants. All the best
sellers are included. These books are
in demand and should be bought be
tween now and Dec. 1 since the ma
jor publishers are closing their ship
ping rooms from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1.
There is a possibility that many best
sellers will not be reprinted until
next year which indicates that good
books will be scarce by the end of
the holiday season.
The Bookstore is offering a varied
line of Christmas cards, including
specially made Stanford cards, but
the deadline has passed for ordering
personalized cards.
The famous "Little Indian," fabric
doll which Jack Dixon designed and
manufactured, is a war casualty. His
manufacture and the manufacture of
Stanford metal bookends. ash-trays,
and plaques have been discontinued
for the duration of the war.
The popular items for the Army
are books of almost any type, ac
cording to Bookstore attendants. The
soldiers have depleted the poetry
shelf and have bought humorous
books as fast as the store can supply
them. They also demand children's
books to send to their younger rela
tives at home, to the extent that the
store recommends early shopping for
juvenile books as presents this year.
The Bookstore advises students
that shipments of more than one
book to persons in the Army outside
the boundaries of the United States
having an A.P.O. address, are re
stricted to those given special per
mission by specific request. Persons
in the Navy or Marine Corps may
receive any number of books without
restrictions.

sellers are included. These books are
in demand and should be bought be
tween now and Dec. 1 since the ma
jor publishers are closing their ship
ping rooms from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1.
There is a possibility that many best
sellers will not be reprinted until
next year which indicates that good
books will be scarce by the end of
the holiday season.
The Bookstore is offering a varied
line of Christmas cards, including
specially made Stanford cards, but
the deadline has passed for ordering
personalized cards.
The famous "Little Indian," fabric
doll which Jack Dixon designed and
manufactured, is a war casualty. His
manufacture and the manufacture of
Stanford metal bookends. ash-trays,
and plaques have been discontinued
for the duration of the war.
The popular items for the Army
are books of almost any type, ac
cording to Bookstore attendants. The
soldiers have depleted the poetry
shelf and have bought humorous
books as fast as the store can supply
them. They also demand children's
books to send to their younger rela
tives at home, to the extent that the
store recommends early shopping for
juvenile books as presents this year.
The Bookstore advises students
that shipments of more than one
book to persons in the Army outside
the boundaries of the United States
having an A.P.O. address, are re
stricted to those given special per
mission by specific request. Persons
in the Navy or Marine Corps may
receive any number of books without
restrictions.
The Christmas season is already
running rampant at the Stanford
Bookstore; in fact, the old atmos
phere of autumn has been replaced
by holiday decorations meant to be
guile the student into doing most of
his shopping on the campus this year.
However, the Bookstore has been
hit by war shortages to the extent
that shoppers are warned, "There is
a shortage of everything." Twenty
per cent of last year's purchases is
the present allotment, and the Book
store is on a strict quota basis in
maintaining their stock.
This week the store has received
a shipment of books termed "splendid
stock" by attendants. All the best
sellers are included. These books are
in demand and should be bought be
tween now and Dec. 1 since the ma
jor publishers are closing their ship
ping rooms from Dec. 10 to Jan. 1.
