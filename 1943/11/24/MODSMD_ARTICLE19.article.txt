# Members of Armed Forces See Movies Thursday, Friday
## 
### 
G.I. movies for members of the armed forces only are now shown each
Thursday and Friday at Memorial Theater. There are two showings each
day, the first being at 1715 and the second at 1815.
Special short subjects, travelogs, foreign films, educational subjects, song

shorts, sport shorts, and information
films procured from civilian sources
are shown.
The purpose of these films is to in
form the soldier on current events
by increasing his understanding and
knowledge of history, institutions,
peoples, customs, resources, and
terrain of the world at war; to pro
vide a supplementary movie service
in those commands which cannot be
served with standard, paid-admission
film entertainment; and to provide a
means for non-compulsory showings
of orientation films and other edu
cational productions.
A program was presented last
week which included showings of the
Allied landings on Sicily and Italy.
