# C.I. GAIETIES
## Gaieties Tickets Go On Sale Monday on English Corner 
### Ellen Marcus 
At 8 Monday morning tickets for
the '43 Gaieties will go on sale on
English Corner (otherwise known as
History Corner). Salesgirls working
under Dramatic Manager Catherine
Thomas will be on hand from then
until noon, and from 1 until 4:30 in
the afternoon. After that, theater
goers will have to buy their tickets
at the ASSU office which will sell
them Tuesday, Wednesday, Thurs
day, and Friday from 9 to 12 and
from 1 to 5, and on Saturday morn
ing from 9 to 12.
Tickets will also be on sale at the
box office on the nights of the per
formances, Friday and Saturday,
Dec. 3 and 4.
Since 1898, the Gaieties (formerly
preceded by the prefix "Big Game")
has been an annual production, a
very essential part of the pre-Big
Game festivities. It is the oldest an
nual Stanford show and in its 45
years has exhibited the work of

many now-famous personalities in
cluding Lloyd Nolan, John Steinbeck,
Maxwell Anderson, Doodles Weaver,
and authors who have since been
employed as script writers in Holly
wood. One of these script writers,
Jim Gunn, recently wrote the movie
script for "Lady of Burlesque."
The Gaieties has always been pre
sented by Ram's Head, while the
Spring Shows and One-Acts were
formerly produced by Barnstormers.
Swords and Sandals, Masquers,
Barnstormers, and Ram's Head were
all competing honorary dramatic so
cieties until 1937 when they were
merged into the now-existing Ram's
Head.
Swords and Sandals was founded
in 1893, two years after the Univer
sity's founding, as a society for men
only, as there were very few women
on the Farm at that date. Fifteen
years later, in 1908, the number of
women was augmented enough to
start a feminine group which was
known as the Masquers. In 1936, the
Barnstormers was formed for the
purpose of presenting Stanford talent
to the other California colleges and
to cities and towns throughout the
state. The original Ram's Head
started in 1911 as a strictly masculine
organization.
Originally Gaieties, as well as all
Stanford productions, were given in
the Assembly Hall which is now The
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. The Memorial Auditorium was
built in 1937, and at that time was
the finest constructed theater on the
West Coast, having the very latest
type of stage facilities, lighting, and
sound equipment.
Present members of Ram's Head
are Moofie Faris, president; Nan
Tillson, vice-president; Jane Spauld
ing, secretary - treasurer; Tommy
Thomas, dramatic manager; and Ann
Simons, Paula Kanner, Jane Glasson,
Mary Lou LLindsley, Wylie Hart
man, B. J. Tweedy, Peggy Fitts,
Bette Lee Scott, Margaret Morgan,
Janice Shaughnessy, Gloria Olivi. A 1

Since 1898, the Gaieties (formerly
preceded by the prefix "Big Game")
has been an annual production, a
very essential part of the pre-Big
Game festivities. It is the oldest an
nual Stanford show and in its 45
years has exhibited the work of

many now-famous personalities in
cluding Lloyd Nolan, John Steinbeck,
Maxwell Anderson, Doodles Weaver,
and authors who have since been
employed as script writers in Holly
wood. One of these script writers,
Jim Gunn, recently wrote the movie
script for "Lady of Burlesque."
The Gaieties has always been pre
sented by Ram's Head, while the
Spring Shows and One-Acts were
formerly produced by Barnstormers.
Swords and Sandals, Masquers,
Barnstormers, and Ram's Head were
all competing honorary dramatic so
cieties until 1937 when they were
merged into the now-existing Ram's
Head.
Swords and Sandals was founded
in 1893, two years after the Univer
sity's founding, as a society for men
only, as there were very few women
on the Farm at that date. Fifteen
years later, in 1908, the number of
women was augmented enough to
start a feminine group which was
known as the Masquers. In 1936, the
Barnstormers was formed for the
purpose of presenting Stanford talent
to the other California colleges and
to cities and towns throughout the
state. The original Ram's Head
started in 1911 as a strictly masculine
organization.
Originally Gaieties, as well as all
Stanford productions, were given in
the Assembly Hall which is now The
Stanford Graduate School of Busi
ness. The Memorial Auditorium was
built in 1937, and at that time was
the finest constructed theater on the
West Coast, having the very latest
type of stage facilities, lighting, and
sound equipment.
Present members of Ram's Head
are Moofie Faris, president; Nan
Tillson, vice-president; Jane Spauld
ing, secretary - treasurer; Tommy
Thomas, dramatic manager; and Ann
