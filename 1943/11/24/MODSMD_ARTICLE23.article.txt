The eleven soldiers who comprise
;he newly formed Army Student
Council at Stanford hail from seven
states in the Union and the majority
of them are studying engineering
here.
These Army students were elected
by their companies to represent
them at Council meetings to co
ordinate A.S.T. activities between
the Army and the commandant, the
University, and the civilian stu
dents. The council corresponds to
the A.S.S.U. Executive Committee
in most of its functions.
