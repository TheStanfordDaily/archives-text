# Cycling Coeds Lower Morale

### Pvt. Walt Simon 
On arriving at Stanford we were
rather impressed by 4he large num
ber of assorted bicycles on campus.
At first sight we were horrified, for
it seemed that the rah-rah and
blather-skut of sauntering up to a
likely-looking lass who was gaily
tripping from hall to hall would be
almost impossible.
One could imagine himself carry
ing something in the line of cam
pus satire with one of these free
wheeling queens, while propelling
himself at a dead run.
Of course there is always the pos
sibility of hitch-hiking, but a few
of the larger lads could hardly pic
ture themselves comfortably situ
ated in one of those wicker book
baskets.
Then there is the idea of walking
the bicycle for these likely bits of
pulchritude, but this enthralls the
use of energy which is a very es
sential commodity to be used very
sparingly.
Certain factions have suggested
throwing the body 5n front of the
rider, but this places the throwee in
a great amount of danger as well as
embarrassment.
Our only good Suggestion is
prompted by one of the better beer
drinking songs, to wit: "Get out and
walk, Mabel."
