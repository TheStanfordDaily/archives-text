# 'At Ease,' Sgt. Gaston Valcourt

### 
Judging by a sneak preview of i
Stanford's G.I. Gaieties, for which i
Miss Jean Levinson has recruited
the cream of A.S.T.P. talent, our
doughboys are going to carry jive
as well as liberty to the unhappy
citizens of Europe. In fact, it looks !
as though an involuntary heritage
of solid swing will be part of the
price of freedom.
According to reports from North I
Africa, Tunisians are already fas- j
cinated by the Yankee melodic id' 1
iom. Arab urchins and dignified
Berbers alike are learning their own '
freely interpreted versions of "Ca- [
sey Jones" and '"Deep in the Heart
of Texas," listen with solemn in- j
terest to the barbershop quartets I
which inevitably crop up whenever j
four rookies get together.
After the last war, the A.E.F. left
their allies, from the Dardanelles to
the Bay of Biscay, thoroughly fa
miliar with '"Eet's a lonk, lonk vay ;
to Teepeerarie," "Keep ze hom feers
bornink" and Peck op yore
troublese een yore old keetbeg."
Now that the tide of battle has re
ceded from the shores of North Af
rica, we can well imagine that the j
muezzin will soon be swinging a j
startlingly different tune from his i

minaret. And, when the doughboys
are eventually withdrawn from a
peaceful Italy, Etruscan chamber
music will doubtless be of the Basin
Street variety.
In candle-lit bars on the Casbah,
groups of majestic Bedouins, clad
in flowing burnooses, are at this
very moment gathered around a
platter of couscous and a bottle of
Enfidaville rotgut, crooning "My
Wild Irish Rose" and "A Beceekla
Beelt for Tow." On street corners,
ragged little slo-eyed nomads har
monize nostalgically, "Carry Me
Back to Old Virginny" and "Beat
Me Daddy, Atotabar," while the
Sultan's daughter is exercising her
tonsils on "Smok Gets een Yore Ice"
at local box-socials.
German forces must be as puzzled
as they were in the last war by the
strange phenomenon of an anny
which bursts into song when the go
ing is toughest. On forced route
marches through parched Italian ra
vines, huddled together like sar
dines in a mile-long convoy, lying
exhausted on the unyielding earth
after strenuous battle maneuvers,
weary American doughboys find a
bang-up community singfest as
stimulating as the Englishman's cup
of tea.

Recognizing the value of song as
a vital morale factor, and perhaps
driven crazy by the average soldier's
extremely limited repertoire, mili
tary authorities have issued an army
songbook, for free distribution to
the armed forces, which reproduces
the music and words of some 70 dif
ferent songs. All the army service
marches are listed in the index,
which also includes—could it be
navy sabotage?—" Anchors Aweigh."
We like the idea of a musically
fastidious army, songbooks in hand
after a harrowing encounter with
the enemy, wafting carefully selected
programs in faultless harmony across
the barren wastes of the Neapolitan
no man's land.
We feel convinced, however, that
American soldiers are not yet ready
for a G.I. Salzburg at the front.
They are more than likely to sell
their books for a song to musically
inclined Italian soldiers or give them
to souvenir-collecting peasants. And
the strains of "I've Been Working on
the Railroad" and "Sweet Adeline,"
sung simultaneously in a dozen dif
ferent keys, will continue to meet
the cannon's x - oar with all the gay,
irresponsible dissonance which sol
diers apparently prefer.
