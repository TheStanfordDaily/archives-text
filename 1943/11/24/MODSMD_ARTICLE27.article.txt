# Army Tells Physical Fitness Averages
## 
### 
The recent physical fitness tests
taken by all the ASTP students here
brought a question to many minds.
"What's the average on this?" was
! asked as a soldier gave his heart and
soul to making himself a cripple till
the muscles unkinked. The Army
Specialized Training Bulletin issued
a short time ago gives a few facts and
figures on these tests.
The first four tests, push-ups,
! squat-jumps, sit-ups, and pull-ups,
| were used to test muscular tone,
: strength, and endurance. The hun-
I dred-yard pick-a-back and 300-yard
I run were designed to test coordina
tion. speed, and wind.
The average of a sample of some
2,577 trainees at various colleges
throughout the nation in their first
test was as follows:
Push-ups, 18; squat-jumps, 30.7;
I sit-ups, 32; pull-ups, 5.5.
After three months a retest showed
I a big difference in scores. Twenty-
I eight per cent was the average im
i provement.
If these percentages of improve
j ment are maintained, they will soon
i be doing the dash in nothing fiat.


THE (>LI> SWIMMING HOLE lias its modern counterpart in the water obstacle pictured. This is but one of
tlie obstacles on the Stanford course which is in use in the Army physical education program here. The
course is designed to develop the upper body.
