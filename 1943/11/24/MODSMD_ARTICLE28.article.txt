## Soldiers Will Donate Blood 
### 
Soldiers on campus will soon have
the opportunity to donate to the Red
Cross Blood Bank. Mr. James M.
Eva, local field director of the
American Red Cross, with the co
operation of Major Tripp, has been
making the arrangements. Sign-up
sheets on each company bulletin
board are filling up with promise of
bringing the list of donors well over
the 125 minimum necessary to bring
the field unit to the campus.
Today blood plasma is on the job
on all fronts. The U.S. Surgeon Gen
eral has attributed the marked de
crease in deaths resulting from
wounds in this war largely to the use
of this blood plasma. Many pints
may be necessary but soldiers' lives
are being saved.
The process of donating blood is
simple and painless, taking only
about 20 minutes. There are nc
harmful after-effects. Soldiers un
der 21 are not required to have
parents' consent as civilians in this
age group are. Eight weeks must
elapse between donations.
