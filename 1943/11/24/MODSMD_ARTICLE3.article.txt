# Victory Book Drive Needs Student Help
## 
### 
The Victory Book Collection has
resulted in the contribution of 53
books and 213 magazines for service
men's libraries in camps, on ships,
and at the battle fronts. This amount
is far below Stanford's quota, ac
cording to Inky Bradley and Mar
tha Stratton, co-chairmen of the
drive.
Bradley blames the small contri
bution on the lack of co-operation
of the living groups. The Alpha Phi
house, however, donated one-third
of all the magazines. "We urge that
the other living groups follow this
example and make an effort to col
lect more reading material," said
Bradley.
Students going home for Thangs
giving are asked to look for old
books and magazines and bring them
back to school. The Victory Book
Collection should not be confused
with the Red Cross collection of
pocket edition books, because the
Victory Book Collection does not
accept pocket editions.
The committee has found that in
many living groups the collection
boxes are being used for waste
paper, and they request that the
more valuable books and magazines
be substituted for this waste paper,
which increases the work of the
collectors.
