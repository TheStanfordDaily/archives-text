The Daily football experts are fac
ing the crucial test this week, with
the final standings of the season de
pending upon how they picked this
week's winners.
The four experts, Don Langendorf,
Roger Corman, Barney Gugel, and
Ed Luce, whose collective average is
.877, are all within .009 of each other
on their individual averages. One
miss this week can mean the differ
ence between first and last place.
The big game of the weekend will
of course be the annual Army-Navy
battle to be played Saturday. The
collective opinion of the experts is
Navy by 3, although Don Langendorf
picks the Army to win by 6.
The experts were also split on the
annual Thanksgiving Day big game
of the Southwestern Conference,
Texas vs. Texas A & M. Three of the
experts picked Texas A & M to win
by 6, while Ed Luce held out for the
Longhorns. According to statistics,
Texas should be slightly favored, but
the Leghorns will have to contend
with the notorious jinx of the Col
lege Station field.
On the other games of the week,
the experts all agree.
Tulsa over Arkansas by 14; Del
Monte Pre-Flight over California by
20, in a walk-away; Pennsylvania
over a scrappy Cornell eleven by 6;
Georgia Tech over Georgia by 18;
lowa Pre-Flight over Minnesota by
14; and Oklahoma over Nebraska by
9.
North Carolina over Virginia by
12; Notre Dame over Great Lakes by
18, possibly more; Southwestern over
Rice by 12; St. Mary's over Utah by
7; USC over UCLA by 18; and
March Field over San Diego Naval
Training Station by 13.
