# Women's Murals End Week's Play
## 
### 
Although a freshman rooting sec
lion gave its full support, 2B or not
2B couldn't quite overcome the
Theta Thrashers in the Tuesday
games of women's intramural vol-
Jeyball. They played a two out of
three game series, Theta winning
15-11, 14-16, and 16-13.
The Et Cetera team played a good
game yesterday with only a six-man
team. They topped the A.O.Pi's 15-9
and 15-4. Among the student players
on the Et Cetera team, Pam Stra-
Ihairn, captain, played a good net
game.
The schedule for Monday, Nov. 29,
is: 1A Aces vs. Pi Phis, Lagunita vs.
Tri Delt, and AAA vs. Roble 3C.
