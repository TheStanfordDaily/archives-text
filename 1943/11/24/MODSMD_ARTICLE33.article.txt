The Stanford mural football world
experienced a series of upsets yes
terday afternoon when Co. L, F.A.
and Co. D defeated favored ball
teams to grab off first and fifth spots
respectively in League B standings.
Co. L, F.A., picked the loser by a
touchdown, defeated Co. E by a
score of 14-6 and put itself into top
place in League B. An error in the
Daily lowered Co. L, F.A.'s official
standing by previously reporting it
solder of only five wins instead of
six.
Co. C & A's loss to Co. D by a
score of 6-2 sent League B's former
second-place holder down to fourth
place, and definitely lowered their
chances for the league championship.
Meanwhile the Fightin' Q.M. came
through in true style by trouncing
The Stoates to the tune of 18-0 and
sending it from sixth to eighth place
in League A standing. The Q.M.'s
I still remain the only undefeated
team in both leagues, having raised
their number of wins from seven to
eight.
