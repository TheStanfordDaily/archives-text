# Plans Made For Service
## 
### 
A Thanksgiving service will be
held for the first time in many years
at Memorial Church at 8 p.m. Thurs
day evening. Unlike former years
when the campus was deserted at
Thanksgiving, there will be many
students, civilian and Army, who
will be here to attend.
The service is arranged for all
faiths. Participating will be Rabbi
Cohn, who will give some ancient
Thanksgiving prayers, a representa
tive of the student cabinet reading
the President's declaration, and Dr.
Trueblood, who will give a brief
address.
Soldier members of the Stanford
choir and band will present Thanks
giving songs which D. Sterling
Wheelwright, acting organict, will
lead from the chancel steps.
Dr. Trueblood will speak at the
regular Sunday morning service on
Nov. 28 at 11 o'clock on "The Re
ligion of Maturity."
The usual Thursday and Sunday
musical hours will not be held on
Nov. 25 and 28, but will be continued
again after Thanksgiving vacation.
