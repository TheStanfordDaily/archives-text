"TARTU"—Starting Thursday at (lie
Stanford Theater
M-G-M must have run out ol
titles when they came around to
"Tartu"—or else they didn't want
the public to know that it was in
for another spy picture. Because
"Tartu" is the name of a Rumanian
Iron Guardist who has been killed
so that the British may send into
the conquered countries one Ter
rence Stephenson, a scientist and
bomb expert, with the passport and
papers of the deceased.
Stephenson, of course, changes his
name to that of Jan Tartu and be
gins his work with the underground.
But before he gets very far he meets
up with Valerie Hobson, a Czech of
royal blood. Together Miss Hobson
and Tartu work with the under
ground against the Germans. There's
the usual amount of hocus-pocus as
Tartu attempts to stay near Miss
Hobson and away from the Nazis.
Robert Donat plays his role in
fine style and helps to carry the film
over its many rough spots. Nothing
very spectacular or different about
"Tartu," but it is passable enter
tainment.
Blonde Mary Beth Hughes has the
starring role in the second feature,
which hears the noncommittal title
of "Melody Parade." Anson Weeks'
and Ted Fio Rito's orchestras pro
vide the music but can't make up for
the flimsy plot. Here's another
strong argument for single features.
