# CAMERA CLUB
## Lagunita Girls Organize Club 
### 
Photography fans at Lagunita have j
recently organized into a coopera- [
tive-plan club, "Cameria," pictures
of interest taken around the campus, !
particularly in Lagunita Court, by '
the girls will be enlarged, mounted, j
and placed on exhibit in the lobby of !
the hall and may be purchased from
the club, according to La Verne !
Bravo, chairman.
Two meetings have so far been
held at which plans were made for
j the functions of the club. The most
important feature is the completely
equipped darkroom located in Casa
Granada of Lagunita and to be used j
exclusively by members of Cameria.
At their meetings the girls ex
change ideas and knowledge per
taining to such things as photo- j
graphic composition, exposures and
timing, and enlarging technique. A j
few of the members have never had i
experience in developing films, mak- j
ing prints, or making enlargements, '
and for them the other girls will J
give instructions. Any girl living at I
Lagunita may join the club; just i
come to the meetings, which are held |
every other Monday evening".
