# Old Stanford Spirit Found At Campus Gas Station
## 
### 
In just as inconspicuous a place as
the campus gas station the old Stan
ford spirit reigns. The manager of
the station is Walter Heinecke, '31,
who played a lot of football here in
1928 and 1929, and now in the era
when he misses the football teams,
perhaps even a little more than the
rest of us, he is making adjustments
to "Stanford at War."
In his student days when 25 to 30
bicycles were the most to be seen on
campus, Mr. Heinecke little thought
that some day his campus station
would be inundated and perplexed
by the repair problems of hundreds
of the hungry - looking victory
models.
He must have his own ideas about
victory though, because he tops off
his job at the campus station from
9 a.m. to 3 p.m. by working with the
Navy Ordnance at Joshua Hendy
Iron Works on the'swing shift, 4:30
to 12 p.m. It seems that Mr. Hci
necke has adjusted both his business
and himself with the "Stanford Goes
to War" spirit.
We all know the traffic situation
but may not have looked at it from
Mr. Heinecke's view. The famed
Stanford belle may be said to have
improved, for after all, how many in
the colorful era of Biff Hoffman
could inflate their own bike tires?
Mr. Heinecke reports that some
coeds still need a little practice
though, for there are times when
l hey can't wait for the attendant to
finish his other work.
Mr. Heinecke was glad to an
nounce that the government has re
scinded a previous order and the
station is now able to get sufficient
gasoline, so that a recurrence of the
gas pump shutdown of a couple of
weeks ago should not happen in the
'uture.
The station takes bike repair work

I in the small time it has left from
I regular work, as a convenience to
students who otherwise would have
to get their bikes to Palo Alto. This
work is definitely condescension to
war time though, and with the added
difficulty of getting part-time work
ers, Mr. Heinecke has his hands full.
Walter Heinecke has managed the
campus gas station since 1935. He
coached football at Menlo Junior
College for awhile, and expects to be
here when there is a football team
tgain.
