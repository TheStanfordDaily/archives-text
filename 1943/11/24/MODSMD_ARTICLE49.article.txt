rn HANKSGIVING. And for what?
X We can be thankful that this year, more
than ever, we are enabled to see the true worth
of things for which we give thanks Thank
ful that we can pass over the material and mo
mentary to perceive the values of this life in
proper perspective.
.... Thankful not just for a year of victories,
but for the individuals who, in earning these
victories, have found the true values in this
world of ours.
.... Thankful for the faith which carries us
through the hours of adversity, for the hope
which lives in our hearts of hours yet to come,
for the charity of souls who forego individual
happiness that men they've never known will
be thankful in years to come.
.... Thankful that this land we love is
saved for us by thousands of our own youth.
.... Thankful that we do with less that those
who fight outside of our country, so bright and
rich and carelessly secure, may have more.
.... Thankful that our men in uniform re
quire full devotion of our thankful hearts now.
. . . . Thankful that they are creating such a
debt that out of our sense of obligation we may
build a world worthy of their sacrifices
Thankful that some can realize that from this
struggle we must secure a world that will
inspire the thanks of millions yet to be.
Thanksgiving. And for all this we give
thanks first to God. Then to our fighting men
and women of America.
