# THE 						ARMY TAKES A TURN
## 
### 
THE fifth page of this issue of The Daily is
the first appearance of The Stanford Daily-
Army Page. This page is written entirely by
members of the training units on campus.
This page is the first complete one of Army
news, although short articles have been pub
lished in previous editions. The soldiers have
organized a group to report their own affairs
and this page is made up of their accumulated
stories.â€”Esther Belew
