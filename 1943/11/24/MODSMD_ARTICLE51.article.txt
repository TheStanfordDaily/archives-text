# A 						Time to Think
## 
### 
WE'RE all busy this quarter. Many of us are
busier now than we've ever been before.
Our lives are definitely more complicated and
require more planning to make them run
smoothly than was necessary a few years back.
Whereas we used to read the daily paper
fairly thoroughly and managed to get in a couple
of weekly magazines besides, we now find
ourselves skimming over the front page, the
funnies, the sports or society sections (depend
ing on the sex), and let our news reading go at
that.
It sems to me we should be getting more
information than can be acquired from these
sources. Of course this is a time for action; but
it is also a time for thought. Things are happen
ing every day which will determine the status
of the world of tomorrow—the world which we
are supposed to lead.
There are questions we should be asking
ourselves—questions more important than "Will
Tracy get Laffy?" "Will Nancy remarry the
Count?" or "Will War Knight take the Meadows
'Cap next Saturday?" It is our duty to give these

other questions a little thought—perhaps even a
litle study.
We students are a very privileged group.
We are allowed to continue our education
because the government feels that what we
learn here will be of value to ourselves and our
fellow men in the world we shall have to build.
Never again will we have such an excellent
opportunity to think about, read about, and dis
cuss the questions we face.
Would an actual alliance with Britain or
Russia or both be wise? What would be the
consequences of electing a President for a
fourth term? What are the chances of a world
federation in the post-war world? How are we
going to handle the racial and social problems
in our country?
These are only a few of the questions we
should be asking ourselves and others. The
success of the Gilberts attack is interesting and
the valor of our push cannot be underestimated,
but we should not let these daily new events
obscure the greater problems that confront us.
It will be our task to solve or attempt to solve
these problems. Whether we succeed or fail
depends largely upon how much we care about
the outcome.—Bill Rose

of weekly magazines besides, we now find
ourselves skimming over the front page, the
funnies, the sports or society sections (depend
ing on the sex), and let our news reading go at
that.
It sems to me we should be getting more
information than can be acquired from these
sources. Of course this is a time for action; but
it is also a time for thought. Things are happen
ing every day which will determine the status
of the world of tomorrow—the world which we
are supposed to lead.
There are questions we should be asking
ourselves—questions more important than "Will
Tracy get Laffy?" "Will Nancy remarry the
Count?" or "Will War Knight take the Meadows
'Cap next Saturday?" It is our duty to give these

other questions a little thought—perhaps even a
litle study.
We students are a very privileged group.
We are allowed to continue our education
because the government feels that what we
learn here will be of value to ourselves and our
fellow men in the world we shall have to build.
Never again will we have such an excellent
opportunity to think about, read about, and dis
cuss the questions we face.
Would an actual alliance with Britain or
Russia or both be wise? What would be the
consequences of electing a President for a
fourth term? What are the chances of a world
federation in the post-war world? How are we
going to handle the racial and social problems
in our country?
These are only a few of the questions we
should be asking ourselves and others. The
success of the Gilberts attack is interesting and
the valor of our push cannot be underestimated,
but we should not let these daily new events
obscure the greater problems that confront us.
It will be our task to solve or attempt to solve
these problems. Whether we succeed or fail
depends largely upon how much we care about
the outcome.—Bill Rose
WE'RE all busy this quarter. Many of us are
busier now than we've ever been before.
Our lives are definitely more complicated and
require more planning to make them run
smoothly than was necessary a few years back.
Whereas we used to read the daily paper
fairly thoroughly and managed to get in a couple
of weekly magazines besides, we now find
ourselves skimming over the front page, the
funnies, the sports or society sections (depend
ing on the sex), and let our news reading go at
that.
