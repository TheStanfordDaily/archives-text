# BULL SESSION

### BILL ROSE 
AS TO that letter (and the accompanying
comments) in yesterday's Campus Opinion
column, all I have to say is that I've got nothing
against Sergeant Valcourt or the typesetter. I
am at peace with the world and wish to remain
so. Besides, should Valcourt and I enter into a
feud, it might develop into one of those painful
Benny-Allen affairs; and I'm afraid I'd be getting
the Benny end of it.
Happy Thanksgiving!
