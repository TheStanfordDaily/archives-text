To the Editor:
WE ALL realize how hard the members of
the Nitery committee worked to make that room
attractive. Now that their job is finished, a new
job has been created which involves every in
dividual on the campus. It is the task of keep
ing the Nitery clean!
Friday night when the Canteen opened, re
marks were made on the wonderful "rejuvena
tion" of the once drab room. But today, exactly
five days later, an outsider would only have to
take one look to marvel at the chaos.
Do you believe this is fair to those people
who gave their time and energy to fix a room
where you could relax and meet your friends?
No, it is not fair. But the solution is simple. If
every individual would take it upon himself to
see that he made proper use of each article in
that room, the Nitery would remain and look as
it did last Friday night.
Otherwise the Nitery might only be open
for student use on weekends when it is super
vised. Think it over—it's up to you!
It's no crime to straighten anything that is
out of place. Perhaps a new slogan should be,
"We Stoop to Conquer!"

that the students are to be allowed opportunity

| Day.
Believe me, we feel keenly Mr. Rose's dis
appointment at being allowed only one home
cooked meal between quarterly vacations. The
only reason our sympathy does not take the
form of visible tears is that we are able to reflect
j on the current Army expression to the effect
