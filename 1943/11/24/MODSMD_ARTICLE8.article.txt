# Hopkins States Coal Situation

### Jean Hanssen 
"The Little Steel Formula per
mits an increase of 15 per cent over
the wages paid on Jan. 1, 1941. It
is based upon the increased cost of
living from Jan. 1, 1941, to June of
1942, at that time a 15 per cent in
crease," said William Hopkins, as
sociate professor of economics.
He added that the Little Steel
Formula had been designed to settle
the Little Steel case and at the time
there was no intention of applying
it to anything else.
The amount of 15 per cent was
selected as appropriate, but since
then there has been an increase in
the cost of living.
Board Breaks Rules
The War Labor Board broke a
couple of its hard and fast rules
when it granted Ickes' request in
behalf of the coal miners. The
Board is now trying to say that the
Little Steel Formula has not been
broken; but by granting the in
crease in wages, they have defeated
the purpose of the Little Sleel For
mula. Until now the Board had re
fused to act until the men had re
turned to work, but in this case the
Board made a nexception. Accord
ing to Professor Hopkins, the Board
claims the strike was considered be
fore the men had returned to work
because coal has become such an
essential wartime industry. By mak
ing tliis exception the Board has
opened the way for further strikes.
Temporary Control Seen
Professor Hopkins believes that
the labor members of the War La
bor Board will try to hold the other
members in line while the situation
concerning the cost of living is in
vestigated. This investigation will
last until January 1. He said, '"If
the cost of living has gone up, and
I think they'll find it has, labor
members will be faced with a di
lemma. They will either have to
break the Little Steel Formula offi
cially, or else a new board will hav,-?
to be formed. I think the Little
Steel Formula is out."
Strikes Threatened
Professor Hopkins does not think
that the steel and automotive indus
tries will strike during the 60-day
period when conditions are being
investigated. The railroads are at
present putting on pressure by
threatening to strike, but this does
not necessarily mean that they will
strike.
"The job of the OPA and the WLB
is to slow down inflation, and if they
manage to keep it down to from 1
to 2 per cent a month, they're doing
well," Hopkins said.
The point should be stressed that
the Little Steel Formula does not
apply to individuals, only to entire
bargain units, according to Profes
sor Hopkins.
Professor Hopkins is connected
with the Regional War Labor Board
in San Francisco where he spends
at least two days a week. During
the summer he was associate re
gional director of the San Francisco
Board.
"The Little Steel Formula per
mits an increase of 15 per cent over
the wages paid on Jan. 1, 1941. It
is based upon the increased cost of
living from Jan. 1, 1941, to June of
1942, at that time a 15 per cent in
crease," said William Hopkins, as

is based upon the increased cost of
living from Jan. 1, 1941, to June of
1942, at that time a 15 per cent in
crease," said William Hopkins, as
sociate professor of economics.
He added that the Little Steel
Formula had been designed to settle
the Little Steel case and at the time
there was no intention of applying
it to anything else.
The amount of 15 per cent was
selected as appropriate, but since
then there has been an increase in
the cost of living.
Board Breaks Rules
The War Labor Board broke a
couple of its hard and fast rules
when it granted Ickes' request in
behalf of the coal miners. The
Board is now trying to say that the
Little Steel Formula has not been
broken; but by granting the in
crease in wages, they have defeated
the purpose of the Little Sleel For
mula. Until now the Board had re
fused to act until the men had re
turned to work, but in this case the
Board made a nexception. Accord
ing to Professor Hopkins, the Board
claims the strike was considered be
fore the men had returned to work
because coal has become such an
essential wartime industry. By mak
ing tliis exception the Board has
opened the way for further strikes.
Temporary Control Seen
Professor Hopkins believes that
the labor members of the War La
bor Board will try to hold the other
members in line while the situation
concerning the cost of living is in
vestigated. This investigation will
last until January 1. He said, '"If
the cost of living has gone up, and
I think they'll find it has, labor
members will be faced with a di
lemma. They will either have to
break the Little Steel Formula offi
cially, or else a new board will hav,-?
to be formed. I think the Little
Steel Formula is out."
Strikes Threatened
Professor Hopkins does not think
that the steel and automotive indus
tries will strike during the 60-day
period when conditions are being
investigated. The railroads are at
present putting on pressure by
threatening to strike, but this does
not necessarily mean that they will
strike.
"The job of the OPA and the WLB
is to slow down inflation, and if they
manage to keep it down to from 1
to 2 per cent a month, they're doing
well," Hopkins said.
The point should be stressed that
the Little Steel Formula does not
apply to individuals, only to entire
bargain units, according to Profes
sor Hopkins.
Professor Hopkins is connected
with the Regional War Labor Board
in San Francisco where he spends
at least two days a week. During
the summer he was associate re
gional director of the San Francisco
Board.
