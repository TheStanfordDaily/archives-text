## 
### 
In a two-hour meeting of the old
and new members of the executive
committee combined with the sol
dier council, the Chaparral, student
magazine, became an official part of
the ASSU.
The constitution of the Chaparral,
presented by its present editor, Doug
Hastings, was approved by Excom
and it was moved that the budget
be approved by the student manager,
Bruce Jessup.
The magazine, however, will still
be edited by members of Hammer
and Coffin, and future editors and
leading staff members will be select
ed from that association.
During the meeting, the date for
the YWCA after-dinner coffee gath

ering on Dec. 8 was approved and a
request by Hayes Hall for a date on
Nov. 27 was canceled.
A report on the Nitery and the
newly formed Canteen was given by
i Carol Hurwitz, chairman of the Can
teen. Miss Hurwitz asked for sug
gestions for methods of keeping the
Nitery clean and it was decided that
a system of coordination between the
students and the soldiers would be
J attempted for that purpose.
Tlie Nitery, however, will remain
open over the Thanksgiving holidays
for the use of soldiers and students
remaining on campus and various
soldier companies will be appointed
for clean-up duty.
The meeting of last night was held
at the home of President Tresidder.
