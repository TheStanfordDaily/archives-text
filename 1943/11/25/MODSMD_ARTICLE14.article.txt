# Lory Broadcast Tells Of Jap Terror Groups
## 
### 
Hillis Lory, author of "Japan's
Military Masters" and lecturer in the
Far Eastern Area school at Stanford,
•spoke of the psychology behind Ja
pan's secret terror societies in the
nationwide broadcast of Pacific Story
last night at 10:30. The program was
heard locally over KPO.
Including in his six-minute talk
the activities of the Black Dragon
Society and its organizer, Toyama,
Mr. Lory took his listeners into the
mind of a Japanese contemplating a
political assassination.
Works Quietly
"He moves quietly among his
friends, inquiring, 'Would it not be
better for the high interests of Ten
no, Son of Heaven, and the welfare
of the State, if our Premier, or pos
sibly, the Lord Keeper of the Im
perial Seal, or even an Army officer,
say a too-moderate Inspector Gen
eral of Education—could no longer
obstruct the true Imperial way?',"
said Mr. Lory.
He continued by saying the assas
sin realizes he has violated the law
but Ls prepared to stand extreme
punishment because he feels his un
lawful act was actually the true will
■of the Emperor. He explained that
this sort of reasoning is highly ac
ceptable to the Japanese people.
Staunch Patriotism'
"After Marquis Okuma lost a leg
from the bomb thrown by a disciple
■of Toyama, Okuma publicly ex
pressed admiration for Toyama's
staunch patriotism'," said Mr. Lory.
He described the courts trying the
assassins as carnival sideshows
where the murderers are treated as
prisoners of honor. He told of peti
tions, many of which carried over a
million signatures, some of them
signed in blood, which streamed into
the Diet, the Cabinet, and the Courts
asking mercy for the killers.
"Some generals in Japan's army

[ grumbled that the assassins were
I even brought to trial at all," Mr.
Lory said.
It was not until the Army revolt of
1936 that the Army was shocked into
the belated realization that this ac
cepted Japanese philosophy that po
litical assassination, if cloaked in
| such mystical phrases as "promoting
the true will of the Emperor," could
be in fact a sword that cuts two
ways.
'Ronin' and 'Sushi'
The "ronin" and "soshi" of Japan's
feudal days were the predecessors of
i the modern terrorists. Mr. Lory de
scribed the "ronin" as being samurai
who had lost their feudal lord and
so roamed the neighborhood killing
anyone who in any way insulted the
honor of their dead master.
"Soshi" were freelancers — men
whose abilities for violent under
takings could be bought by anyone.
Mr. Lory described the Black Dragon
Society as the best known modern
counterpart of these two gangster
types.
"Should the Allied armies invade
Japan, we must expect a nucleus of
Japan's Black Dragon to go under
ground. Unless eradicated, they will
be the ones who secretly will build
from a defeated nation a stronger
Japan." Mr. Lory concluded.
