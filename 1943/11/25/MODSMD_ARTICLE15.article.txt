# Nazi Spy Film Is Entertaining
## 
### 
ABOVE SUSPICION â€” Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
"Above Suspicion," Joan Craw
ford's last picture for M-G-M, is
another of the Nazi spy films that are
flooding the motion picture market.
Handsome Fred Mac Murray, with
his flashing Calox smile, is Miss
Crawford's new leading man.
Thanks mainly to the excellent
supporting cast which includes Basil
Rathbone and the late Conrad Vcidt,
''Above Suspicion" is a tense and ab
sorbing drama.
Mac Murray, a young English pro
fessor, at the request of British In
telligence, goes to Germany to un
cover information on the Nazi secret
weapon. Wifie Joan Crawford trails
so the couple may pose as tourists.
While in Germany Mac Murray meets
one of his former school chums, Basil
Rathbone, a Gestapo bigshot. A Ger
man guide, Conrad Veidt, helps them
get the necessary information.
'"Above Suspicion" strives to en
tertain and not to arouse patriotic
emotion. This is ably proved by the
film's last line, in which after killing
several Nazi agents and burning a
Gestapo palace, Mac Murray glibly
remarks, "Let's have a plate of
spaghetti."
