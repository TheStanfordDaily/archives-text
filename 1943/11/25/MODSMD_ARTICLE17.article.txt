# DEBATERS
## Farm Pair Takes Five Rounds In Initial Contest at Fresno 
### 
Stanford debaters, Carol Newton and Frank Creede, talked through eight
rounds of debate to emerge in either third or fourth place, in a yet unde
termined decision, at the "California Tournament Association Speech Con
test held last Friday and Saturday at Fresno.
Miss Newton and Mr. Creede, for both of whom the Fresno tournament

was their first experience in college'*
J debating, won five out of eight
rounds of debate and were among
the four top teams from the l(i en- >
tered who were still debating in the
j next to the last round.
Tough Competition
Maurice Hall and Leon Cooper,
USN, of UCLA, who won first place
and Bob Cathcart and Warren Chris
topher, USN, of Redlands, second
place winners, accounted for two of
the Stanford team's defeats.
Competition among the contestants
was not greatly affected by the war
since the majority of the universities
having representatives in the tour
nament have Navy programs and
were able to enter experienced vet
] eran teams.
I Sailors Compete
'"We saw so many sailors around
| that we began to wonder whether
| the contest was being held in Fresno j
or San Diego," said Miss Newton.
Dick Stanton and Vicky Sellens, !
who made up the remaining half of
i the Stanford contingent, were elimi- I
l nated after five rounds of debating
both the affirmative and negative of !
J the subject, "Resolved, that the
United States should cooperate in the
| establishing and maintaining of an j
international police force upon the j
i defeat of the Axis."
.
| Competing Teams
Among the other universities '
which sent representatives to the j
tournament, which is the first major
contest Stanford has entered this
year, were USC, Cal Tech, Pepper- !
dine, UCLA, and Redlands.
Members of the squad who did
not go to Fresno have been working
for the last week on the general sub
ject of a world organization . with
{ legislative powers, and a three-man i
team made up of Harriet Behring,
Sylvia Roberts, and Bob Blackburn
will go to Berkeley tomorrow to de
bate on the negative against a Cali
! fornia team.
