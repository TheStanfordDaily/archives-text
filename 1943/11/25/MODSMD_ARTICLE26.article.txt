Although the Daily iootball ex
perts wound up the season in a
three-way tie for first place, their
seasonal average, .880, is something
that a professional sports writer
would be proud of. In fact you could
probably count the number of people
who have a better average for this
year on your fingers.
Experts Roger Corman, Ed Luce,
J and Barney Gugel all picked 121
games out of 137 for individual aver
ages of .883, the same as the collec
tive average. Expert Don Langen
dorf was one behind with 120 games
out of 137 for an average of .875. At
one time during the season, .172 sep
arated the leading expert from the
one in last place.
The experts completely tied up 1 his
week, and picked Notre Dame over
Great Lakes. Great Lakes, however,
knocked the Irish out of the ranks of
the undefeated 19-14, in the biggest
upset of the season.
