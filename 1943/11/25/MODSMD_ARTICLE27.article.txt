# Tennis Tourney Nears Climax
## 
### 
I Intramural tennis swings into the
semi-finals of play this week as the
toUrnament approaches the climax.
In the upper bracket, the Pied
Typers meet Tyler Hall, while Lin
coln comes up against the strong
Arthur team in the lower division.
The winners of the two matches meet
next week in the finals to determine
the championship. Lightly regarded
in pre-tourname.nt ratings, the Pied
Typers have knocked over Hayes
Hall and the Washington B's easily.
Paced by Scott Chaffee, Tyler has
looked good in bowling over all op
position, and rates a slight edge.
Chaffee should take first singles, but
from there on in it's anyone's match,
j With Ted Meyers in the first sin
gles spot, Arthur rules as strong
I favorites to take a better than aver-
I age Lincoln squad. Meyers won't
! have much trouble in first singles,
I and Arthur's all around strength
! should win the other events.
