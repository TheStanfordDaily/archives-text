WHICH WRITER DO YOU READ?
Contrary to what that soldier said in Wednes
day's Daily, things are not tough all over. Things
are pretty good. Those of us who were fortu
nate enough to be home for Thanksgiving dinner
found that one home-cooked meal a substantial
morale-booster, a pleasant break in the hum
drum routine of campus eating. Those who were
not so lucky undoubtedly missed the usual
celebration of the time-hallowed holiday, but
found consolation in four days of rest and
freedom.
As you ought to know by now, I was among
the favored few who had turkey at home. Need
less to say, I enjoyed it. Now, as I reflect upon it,
I cannot help musing as to the effect that meal
would have had on one of my favorite writers,
the fair-haired boy from Fresno —or even on
his relatives from the same city who filled this
column with some very readable stuff a year or
so ago. This is the way they might have handled
it, I think (nothing like being presumptuous).
I went home for Thanksgiving. Home is
Healdsburg. Healdsburg is a small town in a
very pretty valley. They raise prunes and
grapes there. I do not live there anymore, but
I still call it home.
Mama cooked a big turkey, which weighed
25 pounds. Mama and Papa had a big argument
as to where the turkey should be carved. Mama
said Papa should carve it in the kitchen. Papa
wanted to do it in the dining room in front of
all the people.
The turkey was carved in the kitchen. It
wasn't as pretty when it came to the table, but
Mama said it made her nervous to have Papa
carve in front of all the people. Everybody said
the turkey tasted good. It did. Mama is a fine
cook. Even Grandpa says Mama is a fine cook,
and Grandpa doesn't say anything nice about
anybody unless he means it.
Grandpa came all the way from San Fran
cisco to eat the turkey. He is 93 years old and
in excellent health. After dinner he sat on the
front porch with a jug of red wine and played
the zither while we sat around and sang folk
songs from the old country.'
Three of my uncles were there. One of them
brought his wife and his son, who is 14 years
old, and his mother-in-law. Another brought his
daughter and her husband and their two little

children. The children are aged 3 and 6 re
spectively. They are very pretty children.
At 7 o'clock everybody went home. We
kissed them all goodbye and they thanked us
for the dinner. Then Mama and Papa went to
bed. They were tired. It was a nice Thanks
giving.

That's one way of looking at it. This is the
way I saw it:
I went home to Healdsburg for Thanksgiving.
Healdsburg is a nice place to be from. There
were a lot of relatives at our house eating up
our points. After dinner everybody went to
sleep—except the little kids, who did their best
to keep the rest of us awake. The relatives final
ly went home, and Mom and Dad and I went
out for a pick-me-up. The turkey was good.

freedom.
As you ought to know by now, I was among
the favored few who had turkey at home. Need
less to say, I enjoyed it. Now, as I reflect upon it,
I cannot help musing as to the effect that meal
would have had on one of my favorite writers,
the fair-haired boy from Fresno —or even on
his relatives from the same city who filled this
column with some very readable stuff a year or
so ago. This is the way they might have handled
it, I think (nothing like being presumptuous).
I went home for Thanksgiving. Home is
Healdsburg. Healdsburg is a small town in a
very pretty valley. They raise prunes and
grapes there. I do not live there anymore, but
I still call it home.
Mama cooked a big turkey, which weighed
25 pounds. Mama and Papa had a big argument
as to where the turkey should be carved. Mama
said Papa should carve it in the kitchen. Papa
wanted to do it in the dining room in front of
all the people.
The turkey was carved in the kitchen. It
wasn't as pretty when it came to the table, but
Mama said it made her nervous to have Papa
carve in front of all the people. Everybody said
the turkey tasted good. It did. Mama is a fine
cook. Even Grandpa says Mama is a fine cook,
and Grandpa doesn't say anything nice about
anybody unless he means it.
Grandpa came all the way from San Fran
cisco to eat the turkey. He is 93 years old and
in excellent health. After dinner he sat on the
front porch with a jug of red wine and played
the zither while we sat around and sang folk
songs from the old country.'
Three of my uncles were there. One of them
brought his wife and his son, who is 14 years
old, and his mother-in-law. Another brought his
daughter and her husband and their two little

children. The children are aged 3 and 6 re
spectively. They are very pretty children.
At 7 o'clock everybody went home. We
kissed them all goodbye and they thanked us
for the dinner. Then Mama and Papa went to
bed. They were tired. It was a nice Thanks
giving.

I went home to Healdsburg for Thanksgiving.
Healdsburg is a nice place to be from. There
were a lot of relatives at our house eating up
our points. After dinner everybody went to
sleep—except the little kids, who did their best
to keep the rest of us awake. The relatives final
ly went home, and Mom and Dad and I went
out for a pick-me-up. The turkey was good.

Contrary to what that soldier said in Wednes
day's Daily, things are not tough all over. Things
are pretty good. Those of us who were fortu
nate enough to be home for Thanksgiving dinner
found that one home-cooked meal a substantial
morale-booster, a pleasant break in the hum
drum routine of campus eating. Those who were
not so lucky undoubtedly missed the usual
celebration of the time-hallowed holiday, but
found consolation in four days of rest and
freedom.
