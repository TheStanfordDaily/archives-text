SOUVENIRS
To the Editor:
I am what is known as a tacker-upper. For a
week now I have been putting up signs adver
tising the Gaieties, and I have just put up my
third sign on Engineering Corner. The others
have disappeared. It is discouraging to say the
least.
This is a plea to those who want souvenirs.
Why not go to the Gaieties and get a free pro
gram? At least wait until after the performance
to take the posters.—C.D.

To the Editor:
RE THANKSGIVING DINNER
Private Crowder reflected in Wednesday's
Daily on the current Army expression to the
effect that "Things are tough all over."
Here follows the menu of the Thanksgiving
dinner served the ASTU at Stanford:
"Fruit cocktail supreme; celery en branche,
olives, sweet kherkins; hearts of lettuce, 1000
island dressing; cream of tomato soup; roast
young Oregon torn turkey, chestnut dressing,
cranberry sauce, giblet gravy; candied yams
au citron; fresh green peas, french rolls, sweet
butter; orange brick ice cream, petits fours,
pumpkin pie; coffee, milk, fresh apple cider;
dinner mints, mixed nuts; cigarettes, cigars."
All I can say is, "They sure are!"—]ealous.

IS CHRISTMAS WORTH IT?
To the Editor:

It seems to me that the Administration of this
University is just a little petty and faintly ridicu
lous in issuing that threatening story on Christ
mas week absences. Students in an institution
of such high caliber as this one certainly should
be mature enough to judge for themselves
whether their particular situation justifies leav
ing for home before finals.
Now I realize that the unfortunate schedule
at the end of this quarter is due to the necessi
ties of the AST Program on the campus. And I
also realize that no power in Heaven or Earth
could have moved the Army to arrange its pro
gram so that the vacation week came at Christ
mas time.
But for many of the civilian men on the cam
pus this will be the last time they will be able
to be with their families on Christmas for sev
eral years, perhaps. And I, personally think they
would be perfectly justified in taking incom
pletes, if they want to, even should the combined
committees of scholarship and examinations bar
the way.—D.H.

In 1942, American railroads car
ried 683 billion ton-miles of freight,
or a third more than in 1941, with
one-quarter fewer freight cars than
were in existence in 1918.

The old movie "Hell Divers" is said
to be the source on which the Japs
have based all their dive-bombing
technique, according to "Flying"
magazine.

or a third more than in 1941, with
one-quarter fewer freight cars than
were in existence in 1918.

The old movie "Hell Divers" is said
to be the source on which the Japs

SOUVENIRS
To the Editor:
I am what is known as a tacker-upper. For a
week now I have been putting up signs adver
tising the Gaieties, and I have just put up my
third sign on Engineering Corner. The others
have disappeared. It is discouraging to say the
least.
This is a plea to those who want souvenirs.
Why not go to the Gaieties and get a free pro
gram? At least wait until after the performance
to take the posters.—C.D.

To the Editor:
RE THANKSGIVING DINNER
Private Crowder reflected in Wednesday's
Daily on the current Army expression to the
effect that "Things are tough all over."
Here follows the menu of the Thanksgiving
dinner served the ASTU at Stanford:
"Fruit cocktail supreme; celery en branche,
olives, sweet kherkins; hearts of lettuce, 1000
island dressing; cream of tomato soup; roast
young Oregon torn turkey, chestnut dressing,
cranberry sauce, giblet gravy; candied yams
au citron; fresh green peas, french rolls, sweet
butter; orange brick ice cream, petits fours,
pumpkin pie; coffee, milk, fresh apple cider;
dinner mints, mixed nuts; cigarettes, cigars."
All I can say is, "They sure are!"—]ealous.

IS CHRISTMAS WORTH IT?
To the Editor:

It seems to me that the Administration of this
University is just a little petty and faintly ridicu
lous in issuing that threatening story on Christ
mas week absences. Students in an institution
of such high caliber as this one certainly should
be mature enough to judge for themselves
whether their particular situation justifies leav
ing for home before finals.
Now I realize that the unfortunate schedule
at the end of this quarter is due to the necessi
ties of the AST Program on the campus. And I
also realize that no power in Heaven or Earth
could have moved the Army to arrange its pro
gram so that the vacation week came at Christ
mas time.
But for many of the civilian men on the cam
pus this will be the last time they will be able
to be with their families on Christmas for sev
eral years, perhaps. And I, personally think they
would be perfectly justified in taking incom
pletes, if they want to, even should the combined
committees of scholarship and examinations bar
the way.—D.H.

In 1942, American railroads car
ried 683 billion ton-miles of freight,
or a third more than in 1941, with
one-quarter fewer freight cars than
were in existence in 1918.
