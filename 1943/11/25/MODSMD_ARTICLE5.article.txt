WASHINGTONâ€”Senator Scott W.
Lucas (Dem., 111.), co-author of the
soldier-vote bill, asserted tonight his
measure would be rendered worth
less by a suggested amendment call
ing for virtual censorship of political
information broadcast or distributed
to the overseas armed forces.
When introduced last week, the
proposal by Senator Robert A. Taft
(Rep., O.), was described as banning
such distribution by federal officials
unless approved by a war ballot
commission.
