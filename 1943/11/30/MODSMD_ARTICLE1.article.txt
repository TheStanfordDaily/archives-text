ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS, Nov. 29.
â€”Opening a major offensive to turn
the German lines before Rome, the
British Eighth Army has pierced the
enemy's Adriatic defenses
and thrown a new bridgehead across
the Sangro River 14 miles inland
despite resistance from Nazi tanks
and flame throwers, it was an
nounced today.
Behind heavy aerial support and
an artillery barrage so shattering
that the first German prisoners stag
gered in too dazed to speak, British,
New Zealand, and Indian troops
struck Sunday just before dawn.
Infantry men and tanks charged
ahead from the coastal bridgehead
across the Sangro and overran the
outlying defensive positions before
the Nazi commanders could rally
their forces for counterattacks. But
then the Germans flung against their
attackers Mark IV special tanks with
long-barreled 75 milimeter guns and
other tanks mounting flame throwers
making their first appearance on the
Italian battlefront.
All initial objectives were held
despite fierce counterattacks, accord
ing to official reports which dis
closed that other Eighth Army
troops broke the Sangro line at a
new point near Archi, 14 miles in
land where they poured across the
stream to high ground on the north
west bank.
