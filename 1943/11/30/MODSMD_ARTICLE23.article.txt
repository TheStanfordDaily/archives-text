## MURAL FOOTBALL Co. C & A Picked Over Co. A In Important League B Tilt 
### Roger Corman 
Featuring two of the top contenders for the lead of League B in the
intramural football league, the top game on today's round brings Co. A up
against powerful Co. C & A. A loss will definitely eliminate Co. C & A from
consideration for the league crown. Co. A, on the other hand, can absorb a
defeat and still be ranked among the contenders. Fighting to stay in the

running, Co. C & A should take this
one, but only after a tough struggle.
At the top of League B with a rec
ord of seven wins against one loss,
Co. L, F.A. is riding the crest of a
string of victories, and will extend
their list of wins at the hands of Co.
E. Team 3. Co. E is one of the better
teams of the league, but can't cope
with the power of Co. L, F.A.. led by
former Stanford grid stars Art Ship
key and Mark Caffall.
Co. E, Team 1.. has what appears
to be a setup when they play Lincoln
Hall. The Lincoln machine is po
tentially pretty good, but has sput
tered and stalled all season. Take
Co. E by two touchdowns.
The only undefeated team in either
league, the Fightin' Q.M. won't have
much trouble in maintaining their
grip on the top spot in League A
when they come to grips with the
Theta Hashers. The soldiers will win
this one by two or three markers.
The Firehouse has a real test
against Co. D, Team 2. On paper the
Firemen rule as heavy favorites, but
Co. D is stronger than its record in
dicates. We'll string along with the
form book and pick the Firehouse by
one touchdown.
McKinley should have an easy
time bowling over Adams Hall, one
of the few teams left who hasn't won
a single game.
