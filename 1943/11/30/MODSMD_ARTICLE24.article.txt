# Volleyball Teams Play Off Murals
## 
### 
There was a noticeable lag in
women's intramural volleyball games
Monday, perhaps due to lack of prac
tice over the holiday. Roble 3C beat
the Roble AAA's 15-3 and 15-7, and
the Pi Phi's topped the 1A Aces 15-3,
15-5.
Mary Ed Davis, captain of the 1A
Aces, was the spirit behind her team.
Mary Ed, Judy Peeke, and Eunis Erb
were all notable for their serves,
setups, and net spikes.
Tuesday's schedule is as follows:
Double S vs. Oaks, Double S picked
to win; Adelpha vs. Delta Gamma.
D.G. winning that game; and Roble
1C vs. 2A Apes, the 2A Apes win
ning their game. The Lagunita vs.
Tri-Delt game, postponed from Mon
day, will be played tomorrow at 4.
