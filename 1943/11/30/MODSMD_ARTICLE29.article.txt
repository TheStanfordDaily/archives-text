With the remarkable showing of
the former Stanford football players
now with other universities, we often
wonder whether peacetime would
have seen the Farm represented in
the Rose Bowl come Jan. 1, 1944.
Last Tuesday we told you about
Rock Sheller and his contribution to
Rocky Mountain football. He isn't
the only Stanford man to represent
our university at Colorado College,
for Bob Hall has been playing a lot
of fine end for the team. He was
chosen on the AP Rocky team.
Another outstanding former Farm
end is Dave Brown, now playing for
the UCLA Bruins. Brown was ter
rific last Saturday as he intercepted
a Southern California lafbral and
galloped 80 yards for a touchdown.
Those of us who saw the UC-UCLA
game well remember Brown's stellar
playing.
Bob Frissbee of Cal has been play
ing good ball lately as well as other
former Stanfordites with Cal such as
Boensch, Cox, Joslyn. Munroe,
Hachten, Madigan, and Rasmussen.
At Westwood, there are Rohrer and

Andrews along with Brown.
We might well have gone unde
feated in conference competition. But
we aren't living in normal times, su
out the window go the pipe dreams
and let's think of the great cham
pionship teams we'll have after the
war.
