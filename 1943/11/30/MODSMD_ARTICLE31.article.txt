# No Incompletes
## 
### 
//TT SEEMS to me that the Administration of this University is
1 just a little petty and faintly ridiculous in issuing that threat
ening story on Christmas week absences."
Yesterday's Campus Opinion column in The Daily ran a
letter from D.H. which started with those very words, and so
some of us looked back in The Daily files to take a second glance
at the "threatening" story. We apologize to D.H. if the story was
written in such a manner as to threaten him; the reporter who
wrote it tried to state the facts as bluntly and as clearly as
possible.
But the University did not issue the story. The Administration
issued merely the facts; the reporter put them together in good
journalistic form.
But it really makes no difference about who did what; the fact
remains that missing finals in order to go home for Christmas is
not good enough reason for being allowed to take incompletes.
While this may seem severe and ridiculous at first glance, there
are apparent reasons why it has to be this way.
When we were younger our parents explained to us that
while it might be all right for one or two of us to pick the flowers
in the park, we still couldn't enjoy this lawlessness because
everyone else figured it was all right if just they picked flowers
too. And if we were multiplied by 100, the park would be ruined.
The same kind of reasoning can be applied to the Christmas
situation. It would be perfectly all right for D.H. to go home for
Christmas, to miss finals, and to take incompletes; but multiply
him by the number of students who would like to be doing the
same thing and it becomes obvious that Winter Quarter would
offer nothing but a big hangover for students, professors, and the
Registrar's office.
"But for many of the civilian men on the campus this will be
the last time they will be able to be with their families on Christ
mas for several years, perhaps."
This is another guote from D.H.'s letter.
There's no denying the fact that it's no fun to miss being wtih
the family on Christmas. But maybe D.H. doesn't realize that
when the impact of the war finally hit the United States, it was
our bitter lesson to learn that we®would have to take many in
conveniences and hardships—to take them like good sports and
to take them without warning. Missing Christmas with the folks
is one of the very few Stanford students have had to face.—lrma
