# Gaieties’ Orchestra Shines
## 
### 
When the orchestra swings out
with the Gaieties' opener, "Be Hap
py Tonight," you'll feel like being
happy, for the orchestra and its ar
rangements are something out of
this world. Claude WHson and
Charles Reeder, pics at right, have
been spending every free minute
they have away from the Graduate
School of Business writing, arrang
ing, and rehearsing the songs for the
performances on Friday and Satur
day nights.
Wilson, who is leading the half
civilian, half-G.I. orchestra, wrote
three of the show's most sparkling
tunes, "Jericho," "Ten Bucks and
Twenty-Four Hours Leave," which
is now being published, and "Be
Happy Tonight,'' the opener. He and
Reeder had charge of the music for
a show similar to. Gaieties when they
were studying at Harvard.
Outstanding member of the brass
section is Tommy Fair, who played
the trombone professionally for Tony
Pastor and Woody Herman before
being inducted into the Army. lie
soloed on the Decca recordings of
"There Will Never Be Another You"
with Herman and "I'll Pray for You"
with Pastor.

Dick Flynt, who is assisting Wil
son, has charge of the brass section
in which he plays the trumpet.
Other trumpeters include Gregg
D'Nelly, Gurley Martin, and Walter
De Mettas.
Besides Farr, Bill Frankenstein
and Ken Lincoln will blow out on
the "slip-horn," known to long-hairs
as the trombone. In the reed section
will be Bill Bird, Bob Davis, George
Davis, Bill Downey, Norwood Hart,
and Nash Getehel.
On the drums will be Roger Blan
der. while Joan Whitmore will play
the piano.
The string section will be made up
of Elwyn Bugge, Barbara Barrett,
Ann Stuart, Rudolph Jerek, and
Carol Bartle playing the violins; Don
Sharp and Lois GrilTiths making
music 011 the cellos; and Don Marvel,
another one of the musically inclined
soldier boys, playing the guitar, both
plain and electric.
The dances will be strictly of the
spectacular variety, and are being
directed by Janice Shaughnessy and
Mrs. Jacqueline Ogg. A primitive
Martinique mating ritual dressed up
a la Carmen Miranda has been pre
pared by Mrs. Ogg under the title of

"Torrid Traipsings in the Tropics."
The entire dance will be done
around a big drum, with dancers
Candy Taylor, Margaret Morgan,
and Mrs. Ogg throwing their hips
out of joint in the best Martinique
fashion. Dancing with them in the
number are Joe Villar, Bob Fuller,
Bill Thorn, Jim Reed, and H. Eliott.
Mrs. Ogg also has charge of the
"C abemet and Candlelight"
number, which is smooth, sophisti
cated. and slightly sentimental. Dim
Landale will sing the song in fox
trot rhythm followed by couples
dancing in three-quarter tempo.
Paula Kanner, costume manager,
has designed beautiful formals made
of silver sequin tops and purple net
skirts embroidered with sequins
which Cecelia Bergeda, Bob Fuller,
and the other dancers will wear.
Orchestra Leader Claude Wilson's
soon -to- be - released composition,
"Ten Bucks and Twenty-Four Hours
Leave" will provide the music for
the number entitled "Dusky Down
beat."
The dance has a Harlem flavor
with straight blues combined with
intervals of Charleston. Appearing
