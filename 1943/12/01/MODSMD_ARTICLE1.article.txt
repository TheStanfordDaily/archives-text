When the orchestra swings out
with the Gaieties' opener, "Be Hap
py Tonight," you'll feel like being
happy, for the orchestra and its ar
rangements are something out of
this world. Claude WHson and
Charles Reeder, pics at right, have
been spending every free minute
they have away from the Graduate
School of Business writing, arrang
ing, and rehearsing the songs for the
performances on Friday and Satur
day nights.
Wilson, who is leading the half
civilian, half-G.I. orchestra, wrote
three of the show's most sparkling
tunes, "Jericho," "Ten Bucks and
Twenty-Four Hours Leave," which
is now being published, and "Be
Happy Tonight,'' the opener. He and
Reeder had charge of the music for
a show similar to. Gaieties when they
were studying at Harvard.

section is Tommy Fair, who played

another one of the musically inclined
soldier boys, playing the guitar, both

spectacular variety, and are being
directed by Janice Shaughnessy and
Mrs. Jacqueline Ogg. A primitive
Martinique mating ritual dressed up
a la Carmen Miranda has been pre
pared by Mrs. Ogg under the title of

"Torrid Traipsings in the Tropics."

fashion. Dancing with them in the
number are Joe Villar, Bob Fuller,

number, which is smooth, sophisti
cated. and slightly sentimental. Dim

trot rhythm followed by couples
dancing in three-quarter tempo.
Paula Kanner, costume manager,
has designed beautiful formals made
of silver sequin tops and purple net
skirts embroidered with sequins
which Cecelia Bergeda, Bob Fuller,
