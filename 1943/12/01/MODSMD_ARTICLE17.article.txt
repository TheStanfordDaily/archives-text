# Choir To Give Xmas Program
## 
### 
The celebration of Christinas at
Stanford will officially open on Sun
day. Dec. 12. 8 p.m., when the Uni
versity Choir and prominent soloists
will be heard in Christmas portions
of Handel's Messiah.
The names of the soloists have just
been released by the office of the
Memorial Church. These include
Esther H. Allen, contralto. Edna C.
Wheelwright, soprano, Pic. James
Schwabacher, tenor, and Cpl. Francis
Kogier, bass, with Gustavus H. Smith
and Pfc. J. M, Forshaw, accom
panists.
D. Sterling Wheelwright, acting
University organist, will direct the
entire performance. "The best Han
del traditions will be observed," Mr.
Wheelwright said today, "since our
soloists have enjoyed a wide experi
ence in previous performances.
Mrs. Allen "has sung the alto arias
both in the Middle West and along
the Coast: Mrs. Wheelwright has
sung in 10 performances in our na
tion's capital in recent years; and our
soldier soloists, Cpl. Rosier and Pfc.
Schwabacher have both studied tin
der able interpreters in New York."
