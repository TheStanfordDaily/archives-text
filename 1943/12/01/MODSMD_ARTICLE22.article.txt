## 
### 
After soundly defeating the Mc-
Kinley Bashers in Monday night's
feature volleyball contest, the LFA
Army team defends its newly won
league lead against Fillmore tonight.
Previously McKinley and LFA were
tied for the lead. With their victory
of Monday evening, it looks as if the
Army group are virtually cinches to
run off with the title.
Monroe, having suffered only one
loss and that at the hands of LFA,
should have no trouble whatsoever
in downing Hayes Hall, that is if
Hayes shows up. Monroe will most
likely win by default.
In the only other game of the eve
ning, Co. E faces the strong McKin
ley squad. The latter team should
have little trouble in winning.
The Fillmore - LFA tussle takes
place at 7:15, while the other two
games are scheduled to get under
way at 8:15.
