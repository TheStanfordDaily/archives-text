### Sgt. GASTON VALCOURT COMPANY I, A.S.T. P 
Like exuberant dolphins, local photographers are splashing
happily in their hypo, trying to keep abreast of their G.I. orders.
It seems that the majority of Stanford's olive-drab students
are solving the Christmas gift problem, as we have, by hot
footing it over to the nearest photographic studio where, for a
reasonable fee, their homely features will be immortalized for
embarrassed parents, love-blinded girl-friends, and the FBI.
Photographers' salons have spread like a rash on the face of
Palo Alto, and they are swamped with orders from happy extro
verts who can't wait to distribute their printed image, tinted by
hand in immodest primary colors.
The basic poses, we discovered, are simple. If you are bald,
you wear your hat. If you have a healthy head of hair, it is un
veiled in all its two-inch, G.I. glory.
If you wear a noncommissioned officer's stripes, the photog
rapher concentrates his efforts upon their reproduction, wisely
under the impression that the chevrons will impress the folks
back home much more than the pinhead they adorn. If, alas, the
subject is still a mere private or PFC, his body is removed at the
neck, and his outsize head fills the lens, giving his loved ones
the consolation that his features are still dimly recognizable as
human, even if the military authorities have failed to recognize
his gualities.
Two categorical expressions are allotted to each subjectâ€”
the serious, in which the sitter assumes an expression of acute
nausea, and the gay, in which he leers at the camera with the
horror-stricken grin of a Frankenstein.
Soldiers are unexacting clients, however.
"We almost never sell less than a dozen. They always love
the uniform," our photographer assured us, blanching visibly
but recovering in a trice as he glanced at our proofs.
"Make me up a dozen," we hissed back through clenched
teeth, betraying our friends and our ego at a single blow.
On a second glance, however, the uniform does not look at
all bad, and the stripes came out perfectly. Perhaps we should
double the order.
