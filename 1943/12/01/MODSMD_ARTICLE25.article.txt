HARVARD - STANFORD
To the Editor:
It is true that this country is at war, that rivalries should be
suppressed in favor of cooperation, and that all friction should be
forgotten in the interests of national unity. But we fail to see how
this fact compels us to accept quietly both insult and indignity
for the sake of harmony.
In your issue of Nov. 23, one of your reporters cade a passing
reference to Harvard University as the "Stanford of the East."
This is, in our opinion, a comparison of two unrelated subjects
like peanuts and skyscrapers —-or is, at best, analogous to stating
that the New York Times is The Stanford Daily of the East.
You have forced us to point out, unchivalrous though it may
be, such obvious contrasts as:
Our Adamses and Roosevelts as against your Hoover;
Our cigar-smoking Amy Lowell as against your no-smoking
-in-the-Quad Mrs. Stanford;
Our famous graduates—Longfellow, Emerson, the Holmes',
James R. Lowell, Benchley, Thomas Wolfe—as against your ....
the name escapes us for the moment.
May we suggest, perhaps, that the respective spirits of the
two schools are best exemplified by our memorial to the original
books of John Harvard; and by yours to young Leland Stanford's I
playthings. Respectfully,
Three Ex-Harvard Men. i
