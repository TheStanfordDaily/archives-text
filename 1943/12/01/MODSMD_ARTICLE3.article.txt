# Adler Speaks On Philosophy
## 
### Jim Weinberg 
Dr. Mortimer J. Adler, noted
author and educator of the Univer
sity of Chicago, last night addressed
an appreciative Tuesday Evening
Series audience on the subject
questions Science Cannot Answer."
Dr. Adler proved himself a dy
namic and logical speaker. He based
his argument on three fundamental
theses. First, he asserted that there
are three distinct kinds of knowl
edge: science, philosophy, and the
ology.
Second, there are for each of these
three kinds of knowledge certain un
answerable questions. Such ques
tions may, however, be answerable
by one of the other two kinds of
knowledge. Third, the basic ques
tions of life are of a sort which can
not be answered by science, now or
ever.
Opposite Theory
The opposite position to this, said
Dr. Adler, is the belief that science is
the only valid knowledge. This is the
! dominant point of view in our uni
versities and colleges today. If this
point of view is wrong, and Dr. Adler
! believes it is, we are definitely on the
wrong road in our modern education.
Each kind of knowledge, including
| science, is prevented by its very
1 method from answering certain
; questions, but it is also prevented
from refuting the answers of other
i kinds of knowledge to them.
Moral Issues
The questions which science can
j not answer are the really important,
| life-and-death questions. Science
I cannot distinguish between right and
; wrong, or between good and bad.
Only philosophy can show us the
best form of government, solve the
I questions of war and peace, tell us
about the substance of things and
their causes, and about the ends of
I human existence. Only religion can
-five us answers to questions about
the soul, immortality, and God. Sci
| ence, in short, cannot answer a single
moral or political problem.
