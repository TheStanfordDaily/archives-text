"Everyone on campus — soldiers,

| put on comfortable clothes and come
j to the Women's Gym for fun and
! food this Sunday afternoon," feaid
j Pat Cashell, WAA president, as she
! told of plans for the WAA Open
House.
The open house, which will be held
| from 2 to 5, will be the only all
campus play-day all quarter, and
| will feature sports, dancing, and
| games.
Inside the gymnasium, three vol
i leyball games will be going all after-
I noon, and both men and women will
play on the teams. Out on the
hockey field the more energetic ones
will have a chance to compete in
softball, and in the patio ping-pong
tables will be set up.
Ed Carpenter and Anne Davis will
lead folk dancing on the lawn at the
side of the gym.
''Come out and dance whether you
know how or not." stressed Miss
Davis, "because we will teach be
ginners all the necessary steps."
In the patio popular music and
good records are promised for
I dancers.
