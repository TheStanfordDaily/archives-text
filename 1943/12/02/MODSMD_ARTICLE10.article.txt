"Have you seen the contra
hassoon part?"
"No. but I heard a rumor that
someone in San Francisco was
| using the bass-clarinet part about
| a week ago."
Such difficulties have seriously
hindered the Stanford Symphony

two winter concerts, Dec. 22, and
Jan. 2(5, according to Ferenc Mol

Mr. Molnar would appreciate it
if members of the orchestra would
make a point of bringing; their
; parts to rehearsals.
