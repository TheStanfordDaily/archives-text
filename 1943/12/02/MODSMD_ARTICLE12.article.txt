# Folk Dance Group Meets Tonight
## 
### 
The beginning' section of the Stan
ford folk dance group will meet to
night at 7:30 as usual. An advanced
group is being formed which will
meet from 9 to 10 tonight.
Mrs. Miriam Lidster stated some
of the requirements for joining the
advanced group. "You must know
the schottische, polka, waltz, the
simple, fundamental dances, and
you must have enough interest to
come to the dances every time," shr
said.
The advanced group will join
California Federation of Folk Danc
ers. Mrs. Lidster plans to teach three
new dances at each meeting and re
view those dances which were taught
the previous week.
Plans are being made to have a
folk festival on the campus which
will be sponsored by the folk dance
group, according to Mrs. Lidster.
