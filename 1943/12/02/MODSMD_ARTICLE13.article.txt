# New Gaieties Theme To Be 'La Guerre'
## 
### Ellen Marcus 
Out of the chaos and noise of backstage each Fall Quarter has emerged
The Gaieties. The curtain has always risen on a show of cryptic sarcasm
and wit: poking fun at various phases of Farm life—the Hall, the Row, the
Quad, the Chappie, The Daily, the Administration, or even the Gaietie>
itself.
This year the theme is somewhat changed. The revision can he boiled

down to the prosaic saying of the
last war, "C'est la Guerre." But the
basic theme of providing two hours
of fun-time and satire remains.
First Rehearsal
Last night Director Jean Levinson
took the east through its first com
plete rehearsal. It was rough, as was
expected—but it was definitely laugh
provoking, which is the main thing.
By consensus, the outstanding fea
ture is the orchestra and the music.
Blossom Parke, musical director,
Claude Wilson, orchestra leader, and
Charles Reeder, arranger, have done
a superb job in both the writing and
the orchestration of the catchy songs.
Talent Exhibited
Feminine favorites, Jane Spauld
ing and Nan Tillson, exhibited their
well known talent in a hilarious
fashion.
Libe Satirized
The rather poor conditions which
exist on the campus buses and in the
Libe due to the influx of some 3,000
soldiers is properly satirized, or
more appropriately, lambasted. The
bus skit, "Jammin' the Tram," is a
pantomime-travelogue that promises
to bring down the house, or at least
the bus company.
