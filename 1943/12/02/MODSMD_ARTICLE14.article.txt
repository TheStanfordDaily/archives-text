# Savelle Says Spanish Republicans Not United

''The majority of the Spanish people probably favor the re-establishment
of a Spanish republic, but the republican parties are divided," states Max
well 11. Savelle, Stanford professor of history, in a commentary on the
initial bulletin published by Alian/.a Espanola I'or Un Mundo Libre, the
Spanish Section of Free World Association.

According to Professor Savelle,
the bulletin is clearly propaganda, as
it presents only the opinions of those
opposing Franco, Spain's present
leader. Franco, states Savelle, is pri
marily a military leader — and a
rather poor one — with little true
knowledge of fascism.
Bourbon Opposition
In an attempt to close the ranks
of Spanish democracy against Fran
co, the bulletin is represented as
being the initial step in a great
movement to oppose the restoration
>112 the Bourbon monarchy and to
secure the re-establishment of a
democratic republic in Spain. How
ever, Professor Savelle states that
the political problem cannot be
solved until Spain discovers a solu
tion to her agrarian problem.
A republic, he says, would reduce ■
the power of the great Spanish land
owners and allow the small farmer
to make a sufficient living for him
self and his family. Under present ;
conditions the little man of Spain
is starving, for he cannot produce for j
the aristocracy and at the same time !
make a living.
Spanish America
Spanish America, Savelle states, |
is probably in favor of the republi- j
can parties, as there are no mon
archies in the Western Hemisphere's
Spanish-speaking countries. How
ever, the republicans here are also
divided.
In the meantime, Franco is lean- j
ing more toward the United States, i
for he realizes that he can gain the
support of the Spanish people only j
by favoring the winning side.
Professor Savelle points out that j

j the outcome of the struggle between
fascism, monarchy, and democracy in
| Spain is hard to predict. Another
j civil war may establish a republic,
I or the conservative elements may
j predominate and the monarchy may
ibe restored. Whatever happens, it
j is clear that Spain is definitely in
j need of some social revolution, ac
: cording to Professor Savelle.

to make a sufficient living for him
self and his family. Under present ;
conditions the little man of Spain
is starving, for he cannot produce for j
the aristocracy and at the same time !
make a living.
Spanish America
Spanish America, Savelle states, |
is probably in favor of the republi- j
can parties, as there are no mon
archies in the Western Hemisphere's
Spanish-speaking countries. How
ever, the republicans here are also
divided.
In the meantime, Franco is lean- j
ing more toward the United States, i
for he realizes that he can gain the
support of the Spanish people only j
by favoring the winning side.
Professor Savelle points out that j

j the outcome of the struggle between
fascism, monarchy, and democracy in
| Spain is hard to predict. Another
j civil war may establish a republic,
I or the conservative elements may
j predominate and the monarchy may
ibe restored. Whatever happens, it
j is clear that Spain is definitely in
j need of some social revolution, ac
: cording to Professor Savelle.

''The majority of the Spanish people probably favor the re-establishment
of a Spanish republic, but the republican parties are divided," states Max
well 11. Savelle, Stanford professor of history, in a commentary on the
initial bulletin published by Alian/.a Espanola I'or Un Mundo Libre, the
Spanish Section of Free World Association.

According to Professor Savelle,
the bulletin is clearly propaganda, as
it presents only the opinions of those
opposing Franco, Spain's present
leader. Franco, states Savelle, is pri
marily a military leader — and a
rather poor one — with little true
knowledge of fascism.
Bourbon Opposition
In an attempt to close the ranks
of Spanish democracy against Fran
co, the bulletin is represented as
being the initial step in a great
movement to oppose the restoration
>112 the Bourbon monarchy and to
secure the re-establishment of a
democratic republic in Spain. How
ever, Professor Savelle states that
the political problem cannot be
solved until Spain discovers a solu
tion to her agrarian problem.
A republic, he says, would reduce ■
the power of the great Spanish land
owners and allow the small farmer
to make a sufficient living for him
self and his family. Under present ;
conditions the little man of Spain
is starving, for he cannot produce for j
the aristocracy and at the same time !
