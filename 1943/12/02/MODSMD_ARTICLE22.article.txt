## Firehouse Favored Over Dinah's 
### Roger Corman 
In a match that shapes up as one
of the closest of the year, Dinah's
meets the Firehouse in the top game
of the Intramural Football League's
ninth round, this afternoon. Both
teams are one game behind the
league-leading Fightin' Q.M., and a
loss will drop either out of the ranks
of top contenders. Paced by Gene
Smith, one of the most consistent
ground gainers of the league, the
Firehouse rates a slight edge in this
game that can go either way.
Nino in a Row?
Unbeaten Fightin' Q.M. comes up
against Co. D, Team 2, which may be
the team to break the Quartermas
ters' win streak at eight in a row.
On the basis of its record, Fightin'
Q.M. is the heavy favorite, but Co.
D has been coming along fast and
could pull an upset.
The fast and tricky Navy squad
meets Tyler Hall in what should be
a scoring duel. Both teams are of-

fense conscious, and should provide
plenty of fireworks. We'll string
along with Navy's staying power and
pick the Sailors by a touchdown.
Mon roe Over Fillmore
What has been billed as the grudge
battle of the season comes off today
when the Monroe A's run up against
Fillmore. Fillmore's weak defense is
matched only by its impotent offense,
and Monroe should emerge victori
ous without too much trouble.
In the top game of League B, Co.
LFA meets the in and out Walter
Thompson Co-op. Thompson has
looked good in spots, but those spots
have been few and far between. Take
Co. LFA by two touchdowns.
Two strong teams meet when Co.
E. Team 1, opposes Co. E. Team 3.
Team 1 is tied for the League B lead,
and should take this one. We'll pick
them by two markers.
Co. A Favored Over McKinley
Entering the league late, Co. A has
built up a good record, and will add |
one more to its list this afternoon
when it runs over the weak Mc-
Kinley B team. McKinley is just
too small for the rugged soldiers and
can call it a moral victory if it holds
them to three touchdowns.
The tricky Buchanan club meets
the Monroe B's in a game that may I
turn into quite a contest. Buchanan
is the favorite.
