To the Editor:
Regarding Pfc. Brand's expose on European universities, I
think he is being very unfair to pre-war European college students
as a whole, throwing them all into the same pot with the dueling
rowdies of the German Junker families.
Although the German universities have undoubtedly exerted
a great influence in the past, fortunately there are dozens of
equally renowned institutions in many other countries in Europe.
Let's not make that old mistake of generalizing from one instance
and thereby give everybody an entirely false picture of the
situation.
Pfc. Richard Meyer, Co. H.

To the Editor:
Whoever referred to Harvard as the "Stanford of the East," I
admit, made a tragic miscalculation if "the Big Three" on our
campus are representative of that school. In adhering to the
infantile objections of "the Big Three" that we must teeter on
childish comparisons, we should note that Stanford has more
trees than Harvard—so what?
M. G.

To the Ex-Harvard Men:
We agree that this country is at war, and that rivalries should '
be suppressed. Why, then, are you starting a glorious one where i
none existed before?
We do not feel that Harvard and Stanford are unrelated
subjects. We admit that Harvard is old and decrepit, but we are
trying to overlook her very obvious faults in favor of her very
obscure merits.
We will ignore your reference to Roosevelt vs. Hoover, since
we do not want a political argument. However, we cannot ignore
your insulting comparison of Amy Lowell and Mrs. Stanford,
who are unrelated subjects. We have never been to Harvard,
but even so we doubt whether cigar smoking is one of the cardi
nal virtues or a sign of genius, even in the uncivilized East. Mrs.
Stanford was not a flagrant exhibitionist, but we are not ashamed
of that fact. Out here in the wild and woolly West we believe in
respecting the wishes of others; Mrs. Stanford requested us not
to smoke on the Quad —therefore we do not. Perhaps respect and ,
reverence at Harvard died when most of your famous graduates
did—long, long ago.
If your majesties have deigned to investigate Stanford's i
history, you may have discovered that she is only fifty years old.
Stanford is now nearly as famous as Harvard, and one of the
leading universities of the country. How famous was Harvard
in her fiftieth year? Stanford was founded in a nation already
having many fine schools, and has thrived on competition. How
much competition did Harvard have when she was founded?
Many of the famous graduates you- mentioned had completed
their education long before Stanford appeared. Do you expect a
non-existent college to have lured them away from you?
In reference to our respective memorials: Leland Stanford
Jr. died at the age of fifteen. What was John Harvard doing at
that age? Had he died then, do you honestly believe Harvard
would have been founded at all?

none existed before?
We do not feel that Harvard and Stanford are unrelated
subjects. We admit that Harvard is old and decrepit, but we are
trying to overlook her very obvious faults in favor of her very
obscure merits.
We will ignore your reference to Roosevelt vs. Hoover, since
we do not want a political argument. However, we cannot ignore
your insulting comparison of Amy Lowell and Mrs. Stanford,
who are unrelated subjects. We have never been to Harvard,
but even so we doubt whether cigar smoking is one of the cardi
nal virtues or a sign of genius, even in the uncivilized East. Mrs.
Stanford was not a flagrant exhibitionist, but we are not ashamed
of that fact. Out here in the wild and woolly West we believe in
respecting the wishes of others; Mrs. Stanford requested us not
to smoke on the Quad —therefore we do not. Perhaps respect and ,
reverence at Harvard died when most of your famous graduates
did—long, long ago.
If your majesties have deigned to investigate Stanford's i
history, you may have discovered that she is only fifty years old.
Stanford is now nearly as famous as Harvard, and one of the
leading universities of the country. How famous was Harvard
in her fiftieth year? Stanford was founded in a nation already
having many fine schools, and has thrived on competition. How
much competition did Harvard have when she was founded?
Many of the famous graduates you- mentioned had completed
their education long before Stanford appeared. Do you expect a
non-existent college to have lured them away from you?
In reference to our respective memorials: Leland Stanford
Jr. died at the age of fifteen. What was John Harvard doing at
that age? Had he died then, do you honestly believe Harvard
would have been founded at all?

To the Editor:
Regarding Pfc. Brand's expose on European universities, I
think he is being very unfair to pre-war European college students
as a whole, throwing them all into the same pot with the dueling
rowdies of the German Junker families.
Although the German universities have undoubtedly exerted
a great influence in the past, fortunately there are dozens of
equally renowned institutions in many other countries in Europe.
Let's not make that old mistake of generalizing from one instance
and thereby give everybody an entirely false picture of the
situation.

Whoever referred to Harvard as the "Stanford of the East," I
admit, made a tragic miscalculation if "the Big Three" on our
campus are representative of that school. In adhering to the
infantile objections of "the Big Three" that we must teeter on
childish comparisons, we should note that Stanford has more
trees than Harvard—so what?
