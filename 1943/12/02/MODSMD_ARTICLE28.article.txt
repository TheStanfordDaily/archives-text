# BULL SESSION
## 
### BILL ROSE 
The "Three Ex-Harvard Men," who expressed their righteous
indignation so capably in yesterday's Daily, struck a soft spot
in my heart. You see, my old alma mater, Healdsburg High, was
frequently referred to as "The Stanford of Northern Sonoma
County." So I consider myself gualified to appreciate the of
fense of the name Stanford when applied to any other school.
After all, Stanford (at Palo Alto) and H.H.S. have little in
common. Like Harvard, H.H.S. has its compensating factors.
But there is no legitimate reason why it should be called "The
Stanford of Northern Sonoma County" any more than that ven
erable Eastern seat of learning should be called "The Stanford
of the East."
While they're at it they might as well call the Healdsburg
Tribune "The Stanford Daily of Northern Sonoma County."
The ill-timed remark has also brought to our attention certain
obvious contrasts which we regret having to include here,
namely:
H.H.S.'s dramatic Red and.Black as against Stanford's sickly
Red and White;
Our majestic Greyhound as against Stanford's pitiful Little
Injun;
Our County Surveyor as against Stanford's President Hoover;
Our Bill Rose as against Stanford's John Steinbeck;
Our "For the Red and Black the Hounds are going in to do
or die" as against Stanford's "The Cardinal is waving over the
field."
Further comparisons would be superfluous. The fact of the
misnomer must now be evident to everyone. However, one
satisfaction remains. Geyserville High, H.H.S.'s nearest rival, is
known as "The Harvard of Northern Sonoma County."
I guess Healdsburg isn't so bad off at that.

The following paragraph is taken from yesterday's Daily:
"Paula Kanner . . . has designed beautiful formals made of
silver sequin tops and purple net skirts embroidered with sequins
which Cecelia Bergeda, Bob Fuller, and the other dancers will
wear."

The following paragraph is taken from yesterday's Daily:
"Paula Kanner . . . has designed beautiful formals made of
silver sequin tops and purple net skirts embroidered with sequins
which Cecelia Bergeda, Bob Fuller, and the other dancers will
wear."
(Are you going to be busy a week from Friday night, Bob?)

INSULT TO INJURY
The "Three Ex-Harvard Men," who expressed their righteous
indignation so capably in yesterday's Daily, struck a soft spot
in my heart. You see, my old alma mater, Healdsburg High, was
frequently referred to as "The Stanford of Northern Sonoma
County." So I consider myself gualified to appreciate the of
fense of the name Stanford when applied to any other school.
After all, Stanford (at Palo Alto) and H.H.S. have little in
common. Like Harvard, H.H.S. has its compensating factors.
But there is no legitimate reason why it should be called "The
Stanford of Northern Sonoma County" any more than that ven
erable Eastern seat of learning should be called "The Stanford
of the East."
While they're at it they might as well call the Healdsburg
Tribune "The Stanford Daily of Northern Sonoma County."
The ill-timed remark has also brought to our attention certain
obvious contrasts which we regret having to include here,
namely:
H.H.S.'s dramatic Red and.Black as against Stanford's sickly
Red and White;
Our majestic Greyhound as against Stanford's pitiful Little
Injun;
Our County Surveyor as against Stanford's President Hoover;
Our Bill Rose as against Stanford's John Steinbeck;
Our "For the Red and Black the Hounds are going in to do
or die" as against Stanford's "The Cardinal is waving over the
field."
Further comparisons would be superfluous. The fact of the
misnomer must now be evident to everyone. However, one
satisfaction remains. Geyserville High, H.H.S.'s nearest rival, is
known as "The Harvard of Northern Sonoma County."
I guess Healdsburg isn't so bad off at that.
