LONDON, Thursday, Dec. 2 (UP).
—Strong formations of U.S. Eighth
Air Force Flying Fortresses and Lib
erators blasted the German indus
trial center of Solingen yesterday
for the second time in 24 hours,
plowing through strong German
fighter plane opposition to complete
the third American bombardment of
the Reich in as many days.

CAIRO, Dec. 1. —President Roose
velt, Prime Minister Winston Chur
chill and Generalissimo Chiang Kai
shek at a momentous five-day con
ference in North Africa have agreed
on plans to crush Japan and strip her
of the vast territories she has seized
in nearly 50 years of aggression, it
was announced tonight.
Manchuria, Formosa, and all of
the Pacific islands which Japan has
seized or occupied since 1914 are to
be taken from her. Korea, which she
annexed in 1910, is to be made free.
After the conference, the Presi
dent and Churchill left for a secret
destination where they are expected
to confer with Marshal Josef Stalin
to cement plans for the swiftest pos-»
sible defeat of Germany so that the
United States, Great Britain and
China—if not Russia also—can turn
their overwhelming power unitedly
against Japan.
Concerning the North African con
ference, it was announced that:
1. Allied military leaders decided
on future military operations against
Japan.
2. The United States, Britain and
China will bring unrelenting pres
sure on their "brutal enemies" by
land, sea and air.
3. The Allies, fighting to restrain
and punish Japanese aggression, will
strip Japan of its conquests, not only
those in this war, but those dating
back to 1895 when Formosa was
taken from China.
4. The Allies will persevere in the
"serious and prolonged operations
necessary to procure the uncondi
tional surrender of Japan."
