"Turn up shirt collars before j|
washing them . .
This fella has the right idea—it's just his technique
that's a little sour. Shirt collars will last much
longer if they are turned up before being sent to
the laundry, for then the crease around the top
doesn't get such heavy ruhbing and consequently
lasts longer before fraying.
Another fine point to remember —when you
need new shirts, whether military or civilian, buy
Arrow. They live up to their fine reputation for
lasting wear and perfect fit. Don't forget the
Sanforized label, which guarantees fabric shrink
age less than 1%.
