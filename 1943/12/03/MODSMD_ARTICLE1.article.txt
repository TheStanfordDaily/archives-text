# F.D.R., Churchill, Stalin Confer at Tiran, Plan to Quarantine Nazis Between Frontiers After Cairo Meet With Chiang on Jap War
## Axis Fate Decided at Allied Meet 
### United Press 
LONDON. Dec. 2.—A quarantine
of Germany as the world's number
one aggressor under which she will
be thrown back within her original
rontiers and held there, is to be pro
claimed soon by President Roosevelt.
Prime Minister Winston Churchill,
and Marshal Josef Stalin, diplomatic
quarters reported tonight.
Axis and neutral broadcasts in
sisted the big three were now meet
ing at Til an. but Radio Vichy, Ger
man-controlled. said tonight in a
broadcast recorded here that the
meeting was being held at Tabriz, in
northwestern Iran which Marco Polo
once visited.
German broadcasts It'll no doubt
that the Nazis believed the Cairo
conference on Japan to be a prelim
inary to (he Iran meeting. Dr. Paul
Joset Guebbels, German propaganda
minister, led Nazi propagandists in
attempts to convince Germans and
foreign opinion that an Axis collapse
was impossible, no matter what the
big three nations might do.

Stalln conference in Cairo. Esvot. is held bv nolltlcal observers.

on the comeback trail by counter-attacking at Stalingrad.
Broad white band shows recaptured territory in year oi

Official announcements that Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-Shek had ar
rived at Chungking Tuesday after a
two-day flight from the Cairo con
ference indicated he did not par
ticipate in the reported Iran meeting.
Thus it appeared that Russia,
which is not at war with Japan,
would not be brought formally into
Allied talks in which China, Amer
ica, and Britain discussed the Pacific
war.
Diplomatic quarters forecast that
any Rooscvelt-Churchill-Stalin dec
laration probably would re-empha
size that total surrender was the only
end for Germany, and make it plain

that Nazi plans to build a third war
from underground cells—already be
ing formed—according to reports—
would be smashed.
It is believed here that a big three
declaration will leave Germans no
reason to hope that by putting out
peace feelers through alleged "con
servatives" or others they can nego
tiate peace now, so that Germany,
with its manpower relatively intact,
would be aide to rebuild and breed
for a new war while its ravished
neighbors took years and decades to
recover.
There was strong belief that de
tails of a second front in Europe
were discussed at the recent Moscow
conference, but diplomats awaited

eagerly word of military as well as
political representation at any big
three conference.
Discussing the Cairo conference,
well-informed quarters believed a
giant blow might be struck at Japan
from the Asia mainland, possibly in
conjunction with an Allied attack in
the Pacific, before the monsoon sea
son next spring. It was pointed out;
that enormous supply problems must,
be met and that Admiral Lord Louis
Mounlbatten, now Allied commander
in southeast Asia, when he attended
the Cairo conference, was only on.

meeting was being held at Tabriz, in
northwestern Iran which Marco Polo
once visited.
German broadcasts It'll no doubt
that the Nazis believed the Cairo
conference on Japan to be a prelim

Joset Guebbels, German propaganda
minister, led Nazi propagandists in
attempts to convince Germans and
foreign opinion that an Axis collapse
was impossible, no matter what the

on the comeback trail by counter-attacking at Stalingrad.
Broad white band shows recaptured territory in year oi
fighting. Territory is now greater than Russian area stii!
held by Nazis. Russians continue its increase.
Official announcements that Gen
eralissimo Chiang Kai-Shek had ar
rived at Chungking Tuesday after a
two-day flight from the Cairo con
ference indicated he did not par
ticipate in the reported Iran meeting.
Thus it appeared that Russia,
which is not at war with Japan,
would not be brought formally into
Allied talks in which China, Amer
ica, and Britain discussed the Pacific
war.
Diplomatic quarters forecast that
any Rooscvelt-Churchill-Stalin dec
laration probably would re-empha
size that total surrender was the only
end for Germany, and make it plain

that Nazi plans to build a third war
from underground cells—already be
ing formed—according to reports—
would be smashed.
It is believed here that a big three
declaration will leave Germans no
reason to hope that by putting out
peace feelers through alleged "con
servatives" or others they can nego
tiate peace now, so that Germany,
with its manpower relatively intact,
would be aide to rebuild and breed
for a new war while its ravished
