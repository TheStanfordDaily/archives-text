# Speaking Knowledge Stressed In Army Language Program
## 
### 
If one were to go wandering about the language section of the Stanford
grounds, he would probably think himself lost in some foreign embassy.
Stanford at present boasts the teaching of not one but nine different
languages, namely, German, Italian, French, Spanish, Russian, Chinese,
Dutch, Japanese, and Malay.
The Army places primary emphasis on ability to speak the language.

Reading and writing of the language,
which was of primary importance in
teaching a language before, has now
stepped down and is used only as a
means of facilitating the spoken lan
guage. Fluency of speech in nine
months is the Army's objective.
Classes are usually divided up
into squads of 10 men each. The
purpose is to make the students
themselves speak the language
rather than listen to an instructor's
lecture. This oral drill method has
proved successful in meeting Army
requirements.
The overall objective of the For
eign Area and Language program at
Stanford is to give to the trainee in
nine months two things: a working
and speaking knowledge of one for
eign language; and an intensive
knowledge concerning the specific
areas of these countries.
The purpose of foreign area classes
is to weave into a common pattern
not only the political and geographic
information of these countries, but
also a knowledge of customs, folk
ways, religion, industries, economic
background, recent historical de
velopment, and so forth. This will
enable the soldiers to get along with
the natives of the regions concerned.
Because the program is a concen
trated one, it demands a very close
coordination between the language
and area parts. This is accomplished
in great part by presenting problems
and projects to the trainees which
require a knowledge of both area
characteristics and language of the
country involved. So far this method
of teaching has proved highly suc
cessful in the Army Specialized
Training Program.


TYPICAL foreign language oral class. Soldier in center is being questioned in Chinese by a Dutch Indies
Ensign. These oral classes have proved very successful in speeding the trainees' fluency in the language.
