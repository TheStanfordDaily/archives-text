# Farm ASTU's Shown Movies
## 
### 
The ASTU trainees have just seen
the third weekly series of the G.I.
movies.
These movies, arranged for by the
commandant, are shown each Thurs
day in the Education Auditorium;
the first show starting at 1715 and
the second at 1800.
This week the program consisted
of the Army-Navy Screen Magazine,
with such subtitles as "Jap Weap
ons," "Elmer the Great with Joe E.
Brown," "On to Bataan," and "Snafu
in Fighting Weapons." The program
includes "Information Please" with
Boris Karloff and Football Thrills.
The shows run for approximately
40 minutes; and are timed so that
trainees can attend either before or
after mess. The attendance was light
at the first showing, but is growing
steadily.
G.I. Movies is a produce of the
Army Service Forces, and handled
by the Special Services Department.
The films are being shown to army
personnel only.
G.I. Movies gives the trainees a
period of relaxation during their
week of strenuous studies.
