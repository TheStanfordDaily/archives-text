# European Education Is Subject of Controversy
## 
### Joe Hawkins 
Considerable controversy has been
brewing since the printing in the
Nov. 22 issue of The Daily of an
article expressing Ffc. Otto Brand's
views on a comparison between the
European and American educational
systems. This came to a head yes
terday in a Campus Opinion letter,
and with statements from repre
sentatives of about 15 foreign-born
9-L students revising some of Pfc.
Brand's statements. These men, it
seems, are motivated by a desire to
make absolutely clear to the faculty
and student body the exact situation
as it exists in Europe.
The main objection raised is that
the opinions expressed in the original
article appeared to apply to most of
Europe, while in reality they were
mainly concerned with German and
Austrian educational institutions. In
the information which he gave, Pfc.
Brand did his best to make clear the
point that his views would cover
only his experiences at the Univer
sity of Vienna, and as such would
probably not be entirely true for the
rest of Europe.
Spokesmen for this group of 9-L
students, which included students
from 10 European countries—Ger
many, Austria, France, Czechoslo
vakia, Switzerland, Hungary, Poland,
Italy, Spain, and Yugoslavia—also
wanted to add several clarifying
statements to help give a truer pic
ture. They contended that the article
made the average European student
seem like a beer-drinking, contin
ually dueling, gad-about who was
occupied mainly with daring esca
pades from the law after engaging in
fierce, forbidden duels. Such, of
course, is not the case. It is true that
dueling was outlawed in all coun
tries until Hitler reinstated it in
Germany. However, these spokes
men estimated that more than 75
per cent of European students led an
ordinary, peaceful life, and did not
belong to any organization which en
gaged in any such activities.
In describing the situation of those
few who did belong to some "fra
ternity," representatives of the 9-L
group explained that prestige or class
counted for very much in such or
ganizations. Thus the Korps is a
more exclusive type of frat for the
aristocratic class and is "more on the

gay side"; the Burschenschaft, on
the other hand, is much stricter on
principles, including dueling. Al
though dueling is against the law,
local authorities often "close their
eyes" because of political "pull."
Both these types of frats are often
very political, "reactionary to the
right," and engage in general agita
tion. The spokesmen explained that
the slaughters which occurred after
the German occupation of Czecho
slovakia were caused in part by just
such counter-reactionary groups of
students.
These representatives, in clarifying
the frat situation in Europe, con
tinued by saying that the advantages
of membership were much the same
as in this country: general compan
ionship, and a feeling of brothership
in later life toward the members
scattered all over the world. How
ever, the frats are not a part of uni
versity life, since the only buildings
on the school grounds are used en
tirely for teaching. Thus the richer
students live off the campus in small
apartments, while most live as room
ers.
The other foreign students also
disagreed somewhat as to Brand's
statement on co-education in Europe.
According to them, although the
system can be co-educational, it only
rarely is, since women students are
much older and more serious than
here. In other words, women go to
university only if they plan to follow
through and become "career wom
en." Here, on the other hand, women
go to college even when they have no
intention of continuing in a particu
lar profession.
These delegates agreed with Pfc.
Otto Brand in many cases, for they
emphasized the fact that it would be
"unthinkable" for any European
student to work his way through
school, since he always concentrated
entirely on his studies. In America,
however, it is the "exception rather
than the rule for a student not to
work for at least part of his keep."
Pfc. Brand is not to be criticized
to any great extent, however, since
the spokesmen indicated that they
agreed whole-heartedly with his
statement that "undoubtedly the
overwhelming majority of American
students lead a much happier life
than the Europeans."
