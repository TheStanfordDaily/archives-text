## New Soccer Team Wins 
### 
The newly organized soccer league
has already filled out its ranks with
a total of seven teams, and has
played three league games since last
Saturday. Squads which have been
formed and enrolled in the league
include: Co. LFA, Co. K, Stars,
Pierce, Varsity, Encina Engineers,
and Roosevelt.
Saturday, Nov. 27, the first official
league game was played at which
time the Co. K team beat Roosevelt
Hall by a score of 9-1. League play
for this week has included Monday:
Co. LFA won over Pierce Hall by
3-1, and Wednesday: Stars over
Pierce Hall by a score of 6-1.
This afternoon at 4:45 play-offs
continue when the Stanford Varsity
meets Roosevelt Hall on the Intra
mural field. Saturday really promises
a battle when the Stars meet Co. K
at 1:30 p.m. Both teams play very
well considering the short time they
have been formed, as evidenced by
their relatively high scores in their
respective starting games. Students
are urged to attend since the game
should be quite a thriller.
This soccer league was started by
the inspiration of Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports, and Pfc.
Otto Brand, chairman of the league
organization committee. Last Tues
day final plans were made and now
representatives of all teams are to
meet every Wednesday at Pierce
Hall at 9 p.m. At this time the sched
ule for the following week will be
set as to time and place, and referees
will be determined. Although there
is some difficulty for the teams to
find time from their crowded army
class schedules to practice, repre
sentatives stated that their com
manding officers were cooperating
very well in this respect. The league
schedule is made out for only a week
at a time since soldiers may be
shipped out on 24-hour notice at any
time.
Formerly there was some difficulty
due to the fact that the Stanford
varsity has regular soccer equip
ment, while the soldier teams are
forced to play with ordinary G.I.
shoes. This has been ironed out,
however, since a fund furnished by
the league provides regular soccer
shoes for those teams playing the
varsity.

This soccer league was started by
the inspiration of Harry Maloney,
director of minor sports, and Pfc.
Otto Brand, chairman of the league
organization committee. Last Tues
day final plans were made and now
representatives of all teams are to
meet every Wednesday at Pierce
Hall at 9 p.m. At this time the sched
ule for the following week will be
set as to time and place, and referees
will be determined. Although there
is some difficulty for the teams to
find time from their crowded army
class schedules to practice, repre
sentatives stated that their com
manding officers were cooperating
very well in this respect. The league
schedule is made out for only a week
at a time since soldiers may be
shipped out on 24-hour notice at any
time.
Formerly there was some difficulty
due to the fact that the Stanford
varsity has regular soccer equip
ment, while the soldier teams are
forced to play with ordinary G.I.
shoes. This has been ironed out,
however, since a fund furnished by
the league provides regular soccer
shoes for those teams playing the
varsity.
The newly organized soccer league
has already filled out its ranks with
a total of seven teams, and has
played three league games since last
Saturday. Squads which have been
formed and enrolled in the league
include: Co. LFA, Co. K, Stars,
Pierce, Varsity, Encina Engineers,
and Roosevelt.
Saturday, Nov. 27, the first official
league game was played at which
time the Co. K team beat Roosevelt
Hall by a score of 9-1. League play
for this week has included Monday:
Co. LFA won over Pierce Hall by
3-1, and Wednesday: Stars over
Pierce Hall by a score of 6-1.
This afternoon at 4:45 play-offs
continue when the Stanford Varsity
meets Roosevelt Hall on the Intra
mural field. Saturday really promises
a battle when the Stars meet Co. K
at 1:30 p.m. Both teams play very
well considering the short time they
have been formed, as evidenced by
their relatively high scores in their
respective starting games. Students
are urged to attend since the game
should be quite a thriller.
