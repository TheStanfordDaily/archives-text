## 
### 
For the 45th consecutive year,
Stanford's annual fall production,
'he Gaieties, will be presented to
night in all its traditional color, but
.vith the wartime touch of "olive
drab." From the opener, "Be Happy,
Tonight," to the finale, "See Ya on
Quad," the Gaieties is a show of
sparkling' entertainment and fun.
The skits, songs, costumes, and
dances fall in line to make an eve
ning of light-hearted amusement.
The performance will start as the
famous little green campus bus ap
pears on stage in the first skit, "Jam
miii* the Tram." Bernice Linden will
portray the part of the refined, good
living, but nice, nevertheless, "nice"
lady bus driver, while Hubert HefT
ner will conduct the audience
through a tour of Leland Stanford
Junior University as a travelogue
announcer.
Second on the program will be a
duet by Bev Richards and Don Lan
dale entitled "I Believe I Belong,"
which was written by Musical Di
rector Blossom Parke.
Appearing at this point and at in
tervals during the show will be Ed
Costikyan burlesquing the commer
cial radio announcer. Following
Costikyan will be the native number,
noted on the program as "Torrid
Traipsings in the Tropics," produced
by Co-dance Director Jacques Ogg
from primitive Martinique ritual
music.
Blossom Parke will do a repeat of
her song from the '42 Gaieties, "Love
Plays the Strangest Games." Also
a repeat will be the boogie-woogie
dance which was previewed in the
Orchesis concert last spring.

A satire on the changed conditions
j that not only exist on the Farm, but
also in its hangouts, will be por
trayed by Nan Tillson and a male
quintet in "Every Night Is Ladies'
Night at Belt's," words and music by
Doug Hastings and Gordy Jacobs.
| Also satirical is the "Swoon You
Goon" skit, a take-off on "Bedroom
Baritone" Frank Sinatra. Jack Law
son will imitate the school girl's de
| light, supported by Dick Carter as
the announcer, Alex Adams, Lois
Williams, Bene Zentner, Jane Spaul
! din"", Ellen Marcus, and 10 "swoon
: crs."
Orchestra Leader Claude Wilson's
haunting melody, "Jericho," will
provide the music for the next dance
which will be performed by Anne
Smith, Martha Stratton, Betye Mo-
I nell, Jacques Ogg, and Janice
| Shaughnessy.
The second half of the show will
start off with a production number
entitled "Pin-up Girl"—or "Tack Up
That Sack." Bud Irving, who ap
peared in the Broadway production
of "Best Food Forward" before en
tering the Army, will sing the song
to his pin-up girls: Mayme Ruth
Faris, Julie Crommelin. Mary Lou
Patton, Pat Jones, and Betty Jane
Tweedy.
The experiences of a fighter pilot
will then be exhibited by Herbert
Rubin in the skit, "Smilin' Jerk." A
title bit of old-fashioned vaudeville
will be inserted by Doug Hastings
and Dick Driscoll in their lament
that "It Ain't the Same Old Farm."
Twenty-four hours in the life of a
I Stanford ASTU will be caricatured
] in "Strictly G.1.," written by two
| soldiers, Don Shannon and Gene
May. A feminine trio composed of
Jane Gillespie, Mary Iluntsherger,
and Barbara Snyder will then emote
with "City Rich," the theme song of
the lady defense worker.
A spectacular song and dance rou
tine has been built around another
Parke number, "Cabernet and Can
dlelight." Don Landale will first
serenade Helen Savory, followed by
the waltzers, Cecelia Bergeda, Bob
Fuller, Nancy Lnngley, Jack Picker -
j ing, JSrlda Leaf, Louis Plotnek, Lei-
I lani Brink, and Dick Ogg.
Jane Spaulding will then help the
audience toward better health in a
; monologue entitled, "Build That
| Body" or "Quizzical Fhysical."
A Harlem number, "Dusky Down
beat," will appear next, featuring
Nan Tillson singing "You Big At-
I tractive Man," succeeded by Claude
Wilsons' interpretation of his own
composition. "Ten Bucks and Twen

ty-four Hours Leave." A dance 1«>
(lie same music will then be done by
Miss Shaughnessv. Elaine Barrett.
Jane Gillespie, Gloria Olivi, Zan
Evans, and Bob Fuller.
The last of the variety of skits is
the lampooning of the Li be, called
"Stax, Crax, and Cold Hard Facts,"
showing how the well run library
should not be.
The spectacular climax for the
Gaieties build around the familiar
Stanford saying, "See Ya on Quad."
will utilize the entire east and end
the Gaieties for another year.
