# After the Gaieties
## 
### 
TOMORROW night after the Gaieties Cap and Gown will take
over the Nitery as the first sponsors of Saturday night fes
tivities in the redecorated Canteen.
The Canteen is completely finished now as the red and white
bar arrived this week. And this Saturday night's entertainment
is a chance not only to see the new Nitery, but also to have a
lot of on-campus fun.
Cap and Gown will act as hostesses for the dancing and
lefreshment period. Their calendars will be on sale for those on
campus and will be mailed for any who wish to send them
home.
Tomorrow night will also have another feature when Theta
Sigma Phi opens its news bureau to send out releases to the home
town papers for members of the army units stationed here.
All in all tomorrow night is a grand opportunity for good
entertainment without using any gas or bus fare.â€”Esther Belew
