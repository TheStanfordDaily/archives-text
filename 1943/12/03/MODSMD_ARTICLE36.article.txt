### BILL ROSE 
A BARGAIN AT ANY PRICE
Tonight marks another milestone in Stanford's history as a
university at war. For the first time there will be a Big Game
Gaieties without a Big Game. This might bring to mind that
"square root of a 301 squared" the waitress in the Cellar offered
me; but, fortunately, there is a good deal more sense behind it.
Whether the Big Game gave birth to the Gaieties or the
Gaieties to the Big Game, I do not know (I also don't know the
one about the chicken and the egg). I do know that a group
of spirited students under the able leadership of Jean Levinson
have proven that you can still have a Gaieties even though there
is no longer a Big Game.
And why not? The Gaietites never had much to do with the
Big Game anyway. There's just as much—if not more—talent
around this year than ever before. And there's no reason v/hy
this year's Gaieties should not be as big a success as its prede
cessors.
From what I've seen and heard of "Stanford Goes G.1:," it
promises to be just that. The Gaieties publicity director has
told you, in her inimitable way, of the thrills in store; so there
is little sense in my going over them.
All I can do is suggest that you go. Seeing Moofie Farris or
B. J. Tweedy in a bathing suit ought to be worth a buck thirty
five to any Stanford male. And for the women, there's always
Bob Fuller—in sequins and purple net!
* # * *
Again I have been misunderstood. The column on my trip
to the Libe was intended as a humorous exposition of a situation
which no one will deny exists. If it wasn't humorous, I'm sorry.
However, I see no reason for apologizing to those persons I
offended. I meant no harm. Those who felt a sting in my "rapier
wit" must attribute it to their hypersensibility.
I reiterate that I have nothing against the U.S. armed forces.
(A lot of good it would do me if I did!) I am not a civilian out
of choice. So let's bury the hatchet. Huh, fellas? I'm really not
such a bad guy. Cut off my other head and I r m pretty normal,
in fact.
* * * *
I had the honor to be in on Cap and Gown's tapping Wednes
day night. It was a very impressive ceremony conducted by a
highly creditable organization. I especially enjoyed it, because
two girls at the table where I was sitting were tapped. This meant
they had to leave their dinner untouched which meant that I got
an extra dinner which means that I'm all out for Cap and Gown.

is no longer a Big Game.
And why not? The Gaietites never had much to do with the
Big Game anyway. There's just as much—if not more—talent
around this year than ever before. And there's no reason v/hy
this year's Gaieties should not be as big a success as its prede
cessors.
From what I've seen and heard of "Stanford Goes G.1:," it
promises to be just that. The Gaieties publicity director has
told you, in her inimitable way, of the thrills in store; so there
is little sense in my going over them.
All I can do is suggest that you go. Seeing Moofie Farris or
B. J. Tweedy in a bathing suit ought to be worth a buck thirty
five to any Stanford male. And for the women, there's always
Bob Fuller—in sequins and purple net!

Again I have been misunderstood. The column on my trip
to the Libe was intended as a humorous exposition of a situation
which no one will deny exists. If it wasn't humorous, I'm sorry.
However, I see no reason for apologizing to those persons I
offended. I meant no harm. Those who felt a sting in my "rapier
wit" must attribute it to their hypersensibility.
I reiterate that I have nothing against the U.S. armed forces.
(A lot of good it would do me if I did!) I am not a civilian out
of choice. So let's bury the hatchet. Huh, fellas? I'm really not
such a bad guy. Cut off my other head and I r m pretty normal,
in fact.

I had the honor to be in on Cap and Gown's tapping Wednes
day night. It was a very impressive ceremony conducted by a
highly creditable organization. I especially enjoyed it, because
two girls at the table where I was sitting were tapped. This meant
they had to leave their dinner untouched which meant that I got
an extra dinner which means that I'm all out for Cap and Gown.
A BARGAIN AT ANY PRICE
Tonight marks another milestone in Stanford's history as a
university at war. For the first time there will be a Big Game
Gaieties without a Big Game. This might bring to mind that
"square root of a 301 squared" the waitress in the Cellar offered
me; but, fortunately, there is a good deal more sense behind it.
Whether the Big Game gave birth to the Gaieties or the
Gaieties to the Big Game, I do not know (I also don't know the
one about the chicken and the egg). I do know that a group
of spirited students under the able leadership of Jean Levinson
have proven that you can still have a Gaieties even though there
is no longer a Big Game.
