# B.Q. Morgan To Prepare Bibliography
## 
### 
Professor B. Q. Morgan, of the
Germanic Languages Department,
has been invited to collaborate in
the preparation of a '"Bibliographi
cal Guide to Comparative Litera
ture and Inter-cultural Under
standing," to be published by the
American Library Association.
The guide is to be prepared under
the joint sponsorship of the Ameri
can Library Association, the Asso
ciation of American Colleges, and
the National Council of Teachers of
English, and will be published on a
non-profit basis with the financial
backing of the Rockefeller Founda
tion.
An editorial committee of special
ists in the various fields covered by
the guide is being assembled for its
preparation. Professor Morgan's
participation is derived from his
critical bibliography of German lit
erature in English translation which
was published several years ago by
the Stanford Press.
Professor Morgan has also re
cently been appointed to serve on a
sub-committee of the Commission
on Trends in Education of the Mod
ern Language Association of Amer
ica and is to prepare a report on
Foreign Languages in American
Education.
