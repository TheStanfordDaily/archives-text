# Woolley Film Disappointing
## 
### 
HOLY MATRIMONY—now playing
at the Stanford Theater
''Holy Matrimony" is a quaint
little film with an English back
ground that gives comedienne Gra
de Fields her first big movie role.
But even Miss Fields must play
second fiddle to the irresistible
Monty Woolley. For "Holy Matri
mony" is "the Beard's" picture.
Woolley Ls seen as a famous Eng
lish painter, Priam Fahrr, who, to
gether with his butler, has led a
secluded life. Upon the death of his
butler, Woolley says that it was
Fahrr who died. From there on it's
the old mistaken identity story as
Woolley wishes to avoid all pub
licity.
But Monty meets Miss Fields and
marriage rapidly ensues. After three
years of married life, Miss Fields
finds out Woolley's true identity and
the picture comes to a climax in a
hilarious courtroom scene.
This reviewer was disappointed in
"Holy Matrimony"—not because of
the acting, for Miss Fields and
Woolley are both splendid, but be
cause the story just doesn't give the
above pair enough room to display
their respective talents. There are
many amusing moments—but the
plot at times fails to keep the pic
ture above water.
The second feature stars the for
mer cowboy star Don "Red" Barry
in a gangster-melodrama called
"the West Side Kid." "Red"' Barry
is seen as a lad from the wrong side
of the tracks, which is just where
the picture should have stayed.
There's the usual poor cast with the
usual poor story. And thus con
cludes the visual poor review. —
