# Red Cross Needs Dressings Badly
## 
### 
Attendance in the Red Cross surgi
j cal dressing room has been very poor
lately, and the quota of 1000 dress
| ings a day has not been filled for
| two weeks, according to Twink Da
! vies, Red Cross chairman.
Last week on Monday, Tuesday,
and Wednesday afternoons only 1800
dressings were made, which is just
'a little more than half the quota.
This week on Monday 570 dressings
were made, on Tuesday 750, and on
Wednesday about 200.
Girls, instead of working the en
tire hour -they pledged, have been
arriving 15 minutes late and then
I only working 45 minutes, according
i to Miss Davies. By doing this they
| are not fulfilling their war work
I hours, and of greater importance, tin
j surgical dressings which are needed
| to help win the war are not being
| made.
j Girls who have pledged their time
i to the surgical dressing room are
j reminded to work the hours they
'have volunteered for and help Oil
; the quota.'
