U.S. PACIFIC FLEET H.Q.,
Dec. 2. — Twenty Japanese planes
have been destroyed, probably de
stroyed. or damaged in the Gilbert-
Marshall island group in three en
gagements, two against American
planes, the third against two de
stroyers, Admiral Chester W. Nimitz
announced tonight.
Several of the American planes
were damaged but none was downed
and the destroyers escaped without
damage, for an almost perfect record
■ ~i the first real enemy air challenge
since the United States Marines and
infantry occupied the Gilbert islands.
It was said officially, however, that
casualties were feared heavy in the
sinking of the small escort carrier
Liscome Bay—the only ship lost in
the entire Gilbert operations —which
was sunk, it was announced at
Washington, by a Japanese sub
marine Nov. 24.
The first sign that the Japanese
had begun to try to come back after
their major defeat in the Gilberts
came Monday when a fleet of tor
pedo planes savagly attacked two of
the Navy's destroyers cruising in
the Gilberts.
Again, and again, as the powerful
destroyer batteries laid on their fire,
the enemy planes dived to the attack.
Three of them were downed, two
more probably shot down, and the
Japanese formation gave up, beaten.
Next day four-motored Liberator
bombers of Maj. Gen. Willis H. Hale's
Seventh Air Force .struck heavily at
the Taroa airdrome, on the Naloelap
atoll in the eastern chain of the Mar
shall islands, between the Mille and
the Wotje atoll groups.
Thirty-five Japanese Zero fighters
rose to try to intercept the Liber
ators. Seven, perhaps more, were
-hot down. At least four were dam
aged. Two members of the Liber

ator crews were wounded, but all
the planes returned.
In the third engagement, a single
Navy Liberator of Nimitz' Navy
Fleet Air Wing was cruising over
Mille Tuesday on a search mission
when six Zeros attacked it.
The Liberator shot down one Zero,
probably destroyed another, and
probably damaged two more. It got
back too.
