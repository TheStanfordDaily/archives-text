# Date Chairman Fosters New Bureau System
## 
### 
Now that the smoke has cleared
away from the battlefield (the
"Daily's" letter column), it might be
well to check up on some aspects of
the so-called "social problem" facing
Stanford G.l.'s. As you will remem
ber, cracks about "Mission street
commandos" and "thistle - parkin'
mamas" were flying back and forth,
without anybody bothering to dig
out the facts behind the whole thing.
Actually, blind-date bureaus
have been working in all principal
women's residences on the campus
for months. Fellows just had to
notify their social chairmen within
reasonable time of their desire for
feminine companionship, and, in
most cases they'd find what they
could expect: A blind date
Yet blind dates have always been
risky propositions at the most, i.e.,
maybe she is what you wanted (and
vice versa), and a good time is had
by all. Usually, however, the affair
doesn't come up to expectations.
But a clear-headed, energetic
energetic young lady at Lagunita
had a good idea, and went ahead to
do something about it: Norma
Trevorrow's Individualized Date
Bureau in Casa Magnolia has been

working for several weeks now
with definite success.
'"And," said Norma, "70 per cent
of the dates resulted in re-dates."
the best proof for the practicality of
her idea anyone could ask for.
Norma prepared and distributed
elaborate questionnaires among the
girls of Casa Magnolia. Thus she
now has over 60 girls classified ac
cording to their age, height, home
towns, majors, hobbies, and interests.
She can also tell you whether your
prospective date likes to smoke, and
have an occasional cocktail, or
whether she prefers cokes, moon
gazing, and the WCTU.
Here again the procedure for
G.l.'s is simple: Notify your social
chairman early in the week that
you would like an individualized
date. He will then ask you some
questions about yourself, since it
is only fair that the girls get some
idea of their dates.
Norma has found that a short
"coke date'' in the middle of the
week, during a break period, will
often show whether the two selected
partners really fit together. That is
why she insists on bids being handed
in before Wednesday.
Her two great headaches are fel
lows who break their dates at the
last moment, and engaged men who
try to conceal these facts. There are
a number of engaged girls at Mag
nolia who would be glad to date men
with the mutual understanding that,
since romantic interests are already
taken care of, they would meet lor
| the sake of companionship only.
