# REVIEW
## 'Princess' Film Is Surprise Hit 
### 
PRINCESS O'ROURKE—Now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Warner Bros.' "Princess O'Rourke"
is a light, fluffy Cinderella type story
of royalty and romance with demure
Olivia de Havilland and affable
Robert Cummings in the feature
roles. Genial Jack Carson and gruff
Charles Coburn head the supporting
cast.
Miss De Havilland portrays a
European princess of royal blood
who is staying in this country for the
duration with Uncle Charles Coburn.
Uncle Charlie wants her to marry
into nobility but while on an air
plane trip West the Princess runs
into Co-pilot Johnny O'Rourke
(Robert Cummings). She takes too
many sleeping pills on the trip and
is forced to sleep it off in O'Rourke's
apartment.
This leads to the usual complica
tions and a whirlwind romance en
sues. Finally O'Rourke and the
Princess are married at the White
House above the protests of Uncle
Coburn.
"Princess O'Rourke" will probably
be one of the surprise films of the
year. With excellent dialogue and a
competent cast, it shapes up as a
grand treat. But don't take the kid
dies—for many of the lines will be
a bit snappy for them. But then why
should there be any kids around
here?
The second feature, "Mystery
Broadcast," is a whodunit that fea
tures Ruth Terry as a radio sleuth
who solves the mystery of the crying
pines. Of course the murderer can
be any one of a dozen suspects, of
which you'll probably think dapper
Nils Asther is the logical choice.
Surprisingly enough, it's a passable
second feature.—Bovver
