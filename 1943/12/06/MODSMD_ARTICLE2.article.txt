# BLOOD BANK
## Donors Needed To Fill Quota 
### 
The last day for Stanford students
to donate their blood this quarter
will be Thursday, Dec. 16, Chairman
Helen Herring announced last night.
Thirty soldiers and students must
volunteer as donors this week to fill
the Stanford quota.
Donors give their blood at the
Blood Bank located at the Com
munity Center in Palo Alto. The
times for Stanford appointments are
11:20, 11:40, 1:20, and 1:40.
Unless the donor is 21, he must
have a permission slip signed by both
parents. These slips are available at
the War Board office, and may also
be obtained through the War Board
representatives in the living groups.
The donor should turn in his
signed permission slip at the War
Board office and at that time sign
up for the appointment desired. A
person may not donate blood until
eight weeks have elapsed since his
last donation. He must also weigh at
least 110 pounds.
If a donor needs transportation to
the Palo Alto Blood Bank, the Red
Cross Motor Corps will have a sta
tion wagon on the Engineering Cor
ner 20 minutes before the time of his
appointment and take him in, and
transportation will also be provided
back to campus.
