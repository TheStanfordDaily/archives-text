TOMORROW'S DAILY
TOMORROW morning when you reach for your Daily at the
Post Office or on Quad, you'll find a 16-page sheet instead of
the usual four-page edition. Just in case you're wondering why
the staff should work long and hard for such an edition, look at
the top of any page. It will say:
"The Stanford Daily, Tuesday, December 7, 1943."—1rma
