### BILL ROSE 
CONGRATULATIONS
THE Gaieties is over, but certainly not forgotten. I doubt if
there was a person who attended who did not enjoy the show
thoroughly. Bull Session sends plaudits to all concerned with
the production of "Stanford Goes G.1."
Jean Levinson need have made no excuse. This year's Gai
eties was on a par with any we have seen—war or no war. The
Paly Bus, the Sinatra number, Jericho, "Every Night Is Ladies
Night," and, of course, Nan Tillson, have taken their deserved
place in our memories of laughs on the Farm.
And after the show Saturday night there was Cap and Gown's
(I told you that was a good outfit) highly successful party in the
Nitery and the Women's Clubhouse. The turnout for this affair
was beyond all expectation. But Cap and Gown was more than
pleased, for the proceeds from the party will enable them to
furnish a room in Dibble Hosiptal in Menlo Park through the
Camp and Hospital Committee of the Red Cross.
Things like the Gaieties and the benefit party make Stanford
look good. We can well be proud of our public-spirited students.
Tomorrow night the Tuesday Series is showing —free of
charge—the film we'll never forget —"The Informer." This movie
is far above the average and certainly worth an hour and a half
of your time.
Those of us who have seen it will surely go. To those who
didn't may I suggest your taking it in. The admission is free,
which is more than I can say for a movie anywhere else.
