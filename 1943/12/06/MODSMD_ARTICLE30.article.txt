"BORROWED" BIKES
To the Editor:
WHY all this fuss about traditions and saying hello to one
another when things are being "borrowed" from right under one s
nose? Who feels like smiling and saying hello to anyone when
the person who is bestowing such a sweet return smile may be
the very one who has just "borrowed" your transportation?
This petty thievery is beyond a mere laughing stage. Bicycles
are the only means of transportation to and from the campus for
many students.
The Stanford Indian must be cardinal with shame to see one
of the finest of all the Stanford traditions vanish as has the tradi
tion of honesty.
I Ain't Gonna Smile No More!
