The North African conference be
tween President Roosevelt, Winston
Churchill, and Chiang Kai-Shek is
significant in several different ways,
according to John W. Masland, as
sociate professor of political science
and a member of the staff of the Far
Eastern Area and Language Unit at
Stanford.
"We can expect an acceleration 111
offensive activity against Japan and
an increase in pressure from the
Marshalls, New Guinea, and from
India into Burma and Southeastern
Asia," Professor Masland states.
The North African statement was
the first to be made by the three Al
lies concerning Japan's post-war
treatment. Although spokesmen
from China have made frequent
comments on their country's desires
for total demobilization of Japan, in
cluding stripping the country of its
heavy industries and shipping acti
vities, the United States and Great
Britain have issued no previous
statement of their policy toward
Japan. Professor Masland points out
that the new development refers
only to territorial problems to be
solved in the post-war period.
Professor Masland comments that
the statement "left unanswered sev
eral questions of interest." One of
these questions is in regard to the
mandated islands which the Allied

leaders have declared will be de
tached from Japanese control, and
which they declare are not coveted
by any Allied nation. These declara
tions would seem to indicate, accord
ing to Professor Masland, that an
international arrangement will hold
the Japanese islands after the war.
Another question that arises from
the disclosed aims of the conference
is that of Korea's post-war standing
which will be as an independent na
tion "in due time," the statement
declares. Professor Masland remarks
that it will be interesting to see what
type of government Korea will have
in the interim.
Since Japan has extensive proper
ties in China and Manchuria, Pro
fessor Masland mentions that it is
not yet decided how these properties
will be distributed.
Another subject made interesting
by its total omission from the state
ment was the handling of South
Sakhalin, which Japan won from
Russia in 1905. Its omission was un
doubtedly planned to prevent Kusso-
Japanese friction, according to Pro
fessor Masland.
Professor Masland believes that,
in general, the present significance of
the North African conference will be
the continued pressure upon Japan
in the Pacific and Southeastern Asia,
and that its significance for the fu
ture is that of being the first joint
statement of post-war plans.

the North African conference will be
the continued pressure upon Japan
in the Pacific and Southeastern Asia,
and that its significance for the fu
ture is that of being the first joint
statement of post-war plans.
The North African conference be
tween President Roosevelt, Winston
Churchill, and Chiang Kai-Shek is
significant in several different ways,
according to John W. Masland, as
sociate professor of political science
and a member of the staff of the Far
Eastern Area and Language Unit at
Stanford.
"We can expect an acceleration 111
offensive activity against Japan and
an increase in pressure from the
Marshalls, New Guinea, and from
India into Burma and Southeastern
Asia," Professor Masland states.
The North African statement was
the first to be made by the three Al
lies concerning Japan's post-war
treatment. Although spokesmen
from China have made frequent
comments on their country's desires
for total demobilization of Japan, in
cluding stripping the country of its
heavy industries and shipping acti
vities, the United States and Great
Britain have issued no previous
statement of their policy toward
Japan. Professor Masland points out
that the new development refers
only to territorial problems to be
solved in the post-war period.
Professor Masland comments that
the statement "left unanswered sev
eral questions of interest." One of
these questions is in regard to the
mandated islands which the Allied

leaders have declared will be de
tached from Japanese control, and
which they declare are not coveted
by any Allied nation. These declara
tions would seem to indicate, accord
ing to Professor Masland, that an
international arrangement will hold
the Japanese islands after the war.
Another question that arises from
the disclosed aims of the conference
is that of Korea's post-war standing
which will be as an independent na
tion "in due time," the statement
declares. Professor Masland remarks
that it will be interesting to see what
type of government Korea will have
in the interim.
Since Japan has extensive proper
ties in China and Manchuria, Pro
fessor Masland mentions that it is
not yet decided how these properties
will be distributed.
Another subject made interesting
by its total omission from the state
ment was the handling of South
Sakhalin, which Japan won from
Russia in 1905. Its omission was un
doubtedly planned to prevent Kusso-
Japanese friction, according to Pro
fessor Masland.
Professor Masland believes that,
in general, the present significance of
the North African conference will be
the continued pressure upon Japan
in the Pacific and Southeastern Asia,

ture is that of being the first joint
