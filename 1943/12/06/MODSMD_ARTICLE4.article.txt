# Gaieties' Portrayal of Farm at War Praised
## 
### Dave Davis 
The Gaieties of 1943 jumped, bounced, sa
luted, turned handsprings, laughed and cried—
to give the impression that deep down under
its khaki coating, it's still the same old Farm.
Perhaps the audience was laugh-hungry, per
haps it was the beautiful women in "war-ra
tioned" costumes, or the cigar-smokin' mama
with a literary yen for John Harvard—whatever
it was, the Gaieties were a success in general
and a lot of fun in particular.
However, if the G.I. touch can do as much
for successive productions as it did for the
45th annual Gaieties staged Friday and Satur
day, Ram's Head had better put some of the
boys under contract right now.
Praise must have reservation though, and
technically the Gaieties did not match the pace
set by individual performances. The running
gags were used rather too obviously to string
the acts together and became tiresome. The
lighting was mediocre when there was light,
sets were built under war-time restrictions of
course, and mechanically the whole show
jerked along like the Stanford bus.
But balance the obvious faults against the
effort involved, the vigor, youthfulness and
originality of the script and music, and even
the critics are stilled. It will be hard to forget
the music of Blossom Parke and Claude Wilson,
the arrangements by Charles Reeder, the bar
relhouse vocals of Nan Tillson, the superb
dancing and singing of Janice Shaughnessy,
and the humorous direction of Jean Levinson.
From the audience viewpoint the following
were highlights: (1) "Every Night Is Ladies'

Night at Belt's," sung by Nan Tillson, Doug
Hastings, Gordy Jacobs, Dick Driscoll, and Don
Landale. Tillson was at her best.
(2) "It Ain't the Same Old Farm," danced
and sung by those two farmers, Dick Driscoll
and Doug Hastings.
(3) "Stax, Crax, and Cold Hard Fax." Don
Shannon and Mary Lou Patton discussed ideal
love in the Stanford Library, dished out John
Harvard, Mission Street, and a set of twins.
(4) "Swoon You Goon." Sinatra got it again,
aped by Jack Lawson beautifully with all the
little goons swooning in a most convincing
manner.
From the critic's viewpoint:
(1) "Love Plays the Strangest Games," writ
ten and sung by Blossom Parke.
(2) Jean Levinson as Carmen somebody or
other and a fine tag line, "bird!"
(3) Janice Shaughnessy, singing and dancing j
in "Jericho," dancing in the boogie-woogie se
quence. In the "Jericho" number there were
some figures hopping around on a wall in the
background but it was so dark no one could
tell what they were doing. Everyone was
watching Shaughnessy anyway. The chore
ography of the boogie-woogie scene was remi
niscent of the Ballet Theater productions in :
Hollywood last summer.
(4) The orchestra and Bill Bird's saxophone.
How the string section got into the band should
remain a mystery and the performers anony-'
mo us.
The spirit of the '43 Gaieties can never be
captured in print; it can only be recalled. |

luted, turned handsprings, laughed and cried—
to give the impression that deep down under
its khaki coating, it's still the same old Farm.
Perhaps the audience was laugh-hungry, per
haps it was the beautiful women in "war-ra
tioned" costumes, or the cigar-smokin' mama
with a literary yen for John Harvard—whatever
it was, the Gaieties were a success in general
and a lot of fun in particular.
However, if the G.I. touch can do as much
for successive productions as it did for the
45th annual Gaieties staged Friday and Satur
day, Ram's Head had better put some of the
boys under contract right now.
Praise must have reservation though, and
technically the Gaieties did not match the pace
set by individual performances. The running
gags were used rather too obviously to string
the acts together and became tiresome. The
lighting was mediocre when there was light,
sets were built under war-time restrictions of
course, and mechanically the whole show
jerked along like the Stanford bus.
But balance the obvious faults against the
effort involved, the vigor, youthfulness and
originality of the script and music, and even
the critics are stilled. It will be hard to forget
the music of Blossom Parke and Claude Wilson,
the arrangements by Charles Reeder, the bar
relhouse vocals of Nan Tillson, the superb
dancing and singing of Janice Shaughnessy,
and the humorous direction of Jean Levinson.
From the audience viewpoint the following
were highlights: (1) "Every Night Is Ladies'

Night at Belt's," sung by Nan Tillson, Doug
Hastings, Gordy Jacobs, Dick Driscoll, and Don
Landale. Tillson was at her best.
(2) "It Ain't the Same Old Farm," danced
and sung by those two farmers, Dick Driscoll
and Doug Hastings.
(3) "Stax, Crax, and Cold Hard Fax." Don
Shannon and Mary Lou Patton discussed ideal
love in the Stanford Library, dished out John
Harvard, Mission Street, and a set of twins.
(4) "Swoon You Goon." Sinatra got it again,
aped by Jack Lawson beautifully with all the
little goons swooning in a most convincing
manner.
From the critic's viewpoint:
(1) "Love Plays the Strangest Games," writ
ten and sung by Blossom Parke.
(2) Jean Levinson as Carmen somebody or
other and a fine tag line, "bird!"
(3) Janice Shaughnessy, singing and dancing j
in "Jericho," dancing in the boogie-woogie se
quence. In the "Jericho" number there were
some figures hopping around on a wall in the
background but it was so dark no one could
tell what they were doing. Everyone was
watching Shaughnessy anyway. The chore
ography of the boogie-woogie scene was remi
niscent of the Ballet Theater productions in :
Hollywood last summer.
(4) The orchestra and Bill Bird's saxophone.
How the string section got into the band should
remain a mystery and the performers anony-'
mo us.
The spirit of the '43 Gaieties can never be
captured in print; it can only be recalled. |
Hubba hubba!
The Gaieties of 1943 jumped, bounced, sa
luted, turned handsprings, laughed and cried—
to give the impression that deep down under
its khaki coating, it's still the same old Farm.
