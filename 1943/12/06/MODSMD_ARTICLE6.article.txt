### United Press 
ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS. — The Allied Fifth Army has cracked the
strongest German* position guarding Rome, it was announced officially
tonight as American troops drove down mountain slopes toward the broad
valley leading to the eternal city, fighting forward with grenades and
knives savage German resistance.

Going over the top on 3,000-foot
Mount Camino, the Americans had
seized most of the lesser ridge of
Mount Maggiore for a total gain of
nearly four miles in 50 hours while
British troops storming across the
sprawling western slopes of Mount
Camino reached the Liri River val
ley.
Both Fifth Army spearheads thus
had cut through the rocky core of
the Germans' winterline, already
lopped off at the Adriatic end by the
British Eighth Army and threatened
with disintegration as the Allied
Armies hammered forward.
The Fifth Army's advances were
along a 15-mile front in western Italy
where at any point Clark's forces
were expected to break through mo
mentarily onto the plain around
Cassino, only 70 miles down the
Sacco valley from Rome itself.
