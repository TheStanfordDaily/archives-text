### 
Close association with all phases
of the armed forces and educational
institutions keynotes the career of
Col. John R. Eden, present com
mandant of all Army personnel at
Stanford University.
A glance in the Army Register
reveals the following:
"Eden, John R.. born 1886 111.;
grad. Inf. School, co. officers' course;
A.B. De Pauw University 1910; 2nd
Lt. Inf. Res. 1917; Ist Lt. Nov. 1917;
Capt. 1918; Major 1919; Capt. Reg.
Army 1920; Maj. 1935; Lt. Col. 1939;

Croix de Guerre
This brief account fails to mention
the Croix de Guerre which the Col
onel received during the first World
War, when he was in the Meuse-
Argonne sector in a division bri
gaded with French forces.
Then followed service in Puerto
Rico and Hawaii, ;ind his term as
public relations and plans and train
ing officer at Fort Benning, Georgia,
and as the commandant of Fort Mc-
Pherson's industion and reception
reception center.
R.O.T.C. Head
Furthermore there is no mention
of the Colonel's experience in edu
cational institutions. This included
four years with the R.O.T.C. at Cor
nell University, six years with the
R.O.T.C. at North Carolina State
College, and experience as head of
the R.O.T.C. at the University of
Washington, which had four major
branches of the R.O.T.C. and was
the largest unit on the West Coast.
As a result of the Colonel's asso
ciation with the military at educa
tional institutions, he has been put
in charge of the largest AST unit
in the country, although Colonel
Eden himself would prefer active
overseas combat duty.
Three Ribbons
Along with his duties as head of
the ASTU 3905 at Stanford, the
Colonel is commandant for the of
ficers of the Civil Affairs Training
School, the WACs (Physical Ther
apy School), the SCU 3944 (R. 0.-
T.C.), and ASTU 3931 (Medical
School).
In appearance, the Colonel is not
a tall man but makes an impressive
figure. His neat dress is enhanced
by his infantry insignia and three
ribbons: the Victory Ribbon with
two battle clasps from World War
I.the Defense Ribbon, and the cov

eted Croix de Guerre.
A strict disciplinarian, he has the
interest of his men at heart, and is
popular with the officers under his
command. For the past twenty-five
years, the Colonel's hobby has been
the Army.
"Individual Character"
Mrs. Eden, who is also at Stan
ford, was graduated from DePauw
University in Colonel Eden's class.
The Colonel's daughter was a junior
at the same university when she
married Lt. Col. Barry D. Browne
of the Field Artillery and the Ar
mored Command.
In commenting on the trainees at
Stanford, the Colonel states, "The
trainee should think about persona!
integrity. Tlte stress of the present
program and the vicissitudes of the
course should not overshadow the
importance of individual character
and personal integrity.
