by the "Y," will present a talk by
Mrs. Helene Heymans, who is an
instructor in Dutch for the ASTP
units, this Friday evening from 7:15
to 8:30 at the home of "Y" Secretary

Mrs. Heymans will compare the
attitudes of the American women
and women on European fronts,
particularly in occupied Holland.
Her experiences in dealing with
women who have been forced to
take responsibilities in this war in
Holland and France enable her to
evaluate the attitudes and contri
butions of American women,
Women in the World, a newly or

endeavoring to present to the wom

the more important aspects of the
problems which they will be called
upon to solve.
In an effort to make women here
realize the actual and pressing real
ity of these world issues in their
day-by-day lives, the Women in
the World will follow this Friday's
meeting with a panel discussion at
which members will outline some
basic aspects of these problems.
