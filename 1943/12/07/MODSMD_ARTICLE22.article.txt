As the first German language
group in the country to be graduated,
Company G's 6-L students are
rounding the last bend of their nine
month course and are hitting the
home stretch in fine style.
Some time next month, Stanford's j
academic heads will decide whether '
these students are thoroughly ac- '
quainted with German and are ready
to help plant the Allied victory gar
den on the Wilhelmstrasse.
During this term, 6-L students
have studied German philosophy,
economics, education, and culture,
paying some attention to such sub
jects as social conventions, hotel
conditions, and German food.
