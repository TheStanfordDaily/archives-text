## War Board Expands As More Committees Added 
### Joan Hodgdon 
Most students at Stanford have hoard of the War
Board and its various committees. But few know what
this largo organization does or how and why these com
mittees have come into existence. Some students also
question the results of the War Board work.

The Stanford War Board began
officially March 3, 1942 when Excom
approved Bob Collins' plans and
made him coordinator. The first di
visions of the board were salvage,
USO, and defense bonds and stamps.
To these were added, at the end of
Winter Quarter, 1942, a consumer
committee to help adjust student ci
vilian living to the new military
needs, and a campus branch of the
Palo Alto Red Cross.
Summer Labor Unit
Throughout Spring Quarter the
work began to show results. The sale
of bonds and stamps went higher and
higher, scrap was collected in larger
and larger quantities, and more on
campus dances and social events
were held.
This same work continued Sum
mer Quarter and a labor unit was
established to send students into
the fields and factories around the
University. Campaigns were also
conducted to save food and to keep
students from using their cars as
much as they had in the past.
Fall Quarter, Rosemary Cross be
came coordinator and the War Board
expanded into larger fields with
greater contributions from more stu
dents. The blood bank and the sur
gical dressing room were established
under the Red Cross. Stanford men
and women worked in the beet,
tomato, and walnut fields.
Betty May Hale Takes Over
War bonds and stamps were sold
at booths, located in various places
on campus and in residences, once a
week. Girls were sent to the Palo
Alto Hospitality House to entertain
servicemen, several tons of heavy
metals were salvaged, and sweeping
changes were made in Excom's social
policy.
Winter Quarter, 1943. the anni
versary of the War Board was
celebrated. One year of work had
been completed and the entire
University was organized in a co
ordinated effort to contribute to
ward victory.
Betty May Hale became coordi
nator Spring Quarter, 1943, and has
headed the War Board the last three
quarters. In Spring the Army began
to arrive on campus and the USO
committee of the SWB was faced
with the problem of entertaining
these men.
A social coordinator was ap
l>ointed who adopted the policy of
including the soldiers at Stanford
