# Hale, Cross Direct SWB
## 
### 
Rosemary Cross and Betty May
Hale followed Bob Collins as co
ordinators of the War Board. Miss
Cross held the position Fall Quarter,
1942, and Winter Quarter, 1943, and
Miss Hale Spring, Summer, and Fall
quarters of this year.
Miss Cross worked with Bob Col
lins as the chairman of the Public-
Relations Committee.
There are three things, according
to Miss Cross, that make the War
Board different: one, that it has no
precedents and thus the ability to
expand in any direction; two, this is
emergency work and time is an ele
ment that must be considered; three,
this work is bigger than the campus
since it is a part of the national war
effort.
Miss Hale, former vice-president
of the Y, worked for the War Board
under Miss Cross. She believes that
work on the War Board gives a per
son a greater responsibility and more
interest in the world at war.
She feels that the understanding
and cooperation of the students is
needed for the ultimate success of
the War Board work. Her main
policy has been to get as much work
done as she can and as well as she
can.
