# Bob Collins Begins SWB While Reading Shakespeare
## 
### Joan Hodgdon 
Bob Collins was just another Stanford student when
the war started two years ayo. But he had a good, idea
and the energy to develop this idea.
He saw that Stanford, for a university of its size and
quality, was doing little to help the war effort. A

Civilian Defense Council had been
set up at the end of 1941 when the
first alarming blackouts interrupted
study for finals. A student had
taken over the job of advising Stan
ford men which reserve branch of
the armed forces they could get into.
Excom, representing Farm students,
had begun a new social policy to
bring campus social life closer to
home.
But Collins saw that materially
much more could be done on campus
to contribute to the war effort. Even
more important, he saw that the atti
tude of many Stanford students—a
cynical attitude—must be changed
so these students might be better
prepared for the sacrifices demanded
by war.
Studying Shakespeare
One night in March 1942 as he was
studying his Shakespeare, Bob Col
lins began jotting down ideas. Why
not put Stanford's war effort under
one man? Why not save used razor
blades, magazines, and papers, and
toothpaste and shaving cream con
tainers?
Why not make personal invita
tions to soldiers to attend campus
programs? Why not devise new
and better ways to sell defense
stamps and bonds? And why not
change the attitude of the Stanford
student toward the war?
Two nights later he took his plans
to Excom. These plans called for a
coordinator of Stanford war activities
and three main divisions of work,
the USO, salvage, and defense bonds
and stamps.
Excom Approves
Excom enthusiastically approved
Collins' plans and unanimously ap
pointed him coordinator. He hadn't
expected to be given the job, but he
took it and began to organize his
committee.
He believed that the work must
go slowly and the activities be
planned so (hat all efforts would he
focused in proper directions with
out overlapping, new ideas would
he put into practice, and the stu
dents' time would not he wasted in
unnecessary work.
He said. "This whole job is a
massive undertaking and must be
done with full realization of its im
portance."
"No Glory"
When he called for volunteers he
emphasized the fact that there would
be no glory or publicity in the job.
The War Board was to be a com
mittee separate from the political
activities on campus but working
in coordination with them.
He said. "Political people and
activity people will he the main
stay of the movement hut they
cannot hinder it; rather they must
carry it to the every-day student
who will he the real force of the
movement."
He believed that it doesn't matter
who does the work or how it's done
as long as it is done with the least
amount of confusion. The War Board
itself is only as important as each
student's individual contribution and
cooperation.
Leaves for Army
Bob Collins continued as coordi
nator Spring and Summer quarters,
1942, and by fall the SWB had be
come established as a Stanford or
ganization. But early in October the
founder left the Farm to join the
Army.
It is upon his original plans that
all the activities and policies of the
SWB are now based. It was because
of his efforts in organizing one of the
first college war boards that Stanford
has been able to contribute a little
toward winning the war.

had begun a new social policy to
bring campus social life closer to
home.
But Collins saw that materially
much more could be done on campus
to contribute to the war effort. Even
more important, he saw that the atti
tude of many Stanford students—a
cynical attitude—must be changed
so these students might be better
prepared for the sacrifices demanded
by war.
Studying Shakespeare
One night in March 1942 as he was
studying his Shakespeare, Bob Col
lins began jotting down ideas. Why
not put Stanford's war effort under
one man? Why not save used razor
blades, magazines, and papers, and
toothpaste and shaving cream con
tainers?
Why not make personal invita
tions to soldiers to attend campus
programs? Why not devise new
and better ways to sell defense
stamps and bonds? And why not
change the attitude of the Stanford
student toward the war?
Two nights later he took his plans
to Excom. These plans called for a
coordinator of Stanford war activities
and three main divisions of work,
the USO, salvage, and defense bonds
and stamps.
Excom Approves
Excom enthusiastically approved
Collins' plans and unanimously ap
pointed him coordinator. He hadn't
expected to be given the job, but he
took it and began to organize his
committee.
He believed that the work must
go slowly and the activities be
planned so (hat all efforts would he
focused in proper directions with
out overlapping, new ideas would
he put into practice, and the stu
dents' time would not he wasted in
unnecessary work.
He said. "This whole job is a
massive undertaking and must be
done with full realization of its im
portance."
"No Glory"
When he called for volunteers he
emphasized the fact that there would
be no glory or publicity in the job.
The War Board was to be a com
mittee separate from the political
activities on campus but working
in coordination with them.
He said. "Political people and
activity people will he the main
stay of the movement hut they
cannot hinder it; rather they must
carry it to the every-day student
who will he the real force of the
movement."
He believed that it doesn't matter
who does the work or how it's done
as long as it is done with the least
amount of confusion. The War Board
itself is only as important as each
student's individual contribution and
cooperation.
Leaves for Army
Bob Collins continued as coordi
nator Spring and Summer quarters,
1942, and by fall the SWB had be
come established as a Stanford or
ganization. But early in October the
founder left the Farm to join the
Army.
It is upon his original plans that
all the activities and policies of the
SWB are now based. It was because
of his efforts in organizing one of the
first college war boards that Stanford
has been able to contribute a little
toward winning the war.
Bob Collins was just another Stanford student when
the war started two years ayo. But he had a good, idea
and the energy to develop this idea.
He saw that Stanford, for a university of its size and
quality, was doing little to help the war effort. A

Civilian Defense Council had been
set up at the end of 1941 when the
first alarming blackouts interrupted
study for finals. A student had
taken over the job of advising Stan
ford men which reserve branch of
the armed forces they could get into.
Excom, representing Farm students,
had begun a new social policy to
bring campus social life closer to
home.
But Collins saw that materially
