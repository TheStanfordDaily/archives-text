# War Changes
## Stanford Life 
### 
TODAY'S edition of The Daily is primarily devoted to a review
of Stanford's effort during two years of war. It may seem
redundant and even wasteful to put out such a review, for it
did take time, work, and thought to prpeare.
But we feel that this is an appropriate time to pause and
take stock of what we have done since that Sunday morning of
the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the only students who knew
what was going on were those writing a paper on the Japanese
government (and some of those had already turned in papers
predicting peace).
The war has changed Stanford. Actually, the change
doesn't date from just December 7; it began the year before,
when U.S. ships were sinking Nazi submarines in the At
lantic and the draft began.
Stanford was known as a country club in those days. Fifteen
units was normal, and students only took seventeen units Win
ter Quarter so that they could take thirteen Spring Quarter.
Stanford has changed, and we, the seniors, have seen it
change.
When we were freshmen, we saw the "good old days." That
was the year that the football team went from rags to riches
to play in the Rose Bowl. That was also the year of the draft.
When we were sophomores, war came. Civilian defense
began and we had blackouts during finals. The war board was
begun and enough stamps were sold to buy three "Victor E.
Peeps." But the war hadn't really begun to affect Stanford.
When we were juniors, Stanford men left in the E.R.C., the
Marine and Navy reserves. The soldiers came. The war board
really got under way—and students began to study more.
We are now seniors. There won't really be a Class of '44
graduating in June. The men have left for the armed forces.
