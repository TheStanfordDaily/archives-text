# War Changes
## Stanford Life 
### 
TODAY'S edition of The Daily is primarily devoted to a review
of Stanford's effort during two years of war. It may seem
redundant and even wasteful to put out such a review, for it
did take time, work, and thought to prpeare.
But we feel that this is an appropriate time to pause and
take stock of what we have done since that Sunday morning of
the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the only students who knew
what was going on were those writing a paper on the Japanese
government (and some of those had already turned in papers
predicting peace).
The war has changed Stanford. Actually, the change
doesn't date from just December 7; it began the year before,
when U.S. ships were sinking Nazi submarines in the At
lantic and the draft began.
Stanford was known as a country club in those days. Fifteen
units was normal, and students only took seventeen units Win
ter Quarter so that they could take thirteen Spring Quarter.
Stanford has changed, and we, the seniors, have seen it
change.
When we were freshmen, we saw the "good old days." That
was the year that the football team went from rags to riches
to play in the Rose Bowl. That was also the year of the draft.
When we were sophomores, war came. Civilian defense
began and we had blackouts during finals. The war board was
begun and enough stamps were sold to buy three "Victor E.
Peeps." But the war hadn't really begun to affect Stanford.
When we were juniors, Stanford men left in the E.R.C., the
Marine and Navy reserves. The soldiers came. The war board
really got under way—and students began to study more.
We are now seniors. There won't really be a Class of '44
graduating in June. The men have left for the armed forces.
he women will graduate in December, in March, and in July,
md the Class of '45 will be graduating in July and in September.
Stanford has changed. The "good old days" have passed.
The question now is whether Stanford has changed enough.
It is good to look back at the past tor it helps us to under
stand the present. But it is better to look forward, for it
helps us to form the future.
There were many things about the past which were not good,
here will be many things about the future which will be that
•ay. We can only hope that the classes who follow us will
etain those things which seemed good to us, and that they
/ill add their share to Stanford in their time here.
We have found many things good at Stanford, the Honor
!ode, the Fundamental Standard, the informality and the friend
ness. These things have typified Stanford to us and we hope
hey remain.
After the war there will be agitation to bring back the
"Good Old Days" in their entirety. We hope that the stu
dents who are here then will have wisdom to realize that
everything was not ipso facto good because it existed then.
Many things were not. But by that time we will be alumni
and though we will follow the course Stanford takes, it will
not be for us to decide.
But that is rather far in the future. More immediate is the
ontinued conversion of Stanford to a wartime basis. There are
nany problems that are yet undecided, many of which concern
he soldiers. But you probably know as much about these as
ve do. They are going to be your babies to suffer with and
o solve.
All we can do for you is to wish you goodbye and good luck,

When we were juniors, Stanford men left in the E.R.C., the
Marine and Navy reserves. The soldiers came. The war board
really got under way—and students began to study more.
We are now seniors. There won't really be a Class of '44
graduating in June. The men have left for the armed forces.
he women will graduate in December, in March, and in July,
md the Class of '45 will be graduating in July and in September.
Stanford has changed. The "good old days" have passed.
The question now is whether Stanford has changed enough.
It is good to look back at the past tor it helps us to under
stand the present. But it is better to look forward, for it
helps us to form the future.
There were many things about the past which were not good,
here will be many things about the future which will be that
•ay. We can only hope that the classes who follow us will
etain those things which seemed good to us, and that they
/ill add their share to Stanford in their time here.
We have found many things good at Stanford, the Honor
!ode, the Fundamental Standard, the informality and the friend
ness. These things have typified Stanford to us and we hope
hey remain.
After the war there will be agitation to bring back the
"Good Old Days" in their entirety. We hope that the stu
dents who are here then will have wisdom to realize that
everything was not ipso facto good because it existed then.
Many things were not. But by that time we will be alumni
and though we will follow the course Stanford takes, it will
not be for us to decide.
But that is rather far in the future. More immediate is the
ontinued conversion of Stanford to a wartime basis. There are
nany problems that are yet undecided, many of which concern
he soldiers. But you probably know as much about these as
ve do. They are going to be your babies to suffer with and
o solve.

TODAY'S edition of The Daily is primarily devoted to a review
of Stanford's effort during two years of war. It may seem
redundant and even wasteful to put out such a review, for it
did take time, work, and thought to prpeare.
But we feel that this is an appropriate time to pause and
take stock of what we have done since that Sunday morning of
the attack on Pearl Harbor, when the only students who knew
what was going on were those writing a paper on the Japanese
government (and some of those had already turned in papers
predicting peace).
The war has changed Stanford. Actually, the change
doesn't date from just December 7; it began the year before,
when U.S. ships were sinking Nazi submarines in the At
lantic and the draft began.
Stanford was known as a country club in those days. Fifteen
units was normal, and students only took seventeen units Win
ter Quarter so that they could take thirteen Spring Quarter.
Stanford has changed, and we, the seniors, have seen it
change.
When we were freshmen, we saw the "good old days." That
was the year that the football team went from rags to riches
to play in the Rose Bowl. That was also the year of the draft.
When we were sophomores, war came. Civilian defense
began and we had blackouts during finals. The war board was
begun and enough stamps were sold to buy three "Victor E.
Peeps." But the war hadn't really begun to affect Stanford.
