# Disaster Drills Aided by OCD
## 
### 
Today, two years after the Pearl
Harbor attack, one may look back in
some amusement at (he confusion of
the first frantic efforts at civilian de
fense in the frightening early days of
the war. And. on the Stanford cam
pus, this confusion reigned supreme.
Hitting the Farm in the midst of
Autumn Quarter finals, the first
nerve-wracking blackouts brought
into action the Stanford Civilian De
fense Committee, headed by co
chairmen Frank Walker and Pro
fessor Edgar Robinson.
And on the night of Dec. 10, 1941,
began a series of practice blackouts
to prepare the students for possible
disaster. Various living groups were
"blown up,'' and into action went the
sturdy first-aiders and staunch fire
fighters to do their duty for Stanford
and for country.
Air-Raid System
Slowly, order began to replace
chaos, as the campus was systemati
cally divided into 26 air-raid sectors,
each with a warden and staff. Class
rooms and laboratories were closed
after 6 p.m. The power-house siren
was replaced by a more effective sys
tem on top of the Hoover War Li
brary.
The Corporation Yard became
civilian defense control center for
the campus, with a direct wire
front the Fourth Interceptor Com
mand.
With the appearance of soldiers on
campus, the system was enlarged and
in case of emergency, the soldiers re
port to their headquarters and re
ceive assignments or further instruc
tions.
Army Personnel Pool
The "pool" of personnel, set up by
Major Snyder at the request of Col
onel Eden, is prepared to fill such
positions as auxiliary police, messen
gers, air-raid wardens, or drivers for
auxiliary fire fighting equipment.
The lifting of dim-out restric
tions has tended to cause some re
laxing in the defense system, hut
in case of an actual blackout the
old rules and regulations applying
to civilians are in force.
Sponsored by the War Board were
War Stamp sales and instructive mo
tion pictures. Red Cross classes were
begun in First Aid, Nutrition,
rses' Aide, and Motor Corps.
