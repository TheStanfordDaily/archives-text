"It Ain't the Same Old Farm"
sang Driscoll and Doug Hastings in
the G.I. Gaieties.
That's light, it ain't the saiT| \
Gone are the days when Stanford
was the sophisticated country club
. . . when men were roughs by day
and smoothies by night . . . when
Stanford women were never seen
bare-legged on campus.
The Clothing, the Bonds—
In 1940-41 the rough went to
classes and to his ten o'clock in the
Cellar in levis, cashmere sweaters,
and dirty saddle shoes. The co-eds
wore silk stockings at all times,
never bobbie socks.
In 1939 when 10 per cent of al
lowances was not invested in war
bonds and rationing was unheard
of, 17.9 per cent of the women
registered at Stanford informed
The Daily:
"The average sorority woman
spends Si 10.50 for clothes per
quarter and the average hall
woman spends $55.3 ft."
The creations they bought in San
Francisco made their debuts at
proms with big-name dance orches
tras—Kay Kyser, Glenn Gray, Duke
Ellington, Skinnay Ennis. Now the
familiar strains of these orchestras
are heard at dances through me
courtesy of juke boxes.
The Cars, the 2:isft's—
In 1940-41 when the Wow Boys
were in their heyday, one out of
three Farm students owned cars;
convertibles were predominantly the
mode of transportation which took
the rough and his queen to the City
on Saturday night for that big date
. . . to beach parties at Half Moon
Bay ... to Rio Del Mar for Daily
banquets ... to Cal and Kezar for
football games
Gasoline shortages hit the Farm;
automobiles went into hiberna
tion and bicycles appeared and
students and professors alike ca
reen wildly around the Quad.
Bike-riders learned how to make
it from Palo Alto to the P.O. in
12 minutes.
When the Stanford woman
signed out for her inevitable Sat
urday night date in the City, she
wrote in the "Time Signed Out For'
lank two-thirty. She was smiling
nd confident no slow trains or
vercrowded buses would cause her
lock-out. No, she did not have
t<iyorry about such things. Neither
id she have to put an address "in
<se of blackout" on her sign-out
ip. She also had mid-week twelve
clocks if she was an Upper Divi
on student.
lie Football Season—
Football season —it just ain't now
-was a series of hilarious Friday
ight rallies and Saturday after
oon games. Southern Pacific char
red an entire rooters' • train to
ansport the Indians to Southern
California . . . coaches on the Day
ght werer eserved for Stanford
udents only.
Big Game Week brought the
Big Game parade and all its floats
. . . the bonfire in Lake Lagunita
(remember it's dry in autumn), Big
Game Gaieties, Indian raid parties
to paint the big Cal "C" red. and
then Big Game Night. The co-ed
got a three-thirty late leave; the
Stanford men asked for dates as
early as Fall Quarter registration.
Reservations were made for Del
.Monte a month in advance. It was
a week's vacation in the middle of
Ib«* quarter ... it was the coun
try club at its height.
In rooting sections, card stunts
'lanned by Rally Committee, those
el las and gals who ushered you
round the Cal stadium at the Cal-
J.C.L.A. game, were the delight of
lalf-time. After the stunts were
ver, the cards flew through the air
n small pieces.
Christmas vacation meant ski
ing at Voscmite and Sun Valley
. . . Sun Valley, now a convales
cent resort for service men. Win
ter Quarter meant fraternity for
mals at country clubs . . . basket
hall games and a national cham
pionship team.
Spring Quarter when seniors who
ook more than 13 units were over
vorking themselves brought the Phi
Cap-A.T.O. train dance, the Beta
)elt. boat dance, the Fiji Island
lance, the Sigma Nu baby party.
Back to the Farm"
"Back to the Farm Day" meant
innumerable duckings in the foun
tain in front of the libe for anyone
who dared walk down Quad out of
costume. The barbecue meant
"Shorty" Grannis would imitate
Roosevelt and Brownlee Corrin
would give a "baby killing."
Spring Quarter today is a time
for crop picking, bike rides over
the hills in hack of campus, swim
ming parties at the Women's Gym,
tennis games in the early twilight,
informal get-togethers on Sunday
afternoons.
Summer Quarter, which had a
registration of 753 students in 1040,
had a registration of 1,618 in 1943,
It was the time for seniors to get
extra units in order that they could
relax their last three quarters. This
year seniors went to summer school
to graduate early, to enable them
to take their part in the war effort
earlier.
There've Been Some Changes
Since Pearl Harbor the Stanford
.social and scholastic life has changed
radically. Today informality and
hard work form the pattern of the
Stanford civilian and soldier stu
dents. Gone is the country club.
One - thirties have eliminated
Big Dates in the City . . . they are
now a collector's item. The Con
cert Series, the student dramatic
productions, and the Tuesday
Evening Series have increased in
popularity. Sunday evening mov
ies, Hall and Row informal dances,
Canteen dates, open houses, and
movies in Paly are 1943's substi
tutes.
Today students apply their skill
to cleaning roms and keeping their
living group in good condition. Dust
no longer piles up until cleaning
day when a University employee
would restore order.
More Units
Marching in with the soldiers
were such classes as physical ther
apy which make Stanford one of the
eight colleges and universities in
the United States to offer such
training.
"Before the war," Miss Doyle said,
"a course of 15 units was considered
plenty hard' by the average stu
dent. Now 20-unit courses are com
mon among the women students; in
fact, in the 1943 Spring Quarter a
girl completed 30 units."

More Units
Marching in with the soldiers
were such classes as physical ther
apy which make Stanford one of the
eight colleges and universities in
the United States to offer such
training.
"Before the war," Miss Doyle said,
"a course of 15 units was considered
plenty hard' by the average stu
dent. Now 20-unit courses are com
mon among the women students; in
fact, in the 1943 Spring Quarter a
girl completed 30 units."

Gone are the days when Stanford
was the sophisticated country club
. . . when men were roughs by day
and smoothies by night . . . when
Stanford women were never seen
bare-legged on campus.
The Clothing, the Bonds—
In 1940-41 the rough went to
classes and to his ten o'clock in the
Cellar in levis, cashmere sweaters,
and dirty saddle shoes. The co-eds
wore silk stockings at all times,
never bobbie socks.
In 1939 when 10 per cent of al
lowances was not invested in war
bonds and rationing was unheard
of, 17.9 per cent of the women
registered at Stanford informed
The Daily:
"The average sorority woman
spends Si 10.50 for clothes per
quarter and the average hall
woman spends $55.3 ft."
The creations they bought in San
Francisco made their debuts at
proms with big-name dance orches
tras—Kay Kyser, Glenn Gray, Duke
Ellington, Skinnay Ennis. Now the
familiar strains of these orchestras
are heard at dances through me
courtesy of juke boxes.
The Cars, the 2:isft's—
In 1940-41 when the Wow Boys
were in their heyday, one out of
three Farm students owned cars;
convertibles were predominantly the
mode of transportation which took
the rough and his queen to the City
on Saturday night for that big date
. . . to beach parties at Half Moon
Bay ... to Rio Del Mar for Daily
banquets ... to Cal and Kezar for
football games
Gasoline shortages hit the Farm;
automobiles went into hiberna
tion and bicycles appeared and
students and professors alike ca
reen wildly around the Quad.
Bike-riders learned how to make
it from Palo Alto to the P.O. in
12 minutes.
When the Stanford woman
signed out for her inevitable Sat
urday night date in the City, she
wrote in the "Time Signed Out For'
lank two-thirty. She was smiling
nd confident no slow trains or
vercrowded buses would cause her
lock-out. No, she did not have
t<iyorry about such things. Neither
id she have to put an address "in
<se of blackout" on her sign-out
ip. She also had mid-week twelve
clocks if she was an Upper Divi
on student.
lie Football Season—
Football season —it just ain't now
-was a series of hilarious Friday
ight rallies and Saturday after
oon games. Southern Pacific char
red an entire rooters' • train to
ansport the Indians to Southern
California . . . coaches on the Day
ght werer eserved for Stanford
udents only.
Big Game Week brought the
Big Game parade and all its floats
. . . the bonfire in Lake Lagunita
(remember it's dry in autumn), Big
Game Gaieties, Indian raid parties
to paint the big Cal "C" red. and
then Big Game Night. The co-ed
got a three-thirty late leave; the
Stanford men asked for dates as
early as Fall Quarter registration.
Reservations were made for Del
.Monte a month in advance. It was
a week's vacation in the middle of
Ib«* quarter ... it was the coun
try club at its height.
In rooting sections, card stunts
'lanned by Rally Committee, those
el las and gals who ushered you
round the Cal stadium at the Cal-
J.C.L.A. game, were the delight of
lalf-time. After the stunts were
ver, the cards flew through the air
n small pieces.
Christmas vacation meant ski
ing at Voscmite and Sun Valley
. . . Sun Valley, now a convales
cent resort for service men. Win
ter Quarter meant fraternity for
mals at country clubs . . . basket
hall games and a national cham
pionship team.
Spring Quarter when seniors who
ook more than 13 units were over
vorking themselves brought the Phi
Cap-A.T.O. train dance, the Beta
)elt. boat dance, the Fiji Island
lance, the Sigma Nu baby party.
Back to the Farm"
"Back to the Farm Day" meant
innumerable duckings in the foun
tain in front of the libe for anyone
who dared walk down Quad out of
costume. The barbecue meant
"Shorty" Grannis would imitate
Roosevelt and Brownlee Corrin
would give a "baby killing."
Spring Quarter today is a time
for crop picking, bike rides over
the hills in hack of campus, swim
ming parties at the Women's Gym,
tennis games in the early twilight,
informal get-togethers on Sunday
afternoons.
Summer Quarter, which had a
registration of 753 students in 1040,
had a registration of 1,618 in 1943,
It was the time for seniors to get
extra units in order that they could
relax their last three quarters. This
year seniors went to summer school
to graduate early, to enable them
to take their part in the war effort
earlier.
There've Been Some Changes
Since Pearl Harbor the Stanford
.social and scholastic life has changed
radically. Today informality and
hard work form the pattern of the
Stanford civilian and soldier stu
dents. Gone is the country club.
One - thirties have eliminated

There've Been Some Changes
Since Pearl Harbor the Stanford
.social and scholastic life has changed
radically. Today informality and
hard work form the pattern of the
Stanford civilian and soldier stu
dents. Gone is the country club.
One - thirties have eliminated
Big Dates in the City . . . they are
now a collector's item. The Con
cert Series, the student dramatic
productions, and the Tuesday
Evening Series have increased in
popularity. Sunday evening mov
ies, Hall and Row informal dances,
Canteen dates, open houses, and
movies in Paly are 1943's substi
tutes.
Today students apply their skill
to cleaning roms and keeping their
living group in good condition. Dust
no longer piles up until cleaning
day when a University employee
would restore order.
More Units
Marching in with the soldiers
were such classes as physical ther
apy which make Stanford one of the
eight colleges and universities in
the United States to offer such
training.
"Before the war," Miss Doyle said,
"a course of 15 units was considered
plenty hard' by the average stu
dent. Now 20-unit courses are com
mon among the women students; in
fact, in the 1943 Spring Quarter a
girl completed 30 units."
"It Ain't the Same Old Farm"
sang Driscoll and Doug Hastings in
the G.I. Gaieties.

Gone are the days when Stanford
was the sophisticated country club
. . . when men were roughs by day
and smoothies by night . . . when
Stanford women were never seen
bare-legged on campus.
The Clothing, the Bonds—
In 1940-41 the rough went to
classes and to his ten o'clock in the
Cellar in levis, cashmere sweaters,
and dirty saddle shoes. The co-eds
wore silk stockings at all times,
never bobbie socks.
In 1939 when 10 per cent of al
lowances was not invested in war
bonds and rationing was unheard
of, 17.9 per cent of the women
registered at Stanford informed
The Daily:
"The average sorority woman
spends Si 10.50 for clothes per
quarter and the average hall
woman spends $55.3 ft."
The creations they bought in San
Francisco made their debuts at
proms with big-name dance orches
tras—Kay Kyser, Glenn Gray, Duke
Ellington, Skinnay Ennis. Now the
familiar strains of these orchestras
are heard at dances through me
courtesy of juke boxes.
The Cars, the 2:isft's—
In 1940-41 when the Wow Boys
were in their heyday, one out of
three Farm students owned cars;
convertibles were predominantly the
mode of transportation which took
the rough and his queen to the City
on Saturday night for that big date
. . . to beach parties at Half Moon
Bay ... to Rio Del Mar for Daily
banquets ... to Cal and Kezar for
football games
Gasoline shortages hit the Farm;
automobiles went into hiberna
tion and bicycles appeared and
students and professors alike ca
reen wildly around the Quad.
Bike-riders learned how to make
it from Palo Alto to the P.O. in
12 minutes.
When the Stanford woman
signed out for her inevitable Sat
urday night date in the City, she
wrote in the "Time Signed Out For'
lank two-thirty. She was smiling
nd confident no slow trains or
vercrowded buses would cause her
lock-out. No, she did not have
t<iyorry about such things. Neither
id she have to put an address "in
<se of blackout" on her sign-out
ip. She also had mid-week twelve
clocks if she was an Upper Divi
on student.
lie Football Season—
Football season —it just ain't now
-was a series of hilarious Friday
ight rallies and Saturday after
oon games. Southern Pacific char
red an entire rooters' • train to
ansport the Indians to Southern
California . . . coaches on the Day
ght werer eserved for Stanford
udents only.
Big Game Week brought the
Big Game parade and all its floats
. . . the bonfire in Lake Lagunita
(remember it's dry in autumn), Big
Game Gaieties, Indian raid parties
to paint the big Cal "C" red. and
then Big Game Night. The co-ed
got a three-thirty late leave; the
Stanford men asked for dates as
early as Fall Quarter registration.
Reservations were made for Del
.Monte a month in advance. It was
a week's vacation in the middle of
Ib«* quarter ... it was the coun
try club at its height.
In rooting sections, card stunts
'lanned by Rally Committee, those
el las and gals who ushered you
round the Cal stadium at the Cal-
J.C.L.A. game, were the delight of
lalf-time. After the stunts were
ver, the cards flew through the air
n small pieces.
Christmas vacation meant ski
ing at Voscmite and Sun Valley
. . . Sun Valley, now a convales
cent resort for service men. Win
ter Quarter meant fraternity for
mals at country clubs . . . basket
hall games and a national cham
pionship team.
Spring Quarter when seniors who
ook more than 13 units were over
vorking themselves brought the Phi
Cap-A.T.O. train dance, the Beta
)elt. boat dance, the Fiji Island
lance, the Sigma Nu baby party.
Back to the Farm"
"Back to the Farm Day" meant
innumerable duckings in the foun
tain in front of the libe for anyone
who dared walk down Quad out of
costume. The barbecue meant
"Shorty" Grannis would imitate
Roosevelt and Brownlee Corrin
would give a "baby killing."
Spring Quarter today is a time
for crop picking, bike rides over
the hills in hack of campus, swim
ming parties at the Women's Gym,
tennis games in the early twilight,
informal get-togethers on Sunday
afternoons.
Summer Quarter, which had a

signed out for her inevitable Sat
urday night date in the City, she
wrote in the "Time Signed Out For'
lank two-thirty. She was smiling
nd confident no slow trains or
vercrowded buses would cause her
lock-out. No, she did not have
t<iyorry about such things. Neither
id she have to put an address "in
<se of blackout" on her sign-out
ip. She also had mid-week twelve
clocks if she was an Upper Divi
on student.
lie Football Season—
Football season —it just ain't now
-was a series of hilarious Friday
ight rallies and Saturday after
oon games. Southern Pacific char
red an entire rooters' • train to
ansport the Indians to Southern
California . . . coaches on the Day
ght werer eserved for Stanford
udents only.
Big Game Week brought the
Big Game parade and all its floats
. . . the bonfire in Lake Lagunita
(remember it's dry in autumn), Big
Game Gaieties, Indian raid parties
to paint the big Cal "C" red. and
then Big Game Night. The co-ed
got a three-thirty late leave; the
Stanford men asked for dates as
early as Fall Quarter registration.
Reservations were made for Del
.Monte a month in advance. It was
a week's vacation in the middle of
Ib«* quarter ... it was the coun
try club at its height.
In rooting sections, card stunts
'lanned by Rally Committee, those
el las and gals who ushered you
round the Cal stadium at the Cal-
J.C.L.A. game, were the delight of
lalf-time. After the stunts were
ver, the cards flew through the air
n small pieces.
Christmas vacation meant ski
ing at Voscmite and Sun Valley
. . . Sun Valley, now a convales
cent resort for service men. Win
ter Quarter meant fraternity for
mals at country clubs . . . basket
hall games and a national cham
pionship team.
Spring Quarter when seniors who
ook more than 13 units were over
vorking themselves brought the Phi
Cap-A.T.O. train dance, the Beta
)elt. boat dance, the Fiji Island
lance, the Sigma Nu baby party.

Back to the Farm"
"Back to the Farm Day" meant
innumerable duckings in the foun
tain in front of the libe for anyone
who dared walk down Quad out of
costume. The barbecue meant
"Shorty" Grannis would imitate
Roosevelt and Brownlee Corrin
would give a "baby killing."
Spring Quarter today is a time
for crop picking, bike rides over
the hills in hack of campus, swim
ming parties at the Women's Gym,
tennis games in the early twilight,
informal get-togethers on Sunday
afternoons.
Summer Quarter, which had a
registration of 753 students in 1040,
had a registration of 1,618 in 1943,
It was the time for seniors to get
extra units in order that they could
relax their last three quarters. This
year seniors went to summer school
to graduate early, to enable them
to take their part in the war effort
earlier.
There've Been Some Changes
Since Pearl Harbor the Stanford
.social and scholastic life has changed
radically. Today informality and
hard work form the pattern of the
Stanford civilian and soldier stu
dents. Gone is the country club.
One - thirties have eliminated
Big Dates in the City . . . they are
now a collector's item. The Con
cert Series, the student dramatic
productions, and the Tuesday
Evening Series have increased in
popularity. Sunday evening mov
ies, Hall and Row informal dances,
Canteen dates, open houses, and
movies in Paly are 1943's substi
tutes.
Today students apply their skill
to cleaning roms and keeping their
living group in good condition. Dust
no longer piles up until cleaning
day when a University employee
would restore order.
More Units
Marching in with the soldiers
were such classes as physical ther
apy which make Stanford one of the
eight colleges and universities in
the United States to offer such
training.
"Before the war," Miss Doyle said,
"a course of 15 units was considered
plenty hard' by the average stu
dent. Now 20-unit courses are com
mon among the women students; in
fact, in the 1943 Spring Quarter a
girl completed 30 units."

Gone are the days when Stanford
was the sophisticated country club
. . . when men were roughs by day
and smoothies by night . . . when
Stanford women were never seen
bare-legged on campus.
The Clothing, the Bonds—
In 1940-41 the rough went to
classes and to his ten o'clock in the
Cellar in levis, cashmere sweaters,
and dirty saddle shoes. The co-eds
wore silk stockings at all times,
never bobbie socks.
In 1939 when 10 per cent of al
lowances was not invested in war
bonds and rationing was unheard
of, 17.9 per cent of the women
registered at Stanford informed
The Daily:
"The average sorority woman
spends Si 10.50 for clothes per
quarter and the average hall
woman spends $55.3 ft."
The creations they bought in San
Francisco made their debuts at
proms with big-name dance orches
tras—Kay Kyser, Glenn Gray, Duke
Ellington, Skinnay Ennis. Now the
familiar strains of these orchestras
are heard at dances through me
courtesy of juke boxes.
The Cars, the 2:isft's—
In 1940-41 when the Wow Boys
were in their heyday, one out of
three Farm students owned cars;
convertibles were predominantly the
mode of transportation which took
the rough and his queen to the City
on Saturday night for that big date
. . . to beach parties at Half Moon
Bay ... to Rio Del Mar for Daily
banquets ... to Cal and Kezar for
football games
Gasoline shortages hit the Farm;
automobiles went into hiberna
tion and bicycles appeared and
students and professors alike ca
reen wildly around the Quad.
Bike-riders learned how to make
it from Palo Alto to the P.O. in
12 minutes.
