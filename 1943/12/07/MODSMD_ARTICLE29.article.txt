The ESMWT program, or, in trans
lation, the Engineering, Science, and
Management War Training Program,
has been operating on the Stanford
campus for two years.
Sponsored and financed by the U.S.
Office of Education, it offers free,
short-term courses to train chemists,
physists, engineers, and production
supervisors.
Dr. Eugene L. Grant, professor of
engineering, is in charge of the
ESMWT program at Stanford.
Two Types of Courses
The program offers part-time and
full-time courses, the part-time
courses involving 6 to 12 hours work
a week, the full-time 45 to 60 hours
work per week. The part-time
courses serve as refresher or im
provement courses for those already
employed in war industry, while the
full-time courses train new students
for industrial jobs.
The Chemical Analyst Training
course, which will be offered again
in January, is an example of the
full-time course offered by ES
MWT. It involves eight hours of
work a day Monday to Friday
throughout the 12-week training
period.
Inaugurated by Dr. Robert Rowe,
assistant professor of chemistry, in
November 1942 in response to the
demand of a large West Coast indus
trial laboratory working on war sup
plies, its trainees proved so satisfac
tory that later graduates have been
in demand.
Tuition Free
Tuition is free but students must
buy their own texts, slide rules, and
lab aprons, an estimated cost of
about $20. Prerequisites include
high-school graduation with one
year of chemistry and two years of
mathematics or the equivalent.
Other full-time courses offered by
ESMWT are Engineering Drafting
and Technical Calculations under the
instruction of Professor Brainerd
Plehn, formerly of Bethlehem Ship
building Corporation, and Ferenc
Molnar, acting assistant professor of
mechanical engineering. A course in
Management Practices in War In
dustry is offered under the Graduate
School of Business.
