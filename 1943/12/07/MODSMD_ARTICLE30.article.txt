# Stanford Trains 3,000 Students for Army
## AST Program Sets Up Five Schools on Campus 
### 
The specialized training program was established
by the Army to give non-commissioned men college
training in specific fields.
The European area and language studies group is
the first such group to be established on the Pacific-
Coast and the second in the nation. Dr. Edwin A.

Cottrell, professor of political sci
ence, is director of the school.
The objective of the school is to
give Army trainees a knowledge
and understanding of the area. The
trainees are also schooled in mili
tary policy as it affects relations be
tween the United States and the
people of the area.
The soldier - students of these
units study the language of the
area, its national resources, and its
industrial facilities.
Psychology Units
The personnel psychology stu
dents were given two quarters of
advanced instruction as each mem
ber of the unit had college training
in psychology.
The curriculum was designed to
train the soldiers in techniques and
procedures used by the Army in the
selection, classification, and assign
ment of personnel and in the evalu
ation of training.
The school was under the direc
tion of Dr. Paul R. Farnsworth,
professor of psychology.
Advanced engineering trainees
are distributed among the chem
ical. civil, electrical, and mechani
cal engineering schools.
The purpose of the program, ac
cording to Dr. Samuel B. Morris,
dean of the School of Engineering
and director of the Army school, is
to supply engineers for all branches
of the Army.
The men in these units will be
here for three or four quarters, de
pending on the type of engineering
which they study.
Cadet System
The advanced training units are
organized and operated under the
"cadet system," under which the
soldier-students in turn fill the
company positions under the super
vision of regular officers.
Dr. Mitchell announced this sum
mer that soldiers would receive
transcripts of credit to apply toward
graduation on satisfactory comple
tion of their course.
The first military commencement
occurred this quarter when 30 mem
bers of the Civil Affairs Training
School were graduated. These men
were commissioned directly from
civilian life due to special ability
in certain fields and were trained to
use these abilities in foreign areas
as part of an army of occupation.
As other groups of students finish
their courses, they also will be sent
to active duty.
