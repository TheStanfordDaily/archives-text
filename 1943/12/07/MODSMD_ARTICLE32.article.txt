## 
### Esther Belew 
The members of the Army Specialized Training'
Units are familiar figures on the campus now, but a
year ago the scene was a little different.
On Friday, Dec. 11, 1942. The Daily appeared with
the headline "Navy Occupies Branner" and announced

that "The full effect of the war effort,
will be felt by Stanford men next
quarter when they will double up to
make room for the first contingent
of 200 cadets, part of the Naval
Flight Preparatory School being es
tablished here, who will move into
Branner Hall Jan. 7."
The reported occupation did not
occur, however, as the Navy decided
to establish the school at St, Mary's.
The hall men continued in Bran
ner and Stanford began its acceler
ated program with emphasis or
courses for wartime work.
Reserves Called
In January of this year the Armj
called members of the Enlisted Re
serve Corps at the end of Winter
Quarter.
Soon after the Farm's 321 men left
on April 5 to report for active duty
negotiations got under way with
Army officials for a contract under
which up to 500 soldiers would be
sent to Stanford for reclassification
and assignment.
On April 12 Chancellor Wilbur
announced that the negotiations
had been completed and that the*
members of the units would arrive
that week and would live in Se
quoia.
Dr. J. I'. Mitchell. Registrar, was
appointed chairman of a commit
tee of faculty members to handle
the new Student Training Assign
ment and Reclassification unit.
These faculty members exam
ined the STARs to determine
whether the student was qualified
to enter a special training unit and
at which level he was qualified to
enter.
Then Chancellor Wilbur an
nounced that an advanced engi
neering unit, distinct from the
STARs, was to be sent to Stanford
and housed at Branner. This group
was to be considered students be •
cause they would be here for a
longer period.
ASTP Arrives
On Monday, May 3, 400 Army
specialists arrived for advanced
training in engineering, European
foreign area and language, and per
sonnel psychology. Instruction be -■
gan on May 10.
In May, Toyon and a part of En •
cina were taken over by the Army
to house the increasing number o';
soldier-students.

ASTP units.
At the end of May Frank F.
Walker, financial vice - president,

Alumni Conference that 2,500 sol
diers would be training here by
autumn.
This prediction was proved as,
after a summer during which new
special training units arrived, Fall
Quarter found Stanford' with ap

At present only members of the
special training units or the ASTy's
are here, as the STAR units were

The members of the Army Specialized Training'
Units are familiar figures on the campus now, but a
year ago the scene was a little different.
On Friday, Dec. 11, 1942. The Daily appeared with
the headline "Navy Occupies Branner" and announced

that "The full effect of the war effort,
will be felt by Stanford men next
quarter when they will double up to
make room for the first contingent
of 200 cadets, part of the Naval
Flight Preparatory School being es
tablished here, who will move into
Branner Hall Jan. 7."
The reported occupation did not
occur, however, as the Navy decided
to establish the school at St, Mary's.
The hall men continued in Bran
ner and Stanford began its acceler
ated program with emphasis or
courses for wartime work.
Reserves Called

Army officials for a contract under
which up to 500 soldiers would be
sent to Stanford for reclassification
and assignment.
On April 12 Chancellor Wilbur
announced that the negotiations
had been completed and that the*
members of the units would arrive
that week and would live in Se

Dr. J. I'. Mitchell. Registrar, was
appointed chairman of a commit

the new Student Training Assign
ment and Reclassification unit.
These faculty members exam
ined the STARs to determine
whether the student was qualified
to enter a special training unit and
at which level he was qualified to
enter.
Then Chancellor Wilbur an
nounced that an advanced engi
neering unit, distinct from the
STARs, was to be sent to Stanford
and housed at Branner. This group
was to be considered students be •
cause they would be here for a
longer period.
