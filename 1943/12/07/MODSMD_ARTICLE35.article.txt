# Farm Klystron Makes Radar Beam Possible
## 
### 
Four men, working at Stanford
from I'CiS to 1940. made some of the
j inost important of the initial radar
j developments when they developed
! the Klystron, making possible a
} powerful beam oscillating at high
frequency.
Radar, which is making possible
I the destruction of Axis ships, pro
jects an ultra-high frequency beam
which reflects objects and enables
I operators to judge the distance of
the object from the radar. The name
j radar is an abbreviation of radio
detecting and ranging.
Four Men Named
Although the conception of radar
j was simultaneous in the minds of
I leading scientists, the work of Si
| gurd and Russell Varian, research
j associates at Stanford, and W. W.
Hansen and David L. Webster, pro
fessors of physics here, laid the base
! for its further development.
The klystron beam has been
termed a Jack-of-all-trades. The
klystron tubes generate an invis
ible beam which, when shot
downward from an airplane, can
tell the pilot how far above the
ground he is flying. Shot ahead,
it warns him of hidden mountains
in time to change his course.
It can be used as a communica
tions beam permitting ships to talk
j with one another without other
ships picking up the message. It
also can be sent through fogs to
! warn ships off rocks or from crash
ing into one another.
Communication Uses
Telephone engineers say they can
I shoot 600,000 conversations simul
taneously through a six-inch cross
t country pipe line.
The birth of the klystron was no
i accident. It was the result of years
of experimenting.
The Varian brothers had been
working on their idea at Halcyon,
California, until they decided they
needed a physics lab.
Russell Varian. who had re
ceived his A.B. and A.M. degrees
from Stanford, worked with the
Humble Oil and Refining Com
pany and the Farnsworth Tele
vision Corporation, suggested they
come to Stanford to see if they
could make arrangements to use
the University equipment.
Dr. David L. Webster, head of
! the Stanford physics department,
j made the brothers research asso
j ciates without pay and gave them
| the use of the laboratory and shop.
I Bill Hansen joined them in their
j research.
Sigurd Varian had been a flight
j captain for Pan-American Airways
on Mexican and Central American
j routes and had written his brother
j that something must be done to
j guide planes into airports through
! the fog.
Hansen Device Helps
Professor Hansen had invented a
device which could bombard elec
trons and multiply their velocity
j manifold. Russell thought this
! m|ight be the clue to the strong
short-wave beam which would
make plane landings safe, so Sigurrl
' left Pan-American and the broth
ers began work on the invention.
After painstakingly eliminating
2(> different ideas, they canie up
with the 27th which was the kly
stron. a little machine weighing
about five pounds. It throws a
strong beam in a wave length
about four inches long, and cuts
through static and every other
type of interference.
The Sperry Gyroscope Company
contracted to produce the klystrons
I for commercial and military uses
1 after first sending Stanford a check
I for $25,000 to finance klystron re
i search.
All four of the men who did the
I initial research work at Stanford
are gone from -the campus and the
work is continuing under the direc
j tion of Dr. Clark Spangenburg, as
j sociate professor of physics.
