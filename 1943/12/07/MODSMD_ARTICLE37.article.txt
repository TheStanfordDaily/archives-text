PACIFIC FLEET H.Q., PEARL
HARBOR, Dec. 6 (UP).—Powerful
United States Navy carrier task
forces have attacked the heavily
defended Marshall Islands, develop
ing with impressive swiftness the
American mid - Pacific offensive
which began with the conquest of
the Gilbert Islands only two weeks
ago, Admiral Chester YV. Nimitz an
nounced today.
The attack was made Saturday.
Details were not immediately
known here because of the necessity
for a complete radio blackout by
the attacking fleet to insure secrecy
of movement.
It was indicated, however, that
the attack had been one of first
rank.
"Strong carrier forces attacked
the Marshall Islands on Dec. 4 (west
longitude elate," Nimitz announced

in a communique. "Due to the
necessity for radio silence details
are not yet available."
Nimitz made his announcement
of the Marshalls attack only a day
! before the second anniversary of
the Japanese attack on Pearl Har
bor, which the most powerful navy
in history has only started to
avenge.
The Gilberts are British man
dated islands, but the Marshalls, far
more important and undoubtedly
much more heavily fortified, are
under Japanese mandate—a purely
nominal arrangement, for Japan re
gards them as her own.
There was no specific informa
tion as to the size of the force which
made the attack.
(Japan had reported, in a Tokyo
radio broadcast, that more than 100
United States planes had attacked
the Marshalls.)
