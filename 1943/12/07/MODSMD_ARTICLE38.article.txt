## MURAL FOOTBALL Fightin' Q.M. Meets Dinah's In Defense of League Lead 
### Don Langendorf 
In the day's outstanding battle, the
contest that could very well decide
the championship of League A, the
high-riding Fightin' Q.M., unde
feated at this date, run up against its
toughest opponent to date, Dinah's.
Dinah's has only been on the short
end of the score once this season,
falling into defeat at the hands of the
McKinley Bashers. The pressure is
on for the Quartermasters today for
they have to win to stay out of a
four-way tie for the top position.
Dinah's has easy sailing after this
afternoon's battle while the Fightin'
Q.M.'s face Navy Thursday and Mc-
Kinley next Tuesday to end up the
season. Neither of those two games
will be runaways, so we will see to
day what the Fightin' Q.M.'s can do
against really tough competition. It
looks to us as if Dinah's will break
the win streak and march off the field
victorious.
Navy Faces Firehouse
The Navy aggregation will have
to play lots of fine ball if they expect
to come out victorious over the hard
fighting team representing the Fire
house. Although losing by a lopsided
score to Dinah's, the Firehouse is a
good outfit and might very well take
the game. Navy can't be counted out

Navy Faces Firehouse
The Navy aggregation will have
to play lots of fine ball if they expect
to come out victorious over the hard
fighting team representing the Fire
house. Although losing by a lopsided
score to Dinah's, the Firehouse is a
good outfit and might very well take
the game. Navy can't be counted out

as it has only one loss chalked up
against it thus far this season, the
only team to turn the trick being
Dinah's. Should Firehouse win,
Navy will be virtually eliminated
from the championship race, and
therefore Navy feels that it has to
win. Because of this, we play the
favorite this time and back Navy.
The league-leading LFA team of
League B meets the Monroe B boys
and should win without much trou
ble.
Riding on a win sti - eak of seven
| games, Co. E, Team 2 conies up
i against a strong combination from
Co. D. The former team should win
without over-everting themselves.
The Thompson Co-op, sporting one
of the best records for a civilian
team, faces the Co. E. Team 1 bunch
and should go down to defeat unless
they can pull a miracle.
In the day's outstanding battle, the
contest that could very well decide
the championship of League A, the
high-riding Fightin' Q.M., unde
feated at this date, run up against its
toughest opponent to date, Dinah's.
Dinah's has only been on the short
end of the score once this season,
falling into defeat at the hands of the
McKinley Bashers. The pressure is
on for the Quartermasters today for
they have to win to stay out of a
four-way tie for the top position.
Dinah's has easy sailing after this
afternoon's battle while the Fightin'
Q.M.'s face Navy Thursday and Mc-
Kinley next Tuesday to end up the
season. Neither of those two games
will be runaways, so we will see to
day what the Fightin' Q.M.'s can do
against really tough competition. It
looks to us as if Dinah's will break
the win streak and march off the field
victorious.
