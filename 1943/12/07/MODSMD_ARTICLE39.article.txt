# Co. K, Varsity Win in Soccer
## 
### 
Out of last weekend's soccer tilts
came one very close and interesting
battle and one walkaway. In the close
contest, the Stars took the Co. Iv
group by a 2-0 score. The Stanford
Varsity had little trouble in downing
the players of Roosevelt Hall by
scoring six goals to the one marker
chalked up by Roosevelt.
The Stars had no easy time of it
last Saturday afternoon as they
emerged victorious over the never
say-die outfit representing Co. K.
The Stars took an early lead in the
first period as Svoboda kicked the
ball through the goalie for a one
point lead which they never re
linquished after that.
Co. K fought the winners evenly
through the remainder of the period,
but were never able to make any of
their many attempts good.
Tlie game was put on ice in the
second period when Wolinskv put a
score over to end the scoring for the
day at two for the Stars and none
for the valiant men from Co. K.
In Friday afternoon's tussle the
Stanford Varsity, ablv coached bv

Harry Maloney, rode rough-shod
over the Roosevelt Hall aggregation.
The teamwork of the civilians was
the deciding factor in Roosevelt's
defeat. The Stanfordites had the sit
uation well in hand at all times, and
there was never a moment when it
wasn't obvious that theirs was the
better team.
Spark-plugged by forwards Sid
well and Morrison, who scored a
large percentage of their six points,
Stanford showed superiority and
brought praise from all watchers.
The general consensus of opinion is
that the Stanford Varsity will finish
the season without a blemish to mar
its record.
