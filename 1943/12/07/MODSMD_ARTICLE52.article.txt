# 1941 Grad Wins DFC in Pacific
## 
### 
After more than a year in the
Southwest Pacific, the first part of
which he described as a "rat race,"
Lieut. John McChesney, '41, is back
in the United States instructing
combat crews in Florence, South
Carolina.
McChesney received the Distin
guished Flying Cross for his work
in Australia when he brought his
bomber back with the controls, the
pilot, and one engine all shot out.
A Cluster was added another time
when his squadron was riddled by
flak in going after a transport.
He met his brother, Lieut. Peter
McChesney, '43, in Australia under
adverse circumstances. Peter had
shipped out on a B-24 to Guadal
canal as a co-pilot.
After three missions, he was
wounded on the ground during a
raid on Henderson Field, and sub
sequently received the Purple
Heart. His brother John received
permission from General Mac A
rthur to fly to his side.
