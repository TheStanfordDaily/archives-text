## 
### 
Chief pilot for General Douglas
Mac Arthur and twice receiver of
the Distinguished Flying Cross,
Henry C. Godman, Stanford '36, is
i'.ow a lieutenant colonel. He re
ceived his promotion somewhere in
Australia in October.
Col. Godman was a member of the
119 th Bomb Group at Clark Field
when the Japs attacked, and his
plane — 4-03097 — later became
known as the famous "Alexander
She Swoose." It escaped the first
raid and is the lone plane of the
p'oup still flying today.
Evacuated from Manila
When the fall of the Philippines
appeared imminent, Godman was
one of many pilots to be evacuated
!o Australia. He took part in the
Java fight, and on March 12, 1942,
he participated in the long-distance
bombing of Jap-held islands in the
Philippines.
In addition to flying much-needed
medical supplies to Americans and
Filipinos on Mindanao, he was or
dered to pick up "someone" on the
return trip. That person was Gen
eral Mac Arthur. However, God
man's plane crashed just before
reaching its destination, and instead
< 112 flying the General, Godman was
a passenger on Mac Arthur's plane.
Home on Leave
One of his first jobs as Mac A
rthur's chief pilot was to fly the
general to New Guinea in late 1942
to direct the fighting over the Owen
Stanley Mountains. He also pilots
Major General Richard K. Suther
land, chief of staff, on his frequent
flights in the Southwest Pacific area.
Col. Godman has been with his
family in Palo Alto for the last two
months. While attending Stanford,
he was a member of the swimming
team, which helped his luck in his
two crashes into the sea.
