# RESULTS
## Chest Drive Nets $5,504 
### 
The final tally of the War Chest
Drive among Stanford students
shows a grand total of $5,504.72, with
54.088.12 contributed in cash and
$1,436.60 promised on pledge cards.
From students not living in Uni
versity residences or sorority houses,
$255.50 was received in cash. This
sum was low because a majority of
this off-campus group had been con
tacted by local War Chest Drives in
their communities previous to our
drive.
First Attempt
The ASTP units, who purposely
were not solicited, added $7.27 to the
fund.
When asked about the success of
the War Chest Drive, Chairman Chic
Brubaker commented:
"Since this was the first attempt at
a combined drive under the ASSU.
many things were learned by trial
and error. These points will be
helpful in planning drives in coming
years. However, I am satisfied with
the results of the drive."
Chairmen Named
Assisting Chairman Brubaker on
the War Chest Committee were Janet
Hale, who handled the finances, and
Callie Curtis and Dick Martle, who
were in charge of women's and men's
campaigns, respectively.
Subchairmen were Merriam Mar
getts, who headed the drive among
the sororities; Dodie Crile, who was
in charge of collections in Lagunita,
Ewell Sale, in Roble, and Peggy Mc-
Clean in Union.
The grand total received from the
drive will be divided among Dimes
for Diplomas. War Student Service
Fund. Palo Alto War Chest Fund,
and Infantile Paralysis Fund. The
latter will receive 10 per cent and the
others 30 per cent each of the total.
