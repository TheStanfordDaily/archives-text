# Former Injun Gridsters Play on Service Teams
## 
### Jim Weinberg 
The fact that Stanford did not
have a football team of its own this
season has not kept Stanford men
from making a mark for themselves
on the gridirons of the nation.
Many former Stanfordites, now in
the uniforms of the Army, Navy,
and Marines, have made fine records
wi(h service elevens and with the
teams of the schools to which the\
have been transferred.
Perhaps the best performance of
all has been that of Norm Standlee.
Standlee, along with Frankie Al
bert, Pete Kmetovic, and Hugh
Gallarneau, was one of the main
stays of a Stanford baokfield which
ranks among the best backfields in
intercollegiate football history.
Camp Davis Star
Standlee, after graduating from
the Anti-Aircraft OCS at Camp Da
vis, North Carolina, has played a
whale of a game at fullback for the
Camp Davis football squad. He has
averaged more than B'2 yards per
try in 39 ball-carrying assignments.
His blocking has been superb. He
also handles the kicking chores for

Davis. His punting average is 50
yards; his kickoffs usually go over
the goal line; and he has had no
little success in points-after-touch
down.
The nucleus around which Cal's
backfield was built at the begin
ning of the 1!)43 season was an
other former Stanford man. Bill
Joslyn. Bid never got to play for
the Cardinal because he was Ath
ertonized. Nevertheless, he chose
to remain at Stanford, football or
no football.
U.C.L.A. Quarterback
Handling the first-string quarter
back duties for U.C.L.A. this season
was another former Stanford man,
Bobby Andrews. Bobby was Ray
Hammett's understudy as quarter
back for last year's Model T at
Stanford.
Bob Frisbee, first-string halfback
for Cal, completes the list of Card
backfield men who have made
names for themselves this year.
The list of Stanford linemen who
have done so is even longer.
Best Lindner.
The best line performances turned
in by former Indians are those of
a pair of wingmen from our last
year's eleven, Hank Norberg and
Dave Brown. Hank has done a swell
job at end for March Field's Fourth
Air Force Bombers. He will prob
ably be All-Coast on every such
mythical eleven which includes
service men.
Dave Brown, a Navy V-12 trainee,
was end on the first team at U.C.L.A.
A couple of weeks ago, in the re
match between the Bruins and
U.S.C.. Dave was responsible for one
of the brightest plays of the year.
Trailing 7-6 late in the second quar
ter, the Trojans were deep in U.C.-
L.A. territory and were threatening
to score again. It was at this point
that Blown broke through into
S.C.'s backfield, intercepted a lat
eral, and raced 80 yards to the goal
line to put the Bruins out in front,
13-6.
Also on the Bruins' first team is
Bob Rohrer, who played on the
Stanford frosh last season. Cal's line
has been bolstered by the play of
several Stanford men. Among them
are tackles Bill Cox and Fred
Boensch, and guards Bill Hachten
and Dick Madigan.
Yes, even though they no longer
"fight for the conquering Cardinal,"
the '"Sons of the Stanford Red" have
not been prevented from distin
guishing themselves in the great
American game of football.

Also on the Bruins' first team is
Bob Rohrer, who played on the
Stanford frosh last season. Cal's line
has been bolstered by the play of
several Stanford men. Among them
are tackles Bill Cox and Fred
Boensch, and guards Bill Hachten
and Dick Madigan.
Yes, even though they no longer
"fight for the conquering Cardinal,"
the '"Sons of the Stanford Red" have
not been prevented from distin
guishing themselves in the great
American game of football.
The fact that Stanford did not
have a football team of its own this
season has not kept Stanford men
from making a mark for themselves
on the gridirons of the nation.
Many former Stanfordites, now in
the uniforms of the Army, Navy,
and Marines, have made fine records
wi(h service elevens and with the
teams of the schools to which the\
have been transferred.
Perhaps the best performance of
all has been that of Norm Standlee.
Standlee, along with Frankie Al
bert, Pete Kmetovic, and Hugh
Gallarneau, was one of the main
stays of a Stanford baokfield which
ranks among the best backfields in
intercollegiate football history.
Camp Davis Star
Standlee, after graduating from
the Anti-Aircraft OCS at Camp Da
vis, North Carolina, has played a
whale of a game at fullback for the
Camp Davis football squad. He has
averaged more than B'2 yards per
try in 39 ball-carrying assignments.
His blocking has been superb. He
also handles the kicking chores for

Davis. His punting average is 50
yards; his kickoffs usually go over
the goal line; and he has had no
little success in points-after-touch
down.
The nucleus around which Cal's
backfield was built at the begin
ning of the 1!)43 season was an
other former Stanford man. Bill
Joslyn. Bid never got to play for
the Cardinal because he was Ath
ertonized. Nevertheless, he chose
to remain at Stanford, football or
no football.
U.C.L.A. Quarterback
Handling the first-string quarter
back duties for U.C.L.A. this season
was another former Stanford man,
Bobby Andrews. Bobby was Ray
Hammett's understudy as quarter
back for last year's Model T at
Stanford.
Bob Frisbee, first-string halfback
for Cal, completes the list of Card
backfield men who have made
names for themselves this year.
The list of Stanford linemen who
have done so is even longer.
Best Lindner.
The best line performances turned
in by former Indians are those of
a pair of wingmen from our last
year's eleven, Hank Norberg and
Dave Brown. Hank has done a swell
job at end for March Field's Fourth
Air Force Bombers. He will prob
ably be All-Coast on every such
mythical eleven which includes
service men.
Dave Brown, a Navy V-12 trainee,
was end on the first team at U.C.L.A.
A couple of weeks ago, in the re
match between the Bruins and
U.S.C.. Dave was responsible for one
of the brightest plays of the year.
Trailing 7-6 late in the second quar
ter, the Trojans were deep in U.C.-
L.A. territory and were threatening
to score again. It was at this point
that Blown broke through into
S.C.'s backfield, intercepted a lat
eral, and raced 80 yards to the goal
line to put the Bruins out in front,
13-6.
