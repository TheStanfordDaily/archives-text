At the wheel of the jeep in which
Mrs. Franklin D. Roosevelt rode
when she visited Rockhampton,
Australia, in August was Captain
Walter H. Skielvig,
As the jeep and Mrs. Roosevelt
bounced up the hillside, the Stan
ford man remarked, "Hang on to j
your hat!"
Captain Skielvig, who was an
R.O.T.C. student on the Farm, was
conducting the First Lady on a tour
of veteran troops of New Guinea
fighting.
