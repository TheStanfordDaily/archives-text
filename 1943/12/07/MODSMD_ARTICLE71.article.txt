# It's Been Two Years—Today We Pause in Reflection...

But Can You Remember When—
U \A T e w °k e U P anc * they told us that Japanese
VV planes had attacked Hawaii. That Pearl
Harbor had been bombed and that soon the
United States would declare war on the Japa
nese. All that day we went through the motions
of studying and listened to the radio for news of
the East That night we slept, thinking
about the coming day, thinking about what Con
gress and the President would do, not thinking
very much about books and classes even though
it was fast coming time for finals." —The Daily,

Our Lethargy Was Jarred —Could
Anything Change Our Farm!
"Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor that fateful
Sunday morning of Dec. 7 dealt the final blow
to Stanford's tottering but tenacious "Ivory
Tower" attitude toward the war, toward inter
vention, toward anything which did not directly
affect our little orbit of college life."—The Daily,
Jan. 6, 1942
Some of Us Thought, Realized,
"Our job in all this period of 'war flux' is to
maintain a stable emotional balance, get as
much as we possibly can out of our University
education."—The Daily, Jan. 6, 1942

Now Forbidden." "Wartime Social Rules Re

1942
Our Thinking Cleared
"If we are to win this war we should fight in
the name of 'National Offense.' It's time we
dropped the negative and assumed the posi
tive—, 'The best defense is the best offense'—,
Every ocean and every continent is involved in
the battle to apprehend the criminals and to give
freedom to the oppressed, and this purpose de
pends on United States' leadership. We must
realize we are on the offensive." —The Daily,
Feb. 18, 1942
And We Found Faith Important.
"Now, in our time, it is difficult to talk of
faith. We are too wise, too proud, too busy,
too scientific, too cynical, too materialistic, for
anything so simple as a deep belief in the
Christian ideal.
"And yet, what are we fighting for?
"Call it what you will, it still comes down to
the idea that man has a soul, great or small, and
that his State exists for him, not he for his State;
that he and his government operate together
on the principle that man has a right to be free,
to live, to believe; that there is good in kind
ness, and that most men are good."—The Daily,

Still We Clamored for the Good,
"We are not the only ones playing madly at
the game of ostrich. The managing editor of a
San Francisco paper remarked the other day
that the edition with the headline 'Bataan Falls'
barely sold the normal number of copies while
it was hard to print enough papers carrying the
banner 'Tokyo Bombed.' We lightly pass over
the disasters as something that would be better
if never mentioned."—The Daily, May 4", 1942
Failing to Recognize the Bad.
"Describing a recent American raid over the

continent of Europe, a news broadcaster simply
said, 'Thirty-seven Flying Fortresses failed to
return.'
"Yet there are those who have written of the
tragedies of war. There are those who have
realized the suffering and the sacrifice. In 1897
Rudyard Kipling wrote 'Recessional,' and for
those v/ho never think twice when 37 Flying
Fortresses fail to return we quote;
" 'God of our fathers, known of old,
Lord of our far-flung battle-line,
.... Lord God of Hosts, be with us yet,
Lest we forget, lest we forget!' "

As Students We Were Puzzled,
"Should youth go to college? .... Dr. Wilbur
said:
" 'All young men and women who can should
get into college as soon as possible and start
specialized training in courses relating to the
war effort.'
"Rather than bring up a generation of journey
men, technicians, and craftsmen who have none
of the benefits of a liberal arts education, even
one cut short, Dr. Wilbur's policy should be
followed."—The Daily, Jan. 5, 1943

of our University:

"We handed out a loud and gala rah-rah. We
blasted loudly and the shouting died. We
found the noise was hollow and the meaning
empty. For the collegiate swing tempo was
hushed by a more powerful symphony of horror.
"We at Stanford have changed some of our
ideas of college life. Our Ivory Towers of bliss
ful isolation and protection, the sanctum of our
Inner Quad, have been invaded by the startling
and meaningful black-face headlines, the exi

W T e Found a Truer Value,
"We can be thankful that this year, more than
ever, we are able to see the true worth of things
for which to give thanks .... Thankful for the
faith which carries us through hours of adver
sity, for the hope which lives in our hearts of
hours yet to come, for the charity of souls who
forego individual happiness that men they've
never known will be thankful in years to come."

.... And we think of the words of a song
every Stanford man and woman loves,
"Fair Stanford, we, thy loyal sons,
Where e'er in life our journey runs,
We'll cherish all the memories dear
That cluster 'round our college years.
Fair Stanford, as we come and go,
And in the field our victories grow,
We'll ever strive to forge ahead
For dear old Stanford and the Red."

"Now, in our time, it is difficult to talk of

too scientific, too cynical, too materialistic, for
anything so simple as a deep belief in the
Christian ideal.
"And yet, what are we fighting for?
"Call it what you will, it still comes down to
the idea that man has a soul, great or small, and
that his State exists for him, not he for his State;
that he and his government operate together
on the principle that man has a right to be free,
to live, to believe; that there is good in kind
