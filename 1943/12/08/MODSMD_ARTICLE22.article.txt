Classroom standards don't hold good on the battlefield.
Former college men now stationed at remote Army posts are
learning that there is no "coasting through" this war. A soldier
on a South Pacific island won't get by a Jap sniper with only 65
per cent alertness. A torpedoed sailor won't survive on a life
raft with only 70 per cent of the necessary endurance. In those
tests of war there is no middle ground. A man excels or fails.
We who still enjoy the security of the campus are being
tested too. We are up for exams in faith, understanding, and
effort in the war program. A 65 per cent belief in democracy is
not enough. A fair understanding of our war economy won't do.
We can't crib through this war by leaving it up to our fellow
%
students to do the saving and economizing necessary to prevent
inflation.
We who have so much to gain in a sound post-war world
cannot be satisfied with less than excellent in these crucial tests.
We must give complete support to the War Savings Program.
Every War Stamp or Bond we buy raises the average of gen
eral welfare. Every cent we spend on non-essentials puts victory
farther away. We must be 100 percenters —we cannot maintain
the standards of our currency, we cannot provide vital military
equipment, we cannot win the peace with less.
