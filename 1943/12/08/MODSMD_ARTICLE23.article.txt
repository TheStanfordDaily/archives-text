# Bull Session

### BILL ROSE 
The Anatomy of Sense
It's probably a little late for introductory explanations—seeing
ts there is but one more week of publciation this quarter —but
we are essentially of a tardy nature. So today's topic will be:
What is a Bull Session? That is, Bull Session, not as the Stanford
Daily would think of it (if the Stanford Daily could think), but
as the Stanford Man thinks of it.
Since this is to be a scientific discourse, let us go about it in
a scientific manner—classification under headings looks good
and should scare away all but the most esoteric reader.
And now, as one of my favorite profs would say, shall we
begin?
I. Subject: Bull Session
A. Location
1. A poorly lighted, smoke-filled room, the floors covered
with heaps of musty clothes, razor blades, broken coke
bottles and unfinished term papers. There should be one or
two broken-down chairs—more would create the atmos
phere of a parlor chat which is definitely verboten.
B. Time
1. Anywhere from midnight to 8 in the morning. From 2
4 in the morning before a mid-quarter usually proves satis
factory. The slight feeling of tension tends to make the
minds of the participants more alert and more argumentive.
C. Implements
1. Food and drink of any description helps. Even cokes will
do. However, the serving of refreshments has its draw
backs; as it is liable to cause those not interested in* the
discussion for the discussion's sake to hang around till
the food is gone.
D. Participants
1. Three to five good guys with definite —even extreme —
ideas on certain subjects. More or less than this number
might end up in mass brawl or pistol duel. Hotheads and
noncommittalists are, of course, out.
E. Topics of Discussion
1. Life
a. (Not the magazine) Is it worth the trouble?
b. What you intend to do about it.
2. Politics: For or against the Roosevelt administration.
3. Economics: For or against the capitalistic system.
4. Education:' For or against the American system (Stanford
in particular).
5. The War: For or against Russia.
6. Women: For—in what way.
