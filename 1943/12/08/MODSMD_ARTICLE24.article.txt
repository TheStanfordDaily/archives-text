# Faculty Gives Views on Allied Announcement
## 
### Nada Skidmore 
The opinions of three members of
the Stanford faculty represent the
wide diversion in viewpoints of the
public toward the significance of the
statement issued from Teheran yes
terday by President Roosevelt, Win
ston Churchill, and Josef Stalin. The
statement contained the resolve of
the United Nations to continue the
war against Germany from three
fronts, east, west, and south, until
victory is won.
Matthew Evans, instructor of his
tory, takes the conservative road
and states that he sees public opinion
as falling into one of two categories.
According to Mr. Evans, the first
group believes that the noncommit
tal statement indicates that no de
finite plans have been made by the
United Nations, presumably because
of lack of agreement on vital issues.
Political Secrecy
The second group regards the
semi-silence from Teheran as nat
ural because of the exigencies of
war requiring military and political
secrecy. Mr. Evans hesitates to reach
a final conclusion from the Teheran
statement, although he states that he
agrees with the latter group in that
"This is obviously the wrong time
for us to issue statements which
would create issues and dissensions
between the peoples of the United
Nations."
Another instructor of the history
department, Jere C. King, believes
that the statement indicates that the
members of the conference are meet
ing "first things first." He continues
with the comment, "If nothing else,
this development means that there
will be no open break between the
United Nations until victory has
been won. It signifies the resolve of
the nations to cohere to a program of
unity, but it also seems a sign that
diverse opinions will arise in the
post-war period."
Ideological Conflict
According to Mr. King, the fact
that no detailed post-war plans for
Germany were announced indicates
the probable appearance of an ulti
mate ideological conflict . between
Anglo-American and Russian fac
tions. He considers American ideals
of tradition and order in direct con
trast to the "drastic social reforms,
if not social involutions, of Russia."
Agreement Reached
Philip W. Buck, professor of poli
tical science, offers his opinion as
follows:
'"The statement undoubtedly
means that a substantial agreement
has been reached as to the military
strategy of the war against Germany,
and that the first tentative steps to
ward post-war planning may have
been taken." Mr. Buck elaborates
with the comment that the presumed
conflicts on the second front, mili
tary, and political policies have been
settled, and "sufficient basis of agree
ment has been reached to make pos
sible formulation of plans for the
future."

ural because of the exigencies of
war requiring military and political
secrecy. Mr. Evans hesitates to reach
a final conclusion from the Teheran
statement, although he states that he
agrees with the latter group in that
"This is obviously the wrong time
for us to issue statements which
would create issues and dissensions
between the peoples of the United
Nations."
Another instructor of the history
department, Jere C. King, believes
that the statement indicates that the
members of the conference are meet
ing "first things first." He continues
with the comment, "If nothing else,
this development means that there
will be no open break between the
United Nations until victory has
been won. It signifies the resolve of
the nations to cohere to a program of
unity, but it also seems a sign that
diverse opinions will arise in the
post-war period."
Ideological Conflict
According to Mr. King, the fact
that no detailed post-war plans for
Germany were announced indicates
the probable appearance of an ulti
mate ideological conflict . between
Anglo-American and Russian fac
tions. He considers American ideals
of tradition and order in direct con
trast to the "drastic social reforms,
if not social involutions, of Russia."
Agreement Reached
Philip W. Buck, professor of poli
tical science, offers his opinion as
follows:
'"The statement undoubtedly
means that a substantial agreement
has been reached as to the military
strategy of the war against Germany,
and that the first tentative steps to
ward post-war planning may have
been taken." Mr. Buck elaborates
with the comment that the presumed
conflicts on the second front, mili
tary, and political policies have been
settled, and "sufficient basis of agree
ment has been reached to make pos
sible formulation of plans for the
future."
The opinions of three members of
the Stanford faculty represent the
wide diversion in viewpoints of the
public toward the significance of the
statement issued from Teheran yes
terday by President Roosevelt, Win
ston Churchill, and Josef Stalin. The
statement contained the resolve of
the United Nations to continue the
war against Germany from three
fronts, east, west, and south, until
victory is won.
Matthew Evans, instructor of his
tory, takes the conservative road
and states that he sees public opinion
as falling into one of two categories.
According to Mr. Evans, the first
group believes that the noncommit
tal statement indicates that no de
finite plans have been made by the
United Nations, presumably because
of lack of agreement on vital issues.
Political Secrecy
The second group regards the
semi-silence from Teheran as nat
ural because of the exigencies of
war requiring military and political
secrecy. Mr. Evans hesitates to reach
a final conclusion from the Teheran
statement, although he states that he
agrees with the latter group in that
