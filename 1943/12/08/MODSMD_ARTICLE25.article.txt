# Farm, Cal Squads Debate New Deal
## 
### 
Debaters Mabel Adkinson and
Frank Creede will attempt to prove
I that the New Deal is "not not dead"
j in an audience debate with a Cali
l fornia team to be held tomorrow
! night at 7 in the lounge of the
| Women's Clubhouse.
The Stanford team, chosen from
! members of the squad after try outs
last Monday night, will uphold the
! negative of the question. "Resolved,
j that the New Deal is not dead." and
' will therefore not be obliged to prove
that the New Deal is dead, but
j merely to disprove that it is not dead,
i Since the Stanford squad has not
j made an extensive study of the ques
tion, the debate will be in the nature
i of an exploratory discussion with de
j bate-style presentation, to be fol-
I lowed by an open forum
