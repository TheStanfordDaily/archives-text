Inspires Servicemen
Mr. Menuhin has performed before
hundreds of army camps throughout
the country since our entrance into
! the war two years ago. One of his
| greatest contributions in the war
! effort, aside from numerous relief
| benefit concerts, is the inspiration
which his music has given to men in
' the armed forces, giving them a
j stronger feeling of what they are
fighting for.
Of the role he performs in building
i the morale of our men in the service,
j the artist says, "Playing for the
j troops has been the most exciting
! part of my Central American tour."
1 He remarked that he "finds soldier
j audiences much more responsive
i than civilian audiences .... the
j farther away from home or the
| nearer to action they are, the more
intensely they enjoy good music.''
Soldiers in the AST will be given
I passes to attend the concert if they
j have no classes on the night of
l Monday, Dec. 20, and if their grades
are up.
