# TUES. SERIES
## Technics Grow, Not Technique 
### Cyclone Covey 
Several hundred were turned away
as even students attended the Tues
day Series last night to see a motion
picture eight years old.
Aside from its entertainment, this
showing of "The Informer" was a
retrospective demonstration that in
eight years Hollywood's progress has
been almost solely technical.
It is to be noted that in spite of the
picture's undiminished merit, John
Ford, collaborating with the scenarist
Dudley Nichols, made it practically
behind the bosses' backs. And though
Ford received the Academy Award
for direction, the picture itself was
not so awarded, being preceded by
insufficient ballyhoo.
Somehow the good directors man
age to break all the commercial in
(ractibility every once in a while and
make a good picture. And it is
usually the same 15 or so directors
who make the good pictures; of these
15, among the foremost is Ford.
What he did with "The Informer,"
he also did, for example, with "The
Long Voyage Home" and "How
Green Was My Valley." In order
that his talents may be fully ex
ploited when he returns from the
Army, he will probably be assigned
some masochistic melodrama star
ring Tyrone Power.
