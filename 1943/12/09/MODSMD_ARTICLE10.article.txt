# MOOR BORN
## Players Depict Brontes' Life 
### 
; With a confusing wealth of mate
| rial to draw on for background, per
haps the Stanford Players who are
giving ''Moor Born" in the Memorial
Auditorium on Dec. IG, 17, and 18,
are fortunate in having the author,
I Dan Totheroh, near enough for con
' sultation.
The play is a dramatization of the
lives of the Bronte sisters, authors
| of such novels as "Jane Eyre," "The
Professor," "Wuthering Heights,"
and some volumes of poetry. This
famous family has recently been
j publicized in an article in Life mag
| azine which will enable prospective
j ticket-holders to form a particu
i larly good background for under-
I standing the play.
| Cast members, listing Gloria Olivi,
Peggy Fitts, Margaret Morgan, Lio
nel Walford, Herbert Rubin, Jean
Robinson, and Betty Wattenberger,
have been studying toward the per
l formance all Autumn Quarter,
j Voluminous correspondence of the
Brontes as well as many biographies
!of the sisters have been carefully
| gone over. A problem arises in that
; so much definite and detailed data
, can be found to authenticate even
j the most melodramatic - appearing
j lines.
| According to Director F. Cowles
; Strickland it has been necessary to
; form a slogan: "If it's true and seems
true, keep it; if it's true and doesn't
seem true, change it."
Mr. Totheroh was able to visit the
1 campus during the Thanksgiving
j holiday and watch the rehearsals.
|He gave his consent to a small
' change in the position of a stairway,
saying that according to detail, the
stairway in the actual Bronte home,
now a museum, has been changed
despite the care taken by Bronte
enthusiasts.
Tickets for the performances are
85 cents and may be arranged for by
' calling 22041.
