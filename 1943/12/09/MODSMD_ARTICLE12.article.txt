# Farm Barbers Recall Changes in Haircuts

"Shave and a haircut —$1.50." No longer do we have the good old days of
the two-bit "overhaul," but similarly we no longer have the same standard
of living. These, in effect, were the collective words of Jim Pennington and
Ben Fowler, known to most as "the barbers." # These two are by now an
established institution on campus; Jim has been here for 26 years, his part-

ner for seven.
Jim Penington, who maintained
the same shop in the same place that
it is today during the last war, is a
vei liable gold mine of old Stanford
traditions. He owns an autographed I
razor strop, which contains, among
other equally famous names, the sig
nature of Robert Kenny, present At
torney-General of California. The :
walls of his shop are adorned with
dates, teams, and scores of all Stan
ford's league football games since the
last war.
In recalling the barber business of
yore, Jim Penington stated that he
had started the present style of hair
cut on campus. Formerly much more j
hair was left in back, and the neck 1
trim was squarer, not tapered as |
now. Cardboard pictures of the var
ious types of "cuts" were hung j
around the shop for inspection by the
prospective patron, and this type,
known as "football style" was pre
ferred by an overwhelming majority.
Penington combined and blended
this with the military haircut to pro
duce our present generally accepted j
style.
As for soldier haircuts in this war. ;
the barbers agreed that only the j
"more particular'' men in uniform '
came to the shop, since the regular j
G.I. "butches" are provided free by
the Army. These men are more
proud of their hair, and want a really
good haircut.
Naturally the labor and materials
shortages have affected the campus
barber shop. Supplies such as tonics ;
containing oil or alcohol were de
scribed as "very scarce." Thus most |
of the trade is now in haircuts, while j
formerly a great deal of business was !
done in the sale of shampoos and
tonics. Naturally many of the finest
tools, which were previously "made
in Germany" are not available at all
now.

razor strop, which contains, among
other equally famous names, the sig
nature of Robert Kenny, present At
torney-General of California. The :
walls of his shop are adorned with
dates, teams, and scores of all Stan
ford's league football games since the
last war.
In recalling the barber business of
yore, Jim Penington stated that he
had started the present style of hair
cut on campus. Formerly much more j
hair was left in back, and the neck 1
trim was squarer, not tapered as |
now. Cardboard pictures of the var
ious types of "cuts" were hung j
around the shop for inspection by the
prospective patron, and this type,
known as "football style" was pre
ferred by an overwhelming majority.
Penington combined and blended
this with the military haircut to pro
duce our present generally accepted j
style.
As for soldier haircuts in this war. ;
the barbers agreed that only the j
"more particular'' men in uniform '
came to the shop, since the regular j
G.I. "butches" are provided free by
the Army. These men are more
proud of their hair, and want a really
good haircut.
Naturally the labor and materials
shortages have affected the campus
barber shop. Supplies such as tonics ;
containing oil or alcohol were de
scribed as "very scarce." Thus most |
of the trade is now in haircuts, while j
formerly a great deal of business was !
done in the sale of shampoos and
tonics. Naturally many of the finest
tools, which were previously "made
in Germany" are not available at all
now.
"Shave and a haircut —$1.50." No longer do we have the good old days of
the two-bit "overhaul," but similarly we no longer have the same standard
of living. These, in effect, were the collective words of Jim Pennington and
Ben Fowler, known to most as "the barbers." # These two are by now an
established institution on campus; Jim has been here for 26 years, his part-

ner for seven.

the same shop in the same place that
