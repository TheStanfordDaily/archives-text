# 'Cooperation' Is Contest Topic
## 
### Vicky Sellens 
At a time when the word "co
operation" is foremost in the news
and when the headlines are full of
accounts of nations' leaders meeting
to discuss cooperative movements, it
is fitting that the subject for the third
annual Inter-American Affairs Dis
cussion Contest should be "Bases for
i Permanent Cooperation Among the
American Republics."
It is especially fitting that Stanford
students should be interested in sub
mitting a manuscript to the contest
and trying for the $500 first prize,
since the Pacific regional contest,
which was last year held in Denver,
is to be held this year on the Stan
ford campus, March 22.
To enter the contest, the student
must write a speech manuscript of
not more than 1,000 words and sub-
J mit it to the Stanford contest com
| rnittee by Feb. 15. Members of this
; committee will then select the two
! best manuscripts, which will be sent
to Washington, D.C. to be judged in
competition with those entered by
the other universities in the Pacific
region.
The students who prepare the
; eight, top-ranking manuscripts in
each of the six regions throughout
| the nation will be given an expense
paid trip to the school where the
regional contest is being held in their
I area.
