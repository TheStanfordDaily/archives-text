## MURAL FOOTBALL Fightin' Q.M. Favored to Top Navy Squad in Close Contest 
### Roger Corman 
Fightin' Q.M., the only unbeaten
team in the intramural football
league, runs up against the fast and
tricky Navy squad this afternoon.
The winner of this tussle will prob
ably go on to take the league crown,
as Navy is the soldiers' closest com
petition for the league lead. Navy's
potent T-formation will furnish
plenty of fireworks, but Fightin' Q.M.
should take this one by a touchdown
and go on to win the championship.
McKinley Over Firehouse
McKinley faces the powerful Fire
house, in what may turn out to be
the best game of the day. McKinley
needs to take this one to stay in the
running for the title, and according
to the records should be able to win
it; but the Firehouse is a tough team
to beat and could pull an upset. We'll
take McKinley by one marker.
In the other important game of
League A, once - beaten Dinah's
comes up against the in and out
Stoates. Dinah's has too much power
for the Stoates and should take this
one by two or more touchdowns.
Co. LFA Favored
The top game of League B pits
circuit-leading Co. LFA against up

and coming Co. A. Co. LFA rates as

opposition than bargained for.
Co. C & A, one of the top con
tenders, runs into Co. E, Team 2, in
a contest that shapes up as a knock
'em down and drag 'em out affair.

two touchdowns, but only after a
hard fight.
Co. E Heavy Favorites

it meets the McKinley B team. The
high-riding soldiers pack too much
! power for McKinley to cope with,
and should take it by three or four
[ touchdowns.
Two other strong teams have easy
; matches, as Co. D, Team 1, comes up
I against Lincoln, and Buchanan op
poses Van Buren. Co. D figures to
j overpower Lincoln for at least a

to the records should be able to win
it; but the Firehouse is a tough team
to beat and could pull an upset. We'll
take McKinley by one marker.
In the other important game of
League A, once - beaten Dinah's
comes up against the in and out
Stoates. Dinah's has too much power
for the Stoates and should take this
one by two or more touchdowns.
Co. LFA Favored
The top game of League B pits
circuit-leading Co. LFA against up

and coming Co. A. Co. LFA rates as
the better team, but Co. A has been
improving fast and may furnish more
opposition than bargained for.
Co. C & A, one of the top con
tenders, runs into Co. E, Team 2, in
a contest that shapes up as a knock
'em down and drag 'em out affair.
Co. C & A should take this one by
two touchdowns, but only after a
hard fight.
Co. E Heavy Favorites
Co. E, Team 1, has a breather when
it meets the McKinley B team. The
high-riding soldiers pack too much
! power for McKinley to cope with,
and should take it by three or four
[ touchdowns.
Two other strong teams have easy
; matches, as Co. D, Team 1, comes up
I against Lincoln, and Buchanan op
poses Van Buren. Co. D figures to
j overpower Lincoln for at least a
| two-touchdown win, while Buchanan
I should take Van Buren by about
| three touchdowns.
Fightin' Q.M., the only unbeaten
team in the intramural football
league, runs up against the fast and
tricky Navy squad this afternoon.
The winner of this tussle will prob
ably go on to take the league crown,
as Navy is the soldiers' closest com
petition for the league lead. Navy's
potent T-formation will furnish
plenty of fireworks, but Fightin' Q.M.
should take this one by a touchdown
and go on to win the championship.
McKinley Over Firehouse
McKinley faces the powerful Fire
house, in what may turn out to be
the best game of the day. McKinley
needs to take this one to stay in the
running for the title, and according
to the records should be able to win
it; but the Firehouse is a tough team
to beat and could pull an upset. We'll
take McKinley by one marker.
