GET THE AD HABIT
So intent have I been on perusing this column each morning
that my readership of the rest of The Daily has been sorely
neglected. Today a section of the paper was pointed out to me
which I feel worthy of your attention. In interest and humor it
is on a par with the best stuff you have found in Bull Session.
(And that's some concession for me to make!)
I speak not of the masthead, but of the Classified Ads. In
going over the past few issues of The Daily, I have found several
gems which are herewith passed on to you. The Farm has, it
seems, completely escaped the evils (and benefits) of modern
advertising methods.
Last Thursday someone offered for sale a "MOD. 7-rm. home.
3 or 4 bd. rms., central heat, -car garage." (The idea probably
being they lop off or add on one boudoir according to what you
are willing to pay.)
"MOSE," the Stanford man's Chase Bank has a pleasant little
blurb in the section every day, as does the CAMPUS SHOE
SHOP, which says of itself: "Next to Bookstore P.A. 24388." (If
brevity is the soul of wit, this one's a riot.)
Then there is the girl who wanted a formal and winter coat,
Size 14. She either got it or gave up in frustration, for her ad
stopped Monday. Another young lady lost a "BEIGE POLO
COAT, brown buttons, at Gaieties practice Dec. 2." and appar
ently has not yet found it. (Maybe she has and keeps the ad in
as a good excuse for missing her 8 o'clock these frosty mornings.)
Yesterday someone lost "Shell rimmed, stems painted with
red nail polish. In tan leather case." (I haven't seen any shell
rimmed, stems painted with red nail polish around lately. Have
you?") Someone else lost a "long jade earring" in front of Me
morial Hall, which strikes us as a little macabre.
Also in yesterday's Daily the following ad appeared. "WANT
TD—New Chemistry 1, 2, 3 teacher who doesn't dance. Call
22166." (22166 is The Daily's number, if that's any help.)

as a good excuse for missing her 8 o'clock these frosty mornings.)
Yesterday someone lost "Shell rimmed, stems painted with
red nail polish. In tan leather case." (I haven't seen any shell
rimmed, stems painted with red nail polish around lately. Have
you?") Someone else lost a "long jade earring" in front of Me
morial Hall, which strikes us as a little macabre.
Also in yesterday's Daily the following ad appeared. "WANT
TD—New Chemistry 1, 2, 3 teacher who doesn't dance. Call
22166." (22166 is The Daily's number, if that's any help.)
GET THE AD HABIT
So intent have I been on perusing this column each morning
that my readership of the rest of The Daily has been sorely
neglected. Today a section of the paper was pointed out to me
which I feel worthy of your attention. In interest and humor it
is on a par with the best stuff you have found in Bull Session.
(And that's some concession for me to make!)
I speak not of the masthead, but of the Classified Ads. In
going over the past few issues of The Daily, I have found several
gems which are herewith passed on to you. The Farm has, it
seems, completely escaped the evils (and benefits) of modern
advertising methods.
Last Thursday someone offered for sale a "MOD. 7-rm. home.
3 or 4 bd. rms., central heat, -car garage." (The idea probably
being they lop off or add on one boudoir according to what you
are willing to pay.)
"MOSE," the Stanford man's Chase Bank has a pleasant little
blurb in the section every day, as does the CAMPUS SHOE
SHOP, which says of itself: "Next to Bookstore P.A. 24388." (If
brevity is the soul of wit, this one's a riot.)
Then there is the girl who wanted a formal and winter coat,
Size 14. She either got it or gave up in frustration, for her ad
stopped Monday. Another young lady lost a "BEIGE POLO
COAT, brown buttons, at Gaieties practice Dec. 2." and appar
ently has not yet found it. (Maybe she has and keeps the ad in
as a good excuse for missing her 8 o'clock these frosty mornings.)
