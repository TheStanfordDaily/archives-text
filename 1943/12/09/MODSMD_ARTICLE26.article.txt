According to Webster's Dictionary, a library is a collection
of books, or place where such a collection is kept for studying
and reading. Webster mentions nothing about a library func
tioning as a large-scale date bureau. Euch an inovation is
something new and is becoming a paramount attraction of the
Stanford Library, at least as far as a large number of freshman
women are concerned.
It is quite annoying to sit in the library and attempt to study
v/hile having to listen to childish gibberish and giggling. In
fact it is very distracting.
The G.l.'s are certainly not to blame. There is hardly a man
living who would refuse a date presented on a silver platter.
A suggestion might be to inaugurate a date bureau at some
other spot instead of at the Libe. For instance, the English cor
ner. However, that would be too brazen. Dignity must be main
tained at all costs.
Perhaps the Art Gallery, for that would put things on a higher
level. But there is an unwritten law that Stanford students just
don't go to the Art Gallery.
The best answer is to return to the old orthodox methods of
getting dates. If you like date bureaus, there is a legitimate one
being run at Lagunita.
A return to the old methods would save a lot of talk, allow
people to study in peace at the library, and besides, people have
been doing it for years.
