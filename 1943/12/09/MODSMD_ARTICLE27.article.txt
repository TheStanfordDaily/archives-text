# Campus Shoe Shop Business Quadrupled Since Rationing
## 
### 
Since the rationing of shoes last spring, the world in general and Stan
ford in particular have been increasingly conscious of their perishable and
unreplaceable footwear. When autos became practically extinct and walk
ing became a necessity, shoe leather on the Farm wore out alarmingly fast.
This is proved by the fact that the business of the Campus Shoe Shop

has increased four times since ra
tioning began, according to Mr. Al
bert Delyon, owner of the store.
Because he has only two people to
work in place of the four he had in
pre-war days, Mr. Delyon admits
that the increase in demands for re
pairing has kept the shop more than
busy. It was necessary last spring to
shut down the cleaning and shining
department of the shop to make time
for the more essential repairing.
However, there are certain brighter
aspects to the business of shoe re
pairing on the campus. Although he
does not receive priorities, Mr. Del
yon states that he has been able thus
far to get sufficient leather to fill the
demand; and in addition, it is of an
even better quality than that he re
ceived before the war. One whole
side of the shop is filled with the new
machinery which Mr. Delyon bought
in 1941, shortly before the OPM
clamped down on the delivery of
such materials.
