up squad, will have the arduous job
of dismantling the palm trees, pam
pas grass, murals, and crystal ball,
in fact all of the Arabian splendor on
which the decorations committee
has worked. Joyce Costello, Lagu

will be glad to accept any volunteers
for the clean-up work on Sunday
morning.
Guests are promised lots of music
for dancing as Art Weidner's 10-
piece orchestra will play Saturday

relax in typical Arabian style on
cushions scattered around the edge
of the room.
If anyone has some extra pillows
to contribute for the evening they
may be turned in to Betsy Barker
at Lagunita.
