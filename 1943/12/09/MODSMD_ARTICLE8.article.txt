ferences, the Germans have opened
a new large-scale offensive in Yugo
slavia, hurling fresh troops from
Greece, Albania, and Austria to ac
tion in an attempt to crush the Yugo
slav people's army of liberation, it
was revealed today.
Heavy fighting was reported raging
at a number of points on a 200-mile
line stretching from the Sarajevo area
to the head of the historic Vardar
River Valley invasion route.
