A DURATION DO!
our slyrts arc valuable items these days and
appreciate special handling,
I urn up your shirt collar before sending it
to the laundry. A collar washed flat doesn't fray
so easily at the crease.
Have your shirts laundered frequently. A too
soiled shirt requires more scrubbing and conse
quently wears out more quickly.
Go easy on the starch. Starching stiffens fabric,
so that it breaks instead of bendm".
W hen you buy, buy Arrow, Arrow shirts are
longer-lasting, better-fitting, and carry the San
forized label (fabric shrinkage less than 1%).
