### United Press 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS. ALGIERS, Dec. 9.â€”Fifth Anny troops
! have seized new heights north and west of their Mount MUggiore salient,
completing Allied domination of the lower Liri valley, and the British
1 Eighth Army has struck inland from the Adriatic in heavy fighting that
may presage a pincers drive on Rome, it wa.s disclosed today.
(The Swiss radio said the Allies had occupied Mignano. German strong-

hold controlling the main pass into
the X_.iii valley.)
American troops advancing down
the north slope of Mount Maggiore
were less than a mile from the val
ley, official reports said, after scal
ing the precipitous peak in a per
formance that a United States bri
gadier general said would go down
in history with the storming of Que
bec.
In the Maggiore heights and Ca
mino area itself, Lieut. Gen. Mark
W. Clark's American and British
troops cleaned out all enemy pock
ets of resistance except one on the
extreme northwest slope of Mag
giore and another on the western
slope of Camino.
Bypassing the enemy pocket on
the western slope of Camino, British
troops slashed through lightly re
sisting German rear-guards and
captured Mount Groce.
The advance carried the British
almost to the banks of the Gari
gliano river just before it is joined
by the Liri.
