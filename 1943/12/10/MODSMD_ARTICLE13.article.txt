j Suggestions Welcome
"We welcome suggestions and any

I everyone to realize that Council acts

The attitude of Women's Council
expressed in Miss Guthrie's talk is as
! follows: "The rapid turnover of war
is bound to bring many changes . . .
probably the most unfortunate one
being the loss traditions and the
i weakening of such institutions as the
Honor Code and the Fundamental
Standard. We feel that bringing the
t Honor Code to the attention of a
J group and encouraging discussion
; brings about deeper convictions on
I the subject."
In their speeches, the representa
! tives of Women's Council are stress
ing that added to the ideal of per
j sonal honor involved in the Honor
Code is the responsibility of group
honor. This will be discussed at the
meetings, as will the application of

Honor Code is an integral part of

, portance should be carried home to
the student. II the Honor Code can
i survive the present period, we expect
it to have a future even greater than
its past. Whereas the important
i phase of education is in building
minds, one of the ends of university
training is building character. Men's
Council feels that a true Stanford
man is representative of the finer at
tributes which the Honor Code and

According to Reynolds, the whole
relationship of the student to the
faculty is one of the mature and
adult concepts of the Honor Code.
