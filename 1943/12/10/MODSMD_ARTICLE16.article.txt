## 
### 
Dr. S. W. Chun, assistant professor
of Chinese, expressed the opinion
that the innate likeness oil the
American people and the Chinese in
their attitude of individual freedom,
tolerance and broadmindedness, fos
tered by their existence on great
continental expanses, would serve
them as allies "even in common de
feat if it could not be in common
victory."
Before the "Y" World Affairs
Group Dr. Chan pronounced the
i view of numerous groups that if
Japan had been stopped in Man
i churia, where the Chinese have
I been fighting since 1931, there would
have been no invasion of Ethiopia
| or Poland, and probably no Pearl
| Harbor attack.
Chinese Manpower
The manpower of China could
I provide an army of fifty million.
| This enormous number, oddly
| enough, is overlooked by many of
i us who think of the machines of
; warfare and forget the men neces
sary to man them.
China is making a vital contribu
! tion to post-war peace by its splen
did program of unification of Orien
| tal peoples, carried on in the face
| of the Japanese attempt to convince
i Asiatics that Japan is their only
j hope against the white races. Chi
j na's opposition, and co-operation
| with the whites, of course, make
| Japanese racial propaganda a mere
I sham, said Dr. Chan.
Recapture of Ports
The recapture of at least one or
I two Chinese southeastern ports,
along with the reopening of the

Burma Road, will be necessary to
get sufficient planes and other sup
plies to the hard-fighting Chinese.
Dr. Chan believes.
"We will be lucky if the war
closes in 1945," said Dr. Chan, He
also expressed the opinion of some
authorities on the problem, includ
ing Chiang Kai-shek, who believe
the program of rehabilitation will
take a hundred years and will ne
cessitate the use of American and
European capital and personnel.

Japan had been stopped in Man
i churia, where the Chinese have
I been fighting since 1931, there would
have been no invasion of Ethiopia
| or Poland, and probably no Pearl
| Harbor attack.
Chinese Manpower
The manpower of China could
I provide an army of fifty million.
| This enormous number, oddly
| enough, is overlooked by many of
i us who think of the machines of
; warfare and forget the men neces
sary to man them.
China is making a vital contribu
! tion to post-war peace by its splen
did program of unification of Orien
| tal peoples, carried on in the face
| of the Japanese attempt to convince
i Asiatics that Japan is their only
j hope against the white races. Chi
j na's opposition, and co-operation
| with the whites, of course, make
| Japanese racial propaganda a mere
I sham, said Dr. Chan.
Recapture of Ports
The recapture of at least one or
I two Chinese southeastern ports,
along with the reopening of the

Burma Road, will be necessary to
get sufficient planes and other sup
plies to the hard-fighting Chinese.
Dr. Chan believes.
"We will be lucky if the war
closes in 1945," said Dr. Chan, He
also expressed the opinion of some
authorities on the problem, includ
ing Chiang Kai-shek, who believe
the program of rehabilitation will
take a hundred years and will ne
cessitate the use of American and
European capital and personnel.
