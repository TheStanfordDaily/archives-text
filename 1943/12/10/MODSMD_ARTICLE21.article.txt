# Soldier Student Describes Popular European Entertainment as Similar to American Fun
## 
### Joe Hawkins 
The thought uppermost in our
minds today as the weekend ap
proaches is "getting away from it
all." We want to relax, enjoy our
selves, and forget the lab writeups
overdue and how far behind we are
in Western Civ. This urge to "let
go" over the weekend is evidently
not confined to this country, accord
ing to Cpl. Eric Feiler, who has
lived most of his life in Europe.
Entertainment for the average per
son plays just as important a part in
Europe as it does here, said Corporal
Feiler, although it takes somewhat
different forms. It is on a simpler,
more individual basis than it is here,
and there is not so much mass en
tertainment.
Born in Austria
Eric Feiler speaks from experience
since he was born in Austria, and
has traveled through Italy, Yugo
slavia, Turkey, Germany, and most
of the Balkan countries. He went to
school in Vienna, finishing eight
years of "gymnasium," and starting
to business college. Five months
after the occupation in 1938, Eric
Feiler left his country, going first to
Yugoslavia, then to Italy, from which
he came to New York. There he be
came a salesman, and went to night
school after work. About a year ago
he received an "invitation" from the
Army, and was first sent to the medi
cal department at Camp Robinson,
Ark. Corporal Feiler got his chance
for the ASTP when a call was put
out for linguists at Ft. Leonard
Wood, Mo. He is now taking a
brush up course in the German area
and language 9-L group, and classi
fied himself as "waiting for ship
ment."
In speaking of the entertainment
in Europe from the point of view of
the average pei'son, Corporal Feiler
called attention to the fact that his
statements would apply mainly to

the central, eastern, and southern j
countries, and not to such places as i
France or England.
Movies More Conservative
Movies are much more conserva
tive, generally running only one fea
ture and a newsreel, and certainly
not continuous performances as in
this country. Shows are usually held
two or three times in an evening, and
the tickets are not on a "first come,
first serve basis," but rather are for
specific seats at a particular show.
According to Corporal Feiler, a great
many of the movies come from this
country, and in this case, subtitles
are inserted to translate the words
and actions of the actors. He also
stated that American pictures are
much more appreciated by the aver
age audience, and that they drew
bigger audiences than those forced
upon the movie houses by the Ger
man propaganda party.
The stage holds much the same !
position that it does in this country j
and is generally concerned with the !
more "intellectual" patrons. "In |
most countries," said Corporal Feiler,
"you will find one or two theaters j
run by the state. These give very j
excellent performances." Then there I
arc liable to be several others, but i
they often have some difficulty since j
the people cannot afford stage plays
too often. Thus students are often
found standing in back while there
are still empty seats in the most ex- ,
oensive section.
Different Sports
Sports, too, play a very important j
position in the lives of Europeans, ,
and differ only in the types which
are played. Soccer, of course, is the
continental sport, and people are
perhaps even more fanatical over
these games, said Corporal Feiler. |
Vienna, for instance, has a huge
modern stadium for just such games,
and during game time, "the city
practically closes up to go." Over the
weekends a great many people take

part in winter sports such as skiing
or ice skating, and in Vienna there
is even a huge artificial ice skating
rink.
Perhaps some of us who have been
driven almost insane by radio plugs
would enjoy ourselves in Europe
since, said Corporal Feiler, radio
programs in Europe are definitely
not on an advertising basis. In addi
tion to the price of the radio, a
monthly fee is collected if one wishes
tolisten to his set. The whole set-up
is owned and backed by one com
pany, and is under government su
pervision with monthly fees collected
by the postman.
The radio programs themselves are
almost the same as in this country,
although they do not include quite so
much music during the day, stated
Corporal Feiler, summing up the sit
uation by saying that "the European
radio is mainly a political weapon of
the government." Thus when Ger
many occupied many of the countries
over there, they first seized the main
radio station. Feiler added that
"when it comes to pure entertain
ment and education, American radio
can give much more than the Euro
pean."
As for private parties, Corpora!
Feiler said that house parties played
a very important part in entertain
ment. Picnics, consisting of long
hikes, were often held, and differed
from ours in the absence of auto
mobiles. We go for a Sunday outing
in the family jalopy, decide on a nice
place to park and spread out the
picnic table. In Europe however,
picnics are more for exercise.
In the evenings parties in small
beer gardens in the hills overlooking
the city are often held, at which time
the people sing, listen to the soft
music, and get sentimental, said
Corporal Feiler. Perhaps we in this
country do not differ so much in the
way we like to spend our free time
after all.
