# Women Fall Below Quota 011 Bandages;
## 
### 
Only 1,128 surgical dressings had
been made this week in the room
in the Women's Clubhouse up until
Wednesday night, which number fs
far below the quota.
The December quota of surgical
dressings is particularly high, and
those workers who have signed up
to make bandages one hour per
week are needed desperately. Fi
nals are still several weeks away,
so there is no reason to let up on
war work yet, according to the
surgical dressings chairman.
