# G.I. Armchair Commandos See Action
## 
### Cpl. Carl Princi 
The inverted V ladder, the high
rope wall climb, the wall vault, pole
climb, the log maze and the over
wall - and - under - barriers obsta
cles are events that are an integral
part of the athletic life of a soldier
here at Stanford. These and many
other obstacles go to make up one
of the best planned obstacle courses
in the country.

The purpose of this course for
G.I. college boys is to attain a high
degree of muscular development
and to supplement the mental effi
ciency attained in the classroom for
these so-called "armchair comman
dos." The rough routine, to which
are devoted six hours per week (two
of them on the obstacle course), was
presented to the Army by Everett
S. Dean, acting head of the physical
education department at Stanford
with the co-operation of Husky
Hunt, Pitch Johnson and Myron
Sprague, directors of various events
throughout the physical education
program.
According to the directors, such
development in the AST program
can be achieved only by constant
application of the rules set down by
rigid Army specifications to which
Dean and his staff have shown
strict adherence.
The high wall rope climb—as pic
tured on this page—may prove to
be an impossible feat if the hand,
foot and body movements are not
executed in perfect co-ordination.
Richard Cornelius of San Diego
and J. B. Brockway of West Vir
ginia, both of Company A, covered
the full distance of the course Sat
urday morning in three minutes 24
seconds, and four minutes 40 sec
onds, respectively, according to Mr.
Dean. The record time for the
course is two mlinutes 46 seconds,
established last March in an exhi
bition run by a St. Mary's Pre-
Flight cadet.
For those who think it's easy, we
suggest you try it.
