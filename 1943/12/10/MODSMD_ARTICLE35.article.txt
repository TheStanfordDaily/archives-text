# Harriman Termed G.I. Voice Of Experience in Liaison Role
## 
### 
Trouble-shooter for the combined
military - academic authorities is
how keen-eyed Dr. Raymond D.
Harriman describes his duties as co
ordinator of the Army programs at
Stanford.
As liaison counselor between the
Army and the faculty, he has be
come a sort of ambassador without
portfolio, highly popular with his
olive-drab students. In the course
of a single day, his characteristic
optimism is challenged by knotty
problems of organization, by the
frequent divergence of the Army
way and the academic way, which
have to be deftly rerouted into a
single compatible channel, and by
the personal problems of his uni
formed charges, to whom he has
become a kind of G.I. Voice of Ex
perience.
Adopts Personal Attitude
The professor's personal atttude
toward their studies and problems
brings him into close contact with
the soldiers. Regarding the former,
he is frankly envious. Like all
good teachers, he remains something
of a schoolboy himself, eager to
learn. Although his brain is already
burdened with all the lore of an
cient Greece and Rome, he cannot
help casting a longing glance at
Stanford's streamlined Japanese
course, while he finds engineering
completely captivating.
This enthusiasm is contagious, and
the dejected soldier, disheartened
by a difficult subject, is apt to leave
Harriman's office light of step and
firmly resolved to make straight A's
for the rest of the quarter.
Crusades Against Rumors
The professor's one-man crusade
against G.I. rumors—a debilitating
rash on the surface of Army life—
is dynamic. Wielding a verbal Flit
gun, he exterminates tall tales right
and left.
'"Some students become discour

aged by the amount of work they
have to accomplish and seize on the
first negative rumor they hear as
an excuse for slacking," he observes.
Such pessimists are revitalized by
the professor's genuine belief in the
future of soldier students at Stan
ford. "Who knows how useful their
studies will prove, or what oppor
tunities will result from them?"
Enemy of Gripe
In mild-mannered Dr. Harriman,
the traditional army gripe has met
its mortal enemy as many a soldier,
for whom the Army has incidentally
held the key of knowledge, will tes
tify.
As civilian educational adviser
in the STAR unit here, and now as
co-ordinator of Army programs and
adviser on the classification board,
Dr. Harriman has been instrumental
in the roller-smooth organization of
one of the ranking A.S.T.P. units in
the country.

The professor's personal atttude
toward their studies and problems
brings him into close contact with
the soldiers. Regarding the former,
he is frankly envious. Like all
good teachers, he remains something
of a schoolboy himself, eager to
learn. Although his brain is already
burdened with all the lore of an
cient Greece and Rome, he cannot
help casting a longing glance at
Stanford's streamlined Japanese
course, while he finds engineering
completely captivating.
This enthusiasm is contagious, and
the dejected soldier, disheartened
by a difficult subject, is apt to leave
Harriman's office light of step and
firmly resolved to make straight A's
for the rest of the quarter.
Crusades Against Rumors
The professor's one-man crusade
against G.I. rumors—a debilitating
rash on the surface of Army life—
is dynamic. Wielding a verbal Flit
gun, he exterminates tall tales right
and left.
'"Some students become discour

aged by the amount of work they
have to accomplish and seize on the
first negative rumor they hear as
an excuse for slacking," he observes.
Such pessimists are revitalized by
the professor's genuine belief in the
future of soldier students at Stan
ford. "Who knows how useful their
studies will prove, or what oppor
tunities will result from them?"
Enemy of Gripe
In mild-mannered Dr. Harriman,
the traditional army gripe has met
its mortal enemy as many a soldier,
for whom the Army has incidentally
held the key of knowledge, will tes
tify.
As civilian educational adviser
in the STAR unit here, and now as
co-ordinator of Army programs and
adviser on the classification board,
Dr. Harriman has been instrumental
in the roller-smooth organization of
one of the ranking A.S.T.P. units in
the country.
Trouble-shooter for the combined
military - academic authorities is
how keen-eyed Dr. Raymond D.
Harriman describes his duties as co
ordinator of the Army programs at
Stanford.
As liaison counselor between the
Army and the faculty, he has be
come a sort of ambassador without
portfolio, highly popular with his
olive-drab students. In the course
of a single day, his characteristic
optimism is challenged by knotty
problems of organization, by the
frequent divergence of the Army
way and the academic way, which
have to be deftly rerouted into a
single compatible channel, and by
the personal problems of his uni
formed charges, to whom he has
become a kind of G.I. Voice of Ex
perience.
