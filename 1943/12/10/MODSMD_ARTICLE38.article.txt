# Bookstore To Pay Additional Rebate
## 
### 
Directors of the Stanford Book
store have announced that an 8 per
cent additional rebate will be paid
to those who have retained their
purchase tickets of last year, from
June 1, 1942 to May 15, 1943. Faculty
and students may collect this rebate
on Monday, Dec. 13, from 9 till 11:30
a.m. and from 2 to 4:30 p.m. This
unusually high rebate is due to the
lact that larger eaJ-nings were made
by the Bookstore than were ex
pected.
The Bookstore is managed for the
convenience of students and faculty,
and is owned by no one individual.
Prices are fixed according to the
Fair Trades Act; hence if the profit is
large, the faculty and students share
a larger amount of it. In addition to
this, however, the profits are dis
tributed to the Scholarship Fund,
Student Aid, and the Loan Fund.
Net profits after payment of this
rebate amount to $11,500 for the fiscal
year. Of this amount, $3,000 goes to
the government for taxes, $5,000 to
the Student Loan Funds, in keeping
with the expressed desire of Stan
lord students a lew years ago, and
5>3,500 will be added to furnish addi
tional working capital for the store.
