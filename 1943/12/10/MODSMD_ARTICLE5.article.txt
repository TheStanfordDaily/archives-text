made by a Christmas committee appointed by President Donald B. Tresid
der. The committee, headed by Dr. D. Elton Trueblood. consists of repre
i sentatives from the civilian and military students, faculty, and military

this will be the first year that the
University has not been closed for
the holidays and the majority of stu
dents must remain on campus.
Open Houses Planned
The festivities, Dr. Trueblood has
announced, are certain to be enjoy
able. Christmas Eve will be most

houses will be held. One open house
will be given jointly by all the men's
living groups on the Row, and per-
haps two open houses will be given
]by the sororities on the Row. La
gunita and Union living groups will
hold open house also.
At 10 p.m., cider and doughnuts
will be served in Union patio, and
there will be caroling. At 10:30 the
activity will shift to the Inner Quad
for caroling around the lighted
| Christmas tree which will stand di
rectly in front of the Memorial
Church. The Quad will be lighted
by torches.
Midnight Church Service
At 11, the students will march into
the Church for the midnight service.
The Church will be reserved for
students, and the faculty and outside
visitors must stay in the balconies.
The program will include special
music by the choir, and the reading
I of the Christmas story. Dr. Lee Em
erson Bassett, emeritus professor of
speech and drama, will give a special
reading which will be announced
later.

outside to listen to the carols which
will be placed from the tower as a
welcome to the new Christmas Day.
