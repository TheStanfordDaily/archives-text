MORE than a little out of place in these out-of
place times is the prospect of Christmas on
the campus which today faces most of Stanford's
civilian as well as soldier students. Not a pleas
ant prospect, surely, but one necessitated by
the University's full-time war schedule.
We who are students axe not alone in v/anting
those Christmas furloughs, which may be our
last chances to spend the holidays at home. All
over the world young men and women are
wishing the same wishes we are for Christmas
at home —and the fun, food, and good cheer
that go with it.
Kind and fatherly University officials, al
though not to blame for the situation, have tried
to ameliorate it by arranging Christmas celebra
tions. On Christmas eve, students will troop to
the Union for caroling, attend open houses at
women's residences, and then at 11 p.m. file
into the Memorial Church for a special Christ
mas service.
Dr. Tresidder in the role of Santa Claus may
seem a little incongruous. Play along with him,
though, and with the University Christmas spirit
his administration is striving for; and let the
iarger Stanford Family supplant your own at
Christmas.—Pat Clary
