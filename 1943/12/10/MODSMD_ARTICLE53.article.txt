# Where to Wait
## 
### 
THE "ride to Paly" or "ride to campus" tra
dition is one of the more popular ones on the j
Farm and has been greatly accelerated by the
increased numbers who do have to walk since
gas rationing. Because of the larger numbers
walking, new regulations have been formed.
Pedestrians must now use the side paths and 1
not walk in the street. This new ruling has been
formulated because of the dangers of casualties
unless those walking keep off the street.
This does not mean that you can't still get
for "rides to Paly." These places have been •
set up in all places where you normally wait
for "rides to PaPly." These places have been j
marked clearly and motorists will pick you up
if you stand there.
Unless both the pedestrian and the motorist j
give their wholehearted cooperation, the former
walking on the paths or waiting only at desig
nated spots and the latter stopping only for
those at the stations, the problem and traffic
hazard will not be solved satisfactorily.—Esther
Belew.
