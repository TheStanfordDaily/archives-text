### Sgt. GASTON VALCOURT Company I. ASTP 
In an obviously doomed attempt to dignify
his unhappy lot, the air force technical train
ing command, has decided to change the title
of the lowly K.P. to "mess attendant."
Temporarily secure from kitchen police de
tails, Stanford's soldiers cannot help speculating
on the wisdom of this new trend. If this sort
of thing catches on, the day may not be far
off, God forbid, when K.P.'s will be known as
"Butlers' aides," "mothers' helpers" or some
thing equally misleading.
The motive for such a change is commend
able, but the mess attendant is likely to be
the butt of as many ill-chosen jokes as was the
K.P. For it is not his title that makes him an ob
ject of ridicule as much as his functions, and
these are unlikely to change.
Even the WACs—that is, the ones who don't
qualify for the Stanford physiotherapy course—
have to do K.P. duty. And their trousered bud
dies would dearly love to pry into a glamor
army messhall to determine'whether the femi
nine K.P. manages to preserve that appearance
of cool assurance which distinguishes her most
arduous duties, or whether she too succumbs
to the steamy confusion of the kitchen.
There is something vaguely reassuring about
the vision of a disheveled WAC, no less mortal
than her buddies in arms, bending over the
garbage pail, her dank hair clinging to moist
features, her erect posture giving way to the
limp prostration of the traditional K.P.
Perhaps she even smashes an occasional dish
—bless her little, G.I. heart—as she lurches un
steadily through doorways, staggering under
stacks of unv/ashed crockery. If she does, more
power to her.
They may change the title to mess attendant,
but it all sounds very much like K.P. to us.
