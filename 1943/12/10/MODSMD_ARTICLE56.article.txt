# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
On the front page of a recent Daily, it is
mentioned that hundreds were turned away
from the performance of "The Informer." Since
this movie is so popular, how about having a re
showing. A nominal fee could be charged with
the proceeds going to the War Chest or some
such worthy cause. Many of us are disappointed
at not being able to get in.
•—Erica Leßouge

To the Editor:
In yesterday morning's paper Old Fashioned
suggested that the G.l.'s return to the old ortho
dox methods of getting dates, or that they use
the legitimate date bureau being run at Lagunita.
The various letters on this subject which have
been in "Campus Opinion" would lead one to
believe that the students are oblivious to the
fact that there has been an all-campus date bu
reau since last Spring Quarter. Every women's
living group and men's company has a social
chairman whose job is to arrange blind dates.
Any man who wishes a date has only to contact
his chairman and state, on a card, his name,
height, interests and college. His chairman will
then call a chairman in some women's living
group, give her the information, and the date is
arranged. Any woman wishing a date, espe
cially for a party such as the Arabian Nights
iance, may give her name to her chairman who
will likewise make arrangements.
Those men who want to meet a girl before
hey take her out, will please remember the
open houses and their purpose.
