## New Garfield Film Pleases 
### 
THE FALLEN SPARROW. now
playing at the Stanford Theater
For a propaganda picture, "The
Fallen Sparrow" is better than av
erage, although it certainly Is no
where near being an Academy
Award picture,
John Garfield, as an American re
turned from the Spanish Civil War
and a Nazi prison camp, turns in a
fine performance as usual, hut the
rest of the cast is nothing to brag
about.
Garfield, as Kit McKitrick, is
tracking down a Nazi who limps.
The Nazi is also tracking Garfield
down and at the climax of the pic
ture they meet. Garfield of course
is the victor, and the police round
up a whole ring of agents including
the love interest, played by Mau
reen O'Hara. Garfield gets his man,
but not his woman.
The second feature is a little opus
by Monogram, "Mr. Mugg Steps
Out," with the East Side Kids. The
picture could well be put in the D
picture category if there were such
a thing.
Football fans will enjoy the news
reel, for it shows shots from the
Army - Navy and Notre Dame-
Great Lakes games. There is also
a March of Time.—Gugel
