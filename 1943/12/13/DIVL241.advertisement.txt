Your Cooperative Bookstore

Because of larger earnings than expected for the fiscal year ended
August 31, 1943, the Stanford Bookstore is returning to the students and
faculty AN ADDITIONAL REBATE OF 8 PER CENT on their purchase
tickets from June 1, 1942, to May 15, 1943. Inasmuch as 8 per cent
was paid on these tickets last spring, this makes a total rebate of 16 per
cent for the year.
The net profits of your Co-operative Bookstore, after the payment
of this 16 per cent rebate, amounted to approximately $11,500.00 for
the fiscal year. Of this amount about $3,000.00 will go to the govern
ment in income taxes, $5,000.00 is being given to the University for
student loan funds—in keeping with the expressed desire of the students
a few years ago, and approximately $3,500 . 00 has been added to Surplus
to furnish additional working capital for the store. The Drectors are
glad to report that your Bookstore is in a healthy and sound financial
condition.
Students and faculty in residence may collect their extra cash bonus
at the office of the store beginning today, December 13th; hours 9:00-
1 1 :30 and 2:00-4:30. Checks will be mailed to others. You are urged
to save your purchase tickets and share in any rebate for the current year.
