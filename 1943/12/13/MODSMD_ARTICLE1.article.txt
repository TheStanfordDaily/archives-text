### Nada Skidmore 
As a part of the holiday activities
planned by Stanford students for
Christmas week, members of Or
chesis, national honorary dance or
ganization, will present a Christmas
program on Tuesday evening, Dec.
23, in the Memorial Auditorium.
"We are giving this program in the
hope that it will contribute to bring
ing the holiday spirit closer to all of
us spending Christmas on campus
this year," Jacqueline Poley-Ogg,
past president of Orchesis, com
mented.
Audience Donates Presents
A plan has been made in con
junction with the War Board to
have the audience donate presents
consisting of cigarettes, candy, and
other inexpensive items, in the lobby
of the auditorium before the per
formance. These presents will be
distributed on Christmas day to sol
diers in local hospitals.
As a special feature, the Stanford
orchestra will play the overture to
the dance program and will accom
pany the dancers with the assistance

of the choir.
A series of dances to the music of
old and well-loved Christmas carols
will form the first part of the pro
gram. These dances were selected
from interpretations composed in
modern dancing classes on the cam
pus. Orchesis is reviving the spirit
and tradition of the medieval period
when the carols were accompanied
by dancing.
The "Juggler" To Be Danced
"The Juggler of Notre Dame," the
well-known story of the juggler who
received the blessing of the Virgin
Mary, will be the second part of the
program. Olgadale Phillipps will
dance the role of the Juggler in her
own interpretation.
The dance will have two themes,
the first of which will be the scene of
merry-making before a medieval
cathedral. The second theme will
begin inside the cathedral, where
crowds have gathered to offer gifts
to the Virgin Mary, hoping to receive
her blessing. Miss Phillipps will pre
sent her interpretation of the Jug
gler's dance, in which he gives his

life to receive the blessing which no
one else had gained.
Characters Through Dances
"The Juggler of Notre Dame" is
being presented as a true dance
drama, in which contrasting types of
characters are expressed through the
various dances. Josephine Haskell
has written the music for the Jug
gler's dance, and the processional
and recessional themes of the drama.
Her original compositions will be
presented by the orchestra as a back
ground to the choreography of the
scenes, which has been done by Or
chesis with the assistance of the fac
ulty adviser, Miriam Bleamaster
Lidster.
The whole program has been
planned by all members of Orchesis
and some members of the modern
dancing groups in a cooperative ef
fort. The choreography, music, and
stage work have all been made orig
inal efforts as far as possible. Gloria
Olivi, president, and Margaret Mor
gan, secretary, are the executives di
recting Orchesis activities for this
quarter.
