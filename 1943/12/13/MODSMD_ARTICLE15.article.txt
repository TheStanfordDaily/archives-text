# CHIVALRY RIDES HIGH
## 
### 
According to the Army Times,
two glamorous Red Cross dough
nuteers arrived the other day at
an airbase in Tunisia to distrib
ute candies and magazines. In a
Hash, the bearded, mud-stained
fighter pilots disappeared, to re
turn for lunch, shaved, scrubbed,
and spotless—proof positive that
American chivalry rides high,
even on the desert.
