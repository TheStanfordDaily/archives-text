### Ed Luce 
Rolf Westley. Jack Miller, and Jim

program Friday by battling their
way into the civilian finals of the
novice tourney now being staged by
coaches Vic Lindskog and Harry
Maloney.
Westly's bout with Jackson's Au
brey Coldiron in the 1 (55-pound class
was the closest of the clay, with the
Monroe fighter getting the nod from
ret' Lindskog through his fine come
back in the latter part of the second
and third rounds.
Coldiron Wins First
Coldiron used his power to advan
tage in the first canto, rushing West
lv 011 numerous occasions and win
ning a clear cut edge on hard rights
and lefts to the face. However in the
second round Westly found the range
with long left jabs to hold his own,
and in the third round had his op
ponent in trouble through his expert
use of the left jab again. Westly will
meet Frwin Rosa in the 165-pound
finals Wednesday night.
Baseballer Jack Miller put on the
best boxing exhibition of the after
noon in taking the decision from
Monroe's Johnny Buinham in one
of the heavyweight semi-final fights.
Miller Has Edge
Using a hard roundhouse lei t to
the side of the afce, Miller clearly
won the edge in the first round.
Buinham opened up in the second
with several short rights and lefts,
but in the third Miller once again
took command, keeping Burnham on
the defensive throughout.
Southpaw Jim Lund earned the
right to meet Miller in the heavy
weight finals by winning over Tink
Wooley via a technical knockout in
the first round. Lund caught his op
ponents with a flurry of hard rights
and haymaker lefts midway in the
first round, and had Wooley out on
his feet when Lindskog stopped the
fight.
