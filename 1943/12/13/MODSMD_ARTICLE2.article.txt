# Play To Begin Run Thursday
## 
### 
With only three more days before
the curtain goes up on the first per
formance of Dan Totheroh's "Moor
Born," the cast is putting increased
effort in polishing the rehearsals of
the play which dramatizes the lives
of the Bronte sisters.
The Stanford Players will present
'"Moor Born" in a three-day run this
Thursday, Friday, and Saturday, ac
cording to Director F. Cowles
Strickland. Tickets for 85 cents may
be purchased in the drama depart
ment.
That "the story of this Yorkshire
family is perennially fascinating," a
quotation from the Literary Digest,
is proven in the all-around interest
recently shown in the Brontes. The
Book of the Month Club has chosen
a Bronte work as a dividend. Life
magazine ran a feature on the
Brontes.
Richard Dana Skinner wrote this
comment on "Moor Born." "It is un
questionably a play deeply illumi
nated by fine perception, strong
feeling for character and for sub
conscious emotional tumult and a
play with many haunting overtones
of poetic imagination. . . . "Moor
Born" deals with historical charac
ters in their most important aspect as
creative literary artists.
"This particular scene (the death
of Branwell) isone of the amazing
dramatic moments of our modern
theater."
