I'M DREAMING OF A SLIGHT CHRISTMAS
There comes a time in every year when the thoughts of men
(and women) turn to Christmas shopping. Again that time has
come. And again most of us are at a loss to know what to get
or how to get it or what to get it with. The last has proved the
most pressing problem for lots of us.
Even if we still could make those freguent excursions to the
city, even if the market was overflowing with merchandise of
of pre-war guality and guantity, the perilously rapidly approach
ing holiday season would present many of us with a sizable head
ache.
If you've started your Christmas shopping, you are well
aware of the fact that we are at war. It has been drummed into
your pacifistic brain by every salesman from Walster's to Berg
dorf Goodman. It is the panacea for all complaints—scarcity of
goods, inferiority of goods, and prices of goods.
I have found neither the variety nor the class of merchandise
for sale nearly so reprehensible as the cost. Perhaps the fact that
some of us are in more straightened financial circumstances than
usual makes the amounts we are asked to pay seem dispro
portionately great.
Whatever the reason, Christmas buying this year seems ex
orbitantly expensive. I know bceause I went shopping the other
day.
At first I thought things wouldn't be so bad. I got Grandpa
a jug of red wine and some new strings for his zither all for
two bucks. Pleased with my bargain I went to another store to
buy something for my mother. I asked a comely salesgirl what
she could show me in perfumes. Something nice, I said, but not
too high. She produced a bottle about the size of a pocket watch.
"This is called 'Stop.' It's for the woman who knows when
to say 'no'," she whispered.
"How much?" I asked.
"Only thirty-five."
"Cents or dollars?"
"Dollars!" She seemed indignant.
"That might be all right for my girl," I said, "but my mother
doesn't know when to say no."
She brought forth a flacon shaped like a boa constrictor with
the head of Boris Karloff. "This is 'Menace' (She pronounced it
like a true Francophile). It's for the snake in her. Here, smell."
I did. It was a cross betwen buturic acid and the Oakland
mud flats. "There's no snake in my mother," I said. "Have you
anything else?"
She seemed impatient, but she smiled obligingly and held
out another bottle. " 'Jeunesse,' the essence of youth." She said
it as if she believed it.
I took a whiff of it and must admit it was pretty good. "How
much?" I asked meekly.
"Fifty."
"Have you got it in a smaller size?"
"Yes. It also comes at thirty-five, twenty-twenty, and ten."
"Let's see the ten," I said, chintz that I am.
She brought out a microscope and pointed to the eye-piece.
"Look in there," she said.
I did. There it was staring at me—big as an amoeba. "Forget
it," I wheezed.
On the way out I saw a sign that read "Let Henry Morgenthau
Solve Your Christmas Shopping Problems!" I did. All my rela
tives and friends are going to receive a defense stamp (the pink
kind) with a card reading "It's the thought that counts."

"This is called 'Stop.' It's for the woman who knows when
to say 'no'," she whispered.
"How much?" I asked.
"Only thirty-five."
"Cents or dollars?"
"Dollars!" She seemed indignant.
"That might be all right for my girl," I said, "but my mother
doesn't know when to say no."
She brought forth a flacon shaped like a boa constrictor with
the head of Boris Karloff. "This is 'Menace' (She pronounced it
like a true Francophile). It's for the snake in her. Here, smell."
I did. It was a cross betwen buturic acid and the Oakland
mud flats. "There's no snake in my mother," I said. "Have you
anything else?"
She seemed impatient, but she smiled obligingly and held
out another bottle. " 'Jeunesse,' the essence of youth." She said
it as if she believed it.
I took a whiff of it and must admit it was pretty good. "How
much?" I asked meekly.
"Fifty."
"Have you got it in a smaller size?"
"Yes. It also comes at thirty-five, twenty-twenty, and ten."
"Let's see the ten," I said, chintz that I am.
She brought out a microscope and pointed to the eye-piece.
"Look in there," she said.
I did. There it was staring at me—big as an amoeba. "Forget
it," I wheezed.
On the way out I saw a sign that read "Let Henry Morgenthau
Solve Your Christmas Shopping Problems!" I did. All my rela
tives and friends are going to receive a defense stamp (the pink
kind) with a card reading "It's the thought that counts."
I'M DREAMING OF A SLIGHT CHRISTMAS
There comes a time in every year when the thoughts of men
(and women) turn to Christmas shopping. Again that time has
come. And again most of us are at a loss to know what to get
or how to get it or what to get it with. The last has proved the
most pressing problem for lots of us.
Even if we still could make those freguent excursions to the
city, even if the market was overflowing with merchandise of
of pre-war guality and guantity, the perilously rapidly approach
ing holiday season would present many of us with a sizable head
ache.
If you've started your Christmas shopping, you are well
aware of the fact that we are at war. It has been drummed into
your pacifistic brain by every salesman from Walster's to Berg
dorf Goodman. It is the panacea for all complaints—scarcity of
goods, inferiority of goods, and prices of goods.
I have found neither the variety nor the class of merchandise
for sale nearly so reprehensible as the cost. Perhaps the fact that
some of us are in more straightened financial circumstances than
usual makes the amounts we are asked to pay seem dispro
portionately great.
Whatever the reason, Christmas buying this year seems ex
orbitantly expensive. I know bceause I went shopping the other
day.
At first I thought things wouldn't be so bad. I got Grandpa
a jug of red wine and some new strings for his zither all for
two bucks. Pleased with my bargain I went to another store to
buy something for my mother. I asked a comely salesgirl what
she could show me in perfumes. Something nice, I said, but not
too high. She produced a bottle about the size of a pocket watch.
"This is called 'Stop.' It's for the woman who knows when
to say 'no'," she whispered.
"How much?" I asked.
"Only thirty-five."
"Cents or dollars?"
