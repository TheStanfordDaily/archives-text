# 'Girl Crazy' Stars Rooney

GIRL CRAZY—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
M-G-M has given this Broadway
success of a few seasons ago an elab
orate production with Mickey
Rooney, Judy Garland, and Tommy
Dorsey's Orchestra in the feature
roles. Rooney and Miss Garland are
given many opportunities to display
their talents in a story (what there
is of it) that is a natural for them.
Rooney is seen as a spoiled youth
from the East who is sent to a West
ern cow-college. There he meets
postmaster Judy Garland and wades
through all opposition to gain her
enduring affections. But in the mean
time Rooney's school is in dire finan
cial straits and it takes a last
minute plea to the state governor,
together with a rodeo, to put the col
lege back on its feet. Sandwiched in
with all these boring activities are
many of George Gershwin's songs,
including "I've Got Rhythm," "Em
braceable You," and "Treat 'Em
Rough."
Because of its slipshod plot and
poor supporting cast, "Girl Crazy"
is destined to takes its place in
1943's endless list of disappointing
pictures. But there are some good
moments — especially Rooney's im
personations of famous people and
the "I've Got Rhythm" finale.
Once again Richard Arlen and
Jean Parker make life miserable for
us in the second feature, "Alaska
Highway," another of the Pine-
Thomas productions for dear old
Paramount. It's a saga of the diffi
culties of the Army engineers in the
north woods and is up to the usual
poor standard of Arlen-Parker pic
tures. —Bower
