# Women's Duty After War Told
## 
### 
In speaking to the "Y" Women in
the World group and other interested
women Friday night, Mrs. Helene
Heymans said that all Europe looks
toward America for all they need,
and that American women cannot
fail them.
Outlining four principal reasons
why American women can and must
contribute to Europe after the war,
Mrs. Heymans said that they are in
telligent, physically fit, and intellec
tually well trained.
Secondly, American women can
take an objective viewpoint toward
Europe, since they have been di
vorced from the emotional experi
ences which produce hate and intol
erance.
In the third place, Mrs. Heymans
stated that American women's in
dustry and generosity can and must
supply the whole world with every
thing from "beds and prefabricated
houses down to needles and thread."
And finally, the position of our
women as Americans and their great
prestige will stand them in good
stead, according to Mrs. Heymans.
In describing some of the difficul
ties which American women must
face in Germany, Mrs. Heymans said
that when Hitler goes, he will be
come a god and in a few years there
will be another god unless the Allies
can substitute other ideas and prove
that they will work.
One of the women attending the
discussion asked, "Where do we
start?" In reply Mrs. Heymans de
clared, "It begins with you now from
this very moment, and you must
start now to think and build toward
the future."
