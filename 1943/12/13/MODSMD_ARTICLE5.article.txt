Art Wiedner will make his ap
pearance at the Farm for the second
consecutive week when he and his
band play for the freshman formal
this Saturday night. "From all ap
pearances this dance will be one of
the best of the quarter," stated Ham

pect about 300 couples, girls from
Roble, Cash Ventura, and Naranja."
From 9 to 1, couples will dance in
an atmosphere of Christmas spirit.

the occasion. A quartet of girls will
present this song for the guests.

dates call for them. Lola Jungbult,
