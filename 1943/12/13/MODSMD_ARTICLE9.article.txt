head thrusting into the Kiev salient forcing the first real Nazi withdrawal
since the enemy started his determined efforts to avert the collapse of the
southern front a month ago.
Killing some 1,600 Germans and knocking 35 Nazi tanks out of action.

the First Ukraine Army, apparently
well on the way to regaining the in
itiative in the greling battle of armor,
drove the enemy from several in
habited places south and southwest
from Malin, 58 miles northwest of
Kiev.
Radio Berlin reported that the So
viets had attacked a village south
west of Korosten, which is 28 miles
northwest of Malin. Unless the Ger
man announcer was in error, his
reports showed the Red Army a con
siderable distance beyodn the posi
tion they were believed here to be
holding.
Meanwhile, the Second Ukraine
Army tightened its pincer about the
Dnieper bend industrial city of Ki
rovograd, 62 miles southwest of
Kremenchug, capturing seven Ger
man strong points. The northern
wing of the army moved westward
from Kremenchug along the river,
taking the county seat town of Ki
rigichig, 40 miles north of Kirovo
grad, last German stronghold on the
west bank of the Dnieper above the
river's big bend.
