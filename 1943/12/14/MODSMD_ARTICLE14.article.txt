# C & A Picked Over Co. D In Mural Grids
## 
### Roger Corman 
Swinging into the final round of
play in the intra-mural football
league, powerful Co. C & A runs up
against the potent Co. D aggregation
this afternoon in a game that will
decide thf championship of League
B. Co. C & A is tied for the league
lead with Co. LFA and has to take
this one to win or tie for the title.
Co. D has showed plenty of fight this
season and could easily pull an upset,
but we'll take Co. C & A by a
touchdown in the top game of the
day.
Co. LFA has an easier time of it
than its rivals. Meeting lowly Van
Buren Hall, the soldiers should have
no trouble in smothering the civil
ians by three or more touchdowns.

The other important game of
of League B pits Co. E, Team 1,
against Co. A. Starting late. Co. A
came into the circuit as a dark horse,
hut has looked good so far and could
upset the high-riding Co. E squad.
Fightin - Q.M., only undefeated
team in either league, meets Mc
kinley, the top civilian squad on
campus, in a game that involves
the championship of League A. The
league-leading soldiers should take
this one, but only after their hard
est fight to date. We'll string along
with Fightin' Q.M. by one marker.
Dinah's, one of the top contenders
for the League A crown, has an easy
closing game with the Theta Hashers.
The Hashers have looked just as bad
a.s Dinah's has good, and will prob
ably lose this one by any score
their opponents choose.
