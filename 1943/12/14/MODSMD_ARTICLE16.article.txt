# Girl Mariners Lead Scouts
## 
### 
To help Palo Alto high-school
girls discover the pleasures of boat
ing, swimming, and all crafts and
sports that have a seafaring back
ground, three Stanford women,
Helen Wiggs, Dorothy Huff, and
Doris Vivian, have volunteered to
aid the Girl Scouts in the organiza
tion of the Girl Mariners, the femi
nine version of the Sea Scouts. '
The three women, all of whom
come from different sections of the
county, were Mariners themselves
before coming to Stanford. While
working as Girl Scout leaders here,
they became interested in showing
the fascinating erafts and sports of
the sea to Palo Alto girls.
Although the group has had only
one meeting, it has already inaug
urated plans to take over a part of
the former Stanford elementary
school as a clubhouse. In addition,
plans have been formulated which
require every member to pass her
swimming test.
