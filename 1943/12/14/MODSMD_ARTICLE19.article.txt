# Claire Marton To Speak on Microscopy
## 
### 
Mrs. Claire Marton will lecture on
"Specimen-Preparing Methods for
Electron Microscopy" in a seminar
which will be held at 4:15 this alter
noon in the Department of Electron
Optics.
Faculty, students, and visitors are
welcome to attend the meeting,

| which will be preceded by tea. The j
| Electron Optics Department is lo- j
' cated just south of the Memorial j
l Chapel, next to the ROTC headquar- j
| ters.
Scientist's Wife
Mrs. Marton is the wife of Dr.
' Ladislaus Marton, famed Belgian sci

| entist in the field of electron micros
; copy. She has been his "most faith -
j ful and valuable collaborator" ever
| since he began his work.
Dr. Marton Lectures
Dr. Marton received his degree at
the University of Zurich, Switzer
land, in 1924. He was on the faculty

of the University of Brussels in Bel
gium before coming to this country
in 1938. In this country he was first
a faculty member of the University
of Pennsylvania, and later was in
charge of electron microscope de
velopment for the Radio Corporation
of America.

At a similar seminar last month.
Dr. Marton lectured on the construc
tion and performance of his new
Stanford Electron Microscope. Mrs.
Marton will discuss the preparation
of slides for the microscope today.
This process is very much different
from that used with ordinary micro
scopes. '
Glass slides cannot be used in
electron microscopy, because they
cannot be made thin enough and for
other reasons. Collodion films, about
1/2,500,000 th of an inch thick, are the
supports most commonly used. Ex
tremely fine wire mesh is also some
times used.
Ex t reinc 1 v P<>werfu I
The electron microscope has
aroused great interest because of its
ability to go beyond the limits set
previously for microscopic observa

tion.
Its outstanding feature is that it ;
i operates with electrons instead of
with light. The optical system is :
constructed of "immaterial" lenses, j
! made of electric or magnetic fields.

By substituting paper-board boxes
for these made of critical materials
; the folding box industry in 1042
saved 215 million pounds of critical
I metals, 8 million board i'eet of lum
ber. 750.000 pounds of glass, 220,000
: pounds of cellophane, 30.000 pounds
of pliofilm, and 12.000 pounds of
; rubber.

Dr. Marton Lectures
Dr. Marton received his degree at
the University of Zurich, Switzer
land, in 1924. He was on the faculty

of the University of Brussels in Bel
gium before coming to this country
in 1938. In this country he was first
a faculty member of the University
of Pennsylvania, and later was in
charge of electron microscope de
velopment for the Radio Corporation
of America.

At a similar seminar last month.
Dr. Marton lectured on the construc
tion and performance of his new
Stanford Electron Microscope. Mrs.
Marton will discuss the preparation
of slides for the microscope today.
This process is very much different
from that used with ordinary micro
scopes. '
Glass slides cannot be used in
electron microscopy, because they
cannot be made thin enough and for
other reasons. Collodion films, about
1/2,500,000 th of an inch thick, are the
supports most commonly used. Ex
tremely fine wire mesh is also some
times used.

The electron microscope has
aroused great interest because of its
ability to go beyond the limits set
previously for microscopic observa

tion.
Its outstanding feature is that it ;
i operates with electrons instead of
with light. The optical system is :
constructed of "immaterial" lenses, j
! made of electric or magnetic fields.

By substituting paper-board boxes
for these made of critical materials
; the folding box industry in 1042
saved 215 million pounds of critical
I metals, 8 million board i'eet of lum
ber. 750.000 pounds of glass, 220,000
: pounds of cellophane, 30.000 pounds
of pliofilm, and 12.000 pounds of
; rubber.
Mrs. Claire Marton will lecture on
"Specimen-Preparing Methods for
Electron Microscopy" in a seminar
which will be held at 4:15 this alter
noon in the Department of Electron
Optics.
Faculty, students, and visitors are
welcome to attend the meeting,

| which will be preceded by tea. The j
| Electron Optics Department is lo- j
' cated just south of the Memorial j
l Chapel, next to the ROTC headquar- j
| ters.
