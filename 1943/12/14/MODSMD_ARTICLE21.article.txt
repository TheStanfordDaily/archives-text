THIS afternoon at 1:30 two young women
will walk out of The Daily Shack. A few
hours later they will return —one as the new
editor and the other as the defeated candidate.
They are two who have pushed in and out
of the old black door for two and a half years.
Both started their long, conscientious careers on
The Daily when they were first-quarter fresh
men.
They've spent their years at Stanford hurried
and tired. They've known the responsibilities
of finding and writing stories by a deadline, of
getting the paper out, of watching the work of
others. They've known what it is to be a
couple of weeks behind in class work, to watch
papers and books and studies pile up and up
until publication ceases and finals approach.
But then they've had two and a half years of
experience on a daily newspaper. They ve
known the thrill of seeing The Daily appear on
Quad, of seeing stories they've written, ideas
they've formulated, pages they've made up.
They know the feeling of pride in day-to-day
accomplishment.
After two and a half years of hard and con
sistent work they reach the climax of their Daily
careers together. Just one can win. But to both,
we hope you feel The Daily has been worth
your time and effort. We know you 11 have no
regrets.
