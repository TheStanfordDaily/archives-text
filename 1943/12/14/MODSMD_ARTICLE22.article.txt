Know Your Stanford
STANFORD is an intimate university — at
least it was. The student body has always been
of everyone else in-his class. He also knew
of everyone else in his class. Heal so knew
people in the other classes who belonged to

: the same organizations or were taking the same
I courses as he. This feeling of closeness with
one's fellow students—as well as with the pro
fessors—has brought a small-town atmosphere
to the Farm which is sorely envied by larger, '
more functional academic institutions.
Despite the great changes the war has
wrought upon the student body, the idea of
intimacy has persisted on the campus. It is a
good idea and should be kept alive and active.
The tremendous shift in the composition of
the student body has done much to destroy the
unity of the school. However, as long as peo
ple like other people, friendships and acquaint
ancse will be established—and through them
the spirit of the Stanford Family will persist.
A feeling of kinship to the many wonderful
people connected with the University, as well
as to one's fellow students and professors, is '
part of the idea.
I wonder how many men and women now
attending Stanford know the supter-efficient
man in the Cellar who is continually wiping off :
the counters and anything else he can get his
hands on; the helpful lady in the Reference
Room of the main library who is never without
her dark glasses and visor; the Shavian emer
itus professor, well along in years, who works
out in the gym; the inter-departmental mail
: carrier; the little man who rakes the leaves
• around Madrono and Hawthorne. If you aren't
acquainted with these people, you ought to be. :
; They are more a part of the Stanford Family
than you and I will ever be.
These people and the things Stanford stu
dents do that no other students do—like 10
o'clock breakfast in the Cellar and checking
the P.O.—are what we should cultivate while
we are getting acquainted with our fellow stu- (
dents. In the process we might even feel that
we are part of Stanford.

It's now close enough to the end of the quar
; ter that I can ask a question I have not had the
fortitude to bring up before, i.e., "Why don't
| they remove the shades from the lights in the
Libe?" Due to a vitamin A deficiency I am
subject to night blindness and have great diffi
-1 culty getting through the Reference Room with
out stumbling over the Encyclopedia Britannica.
And while we're asking questions, maybe
1 someone could tell us where this guy Monohan
J hangs out.
