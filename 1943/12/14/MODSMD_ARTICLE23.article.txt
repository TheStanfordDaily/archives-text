Black Tin
To the Editor:
CERTAIN patriotic individuals have won
dered perhaps why the salvage committee did
not do something about the large heap of scrap i
metal that seems to have accumulated in the
vacant lot south of the ROTC stables. The fact,
however, remains that this scrap metal is black
tin which the government does not want. When
i summoned, the salvage collector for Palo Alto
I informed us that this type of metal is of no
value whatsoever. So those enthusiastic indi- j
viduals who have been lying awake nights
| worrying about this little item can get a good !
night's sleep.
Salvage Committee.
