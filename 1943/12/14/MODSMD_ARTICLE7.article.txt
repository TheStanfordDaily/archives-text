# Tower Music Will Be Played Christmas Eve
## 
### 
The spirit of Christmas Eve will ;
! be heralded by the first musical notes
of a brass concert coming from the
' Hoover War Library tower at 5 p.m. I
| Dec. 24. Pfc. Ed Carpenter, con- |
! ductor of the Stanford band, will
: direct the choir of light brass instru
| ments for melodic quarter-hour ses-
I sions beginning at 5 and at midnight j
after the Christmas service in Me
| morial Church.
The program will be significant of
i the international studies now at the
| University, for it will be composed
j of carols and Christmas hymns of
different nations. The dignified tones !
of a German chorale which are par- ;
ticularly beautiful when sustained
by a brass choir,, will introduce (
music of a lighter nature. The mer- j
riment of a French carol will repre- i
sent the joyous spirit of French cele- j
brations of the Noel.
Brass Concert
The brass concert will be presented
by eight instruments: two trumpets,
two French horns, one baritone, two
trombones, and one bass. Herbert
Jan Popper, assistant professor of
music, is advising the choir in the
arrangements o fthe various carols
| and hymns.
Between the two concerts from the :
i top of the tower, the Christmas Eve j
program planned by an all-campus ,
committee headed by Dr. D. Elton
: Trueblood will be carried out. Open
I houses will be given by Lagunita, !
Union Residence, perhaps two so- i
1 rorities, and jointly by all the mens (
! living groups on the Row.
Cider and Doughnuts
At 10 p.m. students, faculty, and
i friends of the University will gather j
'in the Union patio for cider and |
doughnuts, after which everyone will
i join in caroling around the lighted j
Stanford Christmas tree before Me- j
; morial Church in the torch-lit Inner
Quad. The midnight service will be
| gin with a procession of civilian and
military students into the lower part
of Memorial Church, where the fac- 1
ulty and Palo Alto friends of the
University will join the service from ;
| the balconies.
Candles will light the church for !
â€¢ special Christmas music, the reading :
1 of the Christmas story, and a special j
] reading by Dr. Lee Emerson Bassett, I
! emeritus professor of speech and ;
1 drama.
At midnight, the Christmas Eve
events will be completed with the
final melodies from the brass choir
' in the library tower.
