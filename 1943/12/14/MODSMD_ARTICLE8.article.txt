# Stage Crew Plans Elaborate Set for 'Wuthering Heights'
## 
### 
The moors of "Wuthering Heights" and "Jane Eyre" will be brought to
| life in the story of the women who created them to be enacted at 8:1 c
' Thursday, Friday, and Saturday in the Memorial Auditorium.
"Moor Born," by Dan Totheroh, a dramatic biography of the Bronte
I sisters—Emily, Charlotte, and Anne—is the second presentation of the

I Stanford Players this season. Tickets
! at 85 cents may be obtained in the
j drama department.
Under the technical direction of
John Ford Sollers, the most elab
orate set attempted this year will
catch a 19th century atmosphere.
j Unusual Set
It is unusual in that it is divided
into three parts, a living room com
plete with somber striped wallpaper,
samplers, and period pieces, a hall,
i and an outside view of the moors
; showing far in the deep mist a near
; by graveyard.
Everything in the setting has been
: as carefully studied for perfection
and authenticity of detail as have
j the lines of the play itself. Only a
I few small architectural changes have
I been made where it has been im
! possible to reproduce the original.
Because of the manpower shortage
the members of the drama depart
ment faculty have helped on the
stage crews during their free hours.
Portrait Copied
A portrait of Peggy Fitts as Emily,
Gloria Olivi as Charlotte, and Mar
garet Morgan as Anne has been done
as a "reasonable facsimile" of the
portrait done of the Brontes by their
brother. A likeness of the three
actresses has been superimposed on
a likeness of the original famous
: sisters.
Skipwith Athey is in charge of the
lighting effects, assisted by Duane
j Heath. Fluid lighting will be used
j wherein the brilliance softens or
rises as the people move around.
1 F. Cowles Strickland will direct
the play in which Lionel Walford.
Herbert Rubin, Jean Robinson, and
I Betty Wattenberger will also appear.
