The big news around lately seems
to be concerned with the Pacific
Coast Conference meeting taking
place in San Francisco. Representing
the Farm at the meeting are Profes
sor Mitchell, Graduate Manager A 1
Masters, and Football Coach Marchy
Schwartz. Mitchell is taking the
place of Professor Owens who is now
in the hospital. Owens has repre
sented Stanford in the conference
for numerous years and was twice
elected president of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Talk at the meeting seems to be
centered about football plans for
next fall, which at the moment seem
to be very much up in the air. Many
of the northern schools who gave
football up this season will probably
compete this next season. It wasn't
necessarily the lack of material that
caused the throwing in of the towel;
the reason was the fear of poor gate
receipts. The fear has been elim
inated and the universities will take
up the sport in the autumn.
All this of course brings Us to
the question of whether Stanford
will resume action along with the
other conference teams. It is our
opinion that under no circumstances
whatsoever will Stanford resume
football until the close of the war
and the ASTP students leave the
campus. Of course, if the War De
partment should change its mind and
allow the students to compete, we
will have sports, but that is un
likely to happen.
From what we have heard by in
quiring and by snooping around in
city newspapers, we have figured out
that it is the University's policy dur
ing wartime not to have intercol
legiate sports. Dr. Wilbur has said
that intercollegiate sports as far as
Stanford was concerned is a "war
time casualty." The University
seems to have taken its cue from
those words.
As Bill Leiser pointed out in yes
terday morning's Chronicle, the con
tests will be more even next season
than last season, for the different
football stars now in Navy training
schools will have finished their
training by football season next year,
and therefore schools like St. Mary's
will have a better chance against
such schools as Cal. With this in
mind, such bay area schools as
Santa Clara, San Jose State, and
Fresno State may decide to field
teams.
We have also read much comment
connected with Emmet Cashin's
swimming records made last spring.
It seems that the records went up
for approval about a week ago be
fore the records committee of the
AAU. That committee refused to
allow the records on the ground of an
illegal kick Cashin supposedly uses.
It stands to reason that if he can use
that kick in meets and have it ac
cepted as legal, the records com
mittee should accept his time made
when using his leg action as he does.

and therefore schools like St. Mary's
will have a better chance against
such schools as Cal. With this in
mind, such bay area schools as
Santa Clara, San Jose State, and
Fresno State may decide to field
teams.
We have also read much comment
connected with Emmet Cashin's
swimming records made last spring.
It seems that the records went up
for approval about a week ago be
fore the records committee of the
AAU. That committee refused to
allow the records on the ground of an
illegal kick Cashin supposedly uses.
It stands to reason that if he can use
that kick in meets and have it ac
cepted as legal, the records com
mittee should accept his time made
when using his leg action as he does.
The big news around lately seems
to be concerned with the Pacific
Coast Conference meeting taking
place in San Francisco. Representing
the Farm at the meeting are Profes
sor Mitchell, Graduate Manager A 1
Masters, and Football Coach Marchy
Schwartz. Mitchell is taking the
place of Professor Owens who is now
in the hospital. Owens has repre
sented Stanford in the conference
for numerous years and was twice
elected president of the National
Collegiate Athletic Association.
Talk at the meeting seems to be
centered about football plans for
next fall, which at the moment seem
to be very much up in the air. Many
of the northern schools who gave
football up this season will probably
compete this next season. It wasn't
necessarily the lack of material that
caused the throwing in of the towel;
the reason was the fear of poor gate
receipts. The fear has been elim
inated and the universities will take
up the sport in the autumn.
All this of course brings Us to
the question of whether Stanford
will resume action along with the
other conference teams. It is our
opinion that under no circumstances
whatsoever will Stanford resume
football until the close of the war
and the ASTP students leave the
campus. Of course, if the War De
partment should change its mind and
allow the students to compete, we
will have sports, but that is un
likely to happen.
From what we have heard by in
quiring and by snooping around in
city newspapers, we have figured out
that it is the University's policy dur
ing wartime not to have intercol
legiate sports. Dr. Wilbur has said
that intercollegiate sports as far as
Stanford was concerned is a "war
time casualty." The University
seems to have taken its cue from
those words.
As Bill Leiser pointed out in yes
terday morning's Chronicle, the con
tests will be more even next season
than last season, for the different
football stars now in Navy training
schools will have finished their
training by football season next year,
and therefore schools like St. Mary's
will have a better chance against
such schools as Cal. With this in

Santa Clara, San Jose State, and
