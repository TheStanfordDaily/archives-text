## 'Moor Born' Ready to Open; Authentic Props Are Used 
### 
As last rehearsals smooth out any
remaining rough spots and the cos
tuming department rushes to finish
the intricate 19th century costumes,
seven members of the Stanford Play
ers are preparing to present Don
Totheroh's "Moor Born" in the Me
morial Auditorium tomorrow night
at 8:15.
"Moor Born" is the story of the
Bronte sisters, famous writers of
many well-known novels. F. Cowles
Strickland is heading the cast of
Peggy Fitts, Gloria Olivi, Margaret
Morgan, Lionel Walford. Herbert
Rubin, Jean Robinson, and Betty
Wattenberger.
Miss Hester Proctor, in charge of
props, has found period pieces,
samplers, old pictures, an old English
cider pitcher with a hound dog
handle, and an old clock.
In response to a plea which she
put in the Palo Alto Times, eight
"lap desks" were obtained from Paly
and the campus. One of them was
owned by Mrs. Douglas Everett of
Macon who used it when she was in
school with Madame Chiang Kai-
Shek.
Heather from the campus grounds
will be contributed to lend an au
thentic air to the moors in the set
of the play.
Under the direction of Muriel
Lievsay, old costumes have been re
dved and remade for the cast.
Though it is known that the famous
sisters wore somber-hued gowns,
the colors have been lightened just
a little to help portray the color and

| brightness of their characters.
Long yards of white stock and a
| pair of real 19th century spectacles
' have been found for near-sighted
i Reverend Bronte.,
