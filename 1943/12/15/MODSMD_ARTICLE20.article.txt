# Christmas Carols Will Highlight Yuletide Festivities
## 
### 
Christmas caroling, always a be
loved tradition, will play an impor
tant part in the Christmas activities
this season here on the Stanford
Farm. Small groups of carolers are
planning to serenade the living
groups during the week, according (o
D. Sterling Wheelwright, who is in
charge of the caroling, and the cli
max will be the all-campus carol
service on Christmas Eve.
Leading the carol procession on
Christmas Eve will be the Stanford
Band. Everyone will start up the
Row, coming down to sing in front
of Union and finally gathering in
the Inner Quad around the lighted
Christmas tree. Ed Carpenter, band
director, hopes to have a 30-piece
band and is planning to do some con

i cert selections if time permits. This
! will be the band's last appearance
; this quarter.
Among the informal caroling
; groups will be 40 girls from Lagunita
J who will sing with an accordion ac
companiment by Patsy Wogan. Some
pre-medics in the AST are tuning up
I under Robert F. Schell, and 30 men
[ from Co. A will also sing with Pfc.
i Leslie Whitton as carol leader. Any
] caroling group may borrow books on
request at the Vestry at Memorial,
according to Dr. Wheelwright.
Everyone is invited to join in sing
i ing carols at the Christmas Bacca
) laureate service Dec. 26 at Memorial
; Church, and in the Christmas pro-
I gram td be given on Dec. 21 at Me-
I morial Theater.
