WRITING to the losing candidate is one of the most unpleasant
jobs the editor has. There is little to be said. It is im
possible not to recognize your ability and worth. We've worked
with you for a long time in the little green Shack. And if you
weren't one of the most outstanding journalists in the group, you
wouldn't have been a candidate in the election.
And because you are a fine person, one to be trusted with
responsibility and one who has a great background of experience
and understanding in publishing The Daily, you will be a suc
cessful managing editor.
True, the vast conglomeration of gripes and praises (now and
then) won't come directly to you. As managing editor you aren't
the one who captures the most glory. Yours is a hard and thank
less job. It may be tedious and it is never-ending. But you will
be an especially vital person, for it will be you who most directly
keeps the presses rolling and the paper coming out.
As you have been a good head copy editor, night editor, and
associate editor, so will you be a good managing editor. Rather
than offer any sort of would-be consolation, we heartily con
gratulate you on your new job. We're glad you're the one to
fill that important position.
