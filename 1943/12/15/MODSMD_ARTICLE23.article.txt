### BILL ROSE 
COMPLAINTE TO AN EMPTYE CHECKE BOKE
The other day I complained about the contingencies of war
time Christmas shopping. You will remember (if you read the
column) that my main gripe concerned the expense incurred.
The objection was particularly legitimate as far as it concerned
my personal financial status. And I do not believe I am alone
in this predicament.
It seems that at this time every year the economic status of
the students hits a new low. This is the time when all those
cleaning bills, library fines, house fees, and friendly debts come
rushing up at one like ogres out of Fantasia.
Besides this, the aforementioned press of Christmas shopping
weighs down on our heads, crushing the very life-blood out of us.
It is too late in the quarter to get a job. Writing home for
more scoot might prove a little awkward at this stage of the game.
Theft is outside (though not very far) our moral codes.
There seems no way out. We take an empty hypo needle and
insert it slowly into our most varicose vein. We smile in maso
chistic exultation. One small air bubble will do the trick.
Who says money isn't everything?

Crime again runs rampant across the livid yellow pages of
our local papers. This time it's no New York socialite or Bahaman
Count but a funny looking guy in San Francisco named Finkel.
It is not for me to say whether Finkel is guilty or innocent—
though I have my ideas on the subject. However, I do give him
(or whoever did it) credit for a fertile imagination. The use of
green gloves was a magnificent inspiration —far beyond the range
of the eeriest Hollywood scenarist.
I shrink when I think what would have happened had this
criminal directed his talents toward mystery writing instead of
(censored). Surely the murder story readers have been robbed
of many hours of gory delight.

I am getting a martyr complex over this organized campaign
to cob up my column. Needless to say, I was plenty pushed out
of shape upon picking up The Daily yesterday morning. I will
not attempt to tell you what that first paragraph said. It was dis
torted beyond redemption. Just consider yourselves deprived of
a few words of wisdom and take your wrath out 0:1 the laps.
What I want to know is, where's Monohan?
