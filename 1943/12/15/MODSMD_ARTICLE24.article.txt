A few tickets are still available for Yehudi Menuhin's concert next Mon
day night. Because of the large demand for seats, a section is to be opened
in the orchestra pit. Tickets for this section will sell at $2.20.
This concert, Mr. Menuhin's fourth appearance before Stanford's audi
ence, will present a number of well known compositions and will also

feature two first performances of
pieces by famous composers.
The* first number of the program
will be Beethoven's Sonata No. 1 in
D Major,, Opus 12. No. 1. It will be
followed by Concerto No. 4 in D
Major by Vieuxtemps, Opus 31. This
concerto is the fourth of six similar
compositions by the great Belgian
violinist. It demonstrates the com
poser's remarkable mastery of the
instrument.

Following the intermission the
artist will play Sonata No. 3 in A
Minor, Opus 25, by Georges Enesco.
Enesco is a distinguished Rumanian
composer and violinist, and a teacher
of Menuhin. His work is well known
in this country, especially his Ru
manian rhapsodies for orchestra
which are performed frequently.
Following this will be the first per
formance of '"Voiles" by Claude De
bussy. Another first performance
follows "Voiles." It is "Yemaya" by
Angel A. Reyes. The Reyes family
plays an important part in the musi
cal life of Cuba. Angel Reyes is a
violinist of merit in his homeland.
l 'A Lendo do Cabocle," by Villa
Lobos will follow. Lobos is Brazil's
most distinguished composer. His
greatest contribution to music has
been in choral work and in songs of
Brazilian folklore.
A Spanish dance by De Falla-
Kreisler and "Contigo do Ninar" by
Guernieri, a first performance, will
also add to the Spanish spirit of the
latter half of the program. The last
number will be Sarasate's "Ha
banera."
