# Series Lecture Tells of Orient
## 
### 
In the last program of the Autumn
j Quarter. Tuesday Evening Series,
! Miss Vanya Oakes spoke last night
j on the subject of "The Far East and
j the Future."
j Miss Oakes has traveled over 50,-
1000 miles in Asia in the past 10
j years as a correspondent for United
| Press, North American Newspaper
Alliance, and the Christian Science
Monitor. In doing so, she has gained
a wide knowledge of the Orient, as
she demonstrated in her lecture.
She maintained that our funda
mental mistake in dealing with Asia
has been that we don't really know
what the Asiatic people are like. For
example, we thing of the Chinese
nation as made up almost entirely
of coolies. According to Miss Oakes,
a new middle class has arisen in
China which is perhaps the most im
portant element in the nation. She
gave the very interesting history of
a Chinese family she knew as an
I illustration of the rise of this class.
The real disaster which fore
i shadowed the developments in the
j South Pacific occurred when the
j Japanese moved into Indo-China,
i Miss Oakes said. This paved the way
i for the surrounding of the Philip
! pines and the outflanking of the
1 Malay Peninsula and Singapore.
We also made a grave mistake in
| our attitude toward the Japanese
j people. We were inclined to consider
i them a "Gilbert and Sullivan oper-
I etta people" who were not to be
: taken seriously. They told us what
j they planned to do, but we did noth
! ing about it.
We must learn to understand the
people of Asia, Miss Oakes said, if
we are ever to achieve a lasting
peace at the conclusion of this war.
