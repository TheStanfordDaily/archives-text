# S.P. Announces Reservations Almost All Sold
## 
### Jim Weinberg 
With the end of finals only a week
and a half away, the perennial
problem of getting train reservations
is once again plaguing the hundreds
|of Stanford students who live in
southern California.
The outlook is not too bright, how
j ever, for those who have not ob-
I tained reservations yet. Almost all
I the trains which Stanford students
| would normally take are sold out.
j There are four passenger trains
, which run on the Southern Pacific
j between San Francisco and Los An
| geles. The best of these is the "Lark."
However, it is difficult for civilians
to get reservations on the "Lark" at
this time.
Space on "Coaster"
Things are not quite so bad on the
other night train, the "Coaster."
There are still a few reservations left
for most of the important dates.
No berths are left on the "Coaster"
j for Jan. 9, the date when most Stan
j lord students will be returning to
j school. An extra sleeper has been
requested for this date, according to
i the agent in the Palo Alto Southern
| Pacific station, but the request has
; not been granted as yet.
Few "Daylight" Seats
On the "Daylights," there are 35
seats left for Jan. 1, but these are all
reserved for military use. There is
still some space left for civilian use
| on the northbound "Daylights," Jan.
i 7 and 8.
There is also Train 71-72 (71
| northbound and 72 southbound),
j This train, were it not for the fact
that it costs just as much as the
"Daylight," might appropriately be
termed "The poor man's Daylight."
It leaves San Francisco at 1 p.m., and
arrives in Los Angeles at 6:35 the
following morning.
I "Milk Train"
The accommodations do not com-
I pare with those on the regular
"Daylight," and it stops at a great
percentage of the villages, towns,
and hamlets along the way in which
milk is produced. However, there are
still plenty of reservations left on
Train 71-72 for anyone who doesn't
mind riding a local train for 400
miles and 17 1 hours.
With so many soldiers riding the
trains, with the government ban on
running extra trains, and especially
with the holiday season at hand, it
has become exceedingly difficult for
civilians to obtain reservations for
train travel. The moral to this story
is: next time, if you must take the
train, make your reservations as far
in advance as possible.

, which run on the Southern Pacific
j between San Francisco and Los An
| geles. The best of these is the "Lark."
However, it is difficult for civilians
to get reservations on the "Lark" at
this time.
Space on "Coaster"
Things are not quite so bad on the
other night train, the "Coaster."
There are still a few reservations left
for most of the important dates.
No berths are left on the "Coaster"
j for Jan. 9, the date when most Stan
j lord students will be returning to
j school. An extra sleeper has been
requested for this date, according to
i the agent in the Palo Alto Southern
| Pacific station, but the request has
; not been granted as yet.
Few "Daylight" Seats
On the "Daylights," there are 35
seats left for Jan. 1, but these are all
reserved for military use. There is
still some space left for civilian use
| on the northbound "Daylights," Jan.
i 7 and 8.
There is also Train 71-72 (71
| northbound and 72 southbound),
j This train, were it not for the fact
that it costs just as much as the
"Daylight," might appropriately be
termed "The poor man's Daylight."
It leaves San Francisco at 1 p.m., and
arrives in Los Angeles at 6:35 the
following morning.
I "Milk Train"
The accommodations do not com-
I pare with those on the regular
"Daylight," and it stops at a great
percentage of the villages, towns,
and hamlets along the way in which
milk is produced. However, there are
still plenty of reservations left on
Train 71-72 for anyone who doesn't
mind riding a local train for 400
miles and 17 1 hours.
With so many soldiers riding the
trains, with the government ban on
running extra trains, and especially
with the holiday season at hand, it
has become exceedingly difficult for
civilians to obtain reservations for
train travel. The moral to this story
is: next time, if you must take the
train, make your reservations as far
in advance as possible.
With the end of finals only a week
and a half away, the perennial
problem of getting train reservations
is once again plaguing the hundreds
|of Stanford students who live in
southern California.
The outlook is not too bright, how
j ever, for those who have not ob-
I tained reservations yet. Almost all
I the trains which Stanford students
| would normally take are sold out.
j There are four passenger trains
, which run on the Southern Pacific
j between San Francisco and Los An
| geles. The best of these is the "Lark."
