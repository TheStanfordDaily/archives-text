# Molnar Joins S.F. Symphony
## 
### Barney Gugel 
Ferenc Molnar, professor of music 1
and mechanical engineering, will
take over the .position of leader of
the viola section of the San Francisco <
Symphony Orchestra for the re
mainder of the season, replacing the j
late Nathan Firestone.
Molnar was asked by Pierre Mon- |
teux. conductor of the San Francisco !
Symphony, to join the orchestra, ,
shortly after Mr. Firestone's death.
Stanford has tried to arrange Mol
nar's schedule so that he will be able
to take part in the 43 programs I
which the orchestra will present this i
season.
Molnar is now teaching mechanical
engineering as well as music, and
besides his duties at Stanford and
with the San Francisco Symphony, !
also plays viola in the San Francisco j
String Quartet.
Trained in Hungary
He received his musical training in
Hungary as a youth, but also studied ,
engineering as his lather was owner
ol a number of factories which he
was to take over some day. During
the revolutions after the World War.
the factories were destroyed, and
Molnar returned to a career in
music.
As a soloist and a member of the
Roth String Quartet, he performed in
nearly all the large cities in Europe
and North America. In 1939, he be
came a member of the Stanford fac
ulty as associate professor of music.
About a month after Pearl Harobr, j
Molnar wrote to Chancellor Wilbur
and offered to help out in the engi- |
neering department. He took over j
some of Professor Domonowski's
classes, and has been teaching engi- :
neering as well as music ever since.
Molnar stated, however, that he
didn't want people to get the idea
that he was giving up music and be- :
coming an engineer, but that he was
merely doing his part in helping out
the war effort.
