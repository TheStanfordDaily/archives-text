## Undefeated QM's Face LFA in Mural Football Title Tilt 
### Don Langendorf 
Led by "Bullet"' Bob Fair, the
Fightin' Q.M. will meet the LFA
army team for the intramural foot
ball championship of 1943 this after
noon at 5 in the Stadium.
LFA (Co. L, Field Artillery) was
slated to meet Co. C & A yesterday
afternoon, but neither team showed
up. Due to this unforeseen happen
ing, it was decided that LFA would
represent League B because of their
win in an early season contest over
C & A.
Although the quartermasters are
undefeated with only a tie to mar
their otherwise perfect record, the
contest should be extremely close
for LFA is sparked by many former
Stanford Varsity men. Mark Caffall,
who tosses a large majority of their
passes, is remembered for his playing
of last leason, mainly against South
ern California. Also playing for LFA
is Ait Shipkey, outstanding varsity
fullback of the 1942 Stanford varsity
squad.
But if Fair can hit his receivers as
well today as he has all season, the
quartermasters may very well walk
away with the game. If, on the other
hand, LFA can either rush fast or
present a strong pass defense, the
result may be another story. Fair
has also shown his ability as a run
ner. for in Tuesday's battle with Mc-
Kinley, he faked a pass and ran for

I a touchdown without a hand laid on
him.
Caffall, however, is not to be un
derrated as his pass throwing is on
j the spot just about every time. It
I looks as though the game will be a
I passing contest with the outfit offer
| ing the best aerial defense walking
off with the championship.
