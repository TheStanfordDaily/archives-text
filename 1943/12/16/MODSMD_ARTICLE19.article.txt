### Bob Fess 
Coming back powerfully in the
I third round, Tink Wooley smashed
j his way to victory over Jack Miller
in the heavyweight division of the
civilian novice boxing matches last
| night in the Pavilion. Miller took the
opening period by using to advantage
his lightning left hook. Wooley
started throwing strong punches in
j the second frame and had Miller on
1 the ropes. Miller kept his fast left
on Tink's ear, but Wooley stood up
under the punishment.
With his nose running red. Wooley
; smashed Jake unmercifully in the
third. Miller not in many telling
blows of his own, but Wooley put
j him on the ropes with a crushing
right. The judges split on the light,
I two going for Woley, and one for
Miller.
Middleweight
In a wild melee of flying mitts,
Aubrey Coldiron, substituting for
j Erwin Rosa, won a very close de
: cision over Rolf Westly. Coldiron
i kept his gloves pounding at Westly's
face, but he rarely hit him. Westly,
Monroe's mauler, did land some very
hard counter blows, and it looked
like the fight would go his way.
The winner went down in the sec
ond round after missing a round
: house right and getting tapped by
I Westly's lelt hook. Coldiron repeat-
I edly had Westly against the ropes,
but his shots went wild. On his re
! coveries, Rolf got in some hard
knocks to Coldiron's head. The
judges split on the decision, one call
| ing it a draw and two giving it to
! Coldiron.
Lightweight
Gil Reiss won a very close de
cision over Jimmy Chinn in the

) lightweight division. At the end of
| three rounds, the match was a draw,
j so an extra canto of one and one
hall' minutes was fought. Both boys
| were very tired, but Reiss outlasted
his opponent to take the nod. The
fighters both kept pounding away,
Chin with a devastating left jab, and
Reiss with powerful right uppercuts
and haymakers.
The bout opened fast, with Reiss
rushing Chinn into the ropes. The
shirt of each boxer was saturated
with blood at the end of the fight.
Reiss opened up Chinn's nose in the
first round, but Chinn soon coun
tered by pounding Reiss's face into
the consistency of a fresh steak.
Senior Welterweight
"Laughing Boy" Walton Brown
copped the senior welterweight
crown by outpointing Dick Stanton.
Brown kept a big grin on his face
most of the time ,though Stanton
didn't think it was very funny.
Practically all of his blows were
blocked by Walt, and he received a
terrific barrage of punches in re
turn.
Brown was much the better boxer,
having complete control at all times.
; Stanton did come back in the final
. round to land a few pokes, but he
never held the upper hand. Brown
| built up an overwhelming lead in
I the first two rounds with his beauti
ful blocks and counter punches. The
j last round went to the grinning lad
, from Los Angeles by a slight margin.
| and the judges' decision was unani
i mo us.
George Leong took the welter
weight fight from John Carr in a
slow battle. There was no doubt
about the decision. Leong got in
more punches, while Carr scored

only a few times and clinched fre
quently. The Chinese boy looked
confident from the start, and al
though Carr had him in a cornet
time alter time, Leong came back
with powerful blows which sent
Carr onto the defensive.
The opening round saw the two
boys ieeling each other out and
dishing nothing more than a few
preliminary love taps. In the second,
Leong started rolling and poured the
leather to Carr. Toward the end ot
the third round, Carr was jolted re
peatedly. but came back a little. The
judges decision was unanimous,
featherweight
In a fast battle marked by solid
blows and plenty of knockdowns,
Stan Hampton overpowered Normal*.
Wong to take the featherweight title.
Wong was constantly on the offen
sive, but Hampton ocuntered with
telling left jabs and jolting right
crosses. Hampton proved stronger
in the closing minutes and had Wong
under his control.
