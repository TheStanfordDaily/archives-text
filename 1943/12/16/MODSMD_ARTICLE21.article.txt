# Class of '44—Accelerated
## 
### 
[N TWO weeks about 100 students will gradu
ate from Stanford. For them there will be
no caps and gowns, no commencement serv
ices, no doting parents and relatives exuding
with pride and sentiment. There will be no
gala senior week, no class day ceremony or
dancing all night.
On Dec. 31 they will finish their last final,
pack belongings accumulated in their accel
erated four years, and leave.
They may think back to that Autumn Quar
ter in 1940, of freshman days in Roble and En
cina when undergraduate years at Stanford
stretched invitingly ahead. They will perhaps
find it hard to remember much before those
freshman days. Four years in college pretty
well fill the memory, and they seem one's whole
life.
They will remember the beginning of the
war—how it has gradually dwarfed other values,
how vitally it has affected the trend of college
life in these past four years.
They may recall the days when a whole
class graduated together and played and cele
brated together that special week in June. But
missing the condensed and intensive fun and
sadness in leaving won't be too important to
these graduates.
They are just about the first class to be af
fected as a whole by the war-time educational
system. They've gone to summer school and
taken extra units to finish their four years faster,
to obtain all the benefits of a liberal education
and still hasten to fill important places in a
world which needs both trained technicians
and educated minds.
Sometime in January they will receive a
small card signed by the registrar saying that
their application for graduation has been ap
proved by the Academic Council. And next
June they can return to receive a diploma with
the few remaining members of the class of '44.
It's questionable that many will return. Six
months out of college and a large percentage
of the class will be scattered, busy with other
interests.
Yes, these 100 graduates will miss the tradi
tional thrill of graduation. But they have
planned it knowingly with the realization that
now there are more important things than cere
mony and tradition. And they will stop and
think of all their friends in the original class of
'44 who will not only miss a graduation cere
mony, but won't be here to finish 12 quarters
of academic work. They will remember the
men who, in uniform, are scattered over the
world and with whom they shared freshman
and sophomore fun and friendship.
The feelings inside at leaving Stanford will
be the same as always, regardless of the cir
cumstances surrounding graduation. Thinking
back, the unpleasant things are obliterated. It's
already harder to recall the tired, futile all-night
sessions before finals than the excitement and

permanent value of sharing new experiences
with others.
And then there's the feeling that can't be
defined—like the time one walks across Inner
Quad and suddenly realizes it might be the
last as a student—looks and sees things never
before notices, knowing they will soon be gone.

cumstances surrounding graduation. Thinking
back, the unpleasant things are obliterated. It's
already harder to recall the tired, futile all-night
sessions before finals than the excitement and

permanent value of sharing new experiences
with others.
And then there's the feeling that can't be
defined—like the time one walks across Inner
Quad and suddenly realizes it might be the
last as a student—looks and sees things never
before notices, knowing they will soon be gone.
[N TWO weeks about 100 students will gradu
ate from Stanford. For them there will be
no caps and gowns, no commencement serv
ices, no doting parents and relatives exuding
with pride and sentiment. There will be no
gala senior week, no class day ceremony or
dancing all night.
On Dec. 31 they will finish their last final,
pack belongings accumulated in their accel
erated four years, and leave.
They may think back to that Autumn Quar
ter in 1940, of freshman days in Roble and En
cina when undergraduate years at Stanford
stretched invitingly ahead. They will perhaps
find it hard to remember much before those
freshman days. Four years in college pretty
well fill the memory, and they seem one's whole
life.
They will remember the beginning of the
war—how it has gradually dwarfed other values,
how vitally it has affected the trend of college
life in these past four years.
They may recall the days when a whole
class graduated together and played and cele
brated together that special week in June. But
missing the condensed and intensive fun and
sadness in leaving won't be too important to
these graduates.
They are just about the first class to be af
fected as a whole by the war-time educational
system. They've gone to summer school and
taken extra units to finish their four years faster,
to obtain all the benefits of a liberal education
and still hasten to fill important places in a
world which needs both trained technicians
and educated minds.
Sometime in January they will receive a
small card signed by the registrar saying that
their application for graduation has been ap
proved by the Academic Council. And next
June they can return to receive a diploma with
the few remaining members of the class of '44.
It's questionable that many will return. Six
months out of college and a large percentage
of the class will be scattered, busy with other
interests.
Yes, these 100 graduates will miss the tradi
tional thrill of graduation. But they have
planned it knowingly with the realization that
now there are more important things than cere
mony and tradition. And they will stop and
think of all their friends in the original class of
'44 who will not only miss a graduation cere
mony, but won't be here to finish 12 quarters
of academic work. They will remember the
men who, in uniform, are scattered over the
world and with whom they shared freshman
and sophomore fun and friendship.
The feelings inside at leaving Stanford will
be the same as always, regardless of the cir
cumstances surrounding graduation. Thinking
back, the unpleasant things are obliterated. It's
already harder to recall the tired, futile all-night
sessions before finals than the excitement and
