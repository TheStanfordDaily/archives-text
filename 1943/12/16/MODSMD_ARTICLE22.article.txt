THE end of a quarter necessarily means peo
ple leaving high campus offices with new
electees and appointees taking their places.
Oftimes these people just graduate and leave,
remembered only by a few who watch many
campus officers come and go.
Once in a while there comes a person who
cannot easily be forgotten, one who is remem
bered not only as an outstanding individual,
but also for material contributions to Stanford.
Such a person is the retiring student body
president, Janet McClanahan. As the first
woman to head Stanford student government,
Janet took over the office at a critical time. It
would have been enough to expect her to keep
student government alive. She has done not
only that, she has improved and added to it in
many ways. Overcoming untold handicaps,
Janet has done a fine piece of work.
