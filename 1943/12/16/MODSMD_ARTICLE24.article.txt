SANTA CLAUS IS COMING TO STANFQRD
The prospect of spending Christmas on the
Farm is a new one for most of us. At the begin
ning of the Quarter many of us felt we were
being unnecessarily deprived of a tradition
hallowed, morale-building celebration. We
could see no real reason why we should be
kept around here during the holidays—ASTP
or no ASTP. We might even have been a little
angry.
But as things are shaping up, it looks as if
we might not be so bad off after all. Being hu-;
man beings we have adjusted ourselves to the
inevitable—with remarkable willingness and
dexterity. According to yesterday's Daily,'
there will be five open houses on Christmas,
which will be followed by caroling and a spe
cial service in the Chapel.
The halls and houses are making individual 1
plans for Christmas dinners, and in the after
noon, Dr. and Mrs. Tresidder will be at home
from 3:30 to 5:30.
This sounds like a pretty full program, com
ing as it does the weekend before finals. But,
it should prove a very acceptable substitute!
for Christmas at home. The Christmas com
mittee deserves much credit for their efforts.;
They have greatly helped in filling the gap
left by spending the holidays away from home.
Perhaps we won't be so down-in-the-mouth as 1
we thought when we go into our first final I
Tuesday morning.

Rumor has it that there is a flu epidemic
sweeping the campus. This is, of course, a,
very inopportune time to be sick. In fact stu- j
dents have no business coming down with
something the last week of the quarter. In |
sympathy, we offer the suffering victims these j
words of consolation (through the courtesy o! \
the ASTP): Things are tough all over.
