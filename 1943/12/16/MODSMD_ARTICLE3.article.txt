LONDON, Dec. 15.â€”Soviet forces,
Again wresting the initiative from

the Germans in the battle of the Kiev
I salient, have captured several places
| south of Malin 58 miles northeast of
j the Ukraine capital, a Russian com
munique reported tonight.
German sources circulated a wel
ter of reports about new Soveit of
fensive thrusts, but Moscow opera
tional communiques concentrated on
the Kiev salient, the Cherkassy sec
tor 100 miles southeast of Kiev along
the Dnieper, and the Red Army's
flanking drive toward the Ukraine
industrial center of Kirovograd.
Within the bulge extending west
ward from Kiev where Field Mar
shall Fritz Erich von Mannstein
massed tanks and infantry Tuesday
and forced Gen. Nicolai F. Vatutin's
First Ukraine Army to abandon the
strategic road center of Radomisl,
the Soviets bounced back today to
drive the enemy from several places
south of Malin, none of which was
identified by the Russian communi
ques.
