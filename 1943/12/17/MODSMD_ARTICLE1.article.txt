# Nazi Bombers Sink 17 Vessels; Jap-Held New Britain Invaded

WASHINGTON, Dec. IG.â€”German bombers catching Allied defenders
of the Italian Adriatic port of Bari unprepared on Dec. 2, sank 17 Allied
ships and inflicted 1,000 casualties, it was disclosed today.
One official source said German bombs, plus the explosion of two ammu
ition dumps damaged many more United Nations vessels.

It was the worst Allied disaster of
its kind since Pearl Harbor.
Most, if not all, of the ships lost in
the Bari debacle were understood to
have been merchantmen, although
the Germans claim to have heavily
damaged a medium-sized warship.
It was announced officially that
most of the cargoes had been dis
charged prior to the attack and the
loss of supplies was accordingly not
great.
Bari Ls the main supply center for
the British Eighth Army, which is
fighting its way up the east coast ot
Italy. It lies directly across the
Adriatic from Yugoslavia and Al
bania and conceivably could be the
nerve center for an Allied invasion
of the Balkans.
Despite its vital importance it was
divulged that the Allies had no air
coverage when 35 to 40 German
bombers struck.
The Washington Daily News
quoted one report that Allied de
fenders were unable to bag a single
German plane. A German com
munique admitted two planes lost.
