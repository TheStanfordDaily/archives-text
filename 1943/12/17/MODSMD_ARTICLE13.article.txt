# A.S.T.P. Student Finds U.S. Still Land of Opportunity

"There are many more opportuni
ties here in the United States than in
Europe for young people who are
willing' to work and go ahead."
This, according to Edmond Zudok,
summarizes the situation in his na
tive country, France, and more gen
erally in Europe as a whole.
Zadok, who spent most of his life
in Paris, came to this country last
July, 1942, and stayed with some rel
atives in Milwaukee. There he
learned English in night school, and
worked during the day. Six months
ago he enlisted in the Army and,
after some infantry training, was put
in the ASTP, 9-L, because, as he
said, "French is my language. I
know it better than English."
According to Zadok, one of the
things that surprised and pleased
him most when he arrived here was
the warm and gracious welcome
given by the Americans he met,
'Just as if I had been a citizen."
In speaking of the pre-war condi
tions in this country, Zadok said
that there was not a great difference
between the U.S. and France, par
ticularly as far as ideals. lie seemed
to agree with previous comments

made about Europe in that the stand
ard of living is higher here than in
any place on the Continent. Zadok
made the comment that, "This coun
try is new, less than 200 years old,
and everything is modern. To afford
the equivalent type of living in
France would be much more ex
pensive."
Zadok's comparison of college here
and in Europe coincided with that
formerly made about Austria and
the central countries. Thus, while
the subjects are the same, French
students do not specialize in a par
ticular subject, but are required to
carry on their education in other
programs as well.
One of the differences which Zadok
liked about American colleges was
that students have a chance to work
and study both, "a thing almost im
possible in France since the students
do not have time enough left from
their studies, and it is not according
to custom."
Another way in which both French
and central European colleges differ
from those in the U.S. is in the
greater percentage attending school
here. In Europe, college studies are
reserved for the wealthy.

and study both, "a thing almost im
possible in France since the students
do not have time enough left from
their studies, and it is not according
to custom."
Another way in which both French
and central European colleges differ
from those in the U.S. is in the
greater percentage attending school
here. In Europe, college studies are
reserved for the wealthy.

"There are many more opportuni
ties here in the United States than in
Europe for young people who are
willing' to work and go ahead."
This, according to Edmond Zudok,
summarizes the situation in his na
tive country, France, and more gen
erally in Europe as a whole.
Zadok, who spent most of his life
in Paris, came to this country last
July, 1942, and stayed with some rel
atives in Milwaukee. There he
learned English in night school, and
worked during the day. Six months
ago he enlisted in the Army and,
after some infantry training, was put
in the ASTP, 9-L, because, as he
said, "French is my language. I
know it better than English."
According to Zadok, one of the
things that surprised and pleased
him most when he arrived here was
the warm and gracious welcome
given by the Americans he met,
'Just as if I had been a citizen."
In speaking of the pre-war condi
tions in this country, Zadok said
that there was not a great difference
between the U.S. and France, par
ticularly as far as ideals. lie seemed
to agree with previous comments

made about Europe in that the stand
ard of living is higher here than in
any place on the Continent. Zadok
made the comment that, "This coun
try is new, less than 200 years old,
and everything is modern. To afford
the equivalent type of living in
France would be much more ex
pensive."
Zadok's comparison of college here
and in Europe coincided with that
formerly made about Austria and
the central countries. Thus, while
the subjects are the same, French
students do not specialize in a par
ticular subject, but are required to
carry on their education in other
programs as well.
One of the differences which Zadok
liked about American colleges was
that students have a chance to work
and study both, "a thing almost im
possible in France since the students
