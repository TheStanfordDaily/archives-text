# Excom Hears Plan For Barbecue Pit
## 
### 
Excom Wednesday night received
the proposal to build a barbeque pit
on the knoll beside the boathouse
and has asked that suggestions and
arguments pro and con be considered
by the students and presented to
them at their meeting next Tuesday.
As the plans stand now, Cai'dinals
will raise the money to pay for the
construction and equipment through
Reg dances as was done to pay off
the Boathouse debt. One estimate
has been received but others will be
requested as building can not start
until after the rainy season. It is
hoped that the pit will be ready to
use by next May, Janet McClanahan,
ASSU president, announced.
The main purpose of the barbecue
pit is to provide organizations such
as classes and clubs a place on cam
pus in which to give parties and get
togethers. It has also been planned
to build a large work table on which
to prepare food beside the fireplace
and grill.
