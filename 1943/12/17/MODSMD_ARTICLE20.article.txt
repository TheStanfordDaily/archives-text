# Chappie To Hit Campus Thursday
## 
### Henrietta Nussbaum 
Next Thursday, the long awaited
Chaparral will come bounding into
view over the horizon. Not to be
outdone by other college magazines,
Chaparral has patriotically restricted
itself to one issue per quarter, thus
effecting an enormous saving in
paper and general wear and tear on
type metal.
Your reporter daringly entered the

lair of the Old Boy to bring you these
pertinent facts.
The new Chaparral, bigger and
better than the Dec. 1918 issue, bid.>-
fair to overcome all opposition to an
anti-free press campaign, tapping
numerous new sources of talentâ€”
Gugel, Rubenstein, Keith, and
Struthers, and also brings to you
several soldier artists, Elliott, Dun
barr, and Van Tubergen.
