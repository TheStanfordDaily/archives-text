Ychudi Menuhin will present his fourth Stanford concert Monday eve
ning at 8:15 in Memorial Hall. latest check with the Concert Series office
shows a few $2.20 scats still available at odd places, and also in a special
section on a platform in the orchestra pit.
Recently returned from a tour of South America. Menuhin's program for

Monday is strongly Latin American.
It is to feature four first perform
ances, including a composition of
Debussy and one of Villa Lobos.
The program will open with Bee
thoven's First Sonata, in D major,
opus 12 No. 1; this will be followed
by Vieuxtemps' Fourth Concerto;
and the third selection will be the
Third Sonata of Enesco, Menuhin's
old teacher.
Menuhin is one of the half dozen
great living violinists. Though not
possessing the tone of Elman, the
technique of Heifetz, or the charm
of Kreisler, he plays with a vitality
which none of the others matches.
Also, as is well known, he was one
of the most lionized child prodigies
in history, and incidentally made his
debut with the San Francisco Sym
phony, at the age of 7.
