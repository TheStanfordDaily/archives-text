# Two Book Drives Slated for Future
## 
### 
Two more collections will be made
this year for Victory Books. To date
the drive has netted 719 books and
magazines, which, although 31 be
low the goal set at the beginning of
the year, represents the cooperation
of all but five of the living groups of
the campus.
The two concluding collections will
be undertaken today, and on Mon
day, Dec. 20. In hopes of collecting
more books, a collection box will be
placed on Engineering Corner. There
are already boxes in the Library,
Union, and all the living group resi
dences. It is hoped by the Victory
Book Committee that the 1.000-mark
be reached before the end of the
term.
