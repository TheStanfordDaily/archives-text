# Holiday Mail Sets Record
## 
### Beth MacVicar 
Students who have waited their
turn in the huge lines before the
stamp window will not be surprised
to learn that the volume of mail that
has thus far been sent out from the
post office constituted the largest
Christmas mail in Stanford's history.
According to postmaster Ralph W.
Evans, Monday's mail contained
14,000 out-going letters and 6,000
packages by first class mail. The
amount is expected to increase even
more during the latter part of the
week. As yet, the volume of incom
ing mail is only slightly above nor
mal, but a great increase is expected
next week, according to Mr. Evans.
Mr. Evans also said the amount of
mail being handled is breaking rec
ords throughout the country, but
that with the army's demands on
transportation, the delivery facili
ties are greatly limited. Packages
going east of the Mississippi should
have been mailed by December 10,
in order to guarantee delivery by
Christmas. However, packages are
still being accepted for these eastern
destinations in the hope that they
will be delivered in time.
For the convenience of late shop
pers, the post office windows will be
open until 6 o'clock this Saturday.
The lobby will close at the usual
time of 7 p.m. on week-days and 2
o'clock on Sunday throughout the
Christmas season.
According to the postal regulations,
breakables should be packed in
double corrugated fibre board, or in
wooden boxes, and well padded and
wrapped to prevent breaking. The

longer the distance a package is go- should bo, to allow for excessive hai
ing, the morf secure the wrapping dling.
