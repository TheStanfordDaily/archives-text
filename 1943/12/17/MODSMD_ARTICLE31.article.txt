# SIDELINE SLANTS...
## 
### Don Langendorf 
Well, this is it, the last issue of the
quarter, the farewell and goodbye
of one Don Langendorf as Sports
Editor of Volume 104 Stanford Daily.
This is my final Slants of my civilian
life.
Between 1932, the year Slants was
first used, and 1943, Slants has viewed
Stanford teams in action throughout
the country. This quarter with the
abolishment of intercollegiate activi
ties at Stanford, Slants has had to be
contented with mural sports, the
novice boxing tournament, and the
trek to Berkeley for the Cal-UCLA
game.
Slants recalls from last month the
great thrill in sitting in the Stanford
rooting section at Memorial Stadium
in Berkeley for the game between the
Bruins and the Bears.
The next time you read Slants, the
by-line will probably be that of
either Jim Weinberg or Rog Corman,
for those two will be in charge of
the section the next two quarters.
Rog Corman has been more or less
my right-hand man for the last ten
weeks, writing most of the murals
and putting out the paper every
Monday. Rog, you did a fine job and
1 really appreciate the trouble and
time you spent over at the Shack.
Jim Weinberg has written some
good mural stories this past quarter
which warrant mention. Jim, I hope
you do a good job next quarter,
knowing in my mind that you will.
Those two will take over the many
traditions connected with the sports
staff, chief of which is demanding
more space from the night editor. I
hope they have more luck in their
demands than I did.
Td like to thank Barney Gugel for
writing Slants every Friday and for
the generous help he extended to me
on Sports. Ed Luce, former sports
editor, deserves loads of thanks as
well for his many swell suggestions
and advice.
Joe Hawkins was very dependable
around the Shack in writing soccer
and keeping the interest going for
awhile on men's volleyball.
For the first time in many quar
ters, we've had women covering some
sports. Women's volleyball was fi
nally given some recognition in the
well written stories of Barbara Bur
roughs. For all those who were won
dering who was writing those un
signed articles, credit goes to Bar
bara. The coverage was swell, Bar
bara.
Last, but not least, we come to
mixed doubles which were done ably
by both Helen Dietz and Mellon
Shelton. Both these women did swell
jobs.
Well, that ends it, my last Slants.
Everybody treated me swell as sports
editor, and if Jim and Rog have half
the fun and encouragement as I re
ceived, I know that you'll have a
marvellous section for the next two
quarters.
