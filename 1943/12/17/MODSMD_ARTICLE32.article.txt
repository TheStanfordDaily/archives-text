The Soccer League was started
about six weeks ago through the ef
forts of Pfc. Otto Brand and Harry
Maloney, director of minor sports.
Maloney has been coaching the Stan
ford Varsity throughout the entirety
of the abbreviated season.
The league met and overcame the
numerous difficulties which came up
during the season. At first the scant
signups almost made a full schedule
impossible. Then there was diffi
culty concerning equipment, for it
seemed that the soldiers were not
going to be able to use University
equipment, however, these difficul
ties were overcome.
From the beginning the Stars and
the Varsity were the only teams
which had organization and power,
which have been evident in their
numerous victories.
