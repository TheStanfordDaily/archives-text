## 1943 FOOTBALL SEASON Former Stanford Gridsters Help Make Season a Success 
### Frank Creede 
Throughout the past football season, Stani'ordites have seen the names of
their past gridiron greats in the rosters of both civilian and service teams
all over the nation. Even though Stanford was unable to field a team this
season it donated its share to the success of intercollegiate football.
We gave Bill Joslyn, who was the nucleus of Cal's 1943 backfield. We

also gave Bob Frisbee who distin
guished himself in the latter part of
the season, and in addition Bill Cox,
Fred Boench, Bill Hadjen, and Dick
Madigan to the Bears' eleven.
Pettit Plays for Navy
Navy was able to beat Army large
ly through the running, passing, and
blocking of Stanford's Jim Pettit.
Pettit w;is the star of our 1941 Fresh
man team. In that year he went to
Annapolis and in this year's game he
scored one of the telling touchdowns
for Navy.
UCLA might have been even
worse than it was, were it not for the
efforts of Stanford's Bobby Andrews
and Dave Brown. Bobby was Ray
Hammett's understudy as quarter
back for last year's '"Model T." Dave
Brown was responsible for putting
UCLA in front of USC 13-6 in the
second struggle of these teams, by
intercepting a pass in UCLA terri
tory and running 80 yards to a
touchdown.
Stanford's Ted Ken field was on
campus up to this quarter, but this
season played quarterback for the
University of Nebraska's team.
March Field End
Hank Norberg, a wingman of last
year's eleven, is playing first-string
end for March Field. The record of
March Field tells what kind of work
Hank is doing. Norm Standlee, along
with Frankie Albert, Pete Kmetovic,
and Hugh Gallerneau form a back
field combination which ranks in
immortality with the "Four Horse
men" and the vow boys. Norm
played this season as fullback for
Camp Davis. He is making the same
name for himself in service football
as he made for Stanford in 1940. He
has averaged more than BU>8 U > yards
per try in 39 ball-carrying assign
ments.
