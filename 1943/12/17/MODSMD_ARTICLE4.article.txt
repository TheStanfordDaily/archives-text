# MOOR BORN
## Action Is Weak In Bronte Play 
### 
Beginning a three-night run last
night, "Moor Born," by Dan Toth
eroh. depicting the life of the Bronte
sisters, revealsd a technically weak
performance with too little sugges
tion of action throughout.
For a play so full of emotional tips
and downs the three leading ac
tresses, Peggy Fitts, Gloria Olivi. and
Margaret Morgan were tackling a
iob which required the skill of full-
Hedged professionals.
Miss Morgan gave the best indi
vidual performance, though her
part was less difficult than those
portrayed by Miss Fitts and Miss
Olivi, who. as the more emotional
sisters, did their jobs well.
Herbert Rubin did his best acting
as a drunk rather than when he was
supposed to be sober. Lionel Walford
did a fair job. Duke Douglas, Jean
Robinson, and Betty Wattenberger
did well except for several breaks
from their characterizations and ac
cents.
The death scenes were impressive,
particularly that of Emily, which
was played with definite restraint.
The feeling of death and terror of the
moors were well carried out by the
setting of the moors, the churchyard
and the sound effects.
Suspense was built up for the judi
ence when they could see the move
ment of the actors within and with
out the Bronte home. The idea of
having the three sets at once on the
stage was instigated by Director F.
Cowles Strickland.
The play will be presented by the
Stanford Players in the Memorial
Auditorium again both tonight and
tomorrow night at 8:15. Tickets for
85 cents are obtainable at the box
office.â€”Stevens
