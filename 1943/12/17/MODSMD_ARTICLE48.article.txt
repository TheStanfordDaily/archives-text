# Dear Irma:
## 
### 
For many weeks now I've found myself
thinking of things I'd say in this last editorial,
ihis letter to you. Most of them are small and
"insignificant to the outsider who can't possibly
understand the feelings one acquires for The
Daily after four years, the personal, intimate
things that are hard to write yet easy to feel.
Leaving The Daily seems strange. It's good
to have printer's ink smeared on your hands, to
hear the pounding of typewriters and the noise
of a staff busy at work. Even feeling tired and
harried gives a certain sense of satisfaction, for
through it all you are accomplishing some
thing.
Once in a while it all seems : utile. One looks
at the prosperous eight-column paper of sev
eral quarters ago and can't help but compare it
to our poor, starving Tabby. One thinks of the
staff which once overflowed the dirty green
Shack and then looks at the few faithfuls v/ho
still carry on.
But the Tabby has been ours—mine, in a
sense. And now I give it to you. Necessity has
changed it to the struggling little "handbill,"
as the backshop "affectionately" calls it. But
It's still powerful, Irma, or it can be. And you
will be the controlling power. You can dictate
what some five thousand will read. You will
be the voice of the student body. You can
shape the minds of adolescents as you would
peel wormy apples with a tin-can lid. But re
member your power and use it wisely, dis
creetly.
As A 1 said to me, I will say to you. Your
voice will be five thousand times as loud as
the ordinary individual's, so don't shout.
Being editor of The Daily, you will find your
self on all sorts of committees. At first it will
be fun sitting in on meetings, feeling important.
But soon you will find committee life at Stan
ford dull and uninviting. The red-tape will bore
and disgust you, but don't let it get you down.
Make fun of it occasionally, laugh at it. Each
committee member has his own little axe to
grind. And each one will think it's the Stanford
axe. Each will take himself pretty seriously.
Ignore them. Keep yourself in the middle road.
Keep a true perspective, unbiased by little
groups who are chasing reform for some great
ideal they can't quite see.
This I can't emphasize too strongly, Irma.
Don't let yourself become narrow. There are a
lot of factions at Stanford. Each has merit in
its own right. Remember that and be fair to
all. Sure, follow up your own beliefs, BUT
only after you are sure you are right. Don't
overlook any side of a controversy. As editor,
you can't afford to be wrong. Always proceed
with caution.
Volume 104 has been severely criticized for
its editorial policy. It's been called weak and
ineffective and narrow in scope. But there was
a definite reason. I've felt this is no time to stir
up unwarranted controversy. Conditions now
are already disunified enough without The
Daily's adding to the confusion. It's a big
job to try and keep things rolling smoothly,
and it's one that never gets any credit. We
haven't reached above our scope. We haven't
delved into politics or commented on the war.
It's not our field. We've tried to bind Stanford
as it is closer together. We may have failed,
but it was a good try.
As editor you'll find little praise and lots of
gripes. That's to be expected. It's easy to pick
up the day's mail and read half a dozen bitter,
sarcastic complaints and feel The Daily isn't

worth it. But don't let chronic complainers get
you down, Irma. When no one complains, then
start worrying. At least you know the paper's
being read.
I can't leave without mentioning some of the
people to whom The Daily has meant as much
as it has to me. Lucy's been as good a man
aging editor as anyone could hope for. Jane
and Vashti v/ere the power behind the swivel
chair this summer, and I couldn't have gotten
along without them. And Steve and Peggy—
they've been constant standbys through four
years. Pat hasn't been here as long, but she's
proved her worth and has been a fine asso
ciate. There's no need to mention the rest of
the staff. They'll still be here, working with you.
And I can't leave out Lon and Mr. Jones in the
backshop. They bark and growl, but they've
got soft hearts underneath—pretty easy to find,
and they're all for The Daily.
So to you I leave The Daily and the tasks of
arguing with the business staff, appeasing the
soldier-students, tactfully bawling out the staff.
And of course I leave you the swivel chair, with
the admonition passed down from editor to
editor. It's tricky. Don't let it throw you.
It's your paper, Irma, and don't let anyone
take any part of it away from you. Keep free,
keep your jurisdiction. You can do a good job,
even if your bull-sessioner does make fun of
your last editorial. Good luck, Jane

Once in a while it all seems : utile. One looks
at the prosperous eight-column paper of sev
eral quarters ago and can't help but compare it
to our poor, starving Tabby. One thinks of the
staff which once overflowed the dirty green
Shack and then looks at the few faithfuls v/ho
still carry on.
But the Tabby has been ours—mine, in a
sense. And now I give it to you. Necessity has
changed it to the struggling little "handbill,"
as the backshop "affectionately" calls it. But
It's still powerful, Irma, or it can be. And you
will be the controlling power. You can dictate
what some five thousand will read. You will
be the voice of the student body. You can
shape the minds of adolescents as you would
peel wormy apples with a tin-can lid. But re
member your power and use it wisely, dis
creetly.
As A 1 said to me, I will say to you. Your
voice will be five thousand times as loud as
the ordinary individual's, so don't shout.
Being editor of The Daily, you will find your
self on all sorts of committees. At first it will
be fun sitting in on meetings, feeling important.
But soon you will find committee life at Stan
ford dull and uninviting. The red-tape will bore
and disgust you, but don't let it get you down.
Make fun of it occasionally, laugh at it. Each
committee member has his own little axe to
grind. And each one will think it's the Stanford
axe. Each will take himself pretty seriously.
Ignore them. Keep yourself in the middle road.
Keep a true perspective, unbiased by little
groups who are chasing reform for some great
ideal they can't quite see.
This I can't emphasize too strongly, Irma.
Don't let yourself become narrow. There are a
lot of factions at Stanford. Each has merit in
its own right. Remember that and be fair to
all. Sure, follow up your own beliefs, BUT
only after you are sure you are right. Don't
overlook any side of a controversy. As editor,
you can't afford to be wrong. Always proceed
with caution.
Volume 104 has been severely criticized for
its editorial policy. It's been called weak and
ineffective and narrow in scope. But there was
a definite reason. I've felt this is no time to stir
up unwarranted controversy. Conditions now
are already disunified enough without The
Daily's adding to the confusion. It's a big
job to try and keep things rolling smoothly,
and it's one that never gets any credit. We
haven't reached above our scope. We haven't
delved into politics or commented on the war.
It's not our field. We've tried to bind Stanford
as it is closer together. We may have failed,
but it was a good try.
As editor you'll find little praise and lots of
gripes. That's to be expected. It's easy to pick
up the day's mail and read half a dozen bitter,
sarcastic complaints and feel The Daily isn't

worth it. But don't let chronic complainers get
you down, Irma. When no one complains, then
start worrying. At least you know the paper's
being read.
I can't leave without mentioning some of the
people to whom The Daily has meant as much
as it has to me. Lucy's been as good a man
aging editor as anyone could hope for. Jane
and Vashti v/ere the power behind the swivel
chair this summer, and I couldn't have gotten
along without them. And Steve and Peggy—
they've been constant standbys through four
years. Pat hasn't been here as long, but she's
proved her worth and has been a fine asso
ciate. There's no need to mention the rest of
the staff. They'll still be here, working with you.
And I can't leave out Lon and Mr. Jones in the
backshop. They bark and growl, but they've
got soft hearts underneath—pretty easy to find,
and they're all for The Daily.
So to you I leave The Daily and the tasks of
arguing with the business staff, appeasing the
soldier-students, tactfully bawling out the staff.
And of course I leave you the swivel chair, with
the admonition passed down from editor to
editor. It's tricky. Don't let it throw you.
It's your paper, Irma, and don't let anyone
take any part of it away from you. Keep free,
keep your jurisdiction. You can do a good job,
even if your bull-sessioner does make fun of
your last editorial. Good luck, Jane
For many weeks now I've found myself
thinking of things I'd say in this last editorial,
ihis letter to you. Most of them are small and
"insignificant to the outsider who can't possibly
understand the feelings one acquires for The
Daily after four years, the personal, intimate
things that are hard to write yet easy to feel.
Leaving The Daily seems strange. It's good
to have printer's ink smeared on your hands, to
hear the pounding of typewriters and the noise
of a staff busy at work. Even feeling tired and
harried gives a certain sense of satisfaction, for
through it all you are accomplishing some
thing.

will be the controlling power. You can dictate
what some five thousand will read. You will
be the voice of the student body. You can
shape the minds of adolescents as you would
peel wormy apples with a tin-can lid. But re
member your power and use it wisely, dis
creetly.
As A 1 said to me, I will say to you. Your
voice will be five thousand times as loud as
the ordinary individual's, so don't shout.
Being editor of The Daily, you will find your
self on all sorts of committees. At first it will
be fun sitting in on meetings, feeling important.
But soon you will find committee life at Stan
ford dull and uninviting. The red-tape will bore
and disgust you, but don't let it get you down.
Make fun of it occasionally, laugh at it. Each
committee member has his own little axe to
grind. And each one will think it's the Stanford
axe. Each will take himself pretty seriously.
Ignore them. Keep yourself in the middle road.
Keep a true perspective, unbiased by little
groups who are chasing reform for some great
ideal they can't quite see.
This I can't emphasize too strongly, Irma.
Don't let yourself become narrow. There are a
lot of factions at Stanford. Each has merit in
its own right. Remember that and be fair to
all. Sure, follow up your own beliefs, BUT
only after you are sure you are right. Don't
overlook any side of a controversy. As editor,
you can't afford to be wrong. Always proceed
with caution.
Volume 104 has been severely criticized for
its editorial policy. It's been called weak and
ineffective and narrow in scope. But there was
a definite reason. I've felt this is no time to stir
up unwarranted controversy. Conditions now
are already disunified enough without The
Daily's adding to the confusion. It's a big
job to try and keep things rolling smoothly,
and it's one that never gets any credit. We
haven't reached above our scope. We haven't
delved into politics or commented on the war.
It's not our field. We've tried to bind Stanford
as it is closer together. We may have failed,
but it was a good try.
As editor you'll find little praise and lots of
gripes. That's to be expected. It's easy to pick
up the day's mail and read half a dozen bitter,
sarcastic complaints and feel The Daily isn't

worth it. But don't let chronic complainers get
you down, Irma. When no one complains, then
start worrying. At least you know the paper's
being read.
I can't leave without mentioning some of the
people to whom The Daily has meant as much
as it has to me. Lucy's been as good a man
aging editor as anyone could hope for. Jane
and Vashti v/ere the power behind the swivel
chair this summer, and I couldn't have gotten
along without them. And Steve and Peggy—
they've been constant standbys through four
years. Pat hasn't been here as long, but she's
proved her worth and has been a fine asso
ciate. There's no need to mention the rest of
the staff. They'll still be here, working with you.
And I can't leave out Lon and Mr. Jones in the
backshop. They bark and growl, but they've
got soft hearts underneath—pretty easy to find,
and they're all for The Daily.
So to you I leave The Daily and the tasks of
arguing with the business staff, appeasing the
soldier-students, tactfully bawling out the staff.
And of course I leave you the swivel chair, with
the admonition passed down from editor to
editor. It's tricky. Don't let it throw you.
It's your paper, Irma, and don't let anyone
take any part of it away from you. Keep free,
keep your jurisdiction. You can do a good job,
even if your bull-sessioner does make fun of
your last editorial. Good luck, Jane
For many weeks now I've found myself
thinking of things I'd say in this last editorial,
ihis letter to you. Most of them are small and
"insignificant to the outsider who can't possibly
understand the feelings one acquires for The
Daily after four years, the personal, intimate
things that are hard to write yet easy to feel.
Leaving The Daily seems strange. It's good
to have printer's ink smeared on your hands, to
hear the pounding of typewriters and the noise
of a staff busy at work. Even feeling tired and
harried gives a certain sense of satisfaction, for
through it all you are accomplishing some
thing.
Once in a while it all seems : utile. One looks
at the prosperous eight-column paper of sev
eral quarters ago and can't help but compare it
to our poor, starving Tabby. One thinks of the
staff which once overflowed the dirty green
Shack and then looks at the few faithfuls v/ho
still carry on.
But the Tabby has been ours—mine, in a
sense. And now I give it to you. Necessity has
changed it to the struggling little "handbill,"
as the backshop "affectionately" calls it. But
It's still powerful, Irma, or it can be. And you
will be the controlling power. You can dictate
what some five thousand will read. You will
