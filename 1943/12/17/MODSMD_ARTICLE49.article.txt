# Bull Session
## 
### BILL ROSE 
DEAR JEAN:
Farewells are always uncomfortable. They
are awkward too. Saying goodbye seems so
much more difficult than saying hello.
No doubt you have, at one time, gone to
see someone off on a train or boat—someone
whom you feel very close to. You have stood
on the platform exchanging small talk, never
quite having the guts to say what you felt inside
of you. The "all aboard," so long in coming,
is finally sounded. There is a hasty embrace,
and it's all over. You feel relieved, but you
are sad too. When there was so much to ex
press, you had expressed nothing. The oppor
tunity has come and gone and you have not
met it. But soon the sense of relief overpowers
that of regret. The finality of the occasion is
satisfying. You smile wistfully as you wave
your hand in a last gesture of farewell.
The analogy is obvious. Now it's your turn
to say hello. And there is so much, so very
much you can say. Jean. You can talk about
the noise in the libe and the attitude of the
co-eds and the Cellar coffee and all the other
things that make Stanford so fine and beautiful.
I like to think that you have a mission to
fulfill, Jean. A mission to carry on the great
tradition that is Bull Session—the tradition of the
three Mellinkoffs, John Cobbs, Chesley Sa
royan, and maybe even Bill Rose.
Yours is not an easy burden. There will be
deadlines to haunt you, censorship to nettle
you, and garbled copy to infuriate you. But
you must rise above these. You must bear your
burden like a true soldier. And you can do it,
Team Yes, you can do it.
And when it's all over, perhaps you too will
feel content. For Bull Session is fun, Jean, so
much fun, so very much fun. With the heart
breaks come laughs — deep, body-shaking
laughs, laughs that make you feel good inside.
You'll like writing Bull Session, Jean. I know
I did.
So make a good job of it. Remember: Yours
is not to reason why; yours is but to do or die,
Jean.
Now it's goodbye.
"Time is our tedious Song should here have
ending,
Heav'n's youngest teemed Star,
Hath fixed her polisht Car,
Her sleeping Lord with Handmaid Lamp at
tending:
And all about the Courtly Stable,
Bright-harnest Angels sit in order serviceable."

Farewells are always uncomfortable. They
are awkward too. Saying goodbye seems so
much more difficult than saying hello.
No doubt you have, at one time, gone to
see someone off on a train or boat—someone
whom you feel very close to. You have stood
on the platform exchanging small talk, never
quite having the guts to say what you felt inside
of you. The "all aboard," so long in coming,
is finally sounded. There is a hasty embrace,
and it's all over. You feel relieved, but you
are sad too. When there was so much to ex
press, you had expressed nothing. The oppor
tunity has come and gone and you have not
met it. But soon the sense of relief overpowers
that of regret. The finality of the occasion is
satisfying. You smile wistfully as you wave
your hand in a last gesture of farewell.
The analogy is obvious. Now it's your turn
to say hello. And there is so much, so very
much you can say. Jean. You can talk about
the noise in the libe and the attitude of the
co-eds and the Cellar coffee and all the other
things that make Stanford so fine and beautiful.
I like to think that you have a mission to
fulfill, Jean. A mission to carry on the great
tradition that is Bull Session—the tradition of the
three Mellinkoffs, John Cobbs, Chesley Sa
royan, and maybe even Bill Rose.
Yours is not an easy burden. There will be
deadlines to haunt you, censorship to nettle
you, and garbled copy to infuriate you. But
you must rise above these. You must bear your
burden like a true soldier. And you can do it,
Team Yes, you can do it.
And when it's all over, perhaps you too will
feel content. For Bull Session is fun, Jean, so
much fun, so very much fun. With the heart
breaks come laughs — deep, body-shaking
laughs, laughs that make you feel good inside.
You'll like writing Bull Session, Jean. I know
I did.
So make a good job of it. Remember: Yours
is not to reason why; yours is but to do or die,
Jean.
Now it's goodbye.
"Time is our tedious Song should here have
ending,
Heav'n's youngest teemed Star,
Hath fixed her polisht Car,
Her sleeping Lord with Handmaid Lamp at
tending:
And all about the Courtly Stable,
Bright-harnest Angels sit in order serviceable."
