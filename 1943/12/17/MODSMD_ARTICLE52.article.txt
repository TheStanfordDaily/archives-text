# Farm Students Take War Changes in Stride
## 
### 
Autumn Quarter of 194 X It started differently from Autumn Quarter of
1942, and as it progressed, more changes became evident. Changes came,
hut no matter what happened, Stanford students took life in their stride..
The changes became a part of the new way of Stanford life.
The AST men got organized. A Council was formed composed of repre
sentatives from each company, and it was this group that co-ordinated
Army life with civilian Stanford.
Another cliange was the arrival of Col. John Eden to Stanford, replac
ing Col. Harry B. Allen as commander of the ASTP.
The War Board continued its work, and one of its most outstanding ac
tivities was the organizing of student blood donors for the Red Cross
Unit. Civilian and soldier students didn't need much urging to till the
quotas.
And although tradition seems far removed from the things mentioned
above, Stanford tw»k time out to think about the tree on History Corner.
The old oak was dying: but a little extra care brought new life and an
other tradition survived the wartime veneer.
