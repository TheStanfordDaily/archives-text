Tuesday was an important anni
yersary for ex-R.A.F. pilot, Pvt.
David J. C'live of Company C, who
exchanged his blue-grey uniform for
American olive-drab on December
14 of last year.
One of the rare soldiers in the army
of the United States who is entitled
to wear R.A.F. wings below his U.S.
insignia, double overseas stripes on
his sleeve, and the British Foreign
Service as well as the European The
ater medals, young Clive was an aee
pilot with Britain's coastal command
until severe eye-strain, due to water-
caused his flying career to
:rashdive.
Private Clive is the son of E. E.
Clive, ranking British stage star who
is credited with 1,152 different roles
in "Who's Who." His English an
cestry may account for his passion
tor understatement
Hit and run dogfights over the Irish
Sea Clive describes as "fun." The
London blitz, thru which he sat,
awaiting his assignment, he remem
bers as "uncomfortable to say the
. east." Regarding his return trip to
America —through U-boat infested
waters, aboard an unseaworthy
French troopship, captured at Dakar
—Clive admits that he prefers the
'Queen Mary."
Continuing his prewar engineering
.studies at Stanford, the ex-pilot finds
the academic life interesting but
comparatively uneventful, after his
year-long vigil over the besieged
English coast.
