# Farm 'Armchair Commandos' Keep Physically Conditioned
## 
### Cpl Carl Princi, Company I 
There comes a time in the life of every soldier—yes. even an ASTP
man—when he has to be tested for physical fitness.
At varied intervals of an army man's career, his stamina and agility must
be determined, a constant check kept on his physical ability.

A group of efficient athletic in - ♦
| structors, under the direction of,
I coach Everett Dean, recently con
: ducted such a test which showed j
considerable improvement over pre
vious performances.
To show the physical efficiency of j
these Stanford G.l.'s here are only a I
few examples of their capabilities, j
In the physical litness test, given last j
week. C. Bardwil of Company D '
came thru with a superior perfor- j
mance of 50 push-ups, while the es- !
' tablished army average is only 23. !
' Others completed the same exercise j
! with 40 or more.
Squat-Jumping
i Squat-jumping, a leg exercise, was i
j second on the list prescribed for the ,
test. The average for this event is j
considered fair at 33. It was per
formed 83 times by P. Sessa of Com- j
pany F, with more than a score of |
others whose totals ranged any- j
where from 60 to 80.
An event apparently difficult was j
the pull-up exercise, or the familiar j
chinning-the-bar. Few men were j
able to chin themselves more than j
ten times—on the average, six times
—while W. Owen of Company F, in
his sincere desire to establish a rec- i
ord for that day, kept bobbing his j
head over and under the bar for a j
count of fifteen.
The most amusing of the events, j
and one of the most exhausting, was |
the 100-yard pick-a-back, where a
trainee selects another man of ap- |
proximately his own weight and car- !
ries him on his back for a distance !
of 100 yards. The average time for ;
this test is 26 seconds, but C. Schu
mann of Company Hand J. O'Brien
of Company I did it in 19 seconds;
and more than 25 others in less than j
' 23 seconds.
300-Yard Run
The final event, and definitely the
one showing the most improvement,
was the 300-yard run, accomplished
by the average army man in 46 sec
onds. L. Leger of Company Hand
A. Catucci of Company F ran this
distance in 37 seconds, followed by a
number of others who scored less
than 41 seconds.
Said Mr. Dean . . . "If these tests
are any indication of an 'armchair
commando's' efficiency on the field
of battle—and to a certain degree
they are—we need have no worries
i about an early victory Uncle Sam's
boys can and will do it."

and more than 25 others in less than j
' 23 seconds.
300-Yard Run
The final event, and definitely the
one showing the most improvement,
was the 300-yard run, accomplished
by the average army man in 46 sec
onds. L. Leger of Company Hand
A. Catucci of Company F ran this
distance in 37 seconds, followed by a
number of others who scored less
than 41 seconds.
Said Mr. Dean . . . "If these tests
are any indication of an 'armchair
commando's' efficiency on the field
of battle—and to a certain degree
they are—we need have no worries
i about an early victory Uncle Sam's
boys can and will do it."
There comes a time in the life of every soldier—yes. even an ASTP
man—when he has to be tested for physical fitness.
At varied intervals of an army man's career, his stamina and agility must
be determined, a constant check kept on his physical ability.

In the physical litness test, given last j
week. C. Bardwil of Company D '
came thru with a superior perfor- j
mance of 50 push-ups, while the es- !
' tablished army average is only 23. !
' Others completed the same exercise j
! with 40 or more.
Squat-Jumping
i Squat-jumping, a leg exercise, was i
j second on the list prescribed for the ,
test. The average for this event is j
considered fair at 33. It was per
formed 83 times by P. Sessa of Com- j
pany F, with more than a score of |
others whose totals ranged any- j
where from 60 to 80.
An event apparently difficult was j
the pull-up exercise, or the familiar j
chinning-the-bar. Few men were j
able to chin themselves more than j
ten times—on the average, six times
—while W. Owen of Company F, in
his sincere desire to establish a rec- i
ord for that day, kept bobbing his j
head over and under the bar for a j
count of fifteen.
The most amusing of the events, j
and one of the most exhausting, was |
the 100-yard pick-a-back, where a
trainee selects another man of ap- |
proximately his own weight and car- !
ries him on his back for a distance !
of 100 yards. The average time for ;
this test is 26 seconds, but C. Schu
mann of Company Hand J. O'Brien
of Company I did it in 19 seconds;
and more than 25 others in less than j
