Gas masks are no holdalls for
candy bars, sox, oranges and un
derwear, as a careless rookie dis
covered, when he became a technical
casualty during Lieut. Charles H.
Dill's streamlined military science
lecture this week.
By applying lively approaches to
one of the army's traditionally dull
subjects, Company E's executive of
ficer has launched a surprisingly
popular series of lectures in military
science, liberally seasoned with hu
mor, but never obscuring the under
lying lessons.
Technically Dead
At the cry of "gas," the unfortu
nate yardbird had to remove more
junk than you usually find in a lady's
handbag, before locating his mask;
by which time he had been declared
technically dead. His prostrate body
was carried offstage by his alert bud
dies who had donned their masks
in the prescribed six seconds.
Similarly, enterprising soldiers
demonstrated the correct way of
greeting an officer on the campus,
in vivid contrast to the sad sack who
instinctively ducks behind a tree at
the approach of the mighty.
How Not to Get a Pass
"How to win sergeants and influ
ence officers" dealt with the right and
wrong methods of asking for a three
day pass. The yardbird who wan
dered into the orderly room, hands
in pockets, perched himself on his
company commander's desk and
barked, "how'se about a pass?" was
consigned to instant oblivion by the
armywise soldier audience.
Lieutenant Dill, who is a firm be
liever in demonstration as opposed
to the dry lecture, is well qualified
to present these novel productions,
since Uncle Sam snatched him right
off the Broadway stage, where he has
been a popular featured player for
some 13 years.
