# 'None Left To Be Sunk'
## 
### 
Hard-pressed to explain the abrupt
dimminuendo of Admiral Doenitz' J
"inexorable U-boat warfare," the i
German Trans-Ocean news agency j
bleakly reports that "there are !
simply not enough allied ships (left)
to be sunk."
It is startling to realize that those
huge convoys which, night and day,
plough through the North Atlantic j
and Pacific sealanes, are nothing but
a mirage.
The Flying Dutchman sails again,
this time loaded to the gunwales
with purely imaginary tanks, cau
tion. troops and equipment.
Reassuring however, is the fact .
that if, as the Germans claim, Amer
ican supplies have failed to reach I
their destination, the doughboys
must have cleaned up North Africa. '
Sicily and one third of Italy with
thei. bare fists. And a mighty credit- j
able achievement it was, as even the .
Germans must admit.
