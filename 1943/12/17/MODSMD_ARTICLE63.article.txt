Army quartermasters offer a heartening glimpse into the future
for ration-bound civilians. The ambidexterous supply services,
faced with the problem of fighting the enemy with one hand
and maintaining the army's lifeline with the other, have devel
oped many revolutionary innovations in concentrated supply.
Many of these, already in use by the quartermaster corps, will
be welcomed by perspiring housewives, but we suspect that just
as many will be declined with thanks by citizens who find it dif
ficult to keep pace with the march of progress.
The housewive will be delighted or depressed, according
xo her state of evolution, to learn that the war will leave us many
steps nearer to the goal of capsule nutrition.
We suspect, however, that the capsule nutrition era is still far
from our door, that concentrated foods will be relegated to an ;
emergency status only. For, to our mind, familiar American
menus, with their attendant dyspepsia, still constitute an ideal
fare which no amount of scientific dehydration and concentra
tion can ever equal.
But who are we to brandish a frogleg in the face of progress?
We shall doubtless be trampled underfoot by citizens of the
brave new world, marching to God know? where in dehydrated
columns, sustained by concentrated capsules no bigger than
your thumb.
Personally, we shall sit by the side of the road with our bud-'
dies —and there will be not a few of them —laughing irreverently
and belching shamelessly, as we stuff our protesting stomachs
wiih degenerate, outmoded sirloins, slightly rare and smothered '
with mushrooms.
