# Senior Women Gain War-Time Fame
## 
### 
The past year has been one in which many* precedents in ASSU govern
ment have been outmoded as the Farm's attention has turned to wartime
activities and accelerated programs, and senior women have come to promi
nence.
One of the leading innovations occurred when Janet McClanahan was
elected president of the Associated Students, Stanford's first women leader.
Miss McClanahan took office last spring when the calling up of reserves
was the main topic of conversation.
Peggy Boothe was named by Excom to fill the vice-presidency when
that office was left vacant.
As women replaced men in nearly all top positions last spring, Jane Glas
son was elected editor of The Stanfoi'd Daily, the first woman to hold that
position in 22 years. This tradition-breaking change was followed by the
recent election of another woman to the editorship, Irma Cunha, who will
serve until next June.
Though there was no Big Game this year, The Gaieties were given jusl
the same and were directed for the fust time by a woman, Jean Levinson.
Marianne Goldman has filled a top position in freshman guidance.
Autumn Quarter's elections destroyed the unusual women's monopoly
in ASSU government as a man was once more chosen to lead the Asso

ciated Students. Dick Driseoll will assume office Winter Quarter, assisted
by Luana Forkner as vice-president.
