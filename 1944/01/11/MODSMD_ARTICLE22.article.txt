WASHINGTON, Jan. 10. —Allied
merchant shipping losses by enemy
submarine action in the Atlantic was
60 per cent less last year than in
1942 and the U-boats have become
more cautious in their operation, it
was revealed tonight in a joint
Anglo-American statement released
through the Office of War Informa
tion.
No figure was given on the number
of U-boats destroyed but it has been
estimated that the intensified Allied
anti-submarine campaign accounted
for some 200 of the marauders during
1943.
