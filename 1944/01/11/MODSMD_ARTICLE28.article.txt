# MURALS
## Signups Begin For Basketball 
### 
} Signups for the Winter Quarter
intramural basketball league began
yesterday and will continue until
Saturday, according to Harry Walter,
director of intramural sports at
Stanford.
Basketball will be the only intra
mural sport for men this quarter. It
is hoped that this will correct the
situation which developed last quar
ter when programs were initiated
in six sports, with at least half of
them proving unsuccessful.
Team managers should write the
j names of their teams, their own
names, and their telephone numbers
on the signup sheet which is posted
in the Encina Gym.
Teams are requested to sign up
under the name of the organization
which they are representing, and not
to use an assumed name as several
teams (Tappa Kegga Lager, The
Stoa'tes, etc.) did last quarter. All
teams must represent on-campus
organizations.
