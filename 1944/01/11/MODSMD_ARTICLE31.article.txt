# SIDELINE SLANTS

### JIM WEINBERG 
SLANTS CONTINUES
Being much too busy fighting off
our respective draft boards to devote
much time or thought to devising an
original name for a column, Rog
Gorman (who will be my partner in
crime in editing the sports page of
the coming volume) and I will, at
least temporarily, stick to the tradi
tional and time-worn old standby, j
"Sideline Slants." "Slants" now is j
night onto 15 years old and dates ;
clear back to 1929.
We will continue not only with the j
name of the column, but also with its j
policy, as stated by Zip Walt in his
first effort of last Winter Quarter:
"The policy of SIDELINE SLANTS
should be recorded for posterity in '
the initial attempt. The policy is
"**!&?-),''()!'••;:!"♦." As soon as I
think up a good code of principles to
follow, I'll let you know. The only
thing that SLANTS will try to do
this quarter is to keep it as informal
as possible, talk once in awhile about !
Ihings other than sports, compliment i
somebody now and then, and pan i
everybody now and then. Perhaps j
when things get rather lean, I'll dig ;
up a few old columns by ex-sports !
editors and run them."

ROSE BOWL NOTES
Those of us who made the long
I trek to the sunny southland (all
right, so what it it did rain a little?)
over vacation were treated to a swell
i during the first week
of 1944, including top-flight competi
tion in football, basketball, and golf.
Heading the list, and starting off
the week s activities, was the annual
Tournament of Roses Football Game
in Pasadena, in which SC's Trojans
! routed the Washington Huskies,
: 29-0. The Trojans played some beau
tiful football, football which would
I have been mighty difficult to beat
[ for any team in any year. They
j looked 100 per cent better than the
USC eleven which just did manage
to outscore UCLA on the last Satur
day of November. Headman Jeff
Cravath deserves to be commended
for a splendid coaching job in effect
ing this change.
The best line play of the day was
turned in by Big Norm Verry. whose
Number 72 emerged from the bottom
! of the pile in a good percentage of
i the plays. Backfield honors go to
I Jim Hardy for his passing, and to
; George Callanan for his pass-catch
ing, especially on the first touchdown
! which came with 40 seconds to go in
i the first half.

policy, as stated by Zip Walt in his
first effort of last Winter Quarter:

the initial attempt. The policy is
"**!&?-),''()!'••;:!"♦." As soon as I
think up a good code of principles to
follow, I'll let you know. The only
thing that SLANTS will try to do
this quarter is to keep it as informal
as possible, talk once in awhile about !
Ihings other than sports, compliment i
somebody now and then, and pan i
everybody now and then. Perhaps j
when things get rather lean, I'll dig ;
up a few old columns by ex-sports !
editors and run them."

ROSE BOWL NOTES
Those of us who made the long
I trek to the sunny southland (all
right, so what it it did rain a little?)
over vacation were treated to a swell
i during the first week
of 1944, including top-flight competi
tion in football, basketball, and golf.
Heading the list, and starting off
the week s activities, was the annual
Tournament of Roses Football Game
in Pasadena, in which SC's Trojans
! routed the Washington Huskies,
: 29-0. The Trojans played some beau
tiful football, football which would
I have been mighty difficult to beat
[ for any team in any year. They
j looked 100 per cent better than the
USC eleven which just did manage
to outscore UCLA on the last Satur
day of November. Headman Jeff
Cravath deserves to be commended
for a splendid coaching job in effect
ing this change.
The best line play of the day was
turned in by Big Norm Verry. whose
Number 72 emerged from the bottom
! of the pile in a good percentage of
i the plays. Backfield honors go to
I Jim Hardy for his passing, and to
; George Callanan for his pass-catch
ing, especially on the first touchdown
! which came with 40 seconds to go in
i the first half.
SLANTS CONTINUES
Being much too busy fighting off
our respective draft boards to devote
much time or thought to devising an
original name for a column, Rog
Gorman (who will be my partner in
crime in editing the sports page of
the coming volume) and I will, at
least temporarily, stick to the tradi
tional and time-worn old standby, j
"Sideline Slants." "Slants" now is j
night onto 15 years old and dates ;
clear back to 1929.
We will continue not only with the j
name of the column, but also with its j
policy, as stated by Zip Walt in his
first effort of last Winter Quarter:
"The policy of SIDELINE SLANTS
should be recorded for posterity in '
the initial attempt. The policy is
