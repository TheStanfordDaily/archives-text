# This Volume

THE new Bull Sessioner, Jean Levinson, began her first column
by saying just plain "Hello." Although that word is said
millions of times every day, it best expresses what the new edi
torial board would like to say to the Daily's readers as a new
volume of the paper comes into being.
The Daily will have editorial policies. Just exactly what they
are won't be obvious until issues arise which provoke a need
for definite policies.
When the need does arise and the Daily does take a stand,
the stand taken Will not be based upon the opinion of the editor
alone. It will be the opinion derived from a vote of members of
editorial boardâ€”these members being the editor, the managing
editor, the two associate editors, and the staff editor.
From day to day, the Daily's purpose, the purpose of not only
editorial board but also of every member of the staff, will be to
serve its readers as best it can by correctly covering campus news
and other news that interests its readers. When the Daily appears
to be failing in this purpose or in any other way, editorial board
would like to hear about it from readers either in writing or in
person.
And so, until it's time to say "goodbye," the staff of the
Stanford Daily will "be in there pitching."
