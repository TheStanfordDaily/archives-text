### JEAN LEVINSON 
Hello.
With trembling fingers the words of this first column were
pounded out on a pre-Civil War Corona. Mumbling incoherently
to myself I sez: "Here's my big opportunity. I can say what I
want about whom I want —gad, what limitless fields! Okay, so
what'll I write about? Reg Day's always a sure-fire story, it can't
miss. Yeh, they'll love it if I write about the lovely coeds drop
ping dead from exhaustion in line at the Ad Building; of money
.mad cashiers grabbing at checks through their cages, financial
gleams in their beady eyes; of the lonely civilian male coming
to register still in his swaddling clothes; or of the sparkling con
versations overheard while pushing people out of line: 'I got a
"D" and I thought I was a cinch for an "A".'—or, 'Look at Minnie,
she gained pounds over vacation!' —or, 'Was I ever a riot on New
Year's Eve .... put on the lampshade and started to take off all
my ' Yeh, Reg Day'll always get a laugh. Then too, my
vacation would be a likely subject what with party times, shop
ping, going to see the new Frank Sinatra picture (aaaaaaaaah),
saying a cheery 'hello' to the soldiers on Market Street and for
getting it wasn't the Quad, boarding a crowded streetcar armed
with only a hat-pin, walking the dog in the pouring dew—yes,
vacation could be delved into lightly."
After a few more hours of delicately bashing my head against
the wall, I decided I could wish one and all a tardy Happy New
Year and then make brilliant predictions and bring up profound
questions for '44, such as: Will Flattop kill our boy Tracy? Will
I ever get my laundry back? Will the Libe hire Alpine guides
to get to the Rare Book Room? Will Kleenex come back again?
Will we win the war in '44? Yes, even this bit of journalistic de
lerium might be suitable for the first installment of Bull Session.
But deciding once and for all (via my womanly intuition and a
splitting headache) to abandon such thoughts, I chose merely to
say "Hello," and hope that you'll continue or commence to read
this column and send in suggestions and criticisms by way of
Campus Opinion. There/ Now you can turn to your buddy and
smugly tell him, or her as the case may be, that here's another
female trying to take over again, and that it can't be done. Well,
we'll see, friends, if this cow-pasture Winchell can plunk it out.
We'll see.

questions for '44, such as: Will Flattop kill our boy Tracy? Will
I ever get my laundry back? Will the Libe hire Alpine guides
to get to the Rare Book Room? Will Kleenex come back again?
Will we win the war in '44? Yes, even this bit of journalistic de
lerium might be suitable for the first installment of Bull Session.
But deciding once and for all (via my womanly intuition and a
splitting headache) to abandon such thoughts, I chose merely to
say "Hello," and hope that you'll continue or commence to read
this column and send in suggestions and criticisms by way of
Campus Opinion. There/ Now you can turn to your buddy and
smugly tell him, or her as the case may be, that here's another
female trying to take over again, and that it can't be done. Well,
we'll see, friends, if this cow-pasture Winchell can plunk it out.
We'll see.
Hello.
With trembling fingers the words of this first column were
pounded out on a pre-Civil War Corona. Mumbling incoherently
to myself I sez: "Here's my big opportunity. I can say what I
want about whom I want —gad, what limitless fields! Okay, so
what'll I write about? Reg Day's always a sure-fire story, it can't
miss. Yeh, they'll love it if I write about the lovely coeds drop
ping dead from exhaustion in line at the Ad Building; of money
.mad cashiers grabbing at checks through their cages, financial
gleams in their beady eyes; of the lonely civilian male coming
to register still in his swaddling clothes; or of the sparkling con
versations overheard while pushing people out of line: 'I got a
"D" and I thought I was a cinch for an "A".'—or, 'Look at Minnie,
she gained pounds over vacation!' —or, 'Was I ever a riot on New
Year's Eve .... put on the lampshade and started to take off all
my ' Yeh, Reg Day'll always get a laugh. Then too, my
vacation would be a likely subject what with party times, shop
ping, going to see the new Frank Sinatra picture (aaaaaaaaah),
saying a cheery 'hello' to the soldiers on Market Street and for
getting it wasn't the Quad, boarding a crowded streetcar armed
with only a hat-pin, walking the dog in the pouring dew—yes,
vacation could be delved into lightly."
After a few more hours of delicately bashing my head against
the wall, I decided I could wish one and all a tardy Happy New
Year and then make brilliant predictions and bring up profound
questions for '44, such as: Will Flattop kill our boy Tracy? Will
I ever get my laundry back? Will the Libe hire Alpine guides
to get to the Rare Book Room? Will Kleenex come back again?
