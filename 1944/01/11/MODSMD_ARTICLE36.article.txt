A LADY TAKES A CHANCE—Now
playing at the Stanford Theater.
Lady Takes a Chance" is an
R.K.0.-Radio comedy which gets oft'
to a good start only to stop shorter
than one of Bing Crosby's proverbial
horses. The story, an original by Jo
Swerling, has good possibilities, but
fails to live up to them.
Jean Arthur, the star of the film,
is cast as a New York girl who de
cides to spend her vacation on an all
expense bus tour to the Far West,
hoping to escape temporarily from
her three bothersome boy briencLs.
She meets handsome cowboy John
Wayne at a rodeo out West, falls in
love with him, and finally hooks him
after three reels which drag horribly.
It's a pity to waste such good stars
as these on a story as bad as this one.
