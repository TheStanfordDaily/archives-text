# Pianist's Debut Cited Mechanical
## 
### 
Donald Kemp, 17-year-old Penin- '
sula pianist and co-winner of the !
KGO Young Artists Contest, made
his debut with the San Francisco
Symphony Orchestra last Saturday j
night, performing the Beethoven 1
"Emperor" Concerto.
Kemp, though presenting a fine !
display of technic, failed to give a |
very convincing performance of the
work and his interpretation appeared j
very cold and brittle.
Of special interest on the program !
was the first performance in San j
Francisco of Paul Hindemith's ''Ma- !
this der Mahler" which may well be
considered one of the better works !
written in the last 20 years. Pierre |
Monteux conducted.â€”Gugel
