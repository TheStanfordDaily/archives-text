U.S. 15th AIR FORCE H.Q. IN
ITALY, Jan. 10. â€”A great force of
Flying Fortresses today blasted the
rail yards at Sofia, communication
hub of all the Balkans, in the second
powerful smash in 24 hours from
bases, which, it can now be revealed,
are situated in Italy.
The announcement of today's raid
on Sofia, the fifth in less than two
months, and yesterday's shattering
of the U-Boat nest of Pola on the
Italian Adriatic coast came simul
taneously with the revelation that
American heavy bombers have
transferred their operating bases
from North Africa to Italy without
missing a beat in their offensive.
A 15th Air Force communique said
only that Sofia was bombed at about
noon by a "heavy force of B-17 Fly
ing Fortresses" but the unusually
early announcement indicated that
it must have been highly successful.
