Yesterday 4.11(Â» civilian and soldier
J students enrolled for Winter Quarter,
according to the report made last
night by Registrar J. P. Mitchell,
j This total includes 2,000 students
under the Army Specialized Train
j ing Program and 2,11(5 civilian stu
dents, nearly 1,000 less than the Au
| tumn Quarter enrollment of over
j 5.000,
Late registrants and the arrival of
200 ASTP students may bring the
registration closer to the record total
of last fall.
! Registration Falls
Monday, 1,314 women and 802 ci
vilian men registered, 1,000 less than
the 1943 winter registration. How
ever, the total of 2,116 students was
! near the total ol' 2,492 students regis
! tered by the last day of Autumn
! Quarter.
The drop in enrollment is par
i tially due to the decrease of ASTP
j students on campus, who numbered
] 2.700 in the fall and now are expected
to total 2,200. Causing this decrease
| were the transfer of 120 Army stu-
J dents to Oregon State, the closing of
j the Army psychology school, and the
i completion of training by several
ASTP units. This quarter, 220 new
J engineering students will begin
! training in their place.
Ratio Drops
The ratio of civilian men to the
women is in sharp contrast to last
quarter's registration of 1,962 men
and 1,226 women. Since 1,015 ci
vilian men were on campus on the
last day of Autumn Quarter, yester
i day's total of 802 indicates a decrease
|of over 200 men. However, the ratio
jof all civilian and Army men on
j campus to the women students is
now 3 to 1.3.
