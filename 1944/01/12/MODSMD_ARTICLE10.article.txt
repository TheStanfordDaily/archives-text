### 
One hundred and fifteen late regis
trants for Winter Quarter swelled
the civilian and ASTP total to 4.231
yesterday, although this was far be
low last quarter's registration of over
5,000 students.
Tuesday's registrants, 45 men and
women, were all civilian. Students
enrolling later in the quarter and the
200 men who are expected to join the
ASTP units may make the winter
registration reach the 4,500 mark.
The Registrar's office reported that
on the second day of Winter Quarter
in 1943, 2,085 men had registered.
Yesterday 847 civilian men, less than
half of last year's total, had enrolled
in the Administration Building.
There are, however, nearly 100
more women this quarter than in
1943, 1,384, as compared to 1,291. The
2,231 civilian registrants this winter
are only two-thirds of the 3,376 stu
dents who were listed in the Regis
trar's office at the same time in 1943.
Although the women outnumber
the civilian men by a ration of 1.4
to 58, the ratio of all civilian and
ASTP students on the campus to the
women is approximately 3 to 1.3.
Five hundred ASTP students have
left the-University this quarter, par
tially causing the drop in enrollment.
From the 2,700 Army students regis
tered in the fall, 120 have been trans
ferred to Oregon State College. Other
Army men leaving the campus be
longed to the dismissed psychology
classes or had completed their ASTP
training.
Although the 800 civilian men are
fewer than the 1,105 men registered
by the last day of Autumn Quarter,
they still outnumber the estimate
made before the October registration
day, when only 700 civilian men were
expected by the University offices.
