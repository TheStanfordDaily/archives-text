# Debating Squad Meets Tonight
## 
### 
The Stanford Debating Squad will
meet tonight at e .7:30 in Room 200 T
on the History corner. The purpose
of the meeting is to organize the
work of the quarterâ€”to plan the day
and hour of subsequent meetings, to
discuss plans for sending student
speakers out, to discuss the Joffre
Debate to be held at the University
of California, and to prepare for the
Southern California tournaments
which will be held in the spring, ac
cording to James Gordon Emerson,
associate professor of speech and
drama.
Because of the shortage of upper
division students, there are more
openings for freshmen and sopho
mores on the debating squad, and
those students interested are urged
to attend the meeting.
