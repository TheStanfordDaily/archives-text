# Golf Tourney To Be Held in S.F.
## 
### 
With the Los Angeles Open Golf
Tourney finished, plans are now be
ing made for the next major tourna
ment on the Coast. The San Fran
cisco Junior Chamber of Commerce
will play host to over 150 top golfers
at the San Francisco Victory Open,
to be held at the Harding Park Golf
Course Jan. 14, 15, and 16.
To date, the greatest number of
entries have come from the bay re
gion where many top golfers are now
engaged in defense work or in the
armed services. Initial ticket sales
indicate that the greatest crowd in
local golfing history will be present
at the tournament. The $2.50 season
tickets, which are on sale at Roos
Bros., are being snatched up at a
great rate.
The Junior Chamber Committee is
making Harding Course available for
the week preceding the tournament
so that local entrants as well as the
visiting PGA luminaries can try their
mettle on the difficult 6, GOO-yard
course.
