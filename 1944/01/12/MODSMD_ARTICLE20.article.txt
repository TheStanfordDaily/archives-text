Jim Weinberg wrote in this column
yesterday that the policy of the
sports staff this quarter would be
"**!&?â€”'() This is quite true,
but after due consideration we have
decided to add one more point.
The main policy of the staff this
year will be to write all sports stories
in the English language. By the Eng
lish language we do not mean such
jargon as:
"Snagging the hurtling pigskin
deep in the shadow of his own goal
posts, the cardinal clad behemoth
charged down the gridiron accom
panied by the frantic cheers of 112,-
89(5 leather lunged fans who urged
their pistol packin' pappa on. He
crashed, bashed, and smashed his
way through the opposing players,
leaving them scattered like flies on
the turf until he fell gasping for
breath into the striped Valhalla, after
having chalked up the initial marker
of this battle of the century."
We trust that you'll see what we
mean when we say that sports stories
will henceforth be written in English.
GOOD IDEA
The dividing of the intra-mural
basketball league into civilian and
soldier sections sounds like a good
idea. The football season proved that
most of the civilian teams were no
match for the x - ough and ready sol
diers. A few non-military teams
managed to do all right, hut the ma
jority lost game after game, dis
couraging all concerned. Under the
new method, the soldiers and civil
ians will play in their separate
leagues. It seems to us that some
sort of play-off should be arranged
between the two league champs, to
determine the basketball champion
ship of the school. This could be ar
ranged late in the quarter and would
provide an added incentive for vic
tory in each loop.
