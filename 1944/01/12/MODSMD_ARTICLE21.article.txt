"All pedestrians going to and from
Palo Alto must walk on the side
walks," said Gordy Davis, Chief of
Police. He added that the students
have been most co-operative and it
hasn't been necessary to use any
penalties as yet. Pedestrians should
stand on the corners marked as pe
destrian stations if they want a ride,
Davis suggested.
Students should check their bicy
cles to see if they have reflectors on
them so that they can be seen at
night. Since there are plenty of bi
cycle racks conveniently located
around the Quad, no bicycles should
be ridden under the collonades of the
Quad, Davis concluded.
