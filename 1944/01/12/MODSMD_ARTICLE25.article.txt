# WAR FRONTS
## Yank Bombers Hit Northwest Germany 
### 
LONDON — Enormous fleets of
fighter escorted American heavy
bombers, constantly battling great
swarms of Nazi interceptors and the
full might of Germany's most des
perate aerial defense, spread ruin
and destruction over northwest Ger
many yesterday—possibly also hit
ting Berlin—in what probably was
history's greatest air battle.
Adolf Hitler's high command made
the first claims. A special communi
que issued from the Fuehrer's head
quarters said that 123 American
planes, mostly heavy bombers, were
(shot down, and asserted fantastically
than only two Nazi planes were def
initely destroyed and that seven
were missing.
