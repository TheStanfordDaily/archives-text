# Editorial Policy
## 
### 
THE PURPOSE of an editorial is to provide a frame of reference
for a newspaper's readers, to enable them to understand more
thoroughly the issues involved in a specific question.
Whether the question is social, political, or economic, the
editorial writer is faced with the problem of sorting the relevant
facts, interpreting them in the light of previous experience, and of
giving direction to the public debate.
Yet many situations which arise in scholastic, social, or stu
dent government life at Stanford are too trivial to warrant an
editorial discussion by Daily writers. In many cases, only an
article presenting the facts is justified.
What good journalistic purpose can be served by comment
on the trash in the Nitery, or dates for soldiers?
The editorial policy of a newspaper and of The Daily is in
reality the method by which the editors determine the kind of
editorial discussion to be used in respect to certain important
problems. Editorial policy will by inference decide the im
portance of a probJem.
If there is no apparent editorial policy, the reader—even the
Stanford reader—can assume that there is no situation existent
which, in the opinion of the paper's editors, requires clarification.
The editors of The Daily welcome suggestions as to campus
problems which the readers feel are significant enough to empha
size through the newspaper medium, but in any event the de
cision of the editors must be final.—Dave Davis
