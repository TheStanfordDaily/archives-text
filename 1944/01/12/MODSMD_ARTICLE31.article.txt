### JEAN LEVINSON 
The American songwriter has let us down. Gone are the days
of such musical gems as "Night and Day." "Smoke Gets in Your
Eyes," and "Cheek to Cheek." That instrument of torture, the
juke box—now blares out such demented masterpieces as "Pistol
Packin' Maater" and "Mares Eat Oats." The latter is a lovable
little ditty dealing with the nourishing food that is imbibed by,
namely: Mares, Does, Litle Lambs, and Kids. Now really!
I hereby challenge any sane homo sapien to listen to this so
called song for ten minutes without foaming at the mouth pro
fusely, and going to Roos Brothers to purchase a double-breasted
tweed straight jacket. Just picture this situation .... a handsome
soldier (which brings to mind another song—"There are Such
Things") home on leave, has a date with his girl.
They have been dining and dancing at Walgreen's and have
had a heavenly evening. Now they are standing on La Rue de
fJniversite .... drinking in the still beauty of the starry night
("There Are Such Things"., when he gently takes her in his arms
and softly croons: "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little
lambs eat ivy, a kid'll eat ivy too —wouldn't you?" And with
utter abandon she whispers, "Yeth!"
The phrase "a kid'll eat ivy too" brings to mind a fascinating
question. Does said "kid" refer to an animal, or to a hungry little
youngster? Or does it mayhap deal with the Brenda short-skirt,
gum-chewing variety of "kid"? If on the one hand we take it
to mean a young goat or antelope, then it would be plausible to
surmise that said "kid" would munch on a crisp, tender morsel of
said "ivy."
But, if we take this illusive little word to mean a bouncing baby
or babe, then we must point out the fallacy of this madrigal, for
what "kid" (let us keep in mind that this refers to the baby or
Brenda species) would be famished enough to scale a brick wall
in order to seek out the young, succulent leaves of he ivy plant—
or even pick some from the ground and thence sit down to a
tossed ivy salad prepared with French dressing?
No, no, we the music lovers of America cannot swallow such
utter nonsense! And we will hereby remain staunch supporters
of Mr. Porter, Mr. Kern, and Mr. Berlin. La da de da.

But, if we take this illusive little word to mean a bouncing baby
or babe, then we must point out the fallacy of this madrigal, for
what "kid" (let us keep in mind that this refers to the baby or
Brenda species) would be famished enough to scale a brick wall
in order to seek out the young, succulent leaves of he ivy plant—
or even pick some from the ground and thence sit down to a
tossed ivy salad prepared with French dressing?
No, no, we the music lovers of America cannot swallow such
utter nonsense! And we will hereby remain staunch supporters
of Mr. Porter, Mr. Kern, and Mr. Berlin. La da de da.
The American songwriter has let us down. Gone are the days
of such musical gems as "Night and Day." "Smoke Gets in Your
Eyes," and "Cheek to Cheek." That instrument of torture, the
juke box—now blares out such demented masterpieces as "Pistol
Packin' Maater" and "Mares Eat Oats." The latter is a lovable
little ditty dealing with the nourishing food that is imbibed by,
namely: Mares, Does, Litle Lambs, and Kids. Now really!
I hereby challenge any sane homo sapien to listen to this so
called song for ten minutes without foaming at the mouth pro
fusely, and going to Roos Brothers to purchase a double-breasted
tweed straight jacket. Just picture this situation .... a handsome
soldier (which brings to mind another song—"There are Such
Things") home on leave, has a date with his girl.
They have been dining and dancing at Walgreen's and have
had a heavenly evening. Now they are standing on La Rue de
fJniversite .... drinking in the still beauty of the starry night
("There Are Such Things"., when he gently takes her in his arms
and softly croons: "Mares eat oats and does eat oats and little
lambs eat ivy, a kid'll eat ivy too —wouldn't you?" And with
utter abandon she whispers, "Yeth!"
The phrase "a kid'll eat ivy too" brings to mind a fascinating
question. Does said "kid" refer to an animal, or to a hungry little
youngster? Or does it mayhap deal with the Brenda short-skirt,
gum-chewing variety of "kid"? If on the one hand we take it
to mean a young goat or antelope, then it would be plausible to
surmise that said "kid" would munch on a crisp, tender morsel of
said "ivy."
