## 
### 
A Japanese machine gun was given lo President Robert (J. Spruul of tluÂ»
University of California as a gift from Admiral C. Nimitz, who is in com
mand of the Pacific Fleet. The gun was presented by Lieut. Edward V.
Brewer. Jr.. and is to be given to the Naval ROTC for its use.
Lieutenant Brewer was a member of the Naval ROTC while he was in

the university, from which he wast
graduated in 1941. He is the son of
Edward V. Brewer, associate pro
fessor of German on the Berkeley \
campus. Lieutenant Brewer is now
on leave recuperating from an api
pendectomy.
The machine gun, a Juki, was cap- j
tured by the Marines at Tarawa, j
Admiral Nimitz in his letter says it j
continued firing until its gunners
were killed. It shows the efficacy of j
the Marines' marksmanship, for the j
gun was hit four times by American !
gunners. The mark of one bullet is !
slight, but is right down the barrel \
of the gun, evidently being the one >
that took care of the Japanese who I
was firing it.
Admiral Nimitz was the first officer I
in command of the University of j
California ROTC at the time it was j
instituted on the Berkeley campus j
in 1926.
"The university is grateful to the '
men of the armed forces who cap- 1
tured this Japanese machine gun,
and to our own Admiral Chester W. I
Nimitz, who arranged to have it !
brought to this campus," said Presi- ;
dent Sproul. "We shall guard it well, !
and will seek to have California men ]
in the future as well as in the past, !
live up to the ideal of sacrifice for j
freedom."
