# Series Discusses Post-War Japan
## 
### 
Last night the Winter Quarter
Tuesday Evening Series opened with
a symposium on "Japan's Future in
the Light of the Cairo Conference."
The threesome who sat at the dis
cussion table stated their purpose as
an attempt to picture Japan proper,
its people, its resources, and its fu
ture in the hands of victorious Allies.
The three Stanford professors who
took part in the symposium are
teaching at present in the Far Eastern
Area Unit. The first of these was Dr.
Felix M. Keesing, professor of an
thropology. The second, Dr. John
W. Masland, associate professor of
political science; and the third, C.
Langdon White, professor of geog
raphy.
Dr. Masland first outlined the out
come of the Cairo Conference as a
kind of ''Pacific Charter"; a brief
description of the growth of the Jap
anese Empire by Dr. Keesing fol
lowed. Mr. White completed the in
troduction with a few facts on Japan
proper.
The three men discussed the phe
nomenal progress made by Japan in
both light and heavy industry. "The
whole economy is based on an ad
vanced monopoly basis," said Dr.
Masland. "The chief post-war prob
lem in Japan will be keeping the in
dustrial setup in operation."
The symposium ended with the
presentation of numerous questions
yet to be answered about the post
war international organization of the
Pacific.
