WASHINGTON â€” The American
Federation of Labor and the Con

up solidly against President Roose

request began what promises to be a
rough and historic journey through a
partly hostile Congress.
Mr. Roosevelt, AFL President Wil
liam Green, and CIO President Phil
lip Murray were at the White House
| to discuss the issue after both labor
! chieftans voiced vigorous opposition
! to it.
