POLLARD vs. LUISETTI
There's plenty of action on tap this
weekend for Bay Area basketball
fans, with two major contests sched
uled. Unfortunately, both games will
be played Saturday evening, so it
will be impossible to see them both.
In the game which promises to
provide the better basketball of the
two, Alameda Coast Guard tangles
with St. Mary's Preflight in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium. Mean
while, the University of California
will be playing host to USC in
Berkeley.
Highlighting the game in the Civic
\ud, which figures to draw a capa
city crowd of 6,000, will be a duel
between Seaman Jim Pollard of the
Coast Guard and Lieutenant Hank
Luisetti of the Preflights. Both
earned All-American honors at for
ward while playing for the Stanford
Varsity.
Luisetti is generally recognized as
he best player the game has known.
While at Stanford, he broke practi
cally every collegiate record in the
books, and led the Indians to three
successive Pacific Coast Conference
championships.
Pollard has come closer to equal
ing Hank's brilliance than any other
player seen in these parts since. He
played but one year of varsity ball
for Stanford, and in that one year
(1942), he sparked the team to the
championship of the United States
in the N.C.A.A. playoffs. While not
is good on defense as Luisetti, his
shooting is about on a par with
Hank's, and he possesses the added
advantage of youth.
CONFERENCE BASKETBALL
The California-USC game is the
second of the season in the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Con
ference. The Trojans are defending
their 1943 conference championship,
and unless they can improve tre
mendously over their poor showing
against UCLA last week, it would
.seem as though they were doomed
to failure.
I saw the Trojans blow the opener
to the Bruins last Saturday, 33-19.
and was definitely not impressed by
the ability of the men of Troy. Their
team is badly crippled by the loss of
Messrs. Rock. Omalev, and Seminoff
from last year's championship squad.
As contrasted with the phenomenal
shooting of these three, this year's
team averaged only one field goal out
of every nine attempts. Out of 45
shots taken by the Trojans in the
second half, only five were good.
Nineteen is the lowest number of

points scored by a USC team in a
conference game since 1932.
For my money, the Bruins are the
j team to beat in the Southern Divi-
I sion this year. If they do win, it will
j be the first basketball championship
i in UCLA history.
Two of the five positions on the
Bruins' first string are held down by
former Stanford men. Dave Brown,
a Navy V-12 trainee who also dis
tinguished himself by his play on the
Bruin football team last fall, started
|at one of the forward spots. He
j turned in the best defensive job of
| the evening. At center was Jack
| Heald, another V-12 transfer who
! played with the Stanford Frosh be
fore going to UCLA. Heald was in
| jured early in the first half, but re-
I turned to play most of the second.
The outstanding performer on
UCLA's Bee Team, which licked the
Trojan Jayvees, was Fred Ferrog
giaro, who was a sub forward on the
Stanford Varsity last year. Dick
Blurton, another former Indian, sub
stituted at forward for the Bruin
Bees.

POLLARD vs. LUISETTI
There's plenty of action on tap this
weekend for Bay Area basketball
fans, with two major contests sched
uled. Unfortunately, both games will
be played Saturday evening, so it
will be impossible to see them both.
In the game which promises to
provide the better basketball of the
two, Alameda Coast Guard tangles
with St. Mary's Preflight in the San
Francisco Civic Auditorium. Mean
while, the University of California
will be playing host to USC in
Berkeley.
Highlighting the game in the Civic
\ud, which figures to draw a capa
city crowd of 6,000, will be a duel
between Seaman Jim Pollard of the
Coast Guard and Lieutenant Hank
Luisetti of the Preflights. Both
earned All-American honors at for
ward while playing for the Stanford
Varsity.
Luisetti is generally recognized as
he best player the game has known.
While at Stanford, he broke practi
cally every collegiate record in the
books, and led the Indians to three
successive Pacific Coast Conference
championships.
Pollard has come closer to equal
ing Hank's brilliance than any other
player seen in these parts since. He
played but one year of varsity ball
for Stanford, and in that one year
(1942), he sparked the team to the
championship of the United States
in the N.C.A.A. playoffs. While not
is good on defense as Luisetti, his
shooting is about on a par with
Hank's, and he possesses the added
advantage of youth.
CONFERENCE BASKETBALL
The California-USC game is the
second of the season in the Southern
Division of the Pacific Coast Con
ference. The Trojans are defending
their 1943 conference championship,
and unless they can improve tre
mendously over their poor showing
against UCLA last week, it would
.seem as though they were doomed
to failure.
I saw the Trojans blow the opener
to the Bruins last Saturday, 33-19.
and was definitely not impressed by
the ability of the men of Troy. Their
team is badly crippled by the loss of
Messrs. Rock. Omalev, and Seminoff
from last year's championship squad.
As contrasted with the phenomenal
shooting of these three, this year's
team averaged only one field goal out
of every nine attempts. Out of 45
shots taken by the Trojans in the
second half, only five were good.
Nineteen is the lowest number of

points scored by a USC team in a
conference game since 1932.
For my money, the Bruins are the
j team to beat in the Southern Divi-
I sion this year. If they do win, it will
j be the first basketball championship
i in UCLA history.
Two of the five positions on the
Bruins' first string are held down by
former Stanford men. Dave Brown,
a Navy V-12 trainee who also dis
tinguished himself by his play on the
Bruin football team last fall, started
|at one of the forward spots. He
j turned in the best defensive job of
| the evening. At center was Jack
