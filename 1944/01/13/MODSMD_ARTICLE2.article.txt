# Columbia Plans New Program
## 
### 
In his annual report to the Presi
dent of Columbia University, Dean
Robert Calkins of the Columbia Uni
versity School of Business an
nounced that entrance requirements
for the first three postwar years
were to be revised to fit war veterans
needs.
Dean Calkins stated that these re
visions were important because
many soldiers will be impatient with
Undergraduate requirements, and
that there may be a general trend
toward the business profession. Men
who were preparing for law, archi
tecture, and other professions, as
well as mature men who have had
little previous college training, will
want to enter business because of its
comparatively short training period.
Dean Calkins said that soldiers'
previous training was being taken
into consideration in planning the
new program. Furthermore, an ef
fort will be made to give a wide view
of fields outside of business because
leadership by businessmen will be
essential in preventing a postwar de
pression. Refresher and "special in
struction" courses will be given.
