EVANSTON. 111. (UP)—Stellar at- I
tractions for 1i)44 include two eclipses j
of the sun, announced Professor
Oliver J. Lee,.director of Dearborn |
Observatory at Northwestern Uni- j
versity.
"Despite the upheavals of global
war," Lee said, "the universe will
proceed with only a minimum of as
tronomical disturbances. No bright
comets are expected this year."
According to Professor Lee, ce
lestial activity will include a total
eclipse Jan. 25. The path of totality,
he said, will extend from a point on
the equator south of California,
across South America from Peru to
Brazil, and end in the Sahara Desert
about 1.000 miles south of Oran. Only
in two continents, South America

and parts of Africa, will the eclipse
be visible.
The second eclipse—the annular or
ring, shaped—will occur on July 20,
Lee said. It will begin in Uganda,
East Africa, passing over India, the
island of Mindanao in the Philip
pines, and will terminate after cross
ing New Britain Island.
