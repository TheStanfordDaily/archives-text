THIS IS only the fourth issue of Volume 105 of The Daily, and as
yet there have come into the office no letters addressed "To
the Editor."
In case anyone has forgotten, The Daily runs a column en- j
titled "Campus Opinion." Letters sent in to the column deal
with all sorts of things—gripes, praises, thanks, opinions, com-;
ments. Editorial board reserves the right to exclude any letter :
which for some reason doesn't belong in the column, and all con- j
tributors are asked to sign their names, although they may re-!
quest that their names not be printed.
The last editor, Jane Glasson, said that since The Daily has
about 5,000 readers, a whisper, when printed, turns into a shout.,
And so, if you have anything to shout about, write a letter.
