### JEAN LEVINSON 
I am in a most unfortunate situation this quarter. Somehow or
other by the grace of Allah and the Time Schedule I have three
consecutive classes in the same room. If you have never spent
three hours in the same chamber you cannot know what this
means. You enter the room at 9 in the morning, choose for your
self a fine-grained wood chair, and settle down for 15 minutes
to thaw out before the professor arrives, at which time you set
your face into a mold that will portray: "Shoot the facts to me â€”
I'm dyin' for more knowledge." Then with your trusty writing
instrument in hand, you proceed to take diligent hieroglyphics
for the next 50 minutes. The bell rings, the chimes chime, the
chairs scrape, the papers rattle, and you head for your next class.
But no, this is the next classroom again, remember? So you dash
for the door, take a quick gulp of fresh fog, and sprint back to
the same four walls .... and go through the same routine for
another factual 50 minutes. Now you leap up from your fine
grained wood chair and prepare to briskly stroll down the Quad
in order to see what Marybelle and Lena are wearing today, and
who's talking to whom. But no! Aaah! It's ever back again to the
cell for another go at education. By now the faces of your fellow
students that had looked so eager and happy have become gray
blobs; the voice of the professor has grown into a steady flow of
static, and the walls are evily leering at you. "Never again," you
say to yourself as you wend your way home on a stretcher at
noon.
Attention all you maidens who call yourselves "lock-out
chairmen." Be sure to visit Dede DeFriest in her office today
between one and two. This is extremely vital, necessary, well,
honestly, it's awfully important. For further information see the
front page of this paper immediately.
