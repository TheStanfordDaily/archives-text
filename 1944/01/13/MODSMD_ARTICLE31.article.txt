# Blind Worker Solves Riddle Of Production

### 
MINNEAPOLIS, Minn. (UP)—The
supersensitive touch of a blind de
fense worker at the Minneapolis-
Honeywell Co., Mrs. Delcie Jordan,
solved the mystery of the "singing
papers" which had baffled engineers
and slowed production of anti-air
craft gunsights for months.
In the manufacture and assembly
of the gunsights, lenses and prisms
and other optical compounds are as
sembled and mounted in air-condi
tioned rooms by workers wearing
specially laundered smocks to keep
dust from clothes out of the lenses.
A speck of dust only 1/10,000 th of
an inch in size would look like a
bomber to a gunsighter if it fell on
his sighting piece, so these special
precautions are essential. Workers
are not permitted to touch the optics
with their hands, so they hold'the
lenses in surgical forceps and clean
them first with chemicals, then run
a small vacuum hose over them to
pick up stray dust particles.
Little cones of lintless paper—
called "snozzles" by the workers—
are fitted over tips of vacuum hoses
to prevent scratching of lens sur
faces. But use of the cones created a
first-class headache for company ex
perts. Quite frequently, the cones
vibrated when air was sucked
through, causing them to "sing"—
simultaneously spraying thousands
of tiny particles, which meant a
complete recleaning job and produc
tion delays.
Mrs. Jordan, who has been with
the company since the war started,
makes the "snozzles." One day she
felt the almost imperceptible grain
of the paper with her sharply sensi
tive fingers and noticed that when
the "snozzles" were cut with the
grain they did not sing, and that
when they were cut across the grain
they did. It was simple after that to
cut the "snozzles" correctly.
The result was considerably boost
ed production for the company and a
fine reward via the employees' sug
gestion system for Mrs. Jordan.
