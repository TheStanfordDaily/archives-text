MISTRESS PITCHER, '43
Mollis Pilchcr, a heroine
Whom everyone ought to know,
Manned a gun on the tiring line
In '76 or so.
Undeterred by the shot and shell
She aimed a cannon and aimed it well
And blasted the Redcoats, sword and gaiter,
In '76 —or was it later?
Mistress Pitcher of ' i3
(May the Gods of Battle bless ' er!)
Is doing the same, to keep us iree,
As her rollicking predecessor.
For Mollie P. in the current war
Is tiring a gun from her kitchen door—
That cannon may boom with a boom that's loudei
She's saving the fats that make the powder.
She saves the drippings, she saves the grease,
From skillet and pot and pan
That once in piping-er times of peace
Went out to the garbage can.
And when it's clean as a strainer makes it,
The butcher buys it, the renderer takes it,
And Mollie's hoard (I repeat but facts) is
Soon explosive to smash the Axis.
So maybe a boy in Tunis, now
Where the Nazi legions dawdle,
Or maybe a lad on a hidden bough
In the jungle hell of Guadal,
Or a soldier sent on a Ranger's mission,
Will praise the Lord and his ammunition.
And Mollie Pitcher—the modern one —
Will be the lady behind his gun.
