According to Mrs. Robert E. Franck,

Dimes," Stanford pledges, still out
standing, will boost the sum to $550.

>vor.st epidemic of infantile paralysis
since 1931, with 12,000 cases reported
f o Surgeon General Thomas Parran
up to the end of September. Cali
fornia and Chicago were the two
areas most afflicted, and Palo Alto
alone had 22 cases in 1943. The ratio
tias made the available funds for
polio treatment inadequate in this
locality. Mrs. Franck reports that
although $1,000 was spent by Jan. 1,
L 944, the funds did not begin to meet
