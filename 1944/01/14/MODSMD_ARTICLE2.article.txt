LONDON. â€”U.S. Eighth Air Force Headquarters an
announced tonight that at least 152 German fighters
were shot down in the great air battle over Germany
Tuesday, when American bombers, whose losses have
risen to 60, hammered the railroad center of Bieleseld
and the armament-producing town of Metten besides
blasting three of Germany's fighter plane plants.
Calculations of Nazi losses, greatest since the Luft-

waffe lost 307 planes during the Schweinfurt-Riegens
burg shuttle raid Aug. 17, 1943, still were incomplete
and there were indications that the final figure might
be much higher..
One hundred and twenty-five enemy planes were
destroyed by the fleet of more than 7,000 Flying Fort
resses and Liberators in one of history's fiercest air
battles, while American fighters, estimated to number
500-700 accounted for 27.
