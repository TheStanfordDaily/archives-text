# Critic Brands Iron Major As Stereotpye

THE IRON MAJOR—Now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
R-K-O's "The Iron Major" depicts
in a humdrum and listless manner
the life story of the late Frank Cav
anaugh, football coach at Dartmouth,
Boston College, and Fordham. Ruth
Warrick portray's Cavanaugh's wife
while Robert Ryan, one of Holly
wood's newest finds, is seen as "The
Iron Major's" best friend.
The story begins its uninteresting
tale in Cavanaugh's high school foot
ball days, follows him through Dart
mouth University and his unsuccess
ful law pursuit, and then pictures his
marriage and career as a football
coach. Cavanaugh's days as a coach
are interrupted in 1917 when he en
ters the Army and earns the title of
"The Iron Major."
"The Iron Major" is another of Pat
O'Brien's "Hard as nails on the out
side but with a heart of gold" roles
with Pat as his usual pugnacious
self. Miss Warrick is pleasant as
O'Brien's faithful wife. The picture
suffers mainly from its stereotyped
plot and action. In fact, all it seems
the late Mr. Cavanaugh was able to
say were those immortal words, "Get
out there and fight, boys." —Bower
