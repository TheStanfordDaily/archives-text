Somebody tacked a newspaper
clipping onto the bulletin board of
the Men's Gym a lew days ago that
attracted quite a bit ol' attention.
The headline read, "Why Can't
Cards, Broncos Follow Idaho's Ex
ample?" It seems that the University
of Idaho, which gave up football this
fall because of the lack of available
men. is planning to field teams in all
other sports. Chief reason given for
Stanford's dropping all inter-colle
giate sports is the man-power short
age, yet Idaho has only 250 civilian
men compared to over 800 here.
When Everett Dean, basketball
coach, announced that basketball
would be given as a gym class, 85
men signed up, while othei's were
turned away becau.se the class was
too large. A basketball squad can be
formed with as few as 10 men.
There is still plenty of interest in
other sports, both major and minor.
A fencing team is being formed of
Stanford students, but because of the
University's ban on sports will be
unable to play as a Stanford team.
Instead, the squad will enter com
petition as an independent fencing
team.
The same is true for all sports. The
men want to play, and should be
given the chance, not forced to enter
competition independently.
