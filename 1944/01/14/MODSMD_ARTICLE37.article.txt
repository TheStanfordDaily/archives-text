# Coach To Handle Two College Jobs
## 
### 
The Wartime manpower shortage
has hit two small Mid-Western col
leges with a vengeance. The result is
one of the oddest arrangements yet
heard of.
A. C. Burcky, regular coach at
Bluffton College, is going to coach
both the Bluffton basketball team
and the team of Ohio Northern Uni
versity. Bluffton's deadly rival. Mil
lard Murphy, coach of Ohio Northern,
has been drafted, leaving nobody to
handle his coaching chores, so Coach
Burcky has volunteered to take over
the job for the rest of the year.
