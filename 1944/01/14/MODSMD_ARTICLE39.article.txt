# MURAL BASKETBALL
## Civilian League Signs 11 Teams 
### 
Thus far 11 civilian teams have
signed up for competition in Winter
Quarter intra-mural basketball. One
more team is needed before the final
schedule of games can be made out.
Coach Harry Wolter. director oi in
tra-mural athletics, believes that this
quarter's basketball will meet with
more success than did the football
of last quarter because of the soldier
and civilian teams being divided into
two leagues. Each civilian team will
play one game a week at 7:15 on
either Monday, Wednesday, or
Thursday.
The soldiers are conducting their
own intra-mural basketball signups,
and the games will be played at 9:30.
Thus far 11 companies as well as
headquarters are organizing teams.
Two teams from each company and
two from headquarters, 24 in all,
will enter competition. Because of
the large number, each team will
play two games per night. Eight
games involving four teams will be
played on each of the three nights of
the week.
Near the end of the quarter there
will be a play-off between the win
ners of each league championship.
Last quarter there was a great deal
of difficulty in arranging a time
which would be convenient to both
civilians and soldiers. This division
into two leagues has eliminated
many of the controversies of last
quarter. One more civilian team is
needed for the completion of the
schedule. The team manager should
register his squad on the bulletin
board at the Encina Gym.
