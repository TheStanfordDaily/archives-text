THE REVISED Austin-Wadsworth bill for na
tional service provides that when voluntary
recruitment of necessary workers fails, labor
may be conscripted through local selective
service boards. All able-bodied men between
18 and 65 would be subject to such a labor draft,
while women from 18 to 50, except those with
small children, or expectant mothers, also could
be assigned. Workers assigned to industry
certifying a need would receive the prevailing
wage rates, would have their transportation
furnished, would be guaranteed adeguate
housing, and would be protected in their right
to re-employment at their original jobs.
Of the proposal for such service, President
Roosevelt said, "our fighting men abroad—and
their families at home —expect such a program
and have the right to insist upon it. It is to their
demands that this government should pay heed
rather than to the whining demands of selfish
pressure groups who seek to feather their nests
while young Americans are dying."
But William Green, president of the American
Federation of Labor, stated it would "undermine
our basic concepts of democracy."
Mr. Green has a somewhat narrow concep
tion of democracy and the democratic process.
By definition, democracy is based on a direct
participation by each individual citizen in the
various legislative and administrative processes
of his government. This sharing of responsi
bility is essential in peacetime to insure that the
system will be maintained, and is vitally neces
sary for the successful prosecution of a war,
should the Union be obliged to defend its right
to national existence.
Democracy does not automatically extend to
individuals or groups the right to use war for
the purpose of private profit—"profits in money
or in terms of political or social preferment."
"If ever there was a time to subordinate indi
vidual or group selfishness to the national good,
that time is now. Disunity at home—bickerings,
self-seeking, partisanship, stoppages of work,
inflation, business as usual, politics as usual,
luxury as usual—these are the influences which
can undermine the morale of the brave men
ready to die at the front for us here."
The President does not advocate the passage
of a national service law unless "other laws
were passed to keep down the cost of living, to
share eguitably the burdens of taxation, to hold
the stabilization line, and to prevent undue
profits."
Almost every citizen will agree at once that
the principle, "fair for one, fair for all," is only
right and just, that the citizen should try to con
tribute as much to the war effort on the home
front, as did, for example, 1,026 Marines at
Tarawa.
Unfortunately, the individual citizen has dif
ficulty making himself heard in Congress.
There are the "pests" in Washington, "repre
senting these special groups as opposed to the
basic interests of the Nation as a whole." Ap
parently the congressional reaction to the

President's message is based upon the pressure
of the pests, rather than the inclination and
desire of the individual citizen in the United
States.
But the President has pointed out the only
reasonable, equitable course for the Nation to
follow, in the coming months of what will be
The people must direct Congress to answer
