# Mrs. Herbert Hoover

### 
NOT MANY present Stanford students knew
Mrs. Herbert Hoover personally. Perhaps many
knew of her only through her activities with
the Girl Scouts or because of the fact that she
was not so long ago The First Lady.
Mrs. Hoover's many friends in Palo Alto and
on campus will pay her tribute this afternoon
at 4 in the Memorial Church. As a graduate of
the class of 1898 and as a campus resident for
25 years, she showed herself to be truly inter
ested in the welfare of Stanford and the entire
Stanford Family.
