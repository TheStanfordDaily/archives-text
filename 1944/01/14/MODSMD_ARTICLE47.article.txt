There's a good deal going on this weekend
that should be taken advantage of by all. It's
the Cardinals' post-reg dance to be given to
morrow night in the Women's Gym .... from
9 to 12. The reason it's a good deal is because:
(1) the price is embarrassingly cheap and
easy on the coin purse and for 55 coppers a
couple you instantly gain admittance;
2) because T. Dorsey and the boys were un
able to appear Saturday night, you will be able
to hear the choicest melodies played by the
choicest bands, by way of those marvelous
black discs that will be spinning all evening;
(3) because you needn't fret about what to
wear .... it's informal, and so the masculine
half of the couple has merely to brush off his
uniform or don his tweed jacket (according to
his status in or out of our armed forces); and
the gals need only look their alluring, exotic
selves;
(4) because this dance offers a rare oppor
tunity for all you potential Fred Astaires and
Ginger Rogers' to display your terpsichorean
talents under cover of soft lights;
(5) because you'll see your friends and have
one swell time .... now will you go?
For those of you who have not been informed
as yet, Ram's Head, Stanford's Dramatic Society,
is presenting three original One-Act Plays on
the 25th and 26th of February. Sooo, everyone
who is interested in writing a One-Act Play
had better get busy and put it down on paper
and submit it within the next two weeks to
Moofie Faris, Ram's Head president. This is a
wonderful chance to see your own play pro
duced on stage, and if it is accepted, you auto
matically become a member of this fine, up
standing organization! Furthermore, this af
fords splendid practice for rusty typists or poor
penmen .... so get going, it's really worth
while.
