The Editor:
Yesterday's Daily carried a story to the ef
fect that the University library staff was com
pletely filled, therefore students need not ap
ply for work there. The hours of the library
were to remain the same.
Last quarter the excuse for the library
schedule, which is inconvenient to everyone
except the library, was that it was understaffed.
If the library has plenty of people now, and
more are anxious to work, why not hire them
and give students —instead of the library —
a break?
