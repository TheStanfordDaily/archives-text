# AXIS CLAIMS AMERICANS BOMB ROME

### 
l LONDON.â€”Axis broadcasts said tonight that about
90 American planes had bombed "inhabited quarters"
in Rome at noon, losing three of their number to de
fending aircraft, and asserted some of the planes flew
over Vatican City.
There was no immediate confirmation of the Axis

statement in Allied quarters. Two previous daylight
raids on Rome were made by American planes, from
North Africa, and since that time Allied airmen have
atacked German transports in the Rome area although
not in the city itself.
The German controlled Rome Radio was the first to
report the city had been bombed.
