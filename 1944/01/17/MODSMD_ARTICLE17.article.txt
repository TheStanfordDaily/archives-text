# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
All of last guarter we brooded about the situation of no sports
at Stanford. Over the 10 days between guarters we heard many
comments to the effect that Stanford was afraid to field teams.
This set off the firing pin in our bomb and now we are burning
mad, and want to see something done about it.
There are many men on this campus who have the ability and
talent and could well uphold Stanford's name in the sporting
world. A school gets more credit for playing and losing, than
for not playing at all, no matter what the circumstances. Although
UCLA won only one game last football season, they still re
ceived much praise for being good sports. After all, what is the
main purpose of having inter-collegiate sports in the first place,
just to build a name for the school and make money for it, or to
provide recreation and physical development for the men com
peting?
â€¢ It should not be the latter, but it seems that Stanford has placed
itself in the former category. It would not have been difficult
tor Stanford to field an excellent basketball team. May we remind
hose concerned that it takes only 10 men to field a decent team.
This gripe is the echo of many of the civilian men on campus,'
and although we do not think it will alter the sports policy at
Stanford, it is the opinion of many people all over the nation that
we are afraid to risk our reputation of having great teams. If we
were to field teams and lose every game, our standing in the
minds of these people would certainly improve.
