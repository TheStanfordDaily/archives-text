# Stan ford Bill Stars Davis In Love Melee
## 
### 
OLD ACQUAINTANCE -Now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Warner Brothers' "Old Acquaint
ance" is a sentimental melee of love
and laughter that gives Bette Davis
a chance to display her dramatic tal
ents of a lighter vein. Miriam Hop
kins is seen as la Davis's "best
friend" while John Loder is cast as
Miss Hopkins' harried husband.
The film begins as Miss Davis, a
famous authoress, visits Miss Hop
kins to renew acquaintanceship. The
latter, motivated by jealousy, also
becomes a prominent novelist, but in
doing so loses husband Loder. The
years roll on and Bette falls in love
with suave Gig Young, only to lose
him to Loder's daughter, and so
Bette and Miriam face the coming
years as "old acquaintances."
Miss Davis gives her role strength
and vibrancy while Miss Hopkins is
excellent as the selfish, self-centered
"best friend." The picture, which is
too long and talky, has plenty of
feminine appeal but may seem just
so much nonsense to those of the
sterner sex.
Are you physically fit? Can YOU
stand 65 minutes of agonizing tor
ture? You'll know the answer when
you see the second feature at the
Stanford, "Campus Rhythm." â€”
