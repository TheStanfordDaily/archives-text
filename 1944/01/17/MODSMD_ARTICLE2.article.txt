### 
Plans for group YYVCA meetings
for Winter Quarter were discussed
yesterday afternoon in a cabinet
meeting held at theh ome of Miss
Pat. according to Marybeth Smith,
president of Stanford's "Y." Each
chairman who was present gave a
brief resume of her group's activities
|uring Fall Quarter, and proposed
plans for this one.
As a part of the introductory pro
cedure, the "Y" plans to give a mem
bership tea, and to sponsor activities
which will help new freshman and
transfer women to become acquaint
ed. Likewise the "Y" will be hostess
to the new WAC's on the campus at
some future date.
The cabinet decided because of the
rapid change in plans of students at
present it would be wise to have a
co-chairman working in each group
with the chairman already appointed,
so that she would obtain the proper
experience necessary to take over
the office in acse of emergency. All
women who would be intersted in
serving as co-chairman of one of the
various "Y" groups are urged to
notify either the chairman or Miss
Pat.
