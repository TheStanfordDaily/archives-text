After a financial report, the coun

the Southern California tournaments
in the spring and to contribute $5 to
the publicity fund for the local dis
cussion contest of Inter-American
Affairs to be held Feb. 9 in the Edu
cation Auditorium.
The debate squad will meet at 8:30
p.m. instead of 7:30 p.m. next

earlier hour, according to Director
James G. Emerson.
All members should remind stu
dents to come prepared to speak on
the topics chosen at the last meeting.
