# Wallet Photos Amuse Staff

### MELLON SHELTON 
When the special delivery man,
"Mr. Chips," discovered a wallet of
pictures somewhere between Roble
and Lagunita last week, little did he
realize that he was starting a minor
mystery. The wallet, which abounds
with pictures of beautiful men and
women (or boys and girls), was
promptly turned in to the Daily of
fice and has been languishing there
in the hope that someone might come
in who knows the owner. In the
meantime the staff members have
become desperate trying to recognize
a Stanford man or woman among the
gallery included.
Having reached the conclusion that
the wallet belongs either to a Roble
or Lagunita woman, or to a civilian
man or Army student who may have
lost it on his way to or from Roble
or Lagunita, frustrated members of
the Daily staff are turning the wallet
in to the cashier's office where the
owner may claim it. Anyone inter
ested in seeing some good pictures
may go to the cashier's office and
view them for a reasonable fee.
