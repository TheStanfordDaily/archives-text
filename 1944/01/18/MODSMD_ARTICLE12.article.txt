### JEAN LEVINSON 
"MY DAY"
Kissing Franklin goodbye, and bidding a hurried adieu to
3istie, Buzzie, and Fala, I boarded my renovated bomber and
(lew like the wind to California. After landing in the La Brea Tar
Pits, I spent several fascinating days in Los Angeles, and arrived
in Daly City yesterday.
My but I am impressed with this quaint, picturesque little
metropolis; let me tell you a little more about it.
Daly City is gloriously colorful with its many markets and
grocery stores, whose shelves are laden with rationed goodies.
While leisurely meandering down the street I also noticed mov
ing picture houses, dry goods shops, street cars, and children
... indeed a unique community.
One of the friendly citizens came up to me and said by way
Df greeting: "You on the graveyard shift too, Mabel?" I thought
'.his a splendid sample of the folkways of these warm-hearted
people and was reminded of a similar greeting given me by one
ol the natives inhabiting an island visited by me in the South
°acific.
Cutting through a path in the jungle with the aid of my
machete .... presented to me by the Girl Scouts of America
[ came face to face with a scantily clad native. Quickly recover
ing from his faint (he was a hearty fellow) he said: "Ughawa
clumbara zip gromp bird gorp," which translated means: "Gimme
a package of Beeman's Pepsin Chewin' Gum please." Which
only goes to show that clothes do not make the man!
While in Daly City I visited the Blood Bank and gladly gave a
pint of my blood, gladly, because this is an extremely worthy
cause and I was glad to do it. I also attended a bandage rolling
session, a workers' meeting, and a Gin Rummy contest, so that
[ felt on departing that I had gotten a rounded out, true cross
section of this busy village .... a vertebra in the backbone of
America.
Remember all of you who have problems that need solving
. . . affairs of the heart, money trouble, or problems of etiquette
... be sure and write me a letter telling all, and I will gladly try
to help you out of your dilemma.

only goes to show that clothes do not make the man!
While in Daly City I visited the Blood Bank and gladly gave a
pint of my blood, gladly, because this is an extremely worthy
cause and I was glad to do it. I also attended a bandage rolling
session, a workers' meeting, and a Gin Rummy contest, so that
[ felt on departing that I had gotten a rounded out, true cross
section of this busy village .... a vertebra in the backbone of
America.
Remember all of you who have problems that need solving
. . . affairs of the heart, money trouble, or problems of etiquette
... be sure and write me a letter telling all, and I will gladly try
to help you out of your dilemma.
