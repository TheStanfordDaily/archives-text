To the Editor:
Never in my 11 quarters at Stanford have I been so revolted
as at the spectacle which I witnessed in the Memorial Church
on Sunday. Must Stanford lose prestige by such a trite imita
tion of a high school installation? The presence of our distin
guished visitor made the situation embarrassing as well as
tedious. Most of the student body did not see its new president
take office; it is well that so many were spared the sad sight.
In a day when the administrative head of Stanford publicly
assumes office by delivering an informal address it would seem
more fitting to have the student leaders take over their duties
unceremoniously. In the past the chapel services have celebrated
the opening of new school terms with suitable readings, and the
faithful joined in prayers that the lofty aims of college be main
tained. It has been an impressive tradition to hear student officers
trom the chancel; it is unfortunate that they are now involved in
a new tradition of empty display.
Perhaps Chapel Board can see the flaws in the tradition which
it has started. I appeal to the board to save Stanford from a second
inauguration. /ane Gilliland.
