Yesterday two items were printed
in the Daily which attacked Stan
ford's wartime policy on intercol
legiate athletics. Feeling that it is
only fair to print both sides of the
question, I decided to investigate the
mailer more thoroughly. 1 found
that there are some very significant
facts, facts which should be made
known before we attempt to arrive at
a decision, in support of the other
side of the question.
In the first place, the decision to
drop intercollegiate sports for the
duration was not made without con
sulting any of the students; il was
made unanimously by the Stanford
Board of Athletic Control. The
B.A.C. included three student mem
bers who were electcd by the student
jfedy. The decision reached by the
was based upon some of the
following considerations:
With our country at war, our chief
duty and purpose, as individuals and
as a university, must be to contribute
to the winning of the war. Stan
ford's contribution includes the
granting of a large part of our facili
ties (up to 80 per cent by contract)
for use in the training of Army men.
These men are strictly prohibited by
Army ruling from engaging in inter
collegiate athletics.
Coaching Personnel
We lack the coaching personnel
which would be needed to prepare
teams for competition. The coaches
we have now are doing a strenuous
full-time job in handling the Army
and civilian physical training pro
grams. This program has much more
than doubled since peacetime, when
only Lower Division men were re
quired to spend three hours a week
in gym classes. Now practically all
civilian men do this, and in addition,
2.000 Army men are required to have
six hours of physical training a week.
To meet this situation, we have on
hand a much smaller coaching staff
than we had in peacetime, with many
of our coaches in the service.
We are under contract to the Army
to provide adequate physical train
ing for the men stationed here. It
would lie physically impossible for
us to fulfill this obligation conscien
'•iiisly and stage a program of intcr
llegiate athletics as well.

The decision to abandon competi
tion was definitely not made be
cause we were afraid of losing games
or risking our reputation. Had we
been influenced by such motives as
these, we would certainly have .aban
doned basketball in the long lean
years before 193G, and football in
the dark 1939 season, when we failed
to win a single Coast Conference
game.
Permission to One Man
Nor would it be fair or courageous
to give permission to represent the
University to one man, to competi
tors in a single sport, or in a few se
lected sports. This would leave
Stanford wide open to criticism as a
school which enters men and teams
only in events in which we have a
good chance ol winning, but which is
too cowardly to field teams in all
sports.
As far as providing "recreation and

| physical development for the men
competing" is concerned, intramural
sports can do just as good a job of
this as intercollegiate athletics—in
face, better in certain respects. Mu
rals provide these things for the mass
of the students, not as spectators, but
as participants.
Don't get me wrong; I am all for
the return of intercollegiate sports,
as strongly as anyone could he. I
am convinced that the Administra
tion is, too. However, the facts are
that such sports are a "wartime
casualty," and that if we are to win
the battle of returning competition
in them to Stanford, we must first
; win the war.
