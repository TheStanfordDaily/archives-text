# Girl Aerodynamic Engineer Now No 'Fabulous Incident'
## 
### JIM FORD 
There once was a time when a
woman who knew more about engi
neering than how to adjust the
brushes on a vacuum cleaner was
considered a bold intruder into a
forbidden man's world of screw
drivers and monkey wrenches.
And for a respectable girl to be
come an aerodynamic technician was
only a fabulous incident which
might occur in radio serials like
"Sally Schlitz, Girl Sand-hog."
But then came the war, and the
shocking of yesterday has passed to
the sublime of today, as we witness
such events as the recent graduation
from Rensselaer Polytechnic Insti
tute in Troy, N.Y., of 84 women who
had completed an engineering cur
riculum training them as technicians
for Curtiss-Wright propeller plants.
These women, recruited by Cur
tiss-Wright and called Curtiss-

Wright Cadettes, will fill basic posi
tions in war plants formerly held by
men graduate engineers who have
been promoted to more important
technical duties.
The typical cadette, when she en
tered the Curtiss-Wright program
last February, had had slightly more
than two years in college and nearly
two years of college mathematics.
Her streamlined curriculum included
Engineering Mathematics, Elements
of Machine Drawing, Engineering
Mechanics, Elements of Aerody
namics, Stress Analysis, and other
similarly fast-paced courses.
During the 10 months' training,
only 13 of the original 97 cadettes
had dropped from the program.
Skeptical at first, faculty members
now seem agreed that educationally
the experiment had proved success
ful. Whether the girls will make
good on the job is another question,
yet to be answered.
Other colleges selected by Curtiss-
Wright to train over 700 more ca
dettes in similar programs include:
Cornell, lowa State College, Minne
sota, Pennsylvania State College,
Purdue, and the University of Texas.
