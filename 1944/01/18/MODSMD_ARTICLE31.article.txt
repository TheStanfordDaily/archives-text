# Stanford Carilloneur Returns
## 
### 
Jim Lawson, Stanford's official
carilloneur, has just returned to the
campus after a year-and-a-half ca
reer in the Army, and will resume
his carillon programs from the Hoo
ver Library tower this week. He
was back in time to play for Mrs.
Hoover's funeral services Friday.
Lawson, one of approximately 25
people in America trained to play
the carillon, is working toward an
M.A. degree in English here. He
came to Stanford first in October,
1941 and played throughout the year.
Since last Summer Quarter the
carillon recitals have been given by
Pvt. Maurice Forshaw, who has also
been serving as assistant organist in
Memorial Church.
Lawson announced that he would
play a 20-minute concert at noon
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sat
urday, and a special 30-minute con
cert every Sunday afternoon at 1:30.
These times have been arranged, he
said, in order not to conflict with
class periods or the library schedule.
There is also a possibility of an eve
ning recital.
The music to be played will in
clude a large group of the standard

I repertoire of carillon music, com
j posed principally by Belgians. (The
| Stanford carillon, incidentally, was
j a gift of the Belgian government to
\ Herbert Hoover for his food relief
efforts in the First World War.)
Much of this music Lawson has per
j sonally copied from libraries in Chi-
I cago and Florida, and he has also
j made his own arrangements of
! numerous other selections.
Lawson took his training as as-
I sistant carilloneur at the University
of Chicago, playing in the Rocke
! feller Chapel there. During his fur
loughs while in the Army, he has
played guest recitals in various parts
of the country. From his camp at
! Arkansas he went several times to
( play in the Chicago chapel where he
began his training. While
in Florida he presented a
I from the famous Singing Tower at
j Lake Wales; and he also played in
| Lincoln, Neb.
"Playing the carillon," Lawson
| says, "requires the talents of a ballet
| artist, a jiu jitsu expert, and a musi-
J cian all in one." And he added, "I'm
j hopeful that my music this quarter
| will help lift the general morale of
• the student body."

Hoover's funeral services Friday.
Lawson, one of approximately 25
people in America trained to play
the carillon, is working toward an
M.A. degree in English here. He
came to Stanford first in October,
1941 and played throughout the year.
Since last Summer Quarter the
carillon recitals have been given by
Pvt. Maurice Forshaw, who has also
been serving as assistant organist in
Memorial Church.
Lawson announced that he would
play a 20-minute concert at noon
every Tuesday, Thursday, and Sat
urday, and a special 30-minute con
cert every Sunday afternoon at 1:30.
These times have been arranged, he
said, in order not to conflict with
class periods or the library schedule.
There is also a possibility of an eve
ning recital.
The music to be played will in
clude a large group of the standard

I repertoire of carillon music, com
j posed principally by Belgians. (The
| Stanford carillon, incidentally, was
j a gift of the Belgian government to
\ Herbert Hoover for his food relief
efforts in the First World War.)
Much of this music Lawson has per
j sonally copied from libraries in Chi-
I cago and Florida, and he has also
j made his own arrangements of
! numerous other selections.
Lawson took his training as as-
I sistant carilloneur at the University
of Chicago, playing in the Rocke
! feller Chapel there. During his fur
loughs while in the Army, he has
played guest recitals in various parts
of the country. From his camp at
! Arkansas he went several times to
( play in the Chicago chapel where he
began his training. While
in Florida he presented a
I from the famous Singing Tower at
j Lake Wales; and he also played in
| Lincoln, Neb.
"Playing the carillon," Lawson
| says, "requires the talents of a ballet
| artist, a jiu jitsu expert, and a musi-
J cian all in one." And he added, "I'm
j hopeful that my music this quarter
| will help lift the general morale of
• the student body."
Jim Lawson, Stanford's official
carilloneur, has just returned to the
campus after a year-and-a-half ca
reer in the Army, and will resume
his carillon programs from the Hoo
ver Library tower this week. He
was back in time to play for Mrs.
Hoover's funeral services Friday.
