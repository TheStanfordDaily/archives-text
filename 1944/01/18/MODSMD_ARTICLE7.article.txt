# California Challenges Stanford To Bond Sale Contest for Axe
## 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
The Associated Students of the
University of California yesterday
challenged the Stanford student
body to a "Big Game" War Bond
Drive, with the Axe, now in Stan
ford's possession, as the prize.
The contest was originally pro
posed by Joan Selby, chairman of the
University of California War Board,
and Alice Gay lo ret, Chairman of
Stamp and Bond Sales, as a contest
between the women students of the
two universities. In the original
challenge it was hinted that the Axe
might be used as a prize.
However, Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president and Carol Hurwitz, War
Board Coordinator, felt that if such
a contest were held, it should be an
all-student affair, and so Cal then
challenged the entire Stanford stu
dent body to a contest.
Students Will Decide
In connection with the use of the
Axe as a prize for the winner, Dick
Driscoll stated last night, "Cal has
| challenged us as sportsmen, and as
i sportsmen it is our duty to accept the
challenge. However it is beyond the
power of the student officers to de
cide whether or not the Axe should
be used as a trophy in such a con
j test.
"The Axe is a symbol of Stanford
student spirit and we must turn to
the student body to decide whether
or not the occasion warrants risking"
; the Axe," he said.
Carol Hurwitz voiced a similar
I opinion when she stated, "We must
| accept the challenge, but the stu
: dents must decide whether the Axe
should be the trophy put up."
Proportional Basis
According to the letter received
| from California, the proposed con-
I test, to be held in cooperation with
the Fourth War Loan Drive, will be
; put on a proportional basis so that
j Stanford will not be at a disadvan
j tage with a smaller student body.
The contest would start on Sunday,
Jtm. 30, and end one week later on
Feb. 5, which will be California's
War Labor Day.
Joan Selby stated last night that
i the student body at California was
j all in favor of having the Axe as a
! trophy, that the idea has been taking
j the campus by storm.
Driscoll hopes that a cross section
;of Stanford student body opinion
1 may he obtained through Campus
; Opinion letters written to The Daily.


Scenes like the one above follow in the wake of victorious Russian
Armies, as peasants return to their homes in recaptured villages.
But homes often do not exist, for battle shelling and bombing anil
Nazi plundering leave them razed.
