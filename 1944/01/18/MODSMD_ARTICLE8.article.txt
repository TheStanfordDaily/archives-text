# Niebuhr Opens West Lectures; Will Give Second Tonight On Tolerance in Democracy
## 
### JAMES EMERSON 
Speaking before a large, receptive
audience at the Memorial Audito
rium, I)r. Reinhold Niebuhr, Profes
sor of Applied Christianity at Union
Theological Seminary, gave the first
of three lectures in the Raymond
Fred West Memorial series.
The basis of Dr. Niebuhr's convic
| tion is that democracy represents a
j permanent contribution to man's ex
| istence, and is not just a luxury. Man
j needs the community, and the com
j munity is dependent on man. The
I difficulty arises, however, he said, in
! combining the claims of human free
j dom and of the community. Democ
racy has tried to do this, but the
! presupposition upon which democ
racy is founded is not profound
enough to save society from the evils
! of the future.
j Two Ideas
There are two ideas about society,
! he continued, the individualistic idea
I represented by the Nazis, and the
' collective idea as seen in Marx.
"Both the individualists and the col
j lectivists are wrong," said Niebuhr.
| "in thinking they could solve the
! problem by the simple manipulation
of dogmas." The individualist took
individual freedom and justified that
, action in the natioA. The Marxists
: tried to work a scheme whereby all
| individual desires and ideas would
| "be brought into a common wheel."
There is some truth in Marx's so
icalization, Niebuhr stated, but it
1 must not be carried to the extreme.
| Marx resolves the problem into one
! of property and private enterprise,
j but the problem of property is so
complex that it is not solved by a
simple dogma. Marx does not under
stand the history of man and is pic-
I turing a Utopian condition which
could never be attained. Further
more, Dr. Niebuhr claimed that there
were many solutions, but no one so
lution.
Concludes
Niebuhr concluded suggesting
foundation for this view of history.
1 First, we need a "full and profound
j understanding of the uniqueness and
j dimensions of the transcendent soul."
The collective ideals, he pointed out,

have avoided mention of the "trag
-1 edy of death."
Second, although we have a pro
\ found conception, we must recog
j nize ''the perennial tendency of the
! individual and the community to do
exactly that"â€”regard itself as more
| important than it is. The democratic
| society is fighting this situation, but
. we must realize that that tendency
is in every society, including our own.
| "We can have any scheme," he said
in conclusion, but it will not be ade
! quate if it does not do justice to man
! by relating morals and politics."
Tonight's Lecture
At the second, lecture of the series
j tonight, Dr. Niebuhr will be intro
j duced by Professor Edgar E. Robin
son of the History Department, and
the topic will be "An Adequate Jus
! tification for Democratic Toleration."
In addition to this evening's lec-
I ture, Dr. Niebuhr will be in the
; vestry of the Chapel to conduct a
i discussion and question period for
| students this afternoon at 2.
