# F.D.R. Returns Railroads To Private Management
## 
### UNITED PRESS 
WASHINGTON.—President Roosevelt last night authorized Secretary of
War Henry L. Stimson to return the nation's railroads to private manage
ment after announcing that the 15 non-operating rail unions' long-standing
wage dispute had been settled.
Secretary Stimson, acting on President Roosevelt's authorization, re-

stored the nation's railroads to pri
vate ownership effective at midnight.
Termination of government con
trol was made possible by a wage
agreement announced by the Presi
dent affecting the 15 non-operating
■unions and the carriers. It cleared
away the last obstacle to return of
the railroads and wound up a 16-
month-long controversy involving 20
brotherhoods.
