# Stanford Students Oppose Using Axe as War Bond Prize
## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
Although the Cal challenge to offer
the famous Stanford Axe as a prize
in a bond-buying contest is not yet
official, general campus reaction op

poses the suggestion on the ground
that The Axe is an athletic trophy
and should remain such.
No Lack of Patriotism
No question of financial patriotism
is concerned, for most Stanford stu
dents have fully supported every
War Loan drive, every Stamp drive,
every War Chest drive, without any
particular appeal or stimulation. The
majority of students intend to sup
port the Fourth War Loan with jus:
as much fervor as before.
But buying Bonds, the campus be
lieves, does not involve physical skill,
sportsmanship, or any other of the
ethical elements of sports to which
athletes dedicate themselves. The
annual Big Game between Cal and
Stanford has been one of the finest
sports contests in the United States
because it has truly represented the
ideal in sports, and the post-game
award of The Axe symbolized a spirit
of tribute to the sportsmanship of the
winning team, as well as the fact of
its higher score.
Symbol of Sports
The majority of Farm students fee!
that the worth of The Axe as a sym
bol of sports would be cheapened if
it were designated as the prize in a
contest of relative purchasing power
Two letters to the Editor indicate
this sentiment:
"We agree that Stanford should
not be outdone in the sale of War
Bonds, and that we should accept
Cal's challenge. However, we see
no reason why the Stanford Axe
should be the prize. The Axe is a
symbol of sportsmanship, hut this
contest would show merely who
can afford to spend more money on
war bonds. Such a contest would
be supported almost entirely by
the parents of the students.
Why don'e we use the Campanile
as the prize?
Five Sophomore Women."
The other letter represents the male
view of the suggestion:
"After reading the article which
appeared on the front page of
Monday's Daily, seemingly edited
by the students of Cal, our blood
has begun to boil. The idea of
offering The Axe, which has been
the symbol of great athletic rivalry,
is not in our opinion a fair prize
for a bond-selling contest. So that
the spirit of Stanford can not be
questioned we will gladly offer
our Axe if California will on the
other hand also put forth a prize:
tor example, the Campanile.
After all. if we offer The Axe and
Cal offers nothing but their par
ticipation in the contest, which
should need no incentive anyway,
what, pray tell, has Cal got to lose?
There can be no question as to
the importance of a bond drive, we
admit, and with this in mind, the
offering of a prize for the winner
of such a contest seems super
fluous. The token of victory should
be expressed only in the terms of
the gratification that the individual
himself receives from thought in

his mind that he is contributing to
tiie preservation of the ideals of his
country. With this we rest.
M.H.P.D.8."
Summing up, campus opinion ac
cepts the spirit of the offer—every
one should buy his $100 quota in
the forthcoming War Loan drive —
but the Stanford Axe is not an ap
propriate prize, and will not be of
-5 fered if Stanford student officials ad
j here to popular demand.

The other letter represents the male
view of the suggestion:
"After reading the article which
appeared on the front page of
Monday's Daily, seemingly edited
by the students of Cal, our blood
has begun to boil. The idea of
offering The Axe, which has been
the symbol of great athletic rivalry,
is not in our opinion a fair prize
for a bond-selling contest. So that
the spirit of Stanford can not be
questioned we will gladly offer
our Axe if California will on the
other hand also put forth a prize:
tor example, the Campanile.
After all. if we offer The Axe and
Cal offers nothing but their par
ticipation in the contest, which
should need no incentive anyway,
what, pray tell, has Cal got to lose?
There can be no question as to
the importance of a bond drive, we
admit, and with this in mind, the
offering of a prize for the winner
of such a contest seems super
fluous. The token of victory should
be expressed only in the terms of
the gratification that the individual
himself receives from thought in

his mind that he is contributing to
tiie preservation of the ideals of his
country. With this we rest.
M.H.P.D.8."
Summing up, campus opinion ac
cepts the spirit of the offer—every
one should buy his $100 quota in
the forthcoming War Loan drive —
but the Stanford Axe is not an ap
propriate prize, and will not be of
-5 fered if Stanford student officials ad
j here to popular demand.
Although the Cal challenge to offer
the famous Stanford Axe as a prize
in a bond-buying contest is not yet
official, general campus reaction op

poses the suggestion on the ground
that The Axe is an athletic trophy
and should remain such.
No Lack of Patriotism
No question of financial patriotism
is concerned, for most Stanford stu
dents have fully supported every
War Loan drive, every Stamp drive,
every War Chest drive, without any
particular appeal or stimulation. The
majority of students intend to sup
port the Fourth War Loan with jus:
as much fervor as before.
But buying Bonds, the campus be
lieves, does not involve physical skill,
sportsmanship, or any other of the
ethical elements of sports to which
athletes dedicate themselves. The
annual Big Game between Cal and
Stanford has been one of the finest
sports contests in the United States
because it has truly represented the
ideal in sports, and the post-game
award of The Axe symbolized a spirit
of tribute to the sportsmanship of the
winning team, as well as the fact of
its higher score.
Symbol of Sports
The majority of Farm students fee!
that the worth of The Axe as a sym
bol of sports would be cheapened if
it were designated as the prize in a
contest of relative purchasing power
Two letters to the Editor indicate
this sentiment:
"We agree that Stanford should
not be outdone in the sale of War
Bonds, and that we should accept
Cal's challenge. However, we see
no reason why the Stanford Axe
should be the prize. The Axe is a
symbol of sportsmanship, hut this
contest would show merely who
can afford to spend more money on
war bonds. Such a contest would
be supported almost entirely by
the parents of the students.
