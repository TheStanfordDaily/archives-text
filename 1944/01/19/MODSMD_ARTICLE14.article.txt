"CALIFORNIA Challenges Stanford to Bond Sale
Contest for Axe." So read the top headline in
yesterday's Daily and at first glance it looked
like a commendable idea. At least we can be
certain that bond sales on both campuses would
hit new highs if the Axe were at stake!
But at second glance we found the idea less
appealing.
A bond sale contest between the two univer
sities would be beneficial to the United States
Treasury because no matter what the prize, there
is no doubt that bonds would be bought in large
quantities on both campuses.
But to consider the Axe as a prize for such a
contest is not in keeping with the idea behind the
Axe.
The Axe is a football trophy. When, in 1933,
it was set up as the prize to be awarded yearly to
the Big Game winner, students of both Cal and
Stanford meant it to remain as such.
To put the Axe up as a prize for any contest
other than the Big Game seems absurd. And we
can't see that football men of either University
—those men who have gotten out on the field
and fought for the Axe— would care to see it
used as a trophy for any contest but the Big
Game.
The war is an interlude. It's a time when we've
got to buy bonds, yes, but also we've got to put
such things as the Axe and the spirit that goes
with it in the back of our minds until the time
comes when Cal's blue and gold and Stanford's
red again can fight it out in the traditional way.
