(Letters to Campus Opinion dealing with the
Axe being used as a prize in the proposed
War Bond sale contest between Stanford and
Cal are incorporated in the front page story
on the subject.)
To the Editor:
Before the war the only reason for paying to
have a Post-Office box was for the convenienceâ€”
mail could be picked up at any time and on
Sundays.
Then of course, came the war, and a new
schedule was devised for having the Post Office
Dpen because of dimouts, blackouts, etc.
Now that the necessity for such civilian de
fense precautions is no longer necessary, why
not re-establish the pre-war schedules? Leave

the Post Office lobby open night and day and on
Sundays, so that those who pay for the privilege
may enjoy the privilege. Wondering.
To the Editor:
I was never more disappointed in the Stanford
Daily than when, upon reading yesterday's "Bull
Session," I found the so-called "humorous"
take-off on Mrs. Roosevelt's daily column. What
this low humor intended to convey, I have no
idea, but I was certainly not impressed with its
insulting ridicule. A few months ago, I read a
similar take-off by Westbrook Pegler which left
me in a similar but less petulant mood, for I
knew the well-established character of that col
umnist. Whether the columnist of the Daily was
attempting to follow the now well established
Republican, anti-Roosevelt administration, Stan
ford tradition, or was merely producing an imi
tation of the widely read Pegler "humor," I do
not know. Meaning no offense to Miss Levinson,
however, I believe that her evident literary talent
could be put to much better use on subjects
more related to the universal appeal and interest
of Stanford students rather than on political sub
jects that amateurs would do better to leave up
to the ill-taste of such rabid columnists as Mr.
Pegler. An Interested Reader.
