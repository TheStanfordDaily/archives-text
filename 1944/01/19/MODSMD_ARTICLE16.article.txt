### JEAN LEVINSON 
Going to a movie just ain't what it used to be
—not by a long shot. A few years back when the
talkies were struggling to gain perfection, all
you had to do was sit in an uncomfortable seat,
relax, and watch gangsters murder each other
or admire how the gold-diggers went about their
work. Nowadays there's a certain ritual con
nected with movie going.
You start out by bringing a picnic lunch to
fortify you while waiting in line to buy your
ticket. Once inside the Arabian Nights foyer,
you run a 50-yard dash for the candy stand and
gleefully exclaim: "0000, Uno Bars!" Or, you
put a dime in a slot and stand with a little paper
bag vainly trying to catch kernels of corn that
are belched forth by the popcorn machine—the
poor man's automat.
Now you and your smoking friends don oxy
gen masks and ascend to the terrifying heights of
the balcony, where the usher sweetly ignores
you as he hasn't seen the picture all the way
through.
After mashing metatarsals and crunching knee
joints you bend over and prepare to sit down,
but the seat pops up and lashes back at you ag
gressively. With superhuman strength you
manage to settle down, meanwhile pushing the
child next to you into the next row.
You lift your eyes to the screen just in time
to discover who the murderer is—and begin to
feel an insistent prodding on your neck. Looking
over your shoulder you find that it is a size 12
Spalding shoe nestled on the back of your chair,
attached to a pair of jeans and a gum-chewing
face.
"Would you mind?" you ask sweetly, "I be
lieve your shoe is imbedded in my neck."
Large guffaws and adolescent snickers greet
your tortured ears, and so you resign yourself
and look once more at the movie .... which is
the Paramount News that you have seen three
times already.
You now slump into a rosy, ecstatic haze as
Charles Boyer murmurs, "Buy more bonds mon
amour," when the imp next to you (having
crawled back to his seat) puts a wad of bubble
gum in the fur collar in front of him and makes
evil faces at your idol .... your smoking friend
claws wildly at your arm and asks you for an
other of those good Chesterfields .... the shoe
is prodding .... the friend is puffing madly ....
the imp is smacking more bubble gum .... the
popcorn is crackling .... enough is enough!
You heave a sigh of disgust and get up, the
seat popping up and lashing at you once again.
This time you solemnly swear you'll never see
another cinema again .... at least not until
Sonny Tufts comes in that super flick next week.

nected with movie going.
You start out by bringing a picnic lunch to
fortify you while waiting in line to buy your
ticket. Once inside the Arabian Nights foyer,
you run a 50-yard dash for the candy stand and
gleefully exclaim: "0000, Uno Bars!" Or, you
put a dime in a slot and stand with a little paper
bag vainly trying to catch kernels of corn that
are belched forth by the popcorn machine—the
poor man's automat.
Now you and your smoking friends don oxy
gen masks and ascend to the terrifying heights of
the balcony, where the usher sweetly ignores
you as he hasn't seen the picture all the way
through.
After mashing metatarsals and crunching knee
joints you bend over and prepare to sit down,
but the seat pops up and lashes back at you ag
gressively. With superhuman strength you
manage to settle down, meanwhile pushing the
child next to you into the next row.
You lift your eyes to the screen just in time
to discover who the murderer is—and begin to
feel an insistent prodding on your neck. Looking
over your shoulder you find that it is a size 12
Spalding shoe nestled on the back of your chair,
attached to a pair of jeans and a gum-chewing
face.
"Would you mind?" you ask sweetly, "I be
lieve your shoe is imbedded in my neck."
Large guffaws and adolescent snickers greet
your tortured ears, and so you resign yourself
and look once more at the movie .... which is
the Paramount News that you have seen three
times already.
You now slump into a rosy, ecstatic haze as
Charles Boyer murmurs, "Buy more bonds mon
amour," when the imp next to you (having
crawled back to his seat) puts a wad of bubble
gum in the fur collar in front of him and makes
evil faces at your idol .... your smoking friend
claws wildly at your arm and asks you for an
other of those good Chesterfields .... the shoe
is prodding .... the friend is puffing madly ....
the imp is smacking more bubble gum .... the
popcorn is crackling .... enough is enough!
You heave a sigh of disgust and get up, the
seat popping up and lashing at you once again.
This time you solemnly swear you'll never see
another cinema again .... at least not until
Sonny Tufts comes in that super flick next week.
Going to a movie just ain't what it used to be
—not by a long shot. A few years back when the
talkies were struggling to gain perfection, all
you had to do was sit in an uncomfortable seat,
relax, and watch gangsters murder each other
or admire how the gold-diggers went about their
work. Nowadays there's a certain ritual con
nected with movie going.
