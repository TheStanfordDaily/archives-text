## MURAL BASKETBALL Civilian, Army Barnes Start Monday; 40 Teams Will Play 
### FRANK CREEDE 
The sign-up for both civilian and
soldier intramural basketball teams
is now complete. The schedule of
games will be printed in the next
few days. The original civilian league
was to be composed of 12 teams;
however an llth-hour turnout
R aised the number to 16 teams.
Each team was supposed to play
once every week, but because of the
large number of teams participating
this will obviously not be possible.
Both civilian and soldier leagues
will play their first games next Mon
day night. The IB civilian teams are:
McKinley A, Arthur, Firehouse,
Monroe, Washington, Tyler, Gerona
A.C., Fillmore, McKinley B, Bu
chanan, Roble Hashers, Lincoln,
Cleveland, Hayes, Med School, and
Adams Hall. Coach Harry Wolter
was very satisfied with the large
number of teams competing, and was
optimistic concerning a successful
season.
Army games will begin at 9:30; the
time for civilian games is as yet un
decided. Both the Encina Gym and
the pavilion will be used since there
is a large number of games to be
played every Monday, Wednesday,
and Thursday.
The Quartermasters, who are or
ganizing a squad to replace the team
Headquarters did not field, completes
the soldier league. This league now
contains 24 teams representing 11
companies.
Each team will play two games ev

ery night, one at 9:30 and another
one as soon as the first game is fin
ished. Near the end of the quarter
there will be a play-off between the
winners of each league championship
for the campus intramural basket
ball title.
