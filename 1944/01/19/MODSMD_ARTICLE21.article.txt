Yesterday in 13 inches of copy, Jim
! Weinberg stated the arguments
I against Stanford's participating in
inter-collegiate sports. Today I'll
j present as much of the other side's
I viewpoint on those arguments as
I five inches will permit.
One good point made by the Ad
ministration was the statement that
the shortage of civilian students is
not a factor in the problem. This is
true, for we have over 800 eligible
men, while such colleges as the Uni
versity of Idaho and San Francisco
are playing when they have as little
as 200 men in the student body.
The main statement supporting the
present policy was that our coaches
wouldn't have the time to coach

teams if we had varsity sports. After
talking it over with some of the
coaches, I found that if we were to
have spoils they would have the time
to coach them: not as much as he
lore the war, but enough time to
turn out well coached squads.
Another argument was that to par
ticipate in some sports and not in
others (football lor instance) would
lay ourselves open to criticism. Idaho
and several other colleges are doing
this, and are receiving nothing but
praise for turning out the teams that
they are able to.
All in all, there are good argu
ments in favor of not having sports,
but if we really made the effort that
other colleges are making to field
teams, I think we could do it. None
