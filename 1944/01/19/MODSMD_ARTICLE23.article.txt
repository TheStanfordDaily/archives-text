Students interested in Latin-

tend an informal gathering of faculty
and students tomorrow night at 7:30
in the lounge of the Women's Club
house, according to Mrs. Maria Hoge,
director of the Office of Inter-Amer
ican Relations.
Members of the Stanford Ad
visory Committee for the Inter-
American Affairs Discussion Contest
will be present, and students will
have an opportunity to talk with
them about current affairs in the
Good Neighbor countries.
Mrs. Iloge Hostess
Mrs. Hoge will act as hostess for
the committee, which includes Max
Savjlle, Paul Hanna, Langdon White,
Hubert Heffner, Juan Rael, Clifford
Weigle, Graham Stuart, and Mrs.
Percy A. Martin.
Speaking of the Inter-American
Affairs Contest, Mrs. Hoge empha
sized that it is not too late to enter,
as the Feb. 1 deadline for the local
contest still allows almost three
weeks for the preparation of the
not-more-than-1,000-word paper.
This year's subject, "Bases for a
Permanent Cooperation among the
American Republics," she continued,
offers almost unlimited possibilities
for topics in any field in which the
student is interested, such as eco
nomics, social problems, education
problems, or political attitudes.
Possibilities Unlimited
At the Stanford local contest, to be
held in the Education Auditorium on
Feb. 9, two contestants will be chosen
to have their manuscripts sent to
Washington. The winner may be one
of eight from the Pacific Region
chosen to compete for the $500 prize
at the Regional Contest to be held at
Stanford March 22.
