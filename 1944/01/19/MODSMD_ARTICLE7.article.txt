# Niebuhr Gives Audience Ways Of Toleration
## 
### JAMES EMERSON 
Delivering the second in (he series
of the Raymond Fred West Memorial
Lectures, Professor Reinhold Nie
buhr justified democratic toleration
in the Memorial Auditorium last
night.
Dr. Niebuhr said this democratic
problem must be answered "in terms
of the immediate groups which form
the community."
Pluralistic Religion
The first of these groups, he con
tinued, is religion which is pluralistic.
This pluralism leads to confusion,
but the pluralism is necessary in
order to include the wide scope of
ideals in a cultured society.
The first of three possible solutions
to this problem—that we must pro
visionally tolerate the confusion of
a heterogenous culture in order to
bring it back into unity—Niebuhr
approved in part.
Second Solution Rejected
Dr. Niebuhr objected to a second
solution which advocated liberal re
ligious toleration on the ground that
this solution rests on the illusion that
if a free market of ideas is allowed,
the truth will finally emerge.
Concerning an adequate solution,
Dr. Niebuhr said: "The problem of
toleration requires an attitude of a
responsible degree to the cause and
to the opponents." The religious
problem, he continued, cannot be
solved by a disavowal of religion.
The second group, race, involves
racial toleration. Race prejudice re
sults from an egoistic feeling that
one is "higher" and better than
others. Niebuhr's solution is, there
fore, that we will get more tolera
tion if majority and minority minds
"are convicted of corruption."
Class, the third group, involves a
problem of how much the economic
setup must be planned, and how
much left free.
Dr. Niebuhr will conclude his lec
ture tonight at 7:30.
