## 
### 
The establishment of the Lou
Henry Hoover Memorial Fund of the
Hoover Library was announced to
day by President Donald B. Tresid
der of Stanford.
The fund was inaugurated with a
gift from Chancellor and Mrs. Ray
Lyman Wilbur, close friends of the
Hoover family, and was set up at the
suggestion of Herbert Hoover after
friends had asked how they might
honor his wife's memory.
The Hoover Library on War, Rev
olution, and Peace, was begun in
1914 with collections by Mr. Hoover,
as Belgian Relief Administrator, and
has been built up since then under
his constant guidance. The 16-story
library building on the Stanford
campus now contains more than five
million items from 40 nations.
