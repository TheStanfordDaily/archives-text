### UNITED PRESS 
LONDON â€” Supported by the
broadsides of the Red Fleet, Soviet
forces have smashed through and
immense Nazi fortifications
"south for advancement up to 12 miles
in five days of a furious offensive
that has riddled seven enemy divi
sions with the death of more than
20,000 German troops, Moscow re
ported tonight.
The second anniversary of the re
capture of Mozhaisk which dispelled
the closest threat to Moscow, found
the Russians engaged in mighty
battle on a front extending 250 miles
southward from Leningrad with
common objectives of freeing their
second city completely from a 29-
month siege.
While Red Army troops went
through more than 80 towns in sep
arate operations along fronts of 25
miles each aimed immediately south
and west of Leningrad, General Vol
khov's army, 100 miles to the south
east cut the Germans' main longi
tudinal supply railroad for the north
flront on both sides of Novogorod
In the area of Novosokolniki. 150
miles farther south, the Russians re
pelled a furious counterattack, kill
ing 1,500 more Germans, and moved
on to occupy several more positions
in a drive which already had severed
the trunk line due north to Lenin
grad.
Gen. Nikolai Vatutin meanwhile
kept relentless pressure against the
partly split German armies of the
Ukraine and captured Goshcha, 17
miles east of Rovno, while other col
umns of his army pounded even
closer to that key Polish junction
I from the northeast. The Germans
counterattacked desperately north of
Umna far to the east but the attacks
were repelled, Moscow reported.
