## 
### 
Last night after long discussion the Stanford Executive Committee de
cided to accept the challenge of the Associated Students of the University
of California to a War Bond and Stamp Sale contest, hut decided that the
Axe should not he put up as the trophy.
Members of Ex-Committee discussed the challenge on the basis of the

► opinions thai they had heard ex
| pressed on campus in the last few
i days. They felt that the majority of
students wanted to accept Califor
nia's challenge but did not want the
Axe to be put up as the contest
trophy. The Axe, they felt, should
| remain the Big Game trophy for
which it was originally intended.
The resolution passed by Ex-
Committee last night read as fol
lows: "We accept the challenge of
the California Student Body to a War
Bond and Stamps Sales contest. But
the Axe shall not be put up as a
trophy since we feel the Axe should
remain a trophy for the Big Game
as was originally intended in the 1933
agreement."
