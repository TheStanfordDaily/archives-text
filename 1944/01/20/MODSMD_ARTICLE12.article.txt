# Chapel Speakers
## 
### 
DR. REINHOLD NIEBUHR'S reception by the
students has been an enthusiastic one. And
college students, perhaps Stanford students in
particular, have been famed for indifference to
those very subjects, the intellectual and spiritual
problems of our time, and with which Dr. Nie
buhr was concerned.
This remarkable enthusiasm in the right dv
rection brings us to the suggestion, based on
the excellent reception given Dr. Niebuhr's
•Sunday Chapel address, that a series of such
Sunday addresses be given by some of the out
standing professors right here on campus. We
have any number of well known men in the
Humanities, Philosophy, or History departments,
for instance, who are capable of discussing from
different points of view many of the same relig
ious and philosophical problems brought for
ward by Dr. Niebuhr.
Why shouldn't we keep some of the enthu
siasm that is going the rounds this week around
for a few more weeks at least? It would cer
tainly enlarge Chapel attendance and perhaps
make us more intelligent —at least aware of—
those problems with which it is said we are
supposed to be concerned as students. —Nancy
