# Bull Session
## 
### JEAN LEVINSON 
The time has come! The inevitable has hap
pened. This columnist has been criticized by a
disgusted Daily fan and that is good. It's good
because now this writer feels that people are
actually reading the material and that's some
thing. It's also good because it offers the oppor
tunity to answer this criticism here and now,
and that's fun to do.
Dear "Interested Reader":
First of all, old timer, let us keep this in mind
at all times .... "Bull Session" has, or never v/ill
have any intention of maliciously poking fun
at any individual, organization or party. Re
member that this column is in the spirit of fun,
and if it is written in the form of "low humor"
that is merely the style of the author and cannot
be mended at this late date.
Another thing, old timer, every celebrity or
well known public figure is subject to criticism
and satire .... what would the Winchells and
the Parsons write about if it weren't for Grable's
legs, Sinatra's appeal (?), or Garbo's feet? Every
'big name" from Kate Smith down to Mahatma
Gandhi gets his share, and so why not have a
go at this satirization too? Believe us, it was not
meant to be an "insulting ridicule," and Eleanor !
need not lose sleep over it.
Furthermore, gentle friend, here's a Believe It
or Not for you . . . this columnist has never, 1
never read that man with the "well established
character," Westbrook Pegler. Seems like a
good idea to do so, however. And as to taking
sides in the issue, we certainly did not wish to
raise political issues nor arouse the wrath of j
strong party supporters, and we do not join a
party because it is a Stanford tradition.
Always keep in mind the spirit of fun, dear
heart, and polish up that sense of humor; you'll
find living can become much more enjoyable.
Let me further add that "MY DAY" will be a
weekly feature of "Bull Session," so grit your j
teeth and shut your eyes. As was stated in the
first issue of the Daily this quarter, this columnist

I
is merely a "cow-pasture Winchell," and so we
are now also going to assume the name of a i
"moth-eaten Pegler."
Yours for a song,
A Wilted Writer.
