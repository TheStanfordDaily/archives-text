# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
Frequently in discussions where the subject is
well regarded by all, someone will pipe up,
"Well, / think it smells."
Usually the opinion is held by a mental mite
who seeks to astound with his contrary out
bursts. And our pet peeve, Bower, the Daily's
movie critic, seems to be a bird of the same
feather.
In his last column, he said that he did not like,
or think very much of the new show in town.
He or his partner said essentially the same thing
the day before, and all the days before that for
as long as we have been reading the Daily. We
do recall one exception, the approbation he
held for "The Youngest Profession."
Appreciating the fact that a minority of movies
can claim artistical perfection, it still stands that
occasionally Hollywood does turn out a winner.
And in the great majority of cases, it provides
good entertainment for those who attend with
the purpose of enjoying themselves. After all,
our cultural taste does not demand a high degree
of perfection and a deep social or spiritual mes
sage in every picture we see.
A real service can be rendered by a reviewer
in winnowing out those movies which are genu
ine flops. But when the reviewer's comments
are constant denunciations of all shows, they
lose their critical value. Possibly Bower is a
frustrated Hollywood aspirant, or then again, a
radio press agent out to keep people at home
and raise Judy Canova's Crossley rating. To say
the least, he bears a strong prejudice against
the cinema when he passes judgment on an
actress's performance, who does not appear in
a picture he admittedly hasn't seen (Nothing But
the Truth, reviewed last quarter.)
Frequently in discussions where the subject
is held in the same regard by all, we agree—
Bower's column smells.
Very truly yours,

To the Editor:
Since the spiritual and organic center of our
college life is the Memorial Church, Chapel
Board feels that it is highly appropriate for stu
dent-body officers to assume their duties in this
setting.
With the cooperation of the student officers
and the members of the Executive Committee,
the first installation service was held last Sunday.
While reaction has been overwhelmingly favor
able, except in one instance, Chapel Board will
welcome all constructive criticism which will
make further ceremonies even more fitting.

To the Editor:
Apparently Miss Levinson's column "Bull
Session" has aroused the indignation of some
righteous soul. Whether the criticism is for
literary or political reasons, it is difficult to de
termine from the bitter tirade leveled at her. ;
However, one thing is most evident. The "inter
ested reader" who directed that untimely broad
side lacks a sense of humor.
One of the most essential gualities of a demo- :
cratic nation is that its people have a sense of
humor —that they be able to laugh at themselves
and each other. The fact is that it is a phenome
non of our age, notably the First Lady, who
leaves herself wide open to ridicule and mock
ery, should not stifle the waves of laughter that {
must inevitably arise; else all that this nation
fights for today will be in vain. I would suggest
that the offended writer might try laughing at
himself for a change. Nom de Plume.
