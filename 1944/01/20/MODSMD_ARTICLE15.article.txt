# Radio Transmitter Covers Six Years of World News
## 
### JIM FORD 
Knocking around the world for the past six years to take part in front
page news events since 19U7, a five-ton radio transmitter, "The Relic," has
become a historic monument of the modern age. Unglamorous as it may
appear, this transmitter has been "on (he spot" to witness as many headline
events as any ace foreign correspondent.

"The Relic" was assembled by the"*
j National Broadcasting Company to
j report from the mid-Pacific Island of
| Canton the total eclipse of the sun
i which occurred on June 8, 1937.

Scientists from the National Geo
; graphic-U.S. Navy Eclipse Expedi
i tion had gathered to observe the
| eclipse on the tiny island from which
j the phenomenon could be most suc-
I cessl'ully studied. "The Relic," in
| stalled aboard the Navy Tender
"Avochet" anchored off Canton Is
-1 land, broadcast a "play by play" de
j scription of the eclipse at the very
1 moment it was occurring, and from
j the very spot it could be best ob
j served.
Back in the United States, the
j transmitter settled down to tempo
j rary, peace-time service in a number
I of special broadcasts. But in 1942,
it was called to war and shipped to
I North Africa for emergency invasion
! use.
