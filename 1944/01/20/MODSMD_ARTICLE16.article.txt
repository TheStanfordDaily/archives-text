## UCLA Favored To Take Title Of Lower Loop 
### JOE ZUKIN 
iPcking a winner of the southern
division Pacific Coast Conference
basketbool loop at this early date is
rather a risky venture. All three
P?ams concerned are pretty evenly
matched, and all have turned in good
performances to date. In this scribe's
opinion, UCLA will eventually
emerge the winner, with Cal second,
and USC bringing up the rear.
Coach Wilbur John's Bruins have
included on their squad many po
tential stars and with a little devel
opment these boys should come
through for the Uclans and capture
their first PCC penant. Dick West,
returning from last season, is one of
the finest and smoothest ball dan
dlers the Bruins were ever blessed
with. He plays at the forward posi
tion and is always a threat when
ever he .gets his little frame within
20 feet of the bucket. Top defensive
man on the squad is lanky Bill
Rankin, who last season was 011 the
i'rosh five. He amazed all when he
came through in the Uclans' initial
encounter with the Trojans as high
point man with 15 markers to his
credit.
Looking at the USC side of the
picture, we see former Bruin Ainslie
Bell heading the Trojan roster, along
with Captain Dick Bailey. Both boys
are tops, and should account for most
of Troy's points throughout the sea
son. Coach Nibs Price and his Cali
fornia Bears figure that they have
been in the cellar position of the
league all too long now, and this
season they are going to attempt to
do something about it. Cal may be
the team to take the title, but we'll
tick by their southern brothers.
Thus far, here is how the situation
looks. UCLA took the Trojans into
camp with a 33-19 lashing, while Cal
was able to score only 26 points over
Troy, with the Trojans registering 24
notches. Cal and UCLA have not
met as yet, but when they do it is
bound to be one of the best games
of the season. We'll pick the Bruins
to come out the winner of this con
test. and of the Pacific Cast Con
ference as well.
