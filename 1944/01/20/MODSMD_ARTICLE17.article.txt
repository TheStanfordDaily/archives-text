For the past few days, Jim Wein
berg and I have discussed in this
column the various aspects of wheth
er or not Stanford should return to
a policy of inter-collegiate sports.
As a discussion of this sort is useless
if it doesn't accomplish anything
constructive, we've decided to lay
off for a few days, while we investi
gate the chances of Stanford actually
fielding teams. Sometime next week,
I hope to be able to print the results
of this survey, which will decide
whether or not the Big Red Ma
chine gets rolling once more.
During Summer and Fall quarters,
intra-mural sports have gotten under
way with a bang, only to drag later
on as the players got tired of par
ticipating regularly two or three
limes a week. This can happen again
this quarter in the basketball league
unless some sort of incentive can be
provided to keep the fellows inter
ested.
It so happens that this incentive is
on the campus at the present time.
By the incentive I mean the intra
mural basketball trophy offered ev
ery winter to the winner of the
league. This trophy was won last
year by the Phi Psi'-s squad and is
now in the den of Lincoln Hall. If
this trophy were put up again this
year, the chance of winning it would
keep the teams fighting all through
the season. There is 110 logical reason
why the trophy should be retired
for the durationâ€”it should be made
use of.
