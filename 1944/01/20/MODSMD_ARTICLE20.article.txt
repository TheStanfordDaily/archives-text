# Flyers Down Sea Lions; Pollard Out
## 
### 
The Alameda Coast Guard Sea
iLons, minus All-American Jim Pol
lard, went down to defeat at the
hands of Moffett Field, la.st Tuesday
night by a close score of 38-3(5.
Pollard, former Stanford basket
ball great, was benched for the ma
jority of the game and did not see
action until the closing few minutes.
The win gave the Flyers revenge
for an earlier defeat suffered at the
hands of the Coast Guard, and also
boosted their season's average to nine
wins against only one loss. This vic
tory rates Moffett Field as one of the
top cage outfits in California, a repu
tation which should be hard to live
up to, with the competition as tough
as it is.
