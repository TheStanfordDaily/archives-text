Correspondent in Orient
Jacoby, who was only 25 at the
time of his death in 1942, became
head of the Time and Life Far East
ern Bureau in Manila in November
1941 after several years in the Orient
as a correspondent.
Two weeks after he was married
came Pearl Harbor, and Jacoby went
to Bataan with the American Forces.
He was the first American reporter
to go behind the Japanese lines, but
before Bataan fell he and his wife
reached Australia by boat.
Meets Untimely Death
There in April 1942 he was accom
panying Brig. Gen. Harold H. George
on an inspection tour of advanced
American air bases in northern Aus
tralia when a fighter plane got out
of control while taking off. The plane
crashed into the inspection party,
killing Jacoby and General George.
Both Jacoby and his wife were
prominent on the Daily staff while
attending Stanford. The Melville Ja
coby scholarship has recently been
established in his memory.
