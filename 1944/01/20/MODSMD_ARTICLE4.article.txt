# Evolution of a World Nation Explained by Niebuhr Lecture
## 
### JAMES EMERSON 
Last night in the concluding lecture of the West Memorial Lectures in
the Memorial Auditorium, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Professor of Applied
Christianity at Union Theological Seminary, explained why a world na
tion must result from the mutual urgencies of various powers.
Niebuhr introduced his topic with the statement that the universalistic

1 idea was first put on a moral basis by
tlie prophet Amos, and that technical
developments have made the modern
world interdependent. The problem, j
he continued, is to find the political
instruments which will explain the
moral sense, and which will be able
to handle and arbitrate the technical
aspects of the situation.
The pure idealists, Dr. Niebuhr
said, advocate a world community
without force "or political contriv- j
ances, but with law and ideas," or an 1
international government with armed
force. The former idea, he went on, |
assumes that law and ideas are self
sanctioning, but this is not so be
cause man does not have a pure i
mind. The latter idea falls down in
that the nations would not give up ]
their sovereignty to a dominant
world power. "The idealists" he
said, "do not understand the power
of history." "I think it. is impossible"
Niebuhr continued, "to form an in
ternational community by the con
stitutional process!"
The formation of this international j
community depends on the implicant ;
forces or on the urge of events which |
bring together sovereignties, for ex- ,
ample, a global alliance that wins a !
global war, he said.
Balance of Power
"The international community will j
have to be held together for a long ]
time by a preponderant power. Such j
as the power of Great Britain, Russia, '
and the United States," he stated. I
Within this preponderant power, j
there must be a balance of power. ]
Such a power is necessary because ;
every community has a preponderant ;
power and because the international
community has so many heterogen- j
eous factors. Furthermore, he con- !
tinued, we must be careful, because j
any plan has the possibility of "su- j
perimperialism," Therefore, he said, j
the world community needs more !
than constitutional unity, it neds
constitutional checks on the power
as well as a creation of order by
power.
Words of Lincoln
Summarizing, Niebuhr said that
we must have order, elimination of
exploitation, a profound sense of
political workings, and then a firm
resolution. With the audience intent
on every phrase. Dr. Niebuhr con
cluded in Lincoln's words: 1
with firmness in the right, as God !
gives to us to see the right, let us
strive to finish the work we are in.' !
That is our job, and the job of the ,
nations of the world."

assumes that law and ideas are self
sanctioning, but this is not so be
cause man does not have a pure i
mind. The latter idea falls down in
that the nations would not give up ]
their sovereignty to a dominant
world power. "The idealists" he
said, "do not understand the power
of history." "I think it. is impossible"
Niebuhr continued, "to form an in
ternational community by the con
stitutional process!"
The formation of this international j
community depends on the implicant ;
forces or on the urge of events which |
bring together sovereignties, for ex- ,
ample, a global alliance that wins a !
global war, he said.
Balance of Power
"The international community will j
have to be held together for a long ]
time by a preponderant power. Such j
as the power of Great Britain, Russia, '
and the United States," he stated. I
Within this preponderant power, j
there must be a balance of power. ]
Such a power is necessary because ;
every community has a preponderant ;
power and because the international
community has so many heterogen- j
eous factors. Furthermore, he con- !
tinued, we must be careful, because j
any plan has the possibility of "su- j
perimperialism," Therefore, he said, j
the world community needs more !
than constitutional unity, it neds
constitutional checks on the power
as well as a creation of order by
power.
Words of Lincoln
Summarizing, Niebuhr said that
we must have order, elimination of
exploitation, a profound sense of
political workings, and then a firm
resolution. With the audience intent
on every phrase. Dr. Niebuhr con
cluded in Lincoln's words: 1
with firmness in the right, as God !
gives to us to see the right, let us
strive to finish the work we are in.' !
That is our job, and the job of the ,
nations of the world."
Last night in the concluding lecture of the West Memorial Lectures in
the Memorial Auditorium, Dr. Reinhold Niebuhr, Professor of Applied
Christianity at Union Theological Seminary, explained why a world na
tion must result from the mutual urgencies of various powers.
Niebuhr introduced his topic with the statement that the universalistic

1 idea was first put on a moral basis by
tlie prophet Amos, and that technical
developments have made the modern
world interdependent. The problem, j
he continued, is to find the political
instruments which will explain the
moral sense, and which will be able
to handle and arbitrate the technical
aspects of the situation.
The pure idealists, Dr. Niebuhr
said, advocate a world community
without force "or political contriv- j
ances, but with law and ideas," or an 1
international government with armed
force. The former idea, he went on, |
assumes that law and ideas are self
sanctioning, but this is not so be
cause man does not have a pure i
mind. The latter idea falls down in
that the nations would not give up ]
their sovereignty to a dominant
world power. "The idealists" he
