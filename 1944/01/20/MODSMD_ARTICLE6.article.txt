# Contest Deadline Set for Scripts
## 
### 
Automatic membership in Ram's
Head awaits those three lucky indi
viduals whose plays are accepted in
the annual Ram's Head one-act
playwriting contest, announced Moo
fie Faris, president of the society. If
a play is accepted for production, the
author may immediately put an
"R.H." after his name.
These original plays may run the
gamut from slapstick to tragedy; but
the length should be about 25 to 30
pages of double-line typewritten
copy.
