# Freshman Group Meets Today As 'Y' Schedule Commences
## 
### 
The Freshman Club of the Y.W.-
C.A. will hold its first meeting of
the quarter at 2 o'clock this after
noon in the Women's Clubhouse.
Old and new freshman women are
invited to hear Mrs. Payson Treat,
wife of Stanford's Professor Treat,
who will speak on "Traditions at
Stanford." Miss Rosamond Clarke,
director of Roble Hall and a Stan
ford alumna, will advise the mem
bers on "Where to Go and What to
Do in San Francisco."
This is the second meeting which
the "Y" has offered to the girls this
quarter, the first being the Race
Relations meeting which was held
Wednesday at Dean Yost's home.
This meeting served as an introduc
tion to the group's first problem, a
survey of the Negro-White situation
in Palo Alto. Discussions will also
be held concerning the future of
Japanese-Americans, anti-semitism
and minority problems in America.
They will study the Quaker tech
niques of non-violence in solving
race problems and the broadminded
ness of Stanford in this regard.
When the cabinet of the '"Y" met
last Sunday afternoon, each chair
man proposed plans and projects for
her group to fill the Winter Quarter
schedule. At this time, the cabinet
decided because of the rapid change
in plans of students that it would be
advisable to appoint co-chairmen of
each group who could thus obtain
enough experience to take over the
chairmanship in case of emergency.

Therefore, when the cabinet holds
its regular meeting next Tuesday, it
hopes to announce the names of the
newly appointed co-chairmen, ac
cording to Marybeth Smith, presi
dent of Stanford's Y.W.C.A.
Although definite dates have not
as yet been set, the membership
committee, under the leadership of
Chairman Ann Wendling, will pre
sent a membership tea, and sponsor
activities which will enable fresh
men and transfer women to become
acquainted with Stanford life. In
addition, the "Y" will entertain
Stanford's new WAC students.
