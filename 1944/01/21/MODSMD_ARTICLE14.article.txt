# Chapel Board Asks Opinions on Plan
## 
### 
A plan designed to promote a new
feeling of unity and friendship
among the various living groups
here has been formulated, it was
announced today by members of the
Chapel Board.
Today notices will be posted on
bulletin boards about the campus,
asking students to express their
opinions about various suggestions
which have been offered for future
meetings. Boxes in which the stu
dents may place their suggestions or
constructive criticisms will be placed
near the bulletin boards.
Those suggestions which have
been received are for group sings on
Sunday afternoon or evening.
