"AMOUR, AMOUR, OR
THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES"
By Faith Bird win
Pamela looked into the mirror. Her reflection
•.old her that she was truly lovely, with her burnt,
honey-colored hair, her El Greco blue eyes, her
bold, sensuous lips, and her raven-like eye
brows .... now guizzical, now at peace. Her
swan-like neck, from which hung her svelte
body, held a strand of perfectly matched creamy
pearls—that were in striking contrast to the
tanned, satin-smooth skin. The foamy, pale blue
tormal and the six deep purple orchids at her
shoulder completed the picture, and Pamela
softly murmured to herself: "Yes, I m truly
lovely .... lovely!"
The sharp, insistent peal of the doorbell in
terrupted her thoughts, and she tripped excit
edly down the stairs. Opening the oak-paneled
door she exclaimed: "Goeffrey!" She let herself
drink in the picture of the man she loved.
There he stood, six-feet-two of beige gabar
dine uniform with his silver wings gleaming in
the soft light. His crisp, sandy hair was short
rropped; his lean, hard face was at once intrepid
and yet tender. The eyes underneath sandy
eyebrows were gray, and when he was angry
'hey became almost black.
Geoffrey looked long and hard, and whis
pered huskily: "You're lovely, Pamela, truly
lovely!"
Pamela placed a petite, well-manicured hand
upon his gabardine sleeve, and raising her El
Greco blue eyes uttered:
"Thank you. The orchids are lovely, you
shouldn't have."
Geoffrey grinned tenderly, baring his hard
white teeth: "I know it."
"Well, darling, where shall we go tonight?"
asked Pamela. "How about the Starlite Roof?
[ just adore their root-beer floats, don't you?"
Geoffrey was guiet for a long while. He
looked at Pamela tenderly and a little sadly,
she thought.
"Look Pam," he said, "how about skipping all
Df this gay night life for a change. Suppose we
lust stay here this evening?"
Pamela's tanned chin began to quiver threat
eningly.
"But why, Geff, why, why, why?"
Taking a deep breath, Geoffrey answered:
'Pam, I have something very important I must
tell you .... you see I . . . ."
