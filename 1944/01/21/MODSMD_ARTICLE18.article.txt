To the Editor:
In reply to Corp. Livingston and Pfc. Greewald:
The Review Department of the Daily offers
to you its humblest apologies for writing such
inferior movie reviews.
You have shown us the light, and in order
to have a clear conscience, we will even admit
that we purposely condemn every picture that
; is made. That is the only way we can get any
fan mail.
Secretly, of course, we have always ha 7 the
deepest regard for Gene Autry, Chester Morris,
Richard Dix, Jean Parker, and the others, but
because of our policy have been unable to ex
j press our honest opinion.
We hope that after the war when you return
to your positions on the New York Times (or
is it the Eagle Pass Gazette?) you will think
kindly of us and profit by our mistakes.
Humbly yours,
Barney Guqel, Review Editor.

For many of the 2,700 Army students now at
tending Stanford, the greatest part of college
life will be spent on the campus. Yet they will
have no tangible record of that college life, be
cause the soldier-students are not represented
on the annual staff.
Surely, at least company pictures could be
hidden somewhere in the back of the book. Or
better still, why doesn't Editor Nan McLaren
follow the precedent of the large Eastern uni
versities, who are giving the military units
space in the yearbook proportionate to their
numbers. The increased sales, according to
Scholastic, more than justify the added task— |
and soldiers will pitch in and help if they are
accorded a few pages of pictures and text. And
rest assured that we'll pay what Stanford civil- i
ians are paying for both the space and the i
annual itself.

To the Editor:
It seems that all this dribble about whether
is proper or improper to write a satire on Mrs.
Roosevelt's famed column or to poke fun at;
Mrs. Roosevelt is rather trivial. I'm guite sure j
Mrs. Roosevelt can get plenty of laughs on her
own hook without anybody else helping her
along.
It was also stupid to bring up political issues.
Obviously Stanford is not completely Republi
can. The writer of Wednesday's Campus Opin
ion letter by his writing such a letter has proved
that there is at least one Democrat here. That
probably is why he preferred to remain anony
mous.
It was trivial of Miss Levinson to reply to this
letter for she is far too good a Bull Sessioner to
waste her time retaliating to a chronic com
plainer.
If it hadn't been for "An Interested Reader" :
(this brings up the guestion, "Can he read at
all?) Miss Levinson would probably have writ
ten a really good column yesterday.

The Editor:
The Daily states that our students will not
put up The Axe as a prize trophy, stating that
it is a symbol of athletic prowess and sports
manship.
If that is true, why not, instead of a placgue,
place The Axe on a B-25 Bomber, designate that
ship as "The Axe", and then let "The Axe" give
it to the Axis?
This is the gretest contest of all, and surely
our Axe would assume a greater and more im
portant meaning if it were to go into battle
symbolizing everything we are fighting for.

For many of the 2,700 Army students now at
tending Stanford, the greatest part of college
life will be spent on the campus. Yet they will
have no tangible record of that college life, be
cause the soldier-students are not represented
on the annual staff.
Surely, at least company pictures could be
hidden somewhere in the back of the book. Or
better still, why doesn't Editor Nan McLaren
follow the precedent of the large Eastern uni
versities, who are giving the military units
space in the yearbook proportionate to their
numbers. The increased sales, according to
Scholastic, more than justify the added task— |
and soldiers will pitch in and help if they are
accorded a few pages of pictures and text. And
rest assured that we'll pay what Stanford civil- i
ians are paying for both the space and the i
annual itself.

It seems that all this dribble about whether
is proper or improper to write a satire on Mrs.
Roosevelt's famed column or to poke fun at;
Mrs. Roosevelt is rather trivial. I'm guite sure j
Mrs. Roosevelt can get plenty of laughs on her
own hook without anybody else helping her
along.
It was also stupid to bring up political issues.
Obviously Stanford is not completely Republi
can. The writer of Wednesday's Campus Opin
ion letter by his writing such a letter has proved
that there is at least one Democrat here. That
probably is why he preferred to remain anony
mous.
It was trivial of Miss Levinson to reply to this
letter for she is far too good a Bull Sessioner to
waste her time retaliating to a chronic com
plainer.
If it hadn't been for "An Interested Reader" :
(this brings up the guestion, "Can he read at
all?) Miss Levinson would probably have writ
ten a really good column yesterday.

The Daily states that our students will not
put up The Axe as a prize trophy, stating that
it is a symbol of athletic prowess and sports
manship.
If that is true, why not, instead of a placgue,
place The Axe on a B-25 Bomber, designate that
ship as "The Axe", and then let "The Axe" give
it to the Axis?
This is the gretest contest of all, and surely
our Axe would assume a greater and more im
portant meaning if it were to go into battle
symbolizing everything we are fighting for.
