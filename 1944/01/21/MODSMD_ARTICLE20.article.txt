# Movie Billing Termed Weak
## 
### 
Tlie movie bill of fare in the Palo
Alto area is extremely thin this
j week-end and you'd do best not to
! patronize any of the neighborhood
palaces of entertainment. But in
} case you're still interested here are
: the billings at nearby theaters.
The Stanford has two films of a
1 dubious quality today and tomor
row. Mae West makes her return to
the silver screen in the first fea
\ ture, "The Heat's On," which is an
uninteresting little thing about a
run-down Broadway play. Victor
Moore, William Gaxton, and Xaviei
j Cugat with his orchestra are also
on hand but have a hard time keep
ing affairs above water. The second
half of the bill finds John
i and Martha Scott struggling
i "In Old Oklahoma." It's another
glorified horse-opera with the usual
| ingredients.
The Varsity shows the mystery
thriller, "The Adventures of Tartu,"
| a story of espionage and intrigue in
j (he Balkans. The second feature,
j "Buckskin Frontier,'' another west
ern, has an all has-been cast headed
j by Richard Dix and Lola Lane.
Pax-amount's spectacular "The
j Forest Rangers" holds the screen at
j the Mayfield. It's a melange of mur
der, forest fires, comedy, songs, and
romance that stars Fred Mac-Murray
and Paulette Goddard (not Dorothy
j Lamour) in top roles. The late
Lynne Overman and spitfirish Su
san Hayward are good in supporting
I roles in this outdoor. Technicolor
