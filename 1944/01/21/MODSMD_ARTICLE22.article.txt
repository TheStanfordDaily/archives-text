# Big Red Band To Continue
## 
### 
The Stanford band will be re
formed this quarter under the di
rection of Dr. Jan Popper, professor
of music. Before the war, Dr. Pop
per was the director of the Czech
State Opera in Prague and worked
in the music department of the
Czechoslovakia Broadcasting System.
This is the first time in several years
that the Stanford band has been
under professional direction.
The band will be composed of both
army and civilian students and will
|iy for army reviews, athletic
events, and band concerts. Civilian
members will be able to participate
in the army reviews and the entire
band will wear the official Stanford
band uniform.
It is hoped that the Friday night
intramural basketball games will be
come a big enough campus event that
the participation of the band will be
required.
Practices will be held early Satur
day afternoon to accommodate both
army and civilian students. They will
take the place of Military Science in
the case of the soldier-students.
There will be an organization
meeting next week, the exact time
to be announced in the Daily. It is
hoped that there will be a large
enough turnout that a drum and
bugle corps may also be formed. In
struments will be furnished to those
who do not have their own.
The band was revived last quarter
to play for the Cal-UCLA football
game by Ed Carpenter, Stanford
R.O.T.C. student who has since left
for Officer's Candidate School at
Fort Sill. The managership has been
assumed by Jack Pickering under
the aegis Board of Athletic Control.
