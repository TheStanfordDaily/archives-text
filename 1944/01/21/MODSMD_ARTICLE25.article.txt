History of Organ
Warren D. Allen, organist at Stan
ford until recent months, has been
at the University since World War I
and knows the story of the great or
gan and its history as a musical ex
pression of the University. Com
menting on this, he said, "In 1901,
Mrs. Leland Stanford ordered the
organ from the Murray M. Harris Co.
of Los Angeles. It was loaned to the
International Epworth League in
1904 to be played in the Mechanic's
Pavilion in San Francisco. Finally,
in 1904, the organ was set up in Me
morial Chapel, the center of Uni
versity life.
Organ Stored
"The earthquake of April 18. 190G,
resulted in the destruction to the
chapel and slight damage to the or
gan. The series of concerts which
were being presented six days a
week were temporarily discontinued
while the organ remained in storage.
With the erection of the organ in the
old Assembly Hall (now the Gradu
ate School of Business), the series
started again."
The new Memorial Chapel became
complete when the organ was in
stalled once more in 1915, enriched
by the addition of the Echo Organ.
Gifts were later made of a solo or
gan, pedal stops, and four manuals.
The first organist at Stanford was
Louis Eaton, followed by Dr. Ben
jamin Blodgett. Warren D. Allen's
position has been taken over by D.
Sterling Wheelwright, last in the
line of fine musicians bearing the
title of acting organist of the Uni
versity.
Former Guest Players
Since the recital series were orig
inated, many prominent organists
have been guest players. Among
them were Josef Bonet, Marcel Du
pre, Clarence Eddy, Lin wood Far
nam, Andre Marchal, and Palmer
Christian.
