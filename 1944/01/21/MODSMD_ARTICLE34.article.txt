Yesterday's "Slants" said that
Roger Corman and I were going to
•.nvestigate the chances of Stanford's
re-entering intercollegiate athletic
competition in the near future. This
was incorrect. I have already in
vestigated the matter thoroughly. I
have talked with those in authority
who really know the facts, including
Dr. Tresidder. The report of my find
ings appeared in this column in
Tuesday's Daily.
My conclusion was that it is im
possible for Stanford to re-enter
competition under existing circum
stances. I agree with Roger that
Wfurther discussion of the question is
■useless, since it can serve no good
purpose. The Daily therefore con
siders that the issue is closed, until
and unless important new develop
ments occur.

In his column a week ago today in
the Daily Californian (the U. of C.'s
contribution to journalism), the
sports editor of the Daily Cal, John
Stud ley, said: "We're going to predict
right now that California is going to
win the southern half of the Pacific
Coast Conference without too much
trouble for either the Ti'ojans or the
Bruins."
I'm going to predict right now that
Mr. Studley will prove mistaken in
the above statement. I've seen all
three teams in action in the two con
ference games played to date, and
UCLA is my choice to make off with
the crown.
The Trojans played much better
ball against the Bears than they did
against the Bruins, so comparative
scores don't mean too much. How
ever, UCLA has a much smoother
and more consistent club than Cal.
The two forthcoming contests (Jan.
29 in Los Angeles and Feb. 5 in
Berkeley) between the two teams
should be goodies, but the Bruins
should be able to win both of them
without too much trouble.
