### 
NEW YORK. Jan. 20 (UP)—Four
pitching prospects joined the Brook
lyn Dodgers' "availability uncertain"
list today, President Branch Rickey
announced in outlining spring train
ing plans.
Two of the quartet—Bob Chitman,
southpaw, and Bill Lohrman, right
hander—finished out the 1943 sea
son with the Brooks. The others—
Wes Flowers, a southpaw, and Lloyd
Dietz, another right-hander — were
slated to come up from the Mon
treal Royals for trial. Rickey said
that he had expected Flowers to be
a regular next season.
Lohrman, who is apt to be drafted
soon, will be invited to meet with
Dodger officials next Thursday when
they inspect their spring trainees.
Lohrman's letter to his boss explains
that his "number is coming up in
April, and I expect to be in service
not later than June 1."
