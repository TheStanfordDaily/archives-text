### A.S.U.C. News Bureau 
BERKELEY, Jan. 21.—The two top
college basketball teams of Northern
California collide tomorrow night in
the Men's Gymnasium on the U.C.
campus when College of Pacific en
gages University of California.
Both fives have made good records
to date although each has lost twice
to topnotch service teams. In win
ning seven contests the Tigers bowed
to St. Mary's Pre-Flight (30-26) and
Moffett Field (40-39). The Bears
have won four and lost to St. Mary's
Pre-Flight (57-36) and the Coast
Guard Sea Lions (51-37).
Up at Stockton, Coach Chris

outstanding Santa Clara player. Over
nine games Pacific has averaged 51

points while holding the opposition
to an average slightly over 35 points.

ample, is only 6-1, yet is a demon
on the backboards. O'Keefe is 6-2,
not large for a center. Darrell Brown,
a 6-1 transfer from Humboldt State,
is Wolfe's teammate at forward.
Frank Domenichini, ex-Santa Claran
and 6-2, and John McCann, 6-0 from
Chieo State, are the likely starting
guai-ds.

against common opponents the Paci
ficans loom as pre-game favorites.
They lost to Pre-Flight by only four
points while the' Bears lost by 21,
They defeated Livermore Naval Air
Station, 38-29 and 34-31, while Cal
barely eked out a 36-35 win.
