# Farm Journalism Instructor Heads 'News' Foreign Desk
## 
### EWELL SALE 
To Stanford, Robert C. Elliott is
..n instructor of journalism, but to
the newspaper world, he is the for
eign and post-war editor of the San
Francisco News.
Mr. Elliott, who graduated from
Harvard some years ago, has recent
ly returned to California after com
pleting a year's work of post-war
planning under the Nieman Fellow
ship at Harvard.
Grant Established Fellowship
The fellowship, which was estab
lished by a million dollar grant from
the widow of the publisher of The
Milwaukee Journal, gives on the
average of 12 newspapermen each
year an opportunity to attend lec
tures, talk with professors at Har
vard and search for the things which
seem most necessary to them as
writers.
During his past year at the Uni
versity, Mr. Elliott not only was able
to converse often with foreign gov
ernmental leaders and leading cor-

respondents, but also did a full-time
.job of post-war political, economic,
and social planning.
Asked what he believed the future
of business after the war would be,
Mr. Elliott replibd:
"We will have to put all our
talents to work and utilize them to
the fullest, for there will be a de
mand in all lines. On the national
front, there will have to be full
blast production, and on the inter
national side, the main point will
be winning the peace."
As for education, Mr. Elliott of
fered a promising opinion, stating
that many of the smaller university
student bodies would be composed of
a great many men under govern
ment-financed education.
"Education," he added, "is one
of the most important factors in
the post-war plan, for it is essen
tial that boys with a year or two
of college work complete their
training."
Mr. Elliott also had something to
say about the fate of career women.
"This, of course, depends upon the
amount of employment," he began,
"but there will definitely be a field
for women in reconstruction and so
cial work both at home and abroad."
New Trade Areas
The question of whether the
United States would look for new

frontiers in the Orient and Latin
America after the war was another
subject which interested Mr. Elliott.
In a few words, he summarized the
situation, saying lhat we would un
doubtedly open up new and wider
areas of commerce, but added that it
would have to be done on a basis of
reciprocal trade along with the es
tablishment of credit and industrial
ization in foreign areas.
One of the most outstanding con
versations which Mr. Elliott recalled
was one with Heinrich Bruning, Ger
many's ex-Chancellor of the Weimar
Republic. Rumors had suggested that
Bruning was being groomed by the
United States to be the leader of a
conservative democracy in Germany
after the war, however, Mr. Elliott's
answer was that such a rumor is
completely false and that Bruning
has no such ambition.
Private Enterprise Emphasized
Mr. Elliott's final comment on post
war planning was that there will bÂ£
a definite emphasis on private enter
prise, with a wealth of new oppor
tunities for men returning from the
armed services, and that although
there would be a few government
controls during the period of transi
tion, these would serve only to facili
tate the process.
This quarter is Mrr Elliott's first at
Stanford, and at present he is in
structing in Editorial Techniques in
the Journalism Department.
