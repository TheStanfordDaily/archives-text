# Whitman's 'Leaves of Grass' Recorded by Ralph Bellamy
## 
### 
Walt Whitman's poetry will be made available for the first time on phono
graph records when RCA Victor releases an album of selections from
"Leaves of Grass" in February. The dramatic reading is by Ralph Bellamy,
film and stage star, currently appearing on Broadway in "Tomorrow the
World."
Speaking of war, of freedom, and of the essential spirit of America, tht

poems inciuaea in me aiDum are as
timely as ii' they had been penned
only yesterday. Not only an ob
server of the physical turns of man
and nature, Whitman read into the
soul of the American people and in
so doing made his poems as impera
tive today as when he first wrote
them.
Included in the "Leaves of Grass"
album besides the introduction are:
To a Certain Civilian; I Think I
Could Turn and Live With Animals;
To the Man-of-War Bird; For You;
0 Democracy; Vigil Strange I Kept
on the Field One Night; Long, Too
Long America; Over the Carnage
Rose a Prophetic Voice; O Star of
France; To a Foiled European Revo
lutionaire; Europe; France; A Broad
way Pageant; Years of the Modern;
1 Was Looking a Long While; Pas
sage to India; 1 { Blue Ontario's
Shore; So Long!; and Song ot the
Open Road.
It seems fitting that Victor should
release this album since for years
Whitman lived only a few blocks
from ihe Victor Talking Machine
Company in Camden, N.J. He walked
almost daily in the shadow of the
Victor plant to the Delaware River
ferry for his customary afternoon
ride on the apron of the boat.
The poems in the "Leaves of
Grass" album were all chosen per
sonally by Mr. Bellamy who has long
been an admirer of Whitman. The
album also marks Bellamy's first
appearance on phonograph records.
During his 13 years in Hollywood, he
has starred in 83 films, including
such recent successes as "The Awful
Truth," "His Girl Friday," and
"Dive Bomber." Prior to his Holly
wood career Bellamy was on the
Broadway stage and it was his per
formance in "Roadside in 1930
which led to his motion picture
career.
