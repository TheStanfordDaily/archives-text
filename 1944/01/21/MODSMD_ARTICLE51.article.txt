# Plastic Surgery 'Miracles' Performed on Scarred Fliers

EAST GRIMSTEAD, England (UP) — An American flyer came to the
Queen Victoria Hosiptal here without a nose—and when he was released
he had an even better one than he had previously and the new one was
fashioned from his hip.
Men who have lost their eyelids—and cry constantly as a result—again

assume normalcy when brand new"
lids are made from inside skin of
their arms.
These miracles of plastic surgery j
are taking place in a remote English
village under the skilled care of Dr.
Archibald H. Mclndoe, a New Zea
lander who spent 10 years studying 1
at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester,
Minn. He has performed more than
7,000 operations since the hospital
was opened four years ago. Ameri
cans, through the British War Re
lief, have contributed 1120,000 to
build a new operating clinic since 1
operations are now carried on in the
small children's ward.
Most patients enter the hospital
with the thought of looking into a
mirror and saying, "I'll never be able ,
to marry or even face people."
Yet, after one or two operations,
they begin to gain confidence and in
pairs they go to factories, always
two working together. Some have
wire cages where their jaws should
be and many are waiting for more
operations.
Fliers with green hands, with blis- J
tered, blackened faces, are given new
skin. Eyebrows are made from a J
patient's hair and numerous other j
ways of bringing the men back to j
normal have been devised. The hos
pital owes a great deal to Dr. E. C.
Padgett, an American from Kansas !
City, Md., who invented a skin
removing machine which slices flesh
thinner than tissue paper.
