# Monroe Males Mangle Mops

### Frank Creede 
No, the Hitler Youth Movement
hasn't begun on campus. These
Germanic - looking' youths are not
Teutonic at all, but rather victims of
the Monroe hair purge. This move
ment began when a lew of the more
repulsive Monroe men, realizing that
their appearance could not be im
proved by any means, became jeal
ous of the wavy locks of the more
fortunate inhabitants of the hall.
In the violent struggles which en
sued, all of the members of the
Monroe household underwent ton
sorial amputations. Even the vigor
ous protests of conscientious objec
tors were not enough to quell the
hair lust of the Monroe ghouls.
Wailing and gnashing of teeth
could be heard as golden locks and
cultured curls, which were the re
sult of many months of patient
attention by Monroe lovers, fell to
the ground. Horrified "operators"
screamed as they gazed at their
hopelessly mutilated skulls.
Monroe had reverted to the blood
thirsty traditions of the Indian
scalping parties. But being more
civilized than the Indians because of
their slight contact with Stanford
culture, the amputators had allowed
a few strands of hair to remain.
The gentlemen of Monroe were
greatly consoled by the recent state
ment of Dr. Danforth that the aver
age human head produces 150.000.001)
hair cells per day. As the Firehouse
puts it:
Monroe men are much improved,
Since they got their hair removed.
No more gals or boozer's breath.
Give me hair or give me death.
