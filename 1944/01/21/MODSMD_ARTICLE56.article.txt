# March of Dimes Supports War on Infantile Paralysis
## 
### 
The support given the fight of infantile paralysis by last winter's March
of Dimes paid off swiftly and dramatically during the recent epidemic of the
disease, the committee in charge of this year's campaign points out.
Attention is called to the fact that most of the children in this and other
Peninsula communities, who were stricken with infantile paralysis last

year were cared for at the Children's
Hospital in San Francisco. Here they
received the Kenny treatments ad
ministered under doctors' super
vision by technicians trained at
Stanford with funds made available
by the National Foundation for In
fantile Parilysis.
Public Reminded
The public is reminded that con
tinuation of the training will depend
on this year's response. Adequate
physical therapy for military hospi
tals, as well as for civilians, can be
provided only if the March of Dimes
rolls up a large fund.
The division of physical therapy in
the Stanford School of Health is one
of several centers set up by the
foundation to train personnel in the
Kenny technique.
The school added 40 technicians,
71 nurses, and 23 doctors to the total
of those available to administer the
treatment to infantile paralysis suf
ferers.
Stanford's Part
Stanford has been enlarging its
training program because of the ex
treme shortage of trained physical
therapists. This expansion was aided
by the assistance of the foundation.
As a result, approvimatelv 80 stu
dents, both civilian and WAC are
enrolled. All receive instruction in
the Kenny technique and other
forms of rehabilitation.
Through the American Physio
therapy Association, the National
Foundation has arranged scholar
ships for outstanding students with
proper credentials.
