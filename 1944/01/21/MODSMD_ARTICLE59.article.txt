. . And as is customary, the
next issue of the Stanford Chapar
ral will l>e the most tremendous
thing west of San Francisco!"
Such were the prophetic words of
Bill Hyer, Chappie editor, when he
was cornered at his desk in his spa
cious office upstairs in the Journal
ism Building. When Questioned as
to the merits of the next issue lie
said it would be a take-off on the
weekly pulp magazine, and woulu
sell at the new low price—2s cents.
" 'Bon mots' are needed for the
next issue," the Old Boy continued £
"Anyone who has literary or artis-™
tic aspirations, any soldiers or stu
dents with witty epigrams are in
vited to contribute to the humor
magazine of the campus. The DEAD
LINE is Jan. 28. Beautiful blondes
are especially welcome, but there is
a string attached."
People are requested to tie then
contributions to a 20-]b. lead rail
road spike and drop them into the
editor's desk.
The staff for the new volume of
the Chaparral also includes Bill Gil
bert, business manager, and Dick
Driscoll, art editor. New members
