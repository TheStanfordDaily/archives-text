# Nazis Blunder In Rome Defense Move

ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERS, Jan. 23 (UP)
Powerful British and American sea borne forces
smashed several miles inland at a number of points
below Rome today in full exploitation of a colossal
blunder by Nazi strategists who had sent three German
divisions southward to the Cassino line, leaving the
new invasion front relatively undefended.
There three divisions, together with six others under
Lieut. Gen. Mark W. Clark's frontal attacks—6o miles
to (he southeast—possibly more than 100,000 men now
were virtually isolated and potential prizes in what
would be the greatest Anglo-American victory since
Tunissia.
Rome itself was reported imminently threatened as
the landing forces widened their beach heads and sup
plies and war equipment poured ashore in a shuttle
service of hundreds of landing and invasion craft.
Not an enemy shot was fired during the first two
hours the troops were ashore, it was announced.
Correspondents representing combined American
press with the landing forces reported an invasion that
went on with the smoothness of a maneuver. On at
least one sector not an artillery shell had been fired 11

hours after the troops went ashore. There was as yet I
no signs of the fully expected counterattack.
In the first four hours, front dispatches said, all of the
first day's objectives were taken, including a number
of seaside towns, among them a famous watering place,
presumably Nettuno, which the Nazis admitted yes
terday as fallen.
The first German reaction came in the form of sneak
attacks on the landing fleet by a Folke-Wulfe fighter
bomber which dived through the Allied fighter patrol
and the anti-aircraft barrage from the warships.
With Allied fighter fields in easy range, the landing
forces were covered by complete air superiority and
more than 1,300 sorties were flown Saturday in support
of the operation in the biggest day for the tactical wing
since Salerno. By comparison the Germans flew only
about 100 sorties and lost 15 planes while the Allies lost
nine.
The reason for the lack of ground resistence, Allied
intelligence found, was that German Field Marshal
Kesselring early last week dispatched three of his crack
motorized divisions, the 3rd, 29th, and 90th Panzer
Grenadiers, from the Rome area to the Cassino front.

Correspondents representing combined American
press with the landing forces reported an invasion that
went on with the smoothness of a maneuver. On at
least one sector not an artillery shell had been fired 11

hours after the troops went ashore. There was as yet I
no signs of the fully expected counterattack.
In the first four hours, front dispatches said, all of the
first day's objectives were taken, including a number
of seaside towns, among them a famous watering place,
presumably Nettuno, which the Nazis admitted yes
terday as fallen.
The first German reaction came in the form of sneak
attacks on the landing fleet by a Folke-Wulfe fighter
bomber which dived through the Allied fighter patrol
and the anti-aircraft barrage from the warships.
With Allied fighter fields in easy range, the landing
forces were covered by complete air superiority and
more than 1,300 sorties were flown Saturday in support
of the operation in the biggest day for the tactical wing
since Salerno. By comparison the Germans flew only
about 100 sorties and lost 15 planes while the Allies lost
nine.
The reason for the lack of ground resistence, Allied
intelligence found, was that German Field Marshal
Kesselring early last week dispatched three of his crack
motorized divisions, the 3rd, 29th, and 90th Panzer
Grenadiers, from the Rome area to the Cassino front.
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, ALGIERS, Jan. 23 (UP)
Powerful British and American sea borne forces
smashed several miles inland at a number of points
below Rome today in full exploitation of a colossal
blunder by Nazi strategists who had sent three German
divisions southward to the Cassino line, leaving the
new invasion front relatively undefended.
There three divisions, together with six others under
Lieut. Gen. Mark W. Clark's frontal attacks—6o miles
to (he southeast—possibly more than 100,000 men now
were virtually isolated and potential prizes in what
would be the greatest Anglo-American victory since
Tunissia.
Rome itself was reported imminently threatened as
the landing forces widened their beach heads and sup
plies and war equipment poured ashore in a shuttle
service of hundreds of landing and invasion craft.
Not an enemy shot was fired during the first two
hours the troops were ashore, it was announced.
