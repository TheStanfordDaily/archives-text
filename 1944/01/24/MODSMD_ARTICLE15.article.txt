# Something To Do
## 
### 
AS HARD as it seems to believe at times, the
war is still going on, and men are still being
killed and men are still being wounded. It
shouldn't be hard to remember that while we're
living the life of college students, being busy
with so many things that seem all-important,
other persons are busy with things that not only
seem all-important, but actually are all-important
to them and to us—whether we know it or not.
All the preceding paragraph means is this:
It looks as though we're paying too much at
tention to hanging on to so-called "college life"
and too little attention to hanging on to real life.
At first glance the situation looks hopeless. A
Stanford student can't fight a German, a Stan
ford student can't carry on in the fury of an air
raid, a Stanford girl can't nurse some wounded
soldier back to health.
But a Stanford student can put out a few cents
for a war stamp, a Stanford student can at least
read the papers and get wind of the fact that
we're doing something in Italy, and a Stanford
girl can, above all, roll bandages.
Rolling bandages is in itself a dull skill.
There's a definite routine to be followed, and
after rolling about 25 dressings, a person begins
to feel like a machine. But the fact remains that
rolling bandages is one of the most, if not the
most vital work that a Stanford girl can do if
she cares whether or not her brother or fiance
is going to be cared for if he should be
wounded.
The Red Cross room is open between 9 and
12 and from 1 to 4, Monday through Friday.
Rolling bandages with a group of friends may
not be as much fun as driving into Paly for a
coke, but there are a few million men who have
a right to expect something from us. Pledge
cards will be distributed tonight.
