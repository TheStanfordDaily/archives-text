Are you bothered with cigarette mooches?
Do you find your package of L.S.M.F.T.'s frit
tered away by these detestable parasites? A
cigarette mooch is the lowest form of nicotinic
leech, and there are all types and species of
such base creatures.
The tactics of the Libe mooch are subtle and
wily. It approaches you in the Reserve Book
Room just as you are in the midst of a rapturous
dream and pokes you in the ribs, saying: "How's
about going outside for a cigarette, eh-"
"Sure," you unsuspectingly answer, "I'm sick

of pouring over this Bobbsy Twin book any
how."
"Goody gumdrops," is the slick comeback,
"you gotta cig?"
The obvious reply is, "uh huh."
But no, you too must be sly and calculating, j
and so you open your eyes and after giving It
Look Number 38a, you bubble back with, "No, !
but I have a package of Prince Albert you can
smell for a while," or "Mercy, I stopped that
nasty habit ever so long ago."
The cow-eyed twitching variety of cigarette
mooch is a difficult one to contend with. First
of all It breaks your moral stamina by drip
pingly watching every whisp of smoke you ex-1
hale, and if you don't watch closely, It will take
desperate inhalations of the smoke-filled air, j
getting even with you indirectly.
If the cow-eyed pathetic angle doesn't work
for It, and your will power is strong enough to
hold out, It then begins twitching, and this is
the hardest ordeal to endure.
A rhythmic jerking of the nostril starts off the
routine, and this grows and grows until It is
doing a veritable conga in Its chair. You're lost, [
and must either offer It a cheroot or a hypo as
a last resort.
Another species is the frantic mooch who
comes loping up to you on Quad and pantingly
shrieks: "If you have any humanity in you at
all, gimme a weed quick .... I'm dying on my
feet .... haven't had one for five minutes."
This meek inquiry is accompanied with a
frantic clawing of your arm and a jumping up
and down, that is threatening the safety of the
blimp overhead. What can you do but draw
out your revolver (equipped with silencer for
such occasions) and put It out of its misery.
"Gotta match, bub?"
