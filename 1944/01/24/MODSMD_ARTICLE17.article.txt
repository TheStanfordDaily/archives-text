i To the Editor:
i
We would like to answer Private Richard's
"swift kick" voiced in Friday's "Campus Opin
i ion." Here are our replies to his objections con
cerning the alleged lack of soldier representa
tion the 1944 QUAD.
1. We do have soldiers on our staff who have
regularly contributed their artistic and photo
graphic talents since our work began last July.
(The door is open every afternoon between 1
and 4. Where have you been, Private Swift?)
2. Due to wartime scarcities of paper, film,
etc., the "dummy" was planned last September.
At that time several companies were asked if
they would be interested in buying space in the
QUAD. The men declared that they preferred
spending company funds for athletic equipment
to purchasing space in the QUAD. (We wish we
could give the Army space "gratis," but "things
is rough all over.")
3. G.I. candids figure prominently through
out; in fact, an entire section is to be devoted
exclusively to the Army.
4. The original lack of soldier financial sup
port, together with wartime paper shortages,
! resulted in our maximum supply being set at
1,580 copies. It seems improbable that indivi
dual soldiers will pay 55.75 when collectively
' they were unwilling to pay $34 for a page.
5. Constructive criticism, and editorial, photo
graphic, and artistic contributions are always
gratefully received, to say nothing of the income
from sales.
6. (If Private Smith will pose for our photog
rapher in the puddle on the obstacle course
we'll be more than glad to print it.)
7. If you do not think everyone is WELCOME
at the QUAD office, read our "ad" in Friday's
Daily.
