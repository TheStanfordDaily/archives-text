Some interesting suggested changes
in the rules of major collegiate sports
have come into the news during the
past week. The most important ones
have concerned football and basket
ball. Grantland Rice, in his regular
column which was run in the San
Francisco Chronicle last Thursday,
offered three changes in the rules of
college football which he advocated
for adoption before the beginning of
the 1944 season. These are:
I—That on an out-of-bounds kick
off, the receiving team should be
given the ball on the 50-yard line,
instead of their own 35 as at present.
}2. —That forward passing should be
permitted from any point behind the
line of scrimmage (present rules
prohibit passing less than five yards
behind the line of scrimmage).
3—That anyone recovering a fum
ble should be permitted to run with
it (only the offense may do so now).
Speed Up Game
These changes would go a long
way toward speeding up the game of
football. The rule on passes has al
ready had this effect in pro football.
The one on kiekoffs would make an
out-of-bounds kick costly, and
would thus tend to preserve one of
the game's most exciting plays, the
kickoff runback.
A revolutionary change in basket
ball was introduced last week. It is
the brainchild of Coach Bill Chan
dler of Marquette University, and
was first tried when his team met
De Paul Friday night. Instead of ex
pelling a player from the game for
good after he has committed four
personal fouls, the new plan would
merely banish him to the bench for
a three-minute period, after which
he could return. For each additional
foul which he committed thereafter,
the player would have to spend an
other three-minute period on* the
bench.
Aid in Manpower Shortage
This rule, if adopted generally,
would help to alleviate the current
manpower shortage. Most squads are
quite small nowadays, and in a game
: th lots of fouls the mrtality on
.our personals may easily be dis
astrous.
If this rule had been in effect last
season, it would probably have
helped the Stanford Varsity consid
erably. In both of our games with
U.S.C. we lost key men at crucial
moments on personals—Howie Dall
mar in the first game, and Ed Voss in
the second (S.C. won both contests).
