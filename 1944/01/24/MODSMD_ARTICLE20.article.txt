## Ex-Card Gridders Get Cal Letters 
### 
Twenty - four California varsity
footballers were awarded block C's
for their participation in the '43 pik
skin season, eight of them being for
mer Indian gridsters. Coming
through a mediocre season, Cal pro
duced no "60-minute" men.
The top man on the team was Art
Honegger with 497 minutes out of a
possible 600. Honegger was also
named the most valuable man on the
squad.
Fred Boensch, Jim Cox, Bill Jos
lyn, and Lewis Avery were four of
tlie eight ex-Stanford men to receive
the Cal letters. Boensch was by far
the most outstanding Farm man to
play for Cal last season. Cox and
JJoslyn have been transferred to
other bases.
