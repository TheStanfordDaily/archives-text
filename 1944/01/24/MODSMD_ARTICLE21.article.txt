# Tony Calvelli Made Captain
## 
### 
A former Stanford football player,
Tony Calvelli, has been promoted to
the rank of captain in the Air Serv
ice Command at Sacramento.
Captain Calvelli will be one of the
many men responsible for the correct
handling of the giant repair and sup
ply base at Sacramento.
It is the job of this base to keep the
ships in the air no matter what cir
cumstances prevail. Planes often
leave from there to all points on the
globe carrying supplies for our
armed forces.
Upon leaving Stanford, Calvelli
played pro football for a short while
in the Eastern circuits.
