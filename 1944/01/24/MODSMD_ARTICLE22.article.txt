# Civilian, Army Fives Clash As Mural Basketball Begins
## 
### JOE ZUKIN 
The starting gun of the intramural
basketball race goes oft' with a bang
tonight as eight civilian and four
army teams clash on the campus
hardwoods. The civilian games be
gin at 7:15 p.m. in both the pavilion
and the Encina gym, while the Army
lussles start at 9:li0 p.m. also on both
floors.

The top game of the evening will
I see Hayes Hall testing the Fire

house's potential strength. The fire
men should walk away with laurels,
taking the match by at least 10
points.
Another civilian contest which pits
the Mod. School five against Arthur
Hall has the makings of a good hall
game with the doctors coming out
on the long end of the score. In the
other two games Washington should
bowl over Cleveland, while Adams
walks over McKinley A.
The Army men come into the lime
light at 9:30 p.m. when Co. A takes
on Co. B in the pavilion, and Co. C
clashes with Co. D in the gym. Tho
two Army leagues are still rather
unsettled, so if any information is
wished it may be obtained at the
Army headquarters in the B.A.C.
A complete schedule of the civilian
basketball games may be had for the
asking at Harry Wolter's desk, also
in the B.A.C.
