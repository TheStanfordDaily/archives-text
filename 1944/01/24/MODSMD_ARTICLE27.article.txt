# Women Needed For Harvesting
## 
### 
Women farm volunteers accounted
for more than 10 per cent of Califor
nia's 1943 harvesting jobs, Irene
Fagin, assistant state supervisor of
the Agricultural Extension Service
Farm Labor project, announced to
day.
Women registered for nearly 38.000
of the 342,000 harvest jobs filled in
the latter part of June, when Ex
tension Service assumed direction,
until December, according to Miss
Fagin.
In addition to the thousands of
seasonal harvest volunteers who
worked during peak seasons of from
one to eight or ten weeks, nearly
700 women were recruited for year
round farm work, she reported.
"Patriotic women, anxious to con
tribute to the nation's war effort,
asked no favors from the men when
volunteering," she declared. Their
general farm work included driving
tractors, working on irrigation proj
ects, pruning fruit trees, working
with poultry, dairy herds and haying.
"With our farmers planting thou
sands of additional acres to wartime
crops in 1944," she said, "we'll need
more women volunteers than ever
if this increased food production is
to be harvested to help shorten the
war."
