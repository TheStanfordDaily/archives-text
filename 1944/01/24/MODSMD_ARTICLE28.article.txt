# Bergman Wins Critic's Praise

### 
FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS—
Now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Paramount's two million dollar
production of Ernest Hemingway's
highly controversial novel, "For
Whom the Bell Tolls," was 1943's
most expensive and important pic
ture. But this story of love and the
Spanish Civil War was transferred
by the Hays Office and other forces
into a mild romance which ignores
both sex and historic significance.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" has as
its strong points superb character
izations and magnificent photography
that compensate in some measure for
the long and tiresome story. Ingrid
Bergman, as the girl who has be
come entangled in the web of fas
cism, gives a sincere touching per
formance, while Gary Cooper is ac
ceptable as the American teacher
who has come to the aid of the Span
ish Loyalists in their desperate
struggle.
Cast Recommended
Katina Paxinou as Pilar and Akim
Tamiroff as the treacherous Pablo
handle their supporting roles in true
Academy Award fashion.
The last few minutes, however,
when Cooper dynamites a bridge that
spans a mountain pass, are, as a
famous columnist said, "as much ex
citement as any human being can
normally stand."
Streamlining Predicted
A further streamlined edition of
the picture will probably be present
ed when it returns for popular prices
next year, as Paramount bigwigs as
sure us it will.
No matter what you've read or
heard about "For Whom the Bell
Tolls," it will be worth your time and
money to see this milestone in mo
tion picture history.
You may agree with this reviewer
that the film is disappointing, or you
may concur with Corp. Livingston
and Pfc. Greewald (authors of that
fan letter which somehow found its
way into the "Campus Opinion" col
umn last Thursday), who doubtlessly
got up in their seats and cheered
after each and everv reel.—Bower
