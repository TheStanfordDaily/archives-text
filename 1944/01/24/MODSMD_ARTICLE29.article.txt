# Wanted—--Ill Stanford Men To Occupy New Rest Home
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Can it be that Stanford men have
suddenly acquired new quantities of
vim, vigor, and vitality, and no
i longer need a few days of complete
rest and relaxation? Or is it that
! they are unaware that a Men's Rest
I Home is still available to them?
At the same time that Mrs. Clifford
Gilmore Allen turned over the di
rectorship of the Men's Rest Home
to Mrs. R. B. Childs and Mrs. Min
erva M. Skelton, the location was
moved temporarily from her home to
the Isolation Hospital.
Popularity Declines
Perhaps memories of the recent flu
epidemic and the part played by the
! Isolation Hospital at that time have
J given an unfortunate impression of
! the place, for the usual number of

sick men have not taken advantag
of the opportunity offered them at
the new rest home.
j Home To Ce Moved
Mrs. Childs, a graduate nurse, says
| that as soon as a suitable empty
I house is found on the campus, the
Rest Home will move to this less
formidable and more convenient lo
cation. As yet, however, the ladies
have been restricted to their present
place.
Mrs. Childs, in describing her at
i titude toward the directorship says,
j ''It sounded like a perfect idea. A
j home for me, my daughter, son, dog.
and cat —and a friend with a sense
j of humor as a partner. But we m£
i patients, and that, apparently,
] what the hospital lacks."
