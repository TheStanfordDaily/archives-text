### MARY LOU MUELLER 
'"Desert Victory," documentary
picture of Montgomery's victorious
1.300-milc march from El Elamein
to western Tripoli, will be shown on
the Tuesday Evening Series tonight
at 7:.']() in Memorial Hall.
Filmed by the British Army Pho
tographic Unit, the concern was not
aiily with recording battles of a
pistoric campaign, but also of re
porting characteristic aspects of the
men's bodies and faces, the machines
of warfare, and the effects of desert
heat.
Notable Sequences
Notable sequences show the shat
tering noise of artillery barrage, the
deadly calm of Englishmen advanc
ing into enemy fire, and, in sharp
contrast, the blithe sound of bagpipes
before and after each mission. One
scene, taken from captured German
film, is that which shows General
Rommel at a state reception in Ber
lin—triumphant and confident—to
background music of the "Horst-
Wessel Song."
The 200,000 feet of film taken by
the army cameramen, together with
the captured German reels, were
taken to London and edited by the

j film's Scottish - born, Hollywood
j trained Lievit. Col. David McDonald.
I With commentary added, the result
j is an innovation for war films and
I remarkable for its order and co-
I herence.
Difl'erence
Director McDonald, speaking to
i a preview group, himself expressed
I the final difference between this film
i and others:
"These combat scenes can be done
in Hollywood and you can do them
i very nicely, without loss of life. In
, making thus film, there was loss of
life, 112 think the film shows it."
