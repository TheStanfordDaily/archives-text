## 
### 
To remove the annoyance and
danger of bicycles in Quad arcades,
Gordy Davis, Stanford chief of
police, yesterday asked student co
operation in eliminating all cycling
in colonnades of the Quad.
Also, he said, bicycles should not
at any time be stood against the
walls of classrooms or left lying in
the walkways, but should be
parked off the Quad in the racks
provided or in rows adjacent
thereto.
