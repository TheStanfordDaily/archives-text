# Appian Way Under Fire; Nazis Counter at Cassino
## 
### 
ALLIED H Q.. ALGIERS (UP) —
Reinforced by tanks and artillery,
Allied, sea-borne, forces, have
smashed four miles inland and begun
shelling the Appian Way in swift
expansion ol their offensive at
Rome's doorstep with still no signs
ol the fully expected German coun
terattack. it was announced today.
(German broadcast said that the
Allies had made new landings north
west of Nettuno even closer to Rome,
which were violently opposed by
German shore batteries and planes.
Admitting that the landing forces
had gained the beaches the Germans
asserted an American destroyer was
sunk and two cruisers and a de
stroyer wer* so damaged that they
withdrew.)
(The Rome broadcast quoted by
the Swiss radio said the Allies had
captured Cisterna Di Littoria on the
Appian Way, which would represent
an advance of 12 miles inland. Ger
man broadcasts reported Allied con
trol of the town.)
(London press dispatches early
Tuesday said that the Fifth was re
ported only 20 miles from Rome and
four miles from the Appian Way.)
The Nazis already had counter
attacked violently on the lower Ital
ian front which had been detoui'ed
in Saturday's bold sea flanking oper
ation and with powerful blows drove
American troops back across the Ra
pido river from their bridgehead be
low Cassino. Only a heroic stand
after they ran out of bullets enabled
the Americans to withdraw across
the stream intact.
The next 24 hours, a military com
mentator said, could be decisive te
the outcome of the outflanking
movement and Gen. Sir Henry Wil
son warned that the Germans were
probably preparing counterattacks
which might touch off another bloody
Salerno.

Gloucester, New Britain Island. Best that he and his com
panions can do is to try to keep rifles and ammunition dry.
