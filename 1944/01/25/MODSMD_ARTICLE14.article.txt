# Two Short Stories
## 
### 
HERE is a story about a girl, a lowly member of
the Daily staff, who came home one night long,
long ago, quite overcome with self-importance.
For she had just heard big news hot off the
presses. And she stopped the first person she
ran into back at Roble.
"You know what," in hallowed tones, "Singa
pore has just fallen!"
This "person" didn't really stop but called ac
commodatingly back as she went on.
"And where the heck is that? And what does
it matter?"
Now this particular "person" had a very high
bawl-out average. She still has. Probably be
cause she doesn't waste time on things like
'Singapore."
Then there's the one about another girl who
saw the huge headline "Attu Taken" not so long
ago and asked the friend next to her.
"Betcha don't know where Attu is—"
"I do too —of course I know where Attu is—"
"Okay then, tell me, where is it?"
"Well, it's—well, everyone knows it's in—
Worth Africa."
Now this girl didn't have a high bawl-out
average. Just about normal, like everybody
else's. No doubt she spent too much time on
Attu and things like that.
Both of these stories are quite true. And they
are not so impossible as they sound. Do you
know where Sarny, Cape Gloucester, Cassino,
Madang, and the Pripet Marshes are?
And what does it matter? Well, it means, for
one thing, that you aren't even glancing through
that United Press column the Daily runs so faith
fully day after day. Because some of those
places have been running there as often in the
last few weeks as Singapore and Attu were a
while back.
It means, too, that maps have got something
to do with it. We are therefore going to make
it a part of Daily policy to run a map at least
once a week.
There are a lot of other answers to the "what
does it matter?" question. Some people say

there's a war on. While we sit here in com
placent comfort people are dying. And we don't
even know where they're dying.
Then there are other people who say the
future of our country, perhaps of the world, lies
in the hands of the college student.
Or they say it is simply a part of intelligent
living in our particular time to know what goes ;
on in Russia and New Guinea-—Singapore and
Attu.
It's hard to know the truth of such answers.
They don't seem to belong exactly to yourself
or to any one person. But they sound right.
Probably they are.
But there are some advantages to reading
U.P., to knowing what goes on, of which you can
be sure.
For instance, you will always have something
to tell your grandchild, the one who asks "And
what did you do in the last war?"
And it does give you an all-out-of-proportion
sense of superiority to know that Attu is not
in North Africa.
So please try the Daily's U.P. column—after
you've read Bull Session and Campus Opinion,
of course—at least a couple of times a week,
won't you?"— Nancy Tilden
