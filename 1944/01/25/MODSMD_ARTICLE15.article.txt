Dear Mrs. R:

Ya see, Elenor, #1 feel dat I reely now ya#
I'm wat dey call a playgoil. I love to go to
partees and have reallots of fun .... dancin,
playin games . . . and stuff.
Also I very much enjoie goin to the cinema
and am an entooseastic fan. Foidermore, I just
adore goin out on dates wid de fellas in de
soivice .... Dat is, to be more explisite . . . wid
de sailer, solgers, marins and de like. I enjoie
dis a reel lot and also feel dat I'm doin my part
in makin de fellas happy.
In my spare time I like to experement wid
differant shades of nail polesh, and I yam
fascinated wid readin movie magazenes and
lookin at the pitchers of my favorette flick stars.
Also I very much am parshal to chattin wid
de goils of an evenin about diffarent topiks, like
sports, men, movees, men, dietin, men, clothes,
men, and stuff like that. I find this very re
freshin indeed and also am very much fond of it.

time to do my homwork in. Which gives ris to
de fac dat my studees is sorly neglekful and
I'm doin sadly in all my corses, which I enjoie
very much and am very fond of really as a whol
really I like. What shul I do pleaze? â€¢
Waitin wid antisipashun,
Letitia Looselife.
Dear Miss Looselife:
I heartily commend you for your unswerving
endurance and unselfish activities in the war
effort. However, Letitia (I feel that I really know
you), I would suggest that you give up much
of your movie-going and attend educational per
formances such as a Tuesday Evening Series.
Furthermore, abstain from your cinematic liter
ature and study your lessons every night, and
I feel sure you will lead a full and happy life.
Watch it!
Eleanor.
