### JIM WEINBERG 
Hank Luisetti, whose name has
been prominent in sports headlines
in the Bay Area for 10 years now,
is still going strong and is having an
other great season this year. Alter
leading his St. Mary's Pre-Flighters
to victory over Jim Pollard and the
Alameda Coast Guard team a week
ago, Hank tame back over the past
weekend to tally 52 points in two
games.
At St. Mary's Friday night, Lui
setti managed to ring up 27 points as
I his team trounced the Coast Guard
Surf Eiders, 65-32. The following
night, at Kezar Pavilion in San Fran
cisco, Hank was held to a mere 25 as
the Pre-Flights won again, this time
from Hammer Field, 73-3(5.
The scores recorded in the college
games in this area so far this season
have been exceptionally small. The
boys just don't have the shooting
eyes they've had in past years, or
perhaps it would be more accurate to
say that those who do have them
aren't playing college ball anymore.
The scores in the first two South
ern Division Conference games are
good illustrations of this tendency.
In the first, UCLA beat USC, 33-19,
and in the second Cal downed the
Trojans, 2G-24. Last Friday's Bruin-
Trojan game was an exception,
largely because of the huge number
of free throws. As one San Francisco
sports writer put it yesterday, it
seems that 30 points is getting to be
par for the course on the local hard
woods.
