## Winter Mural Cage League Begins Play 
### FRANK CREEDE 
The hardwood of the Pavilion was
j covered with the sweat of the hard
j fighting McKinley A boys and the
! pride gf what constituted the squad
!of Adams Hall. McKinley out
pointed, outran, and generally walked
over Adams by a score of 71-10. The i
boys from Adams were just not in
the game. They tried, but McKin
ley's teamwork, coordination, and
precision was just too much for them.
Monday's Daily predicted a victory
for Adams, however, this game
turned into what may be the greatest
upset of this yet new season. The
, McKinley boys are the ones to
watch from now on; they are cham
pionship bound. It's still early, but
last night's performance definitely
puts McKinley in the championship
running.
Med. School Wins
The score of the second game, be
tween Med. School and Arthur Hall,
indicates that the game was a walk :
away, but this is not the case. The
Med. School boys won from Arthur,
58-23. However, the game was hard
i fought and full of action, with the j
Med. School taking a decided ad- j
vantage in the first few minutes of ;
play. It certainly had none of the j
bloody slaughter that was witnessed
in the McKinley-Adams game.
Last night's games were played
] under the ruling that if a man makes j
four fouls he is out of the game for
j three minutes, and for each subse- j
I quent foul thereafter, another three- !
j minute penalty is imposed. All games
j were played with 20-minute halves
| between which there was a 10-
minute rest time. No time outs were
allowed during playing time.
i Tonight's Gaines
Today's games are: McKinley B vs.
Lincoln at 7:15, and Tyler vs. Bu
chanan in Encina Gym at 8:15; Mon
roe vs. Roble Hashers at 7:15 and
Gerona A.C. vs. Fillmore at 8:15 in
the pavilion. There are no army
games scheduled for tonight.
It was previously announced that
games would be scheduled only three
games a week, however, the unex
pected turn-out of 16 teams made I
this impossible. Therefore, civilian :
intramural games will be played four '
nights a week, Monday, Tuesday,
Wednesday, and Thursday.
