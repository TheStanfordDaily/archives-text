# Student Crews Aid in Harvest
## 
### 
lii a report from the Farm Exten
sion Service which was released to
the Daily yesterday Irene Fagin, as
sistant state supervisor announced
that women farm volunteers had ac
counted for more than 10 per cent
of California's 1 harvest.
"A large group, numbering from
"12 to 15 thousand are not included
in our Farm Labor records as they
applied direct to farmers in their
vicinity for jobs in fruit or berry
harvests," she reported.
Included in this group are the
Stanford students who helped in the
crop crew work last spring, summer,
and fall. During Fall Quarter the
committee under the chairmanship
of Barbara Pike sent out 180 students
to pick walnuts. These pickers spent
700 hours over four weekends, and
50 girls totaled 200 hours of work
picking tomatoes.
This was in addition to the. work
that was done at the Convalescent
Home where 10 girls worked every
weekend till Thanksgiving.
Although there is no crop work
being done this quarter, it is expect
ed that it will be continued when the
need arises. Workers will be needed
for Victory gardening at the Conva
lescent home later on.
With regard to work in 1944 Miss
Fagin has said: "We'll need more
volunteers than ever if this increased
food production is to be harvested to
help shorten the war."
