# Bach Heads Best 10 Recordings

(Editor's Note: This is the first of
a projected series of articles on the
best in recorded music. This one on
the best in classical instrumental
music, is written by* Barney Gugel,
Daily Review Editor.)

It is an extremely difficult job to
make a list of the 10 best classical
music recordings, for very likely no
two people could ever be found who
would completely agree on the
choices.
In compiling this list, this writer
has attempted to limit the field to
recordings ol' the two major record
companies and to recordings of in
strumental music.
1 and 2. Bach. Brandenburg Con
certos, Columbia, albums 249 and 250.
Adolf Busch and his Chamber Or
chestra perform the six Brandenburg
Concertos in the spirit of Bach's time
and not as works written for a full
symphony orchestra. Besides the
Busch group, the albums features
such soloists as Rudolph Serkin,
George Eskdale, the Brain brothers
and others.
Of special interest is the superb
trumpet playing of George Eskdale
in the Second Concerto, which calls
for fast and difficult passages well
above high C.
3. Mozart, Symphony No. 38
(Prague), Columbia M 509. It is al
most universally accepted that Sir
Thomas Beecham is one of the great
est living interpreters of Mozart.

Beecham has recorded all the well
known Mozart Symphonies on Co
lumbia, but the recording of the
Prague is a little better than others
in that it is a more modern recording
and does not have a hall echo which
many of the recordings of the Lon
don Philharmonic do.
4. Schumann, Concerto for piano
in A minor, Victor M 473. Myra Hess,
one of the world's leading woman
pianists, and an unnamed symphony
orchestra under the leadership of
Walter Gohr give an excellent per
formance of this difficult work. Miss
Hess plays the Concerto flawlessly
and it is very well recorded.
5. Beethoven, Symphony No. 3
(Eroica), Columbia M 285. The late
Felix Weingartner was noted for his
performances of the Beethoven Sym
phonies. The Vienna Philharmonic
under his leadership waxed all nine
of the Beethoven Symphonies for
Columbia and although some of them
are poorly recorded, they have not
been matched by other conductors as
far as interpretation is concerned.
The Eroica is the best of these re
cordings, although the Ninth Sym
phony runs a good close second.
6. Mozart, Symphony No. 41 (Jupi
ter), Victor M 584. Bruno Walter has
the edge on Sir Thomas Beecham in
the performance of this monumental
work. The Walter recording is ex
tremely clear except in certain por
tions of the complicated fourth move
ment. This does not seriously inter
fere with the enjoyment of the al
bum, however.

7. Beethoven, Quartet No. 12,
Opus 127, Victor M 489. This album,
done by the Busch String Quartet,
is, as far as interpretation is con
cerned, one of the best chamber
music recordings ever made. Bee
thoven's last quartets have proved
stumbling blocks to many major
string quartets, but the Busch group
comes through with an excellent
rendition.
8. Beethoven, Concerto No. .'i for
piano in C minor, Victor M 194. Ar
tur Schnabel specializes in Beethoven
and taking everything into consider
ation, his waxing of the Third has
an edge on his recordings of the
other four, even though it is a much
older recording than the others. No
other pianist has yet put out an al
bum which approaches Schnabel's
performance of this work.
9. Debussy, La Mer, Victor M 643.
Serge Koussevitsky and the Boston
Symphony have put out a large
number of recordings, but their per
formance of La Mer is just about
tops. The recording is full and clear.
10. Beethoven, Concerto for violin.
Columbia M 177. Some people like
Heifitz and some people like Szigeti,
and the controversy probably will
never be decided. This writer pre
fers Szegeti and the Szegeti record
ing of the Beethoven Concerto even
though the recording is quite old and
a bit fuzzy. As to which is actually
better, it's a toss-up which really
puts yours truly out on a limb.
