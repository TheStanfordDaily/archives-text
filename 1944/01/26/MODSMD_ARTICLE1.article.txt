ALLIED HEADQUARTERS. ALGIERS, (UP) —
American troops, throwing a new bridgehead across
the Rapido River, reached Cassino today and found the
Germans had abandoned that stronghold of their south
Italian front in what appeared to be the beginning of
a general enemy withdrawal to avoid being trapped by
the new landings below Rome.
An American patrol entered Cassino and found the
town desserted except for a solitary German sentry, a

dispatch from an advanced command post revealed, but
the patrol was forced to withdraw later under cover of
darkness due to the fire of German rear-guard bat
teries on the surrounding hills.
As Allied armored spearheads drove 12 miles inland
from Nettuno and across the Appian Way on the new
front below Rome the Americans farther south found
a marked decrease in enemy opposition as they re
turned to the offensive.
