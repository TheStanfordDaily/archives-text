### JEAN LEVINSON 
MISCELLANEOUS TIDBITS
All the sweet young things who have made out Pledge Cards
for war work must return said cards to the War Board office by
Thursday. Another thing .... Carol (roll that bandage) Hurwitz
is pleading for gals to go to the Surgical Dressing Room in the
Women's Clubhouse, any time from 9 to 12 and 1 to 4 .... to
roll bandages. This is a "must" for everyone who wants to help
out in the war effort. Heavens, it's a cinch to do, and you can ac
complish something worthwhile and gossip at the same time . . .
what a setup. Now, get going!
Caroline (buy that "Quad") Kuhns informs me that said publi
cation will be on sale every Tuesday this month on the History
and Engineering corners from 9 to 12 and 1 to 2:30. If you enjoy
reading, the "Quad" has fascinating reading matter, and for
those less fortunate that have never mastered the art of reading,
there are thousands of purty pictures .... so be sure and buy
your "Quad" early.
This is to remind all potential playwrights that the Ram's Head
One-Act play deadline ends this Friday, Jan. 28, so hubba hubba
with those scripts and send them around to Moofie (I love the
theatah) Faris pronto!
It sems that the lon Whitcoms and the Leonardo De Vincis of
our University badly need models to pose for them .... and
men are needed particularly (you can say that again). Sounds
like a fascinating way of earning a dollar an hour, and you can
see the artist at work .... on his canvas. How's about it?
