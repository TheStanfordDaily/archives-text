# Sensabaugh Says English Study Teaches Democracy
## 
### 
1 In a speech at the Jordan Junior
I High School Friday night. Dr. George
j Sensabaugh, assistant professor of
English, declared that the teaching
! of literature and English should be
j in some way integrated within our
| country's democratic ideals and
j values.
Speaking before an audience of 45
j teachers, most of them from the Eng
| lish Department, Dr. Sensabaugh as
! serted that the study of literature
i must give the young people of our
j country the tools which v/ill enable
them to communicate exactly what
; is in their minds and the tools for
: distinguishing the clear from tfr.*
I confused in expression.
Continuing, Dr. Sensabaugh af
firmed his belief that through liter
! ature, the vision needed by the
| young people to keep alive the mem- i

ory of the intangibles, without which
a democracy cannot continue to
exist, can be obtained.
In relation to the question of how
literature should be taught, Dr.
Sensabaugh contrasted the contents
ol the old McGufley Fourth Reader,
which devotes itself chiefly to quali
ties instead of facts, with a 1943
reader which discusses economic
topics, giving a sound idea of global
interdependence and our necessity of
adjusting ourselves to this society.
He pointed out that "by deter
mined adjustment we get a fixed so
ciety such as that in which Germany
started developing in 1848. McGuffy
at least held up ideals," he declared.
"Too perfect an adjustment would
cut off vision and then the nation
would solidify. Our democratic in
tangibles, such as honor and chivalry
ire preserved in literature.
