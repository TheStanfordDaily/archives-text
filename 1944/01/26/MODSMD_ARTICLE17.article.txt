## MURAL BASKETBALL Roble Hashers Romp Over Monroe, 56-8 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Getting off to a low flying start in
their initial game of the current
mural basketball season, the highly
touted Roble Hashers trounced their
underdog Monroe opponents by a
decisive score of 56 to 8.
fLeon Watson, tricky little forward
for the hashers, led his team to the

| victory by tallying 18 points; he was
closely followed by "Bones" Hal
stead who rang the bell for 16 digits.
The winners featured some smart
floor play and all-around good,
straight basketball in their lopsided
victory over Monroe.
They certainly lived up to pre
! season expectations and proved that
they are definitely in the race for the
league title. Next Thursday night
| they will test their potential strength
against the Washington Hall boys,
i also an undefeated team.
While the Hashers were running
wild in the Encina Gym, another
I slaughter was being executed in the
! Pavilion, where Lincoln put the cork
! on the McKinley B team's bottle and
! took them into camp by a score of
52-22. At the beginning, the game
| looked fairly even, but toward the
! end of the first half the Lincoln boys
went wild and opened up with a bar
j rage of buckets from all corners of
t the court.
Roger Corinan took the honors of
j high-point man for the winners as
i well as for the game with 16 markers,
I while Bob More paced the losers
: with 14.
The two top tilts on tonight's card
features the Med School against Mc-
Kinley A, and the Firehouse versus
Lincoln. All four teams concerned
| are undefeated as yet and this play
j off will tend to eliminate a couple of
I them from the ranks of the unde-
J feated. Judging by past perform
'■ ances. McKinley should take the Med
' School by a slight margin, while the
j Firehouse rates an edge over Lin-
I coin.
In the other two games of the night
| the Fillmore Floggers won from Ge
| rona AC by a score of 46 to 26, while
[Buchanan defaulted to Tyler because
{ of the use of an illegal man.

The two top tilts on tonight's card
features the Med School against Mc-
Kinley A, and the Firehouse versus
Lincoln. All four teams concerned
| are undefeated as yet and this play
j off will tend to eliminate a couple of
I them from the ranks of the unde-
J feated. Judging by past perform
'■ ances. McKinley should take the Med
' School by a slight margin, while the
j Firehouse rates an edge over Lin-
I coin.
In the other two games of the night
| the Fillmore Floggers won from Ge
| rona AC by a score of 46 to 26, while
[Buchanan defaulted to Tyler because
