WASHINGTON, (UP)—The House Military Affairs
Committee may recommend that the Army and Navy
scrap their student training program to slow down the
drafting of pre-Pearl Harbor fathers by making some
200.000 younger men available for combat, it was re
vealed today.
The committee is now nearing the end of secret
sessions to hear military officials explain the schools
and a poll of members showed they favored abandon
ing all training programs except those pertaining to
Paedicine, dentistry, and government of occupied areas.
'Theses tudents generally are fine, able-bodied young
men who are just the type neded for combat duty," one
member of the committee said. "We found that in some

cases there are four different army programs teaching
these foreign languages and tying them up where they
are doing no god.
"Just why we should be drafting pre-war fathers and
leaving these boys in school is beyond me."
Describing the present program as "unfair," "dis
criminating," Representative Charles H. Elston said
that "men being alerted for overseas duty are not per
mitted to go to these schools, but those who are going
to remain in this country for a while are allowed to
attend.
"There are boys in the service who can speak French,
German, Russian, and other languages and yet we send
others to school to learn those languages," he declared.
