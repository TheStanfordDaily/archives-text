freezing state of Colorado. I'm about

a week at the Presidio of Monterey. I
The third day at Monterey I spent 15
hours at K.P. The fifth day I spent
12 hours at K.P. Not much fun, I
assure you.
"One concilation, however, is that
I'm in the Air Force and have a
good chance of becoming a second

pilot, navigator, or bombardier. I'm
here at Buckley Field for approxi
mately five weeks, during which time
I will have basic."
