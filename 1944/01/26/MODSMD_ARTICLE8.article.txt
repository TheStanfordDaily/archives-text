# Army Show Seeks Talent for Play
## 
### 
Three or four small parts are still
open in "The Army Play by Play,"
according to Bud Irving, production
manager. Any army students who
are interested in appearing in this
all-soldier show should come to the
Memorial Hall this afternoon or to
morrow afternoon between 5 and 6
p.m.
The show will be comprised of
three one-act plays which were pro
duced on Broadway by John Golden.
Mr. Golden held a play-writing con
test last year in which soldiers all
over the country submitted original
one-act plays. Three of the five win
ning plays will be presented at Stan
ford by members of the ASTP under
the auspices of the speech and drama
department.
As there are separate casts for each
play and only one play is rehearsed
daily, army students in the plays
need not take too much time from
their studies. Special arrangements
have been made to eat "chow" at 6
for those participating in the pro
duction.
Stage crew members and specialty
acts are also needed. Those interested
should contact David Sievers of the
speech and drama department or
Bud Irving, Co. F. before the end of
the week.
