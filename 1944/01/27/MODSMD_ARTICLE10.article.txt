## 
### UNITED PRESS 
BUENOS AlRESâ€”Argentina, last haven in the whole Western Hemi
sphere for the Axis espionage which lias cost the Allies thousands of lives
and a multitude of ships, broke diplomatic relations with Germany and
Japan today.
Diplomatic quarters looked for early action to curtail Axis commerce,

trade, and finance.
Dr. Erich Otto Meynen, German
charge d'affairs, and Baron Shu To
mekii, Japanese ambassador, were
advised that passports were being
prepared which would permit them
and their staff, under Allied safe
conduct, to leave the country.
The ground for the Argentinian
break with the Axis was the revela
tion of a specific spy plot in this
country, uncovered as the result of
the arrest by British authorities in
Trinidad of Osmar Alberto Hellmuth,
declared to be an enemy agent.
