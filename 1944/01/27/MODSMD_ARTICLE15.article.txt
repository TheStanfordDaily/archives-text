The Drive-in is the gastronomical haven for
slothful diners. Theoretically it is a glorious
setup for caloric imbibers, for all one needs is
a four-wheeled vehicle (skooters are looked
upon with disdain), and several technological
methods of exchange jangling in the pocket.
That is all that one requires to be slowly tor
tured for five hours at the Drive-in.
Screeching to a halt in front of this glorified
beanery, you notice several sad looking cars
parked in front, with skeletons slumped over
the steering wheel and yellowed menus
clutched in their boney fingers .... patient cus
tomers, they!
Looking questioningly at this House of Usher
that serves out sustenance, you quietly beep
on the horn for 25 ear-splitting minutes, at the
end of which time a curly haired damsel peeks
out and delicately splits her lungs shrieking:
"Just a minute, just a minute, just a minute, just
â€ža ... . minute."
Taking out your pocket-size Encyclopedia you
prepare to spend your time in pursuing knowl
edge, and as you're diligently reading about
zebras, zymolosis, and zymoscopes, Sandwich
Sally leisurely waddles up to the car, resplend
ent in slacks and a nasty expression.
Leering evilly through the window (which
you have raised to protect yourself) she sez:
'Whatcha want, glutton?"
Your mouth has grown dry as a peanut but
ter sandwich, and your teeth feel as if they had
donned cashmere sweaters. Your eyes have
lost the power to focus, and through this fog of
famine you mutter: "Hamburger, shoes, and
coffee, quick .... I'm sinkin' fast."
The chill north wind is whistling merrily
through the car, and you hungrily watch the
contented customers eating at the counter in
side, where it is warm and friendly. But this is
a Drive-in and what's the sense of going inside
if you can get service from a sadistic car-hop?
She's coming at last .... yes, this vitamin
angel is actually bringing your order. Yawning,
she goes through several tired contortions and
finally manages to hook the tray to the side of
the car door, removing the remaining traces of
paint.
Greedily you shove away the mounds of
paper and find .... an old ginger snap, a stalk
of tired celery, and the check. Quickly ending
your life with this repast, you relax over your
wheel and prepare to join your neighbors in
the Happy Hunting Grounds, where the ham
burger is running around on the hoof, and
Drive-ins are only a form of torture for people
who don't buy enough War Bonds and Stamps.
