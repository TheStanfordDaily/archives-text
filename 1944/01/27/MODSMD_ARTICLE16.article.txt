To the Editor:
I am writing this letter in behalf of my favorite
columnist, Mr. Dash ( —) Bower. I can no longer
sit by and see that poor sincere critic flogged
by the film fanatics of the campus.
For a long time I have wondered why Amer

ica's most popular entertainment was not for me,
it is good to know that one other person in the
country feels the persistent artistic attempts of
the Hollywoodites as inciting to nausea.
The hulking campus brutes who blame Bower
for the inadequacies of cinemaland should be
ashamed of themselves.
I hope this letter will offer consolation to the
brave man who alone and calumniated is fight
ing a one-man crusade for adult entertainment.

To the Editor:
Yesterday's Daily ran an article on the com
ing Sophomore Cotillion. If you will remember
back to about the middle of last quarter, you
will find that the Daily ran an article on the
1942 Cotillion. The article of last quarter
brought back fond memories of a wonderful
dance with a wonderful orchestra, Duke Elling
ton. This was one of the last "big name" bands
that has hit the campus.
This writer agrees with the committee on the
Cotillion that to give a good dance you must
have a good dance band. I think that the ma
jority of the students would not mind paying a
little extra to cover the increase in cost in order
to have a good band. It is sure that the bids will
be somewhere in the range of $3 if there is a
"big name" band or not, but by paying a little
more in proportion to the $3, it is sure to give a
dance that will be two or three times better.
It may also be possible to cut down on deco
ra cost a little in favor of a good band. Many
new students and soldiers on campus have
never been to a Cotillion and many of them
have never been to a big Stanford dance, so
let's "shell out" a little more and have a real
"bang up" dance.

To the Editor:
In the Daily yesterday, we noticed that many
of the men's halls did not report, and some did
not participate in, the sales of war stamps held
in the halls a short time ago.
It seems to us that these halls could have
shown more spirit and collected the few pen
nies which the War Board asked us to donate.
We do not believe that 25 cents per week
(and that is all it amounts to) is too much to ask
from anyone to help further the war effort.
In our opinion, those who have not yet bought
their share of war stamps should wake up to
the fact that there is a war on and kick in by
buying some stamps or bonds the week of
the Cal-Stanford bond drive.

To the Editor:
Boy! Was I hauled through the fire! The
annual staff's hierarchy fairly tore me apart —
but many of us didn't know that an effort had
been made to get the soldiers interested in the
Quad.
If we had, we'd have eager-beavered all over
the place to hustle subscriptions and stuff. I'm
so sorry about my unjust tirade that I'll (1) buy
S5OO bond in the forthcoming contest wth Cal;
(2) order two copies of Nan's yearbook; (3)
blow the whole darned annual staff to a stein of
suds at Dinah's; and—most significantly—l will
apologize to the charming threesome a la Ish
Kabibble:
Ten thousand "I'm sorries" to Nan of the Quad,
To Caroline and Ginny, whom I don't think
half baud.
But 'ere you condemn lack of G.I. enthusiasm,
Be grateful that others ain't nearly as chusiasm.
To attone for implying your book's in a muddle
I await your photog—with my head in that
puddle!
Repentfully yours,
Richard Switt.
(Tell your bond committee to have that 5 "C"
bond there and I'll fork over. Can't afford to
have the literati mad at me.)

I am writing this letter in behalf of my favorite
columnist, Mr. Dash ( —) Bower. I can no longer
sit by and see that poor sincere critic flogged
by the film fanatics of the campus.
For a long time I have wondered why Amer

ica's most popular entertainment was not for me,
it is good to know that one other person in the
country feels the persistent artistic attempts of
the Hollywoodites as inciting to nausea.
The hulking campus brutes who blame Bower
for the inadequacies of cinemaland should be
ashamed of themselves.
I hope this letter will offer consolation to the
brave man who alone and calumniated is fight
ing a one-man crusade for adult entertainment.

To the Editor:
Yesterday's Daily ran an article on the com
ing Sophomore Cotillion. If you will remember
back to about the middle of last quarter, you
will find that the Daily ran an article on the
1942 Cotillion. The article of last quarter
brought back fond memories of a wonderful
dance with a wonderful orchestra, Duke Elling
ton. This was one of the last "big name" bands
that has hit the campus.
This writer agrees with the committee on the
Cotillion that to give a good dance you must
have a good dance band. I think that the ma
jority of the students would not mind paying a
little extra to cover the increase in cost in order
to have a good band. It is sure that the bids will
be somewhere in the range of $3 if there is a
"big name" band or not, but by paying a little
more in proportion to the $3, it is sure to give a
dance that will be two or three times better.
It may also be possible to cut down on deco
ra cost a little in favor of a good band. Many
new students and soldiers on campus have
never been to a Cotillion and many of them
have never been to a big Stanford dance, so
let's "shell out" a little more and have a real
"bang up" dance.

To the Editor:
In the Daily yesterday, we noticed that many
of the men's halls did not report, and some did
not participate in, the sales of war stamps held
in the halls a short time ago.
It seems to us that these halls could have
shown more spirit and collected the few pen
nies which the War Board asked us to donate.
We do not believe that 25 cents per week
(and that is all it amounts to) is too much to ask
from anyone to help further the war effort.
In our opinion, those who have not yet bought
their share of war stamps should wake up to
the fact that there is a war on and kick in by
buying some stamps or bonds the week of
the Cal-Stanford bond drive.
