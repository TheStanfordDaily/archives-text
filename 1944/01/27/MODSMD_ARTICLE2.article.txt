# Student Music Room To Open Next Monday
## 
### 
Classical music will soon come
into its own on the Stanford campus
with the opening of a music appre
ciation room next Monday in the
Old Union Building, Marie Schvva
bacher, chairman of the committee
announced during an interview.
In order to provide sufficient mu
sic, either as records or in sheet form,
Miss Schwabacher added that dona
tions, gifts, and loans would have to
come from the students and faculty.
Loans of record were particularly
encouraged, and the chairman
stressed the fact that there would be
a responsible person on duty all day
to assure their proper handling.
Open to everyone, the room does
"ot officially begin functioning until
next Monday. Refurnishing and dec
orating the room is being carried out
now, so Miss Schwabacher urged
that no one use the room until it is
completed.
Such an excellent room set aside
for the enjoyment of line music will
be a real boon to Stanford music
lovers.
