## MURAL BASKETBALL Tricky Mckinley Team Gains Close Victory Over Medics 
### FRANK CREEDE 
Swift, tricky McKinley Hall took a
close win from the bigger but clumsy
Med School boys in a game which
was won on foul shots. The score
was 24-20. The game cbuld have
gone either way until the last few
minutes when the McKinley quintet
put a few long shots through the
twine.
Donahoe had the top tally for Mc-
Kinley with 14 points. Holms and
Peale shared the honors for the Med
School boys with eight digits each.
Tom MartzlofT, who scored 18 points
for McKinley last Monday night, was
held to a mere four points. Had
Martzloff been up to par McKinley

| might have run away from the Med
i School boys.
Lowly Adams Hall, which tallied
a pitiful 10 points Monday night, was
given a shot in the arm by three
Garfield boys, and won from Hayes
33-27. The game was not so close as
the score indicates, as Adams always
Had a lead of one or two goals. The
; high scorers for Adams were Grey,
Rosberg, and Vishoot, while Hunt
and Morrison took the honors for
| Hayes.
j McKinley is going to have an easy
I schedule for the next few weeks, but
jin February it meets the Roble
Hashers in a game which may decide
the civilian league championship.
I The Hashers looked good against
Monroe, however, we'll have to wait
until they have a few tough games
J under their belt before we make any
i predictions.
In the first of tonight's tilts the
I Roble Hashers should take an easy
; one from Washington, Tyler should
| win from Gerona A.C. comfortably,
| Fillmore figures to edge out Monroe,
and Buchanan should slide past Mc
j Kinley B in the closest game of the
; evening.
