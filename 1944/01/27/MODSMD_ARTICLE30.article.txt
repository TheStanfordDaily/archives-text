# ‘Y’ Begins Survey Of Race Problems
## 
### 
When the Race Relations Group of
the YWCA met yesterday afternoon,
the members made plans for their
survey of the Negro-White problem
in Palo Alto. Mr. John Robinson,
graduate student, outlined the meth
ods to be used by the Stanford wom
en when they interview the White
residents.
Negro interviewers in Palo Alto
will question the Negroes in accord
ance with the questionnaire which
the "Y" group has approved. The
results will then be tabulated and
compared in order to furnish the
group with an adequate background
for further study of the problem.
The next meeting of the group,
which will be directed by Virginia
Butler, will be devoted to discussion
of prejudices as oriented toward
Jewish people. A Jewish leader on
the campus will speak at this time in
order to acquaint the .students with
any problem which may exist.
