## 
### 
The Stanford Band will start har
monizing tonight at 7:30 in the Band
House, Manager Pfc. Jack Pickering
announced yesterday. This is the
first organization meeting for the
band this quarter. Next Monday's
bond rally will get the benefit of a
spirited band, provided tonight's
turnout is enthusiastic.
Civilian and army students are
both urged to attend, and soldiers
are reminded that they will be ex
cused in order to attend, the or
ganization meting.
Clarinets and trumpets, as always
is the case when organizing a band,
will be in greatest demand. Men who
can play these instruments are par
ticularly urged to attend.
All musicians should bring their
instruments with them so the or
ganizing can begin immediately.
There is a supply of instruments at
the Band House, and any man who
can not procure his own may be is
sued one of these: however, Picker
ing urged that musicians have their
own instruments.
