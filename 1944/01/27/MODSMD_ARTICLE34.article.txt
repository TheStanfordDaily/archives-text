# Women Students Begin Stamp Sale
## 
### 
Women students are asked to buy
War Stamps today from stamp rep
resentatives in their residences. This
is the second stamp day of the quar
ter to be held in women's living
groups.
Contrary to the story in Monday's
Daily about the War Bond Drive
with Cal, women should buy stamps
this week, because their regular
purchases for this week will not
count if saved until next week. War
Bond purchases, however, should be
saved until the drive.
All results of stamp sales must be
reported to Marion Falck, chairman
of stamp safes in women's residences,
by 7:30 tonight. Shirley Jamieson
will obtain the results of stamp sales
on the Row, Marion Kirkpatrick at
Roble. Peggy Russell at Lagunita.
Elaine Byers at Union, and Jean
Watson at Ventura.
