# Russia Emphasizes Importance Of Studies Even in Wartime
## 
### 
Students in the Soviet Union are
! continuing their studies despite all
that the war has brought to their
country, some of them even return
ing from the front to receive their
degrees. This report was received
from the World Student Service
Fund.
Before the war a great network of
universities, institutes, technical
schools and academies covered the
Soviet Union. The government spent
tremendous sums in building and
equipping education institutions. The
total number of college students
reached the two-million mark.
The war brought drastic changes.
Demolition bombs wrecked the state
ly buildings of Moscow University.
The Germans turned the splendid old
university buildings in Kiev, Minsk,
and Odessa into stables. Thousands
of students, both men and women,
took their places behind guns, in
hospitals, in factories.
The Soviet government was far
sighted enough to see, however that
the work of its universities was of
the first importance to the war effort.
I Students were therefore allowed the
I option of exemption from military
| service, on the condition that they
! complete four years work in three or
even two years.
Many students and professors
: waived this right and joined the Red
' Army or the guerillas; but many
i others realized that their greatest
i contribution could be made by com
pleting their higher studies. Some
| students have done both.
A report reached the World Stu-
I dent Service Fund that the Lomono
; sov State University in Moscow con
ferred scientific degrees this June on
j a number of soldiers who came from
1 the front especially to defend their
dissertations. For example, a Ph.D.
was conferred upon Guard Captain
V. Yevgrafov, one of the defenders of
'■ Stalingrad who was awarded the
' "For Valor" medal.
The Russian universities, like those
in China, did not take their bombings
j supinely. Students and staff moved
j to the interior; and along with in
dustrial plants evacuated to the east
went trainloads of books, laboratory
instruments, and other study mate
i rials.

The dislocation of student life has
not aflected enrollment to any great
extent. This autumn 12,000 new stu
dents enrolled in the universities.
Men discharged from active service
because of wounds and other dis
abilities constitute a considerable
number of those accepted.
Despite wartime conditions the de
sire of young people to study Ls un
usually strong. American students
through the World Student Service
Fund, have raised money to buy
books and equipment for Russia;

Students in the Soviet Union are

Before the war a great network of
universities, institutes, technical
schools and academies covered the
Soviet Union. The government spent
tremendous sums in building and
equipping education institutions. The
total number of college students
reached the two-million mark.
The war brought drastic changes.
Demolition bombs wrecked the state
ly buildings of Moscow University.
The Germans turned the splendid old
university buildings in Kiev, Minsk,
and Odessa into stables. Thousands
of students, both men and women,
took their places behind guns, in
hospitals, in factories.
The Soviet government was far
sighted enough to see, however that
the work of its universities was of
the first importance to the war effort.
I Students were therefore allowed the
I option of exemption from military
| service, on the condition that they
! complete four years work in three or
even two years.
Many students and professors
: waived this right and joined the Red
' Army or the guerillas; but many
i others realized that their greatest
i contribution could be made by com
pleting their higher studies. Some
| students have done both.
