Manzanita, 100' '<, $4.25; Hawthorne,

Magnolia, 36'r, $12.25. Eucalypto
and Naranja failed to report.
Ventura and the How also failed
to report this week.
The failure of so many of the
women's living groups to report this
week is attributed to the fact that
everybody is saving their bond and
stamp money for the contest with
Cal next week, according to Miss
Faulk. It is hoped that huge sales
next week will more than make up
for this week's discrepancies.
