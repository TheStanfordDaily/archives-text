# The 						Two-Wheeled Menace
## 
### 
RECENTLY the Daily ran a short squib about
the request of Gordy Davis, Stanford chief of
police, that there be no more bicycling in colon
nades of the Quad. He also asked that bicycles
be kept entirely off Quad and parked in the racks
Dutside of the Quad or in rows adjacent to these
racks.
Mr. Davis' request was published three days
ago. But somehow bicycles still zoom in and out
Df the colonnades, causing pedestrians to wonder
if it's safe to lackadaisacally wander down Quad
without first peering around every corner for
tear of an onrush of mad cyclists trying to make
a class.
There's no doubt that it's convenient to swing
Dnto the Quad through the big iron gates, pump
â€¢he speedometer up to seven miles an hour, and
skid up to v/ithin two feet of your next class. But
University regulations prohibit bicycles on Quad
and for good reasons.
First, it's a dangerous proposition. There has
been more than one collision between cyclists,
and more than one student has been knocked
down by a cyclist. As yet, no one has been se
riously injured, but two wheels can do as much
damage as four.
Second, the Quad, usually impressive because
Df its orderly, balanced makeup, looks as though
some giant had picked up a handful of bicycles,
thrown them up in the air, and let them land
where they might.
Mr. Davis doesn't want to police the Quad. He
doesn't want to hide behind corners, waiting
to tag cyclists as they whiz by. Neither does he
want to close the big iron gates; it's much easier
for a company of men to march through the
gates rather than up and down the steps.
And so for all these reasons the chief of police
tias asked us to cooperate in alleviating the situ
ation. It shouldn't be hard.
