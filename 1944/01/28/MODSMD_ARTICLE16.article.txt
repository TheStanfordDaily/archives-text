# Page Six

### 
PAGE SIX of today's Daily is a product of the
minds and hands of Stanford's Army students.
They took time out to come over to the Shack and

write what they believe Army and civilian stu
dents would like to read about the Army on
campus.
Contributors to the page were Pfcs. Gene Po
tente, Arthur Shapiro, Dario Covi, Victor Gual
ano, Cpls. Paul Gardner, Lloyd Sloan, and Sgt.
Lafe Allen.
Page six represents time and effort, and the
staff of the Stanford Daily welcomes these men
as weekly contributors.
