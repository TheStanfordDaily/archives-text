## "AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES" 
### JEAN LEVINSON Faith Birdwin 
(The story thus far): Pamela looks in the mir
ror and comes downstairs, opens the door, and
greets Geoffrey, who says:
"Pamela, I have something very important to
tell you . . . you see, I . . . well, I've requested
that I be sent overseas. I want to be in there
pitching with the gang, and I must pull out in
ten minutes."
Pamela, with the coy, icy composure of her
seventeen years, clenched her well-manicured
fist, gasped, and said: "No."
Geoffrey smiled tenderly and looking deep
into her El Greco blue eyes said: "You're a
brick, Pamela, truly a brick."
And so these two youthful lovers, who were
to be parted by the holocaust of war, sped like
the wind to the depot. The ominous voice of
the conductor cut through their silent thoughts
with, "All aboard, board."
Geoffrey took Pamela tenderly into his arms
as if she were some rare flower.
"Watch out for my orchids," murmured Pam,
crying softly all over the beige gabardine tunic.
"Adieu," whispered Geoffrey. "Adieu, little
one. Think of me . . . dream of me . . . and
wait for me . . . I'll come back to you when all
this is over, over there."
Pamela, with the cool, icy composure of her
seventeen years, bit her bold, sensuous lip and
squeaked, "Goodbye."
As the last strains of the train faded into the
night, Pamela entered the small depot cafe to
drink cocoa and forget. As the first drops of
the chocolate liquid began to warm her very ,
being, she noticed that a rugged, hard individual
was seated in juxtapostion to her at the counter.
Feeling the piercing gaze of this lovely crea
ture upon him, the man turned in his seat and
greeted her with: "Hello, you. I am Stephen,
and what are you called? I'd like to know you
better, much better, for you are a beaut, truly
a beaut."
Demurely Pamela lowered her eyes into her
cocoa and muttered: "I am called Pamela, but I
my three hundred and twenty-five friends call
Ime Pam ... you may call me Pam if you want to."
Stephen's resonant voice sent shivers up and
down Pamela's spinal column. "There is noth
ing on this earth that I would rather do than to
become an intimate friend of yours and call
you 'Pam.' May I?"
Not giving vent to the palpitating emotions
; fhat were playing havoc with her senses, Pam
! ela answered, "Yes."
Under cover of her abundant eyelashes, Pam
ela studied this intriguing man. His coal-black
hair was brushed straight back off an intelligent
forehead, and his eyes were the color of green
jade that had mellowed in some old antique
shop. But the thing that attracted Pam to Ste
phen the most was his cleft chin.
"Almost like Cary Grant," she murmured to
herself, pleased with her observation.
Stephen broke into her thoughts with, "Pam,
how about coming with me to the aircraft fac
tory where I work doing vital work for defense.
How about it-"
"No," said Pamela after a moment's hesitation,
"no." You see, I must confess to you that I'm
expecting . . .
