# ‘Bell’ Still Tolling; Grable at Varsity
## 
### 
Both Palo Alto theaters have good
bills this week-end for a very de
cided change and everyone can go
without their usual fear of languish
ing in boredom.
"For Whom the Bell Tolls" still
holds the screen at the Stanford, as
Ingrid Bergman and Gary Cooper
continue on their merry way in this
story of love and the Spanish Civil
War. You'd better go with a heavy
bankroll, as the evening tariff is
$1.10.
Bouncing Betty Grable sends our
hearts throbbing and our brains
reeling as she sings and swings
through the Varsity's current at
traction, "Sweet Rosie O'Grndy.''
Betty is cast as a former burlesque
queen who runs up against a lot
of trouble when she encounters Rob
ert Young, a reporter for the Police
Gazette. There are many good songs,
the most notable of which is prob

ably the current hit, "My Heart Tells
Me."
Tom Conway plays the title role in
i the second feature, "The Falcon in
i Danger." The less .said about this
i little thing the better.
i The Mayfield has Errol Flynn in
I the story oi' Custer's last stand,
i "They Died with Their Boots On."
j You'll probably die in your seat it
vou take in this Warner Brothers
j "hit."
I'd like to thank that dear soul
; who wrote that encouraging letter
which appeared in yesterday's
Daily. If that person would like an
autographed copy of my newest best
seller, "Nix Fix Hit Stix," he may
; have one by simply coming ovtgj to
| the Daily office and asking 18
i Dick Bower.
