# Faculty Gives Views on Vocational Fields
## Consensus of Occupational Opportunities Presented 
### BETYE MONELL 
February has been set aside as Vocational Month. Last November ques
tionnaires were circulated and girls were asked to check their vocational
choices in order of preference. Most popular fields in this poll were women
in foreign service, aviation, social service, and journalism. The three latter
subjects will be presented in Wednesday meetings next month. The polls
also showed women to be interested in so wide a variety of occupations
that they could not be discussed in meetings. To give Stanford women some
information on these fields, Vocom members selected from magazines and
newspapers material pertinent to these topics. Certain faculty members
were then asked to give their opinions on these articles. The following
k are the excerpts taken from publications and the faculty members' com
* ments on them.

Future in Aviation Industry
"The war's end will bring a sud
den recession in aircraft production
thought by many to exceed 90 per
cent. Peace will also bring home
from the front many men trained in
various branches of aviation and
desirous of earning their living in
that Held. Many will have the pledge
of preferential right to their old
jobs.
"Is it realistic to believe that un
der these conditions women will be
kept on to a substantial degree and
men will be laid off in great num
bers? I think not. The process is
more likely to be the reverse. Some
think that our national economy will
continue at a high pace leaving fac
tory work for numberless women.
But at its prewar level of national
production some six million women
must wend their way homeward.
"And as I have brought out, no
matter what our post-war level of
overall production, aviation produc
tion is sure to drop enormously.
Most, of the women who work in the
production end of aviation will join
the group returning home. But not
all. In the competitive world some
will stay on a pure efficiency basis,
apart from any question of pay dif
ferential. Some small parts of the
production line will be considered
as women's particular forte.
"Thus, there will be a career for
women in aviation production and
allied branches much more than be
fore the war, even though the pro
portion of women to men will be
small. The previous war left some
lasting imprint of women on indus
try and business, and the present
war will deepen that imprint.
"In the ground branches of flying
operations, women will have a
somewhat better proportionate op
portunity than in production. There
will probably be but few if any
women left as engine and plane me
chanics. But in weather forecasting
and broadcasting rooms and traffic
control towers women are very effi
cient, and the work is suited to their
sex. There will be great expansion
in this branch of aviation that can
absorb much of the returning skilled
male personnel . . .
"I can see women in the cockpit
of many of the small commercial
planes. I can see them at the con
trols of some of the small feeder
lines. I can see them in the traffic
control towers, and they are ideal
in the training of air students.
"But it is my considered judgment
that, when all is said and done, only
about 25 per cent of the WASPS
will continue to earn their living in
aviation."—Text of address by Jac
queline Cochran, November 16, 1943,
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.
Comment—by Anastasia Doyle,
Vocational Adviser for Women,
Stanford University:
"Miss Cochran has played the
leading role in organizing women
for war service as pilots. Some
were already trained aviators
when the WAFS and the WASPS
were established less than two
years ago. She is responsible for
much of the rigorous course of
study and training which has made
pilots out of raw recruits in a
matter of months.
"Some Stanford girls have
joined the WAFS (Women's Army
Flying Service). Among them are
Isahcll Stciner, who was gradu
ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op
portunities after the war, but
really am not competent to speak."
"Group Work
"Are you interested in Sealyhams,
psychology, Saroyan and the samba?
Do you like to cook, garden, travel
and sketch? Have you been wor
ried because you felt your nonex
pert skill in a number of things made
you a Jill-of-all-trades? Then per
haps you should plan to become a
trained group worker . . .
"The social group-worker's job
may consist of a hundred different
things in a week. She may organize
new groups and committees, train
volunteer leaders, write bulletins,
make a speech and produce a play!
"Monday she meets with a young
mothers' club which is studying nu
trition; Wednesday she helps with
decorations for the dance being
given by the high-school set; Sat
urday she goes hiking with the Girl
Reserves.
"Her activities vary in accordance
with her talents and her skill at
drawing into her program volunteer
workers who are willing to share
their hobbies with others. The
group workers helps these volun
teers, as well as any paid staff mem
bers assigned to her, to understand
the principles of democratic lead
ership . . .
"Experience Desirable: Success
ful experience in related fields of
teaching and social work gives an
applicant a decided advantage. At
the present time, however, there are
many openings for girls without
such work background. Experience
in group leadership either in col
lege, club or camp Is an essential.
Without it, undertaking group work
as a profession would be like trying
to teach French without having
learned even the grammar of the
language.
"Education: College degree or its
equivalent, if possible with a major

in social sciences. Preference is
given to applicants who have a
Master's degree and who have spe
cialized in group work.
"For a list of the schools offering
graduate courses in this subject
write The Committee on Profes
sional Education, American Associa
tion for the Study of Group Work,
670 Lexington Avenue, New York,
N.Y. Workers between 25 and 35
are in greatest demand, but there
are openings for applicants both
above and below this range."—Ex
cerpts from Mademoiselle (Career
Dept.), 1943.
Comment—by Mis Patricia Da
vidson, Executive Secretary, Stan
ford Y.W.C.A.:
"There is a dearth of group
workers. Social agencies such as
the Y.W.C.A., Girl Scouts, Set
tlement Centers, Neighborhood
Houses, and even commercial and
war industries, are competing for
the services of trained group
workers.
"The need is urgent. Essential
civilian services are of tremendous
importance if our military forces
on every front are to be sus
tained."
Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer
sities now conducting Area and
Language studies for Army trainees,
who will later go overseas to ad
minister local government in cap
tured territory, comes the report of
the lack of knowledge of city and

state government organization. Nor
are they well versed in national gov
ernment."—Advance text of address
by Dr. William Mather Lewis, presi
dent of Lafayette College.
Comment —by Edwin A. Cot
trell, Dean of the School of So
cial Sciences:
"Students preparing for careers
in the public service should choose
social science programs which
would assure them entrance into
various branches of government,
or semi-governmental civic or
ganizations, or the public aspects
of business and industrial opera
• tions.
"We must remember that the
national government is beginning
to discharge thousands of civilian
employees. Many of these will be
absorbed by local governments
whose staffs have been depleted
during the war years. Preparation
for positions in foreign relief and
rehabilitation is not to be encour
aged. There will be plenty of work
here, but only for trained and ex
perienced specialists and reason
ably few natives of each country
in the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration.
"Well-prepared students should
make inquiry concerning current
possibilities in the public service
some months ahead of their selec
tion of a department or school
major and certainly several quar
ters before their graduating date."

February has been set aside as Vocational Month. Last November ques
tionnaires were circulated and girls were asked to check their vocational
choices in order of preference. Most popular fields in this poll were women
in foreign service, aviation, social service, and journalism. The three latter
subjects will be presented in Wednesday meetings next month. The polls
also showed women to be interested in so wide a variety of occupations
that they could not be discussed in meetings. To give Stanford women some
information on these fields, Vocom members selected from magazines and
newspapers material pertinent to these topics. Certain faculty members
were then asked to give their opinions on these articles. The following
k are the excerpts taken from publications and the faculty members' com
* ments on them.

Future in Aviation Industry
"The war's end will bring a sud
den recession in aircraft production
thought by many to exceed 90 per
cent. Peace will also bring home
from the front many men trained in
various branches of aviation and
desirous of earning their living in
that Held. Many will have the pledge
of preferential right to their old
jobs.
"Is it realistic to believe that un
der these conditions women will be
kept on to a substantial degree and
men will be laid off in great num
bers? I think not. The process is
more likely to be the reverse. Some
think that our national economy will
continue at a high pace leaving fac
tory work for numberless women.
But at its prewar level of national
production some six million women
must wend their way homeward.
"And as I have brought out, no
matter what our post-war level of
overall production, aviation produc
tion is sure to drop enormously.
Most, of the women who work in the
production end of aviation will join
the group returning home. But not
all. In the competitive world some
will stay on a pure efficiency basis,
apart from any question of pay dif
ferential. Some small parts of the
production line will be considered
as women's particular forte.
"Thus, there will be a career for
women in aviation production and
allied branches much more than be
fore the war, even though the pro
portion of women to men will be
small. The previous war left some
lasting imprint of women on indus
try and business, and the present
war will deepen that imprint.
"In the ground branches of flying
operations, women will have a
somewhat better proportionate op
portunity than in production. There
will probably be but few if any
women left as engine and plane me
chanics. But in weather forecasting
and broadcasting rooms and traffic
control towers women are very effi
cient, and the work is suited to their
sex. There will be great expansion
in this branch of aviation that can
absorb much of the returning skilled
male personnel . . .
"I can see women in the cockpit
of many of the small commercial
planes. I can see them at the con
trols of some of the small feeder
lines. I can see them in the traffic
control towers, and they are ideal
in the training of air students.
"But it is my considered judgment
that, when all is said and done, only
about 25 per cent of the WASPS
will continue to earn their living in
aviation."—Text of address by Jac
queline Cochran, November 16, 1943,
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.
Comment—by Anastasia Doyle,
Vocational Adviser for Women,
Stanford University:
"Miss Cochran has played the
leading role in organizing women
for war service as pilots. Some
were already trained aviators
when the WAFS and the WASPS
were established less than two
years ago. She is responsible for
much of the rigorous course of
study and training which has made
pilots out of raw recruits in a
matter of months.
"Some Stanford girls have
joined the WAFS (Women's Army
Flying Service). Among them are
Isahcll Stciner, who was gradu
ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op
portunities after the war, but
really am not competent to speak."
"Group Work
"Are you interested in Sealyhams,
psychology, Saroyan and the samba?
Do you like to cook, garden, travel
and sketch? Have you been wor
ried because you felt your nonex
pert skill in a number of things made
you a Jill-of-all-trades? Then per
haps you should plan to become a
trained group worker . . .
"The social group-worker's job
may consist of a hundred different
things in a week. She may organize
new groups and committees, train
volunteer leaders, write bulletins,
make a speech and produce a play!
"Monday she meets with a young
mothers' club which is studying nu
trition; Wednesday she helps with
decorations for the dance being
given by the high-school set; Sat
urday she goes hiking with the Girl
Reserves.
"Her activities vary in accordance
with her talents and her skill at
drawing into her program volunteer
workers who are willing to share
their hobbies with others. The
group workers helps these volun
teers, as well as any paid staff mem
bers assigned to her, to understand
the principles of democratic lead
ership . . .
"Experience Desirable: Success
ful experience in related fields of
teaching and social work gives an
applicant a decided advantage. At
the present time, however, there are
many openings for girls without
such work background. Experience
in group leadership either in col
lege, club or camp Is an essential.
Without it, undertaking group work
as a profession would be like trying
to teach French without having
learned even the grammar of the
language.
"Education: College degree or its
equivalent, if possible with a major

in social sciences. Preference is
given to applicants who have a
Master's degree and who have spe
cialized in group work.
"For a list of the schools offering
graduate courses in this subject
write The Committee on Profes
sional Education, American Associa
tion for the Study of Group Work,
670 Lexington Avenue, New York,
N.Y. Workers between 25 and 35
are in greatest demand, but there
are openings for applicants both
above and below this range."—Ex

Comment—by Mis Patricia Da
vidson, Executive Secretary, Stan
ford Y.W.C.A.:
"There is a dearth of group
workers. Social agencies such as
the Y.W.C.A., Girl Scouts, Set
tlement Centers, Neighborhood
Houses, and even commercial and
war industries, are competing for
the services of trained group
workers.
"The need is urgent. Essential
civilian services are of tremendous
importance if our military forces
on every front are to be sus
tained."
Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer

Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer
sities now conducting Area and
Language studies for Army trainees,
who will later go overseas to ad
minister local government in cap
tured territory, comes the report of
the lack of knowledge of city and

state government organization. Nor
are they well versed in national gov

"Students preparing for careers
in the public service should choose

February has been set aside as Vocational Month. Last November ques
tionnaires were circulated and girls were asked to check their vocational
choices in order of preference. Most popular fields in this poll were women
in foreign service, aviation, social service, and journalism. The three latter
subjects will be presented in Wednesday meetings next month. The polls
also showed women to be interested in so wide a variety of occupations
that they could not be discussed in meetings. To give Stanford women some
information on these fields, Vocom members selected from magazines and
newspapers material pertinent to these topics. Certain faculty members
were then asked to give their opinions on these articles. The following
k are the excerpts taken from publications and the faculty members' com
* ments on them.

Future in Aviation Industry
"The war's end will bring a sud
den recession in aircraft production
thought by many to exceed 90 per
cent. Peace will also bring home
from the front many men trained in
various branches of aviation and
desirous of earning their living in
that Held. Many will have the pledge
of preferential right to their old
jobs.
"Is it realistic to believe that un
der these conditions women will be
kept on to a substantial degree and
men will be laid off in great num
bers? I think not. The process is
more likely to be the reverse. Some
think that our national economy will
continue at a high pace leaving fac
tory work for numberless women.
But at its prewar level of national
production some six million women
must wend their way homeward.
"And as I have brought out, no
matter what our post-war level of
overall production, aviation produc
tion is sure to drop enormously.
Most, of the women who work in the
production end of aviation will join
the group returning home. But not
all. In the competitive world some
will stay on a pure efficiency basis,
apart from any question of pay dif
ferential. Some small parts of the
production line will be considered
as women's particular forte.
"Thus, there will be a career for
women in aviation production and
allied branches much more than be
fore the war, even though the pro
portion of women to men will be
small. The previous war left some
lasting imprint of women on indus
try and business, and the present
war will deepen that imprint.
"In the ground branches of flying
operations, women will have a
somewhat better proportionate op
portunity than in production. There
will probably be but few if any
women left as engine and plane me
chanics. But in weather forecasting
and broadcasting rooms and traffic
control towers women are very effi
cient, and the work is suited to their
sex. There will be great expansion
in this branch of aviation that can
absorb much of the returning skilled
male personnel . . .
"I can see women in the cockpit
of many of the small commercial
planes. I can see them at the con
trols of some of the small feeder
lines. I can see them in the traffic
control towers, and they are ideal
in the training of air students.
"But it is my considered judgment
that, when all is said and done, only
about 25 per cent of the WASPS
will continue to earn their living in
aviation."—Text of address by Jac
queline Cochran, November 16, 1943,
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.
Comment—by Anastasia Doyle,
Vocational Adviser for Women,
Stanford University:
"Miss Cochran has played the
leading role in organizing women
for war service as pilots. Some
were already trained aviators
when the WAFS and the WASPS
were established less than two
years ago. She is responsible for
much of the rigorous course of
study and training which has made
pilots out of raw recruits in a
matter of months.
"Some Stanford girls have
joined the WAFS (Women's Army
Flying Service). Among them are
Isahcll Stciner, who was gradu
ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op
portunities after the war, but
really am not competent to speak."
"Group Work
"Are you interested in Sealyhams,
psychology, Saroyan and the samba?
Do you like to cook, garden, travel
and sketch? Have you been wor
ried because you felt your nonex
pert skill in a number of things made
you a Jill-of-all-trades? Then per
haps you should plan to become a
trained group worker . . .
"The social group-worker's job
may consist of a hundred different
things in a week. She may organize
new groups and committees, train
volunteer leaders, write bulletins,
make a speech and produce a play!
"Monday she meets with a young
mothers' club which is studying nu
trition; Wednesday she helps with
decorations for the dance being
given by the high-school set; Sat
urday she goes hiking with the Girl
Reserves.
"Her activities vary in accordance
with her talents and her skill at
drawing into her program volunteer
workers who are willing to share
their hobbies with others. The
group workers helps these volun
teers, as well as any paid staff mem
bers assigned to her, to understand
the principles of democratic lead
ership . . .
"Experience Desirable: Success
ful experience in related fields of
teaching and social work gives an
applicant a decided advantage. At
the present time, however, there are
many openings for girls without
such work background. Experience
in group leadership either in col
lege, club or camp Is an essential.
Without it, undertaking group work
as a profession would be like trying
to teach French without having
learned even the grammar of the
language.
"Education: College degree or its
equivalent, if possible with a major

in social sciences. Preference is
given to applicants who have a
Master's degree and who have spe
cialized in group work.
"For a list of the schools offering
graduate courses in this subject
write The Committee on Profes
sional Education, American Associa
tion for the Study of Group Work,
670 Lexington Avenue, New York,
N.Y. Workers between 25 and 35
are in greatest demand, but there
are openings for applicants both
above and below this range."—Ex

workers. Social agencies such as

"There is a dearth of group
workers. Social agencies such as
the Y.W.C.A., Girl Scouts, Set
tlement Centers, Neighborhood
Houses, and even commercial and
war industries, are competing for
the services of trained group
workers.
"The need is urgent. Essential
civilian services are of tremendous
importance if our military forces
on every front are to be sus
tained."
Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer
sities now conducting Area and
Language studies for Army trainees,
who will later go overseas to ad
minister local government in cap
tured territory, comes the report of
the lack of knowledge of city and

state government organization. Nor
are they well versed in national gov
ernment."—Advance text of address

"Students preparing for careers
in the public service should choose
social science programs which
would assure them entrance into

"We must remember that the
national government is beginning
to discharge thousands of civilian
employees. Many of these will be

February has been set aside as Vocational Month. Last November ques
tionnaires were circulated and girls were asked to check their vocational
choices in order of preference. Most popular fields in this poll were women
in foreign service, aviation, social service, and journalism. The three latter
subjects will be presented in Wednesday meetings next month. The polls
also showed women to be interested in so wide a variety of occupations
that they could not be discussed in meetings. To give Stanford women some
information on these fields, Vocom members selected from magazines and
newspapers material pertinent to these topics. Certain faculty members
were then asked to give their opinions on these articles. The following
k are the excerpts taken from publications and the faculty members' com
* ments on them.

Future in Aviation Industry
"The war's end will bring a sud
den recession in aircraft production
thought by many to exceed 90 per
cent. Peace will also bring home
from the front many men trained in
various branches of aviation and
desirous of earning their living in
that Held. Many will have the pledge
of preferential right to their old
jobs.
"Is it realistic to believe that un
der these conditions women will be
kept on to a substantial degree and
men will be laid off in great num
bers? I think not. The process is
more likely to be the reverse. Some
think that our national economy will
continue at a high pace leaving fac
tory work for numberless women.
But at its prewar level of national
production some six million women
must wend their way homeward.
"And as I have brought out, no
matter what our post-war level of
overall production, aviation produc
tion is sure to drop enormously.
Most, of the women who work in the
production end of aviation will join
the group returning home. But not
all. In the competitive world some
will stay on a pure efficiency basis,
apart from any question of pay dif
ferential. Some small parts of the
production line will be considered
as women's particular forte.
"Thus, there will be a career for
women in aviation production and
allied branches much more than be
fore the war, even though the pro
portion of women to men will be
small. The previous war left some
lasting imprint of women on indus
try and business, and the present
war will deepen that imprint.
"In the ground branches of flying
operations, women will have a
somewhat better proportionate op
portunity than in production. There
will probably be but few if any
women left as engine and plane me
chanics. But in weather forecasting
and broadcasting rooms and traffic
control towers women are very effi
cient, and the work is suited to their
sex. There will be great expansion
in this branch of aviation that can
absorb much of the returning skilled
male personnel . . .
"I can see women in the cockpit
of many of the small commercial
planes. I can see them at the con
trols of some of the small feeder
lines. I can see them in the traffic
control towers, and they are ideal
in the training of air students.
"But it is my considered judgment
that, when all is said and done, only
about 25 per cent of the WASPS
will continue to earn their living in
aviation."—Text of address by Jac
queline Cochran, November 16, 1943,
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.
Comment—by Anastasia Doyle,
Vocational Adviser for Women,
Stanford University:
"Miss Cochran has played the
leading role in organizing women
for war service as pilots. Some
were already trained aviators
when the WAFS and the WASPS
were established less than two
years ago. She is responsible for
much of the rigorous course of
study and training which has made
pilots out of raw recruits in a
matter of months.
"Some Stanford girls have
joined the WAFS (Women's Army
Flying Service). Among them are
Isahcll Stciner, who was gradu
ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op
portunities after the war, but
really am not competent to speak."
"Group Work
"Are you interested in Sealyhams,
psychology, Saroyan and the samba?
Do you like to cook, garden, travel
and sketch? Have you been wor
ried because you felt your nonex
pert skill in a number of things made
you a Jill-of-all-trades? Then per
haps you should plan to become a
trained group worker . . .
"The social group-worker's job
may consist of a hundred different
things in a week. She may organize
new groups and committees, train
volunteer leaders, write bulletins,
make a speech and produce a play!
"Monday she meets with a young
mothers' club which is studying nu
trition; Wednesday she helps with
decorations for the dance being
given by the high-school set; Sat
urday she goes hiking with the Girl
Reserves.
"Her activities vary in accordance
with her talents and her skill at
drawing into her program volunteer
workers who are willing to share
their hobbies with others. The
group workers helps these volun
teers, as well as any paid staff mem
bers assigned to her, to understand
the principles of democratic lead
ership . . .
"Experience Desirable: Success
ful experience in related fields of
teaching and social work gives an
applicant a decided advantage. At
the present time, however, there are
many openings for girls without
such work background. Experience
in group leadership either in col

"There is a dearth of group
workers. Social agencies such as
the Y.W.C.A., Girl Scouts, Set
tlement Centers, Neighborhood
Houses, and even commercial and
war industries, are competing for
the services of trained group
workers.
"The need is urgent. Essential
civilian services are of tremendous
importance if our military forces
on every front are to be sus
tained."
Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer
sities now conducting Area and
Language studies for Army trainees,
who will later go overseas to ad
minister local government in cap
tured territory, comes the report of
the lack of knowledge of city and

state government organization. Nor
are they well versed in national gov
ernment."—Advance text of address

"Students preparing for careers
in the public service should choose
social science programs which
would assure them entrance into

to discharge thousands of civilian
employees. Many of these will be

February has been set aside as Vocational Month. Last November ques
tionnaires were circulated and girls were asked to check their vocational
choices in order of preference. Most popular fields in this poll were women
in foreign service, aviation, social service, and journalism. The three latter
subjects will be presented in Wednesday meetings next month. The polls
also showed women to be interested in so wide a variety of occupations
that they could not be discussed in meetings. To give Stanford women some
information on these fields, Vocom members selected from magazines and
newspapers material pertinent to these topics. Certain faculty members
were then asked to give their opinions on these articles. The following
k are the excerpts taken from publications and the faculty members' com
* ments on them.

Future in Aviation Industry
"The war's end will bring a sud
den recession in aircraft production
thought by many to exceed 90 per
cent. Peace will also bring home
from the front many men trained in
various branches of aviation and
desirous of earning their living in
that Held. Many will have the pledge
of preferential right to their old
jobs.
"Is it realistic to believe that un
der these conditions women will be
kept on to a substantial degree and
men will be laid off in great num
bers? I think not. The process is
more likely to be the reverse. Some
think that our national economy will
continue at a high pace leaving fac
tory work for numberless women.
But at its prewar level of national
production some six million women
must wend their way homeward.
"And as I have brought out, no
matter what our post-war level of
overall production, aviation produc
tion is sure to drop enormously.
Most, of the women who work in the
production end of aviation will join
the group returning home. But not
all. In the competitive world some
will stay on a pure efficiency basis,
apart from any question of pay dif
ferential. Some small parts of the
production line will be considered
as women's particular forte.
"Thus, there will be a career for
women in aviation production and
allied branches much more than be
fore the war, even though the pro
portion of women to men will be
small. The previous war left some
lasting imprint of women on indus
try and business, and the present
war will deepen that imprint.
"In the ground branches of flying
operations, women will have a
somewhat better proportionate op
portunity than in production. There
will probably be but few if any
women left as engine and plane me
chanics. But in weather forecasting
and broadcasting rooms and traffic
control towers women are very effi
cient, and the work is suited to their
sex. There will be great expansion
in this branch of aviation that can
absorb much of the returning skilled
male personnel . . .
"I can see women in the cockpit
of many of the small commercial
planes. I can see them at the con
trols of some of the small feeder
lines. I can see them in the traffic
control towers, and they are ideal
in the training of air students.
"But it is my considered judgment
that, when all is said and done, only
about 25 per cent of the WASPS
will continue to earn their living in
aviation."—Text of address by Jac
queline Cochran, November 16, 1943,
Waldorf-Astoria Hotel, New York.
Comment—by Anastasia Doyle,
Vocational Adviser for Women,
Stanford University:
"Miss Cochran has played the
leading role in organizing women
for war service as pilots. Some
were already trained aviators
when the WAFS and the WASPS
were established less than two
years ago. She is responsible for
much of the rigorous course of
study and training which has made
pilots out of raw recruits in a
matter of months.
"Some Stanford girls have
joined the WAFS (Women's Army
Flying Service). Among them are
Isahcll Stciner, who was gradu
ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op

ated in August, 1943, Grctchcn

Gillespie and Donna Proctor, now
in training. Janet McClanalian
has recently left for Washington
to take a position with the State
Department in Aeronautical Re
search, before following her origi
nal plan to join the WAFS."
Crytography
"Since April 1941 Hunter College
has trained in its evening courses
1200 students, a large number of
them women, in crytography and
cryptanalytics. Many of them are
now in government service trans
lating messages into code and bieak
ing down code messages intercepted
from enemy sources. They are in
the Office of Censorship, are civilian
employees of the Signal Corps Serv
ice and in other divisions. The De
partment of State is planning to
train 150 young women in the work
of handling secret codes.
"Advanced courses cover meth
ods of decoding in French, German,
Italian, and Spanish." — "Women's
Work and Education," October 1943.
Comment—by Dr. Eleanor Den
nison, League of Women Voters,
Washington, D.C.:
"There seems to be a great de
mand for decoders at the moment.
It will probably continue longer
in the Army and Navy than else
where. If a gal is good enough to
get into the breaking down of
enemy codes it is fascinating.
Straight decoding is pretty dull.
In the Navy, salaries begin around
$1800 to $2000. I doubt the op
portunities after the war, but
really am not competent to speak."
"Group Work
"Are you interested in Sealyhams,
psychology, Saroyan and the samba?
Do you like to cook, garden, travel
and sketch? Have you been wor
ried because you felt your nonex
pert skill in a number of things made
you a Jill-of-all-trades? Then per
haps you should plan to become a
trained group worker . . .
"The social group-worker's job
may consist of a hundred different
things in a week. She may organize
new groups and committees, train
volunteer leaders, write bulletins,
make a speech and produce a play!
"Monday she meets with a young
mothers' club which is studying nu
trition; Wednesday she helps with
decorations for the dance being
given by the high-school set; Sat
urday she goes hiking with the Girl
Reserves.
"Her activities vary in accordance
with her talents and her skill at
drawing into her program volunteer
workers who are willing to share
their hobbies with others. The
group workers helps these volun
teers, as well as any paid staff mem
bers assigned to her, to understand
the principles of democratic lead
ership . . .
"Experience Desirable: Success
ful experience in related fields of
teaching and social work gives an
applicant a decided advantage. At
the present time, however, there are
many openings for girls without
such work background. Experience
in group leadership either in col
lege, club or camp Is an essential.
Without it, undertaking group work
as a profession would be like trying
to teach French without having
learned even the grammar of the
language.
"Education: College degree or its
equivalent, if possible with a major

in social sciences. Preference is
given to applicants who have a
Master's degree and who have spe
cialized in group work.
"For a list of the schools offering
graduate courses in this subject
write The Committee on Profes
sional Education, American Associa
tion for the Study of Group Work,
670 Lexington Avenue, New York,
N.Y. Workers between 25 and 35
are in greatest demand, but there
are openings for applicants both
above and below this range."—Ex
cerpts from Mademoiselle (Career
Dept.), 1943.
Comment—by Mis Patricia Da
vidson, Executive Secretary, Stan
ford Y.W.C.A.:
"There is a dearth of group
workers. Social agencies such as
the Y.W.C.A., Girl Scouts, Set
tlement Centers, Neighborhood
Houses, and even commercial and
war industries, are competing for
the services of trained group
workers.
"The need is urgent. Essential
civilian services are of tremendous
importance if our military forces
on every front are to be sus
tained."
Comment—by Mrs. Knapp, head
of Women's Physical Education
Department:
"Many organizations like the
Girl Scouts and Red Cross are
searching for young people trained
as group workers. Graduates of
our physical education program
have been taken in large numbers
to fill this need which is so great.
"As a socially minded citizen,

I am glad to see the fine work they
are doing. However, the work in
Physical Education suffers as the
needs in this field are important
and numerous too. We need more
trainees."
Education for Government Work
"The experience in the intensified
war training programs of the col
leges is teaching us that we will do
well in the future to contract rather
than to expand our curriculum of
ferings, paying more attention to the
basic principles and less to 'the tricks
of the trade' in this field or that.
"This principle applies to those
who are to enter government serv
ice. Again, to quote Meriam, 'Any
one who studies in detail the posi
tions- in public service which rea
sonably can be said to demand or
require university education, will
find that the bulk of them are pro
fessional, technical, or scientific and
that they have their counterparts in
private enterprise of one kind or
another.'
"Thus, he who looks forward to
public service would have a typi
cal pre-professional liberal arts
course with emphasis on English
composition, economics, stressing sta
tistics and accounting, and political
science. In the latter field, sharp
attention must be given to the study
of municipal and state governments.
"From those colleges and univer
sities now conducting Area and
Language studies for Army trainees,
who will later go overseas to ad
minister local government in cap
tured territory, comes the report of
the lack of knowledge of city and

state government organization. Nor
are they well versed in national gov
ernment."—Advance text of address
by Dr. William Mather Lewis, presi
dent of Lafayette College.
Comment —by Edwin A. Cot
trell, Dean of the School of So
cial Sciences:
"Students preparing for careers
in the public service should choose
social science programs which
would assure them entrance into
various branches of government,
or semi-governmental civic or
ganizations, or the public aspects
of business and industrial opera
• tions.
"We must remember that the
national government is beginning
to discharge thousands of civilian
employees. Many of these will be
absorbed by local governments
whose staffs have been depleted
during the war years. Preparation
for positions in foreign relief and
rehabilitation is not to be encour
aged. There will be plenty of work
here, but only for trained and ex
perienced specialists and reason
ably few natives of each country
in the United Nations Relief and
Rehabilitation Administration.
"Well-prepared students should
make inquiry concerning current
possibilities in the public service
some months ahead of their selec
tion of a department or school
major and certainly several quar
ters before their graduating date."
