Comfort for the lonely heart was

members of both army and civilian
social committees as they planned |
activities for the new quarter. Don ]
Blub, of Co. K, acting army chair- j
man. and Jeannette Grimsley, wom
en's eo-ordinator, promised a full i
program of social activity to insure
success of a "boy-meets-girl" plan |
covering the entire campus.
Listed on the prospective program !
are bicycle picnics sponsored by var
ious women's groups, bridge and ten
nis tournaments, a golf tournament
in which a soldier and co-ed will
play as a team, and dancing classes
to be conducted for soldiers whose
skill on the ballroom floor has di
minished as a result of double-time j
with G.I. shoes and full pack.
Open Houses
A full schedule of open houses to
be given by Stanford sorority houses ;
and dormitories will be released j
within the next few days, according
to Miss Grimsley. Tentative plans

uled on an alphabetical basis so that
every company will be given an op
portunity to visit every house. Invi
tations will be made to particular
companies.
