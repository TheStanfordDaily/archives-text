### 
Moving away from their opposition in (he second half, Co. E's intramural
basketball squad trounced a Co. F quintet easily and handily, 57-25,
Wednesday evening in the Pavilion.
With the score reading 20-12 at half time, it appeared as if the Co. F
"underdogs" might be able to hang on to their adversaries until the final

gun. Messrs. Fryer, Jarrett, Ander- -
son and company (Co. E) had dif
ferent ideas, and with the coming
of the second half so came their
second wind, and the ball game.
Co. E, on its showing Wednes
day, is a factor to be reckoned with
in the Colonel Eden "A" Team
League. The Engineers outdrove,
outpassed, outhandled, outshot, and,
in general, outplayed the Italian
and Russian studenls of Co. F.
In addition to their fine attack, Co.
E's tight zone defense forced the lan
guage students to seek the rim from
way out. Never once did this de
fense weaken. It was just a case of
"no contest!"
Starring for the victors were:
Fryer, the six foot four inch center
and high scorer of the game, around
whom the attack was built, and who
picked up eighteen counters for
himself; Anderson with fourteen

and Jarrett, a terrific set-shot art
ist, with fourteen tallies. For the
vanquished, only Salianka could be
commended for his performance and
for the nine points he accumulated.
In the other game at the Pavilion,
Co. E's "B" team squeezed out a
tight victory over Co. F's five, to
the tune of 25-24. Jewett of Co. F
was high scorer of the contest with
twelve markers.
In the gymnasium. Co. G took two
Co. H quintets to town. Led by
Nagy with fourteen counters, the
"A" team was 41-19, af
ter a ragged first half which found
both squads pounding away at 16-13.
The "B" game was exactly opposite
in technique if not in results. In
this affair, the scoring was confined
to the first half. Co. G triumphed
49-36 after finding themselves with
a 37-29 margin following the first
twenty minutes of play.
