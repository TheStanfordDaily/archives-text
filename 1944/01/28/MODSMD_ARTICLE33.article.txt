## 
### 
Establishment of a Stanford ASTP Honor System for army students
attending non-proctored classes, together with a plan for punishing vio
lators of the code, has been approved by Col. John 11. Eden. ASTU Com
mandant here, the Army Student Council announced today. Final approval
came after details of the new system had been worked out by the council

â™¦ together with Col. Eden.
Under the plan approved by the
colonel, University instructors will
no longer proctor examinations if
the students of a particular class
elect to work under the honor code.
This system will be an under
taking of the soldier students, indi
vidually and collectively, that they
will not give or receive aid in ex
aminations; that they will not give
or receive unpermitted aid in class
work, in the preparation of reports,
or in any other work that is to bo
used by the instructor as the basis
j of grading.
r lhe University will show its con
fidence in the honor of its students
| by refraining from proctoring ex
j animations, or otherwise taking spe
cial steps to prevent dishonesty in
scholastic work.
Thorough Investigation
All violations of the Honor Sys
! tein will be turned over to the
Grievance Committee of the Army
Student Council. Following a
thorough investigation of the re
ported abuse, a hearing will be
docketed by the Honor Court. The
soldier student involved will re
ceive a written notice at least
three days prior to the hearing.
The Honor Court will consist of
| not more than live nor less than
three judges. The judges will be
; nominated by the Army Student
; Council and will be drawn from the
| panel of present active Cadet Com
[ pany Commanders.
No Cadet Captain shall be com
petent to sit on any case in which
| he is directly involved, nor involv
; ing a soldier under his Cadet Com
[ mand. Furthermore, any judge may
; be disqualified because of bias or
prejudice. At the request of the
defendant trainee, defense counsel
J will be appointed.
List Penalties
If the defendant is found guilty,
the Honor Court shall have author
ity to recommend to the Post Com
mandant the following punishment:
Admonition, reprimand, proba
tion, failing grade in test involved
in cheating, separation from pro
gram, or a combination of any of
these penalties. The final decision
of the Commandant will be pub
lished by Military Headquarters, but
