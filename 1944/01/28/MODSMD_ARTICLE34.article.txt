# Co. I Quintet Picked to Win
## 
### PFC. ARTHUR E. SHAPIRO 
"Loaded to the gills" might very
well be a snappy catch-phrase used
to describe Company I's basketball
team, which is almost a sure thing in
the G.I. intramural tourney.
Sparked by Frank Lowe, Ets
Kleinjans, and captained by John
Smeltz, the Dutch students have
been showing their heels to all oppo
sition in the past four months. Com
bining accurate ball-handling, speed
around, and under the backboards,
and a deadly brand of shooting, the
soldiers of Company I have been
nothing less than phenomenal during
the past quarter and early weeks of
this semester.
Previous Experience
The most surprising thing about
this five is that every member of the
starting quintet has seen duty on
other college hardwood floors prior
to entrance in the Army. Representa
tives of Swarthmore, Colgate, Hope
College. Kansas State, Wooster, and
Hawaii, among others, dot the roster.
The team is tall, tall enough to
cope with anything any other outfit
is likely to throw against them. The
tallest of the starting five is the high
scoring guard, Ets Kleinjans, who
reaches six feet two inches in his
stocking feet. The smallest of the
quintet is Gaar Johnson, forward,
whose height of five feet eleven
inches is decidedly on the respect
able side. Herb Kuhn, the fifth mem
ber of the squad, holds down a guard
position and is one of the better de
fensive ball players about Stanford.
The number one substitute, Tai fli
Lim, hails from the oakwood floors
of Hawaii University, and will prob
ably see yeoman duty in all contests.
Eastern-Western Style
Blending speed, height, fancy ball
handling and excellent shooting abil
ity, Company I's team is a fine ex
ample of the eastern style precision
and the western style shooting game.
We're off on the limb again, but it
loks like Company I, and in a walk!
Sorry, but betting is not permitted on
the campus!
