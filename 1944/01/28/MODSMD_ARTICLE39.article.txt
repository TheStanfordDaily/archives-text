## MURAL BASKETBALL Roble Five Win Again; Beat Washington, 57-8 
### JOE ZUKIN 
The Roble Hashers hit the jackpot
for the second time in a row last
night as they overpowered a weak
Washington Hall five by a score of
57-8. Leon Watson was again high
point man, as he was in the previous
game against Monroe, when he
pushed the ball through the hoop 11
times for a total of 22 points. Pint
sized Jim Travis came up for second
honors with 1(5 digies to his credit.
The Hashers used the same type of
floor play they displayed against
Monroe two nights before in this
one-sided affair. If they are able to
keep up this kind of play throughout
the season it is very improbable that
anyone will stop them from taking
the title.
In another casaba tilt last night the
Buchanan Bearcats beat out the low
ly McKinley B squad by a slight
margin of 28-24. At the quarter
mark the McKinley five were leading
by a two-point edge, but as Bu
chanan got the feel of the hardwood,
they woke up and began sinking
some two-pointers. The score was
tied at 10 all at half time, arfd from
there on it was all the Bearcats' game
till the final gun.
The Daily wishes to apologize for
not writing up the games that are
being played at 8:15 p.m. in the
Pavilion and the Gym, but due to the
fact that all copy must be in by 9
p.m. every night it makes it difficult
to even cover the early games ac
curately.
If the teams that do play the later
games will please phone the Daily
office as soon as possible and report
their scores, the sports staff will en
deavor to at least put the scores in
at the end of the regular article. So

| if you see some results hidden away
I at the tend of some big writeup please
bear with us until your team plays
1 an early game, and then, who knows,
i your name might be in headlines too.
