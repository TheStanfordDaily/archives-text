If you're looking for the team to
beat in the mural basketball league,
consider the Roble Hashers. In their
only start of the season this outfit
swamped a pretty strong Monroe
quintet, 56-8, and could have run the
score into astronomical figures if
they had wanted to.
The team brings together some of
the best ball handlers in the school,
with Bob Halstead, member of last
year's Indian varsity, and Leon
Watson, frosh sensation, heading
what is really an all-star cast. This
outfit deserves the position as heavy
favorites of walking away with the
civilian crown, and possibly knock
ing over the army champs in the
play-offs.
Closest opposition should come
from McKinley, the most powerful
of the hall teams. Led by Bob Dona
hue and Tom Martzloff, McKinley
ran up the highest score of the sea
son in trampling Adams, 78-10. The
meeting of McKinley and the Roble
Hashers, Feb. 9, should be the top
game of the year.
Fillmore, one of the better hall
teams, has a so-so squad that is up
among the contenders due to the
amazing scoring combination of
Louie Fentnor and Chuck Stewart.
Just fair individually, these boys
are dynamite working together, and
are potentially the hottest shot-mak
ing combo in the league.
Always a contender for top honors,
the Firehouse has another strong
team this year. Spearheaded by
firey Gene Smith, the Firemen are
the most aggressive players in the
league, and would surprise nobody
by coming from nowhere to grab the
title.
