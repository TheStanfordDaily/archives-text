# Carillon Will Entertain Royalty, Blue Jackets
## 
### FRANK CREEDE 
In many countries of Europe, especially Belgium and Holland, the carillon
is a highly respected and appreciated instrument. We Americans consider
•he carillon to be something of a novelty, and not an instrument of skill
and great musical merit.
We have accepted the organ in our music churches, theaters, and radio

yet the carillon is considered an in
strument which is only appropriate
for fairs and other extraordinary oc
casions. However, next Monday the
Stanford bells will toll for a more
appreciative audience.
For on Jan. 31, the carillon will
ring to honor the visit of Princess
Juliana of the Netherlands and her
party. The tour of the campus is
being arranged by Professor Sokol,
assistant director of the Eastern
Language and Area Program, to
gether with Mrs. Heymans, who
teaches Dutch in the Language and
Area School.
Carillon Will Pay Tribute
The Princess probably has not had
many opportunities to hear carillon
music since leaving her homeland.
Because of the place which carillon
music holds in the low countries and
the fact that the Stanford bells were
cast in Belgium, it is only fitting that
che bells should pay tribute to a rep
resentative of one of those con
quered countries.
Jim Lawson, the Stanford carillon
neur, has prepared a program which
will consist entirely of Dutch music,
patriotic numbers, including the
Netherlands national anthem, Dutch
folk songs, and music for the carillon
written by Dutch carillonneurs.
Developed in Low Countries
The carillon besides being accepted
as an instrument of.intrinsic music
value by the people of the low coun
tries, received most of its technologi
cal developments in these countries.
Here it was expanded from an in
strument of simplicity to one which
can only be played by a trained ex
pert.
Sunday, Jan. 30, at the request of
Dr. Trueblood, Mr. Lawson will play
a special recital from 10:15 to 10:45
for several hundred Naval Air stu
dents from Moffett Field who will
tour the campus and attend 11
o'clock church service.
Program
This concert will be an ail-Ameri
can program consisting of music for
the carillon by American carillon
neurs and a group of American folk
songs and hymns.
The program for Sunday will in
clude:
1. Air for Carillon—Percival Price.
2. Stephen Foster Melodies.
3. Negro Spirituals.
4. The Lord's Prayer—Albert Ma
lotte.
5. America the Beautiful.
In the programs for these two days ;
the carillon will prove itself a demo- !
eratic instrument, since it will be
used to honor royalty on Monday,
and to entertain blue jackets on Sun
day.

tries, received most of its technologi
cal developments in these countries.
Here it was expanded from an in
strument of simplicity to one which
can only be played by a trained ex
pert.
Sunday, Jan. 30, at the request of
Dr. Trueblood, Mr. Lawson will play
a special recital from 10:15 to 10:45
for several hundred Naval Air stu
dents from Moffett Field who will
tour the campus and attend 11
o'clock church service.
Program
This concert will be an ail-Ameri
can program consisting of music for
the carillon by American carillon
neurs and a group of American folk
songs and hymns.
The program for Sunday will in
clude:
1. Air for Carillon—Percival Price.
2. Stephen Foster Melodies.
3. Negro Spirituals.
4. The Lord's Prayer—Albert Ma
lotte.
5. America the Beautiful.
In the programs for these two days ;
the carillon will prove itself a demo- !
eratic instrument, since it will be
used to honor royalty on Monday,
and to entertain blue jackets on Sun
day.
In many countries of Europe, especially Belgium and Holland, the carillon
is a highly respected and appreciated instrument. We Americans consider
•he carillon to be something of a novelty, and not an instrument of skill
and great musical merit.
We have accepted the organ in our music churches, theaters, and radio

yet the carillon is considered an in
strument which is only appropriate
for fairs and other extraordinary oc
casions. However, next Monday the
Stanford bells will toll for a more
appreciative audience.
For on Jan. 31, the carillon will
ring to honor the visit of Princess
Juliana of the Netherlands and her
party. The tour of the campus is
being arranged by Professor Sokol,
assistant director of the Eastern
Language and Area Program, to
gether with Mrs. Heymans, who
teaches Dutch in the Language and
Area School.
Carillon Will Pay Tribute
The Princess probably has not had
many opportunities to hear carillon
music since leaving her homeland.
Because of the place which carillon
music holds in the low countries and
the fact that the Stanford bells were
cast in Belgium, it is only fitting that
che bells should pay tribute to a rep
resentative of one of those con
quered countries.
Jim Lawson, the Stanford carillon
neur, has prepared a program which
will consist entirely of Dutch music,
patriotic numbers, including the
Netherlands national anthem, Dutch
folk songs, and music for the carillon
written by Dutch carillonneurs.
Developed in Low Countries
The carillon besides being accepted
as an instrument of.intrinsic music
value by the people of the low coun
tries, received most of its technologi
cal developments in these countries.
Here it was expanded from an in
strument of simplicity to one which
can only be played by a trained ex
