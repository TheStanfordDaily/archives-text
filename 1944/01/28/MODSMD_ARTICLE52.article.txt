## 
### 
A book written by a Stanford
graduate, concerning a former Stan
ford professor, and with a setting in
the locale of this Universityâ€”what
more interesting work could attract
the attention of Stanford students
and faculty? This book is to appear
very shortly at the bookstore, Mrs.
Sterling, head of the book depart
ment, announced.
Robert L. Duffus is the author of
the work which is entitled "The In
nocents at Cedro." During his un
dergraduate work at Stanford, Duf
fus met Dr. Thorstein Veblen, pro
fessor of economics here between
1906 and 1918, who inspired the book.
''I undertook these memoirs be
cause I though there might be in
terest in the personality of Thorstein
Veblen as it revealed itself to a 19-
year-old who lived in his household
for the fruitful years of 1907-1908, at
Cedro Cottage, near Stanford Uni
versity . . . Veblen is thus book's rea
son for being," Duffus stated in an
article.
Thorstein Veblen is himself one of
the world's most colorful figures. He
was born in Norway and later came
to this country, settling in the Mid-
West. As well as teaching at Stan
ford, he was one of the first profes
sors at the newly founded University
of Chicago. A noted writer, his most
famous work is "The Theory of the
Leisure Class."
"A great economist, a devastating
iconoclast, and a satirist," Dufus fur
ther describes him. Veblen's name is
also associated with the noted "Tech
nocracy" movement.
