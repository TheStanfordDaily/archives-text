## 
### 
Paying tribute to the work of the late Dr. Percy Alvin Martin, for over
.JO years a member of the Stanford faculty, was an article that recently
appeared in the Brazilian newspaper, Diario de sao Paulo, written by Dr.

ians. Dr. Oliveira Lima, donor of
the famous Lima Library in Wash
ington, D.C., was also a close friend

Prepares Who's Who
Dr. Martin was a great student of !
Latin American affairs, and one of
his outstanding achievements was
the preparation of the first two edi- ,
tions of "Who's Who in Latin Amer- |
ica," published in 1935 and 1940 by j
the Stanford University Press.
Dr. Martin felt that the people of |
the United States did not appreciate
the great number of outstanding
Latin American personages; and (
these volumes, which were printed j
in English, created both for himself j
and Stanford an exceedingly im- '
portant part in building friendlier re- '
lations between the United States
and the South American countries. !
Dr. Ililton Collaborates
Dr. Ronald Ililton, of the Romanic j

ond president of Stanford University,
who pioneered in the encouragement
of an American interest in Brazil and
South America. Dr. Martin was also
the author of the book "Latin Amer
ica and the War," which considered
the roles of the South American
countries in World War I.
Paying tribute to the work of the late Dr. Percy Alvin Martin, for over
.JO years a member of the Stanford faculty, was an article that recently
appeared in the Brazilian newspaper, Diario de sao Paulo, written by Dr.
Sebastiano Pagano, professor of history at the University of Campinas.

Neighbor policy, and cites the former 1
Stanford professor's correspondence i
with Prince Pedro Enrique, Conte
d'Eu, and other prominent Brazil
ians. Dr. Oliveira Lima, donor of
the famous Lima Library in Wash
ington, D.C., was also a close friend
of Dr. Martin's.
Prepares Who's Who
Dr. Martin was a great student of !
Latin American affairs, and one of
his outstanding achievements was
the preparation of the first two edi- ,
tions of "Who's Who in Latin Amer- |
ica," published in 1935 and 1940 by j
the Stanford University Press.
Dr. Martin felt that the people of |
the United States did not appreciate
the great number of outstanding
Latin American personages; and (
these volumes, which were printed j
in English, created both for himself j
and Stanford an exceedingly im- '
portant part in building friendlier re- '
lations between the United States
and the South American countries. !
Dr. Ililton Collaborates
Dr. Ronald Ililton, of the Romanic j
Languages Department, is the editor ;

of the third edition, which will be
enlarged and is expected to appear
sometime in the latter part of this
year. Dr. Hilton is now in South
America collecting data.
Dr. Martin was a Stanford gradu
ate, and received his Ph.D. degree at
Harvard. He first joined the Stan
ford faculty in 1908, and remained a
member until his death in March
1942. Widely traveled in Latin
America, he was an honorary mem
ber of a number of the most famous
historical societies in South America,
and has been awarded the decoration
of the Order of the Southern Cross
by the Brazilian government.
