### JIM WEINBERG 
The Stanford Symphony Orchestra,
; in its first performance of the 1944
I Winter Quarter, gave an impressive
j concert last Wednesday night before
| an appreciative audience in Memo
| rial Hall. The orchestra was under
j the direction of Ferenc Molnar.
The program opened with the
beautiful Mozart Symphony No. 40
in G minor, probably the most popu
| lar of all of Mozart's symphonies,
j Next followed Handel's Concerto for
| oboe and strings, with the solo work
I done by Beth Childs, who is well
; known in the Bay Area for her play
j ing of the oboe.
The last number on the program
j was the performance of Prokofiev's
"Peter and the Wolf." in which Virgil
Anderson did a splendid job as nar
rator.
