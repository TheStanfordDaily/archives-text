# What Color Banner?

APATHETIC. That's the word used by a Cal student in de
scribing the spirit of Stanford students in regard to the War
Bond and Stamp sale contest beginning today between Stanford
and her old rival Cal.
"Okay," we said.
We didn't believe him for two reasons, though. First of all,
anyone possessing a brain knows that no Stanford student is
apathetic about anything that concerns any kind of a contest
between Cal and Stanford. And second, we refused to believe
that anyone could think that Stanford wouldn't produce if called
upon to buy bonds.
No Stanford student would bother to tell a Cal student that
Stanford was not apathetic about the contest. Merely saying
'We've got lots of fight" doesn't make an impression on any
body and especially dqes it fall flat on the ears of a Blue and Gold
backer.
And so there's only one way to make him eat his words. The
Red and White banner has got to appear at the big Cal dance this
Saturday, "with much love to Cal."
And what's even more important, it's got to appear as a symbol
of our feelings for a couple of big men in Japan and Germanyâ€”
and for all their friends who let them be big men.
