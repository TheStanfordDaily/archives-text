### JEAN LEVINSON 
You there, contentedly sipping your coffee in that dim, warm
booth in the Cellar. You there, gabbing with your buddies on the
English corner. You there, reading your Daily in the Reserve
Book room. You ought to be ashamed of yourself if you're not
standing in front of a bond booth buying a stamp or a War Bond.
Move that body, and guide your feet to a booth this instant and
buy that piece of paper that may mean victory or defeat for the
Allied Nations.
Remember too, contented citizen and happy student, that
this week starting at 8 this morning we're competing against a
certain so-called university across yon bay, and we've got to beat
them. We've got to, see. Take every penny and greenback you
have in your possession and turn it into a staitfp or bond, so we
can show that half-baked Bear who has the best spirit and best
student body!
Sure you're sick and tired of hearing about the Fourth War
Loan Drive .... you're probably fed up with speeches and post
ers and publicity about this drive, but you're going to hear a
lot more if you don't start doing something about it, and right
now.
Listen, glamour-pan, you needn't turn up your nose. Suppose
you do have to give up a new cashmere sweater for the coming
season .... just too bad, isn't it? Well, you might feel a little
drab in that moth-eaten job you're sporting, but you'll feel a lot
better inside if you know you've bought a little chunk of hope
for victory and freedom.
Listen, you needn't look so bored and disinterested, Mr. Lady
Killer. Suppose you do have to give upJ a few beers, or not be
able to treat her to the loges next week. Tough, bub, tough. Be
lieve me you'll be much better off in the future if you invest some
of that fun money in a War Bond.
Listen everybody. No, stifle that yawn and listen. If we're
beaten by that seminary in this contest we'll never hear the end
of it. And if we're beaten in this war it'll be the end of every
thing. We want our children to have a chance to be in competi
tion with colleges someday, in other ways .... football and bas
ketball, and the things we all love.
This may sound like a lot of the good old flag waving and
just a lot of drivle, but if we don't show our spirit and patriotism
now, we'll have our spirit broken and our patriotism a memory in
iÂ».he future.
Now go to that booth and buy those Bonds! Please?
