# Critic Praises Grant Picture

DI'.S 1 IN A I lON TOKYO—Now play
ing at the Stanford Theater.
Tense and throbbing with excite
ment, "Destination Tokyo" is a pic
ture that this reviewer can recom
mend even to members of the His
tory of Western Civilization staff.
The film tells the real story of the
submarine Copperfin and its life and
death struggle in Jap waters.
On the day before Christmas, 1942,
the Copperfin, captained by Cary
Grant, heads northwest from San
Francisco. In Aleutian waters they
take aboard a weather expert and
have a savage battle with a Jap
plane.
The real thrill, however, comes
while the submarine is off the Jap
anese coast. The daring landing
party episode, the nerve-wracking
ordeal as a pharmacist's mate per
forms an appendectomy, and the
endless hours of pursuit by Jap
ships—all of these are filmed with
Warners' master touch. The film has
a happy ending when all hands steam
back under the Golden Gate.
Cary Grant is fine as the efficient
captain, John Garfield is his usual
splendid self as the typical sailor,
"Wolf,' and John Ridgely gives un
derstanding to his role as the weath
er expert. Alan Hale as ship's cook
is on hand to pep things up. "Des
tination Tokyo." both from the acting
and technical standpoints, is a fine
picture. —Bower
