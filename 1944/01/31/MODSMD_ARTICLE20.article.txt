# No Stanford Holiday Washington's Birthday
## 
### 
In response to our inquiry, the
Commandant has advised that Feb.
22, Washington's Birthday, will not
be observed as a holiday in the
AST Program. As it has been
found impractical to hold classes
for Army trainees while dismissing
civilian classes, Feb. 22 will not be
observed as a University holiday
this year.
