Hayes, while the Roble Hashers do the same to Arthur Hall. Hayes has
yet to win a tussle, while McKinley is rated as a top favorite along with the

Hashers to take the league crown.
The game should be a complete walk '
away with the McKinley five taking
it by at least 30 points. Big Tom
Martzloff and dead-eye Bob Donahoe
are bound to get a big share of the
score, being the two top scorers on
the squad so far.
The Arthur Hall five should fall
before Roble by about the same mar
in of 30 points, with Jim Travis,
Leon Watson, and Bob Halstead
