# Cal Runs Over Bruins 36-27
## 
### 
Last Saturday night was one of
morose feeling down in Westwood
when the highly touted UCLA
Bruins fell before a strong California
five by a score of 36 to 27.
Wayne Hooper, fast little guard for
the Bears led his team to victory
with 13 points to his credit; he was
closely followed by teammate John
Fiiggins who rang up 10 digits.
Guard Bill Rankin took scoring
honors for the Bruins as he made a
total of 10 points, while Dick West,
usually high-point man was held to
only one bucket. The win elevates
Cal to favorites of the PCC southern
loop.
