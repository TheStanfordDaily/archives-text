# Frogs Wish for Drought's End

### DAN WHITE 
If any Robleite or Lagunita dweller
! should discover an unpleasant aroma
arising from the rear of her quarters,
she will know that it comes from
dead frogs. The reason the frogs are
dying is that there is no water in
1 Lake Lagunita.
Yes, even the pond scum looks
peaked these days. Why? Again,
there is no water in the lake. It has
| been discovered that there are a few
1 damp spots in the very bottom of the
place where the lake is said tu be, but
there is no more moisture than that
required to turn one's best No. 1 air
plane stamps, shoes to you, into cakes
| of mud.
The burrs are doing well enough.
They are very effective in their man

i ner of clinging to trousers, stockings,
1 socks, and other apparel. The wear
: in.l 4 of nylon hose while strolling
, through the lake bed is not recom
j mended.
Water is entering the lake through
the Lagunita flume in a very slow
1 trickle. This merely serves to make
the bed seem very soggy and it is
j having a beneficial effect on the pond
scum. Perhaps the sad state of the
j frogs and the pond scum will soon be
alleviated.
There is one thing that can help
matters. A good rain will end this
sad state of affairs. If each living
group will hold rain dances every
night next week, perhaps the lake
will fill. Then all of Stanford will be
kept awake by the croaking of the
frogs.
