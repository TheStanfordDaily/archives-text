# U.S. Marine Veteran at Guadalcanal Conveys Personal Meaning of War
## 
### 
EDITOR'S NOTE:—This article
was written by Dick Crane, a
wounded veteran of this war. He
was with the U.S. Marines in the
initial landing on Guadalcanal,
Aug- 7, 1942. While in combat ac
tion for the first five weeks, he was
wounded by shrapnel in a bombing
raid on Sept. 10, 1943. lie spent
eight months in various hospitals
in the Southwest Pacific, New Zea
land, and here in the States. On
being discharged from the Marine
Corps in June 1943, he entered
Stanford University last fall under
the Veteran's Rehabilitation Pro
gram. and is resuming his studies
(hat were interrupted by the war.
As I know some of you personally,
and as I feel that I am one of you
now, I want to convey a message
through the Stanford Daily, just as
if I were talking to each student per
sonally. I want to tell each one of
you what the word "war" means to
me.
"War" means to me travel on the
high seas in a crowded transport,
where every comfort is sacrificed for
space, and the scare of being sunk by
a torpedo, which keeps a hollow feel
ing' of fear in your stomach all the
time.
Long Hours Unloading
"War" means to me the unloading
of vital supplies from ships in the
pouring rain, for 10 days, 18 hours a
day.
"War" means to me going into
combat, not knowing where or when,
until the day before going in, and

then finding the place is somewhere
you or I have never heard about, and
yuu get the morbid feeling of dying
in a strange land.
"War" means to me climbing into
"landing barges," under the din of
shellfire, and the noise of bombs
bursting. You start toward a sandy
beach where you know that men are
waiting to kill you. A helpless feel
ing of fear passes over you, and you
are certain that you are going to die
in the next few minutes.
"War" means to me the living in a
"hell on earth" for five weeks. A
place where the slightest scratch
means infection, because you are
filthy, due to the lack of water to
wash with. A place where malaria
and. elephantiasis, strike, without
warning, and you don't have a
chance to stop it, because there isn't
time to erect hospitals. A place
where you only cat twice a day, be
cause you don't have enough food to
go around; a place that makes the
slice of white bread you are eating
taste like cake, because you only get
one slice a week. A place where you
live in a hole in the ground called a
"foxhole," which could also be very
conveniently used for a coffin, should
you stop a bullet or a piece of shrap
nel.
"War" means to me seeing your
best friends get killed right next to
you, but you have to forget about it
right away, or else you would go
mad. It means that you live in con
stant fear of bombing raids all the
time, and. when the bombers come
over twice a day, you lie there and
pray to God to get you out of the
hellish mess that you are in. You are
sure that every bomb is meant espe
cially for you.
It means that you see young men
age overnight, and on a Saturday
night, when they should be out danc
ing with their best girl, they are go
ing about the grim business of killing
other men. It means seeing men so
crazed with fear that they deliber
ately shoot off fingers, toes, or wound
themselves in other ways to get away
from combat.
"War" finally means, to me, the
spending of months in the hospital,
and wondering if I will ever be able
to use my arm again. This word still
conveys the feeling of fear to me, be
cause the memory of it remains all
too clear.
War of No Glory
The "War" I have been talking
about isn't the same one that you
read about in newspapers and see in
the movies. It isn't the same war of
"Ideals" and "Heroes," but a war of
the little men—men who do their job
but get no glory, men who lose their
arms, legs, and even their lives, but
are not known as heroes. These men
are your fathers, brothers, sweet
hearts, and friends. They are the

common, ordinary good Americans j
that are giving up so much for you. j
I know that they want to come back I
to the life they knew, and they want
to do it as soon as they can, and you
are the ones to help them do it.
As you all know, the Fourth War ]
Loan drive is just getting under way, !
and in the buying of war bonds, and
stamps, is tlic only way you can help i
even up the score. Myself, my bud- ;
dies who are still overseas, and your I
friends in the service here in the j
States, and in other parts of the J
world, not only have the right to
expect you to buy bonds and stamps,
but have the right to demand that
you do it.
We also have a contest with "Cal"
during this drive, but that is very
unimportant in comparison with the
real reason for buying, which is to
get this damn thing' over with and
get our friends, sweethearts, and j
families back home just as fast as

EDITOR'S NOTE:—This article
was written by Dick Crane, a
wounded veteran of this war. He
was with the U.S. Marines in the
initial landing on Guadalcanal,
Aug- 7, 1942. While in combat ac
tion for the first five weeks, he was
wounded by shrapnel in a bombing
raid on Sept. 10, 1943. lie spent
eight months in various hospitals
in the Southwest Pacific, New Zea
land, and here in the States. On
being discharged from the Marine
Corps in June 1943, he entered
Stanford University last fall under
the Veteran's Rehabilitation Pro
gram. and is resuming his studies
(hat were interrupted by the war.
As I know some of you personally,
and as I feel that I am one of you
now, I want to convey a message
through the Stanford Daily, just as
if I were talking to each student per
sonally. I want to tell each one of
you what the word "war" means to
me.
"War" means to me travel on the
high seas in a crowded transport,
where every comfort is sacrificed for
space, and the scare of being sunk by
a torpedo, which keeps a hollow feel
ing' of fear in your stomach all the
time.
Long Hours Unloading
"War" means to me the unloading
of vital supplies from ships in the
pouring rain, for 10 days, 18 hours a
day.
"War" means to me going into
combat, not knowing where or when,
until the day before going in, and

then finding the place is somewhere
you or I have never heard about, and
yuu get the morbid feeling of dying
in a strange land.
"War" means to me climbing into
"landing barges," under the din of
shellfire, and the noise of bombs
bursting. You start toward a sandy
beach where you know that men are
waiting to kill you. A helpless feel
ing of fear passes over you, and you
are certain that you are going to die
in the next few minutes.
"War" means to me the living in a
"hell on earth" for five weeks. A
place where the slightest scratch
means infection, because you are
filthy, due to the lack of water to
wash with. A place where malaria
and. elephantiasis, strike, without
warning, and you don't have a
chance to stop it, because there isn't
time to erect hospitals. A place
where you only cat twice a day, be
cause you don't have enough food to
go around; a place that makes the
slice of white bread you are eating
taste like cake, because you only get
one slice a week. A place where you
live in a hole in the ground called a
"foxhole," which could also be very
conveniently used for a coffin, should
you stop a bullet or a piece of shrap
nel.
"War" means to me seeing your
best friends get killed right next to
you, but you have to forget about it
right away, or else you would go
mad. It means that you live in con
stant fear of bombing raids all the
time, and. when the bombers come
over twice a day, you lie there and
pray to God to get you out of the
hellish mess that you are in. You are
sure that every bomb is meant espe
cially for you.
It means that you see young men
age overnight, and on a Saturday
night, when they should be out danc
ing with their best girl, they are go
ing about the grim business of killing
other men. It means seeing men so
crazed with fear that they deliber
ately shoot off fingers, toes, or wound
themselves in other ways to get away
from combat.
"War" finally means, to me, the
spending of months in the hospital,
and wondering if I will ever be able
to use my arm again. This word still
conveys the feeling of fear to me, be
cause the memory of it remains all
too clear.
War of No Glory
The "War" I have been talking
about isn't the same one that you
read about in newspapers and see in
the movies. It isn't the same war of
"Ideals" and "Heroes," but a war of
the little men—men who do their job
but get no glory, men who lose their
arms, legs, and even their lives, but
are not known as heroes. These men
are your fathers, brothers, sweet
hearts, and friends. They are the

common, ordinary good Americans j
that are giving up so much for you. j
I know that they want to come back I
to the life they knew, and they want

"War" finally means, to me, the

War of No Glory
The "War" I have been talking
about isn't the same one that you
read about in newspapers and see in
the movies. It isn't the same war of
"Ideals" and "Heroes," but a war of
the little men—men who do their job
but get no glory, men who lose their
arms, legs, and even their lives, but
are not known as heroes. These men
are your fathers, brothers, sweet
hearts, and friends. They are the

common, ordinary good Americans j
that are giving up so much for you. j
I know that they want to come back I
to the life they knew, and they want
to do it as soon as they can, and you
are the ones to help them do it.

EDITOR'S NOTE:—This article
was written by Dick Crane, a
wounded veteran of this war. He
was with the U.S. Marines in the
initial landing on Guadalcanal,
Aug- 7, 1942. While in combat ac
tion for the first five weeks, he was
wounded by shrapnel in a bombing
raid on Sept. 10, 1943. lie spent
eight months in various hospitals
in the Southwest Pacific, New Zea
land, and here in the States. On
being discharged from the Marine
Corps in June 1943, he entered
Stanford University last fall under
the Veteran's Rehabilitation Pro
gram. and is resuming his studies
(hat were interrupted by the war.
As I know some of you personally,
and as I feel that I am one of you
now, I want to convey a message
through the Stanford Daily, just as
if I were talking to each student per
sonally. I want to tell each one of
you what the word "war" means to
me.
"War" means to me travel on the
high seas in a crowded transport,
where every comfort is sacrificed for
space, and the scare of being sunk by
a torpedo, which keeps a hollow feel
ing' of fear in your stomach all the
time.
Long Hours Unloading
"War" means to me the unloading
of vital supplies from ships in the
pouring rain, for 10 days, 18 hours a
day.
"War" means to me going into
combat, not knowing where or when,
until the day before going in, and

then finding the place is somewhere
you or I have never heard about, and
yuu get the morbid feeling of dying
in a strange land.
"War" means to me climbing into
"landing barges," under the din of
shellfire, and the noise of bombs
bursting. You start toward a sandy
beach where you know that men are
waiting to kill you. A helpless feel
ing of fear passes over you, and you
are certain that you are going to die
in the next few minutes.
"War" means to me the living in a
"hell on earth" for five weeks. A
place where the slightest scratch
means infection, because you are
filthy, due to the lack of water to
wash with. A place where malaria
and. elephantiasis, strike, without
warning, and you don't have a
chance to stop it, because there isn't
time to erect hospitals. A place
where you only cat twice a day, be
cause you don't have enough food to
go around; a place that makes the
slice of white bread you are eating
taste like cake, because you only get
one slice a week. A place where you
live in a hole in the ground called a
"foxhole," which could also be very
conveniently used for a coffin, should
you stop a bullet or a piece of shrap
nel.
"War" means to me seeing your
best friends get killed right next to
you, but you have to forget about it
right away, or else you would go
mad. It means that you live in con
stant fear of bombing raids all the
time, and. when the bombers come
over twice a day, you lie there and
pray to God to get you out of the
hellish mess that you are in. You are
sure that every bomb is meant espe
cially for you.
It means that you see young men
age overnight, and on a Saturday
night, when they should be out danc
ing with their best girl, they are go
ing about the grim business of killing
other men. It means seeing men so
crazed with fear that they deliber
ately shoot off fingers, toes, or wound
