## 
### 
War Board news on meetings, stamp sales, salvage, and Victory Book
drives were summarized today by Carol Hurwitz. War Board chairman.
An Auxiliary meeting of the War Board will be held today at 4 p.m. in
the Women's Clubhouse, and Miss Hurwitz asks that all auxiliary members
attend. At that time representatives who have not turned in the pledge

cards or lists of blood donors are
asked 'to do so. Quotas for the Red
Cross bandage room to be filled by
the Women's living groups will be
given out by Martha Austin.
Knitting Committee
According to Sally Van Dyke,
chairman of the knitting committee,
all knitters will meet for the first
time Tuesday from 2. to 4 at Miss
Yost's house. She hopes that there
will be a big turnout, for new as well
as old members are invited. The
business of the meeting will include
giving out wool and deciding on the
days for future meetings.

Forty dollars of stamps were
sold in the bond booth last week,
according to Miss Hurwitz. No
bonds were sold due to the fact
that everyone is saving for this
week's contest with Cal.

Salvage Collection
The first salvage collection will be
on Feb. 12 and the second on March
13.
Items needed are: rags, not neces
sarily washed; inner tubes (no other
form of rubber); metals such as cop
per. lead, zinc, brass, iron (no sheet
or galvanized iron), and tin cans.
Paper, which is also needed, will be
collected at the above times and at
one other collection for paper only.
Trucks will pick up all the salvage
at the living groups and at private
homes.
