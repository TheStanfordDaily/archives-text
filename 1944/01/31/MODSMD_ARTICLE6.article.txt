'"All Stanford students who are
going to donate blood this Thursday,
Feb. 3, are requested to notify the
War Board office or the Blood Bank
Center in Palo Alto if they have
signed up for Red Cross transporta
tion and do notp lan to use it," ac
cording to Mrs. Robert Powers, head
of the Palo Alto bank.
"On the last Blood Bank day many
Stanford students signed for trans
portation but did not use this fa
cility," she said. "The Motor Corps
made one completely useless trip to
the campus, several trips to pick up
only one or two people. Because of
the gasoline and rubber shortage,
Red Cross station wagons cannot be
sent to Stanford on futile trips."
