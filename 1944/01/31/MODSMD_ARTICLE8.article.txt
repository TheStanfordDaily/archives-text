# Bond Contest Tops Rivalry
## 
### JIM WEINBERG 
The current Bond and Stamp Sale
contest between Stanford and the
University of California marks the
continuation of one of the greatest of
all intercollegiate rivalries. The Cal-
Stanford feud is equalled only the
Harvard-Yale rivalry, and by that
between Army and Navy.
The history of the West's greatest
rivalry may be traced clear back to
the first year after the founding of
Stanford in October 1891. The first
Staniord-Cal. football, contest, was
played March 1!). 1892. in San Fran
cisco's Haight Street Baseball Park.
Stanford won a 14-10 victory over
a highly favored Cal squad in that
first "Big Game." An interesting
sidelight on this first game is the fact
that, due to a lapse of memory on the
past of the officials, the game was de
layed for over an hour while a mes
senger galloped downtown on horse
back to procure a football.
In the years that have elapsed
since the original "Big Game," Cal
and Stanford have met in a total of
48 football contests. Of these, Stan
ford has won 22, Cal has been the
victor in 18, and there have been 8
ties.
Perhaps the greatest of all "Big
Gaines," and the one which will be
remembered and talked about the
longest, is the famous "20-20 Tie" of
1924. This game marked the end of
the reign of supremacy of Califor
nia's "Wonder Teams" (Cal had pre
viously won every "Big Game" since
the World War) and the beginning of
Pop Warner's coaching days on the
Farm.
The "Stanford Axe" has come to be
the symbol of the rivalry between
Stanford and California. It too has a
long and eventful history. The well
known Axe Yell was written by Will
Irwin in 189ti, and in March of 1899
a huge axe was imported from San
Francisco to be the symbol of the
cheer.
On April 15. 1899, the Axe was
brought to San Francisco for the sec
ond game of the California baseball
series of that year. After the game,
the Axe was captured by a group of
