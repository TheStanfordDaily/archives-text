PEARL HARBOR (UP) â€” Seven |
new stinging attacks by Army and ]
Navy planes on the battered, in- ;
vasion - marked Marshall Islands
fccre announced by Adm. Chester VV.
imitz today as Tokyo radio implied
that landing operations against the
alolls might already be under way.
Nimitz's announcement offered no j
support for the Tokyo broadcast
some 12 hours earlier reporting that
Japanese boats, "army and navy
forces," had met powerful U.S. at- i
tacking units in the Marshalls and )
that "fierce fighting' is now going on." j
(British Exchange Telegraph heard
in London late Monday night a
radio-Vichy broadcast of the Tokyo j
report that American shock troops
had landed in the Marshalls and that
fighting was progressing.)
It did, however, detail preparatory j
blows in which all types of Army 1
land-based planes were teaming with
the Navy warships for an assault on
the Jap island stronghold.
