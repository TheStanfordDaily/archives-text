# Juliana Visits Stanford
## 
### BETTYE MONELL ESTHER BELEW 
With the parting remark, "I would like to spend months visiting Stanford
as one can't possibly see all of it in a few hours," Princess Juliana of the
Netherlands ended her tour of the campus yesterday.
The Princess, who came to the Coast for an informal and unofficial visit
last Friday, arrived here at 10:;50 yesterday morning and was welcomed

at an informal reception by the
Dutch teaching staff in the Hoover
War Library. After signing the I
legister and viewing a special Dutch |
exhibit in the library, the Princess i
was honored with a carillon concert, j
Her Highness visited the Memorial j
Church and then had lunch at the
Union. Following the luncheon she
visited Lagunita where she was pre- j
sented with a yellow orchid corsage, j
a gift, of the women's organizations i
on campus.
She left the campus at 2:30 p.m. I
after attending an ASTU Dutch class, j
However, the departure was delayed |
a few minutes while Princess Juliana
met and spoke to "Pete," clerk of
the Union who was born in Holland. !
"The whole campus is simply won- j
derful," said the Princess when
asked of her impressions of Stanford.
"I would like to send my daughters
to Lagunita. We have no dormitories
in Dutch universities. In fact, the
universities really have no campus,
they are just buildings," she con- I
tinued. "But there are as many bi
cycles here as you would find in any
Dutch school," she concluded.
Princess Juliana wore a dusty pink
dress with brown accessories and a
full-length ermine coat. She is trav
eling with her secretary, Dr. William
van Tets. and Mrs. Tets.
Feeling that the Princess would be
served Dutch dishes elsewhere, it
was decided to serve a typical Amer
ican meal at the Union, according to
Anthony E. Sokol. associate professor
of Germanic languages and one of
the arrangers of the tour.
Accompanying Princess Juliana on
her tour of the campus were John P.
Mitchell, acting president of the Uni- i
versity; Paul H. Davis, general sec- !
retary; Harold H. Fisher, director of i
the Hoover War Library; and Dr. |
Sokol.

She left the campus at 2:30 p.m. I
after attending an ASTU Dutch class, j
However, the departure was delayed |
a few minutes while Princess Juliana
met and spoke to "Pete," clerk of
the Union who was born in Holland. !
"The whole campus is simply won- j
derful," said the Princess when
asked of her impressions of Stanford.
"I would like to send my daughters
to Lagunita. We have no dormitories
in Dutch universities. In fact, the
universities really have no campus,
they are just buildings," she con- I
tinued. "But there are as many bi
cycles here as you would find in any
Dutch school," she concluded.
Princess Juliana wore a dusty pink
dress with brown accessories and a
full-length ermine coat. She is trav
eling with her secretary, Dr. William
van Tets. and Mrs. Tets.
Feeling that the Princess would be
served Dutch dishes elsewhere, it
was decided to serve a typical Amer
ican meal at the Union, according to
Anthony E. Sokol. associate professor
of Germanic languages and one of
the arrangers of the tour.
Accompanying Princess Juliana on
her tour of the campus were John P.
Mitchell, acting president of the Uni- i
versity; Paul H. Davis, general sec- !
retary; Harold H. Fisher, director of i
the Hoover War Library; and Dr. |
Sokol.
