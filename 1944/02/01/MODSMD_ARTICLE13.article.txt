# Big and Brave and Loud
## 
### 
IN A City newspaper this weekend there was this story:
" 'There was a little A.A.F. hoy lyinq out there,' said the cap
tain. 'He was lying naked out by a garbage pit. He was nothing
but skin and bones. He was almost gone from chronic dysentery.
The blowflies literally were eating him alive.'
7 asked if I could do anything and he said he wanted me to
take him away somewhere so the other boys wouldn't see him
dying like a rat!' "
What were you doing about that time? Well, next to that we
weren't doing much. And we still aren't doing much.
So there are War Bonds. They're not much either. In fact,
intelligent people will tell you that buying bonds is not some
thing exciting like "backing the attack" or building tanks. They
say that buying bonds is just a means of preventing inflation.
And some of them who know this say they are being duped and
"propagandized" and won't buy bonds.
They—and all the rest of us—would like to do something big
and brave and loud. Buying bonds is none of these things. It's
mundane and stupid and everyday. And you've heard about it
and heard about it and heard about it until ycu could scream at
the sound.
But when you come right down to it, what was there so big
and brave and loud about the A.A.F. kid's story? Particularly
how big and brave and loud was it for him?
Okay, so buying bonds isn't an exciting business. Okay, so
it is stupid and mundane and everyday. But it is something that
has got to be done. So let us, as far as we are able, take example
fiom that A.A.F. kid and do it with grace, do what has got to be
done without fuss. —Nancy Tilden
