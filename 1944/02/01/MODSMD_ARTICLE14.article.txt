### JEAN LEVINSON MY DAY 
Bidding friendly Daly City a last adieu, and boarding my
renovated bomber, I flew like a veritable blast of hot air to a
small outpost in Alaska. Arriving in this wilderness of snow and
blubber for the first time, I found the temperature cold but the
welcome warm. There on the landing field were scores of shiv
ering men in khaki, with welcome smiles frozen on their faces.
"Welcome," they chattered, "welcome."
Then it happened, as if in a dream. I boarded a dog-sled and
sped into the icy wonderland.
"Mush," howled the driver, "mush."
And actually the canines of the north responded by quickly
shifting into second and dashing forward.
By this time the temperature had dropped to 150 below zero
and I commenced to shiver. Removing a Popsicle from behind
my ear, I turned to the hardy driver and asked him if it was
always this chilly. He obligingly chattered his molars in the
affirmative.
After what seemed a decade, we pulled up to an igloo, a sort
of refrigerated pup-tent, and entered. There upon the threshold
was a grinning, friendly native .... known as Eskimo.
With just a moment's hesitation he headed straight toward me,
leading with his bulbous nose. And then remembering my
geography books from childhood, I returned his greeting with
a sideward movement of the head, thus causing our respective
noses to rub together.
With the aid of an ice pick, he helped me out of my Parka,
styled for me by Adrian of Hollywood, and greeted me in this
fashion:
"Lotsa hots grule lagfrop acme," which translated means,
"Sorry, we're fresh out of Kleenex."
We then sat down to a delicious repast of Kiska cantaloupe,
a whale steak, medium rare, and Eskimo pie.
Topping off this dinner we enjoyed a round of "Gastrohelpus,"
or Eskimo Bromo-Seltzer. It had grown colder by this time, and
taking the advice of an old friend who used to be a Good Humor
Man, I thanked my host with more rubbing of the nose, and de
parted
I am looking forward to my visit to an Alaskan USO next
week, and I will tell you of our boys, and how they are enter
tained by the Alaskan fair sex.
