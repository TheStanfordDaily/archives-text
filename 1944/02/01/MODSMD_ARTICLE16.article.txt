Roble Hall began the campus War
I Bond Drive Sunday night with an
j auction that brought in a grand total
S of $6,940.55 pledged to the purchase j
I of bonds.
Auctioneers Ann Wendling and
Marianne Goldman began the bid
ding at 10:30 in the lobby, offering !
such prizes us nylon stockings, din
ners at Dinah's and L'Omelette's, a
bicycle, a shoe ration stamp, and a I
date with Dick Driscoll.
The largest amount pledged for a 1
single item was $2,038.75 for a ver- i
milion Stanford blanket, which sold
to the highest bid of $800. This I
blanket was made from the wool of
the sheep that roamed the Stanford
Quad before the students did. Pre
sented to each of the boys at Encina
by Mrs. Stanford, these blankets are
now a rarity about the campus. An
other relic of days gone by was auc
tioned in the form of a picture of the
Stanford rough of the 1890's, which
sold for $135.
Admission to the auction was 25
j cents which was receipted in war j
; stamps when the drive opened Mon- j
j tlay morning. Since only one half j
j of the Roble girls attended the auc- j
tion, it is expected that the total sum
' bought by them during the week will
| greatly increase the present total.
Bidding Sunday night was made !
on an accumulative basis whereby
! the bidder was pledged to buy
' stamps to the amount bid regardless j
I of whether or not she won the article
offered.
