PREDICTIONS
Well, it loks like Cousin Joe
Bruin of UCLA has crossed us up on
our first prediction of the new year.
We picked the Bruins to make off
with the honors in both of their bas
ketball games against Cal "without
too much trouble." The two teams
met for the first time in Los Angeles
Saturday night, and the result was a
36-27 win for the boys from Berkeley.
This Saturday Cal and UCLA con
clude their 1944 series with a return
engagement to be played in the
Men's Gym at Berkeley. Once again
we have decided to go overboard
with a prediction that the Bruins
will win. From what we've seen of
the two teams thus far this season,
we are still of the opinion that UCLA
has the better club.
Their victory over UCLA last week
makes California a heavy favorite to
win the championship of the Coast
Conference's Southern Division. A
win in just one of their two remain
ing games with SC and UCLA would
cinch the title for the Bears.
POSTWAR SPORTS
There has been a good deal ol talk
in the past few weeks about the post
war sports picture in California.
Groups of businessmen in San Fran
cisco and Los Angeles have applied
for franchises for their cities in the
National Professional Football
LeagCTe. Another Los Angeles group
will attempt to bring the Olympic
Games back to L.A. when they re
sume in 1948 or 1952. Major league
baseball has also been proposed for
Los Angeles.
California deserves the best in all
sports, and has proved its ability to
upport them. There are certain ob
stacles which must be overcome be
fore these plans can succeed, how
ever. For example, the Coast League
would probably be ruined if major
league ball were to come to Califor
nia. It remains to be seen as to
whether or how these problems can
be solved.
