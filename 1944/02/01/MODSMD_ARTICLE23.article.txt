# McKinley A Defeats Hayes, 43-14
## 
### JOE ZUKIN 
A strong McKinley A five got off to
a slow start in one of last night's
mural contests, but came back in the
last half of the tussle to take the
Hayes Hall boys into camp by a de
cisive score of 43 to 14.
At the close of the first half the
Hayes cagers were ahead by a slight
margin of 10 to 8, and it looked as
though they were going to be able to
hold McKinley with their man-to
man defense, but as soon as the sec
ond half opened, the McKinley five
really poured it on and came up for
a grand total ot 4'J dibits.

■j Bob Donahoe stole the scoring
| honors for the winners by tallying
I 16 points, while Tom Martzloff came

up for 10 of the total points. High
point man for the losers was Cassela,
who hit the bucket for six markers.
In the other gym the Med School
five were taking the Cleveland Hall
hoopsters down the row by a fairly
close score of 56 to 42. The Cleveland
team, who are a grossly underrated
live, put up a good tight against their
strong opposition, but were not able
to push the Medics over.
Topping tonight's card are the
Firehouse vs. Buchanan game and
the Fillmore vs. Washington tussle.
Both the Firemen and the Floggers
should coast through these games

I without much trouble at all. In the
| other two games Monroe should take
I Tyler, while Gerona A.C. edges out
j McKinley B.
