# ‘Sing, Sing’ Best Swing Bet

### DICK FLINT 
(Editor's Note: This is the second
in a series of articles on the best in
recorded music. Dick Flint is the
writer of this week's column on the
best in recorded swing music.)

Here is a list of 10 exceptionally
good arrangements that should be
included in every good swing collec
tion of at least 200 records. This list
is not intended to incite riot, so all
you pistol packin' fans please hold
your fire if your opinions differ
greatly.
First on the list, and probably the
most outstanding of all time, is "Sing,
Sing, Sing," by Benny Goodman,
which is now regarded as more or
less a classic in the swing, world.
Considered in a general point of
view, it shows fine taste in all of the

solos and ensemble arrangements. A
rumor has been circulating that
Harry James did not play the first as
well as the second half of the
trumpet solo on the second side.
Five bucks is ottered to anyone who
can prove it.
Second on the list is Count Basie's
immortal "One O'Clock Jump."
Hershel Evans, who is dead now, left
us with a never-to-be-forgotten sax
solo in this one. Of course the Count
is there with his wonderful sim
plicity that is so easy to listen to.
Not very many people are very
well acquainted with Erskine Haw
kins, but if you have ever heard his
"Weary Blues" backed by "King
Porter Stomp," you know that his
arrangements are gifted with an un
paralleled lift. He has made quite a
few very fine recordings but they are
almost all off the market now and it
is next to impossible to find any of
the really good ones.
Then there is the old 21st Century
Maestro Duke Ellington who has
distinguished the field of swing with
contributions such as the popular
"A Train."
Lunceford brought some sax sec
tion color that has never been beaten
for its type in "Annie Laurie" with
Sy Oliver making with the super
man high notes on trumpet followed
by some of the finest bars of trom
bone ever recorded.
"Bolero at the Savoy" by Gene

Krupa is one of the very few of his
that ever really clicked, and it cer
tainly is right up in there for good
execution of a very good arrange- r
ment.
"Midweek Function" by Barnet is
one of his first and best. It has the
inspiration of a fresh band really go
ing places.
Harry James did better solo work
with Benny Goodman than on his I
own except in a few instances such I
as his clever arrangement of "James |
Session." The rest of his ''Trumpet j
Blues" and "Bumble Bee" stuff
shows wonderful musicianship, but j
can't be classed as swing.
Perhaps "Begin the Beguine" can
now be treated as one of those ac- j
cepted things. It certainly took the j
jukeboxes by storm. Artie Shaw can
sit right next to Goodman most of
the time on swing stuff.
"I Can't Get Started" by Bunny
Berigan gives us an idea how well a j
trumpet can be played in both the J
lowest as well as theh ighest regis
ters. Georgie Auld gives with some
really tasty sax work on most of ;
Berigan's best recordings.
If you have these 10 recordings on j
your shelves you may feel justified j
in saying that you really have some
of the best stuff in your swing col
lection. Try it on the girl friend you
guys, you know—Wouldn't you like
to come up and dig some of my fine j
recordings?
