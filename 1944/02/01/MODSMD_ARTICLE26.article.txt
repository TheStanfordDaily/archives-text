# Cultural Leaves Extended to 2 a.m.
## 
### 
Two o'clock cultural late leaves for
women are now in effect, following a
decision made by Women's Confer
ence in its meeting yesterday after
noon.
Replacing the old 1:30 culturals,
these 2 o'clocks may be had by all
students for attending cultural
events like operas, ballets, concerts,
symphonies, or plays â€” not movies.
Lower and Upper Division women
both will have two culturals, per
mission for which must be gotten
from Dede DeFriest preferably by
calling her two days before at her
office.
'Marion Nielson, chairman, empha
sized that these culturals were being
given on a trial basis, and all viola
tions would be considered as honor
code violations.
