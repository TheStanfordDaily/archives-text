## 
### JIM FORD 
The expression of Mrs. Stanford's
eyes at the laying of the University
cornerstone, Herbert Hoover's En
cina room assignment, and Stanford
Mandolin Club serenades form some
of the intimate memories of Miss
Bertha Berner, Mrs. Leland Stan
ford's private secretary, who now
resides in Menlo Park.
Sketching many delightful Farm
incidents of the early days in her
book, ''Mrs. Leland Stanford, An In
timate Account," Miss Berner re
calls especially Mrs. Stanford's out
standing contributions to the Uni
versity.
Devoted to University
Establishing the University as a
memorial to their son. both Senator
and Mrs. Stanford were deeply de
voted to its growth throughout their
lives. Miss Berner remembers the
Senator's laying the cornerstone on
March 14, 1887. Mrs. Stanford stood
at his side, and a deep, serious look
passed between them at the begin
ning of the ceremony. Mrs. Stanford
cried for the rest of the afternoon.
When the University was officially
opened in October 1891, the enroll
ment was small, and the men of En
cina were so few that they could
form a double ring around the Stan
fords after serenading them. During

those early years, the Mandolin Club |
was very prominent, and was gen
erally. present to accompany at such !
serenades.
Concerned With Church
"Of all the building done on the 1
campus during Mrs. Stanford's life
time," says Miss Berner, "the Church
afforded her the greatest satisfac
tion." During the building, of the i
Memorial Church, Mrs. Stanford was
constantly concerned with the mi
nute details of design and ornament.
Frequently she would go to the j
site of the Church to oversee the j
construction. Always on these trips i
she would carry a Bible to check the i
accuracy of the carvings and the
stained glass windows. "While my
heart is in the University," Mrs. j
Stanford said, "my soul is in the j
Church."
