# Argentina: Like Pre-War U.S.
## 
### ENRIQUE SID WELL 
(Editor's Note: For authentic clari
fication of the Argentine situation,
The Daily requested Enrique Sid
well. Stanford engineering student
from Buenos Aires, to sketch this
background of his country's recent
crises.)

Argentina is a proud little nation
which likes to consider itself the
most modern, progressive, and sov
ereign South American state. It does
not want to be told what it should or
should not do. Her present behavior
is very much like that of the United
j States before Pearl Harbor. She
| wants to remain at peace and profit
from her commerce.
Though the war had already been
on for two years before Dec. 7, 1941,
it was only then that it took on a holy
aspect and every South American
country was invited to pitch in. Tnis
was too abrupt a change for Argen
tina. No warring nation had asked
her services prior to Pearl Harbor;
consequently at the Rio Conference.
Castillo's government declined the
invitation to break relations with the
Axis.
Castillo's government was not too
popular, and later, principally be
cause of graft and corruption in gov
ernmental departments, it became
even less so. More efficient Allied
propaganda helped counteract the
German, and the people began to
think that perhaps more aid and soli
darity with the other Americas
should be demonstrated by their
government.
Army Took Advantage
Tlie army took advantage of this
unpopularity of Castillo's govern
ment to effect the coup of June 1943.
The people, thinking this to be a
pro-Allied coup, gave it their whole
hearted support. They should, how

ever, have known their army better.
The Argentine Army has long ad
mired Germany's discipline and
power. It says that since graft, cor
ruption, and unfair elections prevail
in Argentine federal and state gov
ernments, what is needed is a few
years of strong disciplined army rule.
Ramirez's government is providing
just that.
The government is unpopular, but
economically the country is better
off than it has been for years, and
few causes for complaint exist.
Embargo Hastened Break
Lately, however, the United States
seems to have obtained Britain's con
sent to a complete embargo against
all Argentine trade. Knowing that
if carried out, such an embargo
would bring Ramirez's own downfall,
he has hastened to break relations
with the Axis, much to the dismay of
the nationalist colonel's clique which
brought him to power.
Ramirez has thus tried to assure
his perpetuation in power by com
plying with the wishes of a greater
part of the population, has forestalled
an Allied embargo, and has made
Lend-Lease technically available to
Argentina.
It remains to be seen, however,
whether his new cabinet will be
composed of pro-Allied civilian ele
ments from the Radical and Socialist
parties or whether the new govern
ment will again be composed of mili
tarists with an outward expedient
demonstration of love for democracy
and hemispheric cooperation.
