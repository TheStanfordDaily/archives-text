# Stanford Leads California by $25,000
## 
### DAVE DAVIS 
In the first day's sales of the Cal-Stanford Bond Buying Con
test the Farm bought six times the amount of War Bonds and
Stamps sold on the Berkeley campus. Cal sold $5,050 in War
bonds and Stamps, while Stanford purchased approximately
$30,000. This places Stanford within $20,000 of reaching the
guota, set on a basis of population, necessary to share in the
expense of a B-25 Billy Mitchell bomber.
According to Carol Hurwitz, chairman of War Board, even
heavier sales are expected today, and the Farm may go over the
top. The Cal figures indicate that the Bear Bond buyers are
planning a last-minute rush to overwhelm any figures amassed
by steady Stanford purchases during the week.
Therefore every student, faculty member, and anyone help
ing the government fight inflation, and Stanford beat Cal, should
buy more and more bonds and stamps during the week to avoid
a last-minute slump.
Following the Rally held last night, a Community Sing will
be given at the Nitery tonight at 7 o'clock. Frank Rogier will
again appear and participate in the singing of all-time favorites,
"I've Got Sixpence," "For Me and My Gal," "Keep the Home
Fires Burning," "Anchors Aweigh."
lulie Cook, head of Nitery Committee, has announced that
food will be served for War Stamps, and that there will be
dancing. It is also possible that Miss Kathleen Norris, well
known authoress, may appear to sell bonds.
Wednesday night the Kappas are in charge of Nitery enter
tainment, while Thursday night skits from the "G.I. Gaieties"
will be presented. War Board will give a dance in the Nitery on
Friday night.
Miss Hurwitz has also requested that any women who car
aid in the sales of stamps and bonds, report to the War Board
office this afternoon between 1:30 and 4 p.m. "We need several
more to make our organization fully efficient," Miss Hurwitz said.
