# Cal Asks Ratio Change--Farm $16,297 Ahead
## 
### 
Natalie Burdick, president of the
state student institution at Berkeley,
yesterday requested Stanford to
change the ratio previously agreed
upon lor the percentage bond quota
of each campus, since a- "mistake"
had been made in the calculation of
the Cal population."
Katie 1.85 to 1
The altered ration would be 1.85
to 1, giving Cal a population of
10,200, Stanford a population oi 5,500.
The previously agreed upon ratio
was 2.4 to 1, but with the new
ratio Cal will have to buy only 1.85
times the amount of bonds purchased
by Stanford in order to win the
contest.

Action on the request is pending,
but Dick Driscoll, Stanford president,
said that it was "likely'' that the
ASSU would accede. Driscoll also
pointed out that, "if everyone buys
one $18.75 bond we can contribute
almost $100,000 toward the purchase
of a B-25 medium bomber. Let each
one of you appoint himself a War
Bond salesman. Contact family,
friends, everyone, and urge him to
buy bonds through our student sales
organization," Driscoll said.
The new ratio, while unexpected,
has only served to increase the ef
forts of students working to put
Stanford on top as winner in the
current drive, which ends Saturday
at 5 p.m.

Party To Boost Total
The Nitery Party tonight, planned
and presented by the Kappas, should
increase the Stanford bond total.

Stanford has purchased $42..'»1fi in
War Bonds and Stamps to date.
$38,000 (exact figures) was purchased
on Monday.
Cal lias purchased to date $2(i,01fl
in War Bonds and Stamps.

A War Bond drawing will be held
during a program of dancing and
entertainment, at which time prizes
will be awarded the two winners, one
boy and one girl. The specific awards
have not been decided on as yet.
Any man or woman buying a war

stamp will become eligible for the
drawing, which will be held at 9:15.
Admission Free
Admission is free to the Nitery,
with the Kappa program starting at
7, continuing until 10 p.m. The bond
drawing, and a bond auction will
held at 9:15 for the benefit of army •
students who cannot come earlier. I
Winner of the bond auction will re- !
ceive a from the mys- i
tery cylinder of Kappa Magician

composed of Renee Linquist, Jean
Bulk, Pat Dana, and Leo Byrne,

boogie-woogie on the Stanford piano,
and a dramatic satire depicting the
life of students at Berkeley (Calif.).
Watch for Girls
All men planning to attend the
Kappa Nitery Show are advised to
j look for women wearing red, white,
I and blue hair ribbons. If these are
J approached with a 10-cent War
Stamp—well, come and find out tor
j yourself.
Bonds and stamps will be on sale
at the Nitery during this evening,
and Luana Forkner, ASSU vice
president, reminded students that
only four days of the bond-buying
drive are left. "Every time you see
a Bond Booth," Miss Forkner said,
"you know what to do."
