### JEAN LEVINSON 
It is a crisp, bright day on the Stanford campus. The pigeons
are lazily dive-bombing on Inner Quad. The professors are giv- j
ing forth with tidbits of knowledge, and the students are absorb-;
ing this information. Everything is peaceful and serene.
Then it happens! The 10 o'clock bell rings and the students
leave their classrooms and head for their next class. As if a
sguadron of Gremlins had invaded the campus, bicycles zoom
from every direction .... careening, screeching, and colliding, j
Pedestrian students become hysterical and run for protective
shelter. Pigeons make crash landings and shiver in their nests.
The serenity is shattered by these two-wheeled monstrosities. I
Then occur accidents galore. Time-honored oak trees are
spattered with the blood of near-sighted cyclists. Torn limbs and
screams of anguish mar the beauty of Inner Quad. Many stu-1
dents miss their next class because they are afraid to venture out
into the field of massacre.
All kidding aside, as you have probably surmised by now,;
the bicycle problem has become a mighty serious thing.
There is absolutely no excuse for continually ignoring 'the
pleas of Gordy Davis, our local Dick Tracy. He has asked you
bicycle fans time and again to avoid riding on the Quad, and
you have paid not the slightest* heed. Have you no pity for the
helpless pedestrian? Have you no consideration for the life and
limbs of a fellow human being? It seems not.
Come on now, really cooperate with the law and keep those !
vehicles of yours off the Quad. It will be appreciated, believe me.
