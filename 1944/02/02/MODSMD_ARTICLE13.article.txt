(or Thoughts on the Proposed Elimination of ASTP)
Should Congress act to save the dads,
And should the student-soldiers go,
Leaving the Farm to rightful grads—
Say, Muse, what sights your crystals show.
Now the co-ed on her wheel
May feerless ride, unwhistled after,
• No more will sound her frightened sgueel
And the hoarse, lewd notes of khaki laughter ....
The tender grass now rears her head
With pride, nor fears the G.I. boot
That beat her nap with ruthless tread,
With cigarette destroyed her root.
In the great dim empty reading room.
The Stanford scholar spreads his notes,
To catch sly truth; and in the gloom,
The Nitery once, the spider gloats.
Unruffled flows the Daily's prose
Like ointment when the fly is out;
No longer Campus Opinion shows
The carpings of the envious rout.
Yet did the meeting leave its print?
Do the bubbling waters of the Nile
And the golden sands that be there, in't
Tell where has passed the crocodile?
Will the soldier's mind perhaps turn,
As he burrows frantic through the sod
Or 'neath a tropic sun doth burn,
To the cool sweet shapes that decked the Quad?
And will the co-ed wake up screaming,
Her body bathed in cold sweat,
As through the pleasant realms of dreaming
March nightmare squads she would forget?
Poeticus.
