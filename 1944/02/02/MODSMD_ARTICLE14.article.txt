# University Press Announces New Publications for Spring
## 
### 
A series of Chinese language "flash" cards will appear with four other
publications released by the Stanford University Press this spring, accord
ing to Stanley M. Croonquist, sales manager.
The "flash" cards are similar to the system by which primary school
students learn their multiplication tables; the word symbol is on one side

and the English on the other, in ease
memory fails. They are primarily
for use with Dr. S. W. Chan's "Ele
mentary Chinese Reader" now in its
fifth printing.
"Illustrated Flora of the Pacific
States," volume 2, by Professor Leroy
Abrams of the School of Biological
Sciences, is the latest volume in the
series of four. It is an authoritative
work covering the flora of the entire
North American Pacific coast, ac
cording to Mr. Croonquist.
Professor Gilbert Morgan Smith,
also of the School of Biological Sci
ences, will have his book, "Algae of
the Monterey Peninsula" released in
the spring.
A new approach to the teaching of
diplomatic history is embodied in
Richard W. Van Alstyne's "American
Diplomacy in Action." Dr. Van Al
styne, of Chico State College, bases
his history on case studies instead of
the usual topical and chronological
method.
The second in a series, for the
American Association of Applied
Psychology is Harold D. Carter's
book, "Vocational Interests and Job
Orientation." Dr. Carter is of the
University of California faculty.
