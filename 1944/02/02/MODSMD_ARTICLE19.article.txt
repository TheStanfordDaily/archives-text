# Intensive German Course To Be Held
## 
### 
A 15-unit intensive German course
limited to 20 students will be ottered
Summer Quarter, according to Dr.
Bayard Q. Morgan, professor of Ger
man. An enrollment of at least 10
students is needed to open the course.
This intensive course is similar to
the language courses that the Army
has offered here and at other col
leges. ft will take all of the student's
time and it is hoped that a German
language table can be formed for in
formal discussions, Dr. Morgan
added.
ft has not been decided yet wheth
er the course will fulfill lower divi
sion requirements but it is probable
that it will at least fill these re
quirements in part.
