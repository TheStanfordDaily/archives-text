soldier and civilian students during
the last year.

was just 16 points short of a possible
score of 700 in the seven events. His
record of 684 surpassed that of
George Beakley, ASTP student, who
was hailed as the "one man in 10,000'*
when he piled up his 645 score some
time ago.

made perfect scores in every event
except two. and in these he was only
a few points short of perfect.
Miller's athletic abilities will soon
be transferred to the Hollywood All-
Stars when the Van Nuys athlete is
graduated and leaves to try out for
