CLEVELAND (UP) — Alva Brad
ley, one of organized baseball's
frankest magnates, advised major
league owners today to suspend op
eration for the duration rather than
present "a low form of comedy" dur
ing the 1944 season.
The white-thatched 59-year-old
president of the Cleveland Indians
said that the game would be a
"farce" if teams don't have the play
ers to man each position with an ex
perienced hand.
Bradley, who last year held a
gloomy outlook on the game's fu
ture amid the restrictions of wartime
and later was rebuked by Commis
sioner Kennesaw M. Landis, asserted
he believed a club could operate
with 20 or 21 players but that the
fans would not tolerate "a greatly
H'erior brand."
