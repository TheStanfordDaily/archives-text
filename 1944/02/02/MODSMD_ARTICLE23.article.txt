# Firehouse, Fillmore Victors in Rough Tilts
## 
### FRANK CREEDE 
All teams participating in the 7:15
games lacked the precision, team
work. and above all the smoothness
which constitutes good, interesting
basketball. Last night's games were
a combination of sloppy basketball
and running wrestling matches,
amusing but far from good basket
ball.
The Firehouse wcTVi their game
with Buchanan 35-23, in a game
which might be termed burlesque
basketball. Players knocked each
other down, threw the ball where
there was no team-mate to catch it,

I and made wild shots which rarely
even reached the backboard.
Smith of the Firehouse made up
for the shortcomings of his team
mates by ringing up 24 digits on ye
olde scoreboard. Forbes supplied a
ray of hope for Buchanan by putting
11 points through the hoop. In the
second game Fillmore beat Washing
j ion -10-28.
Ths Fillmore boys remained un
beaten by punching, slugging, and
occasionally playing a little basket
ball. Six out of the 10 men playing
should have been benched for in
tentional fovds.

Chuck Stewart, with 19 points, and
■ Louis Fentnor, with 15 digits, won
j the game for the Fillmore Floggers.
! Wellington and Ponceford were the
I high-point men for Washington,
scoring eight and nine buckets re
spectively.
Tonight's games feature the big
i two of mural basketball, MyKinley
I A and the Roble Hashers. McKinley
| A should take a hard-fought game
from Cleveland by about 15 points.
Roble Hashers will "breeze by the
Med School with 20 points to the
good, Lincoln will take the nod from

Hayes, and Adams will win from
Buchanan provided Garfield plays
or them.
In the 8:15 games Monroe won a
very close contest with Tyler 27-25.
The scores of the two teams were
, never separated bv more than three
! points. The high scorers for Monroe
were Ed Luce and Ric Supple with
! eight points each, Hanson for Tyler
with six. Gerona A.C. took an easy
one from McKinley B 46-15. Russ
Lee was high-point man for Gerona
| with 12 through the hoop, while
j Moore and Zukin were high for Mc-
I Kinlev.

All teams participating in the 7:15
games lacked the precision, team
work. and above all the smoothness
which constitutes good, interesting
basketball. Last night's games were
a combination of sloppy basketball
and running wrestling matches,
amusing but far from good basket
ball.
The Firehouse wcTVi their game
with Buchanan 35-23, in a game
which might be termed burlesque
basketball. Players knocked each
other down, threw the ball where
there was no team-mate to catch it,

I and made wild shots which rarely
even reached the backboard.
Smith of the Firehouse made up
for the shortcomings of his team
mates by ringing up 24 digits on ye
olde scoreboard. Forbes supplied a
ray of hope for Buchanan by putting
11 points through the hoop. In the
second game Fillmore beat Washing
j ion -10-28.
Ths Fillmore boys remained un
beaten by punching, slugging, and
occasionally playing a little basket
ball. Six out of the 10 men playing
should have been benched for in
tentional fovds.

Chuck Stewart, with 19 points, and
■ Louis Fentnor, with 15 digits, won
j the game for the Fillmore Floggers.
! Wellington and Ponceford were the
I high-point men for Washington,
scoring eight and nine buckets re
