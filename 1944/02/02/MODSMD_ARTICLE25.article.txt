# Series Speaker Discusses German Post-War Status
## 
### 
"Do you want Germany to disintegrate economically and politically to
prevent its future aggression?" This was one of the many post-war ques
tions put to the Tuesday Evening Series audience last night by Gottfried
R. Treviranus, former member of the German government.
"Although Hitler has scrambled the currencies, creeds, and constitutions

.... of Europe, there is no chance *
of keeping Europe from going back
to the old system under a new de
sign," abserved Mr. Treviranus, who
has served eight years on the Ger
man Reichstag, two as deputy leader
of the Nationalist Party.
In 1931 he became Minister of
Transportation under the Bruning
government, but resigned with the
rise of Hitler. His escape from Ger
man guards intent on murdering him
earned him the description as "a
modern Monte Cristo" in John
Gunther's book "Inside Europe."
The world traveler approached the
status of post-war Germany with the
attitude that there was no problem
which could not be solved, particu
larly if teamwork were applied.
Mr. Treviranus contended that
should we attempt to "dismember
the union" of Germany, or "kill all .
the generals in a bunch," we would
merely be allowing Hitler's doctrine
to stand in our own house.
The speaker quoted Herbert Hoo
ver, saying that we cannot have
peace and vengeance at the same i
time. He urged that we approach the !
peace to come with courage and the i
insistence that others will not fall
into our past ways.
