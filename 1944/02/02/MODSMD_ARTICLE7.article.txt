### ELLEN MARCUS 
By special permission from the War Department. Stanford army students
j will be able to see three of the five prize-winning one-act army plays
! which were presented last season on the New York stage.
Broadway Product" John Golden, whose idea it was to sponsor the con-
I test open to all men in the United States Army, staged the plays under

| the title, '"The Army Play by Play,"'
and turned over the rights and pro
ceeds to the Army Emergency Relief.
Stanford is one of the first army
posts given permission to present
these plays for and by their own
personnel.
i Irving Appointed
Pfc. Bud Irving of Co. G has been
I appointed production manager to
! help David Sievers and John Sollers
i of the speech and drama department,
who are supervising the production.
J The entire cast and crew will be
! comprised of army students in ac
cordance with Mr. Golden's wish
i that it be an "all-soldier" show.
The three plays chosen for pres
entation at the Farm are "Button
Your Lip," "Mail Call." and "Pai'k
,Up Your Troubles." The first is a
: comedy satirizing the proverbial
i rookie, but in a new setting.
Serious Drama
"Mail Call," which has been pre
sented several times on the radio
since its Broadway premier, is a
serious drama about six men in a
deserted village behind the lines. On
j their decision whether or not to open
: a dead man's letter rests the un
usual theme of the play.
"Pack Up Your Troubles" is also
i a comedy which evolves around the
j plight of a typical "G.I. Joe" who is
about to become a father.
