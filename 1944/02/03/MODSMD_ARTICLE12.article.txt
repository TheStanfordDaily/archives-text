## 
### 
The University of California, al
though still lagging behind in the
War Stamp and Bond contest with
Stanford, yesterday hit a total of
$45,419.42 in sales, indicating that
the Bear is no longer asleep, but is
ready to offer some real competition
as part of the Fourth War Loan
Drive, according to ASSU President
Dick Driscoll.
With the change in ratio Stanford

sales have not yet topped the
but purchases have reached $53,-
459.15. and the total is steadily ris
ing, although more stamps and bonds
were sold yesterday at Cal than here.
'"Our goal now," says Driscoll, "is
to purchase one B-25 Billy Mitchel'
medium bomber with money from
Stanford alone." This means selling
over- $100,000 worth of stamps and
bonds, or, in other words, everyone
must buy at least one $18.75 bond.
Bond booths, open from 8 to 6
every day, are located on campus at
the Cellar, English Corner. Library,
Psychology corner, Women's Gym,
and the B.A.C. Booths for army stu
dents will be open from 11 to 1 and.
5 to 5:45 at the dining halls of Bran
ner and Encina.
All faculty and non-faculty Uni
versity employees, and parents and
friends of students may send in bond
subscriptions up to the time of the
contest deadline. Saturday at 5 p.m
