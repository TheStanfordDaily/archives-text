### JEAN LEVINSON 
It all started when I grew restless in the Reserve Book Room,
and was developing an indentation of the cranium from dozing
on the desk. A chum rapped on the desk with insistent knuckles,
and wheezed into my tympanic membrane: "Let's go to the Nitery
for a coke and then study there, huh-" Needing no further goad
ing, I followed closely on her heels .... doing only slight dam
age .... and we skipped merrily to the Nitery, chuckling and
pleased with the finp scheme.
Doing the Australian Crawl through the heavy moisture in the
air, we arrived at our rendezvous and ran a 440 to the two re
maining sitting apparatuses and collapsed.
"Save these two seats till we come back," we demanded of
a rumpled khaki form snoring resonantly in the adjoining chair.
"Glurp," was the cooperative reply.
Arming ourselves with two bottles of that good Coca-Cola,
we settled down to study. Then a bridge game turned into a
hatchet murder as one bidder made the fatal mistake of ignoring
his partner's Blackwood system and free-lancing on Culbertson.
That was all right although I had grown a wee bit tired of re
reading one sentence for the 30th time, but the inevitable hap.
pened-. A radio fan twitching in the corner attempted to burn
out the remaining tube by blasting out with "Shoo Shoo Baby,"
so we took the hint and exited.
"That was ever so much fun, wasn't it-" asked my bright
eyed chum, "now let's go study in one of those comfy chairs in
the Cellar, and we can watch all the kids walk in and out and
everything, huh."
"Yeah, that sounds like scads of joy. Let's away!" And we
did, once more settling ourselves in those comfy nightmares.
Now poured a steady cavalcade of friends and neighbors.
"Wanta Cheezit?" "Have a Nabs?" "Gotta cig you fine, upstand
ing girl?" "Here, munch on a potato chip." "Know what time it
is?" 'You've got a run, ha ha ha." "What's the good word?" "Buy
a war stamp?" "Not studying, are you Quiz Kid?" And so the
drone went on.
The moral is, little friends of the University .... if you've
got anything to study, either resign yourself to flunk out and
ignore the whole thing entirely, or remain in the R.B.R. and bring
along a pillow.
