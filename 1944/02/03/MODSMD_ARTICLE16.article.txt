To the Editor:
We wonder if it would be possible to inaugurate a few more
lights on campus, especially between the Engineering building
and the men's dorms? White posts marking the main arteries
would be of considerable help.
With only a few stars millions of miles away and the shaded
light from a lonely room in one of the barracks to guide us, it is
a mystery to me that more G.l.'s are not up at the Oakland Hos
pital.
It may be that the army authorities want us to continue to be
efficient at night patrols and stealth, but for those returning before
2230, army time, well, they don't need the practice.
How about it? It's O.K. to have it dark by Roble and Lagunita,
that's different, but between the Ecfbuilding, the Libe, and Encina
Hall, how about letting us see which way is home?
