LONDON, Feb. 3 (UP)â€”A Red
Army spearhead advanced one-half
mile into Estonia yesterday by cap
turing the town of Vanakula, while
other Soviet forces' under General
Leonid A. Govorov drove to the bor
der along a curving front extending
to 35 miles.
The Russians captured more than
40 towns and settlements in pushing
toward the German stronghold of
Narva, six miles over the border, but
on other parts of the Leningrad front
German resistance appeared to have
stiffened as Moscow communiques
reported only limited gains.
