# U. of Minn. Abolishes Student Standby—'E"
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
The University of Minnesota has
followed the government's lead in
changing alphabetical agencies. Said
University has just liquidated a boon
companion of thousands of students
who didn't quite pass, but on the
other hand, didn't quite fail.
This friend to flunkers was the
grade "E," the conditional grade,
which was given to a student who
had done unsatisfactory work but to
whom the instructor was willing to
give another chance in the form of a
second examination.
However, it was not without
lengthy discussion and revealing in
quiry, that the Minnesota dons de
cided to abolish this beloved grade.
Hereafter, a student will receive
either A, B, C, or D. if he is to be
passed, or else the familiar, blunt
grade ol "F" meaning failure.
The authorities failed to reveal
whether the new wartime standing
of "E"—which- has become the
Army-Navy standard for "excel
lence"—had anything to do with
abandoning the "E" as a symbol of
almost failure.
Any new developments in this case
will be immediately submited for
your contemplation.
