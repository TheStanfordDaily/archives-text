Stanford basketballers have an ex
cellent opportunity this weekend to
gain revenge over USC for their two
defeats at the hands of the Trojans
last year. This Saturday night, while
UCLA and Cal a're fighting it out for
the Southern Division crown in
Berkeley, the Trojans will be trying
to cope with the St. Mary's Pre-
Flighters in Los Angeles.
Three of the Pre-Flight stars who
will face S.C. Saturday night are
Stanford men. Heading the list, of
course, is the incomparable Hank
Luiselti. Hank, probably the best
basketball player the game has pro
duced, is having another outstand
ing season this year. He is a lieu
tenant (j.g.) at the Navy Pre-Flight
school.
Dallmar Joins Team
Howie Dallmar, a new arrival with
the Pre - Flight squad, should
strengthen the team considerably.
He played a great game at guard for
Stanford in 1942 and 1943. When
Stanford won the N.C.A.A. cham
pionship in 1942, Dallmar was picked
as the most valuable player in the fi
nal game (Which Stanford won from
Dartmouth, 53-38) by the National
Coaches' Association.
The third Stanford man on the
Pre-Flight five is H. B. Lee, whose
name should be familiar to those of
us who were following Stanford bas
ketball in the Luisetti era. Lee was
a teammate of Hank's and played
guard for the Indians. He is also a
lieutenant (j.g.).
USC Representatives
USC also has some representation
on the Pre-Flight team, including
Cadet Bob Ulm, former Trojan Frosh
star, and Lieut, (j.g.) Frank Hopkins,
who played varsity ball for S.C. be
tween 1930 and 1932.
Sax Elliott, who coaches the Air
devils, is himself a former Trojan
star. He played forward for the Tro
jans in the early 30's, on the same
teams with the great Lee Guttero,
Julie Bescos, and Ernie Holbrook.
