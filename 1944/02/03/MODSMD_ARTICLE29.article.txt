# Gowns To Give Drama Color
## 
### 
With the opening performance less
than a week away, the costumes for
"Young Man of Today" are nearly
completed and promise to add color
and charm to the already colorful
play.
The bride's and bridesmaid's
dresses, which will be seen in the
play's Christmas wedding scene,
were featured in the display windows
of the Clothes Closet in Palo Alto
during the beginning of this week.
Carrying out the holiday theme, the
wedding party was dressed in Christ
mas red while the bride wore the
traditional white.
The bride's gown was made of
white brocade with a square neck
and full-length sleeves. It was made
and designed by Margaret Morgan
and will be worn in the play by Nan
Tillson. Peggy Fitts will wear the
bridesmaid's dress which is the same
style as the bride's. Both bouquets
will be of red and white poinsettias
and a pearl crown with embroidered
French veiling will adorn the bride's
head.
A pair of lounging pajamas was
also designed for Miss Fitts. They
consist of a bright chartreuse bro
caded blouse and black satin pants.
Most of the costumes which are
being m&de in the costume classes
are of more substantial material than
the usual "cheese-cloth" as they are
going to be bought by the cats after
the show.
