# Davis Warns Farm Cyclists

More strict measures will be taken
| against cyclists who persist in leav
ing their bicycles on the Quad, Po
lice Chief Gordon R. Davis stated.
Unless students leave their bicycles
j off the Quad, the bikes will be picked
: up in a truck and. stored in a ware
house. The owners would then have
to claim their bikes and assume full
i responsibility for them. Also the
I cyclists might be cited for leaving
j them on the Quad.
Cyclists may use the racks pro
j vided and also use those racks under
| the outer colonnade of the Quad near
; the Physics, Biology, Business
School, History, and Romanic Lan
, guages buildings. These are racks
provided for other cyclists who bring
; their bikes to the Quad and leave
them for the entire day. It is not
i desirable for those to use these racks
i who shift from one class to another.
! Cyclists will have to put up with wet
bikes as it is neither feasible or
practical to construct bicycle sheds.
Davis also stated that there are
| considerable numbers of bicycles
being operated without headlights or
tail lights. There is no excuse for a
bike to be without a red re
flector as these are easily obtainable
! at bicycle shops or gas stations. The
use of these will save someone a lot
of pain and hospital bills.
