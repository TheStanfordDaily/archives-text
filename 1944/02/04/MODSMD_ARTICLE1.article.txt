# CAL LEADS IN BOND RACK
## Bears Save Money for Last-Minute Victory; Cal Now $5,000 Ahead 
### 
By establishing a $5,000 lead in the current tussle for
bond-buying supremacy the Bear put a damper on the
hopes of many Li'l Indians that the Farm would come
out the victor of the contest.
Cumulative totals to date give Cal 871,000 in War
Bonds and Stamps; Stanford, $66,000.
Cal buyers have evidently been counting on a slump
in Farm purchases, and have saved money until the
week's end in order to win. Saturday afternoon Cal
plans a gigantic bond rally, complete with motion pic
ture stars, hoopla, and hubba-hubba, which will begin
at 2 in the afternoon. Since the contest sales continue
until 5 p.m. Saturday, this last-minute rally could easily
put the Bear out in front. «.
Contributions from Cal alumni are coming at an
ever increasing rate, while mail contributions from
Stanford alumni are as yet slight.
Although both schools entered the contest to aid the
government fight against inflation, and support the
Fourth War Loan, Cal is more concerned with winning
the contest against Stanford than supporting the Fourth
War Loan. Whereas Stanford men and women have
been buying bonds steadily throughout the week, Cal
is relying on financial strategy to win. The change in
population ratio also aids Cal, as the school must now
buy only 1.85 times the amount of bonds purchased by
Stanford—the previous ratio was 2.4 to 1.
Li'l Indian felt the punch, but he is by no means down
for the 10 count, according to Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president.
"If we are to win," Driscoll said, "everyone must buv

an $18.75 bond at least. Everyone come to the the
dances tonight at the Nitery, and at the Women's Club
house. and come prepared to spend," Driscoll said.
Stanford accepted the Cal challenge originally, in
order to support the Fourth War Loan. The first day's
sales amounted to approximately $38,000. but have
fallen oft' to an average of $5,000 per day, until Thurs
day. when the total sales were nearly $12,000.
Cal, on the other hand, started with a poor showing
of $5,000 but has increased the sales every day until
reaching the lead of $71,000.
Only two days remain to buy the bonds or stamps
which will count in the Cal-Stanford contest, today, and
Saturday until 5 p.m. If the Farm relaxes after having
done such an excellent job of selling bonds to stu
dents, friends, Palo Altans, and army students, the Cal
rally on Saturday may give the Bear the extra amount
he needs to win the Stanford Banner.
"The Farm must increase purchases on these two
days," urges Carol Hurwitz, chairman of War Board.
"If we buy more bonds and stamps than on any other
preceding day. if friends will buy through the student
sales organizations, we can be proud of a definite con
tribution to the Fourth War Loan Drive."
Irma Cunha, editor of the Stanford Daily also said.
"This is our last day of publication and our last chance
to inform you of bond sales totals at Cal, and the Cal
strategy. Between now and Saturday at 5 p.m. anything
may happen, and the only way for the Farm to avoid
a catastrophe is for everyone to buy that $18.75 bond
now."

Cal, on the other hand, started with a poor showing
of $5,000 but has increased the sales every day until
reaching the lead of $71,000.
Only two days remain to buy the bonds or stamps
which will count in the Cal-Stanford contest, today, and
Saturday until 5 p.m. If the Farm relaxes after having
done such an excellent job of selling bonds to stu
dents, friends, Palo Altans, and army students, the Cal
rally on Saturday may give the Bear the extra amount
he needs to win the Stanford Banner.
"The Farm must increase purchases on these two
days," urges Carol Hurwitz, chairman of War Board.
"If we buy more bonds and stamps than on any other
preceding day. if friends will buy through the student
sales organizations, we can be proud of a definite con
tribution to the Fourth War Loan Drive."
Irma Cunha, editor of the Stanford Daily also said.
"This is our last day of publication and our last chance
to inform you of bond sales totals at Cal, and the Cal
strategy. Between now and Saturday at 5 p.m. anything
may happen, and the only way for the Farm to avoid
a catastrophe is for everyone to buy that $18.75 bond
now."
By establishing a $5,000 lead in the current tussle for
bond-buying supremacy the Bear put a damper on the
hopes of many Li'l Indians that the Farm would come
out the victor of the contest.
Cumulative totals to date give Cal 871,000 in War
Bonds and Stamps; Stanford, $66,000.
Cal buyers have evidently been counting on a slump
in Farm purchases, and have saved money until the
week's end in order to win. Saturday afternoon Cal
plans a gigantic bond rally, complete with motion pic
ture stars, hoopla, and hubba-hubba, which will begin
at 2 in the afternoon. Since the contest sales continue
until 5 p.m. Saturday, this last-minute rally could easily
put the Bear out in front. «.
Contributions from Cal alumni are coming at an
ever increasing rate, while mail contributions from
Stanford alumni are as yet slight.
Although both schools entered the contest to aid the
government fight against inflation, and support the
Fourth War Loan, Cal is more concerned with winning
the contest against Stanford than supporting the Fourth
War Loan. Whereas Stanford men and women have
been buying bonds steadily throughout the week, Cal
is relying on financial strategy to win. The change in
population ratio also aids Cal, as the school must now
buy only 1.85 times the amount of bonds purchased by
Stanford—the previous ratio was 2.4 to 1.
Li'l Indian felt the punch, but he is by no means down
for the 10 count, according to Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president.
"If we are to win," Driscoll said, "everyone must buv

an $18.75 bond at least. Everyone come to the the
dances tonight at the Nitery, and at the Women's Club
house. and come prepared to spend," Driscoll said.
Stanford accepted the Cal challenge originally, in
order to support the Fourth War Loan. The first day's
sales amounted to approximately $38,000. but have
fallen oft' to an average of $5,000 per day, until Thurs
day. when the total sales were nearly $12,000.
