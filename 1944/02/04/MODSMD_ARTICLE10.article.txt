"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY
IT GOES"
By Faith Baldwin
(The story thus far): Pamela said goodbye
to her love, Geoffrey, and met Stephen over
a cup of cocoa. He longingly begged that
she accompany him to his aircraft factory,
but she replied:
"You see, I must confess to you I'm expect
ing . . . Christopher home any minue from off'n
a submarine, and I must dash back and bake
a batch of Toll House cookies. A rivederci!"
Stephen paled and his nostrils guavered.
"All right Pamela . . . may destiny bring us
together sometime, someplace, somewhere.
Thank you for the most glorious fifteen min
utes of my life. Toodle loo."
A dank mist hung low and ominous as Pa
mela wended her way homeward. Feeling
lonely and oh so depressed. The El Greco
eyed girl stopped before a huddled figure on
the corner. She looked into the face of the
old woman selling violets in the thick fog,
and in that wrinkled physiognomy Pamela be
held all of the wisdom and peace of all time.
The woman's watery, bloodshot eyes seemed

to say, "Take it easy, child . . . take it easy."
With all of the kindness and consideration
of her seventeen years, Pam purchased one j
bunch of violets from the ancient woman, and
started down the street.
However, the old woman fingered the dime
in her bony hand and mumbled something
that sounded like, "Cheapskate!"
Ahead of Pamela loomed up out of the fog
the dark forms of trees, and she decided to
rest in the deserted park for a while. Settling
herself on the clammy seat of the bench, Pam
crushed the little bunch of violets to her face.
The pungent, heady odor of the little fleurs
brought back untold memories.
Large, salt tears welled in her lovely eyes
and rolled down her peach-like cheeks . . .
making a wet, sodden mass of her mink coat.
Chills began to shoot up and down her spine,
as Pamela thought to herself:
"Wolfgang used to buy me violets . . . ah,
those days in the Alps with Wolf . . . wonder- ;
ful, carefree, ecstatic days. And the nights ... I
Wolf and I under the blanket of millions of
stars . . . the orchestra playing the 'Hut-Sut
Song,' . . . pink champagne and seguins . . . j
that roaring fire in the old Inn. . . . Ah Wolf!"
Pamela was lost in a hazy rut of reminis
cence. Suddenly out of the fog appeared a
black-cloaked figure with something gleaming
in his hand. He padded toward Pam on cat
like feet, and suddenly she jumped up and |
was utterly terrified. To run for it or not, what
would she do? There was no one nearby for
it was very late ... no one to help her . . . I
no one.
The figure suddenly growled threateningly,
and with a terrific lunge, grabbed the helpless
girl and pinioned her arms to her sides.
Pam tried to scream but found she was par
alyzed with fear. She struggled but could not
weaken the steely grip of her assailant.
His piercing eyes hypnotized her as he said:
"Steady, I'm not going to hurt you. I only
want to

girl and pinioned her arms to her sides.
Pam tried to scream but found she was par
alyzed with fear. She struggled but could not
weaken the steely grip of her assailant.
His piercing eyes hypnotized her as he said:

"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY
IT GOES"
By Faith Baldwin
(The story thus far): Pamela said goodbye
to her love, Geoffrey, and met Stephen over
a cup of cocoa. He longingly begged that
she accompany him to his aircraft factory,
but she replied:
"You see, I must confess to you I'm expect
ing . . . Christopher home any minue from off'n
a submarine, and I must dash back and bake
a batch of Toll House cookies. A rivederci!"
Stephen paled and his nostrils guavered.
"All right Pamela . . . may destiny bring us
together sometime, someplace, somewhere.
Thank you for the most glorious fifteen min
utes of my life. Toodle loo."
A dank mist hung low and ominous as Pa
mela wended her way homeward. Feeling
lonely and oh so depressed. The El Greco
eyed girl stopped before a huddled figure on
the corner. She looked into the face of the
old woman selling violets in the thick fog,
and in that wrinkled physiognomy Pamela be
held all of the wisdom and peace of all time.
The woman's watery, bloodshot eyes seemed

to say, "Take it easy, child . . . take it easy."
With all of the kindness and consideration
of her seventeen years, Pam purchased one j
bunch of violets from the ancient woman, and
started down the street.
However, the old woman fingered the dime
in her bony hand and mumbled something
that sounded like, "Cheapskate!"
Ahead of Pamela loomed up out of the fog
the dark forms of trees, and she decided to
rest in the deserted park for a while. Settling
herself on the clammy seat of the bench, Pam
crushed the little bunch of violets to her face.
The pungent, heady odor of the little fleurs
brought back untold memories.
Large, salt tears welled in her lovely eyes
and rolled down her peach-like cheeks . . .
making a wet, sodden mass of her mink coat.
Chills began to shoot up and down her spine,
as Pamela thought to herself:
"Wolfgang used to buy me violets . . . ah,
those days in the Alps with Wolf . . . wonder- ;
ful, carefree, ecstatic days. And the nights ... I
Wolf and I under the blanket of millions of
stars . . . the orchestra playing the 'Hut-Sut
Song,' . . . pink champagne and seguins . . . j
that roaring fire in the old Inn. . . . Ah Wolf!"
Pamela was lost in a hazy rut of reminis
cence. Suddenly out of the fog appeared a
black-cloaked figure with something gleaming
in his hand. He padded toward Pam on cat
like feet, and suddenly she jumped up and |
was utterly terrified. To run for it or not, what
would she do? There was no one nearby for
it was very late ... no one to help her . . . I
no one.
The figure suddenly growled threateningly,
and with a terrific lunge, grabbed the helpless
girl and pinioned her arms to her sides.
Pam tried to scream but found she was par
alyzed with fear. She struggled but could not
weaken the steely grip of her assailant.
