"QUIETA NON MOVERE"
or
Someone Should Tell The Child
Chaste Muse, who other genius inspires,
Pray give me now your insight true,
That I may see what here transpires,
When soldiers part as they may do.
The "rightful" studes now fill the libe,
(They should be here, why can't we see them?) |
Now, now, poor wit, take back your gibe,
For this is not the Mausoleum.
The tender grass that once lay dead
'Neath G.I. shoe and G.I. butt,
Now reacheth almost to the head
For who can pay to have it cut?

The many thousand bucks a day
That once was paid to keep us here,
Now is gone, and none will pay
To take the Quad back from the deer.
And oh! the ratio is low,
Why women did outnumber men!
So the girls are at the U. 5.0.,
Safe again at 1 to 10.
Departed co-eds once woke screaming,
But not as thought dear Poeticus,
For awful truth is that their dreaming,
Was stunted by the lack of us.
Recalls with joy the khaki hero,
On foreign shore now put to die.
The contempt in the REDIT VIRGO;
The battle fought to rate a "Hi"?
Pfc. Anti-Poeticus. i
