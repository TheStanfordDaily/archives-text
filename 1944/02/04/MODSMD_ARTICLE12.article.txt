JACK LONDON—Now playing at the Stanford Theater.
Michael O Shea plays the title role in the Samuel Bronston production,
"Jack London, with Susan Hayward in the role of Charmian London. The
film is biographical, based on the career of Jack London, liberal novelist,
adventurer, and war correspondent of a couple of generations ago.
The story begins with London as an oyster pirate in San Francisco and
then follows his tumultous career on seal expeditions to the Bering Straits.
London s first popular writing comes as a result of his experiences in the
Yukon Gold Rush. Back in San Francisco he meets and marries stunning
Susan Hayward. The last scenes ol the picture are of the Russo-Japanese
war, with a lot of propaganda thrown in.
O Shea fails to make a convincing London while Susan Hayward is fine
as his wife. There's a large supporting cast headed by Fiank Craven and
Harry Davenport. "Jack London" is at times lusty, brawling, and a bit
risque, but somehow the whole thing just doesn't seem real.
The has-beens get a chance in the second film, with Frank Fay, Bonnie
Baker, Billy Gilbert, and others appearing in the Monogram production,
"Spotlight Scandals." Henry King and Herb Miller (Glen's brother) are also
seen with their orchestras. The plot is as thin as one of your good Cali
fornia steaks and everybody tries but nobody succeeds in being funny. A
typical Monogram picture.
The Mayfield has one of those pictures that we'll never forget—Hun™
plirey Bogart in "The Maltese Falson." It is one of the best mystery-dram;.?
of recent years and is really a grand evening's entertainment.—Bower
