# Fagan Returns After Two-Quarter Absence
## 
### HERNADETTE GIANNINI 
On the wall of the Daily Shack is pasted a steadily growing list of prom
inent members of the Daily staff; it is boldly titled "The following people
have flunked Professor Fagan's Econ. 1." To this bit of Daily lore we want
to append a litle background about one of the professors who keeps Stan
ford students daring to brave the wiles of Economics 1, demon of lower-

division requirements.
Elmer D. Fagan, professor of eco
nomics, is again instructing his Stan
ford classes this winter after an ab
sence of two quarters. In addition to
the regular fare of Econ 1, are par
ticular facts and anecdotes concern
ing his subject, derived in part from
his war-time experience as consult
ing expert for the Treasury Depart
ment.
With Treasury '42-'4.'5
'"I am glad I was able to do some
work at this time when so many men
are serving," said Professor Fagan.

"This time" being principally dur
ing the academic year 1942-43.
Professor Fagan says that his rec
ommendations for the improvement
Â©112 Treasury policy were based pri
marily upon the English Economist
Keynes' proposal for an income tax
involving compulsory savings and
collection at the source.
"In spite of the fact that I served
with the Treasury, I am highly criti
cal of recent and contemporary
Treasury policy," said Professor Fa
gan. In his opinion personal net in
come taxation should be much
heavier, compulsory savings should
be adopted, and income tax forms
simplified. He has offered specific
recommendations to the Treasury for
attainment of these objectives.
Personal History
Born in Kansas, of parents from
the South, Professor Fagan spent his
undergraduate years at the Univer
sity of Oklahoma. "I would not have
spent them otherwise," he says, re
calling the many colorful people who
were there. "Masters of the humor
of exaggeration," he says, who knew
how to spin a real yarn at the light
est provocation.
"A number of my best friends were
the members of the English depart
ment of the University of Oklahoma
who came to hear the tales spun by
the boys of the Will Rogers type in
my fraternity."
This combination of friendship
with the English faculty and a liking
for the subject matter of economics
appear to have influenced Professor
Fagan's choice of career. He received
his Ph.D. at Harvard in 1926 and
came to Stanford from USC in 1928.
