# New German Grammar Is Now Being Used
## 
### 
Dr. Bayard Quincy Morgan, executive head of the Germanic Languages
Department, and Friedrich W. Strothmann, professor German have written
a new grammar book, "Reading German," which is now in use in second
year German classes here at Stanford.
''This new book," Dr. Morgan has said, "is a complete departure from

second year texts which we have
used up to now. It has a mature
style with a restricted vocabulary so
that it prepares the student for
serious reading. It also helps to
clarify the difficult German syntax
which combines the verb forms and
sentence meanings."
The new grammar book is a re
sult of a survey made several years
ago by Dr. Morgan for the Carnegie
Corporation. The survey was com
piled in a "German Frequency Word
Book," and later, Dr. Morgan
a beginning German grammar boorfl
based on the survey which has been
used as a textbook in first-year
classes at Stanford for some time.
The primer contains the first one
thousand words of the frequency
survey.
"Reading German," the new text,
improves on the words in the first
book and gives the student oppor
tunity to become familiar with the
syntax without being burdened with
extra vocabulary. The lessons are in
the form of popular science stories.
