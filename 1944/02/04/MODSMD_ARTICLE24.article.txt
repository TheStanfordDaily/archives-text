# Farm Gas Station Announces Hours
## 
### 
Gasoline sales will be made to
students and faculty from 9 until
at the Campus Service Station
'.nd from 1 to 5:30 at the Stadium
Service Station. The reason for this
is to spread out the quota of gaso
~.ine to handle as many customers as
possible.
The quota of the Stanford filling
stations is 6,200 gallons of gasoline a
month. Of this, the University ve
hicles have first call on it and may
be served with gasoline at any time
the stations are open.
Another reason for the staggering
of hours is the fact that there is not
enough manpower to keep both sta
tions operating full time for gas
sales. The service stations will be
open from 9 until 5:30 for lubrica
tion and other services.
