## ARMY STUDENT COUNCIL Board Probes Rumors; Colonel Eases Worries 
### 
►
Stanford's newiy elected Army
■ Student Council moved further
j ahead in its work as liaison agency
1 between military headquarters, fac
-1 ulty, and ASTP men this week after
lengthy sessions, one of them with
J Col. John R. Eden, post commandant,
I and Maj. Edward C. Andersen, spe
cial service officer. Included in the
Council's findings were at least par
| (ial answers to most of the major
j questions involving army students
! here.
Colonel Eden, answering questions
| of the Council concerning recent ad
| ditional reports that ASTP would
! close, told members that no further
! official notice has been issued since
the bulletin released slightly over a
month ago by Secretary of War
Stimson. The program will continue,
| subject to necessities of supply and
! demand in the Army for technicians,
j according to that last statement.
Rumor Quashed
Another rumor which held that
men graduating from ASTP with
| rank above the grade of private
would be demoted on reporting for
their new assignment with troops
i was also dispelled by the colonel.
According to Colonel Eden, the story
apparently originated as a result of
misinterpretation of a War Depart
ment order issued recently. The di
rective called for reduction in grade
j of men holding technician's ratings
after they no longer were doing the
work which had earned them the
I rank. The order does not affect tech
nicians while they are in the ASTP.
Election of Pfc. Jack Pickering, Co.
G. as chairman of the grievance com
j mittee named to try violators in the
optional examination honor system
I approved last week was also an
nounced by the Council. ASTP men
suspected of cheating in examina
tions where the honor system has
been voted will be reported to Pick
ering, who will conduct an investiga
tion to determine whether the al
leged violator is to be brought be
fore the Honor Court's investigating
| board.
Lights for Encina
Attempts to install efficient light
ing facilities in Encina Hall are pro
ceeding as rapidly as possible, ac
cording to Colonel Eden. Results of
a lighting survey conducted by army
engineers have already been sub
mitted to higher headquarters but
require additional approval before
work may proceed. Under the plan
being considered, the Army, rather
than the University, will bear the
cost of installation.
Present lighting conditions in En
cina, which in many cases give only
| four to six candlepower instead of
j Llie required 20 candlepower mini
j mum, have prevented use of the hall
I for night study quarters.
j Rules Clarified
Clarification of the ruling forbid
ding wearing of dark green garrison
caps was given Council members by
Colonel Eden. While the present or-
I der prohibits wearing of the hat
j while off the campus, it allows them
1 to be worn on the campus, according
to Colonel Eden.
