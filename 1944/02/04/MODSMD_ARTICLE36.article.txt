### ARTHUR SHAPIRO 
It seems this writer took a step in
a rough direction when he placed
himself on the Co. I basketball team's
band w r agon. It's a fine band wagon,
but th§ road is rocky, especially in
front of Brannei' Hall, Co. E's hang
out. I've been practically assaulted
by a group of commandos from the
fortress of Engineering, extolling the
virtues of Frier, Anderson et al. Per
haps the boys from Co. E are that
£ood; we'll have to wait until Feb.
28 before anything can be settled
(Co. E meets Co. I) besides the at
mospheric conditions.
Volleyball Turnout
Co. K and Co. C managed to dig
up six men each last Tuesday, but.
five other games were canceled when
the squads failed to appear. The
Asiatic language students of K won
easily, 21-8 and 21-5, What hap
pened to the other contestants and
the other teams is a mystery to all
concerned. The men of Co. I, led by
Jumpin' Joe Szczykno, did appear
hut found no opposition.

This litle acolade almost went for
| gotten. Some of the finest jobs be
ing turned in around Stanford are
the work of the referees in the bas
ketball tournament. No pay, no ac
claim and no publicity—not too much
of a reward for a full night's work.
You see the same faces at all
games, tootin' their whistles, ges
turing, running up and down the
court.
