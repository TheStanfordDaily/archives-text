# Bagdad Escape Rivals 'Arabian Nights' Saga
## 
### 
If a 20th century author were undertaking a 20th century edition of
"The Arabian Nights,'' he'd certainly include as one of his most thrilling
chapters the story of Johnny Savad.
Sayad—he appears on Uncle Sam's payroll as Pfc. John Sayad—is a !)-L
| Persian student currently assigned to Co. I at Stanford's AST unit.

His parents were american citi-
I zens, although Sayad was born in
Iran. And it is this Persian birth
place which is the keystone of this
story.
Denied Visa
Three years ago Sayad wanted to
come to the United States. But be
cause he was born in Iran he was
considered by the officials of that
country as a native Persian and was
denied the necessary exit papers.
Through a brother who was in
! this country, Sayad secured a Stale
Department opinion that he was an
American citizen and a passport for
his entry into the United States was
authorized. The Persian government,
however, still denied him the neces
sary visa to accompany his passport.
Sayad then decided to leave Iran
without an exit visa, paying a band
of Arabian smugglers seven pounds
to take him across the frontier into
neighboring Iraq.
I Arabian Disguise
Disguised as an Arabian tribesman,
Sayad boarded a Bagdad-bound ex
press. He escaped detection until he
was a few miles outside of Bagdad,
when he was picked up by police
whose suspicions were aroused when
they saw Sayad smoking luxury
brand British cigarettes while riding
in a cheap third-class compartment.
Unable to produce his passport and

visa, Sayad was imprisoned in Bag
dad for 33 days. A suspected spy, he
was beaten periodically in an effoit
to force admission of his guilt.
During his imprisonment the
smouldering discontent of Arabian
partisans flamed into a full-dress in
surrection which the British put
down with their troops and air
forces . At the time of one of these
aerial bombardments, a bomb hit the
Bagdad prison. In the subsequent
confusion Sayad escaped and fled to
the American consulate. Through
the aid of this country's consul,
passage from Basra, Iraq, to Bombay,
India was arranged on a British war
ship.
Contracts Malaria
Reaching Bombay, Sayad was hos
pitalized for malaria contracted on
his harrowing escape from Iran.
Weeks later he secured passage on a
Dutch boat, which docked at San
Francisco Aug. 16, 1941, after stops
in the Dutch East Indies, Australia,
and Hawaii.
Sayad, who speaks six languages,
enrolled in Northwestern University,
where he studied until his induction
into the Army in 1942.
The fraternity row house in which
he lives at Stanford University is a
far cry from a Bagdad cell. But
Johnny Sayad isn't complaining.

however, still denied him the neces
sary visa to accompany his passport.
Sayad then decided to leave Iran
without an exit visa, paying a band
of Arabian smugglers seven pounds
to take him across the frontier into
neighboring Iraq.
I Arabian Disguise
Disguised as an Arabian tribesman,
Sayad boarded a Bagdad-bound ex
press. He escaped detection until he
was a few miles outside of Bagdad,
when he was picked up by police
whose suspicions were aroused when
they saw Sayad smoking luxury
brand British cigarettes while riding
in a cheap third-class compartment.
Unable to produce his passport and

visa, Sayad was imprisoned in Bag
dad for 33 days. A suspected spy, he
was beaten periodically in an effoit
to force admission of his guilt.
During his imprisonment the
smouldering discontent of Arabian
partisans flamed into a full-dress in
surrection which the British put
down with their troops and air
forces . At the time of one of these
aerial bombardments, a bomb hit the
Bagdad prison. In the subsequent
confusion Sayad escaped and fled to
the American consulate. Through
the aid of this country's consul,
passage from Basra, Iraq, to Bombay,
India was arranged on a British war
ship.
Contracts Malaria
Reaching Bombay, Sayad was hos
pitalized for malaria contracted on
his harrowing escape from Iran.
Weeks later he secured passage on a
Dutch boat, which docked at San
Francisco Aug. 16, 1941, after stops
in the Dutch East Indies, Australia,
and Hawaii.
Sayad, who speaks six languages,
enrolled in Northwestern University,
where he studied until his induction
into the Army in 1942.
The fraternity row house in which
he lives at Stanford University is a
far cry from a Bagdad cell. But
Johnny Sayad isn't complaining.
If a 20th century author were undertaking a 20th century edition of
"The Arabian Nights,'' he'd certainly include as one of his most thrilling
chapters the story of Johnny Savad.
Sayad—he appears on Uncle Sam's payroll as Pfc. John Sayad—is a !)-L
| Persian student currently assigned to Co. I at Stanford's AST unit.

His parents were american citi-
I zens, although Sayad was born in
Iran. And it is this Persian birth
place which is the keystone of this
story.
Denied Visa
Three years ago Sayad wanted to
come to the United States. But be
cause he was born in Iran he was
considered by the officials of that
country as a native Persian and was
denied the necessary exit papers.
Through a brother who was in
! this country, Sayad secured a Stale
Department opinion that he was an
American citizen and a passport for
his entry into the United States was
authorized. The Persian government,
however, still denied him the neces
sary visa to accompany his passport.
