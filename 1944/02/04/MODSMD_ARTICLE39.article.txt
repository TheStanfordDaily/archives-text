## MURAL BASKETBALL Firehouse Defeats Gerona; Monroe Runs Over McKinley 
### FRANK CREEDE 
The Firemen managed to force one
last spurt of water from their hoses
to douse the hopes of Gerona A.C. in
the first of the 7:15 games. The Fire
house was slightly improved over the
atrocity of last Tuesday nighL. With
all apologies to the watchmaker, "we
"lon't know how they do it but they
do it."
By this win the Firehouse kept its
marred but unbeated record intact.
About seven minutes before the end
of the game the Firemen had a safe

lead of eight points, but they put in
substitutes and blew that lead in
the following minutes. They put the
number-one men back in, and were
saved by the whistle just as Gerona
was dashing down the court with
that scoring look in their eyes.
High-point man for the Firehouse
was Gene Smith with 15 buckets,
while Pete Lee took the honors for
Gerona with eight through the hoop.
In the second of the 7:15 games Fill
more won by default from Arthur.
We're not going to hazard a guess
as to why Arthur didn't show up, but
it just isn't fair to the rest of the boys
who come out loking for a game and
don't find one. Fillmore remained
unbeaten by this default.
Monroe swept clean its musty rec
ord by taking McKinley B to the
cleaners, 51-21, in the first of the 8:15
games. McKinley B is a very weak
team, however the high score shows
the game was a walkaway. Ed Luce
took top honors for up and coming
Monroe with 14 points, Supple and
Fess had 12 each. Tyler took Wash
ington 2(5-18 in a game which had
litle action or interest. Washington
is consistent in its inconsistency with
four losses.
