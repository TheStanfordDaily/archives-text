### ROGER CORMAN 
After two quarters of boosting the
Bruins, it's just about time we
umped off the UCLA bandwagon.
Week after week through the foot
ball season, we'd pick the Bruins to
win; and every week it'd be the same
old story â€” led by Andrews and
Roesch, the Uclans put up a gallant
fight, but couldn't quite make the
grade.
At the start of basketball, things
looked good around Westwood. and
we happily elevated UCLA to the
position of favorite in the league.
But it wasn't to be, for once more
the Bruins couldn't quite make the
grade.
All this is just a preliminary to
our stating that Cal should knock
over her brothers from the South
land Saturday at Berkeley, and put
the Southern Division title on ice.
The Bruins looked good at the be
ginning of the season, but have
slipped badly in the past few weeks,
and will need a miracle to take this
one.
Mural Basketball Defaulting
The defaulting in the intra-mural
basketball league has gotten to the
point where it can ruin the season.
The winning outfits are always there,
but the losing teams are giving up
without a struggle.
When the teams entered the league
they were expected to be able to put
five men on the court for all their
games, and if they don't intend to do
this, they should drop from the
schedule, and not make the league a
arce for all concerned.
