# Stanford Life in 'Roaring 20's Is Described by Farm Graduate

"Yes, it is interesting to see some
of the old Stanford life revived again
during this war," said Mrs. Jones,
secretary of the Political Science
Department. "In the good old days
of the '20's, cars were few and far
between, and not every house could
even boast of one. As a result, most
of the social life and fun enjoyed
by the Stanford men and co-eds was
had on the campus.
"An all-University dance was
held every Saturday night with stu
dent bands—not big name bands—
furnishing the music; both date
and dateless dances were popular.
Then," continued Mrs. Jones, "times
changed.
"Came the cars, and gone was this
close community life. Now, with the
war, it seems that entertainment is
again being more closely confined to
the campus."
Entered Stanford 1924
Mrs. Jones entered Stanford as a
freshman in 1924 as one of "the fa
mous 500." She graduated in 1928,
and received her Master's degree in
1929 while at the same time holding
a position as part-time secretary in
the Romanic Languages Department.
Mrs. Jones has been at Stanford
since that time and had a good op
portunity to watch Stanford grow
and change.
During Mrs. Jones' school days, a
streetcar instead of a bus ran from
here into town. "The men would
ride outside to avoid paying fares,
and the conductor would have to
stop to chase them off.
"Then the Stanford men would
set fire to a hay cock directly on
the tracks, and grease the tracks so
the brakes of the car wouldn't work
in time. Everyone next stood by to
watch the conductor get out and
push the trolley off and away from
the fire."
Attitude Unchanged
Mrs. Jones said that the general
attitude of college students then and
now toward studies and social life
has not actually altered; merely dif
ferent means of expression are used
according to the times.
"The Political Science Depart
ment," continued Mrs. Jones, "has
expanded greatly in size since my
first days here. I think this increased
interest is due to the increasing de
sirability of government jobs under
Civil Service."

of the '20's, cars were few and far
between, and not every house could
even boast of one. As a result, most
of the social life and fun enjoyed
by the Stanford men and co-eds was
had on the campus.
"An all-University dance was
held every Saturday night with stu
dent bands—not big name bands—
furnishing the music; both date
and dateless dances were popular.
Then," continued Mrs. Jones, "times
changed.
"Came the cars, and gone was this
close community life. Now, with the
war, it seems that entertainment is
again being more closely confined to
the campus."
Entered Stanford 1924
Mrs. Jones entered Stanford as a
freshman in 1924 as one of "the fa
mous 500." She graduated in 1928,
and received her Master's degree in
1929 while at the same time holding
a position as part-time secretary in
the Romanic Languages Department.
Mrs. Jones has been at Stanford
since that time and had a good op
portunity to watch Stanford grow
and change.
During Mrs. Jones' school days, a
streetcar instead of a bus ran from
here into town. "The men would
ride outside to avoid paying fares,
and the conductor would have to
stop to chase them off.
"Then the Stanford men would
set fire to a hay cock directly on
the tracks, and grease the tracks so
the brakes of the car wouldn't work
in time. Everyone next stood by to
watch the conductor get out and
push the trolley off and away from
the fire."
Attitude Unchanged
Mrs. Jones said that the general
attitude of college students then and
now toward studies and social life
has not actually altered; merely dif
ferent means of expression are used
according to the times.
"The Political Science Depart
ment," continued Mrs. Jones, "has
expanded greatly in size since my
first days here. I think this increased
interest is due to the increasing de
sirability of government jobs under
Civil Service."
