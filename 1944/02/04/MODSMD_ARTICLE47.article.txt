# Dr. H.F. Mark Lectures on X-Ray Investigation of Fibers
## 
### LIZA EBBERTS 
Dr. Hermann Franz Mark, internationally known physical chemist, lec
tured last night on "X-Ray Investigation of Fibers." He is adjunct pro
fessor of organic chemistry at the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn and ha:
done most of his work in the field of fibers
He divided molecular accumulations into three main divisions, rubbers

and fibers. Seventy years ago scien- "♦
, tists worked on the theory that these
three classifications were funda-
I mentally different substances. Today
iit has been proved that they are
merely different degrees of the same
: molecular structure.
Thus they are made synthetically
! by much the same process. The fun
damental requirements for producing
these materials are huge molecules in
i the form of long flexible chains.
The difference between unstretched
rubber and fiber is that these chains
are at random in rubber and parallel
'in fiber. When rubber is stretched
1 its chains beconve similar to fiber, but
immediately snap back. If the forces
j between the chains are strong
enough to hold the chain together
; when they are released, they assume
the classification of fiber.
X-ray revealed the geometric
-structure that makes synthetic fibers
at least three times as strong as nat- j
ural ones.
