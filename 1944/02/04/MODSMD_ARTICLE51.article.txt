# Driscoll Requests Students Be Calm

Students of Stanford University:
Sometime between 12 midnight and 4:30 this morning, a small group of
unknown individuals broke into the Stanford Union and stole the Stanford
Axe from its case. Naturally, we all have concluded that this theft was the
doing of a group from the University of California.
We are engaged in a War Bond sales contest with California, and the
Stanford-California rivalry has been reborn. California suggested that the
Axe be put up as a trophy for the War Bond contest, in lieu of the Annual
Big Game, and it is natural that our refusal aroused strong feeling among
the California student body.
However, before we jump to the conclusion that Cal men stole the Axe,
and before we plan any retaliatory raids to regain it, we must look at this
theft in the light of common sense.
In the first place it is not certain who did take the Axe. Reports that a
group of high school students were involved are being investigated. To raid
California and then find the Axe in the hands of another group would cer
tainly disgrace Stanford. We must take no action until the actual holders
of the Axe are known.
In the second place, the University of California and the A.S.U.C. offi
cers have assured us that, if the Axe is found in California hands, the
thieves will be punished and the Axe returned to us. The University has
enlisted the aid of the Berkeley police, and every effort is being made by
both universities to get to the bottom of this affair.
Any action on the part of Stanford students in an effort to recover the
Axe would result only in lowering ourselves to the level of these vandals,
and would bring disgrace to the Stanford name.
Think twice before you get carried away by the high feelings occasioned
by this theft We can best show our and our sportsmanship by self
control and restraint
Sincerely,
