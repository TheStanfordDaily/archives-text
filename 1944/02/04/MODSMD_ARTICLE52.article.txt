# Who Done It?

An Editorial
So the Poor Li'l Injun got his Axe stole. And the Big Bad
Bear was the one that stole it, too. Of course he was. Well, well,
isn't that just too bad now.
Yes, and it will be too bad if the Stanford student body wastes
its energies and makes a fool of itself screaming "Look what they
done to us, ain't it awful?"
Because in the first place, did Cal or even a few out-of-gear
Cal students do it? Frankly we don't know. And it is not even
our business to find out, let alone to run around making accusa
tions we can't prove.
The theft of the Axe is in the hands of the police, and both
Palo Alto and Berkeley police are busy on the job. They have
fingerprints and blood-stains and good detective technique to go
on. They must ultimately discover "Who Done It"and return
the Axe to Stanford.
Think, meanwhile, what fools we can make of ourselves ac
cusing Cal should it turn out to be some half-baked high school
kid or even some Stanfordite with a misguided sense of humor.
And even supposing it to be a Cal student or a group of
them, it is certain that they are no more than a misguided, ex
tremely small minority. California, as a student body, is certainly
not fool enough to be interested in sneaking down here in the
dead of night to steal that Axe out of its hallowed trophy case.
And to even suppose Cal capable of such is not only foolish but
more than slightly egotistical.
All right then, since this is full of "DON'TS," what should we
DO? Well, instead of making ourselves look ridiculous by howl
ing "Oh you nasty mans" why don't we set about making them
look ridiculous by really licking them in this bond contest which
has brought up the whole Axe question?
This is another one of those jobs that it would be a lot easier
to do big, brave, and loud with accusations, raids, and histrionics.
But it is also another one of those that can be done right only by
the most ordinary, mundane, everyday process. By going out
and buying those one or two more bonds that you are quite sure
you can't afford, but if you look again and think about it, maybe
you can.—Nancy Tilden.

kid or even some Stanfordite with a misguided sense of humor.
And even supposing it to be a Cal student or a group of
them, it is certain that they are no more than a misguided, ex
tremely small minority. California, as a student body, is certainly
not fool enough to be interested in sneaking down here in the
dead of night to steal that Axe out of its hallowed trophy case.
And to even suppose Cal capable of such is not only foolish but
more than slightly egotistical.
All right then, since this is full of "DON'TS," what should we
DO? Well, instead of making ourselves look ridiculous by howl
ing "Oh you nasty mans" why don't we set about making them
look ridiculous by really licking them in this bond contest which
has brought up the whole Axe question?
This is another one of those jobs that it would be a lot easier
to do big, brave, and loud with accusations, raids, and histrionics.
But it is also another one of those that can be done right only by
the most ordinary, mundane, everyday process. By going out
and buying those one or two more bonds that you are quite sure
you can't afford, but if you look again and think about it, maybe
you can.—Nancy Tilden.
