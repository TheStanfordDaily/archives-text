# Ventura Nets Over $2,500
## 
### 
Ventura's auction was held in two
sections, one last night and one this
noon. Last night's total was $2,400
but the final amount was reached
this noon when the bidding was
topped by the $116.50 offered for a
date with Bill Conley, Lagunita
hasher.
Articles sold last night included
bobby pins which went for $200, a

shoe stamp for $300, and a box of
raisins for $55.
These auctions followed the plan
started earlier this week by Roble
and Lagunita at their auctions. The
articles were auctioned by accumu
lative bidding and each person who
placed a bid pledged herself to buy
an equal amount in war bonds and
stamps, whether or not she was suc
cessful in getting the article.
