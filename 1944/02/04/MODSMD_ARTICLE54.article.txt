# Police Hunt Stolen Axe
## 
### 
The Stanford Axe, for 45 years the
symbol of the Stanford-Cal rivalry,
was stolen between 12 and 4:30 this
morning from its case in the Cellar
of the Union. Although the thieves
have not yet been found, Berkeley
and Stanford police are co-operat
ing in an attempt to restore the Axe
to its traditional resting place.
The thieves apparently entered the
Cellar through the door by the bar
ber shop which is left open all night
for the convenience of employees
who live upstairs. They tore down
the iron gates locking off the Cellar
store and broke in.
Removing the top from the glass
case, they unscrewed the Axe from
its standard.
Police found fingerprints and
bloodstains on the case.
