mmm wp———wmm
A 1927 Buick passenger car will be
auctioned to the highest bidder in
War Bonds tonight at the Cardinal
dance in the Women's Clubhouse,
announced Barbara White, chairman.
This Cardinal dance will feature
the music of Claude Wilson's band,
and at the same time, from 8 to 11:30,
in the Nitery the War Board will
hold a taxi dance with 15 beautiful
girls from Roble who will dance
with each purchaser of a 25-cent
War Stamp.
Band Down Row
The Stanford Band will march
down the Row at 7:30 tonight to
collect students for these two dances.
This is our last big effort to buy
enough War Bonds to beat Cal, so
everyone should try to come some
time during the evening to both
dances.
Ric Supple will be the autctioneer
at the Cardinal dance. Besides the
Buick, he will offer for sale: a pair
of Nylon stockings, donated by Cheri
Martin, and an expensive bottle of
cologne, given by Roos Bros.
Roble Taxi Dancers
At the Nitery Dance, the Roble
taxi dancers will dance to "juke box"
music, while members of the War
Board, hostesses for the evening, will
sell War Stamps and Bonds to help
beat Cal.
Claude Wilson's jive band is well
worth the 25-cent War Stamp admis
sion charged to enter the Cardinal
dance. The band features the trom
bonist, Tommy Farr, who used to
play with Woody Herman's and Tony
Pastor's orchestras.
Food at Nitery
Food will be served at the Nitery
where there is also an admission
charge of a 25-cent War Stamp.
"Everyone should come to these
dances and buy Stamps and Bonds,"
urged Carol Hurwitz, War Board co
ordinator. "Even if you have bought
a bond or two in this drive, you can
always afford to buy more, especially
at a dance where you're having a
good time. So bring your money and
buy some bonds."
