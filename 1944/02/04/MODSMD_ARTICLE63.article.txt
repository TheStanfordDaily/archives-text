Roble Hall began the campus War
Bond Drive Sunday night with an
auction that brought in a grand total
of $6,940.55, pledged to the purchase
of bonds and stamps.
Auctioneers Ann Wendling and
Marianne Goldman began the bid
ding at 10:30 in the lobby, offering
such prizes as nylon stockings, din
ners at Dinah's and L'Omelette's, a
bicycle, a shoe ration stamp, and a
date with Dick Driscoll.
The largest amount pledged for a
single item was $2,038.75 for a Ver
million Stanford blanket, which sold
to the highest bid of $800. This blan
ket was made from the wool of the
sheep that roamed the Stanford Quad
before the students did.
Presented to each of the boys at
Encina by Mrs. Stanford, these blan
kets are now a rarity about the cam
pus. Another relic of the past was
auctioned when a picture of the
Stanford rough of the 1890's was
sold for $135.
