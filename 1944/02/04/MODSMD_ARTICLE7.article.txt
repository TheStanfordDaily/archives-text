# Union Stages Bond Auction
## 
### 
Doing their part in' aiding the j
Stanford slogan. "Buy Bonds and |
Beat Bears." Union Residences held ,
their auction last night at 9 in the j
main lobby of Union. Betty McCul- J
lough and Fran Jennings acted as
auctioneers for the evening.
The articles were auctioned by
accumulative bidding. Each person
placing a bid pledged herself to buy
the amount in war bonds and stamps
equivalent to her bid, whether or
not she was successful in getting the 1
article. This has been the basis of '
the previous auctions on campus this !
week.
A date with Union's head hasher, J
Carl Mason, was auctioned. Among j
other things the girls bid on a'war '
alarm clock, a hand-knitted sweater, j
a pair of socks knitted by a Union :
girl, two cakes, a new pair of nylon !
hose and jewelry. Results of the [
auction have not come in yet.
