WHEN "POETICUS" wrote a poem entitled
"Redit Virgo" and it appeared in the Daily-
Campus Opinion column, little did he realize
and little did Editorial Board realize he would
start a siege of letters and "anti-Poeticus" poems
pouring into the Shack.
"Poeticus" is a member of the AST unit at
Stanford. He probably sat down at his type
writer one day last week, meditated, and feel
ing in a slightly satirical mood, tapped out
what he considered to be some funny lines
in regard to the Army and himself at Stanford.
Unfortunately, some evidently read his con
tribution without remembering that a sense of
humor is a good thing to carry around at all
times.
One of the answers to "Poeticus" came in
the form of a poem entitled "Quieta Non Mo
vere," and because it was written in the same
mood and spirit as "Redit Virgo," it is pub
lished in today's Campus Opinion.
Some of the other answers received were
not along those lines, however. One of them
bore phrases such as "you sheltered idiots"
and "many of us would have gone to Siwash."
In many respects this writer knew what he
was talking about. Many Stanford students
could well be called sheltered idiots and it's
a known fact that many Army students would
have preferred Siwash.

But the point remains: "Poeticus" was just
an Army student trying to add satirical humor
to Campus Opinion.
