# STANFORD WINS BOND CONTEST; AXE RETURNED TO TROPHY CASE
## Farm Sales Total $186,000 For All-Stanford Bomber; Ratio Overwhelms Cal 
### 
Unofficially Stanford University lias won the bond-buying contest with
the state institution at Berkeley, but because student officials at that
school did not abide by the rules of the contest, the Farm victory lacks the
sanction of loser-recognition. By contest rules, the winning school was to
receive the banner of the losing school from the hands of its student body

president. "
Saturday evening the total sales
for Stanford reached the staggering
figure of $186,000. The Bears would
have had to have sold $343,500, on the
basis of population ratio, in order to
have won the contest. Failing,
Berkeley was $153,000 short of win

Cal Prexy Disappears
Upon learning of the total sales
of the Farm, Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president, telephoned the Berkeley
campus in an effort to leam the total
sales of the Bear, and to find out if
he should prepare to take the Stall
ford Banner to the Military Ball be
ing held Saturday night on the Cal
campus.

A phone call to Dick Driscoll
from Cal Student President Natalie
Burdick late last night revealed
Farm unofficial approximate fig
ures to be correct and stated that
iVliss Burdick would arrange to
make presentation of a Blue and
Gold Banner to Stanford this week.

The only answer Driscoll got on his
call was that Natalie Burdick. presi
dent of the associated students at
Cal, had "gone to a show." No one in
authority was available, other stu
dent officials were "away."
Banner Missing
Later Saturday evening Luana
Forkner, Stanford's vice-president,
continued the struggle while Driscoll
fulfilled a speaking engagement at
the Stanford Peninsula Club in San
Mateo. Miss Forkner finally learned
that the approximate Cal sales were
$190,900.
By this time it was obvious that
Stanford had won, but that presen
tation of the Cal banner by Miss
Burdick to Driscoll at the Frosh
Fling would not take place.
Returning from San Mateo, Dris-
