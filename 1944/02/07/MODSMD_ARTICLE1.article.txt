# STANFORD WINS BOND CONTEST; AXE RETURNED TO TROPHY CASE
## Farm Sales Total $186,000 For All-Stanford Bomber; Ratio Overwhelms Cal 
### 
Unofficially Stanford University lias won the bond-buying contest with
the state institution at Berkeley, but because student officials at that
school did not abide by the rules of the contest, the Farm victory lacks the
sanction of loser-recognition. By contest rules, the winning school was to
receive the banner of the losing school from the hands of its student body

president. "
Saturday evening the total sales
for Stanford reached the staggering
figure of $186,000. The Bears would
have had to have sold $343,500, on the
basis of population ratio, in order to
have won the contest. Failing,
Berkeley was $153,000 short of win
ning over the Li'l Indian.
Cal Prexy Disappears
Upon learning of the total sales
of the Farm, Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president, telephoned the Berkeley
campus in an effort to leam the total
sales of the Bear, and to find out if
he should prepare to take the Stall
ford Banner to the Military Ball be
ing held Saturday night on the Cal
campus.

A phone call to Dick Driscoll
from Cal Student President Natalie
Burdick late last night revealed
Farm unofficial approximate fig
ures to be correct and stated that
iVliss Burdick would arrange to
make presentation of a Blue and
Gold Banner to Stanford this week.

The only answer Driscoll got on his
call was that Natalie Burdick. presi
dent of the associated students at
Cal, had "gone to a show." No one in
authority was available, other stu
dent officials were "away."

Later Saturday evening Luana
Forkner, Stanford's vice-president,
continued the struggle while Driscoll
fulfilled a speaking engagement at
the Stanford Peninsula Club in San
Mateo. Miss Forkner finally learned
that the approximate Cal sales were
$190,900.
By this time it was obvious that
Stanford had won, but that presen
tation of the Cal banner by Miss
Burdick to Driscoll at the Frosh
Fling would not take place.
Returning from San Mateo, Dris-
j coll went to the Frosh dance, ex- !
plained the situation. Then he tried t
again to reach Miss Burdick.
"Solly, Cal's Tired"
At 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning he
reached Miss Burdick. The explana
tion was that everyone at Cal was
tired out by the day of selling and
counting results, the auditor's office
of the school refused to release fig
ures until the "books" balanced—
which they didn't—and consequently,
it was decided to relax at a movie.
Regardless of pennants or banners,
however, Stanford won. And regard
less of contests the two schools piled
up a collective total of $376,000 in
War Bonds and Stamps. Represent
ing a real contribution to the Fourth
War Loan Drive and the government
fight against inflation, this money
will send two B-25 medium bombers
out against the common enemy, with
a litle extra ammunition on the side.
In total sales Stanford University [
sold more than the present available
figures from Cal indicate. Actually
the Farm sold $216,000 in War Bonds
and Stamps, $30,000 of which were
Series "G" Bonds, not applicable to j
the contest.

plained the situation. Then he tried t
again to reach Miss Burdick.
"Solly, Cal's Tired"
At 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning he
reached Miss Burdick. The explana
tion was that everyone at Cal was
tired out by the day of selling and
counting results, the auditor's office
of the school refused to release fig
ures until the "books" balanced—
which they didn't—and consequently,
it was decided to relax at a movie.
Regardless of pennants or banners,
however, Stanford won. And regard
less of contests the two schools piled
up a collective total of $376,000 in
War Bonds and Stamps. Represent
ing a real contribution to the Fourth
War Loan Drive and the government
fight against inflation, this money
will send two B-25 medium bombers
out against the common enemy, with
a litle extra ammunition on the side.
In total sales Stanford University [
sold more than the present available
figures from Cal indicate. Actually
the Farm sold $216,000 in War Bonds
and Stamps, $30,000 of which were
Series "G" Bonds, not applicable to j
the contest.
Unofficially Stanford University lias won the bond-buying contest with
the state institution at Berkeley, but because student officials at that
school did not abide by the rules of the contest, the Farm victory lacks the
sanction of loser-recognition. By contest rules, the winning school was to
receive the banner of the losing school from the hands of its student body

president. "
Saturday evening the total sales
for Stanford reached the staggering
figure of $186,000. The Bears would
have had to have sold $343,500, on the
basis of population ratio, in order to
have won the contest. Failing,
Berkeley was $153,000 short of win
ning over the Li'l Indian.
Cal Prexy Disappears
Upon learning of the total sales
of the Farm, Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U.
president, telephoned the Berkeley
campus in an effort to leam the total
sales of the Bear, and to find out if
he should prepare to take the Stall
ford Banner to the Military Ball be
ing held Saturday night on the Cal
campus.

A phone call to Dick Driscoll
from Cal Student President Natalie
Burdick late last night revealed
Farm unofficial approximate fig
ures to be correct and stated that
iVliss Burdick would arrange to
make presentation of a Blue and
Gold Banner to Stanford this week.

The only answer Driscoll got on his
call was that Natalie Burdick. presi
dent of the associated students at
Cal, had "gone to a show." No one in
authority was available, other stu
dent officials were "away."
Banner Missing
Later Saturday evening Luana
Forkner, Stanford's vice-president,
continued the struggle while Driscoll
fulfilled a speaking engagement at
the Stanford Peninsula Club in San
Mateo. Miss Forkner finally learned
that the approximate Cal sales were
$190,900.
By this time it was obvious that
Stanford had won, but that presen
tation of the Cal banner by Miss
Burdick to Driscoll at the Frosh
Fling would not take place.
