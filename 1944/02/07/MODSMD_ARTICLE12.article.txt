A GRAND TOTAL of $375,000 plus went into
War Bonds last week with Cal and Stanford
acting as collecting agencies. In some minds
the contest was the main item; but to most, add
ing a few more bombers to U.S. air strength
was the main motive.
A letter came into the Daily Shack criticizing
the leaders of Cal and Stanford for holding a
War Bond contest. The writer's main point
seemed to be that buying bonds should be an
inspiration in itself; arousal of the old Cal-Stan
ford rivalry to forward bond buying is cheap
*
and is an indication that Americans are losing
their intellectual dignity.
Actually, there is something in what he said.
It is too bad that Americans have to be falsely
inspired. It's too bad that we have to bid for
nylons and cars, and have glamorous movie
stars around in order to work up enough enthu
siasm to do as dull a thing as buy bonds.
BUT—it so happens that our whole culture
is built up in this very way. Everything we do
is done on a competitive basis. What fun would
there be in a football game if there were no
feeling of rivalry between schools? Theoreti
cally, the playing of the game should be
enough, but we've got to have rivalry.
Any one of us could go out and sell bonds,
theoretically, because theoretically, everyone
should WANT to spend their money on bonds.
But we have movie stars go on bond selling
campaigns because they add color to a bond
campaign and also bring in much more money
than you or I.
And so really it is too bad that Cal and Stan
ford had to have a bond selling contest in order
to give out $375,000 to Uncle Sam. But the
money did roll in, and right now that's what
counts—not our intellectual dignity. We can
ge that back later when we have time.
