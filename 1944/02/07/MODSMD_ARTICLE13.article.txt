# Things Are Tired All Over
## 
### 
ALMOST two weeks ago, Natalie Burdick, in the
name of the students at the University of Cali
fornia at Berkeley, challenged the Associated
Students of Stanford University to a bond
buying contest. Purpose of the contest was to
support the Fourth War Loan Drive; incidental
to the contest was the traditional rivalry of the
two schools.
In customary good faith, Stanford accepted

the challenge, and agreed to a set of rules to
govern the conduct and outcome of the Contest.
Among the rules were statements fixing the
population ratio at 2.4 to 1, and an open clause
into which would be inserted later the rule for
an award to be made the winning school.
After the first day of the contest, when Stan
ford had sold $38,000 in War Bonds and Stamps,
Cal $5,050, Cal student officials reguested a
change in the population ratio rules. A "mis
take" had been made, they said, in counting
their population. Please, they said, change it
to 1.85 to 1, instead of 2.4 to 1. Stanford
obligingly made the change.
Stanford won the contest, under the rules of
the contest, but Saturday night, Cal student
officials were "too tired" to come to the Farm to
present the Cal Banner, as they had agreed to
do should they lose. Miss Burdick, as a matter
of fact, was so tired that she didn't get home
until 1:30 a.m. Sunday morning — from the
movie.
Beside the fact that both schools together sold
$376,000 in War Bonds and Stamps, which was
the purpose of the contest, these other facts are
relatively trivial. But to the Farm students, such
a relaxed interpretation of contest rules hag
proved disappointing.
But being a cheerful Li'l Indian, he hereby
extends an invitation to Cal student officials to
recover from their "fatigue" at the Farm's rest
homes.—Dave Davis
