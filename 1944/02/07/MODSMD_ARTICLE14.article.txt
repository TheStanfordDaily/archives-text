### JEAN LEVINSON 
You there, contentedly sipping your coffee
in that dim, warm booth in the Cellar .... great
going! You there, gabbing with your buddies on
the English corner .... swell spirit! You there,
reading your Daily in the Reserve Book room
.... pat yourself on the back!
Listen, glamour-pan, you really look stunning
in that moth-eaten sweater you're sporting, be
cause like everyone else you're also sporting a
happy glow and a proud twinkle in your eyes.
And by the way Mr. Lady Killer. That fun
money you contributed, and those beers you
gave up were tough to do, sure they were tough.
But you feel pretty good about it, don't you Don
Juan, now don't you?
Congratulations to all of you grand, righteous,
upstanding, good-living, clean-cut, spirited, co
operative, super fellows and gals who helped
show that lethargical institution who really has
the punch and spirit in this Fourth War Loan
Drive!
And as for the University of Sleepy Hollow
. . . . well.
It seems that those pseudo-students were just
too sleepy to buy bonds and stamps; and prexy
Burdick was too tired of it all to inform our
energetic Driscoll of the returns. The insomniac
Injuns, on the other hand, went "all out" (as
we say it in reporting circles) for this contest
and left the Bear singed and neurotic in his
trundle beddie.
Congratulations are in order, also to those big
operators of Cardinals and War Board, headed
by White and Hurwitz. These gals and their
committees gave up time and energy (as we
say in literary circles) to make a success of
Bond Week, and they really succeeded in a
big way .... what with rallies, entertainment,
dances, and hubba-hubba stuff.
Here's for more functions of this kind at the
Nitery in the future. Everyone got together and
had one swell time, and this column is of the
opinion that weekly get-togethers would do
much to knit the Stanford students closer to
gether in a bond of friendship and goodwill
. . . . amen.
And how's about having a weekly dance at
the poor man's Stork Club with local talent for
entertainment .... such as the personality kid
with the iron vocal chords —Nan (ask me to sing :
another) Tillson.
Congrats again, and how about writing in with
suggestions for more get-togethers at the Nitery. I

operative, super fellows and gals who helped
show that lethargical institution who really has
the punch and spirit in this Fourth War Loan
Drive!
And as for the University of Sleepy Hollow
. . . . well.
It seems that those pseudo-students were just
too sleepy to buy bonds and stamps; and prexy
Burdick was too tired of it all to inform our
energetic Driscoll of the returns. The insomniac
Injuns, on the other hand, went "all out" (as
we say it in reporting circles) for this contest
and left the Bear singed and neurotic in his
trundle beddie.
Congratulations are in order, also to those big
operators of Cardinals and War Board, headed
by White and Hurwitz. These gals and their
committees gave up time and energy (as we
say in literary circles) to make a success of
Bond Week, and they really succeeded in a
big way .... what with rallies, entertainment,
dances, and hubba-hubba stuff.
Here's for more functions of this kind at the
Nitery in the future. Everyone got together and
had one swell time, and this column is of the
opinion that weekly get-togethers would do
much to knit the Stanford students closer to
gether in a bond of friendship and goodwill
. . . . amen.
And how's about having a weekly dance at
the poor man's Stork Club with local talent for
entertainment .... such as the personality kid
with the iron vocal chords —Nan (ask me to sing :
another) Tillson.
Congrats again, and how about writing in with
suggestions for more get-togethers at the Nitery. I
You there, contentedly sipping your coffee
in that dim, warm booth in the Cellar .... great
going! You there, gabbing with your buddies on
the English corner .... swell spirit! You there,
reading your Daily in the Reserve Book room
.... pat yourself on the back!
Listen, glamour-pan, you really look stunning
in that moth-eaten sweater you're sporting, be
cause like everyone else you're also sporting a
happy glow and a proud twinkle in your eyes.
And by the way Mr. Lady Killer. That fun
money you contributed, and those beers you
gave up were tough to do, sure they were tough.
But you feel pretty good about it, don't you Don
Juan, now don't you?
Congratulations to all of you grand, righteous,
upstanding, good-living, clean-cut, spirited, co
operative, super fellows and gals who helped
show that lethargical institution who really has
the punch and spirit in this Fourth War Loan
