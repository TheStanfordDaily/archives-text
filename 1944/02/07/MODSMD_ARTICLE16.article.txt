## Bears Defeat Bruins, 36-24, Capture Title 
### 
The University of California's bas
ketball team captured the Southern
Division championship of the Pacific
Coast Conference by defeating
UCLA, 3(>-24, in Berkeley Saturday
night. Turning what had been a
game into a rout, the Bears
surged ahead with five minutes left
to play in the game, and proceeded to
run all over the hapless Bruins until
the game ended.
The game was played before 5.000
fans in the Men's Gym at Berkeley.
The win gave the Bears their first
Southern Division title since 1939.
Scoring honors were taken by sub
stitute forward Steve Shult of Cali
fornia, who dumped in six field goals
and two free throws for a total of 14
points. The former Stanford men
played big parts in the Bear's vic
tory. These were George Jones, tall
center who controlled the back
boards for Cal all evening, and Jim
Higgins, who contributed some beau
tiful and timely field goals.
The Bruins led throughout the
first half, which ended with the score
17-15 in their favor. In the second
half, however, they succeeded in
scoring just one field goal, which
Dick West made from 30 feet out.
The Bears caught up with the Bruins
at 24-all with five minutes to go, and
from there on it was all California's
game.
The Bears end their 1944 season
next week in Los Angeles, where
they are scheduled to play USC next
Saturday. The Trojans were defeated
by the St. Mary's Preflight quintet
Saturday, 48-44, in a thriller which
wasn't decided until the last 56 sec
onds of play.
