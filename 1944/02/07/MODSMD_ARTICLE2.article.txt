# Quota Raised At Blood Bank
## 
### 
The quota for the Stanford Blood
Bank has been raised from 30 to 50
donors for the rest of the quarter, ac
cording to Chairmen Patty Patten
and John Ehrlich.
The next Blood Bank Day will be
Thursday, Feb. 17. Under the new
quota, 20 more army and civilian
students than have ever volunteered
before must sign up now to fill the
quota.
Signups will be continued all this
week in the War Board office. Stu
dents wishing to donate must weigh
110 pounds, have waited eight weeks
since their last donation, and if they
are under 21 must have a release slip
signed by both parents.

Two new appointment hours
have been added to handle the
larger number of student donors.
These new hours are 11 a.m. and
1 p.m.. and 10 donors may sign for
each hour. The old appointment
hours remain unchanged: 11:30,
11:40, 1:20. and 1:40. Transporta
tion will be furnished by the Red
Cross Motor Corps.

"There are two reasons for the
higher quota," Miss Patten said. "'The
National Red Cross is calling for
more blood plasma during 1944 than
they have in the previous years of
the war. Doctors on the front have
found that a wounded soldier may
need not one, but several pints of
blood, and cases are recorded in
I which a single soldier was given 30
| pints of blood to save his life.
"Secondly, on each Blood Bank
Day this quarter, more students have
volunteered to donate than could be
taken care of under the old quota.
| Under this nevv quota everyone on
j campus who wants to give blood will
I have a chance during the quarter."
