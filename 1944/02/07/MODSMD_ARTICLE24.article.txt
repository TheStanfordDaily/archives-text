# Great Battle of Bonds Rages Over Li'l Red Buick
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Probably the most patriotic gesture of last week's Bond Drive was the
contribution of a red 1927 Buick to the auction held at the Cardinal Dance !
last Friday night. Bought by the owners, Pat Pioberts, Mimi Koetod, and
Nancy Ganahl for $30 a year ago, the car brought a an ccumulated total of
$32,000 in bids Friday night.
The Chi Omegas, in an effort to save the car for Owner Ganahl, bid

$11,000, but the Delta Gamma house,
in combination with Monroe Hall,
led the bidding to a winning $12,500.
The following morning typical cam
pus scenes showed frenzied D.G.'s
and Monroe men attempting to raise
enough money to fill their pledge.
Hope Springs Eternal
Still hoping to win the car back by
default of the pledge of the other
two, the Chi O's led a money-raising
campaign themselves, raising the
largest single contribution of the
entire Bond Drive, $13,000. The car,
however, went to the Delta Gammas
and Monroe when they fulfilled their
pledge.
All, Nostalgia!
The owners who have hsfppily
boomed around the campus in their
car for over a year, spent a last nos
talgic afternoon driving slowly
around before they deposited their
beloved auto at the auctioneer's dis
posal.
Other patriotic attractions of the
Cardinals' dance were the contribu
tion of Claude Wilson's band (for
free!) and a pair of nylon hose for
auction by Cheri Martin. The stock
ings brought an accumulative total
of $9,850, ,and sold to high-bidder
Jane Bicknell.
