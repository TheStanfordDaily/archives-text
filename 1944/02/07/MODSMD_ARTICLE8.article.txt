# THE 						SAGA OF THE AXE OR 24 HOURS OF HELL
## 
### 
Friday morning at half-past four
A Union employee strolled by the door
Of the Stanford Cellar (popular place),
Let out a scream, fell flat on his face.
For The Axe had been jobbed
By thieves unknown,
The case had been smashed,
The culprits had flown.
He rallied his senses ....
The alarm was spread.
Enter the cops
And the search went ahead.
The campus, aroused,
Shouted long and loud,
"We want some Bear meat,"
"Revenge!" screamed the crowd
But next morning .... shucks.
The Axe was found
On Al's front porch
By a G.I. hound.
And the moral is
If a moral there be,
"Don't carve up the Bear
If you're near a Jaycee."
