# New Nazi Attack Smashed at Rome
## 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., ALGIERS (UP) —
American troops have smashed an
other counterattack below Runie and
regained 500 yards of their precious

beachhead but the Germans now
have marshalled more than five di
visions against the landing forces and
an all-out effort to drive them back
into the sea appeared in the making
xonight.
Front dispatches indicated plainly
that a crucial point had been reached
in the operations, with the Germans
having had 15 days to realign their
forces by land while the Allies
laboriously put reinforcement ashore
by sea.
To the south, American troops still
had not dislodged the Germans from
Cassino after five days of costly
street fighting and were now storm
ing Monte Cassino back of the town
in an effort to clean out enemy bat
teries dominating the area.
The Germans counterattacked
fiercely west of Cassino where the
Americans were crowding in on their
only escape route along Via Casilina,
dislodging the Fifth Army from one
small eminence.
The Germans thus had suffered no
major loss of position despite the
breaching of the Gustav line north of
Cassino and, recoiling from the sur
prise of the landings below Rome,
were moving swiftly to counterattack
Allied strategy.
