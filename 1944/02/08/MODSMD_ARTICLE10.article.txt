rania Rouverol, and friends of the
cast and University have been in
vited to attend this initial perform

In explaining the theme of "Young
Man of Today," Miss Rouverol said,
'Youth, a few years ago—especially
our university youth—took on its
shoulders the burden of social re
sponsibility and political thought.
"In an attempt to solve the prob
lems of society, they espoused
causes and "Isms." And then came
Pearl Harbor; the guns spoke and
our girls and boys had suddenly to
reverse themselves and face the grim
reality of war."
