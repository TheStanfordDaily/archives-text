### JEAN LEVINSON 
MY DAY
Dear Mrs. R.:
I read with»avid interest a letter you received.a few days ago
by one who called herself "Letitia Looselife." Since it is ironical
that my case is in exact contradiction, I would like to state it and
seek your wise advice.
I am a college graduate and am industriously attending busi
ness school in order to further my chances in the world of industry.
I am steeped in such fascinating subjects as shorthand, typewrit
ing, bookkeeping, and the like. I adore to study and was a Phi
Beta Kappa while attending the university. There is nothing I
would rather do than browse through the library and absorb
knowledge. It's fun.
It seems that my thirst for knowledge and higher learning can
not be quenched, althodgh I've tried variods remedies such as
Bromo Seltzer, Fitch Shampoo, and Bubble Gum. I am literally at
my wits' end, as it were.
During-my lunch hour v/hen my fellow compatriots talk of
men, clothes, men, movies, men, and the like, I feel that I am not
quail d to enter into their profound conversations. Instead I
suck on a Malt tablet and read the Congressional Record or the
index of the Encyclopedia, and it's fun.
Whenever I have gone out on a date (as my compatriots have
want of putting it), I find myself explaining the mores of the New
Zealand headhunters, or Darwin's theory of evolution.
Somehow my swain becomes disinterested and usually re
plies, "You're kidding, of course!"
I try to be entertaining and enlightening, and choose with
care my topics of conversation before going out, but they seldom
meet with success, and to coin a colloquialism, I have become a
'Bookworm."
My only diversion is in reading the comic strip, "Dick Tracy,"
and trying to fathom out the psychological workings of this in
genious sleuth's mind. It's fun.
But as you can clearly see, Mrs. R., my life has become utterly
onesided and my books have become my friends .... but who
can tell a joke to a book? I am in a quandry. Please help me o.ut
of this dilemma.
Diligently,
Grenadine Grind.
Dear Miss Grind:
Go down to the nearest Pub and order a straight shot of lime
ade, neat. Then remove your glasses, put on a sweater, and go
to the nearest cfasting office and try out for the chorus. You'll
find life will become one mad whirl, and worth living after all
. . . . also subscribe to the "Chapparal."
Sincerely yours,
Eleanor.

of this dilemma.
Diligently,
Grenadine Grind.
Dear Miss Grind:
Go down to the nearest Pub and order a straight shot of lime
ade, neat. Then remove your glasses, put on a sweater, and go
to the nearest cfasting office and try out for the chorus. You'll
find life will become one mad whirl, and worth living after all
. . . . also subscribe to the "Chapparal."
Sincerely yours,
Eleanor.
MY DAY
Dear Mrs. R.:
I read with»avid interest a letter you received.a few days ago
by one who called herself "Letitia Looselife." Since it is ironical
that my case is in exact contradiction, I would like to state it and
seek your wise advice.
I am a college graduate and am industriously attending busi
ness school in order to further my chances in the world of industry.
I am steeped in such fascinating subjects as shorthand, typewrit
ing, bookkeeping, and the like. I adore to study and was a Phi
Beta Kappa while attending the university. There is nothing I
would rather do than browse through the library and absorb
knowledge. It's fun.
It seems that my thirst for knowledge and higher learning can
not be quenched, althodgh I've tried variods remedies such as
Bromo Seltzer, Fitch Shampoo, and Bubble Gum. I am literally at
my wits' end, as it were.
During-my lunch hour v/hen my fellow compatriots talk of
men, clothes, men, movies, men, and the like, I feel that I am not
quail d to enter into their profound conversations. Instead I
suck on a Malt tablet and read the Congressional Record or the
index of the Encyclopedia, and it's fun.
Whenever I have gone out on a date (as my compatriots have
want of putting it), I find myself explaining the mores of the New
Zealand headhunters, or Darwin's theory of evolution.
Somehow my swain becomes disinterested and usually re
plies, "You're kidding, of course!"
I try to be entertaining and enlightening, and choose with
care my topics of conversation before going out, but they seldom
meet with success, and to coin a colloquialism, I have become a
'Bookworm."
My only diversion is in reading the comic strip, "Dick Tracy,"
and trying to fathom out the psychological workings of this in
genious sleuth's mind. It's fun.
But as you can clearly see, Mrs. R., my life has become utterly
onesided and my books have become my friends .... but who
can tell a joke to a book? I am in a quandry. Please help me o.ut
of this dilemma.
Diligently,
Grenadine Grind.
