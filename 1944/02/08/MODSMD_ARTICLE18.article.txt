# Once Upon a Time... It Was 'Old Union'
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Though the present Union has that
"been-here-for-years" look, it is far
from the same Union that was estab
lished on the site more than 30 years
ago.
Constructed with the money that
had been collected from Alumni and
students the original purpose of the
Union was as a club for the conven
ience of all subscribers. Many
.bought life memberships which
would entitle them to room and
board for themselves and their
guests upon their return to the cam
pus for a visit.
This purpose, however, was even
tually changed by the acquisition by
various business concessions of the
space within the newly constructed
Union. Where carefree students now
migrate for a candy bar or a maga
zine, there was originally located a
small barber shop, and directly be
hind it, Mr. Green, a well known
campus figure, ran a cigar store.
Even at this, the greater part of this
space was occupied by a cumber
some boiler system. Where the bar
ber ship now stands. Wideman's
clothing store originally flourished.
Even the well known Cellar was not
always a part of University life, for a
Japanese resterauteur occupied this
room for many years.
The upstairs rooms of the Old
Union did not always belong to the
various student body officers, for the
executive board found that they
needed the revenue derived from
rental of these rooms for mainte
nance. During this time, the small
cubicle in the wall near the Dra
matic Manager's office was rented for
$25 a month to the Palo Alto bank so
that they could cash checks on the
campus. As soon as financially pos
sible, however, the offices were
moved to the Union.
Likewise, the Nitery is an inno
vation since the Union's earliest
days. This room was once a maze of
partitioned offices, and was not con
verted into a recreation hall until the
years during the depression, when
students desired a social center on
the campus itself. A gradual decline
in the usefulness of the Nitery for
the purpose was brought to an end
with the advent of the war, and its
recent conversion into the Stanford
Canteen.
When a gift of the new Union
building was presented by an
"anonymous donor," Union Execu
tive Committee borrowed $65,000
from the Board of Trustees to furnish
the interior. An alumni room was
established on the second floor,

whereas kitchens and two men's eat
ing club rooms were built on the
first.
The profits from the Union, which
are at present going into payment on
the debt incurred by the building of
the Memorial Auditorium, will some
day be providing University .scholar
ships, according to Dr. William
Owen, law professor and Union Ex
ecutive Board Committee member
who volunteered the facts and fig
ures contained in this article.

The upstairs rooms of the Old
Union did not always belong to the
various student body officers, for the
executive board found that they
needed the revenue derived from
rental of these rooms for mainte
nance. During this time, the small
cubicle in the wall near the Dra
matic Manager's office was rented for
$25 a month to the Palo Alto bank so
that they could cash checks on the
campus. As soon as financially pos
sible, however, the offices were
moved to the Union.
Likewise, the Nitery is an inno
vation since the Union's earliest
days. This room was once a maze of
partitioned offices, and was not con
verted into a recreation hall until the
years during the depression, when
students desired a social center on
the campus itself. A gradual decline
in the usefulness of the Nitery for
the purpose was brought to an end
with the advent of the war, and its
recent conversion into the Stanford
Canteen.
When a gift of the new Union
building was presented by an

Constructed with the money that
had been collected from Alumni and
students the original purpose of the
Union was as a club for the conven

would entitle them to room and

guests upon their return to the cam
pus for a visit.
This purpose, however, was even
tually changed by the acquisition by
various business concessions of the
space within the newly constructed
Union. Where carefree students now
migrate for a candy bar or a maga

small barber shop, and directly be
