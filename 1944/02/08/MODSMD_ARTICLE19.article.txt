A graduate of Stanford University,
Marine Captain Elton D. Boone Jr.,
24, of 117 North Fir Ave., Inglewood,
Calif., dropped a bomb thSt silenced
a strategic gun emplacement on
Kangu Hill adjacent to Kahili air
base.
Captain Boone received his flight
training at Corpus Christi, Texas,
and was commissioned and won his
wings in September 1942. He was
promoted to his present rank last
November. Now on leave, he is
visiting his parents, Mr. and Mrs.
Elton D. Boone Sr., at Inglewood.
After completing 45 combat sorties |
against every Jap-held base in the j
kSolomon Islands, Captain Boone re- j
called enemy anti-aircraft fire in
which his plane narrowly escaped
being shot down.
"My bomber stopped a 40-milli
meter shell during the dive. It
ripped a three-foot hole in the lead
ing edge of the right wing and shrap
nel struck throughout the fuselage.
Nevertheless I was successful in
pulling out very close to the ground.
I immediately left my squadron's
formation and by using a full throttle
managed to land safely on Vella
Lavella."
On another flight Captain Boone J
made a direct hit on a Jap army
barracks on Bougainville.
"The bomb disintegrated the entire
building," he said. "It is difficult to
be certain about strafing results, but
1 had an excellent opportunity dur
ing the surprise raid on the camp
area."
