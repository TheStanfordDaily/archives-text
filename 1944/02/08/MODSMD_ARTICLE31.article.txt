### JIM WEINBERG 
Wrong Again
Well, I guess you can't outguess
Roger Gorman on the prediction of
football and basketball results. The
"experts" found that out on several
occasions last quarter during football
season; I found it out last Saturday
night.
Last week I picked UCLA to upset
California in their championship
basketball contest, while Roger
strung along with the Bears. Much
to my chagrin, the Bruins wound up
on the short end of a 36-24 decision.
The Bears really did look to be the
better team. Though behind through
almost all of the first 35 minutes of
play, they always managed to stay
within threatening distance. Then
when the crucial point came, with
the score tied at 24-all and five min
utes to go, the Bears turned on the
steam, grabbed the lead, and won
going away.
Individual Honors
Individual honors for contributing
to the Bears' triumph are shared by
Steve Shutt, who tanked 14 points;
George Jones and Jim Higgins, a
couple of former Stanford boys; and
Dick West, veteran UCLA forward.
West, though he di.d score eight
points for the Bruins, helped the
Bears no end with some very sloppy
ball handling.
Figuring that I can't be much fur
ther off than I was last week, I've de
cided to stick my neck out again this
time and pick the Trojans to upset
the Bears Saturday in Los Angeles.
Maybe I'm just prejudiced against
Cal, but those Trojans are a much
improved club, and they ought to be
tough to beat on their home court
(or stage, rather), the Shrine Audi
torium. Don't sav we didn't tell you.
