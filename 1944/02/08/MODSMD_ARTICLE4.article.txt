WASHINGTON (UP) â€” American
warships have dealt their first blow
against Japanese home territory in
the boldest sea thrust of the war, a
savage bombardment of Paramu
shiro, Jap "Pearl Harbor" of the
north Pacific, the Navy disclosed to
day.
Steaming within easy range of the
enemy's coast guns the vessels laid
down mighty salvos, hitting and
breaching a Jap ship and igniting
fires in the area which is the site of
a great air and sea base.
