# Driscoll Reports Official Victory

DEAR STANFORD:
Last night, by telephone, I received official confirmation of
California's results, and Stanford has been declared the winner.
California's total sales of $194,912.40 exceeded our total sales
by only $8,000 and they came no where near the ratio figure. We
drubbed them thoroughly, and we've shown that the Stanford
spirit is far from dead. Once again the Cardinal has whipped the
Gold and Blue. Never again can anyone say that Stanford is
ignoring the war. By our response to this drive we have shown
the strength of our patriotism. We can continue to show our
awareness of the war by devoting our enthusiasm to the salvage
drive, to bandage-rolling, and to the blood bank.
First may I thank each of you, for your response and spirit
made the drive the huge success that it was. You have brought
great credit to the Stanford name. Nice going!
Secondly the thanks of the whole school should go to Carol
Hurwitz and her gang of loyal War Board workers, who devoted
so much time and energy to keep the drive functioning smoothly.
Barbara White and Ric Supple, along with the rest of Cardi
nals, deserve much credit for their fine rallies and their house-to
house canvass campaign.
The Daily too comes in for many thanks for its cooperation and
fine reporting. Daily staff members did all the work in connection
with exchanging Daily totals with Cal, and they worked hard to
get correct information to you.
To those of you who contributed so generously to our auctions,
many, many thanks. Pat Roberts, Marie Koefod, and Nancy Ga
nahl, who contributed their beloved Buick, deserve our especial
gratitude.
To Stanford men, too, my sincere thanks for the admirable
spirit of sportsmanlike self-control exercised in connection with
The Axe. The way in which you acted was a credit to Stanford,
and you have earned the respect of all concerned.
In spite of our disappointment Saturday night much credit
is due to California's student officers for evolving an idea that
paid off so handsomely. The idea of the contest was entirely theirs
and the fact that it added almost $400,000 to the war effort over
shadows any disappointment we may have suffered at their hands.
We have done a good job and we have every right to be proud
of ourselves, of our accomplishments, and of our school. Thanks
again to you all.
Sincerely,
DICK DRISCOLL.
