### JEAN LEVINSON 
The writer of this column usually, at one time or another,
attends a dress rehearsal of some play in production and takes
wise notes and observations. Last night I attended the final dress
of Aurania Rouverol's new play, 'Young Man of Today," which
opens tonight for a five-night run.
A final dress rehearsal is really a finished product, and should
be equal to performance level .... and last night was no excep
tion. Except for one or two blowups on lines, and a few missing
props, the show ran for all it was worth.
F. Cowles Strickland, the director of this opus about an
American family affected by the war, sat in the back row quietly
gnashing his teeth, gnawing his knuckles, and furrowing his
brows .... picture of a director in contented repose.
Jack Sollers, set designer, was seen sneaking in and out of
doors on stage, tightening hinges, straightening curtains, telling
the cast to "please go easy on those stairs."
A drove of little girls flitted back and forth, taking notes on
makeup and costumes, and laughing appreciatively at the play
.... at the right times.
Beady eyes peered from the light booth and a voice asked
if the Papa was lit up well enough. The actors were straggling
in the outer hallway .... drinking cokes, puffing furiously on
cigarettes, gabbing animatedly, and saying to each other: "Sure
you're good, don't be silly .... you'll kill 'em!"
And then the comeback: "Oh, do you really think so .... I
should get a laugh if I play it right."
Queer psychology these actors use with each other . . . .
building up their egos for the opening night.
Last night was the final dress rehearsal for "Young Man of
Today," and tonight the play opens. This means that all the
work of the actors, costumers, scenery crew, and director, has
come to a final head and will be displayed before a group of
discerning people.
The finished product is a good one .... a darn good one,
and everyone should go to see it. It seems that the students on
this campus have never been particularly enthusiastic about
seeing local talent and local plays produced by the Speech and
Drama Department.
The plays are always witnessed by enthusiastic audiences,
but they consist mainly of Palo Alto people, and a few drama
enthusiasts. The plays presented on campus are entertaining
and inexpensive, and show a good deal of time and energy spent
on the part of those participating.
How about patronizing the Stanford Players this year, and
attending more of the productions? You won't regret it.

be equal to performance level .... and last night was no excep
tion. Except for one or two blowups on lines, and a few missing
props, the show ran for all it was worth.
F. Cowles Strickland, the director of this opus about an
American family affected by the war, sat in the back row quietly
gnashing his teeth, gnawing his knuckles, and furrowing his
brows .... picture of a director in contented repose.
Jack Sollers, set designer, was seen sneaking in and out of
doors on stage, tightening hinges, straightening curtains, telling
the cast to "please go easy on those stairs."
A drove of little girls flitted back and forth, taking notes on
makeup and costumes, and laughing appreciatively at the play
.... at the right times.
Beady eyes peered from the light booth and a voice asked
if the Papa was lit up well enough. The actors were straggling
in the outer hallway .... drinking cokes, puffing furiously on
cigarettes, gabbing animatedly, and saying to each other: "Sure
you're good, don't be silly .... you'll kill 'em!"
And then the comeback: "Oh, do you really think so .... I
should get a laugh if I play it right."
Queer psychology these actors use with each other . . . .
building up their egos for the opening night.
Last night was the final dress rehearsal for "Young Man of
Today," and tonight the play opens. This means that all the
work of the actors, costumers, scenery crew, and director, has
come to a final head and will be displayed before a group of
discerning people.
The finished product is a good one .... a darn good one,
and everyone should go to see it. It seems that the students on
this campus have never been particularly enthusiastic about
seeing local talent and local plays produced by the Speech and
Drama Department.
The plays are always witnessed by enthusiastic audiences,
but they consist mainly of Palo Alto people, and a few drama
enthusiasts. The plays presented on campus are entertaining
and inexpensive, and show a good deal of time and energy spent
on the part of those participating.
How about patronizing the Stanford Players this year, and
attending more of the productions? You won't regret it.
The writer of this column usually, at one time or another,
attends a dress rehearsal of some play in production and takes
wise notes and observations. Last night I attended the final dress
of Aurania Rouverol's new play, 'Young Man of Today," which
opens tonight for a five-night run.
A final dress rehearsal is really a finished product, and should
be equal to performance level .... and last night was no excep
tion. Except for one or two blowups on lines, and a few missing
props, the show ran for all it was worth.
