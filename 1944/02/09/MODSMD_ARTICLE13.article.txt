To the Editor:
Stanford's wonderful results in the contest with Cal last
week is more than a great contribution to the Fourth War Loan
Drive. It shows the cooperation and spirit that Stanford men and
women can put forth when they really want to. It was only be
cause everyone was so helpful and because everyone joined in,
that we were able to win. It wasn't the victory of just a small
group of people. It was the whole campus that did the work.
We want to thank all the girls who sold in the booths, the
fellows and girls who helped in the office, Cardinals, Mr. Wheel
wright and hi's community music class, the Kappas, th£ "Gaieties"
cast, Claude Wilson and his band, the Daily, the Stanford Band,
Frank Rogier, the girls who sold food in the Nitery, the taxi
dance girls, Lagunita, Ventura, and Roble, those who donated
things for the auctions, and all the wonderful canvassers, Cap
and Gown, and the A.W.V.S., without whose help we could
never have succeeded.^
Thanks, everyone, for a magnificent job.
