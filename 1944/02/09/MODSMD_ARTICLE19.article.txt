Walt Disney carried the Tuesday

sound and color film covering a trip j
the producer made through Central j
and South America with a research
staff of artists, musicians, and j
writers.
Preceding the movie, Maxwell H. I
Savelle, professor of history, deliv
ered introductory comments on the j
general attitude of our country to- |
ward our neighbors.
"We must realize that they are not
onlv different from us. hut from each

other in race, social institutions, art. j
and language," lie said, speaking of
the Latin Americas as a group of
countries rather than as an indi- j
viriual country as vve are inclined to i
think of them.
Disney attempted to characterize
these differences as well as to illus
trate the manner in which his staff |
collected technical information and j
ideas for his research movie, which i
drew a crowd that filled the Memo
rial Auditorium.
The film covered the highlights of ;
the trip which began with Rio De
Janeiro in Brazil, then to Uruguay, |

j Argentina, Lake Titieaca, La Paz
Bolivia, and Guatemala.
Each stop was illustrated with col
| ored movies, pictures made by the
I artists, and caricatures born from
j ideas collected on the spot, and come
to life, while the audience loked on.
Mr. Savelle pointed out that. "Lat
in America is a great customer of
ours, and as we help to raise their
! standard of living, they will lie liuy-
I ing more and more ol our goods,"
while Disney's film illustrated the
great modern cities, and vast eco
nomic resources of our neighbors.
Of technical interest was the col

i cartoons, such as the llamas and
j donkeys, the llower boats on the
{ Mexican canals, Pluto as a gaucho,
and Donald Duck as a rumba dancer.
