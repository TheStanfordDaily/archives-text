## Senate Passes Federal Ballot for Servicemen 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP)—The Senate
today passed the Green-Lucas fed
eral ballot bill twice —first as an
amendment to the House approved
State's Rights bill, then as a sep
arate measure, in an unusual move
designed to guarantee that some
form of the federal ballot plan is in
the finally enacted vote legislation.
Both actions represented victory
for the administration, which has
endorsed the federal ballot plan as
against state ballots for servicemen
in next November's election.
The Senate's two-ply version of
soldier vote legislation now goes to
the House, which last week over
whelmingly approved the State's
liighls hill after rejecting a federal
ballot proposal. The House must
now act 011 the Senate Federal Ballot
provision. In view of its action, it
presumably will reject the Senate
plan and throw the matter into con
ference.
The administration victory came
after the Senate rebuffed two last
ditch efforts by a Republican-
Southern-Democrat coalition to write
into the bill drastic restrictions on
the use of a federal ballot. Both at
tempts were beaten by identical
votes—4s to 41.
After Senator Robert Taft's first
effort was beaten, the Senate adopted
by a 46 to 40 vote a motion by Dem
ocratic Leader Alben B. Barkeley to
make the Green-Lucas bill an
amendment to the House approved
State's Rights bill.
After that, the Senate by a 47 to 38
vote passed the Green-Lucas bill as
an entirely separate measure.
