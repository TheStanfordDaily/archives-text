# Scrap Drive Saturday

### 
The first salvage drive of the quar
ter will be held next Saturday, Feb.
12, from 8 to 10 in the morning, an
nounced Barbara Pike, War Board
salvage chairman. Salvage will be
picked up in front of all living groups
and private homes on campus.
Items needed for this drive are:
paper—scrap, magazines, and news
papers: inner tubes—no other form
of rubber; rags — not necessarily
washed; old clothes; and metal —
including tin cans, bottle caps, and
scrap metal.
'"Everyone's cooperation Is needed
to make this drive a success," said
Miss Pike. "Salvage is vital to the
war effort; so just try to throw the
items desired for salvage in the sal
vage box instead of in the waste
basket.
"Even spend a few minutes trying
to find something to salvage," she
continued. "The drive depends on
you, and a litle effort will make it
a success."
