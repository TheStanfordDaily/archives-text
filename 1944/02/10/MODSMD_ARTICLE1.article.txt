# ‘Y’ Members Hear Elliott

### 
Robert Elliott, Stanford journalism
instructor and foreign editor of the
San Francisco Times, spoke yester
day to the "Y" World Affairs Group
on "Postwar Forecasts." His talk was
based on four questions which he
believed to be of primary importance
in deciding wheth'er postwar actions
will lead to a third world war, or the
'k'st global peace.
w Question {1) asked: "Will the
United Nations fight until Germany
and Japan surrender unconditional
ly?" According to Elliott, if we
compromise with the militarist group
in power in the Axis nations we will
lose hope of global peace. In the poll
taken, following Elliott's discussion,
the members present voted 19 to 2 in
the affirmative of this question.
United Nations Break?
Question (2): "Can Democracy and
Communism get along together and
permit European peoples to choose
their own forms of government?"
Yes, 17 to 4. The Polish border dis
pute, although obscure from the pub
lic eye at present, contains all the
implications of a break within the
ranks of the United Nations them
selves. However, Russia wants and
needs peace, according to Elliott, and
we therefore have a common ground
upon which to harmonize our dif
ferences.
Question (3): "Will the United Na
tions be able to act jointly in set
tling the fate of Europe?" Yes, 14
to 7. All indications thus far are to
the good, says Elliott. One of the
most plausible suggestions for post
war treatment of Germany is the
formation of a reconstruction labor
corps from Nazi soldiei's.
International Organization
Question (4): "Can the United
Nations be perpetuated as a world
organization?" Yes, 15 to 6. Mr.
Slliott warns against the return of
•olationism, saying that the union
of China, Great Britain, Russia, and
the United States, and eventually
world government, is the greatest
hope for a practical perpetuation of
peace.
