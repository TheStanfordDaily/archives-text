# Are You Awake?
## 
### 
TWO of the most encouraging things which last week's suc
cessful War Loan Drive proved were primarily, that Stanford
students still have an abundance of spirit and can get together
to put enough force behind that spirit to win a contest, and
secondly, that we are aware and awake enough to realize that
there is a war going on.
Yet, on the other hand, an attitude among perhaps one-third
of the students seems to cancel the initial thrill of success and
lays a kind of unhealthy tone to that spirit. In short, that atti
tude appears to be that too many students, v/omen in particular,
are attending colleges, not only at Stanford but all over the
country, with the underlying idea of putting in four years toward
a "cultural" degree.
Of course, all of us want a degree, not only as a symbol of
the fulfillment of a directed course, but also as one of a certain
amount of knowledge gained. However, the most discouraging
iact is that many of these degrees are but symbols of attainment,
gained sometimes through a series of snap or cinch courses.
Admittedly, a considerable number of these "cultural" de
grees have given way to more practical courses, indicating the
growing realization that after the war many specialists will be
needed. It is encouraging too, to watch the groups of students
who are switching to necessary courses and also those who are
finishing college on an accelerated but thorough schedule, be
cause this is one of the important ways we can see that univer
sity students are awakening to the demands of the war program.
Let us hope that in the coming quarters even the small
minority will realize that after the war every available person
will be needed for reconstruction and rehabilitation work; that
the economic system which we knew will be radically changed,
and that in order to adjust to this situation, we must take the
most advantage of these few years we are privileged to have in
college and oquip ourselves in the best possible way.
