To the Editor:
Before we came to Stanford our E.M.O.C. brothers used to
tell us about the good times, the big dances that they used to
have here. When we came to Stanford our sponsors told us
about them too. And then the first thing they did was to ship
us off to a jolly-up. Now we are not fighting aganist the principle
of jolly-ups. In fact, we think they are a very good idea if only
one would get jolly. The only trouble is that most people are
jolly and we never have any "ups" to prove it. Since we have
been here at Stanford there have been two jolly-ups. True, the
Canteen is always open, but what Stanford woman wants to
walk into a practically empty Canteen and sit around reading
Life magazines, we ask you?
The ratio being what it is, and the war being what it is, most
new girls have not had much chance to meet many new men, and
vice versa. BUT, the whole situation can be remedied. Last Fri
day night we bought our war stamps at the door of the Women's
Clubhouse and walked in on a dance that was like the ones we
have been hearing about. Good music, good program, and good
time—with plenty of people there to enjoy it.
Conclusion: we want more informal get-togethers to which
everyone will want to go. Things may not be exactly the way
they were, but we'd like them more the way they were last
Friday night.
