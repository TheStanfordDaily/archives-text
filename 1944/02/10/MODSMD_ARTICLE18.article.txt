# Hood College Also Fledges Work Hours
## 
### 
Stanford isn't the only school to
mobilise its students for the purpose
of getting war work accomplished;
Hood College in Frederick, Md., has
i waged such a successful mobilization
campaign that more than 75 per cent
of the students have signed pledges
to do war work.
Like Stanford, Hood's war pledges
are for a definite time. Whereas
Stanford's quota is at least eight
hours of war work per month, the
Hood quota is one hour per day.
Sixteen organizations have joined in
the pledging. Red Cross at Hood is
the major classification of war work
under which the students participate.
There the school has three divisions
similar to those which we have on
this campus: bandage rolling, sal
vage, and blood bank.
Labor Shortages
The WORM's (Women's Organiza
tion for the Relief of the Manpower
Shortage), is one of the most popular
active groups. It was organized
last year, and has the function of
helping out the labor shortages in
the kitchen, on the lawn committee,
and in college laundry work. Spe
cial training is given those students
who volunteer to be electricians.
A physical fitness schedule is in
eluded in Hood College's program.
Stanford, too, has readjusted its
physical education requirements to
build up better health for the strenu
ousness of wartime living.
Local OWI
A local office of war information is
something which has not played such
an important role at Stanford as at
Hood. Not only do they have their
own OWI, but there is also a postwar
planning board, which studies and
evaluates plans for the peace.
Hood College's student body, al
though small, exemplifies the vic
tory-ininded spirit of young Amer
ica.
