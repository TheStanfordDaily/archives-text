My colleague, Jim Weinberg, has
gone out on the limb again this week.
This time he's picked the Trojans of
Southern California to knock over
league-leading Cal Bears in this
Saturday's basketball fracas at Los
Angeles. There may be something
in what Jim says, for the men of
Troy are the fastest improving quin
tet on the Coast, and would surprise
no one by coming out on the top end
of the scoie.
Paced by high-scoring Joe Cherry,
S.C. looked plenty good in upsetting
U.C.L.A. recently, and seems finally
on the victory road. Despite this,
however, it must be remembered
that Cal has already cinched the
league crown, and has beaten S.C.
once before.
If Dick Henderson can regain some
of his early form, and Babe Higgin*
can really get hot for an entire game,
the Bears should take this Saturday's
battle by a small margin. Either way
this contest shapes up as the top
game yf the year on the Coast.
Up Washington way, the Huskies
have turned out one of their best
teams in recent years, and could
make things interesting for Cal if a
conference playoff were held. At the
present moment, though, the chances
of such a meeting are extremely thin.
