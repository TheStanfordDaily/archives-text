## Roble Hashers Come Through To Down McKinley Five, 33-21 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Living up to the predictions and expectations of most people, the smooth
playing Ruble Hasher five scored a comparative close but decisive victory
of 33 to 21 over its main competitor for the league crown, the McKinley A
squad before a small group of spectators last night in the Pavilion.
For the first five minutes of the tussle, it was anybody's guess as to who

would be the winner, as in this time"*
only one bucket had been sunk and
both teams looked, fairly even. As
soon as the Hashers had felt out their
opponents, they opened up and let
loose with some fancy shooting. The
ball was seldom worked all the way i
into the bucket; most of thes coring j
being done from the vicinity of the
foul line. At the half the Hashers
were leading by a score of 14 to 5.
Midway in the second half, the |
McKinley boys hit their stride and |
at one time were only five points J
behind Roble; but the Hashers' |
power proved too much and they !
were soon left in the dust.
Jim Travis came through as high
point man for the Hashers with 12
digits to his credit.
