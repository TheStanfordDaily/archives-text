Stanford in 1909
In speaking about the Farm at the
beginning of the century, Mrs. Rou
verol said, "Stanford is surprisingly
unchanged, although we were very
Victorian in some ways. No one
smoked and drinking was unforgiv
able.
"We were much closer to the fac
ulty in those days, though. And it
was a marvelous faculty! Dr. Jor
dan's first faculty was unsurpassed." j
Broadway
On graduating from Stanford, Mrs.
Rouverol played in stock for a while
and then went to Broadway to take
the lead in "Little Women." She ;
played the part of Meg, following the
late Alice Brady in that role. Pre
ferring writing for the theater than
acting in it, Mrs. Rouverol left the
show to study playwriting at the
Harvard Workshop.
In 1928, Mrs. Rouverol's first orig
inal play, ''Skidding," was pro
duced on Broadway. It is from this
play that the now famous Andy
Hardy and his family came. "Skid
ding" proved an instant success, and
was followed by the equally popular
"Growing Pains" and "Young April."
The latter, which is a sequel to !
"Growing Pains," was written by j
Mrs. Rouverol in collaboration with
her son, William Rouverol. while he J
was a student at Stanford. *

which they have gone through in the
last few years." She also disclosed |
