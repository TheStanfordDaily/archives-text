## 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) —
German artillery has opened a heavy
barrage on the "fish bowl" Allied
beachhead below Rome, it was re
ported today while Allied planes.
Hying 1,500 sorties, hammered grow
ing enemy tank concentration around
Cisterna.
On the southern front, American
troops battered 50 yards deeper into
Cisterna.
(A German DNB broadcast heard
in London said the Nazis had
launched a "concentric" offensive in
the British sector of the beachhead
from the west, north, and northeast,
and had broken through Allied posi
tions at a number of points, reaching
"assigned objectives.")
(The Rome radio Wednesday night
said that in the last few hours, the
Allies had been launching powerful
counterattacks against the German
beachhead lines, but it asserted all
were repelled.)
The exposed beachhead forces had
thrown back repeated German ar
mor-supported thrusts of rising in
tensity without yielding further
ground, but it appeared that a show
down battle could not much longer
be delayed.
