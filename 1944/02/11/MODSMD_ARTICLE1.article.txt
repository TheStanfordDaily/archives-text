After seeing Aurania Rouverol's
"Young Man of Today," it is not hard
to understand why the play has not
been produced elsewhere. Fortu
nately the Stanford Players did the
best job possible with what they had
to work with, and one can well
imagine what the play would be like
if a second-rate theater group pro
duced it.
" Nan Tillson's portrayal of the teen
aged "Muggins" Jason was excellent
and she twice received enthusiastic
applause from the half empty house
as she left the stage. Roger Brander
as Ray Wallace and Stan Willis as
gum-chewing Lester Armstrong both
deserve a great deai of praise for
their performances.
"Young Man of Today" was well
cast, well directed, and well staged;
the only thing the Stanford Players
needed was a good plav.
The plot concerned a well-to-do
family who had more than their
share of problems. The problems,
which ranged from a son who wanted
to be a conscientious objector and a
pro-Japanese daughter were solved
in a haphazard way throughout the
third act. Nearly every woman in
the cast had at least one big crying
scene which began to get tiresome by
the time the third act rolled around.
The play was directed by F.
Cowles Strickland and the setting
was done by John F. Sollers. It will
be repeated tonight, Saturday and
Monday at 8:15 in the Little Theater
of Memorial Auditorium.
