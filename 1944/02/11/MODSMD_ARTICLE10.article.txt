# 'Starduster' Next Saturday
## 
### 
Do you like soft lights (or none at
all), good music, good food, and good
dancing? If so, grab your girl and
take her to McKinley Hall, the o.d
Theta Xi house on 717 Dolores, for
its "Starduster" dance tomorrow
night from 9 to 1 o'clock. A surprise
is in store for you, too, for McKinley
is carrying out its theme with a dif
ferent phase for each room in a
manner not yet revealed.
The dance, although an all-campus
and date affair, is free; and dress will
be strictly informal. Refreshments
in the form of punch and cookies will
be served during the evening; music
will come from records.
