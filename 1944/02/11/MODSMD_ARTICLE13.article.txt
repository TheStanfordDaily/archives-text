AN ARMY STUDENT, a former Stanford
rough, walked into the Shack and asked to
see the editor.
"Why in heck can't we have some co-opera
tion around this place? Where's the old Stan
ford I used to know?
"I don't mean the same old material things.
No, I mean the fight, which ought to be the
same even though the school is physically
different.
"Ye gods, it seems to me that everybody's,
sguabbling with everybody else. The soldiers i
feel they don't get a square deal, the girls aren't
unified.
"Stanford used to be one University. There
were a lot of individuals, sure, and there have ■
always been factions, but there was a certain;
intangible something that kept us together. All
our smaller factions were subordinate to that 1
spirit. Well, where in heck has it gone, I'd like
to know?"
This Stanford Army student said all these:
things over a week ago—before the bond drive
was under way. He probably wouldn't say them
today, because during the bond contest Stan
ford partially got back something it had lost: |
we were unified.
And the reason for our "one for all and all
for one" attitude was that we had something
to work on, something to work on which drew ;
us together because it called for consolidated ]
action. We worked side by side, planning and ;
putting those plans into effect. Students from
different living groups got a feeling of solidarity
because they had a common purpose and a |
practical means of expressing that purpose.
Now the bond contest is over. We can all
retire to our little holes, concentrate on our little
groups and let the rest of the campus and the i
world slip by quietly and unnoticed.
Yes, we can do that, but why should we? We j
had an answer to that rough's thoughts, and
there's no reason why we can't continue to'
make him eat his words.
But we can't have a spirit unless we work for
it, because the larger the group the more effort
necessary for maintaining a feeling of solidar
ity; and concurrently, we can't have a spirit
unless we have some tangible way of express
ing it. A person can't sit in his or her room
saying, "Rah, I've got the Stanford spirit!"
No. A person can't show fight or interest or
group consciousness unless he's got a job to
do —mental or physical.
And so—what to do?
In the realm of campus activities there are
so many possibilities it would take pages to |
list them all. But to take the most obvious asset,,
why don't we make use of the Nitery?
Instead of having only occasional planned
parties, there could be two a week. Different
living groups could work through a co-ordinator,'
the result being that each Friday and Saturday
night the campus would be guaranteed a good :
dance, complete with food, music, and enter
tainment. Remember the success of the Kappa
effort last week?
A.? for maintaining the Nitery, it seems rea

sonable that a group of men would be willing
to scrub it clean each week for a nominal fee
out of the A.S.SU.. treasury.
As for living groups meeting each other,
why don't the various groups ask each other
over—the men for a basketball tussle, the
women for a "spread" or after-dinner coffee?
Women's living groups could well gather for
some good old informal -food sessions with lots
of singing, bull-sessioning, and entertainment.
What's the point of all this? It's simply this:
we could clear up many misunderstandings,
find out what goes on outside of our immediate
world, and find out that "maybe she isn't such
a bad kid after all."
And if anyone has suggestions or ideas per
tinent to the subject (you, corridor 2c in Roble),
don't sit back and wait for someone else to think
of them.
Just call Carol Hurwitz or Luana Forkner oi
Dick Driscoll and say, "We've got an idea, and
we'd like to do something about it."

some good old informal -food sessions with lots
of singing, bull-sessioning, and entertainment.
What's the point of all this? It's simply this:
we could clear up many misunderstandings,
find out what goes on outside of our immediate
world, and find out that "maybe she isn't such
a bad kid after all."
And if anyone has suggestions or ideas per
tinent to the subject (you, corridor 2c in Roble),
don't sit back and wait for someone else to think
of them.
Just call Carol Hurwitz or Luana Forkner oi
Dick Driscoll and say, "We've got an idea, and
we'd like to do something about it."
AN ARMY STUDENT, a former Stanford
rough, walked into the Shack and asked to
see the editor.
"Why in heck can't we have some co-opera
tion around this place? Where's the old Stan
ford I used to know?
"I don't mean the same old material things.
No, I mean the fight, which ought to be the
same even though the school is physically
different.
"Ye gods, it seems to me that everybody's,
sguabbling with everybody else. The soldiers i
feel they don't get a square deal, the girls aren't
unified.
"Stanford used to be one University. There
were a lot of individuals, sure, and there have ■
always been factions, but there was a certain;
intangible something that kept us together. All
our smaller factions were subordinate to that 1
spirit. Well, where in heck has it gone, I'd like
to know?"
This Stanford Army student said all these:
things over a week ago—before the bond drive
was under way. He probably wouldn't say them
today, because during the bond contest Stan
ford partially got back something it had lost: |
we were unified.
And the reason for our "one for all and all
for one" attitude was that we had something
to work on, something to work on which drew ;
us together because it called for consolidated ]
action. We worked side by side, planning and ;
putting those plans into effect. Students from
different living groups got a feeling of solidarity
because they had a common purpose and a |
practical means of expressing that purpose.
Now the bond contest is over. We can all
retire to our little holes, concentrate on our little
groups and let the rest of the campus and the i
world slip by quietly and unnoticed.
Yes, we can do that, but why should we? We j
had an answer to that rough's thoughts, and
there's no reason why we can't continue to'
make him eat his words.
But we can't have a spirit unless we work for
it, because the larger the group the more effort
necessary for maintaining a feeling of solidar
ity; and concurrently, we can't have a spirit
unless we have some tangible way of express
ing it. A person can't sit in his or her room
saying, "Rah, I've got the Stanford spirit!"
No. A person can't show fight or interest or
group consciousness unless he's got a job to
do —mental or physical.
And so—what to do?
In the realm of campus activities there are
so many possibilities it would take pages to |
list them all. But to take the most obvious asset,,
why don't we make use of the Nitery?
Instead of having only occasional planned
parties, there could be two a week. Different
living groups could work through a co-ordinator,'
the result being that each Friday and Saturday
night the campus would be guaranteed a good :
dance, complete with food, music, and enter
tainment. Remember the success of the Kappa
effort last week?
A.? for maintaining the Nitery, it seems rea

sonable that a group of men would be willing
to scrub it clean each week for a nominal fee
out of the A.S.SU.. treasury.
As for living groups meeting each other,
why don't the various groups ask each other
over—the men for a basketball tussle, the
women for a "spread" or after-dinner coffee?
Women's living groups could well gather for
some good old informal -food sessions with lots
of singing, bull-sessioning, and entertainment.
