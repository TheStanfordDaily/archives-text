## "AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES" 
### JEAN LEVINSON Faith Birdwin 
(The story thus far): Pamela is accosted in
the park by a black-cloaked figure, who warns
her:
"Steady, I'm not going to hurt you. I only
want to . . . warn you that it's too late an hour
for a young girl to be out on the streets. I am
your Air Rid Warden, Oliver."
Pamela's tense muscles relaxed and her
beaming smile lit up the entire park, as she
said: "My, but you did take me a-back, Oliver.
You can release me from your vice-like grip
now."
Unwillingly, Oliver did so, and then looked
long and hard at Pam.
"Come sit beside me on the bench, sweet
lady, and talk to me."
Pamela thought that she shouldn't indulge in
conversation with this strange man she had
never had the pleasure of being formally intro
duced to, but her better judgment won out and
she answered, "All right."
As they sat close together in the silent park,
the moon magically found its way from out of
the dark storm clouds, and a shimmering, lunar
light spilled all over the place. It was an en
chanted fairyland, and the pair were soon under
its spell.
"Tell me, little girl of the darkness, what is
your name?"
Although Pamela had known this man but a
short interval of time, she willingly replied,
"Pamela . . . and yours is Oliver, the Air Raid
Warden, isn't it?"
Oliver's sculptured features lit up as if he had
turned his Ever-Ready Flashlight upon them.
He was pleased that she had remembered his
nom de plume, and murmured:
"Yes, it is, and I shall always remember you
as 'Pamela of the Park,' you gorgeous creature."
"Thank you," replied Pam in her lovably
demure way.
Her brain was spinning again for the third
time this evening, as she studied her bench
companion under cover of the fog. He was
rather bald, and the moonlight cast silver beams
on his well-shaped head. She was unable to
discern the color of his eyes, but she did notice
a crooked scar on his swarthy countenance, that
ran from his left temple down to the right cor
ner of his chin, gracefully dissecting his mouth
and nose.
Pamela grew bold and said: "You interest me,
Oliver, more than I can say. You're so different
looking . . . greatly unlike Stephen, or Geoffrey,
or Christopher. I think I love you madly."
Oliver gnashed his teeth for several minutes,
and answered: "Oh, Pamela, you goddess, that's
all I wanted to know. I, too, feel extremely
partial towards you. Come away with me to
Mountain View and v/e can . .

a crooked scar on his swarthy countenance, that
ran from his left temple down to the right cor
ner of his chin, gracefully dissecting his mouth
and nose.
Pamela grew bold and said: "You interest me,
Oliver, more than I can say. You're so different
looking . . . greatly unlike Stephen, or Geoffrey,
or Christopher. I think I love you madly."
Oliver gnashed his teeth for several minutes,
and answered: "Oh, Pamela, you goddess, that's
all I wanted to know. I, too, feel extremely
partial towards you. Come away with me to
Mountain View and v/e can . .

(The story thus far): Pamela is accosted in
the park by a black-cloaked figure, who warns
her:
"Steady, I'm not going to hurt you. I only
want to . . . warn you that it's too late an hour
for a young girl to be out on the streets. I am
your Air Rid Warden, Oliver."
Pamela's tense muscles relaxed and her
beaming smile lit up the entire park, as she
said: "My, but you did take me a-back, Oliver.
You can release me from your vice-like grip
now."
Unwillingly, Oliver did so, and then looked
long and hard at Pam.
"Come sit beside me on the bench, sweet
lady, and talk to me."
Pamela thought that she shouldn't indulge in
conversation with this strange man she had
never had the pleasure of being formally intro
duced to, but her better judgment won out and
she answered, "All right."
As they sat close together in the silent park,
the moon magically found its way from out of
the dark storm clouds, and a shimmering, lunar
light spilled all over the place. It was an en
chanted fairyland, and the pair were soon under
its spell.
"Tell me, little girl of the darkness, what is
your name?"
Although Pamela had known this man but a
short interval of time, she willingly replied,
"Pamela . . . and yours is Oliver, the Air Raid
Warden, isn't it?"
Oliver's sculptured features lit up as if he had
turned his Ever-Ready Flashlight upon them.
He was pleased that she had remembered his
nom de plume, and murmured:
"Yes, it is, and I shall always remember you
as 'Pamela of the Park,' you gorgeous creature."
"Thank you," replied Pam in her lovably
demure way.
Her brain was spinning again for the third
time this evening, as she studied her bench
companion under cover of the fog. He was
rather bald, and the moonlight cast silver beams
on his well-shaped head. She was unable to
discern the color of his eyes, but she did notice
a crooked scar on his swarthy countenance, that
ran from his left temple down to the right cor
ner of his chin, gracefully dissecting his mouth
and nose.
