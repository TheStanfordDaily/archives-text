# Musical Comedy "I Dood It" Playing at Stanford Theater
## 
### 
"I DOOD IT"—now playing at the
Stanford Theater
"I Dood It,"the phrase which Red
Skelton made infamous on the ra
dio, is the same comedian's newest
attempt for M-G-M-. The film is
a musical comedy, but falls far short
in the latter category.
Skelton is a pants presser in a
swanky hotel and there meets a
beautiful actress (Eleanor Powell).
The red-headed one then dresses up
like a rich gentleman and succeeds
in marrying Miss Powell. Eleanor,
of course, is furious when she learns
Red's real identity, but everything
turns out peaches and cream for

both when Red uncovers a Nazi sa
boteur in Miss Powell's show.
"I Dood It" is a pretty dreary little
tale that is saved from complete
disaster by Jimmy Doisey's band,
sultry Lena Horne, and jiving Hazel
Scott.
Charles Laughton returns to the
screen in the second feature, "The
Man from Down Under," a curious
and uninteresting mixup of prize
fighting, love, and war. There's a
lot of unwelcome propaganda thrown
in to make matters even worse. Bin
nie Barnes makes a mess of her
role, as do most of the supporting
cast.
