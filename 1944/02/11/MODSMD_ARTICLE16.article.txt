## 
### DAN WHITE 
The 47 Stanford alumni known to have lost their lives in World War II
have been memorialized through gifts to the Memorial Fund at the Uni
versity, Gen. Sec. Paul H. Davis reported today. The memorial is.in the
form of special bookplates bearing the names of the individuals in whose
memory the volumes have been purchased by the University Library.

The memory of every Stanford""
war casualty will be so honored,
either by specific gifts from friends,
or by an anonymous donor who has
provided for a memorial for every
alumnus who loses his life in the
war. A special exhibit of some of j
the volumes which have been pur
chased is now on display in the main
corridors of the library.
A person does not have to be an
alumnUs of Stanford to be memo
rialized, according to Nathan Van
Patten, director of University libra
ries. As the plan operates, he ex
plained, the donor sends a small check
—usually $s—to5 —to the University, giv
ing the name of the individual to be
memorialized and the name and ad
dress of the surviving member of the
family to be notified of the gift. The
University then buys a book for the
Library, and in the book affixes a j
memorial bookplate.
In explaining the manner of select- :
ing memorial books, Dr. Van Patten 1
said, "Some donors have designated i
the books which they desired pur- i
chased. When a gift is not accom- [
panied by any suggestion as to what j
book is to become a memorial, an
effort is made to acquire a title
within the known field of interest of
the individual in whose memory the
gift is made.
"Whenever possible the books pur- i
chased are works of permanent value !
and well printed. We want books I
worthy to stand upon the shelves as
memorial gifts."
