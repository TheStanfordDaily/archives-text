# Girls Needed At Red Cross
## 
### 
Still more girls are needed to work
in the Red Cross surgical dressing
room, announced Martha Austin,
chairman, even though most of the
living groups have fulfilled their
quotas and 4633 surgical dressings
have been made this quarter.
"Results from this week," said Miss
Austin, "were encouraging since
many girls turned out. But this isn't
enough. We have to have even more
girls to .keep up our quota."
Girls are reminded that even if
they didn't sign up to work regu
larly, they may work whenever they
can. They can be taught in a few
minutes to make dressings. Open
hours are: 10 to 12 a.m. and 1 to 4
p.m. Monday through Thursday.
All those girls who have signed up
to go at assigned hours must go or
send a substitute. Also these girls
may work additional hours besides
those they have signed up for.
"Making surgical dressings is a
vital war activity," said Miss Aus
tin. "We have a quota of dressings
to fill for the Red Cross which will
only be filled if the girls on campus
co-operate."
