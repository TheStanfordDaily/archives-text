# SWB Publishes Point Results

### 
The results of last week's tabula
tion of women's war work hours
have been announced by Joan Hub
bard, who is in charge of the results.
War work is being tabulated this
quarter by means of a point system
that gives each women's living group
credit for the amount of work done
each week by the girls in that resi
dence. For every hour's work one
point of credit is given by the War
Board.
At the beginning of each week
lists are posted in every women's
residence and are taken down the
following Monday. Every time a
girl does any war work she should
sign up on the list.
