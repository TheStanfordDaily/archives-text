# Inner Quad Has Face-Lifting
## 
### 
Work was started today on the re
modeling of the classrooms in the
Law building on the Inner Quad,
for the purpose of housing admin
istrative offices. When completed,
the new quarters will provide space
for offices including the President's
office, an office for the Board of
Trustees, and a committee room for
faculty use.
The building will be connected by
a covered arcade to the wing of the
present Administration Building oc
cupied by the Registrar's office.
It is expected that the remodeling
will be completed in about two
months. Law classes have been as
signed to other classrooms on the
Quad. Decision has not yet been
made as to what use will be made
of the Administration Building space
now occupied by the President's
office.
