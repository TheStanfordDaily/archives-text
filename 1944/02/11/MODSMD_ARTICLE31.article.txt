# Museum Buys Ruben's Work
## 
### 
"The Tribute Money," an oil paint
' ing by the famous Flemish master,
; Peter Paul Rubens, has been pur
chased by the M. H. de Young Me
morial Museum in San Francisco's
Golden Gate Park.
The large painting was executed in
1612 during the period that marked
| the beginning of Ruben's artistic
maturity. In a remarkable state of
preservation, it is now being dis
played inside the entrance of the
' park museum.
The warm reds, ambers, and
browns, and the contrasting gray
and blue tones of the painting are
1 considered some of the best examples
of Ruben's own brushwork of the
period when Rubens himself worked
| on his canvases from conception to
completion.
Students are invited to visit the
museum to see the newest addition
to the major works of art being ac
j quired through the years.
