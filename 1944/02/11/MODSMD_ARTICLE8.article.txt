# ALLIES HOLD BEACHHEAD GRIMLY
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP) â€” Under-
Secretary of War Robert P. Patter
son today painted a grim, but not
hopeless, picture of the Allied situ
ation on the beachhead below Rome.
He told a news conference that the
danger to American and British
troops "is not to be minimized"; that
the Germans have thrown a "formid
able force" into the vicious battle.
"Although the greatest weight of
the German counterattack is prob
ably yet to be felt," he said, "our

men are firmly established and have
substantial aerial protection, subject
in part to the weather."
He said the Allies had been forced
to yield slightly under the pressure
of the violent German blows but.
have beaten back the attack and
taken prisoners.
The formidable German force has
been drawn in part from reserves
behind the main southern front, to a
lesser extent from the Rome area,
and partly from northern Italy.
