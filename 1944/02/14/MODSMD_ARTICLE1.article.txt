Patrons last night of the "Tillson
Talkies" not only found out how
Cylde Beatty got out of his numerous
scrapes, but also as soon as the serial
was over witnessed the presentation
by Miss Natalie Burdick from the
University of California of a banner
—the symbol of Stanford's victory in
the recent bond contest.
The banner which Miss Burdick
handed to Dick Driscoll, ASSU pres
ident, was blue and gold with the
University of California emblem
upon it. Miss Burdick first con
gratulated Stanford in far exceeding
our original goal. Then she stated,
'"Stanford and Cal have not only
bought one bomber, but we bought
euoght bonds for two bombers with
a little ammunition to spare.
Miss Burdick explained why she

couldn't appear at the Frosh Fling
last Saturday night. She said that
California sales could not be totaled
in time for the banner presentation
that evening. She tried to telephone
Driscoll, but being unable to reach
him, left instructions to call her.
Through no fault of hers, these in
structions were not followed.
Miss Burdick closed her speech
saying, "I hope you'll remember what
this banner represents—our share in
the Fourth War Loan."
When Driscoll accepted the ban
ner, he told Stanford students, "Our
part in the contest shows that Stan
ford spirit is still very much alive."
Driscoll announced that the banner
will be displayed in the nitery.
The results of the bond contest,
climaxed by the banner presentation,
were the sale by Stanford of $185,-

18G1.10 worth of bonds and stamps
land by California of $194,912.50.
j Both schools went way over their
' original quotas, and according to the
population ratio, Stanford's total far
j exceeded that of the Bears'. The two
schols boosted the Fourth War Loan
drive by over a half million dollars,
i totaling the maturity value of the
! bonds sold.
Dick Driscoll headed the Stanford
fight from Feb. 1 to 5. The second
day Stanford led California by $25,-
000. The Ihird day found the Farm
still out in front. California then
asked for a change in population
ratio which was granted by Stanford.
Driscoll announced, moreover, that
the Farm would attempt to buy the
$100,000 bomber unaided by Cal
sales. Cal climbed steadily in the
last two days of the drive

Patrons last night of the "Tillson
Talkies" not only found out how
Cylde Beatty got out of his numerous
scrapes, but also as soon as the serial
was over witnessed the presentation
by Miss Natalie Burdick from the
University of California of a banner
—the symbol of Stanford's victory in
the recent bond contest.
The banner which Miss Burdick
handed to Dick Driscoll, ASSU pres
ident, was blue and gold with the
University of California emblem
upon it. Miss Burdick first con
gratulated Stanford in far exceeding
our original goal. Then she stated,
'"Stanford and Cal have not only
bought one bomber, but we bought
euoght bonds for two bombers with
a little ammunition to spare.
Miss Burdick explained why she

couldn't appear at the Frosh Fling
last Saturday night. She said that
California sales could not be totaled
in time for the banner presentation
that evening. She tried to telephone
Driscoll, but being unable to reach
him, left instructions to call her.
Through no fault of hers, these in
structions were not followed.
Miss Burdick closed her speech
saying, "I hope you'll remember what
this banner represents—our share in
the Fourth War Loan."
When Driscoll accepted the ban
ner, he told Stanford students, "Our
part in the contest shows that Stan
ford spirit is still very much alive."
Driscoll announced that the banner
will be displayed in the nitery.
The results of the bond contest,
climaxed by the banner presentation,
were the sale by Stanford of $185,-

18G1.10 worth of bonds and stamps
land by California of $194,912.50.
j Both schools went way over their
' original quotas, and according to the
population ratio, Stanford's total far
j exceeded that of the Bears'. The two
schols boosted the Fourth War Loan
drive by over a half million dollars,
i totaling the maturity value of the
! bonds sold.
Dick Driscoll headed the Stanford
fight from Feb. 1 to 5. The second
day Stanford led California by $25,-
000. The Ihird day found the Farm
still out in front. California then
asked for a change in population
ratio which was granted by Stanford.
Driscoll announced, moreover, that
the Farm would attempt to buy the
$100,000 bomber unaided by Cal
sales. Cal climbed steadily in the
