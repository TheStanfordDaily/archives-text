"The Winds of Freedom Are Blowing."
This is the motto of Stanford University, and
it is doubtful that any university could have a
finer one; nor do many universities that are
in any way comparable to Stanford offer the
freedom which we are given here.
The best part of our freedom is that it's posi
tive, not negative. And the Honor Code is a
means by which we express that kind of free
dom.
A negative freedom is a freedom hom some
thing, and a freedom which does not entail
responsibility. It's the kind of freedom we talk
about when we mention freedom from fear or
freedom from want. It's the kind of freedom
which cannot be built up; it is a freedom handed
to us which we accept gratefully yet passively.
"Freedom froms" are fine things to have, but
a positive freedom is far superior.
A positive freedom is a freedom to do some
thing. It is elastic, and we may make of it what
we will because it isn't a passive thing that's
granted us. It's something we're given the
privilege of expanding at our will. It's like
freedom of speech, which isn't anything at all
unless we take advantage of it by talking. It's
like freedom of worship, which is worthless
unless each of us makes use of it by worship
ping as we please.
And so, as we fill out our blue books and turn
in our papers and finally leave Stanford, it is
our privilege to know that we knew a fifth
freedom. Think about it, appreciate it, and con
tinue to know that it's ours to be proud of and
ours to build.
