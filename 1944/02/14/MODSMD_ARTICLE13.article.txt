To the Editor:
And to 2C and all the rest of the girls who feel
the same way:
Your letter in the Daily Thursday was so
true, and I think there are many girls on the
campus who feel the same way, even those who
know how Stanford used to be.
I'd like to show you all the possibilities of
having more dances and get-togethers such as
the one a week ago Friday night. It isn't up to

the same two or three groups always to put
on the social functions around here. If a group
of girls like 2C want more fun, they shouldn't
sit around and wait for it to be planned for them,
but should get out and do something about it
themselves.
The dance weekend before last didn't re
guire an abundance of planning—just a few
people to get things going and the spirit of the
entire student body to back it up. Stanford spirit
should not be a spasmodic affair promoted by a
few; it is something permanent, to be kept alive
at all times by all Stanford men and women.
The opportunities are many.
The Stanford Canteen is for every single per
son who belongs to Stanford. We have tried to
show you how much fun can be had in there
with a minimum of effort and planning but with
just a little organization. Every night last week
something went on in the Nitery; there were
great turnouts for every event.
When the Kappas took over, you couldn't get
in the door; when the Gaieties cast provided
the entertainment, you couldn't get near the
door. Those that came to the community sing,
put on by the community music class, didn't
want to leave when it was over. I think you'll
admit they were all successful and great fun.
Every weekend, Saturday afternoon, Saturday
night, and Sunday afternoon we ask three dif
ferent living groups (Roble by corridors) to be
hostesses in the Canteen. The original plan was
for these girls to plan some kind of a get-to
gether such as those mentioned above. We
invite them far enough in advance so that they
can announce their plans in the Daily, which,
with enough spirit by the girls themselves,
would insure a large attendance. Keeping the
place clean and maintaining good standards of
conduct go hand in hand with fun.
It isn't very hard; in fact it's a lot of fun. If
you want to serve cookies and doughnuts, an
other terrific selling point, chip in a nickel or a
dime apiece and buy enough to keep the party
going. There are even many living groups will
ing to donate them as demonstrated by their
wonderful cooperation in the past. You don't
have to have a band; the nickelodian will satisfy
many.
But get on the beam right now. Don't wait for
someone else. If you really want to take over
the Canteen right away, before you're asked,
let lulie Cook know. She'll be only too glad to
let you be the next group up.
This is one way to keep the informal get
togethers going, and most of all the good old
Stanford spirit. Believe me, things will be a
lot like they used to be.—Caiol Huiwitz
