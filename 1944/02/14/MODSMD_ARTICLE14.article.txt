### JEAN LEVINSON 
TO MY VALENTINE
Here's to you, my Valentine,
My love, my life, my all.
Son, you ain't no pal o' mine,
You've got too darn much gall.
You're as cold as winter quarter,
You're as icy as the lake,
Do things you hadn't oughter,
Never give a gal a break.
You ask me to go buzzin'
Along the countryside,
But why, oh why, li'l cousin,
Do we always walk, not ride?
You think it's fun to sit and talk,
And drink an ice cold coke;
But son, you needn't sit and gawk,
It's 'cause you're always broke.
You've never heard of Emily Post,
Your manners are all shot,
You look like a piece of old cold toast,
And you've got more crust, by Gott.
So here's to you, my Valentine,
My mildewed four-leaf clover.
We're all washed up, oh Pal 'o mine,
'Cause things are tough all over!
