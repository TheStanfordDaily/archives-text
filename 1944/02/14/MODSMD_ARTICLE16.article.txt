## Johnny Fulton Wins 1,000-Yard Run at Boston A.A. Tournament 
### ROGER GORMAN 
Continuing his string of victories in the Eastern indoor track circuit,
Johnny Fulton, of Stanford and the Olympic Club, won the Lapham 1,000-
yard run at the Boston A.A. games Saturday night.
Fighting off a last-minute surge by Marine Private Joe Nowicki of the
University of Rochester, Fulton finished five yards out in front in the

comparatively slow time of 2:1248.
Taking an early lead and holding it,
Fulton ran what was acclaimed the
best race of the night.
The-victory was the second straight
for the West Coast flash, who came

from nowhere a week ago to take the
600-yard run at the Milrose A.A.
games in New York.
Dodds Coasts to Victory
Gil Dodds, of Boston, ran virtually
alone to turn in the fastest indoor
mile ever recorded in Boston, 4:09.5.
Taking a commanding lead on the
third lap, the Flying Parson was
never threatened, and finished 15
yards ahead of National Indoor Mile
Champ Bill Hulse.
The race disappointed the more
than 11,000 fans who had turned out
in hopes of seeing a tight duel be
tween Dodds and Hulse, but saw a
walk away instead.
Hunter Wins Easily
Ensign Ollie Hunter of Columbia
coasted to victory in the two-mile,
comfortably ahead of Notre Dame's
Tommy Quinn and Coast Guardsman
Clayton Sparrer, in 9:22.4.
