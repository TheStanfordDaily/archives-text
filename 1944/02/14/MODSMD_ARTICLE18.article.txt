# MURAL BASKETBALL
## Roble Hashers Meet Fillmore; Lincoln Takes on Gerona A.C. 
### JOK ZUKIN 
As the fourth week of the intra
mural basketball season begins to
night, there will be two top games
on tap that really should prove to be
wild and wooly contests.
Ruble vs. Fijlmore
Getting the tip-oft' in the Encina |
Gim at 7:15 are the Roble Hashers
and Fillmore. This is sure to be g
hot tilt, for both teams concerned are
top-notchers in this league, and
should display plenty of sparkling
and talented floor play. Roble has
six wins and no losses to its credit,
while Fillmore has been credited
with only one defeat, and that one
being at the hands of the Med School
Lincoln vs. Gerona
The other game which deserves
honorable mention is the Lincoln vs.
Gerona A.C. contest. Although the
game probably won't have much
bearing on the final standings, it is
bound to be a good one because the
two teams are so evenly matched.
Both have the same percentage as j
far as standings go with four wins |
and two losses apiece. Either team |

could easily take the game, but judg
ing by past performances Lincoln
deserves the slight edge in this one
and should take it by not more than
four or five points. The game is be
ing played at 8:15 in the Pavilion.
Looking at the remainder of the
week, we find the McKinley A vs.
Fillmore tussle, and the Med School-
Firehouse contest looming as two
thrillers. All four teams have good
outfits and good records to show for
it, and these tilts should produce
some good basketball.
