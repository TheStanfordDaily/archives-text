ALLIED HEADQUARTERS. NAPLES, Feb. 13â€”With their aerial rapport
restored, the Allies went back over to the offense today on the bloody
Rome beachhead and on the Cassino front prepared to shell the German
fortified Monte Cassino Abbey despite a papal plea that it be spared.
The most encouraging report on the beachhead situation in five days

said it was now "generally satis
factory" as the Allies delivered
heavy attacks in the Carocetta area
which had changed hands three
times in 24 hours of fierce see-saw
battle.
(A German - controlled Scandi
navian telegraph report through
Stockholm said that Mark W. Clark's
armored spearhead had broken
through the German barrage in the
Carocetta area and now were storm
ing the Main Nazi infantry position.)
The Germans were hitting back
savagely, using flame-thrower tanks
for the first time on the beachhead
front, but were repulsed with the
loss of two of those weapons.
