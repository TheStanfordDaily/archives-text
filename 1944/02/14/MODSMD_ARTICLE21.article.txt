# Farnsworth To Give Race Relations Talk
## 
### 
Dr. Paul Randolph Famsworth, head of the psychology department, will
speak Wednesday at 4:45 in the Women's Clubhouse for the Race-Relations
group of the Y. He will give the first of a series of lectures devoted to a
clarification of the racial problem.
Dr. Farnsworth's subject will be "The Psychology of Inherited Racial

Characteristics." He will explain the
basis for the white man's prejudice
against other racial groups, and how
justifiable this prejudice is according
to present-day scientific knowledge.
Miss Dodie Crile, president of the
Race-Relations group, urges all stu
dents interested in the race problem
to attend the meeting.
Miss Crile stated, "We want our
meetings to have as much practical
application as possible. We would
like first to eliminate any racial dis
crimination that we have on our own
campus."
This series of lectures, which the
YWCA is featuring, will include
speeches by a member of the sociol
ogy department and by a missionary
worker.
