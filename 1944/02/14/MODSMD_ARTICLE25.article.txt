GOVERNMENT GIRL—Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
R-K-O-'s "Government Girl" has
! all the ingredients (the red-tape and
bottlenecks of war-time Washington)

of a cracker-jack
comedy, but (here
we go again) the
film succeeds in
being amusing
only by the hard
work of the strug
gling cast, headed
by Olivia deHavil
land and Sonny
Tufts.
Miss deHavilland
is seen as dollar-

I a-year man Sonny Tufts' secretary
and spends most of her time in get
| ting the confused Mr. Tufts out of
! Senate investigations and the like.
; The pair naturally fall in love during
' the course of the picture and the final
j fade-out finds them in happy con
j templation of marital bliss.
Miss deHavilland is a very much
bewildered and dazed secretary and
has a difficult time in handling her
role, while the virile Mr. Tufts has a
lusterless part in the proceedings.
James Dunn and Anne Shirley are
amusing in an incidental romance.
"The Avengers," an English-made
| film released by Paramount, is a
| war-torn picturization of life in
I Norway under Nazi rule. Ralph
j Richardson heads the cast and does
an excellent job. '"The Avengers,"
however, loses much of its potential
strength in appealing to the emotions
rather than the intellect.
Everybody save your pennies, be
| cause Wednesday will be a really
great day in your lives. Yes, you
guessed it. Dashing Richard Arlen
; and alluring Jean Parker appear in
| their newest triumph, "Minesweep
er." This reviewer can hardly wait.
