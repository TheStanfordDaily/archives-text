The last performance of the pre
miere production of "Young Man of
Today" will be held tonight at 8:15
in the Little Theater of Memorial
Hall. There are still a few tickets
left which may be purchased at the
box office of the theater for 85 cents.
The play was presented four times
last week to appreciative audiences;
and it seems to be the consensus of
opinion of the cast that either they or
the audience get better with each
performance.
When asked her opinion of the
Stanford Players production of
"Young Man of Today," Authoress

thought they had done an unusually
good job and she was very pleased
with both the acting and F. Cowles
