# Two o'Clock Cultural Leaves Clarified by Dede DeFriest
## 
### 
The following information on the
newly granted 2 o'clock culturals has
j been announced by Dede DeFriest,
chairman of Women's Council, in the
hope that it will clear up a number
! of questions concerning their use.
Two o'clock culturals have been
provided for all women so that they
may attend plays, concerts, ballets,
or symphonies. They may have two
of them during the quarter ft>v this
purpose only.
New lower division women and all
those with an academic average of
less than "C" are allowed these two
additional cultural leaves. Old lower
division women and those in upper
division with at least a "C" average
I may convert any two of their 1:30
floaters into 2 o'clock culturals dur
ing the quarter.
Obtain Permission
Permission for all these culturals
must be obtained from the Chairman
of Women's Council two days before
they are to be used. For example,
permission for a Saturday night cul
â–  tural must be obtained by 2 p.m.
Thursday, and for a Sunday night
cultural by 2 p.m. Friday. Culturals
will not be granted unless this pro
cedure is followed, according to Dede

DeFriest.
If a girl who has permission for a
2 o'clock cultural returns before
1:30 or finds that she is not even

I going after all it still counts as one
of her culturals, unless, in the latter
case, she cancels it with Council by
j 2 p.m. on the day it was to be taken.
; Honor Code Applies
However, if a girl taking a 2
| o'clock finds that she can return be-
I fore that time, she should do so, for
1 using a cultural for any other rea
| son than the four designated is
| termed an Honor Code violation and
; will be handled as such by Women's
I Council.
These culturals can not be turned
into overnights, and Council will
handle any lockouts incurred in their
use.
Trial Period
Given on a trial basis this quarter,
the experiment's success or failure is
to be judged by Women's Conference
at the end of the quarter when they
will decide whether it will be con
tinued or not.
Girls should phone Dede DeFriest
in Room 1 of the Old Union, Monday
through Friday between 1 and 2, to
obtain permission for the 2 o'clocks
or to ask any questions concerning
their use. Her telephone number is
GB2l. Miss DeFriest requests that
you phone at this time only, except
I in the case of an emergency.
