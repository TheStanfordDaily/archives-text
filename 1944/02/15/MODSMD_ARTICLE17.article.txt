# Ask the Professor

### 
DO I have to make a footnote for every single
piece of information I get out of a book? Can
I get any kind of help from another person in
my class on homework assignments? Just what
does this prof think about the Honor Code and
its application to this particular course?
These are the kinds of guestions that sooner
or later pop up in the heads of almost every
student, and they seldom are answered. But
there's no reason why they shouldn't be be
cause if a professor were asked these guestions,
he probably would be glad to answer them.
It is a professor's responsibility to explain
to his class his feelings about the Honor Code
and also to explain any particular ways in which
the code may apply to the subject.
But students have a responsibility, too, a
responsibility which they often forget. And
that is to ask the professor. Students show no
hesitation in asking if the world will have a
police system or whether or not the soldier
vote bill will go through, and so why not ask
about the Honor Code?
Tom Martzloff, chairman of the Honor Code
standing committee, has contacted all faculty
members, and has asked them to realize their
responsibility. He can't contact each of us;
but he's trusting in the well-known American
guality of initiative.
