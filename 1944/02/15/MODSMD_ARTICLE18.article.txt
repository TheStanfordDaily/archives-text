# Whither The Daily?
## 
### 
THE DAILY may suspend publication—for a !
week, perhaps for the duration, unless Stan- j
ford students help bolster the personnel of the :
Daily business staff.
A newspaper is essentially a business prop- !
osition, and no business can continue to operate j
at a loss; at present, the Daily is operating at a
loss.
Funds for Daily publication are derived from
two sources: (1) advertising; (2) student body !
fees. Income from these sources has dropped '
during the past months for two reasons: (1) i
student body fees come only from civilian

registrants; the Army contributes only a small
amount to the Daily. (2) loss of business staff
personnel has cut the advertising income.
The business staff has not had the people to
sell ads, to write advertising copy, or to do the
general office work necessary in the conduct of
newspaper business.
Tomorrow night the business staff will hold
a meeting in the Daily shack at 7:15. Kay Ham
mond, business manager, will explain in greater
detail the problems that confront everyone con
cerned with the publication of your newspaper.
Business knowledge is not necessary to help
—if you have the time, and the inclination,
there will be plenty for you to do.
