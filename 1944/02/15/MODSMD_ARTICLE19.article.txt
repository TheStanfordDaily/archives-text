STANFORD army students "caught" smoking
on Quad are in danger of expulsion from the
AST program. In some instances army students
actually have been expelled. This extraor
dinarily severe punishment is a rule made by
the Army in deference to a time-honored Stan
ford tradition.
Yet many Stanford civilians, men and women,
some faculty members, cheerfully puff away
as they stroll down the Quad, serene in their
knowledge that they will not be expelled from
the University for an infraction of so intangible
a concept as a "tradition."
This practice is justly resented by army
students. The rules of conduct by which they
are forced to live, in respect to the Stanford
tradition of no smoking on Quad, are only justi
fiable if Stanford civilians observe their own
tradition.â€”Dave Davis
