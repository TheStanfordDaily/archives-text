### JEAN LEVINSON 
MY DAY
Dear Eleanor,
I am a war worker. I work in a defense plant
doing real important, vital, necessary work.
I'm glad to do it for my country. I feel that I
am doing my part in winning the war. I work
hard. I enjoy it. My fellow workers are most
chummy and I enjoy working with them.
I work on the graveyard shift and don't get
home until the morning time. I don't mind it
because I feel I'm doing my share. I also save
waste-fats and old tin cans. I enjoy doing it. I
also give my blood. I enjoy doing it because
I feel that they need it.
You would not think that I would have a
real important, vital problem. I have. I don't
enjoy it. I'm real rich. I make lots of money
and like to. I spend my money fast because
I feel I am doing my part in keeping it in circu
lation. I still have money left over. Lots of it.
I'm filthy rich.
I buy all sorts of things. I have fourteen gold
fillings. I even own a pivot tooth. I'm lucky.
I have fur coats for good. I even have fur
coats to rough it in and go shopping in. I have
platinum bobby-pins. I enjoy them. I eat caviar
sandwiches and drink champagne for lunch
every day. I'm getting sick.
I have bought up all the War Bonds I can.
For exercise I count my greenbacks. I have
scads. I have all the jewelry my mansion can
hold. It's pretty.
I buy everything I can but I still have lots and
lots of money left over. It's terrible. I buy and
buy but I still can't use up half of my earnings.
I'm reeking with lucre. I'm rich as all get out.
Help me. I'm very sad. What can I do with
all my extra money.
Financially yours,
Clarissa Cash.
Dear Miss Cash:
Are you kidding? '
Longingly,
Eleanor.
