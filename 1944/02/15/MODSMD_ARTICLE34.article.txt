Though spring is still more than
a month away, plenty of baseball
headlines have been gracing the
sports pages of Pacific Coast daily
newspapers for the past week or two.
Yesterday's headline concerned the
possible transfer of the Pacific Coast
League franchise of the Sacramento
Solons to Tacoma.
Not so long ago, Sacramento used
to be a pretty good little baseball
town. In fact, it was only two sea
sons ago that the Solons took five
straight games in their final series
with the Angels to nose out Los An
geles by one game and earn the first
pennant in Sacramento history.
The blame for the all-time low in
terest shown by Sacramento fans last
year rests with the St. Louis Cax-di
nals farm system, of which the Sac
ramento club has the misfortune to
be a member.
After the phenomenal success of
the 1942 Sacramento nine, the parent
organization should at least have
provided a squad which would make
a decent showing in defense of its
title in Instead of giving the
fans a run for their money, however,
the Card organization proceeded to
break up the winning combination
of 1942.
The majority of the stars on the
1942 team were not sent up to the
majors; they were merely trans
ferred to another Cardinal Double-
A farm club, Rochester in the Inter
national League. Pepper Martin,
fiery and popular manager, was
among those who left Sacramento
for Rochester.
The new Sacramento manager last
year was left with a pitiful aggrega
tion of youngsters to work with. He
was fortunate to win as many ball
games as he did. The attendance at
games in the capital city dropped to
less than 100 fans on some occasions,
and prompted Bob Stevens of the
Chronicle to use the appropriate
dateline "Lonesome Valley" on some
of his dispatches from the Sacra
mento Ball Park.
We personally don't care whether
the Sacramento franchise is trans
ferred to Tacoma or to new man
agement by Sacramento people;
however, we do feel that it would
be in the best interests of baseball on
the Coast to transfer it out of the
hands of the Cardinal organization.

for Rochester.
The new Sacramento manager last
year was left with a pitiful aggrega
tion of youngsters to work with. He
was fortunate to win as many ball
games as he did. The attendance at
games in the capital city dropped to
less than 100 fans on some occasions,
and prompted Bob Stevens of the
Chronicle to use the appropriate
dateline "Lonesome Valley" on some
of his dispatches from the Sacra
mento Ball Park.
We personally don't care whether
the Sacramento franchise is trans
ferred to Tacoma or to new man
agement by Sacramento people;
however, we do feel that it would
be in the best interests of baseball on
the Coast to transfer it out of the
hands of the Cardinal organization.
