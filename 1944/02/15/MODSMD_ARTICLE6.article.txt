Having traveled to Japan five

praise Japanese power.

faculty member of Hokkaido Im- |
perial University at Sappuro. During 1
his stay in the Far East he gained j
first - hand information concerning !
Japan's blueprint for world domi- ;
nation.
When asked if he would draw any j
conclusions as to how soon we will ,
beat Japan, Mr. Lory declared, "I
am a pessimist. We are certainly go

j ing to have a long, drawn-out, difli
j cult conflict once we defeat Germany
and begin with Japan."
Mr. Lory will be introduced by
j William L. Schwartz, assistant pro
! fessor of the Romanic Languages
j Department, and lecturer in Jap-
I anese.
The speaker will base his lecture
I on his experiences, giving the Tues
â–  day Evening Series audience an au
| thentic picture of Japan today.
