# No Unpermitted Aid . . ."

"NO unpermitted aid given or received—nor
unreported violations observed."
The last part of the pledge is an addition. It
is an addition to the Honor Code pledge sug
gested by certain Stanford students because
they felt it would help them remember the third
person responsibility; and they feel that the
third-person responsibility is a hard part of the
Honor Code to maintain.
In high school, or at least in certain high
schools, the student who didn't see the point of
group cooperation in tests was nothing more
than a "worm." It was a perfectly natural thing
to let the kid next to you see your paper if he
got stuck, and you expected the same help from
him.
Then we came to Stanford and learned that
Stanford lived by another code, a code which
stressed personal honor and responsibility and
also group responsibility—(a very different kind
of group responsibility fiom the one we knew
in high school).
And so, because we realized this code was
something fine and far above our previous one,
we signed our names to the pledge in our reg
booklets and became Stanford students.
But a lot of us had trouble about the third
person responsibility. It looked very much as
though we were expected to tattle, and that's
just what we'd always been told not to do.
However, reporting an Honor Code violation,
either through the person involved or directly
to the councils, is an entirely different matter.
What our parents meant when they told us
not to be tattle-tales is exemplified by a situa
tion like this:
Dan and Joe are playing with a red wagon.
Dan decides Joe shouldn't play with the wagon;
he grabs it and takes it off where he can have
it to himself. Joe runs into the house and tells
Mama Dan stole his wagon.
Tattling was not their way of solving the
problem, and Joe had no good reason for run
ning to his mother.
Obviously, reporting an Honor Code violation
does not even fall into the same category, be
cause when a student reports a violation, he's
get reason to- responsibility to himself and to
the violator:
To himself, because if it becomes known that
Stanford's Honor System is a farce, a Stanford
diploma becomes a stolen degree and a worth

less degree in the eyes of an employer; to the
other person, because if he goes through school
cheating he is-apt to find himself in a sorry fix
later on when he vitally needs some information
which he was supposed to have mastered at
Stanford.
And so, when you write out the pledge, think
of what it means. And even if you have your
own particular abbreviation of the pledge, such
as "no aid" or "Honor Code observed," re
member what you mean by that abbreviation.
Remember particularly what the last part means.
"NO unpermitted aid given or received—nor
unreported violations observed."

which he was supposed to have mastered at
Stanford.
And so, when you write out the pledge, think
of what it means. And even if you have your
own particular abbreviation of the pledge, such
as "no aid" or "Honor Code observed," re
member what you mean by that abbreviation.
Remember particularly what the last part means.
"NO unpermitted aid given or received—nor
unreported violations observed."
The last part of the pledge is an addition. It
is an addition to the Honor Code pledge sug
gested by certain Stanford students because
they felt it would help them remember the third
person responsibility; and they feel that the
third-person responsibility is a hard part of the
Honor Code to maintain.
In high school, or at least in certain high
schools, the student who didn't see the point of
group cooperation in tests was nothing more
than a "worm." It was a perfectly natural thing
to let the kid next to you see your paper if he
got stuck, and you expected the same help from
him.
Then we came to Stanford and learned that
Stanford lived by another code, a code which
stressed personal honor and responsibility and
also group responsibility—(a very different kind
of group responsibility fiom the one we knew
in high school).
And so, because we realized this code was
something fine and far above our previous one,
we signed our names to the pledge in our reg
booklets and became Stanford students.
But a lot of us had trouble about the third
person responsibility. It looked very much as
though we were expected to tattle, and that's
just what we'd always been told not to do.
However, reporting an Honor Code violation,
either through the person involved or directly
to the councils, is an entirely different matter.
What our parents meant when they told us
not to be tattle-tales is exemplified by a situa
tion like this:
Dan and Joe are playing with a red wagon.
Dan decides Joe shouldn't play with the wagon;
he grabs it and takes it off where he can have
it to himself. Joe runs into the house and tells
Mama Dan stole his wagon.
Tattling was not their way of solving the
problem, and Joe had no good reason for run
ning to his mother.
Obviously, reporting an Honor Code violation
does not even fall into the same category, be
cause when a student reports a violation, he's
get reason to- responsibility to himself and to
the violator:
To himself, because if it becomes known that
Stanford's Honor System is a farce, a Stanford
diploma becomes a stolen degree and a worth

less degree in the eyes of an employer; to the
other person, because if he goes through school
cheating he is-apt to find himself in a sorry fix
later on when he vitally needs some information
which he was supposed to have mastered at
Stanford.
