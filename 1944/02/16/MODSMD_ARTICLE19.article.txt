### JEAN LEVINSON 
Have you been in a doctor's office lately?
Have you waited for two hours to see your
favorite medico? I have, and it's a brutal ex
perience.*
Being an inveterate hypochondriac, I de
cided to have my physician take a look at my
prize hangnail, and dragged an unwilling com
panion along. We entered the chamber of wait
ing and seated ourselves in the most comfort
able seats and waited. And I do mean waited.
Soon running out of conversation about oper
ations and incurable diseases, we took refuge
in the abundant supply of magazines. Here
was fascinating reading material.
Time announced that Lincoln had been as
sassinated; Life had vivid pictures of the Wright
Brothers and their sensational new invention
.... the flying machine; Vogue prophesied that
women that took to cigarette smoking would
lead a life of sin; Photoplay voted Theda Bara
the most promising actress of the year.
By this time the office had become crowded
with patients of all forms and sizes. An un
comfortable silence reigned as each individual
tried to be nonchalant and at ease. But pairs
of eyes focused on other eyes, and soon every
one was hypnotizing everyone else. More
conversation seemed the only way out.
My friend turned to me and whispered: "Have
you heard what happened to poor old Brun
hilda? Why she . . . and the voice of my
buddy carried through the tomb-like room and
bounced back and forth on the walls. Everyone
had cocked their ears in readiness, and now
lapsed back into staring again.
An anemic youth of eight was carving his
name in the table for posterity to view, when he
was seized with a violent attack of hiccoughs.
"Hie" he pronounced emphatically at half
second intervals. After the 94th "hie," his loving
father bundled him off to the drinking fountain.
Peace reigned again.
"I can't stand it," said I, jumping up and down,
"I can't stand it!"
And so we left the lump of ill humanity star
ing at each other in the waiting room.
I no longer bothered about my hangnail, for
a manicure could speedily cure it, but what did
trouble me was the violent migraine, head cold,
and sore throat I had acquired within the two
hours waiting for le docteur to make an
entrance.
