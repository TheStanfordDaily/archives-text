# Red Cross To Offer Recreational Course
## 
### 
The Red Cross of Palo Alto Is offering a new training course in recrea
tional skills, in preparation for work at the Dibble General Hospital,
which will be open to all interested and qualified Stanford women. This
Recreation Corps, consisting of women from 21 to 35 years, will wear the
corps uniform and will be assigned to regular evening or weekend hours for

♦•duty at the hospital.
The duties of these volunteers will
j consist of amusing and cheering up
i the patients who are able to walk
about within the hospital by way of
games, cards, music, group singing,
informal parties, and, if the hoped
for dance floor becomes a reality,
j small dances.
Women who play piano, or have
j special talents with games and group
; leadership are especially welcome,
| but any young women who are
| cheerful, tactful, and interested, can
i easily be trained under this new
| course, according to the women who
I are presenting the course.
The training course, which will be
! devoted to hospital requirements,
regulations for both workers and
soldier patients, and simple tech
j niques, will begin soon and will last
for two two-hour sessions. This
■ course will be open to 68 women
j from Redwood City, San Mateo, and
Palo Alto.
All interested women should reg
i ister with their local chapter and
| arrange for an interview there. Those
| specially adapted to the work will be
! selected for interviews with Mrs.
Mabel Hargrove, Red Cross Field
Director at Dibble.
The procedure suggested for those
interested is to call P.A. 22144 to
register, or to talk with Mrs. Van
; Bergen or Mrs. Carmean at 25 Uni
versity avenue in Palo Alto. Mrs.
McMullin, Red Cross public relations
| chairman, advises prompt registry,
| "since quotas are small and lots of
folks want to work in that hospital."
