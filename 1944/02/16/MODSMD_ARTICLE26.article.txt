## Medics Hit Century Mark, Smother McKinley B, 100-31 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Piling up the largest score that has been recorded thus far in the intra
mural basketball league, the Med School five hit the century mark right
on the nose last night when they whipped the cellar position team of the
league, McKinley B, by a score of 100 to 31.
The medics accomplished this amazing feat with the aid of only four men

on the court, and obviously con-"*
trolled the ball throughout the entire |
game. Most of the tussle featured
long throws, usually covering the J
whole length of the court. Whenever j
fhe Medics got the ball out, they al- |
ways had a man sitting under the
basket waiting to get the casaba and :
lay it up on the board.
Gordon Holmes took the scoring j
honors by sinking 14 baskets for a !
total of 28 points. Following him |
were Dick Pehl and Wayne Price, j
both boys coming up for 25 of the j
total points. Being low man with 22 !
points was John Malloy, who de- !
voted most of his time to the de- j
fensive type of play, as you can see [
by his low score.
Top man on the McKinley ag- |
gregation was Bob Moore, who came <
through with 18 digits. Ho was fol- j
lowed by Don Davis with four points. |
In the other contest of the evening, j
Hayes Hall defaulted to Monroe. At
the time of this writing, the other
games had not been completed, so j
their scores will not appear.
In an extra practice game played
after the mural games, a Monroe Hall j
team made up of three Monroe A's
and two Monroe B's beat the Fire
house team 12-36.
