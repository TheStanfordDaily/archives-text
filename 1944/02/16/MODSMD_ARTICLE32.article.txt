### ROGER CORMAN 
The proud name of Stanford is
going into basketball competition
once more. Yes, the red and white
will wave again, as a Stanford team
takes to the hardwood. For the Stan
ford Laundry is sponsoring a team
in the current Pacific Association
basketball tournament at Kezar Pa
vilion in San Francisco.
If successful in the tourney, the
laundry lads will be entered in the
AAU championships in Denver. For
many years, the local cleaning es
tablishment has put forth teams, and
despite the critical manpower short
age, they are carrying on once more.
Stanford is back in the fray.
Johnny Fulton's trip East is really
paying oft", but if you've been follow
ing the stories of his victories in the
metropolitan dailies you've been
reading about John Fulton of San
Francisco or Johnny Fulton of the
Olympic Club, never Johnny Fulton
of Stanford. The reason behind this
apparent slip-up is that he isn't iep
resenting Stanford at all. Our policy
of no sports is prohibiting his on
trance as a Stanford runner, and
forcing him to become a member of
the Olympic Club
