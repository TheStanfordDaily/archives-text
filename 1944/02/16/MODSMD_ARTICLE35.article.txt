# Changes Made In One-Acts
## 
### 
Only two plays, instead of the
i usual three, will be presented in this
j year's Ram's Head One-Acts, an
j nounced Moofie Faris, general di
rector of production. The change has
been made because of the shortage of
stage materials and time, she added.
There have been some revisions in
j the cast list since it was last an
| nounced. Harrison Elliott, who left
, with the Foreign Area and Language
Group last week, has been replaced
j by Roger Brander in the role of
1 Chico in "Death in the Limelight."
j Stan Willis has also replaced Bill
Hyer in a supporting role in "Coast
to Coast."
Miss Faris requested that all stage
crews report to Ram's Head room to
| night at 7:30. She also said that there
i are still positions open on the stage,
I costume, prop, and make-up crews.
