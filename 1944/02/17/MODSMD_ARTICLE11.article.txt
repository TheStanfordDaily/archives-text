### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES, Feb. l(i (L'P) —American dive-bombers and
field artillery blasted Nazi positions in the ruins of Monte Cassino Abbey
today in a redoubled effort to clear the Rome road while Gen. Sir Harold
It. L. G. Alexander gave a ringing promise of victory in the beachhead battle
to the north.
At the end of today's aerial bombardment the artillery barrage against

♦■the monastery ceased with the de
struction of the abbey apparently
completed. Only a shapeless mass of
wreckage remained on the hill. How
ever, the collapsed sections of the
massive wall and the chambers be
neath the abbey still offered excel
lent cover for the Germans blocking'
the Allied break-through to the
plain.
Ground action also continued slack
on the beachhead front where weak
German jabs in little more than
patrol strength were easily thrown
back. But it was acknowledged that
the Germans for several days have
held Carroceto, 11 miles north of
Anzio, as well as the model farm
community of Aprilia, a half mile
east of Carroceto.
