WASHINGTON, Feb. 16 (UP) â€”
The embattled War Relocation Au

was transferred by presidential edict
from Director Dillon S. Meyer to
Secretary of Interior Harold L. Ickei.
The White House announcement
of the order did not specify Meyer's
future duties but Interior Depart
ment officials said he would work
under Ickes at least for the time
being.
