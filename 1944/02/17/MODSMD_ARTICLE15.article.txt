# Bullets and Ballots

### 
THE PROPOSED federal ballot for servicemen and women is a
complexity of intra-party friction, further complicated by the
problems involved in the question itself.
Early in the fight, progressive Democrats recognized the
political value in endorsing an Administration-backed bill for a
federal ballot, but the Democratic party would not support the
measure, as a party, because of opposition from Southern
Democratic leaders.
Republicans generally were opposed to the measure, arguing
"states' rights," but Republican senators perceived the political
implications of the Democratic moves and attempted to swing
the Republican party around to complete support of a federal
ballot.
This worked in the Senate, but the party split in the House
is so definite there appears to be little hope of reconciliation.
The political complexity is almost trivial, .however, in view
of the problems of the absentee ballot itself.
(1) Finding the voter; tracking down John Doe to New Guinea,
Salerno, the Anzio beachhead, or perhaps to an invasion point
on the western front.
(2) What kind of a ballot, if federal? A lightweight ballot,
with only the presidential, vice-presidential candidates? Shall
a ballot be sent listing all candidates for office, national, state,
and local?
(3) The distribution of any ballot, state or federal, would be a
difficult task; and, although the Army and Navy don't want the
job, if the services were given the distribution it would greatly
speed the sending and return of the ballots.
(4) Counting the eligible votes —state officials will, of course,
count the votes, but the qualification is "eligible." In some
Southern states, for example, the official might simply discount
as invalid the vote of a man registered as a Negro, or that of a
white man who has not paid his poll tax.
The present stew over the ballot may be a waste of political
and legislative energy, however—the percentage of servicemen
who want to vote, and who are eligible to vote, may be neg
ligible.—Dave Davis
