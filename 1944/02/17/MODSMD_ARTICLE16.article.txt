' I D NEVER turn in an Honor Code violator because they'd have
to go to Council."
This statement was made by a Stanford woman—a Stanford
woman who should have known better.
The two Councils, Men's and Women's, are not composed of
hard-hearted whip-crackers who take delight in making life un
happy for persons who have slipped and in some way violated
the Honor Code. They are composed of Stanford students, stu
dents not any different from the rest of us except that they have
been elected to positions of perhaps the highest responsibility
in campus government.
When an Honor Code violator appears before Council, she is
not regarded as a criminal. Her mistake is not made known to
anyone outside of Council members. Should she have been
turned in by someone else and not by herself, that third party
is never brought into the discussion. The whole affair is con
ducted within the Council room.
And should a person be accused who is innocent, what better
way to clear herself than to go before Council? Because a per
son appears before Council is in no way a sign that she has
violated the Code.
The Councils serve two purposes in regard to the Honor
Code:
They try to help persons who have committed a breach of the
Code; they try to clear those who have been unjustly accused.
The following is an excerpt of a letter written to Women's
Council by a Stanford woman who violated the Honor Code:
"I have certainly found out that you can run away from
almost anything—but you can't run away from yourself. There
is one thing that 1 must make clear. 1 did not turn myself in on
my own accord—l only wish that 1 could tz.ll you that I had,
but I was asked to by a girl to whom I will never be able to show
my full appreciation. She is a tribute to any university; and the
contrast between us, more than anything else, showed me what
a failure 1 had made of my college career."
