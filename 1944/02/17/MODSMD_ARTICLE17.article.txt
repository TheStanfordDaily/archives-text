# 'Race' Topic Of Y Lecture
## 
### 
The Race-Relations group of the Y
yesterday heard Dr. Paul Farnsworth
discuss innate racial differences and
the problems of race prejudice in
the world today. Dr. Farnsworth
explained that prejudice has grown
up as a means of justifying the dom
ination of one group by the other.
"Thus," he stated, "Hitler and Tojo's
new world orders are predicated on
the concept of the 'master race'."
Dr. Farnsworth told the Y mem
bers that the dominant group is
forced to build up rationalizations for
| their position. Such rationalizations
j as "inferior by divine order" and
j "genetic insufficiency" have often
j been advanced.
One of the points which Dr. Farns
worth stressed was that the term
"race" has often been confused with
other entirely unlike terms. Race
has. been made synonymous with
"nation" or with "linguistic group."
Often people living in a certain area
and called Mediterranean or Nordic
! groups have been thought of as a
â–  pure l ace.
Race today, according to Dr.
; Farnsworth, often refers to "in
j group" or "out-group." In the same
; way divergent peoples whom we
I tend to favor most are those who are
' most similar to ourselves.
Dr. Farnsworth mentioned that no
intelligence test has been discovered
that could prove conclusively innate
intelligence. Intelligence tests favor
environmental factors and therefore
are not a good standard for prov
ing one group superior or inferior to
another.
