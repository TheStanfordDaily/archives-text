# ‘Japan Our Worst Foe,’ Says H. Lory
## 
### 
"In the Japanese we face the !
toughest foe we have ever faced; and j
in the Americans the Japanese face |
the grimmest foe they ever faced," j
was the statement made by Humani- i
ties Lecturer Hillis Lory at the Tues
day Series this Tuesday night.
Both Japan and the United States j
underestimated the other before the •
war, according to Mr. Lory. Al
though Japan does not have the most j
abundant resources, she has them in j
the greatest variety. Japan is willing |
to lose 10.000,000 men in this war,
and has not yet drafted young men j
below 20 for military service.
Mr. Lory named Japan's lour rings :
of defense —the "stalling for time" !
ring of the Solomons, Gilberts, Mar- |
shalls, and Aleutians; the resources
ring of the Philippines, Dutch East
T ndies, Indo-China, Malaya, and
Surma.
The third ring is Japan's inner em- ;
pile — northern Manchuria, Korea, ;
the coast of China, and the Carolines, i
But "we have not completed the con- !
quest of Japan until we have con
quered the fourth ring, the islands of |
Japan."
