# Stanford Band Needs Players
## 
### 
At its practice tonight at 5 p.m.,
the Stanford Band will be preparing
for the Founder's Day program. The
recently organized band, under the
direction of Dr. Herbert Popper, is
still in need of percussion and
trumpet players before it can make a
good showing. Girls are now being
admitted to the band, and all people
who play instruments are asked to
turn out.
Twenty-five new instruments have
been ordered by the band in order
to facilitate the students who do not
have instruments, and to replace out
of-date band property.
The band is practicing such songs
as Star Dust, My Hero, and the Field
Artillery Song for the coming pro
grams.
