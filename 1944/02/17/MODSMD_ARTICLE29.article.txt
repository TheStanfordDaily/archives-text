| mural basketball last night and gave
| them a 34-28 win over Fillmore. Bc
| hind 22-26 with four minutes left,
McKinley's P.D.B.'s poured point
! after point into the basket until the
very end.

Chuck Stewart of Fillmore was the
j outstanding man on the floor, scoring
I 14 points for the losing cause. Doug
Horner again topped the P.D.B.'s
| with 12, while Bob Donohoe sank 11,
most of them long, one-handers
