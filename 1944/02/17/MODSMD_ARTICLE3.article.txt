# Organ Recital This Afternoon
## 
### 
D. Sterling Wheelwright, acting
University organist, will play a series
of instrumental preludes for the
regular organ- recital in the Memo
rial Chapel this afternoon at 5 p.m.
The program will open with Cho
pin's three preludes in E minor,
A major, and B minor, followed
by the organ Preludio, Sonata
No. 3 by Guilmant. The remaining
numbers will be selections from
Richard Wagnerâ€”Dreams (a Study
for Tristan and Isolde), the Prelude
to Act 1 of Lohengrin, and the Pre
lude to Act 111 of the same opera.
The class in Symphonic Master
works has been studying the de
velopments of Wagnerian musical
motifs and is, therefore, particu
larly interested in the three selec
tions from Lohengrin and Tristan and
Isolde. All members of this class will
be special guests at the recital and
may take seats in the organ gallery
before 5 o'clock.
There will be no organ recital on
Sunday. Feb. 20. at 5 p.m. However,
Mr. James Lawson will play a caril
lon concert in the Hoover War Li
brary from 5 to 5:30 next Sunday.
