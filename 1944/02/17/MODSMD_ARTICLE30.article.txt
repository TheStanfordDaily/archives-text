Basketball's biggest problem today
is the matter of the tall man, accord
ing to Jimmy St. Clair, chairman of
the National Rules Committee. Bruce
Drake, University of Oklahoma bas
betball coach, discusses the problem
thoroughly in his article "Seven Foot
Trouble," printed in the Feb. 1!) issue
of the Saturday Evening Post which
was released yesterday.
The problem centers around the
giants who camp near the basket on
defense and manage to rob the of
fense of a good many field goals by
reaching up and snaring the ball just
before it goes through the hoop.
Drake offers two possible solutions
to the problem. One is the adoption
of a rule which would award a field
goal to the offense when a de
fensive player touches a try-for-goal
above the level of the basket after
the ball has started its downward
arc. The other solution which Drake
offers is to raise the height of the
basket from 10 feet to 12 feet. Pliog
Allen, Kansas' great veteran coach,
has been advocating this for more
than a decade.
The Post has also printed the
opinions of six other experts on this
controversial problem. These six ex
perts include five Eastern men, four
of them coaches, and Stanford's bas
ketball coach, Everett Dean. Coach
Dean's statement is as follows:
"Basketball nee d s no drastic
changes, but the malady of the tall
man does require some attention by
the rule makers." The most logical
and sensible solution to the problem.
Coach Dean believes, is the proposal
that no defensive player be allowed
to touch a shot in its downward
flight. "However," Dean concludes,
"I would favor a research study by a
special committee first."
