# Krumbine Speaks To Chapel Board
## 
### 
In response to questions asked at
the Chapel Board meeting Tuesday
night, Miles Krumbine, visiting pas
tor from Shaker Heights Congrega
tional Church, Ohio, said that an
Anglo-American attempt to domi
nate the world at the end of the war
was possible. Pointing to the fact
that Britain and France have had
imperialistic days, it was very pos
sible that the United States might
also, if it is not already, "be bitten
by the domination bug."
The board also announced that the
first of the Sunday evening vespers
would be held next Sunday in the
choir room of the church from 7:15
to 8:15. Henry Costanzo, in charge
of the meetings, announced that Rev.
Robert Ansdale, pastor of the San
Mateo Presbyterian Church, will
speak. Reverend Ansdale graduated
from the San Francisco Theological
Seminary in 1942. Soldiers and ci
vilians are welcome at the vespers.
