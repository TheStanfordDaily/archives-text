# Police To Fine Quad Cyclists
## 
### 
All warnings having apparently
i failed, cyclists caught riding their
bicycles on the Quad in the future
may be stopped and given tickets by
campus policemen, it was announced
j by Men's Council last night.
Because of the numerous narrow
i escapes had by pedestrians occa
! sioned by cyclists speeding to and
j from classes on the Quad, a cam
j paign was started recently in The
Daily which, it was hoped, would
bring results. According to Police
| Chief Gordy Davis, however, there
has been no letup of the riding of
j bicycles on the Quad.
The Council also announced that
| fines imposed on offenders receiving
tickets would be stiff. It is hoped
that riders will recognize the danger
involved in cycling on Quad, and
J that campus policemen will thus be
' freed from policing the area.
