# The 						Army Way
## 
### 
IN A CLASS composed of only Army stu
dents or in a class composed of both civilian
and Army students, it is the privilege of the
soldier students to decide whether an exami
nation shall be proctored or taken under the
Honor system.
A proctor in the room makes no difference to
civilian students since the Honor Code is a
personal matter and exists regardless of con
ditions.
A soldier student has reasons, feasible and
understandable reasons, for wishing to have
proctored examinations.
The first thing he learns when he gets to
boot camp is that he doesn't "turn in" his bud
dies. If a soldier commits a wrong it's up to
an officer to report him.
Then, too, a misdemeanor committed by an
Army student is apt to result in more serious
punishment than would be dealt a civilian. A
soldier student probably would be separated
from the AST program; no soldier wants to
be responsible for the expulsion of another.
If an Army group should vote to be under
the Honor system, all violations of the Code
made by soldier students are to be handled
by a special court set up by and composed
of Army students.
It's up to civilian students to realize an
Army man's problem, respect his right to make
a choice, and then act accordingly.
