# Steam In The Boiler

IF UPHELD, Judge Butler's injunction forbid
ding Marinship from discharging colored work
ers who refuse to join an auxiliary to the Boiler
makers' union, and restraining the union from
denying membership in their regular union or
compelling Negroes to join the auxiliary, may
dccide once and for all whether or not a union
can dictate to the federal government.
Although a similar injunction issued last fall
was suspended when a three-man panel of
federal judges decided that a federal judge has
no jurisdiction in such a suit, this injunction
may be upheld, for there is a definite need to
break the union policy of discrimination in
membership.
Workers are needed to produce the machines
for war, and President Roosevelt early asked
that there be no discrimination in race, color,
or creed in the hiring of war workers.
His appeal had little effect, however, because
51 per cent of American manufacturers have
flatly refused to hire Negroes; of this percent
age many, of course, have closed-shop agree
ments with A. F. of L. craft unions which do
not admit Negroes. Even though federal war
contracts contained a "no discrimination"

clause, union agreements and general policy
have prevented the full utilization of Negro
workers.
The debate which will occur on this injunc
tion and its many ramifications must be con
fined to the issue, economic discrimination.
The Fourteenth Amendment assures that no
state may deprive a person of life, liberty, or
property; this statement should protect every
person in the United States from economic
discrimination.
But it is to be hoped that opportunist poli-i
ticians throughout the United States do not at-1
tempt to create a racial controversy; it is to
be hoped, but unfortunately, also expected.
