## "AMOUR, AMOUR, OR THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES" 
### JEAN LEVINSON Faith Birdwin 
(Our girl is accosted in the park by a dark
man who turns out to be Oliver, the Air Raid
Warden. Captivated by her charms he asks:)
"Pamela, come away with me to Mountain
View and we can ... be partners in the Rain
bow Girls' Whist Tournament. Come!"
Pamela somehow felt that this was a turn
ing point in her young life. To go or not to
go? She was madly in love with Oliverâ€”she
had openly confessed this love. But Christopher
was arriving any minute, and she longed to
see his ruddy face.
Turning limpid, moist, El Greco blue eyes
to Ollie, she bleated: "No, my heart, I must
rush home because Christopher is arriving
any minute from overseas. Bye."
Oliver gnashed his teeth, twitched his grace
fully dissected nose, gripped his Ever-Ready
Flashlight, and shuffled off into the gloom.
Pamela started home once again, and meet
ing no more men on the way, she finally went
home and so to bed. She was oh, so tired after
her exciting day, and soon wandered off jnto
a delicious slumber, and dreamt delicious
dreams.
She dreamed of Bongo and those wonderful
times on the island of Bali Wali. Tall palm
trees swaying gently in the tropical breeze;
turquoise waves lapping the fine, white sand;
the aroma of Skol and salt air; hot dogs and
poi; the glorious yellow Balinese moon, and
that heavenly trip with Bongo to the island
of Alcatrazi. Bongo . . . ah, so tanned and tall
and muscular . . . almost ape-like.
The bright morning sun spilled through the
window, and warmly caressed Pamela's face.
She lifted her head from the snow-white pillow,
and her tousled, honey-colored hair formed a
halo about her face. She was lovely this morn
ing, truly lovely.
As she was confirming this observation in
her well-worn mirror, the doorbell pealed and
interrupted her thoughts. Throwing on an ador
able housecoat, she gaily tripped all the way
down the stairs and threw open the oak-pan
eled door. It was Christopher!
"Chris, am I ever glad to see you ... do
come in."
Christopher showed that he was glad to see
Pam by roughly grabbing her in his arms and
planting one on her red, sensuous lips.
"Hiyah, Baby."
Before replying, Pam once again studied this
man she had not seen for fifteen months. He
was still as ruddy as ever, and his face was
the color of rare roast beef. Small, brown
freckles dotted his nose, and his front tooth was
missing. He was still as cute as all get out.
Christopher's breathing had become labored,
and his pulse was throbbing madly. He had
been overseas for fifteen months and was very
glad to see Pamela. He said:
"Baby, I'm glad to see you. It's been months
since I've seen a white woman. You know
what I'd really like to do more than anything
on this earth? Right now I'd like to .... "
