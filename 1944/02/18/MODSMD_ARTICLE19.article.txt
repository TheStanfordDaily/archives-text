Interested in Aviation
Aviation has been closely linked
with Miss McClanahan's college in
terests since she learned to fly on the
Stanford field several years ago. She
had considered joining the WAF's
before accepting the Washington of
fer, as she lacked only seven or eight
hours of solo flying time needed for
her license. Her enthusiasm for avia
tion had led her to friendly corre
spondence with Jacqueline Cochran,
foremost American aviatrix and
WAF leader.
Versatile and energetic, Miss Mc- j

Clanahan became the first woman
ASSU president in the summer of
1D43. Her unusual record in scholar
ship and activities at the University
had included an office of responsi
bility in each quarter of her four
years at Stanford.
