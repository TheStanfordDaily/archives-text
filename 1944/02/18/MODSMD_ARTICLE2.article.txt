# Navy Force Attacks Truk
## Truk, Jap Naval Base, Blasted by Task Force 
### 
U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HQ., Pearl
Harbor, Feb. 17 (UP). — Powerful
carrier task forces of the U.S. Navy
started an attack at dawn yesterday
on Truk, the great secret naval base
which is the heart of Japan's Pacific
empire, it was announced today, and
it was indicated that the attack
might still be in progress.
Hundreds of planes joined in at
tacks on two aircraft carriers and
more than twenty other warships
and supply ships believed at anchor
there and rained destruction on air
dromes, forts, drydocks, repair
shops, wharves and anchorages.
The target had been photographed
Feb. 4, in preparation for the raid,
by 22 young Marine aviators in two
giant Liberator bomber planes in
one of the most daring flights in
history.
Guided by the pictures, for which
the Marine volunteers had braved a
terrible death, bombers, dive bant
ers, torpedo bombers and fighters
of the great carrier force, backed by
the power of our Pacific fleet, rained
death and destruction on arrow
head-shaped Truk—the Japanese
Pearl Harbor —1,046 miles west of
newly conquered Kwajalein, about
3,450 soouthwest of Pearl Harbor,
2,140 short of the Philippines, and
about 2,100 miles from Tokyo.
