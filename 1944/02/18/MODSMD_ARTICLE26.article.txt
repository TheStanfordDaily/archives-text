# Shipyards Forbidden To Discharge Negroes
## 
### 
SAN RAFAEL, Feb. 17 (UP).â€”A
preliminary injunction was served
today on Marin shipyards, Sausalito,
California, forbidding the shipyard
from discharging colored workers
who refused to join an auxiliary to
the Boilermakers' union.
The injunction, issued by Supe
rior Judge Edward Butler of Marin
County, also restrained the Boiler
makers' union from denying mem
bership in their regular union or
compelling the Negroes to join the
auxiliary.
Judge Butler's issuance of the in
junction upheld the contention of
the Negroes, who brought the suit,
that the employment of an auxiliary
was "discriminatory" and against the
American policy.
The issue was taken to the state
courts after a temporary injunction
issued last fall by a federal judge
was suspended. A three-man panel
of federal judges decided federal
courts had no jurisdiction.
