The Individual Party will be given

War Board chairman of the parties.
Sixteen students will be invited
and refreshments will be served.
Margie Smith will invite the girls,
Carl Mason the civilian men and
Jeannette Grimsley the army stu
dents.
Anyone interested in going to one
of these weekly parties is asked to
contact MLss Teague at the Pi Phi
house, or Margie Smith at Madrono.
"The parties have always proved a
lot of fun, and we'd surely welcome
names of those who'd like to be in
vited," said Miss Teague. "There
are always a certain number of
civilian men, army students, and
girls asked to each party."
Refreshments are served and there
is usually some kind of entertain
ment, or everyone has a good time
sitting around talking.
