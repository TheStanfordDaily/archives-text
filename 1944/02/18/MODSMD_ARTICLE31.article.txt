# P.O. Given New Roof

### BETH MacVICAR 
Blessed is the university that keeps
a roof over the heads of its post
office employees. And blessed is the
university that keeps its post office
in faultless repair, so that the morale
of its students is sky-high through
hell, high-water, and mid-terms.
Yesterday morning, amid falling
rod tile and volumes of thick black
smoke, Stanford's beloved P.O. un
derwent the initial stages of roof re
pairs. According to Mr. C. A. Wil
liams, clerk, the P.O. employees have
been the victims of excessive roof
leakage during the season's i-ain
storms.
Besides being of practical use, this
project offers fun for Stanford's
"udy-tired kiddies. Huge gleaming
slabs of tar, stacks of newly-manu
factured tile and a pot of boiling tar
are available to sightseers.
According to Mr. Williams, the
repairs, which will consist of retiling
a small portion of the roof, should be
completed by today or early tomor
row. The roof was glossed with tar
yesterday, and will be tiled today.
