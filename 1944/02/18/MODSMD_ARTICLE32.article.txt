# Blood Donated By 47 Students
## 
### 
Forty - seven students donated
their blood yesterday, according to
Patty Patten, Blood Bank chairman.
This number fell three short of the
quota as the result of three last
minute cancellations.
The next Blood Bank day will be
Thursday, March 2, and sign-ups
have already begun. Any student,
Army or civilian, may donate. The
sign-up list is posted on the door of
the War Board office, and students
under 21 should obtain a release slip
at the War Board. This slip must be
signed by both parents and a third
party witness and turned in at the
War Board in order that students
under 21 may donate.
