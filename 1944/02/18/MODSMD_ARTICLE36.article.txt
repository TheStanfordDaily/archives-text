### Larry Sloan 
Every column, they say, is sup- ]
posed lo have a policy—an angle—
something special to grab and hold
the reader's interest. (Or have you
read Bull Session lately?)
Well, we've thought about a policy,
and thought and thought. We want
ed something smooth, none of the
trite old stuff we'd been used to
reading. But try as we might, we
oame to the very unsmooth con
clusion that a column, or this column
anyway, should be about people.
Names make news, and news is what
papers are printed fur. Or so they
say.
With that in mind, we'll try to get
a picture of the passing scene at
Stanford, to record the little things
that take place daily, to capture some
of the anecdotes from some of the
incidents that some of the people are
always getting into ,some of the time.
So on with the venture.
ASTP-QM-OCS
Whether or not any of Stanford's
ASTP students will go to Officer's
Candidate School at the conclusion
of their training remains a deep, dark
secret. But one group has made the |
grade, and is already on its way to
ward that gleaming golden bar.
They're the 71 Q.M. men who'd been
receiving training in the . Graduate
School of Business.
Commission notwithstanding, many
of the men were a trifle sad at leav
ing Stanford. Jim Schwabacher, who
nad sung several tenor solos in the
Memorial Church, was bemoaning I
the fact that he'd get no time to j
practice in the next four months.
Versatile Lads
Incidentally, the careers of ihe !
Q.M. men had been quite varied '
oefore donning the olive drab: I
Charles Porter, an architect, had de- '
signed several large churches; Nor- !
man Chung had passed the Califor
nia Bar. And in the athletic field.
Bob Fair, who sparked the Q.M.'s to
the football intramural championship j
last quarter, had played first-string ]
basketball for USF. And to show the i
Q.M. Stanford spirit: Bob Barbieri,
late of Co. F, was the man behind
that $5,000 bond Nylon purchase of
Janie Bicknell during the big "beat
Cal" drive. She got the stockings,
he got the bond With the sol
dier students now gone from the [
School of Business, there are eight
civilian students remaining. That
Business Library is really quiet
these days Outstanding of the
Q.M. men in his work at Stanford
(and a Harvard man, too!) was
Claude Wilson, who wrote three of
the Gaieties' catchy tunes, and had
formed a campus dance band prior
to leaving.
Blues in the Night
Those noises coming from Branner
every night from 5 to 7 are really
the solid sending of some first class
musicians. A six-man aggregation,
the swingsters are led by Tommy

Farr and his trombone, both of whom
were with Woody Herman before
joining up. Plus the "slush-pump,"
they've got a bass viol, two guitars,
and a two-man piano team. And, by
the way, they need a drummer, in
case you're interested.

Blues in the Night
Those noises coming from Branner
every night from 5 to 7 are really
the solid sending of some first class
musicians. A six-man aggregation,
the swingsters are led by Tommy

Farr and his trombone, both of whom
were with Woody Herman before
joining up. Plus the "slush-pump,"
they've got a bass viol, two guitars,
and a two-man piano team. And, by
the way, they need a drummer, in
case you're interested.
Every column, they say, is sup- ]
posed lo have a policy—an angle—
something special to grab and hold
the reader's interest. (Or have you
read Bull Session lately?)
Well, we've thought about a policy,
and thought and thought. We want
ed something smooth, none of the
trite old stuff we'd been used to
reading. But try as we might, we
oame to the very unsmooth con
clusion that a column, or this column
anyway, should be about people.
Names make news, and news is what
papers are printed fur. Or so they
say.
With that in mind, we'll try to get
a picture of the passing scene at
Stanford, to record the little things
that take place daily, to capture some
of the anecdotes from some of the
incidents that some of the people are
always getting into ,some of the time.
So on with the venture.
ASTP-QM-OCS
Whether or not any of Stanford's
ASTP students will go to Officer's
Candidate School at the conclusion
of their training remains a deep, dark
secret. But one group has made the |
grade, and is already on its way to
ward that gleaming golden bar.
They're the 71 Q.M. men who'd been
receiving training in the . Graduate
School of Business.
Commission notwithstanding, many
of the men were a trifle sad at leav
ing Stanford. Jim Schwabacher, who
nad sung several tenor solos in the
Memorial Church, was bemoaning I
the fact that he'd get no time to j
practice in the next four months.
Versatile Lads
Incidentally, the careers of ihe !
Q.M. men had been quite varied '
oefore donning the olive drab: I
Charles Porter, an architect, had de- '
signed several large churches; Nor- !
man Chung had passed the Califor
nia Bar. And in the athletic field.
Bob Fair, who sparked the Q.M.'s to
the football intramural championship j
last quarter, had played first-string ]
basketball for USF. And to show the i
Q.M. Stanford spirit: Bob Barbieri,
late of Co. F, was the man behind
that $5,000 bond Nylon purchase of
Janie Bicknell during the big "beat
Cal" drive. She got the stockings,
he got the bond With the sol
dier students now gone from the [
School of Business, there are eight
civilian students remaining. That
Business Library is really quiet
these days Outstanding of the
Q.M. men in his work at Stanford
(and a Harvard man, too!) was
Claude Wilson, who wrote three of
the Gaieties' catchy tunes, and had
formed a campus dance band prior
to leaving.
