# Stanford G.I.'s Physically Fit

### 
Just because he wears a shoulder j
patch emblazoned with a lamp of i
learning, don't underrate the physi- |
cal condition of the G.I. attending j
ASTP courses at Stanford Univer- |
sity.
In a series of physical fitness tests j
concluded recently, Stanford AST j
students topped average scores com
piled by army men in 250 colleges
throughout the nation by a sizable
margin, Everett S. Dean, acting
physical education director here, re
vealed this week.
Iron Man
Not only did the Stanford trainees
prove that they could take it on the
athletic field as well as the classroom,
but one of them, Pfc. Charles Beak
ley, Co. A iron man, copped the
army title for the physical fitness
tests.
Here's what every G.I. in the AST
program here must do to attain a
score of 50, the national average for
the tests:
Eighteen push-ups, 35 sit-ups,
100-yard pick-a-back in 2(5 seconds,
33 squat jumps, and 6 pull-ups, cli
maxed with a 300-yard run in 46
seconds.
2,000 Compete
With some 2.000 students com- I
pleting the tests, G.l.'s here wound ]
up with an average physical fitness 1
rating in the 60's, compared to the
national average of 50.
But Dean, peacetime Stanford bas
ketball coach, isn't satisfied. He and
his staff are shooting for a rating of
70.
No matter how you slice it, that's a
lot of burpees.
