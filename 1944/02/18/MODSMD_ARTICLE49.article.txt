# Sacramento Fans Given Five Days To Raise $75,000 Franchise Money
## 
### 
Sacramento baseball fans have
been given five days in which to
raise cash pledges sufficient to keep
the Pacific Coast League franchise
of the St. Louis Cardinals farm sys
tem from being transferred to Ta
coma, Washington.
Sam Breadon, the Cardinals' pres
ident, gave the extension of the
-leadline from Friday until Tues
.ay in a telephone conversation with
President Clarence Rowland of the
Coast League. Rowland stated that
several of ihe league directors had
also agreed to the Tuesday noon
deadline,
Rowland explained that if enough
pledges couldn't be raised to buy
the club from the Cardinals before
the deadline, a reconsideration of
the vote barring transfer of the fran
chise to Tacoma would take place.

, A group of the capital city's busi- j
nessmen met yesterday to map out !
a program for raising the necessary |
$75,000 to buy the franchise and J
players. If successful, the group will
have first chance at taking over the |
club.
In case the men cannot raise the !
money, Norman Ogilvie, Oakland
broker, has offered to personally put j
up the money and buy the club him- j
self in order to keep baseball alive j
in Sacramento.
If Sacramento keeps the franchise, |
another businessman, whose name |
has not been announced, will buy I
the ball park and equipment from !
the Cardinal system and rent it to j
| the Solon team.
At last reports, it seemed likely I
that the franchise would stay in ,
Sacramento, where a re-birth of j
baseball interest is developing.
