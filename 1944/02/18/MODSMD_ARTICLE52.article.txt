# Smith, Ex-Card High Jumper Visits Farm Enroute to East
## 
### 
Willard Smith, last year's sensational Card high-jumper, visited the
campus for a few days this week before leaving for his new Navy base in
ihe East. While on campus, Smith, a Beta, stayed at Monroe Hall.
Since last July 1, Smith has been stationed at Cal Tech in the V-12 naval
training unit there. He has now been transfered to the East for further and

more advanced training.
During his career at the Farm,
Smith was acclaimed as one of the
most outstanding athletes of the
country, and was one of the best
high-jumpers to come out of Stan
ford.
While in high school, Smith's top
mark was a mere 5' 10". In his fresh
man year here, lie raised that two
inches by scoring an even six feet
over the stick. He hit G" 3'V' in his
sophomore year and it was at this
time that his talents began to be
recognized. Topping his Stanford
career off in his junior year, he hit
the electrifying height of G'
gaining high recognition throughout
the sporting world.
His best effort at Cal Tech was 6'
G", but with all probability he will
go much higher if he competes in
tradk at his new base this season.
