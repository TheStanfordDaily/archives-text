# Religion Is Key to Peace, Says Minister
## 
### 
"Civilization lias committed suicide by going on a spiritual hunger strike,"
according to Miles 11. Krumbine, visiting minister from the Plymouth Con
gregational Church in Shaker Heights, Cleveland. O.
Dr. Krumbine, in a recent interview, attributed the world condition to
the fact that man has tried to live without the insights and ideals that

give life strength.
"Humanity has struggled on, dried
up from within, but refused to nour
ish itself," he continued. "As man
lost a sense of the importance of the
moral ideals that brought civiliza
tion to its peak, he turned to the
material aspect of life with disas
trous results."
Universal Formula
Dr. Krumbine recommends as a
universal formula a quotation from
Hearnkue's "Voice of Triumph,"
"Loss of purpose, loss of skill." The
nations of the world can recapture
their skill only after a revival of pur
pose through religion.

An awakening to the significance
of the spiritual is exemplified in this
war as man wreaks symbols of mate
rial achievement for moral ideals.
With this in mind, Dr. Krumbine
believes there is a hopeful possi
bility for a postwar plan of lasting
peace.
