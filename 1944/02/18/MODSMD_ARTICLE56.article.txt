## 
### 
"A person should have at least two |
years of graduate training to be an j
accepted social worker," Mrs. Mary |
Kohler, former Juvenile Court Ref- \
eree in San Francisco, told stu
dents at the Vocom meeting Wed
nesday night.
She went on to explain the per
sonality requirements of anyone in
terested in social work. She stated I
that the social worker's stock in j
trade is humans; therefore, her per- j
sonality is very important. She '
must take care of all the needs of ]
the family. As the theory of social
service is always growing and j
changing, the person must be able \
to adjust herself to all the agencies j
of the service.

Medical Social Work
Mrs. June Davidson of ihe Palo |
Alto Police Department spoke on i
medical and psychiatric social work. |
Medical social work is the solving |
of problems that result from illness, j
fear and emotional disturbances. !
The worker functions in hospitals,
health clinics or departments, and
any specialized organizations. The
work, however, has recently become !
more consultatory and advisory.
Psychiatric work is closely allied j
with medical but places more em- j
phasis on mentr.l anguish, according!
lo Mrs. Davidson.
Big Field in Red Cross
The big new field in social service i
is Red Cross service welware, stated
Mrs. Mabel Hargrove, director of
the Dibble General Hospital.
"Military and naval service work- '
ers take care of both the service;
men and their families. These work- i
ers are under Army regulations and
most of their work done in hos- j
pi tals. They supervise recreational !
activiteis for the convalescing men |
and help them with their personal
and family problems. They try to
adjust the returned veterans to the
new mode of life that they will be j
faced with because of their injuries."
