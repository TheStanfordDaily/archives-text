| WHAT A WOMAN—Now playing at
the Stanford Theater.
Rosalind Russell again shows why
' she's the screen's foremost comnie
j dienne in her newest Columbia film,
I "What a Woman," a bright and effer
vescent tale tbout a 10 per cent agent
and her troubles. Brian Aherne and
i Willard Parker, a newcomer from the
Broadway stage, also lend to the
i estivities.
1 As the story opens, Miss Russell is
! having her troubles finding a person
j to play the part of "The Whirlwind,"
; the hero of a pulpy best-seller. She
j finally lands on the author of the
! book, a hulking college professor
! (Willard Parker). All this time she
; is dogged by Brian Aherne, a re
porter out for a story about Miss
Russeil.
Bedroom Farce
Parker falls in love with Miss
1 Russell as the film develops into a
| good old-fashioned bedroom farce.
; Finally, however, Aherne's easy
| charm wins out and Rosalind enters
into that fatal 50-50 deal with him.
"What a Woman" starts out slowly
but works up to a brisk pace. Miss
Russell handles a difficult role with
perfection and is really stunning in
her striking gowns.
Aherne's droll humor scores a hit
and Parker shows promise in his
| screen debut. "What a Woman,"
i certainly not Miss Russell's best
j comedy, is nevertheless passable as
j escapist entertainment.
Ah! Dick Arlen!
A mad rush for the exits ensued
j when it was announced that Dick
| Arlen and Jean Parker were in the
j second feature, "Minesweeper," a
: woeful tale of exploding Jap mines.
Dapper Dick looks as if he's about
j ready to apply for his old age pension
i and joltin* Jean acts as though she
! were going to fall into a million
| pieces at any moment. This reviewer
| suggests that Paramount put the pair
! out to stud for a nice long rest. —
