# Slash Set for A.S.T.P. May Prove Serious to Stanford
## 
### 
Although Stanford has not yet been officially notified by Washington of
the Army's decision to abandon most of the A.S.T.P. college training pro
gram by April 1. President Donald B. Tresidder, in a statement said that
"What happens is not a question of how it affects the college, but of how
it affects the war effort.
"Serious as the effect on Stanford may be." he added, "it is a compara-

tively secondary matter if it hastens
the end of the war.''
At present there are 1,689 trainees
at Stanford, however, neither Presi
dent Tresidder nor the A.S.T.P. offi
cials would risk an estimate as to
how large the cut in the student
body might be, explaining that it
fould depend on the numbers and
groups which the government chose
to withdraw.
The army order directed the slash
in the A.S.T.P. units with the excep
tion of a limited number of ad
vanced technical soldier-students.
The reason offered by the Army was
due to the necessity of 200,000 men
to reach the goal set two months ago.
The ASTP unit at Stanford, estab
lished in March 1943 now includes
548 basic engineering students, 198
of whom will be graduated April 1.
Forty-eight of the preprofessional
trainees will be ready for medical or
dental schools on that date.
There are also 75 reserve men at
Stanford, 65 advanced medical stu
dents and 262 advanced engineers.
Of the third group, 103 are scheduled
to graduate at the end of this quar
ter.
