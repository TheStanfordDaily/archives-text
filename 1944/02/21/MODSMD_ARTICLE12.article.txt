AN EDITORIAL in the February issue of Free World vigorously
denounces the regime of Pedro Ramirez, stating that "his govern
ment is not only a threat to the people of Argentina. It is daily!
becoming a more direct threat to the United Nations as a whole, t
It is the only link between the Western Hemisphere and Ger-:
many; and fascist Spain is being used as a medium of secret
exchange between the two countries.
"His government is the surviving symbol of Hitler's influence
on this hemisphere. It is a constant threat to neighboring coun
tries —where it encourages anti-United Nations coups d'etat;
where Argentine agents lay plots; where German-Argentine
money corrupts."
The editorial continues, ". . . . there is no doubt that what
ever action we take against Ramirez will be considered helpful
by the people of Argentina.
"Therefore the time has come for the United Nations to act,
and we hope that .... immediate steps to free the Argentineans
from a cruel dictatorship and to release this hemisphere and the
United Nations as a whole from a dangerous threat, will be taken."
The article recommends that "Concrete isolation of Argentina
(with repeal, if necessary, of the recognition granted her) is vital.
This is expected in the Americas and in the rest of the world."
That a military cligue dominates the Argentinian political
scene is certain, but that repeal of diplomatic recognition of Ar
gentina is expected in the Americas is extremely doubtful. An
editorial demand for such action is unwarranted, and tends to
aggravate an already precarious situation.
Argentina broke relations with the Axis, a move which usually
indicates that a declaration of war is in prospect. The action was
the result of economic and political pressure by Great Britain
and the United States, it is true, but also a governmental acknowl
edgment of the increasing pro-Allied sentiment of the Argen
tinian people.
Some have argued that Argentina was still walking hand-in
hand with Berlin, and had broken relations merely to ease Allied
pressure. This theory does not seem valid, for the German note
demanding the release of Nazi officials held incommunicado by
the Argentinians, was so worded that it offended the personal
and diplomatic sensibilities of responsible officials, and almost
precipitated a declaration of war. Ramirez' refusal, of course, re
sulted in the resignation of four members of his cabinet.
But the fact that the government, Ramirez, his cabinet, and the
mysterious "Colonels" have been swept into that political tension
which makes a war declaration possible, is an encouraging
factor in our own political strategy.
If we were seriously to consider the suggestion of Free World,
and a withdrawal of diplomatic recognition were to take place,
the long, careful work toward building a better understanding
between Argentina and the United States would be destroyed.
Rightly the Argentinians are a proud people—nationally,
politically, and economically ambitious. In due time, even the
"Colonels" themselves will recognize the advantage of casting
their lot with the United Nations during the war, to insure a
successful postwar development.—Dave Davis

The article recommends that "Concrete isolation of Argentina
(with repeal, if necessary, of the recognition granted her) is vital.
This is expected in the Americas and in the rest of the world."
That a military cligue dominates the Argentinian political
scene is certain, but that repeal of diplomatic recognition of Ar
gentina is expected in the Americas is extremely doubtful. An
editorial demand for such action is unwarranted, and tends to
aggravate an already precarious situation.
Argentina broke relations with the Axis, a move which usually
indicates that a declaration of war is in prospect. The action was
the result of economic and political pressure by Great Britain
and the United States, it is true, but also a governmental acknowl
edgment of the increasing pro-Allied sentiment of the Argen
tinian people.
Some have argued that Argentina was still walking hand-in
hand with Berlin, and had broken relations merely to ease Allied
pressure. This theory does not seem valid, for the German note
demanding the release of Nazi officials held incommunicado by
the Argentinians, was so worded that it offended the personal
and diplomatic sensibilities of responsible officials, and almost
precipitated a declaration of war. Ramirez' refusal, of course, re
sulted in the resignation of four members of his cabinet.
But the fact that the government, Ramirez, his cabinet, and the
mysterious "Colonels" have been swept into that political tension
which makes a war declaration possible, is an encouraging
factor in our own political strategy.
If we were seriously to consider the suggestion of Free World,
and a withdrawal of diplomatic recognition were to take place,
the long, careful work toward building a better understanding
between Argentina and the United States would be destroyed.
Rightly the Argentinians are a proud people—nationally,
politically, and economically ambitious. In due time, even the
"Colonels" themselves will recognize the advantage of casting
their lot with the United Nations during the war, to insure a
successful postwar development.—Dave Davis
AN EDITORIAL in the February issue of Free World vigorously
denounces the regime of Pedro Ramirez, stating that "his govern
ment is not only a threat to the people of Argentina. It is daily!
becoming a more direct threat to the United Nations as a whole, t
It is the only link between the Western Hemisphere and Ger-:
many; and fascist Spain is being used as a medium of secret
exchange between the two countries.
"His government is the surviving symbol of Hitler's influence
on this hemisphere. It is a constant threat to neighboring coun
tries —where it encourages anti-United Nations coups d'etat;
where Argentine agents lay plots; where German-Argentine
money corrupts."
The editorial continues, ". . . . there is no doubt that what
ever action we take against Ramirez will be considered helpful
by the people of Argentina.
"Therefore the time has come for the United Nations to act,
and we hope that .... immediate steps to free the Argentineans
from a cruel dictatorship and to release this hemisphere and the
United Nations as a whole from a dangerous threat, will be taken."
