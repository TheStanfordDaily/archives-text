To the Editor:
I'm sitting here in the Nitery, spending a few of my precious
moments looking for the "notorious" coeds, "Roble 2c." I've
only been here a short time, one month, and as yet I haven't
met one of these beautiful coeds in sweaters. I heard a lot of
talk about so-called parties, but where are they? Is all Stanford
spirit just talk? How about a little action. I wear the uniform of
the United States Army, and I am proud of it, but we don't seem
to be welcomed with over-enthusiasm. I know there are plenty
of fellows just like me who would like to meet these gorgeous
gals in gingham. Why let these beauties mope around the dreary
dorms when they could, I'm sure, be having a good time?
What do you say, let's have some action fast! The Army has a
free hour each night and they like to relax with someone in
teresting and beautiful. All we ask is send seme fomales out at
night. Honest, we're harmless. Sincerely,
Beady, Willing, But Waiting.
