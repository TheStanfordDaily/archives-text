guests at tea where the faculty will discuss with Miss Stark the Middle j
and Far East.
Miss Stark, probably the best known contemporary British explorer, is !

characterized by her intrepidity and"
her unusual literary talent. Both
through her written word and her
first-class photography she shares
her discoveries with a wide and ap
proving public.
Regan Studies at London
Of English and Italian descent,
Miss Stark was brought up in Italy
and began her Oriental studies at
London University. Her research in
the lessey known parts of Persia
earned for her the Back Grant of
the Royal Geographical Society,
which enabled her to journey
through Luristan, Persia, about
which she wrote her first success,
"'The Valley of the Assassins."
Miss Stark also holds the Richard
Burton memorial medal from the
Royal Asiatic Society G934) and the
Mungo Park medal from the Royal
Scottish Geographical Society (1936).
Known for Journey
Today she is even better known for
a pioneer journey (1935) into the un
known and fertile fissure in the high
lands of the Arab States —the valley
called the Wadi Hadramuth. Her
book, "The Southern Gates of
Arabia," opened to the world the
fertile hinterland lying behind the
port of Mukalla, Aden protectorate.
Through her fluent Arabic, Miss
Stark has made many notable Arab
friends, including King Ibn Saud,
the Royal Family of Iraq, Seyyico of
the Aden protectorate, and the Emir
Abdullah of Transjordan.
Worked in Arabia
Since the war, Miss Stark has
worked for the British Ministry of
Information in the Arab world, first
in Aden and more recently in Iraq,
Egypt, and Palestine. She was in
Bagdad at the touch and go moment
in May 1941 when the rebel Rash id
Ali, backed by German planes,
staged the dangerous but short-lived
rebellion that was designed to link
Germany with Japan.
One of the outstanding features of
her war service has been the influ
ence she has exercised by being wel
comed at the harems.
