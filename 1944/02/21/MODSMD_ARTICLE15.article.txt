# Orchesis Prepares Pre-Classic Dances
## 
### 
In their program March 2, Orchesis
members will dance in the Memorial
Auditorium and some of their dances
will be accompanied by the Stanford
Chamber Music Group under the di
rection of Mr. Ferenc Molnar.
This quarter the members of Or
chesis have been taking a course
from Mrs. Miriam Lidster in chore
ography, a class in composing dances.
Their project for the quarter has
been to study 13 pre-classic dance
forms. Pre-classic dances are classic j
court dances of the 15th, 16th, and j
17th centuries, "classic" referring to j
classic ballet positions of the court of
Louis XIV. "Pre-classic" dances are
court dances, classic in form and
highly stylized in the decorous court I
manner of the early 16th century.
Not limiting their activities to
dancing alone, members of Orchesis
are designing their own costumes
and sets for the program. Olgadale
Phillips is in charge of costumes and
Candy Taylor is in charge of the
stage sets. The Orchesis members
must do an authentic dance.
