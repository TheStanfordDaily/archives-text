If the administration is handling
the question of varsity sports with a
fair mind, the reduction in the num
ber of army students at Stanford will
be the signal for Stanford to return
to inter-collegiate athletics. Exact
figures are unavailable, but the con
sensus of opinion places the number
of soldiers leaving at 1,000, more than
half of the number now stationed
here.
A few weeks ago, the sports de
partment began an investigation to
find out just why sports were
dropped, and to see what could be
done about bringing them back.
, The reason given by the admin
istration for chopping varsity sports
was that our coaches and facilities
were so overburdened by the influx
of army students, that there was
neither the man power, nor the time,
nor the equipment to coach teams.
With the removal of most of the
ASTP unit from the campus, this
excuse is no longer valid. If it ever
was valid, the only way the admin
istration can prove its validity is to
announce the resumption of varsity
sports, for at the time of the investi
gation, the administration stated that
it was for returning to varsity sports,
but that the man-power shortage
made this impossible.
Now that our overburdened
coaches have been granted a respite,
there is no longer a shortage of any
thing needed to take up athletics
once more, the administration should
follow out its previous statement that
it wants sports, and pass the neces
sary legislation to allow us to put the
Big Red Machine back in running
order.
