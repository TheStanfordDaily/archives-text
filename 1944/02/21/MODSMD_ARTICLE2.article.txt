The broadcast will be of half-hour
duration, and will take place the
afternoon of the 21st in the Education

of the Western States eliminations
will compete in a "double-phase"
contest.
In the afternoon, participants will
conduct a round-table discussion,
which will be followed that evening
in Memorial Auditorium by the sec
ond phase consisting of seven-minute
speeches and a question-and-answer
period.
Regional eliminations are being
held in Washington next week. Stan
ford's two entrants, Dorothy Bailey

Buenos Aires, will mail their manu
scripts to Washington at the end of
this week, where they will be judged
along with college and junior college
entries from the 11 Western States.
