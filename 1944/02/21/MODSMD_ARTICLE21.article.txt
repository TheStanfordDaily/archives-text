## Firehouse Vs. Roble Hashers Tourney Should Decide Title 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Having reached the mid-point of its currentâ€¢season, the intramural
basketball league lias produced only two teams,- Roble Hashers and iho
Firehouse, that can claim undefeated records. The two teams clash this
Thursday night on the Pavilion hardwood at 7:15 p.m. in a game which
should be packed full of thrills, chills, and spills, and display plenty of
good basketball. ,

Title at Stake
Both teams will be in there giving
it all they've got, because the winner j
of the tilt, under all probability, will
go on to take the league title with |
ease. It's bound to be a close battle, I
but the Hashers rate a slight edge
when it comes to picking a winner,
for with the organization of talent i
these boys possess it would be a dif- 1
ficult task for any team to knock 1
them over. Give Roble the nod by !
about 10 points.
Gerona vs. McKinley A
Featuring tonight's games will be ;
the Gerona A.C. vs. McKinley tilt, in
which there is sure to be a lot oi j
action. Suffering from the loss of j
Tugger Neville to the Navy, the Mc-
Kinley squad goes into the game as
only slight favorites. Once Gerona j
ever gets going they can really pour 1
it on, and could easily emerge the
winner of this one.
In the other tussles tonight, take j
Fillmore over Tyler by about 20 .
points, Monroe ever Buchanan, and j
Roble over McKinley B by an in- !
finite score.
