FLESH AND FANTASY—Now play
ing at the Orpheum Theater in
San Francisco.
'"Flesh and Fantasy" begins with
Robert Benchley drinking Scotch
and sodas at his club, trying to forget
the. effects of a bad dream. A club
mate then shows him a book contain
ing three strange stories that demon
strate man's superiority over super
stition.
The first of these stories concerns
an ugly, embittered dressmaker
(Betty Field), who idolizes a young
student (Robert Cummings). At
Mardi Gras time Miss Field receives
a wierd visitor from an *astral plane
who tells her that beauty comes from
within. So Miss Fields puts on a
handsome mask, honeys up to the
unsuspecting Cummings, and at mid
night takes off the mask and finds
herself beautiful.
The second fable tells of an influ
ential lawyer (Edward G. Robinson)
who is told by a fortune teller that
he is to commit a murder. Robinson
broods on this till he really does per
form his ill-fated mission.
The third of the bed-time stories
deals with Circus Star Charles Boyer
who dreams that he falls from the
high wire and sees a woman in the
audience screaming. (This is prob
ably true as the picture is really get
ting bad). Anyway Charlie meets
this lady (Barbara Stanwyck) and
doesn't fall off the wire in her pres
ence, thus disproving his dream.
"Flesh and Fantasy" relies too
much on art and not enough on the
plausibility of the story. One finds
himself laughing at supposedly seri
ous scenes. The film is different but
lacks any coherence. Another Holly
wood lizzie.—Bower
