# Still Fine Levied For Quad Cycling
## 
### 
There has been no improvement in
the bicycle situation and as a result
fines will be levied on persons who
persist in riding their bicycles on the
Quad. A campaign launched by the
Daily to clear bicycles from the Quad
by voluntary means has failed, ac
cording to Police Chief Gordon D.
Davis.
In answer to questions as to what
constitutes riding bikes on the Quad,
the following information is fur
nished. Both the Inner and Outer
Quad are construed to mean the
Quad and any person who enters the
iron gates is considered to be on the
Quad.

Racks are provided for cyclists and
their use is urged. These are located
at various points near the Quad and
there are certain racks on the Quad
for use of those cyclists who will
park their bicycles for the day. The
racks are located under the outer
colonnade of the Quad near the
Physics, Biology. Business School,
History, and Romanic Languages
buildings.
Men's Council announces that err
ing cyclists will be given tickets by
the canipus police force. It is also
announced that the fines will be stiff
and it is hoped that riders will rec
ognize the danger involved in the
use of bicycles on die Quad and that
campus policemen will be freed from
policing the Quad.
