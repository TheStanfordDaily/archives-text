## 
### 
The bridge tournament finals have
been postponed until March 3, Pat
Dana, tournament chairman, an
l nouneed yesterday. This postpone
ment was necessitated by the fact
that the men's halls were unable to
play off their preliminary games be
! lore the middle of this week, she
J said.
| The games have been played off in
the army units, the sororities, and the
halls, and games between couples
from these groups will start this
week, she added. "The schedule will
be announced about Tuesday so
these couples can get together for
playoffs, but because the finals date
1 has been changed, some of these
j groups will have two weeks to play
off the semi-final games," Miss Dana
I concluded.
