## 
### 
Highlight of the visit of Miles H.
Krumbine, pastor of Plymouth Union
Church, Shaker Heights, Cleveland,
was hk sermon at the church service
yesterday.
Speaking of ideals as a type of
spark plug, Dr. Krumbine pointed to
religious ideals as something which,
like food, one can do without for a
short period of time only. Dr. Krum
bine also stated that the sin of this
generation is not that it has produced
men with ideals and powers such as
Hitler, but that it has not produced
organizers and leaders like St. Paul.
In connection with this point, Dr.
Krumbine emphasized the impor
tance of excellence. Both Hitler
St. Paul had ideals, but we need the
ideal which is excellent.
Concluding, Dr. Krumbine stated
that the feeling of all people toward
the world should be one of responsi
bility for the trouble and strife which
we have today; and then a desire to
make the world a better place. We
have come to the place where we
must do something, "we cannot just
continue sliding," he said.
Next Sunday, Dr. Lewis Mumford
will deliver the sermon.
