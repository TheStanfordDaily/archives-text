## 
### 
The Stanford Canteen (the Nitery)
will be closed daily, beginning today,
except between 2 and 5 p.m. and 8:30
to 10 p.m., sunday through Thursday,
and from 8:30 to 11:15 p.m. on Friday
and from 8:30 to 12 p.m. on Saturday,
according to Carol Hurwitz, War
Board chairman.
"It's too bad the Canteen can't be
kept open all the time, but it doesn't
seem to work," said Miss Hurwitz.
"The Nitery looks like a pig pen
every morning with coke bottles all
over the place and coke spilled all
over the floor."
Men's living groups will sweep the
Canteen each night and on Sunday
mornings women's living groups will
give it a thorough cleaning. Presi
dents of women's living groups are
asked to call the War Board, local
513, or to go to the office and sign up
for this cleaning.
Different halls and houses will
hostess the Canteen on Friday and
Saturday nights and on Sunday aft
ernoons.
"If everyone would try to put away
his coke bottle and clean up, the
new plan will work," said Miss Hur
witz. "Otherwise the Nitery may
have to be closed altogether.
