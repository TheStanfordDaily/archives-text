# Huge Jap Losses at Truk
## Two-day Raid Destroys 19 Ships, 201 Planes 
### 
U.S. PACIFIC FLEET H.Q., PEARL HARBOR. Feb. 20 (UP)—Nineteen
Japanese ships were sunk including two light cruisers and three destroyers,
seven ships were probably sunk, and at least 201 enemy planes were
destroyed in the historic two-day attack on Truk Island Naval Base, the
Japanese Pearl Harbor, it was announced today.

"The Pacific Fleet has returned at
Truk the visit made by the Japanese
fleet to Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7, 1941,
and has effected a partial settlement
of the debt." Adm. Chester W. Nim
itz said in a communique giving the
first details of the attack, made
Wednesday and Thursday by a Pa
cific carrier task-force fleet.
Beside the cruisers and destroyers,
an ammunition ship, a sea-plane
tender, two oilers, two gunboats, and
eight cargo ships were sunk and a
cruiser or a large destroyer, two
oilers, and four cargo ships were
probably sunk in a knock-out vic
tory, the greatest, in the opinion of
naval men here since Midway, in
June 1942.
The brilliant Pacific Fleet victory
26 1 /2 months after Pearl Harbor was
made with the astonishingly light
cost of 17 American planes missing
and moderate damage to one Ameri
can warship.
So overwhelming was the Ameri
can attack under Vice-Adm. Ray
mond A. Spruance that not a single
enemy plane was able to take the air
on the second day and bombers,
dive-bombers, torpedo-bombers, and
fighters ranged at will, leaving ti e
Truk lagoon littered with burning
and sinking ships and the islands of
the atoll battered.
The attack was made Wednesday
and Thursday. On the first day 127
planes were shot down. In the two
days 74 enemy planes were destroyed
aground and more than 50 damaged.
It was believed possible that on the
second day, because of the complete
knock-out of the enemy planes, the
heavy units of Spruance's gigantic
fleet may have gone in to bombard
enemy defenses and installations,
though Nimitz mentioned only air
plane action.

planes were shot down. In the two
days 74 enemy planes were destroyed
aground and more than 50 damaged.
It was believed possible that on the
second day, because of the complete
knock-out of the enemy planes, the
heavy units of Spruance's gigantic
fleet may have gone in to bombard
enemy defenses and installations,
though Nimitz mentioned only air
plane action.
