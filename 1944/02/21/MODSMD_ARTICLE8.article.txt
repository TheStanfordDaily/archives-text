# Lagunita Signs Dutton for Dance
## 
### 
Fred Dutton's orchestra will play
for the Lagunita Informal, which is
to be held March 4 in the Women's
Clubhouse. Dutton is regarded as
having a fine band, consisting of 10
pieces and a vocalist. Most of the
players are college fellows from San
Jose State College, and they play
both sweet and swing.
The dance is to be informal and is
open only to Lagunita girls, and the
bids are now on sale for $1.10.
Joyce Costello is chairman of the
dance.
