U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HEAD
QUARTERS, PEARL HARBOR, Feb.
21 (UP) —Navy planes have bombed
Paramushiro and Shumushu Islands
in the Kuriles, extending the Pacific
Fleet offensive from the equator to
the northernmost reaches of Japa
nese territory, Adm. Chester W.
Nimitz announced today.
The attack was made Saturday
night by Ventura search planes of

Fleet Air Wing Four while Marines
and infantry were ripping through
the Japanese defenders of Eniwetok
Atoll and a triumphant carrier task
force was steaming back from its
triumph at Truk—a triumph re
sponsible in part at least for the
summary dismissal today of the
chiefs of the Japanese Navy and
Army General Staff.
Twin - motored Venturas fought
through Japanese anti-aircraft to
bomb targets in Paramushiro and
Shumushu in a raid which though
small in size re-emphasized the gi-.
gantic spread of the United States
Navy offensive which Nimitz is stilt
developing.
