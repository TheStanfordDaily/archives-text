### JEAN LEVINSON 
I am a blood donor. Last Thursday I gave one
pint of my corpuscles for the Cause. You see,
it all began when I agreed to accompany a timid
friend to the Blood Bank, and give her confi
dence and a feeling of security. Well, they
caught me too.
A beaming nurses' aide rushed up and clawed
at my arm .... gave me a neat shot of orange
juice, and a number. I was officially in line to
be bled.
Other donors-to-be were putting up a gay,
nonchalant front, and muttering through their
pale lips: "I'm going to faint, I know I am ....
everything'll go black, I know it will."
"Does it hurt? I can't stand pain, you know."
"Boy, take it from meâ€”as long as you don't
look, you're all right."
"How big is the needle?"
"Here goes nothing."
"I feel the need for some strong spirits."
Thoroughly cheered up by this stimulating
repartee, I found myself gently shoved into a
large room overflowing with cots and bodies.
Nurse Nightingale at my elbow grinned hap
pily and reminded me of my situation by hissing:
"This is it .... be brave."
Tripping over a patient who had fainted sev
eral hours before, I lay down on a cot and wait
ed. Peaceful slumber soon came upon me, and

I dreamed of razors, sharpened fangs, men in
white. I was rudely awakened by strong fingers
prodding into the flesh of my arm.
"No vein!" shrieked the disgruntled nurse.
"That's correct," I moaned, "I forgot to inform
the ghoul at the desk that I'm just a lively
cadaver."
"We'll find it, don't you worry," gleefully!
yelled Sadistic Sally. "Vein, vein, vein, come
up, come up wherever you are."
It did, and she set to work with utter abandon.!
After putting down her trusty pick-axe, she
embedded a small, but sturdy garden hose in
my mangled arm, and said:
"Now, open and close your little fistie tightly,
puleeze."
"I will, if you'll give me your neck to grip
on."
At last the ordeal was at an end, and I was
led over to a table around which sat the group ,
of old-timers who had just contributed their
blood.
"Didn't bother me at all," bragged a defense
worker, as he fell into his cup of coffee.
"It's a cinch," claimed a lady wrestler as she
was gently carried by eight nurses.
I admitted to myself that it really wasn't bad
at all, not at all." In fact it made me ashamed
that I had not given my blood before. "It
really was a cinch" I tell all my friends as they
come to visit me in the hospital. "Not bad at
all."
