FROM AST TO APO
Oh, dust off the service star, Mother,
The ASTP is no more.
Though he pass or he flunk,
His sailboat is sunk,
Your baby is going to war!
Say goodbye to the slide rules and textbooks,
Say goodbye to the coeds and class;
And take one last spree
As you finish term 111
For you're going right out on your—ear!
It will make little difference to study;
You're just like the rest of the dupes.
For win, lose, or draw,
You'll be eating it raw,
And heading right back for the troops!
The dear days at college are over;
The profs and the T-squares are gone.
So cry in your beers
You poor engineers,
You'll be digging a ditch from here on!
So dust off the service star, Mother;
And you might keep the gold one on hand.
If we're laying the mines
On the very front lines,
You'll probably be getting ten grand!

Newark, Delaware.
