# BLOOD BANK
## Donors Sign For March 2 
### 
Students are still needed to fill the
50-donor quota of the Stanford Blood
Bank for Thursday, March 2, accord
ing to Patty Patten and Dave Dun
ham, chairmen.
"Anyone on campus who has not
donated blood this quarter may sign
up," Miss Patten said. "Go to the
fVVar Board office today and make
your appointment."
Appointments are open at 11, 11:20,
11:40, 1, 1:20, and 1:40. A student
may register for any one of these
times by signing the sheet posted on
the door of the War Board office.
To donate blood, students under
21 must turn in a Release Slip signed
by both parents and a third-party
witness. These slips are available at
the War Board, or they may be ob
tained from War Board representa
tives in the living groups. Silps must
be filled out completely, and turned
in either at the War Board office or
at the Blood Bank in Palo Alto when
they donate.
Blood is donated at the Community
Center in Palo Alto, and students
may furnish their own transporta
tion or the Red Cross will take them
from campus to the Blood Bank.
