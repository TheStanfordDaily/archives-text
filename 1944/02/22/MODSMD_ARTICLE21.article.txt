The announcement of the reduc
tion in the number of army students
at Stanford has caused speculation
as to its bearing on the question of
the return of inter-collegiate sports
to the Farm. Yesterday in this col
umn, I showed how this could help
to bring back sports. The .main rea
son for canceling sports was that the
great number of ASTP men put too
great a burden on our coaches for
them to have the time to coach
teams.
Now that this burden has been
eased, the situation looks ripe for an
nouncement stating that the In
dians are taking to the war path once
more, and will re-enter the world of
sports. This may take time, however.
When interviewed yesterday, Dr.
Donald Tresidder, University Presi
dent, stated that no action could be
taken until exact figures on the
number of soldiers leaving are avail
able. When the full details as to the
number of soldiers left and the num
ber of civilians willing to participate
are ready, then, and only then, can
the administration take action to
bring back varsity sports.
Unconfirmed rumor has it that
more than a thousand soldiers will
leave the campus. If this is true, the
question of the man power shortage
among the coaches will be solved,
and that obstacle eliminated.
One more point remainsâ€”that of
the number of civilian men. As it
stands now we have more than
enough to field teams in every sport,
with the possible exception of foot
ball. The draft, however, is cracking
down, and civilian men are leaving
the campus in a steady stream. The
canceling of most 2-A deferments
will send even more men out of
school. This question of civilian man
power now looms as the most im
portant one in the problem. If
enough men remain, we should be
able to have sports, but if too many
leave, well, things are tough all over.
