## Mckinley Kicks Gerona Five; Fillmore Eats Tyler Alive 
### DICK BARTLE 
Lots of rain fell outside last night,
but there was a pretty heavy rain of
basketballs through the hops in En
cina Gym and the Pavilion as Mc-
Kinley A and Fillmore won intra
mural. games. . McKinley's. storm
came late in their game with Gerona
A.C. Behind 14-}) at the half and
still trailing quite late in the second,
the P.0.8.'s then controlled both
backboards, used a fast break con
tinually, and generally ran wild to
win, 35-27. McKinley looked ragged
and tired at the beginning, but
MartzlolT. Ehrlich, Ilorner, Donohoe,
and all the others came to life in time
to win strong team play. Rye Kelley
topped the Gerona attack with 10
points, while Pete Lee and Skeeter
Ehrman made six each.
The chances were not very good
that McKinley would win two games
last night. The B team ran up against
the Ruble Hashers and scored eight
points in the first half, but since
Roble made 40, some impartial ob
servers predicted that Roble would
win. The Daily went to press before
the final result was in.
Fillmore didn't have much trouble
with Tyler in their game and won,
42-13. The Fillmorons used only four
men until strongly reinforced late in

the second half. Chuck Stewart
scored 20 points for the winners, and
Fred Loomis made eight. C. Oren
Wilson contributed seven to the
melee. Chan was high for Tyler with
four. Fillmore led 22-8 at halftime
and, as the score indicates, was never
seriously pressed to win.
