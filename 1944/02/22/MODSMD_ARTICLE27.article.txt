Golfers and potential idols of the fairways will have a (liny; at active
competition on the Stanford greens this Sunday afternoon. Feb. 27.
For the benefit of those who understand golfing "lingo," the tournament
Will he a mixed, two-ball, foursome, and nine holes in length. All students
are eligible, civilian as well as army. Teams will be composed of couples,

the committee will pair a fellow with*
a girl or entrees may be made as
couples. Arrangements must be made
by Wednesday night, women should
call Betty Jean Rucker at 907!). and
men should contact Stan Bahnscn by
phoning B!M4. If necessary clubs will
be supplied.
The entrance lee for the tourney is
one golf ball that has seen better
days. It does not matter how old or
battered the ball is, old balls have to
be returned to the manufacturers so
they may be reprocessed and made
usable again. After the prewar
stocks of golf balls were exhausted
there were not any new ones manu
factured, the only way golfing can
continue is by salvaging the present
supply of these useless pellets. The
importance of this salvaging program
can not be underestimated. Ameri
can golfing will slip into the war
casualty column if this urgent need
is not realized.
The Women's Athletic Association
will award the winner a most coveted
and* rare prize, you guessed it, some
new golf balls.
Stanford is fortunate to have an
excellent course, and also one thai is
so near the campus. The tournament
Sunday will be an opportunity for
persons interested in this sport to
become acquainted with other golfing
aspirants. Novices or pros, sign up
today.
