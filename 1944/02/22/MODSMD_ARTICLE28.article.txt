# Symphony Season Proves Dull So Far
## 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
Looking back over the regular
concerts of the San Francisco Sym
phony Orchestra thus far this season,
one important fact stands out: the
concerts have proved unbalanced,
dull, and unsatisfactory.
In the first place, more composi
tions of Beethoven have been given
than any two other composers, yet
Beethoven is far from Conductor
Pierre Monteux's strong point. His
Beethoven is of a rather insipid un
forceful style, completely lacking in
fire.
In the second place, with the sea
son well over the half-way mark, not
one composition of Tschaikovsky's
has appeared on the programs of the
regular concerts. Although this
writer does not particularly like
Tschaikovsky, the fact remains that a
great majority of the musical public
does, and should have an opportunity
to hear some once in a while.
The remainder of the box score
includes: Bach, one work; Mozart,
one (a dry performance of the G
minor Symphony); Wagner, three,
two of which were exceptionally
good; Moussorgski, Schubert, Ravel,
Richard Strauss, Debussy, and Scria
bin with one each; and a few com
positions by lesser composers.
New Numbers Flop
Thirdly, the policy of presenting a
new composition each concert has
not been a success. Only two of these
new works have proved satisfactory
thus far; the Prokofiev "Romeo and
Juliet" suite, presented on the first
concert, and Hindemith's "Maithas
der Mahler," which is probably one
of the few important works written
in the last 10 years. The remainder
of the new works have been dull
second-rate compositions. Certainly
the idea of pxesenting new composi
tions is good, but a little digression
should be used in picking out works
that are interesting and listenable.
The soloists have been fairly satis-,
factory this season, especially Isaac
Stern* and Leon Fleisher. It was a

mistake, however, to have Alexander
Brailowsky, who is most certainly a j
capable pianist, play a Beethoven |
Concerto, for Brailowsky, like Mon- j
teux is far from a Beethoven spe- !
cialist.
Personnel Tops
There is certainly no reflection
upon the personnel of the orchestra, !
for the members of the orchestra are j
all competent musicians, with the
possible exception of the trumpet and !
trombone sections which blare at j
times. As far as the personnel is j
concerned, the San Francisco Sym- j
phony should rank with the six best j
orchestras in the nation.

It is also interesting to note that
; the performance of the Sigfried Idyl
I last week was quite poor, and usually
j Monteux' Wagner is exceptionally
[ good. Brahms is also one of Mon
; teux's strongholds, yet on the same
j program, the Academic Festival
Overture was completely lacking in
spark. A few years back Monteux
gave a very satisfactory performance
of the same work in a concert here
at Stanford in the Frost Amphi
theater. Also in a number of com
positions presented this season, the
! tempo taken has been either too last
i or too slow.
The fact remains, however, that
j Monteux is a competent conductor.
! fie led the Boston Symphony at one
time and conducted the first per
! formances of some of Igor Stravin
sky's important works in France.
Is it possible that age is beginning
to tell?
