# ONE-ACTS
## 'Death' Fri. 
### 
"Death in the Limelight," the One
act play by Peggy Fitz which will be
presented Friday and Saturday
nights in the Little Theater, is ex
pected to be hilariously enjoyed by
all those who attend the Ram's Head
production, according to Moofie Far
ris, Ram's Head president.
The play is similar to the famous
"Hellzapoppin" in that not only the
stage will be used, but the whole
theater will be a background for the
antics of the cast. Miss Farris has
been quoted as saying, "Death in the
Limelight shows Jean Levinson at
her best."
Because the date scheduled, Feb.
28, is also the night of the Sopho
more Cotillion, the curtain time has
been set at 8 o'clock in order that
theater-goers will be out at 9 in time
to attend the dance.
Tickets for the murder mystery
comedy will be available all this
week in the A.S.S.U. office for 55
cents, and also at the box office both
Friday and Saturday nights.
