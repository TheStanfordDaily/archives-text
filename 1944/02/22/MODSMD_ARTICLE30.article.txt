NO TIME FOIi LOVE—Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
Paramount's "No Time for Love"

is a rowdy, racy
'comedy about the
adventures of a
feminine photog
rapher (Claudette
Colbert) and a
bare-chested sand
hog (Fred Mac-
Murray) that stops
at nothing for
laughs. It's one of
the nicest bits of

spice to come forth from the cinema
capital in many a month.
Miss Colbert, noted for her photos
of white eggs on black plush, is as
signed to take her camera down into
the murky depths of a subway con
struction job. There she becomes in
volved with a grimy sandhog (Mac-

Murray) when by accident she
' makes him lose his job.
To make up for this, Miss Colbert
hires the glib Mr. Mac Murray as her
j assistant. The duo proceeds to in
; dulge in all sorts of dizzy affairs,
| many of them on the tongue-in
| cheek side. Finally Mac Murray re
j veals his true identity as a college
j graduate studying engineering and
j pops the eternal question to the
j astonished Miss Colbert.
"No Time for Love" is a gay little
piece of humor that should please
even the most discriminating. The
"Li'l Indian" finally gets a chance to
I say "Thumbs Up."
The second feature, "The Good
| Fellows," is an amusing satire on
lodges and fraternal brotherhoods.
Genial Cecil Kellaway and cantank
erous Mable Paige head the Para
mount cast.—Bower
