# Allies Regain Initiative At Rome Beachhead

### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES, Feb. 21
(UP) —Regaining the full initiative,
Allied forces today virtually com
pleted the elimination of a 4,000-yard
dent in the Rome beachhead ham
mered out by the Germans last week
before their attack collapsed with
chaotic losses that in one case totaled
60 per cent of a single regiment—
possibly 2,000 men.
This defeat was borne by the Ger
man 14th Army of Gen. Eberhard
von Mackensen whose nine divisions
of troops were rushed in from the
Russian front by Adolf Hitler in his
vain attempt to wipe out the Anzio
landing forces. The Allies in Italy
thus have tied up 18 divisions of the
best German fighters, around 200.300
men, not counting enemy corps and
■specialist troops.
