# 'Looks Like G.O.P. Year'; Prof. Barclay
## 
### 
President Roosevelt has a little
better than even chance, from pres
ent indications, according to Dr.
Thomas S. Barclay, professor of po
litical science at Stanford, who pre
sented a political analysis at the 12th
Annual Stanford Alumni Conference
held in the Fairmont Hotel in San
Francisco Sunday.
"But," he continued, "this looks
like a Republican year." Party or
ganization, he said, is opposed to
YVillkie, "whose nomination in 1940
the old line organization boys say
was unfair to organized politics."
Professor Barclay commented that
Thomas Dewey, Governor of New
York State, is running without ap
pearing to do so. "If Dewey has the
backing of Hoover, Landon, Joseph
Pew, and the DuPonts, he has a veagj
strong chance."' ™
"The House appears certain to be
Republican, and there is a possi
bility that the Senate will go Repub
lican also." The Republican victories
in bye-elections, 2G Republican gov
ernors, and 27 Republican legisla
tures, are the signs that point io a
nation-wide swing in political senti
ment.
At this Sunday conference, which
was the largest ever held, Dr. Leo
Eloesser also addressed the San
Francisco audience. He stated that
the United States should try to un
derstand Argentina because the lat
ter is the leader of the Spanish
speaking countries in South Amer
ica and the others would follow her
