en in the World group of the "Y" in
a discussion on the political responsi
bilities of women in the postwar
world, when the group meets this
afternoon at 4:;>0, according to Rose
mary Cross, chairman.
In the post war, the political re
sponsibilities and opportunities of
women will greatly increase, and
Miss Van Dyke's discussion will at
tempt to cover the many aspects of
these changes, according to Miss
Cross.
Next week Evelyn Jackson, grad
uate student, will be in charge of the
I program which will cover the finan
| cial problems confronting the college
j girl after the war.
Discussion number four will be
J devoted to the problems facing young
| career women—budgets, social and
i intellectual activities, and living ac
commodations. According to Miss
Cross, this should prove interesting
i to a large number, since material for
j discussion has been offered by for
: mer Stanford girls who are meeting
• these problems daily.
The fifth discussion will be "Per
sonal Adjustments in the Postwar."
These discussions will culminate
in a conference between girls from
Mills, Cal, College of Holy Names,
1 San Jose State, and University of
San Francisco, to be held at Stanford
. on March 19. The "Y," in conjunc
| tion with the War Board, will be in
! charge of the program.
