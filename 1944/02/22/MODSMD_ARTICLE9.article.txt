# U.S. Unmasks Spain's Falange
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 21 (UP) â€”
The United States today officially
unmasked the falangist movement of
General Francisco Franco and the
Spanish counterpart of Nazism and
Fascism and charged it with seeking
restoration of the old Spanish Em
pire which once included most of
Latin America.
It thus threw down the gauntlet
to the Madrid government headed by
Franco and brought deteriorating
diplomatic relations to a strained
stage.
A bitter excoriation of falangism as
"incompatible with the well-being of
the United States" was set forth by
Attorney General Francis Biddle in
announcing that denaturalization
proceedings have been started
against Isidor Conde Fernandez, 40,
a Porto Rican member of the falange.
It is the first action of its kind against
a falangist and Biddle indicated sim -
ilar cases will follow.
He utilized the announcement as
a vehicle for an official expose of the
falangist party and a direct blast at
Franco.
"The Falange," he said, "is the pro
totype in Spain of the Fascist and
Nazi parties in Italy and Germany.
Franco who heads the Spanish gov
ernment also heads the falange and
dictates its decrees."
