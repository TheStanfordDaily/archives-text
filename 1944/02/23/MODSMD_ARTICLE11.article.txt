### JEAN LEVINSON 
Have you been on a train trip lately? If you haven't, by all
moans put it on your "must" list, even if it's only to Redwood
City. You'll enjoy a better show than the flicks can offer, and
besides there's scenery thrown in for good measure.
There is inevitably ihe proud mother and her small, curly
topped bid for stardom. This grammar school Grable .goes
through continuous contortions, throttles her doll at intervals,
and is constantly tripping down the aisle for a tumbler full of
water. Mater then gently bops little Genevieve over the head,
and proceeds to comb out her lustrous curls . . . meanwhile Gen
mutters very advanced cuss words through her baby teeth.
There is always the slumber-bum; the fatigued citizen who
sleeps through every station, and is always watched by prying
eyes .... as if sleep were some new invention. He usually starts
off by resting his head against the window, and the cranium
gradually slips down until it is resting on the window sill.
An angry snort is issued from the gaping mouth, and the
snoozer places his head back of the seat. Then starts the lolling
period, at which time the head rolls from side to side, up and
down and around.
Acting the part of the Fairy-Godfather, the conductor awakens
our Flattop, and the dazed slumber-bum exits in a dreamy cloud.
The newspaper reader is one individual you can't miss on
the Southern Pacific showcase. There are two main types: the
one who owns the paper, and the over-the-shoulder, "I'm saving
money" reader.
The possessor of the paper holds his paper boldly at arm's
length, prodding out the eye of his neighbor, or he is a religious
newspaper folder, and systematically folds his paper into a hun
dred divisions .... slyly peeking around the edge of the news
paper, and licking his finger vigorously to unfold this newsy
maze.
Besides the characters riding on this technological wonder,
there are those who await the arrival of friends and loved ones,
but let's save this observation for another little Session, shall we?
