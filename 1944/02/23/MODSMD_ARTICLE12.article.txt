To the Editor:
I wish to correct certain statements which appear under my
name in the February 22 issue of the Daily.
I did not say, as quoted in your article, that "this looks like a
Republican year," nor did I predict that "the House appears cer
tain to be Republican." I read from manuscript:
1. The feeling of many Republican organization leaders that
"1944 is a Republican year" is based not on wishful thinking but
on a pronounced trend.
2. The prevailing curbstone opinion is that Roosevelt has
better than an even chance for re-election, but that the House of
Representatives, and possibly the Senate, will be controlled by
the Republicans.
3. In 1944, for the first time since 1916, the two parties ap
parently will be evenly matched, with certain advantages for
each.
I made no predictions or statements whatever of a personal
character concerning Republican prospects or candidates.
