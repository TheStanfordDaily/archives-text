# 'Blithe Spirit' Sparkling Play
## 
### 
BIJTIIE SPIRIT — Now playing at
the Curran Theater in San Fran
cisco.
Noel Coward's great versatility is
seen in his newest farce, "Blithe
Spirit," a masterpiece of modern wit

and humor, A ca
p a b 1 e Broadway
cast, headed by
Clifton Webb and
Peggy Wood, gives
a lasting interpre
tat i on of this
sparkling depar
ture into the oc
cult.
Mr. Coward pre
sents Charlie Con-
Hnminp u nm/olici

who, in order to gather material for
a research book, invites a medium to
his home to give a seance. But the
medium, Madame Arcati (portrayed
by Mildred Natwick), does more than
supposed. She produces the ghost of
Condomine's first wife, the frivolous
Elvira, who, to make matters worse,
is visible only to her former husband.
Enter the Ghost
This new type of eternal triangle
proves very nerve-wracking for
Condomine's living wife, Ruth, who
pleads with Madame Arcati to de
stroy this ghost. But the good Ma
dame proclaims that she is incapable
of removing what she has wrought—
theref ore Ruth decides to take mat
ters into her own hands. Only Mr.
Coward's genius can provide a suc
cessful climax to Charlie Condo
mine's embarrassing position.

Editor's Note:—Bovver's job has
finally gotten him .... he's even
embittered about Bower. We don't
like seeing you leave the Shack,
Dick, and we* hope you're back
again soon, banging away at Holly
wood. instead of the Japs.

Mr. Webb gives a truly distin
guished performance as the per
plexed husband and Miss Wood is
adequate as the second wife. Mildred
Natwick proves a show-stopper as
the irresistible Madame Acarti, while
graceful Haila Stoddard, portraying ;
the shade of the first wife, is just the !
seductive person she's supposed to J
be.
Clean Sweep in Excellence
"Blithe Spirit" is a fascinating
evening's entertainment, made all the
more perfect by a grand production
job. It will be presented this Sunday
at the Civic Auditorium in San Jose
for one performance only. This re
viewer cannot recommend the play
too highly—if you have an oppor
tunity to see "Blithe Spirit," you'll
have a memorable evening in store.
More good news —this "critic" I
leaves Stanford this weekend for the
duration, and you're probably hoping
for good.—Dick Bower

proves very nerve-wracking for
Condomine's living wife, Ruth, who
pleads with Madame Arcati to de
stroy this ghost. But the good Ma
dame proclaims that she is incapable
of removing what she has wrought—
theref ore Ruth decides to take mat
ters into her own hands. Only Mr.
Coward's genius can provide a suc
cessful climax to Charlie Condo
mine's embarrassing position.

Editor's Note:—Bovver's job has
finally gotten him .... he's even
embittered about Bower. We don't
like seeing you leave the Shack,
Dick, and we* hope you're back
again soon, banging away at Holly
wood. instead of the Japs.

Mr. Webb gives a truly distin
guished performance as the per
plexed husband and Miss Wood is
adequate as the second wife. Mildred
Natwick proves a show-stopper as
the irresistible Madame Acarti, while
graceful Haila Stoddard, portraying ;
the shade of the first wife, is just the !
seductive person she's supposed to J
be.
Clean Sweep in Excellence
"Blithe Spirit" is a fascinating
evening's entertainment, made all the
more perfect by a grand production
job. It will be presented this Sunday
at the Civic Auditorium in San Jose
for one performance only. This re
viewer cannot recommend the play
too highly—if you have an oppor
tunity to see "Blithe Spirit," you'll
have a memorable evening in store.
More good news —this "critic" I
leaves Stanford this weekend for the
duration, and you're probably hoping
for good.—Dick Bower

who, in order to gather material for
a research book, invites a medium to
his home to give a seance. But the
medium, Madame Arcati (portrayed

supposed. She produces the ghost of
Condomine's first wife, the frivolous
Elvira, who, to make matters worse,
is visible only to her former husband.
Enter the Ghost
This new type of eternal triangle
proves very nerve-wracking for
Condomine's living wife, Ruth, who
pleads with Madame Arcati to de
stroy this ghost. But the good Ma
dame proclaims that she is incapable
of removing what she has wrought—
theref ore Ruth decides to take mat
