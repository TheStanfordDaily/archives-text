# Washington—F.D.R. Vetoes Tax Bill
## 
### 
WASHINGTON (UP) —President Roosevelt yester- I
day vetoed the new $2,355,200,000 tax bill on grounds ;
that it is not a revenue measure but a catch-all provid- |
ing relief "not for the needy but for the greedy," and he ;
I also bluntly blamed Congress for the complex income j
J tax form.
Ilis sharply critical message transmitted with the
(irst tax hill veto in U.S. history so aroused members of '
Congress—Democrats and Republicans alike—that they
| vowed to override the veto on Thursday and force i
the hill to become law.
Republicans described political motives to Mr. Roose- I
velt's action and said the message was a continuation 1
j of an "anti-Congress campaign." Chairman Robert L. |

Doughton, Democrat, N.C., of the tax-writing House
Ways and Means Committee, which fashioned the re
jected bill after nine months of work, angrily an
nounced he would vote to override. Chairman Walter
F. George, Democrat, Ga., of the Senate Finance Com
mittee, said that if the House overrides, so will the
Senate.
In his biting message, Mr. Roosevelt disowned the
Ruml-inspired pay-as-you-go- tax plan, demanded
that the Social Security tax rate be doubled, called for
prompt tax simplification through elimination of the
"clumsy Victory Tax" and said he would "be glad" to
approve a simple joint resolution retaining the $1,000,-
000,0011 of increased excise taxes in the vetoed hill.
