# Stockholm Bombed; Luftwaffe End Seen
## 
### 
BULLETIN (UP) —The Swedish home radio, in a
broadcast reported by United States government mon
itors, said tonight that bombs have been dropped on
Stockholm by unidentified planes. The broadcast
quoted an official government announcement.
Meanwhile, in Stockholm reliable sources reported
that the Russians bombed the Finnish town of Aabo,
Tuesday night. Details were not available.
The Swedish broadcast quoted the text of the Swedish
defense staff communique, which said the bombs were
dropped by a "small number of foreign aircraft com
ing in from the east."

LONDON (UP) — American four-engined bombers,
striking from both England and Italy, coordinated a
furious assault on four major aircraft factories in Ger
many yesterday, carrying the record-breaking attack
on the heart of the Luftwaffe into its third straight day
despite the severest enemy air opposition of the war.
Forty-one of the British-based heavyweights alone
were shot down in aerial battles which returning air
men described as worse than Schweinfurt last Oct. 14,
when 60 American planes were lost. It was grimly
predicted, however, that results of the new raids may
well prove to be the turning point in the battle of
extinction against the Luftwaffe.
