# Marian Anderson To Sing Tonight; Tickets Sold Out
## 
### 
Lucky are those who have tickets
to the Marian Anderson concert this
evening at 8:15 in the Memorial*
Auditorium. The tickets were sold
out nearly two weeks ago, the Con
cert Series office announces.
The noted Negro contralto, voted
by critics to be one of the most ac
complished living singers, is rivaling
her past years' popularity record on
this present concert tour, her eighth,
incidentally, under the auspices of
S. Hurok.
Ever-Busy Artist
It has been computed that Miss
Anderson appears in more conceits
each year than any other musical
artist, having appeared in Europe
and all through the United States.
Dignitaries, too, have formed Miss
Anderson's audiences on several oc
casions. Among those before whom
the gracious contralto has sung are
the King and Queen of England, and
President and Mrs. Roosevelt, a spe
cial occasion being held at the White
House in honor of the visiting roy
alty in 1939.
"Charm" is immediately associated
with Miss Anderson's name by all
those who have been fortunate
enough to have seen her before. It is
this charm mingled with simplicity
and feeling that have made Marian
Anderson such a beloved figure of
the concert stage.
Fund Donated
A fund for young musicians was
set up from the money which she

won from the $10,000 Bok AwaijcS,
This fund is for both wlvite and col
ored young people.
Following this concert which is the
second in the Stanford Concert
Series, will be a program by the
noted Brazilian soprano, Bido Sayao,
April 13.
