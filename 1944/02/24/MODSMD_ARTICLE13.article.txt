Ladies of the campus, attention! The War Board is peeved
at you .... very peeved indeed. You have not only let them
down, but you have let down every member of the AST.
Why? That's obvious.
Each Friday night, one women's living group is supposed to
volunteer to take over the Nitery; provide food, entertainment,
and happy times for our boys in khaki. But merciful goodness,
you haven't .... slackers!
Every lass is always generous when it comes to rolling
bandages (we hope) and the like. You say you'd love to "really
do something for the war effort." Well, Letitia, get in there and
c/o it. It won't take much of your valuable time, and you can
always wash your hair or change your nail polish some other
night.
Come on now, ladies, and let's really give the fellows a
good time at the Nitery. How's about it?
But enough of this lecturing .... here are some timely tips
on how to enjoy yourselves this weekend.
The much-publicized Soph Cotillion, deliciously called "Can
dyland," will be held in the Pavilion this Saturday night, starting
at 9 p.m. Air the moth balls from your formals, and toddle over
. . . . you can't miss on a jolly time.
For Friday night's fun, come on around and see the Ram's
Head Original One-Acts, at 8 p.m. in the Little Theater. You can
also catch them Saturday night, and can get out in plenty of
time for the Cotillion. They're guaranteed not to even have as
good programs as "Blithe Spirit," but they will provide a good
laugh or three.
