To the Editor:
When I enrolled in Stanford I thought I was entering a uni
versity of high degree—a place where sane people with high
hopes studied and worked to become useful American citizens.
I thought that here, of all places, I would find a community
which was actively interested in world problems. I was wrong.
Have you ever heard of Dr. Niebuhr? He gave a series of
brilliant lectures here on the campus a few weeks ago. That
was an opportunity that no one should have missed, especially
Citizens of Tomorrow. Yes—people were turned away from the
doors—but they were people from Palo Alto.
Have you ever heard of the Race Relations Group on campus?
Last Thursday Professor Farnsworth gave an enlightening talk
on the Race Minority Problem. Only about 25 Stanford students
heard him. It's disgusting. If the college group is not concerned
with world problems, certainly no other group can be expected
to be. Oh, you have the time all right—if you want it. Just make
it the fad to go to the Tuesday Evening Series instead of a show
—it would really be worth your time. I'm sure your poor brain
isn't too tired to do a litle constructive thinking aside from the
school work.
Perhaps there could be a section in the Daily devoted to
announcing and discussing meetings and lectures that are
"musts for intellectuals." Not many people glance at that in
complete, microscopic list of announcements on the second page
of the Daily.
The average Stanford student doesn't really know what's going
on here. Do you realize, for instance, that Dr. Lewis Mumford
is giving the University sermon next Sunday? A lot of you will
spend Sunday morning over the funnies instead of hearing one
of the talented leaders of America. The very least you can do
is take a mild interest in the intellectual pursuits on this campus
—if only to fulfill your obligation to society, as its future citizen,
ior giving you an opportunity for a college education.
Hiqhborn Sal.
