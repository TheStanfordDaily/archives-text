## MURALS McKinley A's Trounce Tyler 
### DICK BLOCK 
Marion Anderson's concert proved
to be too much competition for the
intramural league last night. It
seems that most of Stanford's bas
ketball hopefuls tripped over to the i
Memorial Auditorium, forsaking ath
etics for the intellectual.
The contest between McKinley A
and Tyler was an exhibition of very
good basketball by McKinley and
very poor casaba pitching by the
Tyler outfit. The blue-shirted M.H. 1
P.D.B. lads showed no mercy to their
hillside neighbors.
A's Open Strong
In the first 45 seconds of play Tom
Martzloff and John Ehrlich of Mc-
Kinley each tanked a tally and the ;
A's were off to a flying start. Re- \
covering from their dilemma of
Monday night when they almost lost i
to Monroe, McKinley displayed ;
beautiful teamwork the entire first j
half. The backboards were in almost
complete control, and the fast break ;
routine completely stymied the Tyler j
defense. At the conclusion of the |
first half the issue was already de- !
cided, as McKinley led 53 to 20.
The venerable floors of the Pa- j
vilion continued to be the scene of a
virtual track meet in the opening '
minutes of the second half. Mc- |
Kinley finally bogged down under '
the pressure, as Tyler's defense be- j
gan to stiffen. Due credit should go !
to Tyler for fielding a team. Three |
of their top men were not present,
but the subs fought all the way.
Horner Top Man
The final score was McKinley 86, j
Tyler 33. Doug Horner of McKinley ;
walked off with top scoring honors ;
with 38 buckets. Elwood Hanson led
he losers with 20 points.
Monroe defaulted to Gerona A.C.,
and Washington canceled the tilt
with Buchanan. The results of the
Fillmore-McKinley B game were too
late for publication.
