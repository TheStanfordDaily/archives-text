# Walton and Athearn Victors In Second Moot Court Trial
## 
### 
The second trial of the Moot Court was held Tuesday night, with the
appellants gaining a 2G':>-point score. The appellants were Mrs. Avis
Walton and Mrs. Lucille Athearn, and the Respondents Beverly Ottem and
Elizabeth Murray.
The case dealo with a faulty axle built by a sub-contractor and sold

without proper lests beforehand to
motor car company. The motor car
company also failed to make tests
before putting the axle into a truck
which was sold to August Riley.
When one of the purchaser's em
ployees was driving carefully down ,
the street, the axle gave way, causing
the truck to hit two bystandei-s, a
man and his wife.

The injured bystanders sued both
the sub-contractor and the motor car
company in a lower court. When the
judge gave the verdict in favor of
the sub-contractor and the motor car
company, the case was appealed to
the Moot Court.
No Tests Made
The appellants based their case
upon the fact that no tests of the
axle were made. They cited numer
ous cases in which courts have held
that the injured should receive
money if no tests of the faulty parts
had been made. These cases showed
the modern theory of extension of
liability to include not only the peo
ple in the truck, but also bystanders.
The chief argument of the re
spondents was that when liability is
extended, there is no limit to the
extension.
