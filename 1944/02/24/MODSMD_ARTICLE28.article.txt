wheat, situation,, according, to. the
latest bulletin published by the Food
Kcscarch Institute at Stanford.
This use of wheat for feed and al
cohol probably accounted for the
disappearance of at least 350 million
bushels of wheat which had beer
formerly used for domestic consump
tion.
The institute report urges that
| "less emphasis be placed on the size
of the United States carryover of
wheat in the coming year due to the
increase in nonfood usas of wheat."
The Institute also urges that "should
the grain harvest in 1944 be unfavou
able, the government policy con
tinuously should be directed towarc
a reduction of the existing huge live
stock population, so that less wheat
will be needed for feed in 1944-45."
Reports from other countries show
| that Canada, Argentina, and Aus
tralia will have large enough stocks
j of wheat on Aug. 1, 1944 to provide
| shipments to liberated areas and
supply imports into the United States
i in the event fo a poor harvest here
) Soviet Russia however has had
smaller quantities of grain this year
and has had to meet the deficit by
imports from North America.
