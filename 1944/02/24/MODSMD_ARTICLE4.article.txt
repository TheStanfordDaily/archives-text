furs Saturday night, gals, 'cause there will be plenty of others doing it!

formances if there are any left.
Domestic Comedy
"Coast to Coast" is a domestic comedy about a modern American family
whose lord and master has the modern American trait of being a radio
addict. In fact Papa's fixation for news broadcasts and radio commentators
so upsets his family tha his home is almost broken up and his son is about
to flunk out of school. The amusing incidents which evolve out of this
family-vs.-radio conflict are entertainingly told by Bill Rose, author of
the original play.
"Papa" is being played by Fritz Koenig, a newcomer to the Stanford
stage. Playing his long-suffering wife is Mary Higgins, and cast as his
son is John "Paddy" Licvsay who made such a hit as the "second-quarter
freshman" in the Libe skit of the Gaieties.
Sally Stocker and George Crane are playing friends of the family and
Sue Sheldon, pinch-hitting for Jane Spalding who is in the hospital, will
play the rather unusual maid. Cecelia Bergeda, Ram's Head veteran, is
directing the play.

director, under the supervision of John Sollers of the speech and drama
department. Assisting Garms on the stage crew are Marsha Bates. June

Domestic Comedy
"Coast to Coast" is a domestic comedy about a modern American family
whose lord and master has the modern American trait of being a radio
addict. In fact Papa's fixation for news broadcasts and radio commentators
so upsets his family tha his home is almost broken up and his son is about
to flunk out of school. The amusing incidents which evolve out of this
family-vs.-radio conflict are entertainingly told by Bill Rose, author of
the original play.
"Papa" is being played by Fritz Koenig, a newcomer to the Stanford
stage. Playing his long-suffering wife is Mary Higgins, and cast as his
son is John "Paddy" Licvsay who made such a hit as the "second-quarter
freshman" in the Libe skit of the Gaieties.
Sally Stocker and George Crane are playing friends of the family and
Sue Sheldon, pinch-hitting for Jane Spalding who is in the hospital, will
play the rather unusual maid. Cecelia Bergeda, Ram's Head veteran, is
directing the play.
Garms Builds Set
The set for "Coast to Coast" was built by Mickey Garms, technical
director, under the supervision of John Sollers of the speech and drama
department. Assisting Garms on the stage crew are Marsha Bates. June
Stein, Jean Stroud, Sue Sheldon, and Pat Neilson.
Working with Justine Huking on the prop crew are Nancy Pennycook,
Barbara Lamb, Carol Olson. Dean Mahin, and Nick Vracin.
Heading the make-up crew are Margaret Morgan and Jean Levinson,
