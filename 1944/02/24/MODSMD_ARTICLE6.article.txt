# Army Dancing Lesson at 7:30
## 
### 
The fourth and final army dancing
lesson will be held this evening from
9:30 p.m. to 10:15 in the Women's
Clubhouse.
This is the last lesson in a series
held at the request of the army stu
dents, and it is designed to teach only
the basic steps and provide practice
to those who feel they need it.
Dick Leon will replace Julius
Buckler as instructor, and any girls
interested in assisting as individual
partners should sign up on their liv
ing group bulletin boards, or get in
touch with Cathy Hauser at La
gunita.
This same elementary series of les
sons will be repeated beginning on
March 2. All army students who are
interested can now sign up with their
social chairmen.
It is hoped that a more advanced
series can be given in Spring
Quarter.
