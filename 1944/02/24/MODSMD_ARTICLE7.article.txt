# 'Revive World Trade,' Says 'Y' Speaker

### 
"My plea for a revival of inter-
I national trade is not based on high
j idealism, moral obligation, or good
j sportsmanship; but on the sheer
tffound of expediency and the ulti
mate betterment of our own national
interests," said Dr. Theodore Boggs,
acting head of the economics depart
ment, in his talk to members of the
"Y" World AfFairs Group yesterday.
The reasons which Dr. Boggs set
forth for his plea for a revival of
international trade are as follows:
(1) The most effective means of
achieving prosperity the world over
is the maintenance of production at
high levels, and this in turn is de
pendent upon the expansion of mar
kets.
(2) Postwar economic ideals as set
forth by the Atlantic Charter would
seem impossible without the reopen
ing of world trade.
j (3) The revial of trade and the ex
; panding of markets, which would
j constitute an indispensable fore
| runner to the extensive investment
i of capital abroad.
Dr. Boggs expressed his approval
| of Vice-President Wallace's sugges
i tion that we invest capital in pro
j ductive enterprises abi-oad in the
belief that these undertakings would
prove profitable both ourselves and
j all other nations.
He also said that our ability to in
j vest our capital in projects profitable
! to our nation would be contingent
| upon the revival of trade throughout
I the world.
Dr. Boggs said that maintenance of
separate trade policies with each na
i tion acting independently of the
i other would again lead to disaster.
| He suggests some kind of Interna-
I tional Trade Authority which would
j supervise and control the commercial
interests of all. Although he admitted
| that the majority of the nations
j would be reluctant to accept such a
1 plan, he expressed the hope that the
j issue would find a half-way ground
! for settlement and that it might de
velop gradually.
