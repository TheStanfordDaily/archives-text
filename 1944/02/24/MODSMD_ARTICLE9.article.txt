U.S. PACIFIT FLEET HEADQUARTERS, PEARL HARBOR (UP) —A
giant Pacific Fleet task force, including hundreds of carrier-borne planes,

last desperate Japanese defenders of Eniwetok Atoll. Adm. Chester YY.

Nimitz announced today.
Deepening their bold penetration
of Japanese ocean empire waters, the
American forces took the attack to
Japanese mandated islands about 65C
miles northwest of Truk.

Guam, the American naval station
at the south end ot the Marianas
which the Japanese took in the early
days of the war.

force, including several hundred car
