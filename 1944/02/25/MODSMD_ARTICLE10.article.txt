To The Editor:
Let's abolish the honor system! I'm sick of
exhibitionism in honesty. Specifically, the hon
or system is bad because: (1) It encourages dis
honesty, particularly in a borderline group who
might retain self-respect under ordinary condi
tions. An especially heavy and unfair tempta
tion is placed before pre-professional students,
whose future careers may hinge on the exami
nation grades. (2) It fosters a particularly un
healthy frams of mind in those responsible for
reporting infractions (I always did despise tat
tle-tales!) (3) The abuse of a few individuals can
harm the entire student group. (4) There is no
objective way to determine how successful the
honor system really is.
I know that the honor system is cloaked in
the hoariest tradition. But arguing by tradition,
as in arguing by authority, carries no weight
in itself unless the underlying logic supports
it. Can it be thai we are being gently led along
the straight and narrow, toward the Higher
Moral Plane? I pity the man or woman who
hasn't crystallized his principles by college age,
and I question whether true moral character can
be built by such means at this late stage.
The idea that institution of the proctor system
here would somehow reflect on the honor of
the Stanford Gentleman is simply wacky. We
don't feel any stigma attached to the presence
ol the Stanford cop, do we? And no one yet,
to the best of my knowledge, has advocated the
elimination of gate keepers in favor of the "hon
or system" of admission to the Big Game. By
precedent in many fields we are already com
mitted to the simple recognition of human fal
libility. Why should the matter of course ex
aminations constitute an exception? The whole
thing smacks of Pollyanna and Alice in Won
derland. In the vernacular of this column, let's
face it: the millennium hasn't hit Stanford yet.
We still need ordinary and proper safeguards in
moral conduct. To be quite cynical, I think the
only reason why the honor system has survived
this long is that the authorities responsible are
afraid of "losing face" if it is abandoned.
They tell me that California at one time had
the honor system but finally abolished it by
student vote. A referendum at Stanford would
give a dignified and democratic way to clarify
the air here. How about it?
Realist.

To The Editor:
Let's abolish the honor system! I'm sick of
exhibitionism in honesty. Specifically, the hon
or system is bad because: (1) It encourages dis
honesty, particularly in a borderline group who
might retain self-respect under ordinary condi
tions. An especially heavy and unfair tempta
tion is placed before pre-professional students,
whose future careers may hinge on the exami
nation grades. (2) It fosters a particularly un
healthy frams of mind in those responsible for
reporting infractions (I always did despise tat
tle-tales!) (3) The abuse of a few individuals can
harm the entire student group. (4) There is no
objective way to determine how successful the
honor system really is.
I know that the honor system is cloaked in
the hoariest tradition. But arguing by tradition,
as in arguing by authority, carries no weight
in itself unless the underlying logic supports
it. Can it be thai we are being gently led along
the straight and narrow, toward the Higher
Moral Plane? I pity the man or woman who
hasn't crystallized his principles by college age,
and I question whether true moral character can
be built by such means at this late stage.
The idea that institution of the proctor system
here would somehow reflect on the honor of
the Stanford Gentleman is simply wacky. We
don't feel any stigma attached to the presence
ol the Stanford cop, do we? And no one yet,
to the best of my knowledge, has advocated the
elimination of gate keepers in favor of the "hon
or system" of admission to the Big Game. By
precedent in many fields we are already com
mitted to the simple recognition of human fal
libility. Why should the matter of course ex
aminations constitute an exception? The whole
thing smacks of Pollyanna and Alice in Won
derland. In the vernacular of this column, let's
face it: the millennium hasn't hit Stanford yet.
We still need ordinary and proper safeguards in
moral conduct. To be quite cynical, I think the
only reason why the honor system has survived
this long is that the authorities responsible are
afraid of "losing face" if it is abandoned.
They tell me that California at one time had
the honor system but finally abolished it by
student vote. A referendum at Stanford would
give a dignified and democratic way to clarify
the air here. How about it?
