To The Editor:
Wednesday night this University was host to
one of the foremost singers on the concert stage
today. Although the audience was extremely
enthusiastic over her fine performance( I am
sure that many could not have helped noticing
the deplorable condition of the stage. It seems
odd that a school the size of Stanford should
allow a famous artist to perform upon a dirty,
dusty stage to accompaniment upon a piano
which possibly has seen a polishing in the last
six or eight months. If the manpower shortage
has developed so far as to produce this condi
tion, let us rather forego the concerts than allow
them to go on in this pitiful state.
