In view of the fact that many of the AST men

versity give a sort of testimonial dance, banquet,
or prepare some ceremony as a send-off for
the boys?
In summarizing, many of us have been glad
that men from all over the country have had a
chance to come to Stanford, and do their part
in bringing to us the realization that we do not
live in an "Ivory Tower." We'll be sorry to see
them leave.
Friendly.
