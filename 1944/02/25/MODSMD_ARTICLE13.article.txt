# 'Riding High,' Lamour-Powell Dude Ranch Story, Rated 'Thumbs Down'
## 
### 
"HIDING HIGH"—Now playing at llie Stanford Theater.
Paramount's "Riding High" is a Hollywood version of dude ranch life in
Arizona. Dorothy Lamour (or is it Paulette Goddard), seen as a gold-dig
ging chorus girl, wears as few clothes as permissable and sings in hot
usual monotone, while leading man Dick Powell has little to do except

make love to Dottie and warble

a couple of poor
ballads. Victor
Moore injects
some life into the
dull proceedings
in his role as a
counterfeiter.
Then there rue
'two of Para
mount's newest
"finds" — leather
lunged Cass Da
ley, who bellows

out some songs in her homely man
ner, and Lanky Gil Lamb, who is
amusing as the befuddled sheriff out
after Victor Moore. Lamb's slapstick
number with Milt Britton's crazy
house band is the high-spot of the
picture.
The second feature is another
Paramount flop. This time the
Marathon Boulevard boys oiler posi
tively the worst picture of this or
any other year. It's entitled "Hos-

tages" and is a wretched tale of
Nazi - dominated Czechoslovakia.
! Louise Rainer is back after a five
year absence. Nobody's missed her.
And for now it's "so long" from
i this reviewer. Good-bye, good luck
! —and take it easy!— Dick Bower
