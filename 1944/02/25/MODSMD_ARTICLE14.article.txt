## MURALS Roble Hashers Rout Firemen 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Turning what was expected to be
a close game into a rout, the Roble
Hashers swamped the top contender
lor the league crown, the Firehouse,
> a decisive score of 52 to 18, last
night on the deck of the Pavilion.
By this hands-down win, the high
ly touted Hasher five virtually put
the title on ice, in their ice-box.
Watson Leads Winners
Leon Watso ncame through in true
form to take the scoring honors for
the winners by sinking a total of 16
points. He was really in top shape
as he sank buckets from all sides of
the hardwood, and was up on his
defensive ball as well.
Watson was closely followed by his
two teammates, Jim Burke and Jim
Travis, with each of the boys coming
up for 12 points, and contributing
plenty of general fire to the other
wise cold game.
Smith Leads Firemen
Gene Smith held up the Fire
house's end of the tussle by tallying
13 points, and contributing to the
little fire that the losers had. The
Firehouse certainly wasn't in its top
form last night, for had they been,
they could have at least given Roble
a fairly even game.
However, all teams have their ups
and downs, and this down came just
at the wrong time, for by their loss,
the Firemen practically handed
Roble the league crown on a silver
platter.
More Defaults
Adams Hall defaulted to Cleve
land, while Arthur did the same
favor for Lincoln. It has been re
uested that any team who has given
op and will not show for any more
of their games this season, will please
notify Mr. Wolters of the fact so
that he may drop (hem from the
schedule and give their future op
ponents "byes."
