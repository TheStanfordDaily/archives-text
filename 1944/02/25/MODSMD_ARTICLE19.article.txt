# Skirts Down, Hair Up In '30's---Mrs. Neilson
## 
### NANCY TILDEN 
Mrs. Frances Neilson, present di
rector of Lagunita Court, when asked
about the changes in campus life
since her student days in 1934 and
1935, answered, laughing, "Well, for
one tiling we certainly looked differ
ent. The girls wore their skirts
closer to the ankle than the knee
and our short hair styles—close-fin
ger or Marcell waves with here and
there a wind-blown bob hung over
from the twenties —made us look
much older."
The now classic skirt, sweater, and
bobby socks were very rare indeed,
dresses with huge collars or bows
being the "thing" and silk stocking
bills something monstrous to con
sider, according to Mrs. Neilson.
Dirty Stanford Rough
"Of course the Stanford 'rough'
was still just that and dirty cords
were the 'roughs" popular, almost
inevitable wear."
Mrs. Neilson found it difficult to
make comparisons as she has been
on campus almost continuously since
she entered Stanford as a junior
transfer in the fall of 1933. After
graduation in 1935 she returned to
act as resident assistant for one year
and stafl member in the Dean of
Women's office for two years, leaving
in 1939 to be married. When her
husband went in '42 she returned
once more to take up her present job
as director of Lagunita.
However, she said she felt there
has been a "most gratifying change
in the concentration of social life."
Her student days were the days of
2:3o's and gasoline and Stanford's
social life centered much more
around San Francisco.
Trio Member
It is interesting to note here that
Mrs. Neilson, then Frances Terrell,
was one of a singing trio that used to
entertain at farm dances, rallies, and
at the Palace on Stanford nights.
"The war has made a concentration
of social activity on campus neces
sary and our really unusual facilities
for entertainme nt are now being
used for the first time." As examples
she mentioned the popularity of La
gunita's social rooms, the court and
the ping-pong table.
She also remarked that "consider
ing the war, the scope of social acti
vities has rather increased than de
creased." The social calendar is, she
believes, just as full as it ever was
in the "good old days" despite the
speeded-up academic program and
the many hours spent in war work
each month.
Vocational Change
"There has also been a big change
in the vocational outlook for wom
en," she said. "In 1935 we used to
bull-session on how long we would
have to pound San Francisco's pave
ment before being able to convince

an employer that we, with a college
education, really had something.
Now the problem is not finding a job
but choosing between the many jobs
open."
"We used to be quite happy to ac
cept jobs beginning at $80 to $90 a
month—of course with assurance of
'immediate' advancement. Today
graduating Stanford women hesitate
to accept anything less than $150 a
month," Mrs. Neilson went on.
New Buildings
Physically also the campus was
very different in '35, according io
Mrs. Neilson. The Memorial Theater
had not yet been built —"it went up
in 1936." Neither the Hoover War
Libe nor the Ed building was yet in
existence either.
"Lagunita opened its doors for the
first time in '34 and seemed to us a
long way off campus," she reported.
Mrs. Neilson, the then Frances
Terrell, was among the group of
women who pioneered in Union in
1933, the same year that she entered
Stanford. Up until then it had been
a men's dorm and the "roughs" still
remembered their old rooms.
More Women Come
The use of Union as a women's
dorm had been occasioned by lifting
the "old 500" limit to 800. This change
came just as Mrs. Neilson entered in
'33 and the new women were fighting
to hold their own on campus.

but choosing between the many jobs
open."
"We used to be quite happy to ac
cept jobs beginning at $80 to $90 a
month—of course with assurance of
'immediate' advancement. Today
graduating Stanford women hesitate
to accept anything less than $150 a
month," Mrs. Neilson went on.
New Buildings
Physically also the campus was
very different in '35, according io
Mrs. Neilson. The Memorial Theater
had not yet been built —"it went up
in 1936." Neither the Hoover War
Libe nor the Ed building was yet in
existence either.
"Lagunita opened its doors for the
first time in '34 and seemed to us a
long way off campus," she reported.
Mrs. Neilson, the then Frances
Terrell, was among the group of
women who pioneered in Union in
1933, the same year that she entered
Stanford. Up until then it had been
a men's dorm and the "roughs" still
remembered their old rooms.
More Women Come
The use of Union as a women's
dorm had been occasioned by lifting
the "old 500" limit to 800. This change
came just as Mrs. Neilson entered in
'33 and the new women were fighting
to hold their own on campus.
Mrs. Frances Neilson, present di
rector of Lagunita Court, when asked
about the changes in campus life
since her student days in 1934 and
1935, answered, laughing, "Well, for
one tiling we certainly looked differ
ent. The girls wore their skirts
closer to the ankle than the knee
and our short hair styles—close-fin
ger or Marcell waves with here and
there a wind-blown bob hung over
from the twenties —made us look
much older."
The now classic skirt, sweater, and
bobby socks were very rare indeed,
dresses with huge collars or bows
being the "thing" and silk stocking
bills something monstrous to con
sider, according to Mrs. Neilson.
Dirty Stanford Rough
"Of course the Stanford 'rough'
was still just that and dirty cords
were the 'roughs" popular, almost
inevitable wear."
Mrs. Neilson found it difficult to
make comparisons as she has been
on campus almost continuously since
she entered Stanford as a junior
transfer in the fall of 1933. After
graduation in 1935 she returned to
act as resident assistant for one year
and stafl member in the Dean of
Women's office for two years, leaving
in 1939 to be married. When her
husband went in '42 she returned
once more to take up her present job
as director of Lagunita.
However, she said she felt there
has been a "most gratifying change
in the concentration of social life."
Her student days were the days of
2:3o's and gasoline and Stanford's
social life centered much more
around San Francisco.
Trio Member
It is interesting to note here that
Mrs. Neilson, then Frances Terrell,
was one of a singing trio that used to
entertain at farm dances, rallies, and
at the Palace on Stanford nights.
"The war has made a concentration
of social activity on campus neces
sary and our really unusual facilities
for entertainme nt are now being
used for the first time." As examples
she mentioned the popularity of La
gunita's social rooms, the court and
the ping-pong table.
She also remarked that "consider
ing the war, the scope of social acti
vities has rather increased than de
creased." The social calendar is, she
believes, just as full as it ever was
in the "good old days" despite the
speeded-up academic program and
the many hours spent in war work
each month.
Vocational Change
"There has also been a big change
in the vocational outlook for wom
en," she said. "In 1935 we used to
bull-session on how long we would
have to pound San Francisco's pave
ment before being able to convince

an employer that we, with a college
education, really had something.
Now the problem is not finding a job
but choosing between the many jobs
open."
"We used to be quite happy to ac
cept jobs beginning at $80 to $90 a
month—of course with assurance of
'immediate' advancement. Today
