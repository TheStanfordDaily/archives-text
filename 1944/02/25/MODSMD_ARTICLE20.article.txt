# Californian's Art Shown in Gallery
## 
### 
Now on exhibition at the Stanford
Ait Gallery is the work of Miss M.
deNeale Morgan, prominent Califor
nia artist who is best known for her
paintings of the sea, sand dunes, and
the old cypress for which Carmel and
Monterey Bay have become artis
tically famous.
A member of one of California's
early families, Miss Morgan has been
active in the art growth and de
velopment of San Francisco, Oak
land, and Monterey. Her work has
been exhibited in California and in
New York, Chicago, Philadelphia,
Washington, Baltimore, and other
Eastern cities.
Miss Morgan, according to Pedro
deLemos, director of the Art Gallery,
is one of the few persons to become
students of William Keith, Califor
nia's Old Master, and she has been
recently acclaimed as "attaining the
highest place of all Keith's pupils, as
an artist."
"This exhibition is proof of the
artist's range of color expression and
versatility, but her main accomplish
ment is that of the strength and vigor
of her technique," Mr. deLemos
stated.
The exhibition will continue into
the first week of March at the Gal
lery which is open to the public
every day of the week between the
hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m.
