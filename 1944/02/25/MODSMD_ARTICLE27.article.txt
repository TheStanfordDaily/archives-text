### Nada Skidmore 
"Roble freshmen come and go, but
Mrs. Mort, the night assistant, and I
seem to go on forever," Miss Rosa
mond Clarke, director of Roble Hall,
commented as a Daily photographer
took her picture and a Daily re
porter asTced for an interview simul
taneously.
Relaxing for a moment in her of
fice, Miss Clarke, "Roz" to Stanford
contemporaries, admitted that she
had once stood before the director s
desk as a student. "I entered Stan
ford in the fall of 1926," she said,
"'and received by A.B. in history in
1930 and my M.A. in 1932."
Lockout Penalties
During those days on the Farm,
occasionally Stanford women who
kid lockouts were assigned work at
iTie Convalescent home as a penalty.
"I really did spend quite a bit of
my time one week washing windows
and weeding pansy beds," Miss
Clarke reminisced. "It wasn't long
before the Con Home, in despera
tion, asked that some other penalty
be found for evil-doers." The pro
portion of workers had grown so
that the unprotected pansies were
fighting for existence under the on
slaught of zealous Stanford women.
Old "500"
The days of the "500" were ones
of constant change ... in campus
customs, traditions, and familiar
landmarks. Roble's director laughed,
"I was here the exciting day when
the President of the University al
lowed women students to smoke. It
was in the middle of my freshman
year . . . and for a while everyone
in Roble was puffing away."
She continued, "Another innova
tion came when a group of us cam
paigned for a new Women's Gym
nasium to replace the old Wood
pecker Hall. After 'wearing down'
the members of the Board of Ath
letic Control, we eventually suc
ceeded in getting funds for the proj
ect."
Depression Years
Miss Clark compares the years
when she was a student to the Stan
ford life of 1941.
"We were just on the verge of the
k pression years in the late 1920 s,'
'e said, "but we failed to realize
that hard times were so close to us.
After the blow fell, we had to dis
card our false values and the old
ideas of campus life in a way simi
lar to what is happening today."
"The students seem to bo more
serious since the beginning of the
war," Miss Clarke commented.
"Their ideas and actions are more
mature, even if many are slow to
become aware of world problems.
It's good to see Women's Conference
encouraging more get - togethers
Irnong the women students. It's a
nc way to promote friendship

j among the various living groups."
Miss Clarke has been (be friend
of many college students since she
: began her career as assistant direc
j tor of a residence and student coun
i selor at Scripps College in 1936. She
returned to Stanford in 1938 to serve
oft the stall of Miss Mary Yost, who
| had been her counselor during her
' undergraduate years. She has been
j a part of three University residences
i since then, as assistant director of
| Lagunita, director of Union for two
years, and as Roble's director for the
third year.
"I think it's a privilege to be one
of the few people on campus who
can grow to know the freshman
women, and I follow them through
! their four years at the University
with deep interest." Miss Clarke
said. She added, "I wish we could
write a book . . . Memoirs of Roble";
Stanford women who have heard
Miss Clarke say that there will
always be a welcome for them at
I Roble, agree with her strong belief,
j "The spirit of Roble is something
that lasts throughout all the years."

Relaxing for a moment in her of
fice, Miss Clarke, "Roz" to Stanford
contemporaries, admitted that she
had once stood before the director s
desk as a student. "I entered Stan
ford in the fall of 1926," she said,
"'and received by A.B. in history in
1930 and my M.A. in 1932."
Lockout Penalties
During those days on the Farm,
occasionally Stanford women who
kid lockouts were assigned work at
iTie Convalescent home as a penalty.
"I really did spend quite a bit of
my time one week washing windows
and weeding pansy beds," Miss
Clarke reminisced. "It wasn't long
before the Con Home, in despera
tion, asked that some other penalty
be found for evil-doers." The pro
portion of workers had grown so
that the unprotected pansies were
fighting for existence under the on
slaught of zealous Stanford women.
Old "500"
The days of the "500" were ones
of constant change ... in campus
customs, traditions, and familiar
landmarks. Roble's director laughed,
"I was here the exciting day when
the President of the University al
lowed women students to smoke. It
was in the middle of my freshman
year . . . and for a while everyone
in Roble was puffing away."
She continued, "Another innova
tion came when a group of us cam
paigned for a new Women's Gym
nasium to replace the old Wood
pecker Hall. After 'wearing down'
the members of the Board of Ath
letic Control, we eventually suc
ceeded in getting funds for the proj
ect."
Depression Years
Miss Clark compares the years
when she was a student to the Stan
ford life of 1941.
"We were just on the verge of the
k pression years in the late 1920 s,'
'e said, "but we failed to realize
that hard times were so close to us.
After the blow fell, we had to dis
card our false values and the old
ideas of campus life in a way simi
lar to what is happening today."
"The students seem to bo more
serious since the beginning of the
war," Miss Clarke commented.
"Their ideas and actions are more
mature, even if many are slow to
become aware of world problems.
It's good to see Women's Conference
encouraging more get - togethers
Irnong the women students. It's a
nc way to promote friendship

j among the various living groups."
Miss Clarke has been (be friend
of many college students since she
: began her career as assistant direc
j tor of a residence and student coun
i selor at Scripps College in 1936. She
returned to Stanford in 1938 to serve
oft the stall of Miss Mary Yost, who

' undergraduate years. She has been
j a part of three University residences
i since then, as assistant director of
| Lagunita, director of Union for two
years, and as Roble's director for the
third year.
"I think it's a privilege to be one
of the few people on campus who
can grow to know the freshman
women, and I follow them through
! their four years at the University
with deep interest." Miss Clarke
said. She added, "I wish we could
write a book . . . Memoirs of Roble";
Stanford women who have heard
Miss Clarke say that there will
always be a welcome for them at
I Roble, agree with her strong belief,
