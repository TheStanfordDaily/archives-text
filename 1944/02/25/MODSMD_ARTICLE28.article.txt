### 
Professor Lewis Mumford of the
; School of Humanities will deliver
! the sermon at the Memorial Church
this Sunday at 11 a.m. The text of
i the sermon, taken from the Gospel
of Matthew, is: "They that endure
shall be saved," Mr. Mumford said,
j Professor Mumford is author of
t "Sticks and Stones," "The Golden
! Day," "Faith for Living," and other
j books. He has written another book,
[ which will be published in a few
I weeks, called "The Condition of
i Man," Dr. Michael William, editor
of "The Commonweal," said of Mr.
I Mumford, "... I leel no hesitancy
j in saying that he is one of the Amer
ican authors who really matter."
At an interview Professor Mum-
I ford made the statement that the
I Romans were more wrong at the be
| ginning of the Christian era, when
I they assumed civilization would not
j end, than were others who felt it
might. We have not gone as far as
the Romans went, Mr. Mumford said,
but we are going in the same direc
j tion. With the acceleration of our
I modern civilization, we could reach
disaster in a shorter length of time
; than did the Romans.
i A sign that this situation is taking
over is the bombing of civilians by
I the Allies. We must not stop fight
j ing, Mr. Mumford said, but we need
} to direct our efforts at the German
army, not the civilians. Bombing
civilians increases war costs, and at
no time have we found that it short
ens the war.
"Such action may be prolonging
the war," he said. "It would be
better to have 100.000 Allied sol
diers die when defeating the Ger
man army, than kill a comparable
number of civilians.

we have beaten the German army,"
