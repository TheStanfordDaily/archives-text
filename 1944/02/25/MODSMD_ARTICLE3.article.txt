Stanford students are urged to support the Red Cross War Fund Drive
being held on this campus from March 1 to 8 to the extent of $3,000, which
is the quota chosen by the student committee, according to Cheri Martin,
chairman of the campus drive.
Stanford students have not been asleep to the need of the Red Cross

activities maintained on this campus,
as indicated by the support given to
them throughout Autumn and Win
ter quarters.
The most important function of the
Red Cross has been its contribution
of blood plasma to the fronts, accord
ing to Gen. Dwight Eisenhower. Pat
Patten, chairman of the Stanford
Blood Bank, has announced that the
Farm has filled its quota of 50 pints
every two weeks without exception.
Last week the sign-up sheet con
tained five more names than were
requested. March lti is the next date
for blood contributions, according to
Miss Patten.
Surgical dressings are being made
each week-day in the Red Cross
room of the Women's Clubhouse.
Hours for bandage-rolling are as
signed to each women's living group,
and have thus far been filled reason
ably well, according to Carol Hur
witz, War Board chairman.
The nurses' aide training is also
offered to Stanford women, and those
that have completed this are con
tinually working at the Palo Alto
Hospital in order to complete the 150
hours of duty required of them.
The Motor Corps in Palo Alto has
several Stanford girls in its service,
according to Virginia Schwartz, ac
tive member. Their duties include
'ransportation to and from the local
hospitals, in meeting emergencies
and in performing errands. Hour sof
service for these girls are on Thurs
