When the first furor over the re
cent AP bulletin (the one about
ASTP, remember?) subsided, frater
nity houses and dormitories echoed
with rumor upon rumor: ". . . all
men were to get commissions . . .
all noncoms were to be busted . . .
all men were to go to the infantry
. . . all men were to go to the air
corps, cavalry, coast artillery, and
paratroops, in that order ... all men
were to get Section B's.' And on
into the night.
The best summary we've heard of
the entire situation was a reply to
a newly arrived and bewildered
AST's question, "B-b-but, can they
do this to us?"
"Brother," came the answer
from a knowing sergeant, "they
sure can!"

Campus Comments
Since the new closing hours of the
Nitery, we understand that visitors
may be entertained in the Encina
and Toyon day rooms. . . . The cam
pus bridge tournament is running
along on schedule. Each battalion
is supposed to have eliminated all
but a winning team by this Sunday.
. . . Bob Bien of Co. A had the no
table distinction of launching a lib
erty ship in San Francisco last week.
Play Stuff
Dick Best of Co. F can't keep
away from a mirror backstage at
the Ram's Head One-Act rehear
sals. His part in "Death in the
Limelight" calls for civilian
clothes, and you can bet he's not
objecting to it. . . . Conversely,
Roger Brander, one of the leads
in the same play, will change his
civilian clothes for O.D.'s after the
One-Acts are over. He's entering
the Army early in March. . . â– 
Lots of hustle and hustle back
stage, too, as the One-Acts get
ready for tonight's opening per
formance. They look quite good.

More one-act plays are on the line
for March, as David Sievers of the
Speech Department presents the
'Army Play by Play" series. The
all-soldier cast will put on three of
the plays that were presented on
Broadway last year. By the way,
they still have openings for a few
small parts. If you're interested,
drop down to the Little Theater be
tween five and six o'clock (p.m.).
