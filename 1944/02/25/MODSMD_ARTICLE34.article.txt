# It's Too Bad

### 
It's too bad that ASTP in its present large proportions is fold
ing, thus terminating for the time being the studies of hundreds
of soldier-students on the Stanford campus.
And while discussing deplorable subjects we might add that
it's too bad that we had to interrupt our education and our careers
to come to the army in the first place.
In fact it's too bad that there's a war.
But there is, and no amount oi lamentation will alter the
fact. Our goal now should be to get the damnable thing over
with as soon as possible so that all of us can go home.
If high War Department officials, with the advantage of an
over-all perspective of the war picture, think that this goal can
be more speedily attained by taking the bulk of the present
trainees out of the ASTP program, it's our job as soldiers to go
along with this decision with the minimum amount of bad humor
and the maximum amount of determination to make good wher
ever we are shipped from Stanford.
Any complaint on the part of ASTP students about "sacrific
ing" good berths in other branches of the services to come to
ASTP, only to have the props knocked from under the program,
is so much poppycock. Individual benefit and opportunity from
the program have beeen great even if the courses are to be
interrupted. Those who have not benefitted did not deserve to
participate in ASTP in the first place.
Any mention of "sacrifice" lelative to curtailment of ASTP
at a time when thousands of Americans are sacrificing life
itself, borders on sacrilege.
The prospect of leaving Stanford soon for some combat outfit
may seem cause for a let-up in effort for our remaining days or
weeks here. But it doesn't require an AGCT score of 115 or
better to perceive the silliness of surrendering to such an im
pulse. Col. John R. Eden, commandant of ASTU 3905, wasn't
talking through a brass hat when he declared last week:
"Trainees are reminded that regardless of the status of the
ASTP, good judgment dictates their whole-hearted application
to the task in hand. Their written record in the ASTP, both
academic and otherwise, should be one each can take with
pride to any future assignment. This implies continuing effort
on the part of each, until his ASTP assignment is completed."
