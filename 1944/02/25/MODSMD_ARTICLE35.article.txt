# Co. I Trounces Co. H In Rousing Last Half
## 
### 
Moving well into the lead after a dismal first half, the strong Co. I quintet
I lapped the Co. H hoopsters, 65-32, Wednesday evening. The first half,
i which found Co. I ahead. 22-18, was a slow-moving affair dominated by
inaccurate shooting, poor ball handling and sloppy field generalship.
Sparked by Kuhn with 24 points, Lowe with 20, and Kleinjans with 17,
■-»the Dutchmen began applying pres-

sure in the early stages of the second
half and did not relent until the final
gun had sounded. It was basket
after basket in those final 20 minutes
as the Co. 1 squad found themselves
and their famed scoring punch. It
was merely a question of time, and
when the score started mounting Co.
H started fading. Only the yeoman
work of Schnebeck kept the Engi
neers in the contest and prevented
the Dutchmen from running the
score up higher.
Other "A" Game
The other "A" league game,
Wednesday, saw a weak Co. K outfit
bow to the Co. A five, 51-27. Devine
of the winners was the high scorer
with 15 counters. In the "B" league
affairs, Co. X trounced the Co. H
squad, 51-30, Gaga showing the way
with 17 markers. The fourth game of
the evening was won by Co. A's "B"
team via the default route from Co.
K.
Monday night's contests were fea
tured by one of the more notable
upsets of the season. The previously
undefeated Co. C first team bowed to
the twice humbled Co. G quintet,
49-45. Nagy, high man with 21 points
and. one of. the. better, basketeers
around Stanford, provided the spark
that toppled Co. C from the elite
company of Companies I and E.
Co. E and Co. B met in the second
"A" league contest that evening. Co.
E. of the 6-0 record, managed to
come out on top in one of their poor
est showings, 47-33. In the "B"
league, Co. G trounced Co. C, 31-19,
and Co. E almost doubled Co. B,

tured by one of the more notable
upsets of the season. The previously
undefeated Co. C first team bowed to
the twice humbled Co. G quintet,
49-45. Nagy, high man with 21 points
and. one of. the. better, basketeers
around Stanford, provided the spark
that toppled Co. C from the elite
company of Companies I and E.
Co. E and Co. B met in the second
"A" league contest that evening. Co.
E. of the 6-0 record, managed to
come out on top in one of their poor
est showings, 47-33. In the "B"
league, Co. G trounced Co. C, 31-19,
and Co. E almost doubled Co. B,
31-17.
Moving well into the lead after a dismal first half, the strong Co. I quintet
I lapped the Co. H hoopsters, 65-32, Wednesday evening. The first half,
i which found Co. I ahead. 22-18, was a slow-moving affair dominated by
inaccurate shooting, poor ball handling and sloppy field generalship.
Sparked by Kuhn with 24 points, Lowe with 20, and Kleinjans with 17,
■-»the Dutchmen began applying pres-

sure in the early stages of the second
half and did not relent until the final
gun had sounded. It was basket
after basket in those final 20 minutes
as the Co. 1 squad found themselves
and their famed scoring punch. It
was merely a question of time, and
when the score started mounting Co.
H started fading. Only the yeoman
work of Schnebeck kept the Engi
neers in the contest and prevented
the Dutchmen from running the
score up higher.
