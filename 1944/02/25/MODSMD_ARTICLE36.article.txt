### ARTHUR SHAPIRO 
Herc it comes, boys, like a snow- '
ball, rolling down an incline, picking j
up speed and importance as it api
proaches. Yes sir, the Co. E-Co. I ]
basketball game is just around the j
corner. Monday night 'tis the date.
A long way back, Feb. 4, to be
exact, 1 predicted in this pillar that,
when the two teams tangled, the fate
of the Colonel Eden Hoop Tourney
■would be hanging in the balance.
And so it is.
One couldn't ask for a more dra
matic setting. The finale of Hamlet
has nothing on this set-up as far as
timing, importance and suspense are
concerned.
Share Lead
Both teams are at present sharing
the league lead with six victories
apiece. The major hurdles are be
hind, and now only this clash re- I
mains to be cleared by the Engineers I
or Dutchmen.
To win this game is to win the |
tournament. A few games will re
main for each aggregation, but they
should be taken in stride. The only
other squad capable of upsetting this
balance of power is Co. C, whose
record of four and one places them
in the position of the "dark horse"
in the round-robin affair.
Now. as to all sport writers, I have
reached the distasteful part of the

! column. Every columnist is ex
pected to voice his opinons as to the
eventual victor of any forthcoming
I contest. So here I am right behind
! the eight-ball with a dead-line to
I beat.
Both fives have displayed amaz
ing scoring abilities. Perhaps Co. E
has a slight edge in this field, but
this advantage is canceled out by
virtue of the Dutchers' superior de
fensive play. It's give and take in
every single department. Neither
team stands appreciably above the
other in any one single phase of the
game, except in length of play to
gether; and that, patient readers, is
the rub.
Co. I Veterans
For some six months now, the
Dutchmen of Co. I have played to
gether, never breaking up, never
I reaching out for more candidates,
i Each boy is an integral part of the
j overall machinery. The faults, fai 1 -
j ings, abilities, and failures of each
and every one are known to all con
cerned. Experience is a great teach
er, and that's one commodity Co. I
has plenty to spare. Co. I. 55-50.
Let's all be out there Monday
night. Time—2l3o, place—the Gym,
admission—free to all, soldier or ci
vilian. Let's make this the stand-out
athletic event of the season. "Two
tickets on the aisle, please."

Now. as to all sport writers, I have
reached the distasteful part of the

! column. Every columnist is ex
pected to voice his opinons as to the
eventual victor of any forthcoming
I contest. So here I am right behind
! the eight-ball with a dead-line to
I beat.
Both fives have displayed amaz
ing scoring abilities. Perhaps Co. E
has a slight edge in this field, but
this advantage is canceled out by
virtue of the Dutchers' superior de
fensive play. It's give and take in
every single department. Neither
team stands appreciably above the
other in any one single phase of the
game, except in length of play to
gether; and that, patient readers, is
the rub.
Co. I Veterans
For some six months now, the
Dutchmen of Co. I have played to
gether, never breaking up, never
I reaching out for more candidates,
i Each boy is an integral part of the
j overall machinery. The faults, fai 1 -
j ings, abilities, and failures of each
and every one are known to all con
cerned. Experience is a great teach
er, and that's one commodity Co. I
has plenty to spare. Co. I. 55-50.
Let's all be out there Monday
night. Time—2l3o, place—the Gym,
admission—free to all, soldier or ci
vilian. Let's make this the stand-out
athletic event of the season. "Two
tickets on the aisle, please."
Herc it comes, boys, like a snow- '
ball, rolling down an incline, picking j
up speed and importance as it api
proaches. Yes sir, the Co. E-Co. I ]
basketball game is just around the j
corner. Monday night 'tis the date.
A long way back, Feb. 4, to be
exact, 1 predicted in this pillar that,
when the two teams tangled, the fate
of the Colonel Eden Hoop Tourney
■would be hanging in the balance.
And so it is.
One couldn't ask for a more dra
matic setting. The finale of Hamlet
has nothing on this set-up as far as
timing, importance and suspense are
concerned.
Share Lead
Both teams are at present sharing
the league lead with six victories
apiece. The major hurdles are be
hind, and now only this clash re- I
mains to be cleared by the Engineers I
or Dutchmen.
To win this game is to win the |
tournament. A few games will re
main for each aggregation, but they
should be taken in stride. The only
other squad capable of upsetting this
balance of power is Co. C, whose
record of four and one places them
in the position of the "dark horse"
in the round-robin affair.
