# No New facts On AST Slash

### 
Military headquarters here had
not received detailed War Depart
ment instructions by yesterday as to
the exact number of Stanford AST
trainees to be alYected by last week's
directive curtailing the Army Spe
cialized Training Program to 35,000
men by April 1.
Meanwhile preparations were un
der way to award a diploma of spe
cial graduation to each trainee who
is separated from the program be
cause of the curtailment order.
Bear Signatures
The certificate will bear the signa
tures of University authorities and
Col. John R. Eden, Commandant of
ASTU 3905. It will be awarded only
to those students who complete their
assignment here with satisfactory
academic and military records.
The service records of these men
will also carry the notation of "spe
cial graduation" from the program.
There is no change in the present
policy of accepting applications for
aviation cadet training from AST
trainees here, despite the ASTP cur
tailment directive. Colonel Eden
pointed out yesterday that such ap
plications could also be filed by a
trainee at his next station.
