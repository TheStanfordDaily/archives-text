# Angry House Overrides Roosevelt's Tax Veto
## 
### 
WASHINGTON, Feb. 24 (UP) — Declaring its legislative independence
from the White House, a rebellious Congress today dealt President Roose
velt a 1-2 punch when the House overrode his tax bill veto and Senate
Democrats unanimously re-elected Senator Alben W. Barkley of Kentucky
as their floor leader—not the administration's.

For Mr Roosevelt it was perhaps
the blackest day in his 11 years of
relations with Congress. He lost his
hitherto devoted leader in the Sen
ate, suffered a major defeat on fiscal
policy and, from all indications, was
shorn of most of his influence in the
legislative halls.
The triple disaster, which may
vitally affect fourth term possibili
ties, was occasioned by his blistering
veto of the $2,315,000,000 tax bill,
which he branded as a special privi
lege measure.
Smouldering rebellion burst into
full flame. The House, shouting down
attempts of administrationists to be
heard, overrode the veto 299 to 95—
or 36 more than the necessary two
thirds.
Only 89 Democrats voted to sus
tain, along with 3 Republicans, 2
Progressives, and 1 more. In con
trast 99 Democrats, 199 Republicans,
and 1 Farmer-Laborite voted to
override.
Tomorrow the veto comes up in
the Senate.
Shortly before the House acted.
Senate Democrats accepted Bark
ley's resignation as Mr. Roosevelt's
hand-picked Senate Majority Leader
and then immediately voted unaiv
mously to reinstate him—this time is
their leader—and gave him a vote
of confidence.
(Senator Alben W. Barkley to
night formally notified President
Roosevelt he had retained the Sen
ate Democratic leadership only at the
insistence of his colleagues, but he
hoped his resignation and re-election
would work toward closer harmony
between the White House and Con
gress.)
