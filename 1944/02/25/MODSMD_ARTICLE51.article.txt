Hippity hop
For a lollypop—
A candy stick,
Or cane to lick.
Where bon-bon babies
Are Candyland ladies.
Sugar plums—Oooo!
Jelly beans too,
And candy hearts.
Or sugary tarts.
Gingerbread men
Are a dime for ten;
And animal crackers.
Delicious snackers!
So get on your feet
And come be sweet;
Let's fill the Pavilion
At the Candy Cotillion!
