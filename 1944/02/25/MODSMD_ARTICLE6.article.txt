Featuring songs of Schubert—four
on the program and two as encores—
Marian Anderson sang Wednesday
night to a sold-out house in Me
morial Hall. As much tor her char
acteristic reserve as the phenomenon
which is her singing. Miss Anderson
is always a relief from the effusive
majority, 01. her. profession., who
freeze unfelt smiles upon their faces
and abound in pretended gracious
ness.
Well the outstanding number of
our comely and sedate contralto was
"Poor Me,'' one oi the spiritual
; ; roup, low-pitched, sustained, and
absolutely finished in its execution.
And though her lorte is flowing
melody, she included about an equal
number of fast selections, such as a
couple of the Schubert Lieder and
the "Se Florindo a fedele" of A.
Scarlatti, which were fairly rippled
off.
Most enjoyed by the audience were
probably the partly talked spiritual,
"Ain't No Hidin' Place Down There,"
a novelty ballad. "Cuckoo," and the
inevitable closing "Ave Maria"—all
three encores.
Up to the concluding group of
spirituals, incidentally, the program
was arranged chronologically, in
cluding selections from the 17th to
the 20th centuries. The lament
"When I Am Laid in Earth" which
closes Purcell's "Dido and Aeneas,"
opened the recital, and was the only
number not up to par, or her record
ing (Victor 17257) which is the
standard phonographic impression of
that music.
Miss Anderson sang also two com
positions of Haydn, "La vie" and
"My Mother Bids Me Bind My Hair";
Massenet's aria, "Pleurez mes yeux"
from "Le Cid"; and a group of con
temporary works including Vaughn
Williams' "Silent Noon."
