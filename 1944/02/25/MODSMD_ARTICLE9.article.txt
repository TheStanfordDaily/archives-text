"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY
IT GOES"
By Faith Birdwin
(Pamela is greeted by Christopher, who has
returned after fifteen months overseas.)
He says:
"It's been months since I've seen a white wo
man. You know what I'd really like to do more
than anything on this earth? I'd like to . . .
take you to Stanford and go to the Ram's Head
One-Acts tonight."
Pamela was warmed to her tiny toes by Chris'
thoughtfulness. What a ruddy angel he was.
"I'd adore to Chris, but I musn't tire myself
out by gadding about every night. You see I
have a date for Sunday night with Wesley.
We're going to the Tillson Talkies to see that
excellent cinema 'Angels Over Broadway,' and
I'll think of you."
The air was pregnant with gloomy silence as
Christopher hung his head and cried bitter tears.
Pamela poked him in the ribs and said:
"Don't cry, Chris, I can't bear to see you cry.
If there's one think I can't tolerate it's your
bawling. Don't cry."
Christopher manfully dried his bloodshot
eyes and whispered:
"Oh my one, I must know if you still
feel the same way about me ... do you still
have that old feeling?"
"Yes, I'm simply starved. Let's go in the
kitchen and whip up some Toll House cookies
. . . I haven't forgotten; they're your favorites,
are they not?"
Chris' expression changed magically to one
of utter delight. "Oh ecstasy! Will they have
lumps of chocolate too?"
Pamela softly placed her hand upon his arm
and sighed, "Natch."
And so the two young things wended their
way to the kitchen, arm in arm, and started to
putter around . . . with pots and pans.
Just as the heady scent of cookies was waftng
through the house, the telephone jangled omi
nously. Pamela climbed out of the oven and
picked up the phone.
"Hello . . . yes . . . yes ... oh I couldn't. Oh
I wouldn't dare! Really? Well maybe . . . but
it's so late ... oh all right, I'll "

(Pamela is greeted by Christopher, who has
returned after fifteen months overseas.)
He says:
"It's been months since I've seen a white wo
man. You know what I'd really like to do more
than anything on this earth? I'd like to . . .
take you to Stanford and go to the Ram's Head
One-Acts tonight."
Pamela was warmed to her tiny toes by Chris'
thoughtfulness. What a ruddy angel he was.
"I'd adore to Chris, but I musn't tire myself
out by gadding about every night. You see I
have a date for Sunday night with Wesley.
We're going to the Tillson Talkies to see that

Chris' expression changed magically to one
of utter delight. "Oh ecstasy! Will they have
lumps of chocolate too?"
Pamela softly placed her hand upon his arm

And so the two young things wended their
way to the kitchen, arm in arm, and started to
putter around . . . with pots and pans.
Just as the heady scent of cookies was waftng
through the house, the telephone jangled omi
nously. Pamela climbed out of the oven and
picked up the phone.
"Hello . . . yes . . . yes ... oh I couldn't. Oh
I wouldn't dare! Really? Well maybe . . . but
it's so late ... oh all right, I'll "
