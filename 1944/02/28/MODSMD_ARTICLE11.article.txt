# ‘Death in Limelight' Rated Tops
## 
### CYCLONE COVEY 
The Daily might have carried out
j its threat not to review the one-acts
i last weekend, having been denied
! press passes. And it is not now a !
concession to the new dramatics pol- j
icy. but rather the highly meritorious
production of "Death in the Lime- [
j light" which relegates all other con- j
j siderations to the background.
For Peggy Fitts' play was not only ;
: unique among the years of original
■ student one-acts, but easily the best
j play and the best done of the dra
; matic year at Stanford.
With people screaming from the
I audience, going through a trap door [

in the stage, appearing' from the con
trol booth at back, passing in and

and with a stage blackout and even
a song-and-dance act—about the
j only possibility of the Little Theater
our author-director did not utilize
! was suspending spiders from the

How Miss Fitts ever assembled
such a cast is nearly as fantastic as
the play itself. Dick Best took acting
honors for the evening, having en
tered from the audience to the query
"Is there a doctor in the house?" Nat
urally there was nothing more to be
asked in the veteran performances

of Nan Tillson and Jean Levinson.
And whosoever could divert at
tention from Mary Lou Patton long
enough could appreciate also the
fully satisfactory jobs of Stanley
Willis (who was murdered and did
his best work as a corpse), Roger
Bvander, Bud Irving, and Herbert
Rubin. Take any part, or any aspect
of the production, and it was good.
Bill Rose's "Coast to Coast" was
pretty much eclipsed by the speed
and novelty of "Death in the Lime
light." But Fritz Koenig was quite a
show in himself; and John Lievsay,
tiie high school character, was also
disproportionately contributory to
the occasion.
