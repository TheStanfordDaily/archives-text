### JEAN LEVINSON 
An audience can be as entertaining to watch
as a show. Their hilarious or agonized reac
tons to the movie or play before them, is a de
light to see.
There is always the"I get my money's worth"
fan who knocks himself out laughing at every
quip, no matter how pathetic. He leaps up and
down in his seat .... slaps his knee . . . .
claws his neighbor .... and shrieks, "What a
riot! Oh, that slays me! What a riot!"
There there is "Daphne Deadpan," who sits
in her gallery seat, and looks like warmed-up
death. She defies any actor to make her laugh
or cry, or even breathe. She may sniffle men
acingly on occasion, or utter a defiant snore at
times, but she refuses to enjoy her morbid self.
Then there's the"I don't know the score"
member of the audience, and his buddy, "I'll
tell you the setup." "Morton Moron" squirms
in his seat, and always asks what's going on
. . . . "What's he mean? Is she going to kill
him? How does it end?"
His informant brightly keeps up an explana
tory patter of, "Get it, he's the murderer. Naw,
that ain't Bette Davis, that's Deanna Temple."
The most interesting audience member is the
"I throw myself into every part" type. He suf
fers, he cries, he laughs. He fights when the
hero fights, and shoots imaginary guns with a
hissing "pukooo." He mumbles to himself, he
shouts .... and he is a menace to any fem
inine neighbor when the torrid love scenes
start rolling strong.
Watch your neighbor the next time you are
in an audience. Keep an eye on his gaping
mouth, shining eyes, and clenched fists. You'll
enjoy yourself even more than if you'd watch
the performance.
