# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
If the "Realist" who contributed his piece to
Campus Opinion on the 25th of February feels
that his arguments are those of "authority"
versus tradition, he is, I feel, no authority.
In response to his criticism of the Honor Sys
tem at Stanford in light of our four-man police
system, I should like to ask the "Realist" how
many rooms he finds locked, or living group
doors locked, in a tour of the campus.
The presence of these few men, I think, is
almost limited to routine traffic patrol and oc
casionally seeking after suspicious looking
strangers. Criticizing gate-keepers before the
entrance to the stadium is too trite to even invite
response.
To answer his numbered criticisms one by
one:
1. "The Honor System encourages dishon
esty." I think to the contrary. A system of
proctors is far more an open challenge to cheat,
to "beat the game," and a system which holds
very well in high school where the idea of adult
responsiblty has not been fully developed.
Even the teachers will admit that if it comes
to a battle of wits between students and proctors,
there will always be the evil genius who slips

by the watchful eye. It is considered to be
extremely clever to crib under a proctor's nose
2. "The unhealthy frame of mind of those who
report violations." This particular point, a uni
versal attitude, is one which should be ds
couraged. If an individual were to see thievery
committed in a neighbor's room, there would be
no hesitation in reporting the crime.
Is it not crimnal to cheat, to encourage cheat
ing, to abuse personal honor at the expense of
others? The expense, one of them, is the de
gradation of the degree issued by Stanford, and
as such affects every individual here.
A degree cannot be purchased for money
alone, and to attain a thing which has a value
beyond the reach of money to those who re
ceived it honestly—by those who receive it
dishonestly—is a crime to the group, and what
is more, a crime against oneself.
3. "The abuse by an individual harms the
group"—and I agree! For the very reasons
stated above, it becomes the group responsi
bility to either straighten out that individual, or
turn him over to groups who will try to correct
the wrong-doer.
Individuals who fail to maintain themselves
as responsible citizens in the high plane of tol
erence which prevails at a university will have
a bad time when leaving the relatively protected
life of Stanford. It is an important function of a
university to build not only the mind, but the
character.
To pity men and women who haven't crys
talized their principles by college age, "Realist,"
is to pity yourself. Anyone who might concede
himself to be adult and who wished to have
his very thoughts and actions watched as a
criminal, has failed utterly in the ability to dif
ferentiate, as a grown-up should.
In the past months, the Honor Code has been
examined closely by students and faculty, who
all agree that such a system, while not 100 per
cent foolproof, is far and away superior to any
other system which could be adopted.
The reason for the recent campaigns has not
been as a "face-saving" motive, but merely an
educational re-emphasis to raise an already high
standard to an even higher level. We're proud
of having our code recognized throughout the
country and world, and the Stanford degree ac
cepted with greatest respect. The Honor Code is
not only a tradition, but a fact, and an important
part of our campus life.
I am sure that if ever the system were put
to vote, a small minority who disapproved of
honor would be drowned by an overwhelming
chorus of "ayes" in response favoring the code.
Jim Reynolds.

To the Editor:
"Let's abolish the honor system!" says Realist.
Is he afraid of it? Is he a borderline case? Is
he afraid of the tattletales? Does he want to be
watched over like a mama's boy because he
doesn't trust himself?
Yes, Stanford men and women have crystal
lized their principles by college age and deserve
a chance to show them. As for the Stanford
"cop," his duty is to protect the Stanford gentle
man—not punish him. Concerning admission to
the Big Game: Stanford students are not the
sole spectators, and the whole world hasn't
pledged to obey the honor system.
Pollyana and Alice in Wonderland were writ
ten for grammar school students. Does Realist
wish to guote them as authorities? You say j
"We still need ordinary and proper safeguards
in moral conduct." Since when is not the Honor
Code a fulfillment of that? And what do you
class as ordinary?
As regards a student vote: We're willing to
bet the Stanford students would support the
Honor Code a hundred to one.
Although we are freshmen, we already know ■
what the Honor Code means and stands for
and appreciate a chance to prove ourselves
worthy. And we are not afraid—NO—we are
proud to sign our names to these views.

committed in a neighbor's room, there would be
no hesitation in reporting the crime.
Is it not crimnal to cheat, to encourage cheat
ing, to abuse personal honor at the expense of
others? The expense, one of them, is the de
gradation of the degree issued by Stanford, and
as such affects every individual here.
A degree cannot be purchased for money
alone, and to attain a thing which has a value
beyond the reach of money to those who re
ceived it honestly—by those who receive it
dishonestly—is a crime to the group, and what
is more, a crime against oneself.
3. "The abuse by an individual harms the
group"—and I agree! For the very reasons
stated above, it becomes the group responsi
bility to either straighten out that individual, or
turn him over to groups who will try to correct
the wrong-doer.
Individuals who fail to maintain themselves
as responsible citizens in the high plane of tol
erence which prevails at a university will have
a bad time when leaving the relatively protected
life of Stanford. It is an important function of a
university to build not only the mind, but the
character.
To pity men and women who haven't crys
talized their principles by college age, "Realist,"
is to pity yourself. Anyone who might concede
himself to be adult and who wished to have
his very thoughts and actions watched as a
criminal, has failed utterly in the ability to dif
ferentiate, as a grown-up should.
In the past months, the Honor Code has been
examined closely by students and faculty, who
all agree that such a system, while not 100 per
cent foolproof, is far and away superior to any
other system which could be adopted.
The reason for the recent campaigns has not
been as a "face-saving" motive, but merely an
educational re-emphasis to raise an already high
standard to an even higher level. We're proud
of having our code recognized throughout the
country and world, and the Stanford degree ac
cepted with greatest respect. The Honor Code is
not only a tradition, but a fact, and an important
part of our campus life.
I am sure that if ever the system were put
to vote, a small minority who disapproved of
honor would be drowned by an overwhelming
chorus of "ayes" in response favoring the code.

"Let's abolish the honor system!" says Realist.
Is he afraid of it? Is he a borderline case? Is
he afraid of the tattletales? Does he want to be
watched over like a mama's boy because he
doesn't trust himself?
Yes, Stanford men and women have crystal
lized their principles by college age and deserve
a chance to show them. As for the Stanford
"cop," his duty is to protect the Stanford gentle
man—not punish him. Concerning admission to
the Big Game: Stanford students are not the
sole spectators, and the whole world hasn't
pledged to obey the honor system.
Pollyana and Alice in Wonderland were writ
ten for grammar school students. Does Realist
wish to guote them as authorities? You say j
"We still need ordinary and proper safeguards
in moral conduct." Since when is not the Honor
Code a fulfillment of that? And what do you
class as ordinary?
As regards a student vote: We're willing to
bet the Stanford students would support the
Honor Code a hundred to one.
Although we are freshmen, we already know ■
what the Honor Code means and stands for
and appreciate a chance to prove ourselves
worthy. And we are not afraid—NO—we are

To the Editor:
If the "Realist" who contributed his piece to
Campus Opinion on the 25th of February feels
that his arguments are those of "authority"
versus tradition, he is, I feel, no authority.
In response to his criticism of the Honor Sys
tem at Stanford in light of our four-man police
system, I should like to ask the "Realist" how
many rooms he finds locked, or living group
doors locked, in a tour of the campus.
The presence of these few men, I think, is
almost limited to routine traffic patrol and oc
casionally seeking after suspicious looking
strangers. Criticizing gate-keepers before the
entrance to the stadium is too trite to even invite
response.
To answer his numbered criticisms one by
one:
1. "The Honor System encourages dishon
esty." I think to the contrary. A system of
proctors is far more an open challenge to cheat,
to "beat the game," and a system which holds
very well in high school where the idea of adult
responsiblty has not been fully developed.
Even the teachers will admit that if it comes
to a battle of wits between students and proctors,
there will always be the evil genius who slips

by the watchful eye. It is considered to be
extremely clever to crib under a proctor's nose
2. "The unhealthy frame of mind of those who
report violations." This particular point, a uni
versal attitude, is one which should be ds
couraged. If an individual were to see thievery
committed in a neighbor's room, there would be
no hesitation in reporting the crime.

ferentiate, as a grown-up should.
In the past months, the Honor Code has been
examined closely by students and faculty, who
all agree that such a system, while not 100 per

other system which could be adopted.
The reason for the recent campaigns has not
been as a "face-saving" motive, but merely an
educational re-emphasis to raise an already high
standard to an even higher level. We're proud
of having our code recognized throughout the
country and world, and the Stanford degree ac
cepted with greatest respect. The Honor Code is
not only a tradition, but a fact, and an important
part of our campus life.
I am sure that if ever the system were put
to vote, a small minority who disapproved of
honor would be drowned by an overwhelming
chorus of "ayes" in response favoring the code.

"Let's abolish the honor system!" says Realist.
Is he afraid of it? Is he a borderline case? Is
he afraid of the tattletales? Does he want to be
watched over like a mama's boy because he
doesn't trust himself?
Yes, Stanford men and women have crystal
lized their principles by college age and deserve
a chance to show them. As for the Stanford
"cop," his duty is to protect the Stanford gentle
man—not punish him. Concerning admission to
the Big Game: Stanford students are not the
sole spectators, and the whole world hasn't
pledged to obey the honor system.
Pollyana and Alice in Wonderland were writ
ten for grammar school students. Does Realist
wish to guote them as authorities? You say j
"We still need ordinary and proper safeguards
in moral conduct." Since when is not the Honor
Code a fulfillment of that? And what do you
class as ordinary?
As regards a student vote: We're willing to
bet the Stanford students would support the
Honor Code a hundred to one.
Although we are freshmen, we already know ■
what the Honor Code means and stands for
and appreciate a chance to prove ourselves
worthy. And we are not afraid—NO—we are
proud to sign our names to these views.

To the Editor:
If the "Realist" who contributed his piece to
Campus Opinion on the 25th of February feels
that his arguments are those of "authority"
versus tradition, he is, I feel, no authority.
In response to his criticism of the Honor Sys
tem at Stanford in light of our four-man police
system, I should like to ask the "Realist" how
many rooms he finds locked, or living group
doors locked, in a tour of the campus.
The presence of these few men, I think, is
almost limited to routine traffic patrol and oc
casionally seeking after suspicious looking
strangers. Criticizing gate-keepers before the
entrance to the stadium is too trite to even invite
response.
To answer his numbered criticisms one by
one:
1. "The Honor System encourages dishon
esty." I think to the contrary. A system of
proctors is far more an open challenge to cheat,
to "beat the game," and a system which holds
very well in high school where the idea of adult
responsiblty has not been fully developed.
Even the teachers will admit that if it comes
to a battle of wits between students and proctors,
there will always be the evil genius who slips

by the watchful eye. It is considered to be
extremely clever to crib under a proctor's nose
2. "The unhealthy frame of mind of those who
report violations." This particular point, a uni
versal attitude, is one which should be ds
couraged. If an individual were to see thievery
committed in a neighbor's room, there would be
no hesitation in reporting the crime.
Is it not crimnal to cheat, to encourage cheat
ing, to abuse personal honor at the expense of
others? The expense, one of them, is the de
gradation of the degree issued by Stanford, and
as such affects every individual here.
A degree cannot be purchased for money
alone, and to attain a thing which has a value
beyond the reach of money to those who re
ceived it honestly—by those who receive it
dishonestly—is a crime to the group, and what
is more, a crime against oneself.
3. "The abuse by an individual harms the
group"—and I agree! For the very reasons
stated above, it becomes the group responsi
bility to either straighten out that individual, or
turn him over to groups who will try to correct
the wrong-doer.
Individuals who fail to maintain themselves
as responsible citizens in the high plane of tol
erence which prevails at a university will have
a bad time when leaving the relatively protected
life of Stanford. It is an important function of a
university to build not only the mind, but the
character.
To pity men and women who haven't crys
talized their principles by college age, "Realist,"
is to pity yourself. Anyone who might concede
himself to be adult and who wished to have
his very thoughts and actions watched as a
criminal, has failed utterly in the ability to dif
ferentiate, as a grown-up should.
