# Pianist Scores in S.F.

### BARNEY GUGEL 
Jesu Maria Sanroma, noted Latin-
American pianist, was well received
by the San Francisco audiences in a
j pair of concerts with the San Fran
j cisco Orchestra last Friday afternoon
I and Saturday night.
Sanroma was not as convincing in
I his performance of the Mozart A
I Major Concerto as he was in the
Stravinsky Cappriccio, appearing to
be much more at home in the realm
j of modern music. The orchestral ac
] companiment to the Mozart Concerto
j was luzzy and lacked the crisp qual
ity, characteristic of Mozart's music.
The entire second half of the pro-
I gram was far superior to the first
i half, Conductor Pierre Monteux' in

| terpretations of the Cappriccio, the
| Sibelius "Swan of Tuonela," and
j Richard Strauss' Don Juan being
I first rate.
The program opened with the Bee
thoven First Symphony which was
played better than any Beethoven
thus far this season, although the
third movement was taken somewhat
slower and the last movement a bit
| fasten than is generally the case.
In a few weeks, the San Francisco
I Symphony will present, of all things,
a two-day Beethoven Festival, which,
plus two more Beethoven works
scheduled on the regular concerts,
will bring the season total up to 12,
with Brahms, the nevt nearest com
petitor at only four.
