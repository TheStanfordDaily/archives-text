## SLANTING SIDELINES 
### JIM WEINBERG 
As you can see by the above head, SIDELINE SLANTS gives way
today to SLANTING SIDELINES. It will continue to do so in the future
on days when I write the column.
It must have been quite confusing to our readers (assuming that we have
some) to read in SLANTS on one day that USC was a cinch to whip Cal

in their forthcoming basketball
game, and then to read under the
same heading (though a different
byline) on the next day that Cal was
the probable winner.
More confusion resulted when
Roger Corman and I found our
selves aligned on opposite sides in
the question of the advisability of an
immediate return of Stanford teams
to intercollegiate sports.
Contradictions
It was bad enough to find SLANTS
contradicting itself on alternate days
under different bylines, but worse
yet when the byline was omitted
entirely, as happened when Roger
wrote the column a week ago today.
From now on, then, Roger and I
will use different titles for our col
umns. Roger will continue to use
SIDELINE SLANTS, and I will
switch to SLANTING SIDELINES,
at least until oneor both of us comes
up with a more original monicker.
This idea is not a new one, but was
used back in 1941 by Don Selby and
H. D. Thoreau when they traded off
on their column-writing chores. Sel
by stuck to the traditional SIDELINE
SLANTS, while Thoreau wrote
SLANTING SIDELINES.

Class Will Tell
Three truly great basketball play
ers performed at one and the same
time on the floor of the San Fran
cisco Civic Auditorium night before
last, when St. Mary's Preflight played
a rematch with the Coast Guard.
All three of them are Stanford
men. One was Hank Luisetti, the
greatest player of all time. Another
was Jim Pollard, the current pre
tender to Hank's throne. The third
was Howie Dallmar, Jim's teammate
on the great 1942 Stanford team

! which won the N.C.A.A. champion
| ship.
This game provided a splendid op- 1
portunity to compare the merits of
; the three men. As usual, the im
mortal Hankus Pankus emerged on
top. He had one of the best nights of
; his career, and sank 32 points out of
the 48 which Preflight scored to win
j over the Coast Guardsmen, 48-43.
Hank really went wild Saturday I
! night. He scored 14 field goals out of
30 shots from the floor. These in
cluded shots from every angle and ,
! distance, setups and longshots alike. \
