# Firehouse Five Plays Fillmore Tonight at 8:15
## 
### JOE ZUKIN 
i Tonight marks the beginning of
I the end of the intramural basketball
I league as four teams clash on the
| decks of the Encina Gym and the
; Pavilion. With only two and a half
| weeks of play remaining, the league
j crown is all sown up by the unstop
| pable Roble Hashers, in the opinion
iof most intelligent onlookers. The
J Hashers have rambled over the
I toughest opposition the league has to
! offer, and from now on it's just the
I formality of playing the games that
; they have to cope with.
McKinley A vs. Monroe
In one of this evening's featured
; tussles the high-standing McKinley
1 A squad takes on the boys from
Monroe in a game which should be
packed full of plenty of rip roraing
basketball. When Monroe gets go
ing they have plenty of spark, and
could upset the M.HP.D.B.'s, but
we'll string along with McKinley by
about 10 points.
Fillmore vs. Fireliouse
If you're in the mood for a close
ballgame drop around the Encina
Gym tonight at 8:15 and you'll see
a good one. The Firehouse and Fill
more both have good records, and S
hot tussle should be the result of
their meeting. Although Firehouse
claims a slight edge by virtue of a
better percentage in the standings,
we'll pick Fillmore to upset them by
close score.
Gerona A.C. vs. Washington
Tipping off in the Pavilion at 8:15
will be Gerona and Washington in a
game which should also be a fairly
close one. Washington might pull a
fast one and come through to beat
Gerona, but as things stack up from
preceding games it looks as if the
athletic club will take theg ame by
a comfortable margin.
Tyler should take McKinley B,
who have yet to win a game, by
about 30 points.
