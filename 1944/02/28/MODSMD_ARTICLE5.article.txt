U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HEAD
QUARTERS. PEARL HARBOR. Feb.
27 (UP) —Forty Japanese ships were
sunk, probably sunk, or damaged in
the historic Pacific task force attack
of the Japanese Truk naval base
Feb. 16 and 17 instead of 26 as orig
inally announced, Adm. Chester W.
Nimitz revealed today.
Reconnaisance photographs dis
closed that 23 enemy ships were
sunk, 6 probably sunk, and 11 dam
aged.
Previously the score had been 19
enemy ships sunk, and 7 probably
sunk.
Thus Nimitz was able to revise
upwards by more than 50 per cent
the enemy losses in the bold Pacific
Fleet attack in shipping alone, and
in addition the Japanese lost 201
planes destroyed and more than 50
damaged, aside from destruction
wrought in installations of all kinds.
The total of Japanese ships sunk
by the United States alone since the
start of the war is now 1,191.
He revealed also that Navy and
Army planes had made new attacks
on Ponape, and Kusaie at the east
ern end of the Caroline Islands on
the way to Truk and the Marshal!
Island atolls—Wotje, Maloelap, Mili,
and Jaluit—on which an estimated
10,000 Japanese are now isolated.
