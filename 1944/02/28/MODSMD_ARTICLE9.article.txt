# Red Cross Operations Abroad Cause Increase in Farm Quota
## 
### 
The $3,000 quota set by the student committee for the Red Cross War
Fund Drive beginning at Stanford March 1 is an increase on last year's
total of $2,039, in keeping with the higher-than-ever national quota of
$200,000,000, according to Cheri Martin, campus chairman. The increase
in the quotas is obviously due to the additional duties and demands placed

upon the Red Cross in its services to - *
men overseas.
