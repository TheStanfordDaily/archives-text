# Red Cross Drive Begins, Stanford Quota Is $3,000
## 
### MELLON SHELTON 
The Red Cross drive starts today
with $3,000 as the quota for Stanford.
The drive, which is in conjunction
with the national annual campaign,
will last for one week. It is estimated
that every Stanford student should
contribute approximately two dollars
to meet the quota; this money will
be collected by representatives in
the various living groups.
Soldiers Benefit
Main recipient of Red Cross money
this year is the American soldier
who will receive 87 cents out of even
dollar in the form of free social serv
ice, recreation, and entertainment for
our men, the sick, and the wounded
at home and abroad. Red Cross
clubs have been established wher
evei American troops are operating.
tl is through the Red Cross that
blood plasma is obtained for use
overseas and at home; that food
packages are sent and distributed
among our men who are prisoners
ol war—the Red Cross has special
neutral envoys to inspect prison
camp conditions in Germany and to
see that the camps are clean and that
the men are adequately fed and
clothed.
Red Cross clubmobile units are
now operating behind the lines of
almost every front in the world, and
Red Cross members operate emer
gency hospital ships and are ordi
narily assigned to ships operated by
the military.
Aids Civilians
The remaining 13 cents is divided
among civilian needs at home, and
relief for conquered peoples abroad.
Caring for the destitute families of
servicemen, training Nurses' Aides
for work in our hospitals, and pro
viding relief in times of disaster are
but a few of the many ways Red
Cross helps at home.
It is mainly by Red Cross effort
that some food is being sent to
starving Greece.
Cheri Martin, committee chairman
for the drive, has appointed the fol
lowing chairmen of campus collec
tions: Barbara White, treasurer; Pat
Whittemore, publicity; Jean Hazlett,
campus collections; B. J. Miller,
women's halls; Dick Battle, men's
halls; and Barbara Chapman, sorori
ties.


PLASMA UNDERGROUND —Blood plasma, processed from blood
collected by the American Red Cross, is administered in strange
places. Here in an underground dug-out built by the Marines in a
South Pacific island hot spot, plasma is being given to a wounded
marine in the too bunk. Note the container on a hook at lite head
of his bunk.
