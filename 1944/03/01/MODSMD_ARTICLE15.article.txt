# It Wouldn't Be Hard

IT WOULDN'T be at all hard to say "No" to someone who asked
one of us for a dollar or two to donate toward the Red Cross
nationwide drive that starts today. There are only a few more
weeks left to the quarter, and only few bank accounts still run
into three figures. And so it wouldn't be hard to say, "Sorry, but
I'm flat, and besides, I've already shelled out a lot of money."
But suppose one of the gang wanted to know if we'd like to
go to a movie? Or go to the "Hole"? Or diop into Paly for a
snack? Or do one of the hundred other things that are fun but
cost money?
If a person says "yes" to at least one of these, he probably isn't
getting the most out of college or he's got cne of the stronger
minds on the campus. Somehow money is always available for
things like these, because they are things that persons enjoy
doing.
It's certain that few persons would not enjoy giving to the Red
Cross if they were aware of the world-wide all-inclusive service
performed by that organization. What the Red Cross does for
servicemen in the country is well known, but its hardest job, the
ends to which its workers go to help American fighters overseas,
is a story that never will be realized until the men come home to
tell it.
Stanford is supposed to contribute 53,000 to the Red Cross.
If that goal is not reached, those who have applied to us the term
"Ivory Tower," may continue and know they are right.
