So the Li'l Injun can't go cycling on the Quad? Well, that's
life, or should we say c'est la guerre? What is it, anyway, that
has brought this childish restriction upon cycling Stanfordites?
It seems that many students are guite unhappy over the situa
tion. And when an issue meets with general disapproval, it is
quite apt to be wrong.
There are some who may have to do a bit of dashing around to
make the trek from gym to the other end of the Quad without
pedaling over the forbidden territory. However, this problem will
tax their resourcefulness, and they will undoubtedly emerge bet
ter prepared to cope with such problems in future life.
And it is a wonderful blow to some of these "vain brains" who
are proud of going plus twenty every guarter; for it will impress
upon them the fact that they are not intelligent enough to watch
where they're going, and we may thus be able to keep Stanford
free from conceit and snobbery, and maintain a beautiful democ
racy.
The whole idea of banning vehicles from congested traffic
areas is tremendously pragmatic. So silly of San Francisco to
allow motoring on Market Street! With everyone in such a rush,
there might be an accident. And with all due respect for New
York administrators, they really ought to have enough sense to
prohibit automobiles on Fifth Avenue.
If only the nation could recognize the value of such a plan!
And to think that it originated right here at our own school! But
the theory is so profound that we cannot expect it to become
clear to the average layman for many centuries. So let us, who
lealize its significance, accept it with the knowledge that it may
some day revolutionize the traffic regulations of this country —of
the world, maybe. Who knows? And we can tell our grand
children "we knew it when ..."
In deep appreciation from a grateful cyclist,
Doris Butler.

To The Editor:
How can you permit such puerile mouthings as lean Levinson
to go on? Certainly you can't think they are clever!
I've heard at least a couple of dozen fellows and some girls
express the thought that she ought to confine her talents to private
writings and not spoil a fair paper.
Disgustedly yours,
