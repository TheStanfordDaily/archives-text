ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES, Feb. 29,
(UP) â€”Behind the heaviest artillery
barrage of the Anzio campaign, the
German 14th Army launched new
tank and infantry attacks against our
beachhead lines today but was
brought to an abrupt halt by a wall
of return fire from Allied guns.
Despite their spectacular opening,
$he German attacks appeared to be
a series of local thrusts rather than
one massive push. The enemy thrust
came after the British had again im
proved their position in the gully
cut flats below Carroceto, and Amer
ican dive - bombers had blasted
Rome's airfields for the second
straight day.
