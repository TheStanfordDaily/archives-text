## Buchanan Nips Arthur, 31-28 
### ED LUCE 
Monroe's battling Boozers, playing
under the name of Arthur because
of a promised keg of beer to be do
nated them by Arthur Hall at the
end of the season, lost out in their
bid for a fourth straight win last
night as Buchanan mustered enough
speed in the closing minutes to win
'out, 31-28.
The game Was of the usual mur
derous variety, with numerous fouls
called, and even more overlooked by
the overworked referee. Adding to
the confusion was the disappearance
of the scorekeeper at the end of the
first half. The squads started play
following the rest period oblivious of
the fact, and played for six minutes
before another scorexeeper was
found. Which team lost most by the
temporary suspension of tabulating
is still debatable.
Forbes, who shot nearly every time
he got the ball, drove home six nice
field goals for 12 points. Norm Schie
ber of the Boozers followed with 10,
while Magnin got nine for Buchanan.
Adams Hall broke their record of
never missing a game by defaulting
to the Roble Hashers. Perhaps the
fame of the Hashers was a little too
much for the freshmen.
The expected playoff between Ge
rona and Monroe (no relation to the
Boozers except that htey live in the
same hall) failed to materialize, and
probably will be held Friday. The
two teams were scheduled to play
last week but agreed to call it off.
