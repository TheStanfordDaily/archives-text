Departing from his original plan,
Johnny Fulton, star Stanford speed
ster, has announced that he will run
in the Casey 600-yard event in the
Knights of Columbus Indoor Track
Meet at Madison Square Garden

statement dropped him from the list
of entrants in the longer distance.

record of three wins and a second
place in four starts this year. His
only defeat came at the hands of oJe
