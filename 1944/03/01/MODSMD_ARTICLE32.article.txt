# Library Displays Memorial Books
## 
### 
A selection of books acquired
through the Memorial Fund of the
University is now on display in the
cases of the main Library. These
books memorialize Stanford alumni
who have lost their lives in the war.
Among the books now on exhibi
tion are: "Annals of the Opera," by
Alfred Loewenberg; "Musical Instru
ments," by Karl Geiringer; "The
Carolinian Florist of Governor John
Drayton of South Carolina"; "Mini
atures of the Manuscripts of Ter
ence," which is in two volumes, one
giving the text and the other the
plates.
"Under the plan of memorializing
Stanford alumni through books," ex
plained Nathan Van Patten, director
of University Libraries, "the donor
sends a check to the University giv
ing the name of the individual to be
memorialized. The University then
buys a book for the Library, and in
the book affixes a memorial book
plate."
When a gift is not accompanied by
any suggestion as to what book is to
become a memorial, he continued, an
efforts made to acquire a book with
in the known field of interest of the
individual in whose memory the gift
is made.
