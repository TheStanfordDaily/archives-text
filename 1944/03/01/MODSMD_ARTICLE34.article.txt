## 
### 
In the pre-classic music and dance concert on Thursday, the members of
Orchesis will do modern and authentic versions of court dances in the
Memorial Auditorium at 8:15 under the direction of Mrs. Miriam Lidster.
An authentic Sarabande will be danced—the Sarabande is a court dance
of inquisitional Spain. At one time, so the legend goes, Cardinal Richelieu

danced a Sarabande with castanets
when wooing Ann of Austria.
Olgadale Phillips, in her version of
the Sarabande, "Toda la Vida Es
Sueno" (Life Is a Dream), uses cas
tanets. The form of the dance suite is
of the 16th century, while the dance
itself is of 1944, according to Mrs.
Lidster.
The Allemande which is going to
be danced Thursday night is a senti
mental German dance called ' Beibt
mit mir," or "Stay With Me," in
which the hands have some form of
constant contact, and it is from this
dance that we get the well-known
square dance call, "Allemande left
with your left hand."
"Gay Blade"
A Galliard called "Frollick," a gay
dance which comes from the Gallach
term "a gay blade," will be the sec
ond number on the program in the
Memorial Auditorium.
Margaret Morgan will dance a
Sarabande in which she gives two
versions fo the same dance, the sec

i ond Version being changed by use of
j a mysterious piece of stage property.
"Giddy Gigge"
The Orchesis members have gone
back to the good old days of the
"gay nineties" as their inspiration for
a Gavotte called "Belles of the Ball."
In a Gigue titled "Giddy Gigge,"
one hand plays a game of trying to
catch up with the other and feet on
| the wall do a gig.
