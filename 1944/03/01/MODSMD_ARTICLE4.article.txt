# CAMPUS DANCES
## Monroe 
### 
Just to find out how appropriate
would be a "Kiss the Boys Goodbye"
theme for Saturday's dance, Monroe
Social Chairman Dick Clark last
night polled house members on the
question, and with remarkable re
sults.
It seems that a good number of the
boys, hoping to get in on the eve
ning's fun, announced that they had
received or were expecting "Greet
ings, ' and probably would be gone
come Spring Quarter.
Most of those leaving are headed
for the Army, a few for the Merchant
Marine, and one for the Mexican
border, the poll revealed.
All the campus is invited to at
tend the dance, which will be in
formal, following the usual Monroe
tradition. Music will be of the re
corded variety, with a special ampli
fying system added to transport the
jive to all parts of the hall.
Decorations will consist of amus
ing cartoons, drawn by Monroe Artist
Bob Rubenstein, featuring the de
parting members of the house.
