ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) —
Equipped with a "secret weapon"—
a radio directed tank which in its
first test proved a dud—the Germans
have launched a powerful attack be
tween Carroceto and Cisterna on the
Anzio beachhead, it was announced
today.
But 24 hours after the German
14th Army troops opened their at
tack they were reported still pinned
to their starting positions by the
effectiveness of Allied artillery and
by a new and violent rainstorm that
brought fighting almost to a stand
still this afternoon. Heavy enemy
pressure was continuing, however,
and there was ever indication the
Germans woud resume their push
when the weather improved.
