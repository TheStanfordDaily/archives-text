### JEAN LEVINSON 
Little Mabeline had a problem. She loved to watch out for
everybody's affairs. She adored to see that Joy got up in time to
make her 8 o'clock; she delighted in seeing that Bessie got
enough sleep; and she fairly drooled at the chance of tutoring
Effie in chemistry.
Little Mabeline had a mother complex that she couldn't wear
out. There just wasn't enough responsibility and not enough
sorry citizens to take care of, and mother. So little Mabeline was
unhappy .... in fact, she was a very sad apple, as the old
proverb has want to go.
In her time, Little M. had saved souls from drowning, she
had rescued her partner in a three-no-trump bid, and she had
even explained the jokes in the Chappie to her bewildered
friends.
Now at Stanford, Little Mabeline was frustrated—for many
reasons, yes .... but mainly because she could not do enough
for her fellow man. Her comrades were all becoming quite
mature, and could tie their own shoe-laces and comb their own
hair. As the psychologist has want to put.it, she was a mess
of frustration.
Then came the inevitable dawn, and Mabeline's problem was
almost solved. She read in Stanford's celebrated paper that
sponsors were needed for the happy girls in Roble Hall. This
was the solution. My, couldn't she have a glorious time caring
for these bright, young things! She could advise, teach, help, and
mother the feminine frosh, and guide them on the right road to
success.
So, Little Mabeline, with light, expectant tread, skipped mer
rily down to the Excom room at 10 o'clock this morning, and
was interviewed for the position of sponsor. She is hoping for
a bright future.
The moral of this tale is as obvious as a bicycle on Quad.
If you desire to become a Roble sponsor, go to the Interviewing
Committee in the Excom room this morning, between 10 and 12.
Perhaps you will be able to mother a congenial brood.
