The Daily apologizes to Pfc. Sidney Flaxman tor publishing
a letter in this column yesterday which he did not write. The
letter that was sent in supposedly bore his signature.
To the Editor:
I finally made the Daily but I wish to clear up the situation.
1. If the statement I was supposed to write was intended
as a joke or as a publicity stunt, okay or all right. BUT
2. If it was not intended as a joke, I wish to state that the
article was not written by me.
3. I do not want to become the central figure in another
possible "Hooker" incident.
Pfc. Sidney Flaxman,
Co. F, A.S.T.U. 3905.
P.S.â€”I think Miss Levinson is wonderful, the school is wonderful,
the students are wonderful, and the world is wonderful.
