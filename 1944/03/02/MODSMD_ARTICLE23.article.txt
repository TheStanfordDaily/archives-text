# Army Dance Class Tonight
## 
### 
The new series of elementary army
dancing lessons will begin this eve
ning at 9:30 p.m. in the Music room
behind the Art Gallery.
Cathy Hauser and Dick Leon will
teach the basic dance steps, and
Peggy Deering will be the accom
panist.
These lessons will be a repetition
rather than a continuation of the
earlier series which ended last week,
but the old members of the class are
just as welcome as the new ones.
Those who already know how to
dance will find it excellent practice,

[ and those who don't will soon learn.
There is only one request; it will
be greatly appreciated if the army
students would wear their own shoes.
Girls interested in assisting as in
dividual partners should sign up at
at the War Board, or those in Roble
can. sign the lists posted on their
bulletin board.
The Art Gallery is across from
English corner next to the Library.
I The Music room doors face the Me
j morial Theater.
