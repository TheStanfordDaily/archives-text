## Seals Sign Three Rookie Pitchers 
### 
Three new pitching prospects have
reported to the San Francisco Seals.
The three rookie hurlers are Curtis
Schmidt of Sacramento, who tried
out with Tucson in 1939-40; Bill Carr
of Spokane, who twirled for a' Val
lejo semi-pro club last year; and
Ival Liggett of Council Bluffs, lowa,
who holds a naval discharge after
battle action.
The 1944 spring training season is
three days old, having started Mon
day. Though several players have
reported, the Seals have been kept
from batting practice by wet grounds
after the recent rains.
