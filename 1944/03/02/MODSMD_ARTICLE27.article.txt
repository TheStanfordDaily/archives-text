### JOE ZUKIN 
The fast-improving Monroe Booz
ers squad came in true style
last night to down a game Washing
ton Hall team by a comparatively
close score of 40 to 30.
Full of Action
The whole tussle was packed with
action from start to finish and was
anybody's ball game until the closing
few minutes. Plenty of good ball
handling was displayed by both
teams, and lots of smart under the
basket technique was exhibited.
Luce High for Winners.
Ed Luce came through to take
scoring honors for Monroe and the
entire agme as well, when he racked
up a total of 14 points. Luce con
tributed most of the spark the game

I possessed and was always in there
| fighting for the ball. Luce was close
ly followed by his teammate. Ric
Supple, who came up for .10 points.
Supple was also in there pitching
| all the way as he hung on opponents'
necks and contributed generally to
the Monroe defense. Bob Fess, usual
high-point man in any game he en
i ters, was held scoreless throughout
{ the long game by a Washington sub
stitute whose name does not appear
here for obvious embarrassing rea
sons.
McKinley A Beats McKinley B
While the Monroe vs. Washington
tussle was going on in the Encina
Gym, across the way at the Pavilion
a real slaughter was carried out
when the two teams from McKinley

] Hall fought it out, with the A team
j coming out the winner by a com
- fortable margin of 82 to 14. As is
| obvious by the score, the "A" team
dominated the entire game and at
no time were in danger of relin
quishing their lead to their brother
opponents.
Horner Leads "A" Team
"Doosh" Horner came through for
i the winning squad by p'iling up an
amazing total of 32 digits and playing
an all-around hot game. Following

Lincoln Over Cleveland
The best bet for tonight's round of
games is the Lincoln vs. Cleveland
tussle in which the boys from Lin

coin should emerge victorious.
Cleveland has shown a lot of spark
j in its last few games, but Lincoln's
power and experience should win
j out. In another good game tonight
I the Med School takes on Buchanan
I Hall, and the Medics should come
i through the winners of this one.

last night to down a game Washing
ton Hall team by a comparatively
close score of 40 to 30.
Full of Action
The whole tussle was packed with
action from start to finish and was
anybody's ball game until the closing
few minutes. Plenty of good ball
handling was displayed by both
teams, and lots of smart under the
basket technique was exhibited.
Luce High for Winners.
Ed Luce came through to take
scoring honors for Monroe and the
entire agme as well, when he racked
up a total of 14 points. Luce con
tributed most of the spark the game

I possessed and was always in there
| fighting for the ball. Luce was close
ly followed by his teammate. Ric
Supple, who came up for .10 points.
Supple was also in there pitching
| all the way as he hung on opponents'
necks and contributed generally to
the Monroe defense. Bob Fess, usual
high-point man in any game he en
i ters, was held scoreless throughout
{ the long game by a Washington sub
stitute whose name does not appear
here for obvious embarrassing rea
sons.
McKinley A Beats McKinley B
While the Monroe vs. Washington
tussle was going on in the Encina
Gym, across the way at the Pavilion
a real slaughter was carried out
when the two teams from McKinley

] Hall fought it out, with the A team
j coming out the winner by a com
- fortable margin of 82 to 14. As is
| obvious by the score, the "A" team
dominated the entire game and at
no time were in danger of relin
quishing their lead to their brother
opponents.
Horner Leads "A" Team
"Doosh" Horner came through for
i the winning squad by p'iling up an
amazing total of 32 digits and playing
an all-around hot game. Following
Horner in the scoring parade was
Bob Donahoe who compiled 15 points
in the score book.
Lincoln Over Cleveland
The best bet for tonight's round of
games is the Lincoln vs. Cleveland
tussle in which the boys from Lin

coin should emerge victorious.
Cleveland has shown a lot of spark
j in its last few games, but Lincoln's
power and experience should win
j out. In another good game tonight
I the Med School takes on Buchanan
I Hall, and the Medics should come
i through the winners of this one.
