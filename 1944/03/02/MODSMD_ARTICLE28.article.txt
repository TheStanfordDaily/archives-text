### 
"The great advantage of newspaper
work is that you do so much for the
community," Miss Mary Ellen Leary
of the San Francisco News told wom
en students at the last Vocom meet
ing in the Woman's Clubhouse last
night.
Women reporters must remember,
however, that there are only a few
positions open to them. They should
try to get into specialized fields, fea
ture writing, or politics.
Postwar Jobs
Miss Leary said that newspaper
jobs will last after the war if the
girl takes an interest in her work and
is competent. "A newspaper job is
a business and the same qualities,
such as dependability and common
sense, which put you ahead in any
business will get you ahead in jour
nalism."
Mrs. Frances Ayers Moffett, of the
Palo Alto Times, explained that work
on a women's page isn't as bad as
it seems. There are many positions
open on the women's page, society
editor, club editor, fashion editor,
home economics, advice to lovelorn,
and sometimes the drama critic is in
this section.
The women's page offers valuable
training for feature, column or mag
azine writing.
Advertising
Miss Rose Douglas spoke on ad
vertising. "Advertising writing has
the same idea behind it as news
writing. Your object is to get a per
son to read it."
"Advertising jobs are open in
agencies, companies that have gods
or services to sell, advertising de
partments of newspapers and maga
zines, retail stores, and radio. The
woman in this job may write copy,
do promotion work, research work,
or hold some executive position.
Dr. Chilton R. Bush, professor of
journalism, was faculty chairman.
