# Phantom Lady
## 
### 
PERHAPS YOU HAVE HEAPiD the recent ra- I
dio appeal to an unknown, mysterious woman
to get in touch with the radio station so that
she may aid a man in a desperate situation.
The appeal to the radio audience is sincere and
urgent. There is every reason to believe that
it is an attempt to reach a real person who might
save a man's life.
But the radio appeal as such is a hoax. The i
plea is heard during a program called "The j
Movies in Music," presented by Universal.
Actually, the radio plea is part of the publicity
on a forthcoming Universal film, "Phantom
Lady."
The film is based on the story of an architect
who has a drink in a bar with a beautiful woman
wearing a fantastic hat. He finishes his drink
and, going home to kiss and make up with his
wife, is arrested by police for the murder of his j
wife. The murder was committed at the time the !
architect was drinking; he is sentenced to death.
He remembers nothing of the woman except '
her hat and the police consider the alibi fishy.
The architect's secretary sets out to find the
mysterious woman and eventually proves that
her employer is innocent.
The film is probably good, clean fun, but such
radio advertising is dangerous. Institutions such
as the radio and the newspapers should make
available to the public only the truth, giving
the source in every possible instance.
Occasionally, a real emergency has neces
sitated a radio appeal for information as to the

whereabouts of a certain individual. The public j
has responded because of the need. But a few
more press agent howls of a "wolf, wolf" na
ture and the radio audience will chalk up the
pleas as publicity pure and simple.
This publicity is, of course, long-range. That
is, the plea for the mysterious woman will soon
be explained. Nevertheless it is a dangerous
precedent, and it is surprising that radio would
risk its well-established reputation for veracity, j
