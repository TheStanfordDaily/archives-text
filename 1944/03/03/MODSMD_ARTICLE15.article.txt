## "AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES" 
### JEAN LEVINSON Faith Birdwin 
(As Pamela is baking a batch of Toll House
Cookies for Christopher, the telephone rings,
and answering it, Pam says:)
"Hello . . . yes . . . yes ... oh I couldn't. Oh
I wouldn't dare! Really? Well maybe . . . but
it's so late ... oh all right, I'll be glad to sing ;
for your USO entertainment. I'll whip right
over."
Christopher, unaware of the impact of the
message that was to take Pamela way from
him, sat greedily muncing on a hot cookie.
Pamela bit her red, sensuous lip and took a
deep breath. "I must leave you, Chris. I'm to 1
warble for the USO."
For the second time, large salt tears rolled
down Christopher's cheek.
"Don't leave me, Pam . . . ever!"
"Sorry, Chris, but I must make thousands of J
service men happy by singing gloriously for
them. Don't get indigestion. Bye."
And as Pam closed the door after her, she
caught a last glimpse of Chris, with his head
buried in his apron.
In no time, Pam found herself at the USO,
and already eight thousand men were stamp
ing and calling for her to sing. They knew
she was coming.
With all the assurance of her seventeen
years, Pamela got up —gave the cue to her ac
companist—and let loose with the vocal cords. J
A breathless hush fell over the men. They'
were hypnotized by this rival of Dinah Shore.
Pam looked like a veritable Sun-Goddess in
her tight-fitting, gold lace gown ,her honey-col
ored hair, and her half-closed El Greco blue
eyes.
The husky, deep-throated notes spilled out
as she sang, "Some Day He'll Come Along—j
the Man I Love."
The spell was cruelly shattered by a deep ,
voice that yelled from the audience: "I'm that
man! Come and get me."
Pamela discontinued her madrigal, and
stepped down to see who her admirer was. Yes,
there he was, panting in the middle of a large
group. Here indeed, was a Man! Six-foot-five
of brawny sinew . . . gleaming eyes.
"Hello, song-bird. I've come at last — the
man you can really love, eh."
|
"Hello," said Pam with restrained excitement.
"What do you want?"
The giant twinkled and whispered, "Are you
kiddin'? I am Sam the Sailor, and I adore you." 1
Pamela felt that old feeling again, and an
swered, "You're sweet, Sam."
"I know it, but that's not the point. The fact
is, I need you . . . can't you understand that
. . . need you, need you, need you!"
"Little old me, Sam the Sailor?"
Yes, adorable little you. Let's leave this
USO and have some real fun, eh?
Pamela was faced with one of those darn!
old decisions again. This time she would go!
"Okay," was her well-considered reply.
"Rapture," shrieked Sam the Sailor, "do you
know what we re going to do? We're going

(As Pamela is baking a batch of Toll House
Cookies for Christopher, the telephone rings,
and answering it, Pam says:)
"Hello . . . yes . . . yes ... oh I couldn't. Oh
I wouldn't dare! Really? Well maybe . . . but
it's so late ... oh all right, I'll be glad to sing ;
for your USO entertainment. I'll whip right
over."
Christopher, unaware of the impact of the
message that was to take Pamela way from
him, sat greedily muncing on a hot cookie.
Pamela bit her red, sensuous lip and took a
deep breath. "I must leave you, Chris. I'm to 1
warble for the USO."
For the second time, large salt tears rolled
down Christopher's cheek.
"Don't leave me, Pam . . . ever!"
"Sorry, Chris, but I must make thousands of J
service men happy by singing gloriously for
them. Don't get indigestion. Bye."
And as Pam closed the door after her, she
caught a last glimpse of Chris, with his head
buried in his apron.
In no time, Pam found herself at the USO,
and already eight thousand men were stamp
ing and calling for her to sing. They knew
she was coming.
With all the assurance of her seventeen
years, Pamela got up —gave the cue to her ac
companist—and let loose with the vocal cords. J
A breathless hush fell over the men. They'
were hypnotized by this rival of Dinah Shore.
Pam looked like a veritable Sun-Goddess in
her tight-fitting, gold lace gown ,her honey-col
ored hair, and her half-closed El Greco blue
eyes.
The husky, deep-throated notes spilled out
as she sang, "Some Day He'll Come Along—j
the Man I Love."
The spell was cruelly shattered by a deep ,
voice that yelled from the audience: "I'm that
man! Come and get me."
Pamela discontinued her madrigal, and
stepped down to see who her admirer was. Yes,
there he was, panting in the middle of a large
group. Here indeed, was a Man! Six-foot-five
of brawny sinew . . . gleaming eyes.
"Hello, song-bird. I've come at last — the
man you can really love, eh."
|
"Hello," said Pam with restrained excitement.
"What do you want?"
The giant twinkled and whispered, "Are you
kiddin'? I am Sam the Sailor, and I adore you." 1
Pamela felt that old feeling again, and an
swered, "You're sweet, Sam."
"I know it, but that's not the point. The fact
is, I need you . . . can't you understand that
. . . need you, need you, need you!"
"Little old me, Sam the Sailor?"
Yes, adorable little you. Let's leave this
USO and have some real fun, eh?
Pamela was faced with one of those darn!
old decisions again. This time she would go!
"Okay," was her well-considered reply.
"Rapture," shrieked Sam the Sailor, "do you
know what we re going to do? We're going
