Tliis is the first of a series of four |
articles concerning the early days i
of Stanford which are being run !
in connection with the celebration j
of Founders' Day, March 9.
The boy loved the Palo Alto
Ranch .... the low, summer-burnt
hills, the clear California skies, and
the western way of life with his
horses and dogs. Fifty years later a
great university built and named for
that boy's memory has become a part
of those low hills and an integral
part of California.
His Memorial Ambitious
Leland Stanford Jr., a keen, alert
IG-year-old, was the only son of
Governor and Mrs. Stanford of Cali
fornia. After his sudden death on
March 13, 1884, his parents decided
to build some memorial to their son
that would benefit other young peo
ple. Governor Stanford said the day
following his son's death, "The chil- |
dren of California shall be my chil- I
dren." Mrs. Stanford and he con- j
sidered building a museum in San
Francisco, starting a technical school,
or contributing to the University of
California, but they discarded these
plans in favor of establishing a uni
versity for men and women on the
West Coast.
No Time Lost
The founding grant was executed
on Nov. 11, 1886, more than two |
years after Leland Jr.'s death. Plans
were drafted for the University's
buildings and on the anniversary of
their son's birth, May 14, 1887, Gov.
and Mrs. Stanford saw the corner
stone laid for the Inner Quad ....
the beginning of realization of their
dream.
Work started immediately on the
Inner Quad, engineering shops, En
cina and the Museum; Roble con
struction was delayed until the sum
mer of IS9I. The sandstone arches
and the red-tiled roofs, were part of
an unusual architectural style de
rived from the old Franciscan mis
sions. Charles Allerton Coolidge, a
young California architect, designed
he pattern for the Inner Quad as the i
center of University life.
After an interview In his Bloom
ington home, David Starr Jordan,
the vigorous and youthful president
of the University of Indiana, accept
ed the Stanfords' challenging offer to
become the first president of the
West's newest university.
The Nation Doubted
Leland Stanford's project was
greeted dubiously on the Pacific
Coast. Even the New York Mail and
Express voiced the general opinion
that Stanford professors would "lec
ture in marble halls to empty
benches." But on a bright day in
early October of 1891, the opening
ceremonies of Leland Stanford Jr.
University were held by the arch at
the northern end of the Inner Quad
while 465 students, 15 professors,
and 1,500 spectators watched the be
ginning of the new institution.
Down on the banks of the San
Francisquito creek, the rugged old
redwood .... the "Tall Tree for
which Palo Alto was named ....
remembered the days when a young
ster played on the Palo Alto Ranch.
Weather-beaten and strong from its
950 years, at the turn of the century
it became the symbol and the official
seal of Stanford University.

The boy loved the Palo Alto
Ranch .... the low, summer-burnt
hills, the clear California skies, and
the western way of life with his
horses and dogs. Fifty years later a
great university built and named for
that boy's memory has become a part
of those low hills and an integral
part of California.
His Memorial Ambitious
Leland Stanford Jr., a keen, alert
IG-year-old, was the only son of
Governor and Mrs. Stanford of Cali
fornia. After his sudden death on
March 13, 1884, his parents decided
to build some memorial to their son
that would benefit other young peo
ple. Governor Stanford said the day
following his son's death, "The chil- |
dren of California shall be my chil- I
dren." Mrs. Stanford and he con- j
sidered building a museum in San
Francisco, starting a technical school,
or contributing to the University of
California, but they discarded these
plans in favor of establishing a uni
versity for men and women on the
West Coast.
No Time Lost
The founding grant was executed
on Nov. 11, 1886, more than two |
years after Leland Jr.'s death. Plans
were drafted for the University's
buildings and on the anniversary of
their son's birth, May 14, 1887, Gov.
and Mrs. Stanford saw the corner
stone laid for the Inner Quad ....
the beginning of realization of their
dream.
Work started immediately on the
Inner Quad, engineering shops, En
cina and the Museum; Roble con
struction was delayed until the sum
mer of IS9I. The sandstone arches
and the red-tiled roofs, were part of
an unusual architectural style de
rived from the old Franciscan mis
sions. Charles Allerton Coolidge, a
young California architect, designed
he pattern for the Inner Quad as the i
center of University life.
After an interview In his Bloom
ington home, David Starr Jordan,
the vigorous and youthful president
of the University of Indiana, accept
ed the Stanfords' challenging offer to
become the first president of the
West's newest university.
The Nation Doubted
Leland Stanford's project was
greeted dubiously on the Pacific
Coast. Even the New York Mail and
Express voiced the general opinion
that Stanford professors would "lec
ture in marble halls to empty
benches." But on a bright day in
early October of 1891, the opening
ceremonies of Leland Stanford Jr.
University were held by the arch at
the northern end of the Inner Quad
while 465 students, 15 professors,
