A full schedule of activities during
Spring Quarter was announced by
Cardinals at their last meeting, al
though dates have not been set for
all the coming festivities.
The quarterly Reg Dance headed
by Charlie Clark will be held to
welcome new students as well as to
provide a "get-together" for return
ing Farm members.
Blossom Parke, who will be in
charge of the Spring Sing on May 1,
said that plans for the program are
sure to draw groups from every liv
ing quarter.
A "Sadie Hawkins Day," with Dick
Bartle as chairman, also will be on
the schedule this coming spring and
promises to be the height of orig

Scheiber has been appointed to head
the Con Home Drive.
Cardinals ask any students who
have other ideas for entertainment to
notify their president, Barbara
White, for new plans will always be
welcomed.
