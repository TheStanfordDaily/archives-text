••Ooh," said a lovely young thing,
as she rushed up to an ASTUte
young man on Quad, "the soldiers
are leaving the fraternity houses ....
all the fraternity houses .... all
:he soldiers .... does that mean
?"
"Yeah," she was politely told, "all
the G.l.'s are moving, and a long way
100, cleai down to Ent-ina and Plan
ner!"
And therein lies the tale. The long
trek started Tuesday, lasted through
Wednesday, finished Thursday. By
now the Row is devoid of soldiers,
i Well the fraternity houses are
empty, anyway.)
We're wondering what the D.G.'s
are going to do for a volleyball
game now. Or who's going to wake
all the nice people on the Row at
l»:IJO in the morning? Or throw
footballs at them at in the
evening? Or tell them how lovely
they are in Chinese, Japanese, Ma
layan, Dutch, and what have you?
.... Things are tough, that's all.

■Music in the Air
Our recent mention of G.I. swing
sters must have been contagious, for
now we find that the Italian 5L s
have formed a quartet, and they're
making with the modern music
of course). The four are
John Davide, Joseph Cammarosano,
Gaynor Gibson, and Henry Miranda.
To provide music, they've got a
piano, accordion, clarinet, and trum
pet. What does Italian boogie-woo
gie sound like, boys?
A.P.B.P.
We're going to see "The Army
Play by Play" at last. The one-acts
nave been in rehearsal a long time.
Little Bud Irving of Co. G, who's
in the plays as well as being produc
tion manager, brings with him some
big time experience. He was in
"Something for the Boys" on Broad-
Way before entering the Army, and
played in several other New York
shows, including "The American
Way" and "Brooklyn, U.S.A." . . .
The only property trouble for the
plays came in getting a civilian suit
for Tom Tull in "Button Your Lip."
He didn't have one in his barracks
bag. . . .The boys have been rehears
ing in all kinds of shifts to fit every
class program, and Mr. Sievers of
the Speech and Drama Department,
who's directing the plays, has
learned that an Army formation is
an Army formation, even at Stan
ford, even if "Army Play by Play"
rehearsals must be forsaken.

A.P.B.P.
We're going to see "The Army
Play by Play" at last. The one-acts
nave been in rehearsal a long time.
Little Bud Irving of Co. G, who's
in the plays as well as being produc
tion manager, brings with him some
big time experience. He was in
"Something for the Boys" on Broad-
Way before entering the Army, and
played in several other New York
shows, including "The American
Way" and "Brooklyn, U.S.A." . . .
The only property trouble for the
plays came in getting a civilian suit
for Tom Tull in "Button Your Lip."
He didn't have one in his barracks
bag. . . .The boys have been rehears
ing in all kinds of shifts to fit every
class program, and Mr. Sievers of
the Speech and Drama Department,
who's directing the plays, has
learned that an Army formation is
an Army formation, even at Stan
ford, even if "Army Play by Play"
rehearsals must be forsaken.
••Ooh," said a lovely young thing,
as she rushed up to an ASTUte
young man on Quad, "the soldiers
are leaving the fraternity houses ....
all the fraternity houses .... all
:he soldiers .... does that mean
?"
"Yeah," she was politely told, "all
the G.l.'s are moving, and a long way
100, cleai down to Ent-ina and Plan
ner!"
And therein lies the tale. The long
trek started Tuesday, lasted through
Wednesday, finished Thursday. By
now the Row is devoid of soldiers,
i Well the fraternity houses are
empty, anyway.)
We're wondering what the D.G.'s
are going to do for a volleyball
game now. Or who's going to wake
all the nice people on the Row at
l»:IJO in the morning? Or throw
footballs at them at in the
evening? Or tell them how lovely
they are in Chinese, Japanese, Ma
layan, Dutch, and what have you?
.... Things are tough, that's all.

■Music in the Air
Our recent mention of G.I. swing
sters must have been contagious, for
now we find that the Italian 5L s
have formed a quartet, and they're
making with the modern music
of course). The four are
John Davide, Joseph Cammarosano,
Gaynor Gibson, and Henry Miranda.
To provide music, they've got a
piano, accordion, clarinet, and trum
pet. What does Italian boogie-woo
gie sound like, boys?
