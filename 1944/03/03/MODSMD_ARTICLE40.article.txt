### ARTHUR SHAPIRO 
Monday night was really a revcla- !
tion to yours truly, the coaches, and
those old die-hards who can he seen
at one and every league basketball
game week in and week out.
Usually the Pavilion is bare of j
people, except the players and the
groups mentioned above. Yet Mon- I
day night saw some 350 people view- j
ing the Co. E-Co. I clash and surprise
of surprisesâ€”enjoying it! The un
initiated were really shocked as the j
contest unfolded below them.
Came to Cheer
Some came to cheer on their re
spective companies, others to look
the game over and spend some time, |
and still others to laugh at the spec- I
tacle which they expected to be a j
travesty.
All the groups forgot their original
purposes in coming and concentrated
on the game objectively. They
cheered the magnificent one-handed j
shot made by Kuhn of Co. I from a j
sharp angle, with both feet off the 1
floor. They applauded the yeoman

work of Bales of Co. E, who drove
the Engineers on, and they hubba
hubbad and chuckled at the size,
speed, and aggressiveness of Lim of
Co. I. Everyone found something
interesting in the contest and also
discovered a fine way to rest, relax,
and forget for a few minutes, school
work, tests, rumors, and Saturday's
gig-
Doors Wide Open
Try it yourself! Just drop down to
the Pavilion or gymnasium any Mon
day, Wednesday, Thursday, or Fri
day evening at 21150. The doors are
wide open, come in, sit down, and
let yourself go!
In a few weeks the first and second
battalions are scheduled to meet in
an all-star affair. We'd like to see
all the seats taken and then some
hanging from the rafters, so let's get
in practice by placing at least one
game a week on our date books. And
Monday night is a good time to be
gin when Co. I tangles with Co. E in
a rematch for the benefit of the Red
Cross.
