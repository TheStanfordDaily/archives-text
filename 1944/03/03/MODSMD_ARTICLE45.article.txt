# Co. E – Co. I To Replay For Charity
## 
### 
A return match between the Co. I
and Co. 1£ basketball teams at 2130
next Monday in the Pavilion, with all
proceeds of the game going to the
[led Cross, was announced Thursday
by the Army Student Council.
Co. 1 topped the E company five
in a 32-28 thriller last Monday, in a
regularly scheduled contest of the
Colonel John R. Eden basketball
league. By its win, Co. I virtually
clinched the tourney title.
No Admission
Monday night's game has been
arranged by the members of both
teams. There will be no admission
fee, but a collection will be taken
for the Red Cross. No tournament
standing rests on the contest, but
plenty of interest has been drummed
up for the game by the players and
those lucky enough to have wit
nessed the first meeting of the two
fives.
See-Saw Game
The second half of last Monday's
Co. I-Co. E tilt provided one of the
most hectic twenty-minute periods
seen in current league play. Co. I
stretched its 14-13 half-time lead to
two markers. Then Co. E tied the
contest at 18-18. From then on it
was give and take.
From 18-18 to 28-28, the fray was
a see-saw affair, with Co. I never
relinquishing the lead.
