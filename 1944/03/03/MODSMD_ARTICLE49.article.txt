# MURAL BASKETBALL
## Meds Smear Buchanan 62-23; Fillmore Wins 
### ED LUCE 
Putting together phenomenal
sharpshooting with floor tactics rem
iniscent, of the gridiron, Med School's
monsters last night ran wild to rout
Buchanan. G3-23.
The tall Medics, averaging about
six-foot-one in h eighth, simply
clubbed their smaller opponents to
death under the basket. While this
mass-murder was being perpetrated
upon Buchanan, Wayne Price and
Johnny Mallow were racking up field
goal after field goal for 20 and 19
points respectively. Malloy spent
most of his time standing undei the
Buchanan basket, receiving and pop
ping in long heaves from his team
nates.
I J i ice Pushes
Price used his one-handed push
shot to excellent advantage, swishing
from all uver. Dick Pehl and Jim
Holmes concentrated on forcefully
taking the ball away from the Bu
chanan lads, but managed to shoot
often enough to tank 12 points.
Buchanan's tightly constructed
zone defense was highly ineffectual,

since the Med School took every shot
they missed off the backboard and
tried all over again.
Adams Loses
It) the other 7:15 tilt, hapless
Adams absorbed another one of their
now-famous pastings, as Fillmore
ran up a 70-15 count before the ref
stopped the brawl. Louie Fentnor
plunked in 14 field goals for 28 points,
while Bob Thaxton followed with 2U.
P. Walsh was the whole show for
Adams, getting eight points.
Med School's win sets up next
Wednesday's game between the
Medics and Monroe as the feature at
traction of the next two weeks of
mural play. Providing a ref can be
found who can keep the two squads
from killing each other, the game
might be worth watching.
The Roble Hashers still lead the
league, but a battle for second place
between McKinley, the Firehou.se,
Fillmore. Med School, and Monroe is
rapidly materializing. At this writ
ing, McKinley has the inside track,
with Med School and Monroe rated
next in line.
