The Mennonite costumes which
will be worn in "Papa Is All," the
next Stanford Players' production
which will be presented at the Little
Theater on March 15, 16, 17, 18, and
20. are causing the costume crew,
under the direction of Mrs. Muriel
Lievsay, quite a bit of trouble as it
is against the Mennonite religion to
wear buttons. They are forbidden to
wear anything that is not mentioned
in the Bible, which includes buttons,
cuffs, snaps, and any kind of decora
tion or ornamentation.
The tyrannical Papa, who is a
staunch Mennonite, always wears
plain black broad-brimmed hats and
bright colored blouses. Mennonite
men are not allowed to have their
lips covered, but always wear beards,
as full as possible.
The Mennonite women wear long
dark aprons every day except at fu
nerals when they wear white aprons.
Capes are worn instead of coats, and
plain cotton stockings, kerchiefs, and
the traditional Mennonite caps are
an integral part of their daily cos
tume.

of information for the costume de
