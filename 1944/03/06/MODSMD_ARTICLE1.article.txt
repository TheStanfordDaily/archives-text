# Two Contest Entrants Tell Background
## 
### 
Both Stanford representatives in
the National Discussion Contest on
Inter - American Affairs, Dorothy
Bailey and Enrique Sidwell, have
backgrounds which made their entry
only natural.
Miss Bailey, after she had attended
San Jose State College for two years,
worked a year and a half in the
American Republics Unit of the De
partment of Commerce, in Washing
ton, D.C. She worked directly under
William LaVarre, author of several
books on Latin America and is con
sidered an authority in his field.
Before she entered Stanford this
Fall Quarter she was engaged in
liewspaper work for a few months.
Mr. Sidwell can really look at both
sides of the American continent. His
home is in Buenos Aires, Argentina,
and he attended the University of
Buenos Aires a year before he came
to Stanford as a mechanical engi
neering major. He has been in the
United States almost two years.
Miss Bailey's and Mr. Sidwell's
manuscripts are in Washington, D.C.,
now being judged with those from
college and university students from
11 Western states. If either is among
the winners, he or she will meet with
seven other students for the Pacific
regional finals, to be held on the
Stanford campus March 21—just two
weeks from tomorrow. —Sudekum
