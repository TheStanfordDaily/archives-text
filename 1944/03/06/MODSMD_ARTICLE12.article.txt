It certainly takes time to walk across the
Quad. A person leaves for class at 9, stops at
the post office, and then forces the speedometer
up to 15 miles an hour and slides to a stop by
the Law steps. And then he has 75 yards more
to go—on foot—to get to his class.
It takes a good three minutes to walk that
75 yards. Until a few weeks ago, he could have
gone up to the door on his bike. But then a
law was brought forward which forbade bi
cycles on Quad; several persons had been
knocked over, there had been a few collisions.
No one had been killed, bicycles can do this,
and so everyone complained about this rule,
saying it was silly and illogical.
About two years ago, when Stanford was a
"country club," when there were big-name
bands, and anyone who was anyone at all had
at least a Model "A," this same person left
"the house" in his convertible at 9. He pulled
up to a stop at the post office, came back and
climbed in, getting a flying start in low gear.
He finally got to History corner and after driv
ing around for a few minutes, gave up and
parked by the "Reserved for Faculty" sign.
Then, binder in hand, he dashed across the
street, up the Quad steps, and sprinted the re
maining 25 yards to class.
With all the room on Quad you'd think they
would have let him drive up to the door,
wouldn't you? It's lucky there aren't many cars
left because it would be a horrible thing to have
to walk 100 instead of 25 yards.
