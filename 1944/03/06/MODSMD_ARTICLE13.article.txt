Have you heard that Stanford is closing down
because the AST unit is leaving? And did you
know that we'll be getting two weeks' vacation
instead of one at the end of this quarter? Did
you know that 2,000 WAC's will arrive on cam
pus soon- No fooling, that's what we heard.
We heard it in the Cellar and in the Libe the
other day in the reserve book room.
When the conversation hits a lull or when
you want to impress your friends by telling
them something that'll make their ears flap
these are the kind of questions you'll ask them.
And when they see their friends they'll pass
them on. And by the time their friends see
their friends, the word will be:
"Hey, Stanford's closing down. I don't know
just when, but I guess it won't be till next
quarter because we're getting two weeks, not

one, but two weeks off at the end of this
quarter!"
And when Dr. Tresidder comes along—what
better way to make him know that we're keep
ing up with the world than to tell him that
Stanford is closing?
