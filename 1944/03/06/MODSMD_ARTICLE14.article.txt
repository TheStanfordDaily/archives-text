### JEAN LEVINSON 
POME
Oh Spring is really coming,
The flowers are a'bloom,
The little bees are humming,
The dust is in my room.
Oh Spring is on its way now,
The gals are lookin' sharp,
Each pasture has its Jersey cow,
Each heaven has its harp.
Oh Spring'll be here soon enough,
The Lake is risin' high,
And every rugged Stanford rough,
Will sit around and sigh.
Oh Spring's racin' on wings of song,
The Quad is lookin' purty,
Classes are gettin' dry and long,
The Daily floor's still dirty.
Spring is comin' on the run,
And before it gets here Boss,
Dig deep into your jeans son,
And give to the Red Cross.
Oh Spring'll be here sonny boy.
Wipe the rain from off your head,
Think happy thoughts and spread some joy,
Rid your shoes of all that lead.
Yes you've guessed it Spring's around,
And all's a bed of clover,
So have some fun and leap and bound
Cause things are tough all over!
