j A concrete suggestion to those students of
' Stanford who would like to do something more
! for the war effort than: 1) purchase nylon stock
ings by buying a $5,000 war bond, 2) beam
graciously upon the fortunate dogfaces sta
tioned here, 3) park their bicycles outside the
Quad:
Nan Tillson and her talented associates might
trek a couple of miles up the El Camino to
j Dibble Hospital where many wounded veterans
| of the South Pacific would certainly appreciate
their efforts or even a look at a few Stanford
coeds.
Quite ironical a suggestion, perhaps, coming
from one who does no more toward winning the
war than speak a few Spanish words each day,
but, nveertheless, something that might be
j worth considering.

To the Editor:
Spring has sprung,
Fall has fell,
Summer is here
And it's hot as—last summer.
Only let's wait until June before we have to !
sit out on the benches between 12 and 1:30 on
Friday and Saturday nights. Between these
hours there isn't one nice, warm, cozy place on
campus to go.
The War Board has failed to take into con
sideration several important facts concerned
with keeping the Nitery open during these
hours: 1. There is no after-hours cleaning
problem since the Y and the women's living |
groups clean the Nitery Saturday and Sunday
i mornings respectively.
2. We feel the present moral problem is in- j
significant in comparison to the problem created
i when couples find themselves with nothing to
do and no decent place to go at that time of
night.
We don't like to complain, because the War 1
Board has done a fine job with the Canteen, but 1
we would like to see a solution found soon.
Very sincerely,
Three Perturbed Union Girls.
