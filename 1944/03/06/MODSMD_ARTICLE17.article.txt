# 'Marriage Needs Inner Spirit'

### 
"The status of marriage is a good
barometer of a civilization," said Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood in his sermon on
the Sacrament of Marriage at the
Memorial Church yesterday. Al
though we are not at the low moral
state that the Romans were before
their decay, people are shocked at
the marriage state in this nation as
seen in the '"Hollywood Mentality,"
he said.
The convictions of marriage have
driven men to believe marriage is a
sacrament — a unique and peculiar
way through which God comes to
us—Dr. Trueblood stated.
The dangers of failure in marriage
are great, said Dr. Trueblood; women
give up a chance for public recog
nition, no woman ever made '"who's
Who" for being a mother; and the
men give up all ideas of complete in
dependence.
