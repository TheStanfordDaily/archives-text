## Zurita Preps For Title Bout 
### 
HOLLYWOOD (UP) — Lantern-
Jawed Little Juan Zurita, Mexico
City's lightweight whirlwind, today
tapered off vigorous training at a
main street gym for his bout with
Sammy Angott for the NBA light
weight title Wednesday at Hollywood
ball park and said he was ready to
give Angott all the trouble he could
handle.
'"I've made my plans against An
gott and I'm not trying to keep them
secret. He's a good fist tighter and
I'm going to keep away from him.
I'm a switch hitter and I'm going to
fight him that way—in and out in an
unorthodox style — it's my best
chance," Zurita said.
Rail birds in the gym agreed heart
ily that Zurita is an unorthodox
boxer. He's been pounding his spar
ring mates to the canvas regularly
in these last few days with his
switch-hit style.
