# When ‘Devil Wagons’ Worried The Farm

Do you know the part of Lasuen
street that becomes a lane between
the Library and the Outer Quad
the one short stretch of Lasuen from
which cars are barred with stolid,
white posts? That thoroughfare for
pedestrians and bicyclers was the
only road on which automobiles
could be driven in the first Stanford
days of the 1900's.
The Devil Wagon Comes
After hearing of accidents of the
newly invented "devil-wagons," Mrs.
Stanford asked that all Stanford
roads be closed to autos. Soon fol
lowing Mrs. Stanford's request, Dr.
David Starr Jordan, the University's
first president, wrote to a friend re
garding the great automobile prob
lem, "They ought to be kept out
very stringently.
"On the rare occasions when they
stray in they ought to be treated at
first with distinct politeness."
A restrained skepticism regarding
the value of the automobile persisted
at Stanford until 200 cars packed
with Californians were allowed en
trance to the University grounds for
1905's equivalent of a Big Game. This
was followed by a slight relaxing of
regulations, and in 1907 Stanford stu
dents could watch Dr. Jordan drive
his own "invention of Satan" down a
special service road to his home on
campus.
Bad Time for Guests
The University head, however, was
the only person given this privilege
. . . . when Vice-President Fairbanks
came to Stanford to visit a faculty
member, he was forced to park a
block away from the professor's
home in abidance of the strict rules.
By 1908 University officials had
taken a more favorable attitude to
ward the fast-increasing number of
motor cars, so that all the campus
streets were opened to automobile
trafic, except University avenue be
tween the campus and Palo Alto.

Palm Drive remained closed to cars j
until 1914, when the ban was lifted I
and Stanford became part of the
Motor Age .... opening the way for
the days of "a convertible under
every palm tree."
New-Fangled Inventions
Stanford's Eolithic Age was repre
sented by the Stanford without tele
phones in the 1890's, for several years
after the founding of the University.
Dr. Jordan asked for a phivate phone j
in 1901, but he was not granted his i
request until 1909, when telephones ;
were installed in the administration
offices.
During the 10-year interval, the i
whole University made use of a j
single pay phone between 1893 and j
1905 and a phone installed in the ;
Business Office in 1902. The inter- !
departmental phone system set up in
1919 was greeted with great relief ;
by the Business Office, which had
been swamped with calls every day
by prospective students and frantic j
families of University employees.
Edison to the Rescue
Stanford once had its own "Lamp- |
lighter's Serenade," for until 1914
the streets were illuminated in the
evening by the flickering flame of oil
lamps. Travel along Palm Drive j
after dark was dangerous until 1909 i
when the Board of Trustees' action 1
of a few years before was followed by
the placement of electric lights along
the avenue .... another example of
Stanford's first 50 years of constant 1
change paralleling the swift world
changes running rampant throughout
the 20th century.

Edison to the Rescue
Stanford once had its own "Lamp- |
lighter's Serenade," for until 1914
the streets were illuminated in the
evening by the flickering flame of oil
lamps. Travel along Palm Drive j
after dark was dangerous until 1909 i
when the Board of Trustees' action 1
of a few years before was followed by
the placement of electric lights along
the avenue .... another example of
Stanford's first 50 years of constant 1
change paralleling the swift world
changes running rampant throughout
the 20th century.

Do you know the part of Lasuen
street that becomes a lane between
the Library and the Outer Quad
the one short stretch of Lasuen from
which cars are barred with stolid,
white posts? That thoroughfare for
pedestrians and bicyclers was the
only road on which automobiles
could be driven in the first Stanford
days of the 1900's.
The Devil Wagon Comes
After hearing of accidents of the
newly invented "devil-wagons," Mrs.
Stanford asked that all Stanford
roads be closed to autos. Soon fol
lowing Mrs. Stanford's request, Dr.
David Starr Jordan, the University's
first president, wrote to a friend re
garding the great automobile prob
lem, "They ought to be kept out
very stringently.
"On the rare occasions when they
stray in they ought to be treated at
first with distinct politeness."
A restrained skepticism regarding
the value of the automobile persisted
at Stanford until 200 cars packed
with Californians were allowed en
trance to the University grounds for
1905's equivalent of a Big Game. This
was followed by a slight relaxing of
regulations, and in 1907 Stanford stu
dents could watch Dr. Jordan drive
his own "invention of Satan" down a
special service road to his home on
campus.
Bad Time for Guests
The University head, however, was
the only person given this privilege
. . . . when Vice-President Fairbanks
came to Stanford to visit a faculty
member, he was forced to park a
block away from the professor's
home in abidance of the strict rules.
By 1908 University officials had
taken a more favorable attitude to
ward the fast-increasing number of
motor cars, so that all the campus
streets were opened to automobile
trafic, except University avenue be
tween the campus and Palo Alto.

Palm Drive remained closed to cars j
