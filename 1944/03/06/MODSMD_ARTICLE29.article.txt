# Bandage Rollers, Keep up Quota!
## 
### 
Work in the Red Cross Surgical
Dressing Room has improved lately,
according to Martha Austin, chair
man. but there is still a great varia
tion in the number of bandages
rolled each week.
"There has been a good turnout,
but some weeks are better than
others," said Miss Austin. "Perhaps
it js because the girls do not under
stand that they must go every week
if they pledged certain hours."
Girls who can't work during their
assigned hours must send a substi
tute, because every day women come
from Palo Alto to supervise the
bandage rolling, and their time is
wasted if the quota of girls is not
there.
"Rolling bandages is not the most
glamorous thing to be doing," de
clared Miss Austin, "but our wound
ed men need the dressings more than
anyone can hope to imagine. Think
ing of their need might help you to
forget a stiff back or tired fingers."
