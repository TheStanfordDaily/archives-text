# Red Cross Backs Our Fighting Men in Kwajalein; Are You Backing Them in the Red Cross Drive Now?
## Can We Raise $2,400 in 2 Days? 
### 
Stanford is now in the sixth day of j
the Red Cross War Fund Drive
which began March 1. In the past six
days only $600 has been donated
from the campus living groups and
booths. This means that in the next
two days four times that amount
must be collected so that our $3,000- j
quota may be reached for the j
Wednesday deadline.
With the donations to date total
ing $627.11, we need $2,400 to be
donated through the Red Cross j
representatives, according to Bar- j
bara White, treasurer of the drive.

Regarding' the returns that have
been made thus far. Gamma Phi
and Roble Corridor 3C have turned
in a 100 per cent record. Other
returns include Fillmore, $51 80;
Roble 3C, $44; Roble 3A, $36; Roble
IC, $30; Eucalypto, $29 50; Roble
