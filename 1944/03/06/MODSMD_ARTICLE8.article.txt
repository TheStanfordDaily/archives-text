### 
Orchesis' Pre-Classic Dance con
cert, contrary to the expectations of
Orchesis itseif, was protracted for
more than two hours in Memorial
Hall Thursday night. It disclosed at
least an extreme amount of prepar
atory work.
The chamber orchestra, which
opened proceedings with Bach's in
terminable 11th Suite, was prac
tically extraordinary. But Baroque
much becomes pretty dreary after a
while, wouldn't you say?
The costuming was excellent, the
reader, Gloria Olivi, absolutely un
impeachable. Two of the dance se
lections were uncommonly entertain
ing. One was "Pavane a la mode''
by Gould; its steps were the trickiest
of the evening. The other was
"Belles of the Ball" to the Gavotte
from "Mignon," in which Misses
Lotte Martens, Catherine Jones, and
Candy Taylor flitted around a beach
ball in 1890 bathing suits. Really
pre-classical.
Two other unusual numbers were
a quartet lying on the floor wriggling
their legs against a backboard; and
a duo kicking about to the unac
companied singing of an old air by
Miss Taylor. The closing Chaconne
was well done; and Jacqueline Ogg's
solo interpretation of a Browning
poem was undoubtedly expert, if in
comprehensible.—Covey
