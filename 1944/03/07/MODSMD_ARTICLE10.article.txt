# Stanford Dailies Past and Present
## 
### 
Today being Founders' Day at
Stanford, the Daily is presenting
three pages and a pictorial review
illustrating the Farm of the nineties
and the early years.
The type is old style, the kind used
when the first copies of the Daily
appeared. The masthead, bearing the
title of the paper is done in script
and headlines for stories are of the
old Antique type.
Perhaps the most interesting fea
ture of these first Dailies is the com
plete lack of large, outstanding head
lines, and all decks are done in in
verted pyramids to lead into the
stories.
The Daily staff hopes that the in
side section will prove interesting to
readers not only as an example of
what the first Stanford students read,
but also as a contrast in material and
typography between past and present
issues.
