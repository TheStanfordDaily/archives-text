ON THE PAGE just opposite this one you will see what might
be called "a reasonably accurate facsimile" of the first Daily
ever published, way back in 1897.
This is the sort of front page our founders read over their
coffee of a morning—without benefit of Cellar atmosphere. This
is the sort of Tabby the class of '01 carried to their 8 ojclocks and
though it be sacrilege to consider, probably read during lecture.
On the inside page you will see the very same ads repro
duced by the very same advertisers as set their lures for the
student pocketbook in 1897. And they are with us yet, the Book
store, the University Pharmacy, Roos Bros, the University Press,
Louis Dahl, Fuller and Co., Wells Fargo Bank. It's a small
world, ain't it?
Notice also the "inverted pyramid" headlines, the fancy
dashes at the end of stories, the absence of any pictures what
ever, the real fancy script of that masthead. In those days every
line was set by hand. Consider the time it must have taken to
get out a four-page sheet.
Well, all things considered, maybe the Daily has progressed
along with the rest of our favorite University, huh?
