# Ye Olde Stanforde

BACK in the days when you never smoked on Quad —no matter
how much of a heel you were, when the Law Steps were never
trod upon by feminine shoes, back when Stanford was just
beginning to be something. Them were the days!
Stanford students today are a funny bunch. We go around
professing over and over again our deep love for Stanford, for
the beauty of the Quad, for the ivy vines on Roble, for the won
ders of the Farm. We love it here!
And what do we know about it? Not much.
But some of the Stanford family—the real Stanfordites—
know a lot about the University, its traditions, and the many
things that have gone before to build the foundation upon which
we rest today. They know about Stanford. They've lived Stan
ford.
Come to Memorial Church at 10 today. Hear Chancellor
Wilbur. And then if you still feel like burning your tobacco on
Quad, take a glance at the second word to begin with an "h"
in this edit and know, brother (or sister), that you're a big one.
