# Bull Session

### JEAN LEVINSON 
Today is Founders' Day, a day that should hold significance
for every Stanford student. This is the one time when everyone
can demonstratively show his appreciation for Stanford and its 1
founders. It is also an opportunity for many to hear Chancellor
Wilbur for the first time.
Classes are dismissed at 10 o'clock—Memorial Church is
the'place—Founders' Day is the event —so let's really have
100 per cent turnout to pay tribute to our fine University, and to
the men who made it possible.

Friday night at Memorial Auditorium a colossal show is
going on the "boards." It's the "Army Play by Play"—three
lop-notch one-act plays given by and for G.l.'s. These Boyers in
khaki have been rehearsing for several months now, and from 1
the looks of dress rehearsal, they've really put together a ter- J
rific evening's entertainment.
Every soldier student is urged to come—and you won't want j
to miss Eud Irving's expectant-father routine, or Ed Costikyan's j
intrigues with Dotty Lamour. It's a pity the gals can't attend, 1
'cause Dick Carter's "Rhett Butler" drawl and Tom Tull in pin-;
srtipe civvies are enough to make you join their fan clubs
pronto!
Don't forget G.l.'s—Friday night for a swell show and a can- :
teen full of laughs.
