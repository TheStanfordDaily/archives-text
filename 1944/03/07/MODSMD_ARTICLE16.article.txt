Milling crowds of people who
didn't get up early enough to get
their copy of the Chaparral were
turned away from the sumptuous
Chappie offices by Business Man
ager Bill Gilbert, who said. "There
just isn't another copy left."
The mag appeared on Quad at
9 a.m. and all 2,100 copies were
sold out three hours and nine min
utes later. Chief reason for such
a fast sell-out was that so many
people bought up a number of
copies of the magazine to send to
friends in the service.
Worn-out salesgirls were report
ed to be doing as well as could be
expected in view of the terrific
three-hour ordeal they underwent.
