# Director, Crews Make Furniture
## 
### 
As Pennsylvania Dutch furniture
is unattainable in this part of the
country, John Sollers, technical di
rector of the Stanford Players' next
production, "Papa Is All," has had to
make a complete set of kitchen fur
niture for the play which will be
presented in the Little Theater on
March 15, 16, 17, 18, and 20.
Stocky wooden tables and cup
boards have been made by Sollers
and members of the stage crew and
stage technique classes. As the play
concerns a family of Mennonites who
believe that everything, including
furniture, should have a purely utili
tarian purpose, the set will be very
plain, void of any superfluous dec
oration.
Featured in ' Papa Is All" are Atha
Hillback and Harlen Adams, acting
professor of speech and drama, as
Mama and Papa Aukamp; Margaret
Morgan as their daughter Emma;
Duane Heath as their son Jake; Jean
Levinson as the town gossip, Mrs.
Yoder; and Irving Abrams as State
Trooper Brendle.
