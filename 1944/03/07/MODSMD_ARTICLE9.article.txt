western Ukraine, and captured more
than 100 towns on the broadening
front spread across Poland in south
western Russia.

Kroskurov railroad junction, 24 miles
to the southwest and toward which
other Soviet forces were striking
from the northwest. The latter force
captured the town of Cherny-Ostrov.
11 miles northwest of Kroskurov.
