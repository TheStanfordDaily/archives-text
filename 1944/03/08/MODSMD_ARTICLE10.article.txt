DELICIOUS DELIRIUM
What is more distressing than to feel swell, and yet be con
fined in a hospital just because an absurd rash called "measles"
is shunned by society?
Well, well—it's about as cozy in this sterilized room as try
ing to take a nap in the middle of Grand Central Station. There
is a constant stream of Flo Nightingales swishing in and out, and
timing each entrance to coincide with the time you are nodding
off to sleep.
Just as the first contented snores are emitted, swoooosh —
and you're gnashing a glass rod with your incisors. Yeah, Nursie
has slyly jammed a thermometer past your pivot tooth, and there
you are—nibbling bits of glass and working up a terrific tem
perature.
Booming starchily over to the light, Nursie studies the ther
mometer and utters weird clucking noises, and gives with look
No. 389 a, or 'Sis, there ain't a prayer."
After that ordeal you decide this is a choice time to really
hit the books—absorb the knowledge—make with the education.
But this is prevented by a little old gent who soft-shoes it in and
out at 15-minute intervals.-First he enters with a mop, the next
time with a broom, and so on. You begin to feel that he's culti
vating a potato crop in the corner of the room and is doing it
the hard way.
The most excruciating joy is being hoisted around in bed—
you know, those cagey levers that raise and lower the darndest
portions. Always did want to wrap my legs around my head
anyway.
And there's the brutal Nurse Cavell who sprang in and started
a back-rubbing routine. After two of my better vertebrae had
popped out the window, she mashed my face into the mattress,
handed me back my uppers, and left roaring hysterically.
Oh. Here comes "Sadistic Sarah" with a determined look in
her eyes and a scalpel in her rugged paddy. See ya on Quad.
