To the Editor:
And Three Perturbed Union Girls:
In answer to your comments about the Nitery, I put forth the
following:
1. The Nitery is cleaned every night of the week except
Saturday by the men's halls right after closing. Sunday morning
it is given a thorough going over by various groups on the
campus.
2. All women's living groups close at 12 o'clock on Friday
nights, and most girls don't take l:3o's unless for a special reason.
3. Every Saturday night night this quarter there has been at
least one dance lasting until 1 o'clock. The Nitery was set up as
a meeting place for the campus, to be open when most people
can use it. Why should it be opened for a few couples who
.might not have anything else to do, which would require some
one to stay up and close it?
Also, girls' groups are hostesses at the Nitery from 8:30 to 12
o'clock and I believe it is unfair to ask them to stay in the Nitery
on Saturday nights for four and one-half hours at a stretch.
If "spring has sprung" as you admit and you are in need of a
place to go on Saturday night after 12, why don't you try the lake
or a nice warm car with a heater in it?
Sincerely,
Mr. Anthony.
