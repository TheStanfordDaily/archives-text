# 'Kiss and Tell' Returns to S.F.
## 
### 
"Kiss and Tell" is coming back to
, San Francisco. George Abbott, who
| produced and directed the hilarious
I comedy which played the Curran for
1 10 weeks earlier this season, has
; heeded the demand of the manage
i ment of the Geary Theater, and a
limited engagement begins at that
i house Tuesday evening, March 7. A
I Monday evening opening is impos
| sible due to transportation facilities,
I which cannot carry the production
i from Seattle in time for a Monday
| opening.
i Since leaving San Francisco last
i December, successful engagements
I have been played in Los Angeles, and
; other Southern California cities, and
Portland. Vancouver, and Victoria.
