(This is the last in a series of four articles concerning the early history
of Stanford published in conncction with the celebration of Founders' Day
tomorrow, March 9.)
Stanford memories of campus life when the University was young are
as colorful and jumbled as a kaleidoscope, for the days at the turn of the

were changeable and otten
unpredictable.
There was the great day of Oct.
20, 1891, when all the freshmen
staged a walk-out rfom a student
body meeting, because of a phrase
in the newly drafted constitution
which debarred freshman from of
fice .... the election of Charles
Ernest Chadsey, who later became
superintendent of schools in Den
ver and Chicago, as the first Stanford
student body president .... and
I Roble Hall's first unwritten social
regulations, "In at 9 p.m., on time for
meals."
1 "A Thousand Times, No."
The flurry when the Encina boys
of the first class invited the lioble
girls to a reception .... the crush
ing answer "No" the Encina gentle
-1 men received because the Roble
| girls felt it improper to dance with
young men they had known for such
a short time .... and "Plug-Ugly,"
the bitter battle to the death be
tween the junior and senior classes
consisting of a poster fight, a show,
and a hat-snatching episode,
j 1896, the year when Will Irwin
produced an axe at an intercollegiate
baseball game in San Francisco, and
1899, when the blue-and-gold wavers
of U, of C. stole the axe and it be
came known as The Axe, a symbol of
Stanford itself .... and the Cardinal
revenge when the Cal Senior' Fence
was snatched, only to have the
Fence branded by Cal students as "a
I nuisance, anyhow."

The beginning of the Senior Plate
; tradition, brain-child of the class of
! 1896, consisting of replacing a con

| with a brass plate over a sealed cop
j per box containing records and me-
I mentos .... the first game between
| U. of C. and Stanford on March 19,
i 1892, in San Francisco, the special
train from Palo Alto trailing cardinal
red bunting, the record crowd of
8,000, the discovery that neither team
had brought a football, and the final
Stanford victory, 14-10.
