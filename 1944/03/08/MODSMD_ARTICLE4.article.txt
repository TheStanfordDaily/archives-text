# All-Army Play Given For Soldiers Friday
## 
### 
"Button Up Your Lip," "Mail Call," and "Pack Up Your Troubles" will
comprise the agenda of the Stanford ASTU's production of "The Army
Play by Play," which will be presented Friday night to audience made up
of officers and men of this post.
As the rights to do the three plays, which were presented on Broadway

last year for the benefit of the Army j
Emergency Relief, were given to
ASTU 3905 free of royalty, no ad
mission will be charged but admit- 1
tance will be reserved to those in
uniform.
Army students will be excused
from study hall at 8:30 in order to
attend the performance which will
be held in Memorial Auditorium.
"Button Your Lip"
"Button Your Lip" is a farce taking
place in the latrine of a reception
center where the men are being
processed. The plot revolves around
the spreading of rumors in which
little "G.I. Joe" Denby, the original
"Red Sack," is suspected of being an
enemy agent. Complications arise
when official papers are lost and
Dorothy Lamour arrives in camp.
"Mail Call," which has been broad
cast coast to cost several times since
its New York premier, is a light
drama about a letter to a combat
casualty. The scene is set in a de
stroyed village somewhere in the
theater of operations after the men
have returned from combat.
Father. Spies, and Train
The third one-act play, "Pack Up
Your Troubles." is a hilarious com- !
edy about an expectant father, two 1
Nazi espionage agents, and a troop
train. The play takes place between ]
taps and reveille in a receiving sta
tion where everything is received
from soldiers to sardines.
The plot evolves around the trials
and tribulations of young Pvt. Elmer
Benson, played by Bud Irving, who
is captured by enemy agents on the
night that he is to become a father.
This is the first time that these
three one-act plays, which are from
a group of five prize winners of an
all-army play writing contest held
last year by John Golden, noted New
York producer, have been presented
since their. initial production and
.our.
David Sievers of the speech and
drama department is directing the
army group and Pfc. Bud Irving is
production manager. Victor Amend
is stage manager. Entre-acte music
will be played by an all-army or
chestra under the direction of Harry
Brown.
