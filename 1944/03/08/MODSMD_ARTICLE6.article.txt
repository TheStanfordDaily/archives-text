# Red Cross $400 Short of Goal
## 
### 
With today the last clay of the Red Cross Drive on campus, only an
additional $1(1(1.42 is needed to reach the $3,000 quota. "This does not seem
too impossible because there are still some groups who haven't turned in
any money," said Barbara White, treasurer of the drive.
Collections yesterday totaled $1,444.04, making Stanford s contribution

to the National Red Cross War Fund
Drive $2,583.58. Several groups have
already gone 100 per cent Â«r over,
and those who have not contributed
are asked to do so today to living
group representatives or at the
booths on Quad.
The representatives from the liv
ing groups must turn in their moitey
and supplies today between 1 and 2
in the Nitery.
"The amount of the donations this
year has already exceeded last year's
all-time high ol $2,029, but it would
be wonderful to pass the $3,000
mark,' Cheri Martin, drive chairman,
said.
