# Mitchells Blast Rome RAilyards and Toulons

ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES, March 7
(UP) â€”American Billy Mitchell and
Marauder bombers today blasted the
Rome railyards while heavy bomb
ers, in a smashing resumption of the
15th Air Force's strategic offensive,
attacked the U-boat base at Toulons,
railroad targets in Florence, and air
fields just north of Rome.
The targets of the medium bomb
ers of the 12th Air Force were the
Littorio and Ostense, respectively,
in the northern and southern out
skirts of Rome, and preliminary re
ports indicated that extensive dam
age was caused to rolling stock and
trackage.
The full-scale resumption of the
air offensive coincided with an out
break of sharp fighting in Cassino,
where American troops have been
stalled since Feb. 2, while the Allies
held firm to their beachhead lines
after a new exchange with the Ger
mans on the flooded battlefield below
Rome.
Flying Fortresses of Maj. Gen.
Nathan F. Twining's 15th Air Force
reported good coverage of Toulons
in the first attack on the former
French naval base since Feb. 4. Hits
were scored on U-boat pens and
storage areas and ships in the harbor,
while one medium-sized vessel was
seen to explode.
