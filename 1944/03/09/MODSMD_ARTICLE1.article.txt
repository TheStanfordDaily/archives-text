# 1906 EARTHQUAKE TALE.
## Heroine of Epic Mrs. Ruth Allen Now Assists Professor in Psychology Dept. 
### 
(In an article published in The
Daily Tuesday in connection with
today's celebration of Founders'
Day and concerning the history of
Stanford and the earthquake of
1906, an anecdote about two young
coeds was quoted from Elliott's
History of Stanford . . . one of
the girls being named Ruth. Yes
terday The Daily discovered that
Ruth, the heroine of the earth
quake tale, is back again on the
Stanford campus. Her full name
is Mrs. Ruth Allen, and she is at
• -esent assisting with vocational
erest test work in the office of
Edward Kellogg Strong, Jr.)
Mrs. Allen, a slim, gray-haired
woman whose sense of humor is as
lively as it was when she was a 1
year-old freshman in 1906, is able
to laugh today when she recalls the
first moments after the earthquake
which occurred at 13 minutes past
five o'clock on the morning of April
IS. 1906.
"The history book has it a little
bit. wrong," she said. "As a matter
of fact, when my roommate asked
me where I was 1 answered, 'Down
here on the piano,' which was
nearly correct, for 1 had plunged
down through the floor to the spot
in the parlor where the piano al
ways stood. My roommate, Zemula
Ddoley, a Southerner from Geor
gia. had been crying, 'Ruth's done
gone . . . Ruth's done gone!'"
Elliott's History records the in
cident from a letter written by one
of the two roommates' friends: "I
ran into the parlor and found Ruth
just getting out of bed and shaking
off" the plaster. Her room had sunk
right down in the middle, taking
her bed with it, and she wasn't
scratched. Her roommate was still
tip on the third floor, having hys
terics and calling. '(), Ruth, where
are you-' Ruth calmly answered,
'Down here in the parlor.'"
At the time of the great temblor
Ruble Hall was the building which
is now called Sequoia, and Mrs.
Allen and her roommate were in a
single room with massive chimneys
«m either side which collapsed and
carried the floor downward one
story.
"We bad been wakened by a
sound like that of a great rumbling
wind." Mrs. Allen relates. "It
wasn't until I bad said. 'Let's get
• >ut of here!' and was sitting on the
edge of my bed putting on my Jap
anese kimona, that the final crash
came. Afterwards I found that 1
wasn't hurt, although my first
ihought had been, 'Well, now we're
ah killed.' J didn't feel any fear
. . . just a curious vacuum of
thought from the sudden shock."
Two days after the earthquake
Mrs. Allen was able to reach her
home in Bakerslield. She returned
to the University when it reopened
and later was graduated and re
ceived her teacher's certificate from
Stan ford.
"Yes, the earthquake was such
staggering thing," Mrs. Allen
added, "that we felt ourselves to
be very small in the face of it. The
t-xperience made us realize our per
sonal insignificance. It was some
thing one can never forget."
