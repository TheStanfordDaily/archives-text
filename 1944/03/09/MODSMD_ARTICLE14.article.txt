Everybody is running around
madly, waving hands in the air,
jumping' up and down, doing equal
ly intellectual things. When we
first saw the symptoms yesterday,
we were perplexed. What could it
all mean?
Probably, we figured, it was the
result of Founders' Day. The co
eds were all excited because the
School had been founded some num
ber of years back and naturally if
the school hadn't been founded they
wouldn't be here and if .they weren't
here, they wouldn't be enjoying the
grandeur of the Stanford campus
and if they weren't enjoying the
grandeur . . . Then we gathered
the soldiers were also happy be
cause they too were glad the school
was founded some number of years
back, and they also wouldn't be
here if the school wasn't founded,
and besides, they were getting out
of a ten o'clock class.
But on further inquiry, we real
ized it was more than a mere birth
day celebration that put the spir
ited spirit in the air. For if we
hadn't realized it before, the thing
suddenly knocked us over the head,
and all was clear. It was that cer
tain time, and young men's fancies
were turning!
0.K., so the calendar does say
March 9th. And what if it is the
middle of winter. It's California,
isn't it? We've heard about this
weather every time we dodged un
other mud puddle. Each time we
laughingly told ourselves, "Oh, we
love to walk in the rain ... if
we're dressed for it," we were told
about the heavenly days to come.
Now, we don't exactly believe it.
Except that the sun was out. That's
the intriguing part of it. The sun
a -as out. We, and lots of other
people, saw it. And we, and-lots of
other people, remarked that at last
the warm weather was here, and
at last we could go out to the mythi
cal lake and enjoy it. And at last
we could see the Farm and all the
co-eds, respectively, in all their
glory. At last, as we said before,
that spring-ish feeling was in the
air.
Co-eds with colorful, well-built
sweaters, and colorful, well-built
convertibles, also respectively, were
touring the campus. The spirit was
gay. The air was carefree. Even
the "hup, two, three, four" seemed
to have an added rhythm to it.
The soldiers can leave without
regrets now. For at last they can
say they've seen a full twenty-four
hours of weather, with not even one
undernourished, little drizzle. Peo
ple can keep running around madly,
waving hands in the air, jumping
up and down, doing equally intel
lectual things. It looks great.
But we think we're getting
grouchy once more. It looks like
the sun's gonna start dripping
again!

we could see the Farm and all the
co-eds, respectively, in all their
glory. At last, as we said before,
that spring-ish feeling was in the
air.
Co-eds with colorful, well-built
sweaters, and colorful, well-built
convertibles, also respectively, were
touring the campus. The spirit was
gay. The air was carefree. Even
the "hup, two, three, four" seemed
to have an added rhythm to it.
The soldiers can leave without
regrets now. For at last they can
say they've seen a full twenty-four
hours of weather, with not even one
undernourished, little drizzle. Peo
ple can keep running around madly,
waving hands in the air, jumping
up and down, doing equally intel
lectual things. It looks great.
But we think we're getting
grouchy once more. It looks like
the sun's gonna start dripping
again!
Everybody is running around
madly, waving hands in the air,
jumping' up and down, doing equal
ly intellectual things. When we
first saw the symptoms yesterday,
we were perplexed. What could it
all mean?
Probably, we figured, it was the
result of Founders' Day. The co
eds were all excited because the
School had been founded some num
ber of years back and naturally if
the school hadn't been founded they
wouldn't be here and if .they weren't
here, they wouldn't be enjoying the
grandeur of the Stanford campus
and if they weren't enjoying the
grandeur . . . Then we gathered
the soldiers were also happy be
cause they too were glad the school
was founded some number of years
back, and they also wouldn't be
here if the school wasn't founded,
and besides, they were getting out
of a ten o'clock class.
But on further inquiry, we real
ized it was more than a mere birth
day celebration that put the spir
ited spirit in the air. For if we
hadn't realized it before, the thing
suddenly knocked us over the head,
and all was clear. It was that cer
tain time, and young men's fancies
were turning!
0.K., so the calendar does say
March 9th. And what if it is the
middle of winter. It's California,
isn't it? We've heard about this
weather every time we dodged un
other mud puddle. Each time we
laughingly told ourselves, "Oh, we
love to walk in the rain ... if
we're dressed for it," we were told
about the heavenly days to come.
Now, we don't exactly believe it.
Except that the sun was out. That's
the intriguing part of it. The sun
a -as out. We, and lots of other
people, saw it. And we, and-lots of
other people, remarked that at last
the warm weather was here, and
at last we could go out to the mythi
cal lake and enjoy it. And at last
we could see the Farm and all the
co-eds, respectively, in all their
