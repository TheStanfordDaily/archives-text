# HANDBOOK OF MAPS.
## Dr. Eliot Mears, Professor of Geography, Writes Book on "Pacific Ocean." 
### 
Packed into a little volume that
rests easily in one hand are the
answers to a thousand questions
being asked by Americans who
want to understand the war and
postwar problems of the Pacific.
The handbook is entitled, "Pa
cific Ocean,'" and is the work of
Dr. Eliot Grinnell Mears, profes
sor of geography and international
trade at Stanford. The publisher is
James Ladcl Delkin of Stanford,
whose vocation and avocation are
the issuing of unusual and inter
esting books.
Illustrating the 192 pages are
more than 50 maps, drawings and
charts, showing distribution of
population, ocean currents, wind ve
locities. typhoon tracks, tempera
ture zones, rainfall distribution,
navigation by stars, radio beams,
and much other useful information
that can he most swiftly appre
hended in visual form.
A valuable supplement is a folder
which can he opened out to show
global maps of the west, east and
central Pacific. These are photo
graphs made bv B. W. Crandall of
Palo Alto. This open-up sheet also
gives a map of the California-In
dies and a small map of the Soviet
Pacific drawn by P. Stanley King
of the Stanford Food Research In
stitute.
Mr. King also drew the diverting
sketches of various types of seago
ing craft—the Mexican trader, the
Polynesian sailboat, the Japanese
canoe, a rubber lifeboat, an arctic
ship, and others.
The importance of having and
correctly using good maps is em
phasized by Professor Mears, who
says, "to become educated, there is
no substitute for many maps." He
considers the global maps included
as inserts "the most generally satis
factory for general use" as having
the minimum of distortion.
In his informative first chapter,
"Behold the Pacific," Dr. Mears
disposes of the seven seas fiction
and lists just three oceans—the At
lantic, the Indian, and the Pacific.
Of these, he declares, the Pacific is
outstanding for many reasons,
among them the fact that it pro
vides "the main highway for over
half the world's population."
Succeeding chapters are devoted
to the basin of the ocean, the Amer
ican side, the Asiatic side, Oceania,
volcanoes and earthquakes," ocean
currents, tides and tidal waves,
winds, violent storms, temperature,
precipitation, fog and visibility,
navigation, sea water and geomag
netism.
The last chapter, with its impli
cations for communications, con
cludes with the statement: "Future
questions of human safety, progress
and discovery await the recordings
of the magnetic needle. Mysteries
of worlds unknown at present tarry
for our probing."
