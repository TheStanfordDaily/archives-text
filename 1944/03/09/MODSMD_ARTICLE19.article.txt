# The 						Giving of Blood.
## 
### 
Six million life-giving pints of
blood have been collected thus far
and some five million more will
start their miraculous journey from
the folks back home to the veins of
in jured American lighting men this
year, through the largest single con
trolled undertaking in medical his
tory, the American Ked Cross
Blood Donor Service.
From millions of home front
workers in every walk of life these
blood donations are flowing through
the Ked Cross to every battle front
and to ships at sea.
Hailed by General Dwight D. Ei
senhower as the "most important
single advance in the surgical treat
ment of the wounded in this war,"
the use of plasma, processed from
blood, is given a major share of the
credit for reduction of the mor
tality rate to half that of World
War I.
Plasma is the liquid part of the
blood in which the corpuscle cells
float. At the laboratory, plasma is
extracted by a centrifuging process,
frozen and dehydrated into the
powdered form in which it is
shipped. I'lasma, when mixed with
distilled water, is ready for trans
fusion in a matter of minutes.
Cross-matching of blood types, as
in direct transfusion, is unneces
sary.
The dramatic story of the Ked
Cross Blood Donor Service,
through which thousands of sol
diers and sailors literally have been
brought back from the dead, began
in February 1941, when the Sur
geons General of the Army and
Navy asked the Ked Cross to pro
cure 15.000 pints of blood. Bv the
end of 1941, 50,000 had been* col
lected.
From the moment of the attack
on Pearl Harbor bringing the Uni
ted States into the war, the need
for plasma and serum albumin
grew. In 1942, 1.2500,000 pints of
blood were collected for the Army
and Navy. Last year, that figure
was more than trebled. More than
4.()()(),()()() donations were made
through the Ked Cross, and this
year the goal is more than 5,000,000
pints.
From one center in New York,
which collected 757 pints in 1941,
the Blood Donor Service has grown
to a nation-wide project collecting
approximately 100,000 pints each
week. The addition of new Blood
Donor Centers early this year
brings to 35 the number of centers
in operation. Mobile units visit
more than 800 nearby communities
under the auspices of the local Red
Cross chapter.
Among thousands who have
voiced the importance of plasma are
Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, whose Fifth
Army fought a bloody path through
Italy; Maj. (Jen. Alexander Van
degrift of the Marines; Maj. Gen.
Norman T. Kirk, Surgeon General
of the Army; and Rear Admiral
Ross T. Mclntire, Surgeon Gen

the Blood Donor Service has grown
to a nation-wide project collecting
approximately 100,000 pints each
week. The addition of new Blood
Donor Centers early this year
brings to 35 the number of centers
in operation. Mobile units visit
more than 800 nearby communities
under the auspices of the local Red
Cross chapter.
Among thousands who have
voiced the importance of plasma are
Lt. Gen. Mark Clark, whose Fifth
Army fought a bloody path through
Italy; Maj. (Jen. Alexander Van
degrift of the Marines; Maj. Gen.
Norman T. Kirk, Surgeon General
of the Army; and Rear Admiral
Ross T. Mclntire, Surgeon Gen
eral of the Navy.
Six million life-giving pints of
blood have been collected thus far
and some five million more will
start their miraculous journey from
the folks back home to the veins of
in jured American lighting men this
year, through the largest single con
trolled undertaking in medical his
tory, the American Ked Cross
Blood Donor Service.
From millions of home front
workers in every walk of life these
blood donations are flowing through
the Ked Cross to every battle front
and to ships at sea.
Hailed by General Dwight D. Ei
senhower as the "most important
single advance in the surgical treat
ment of the wounded in this war,"
the use of plasma, processed from
blood, is given a major share of the
credit for reduction of the mor
tality rate to half that of World
War I.
Plasma is the liquid part of the
blood in which the corpuscle cells
float. At the laboratory, plasma is
extracted by a centrifuging process,
frozen and dehydrated into the
powdered form in which it is
shipped. I'lasma, when mixed with
distilled water, is ready for trans
fusion in a matter of minutes.
Cross-matching of blood types, as
in direct transfusion, is unneces
sary.
The dramatic story of the Ked
Cross Blood Donor Service,
through which thousands of sol
diers and sailors literally have been
brought back from the dead, began
in February 1941, when the Sur
geons General of the Army and
Navy asked the Ked Cross to pro
cure 15.000 pints of blood. Bv the
end of 1941, 50,000 had been* col
lected.
From the moment of the attack
on Pearl Harbor bringing the Uni
ted States into the war, the need
for plasma and serum albumin
grew. In 1942, 1.2500,000 pints of
blood were collected for the Army
and Navy. Last year, that figure
was more than trebled. More than
4.()()(),()()() donations were made
through the Ked Cross, and this
year the goal is more than 5,000,000
pints.
From one center in New York,
which collected 757 pints in 1941,
the Blood Donor Service has grown
to a nation-wide project collecting
approximately 100,000 pints each
week. The addition of new Blood
