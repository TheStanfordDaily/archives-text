Mairzy doats and doezy doats, but
liddle lammsies do not eat ivy, Dr.
L. T. Merillat says.
It is not that he does not like the
currently popular son,ir, Dr. Meril
lat explained, but as editor of the
journal of the American Veteri

country —he is interested only in
established fact.
"Mares eat oats," he said, "and

does probably would eat oats, too.
But lambs and ivy, no, I'm afraid
not —unless they're very little lambs
and not particularly elioosv."
