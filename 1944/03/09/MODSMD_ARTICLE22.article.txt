Looking back and glancing over
some of the Dailies of the late
189()'s we can find quite a few
amusing ads — indicative of the
time—foreign to us.
Some of the better ones we've in
cluded below:
"Dates, figs, and hot peanuts at
Wilson's."
"Mr. Carrel will trade you a
bright new harness or carriage for
your old one. No charge to see
him."
"Mr. Freshman, ask the upper
classmen where to go to get an

"Vosemite Excursions — Ex
pense, §50 for 12 days; extra time,

Camp. Six days in the Park."
"Close one eye and then the other.
