# Germans Mass Fresh Troops For Fourth Anzio Assault
## 
### 
ALLIED HEADQUARTERS, NAPLES (UP)â€”The German Army was
reported massing fresh troops against the Allies' Anzio beachhead today
and spying for openings through which to launch a fourth major attack,
while a new bloody street battle enveloped Cassino.
Six months to the day after Italy finally quit the war, her lands were

* still a bitterly contested battle
ground, her people were beset by
all the miseries of war, and the road
to Rome was still barred to the
Allies by desperate German armies.
American troops fought a brief,
but fierce, gun duel with one enemy
group west of Cisterna, and short
clashes were reported all around the
beachhead perimeter.
