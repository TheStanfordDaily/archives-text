# Daily Adsâ€” Then and Now
## 
### 
Advertisers for 43 years in Stan
ford University's daily publication
are still supplying their services to
Stanford students. Although the
copy-writing style has changed, the
makeup of the advertisements vastly
different, and the type long since j
obsolete, Farm students of today are \
supporting the same companies that
their fathers did in the 1890 s.
What is now Wells Fargo was then
The Nevada National Bank of San
Francisco; Roos Bros., the Stanford
Bookstore, the Stanford University
Press, and the Southern Pacific are
in name what they were then; but
the Louis Dahl's that our parents i
patronized 43 years ago has been
taken over by his son, John F. Dahl, j
and the company now bears his !
name. Louis is still living, however, i
to see the fruits of his work begun a
half a century ago; he is now 91
years old.
