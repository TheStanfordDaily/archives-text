## 3 Smash-Hits to Be Presented to G.I. Audience Tomorrow at 8:30 p.m. 
### 
"The Army Play bv Play" .will
be presented tomorrow evening at
8:30 in Memorial Auditorium for a
"strictly (1.1." audience. Soldier
students who wish to attend the
one-act plays will be excused from
study ball by their company com
manders.
The presentation consists of three
smash-hit plays written by service
men: "Button Your Lip," "Mail
Call," and "Pack I'p Your Troub
les." John Golden, an outstanding
New York producer, has. released
these three one-acts for presenta
tion without the usual royalty being
assessed. For this reason, onl\
Army personel will be admitted.
"Button Your Lip" has as its set
ting a complicated and busy recep
tion center where the men are being
"processed." Among the fellows
being pushed through there is one
character who is suspiciously like
an enemy agent. This sounds rath
er sinister, but actually the play is
a pleasant farce. Later Dorothy
Lamour's entrance to the camp
livens up the plot.
The second production. "Mail
Call," has a more somber motive.
The action is set in an area of op
erations in which some exhausted
soldiers are returning for a brief
break in the lighting, Upon their
arrival, mail is given out. The plot
revolves around a letter which is
destined never to reach its addres
see. since that man has been killed
in action. This play is probably the
best known of all. as it has been
; broadcast several times on coast-to-
I coast hook-ups.
"Pack I'p Your Troubles" will
be the final production of the pro
i grant. Of all nights, poor Pvt. Ki
lmer Benson finds himself made a
prisoner of the enemy on the very
night he is to become a father. This
I situation, tragi-eomedy as it is. pro
j vides an unusually unique play.
