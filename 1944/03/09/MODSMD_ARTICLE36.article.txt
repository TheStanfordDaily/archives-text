# Baker Speech Well Received; U.S., U.S.S.R. Futures Told
## 
### 
Alonzo Bakev aroused both laughter and applause, unusual from a
Tuesday Series audience, when he talked about Russia and our inevitable
relations with them in the future, at Memorial Auditorium Tuesday night.
Approaching the problem from what he called the typical American atti
tude, he felt that he had to admit that whether or not we liked their way

K of life, whether or not we thought
that they were right or wrong, we
might as well face the fact that we
were going to have to deal with the
U.S.S.R. prominently in the postwar
world.
Firmly tossing aside the attitude
that Russian foreign policy and its
"Uncle Joe" were enigmas. Mr.
Baker said that our trouble was that
we were so used to people saying one
thing and meaning something else
that when frank people like Stalin
told us right out what they were
doing and what they intended to do,
we just don't believe it.
War Aims
Mr. Baker said that far from Rus
sian war aims being a mystery, they
were the only country that really
has come out and told what they in
tend to have. He said that United
States foreign policy was a far
greater mystery.
Stalin has said that there must be
a clear buffer between a prospering
postwar Russia and a Germany
whose "Junker" class the Russians
believe will always be a hostile
group devoted to the idea of ruthless
expansion.
The Russians will have Lithuania,
Esthonia, parts of Finland, a guar
antee that the Bosporous will be at
least international, and the sections
around Port Arthur given to Japan
after the Russo-Japanese War.
History Traced
Mr. Baker traced the history of
Russia since the Bolshevik Revolu
tion, telling of their vain attempts
to gain "collective security at Geneva
and the new Russian communism
which Mr. Baker described as worthy
of making Karl Marx turn over in
his grave at 132 m.p.h.
