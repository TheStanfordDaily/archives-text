## 
### JOE ZUKIN 
In a hot game which featured
plenty of rip-roaring basketball, the
Gerona Athletic Club took ihe Cleve
land Hall five into camp last night
by a score of 4.'5 to 35. Both clubs
were in there battling all the way
and through the greater part of the
tussle it was anybody's ball game.
Ry Kelley again came through for
Gerona to score 12 points and took
high point honors for the evening.
Kelley was given plenty of support

by his teamate Pete Lee. who came
up for 1U digits. Both boys got hot
in the second half and began sinking
some long ones from all corners of
the deck.
Taking the scoring honors for the
losers was Tom Hood who rang up
a total of 12 points throughout the
game. At the beginning of the sec
ond half, Cleveland put on a scoring
surge, but were not strong enough
to keep it up and catch their high
scoring opponents.

Hayes Hall defaulted to Tyler in
the other 7:15 game of the night.
Next Tuesday night will wind up
the 1944 edition of the intramural
basketball league. Only one game is
really worth mentioning, and it:
should be a good one. It's the Ruble
Hasher vs. Gerona AC tilt which is
to be played in the pavilion at 8:15
on Tuesday.
The up and coming Gerona squad
has improved greatly since their ini
tial encounter of the season
