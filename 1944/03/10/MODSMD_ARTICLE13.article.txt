# American Flying Fortresses and Liberators Blast Berlin
## Little Opposition Over Burning City 
### 
LONDON (UP)—Another power
ful armada of U.S. Flying Fortresses
and Liberators set new fires in a
still blazing Berlin today, dealing the
battered German capital a second
killing blow in two days. The latest
attack was one of the most success
ful aerial assaults in air war history.
Meeting almost no enemy fighter
opposition, the great fleet of Ameri
can bombers lost 7 of their number
in contrast to 68 on Monday and J8
on Wednesday — a record low for
major Berlin assault, the RAF's low
est being 17 on Dec. 23.
The mighty shepherding force of
fighters, one of which was lost, had
no encounters with the Luftwaffe,
and neither bombers or fighters
claimed a Nazi plane.
Censox's here would not permit an
estimate of the size of the l aiding
force, but it may be revealed that the
U.S. Bth Air Foi'ce low losses were
not indicative of the size of the foice.
One Flying Fortress made a forced
landing in the Swedish province of
Belkinge at noon today, the German
DNB Agency reported from Stock
holm. The bomber was not dam
aged and its crew of 10 was interned
by Swedish military authoiities,
DNB said.


AXIS PlLLBOX—Germany and Italy built many pillboxes
and machine-gun emplacements, like the above, to halt Allies
in their Sicilian campaign. Picture just released in U. S.
shows badly battered pillbox captured near San Croce, Sicily.
