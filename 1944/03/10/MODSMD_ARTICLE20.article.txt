# Cast To Cook Real Pancakes
## 
### 
A batch of home-made pancakes
will be made on stage at the per
formances of "Papa Is All," which
will open next Wednesday night,
March 15, at the Little Theater. The
play, which is about a Pennsylvania
Dutch family that rebels against a
tyrannical father, includes a scene in
which Mama Aukamp prepares the
usual pancakes for Papa's breakfast.
No one in the family likes pancakes
besides Papa; and when Papa is re
ported to have been killed in a train
wreck, his suppressed wife symbol
ically throws away the batter. Papa
has been misusing the Mennonite
tradition for purposes of his own,
withholding in the name of the re
ligion the simple pleasures and rec
reations of daily life from his son
and daughter. Mama is also an au
thentic Mennonite but sees no ob
jections in being a trifle "worldly."
When she hears of Papa's sup
posed death, she is both sad and re
lieved —relieved that now her daugh
ter, Emma, and son, Jake, will be
allowed to live normal lives.
