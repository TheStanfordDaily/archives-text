# Farm Red Cross Drive Nets All-Time High Total of $3,344
## 
### 
The totals for the Red Cross Drive on campus, reported yesterday at the
all-time high of $3,241.76, were supplemented by the turning in of an addi
tional $102.75, bringing the complete total to $3,344.51, according to Bar
bara White, treasurer of the drive. Special donations from the senior class.
Lagunita, Roble, and various living groups helped to top the $3,000 quota
set up by the student committee.

According to Miss White, it was
at first doubtful that the campus
would reach its quota, but the re
turns of Monday's collection made
it evident that Stanford would top
it. This years' increase shows that
students realize how much their
money is needed, and to what worthy
purposes it is being put, Miss White
said.
Washington Hall's representative,
Dick Fayram, turned in an addi
tional $3, and Lucien Rice of Jack
son Hall turned in an additional $28.
Joan Webster, Roble 3C, turned in
$1; Luana Cook from Casa Ventura
turned in contributions amounting
to $48.75; collections from campus
booths and such sources reached $22.
