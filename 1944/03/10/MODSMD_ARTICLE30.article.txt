"The time has come, the Walrus,
-aid, to talk of many things . . .
When lubbers and rain hats are
riling into the closet, when the La
gum ta lake becomes a home for
â€¢ledgeling mosquitoes, and when the
temperature throws off its anchor
and begins to soar, 'tis also time to
think of baseball and less and less
of basketball.
A long way back in the mouldy I
history of journalism, some aspiring ,
sports writer once had the nerve to ;
attempt to dream up an All-Star
team. From that regrettable day on,
it was considered by all other aspir
ing writers to be quite the thing to
do. Pick an All-Soinething-Or-
Qther squad, sit back, and allow
enough arguments to develop to tide
over said writer for the dog days of
ihe future.
"Enough of this talk, let's get down
to business" .... OK brother, let's
not get rough!
Here's the set-up! There are well
/.lore than five good hoopsters selling

their wares on the oak floors of
Stanford. We took the names of
those men whose work has and is
well above par. We added. We con
sidered. We thought back, and we
cast a Nostradamus-like glance into
the future.
Here's the result! The first and
second teams are almost exactly
equal in all phases of play, unfor
tunately only five men to a basket
ball squad .... so we tried to divide
the material up equitably and found
this to be true. First team: Gale, Co.
A, Center; Doomanis, Co. C, Smith,
Co. B, Forwards; Kleinjans, Co. I,
Fryer, Co. E, Guards. Second team:
Lungren, Co. C, Center; Boles, Co.
E, Seliavka, Co. F, Forwards; and
Kuhn, Co. I. Nagy, Co. G, Guards.
Here's the end! March 28 the pres
ent basketball season will formally
be brought to a close. Those AST
men lucky enough to remain at the
'Farm' for the coming quarter will
have the opportunity to compete in
these following tourneys; baseball,
swimming, track, tennis and golf.
