# Overseas Assignments Nothing New to 3 9-L's
## 
### 
The prospect of overseas service
! confronting ASTP students here will
be nothing new for three 9-L lan
guage students of Co. E.
They are Sgt. Tai Hi Lim, Cpl. Jo
seph Szczykno, and Pfc. David S.
! Totah.
I Lim, who wears a bronze star on
I his American defense ribbon, was
i assigned to Schofield Barracks, Ha
j waii, when the Japs pulled their
I sneak attack on Pearl Harbor two
years ago.
For 18 months he served as a
I member of an infantry intelligence
unit. His outfit was charged with
the job of guarding the windward
j side of Oahu Island. Lim holds two
degrees from the University of Ha
waii, where he was a star athlete.
1 He was shipped to this country a i

year ago as a member of a jungle- j
fighting training cadre. His knowl- ;
edge of the Korean language, how- |
ever, resulted in his transfer to the i
ASTP as a 9-L Korean student.
Szezykno, a graduate of the Univer- j
sity of Vilna, Poland, and well- j
known Polish writer, saw his foreign
service in Africa, where he interro
gated German prisoners of war. He |
was also assigned to a prison ship I
which brought German war pris- ,
oners to this country for internment, j
After his graduation from the Uni
versity of Vilna, from which he
holds a 8.A., Szczykno came to New
York City as a Polish exchange stu
dent to N.Y.U. He was studying
journalism at the time of his induc
tion in the Army.
Szczykno is a 9-L Polish student, j
but he speaks four other languages
in addition to Polish.
The third member of this trio of
9-L overseas vets, Dave Totah, spent
16 months in the Aleutians as a
member of the medics.
Born in Arabia, Totah admits he
found the 40 below zero weather of
Alaska a rugged contrast to the 130
above temperatures recorded in his
homeland.
An expert in irrigation, Totah
came to this country to attend Kan
sas State College, from which he
holds a degree in agricultural engi
neering. Totah, an Army veteran of
34 months, has been employed by
American oil companies in irrigation
projects in Arabia. He speaks Ara
bian, French, and English.

The prospect of overseas service
! confronting ASTP students here will
be nothing new for three 9-L lan
guage students of Co. E.
They are Sgt. Tai Hi Lim, Cpl. Jo
seph Szczykno, and Pfc. David S.
! Totah.
I Lim, who wears a bronze star on
I his American defense ribbon, was
i assigned to Schofield Barracks, Ha
j waii, when the Japs pulled their
I sneak attack on Pearl Harbor two
years ago.
For 18 months he served as a
I member of an infantry intelligence
unit. His outfit was charged with
the job of guarding the windward
j side of Oahu Island. Lim holds two
degrees from the University of Ha
waii, where he was a star athlete.
1 He was shipped to this country a i

year ago as a member of a jungle- j
fighting training cadre. His knowl- ;
edge of the Korean language, how- |
ever, resulted in his transfer to the i
ASTP as a 9-L Korean student.
Szezykno, a graduate of the Univer- j
sity of Vilna, Poland, and well- j
known Polish writer, saw his foreign
service in Africa, where he interro
gated German prisoners of war. He |
was also assigned to a prison ship I
which brought German war pris- ,
oners to this country for internment, j
After his graduation from the Uni
versity of Vilna, from which he
holds a 8.A., Szczykno came to New
York City as a Polish exchange stu
dent to N.Y.U. He was studying
journalism at the time of his induc
tion in the Army.
Szczykno is a 9-L Polish student, j
but he speaks four other languages
in addition to Polish.
The third member of this trio of
9-L overseas vets, Dave Totah, spent
16 months in the Aleutians as a
member of the medics.
Born in Arabia, Totah admits he
found the 40 below zero weather of
Alaska a rugged contrast to the 130
above temperatures recorded in his
homeland.
An expert in irrigation, Totah
came to this country to attend Kan
sas State College, from which he
holds a degree in agricultural engi
neering. Totah, an Army veteran of
34 months, has been employed by
American oil companies in irrigation
projects in Arabia. He speaks Ara
bian, French, and English.
