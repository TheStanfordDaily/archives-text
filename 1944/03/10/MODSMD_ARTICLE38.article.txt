# Students, Faculty Mass In Tribute to Founders
## 
### 
Stanford students and faculty crowded the Inner Quad before Memorial
Chapel yesterday in the midmorning sun at 10, joining in the annual
March 9 observance of Founders' Day, the birth anniversary of Governor
Leland Stanford and the 59th anniversary of the signing of an endowment
act authorizing the founding of the University.

While the Stanford band marched
the length of the Quad and played
several selections from 10:05 to 10:15,
the crowd grew until it became al
most too large for the aisles of Me
morial Chapel, The group followed
the University choir members,
clothed in new robes of a light
cardinal shade, into the chapel,
where the national anthem was sung
preceding the services.
Donald B. Tresidder, president of
the University, introduced Chancel
lor Emeritus Ray Lyman Wilbur,
with a few words regarding the
strength given to the University by
the knowledge of the presence of
such a man as Chancellor Wilbur.

''Stanford University started as
an idea in the minds of two pio
neer Americans who thought in
terms of a future largely denied to
(hem by the death of their only
child."
With these words Chancellor
Wilbur opened his Founders' l)a.v
address.
The first year at Stanford opened
without any of the traditions we
know today, said Dr. Wilbur, since
it was from the experience of these
students and faculty and those that
came after them that our traditions
arose.
In enumerating the Stanford tradi
tions, the theme of his speech, Dr.
Willy 1 r said ' that the first one of
all is that of a peculiar loyalty to
Stanford that begins on the day of
registration.
"Out of this tradition has come
what we know as the Stanford Fam
ily' made up of people who have
been associated with the University
â€”some as students, some as faculty,
some as donors and friends of the
University. I think that we can say
that this Stanford Family tradition is
the strongest one we have." the
Chancellor stated.
The traditions most commonly
thought of within the family, accord
ing to Dr. Wilbur, are those of stu
dent self-government and the honor
system. Both of these have come
about through a process of evolution
and both need constant watching if
they are to continue to be examples
of the true spirit of the family.
The Chancellor ended his speech
with a discussion of the other tra
ditions which have been established
through past repeated unfortunate
experiences. Among these were the
regulation against the use of alcohol
in student lodgings and against the
use of liquor advertisements in stu
dent publications, the tradition of
no public initiations, and the request
of Mrs. Stanford for no smoking on
Quad.
' In the days of the corn-cob pipe
and the brown 'roll-your-own' cig
arette there was but little difficulty
in having it given general accept
ance. Now, with the tailor-made
cigarette and with its use also by our
women students, there is a tendency
for this tradition to go up in ciga
rette smoke."
Other traditions mentioned by Dr.
Wilbur were the rule of no hazing of
new students, the "hello" custom, the
meeting of faculty and students out
side the class room, the simple stand
ard of living, and the placing of a
wreath on the Stanford tomb.

Facing the assemblage, the Stan
ford choir presented a special an
them, "How Blest Are They," by
Tchaikowsky, then formed a semi
circle as Dick Driscoll and Luana
Forkner, president and" vice-presi
dent of the student body placed a
white and violet memorial wreath on
the chancel gate in memoriam to the
Stanfords.
Following the Stanford hymn, D.
Elton Trueblood, University chap
lain, offered a prayer of remem
brance and hope for the future of
Stanford University. As the large
gathering of students and faculty left
Memorial Chapel, the carillon began
a 10-minute concert
