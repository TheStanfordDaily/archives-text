"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE
WAY IT GOES"
By Faith Birdwin
(Pamela has consented to go out with Sam
the Sailor, and he shrieks:)
"Oh, rapture! Do you know what we're going
to do? We're going to . . . hire a hansom and
ride around and around the park."
And they did. Soon the clop-clop rhythm of
the horse's hoofs lulled Pamela into a dreamy
fog, and her thoughts went back . . . back to
old Vienna and Count Helmuth.
Oh, those glorious nights in the old beer
garden . . . and Helmuth so handsome with
foam delicately plastering his upper lip.
Those heavenly Balls when Pamela whirred
and whirled in the Count's strong arms, and all
the royalty whispered that she must be some
fairy princess in her original Hink's (adv.) gown.
O Hel, and his husky voice whispering: "Ach
tung! You're scintillating, my little Vienna Sau
sage, scintillating."
No, she would never forget those days in
Vienna and how the Strauss boys told her that
she had inspired them to write "The Blue Dan
ube" and "Oh, You Nazi Man."
Pamela came out of her stupor to find Sam
the Sailor staring at her with wide-eyed admira
tion.
"Yes, she thought to herself, "I must be a
knockout again."
"Hold me close, Sam the Sailor, I'm suddenly
chilled to my very marrow."
Sam did so obligingly, and then, with the aid
of his seafaring eyes, he spotted a lone figure
poised on the edge of the bridge, about to jump
into the mad, seething waters below.
"Stop, you foolhardy silly," yelled Sam, as
he dashed for the figure.
A split second later and a holocaust would
have certainly occurred, but fortunately Sam the
Sailor, with the aid of the valiant and lovely
Pamela, rescued the figure.
A long, soul-tearing shudder went through the
man's body as he lay with his head propped in
Pam's lap. Suddenly he opened his eyes, and
his voice croaked as he shouted:
"It's Pam . . . oh, my God, it's my Pamela."
Pamela looked long and hard at the face on

her lap, and then almost fainted with shock, for
who was this attempted suicide lying here
but . . .

Vienna and how the Strauss boys told her that
she had inspired them to write "The Blue Dan
ube" and "Oh, You Nazi Man."
Pamela came out of her stupor to find Sam
the Sailor staring at her with wide-eyed admira
tion.
"Yes, she thought to herself, "I must be a
knockout again."
"Hold me close, Sam the Sailor, I'm suddenly
chilled to my very marrow."
Sam did so obligingly, and then, with the aid
of his seafaring eyes, he spotted a lone figure
poised on the edge of the bridge, about to jump
into the mad, seething waters below.
"Stop, you foolhardy silly," yelled Sam, as
he dashed for the figure.
A split second later and a holocaust would
have certainly occurred, but fortunately Sam the
Sailor, with the aid of the valiant and lovely
Pamela, rescued the figure.
A long, soul-tearing shudder went through the
man's body as he lay with his head propped in
Pam's lap. Suddenly he opened his eyes, and
his voice croaked as he shouted:
"It's Pam . . . oh, my God, it's my Pamela."
Pamela looked long and hard at the face on

her lap, and then almost fainted with shock, for
who was this attempted suicide lying here
but . . .

"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE
WAY IT GOES"
By Faith Birdwin
(Pamela has consented to go out with Sam
the Sailor, and he shrieks:)
"Oh, rapture! Do you know what we're going
to do? We're going to . . . hire a hansom and
ride around and around the park."
And they did. Soon the clop-clop rhythm of
the horse's hoofs lulled Pamela into a dreamy
fog, and her thoughts went back . . . back to
old Vienna and Count Helmuth.
Oh, those glorious nights in the old beer
garden . . . and Helmuth so handsome with
foam delicately plastering his upper lip.
Those heavenly Balls when Pamela whirred
and whirled in the Count's strong arms, and all
the royalty whispered that she must be some
fairy princess in her original Hink's (adv.) gown.
O Hel, and his husky voice whispering: "Ach
tung! You're scintillating, my little Vienna Sau
sage, scintillating."
No, she would never forget those days in
Vienna and how the Strauss boys told her that
she had inspired them to write "The Blue Dan
ube" and "Oh, You Nazi Man."
Pamela came out of her stupor to find Sam
the Sailor staring at her with wide-eyed admira
tion.
