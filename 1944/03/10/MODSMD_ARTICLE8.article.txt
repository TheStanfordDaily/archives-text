# Campus Opinion
## 
### 
To the Editor:
As a soldier-student attending this Univer
sity, I would like to know what is the general
campus opinion with regard to the wearing of
corsages at formal dances. It has been my.
opinion, and that of guite a few students, that
for the duration of the war corsages were "out." !
I believe this statement was also printed in one
of the advertising circulars of the University.
At several of the universities that I know of
wearing corsages was taboo, and it was en
forced. If any girl came to the dance with one, I
she had to check it at the door. I don't want to
be a wet-blanket, but I would like to have this
situation clarified, and so would guite a few
others.

To the Editor and especially to Miss Janet Hale:
It »is a little difficult to put into words how
deeply we appreciated your contribution to
the March of Dimes.
Palo Alto has a record of which it can be very
proud this year, and we want you to know that
it was your gift that helped to make it possible
to reach the gratifying sum of 51,746 —nearly
twice the amount that was raised last year.
We are happy to tell you that we feel well
prepared to meet any emergency that might
arise this year, and we want you to know that
your money will mean a great deal to some
child—it could very well mean the saving of
that little life.
We are very grateful for your kindness.
Cordially,
March of Dimes Committee
Rhoda M. Franck
Chairman

To the Editor:
I want to thank everyone who worked for I
the Red Cross Drive to make it such a success— i
the committee chairmen, the living group rep
resentatives, The Daily, and each person who
gave to the National Red Cross War Fund.
It is gratifying to accomplish what you set
out to do. We should all feel very proud of
this accomplishment for we have done what,
was required of us, and more.
Thank you for your co-operation.

To the Editor:
If your Gugel would put down his copy of j
"Mein Kampf" long enough, he might be able
to tell when a motion picutre is Fascistic, Com
munistic, pro-Russian, pro-Elizabeth Arden,
good, or just plain bad.
"North Star" was poor, but not for the reasons
so facetiously set forth by your self-styled re
viewer who obviously does not know a pro
jector from a scenario. The redeeming feature
of "North Star" was the music, written by Aaron
Copland; but since your Gugel also claims to
know everything about music, including the
work of the moderns, and since he is biased to
the point of blind rage about the work of the
moderns, he ignored completely the fine score
of "North Star."
This Gugel is apparently one of the stranger
phenomena of the many in this area. He is quite
able to attract attention by himself; The Daily
need not help him by printing his critical aber-!
rations. The Chappie, which is so far gone that
it makes no difference, can take care of that.
