# Coeds Manage Nursery School
## 
### 
The recently instituted nursery
, school which is held during the
morning church service on Sunday
I has been very successful, according
to the school assistants. A dozen or
more children have been put there
each week and have been under the
j care of Stanford coeds.
The nursery, which was inaug
urated last month as an experiment,
is under the guidance of Catherine
Symons. If girls are interested in
working at the nursery may speak
| with Miss Symons or Dr. D. E. True
j blood. It has been requested that all
J children be left at the vestry of the
i church by 10:55 a.m., before the
church service has been started.
