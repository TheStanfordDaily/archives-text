# Action, Please

### 
ONE OF THESE DAYS, and soon, some Stanford
woman is going to be run down by a car right
in front of the post office —rather, by the side
door of the post office.
She leaves her 11 o'clock class, mounts her
bicycle and heads full speed for her morning's
collection of mail. She nears the side steps of
the post office, and after tangling with a couple
of bicycles parked haphazardly in the road
(there are about a dozen), she dashes in.
She walks slowly down the steps, completely
engrossed in a letter from"The One," oblivious
to the elbowings of others rushing past her.
She manages to v/ade through the conglomer
ation ot other bicycles to find her own.
With her eyes still glued to the letter, she
climbs on and shakily and without concentrating
on her actions, pedals forward. A car comes
around the corner.
The driver, confronted with the maze of bi
cycles and women, does slow down. But even
so, he doesn't see the letter-reader, and down
she goes.
Maybe if some of the bike racks were taken
off Quad, where they aren't needed ("stiff fines
levied on Quad cyclists") they could be put
behind or alongside the post office—-where they
are needed—and so Stanford won't be less a
woman student or two.
