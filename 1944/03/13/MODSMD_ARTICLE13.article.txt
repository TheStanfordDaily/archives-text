# But Soon
## 
### 
THE SUN is shining, sulphur and molasses is
much in demand, and the lake is full. Stanford
students are lolling on the Boathouse decks.
Studying goes on, yes, because the Farm, or at
least those members of the Farm with an ounce
of sense in their heads, know that spring at
Stanford no longer means playtime and only
playtime.
But worktime is necessarily accompanied
by moments of playtime, and playtime goes
hand in hand with swimming.
As yet, however, no word has come from the
authorities (Executive Committee) as to just
when lifeguards will be on duty or when the
lake will be available for swimming .
The situation brings to mind the words of a
song, "Soon, Maybe Not Tomorrow, But Soon."
