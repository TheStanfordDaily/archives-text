To the Editor:
In reference to the criticism in last Friday's
Daily, signed under the nom de plume of "Dr.
Johnson," I wish to make the following remarks.
1. Since the article was of a venemous nature,
and since there are two faculty members whose
names are the same as that signed on the letter,
I consider it thoughtless as well as guite unfair
for the writer of the letter to have hidden behind
a name that might be misconstrued to be that
of someone else.
2. Inasmuch as this person, hiding behind a
name of authority, has seen fit at a time when
our country is at war, has, by innuendo and
the use of a carefully worded phrase, guestioned
my political views, I as an American am forced
to publicly state the following:
a. I firmly believe in the American repre
sentative form of government and the principles
for which the Allies are fighting.
b. I consider Fascism, Nazism, and Com
munism as evils, evils in that they are opposed
to democratic ideals, and evils because they
threaten American institutions.
If the author of the letter after reading this
should still guestion my patriotism and would
still want to act as judge, jury, and hangman, I
would suggest that he take the matter up with
the proper authorities. Adolph Gugel, '45.
