One of Stanford's most delectable spots is
the Boathouse. What is even nicer is the fact
that there is a spacious, watery lake to go with
it. And so when the sun starts shining and the
water outgrows the puddle stage, students start
their trek to the Boathouse.
It seems to give one a certain moral boost
to be able to say: "Naw, no hittin' the books
for me .... I'm going to the Boathouse and
bake."
There is, however, an ulterior motive for
going to this luxurious wharf. The feminine half
j are given an opportunity to sport their newest
I sarongs and seduce the local Weismullers. The
; male contingent go to admire the sarongs and
: things, and to flex their sinews and drown their
comrades.
The most prominent Boathouse visitor is the
female, "pass me the Skol and check that
: junior Sterling Hayden" type. She is either
busily getting the benefits of the sun's rays,
keeping a hawk eye on the Haydens, or holding
a decoy Western Civ book on her tanned lap,
and planning how she'll hook the life guard.
Then there is the male sun tan fiend, who
steps on everyone's face screaming, "look at
me .... boy am I ever burned. I'll peel, I know
I will!" He looks like a lobster and is just as
abnoxious.
There are always groups of animated Cul
bertson fans, who 101 l around in various stages
of contortionism, flapping their cards in the
breeze, and shrieking their bids in high-pitched
hilarity. Among these groups are the indi
viduals who must follow the sun in its revolu
tion, and are forever muttering, "let me be
dummy, so my back'll face the sun .... have I
any strap lines? Two no."
Every beach has its acrobat, but the Boat
house offers the canoe daredevil, who gayly
tips over fellow canoeists and jumps up and
down on the floats, kicking up a delightful mess
of dirt and splinters.
The last type of Boathouse enthusiast is the
swimming prankster or "I'm going to duck ya,
I m going to duck ya!" He is always challenging
his buddies to long-winded races, or splashing
pollywog-filled water into gaping mouths.
Yes, the Boathouse is indeed one of Stanford's
most delectable spots, and if you want a sun
tan, bridge game, or a rest, toddle on up. But
remember kiddies, no swimmin' as yet ....
or you'll be punished severely.
