When John Golden of Broadway,
New York, conceived the idea of
putting on original one-act soldier
plays, he must have had his finger
on the G.I. pulse. For, if Friday
night's "Army Play by Play" Me
morial Auditorium audience of ap
proximately 1,300 ASTP. students
can be considered typical, then these
plays are exactly what's needed for
that delicate thing called "morale."
Director David Sievers of the
speech and drama department, and
Assistanat Director Jules (Bud) Irv
ing, as well as the cast and tech
nicians, are all to be congratulated
for the excellent job they have done.
Comedies Preferred
The audience seemed to prefer the
two comedies, "Button Your Lip" and
"Pack Up Your Troubles," over the
serious drama, "Mail Call." In "Pack
Up Your Troubles," the play we con
sidered the best, Bud Irving turned
in a fine job as a nervous expectant
father who tempts a courtmartial by
making a call from an army ware
house to the Lausy (pronounced you
can guess how) Maternity Hospital.
His accomplice in AWOL was also
excellently portrayed by Edward
Costikyan. And Gaynor Gibson, who
played the tough First Sergeant,
rates an advance of five stripes for
his able handling of the role. Robert
Morrison and Herbert Rosenbaum. as
the two Nazi agents, are also worthy
of mention, as is Donald Blub for his
portrayal of the Captain.
Washroom Is Setting
"Button Your Lip," takes place in
a Reception Center "washroom." As
Joe Den by, a veteran of three hours
in the Army, Ed Costikyan turned in
another star performance. Also add
ing to the play's success were Ed
ward Tattershall as the sergeant;
Robert Morrison as the spy-suspect
ing recruit; Edward Anixter and
Herb Booth as two rookies; and Dick
Carter as the Captain.
The third play, "Mail Call," though
not as fast-moving as the other two,
presented several fine performances.
Dick Carter, who played Johnson,
the boy from Aenia, Oklahoma, and
George Vaughn who played Corporal
Luth, the mail clerk who writes to
the family of a buddy who has just
been killed in action, gave two fine
dramatic interpretations.

presented several fine performances.
Dick Carter, who played Johnson,
the boy from Aenia, Oklahoma, and
George Vaughn who played Corporal
Luth, the mail clerk who writes to
the family of a buddy who has just
been killed in action, gave two fine
dramatic interpretations.
When John Golden of Broadway,
New York, conceived the idea of
putting on original one-act soldier
plays, he must have had his finger
on the G.I. pulse. For, if Friday
night's "Army Play by Play" Me
morial Auditorium audience of ap
proximately 1,300 ASTP. students
can be considered typical, then these
plays are exactly what's needed for
that delicate thing called "morale."
Director David Sievers of the
speech and drama department, and
Assistanat Director Jules (Bud) Irv
ing, as well as the cast and tech
nicians, are all to be congratulated
for the excellent job they have done.
Comedies Preferred
The audience seemed to prefer the
two comedies, "Button Your Lip" and
"Pack Up Your Troubles," over the
serious drama, "Mail Call." In "Pack
Up Your Troubles," the play we con
sidered the best, Bud Irving turned
in a fine job as a nervous expectant
father who tempts a courtmartial by
making a call from an army ware
house to the Lausy (pronounced you
can guess how) Maternity Hospital.
His accomplice in AWOL was also
excellently portrayed by Edward
Costikyan. And Gaynor Gibson, who
played the tough First Sergeant,
rates an advance of five stripes for
his able handling of the role. Robert
Morrison and Herbert Rosenbaum. as
the two Nazi agents, are also worthy
of mention, as is Donald Blub for his
portrayal of the Captain.
Washroom Is Setting
"Button Your Lip," takes place in
a Reception Center "washroom." As
Joe Den by, a veteran of three hours
in the Army, Ed Costikyan turned in
another star performance. Also add
ing to the play's success were Ed
ward Tattershall as the sergeant;
Robert Morrison as the spy-suspect
ing recruit; Edward Anixter and
Herb Booth as two rookies; and Dick
Carter as the Captain.
The third play, "Mail Call," though
not as fast-moving as the other two,
presented several fine performances.
Dick Carter, who played Johnson,
the boy from Aenia, Oklahoma, and
George Vaughn who played Corporal
Luth, the mail clerk who writes to
the family of a buddy who has just
been killed in action, gave two fine
dramatic interpretations.
