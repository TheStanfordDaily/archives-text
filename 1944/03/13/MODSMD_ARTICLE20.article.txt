# Roger's Film Dialog Weak

### 
TENDER COMRADE—Now playing
at the Stanford Theater.
"Tender Comrade" proves once
more that the fate of a movie rests
largely upon the shoulders of the

script writer, and
a poor job by the
script writer can
nulify any good
directing or acting
n n 112 ortunate
enough to be in
cluded in the same
opus.
Starring Ginger
Rogers, ihis little
drama attempts to
portray the lives

and lov«»s of five women who share
a house for the duration while their
husbands are in the service. By
means of technically excellent and
fairly well acted flashbacks the
somewhat insipid romance of Miss
Rogers and her soldier husband is
shown.
The type of drama that would do
credit to the imagination of any
high-school sophomore, this play
features little or no plot, and about
as weak dialog as is possible to grind
out.
At one particular low spot, the
housekeeper, who conveniently turns
out to be an educated European ref
ugee with a husband in the Army,
gets in some trite words about ra
tioning and hoarding calculated to
cause a patriotic surge of emotion in
the hearts of all Americans with
I.Q.'s of less than 75. Corman
