Marian Anderson repeated the fine
performance given on the Concert
Series program here when she sang
with the San Francisco Symphony
orchestra last Saturday night.
Miss Anderson was featui'ed in
"Four Serious Songs" by Brahms and
"O Mio Fernando" from La Favorita
by Donizetti. Both numbers were
sung in the original languages, Ger
man and Italian, and Miss Anderson's
accent was above reproach in both.
The symphony, under the direction
of Pierre Monteux, played Beetho
ven's Eighth, the Nocturne and War
like Dance from Ravel's "Daphnis
and Chloe," and the Overture to
Ipegenia in Aulis by Gluck.
Miss Anderson was at her best in
the Negro spiritual "All God's Chil
!un" which she sang as an encore.
All the numbers were given in her
usual faultless style, however.
The orchestra was particularly
good in the Beethoven symphony and
also in "The Psalm" by Diamond,
which was played for the first time
in San Francisco. The latter depicted
vividly the courage and spirit of
Davids' psalms but the hope and
more subdued themes were sub
ordinated more in the music than
they are in the actual words.—Belew
