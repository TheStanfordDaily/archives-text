# Union Chooses Vienna Theme
## 
### 
The people who are expected to
attend Union Unit's formal dance
this Saturday from 9 to 1, will find
themselves in a "Night in Vienna"
from the time they enter the Wom
en's Clubhouse over a soft red carpet
until they finish their last dance be
neath the crystal chandeliers of the
mirrored ballroom, according to
members of the decorations com
mittee.
The ball room upstairs will strive
to duplicate the sumptuous gaiety
that made Vienna the dance cfr.pita!
of Europe; the Bavarian garden
downstairs will be devoted to the
less esthetic, but essential enjoy
ments of punch, sandwiches, anc
cakes for the dancers. Pretzels will
be available on the many tables set
about for the dancers' relaxation.
Fred Dutton's 10-piece orchestra
has been obtained for the event after
his successful performance for La
gunita's dance two weeks ago. Mr.
Dutton will contribute the modern
melodies, while Viennese Waltz
records will set the mood in the re
freshment garden.
