# A 						Sunday Walk
## 
### 
LAST SUNDAY Stanford students took a walk. They walked up
the Row, made a right turn, and alter considerable winding,
ended up at the home of Stanford's president and first lady.
Besides just sitting around talking things over, there were
ping-pong to be played, crossword puzzles to be put together,
and food to be eaten.
Sometimes when persons are placed as leaders of an or
ganization, a large and complicated organization such as Stan
ford University, the members of that organization never have a
chance to know them.
But no so with our leaders. To them the Stanford Family
is a real thing, and to this family they have extended true
hospitality.
