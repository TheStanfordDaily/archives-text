JUST A WORD of praise to Col. John Eden.
When Stanford University was planning the Founders' Day
program it looked doubtful as to whether army students could
attend. But they were permitted to attend.
And now that Stanford is planning a round-up assembly on
Friday morning, army band members will be excused at 10:30 to
get ready for the occasion.
Spirit like this is rare and certainly much appreciated by the
entire Stanford Family.
