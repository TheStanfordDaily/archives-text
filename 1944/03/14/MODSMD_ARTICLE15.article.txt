SOME DAY a campus leader is going to come along who faces
things squarely.
He's going to look at the drinking on campus. After looking,
he'll do something about it.
He's going to once and for all clear up the Honor Code's shaky
application to social phases of campus life; he'll either say "yes,
it does apply," and see that it does, or he'll say "no, it doesn't
apply."
But at any rate, he won't turn his back on things he can't
solve.
Be nice, won't it?
