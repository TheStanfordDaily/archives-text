### JEAN LEVINSON 
POME
The Libe is fun to go and study,
It's full of books and things,
And if you're awful tired buddy,
Snooze till the old bell rings.
The Bender Room is way up high,
You need an Alpine guide,
With oxygen mask you may not die,
But you gotta walk not wide.
The card catalogue is a joy to use,
You bend, and flip and strain,
But your brain you're almost sure to lost,
'Cause someone else's usin' the "race to rain."
The Document Room is musty and still,
It's full of important papers,
There's everything but Dick Tracy's will.
And you're killed if you cut any capers.
The Reference Room's got Encycs and Who's Who,
And thousands of soldiers in khaki,
And little gay girls with bright eyes of blue,
Driving the AST's whacky.
The Periodical Room's got mags by the dozens.
Time, Life, Look, Click and Pic,
You can look at celebs and their crack-brained cousins,
Or read till it makes you sick.
The Libe is one of Stanford's best,
It's fun to go a'chummin,'
But kiddies this ain't no big jest,
Cause finals are a'comin.'
