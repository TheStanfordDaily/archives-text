# Pete, Cellar Standby, Unchanged by War
## 
### GEORGE SPELVIN 
By the time Japan had attacked Pearl Harbor, Pete was already part
of Stanford life, although he had only been at work in the Cellar for three
months. That attack was to change a good many things at the Farm, but
Pete's presence behind the counter, dishing out the cigs with his familiar
grin and a cheerful quip, has caused many a returning Farm serviceman

to breath with relief, "It's still the
same old Farm."
Just as everyone during a typical
day on the Farm reads the Daily,
checks the P. 0.. and walks down
Quad, so does everyone ease through
the Cellar, even if only to dieam
about days of plentiful Hersheys,
bobby-pins, unrationed gum — only
the famous Keesmaafc smile has re
mained the same.
Hails From Amsterdam
Amsterdam is little more than a
memory to Pete; he left 21 years ago.
coming to California via the Panama
Canal. He has lived in California
since 1923, and for 10 years worked
at Thurlow's, a cigar stand next to
the Stanford Theater. Thurlow's
closed in 15)41 and since then Pete
has worked at the Cellar. But per
haps work is the wrong word, for as
Pete describes it.he likes it "very
much."
His quiet voice and personality are
reminiscent of Holland, and with the
presence of many AST's studying
Dutch, and other speakers of Dutch
on campus, Pete has had a chance to
use his native tongue.
Pete docs not have much to say
about the war, the effect it has had
on his supply of goods, the familiar
faces no longer here, but Pete is
known to play his cards rather close
ly. His job keeps him "too busy"
to notice the changes.
Football Enthusiast
About postwar life Pete is more
explicit; although he enjoys the in
formal side of campus life he sees,
football, King of the Sports, will be
welcomed by as great enthusiasm
from a Hollander—Peter Keesmaat —
as it will be the most r*bid native
born.
And when the Big Bed Stanford
Machine moves down the field once
again, just put the binoculars on the
50-yard line—vou'll see Pete.

the famous Keesmaafc smile has re
mained the same.
Hails From Amsterdam
Amsterdam is little more than a
memory to Pete; he left 21 years ago.
coming to California via the Panama
Canal. He has lived in California
since 1923, and for 10 years worked
at Thurlow's, a cigar stand next to
the Stanford Theater. Thurlow's
closed in 15)41 and since then Pete
has worked at the Cellar. But per
haps work is the wrong word, for as
Pete describes it.he likes it "very
much."
His quiet voice and personality are
reminiscent of Holland, and with the
presence of many AST's studying
Dutch, and other speakers of Dutch
on campus, Pete has had a chance to
use his native tongue.
Pete docs not have much to say
about the war, the effect it has had
on his supply of goods, the familiar
faces no longer here, but Pete is
known to play his cards rather close
ly. His job keeps him "too busy"
to notice the changes.
Football Enthusiast
About postwar life Pete is more
explicit; although he enjoys the in
formal side of campus life he sees,
football, King of the Sports, will be
welcomed by as great enthusiasm
from a Hollander—Peter Keesmaat —
as it will be the most r*bid native
born.
And when the Big Bed Stanford
Machine moves down the field once
again, just put the binoculars on the
50-yard line—vou'll see Pete.
