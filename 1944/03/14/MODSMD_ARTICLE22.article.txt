### 
The first School of Public Health
established west of the Mississippi is
now completed on the campus of the
University of California at Berkeley,
it is announced by Pres. Robert G.
Sproul.
The school was set up in answer to
the intensified wartime demand for
well-trained personnel to fill the de
pleted staffs of county health offices
in California and other Western
states, which fear a shortage of fa
cilities for meeting serious public
health dangers.
