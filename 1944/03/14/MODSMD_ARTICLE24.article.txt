## 
### 
The last salvage collection of the ]
quarter will be held next Saturday !
morning, March 18, announced Bar
bara Pike, salvage chairman. Sal
vage representatives will begin today
to collect scrap in their living groups.
Rags, old clothes, paper, tin cans,
inner tubes, and scrap metal are
needed for this drive, and any con-

tributions of these items will be of
great value to the war effort.
Any paper that was not collected
in the paper drive March 4, because
of the rain, will be picked up this
time.
"This is a good time to get rid
of any old clothes you don't want,"
said Miss Pike, "so look in your closet
and see what you can contribute."
