As parents, or prospective parents,
"we must feel a sense of responsi
bility and wonder toward birth," Dr.
D. Elton Trueblood said in his second
sermon of the series on "The Sacra
ments of Lite" at the regular morn
ing service at the Memorial Church
| yesterday.
There is a sense of wonder that
j comes to most people when they be
come parents, said Dr. Trueblood,
| because they realize that God, and
not they, created life. This is one of
the reasons, he continued, that birth
has been associated with the church
and has become a sacrament; it
gives one a sense of God. The great
thing about birth is the "interior
event" of baptism, namely: the re
alization on the part of the family of
their responsibility and of God's
grace.
"A marriage in which children are
not hoped for, "Dr. Trueblood stated,
"is no marriage." Such a "marriage"
; is just self-satisfaction and the easy

way. he said. The tradition, however,
has been to choose the hard way, Dr.
True blood said, and the sense that
great things go together has led peo
ple to bring birth to the church as a
sacrament.
We must view life with reverence
and with realism, Dr. Trueblood con
tinued. We must not become senti
mental about it, for children must lie
disciplined.
