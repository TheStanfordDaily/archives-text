### DICK BLOCK 
The McKinley A five batteld the
rugged group from Monroe Hall, the
Boozers, in a rough-and-tumble bas
ketball game last nipht. Both of the
teams fought well, but the experience
and teamwork ot the A's over
whelmed the Boozers, and they
emerged victorious by a score of 47
to 17.
Tom Martzloff, tall center of Mc-
Kinely, gained control of the ball in
the initial moments of the game. He
followed with a quick pass to Bob
Donohoe under the basket, and the
score was two to nothing. The game
seemed to take on the aspect of be
ing a one-sided affair, with the Mc-
Kinley boys on top. But immediately
after Donohoe's goal. Norm Schieber
of the Boozers streaked down the
court through the entire McKinley
defense, and deposited the ball in the
bucket for a tally of two.
Bob Roantree was fouled soon
after, and connected with his shot
from the charity line to put the
Boozers in the lead by a score of
three to two. Bob Donohoe scored
for the Macs with an unorthodox
hook shot from 30 feet out to the
right of the basket.
The game continued to be static for
the remainder of the first half. Mc-
Kinley had gained sufficient strength
in the closing minutes, and the score
stood 19 to 12 in their favor at the
end of the half.
The second half was a different
story. In spite or many fouls, and
players strewn along the floor like
debris, McKinley scored another 18
points to the Boozers' five. Bob
Donohoe was credited with a total
of 28 points for high honors of the
game.
