## 
### ELLEN MARCUS 
Miss Agnes Howe, now working
' toward the Ph.D. in the Stanford
I speech and drama department, has
been production advisor for "Papa
Is All," the Stanford Players' latest
j production which will open tomor
row night at 8:15 in the Little The
! ater.
I Before coming to Stanford, Miss
Howe taught at Cedar Crest College
! in Allantown, Penn., near the Men
j nonite colony in which the site of
the play is laid. She became very in
! terested in their strange habits and
| customs and took many trips to their
j communities in order to study their
1 way of life.
An Anachronism
j In speaking about these Mennonite
! people who seem like an anachro
j nism in this modern age, Miss Howe
| said, "Down in Lancaster County,
Penn., the Amish and the Mennon
| ites live on the back country roads
just about as their ancestors did
! when Pennsylvania was a wilderness.
"Papa Is All" tells the story of one
of these Mennonite families. Like
I other Mennonite families, Papa
doesn't "feel" for policemen.
Won't Paint Gate
"His daughter, Enuiia. is old

■ enough to be married, but Papa, un
like his neighbors, will not paint his
front gate blue, inviting the young
men to come courting. In fact. Papa
j is more likely to be in ambush with
j his shotgun.
"Papa believes that God created
] the horse wil four legs and a tail for
man's use; and if He had wanted
man to use cars, He would have cre
ated them with four cylinders and a
tail light. Papa gets around the ban
of the church against automobiles by
allowing his son Jake, who is not a
church member as he is under age,
I to own a "Ford-car." According to
the church laws, Papa may ride in
i it without sinning if Jake invites him,
! and if he doesn't pay for the gasoline,
j However, the choleric Papa often
forgets to wait for Jake's invitation,
i but orders the "Ford-car" for his
! own nefarious purposes.
"Tie Cow Loose"
"Papa and his family, like all
Pennsylvania Dutch people, are a
, three language group. They have
Learned German in school and
church, often employ the Dutch dia
' lect in their homes, and have from
necessity learned English. It is
therefore no wonder that Papa sends
Jake to "tie the cow loose." and
Mama savs to a neighbor, "Ach, the

j paper wants rain"; to which the
| neighbor answers. "Yah, it makes
, somesing down like a drizzle."
Jake has quite a bit of trouble
i explaining a sit-down strike to
j Mama, but finally succeeds in clari
fying matters by saying, '"Ach. Mama,
j you have off when you don't want
j off, so sometime you have off always
! when you want it." Poor dominated
; Mama, however, thinks her "off is
j on" as long as she lives with Papa."
1 Papa "Washed Up"
In concluding, Miss Howe guaran-
I teed that Papa was not typical of the
1 ordinary kindly Mennonite fathers;
but his tyrany is such that the whole
family is pleased when Jake reports
j Papa's death by saying that "Papa
I is all," meaning that Papa is all gone,
J all washed up, completely out of the
| picture.

Miss Agnes Howe, now working
' toward the Ph.D. in the Stanford
I speech and drama department, has
been production advisor for "Papa
Is All," the Stanford Players' latest
j production which will open tomor
row night at 8:15 in the Little The
! ater.
I Before coming to Stanford, Miss
Howe taught at Cedar Crest College
! in Allantown, Penn., near the Men
j nonite colony in which the site of
the play is laid. She became very in
! terested in their strange habits and
| customs and took many trips to their
j communities in order to study their
1 way of life.
An Anachronism
j In speaking about these Mennonite
! people who seem like an anachro
j nism in this modern age, Miss Howe
| said, "Down in Lancaster County,
Penn., the Amish and the Mennon
| ites live on the back country roads
just about as their ancestors did
! when Pennsylvania was a wilderness.
"Papa Is All" tells the story of one
of these Mennonite families. Like
I other Mennonite families, Papa
doesn't "feel" for policemen.
Won't Paint Gate
"His daughter, Enuiia. is old

■ enough to be married, but Papa, un
like his neighbors, will not paint his
front gate blue, inviting the young
men to come courting. In fact. Papa
j is more likely to be in ambush with
j his shotgun.
"Papa believes that God created
] the horse wil four legs and a tail for
man's use; and if He had wanted
man to use cars, He would have cre
ated them with four cylinders and a
tail light. Papa gets around the ban
of the church against automobiles by
allowing his son Jake, who is not a
church member as he is under age,
I to own a "Ford-car." According to
the church laws, Papa may ride in
i it without sinning if Jake invites him,
! and if he doesn't pay for the gasoline,
j However, the choleric Papa often
forgets to wait for Jake's invitation,
i but orders the "Ford-car" for his
! own nefarious purposes.
"Tie Cow Loose"
"Papa and his family, like all
Pennsylvania Dutch people, are a
, three language group. They have
Learned German in school and
church, often employ the Dutch dia
' lect in their homes, and have from
necessity learned English. It is
therefore no wonder that Papa sends
Jake to "tie the cow loose." and
Mama savs to a neighbor, "Ach, the

j paper wants rain"; to which the
| neighbor answers. "Yah, it makes
, somesing down like a drizzle."
Jake has quite a bit of trouble
i explaining a sit-down strike to
j Mama, but finally succeeds in clari
fying matters by saying, '"Ach. Mama,
j you have off when you don't want
j off, so sometime you have off always
! when you want it." Poor dominated
; Mama, however, thinks her "off is
j on" as long as she lives with Papa."
1 Papa "Washed Up"
In concluding, Miss Howe guaran-
I teed that Papa was not typical of the
1 ordinary kindly Mennonite fathers;
but his tyrany is such that the whole
family is pleased when Jake reports
j Papa's death by saying that "Papa
I is all," meaning that Papa is all gone,
J all washed up, completely out of the
| picture.
