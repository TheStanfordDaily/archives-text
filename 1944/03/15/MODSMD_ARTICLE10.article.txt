## 
### 
The Li'l Indian Cartoon Books
Hill be sold Friday at the Post
Office. Cellar, and History Corner,
according to Kay Hammond, busi
ness manager of the Daily, who
wishes to remind all students of
the sale.
The books will have no adver
tising, but will be filled with comic
cartoons of the life of a typical
Stanford rough from snappy cover
to cover. The price will be 15
cents, and as the business staff has
issued a statement saying that the
books will be better than anything
yet published on campus, many
people will want to spend an addi
tional nickel for an envelope suit
able for mailing overseas.
