FIRST the Marshalls, then the Carolines —then the Marianas.
Japan's mid-Pacific outposts blocking the road to Tokyo have
become major targets for task forces of the U.S. Navy.
The Marianas, latest to feel the Navy's far-reaching power,
are a group of 15 volcanic islands fringed with coral reefs, says
the National Geographic Society. They are strung along a gen
eral north-south axis for 500 miles, between Japan and the Caro
lines. Uracas, active island-volcano at their northern end, is
1,100 air miles south of Tokyo.
Objectives of the raid on the Marianas were the islands of
Saipan, believed to have several air fields, and Tinian, credited
with a naval air base. Should a landing be made in force by
infantrymen on these islands, our occupation would effectively
neutralize the entire chain, except for Guam, which lies at the
southern end.
