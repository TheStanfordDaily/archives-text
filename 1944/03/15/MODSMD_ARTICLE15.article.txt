# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
Disappointment reigned at the "Tillson Talkies" last Sunday '
night as many students on the campus can undoubtedly testify.
Not only did the program fail to show the fourth intensely grip
ping chapter of "Darkest Africa," but the main feature was in
terrupted many times, leaving the audience in a mad frenzy to
learn the outcome of William Holden's adventures with Jean
Arthur.
During the daytime scenes it appeared to be dusk and during
evening scenes it appeared to be a blackout. The sound could
also be improved along with the light.
It would seem that there could be some way of improving
the programs without getting involved in a lot of expense. Would
it be possible to take one night's profits and have the projector
overhauled? If, however, the University feels extravagant it
might buy a larger projector if war priorities permitted.
Sincerely, A Tillson Talkie Enthusiast.

To the Editor:
I think the idea of a music listening room has been a very
splendid one; however, it has become little more than an idea
for us G.l.'sâ€”yes, the thought of our being able to listen to '
beautiful music thrills us, but we don't have any opportunities ;
to go there.
The room is open five or six hours each day, but we haven't
enough free time during this schedule. How about opening be
tween 9:30 and 10:30 in the evening?
Sincerely yours, Henry Miranda, Co. F.

To the Editor:
Palo Alto Area Chapter in general, and its Red Cross War
Fund Committee in particular, would like to place on record their
appreciation of the remarkable achievement of the Stanford stu
dent body in over-subscribing the Red Cross guota set by them
selves and reaching a high-water mark in campus Red Cross
collection. The campaign was student-organized, student-pub
licized and decorated, and handicapped in advance by following
on the heels of a strenuous war-bond drive, and by the fact that
much of the present student body wears uniform, and therefore
cannot be approached for contribution. Volunteer giving by the
soldiers was nevertheless generous, and helped the campaign
greatly. The chapter and the committee contributed little but
surprise and admiration. They do not extend thanks, since Red
Cross people do not stop to thank each other, but they do tender
their congratulations.
As campus population shifts residence so frequently, students,
graduates, faculty, or administrative people renting rooms,
apartments, or cottages may have not been approached for con
tributions. Anyone overlooked who wishes to give is asked to
bring his donation to the office of Lee Yancey, Chief Accountant,
Administration Building, Room 167. If such donors are students,
their gift will be added to the student total on the record.
Dare Stark McMullin,
Public Relations Chairman.
