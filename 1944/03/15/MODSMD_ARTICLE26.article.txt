# Eye Research Told by Hecht
## 
### 
Dr. Selig Hecht, professor of bio
physics at Columbia University,
spoke on the subject "Energy and
Vision" Monday night in a lecture
sponsored by Sigma Xi, national
science honor society. The lecture
was held in the Education Audito
rium.
In his lecture, Dr. Hecht discussed
the answer to the question "How
much light energy do we need in
order to see?" He first told the his
tory of science's attempts to answer
this question, beginning with the ex
periments of S. P. Langley in 1889.
Next Dr. Hecht described the highly
accurate methods which he and his
colleagues have used in determining
the minimum amount of light energy
necessary for vision.
After extensive research, it has
been shown that from 54 to 148
quanta (a quantum being the small
est opssible unit of light energy)
must reach the eye in order that
light may be perceived. Only about
half of these get through the eye to
the retina, and not more than 20
per cent of the quanta which reach
the retina arc absorbed by the visual
purple and transmitted to the brain
as nervous impulses.
Thus it may be concluded that the
absolute minimum of light energy
(acting on the visual purple) neces
sary for vision is five quanta.
Through natural selection, the value
of this minimum in man has been
pushed down to the very lowest
possible limits.
