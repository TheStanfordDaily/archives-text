### 
LONDON, March 14 (UP)â€”Prime
Minister Winston Churchill told the
House of Commons today that the
travel ban between Ireland and
Britain was only the first step to iso
late Southern Ireland from the outer
world, and it was indicated that new
and drastic measures were imminent
to protect Allied lives from Axis
spies in Eire.
Rigid restriction of normal travel
between Southern and Northern Ire
land, partial or complete stoppage of
sea communication with Eire and an
embargo on Allied supplies of coal,
oil, wheat, and other necessities now
sent to Southern Ireland were among
the measures discussed as possible or
likely.
