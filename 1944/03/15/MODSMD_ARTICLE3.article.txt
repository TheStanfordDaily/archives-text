LONDON, Wednesday, March 15 (UP) —German raiders last night prob
ably made their biggest fire attack on London since the 1940 battle of
Britain, showering hundreds of incendiary bombs and some high ex
plosives on the capital in a concentrated assault that lasted more than an
hour.
It was estimated that the number of fire bombs rained on the inner city

•exceeded those dropped in Febru
ary's "baby fire blitz."
Observers said the number of Nazi
planes appeared comparable to those
that penetrated the city's inner de
fenses in the heaviest of the Febru
ary series of fire raids when more
than 100 planes headed for London.
Then only a small number actually
reached the center of the capital.
A number of persons were re
ported trapped in one London dis
trict after a high explosive bomb fell.
One German plane crashed in
flames in an outer London district,
after the raiders were met by a
thunderous anti-aircraft barrage.
