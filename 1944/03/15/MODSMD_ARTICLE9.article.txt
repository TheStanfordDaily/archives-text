# Farm Players Present 'Papa Is All' Tonight
## 
### 
With all remaining rough spots
smoothed out by dress rehearsals,
the Stanford Players will present the
first performance of their newest
production, Patterson Greene's "Papa
is All," tonight at 8:15 in the Little
Theater.
"Papa Is All" is the story of a
Pennsylvania Dutch mother, daugh
ter, and son who rebel against their
tyrranical father. Mania and Papa
Aukamp are of the Mennonite re
ligion; the son and daughter, exer
cising the privilege that is part of
the Mennonite faith, have not adopt
ed it. They remain, in local par
lance, "worldly," until they feel the
call to become "plain," or Mennonite.
Papa misuses his religion for pur
poses of his own by forbidding his
children the simple pleasures and
recreations of everyday life, to which
Mama, an authentic Mennonite, has
no objection. Papa also opposes all
associations with neighbors and tries
to keep his children, Emiha and Jake,
in isolation chiefly because they are
good workers whom he would have
to replace with hired help.
Comical Tragedy
How Emma and Jake, with the
help of Mama and their neighbor,
Mrs. Yoder, who keeps the family
supplied with the local gossip, step
out from under their father's thumb
supplies the plot for this entertain -

ing, half-comedy, half-tragic folk
tale.
Featured in the play are Atha Hill
back, who played the mother in
"Young Man of Today," as the long
suffering Mama, and Harlen Adams,
acting assistant professor of speech
and drama, as the dominating Papa.
Stanford students Margaret Morgan
and Duane Heath will play Emma
and Jake, respectively.
Rattled-Brain Woman
Jean Levinson will be seen as Mrs.
Yoder, a cheery, middle-aged, but
rather rattled-brain woman who is
the Aukamp's only visiting neighbor.
Irving Abrams will be seen as State
Trooper Brendle who finally shows
Papa that the law is stronger than
he is.
Assisting Strickland with the di
recting is Jean Robinson. Mrs.
Grace Sollers is in charge of props,
assisted by Mamy Jones and Charles
Smurr. Moofie Faris will handle
lights, assisted by Candy Taylor and
Anne Wendling. Margaret Morgan
is in charge of costumes and helping

cising the privilege that is part of
the Mennonite faith, have not adopt
ed it. They remain, in local par
lance, "worldly," until they feel the
call to become "plain," or Mennonite.
Papa misuses his religion for pur
poses of his own by forbidding his
children the simple pleasures and
recreations of everyday life, to which
Mama, an authentic Mennonite, has
no objection. Papa also opposes all
associations with neighbors and tries
to keep his children, Emiha and Jake,
in isolation chiefly because they are
good workers whom he would have
to replace with hired help.
Comical Tragedy
How Emma and Jake, with the
help of Mama and their neighbor,
Mrs. Yoder, who keeps the family
supplied with the local gossip, step
out from under their father's thumb
supplies the plot for this entertain -

ing, half-comedy, half-tragic folk
tale.
Featured in the play are Atha Hill
back, who played the mother in
"Young Man of Today," as the long
suffering Mama, and Harlen Adams,
acting assistant professor of speech
and drama, as the dominating Papa.
Stanford students Margaret Morgan
and Duane Heath will play Emma
and Jake, respectively.
Rattled-Brain Woman
Jean Levinson will be seen as Mrs.
Yoder, a cheery, middle-aged, but
rather rattled-brain woman who is
the Aukamp's only visiting neighbor.
Irving Abrams will be seen as State
Trooper Brendle who finally shows
Papa that the law is stronger than
he is.
Assisting Strickland with the di
recting is Jean Robinson. Mrs.
Grace Sollers is in charge of props,
assisted by Mamy Jones and Charles
Smurr. Moofie Faris will handle
lights, assisted by Candy Taylor and
Anne Wendling. Margaret Morgan
