# Gay Vienna Union Ball
## 
### 
From the spotlighted fountain
i playing in Union Patio to the smooth
| melodies of Fred Dutton's orchestra
i playing in the suavely gay Viennese
; ballroom, women of Union Unit and
j their friends anticipate "A Night in
i Vienna" at their formal dance in
! the Women's Clubhouse Saturday
evening.
Much of the authentic detail of the
| European waltz capital's sumptuous
ballrooms is being simulated pains
takingly by the decorations commit
tee which reports marble pillars,
shimmering crystal chandeliers, wall
j mirrors to reflect the dancers' move
j ments, and plush tapestries and
1 drapes all rapidly nearing comple
' tiori for the dance.
The disappearing blue and silver
| bids are on sale to women of the
! unit and to their friends at $1.75 a
! couple in the lobby of Union Resi
! dence and through agents in each of
I the houses.
Refreshments for the dancers will
! be served downstairs in the Ba
j varian garden where gaily checked
tablecloths will cover the tables for
| dancers relaxing not far from the
j bowls of pretzels, also in the best
j Viennese fashion.
| Fred Dutton's orchestra is plan
: ning an evening of "sweet" music
I and the intermissions will feature
waltz music from the piano.
Mrs. Doiothy Tibbey, hostess of the
Women's Clubhouse will be one of
j the patrons of the dance.
