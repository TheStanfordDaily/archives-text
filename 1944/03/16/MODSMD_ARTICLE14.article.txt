"AMOUR AMOUR OR THAT'S THE WAY IT GOES"
By Faith Birdwin
(Pamela looked long and hard at the face en her lap, and then 1
almost fainted with shock, for who was this attempted suicide
lying here but . . . .)
"Geoffrey!"
It couldn't be, but it was, Pam's very first love. His six-feet
two of beige gabardine was now dank and muddy; his lean, ;
hard face was drawn and haggard. He was a mess.
"Geoffrey, ijnagine doing a swan-dive at this time of night.!
Silly billy." ,
Geff's gray eyes turned black in anger. "You deceived me,
you little . . .
"No, no Geoffrey. Do not use harsh words against me, poor 1
little me. Why, oh why are you mad?"
"I returned from two days at the front, to find you out with
other men. What was left for me but the peace and quiet of
Death."
Pamela turned tearful, El Greco blue eyes on him and with
the humbleness of her seventeen years said: "Sorry."
That s okay, but now that I've found you I'm never going
to let you out of my sight. You get what I mean, don't you, :
little Orchid?"
"You mean you want we should get tied up in the bonds:
of matrimony- No, no, no!"
Geoffrey gnashed his hard, white teeth and sneezed.
"God bless you!"
"Never mind trying to be kind to me. I don't want your
sympathy, I want you, you bundle of beautious burlap."
Pamela took a long breath and heaved .... her chest in con-1
sternation. This was it, truly it.
"Geoffrey be patient with me. I know so little of life. I want
to see the world before I settle down to putter about the house.;
Can't you see. Are you so blind?"
"But what will you do Pamela? You're so fine, and innocent
and helpless. What will you do?"
"I am going to Palo Alto, California."
"And what will you do there?"
Pamela paused for a brief moment and then blurted out her j
decision for the future.
I am going to attend the University of Stanford and become ,
a hygiene major. I will work at the Injun Drivein for my tuition.
Goodbye."
The inky blackness of night faded away, and a glorious dawn
rose in the far horizon. Pamela walked slowly down the path,'
as the birth of a new and beautiful day came to greet her. Life
Can Be Beautiful!

Pamela took a long breath and heaved .... her chest in con-1
sternation. This was it, truly it.
"Geoffrey be patient with me. I know so little of life. I want
to see the world before I settle down to putter about the house.;
Can't you see. Are you so blind?"
"But what will you do Pamela? You're so fine, and innocent
and helpless. What will you do?"
"I am going to Palo Alto, California."
"And what will you do there?"
Pamela paused for a brief moment and then blurted out her j
decision for the future.
I am going to attend the University of Stanford and become ,
a hygiene major. I will work at the Injun Drivein for my tuition.
Goodbye."
The inky blackness of night faded away, and a glorious dawn
rose in the far horizon. Pamela walked slowly down the path,'
as the birth of a new and beautiful day came to greet her. Life
Can Be Beautiful!

(Pamela looked long and hard at the face en her lap, and then 1
almost fainted with shock, for who was this attempted suicide
lying here but . . . .)
"Geoffrey!"
It couldn't be, but it was, Pam's very first love. His six-feet
two of beige gabardine was now dank and muddy; his lean, ;
hard face was drawn and haggard. He was a mess.
"Geoffrey, ijnagine doing a swan-dive at this time of night.!
Silly billy." ,
Geff's gray eyes turned black in anger. "You deceived me,
you little . . .
"No, no Geoffrey. Do not use harsh words against me, poor 1
little me. Why, oh why are you mad?"
"I returned from two days at the front, to find you out with
other men. What was left for me but the peace and quiet of
Death."
Pamela turned tearful, El Greco blue eyes on him and with
the humbleness of her seventeen years said: "Sorry."
That s okay, but now that I've found you I'm never going
to let you out of my sight. You get what I mean, don't you, :
little Orchid?"
"You mean you want we should get tied up in the bonds:
of matrimony- No, no, no!"
Geoffrey gnashed his hard, white teeth and sneezed.
"God bless you!"
"Never mind trying to be kind to me. I don't want your
sympathy, I want you, you bundle of beautious burlap."
Pamela took a long breath and heaved .... her chest in con-1
sternation. This was it, truly it.
