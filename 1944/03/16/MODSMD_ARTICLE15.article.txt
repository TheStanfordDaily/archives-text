In answer to Pfc. Miranda's letter, concerning the Music,
Listening Lounge, we have found that we will be able to keep'
the room open from 9:30 to 10:30 each night if the soldiers are
willing to staff it during that time. Colonel Eden has assured us
that it is perfectly all right for soldiers to come to the Listening!
Lounge during their free hours, and, if they have signed out
with their companies from 9:30 to 10:30 also. If we find that this !
arrangement is what the soldiers want, Room 15 in the Old'
Union will remain optn 9:30 to 10:30 each weekday night, in!
t'ddition to the regular hours, 1 to 8 p.m.
Sincerely,
The Music Committee. !
