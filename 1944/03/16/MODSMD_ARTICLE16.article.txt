# Music Lovers Give Concert
## 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
Featuring works which varied \
from Haydn down to a composition
of the 20th century, the Music Lovers j
Society of San Francisco presented a ;
program of chamber music at the i
Tuesday Evening Series last night, j
The Trio for violin, viola, and 'cello i
by the modern French composer,
Jean Francaix, is not a very profound ,
work but proved listenable and j
rather catchy. The Andante was
much in the style of Satis and like !
the opening movement, requires the
performers to use mutes. The con
cluding rondo was like a second !
scherzo and brought the work to a i
spirited end. The performance was ;
excellent.
The program opened with the Trio I
in Ca Major for piano, violin, and
cello by Joseph Haydn which was j
fairly well played although the per
formance was somewhat brittle at '
times.
Haydn's trios are not nearly as well
known as his quartets and deserve to
appear on programs more often than
they do.
The Brahms Piano Quartet in A
Major was the concluding work of
the evening and the performance was
not too convincing.
The Music Lovers' Society, which
was founded in 1933 by Margaret
Tilly, specializes in unusual and
seldom-heard works.
The program was presented under
the auspices of the Committee of
Public Exercises and the Friends of
Music at Stanford.
