# Dance Lesson Set For Army Tonight
## 
### 
The third in the present series of
army dancing lessons will be held
this evening from 9:.")0 to 10:15 in
the back door of the Art Gallery.
Students can enter through the door
facing the Memorial Auditorium.
This is the next to last lesson of the
series, but it is hoped that more can
be offered in the Spring Quarter.
All army students are welcome, even
if they have not attended the former
lessons.
Coeds interested can sign in the
War Board office to be dancing
partners. In some living groups they
will find lists posted on their bulletin
boards for them to sign.
Cathy Hauser and Dick Leon will
again be instructors, and Peggy
Deering will be the accompanist.
