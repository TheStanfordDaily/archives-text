# Nitery Program
## 
### 
Dancing, entertainment, and re
freshments promise fun for everyone
who comes to the Nitery on Friday
night, according to Barbara Porter,
secretary of the Freshman "Y." It's
a St. Patrick's Day celebration and
the Freshman "Y" is hostessing.
According to Miss Porter, date and
no-date guests are invited to the
dance which will be strictly informal.
And soldiersâ€”in case you're inter
ested, at least 45 girls will be there
to aid in the good time as hostesses.
