The I)ail_v is nearing the end of its
last week of publication for the
quarter, which means that it's ahout
time for a review ol the quarter's
happenings in the world of sports.
Winter Quarter, for the first time i
in the memory of the present gen- |
eration of students, found Stanford
without a basketball team in 1944.
Like so many other current incon
veniences, this one may be charged
up to ihe war.
Stanford would undoubtedly have
had a top-notch team had it not
been for the war. Jim Pollard, the
present-day successor to Luisetti |
(though Hank seems to be doing all j
ght, himself) would have played |
..is third season of varsity basketball
for Stanford in 1944 if he were still
here. Instead, Pollard played for
ward for the Coast Guard Sea Lions, j
Howie Dailmar, ace guard who was |
voted the most valuable player in the
finals of the 1942 NX'.A.A. cham
pionships, would also have been a j
senior at Stanford this year. Howie
spent the last part of the season with
the St. Mary's Preflighters.
Babe Higgins and George Jones |
both started for the California Bears !
during the 1944 season. Higgins was !
one of the forwards on the all-South
ern Division team picked by the
coaches, while Jones, who played j
center and guard, made the second j
squad. They are enrolled in the col
lege programs of the Marines and
Navy, respectively. Both would prob
ably have been on the Indian varsity
this season had it not been for the j
war.
Add to these the names of Dave I
Brown and Jack Heald, forward and I
center on UCLA's first string, and
guard Bones Halstead, who is still
on the Farm, and you have an A-l
nucleus for a championship squad
that might have been. As the old
saying goes, "C'est la gyerre" (which
translated means "things are tuffall
over").

Johnny Fulton, Stanford's ace
middled istance runner, took a leave |
of absence for the quarter, and com
eted in the Eastern indoor track
season under the colors of the Olym
pic Club. He became a great favor
ite of the fans by winning races as
000 and 1,000 yards in his first two
attempts. He found the going a hit
rough in his next outs, and has final
ly been forced to withdraw due to an
infected toe.
