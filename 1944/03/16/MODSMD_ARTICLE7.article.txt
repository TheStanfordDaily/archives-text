## 
### 
ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) â€” 1
Cassino was demolished today by
American airpower, and tonight Al
lied infantry supported by tank-: |
fought through the flaming, smoking
rubble of the town against German i
snipers and machine gunners who
had miraculously survived the great
test aerial attack of the war.
American and British ground i
troops moved into what was last of !
the stubbornly defended town after 1
the full might of the U.S. air forces 1
in the Mediterranean was turned j
loose on the objective, beginning just j
after daybreak today.
A front dispatch from United Press I
Correspondent Dana Schmidt said
that the troops had driven through j
most of the town and that the ruin i
of the castle on the slope of Monte >
Cassino at the rear of the town also |
wits occupied by Allied soldiers.
The town, ripped asunder by the ;

waves of American Flying For
tresses. Liberators, and other types
of bombers, also was under an in
| tense artillery attack before the in
j fantry and tanks moved forward.
What few walls the aerial attack had
; left standing were flattened by the
barrage.
As the American troops advanced
. through the rubble they met dazed
! but desperate Germans who crawled
; out of underground pillboxes and
' caverns firing any arms they could
I lay their hands on. Engineers clear
' ing a path for tanks through the
debris had to lay down their picks
j and shovels and fight off suicidal
Nazi charges.
