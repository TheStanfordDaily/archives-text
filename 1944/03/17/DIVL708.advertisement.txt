Nenette and Rintintin
JIM;
Originally Good Luck charms made if
Paris of wool or silk thread in 191S
Everybody wore them, and children
huggged their doll charms during heavy
shelling of Paris.
For luck this year Trifari makes Nenette
and Rintintin of sterling silver, gold
plated, and colored cabochons and rhine
stones. SI 0.00 each.
