# 'Papa Is All' Termed Mature Production
## 
### 
The Little Theater production of
"Papa Is AH" continues its five
dav run tonight, tomorrow night,
and Monday night. And it is a
production maturely done.
How the cast learned to ripple off
the Pennsylvania Dutch phraseology
j and inflection, causes wonderment
I only.
Altha Hillbaek's interpretation of
i Mama Aukamp is thorough and con-
J sistent. And you will probably not
I soon be seeing again such a holy
terror on the stage as Harlen Adams
playing Papa, who is bearded, club
footed, "old, ugly, and dirty.'"

Then as Mrs. Yoder there is the
Levinson: no tricks of the theater
have been discovered which are not
in the repertoire of the Levinson.
Margaret Morgan's dramatic per
formance is contrasted by the more
restrained acting of Duane Heath.
And for the state trooper, you could
not expect better than Irving Ab
rams, who plays it.
Patter<on Green's comedy is fairly
simple; it calls for but one set and
six characters; its plot is well con
structed.
No one would be inclined to tire
of the John Sollers set or of Muriel
Lievsay's costumes.â€”Cyclone Covey
