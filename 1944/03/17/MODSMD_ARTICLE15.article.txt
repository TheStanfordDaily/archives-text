In all probability the invasion of
Europe will come during spring guar
ter; but, although the winning of the
war is the most important .public issue
which confronts us, there are several
major issues to which we must give as
much attention as the conduct of the
war. If these other issues are left un
solved, or unattended, the war will have
been fought in vain.
These issues are inflation, post-war
international co-operation, race rela
tions and the problems of minority
groups in the United States, labor-man
agement relations, the elections of 1944,
and the demobilization of troops.
The magnitude and complexity of
these problems is readily apparent, but
their difficulty must not prevent them
from being brought before the public.
In the final analysis only "Doctor Pub
lic," not "Doctor New Deal" or "Doctor
Win the War," can cure the ills of the
nation. At this time, however, it is
appropriate only to mention a few fac
tors involved in each of the above prob
lems.
The immediate wartime controls of
wages and prices will probably keep
down the cost of living and combat in
flation successfully. But the agencies
which administer the controls are under
increasing pressure from various power
ful groups—the machinery must be al
lowed to stand.
Postwar inteinational co-operation
must depend upon the extent to which
the public has been educated during
the war to the necessity of abandoning
our traditional isolationism, and also
the extent to which we are familiar with
the national problems, cultures, and
political identities of other nations.
Face relations, the minority problems
of the Negroes and the Jews, for ex
ample, will present clearly to observ
ers the conflict between liberals in the
United States, and those well - estab
lished elements of our population who
are determined not to yield to argument
or reason. What effect the war will have
on an increase in economic and politi
cal opportunities for Negroes is yet to
be determined. Many Negroes are no
longer willing to accept without gues
tion the status assigned them in the
South. They will either stay in the
South and fight, which seems unlikely
because they always lose, or more
likely they will concentrate in urban
areas. Full public attention must also
be given the problems of Japanese re
settlement, and growing anti-Semitism.
Differences between labor and man
agement may not become acute pro
viding there is no return of large-scale
unemployment. Should unemployment
gather momentum in the conversion
from war production to peace produc
tion, management must be prevented
from taking advantage of the labor mar
ket to upset the wages and hours and
living conditions of workers. Yet labor
must be prevented from exploiting pri
vate capital in order to do this. Fur
ther government regulation of the re
lations of management and labor may
be the answer to such problems.
The 1944 election will be merely for
Roosevelt or against Roosevelt.
The federal concept of establishing a

j commission to funnel men into civilian
life is encouraging. Certainly worthy
ex-servicemen should be helped to get
jobs or continue interrupted educa
tion. As yet it is too early to determine
whether or not returning service men
will form a potent political bloc, for
many discharged men have not shown
much interest in joining established vet
erans' groups.
These issues are real, and are be
fore us. It is the duty of soldier and
civilian alike to aid the public discus
sion of such problems. To reach the
solutions of our problems only the dem
ocratic process will serve.
And it takes all kinds.— Dave Davis
