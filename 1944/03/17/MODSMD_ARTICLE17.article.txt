Being head of War Board is rather
like being a policeman. Everybody
needs you and nobody loves you.
There is always somebody hollering
"Get Stanford out of its Ivory Tower,"
"Don't you know there's a WAR going
on?" and "Why don't we DO some
thing?"
But when it comes to getting them to
do it, that's a horse of another flavor.
Then the crowd roars, "We got too
much to do already," "Why don't they
get a machine to roll these things," or
"I'm absolutely flat, I tell you."
In the face of all these odds Carol
Hurwitz has done a good job guietly
and, hardest of all, done it and made
friends not enemies. So here's to you,
Carol, our heartiest congratulations.—
