When a man's just back of the front
lines in Italy or stationed at some Alas
kan outpost miles from the kind of life
he knows, or even if he's just fighting
the battle of Camp Bowie, he likes
music. He likes to make it himself—
on a trumpet, sax, or clarinet, or maybe
even a ukulele.
Or if he's not musically inclined, he
likes to listen to his buddies do the
playing.
The point is that fighting men like
and need music. And the Coca-Cola
Co. will see that they get musical in
struments. And we'll see that the
Coca-Cola Co. will have some instru
ments to give them. Just leave them at
the Nitery cr the gas station.
