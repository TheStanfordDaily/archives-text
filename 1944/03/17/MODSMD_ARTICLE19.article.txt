# A 						Wee Note of Wisdom

It's funny about the boathouse.
Whenever there's going to be a meet
ing about race relations or a well-in
formed speaker plans to give us some
knowledge on "Conditions in Ger
many," The Daily has to run several
articles on the subject.
Without extensive advance publicity,
the chances of drawing an audience
over 12 persons would be slight.
But the lake! Now that's a different
story.
The Daily has carried one article
about the opening of the lake and boat
house. That's all there was to the ad
i vance publicity on this event.
But nobody's worrying about the
turnout. By 12:55 this afternoon, the
hordes will be rushing to get a good
! seat.
That's fine. Spirit is what we like to
see. But we might all be wise and
remember a certain series of events
which begins exactly a week from
Wednesday.
