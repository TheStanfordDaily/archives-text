And a Movie Enthusiast:
I too must admit that I was disap
pointed in not being able to see Dark
est Africa last Sunday night, but the
film was delayed in shipping and failed
to arrive. My apologies to the happy
, group that convened to see it, and I
i assure that we will try and not have
it happen again ... As to the projector,
well, things are rough, and unfortu
nately the fault seems to be with the
films themselves, which are of an early
vintage when the miracles of modern
■ science had not perfected the camera,
lights, script writers, and actors . . .
Also to friend with suggestion about
Dibble Hospital, thank you. Plans have
been made and the Red Cross con
tacted, so we will probably troop over
there sometime next week . . . For
your information the Stanford Players
and Ram's Head members in the last
year have entertained the boys at:
Page Mill, Moffett Field, Belmont,
Gilroy, Del Monte, San Carlos and Let
terman Hospital. How's that for a rec
ord? I might add we found them very
responsive and had lots of fun (even
rode there in an Army truck). So watch
out, Dibble, 'cause here we come!
