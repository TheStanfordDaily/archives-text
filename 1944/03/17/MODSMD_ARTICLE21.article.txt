A group of peppy Stanford women—
203 of them—made the Y.W.C.A. meet
ing Wednesday night one of the most
constructive this campus has seen in
guite some time.
Some of the highlights:
When Rosemary Cross said that the
true importance of being a Stanford
bred woman wasn't realized until a
woman left Stanford. When a woman
goes out in the world and shows that
the Fundamental Standard is a real part
of her character and not just a code
she upheld while at Stanford—that is
the important thing.
When Dr. Tresidder in the most gra
cious manner possible, and without the
air of a preacher and without hedging,
gave those present a few straight-from
the-shoulder suggestions about each
individual's consideration of a code of
morals.
