# Poison Oak Cases Fill Rest Homes
## 
### 
Poison oak cases have increased
| to the extent that a campus war !
against it has become necessary, ac- |
| cording to Dr. Lois P. Todd, exam- i
j ining physician of the Women's
. Health Service. j
Since the poison oak season is at i
its height and the manpower short- j
age prevents its removal from cam
| pus areas, students should learn to
recognize and avoid the plant. Dr.
Todd said. Rest homes and the hos
| pital are filled to capacity.
; AlO per cent sodium perborate in !
> cold cream may be procured at tne {
Health Service offices or at drug
i stores as a preventive. This cream
i resembles sunburn creams and lo- \
i tions and is applied to exposed sur- !
; faces. Only one preventive should j
: be used at a time, Dr. Todd cautions, |
! because two often counteract against !
each other and lose effectiveness.
