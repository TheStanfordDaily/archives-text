Lo and behold!—the last issue
:>f tlie Daily tor this quarter has
rolled around. A lew weeks ago,
most ol us would have sworn on
any number of Bibles that we'd he
far from Stanford two days past
the Ides of March. But here we
are.
Of course, it seems certain (at
.east if you believe the article else
where on this page) that most of us
won't be walking on Quad next
quarter. Instead, we'll be out hup
iwo-thre-four-ing for real again.
We'll be out there doing a lot of
things. And in a lot of places. And
whether or not we want to admit it
now, we know there'll be a lot of
times in a lot of places when we'll
iook back at this brief interval at
Stanford and say:
Thanks for the Memory
Yes, we're almost positive it'll be
hard to forget the Farm—the open
houses the sorority and women's
hall gals gave .... the Sunday aft
ernoon picnics .... the big dances,
even without the big bands: the
Soph Cotillion, the Lagunita, Roble,
and Union formals .... the more
recent days at that lake we had
heard about for so long .... the
cigarette-less moments as we dashed
Across the Quad
Gee It Was Fun
Then, of course, there were those
parades on Saturday afternoons
.... and the special one in which
the Silver Star was awarded post
humously to the father of a ser
geant killed in Italy .... and the
Co. E-Co. I basketball game which
kept the old sports spirit burning
in us ... . and the days we swam
m the pool while we thought of
our friends back East who were
wallowing in two feet of snow ....
Yes, in. spite of our subtle stabs at
California's liquid sunshine, we'll
niss it as we walk bundled up in
heavy mackinaws in Kiska. or
Vladivostok .... or Narvik.
While It Lasted
We'll also remember last Friday
r.ight's "Army Play by Play" one
s.cts .... and the visits to Belt's
when it wasn't "Ladies' Night" . . . .
We'll be leaving, we suppose. Most
of us. And we'll be going back to
being real so'jers. To Stanford, and
:he coeds, et al. (but especially the
coeds), we say, "So long."
And for the memory, thanks!
