### ARTHUR SHAPIRO 
Away back in Little Old New
York, the "smart boys" who make
;he smoke-filled balconies of The
House that Ned Irish Built," Madi
son Square Garden, their home, have
coined a very expressive term which
ihey apply to an athletic event which
.s a sure thing to strike the public
fancy and bring the chips cascading
over the till—a natural.
Tonight at the Pavilion, Co. I
Meets the Roble Hashers in a post
season clash to determine the bas
ketball championship of the campus.
This fray is a "natural" in all senses
cf the word.
Right— n o national award is in
:hc balance, no huge gate will he
collected, the news of the game
probably will not be known far
ther than Palo Alto, hut none of
these things will detract from the
interest of the contest itself. You
can't match two well-balanced
rives, both boasting unblemished
-ecord.s in a campus championship
clash without being sure that the
contest will click.
The Hashers ran ragged over the
civilian hoop tourney teams. Never
once were they seriously threatened
bv any of the other squads; they
s»ere simply too good! Co. I, on the

other side of the fence, did buck up
against a few tartars.
Co. E had the Dutchmen really
reeling in their first clash, ami the
Co. C hasketeers certainly did no
good for the Dutchers' vanity
when they bowed by one narrow
and lonely point.
Throughout the season both of
these squads took on the best that
their respective leagues could offer
and managed to get by without a
scratch with a full skein of scalps
dangling from their belts. Now they
are matched against each other in a
championship clash.
Which team will win? It all de
pends on the issue and page of The
Daily which you choose to believe.
A few days back Mr. Corman of the
Daily sports staff slaked his bet on
the Hashers. Today this pfc. finds
himself approaching the mutuel win
dows with a prayer in his heart, a
two-spot in his outstretched hand,
and a firm belief in his mind that
the Dutchmen are a "sure thing."
Time, 2100; place, the Pavilion;
odds, Co. I by five markers; reason
lor odds: "a good tall team is al
ways a bettor bet than a good short
squad." Army study hours have
been altered to allow all to attend
this contest; study period will end
at 2045.

these squads took on the best that
their respective leagues could offer
and managed to get by without a
scratch with a full skein of scalps
dangling from their belts. Now they
are matched against each other in a
championship clash.
Which team will win? It all de
pends on the issue and page of The
Daily which you choose to believe.
A few days back Mr. Corman of the
Daily sports staff slaked his bet on
the Hashers. Today this pfc. finds
himself approaching the mutuel win
dows with a prayer in his heart, a
two-spot in his outstretched hand,
and a firm belief in his mind that
the Dutchmen are a "sure thing."
Time, 2100; place, the Pavilion;
odds, Co. I by five markers; reason
lor odds: "a good tall team is al
ways a bettor bet than a good short
squad." Army study hours have
been altered to allow all to attend
this contest; study period will end
at 2045.
Away back in Little Old New
York, the "smart boys" who make
;he smoke-filled balconies of The
House that Ned Irish Built," Madi
son Square Garden, their home, have
coined a very expressive term which
ihey apply to an athletic event which
.s a sure thing to strike the public
fancy and bring the chips cascading
over the till—a natural.
Tonight at the Pavilion, Co. I
Meets the Roble Hashers in a post
season clash to determine the bas
ketball championship of the campus.
This fray is a "natural" in all senses
cf the word.
Right— n o national award is in
:hc balance, no huge gate will he
collected, the news of the game
probably will not be known far
ther than Palo Alto, hut none of
these things will detract from the
interest of the contest itself. You
can't match two well-balanced
rives, both boasting unblemished
-ecord.s in a campus championship
clash without being sure that the
contest will click.
The Hashers ran ragged over the
civilian hoop tourney teams. Never
once were they seriously threatened
bv any of the other squads; they
s»ere simply too good! Co. I, on the

other side of the fence, did buck up
against a few tartars.
Co. E had the Dutchmen really
reeling in their first clash, ami the
Co. C hasketeers certainly did no
good for the Dutchers' vanity
when they bowed by one narrow
and lonely point.
Throughout the season both of
these squads took on the best that
their respective leagues could offer
and managed to get by without a
scratch with a full skein of scalps
dangling from their belts. Now they
are matched against each other in a
championship clash.
