Between 400 and 500 AST students
will study at Stanford next quarter,
Col. John R. Eden, commandant of
ASTU 3905, estimated Thursday.
At present there are approxi
mately 1.600 soldier-students on the
Stanford campus, with 650 slated to
graduate at the end of the current
quarter.
What language classes will be of
fered next quarter could not be an
nounced immediately. Colonel Eden
revealed, however, that some of the
present classes will be continued, al
though some language and area stu
dents now here will be transferred
to new special classes to be estab- |
lished at Stanford.
More Prc-Meds
Indications are that Army pre
professional students will continue I
their work at Stanford and that some
additional students in this category
will be sent here, Colonel Eden
stated.
At the same time the commandant
termed the recently issued Army
Service Forces Circular calling for
extreme care in effecting proper as
signment of men separated from j
ASTP. an indication of the War De
partment's desire and intention of
utilizing the knowledge acquit sd by
its soldier-students.
Best Records |
Academic and military leadership
records compiled by students ol
ASTU 3905 will be the determining
factor in what language men will
be retained here to study next quar
ter, Colonel Eden said.
For those men who will be leav
ing Stanford for new assignments, j
the commandant offered this advice: ,
"Avoid bragging about your
ability and scholastic attainments.
Show by doing, rather than talk
ing."
