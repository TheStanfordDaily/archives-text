If the Army ever sends Sergt. Col
lins R. Creasey to Peiping he'll be
as much at home as he would on the
principal corner of his home town of
Macomb, 111.
Creasey, 6-L Chinese student of
Co. E, was in Peiping in 1935 and
1936 as a member of a mounted de
tachment of the U.S. Marines.
And in 1937 and part of 1938, he
saw service in Shanghai, where the
fighting Marines were detailed to
guard the international settlement,
endangered as a result of the Chi
nese-Japanese war.
Dislikes Japs
It was during this service in China
in which Creasey formed an in
tense, dislike of the Japs—an emotion
which he shared with all of his fel
low Marines.
Subsequent events justified this
hatred. The outfit with which he
served in Peiping was later wiped
out on Corregidor. And his buddies
in Shanghai were on Wake when the
laps struck.
His four-year enlistment terminated
in 1938, and he returned to the armed
forces in 1942 as a member of the
AUS.
Creasey, along with the rest of
Chinese f>-L's of Co. E, graduates at
the end of this quarter. And when
his shipping orders come out there's
just one place he hopes to wind up:
China.
