## Roble Hashers, Company I Clash At 9:00 Tonight on Pavilion Floor 
### JOE ZUKIN 
A fitting climax to the intramural
basketball season is the play-off to- |
night for the grand championship j
of the campus, between an unde- j
feated civilian team, the Roble !
Hashers, and a likewise undefeated J
army team, Co. I.
The tussle will bring together the
two top basketball squads on the
campus in a game which should be a
demonstration of skill, both in ball
handling and shooting. The highly
touted Roble team combines its fast
break with plenty of accurate shoot
ing, while the army team relies on
scientific ball handling in an effort
to work the ball in past their op
ponents' defense.
Roble's team consists of five good j
basketball players: "Bones" Halstead,
Jim Burke, Jim Travis, Leon Watson, |
and Hugh Hudson. All five boys j
have had plenty of experience and j
should produce a victory over their
army opponents.
Under all probability the game will

| closely resemble a top-notch college
tilt, making it a good crowd-drawing
j tussle. Admission is free, and it
! would be well worth the while of
| everybody to drop into the Pavilion

i at 9 to'-iight and get plenty of good
I entertainment from watching two top
! teams at work. Don't forget: the time
I is 9 p.m., the place is the Pavilion.
| See you there.
