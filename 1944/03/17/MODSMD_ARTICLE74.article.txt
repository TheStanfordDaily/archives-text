# Quarterly Review
## 
### 
This section of today's
Daily is devoted to a resume
of the activities, personalities,
and events of the past quar
ter. The pictures on this page
depicting some of the high
lights of the past 12 weeks
are followed on the next
three pages by stories of
events which made them
memorable.
The 11th page of this fea
ture section is given over to
the stories of some of the
housemothers on the row.
These women play an im
portant role in sorority living
groups. Housemothers of Pi
Beta Phi, Delta Delta Delta,
and Kappa Alpha Theta will
be introduced to Daily read
ers in a forthcoming edition.
The story devoted to the
work of the organizations on
campus is given to better ac
quaint the new and to refresh
the memories of the old stu
dents about the various op
portunities which are open in
these fields.
On the last page are sum
maries of two of the main
events of the quarter, the
bond contest with Cal and the
Red Cross drive for funds
for the men overseas. In
these drives the Farm showed
that the old Stanford spirit
is far from dead and that
Stanfordites can really co
operate.
This is Winter Quarter 1944
in review. This is a record of
what we have done and, in
some instances, what we
hope to do in spring. This
is our history.
