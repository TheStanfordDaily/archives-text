# Committee Studies Honor Code Problems
## 
### 
The Honor Code, one ol Stanford's
finest traditions, has been studied
this quarter by an Honor Code
Standing Committee, headed by Tom
Martzloff, commtitee chairman ap
pointed by Excom.
The committee is composed of
three faculty members and six stu
dent representatives. Faculty mem
bers are Raymond Davis Harriman,
professor of classics and coordinator
of ASTP instruction; Harold Maile
Bacon, associate professor of mathe
matics; and Harry John Rathbun,
professor of law. Dede DeFriest and
Jim Reynolds, chairmen of Women's
and Men's councils; Luana Forkner,
vice-president of the A.S.S.U.; Julie
Crommelin, lower division member
at large from Excom; Don Landale,
upper division member at large from
Excom; and Martzloff are the student
members.
One of the first problems that
faced Stanford this winter was that
of the Honor Code's relation to the
ASTP students on campus. The
army students had organized a coun
cil, based on the pattern of Men's
and Women's councils .which was to
operate on the same general princi
ples and perform the same functions.
The Honor Code, however, was op
posed to some extent to army ethics
which bar a soldier from reporting
his fellow army men. The final de
cision came from ASTP headquar
ters saying that individual soldier
classes could accept either the Honor
Code or a proctor system by the mu
tual agrement of the professor and of
the majority of students. In a mixed
army and civilian class the army stu
dents would have the right to choose
the system they preferred, and civil

ians would continue under the Honor
Code, accepting the presence of army
proctors as not applying to them
selves, or accepting Honor Code re
sponsibilities with the army students.
ASTP violators of the Honor Code
must appear before the Army Coun
cil, in the same manner that civilian
violators go before council. Since
the Honor Code involves the third
person responsibility of reporting all
observed violations, cases of ASTP
violation go through army council
whether they are reported by aimy
students or civilians. ,
The ASTP officers and students at
Stanford have taken a more favor
able view toward the value of army
application of the Honor Code than
has Princeton, where an honor sys
tem has been in working operation
for 50 years. There, the undergrad
uate honor committee decided that
the solution to the problem would be
to hold the examinations of mixed
classes in separate rooms for service
men and civilians.
The committee made the sugges
tion- this quarter that the words "nor

| unreported violations observed," be
added by the student to the usual
| form of signing the Honor Code
j pledge, "No unpermitted aid given
i or received,"
This statement stresses the vital
j third-person responsibility and is a
j reminder of the whole implication
j ol the Honor Code pledge.
"The reason that the Honor Code
j Standing Committee was formed was
I to keep up the education on the
| Honor Code during this period.
