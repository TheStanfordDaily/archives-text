# Quake Fun But Hectic
## 
### 
Stanford University early one
April morning in 1906, when a sub
dued group of students followed dig
nified Dr. Jordan on a campus tour
of inspection, is remembered vividly
by Mrs. Carolyn Hall, Alpha Phi
house mother.
This tour revealed against a back
ground of flames and smoke, which
tilled the sky to the north, a greatly
devastated Stanford. The tower
which held the chapel steeple bells,
formerly above the arch that leads
to the Memorial Church, was now
only a large pile of crushed sand
stone. A new women's gymnasium
that had just been constructed in
Mie square which is now the Me
morial Theater, was flat on the
ground. With it went all plans for a
gay senior graduation ball to be held
the following May.
Strenuous Week
Mrs. Hall, thp only housemother
on the row that is a Stanford grad
uate, recalls with a reminiscent smile
the week that followed the great San
Francisco earthquake, when girls on
the row slept on their front lawns
because that was the only place
where nothing could fall on them.
When the dew became heavy the
coeds raised their large umbrellas
over the first authentic outdoor
sleeping porch for protection.
For Mrs. Hall and other members
of the class of 1906. which included
Mrs. Mirrielees of the English de
partment, hte earthquake came at a
convenient time. With graduation
only a month away, the administra
tion allowed all those who were
caught up with their work to gradu
ate at once. Thus Mrs. Hall received
her diploma with even less ceremony
than Stanford's war time graduates.
The following month Mrs. Hall,
then Carolyn Edwards, married a
Stanford man on the day which fol
lowed the scheduled date for the
graduation of the class of 1906.
Returns to Alma Mater
Thirty-one years later she re
turned to Stanford as a temporary
house mother for the Alpha Phi's.
Mrs. Hall was an Alpha Phi at Stan
<ord in the early days of sororities
when there were only four women's
houses on the row. Her original plan,
to officiate only until another house
mother could be obtained, was
dropped by popular demand.
According to Mrs. Hall, the old
days of fun at Stanford, when the
trains were met by two-seated horse
and buggies, and house dances were
characterized by cheerful waltzes
and two-steps, have been replaced
by a new kind of fun that is faster
than the old, but in other respects
very similar.

caught up with their work to gradu
ate at once. Thus Mrs. Hall received
her diploma with even less ceremony
than Stanford's war time graduates.
The following month Mrs. Hall,
then Carolyn Edwards, married a
Stanford man on the day which fol
lowed the scheduled date for the
graduation of the class of 1906.
Returns to Alma Mater
Thirty-one years later she re
turned to Stanford as a temporary
house mother for the Alpha Phi's.
Mrs. Hall was an Alpha Phi at Stan
<ord in the early days of sororities
when there were only four women's
houses on the row. Her original plan,
to officiate only until another house
mother could be obtained, was
dropped by popular demand.
According to Mrs. Hall, the old
days of fun at Stanford, when the
trains were met by two-seated horse
and buggies, and house dances were
characterized by cheerful waltzes
and two-steps, have been replaced
by a new kind of fun that is faster
than the old, but in other respects
very similar.
Stanford University early one
April morning in 1906, when a sub
dued group of students followed dig
nified Dr. Jordan on a campus tour
of inspection, is remembered vividly
by Mrs. Carolyn Hall, Alpha Phi
house mother.
This tour revealed against a back
ground of flames and smoke, which
tilled the sky to the north, a greatly
devastated Stanford. The tower
which held the chapel steeple bells,
formerly above the arch that leads
to the Memorial Church, was now
only a large pile of crushed sand
stone. A new women's gymnasium
that had just been constructed in
Mie square which is now the Me
morial Theater, was flat on the
ground. With it went all plans for a
gay senior graduation ball to be held
the following May.
Strenuous Week
Mrs. Hall, thp only housemother
on the row that is a Stanford grad
uate, recalls with a reminiscent smile
the week that followed the great San
Francisco earthquake, when girls on
the row slept on their front lawns
because that was the only place
where nothing could fall on them.
When the dew became heavy the
coeds raised their large umbrellas
over the first authentic outdoor
sleeping porch for protection.
For Mrs. Hall and other members
of the class of 1906. which included
Mrs. Mirrielees of the English de
partment, hte earthquake came at a
convenient time. With graduation
only a month away, the administra
tion allowed all those who were
caught up with their work to gradu
ate at once. Thus Mrs. Hall received
her diploma with even less ceremony
than Stanford's war time graduates.
