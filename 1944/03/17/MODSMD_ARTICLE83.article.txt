# Students Remain Same Says Mrs. Reynolds
## 
### 
"Human nature doesn't change," declared Mrs. Robert Reynolds, house
mother of the Delta Gamma house. "Conditions may have changed, but the
girls at Stanford are the same as they always have been."
Mrs. Reynolds has been "D.G." housemother for five years, but she has
lived in Palo Alto since 1908 and is well acquainted with Stanford and
most of its faculty. â™¦

Born and raised in Vienna, Mrs.
Reynolds attended the Vienna Con
servatory of Music and has always
been interested in music and singing.
In 1908 she married Dr. Robert Rey
nolds, a medical student in Vienna,
and came with him to Palo Alto.
She has returned to Europe many
times, but she considers her real
home to be in Palo Alto. She has
two sons, one of whom recently re
turned home after four years in
Arabia.
"Stanford in the last year or so is
becoming what a university is gen
erally considered to be," said Mrs.
Reynolds. "Students are concentrat
ing more on studying than on play
ing."
She could not compare American
and European universities, but she
said that the European ones are
much stricter than the American
ones.
Mrs. Reynolds has noticed many
changes in Stanford, but she insists
that the students that are here today
are essentially the same as those who
were here when she first came, be
cause she believes that human na
ture does not change.
