# Miss Kopke Tells Of World Travels
## 
### 
Born on the Island of Oahu,
spending summers on sugar planta
tions, traveling between islands, liv
ing in the Australian bush country
for a year, and beina everything from
a kindergarten teacher to a secre
tary; that is only a part of the inter
esting life of Miss Esther Kopke,
house mother of the Gamma Phi
Beta Sorority.
Knitting and purling with fingers
Hying as she talked. Miss Kopke told
of her many trips between the states
and the islands—so many, she con
fided, that she couldn't keep track of
them. She has traveled in Europe
where she spent almost a year in
England, not as a tourist but as a
resident, and where she came to un
derstand English ways. Probably a
remnant of this is her fondness for
serving afternoon tea.
At Cornell First
Other trips have carried her
through the Panama Canal, over the
North Cape Cruise, through Iceland
and Russia. Cross country jaunts are
nothing to her, for she finished her
education at Columbia University
between trips to her home, and was
the Delta Gamma housemother at
Cornell before coming West.
Her most interesting and beautiful
hobby is the collection of rare dolls
from the far away places her travels
have touched upon. "My most prized
possessions are those dolls which are
not being made any longer in coun
tries such as Finland and Norway,"
she stated. Miss Kopke said that
her interest was not only in dolls,
but in cooking, gardening, and hand
work, and most of all, people.
Emphasizes Helping Students
"Counting ration points and plan
ning meals are merely the mechani
cal workings of my position, the most
important part is to help students
over the bumpy roads," she empha
sized.
