# Kappa House Has New Head
## 
### 
In coming 4.0 the Stanford campus
last October, Mrs. Arthur Macondray
began a very new experience as
house mother at Kappa Kappa
Gamma.
Although Mrs. Macondray has
lived in San Francisco for many
years and knew a little of Stanford
activities, she had never visited the
campus for long nor known of the
wide variety of opportunities offered
students in college.
"I am amazed," she commented,
"at the many concerts, the student
plays, and the Tuesday Evening
Series lectures which students are
invited to attend. In fact, they are,"
she added, "an education in them
selves."
Mrs. Macondray, a native of San
Francisco, attended high school and
was married in that city. Before
coming to the campus, she was active
in AWVS work and in the Children's
Clinic Volunteer Service. Asked
about student war work, she replied
that she was tremendously pleased
with the spirit which is being shown,
not only in the success of the War
Bond Drive, but also in the work
done in the bandage rolling and
knitting projects.
"It is certainly encouraging," she

concluded, "to know that along with
studying students can devote a part
of their time to a small part of the
war effort."
