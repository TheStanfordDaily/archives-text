# New Chi O Housemother Finds Warm Welcome Here
## 
### 
Mrs. Harry T. Upshaw, the housemother at the Chi Omega house, is a
newcomer at Stanford, since this is her second quarter here.
She has heard a great deal about the Farm from her two daughters, both
Stanford students, and is happy now to have a chance to live here and to
see everything for herself.
"I like Stanford more the longer I'm here, and I love being a house-

mother," said Mrs. Upshaw. "I'm
especially waiting for Spring Quartei
which I've heard is the most beauti
ful time of the year here."
Mrs. Upshaw last year was house
mother at the Gamma sorority house
at Occidental College, in Eagle Rock,
Calif. She liked all the girls there
and still hears from some of them,
but she was glad to have a chance to
come to Stanford.
"I was very much impressed with
the welcome I received here when I
first arrived," she said, '"and though
I was a little bewildered at first, be
cause Stanford is so much larger
than Occidental, I now feel much
more at home."
