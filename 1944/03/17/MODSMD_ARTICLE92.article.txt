# Red Cross Drive Hits $3,283
## 
### 
Stanford Red Cross activities for
the Winter Quarter of 1944 reached
their height when students met and
surpassed the $3,000 quota in the an
nual campus drive March 1 to 8.
Because of the increased demands
for Red Cross facilities on the home
and fighting fronts, Stanford's quota
was raised from $1 to $2 per student.
Big black headlines appeared in
the Daily with stories emphasizing
the importance of backing up an or-,
ganization that was collecting blood
plasma, training nurses' aides, estab
lishing clubmobiles behind war
fronts the world over, and providing
recreation for sick and wounded
lighting men.
At first it was doubtful that the
campus would reach its quota. The
seventh day found the drive $400
short of its goal. Wednesday, how
ever, saw the drive over the top
with $241 to spare, as representatives
from sororities, men's and women's
halls, and booths on campus turned
in donations to Treasurer Barbara
White.

Final figures showed that 23 cor
ridors, sororities, and halls contrib
uted 100 per centâ€”at least $2 from
each member, and the money is still
coming in! Miss White states that
the grand total of the entire drive
has not yet been reached as dona
tions by army students are still be
ing computed. Figures now stand at
$3,283.51, over 51,150 dollars more
than last year's returns.
Chairman of the drive was Cheri
Martin, assisted by committee heads
Pat Whittemore, Jean Hazlett, B. J.
Miller, Dick Bartle, Barbara Chap
man. and Barbara White.
