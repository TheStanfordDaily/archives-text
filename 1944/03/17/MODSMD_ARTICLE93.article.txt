# Bond Drive Adds Spirit
## 
### 
One of the highlights of Winter
Quarter, 1944, was the bond contest
between the University of California
and Stanford in conjunction with the
Fourth War Loan Drive.
Although the idea, suggested by Cal.
received some opposition because of
the original plan to put up the Stan
ford Axe as a trophy, it was soon ac
cepted with enthusiasm by Farm
students when the Axe idea was re
jected by A.S.S.U. officers.
Intended also to stimulate rivalry
between the two universities, the
contest actually did as much to that
effect as almost any of the Big Games
of other years had done.
Contest Goal
Rivalry was not the only thin H .
however, and students of both
schools gave their money readily for
the purpose of purchasing one
Mitchell B-25, $175,000 bomber with
the combined funds raised by the two
universities.
To promote sales, booths were set
up at the most frequented spots on
campus, and were staffed every day
of the drive by girls who sold bonds
and stamps. A rally to arouse spirit
was held the first night of the drive;
and the Nitery was the scene ol
programs every night of the week. A
community sing, entertainment by
the Kappas, and by the stars of the
"G.I. Gaieties," and a taxi dance kept
money rolling in each evening. Ad
mission was the price of one 25-cent
stamp, and more stamps were
charged for entertainment and re
freshments inside.
Auctions alone accounted for about
half of the total sales, mainly be
cause of accumulative bidding; they
also accounted in great part for the
spirit raised when students watched
an automobile sell for a total oi
some $24,000 alone.
Although Stanford early outdis
tanced California in the purchasing
race, and although Farm spirit far
exceeded that of Cal, that school
steadily overtook Stanford's lead. A
final spurt of purchasing raised Stan
ford's final total to the grand sum of
5186,000 which, though behind CalV
total of $194,912.40, overwhelmingly
defeated Cal on the ratio basis. F<
more important was the fact that tin
schools were able to buy one bombe:
each, with, as Dick Driscoll, A.S.S.U
president, stated, *'a little ammuni
tion to spare."
