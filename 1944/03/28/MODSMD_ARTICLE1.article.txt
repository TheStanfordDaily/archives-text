Last wek we said, 'Thanks for
the memory." We intimated good
bye to the Farm. We were making
plans for leaving in a few weeks,
but they were somewhat vague,
still off in the distance. We tried to
drip with sentimental stuff about
walking on Quad, and dancing in
the Pavilion, etc.
Hut big, tough soldiers don't
go for that kind of stuff. They
never miss a place once they've
left it. They start right out on
their next assignment ("....
after all this was just another
assignment . . . .") and they
never think back to a past which
is just as well forgotten. Big.
tough soldiers didn't like it at
Stanford anyway. It says here.
Yes, from what we could gather
after our tearful column of last
week, if G.l.'s won't admit they're
gonna miss an army "post," they'd
just as soon not talk about the place
at all.
This is, speaking in strict vernac
ular, a Swan Song. We're supposed
to say goodbye. We might have
done it the same way again: "Shoo
Shoo Baby" stuff. Frankly, we
were going to write a parody on
that tune, but we couldn't think of
the correct words to write the
parody on. And then too, we might
be accused of being sentimental,
and of claiming that we were going
to miss Stanford in the months to
come.
"Shoo, shoo baby, don't cry
baby . . . ."—there's a radio play
ing somewhere upstairs. Maybe
if we listen, we'll hear the full
chorus. And write a parody ....
We wouldn't go around saying
(not in public anyway) that we
might miss the sorority houses
and the Lagunitas and Robles and
Hawthornes .... We wouldn't go
around saying that we might miss
these past few weeks at the Lake,
where we could go and forget there
were such things as Physics and
Chinese .... and war. We wouldn't
say we might miss those trips to
Dinah's, or the conversations on the
Library steps, or the bike rides
'round the campus, or the jalopies
(yellow, pink, red, etc.) filled with
smiling coeds, or the ....
No, we won't say we expect to
miss most of these things when
the train's pulling out of Paly.
But we will. And we figure
there'll be a lot of times in the
not too distant future when we'll
want to think back to mad dashes
to the Pi Phi house to beat a
Saturday night lockout .... or
walks along the Bayshore High
way in the wee hours of the
morning .... or hurried hikes to
the P.O. before a 12 o'clock class.
". . . . Bye, bye baby . . . ."—
that radio's still going, and still no
parody
Maybe there will be times when
some G.l.'s will think back to some
open houses last Christmas eve
.... or a gay 12 hours spent aboard
the Daylight returning from a
rushed furlough in L.A (even
though we couldn't get home that
trip, we didn't feel as lonesome as
we might have) .... and the lift
we got at the station from some
coeds we'd never even seen before
.... even the almost happy feeling
of starting classes again after a so
called rest
0.K., we won't talk about these
things. Even if we're thinking of
them. And we'll say we're get
ting tired of college life anyway.
Who wants to study all his life?
Moreover, all these coeds around
the place aren't good for a sol
dier. Hurt his morale. Make him
forget that there's a real war go
ing on in a lot of places in the
world.
But still, we hope there're a lot
of coeds around when that train
whistle starts blowing away this
week. And we even think, in spite
of the hardboiled G.I. attitude, we'll
write to one or two. And hope we
get an answer.
