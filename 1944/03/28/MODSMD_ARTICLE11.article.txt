"As Commandant I take special pride in the
quality of the contingent of trainees Stanford's
ASTU is presenting army organizations this
week. It's a grand group of young men and
soldiers. I confidently predict that the units of
the Army its members join will find places for
them in which they will be of high value in
the future. I have enjoyed working with them,
and my best wishes go with them to their
new stations."
