"Some 11 months ago we had the pleas
ure of welcoming to the campus the first
group of you men of the ASTP assigned to
train at Stanford University. In the months
that followed, many more of you came to
us, until at one time your number at Stan
ford totaled almost 3,000. For us this has
been a most pleasant relationship, and I
sincerely hope that it has been the same for
you.
"We have enjoyed having you with us, and
we have appreciated your friendly spirit and
tolerant understanding of the difficulties that
faced us. In the meantime, we say goodbye
to all of you, and we ask you to remember
that Stanford's best wishes are with you."
