# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
This special issue of the Stanford Daily pre
sents a most fitting time to pay tribute to the
"Dan Cupids" of the campus—the social chair
men of ASTU 3905. Till now they have re
mained in the background, shunning pub
licity; the happiness of the students was the
only "thanks" they asked. They endangered
their lives by arranging blind-dates—yet they
never complained. (Dead men tell no tales!)
Their motto is characteristic of their valor:
Uno Fidelis E Pluribus Stanfordonia (Stanford
Coeds today—Goona Goona girls tomorrow.)
The following "pome" is a dedication to the
memory (?) of these martyrs of social life on
the Farm:
Casey, The Social Chairman, at the Bat
There was ease in Casey's manner
As he stepped up to the phone;
He was filled with pride and confidence
As he coughed a pleasing tone.
From the booth he saw his buddies
And they said, "Good evening, sire."
No soldier in the crowd could doubt
'Twas their chairman on the wire.
Yes, he was batting for his buddies,
The courageous few who waited;
Those unsung heroes of World War II
Who asked to be "blind-dated."
Ten soulful eyes were on him;
In silence the prospects gawked.
The hungry five all listened
As the Social Chairman talked.
He has Lagunita on the phone,
And from his mouth words flow:
"They're tall, they're nice, they're handsome,
And they're all just rarin' to go."
Then Casey stepped out from the booth,
Hands raised to quell the noise.
"At ease," he said, "it's all arranged,
You lucky, lucky, boys!"
Our scene now changes quickly;
For it's early Sunday morn;
I.agunita's coeds dash
To beat the final horn.
But in Encina Manor
Where it's quiet as a tomb (?)
We see five figures armed with sticks
Creep toward young Casey's room
Suddenly the air is shattered
By a wild and murd'rous roar,
Like the beating of some heavy waves
On a stern and distant shore.
"Kill him! Lynch him!" yelled five voices
As they struck and struck some more.
Our hero was outnumbered—
But all's fair in love and war.
Oh, somewhere in this favored land
Some Social Chairmen rate;
But the Social Chairman of Company D
Had arranged his last "blind date"!
Pvt. Jack Michlin, Co. D.
