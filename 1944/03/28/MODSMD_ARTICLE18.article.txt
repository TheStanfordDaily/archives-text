# Dates, Slide Rules, Picnics--Remember?
## 
### ORVIN NOUDNESS 
The last bell has rung; classes are over, finished, busted. Only in
tangible fluff called memories (and a certain amount of pseudo-knowl
edge) remains. Remember?
Remember the day G.I. Joe Doe (you) and all his friends climbed off
the dusty train at Palo Alto and solemnly marched down Palm Drive?

Remember? There was something
wrong about the march. There was
no "hut, two, three, four" and no
sergeant. Instead there was an awe
Private Doe couldn't explain, but
he didn't take time out to think of
it. He was too busy looking at
green vegetation again, and strain
ing his eyes for the sight of a coed.
A Few Restrictions
In front of Encina a First Ser
geant read a few "restrictions." And
Private Doe laughed as he com
pared them to those in the line out
fit he had just left.
Then came chow. Here Private
Doe found something to gripe
about. (He missed griping; it had
come to be his second nature since
induction.) The lines were lontf.
But after he got in. he forgot the
waiting. Instead of family style,
in which Private Doe always came
out on the short end, there were
trays, and women to dish out the
food. And he could smoke in the
dining halls. He pinched himself.
Remember?
Hlind Date
Although Private Doe didn't have
any campus contacts, a friend of
his did, and he soon had a blind
date. Well, she wasn't just the
woman Doe wanted, but she was a
woman. They went to Dinah's, and
before the night was out, everyone
was bright with spirits, most talk
ative, and most busy carving names
in the wall. But Private Doe re
members his other dates better,
when he finally found the woman
he wanted: a five-foot-four girl
with long dishwater blonde hair.
She wore high-heel shoes with low
vamps, no stockings, and a low-cut
light blue cocktail dress, and at the
bottom of her "v" neckline was a
broach which kept coming off. And
she liked Private Doe.
Then the Star Unit ended, and
Private Doe was put into engineer

ing. It was funny, rubbing hand*
over a textbook again, and think
ing about the strange things in
side. It was funny sitting in big
lecture rooms again with it pro
fessor, instead of a corporal, ofii
ciating.
Remember?
As the weeks went by, Joe saw a
few of his friends flunked out be
cause they spent too much time >
Bayshore. He had trouble with his
girl, and found another just as
good, if not better. He went to his
first formal at the Women's Gym
and danced all night with his new
girl, who wore a long fluffy dress
and gold sandals that were open at
the toes. He went on his first pic
nic, in the middle of winter, up in
the hills with just the gang and
their women and enough beer to
make everyone happy. When he
was tired Saturday afternoons, he
went over to the pool for a plunge
and some sun. The folks at home
wouldn't believe he was swimming
in January, but he was.
Time Goes By
More months passed, and Private
Doe beavered on. He had given up
all hope of the commission he once
thought he'd get if he went into
ASTP. He didn't care anymore; he
was going to school, and had a pass
every weekend. He sat by and
watched restriction after restriction
pile up. Still, he was better off
than most fellows in the Army.
Then spring came, and brought
with it rumors that school was all
over.
But Joe Doe (you) knows all
about this. And that isn't what he
wants to remember. He wants to
remember only his girl, and his
haunts on Bayshore Drive, and his
"A" in physics. The rest isn't
worthwhile remembering, anyway
