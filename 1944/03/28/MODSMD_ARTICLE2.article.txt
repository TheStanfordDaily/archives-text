# Special ASTP Daily Is Soldiers' Farewell
## 
### 
This edition of the Daily is
being published as a farewell
gesture by the members of the
ASTP at Stanford. It is more of
an AST re.view than a news edi
tion of the paper, and covers
company histories and soldier
activities during the past 11
months on the Farm. The edi
torial work was done entirely by
soldier students.
