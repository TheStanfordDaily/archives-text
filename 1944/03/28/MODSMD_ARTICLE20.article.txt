# AST Honor Code Set by Council
## 
### 
Recognizing the Honor Code
problem that existed from the start
of the AST Unit here at Stanford,
the Army Student Council insti
tuted a new system this quarter. In
most respects it has been similar to
the one used by the civilian stu
dents, and has functioned smoothly.
The major difference has been
that each Army class has had its
choice between the Honor Code and
a strict proctor system. Another
difference was institution of an
Army Honor Court. It was headed
this quarter by Pl'c. John L. Pick
ering of the Army Student Council,
and functioned in much the same
way as the Men's Council of the
A.S.S.U.
The court is composed of Cadet
Company Commanders, who rotate
in turn, so that a sitting of the
court usually consists of from three
to five members. A case is given
every consideration possible, both
in deciding guilt and in punishment.
The verdict is presented to the
Commandant in the form of a rec
ommendation.
