# Champion Basketball, Volleyball Teams Receive Wallet Awards
## 
### FRANK T. MAGONI 
None of our nation's papers em
blazoned their names across their
sport pages, but ihe G.I. basketeers
of Stanford certainly have proven
worthy of the crumbs of praise
thrown their way. In a tourney
that was as good as any pre-war
college schedule, a scrappy aggre
gate of company teams fought ev
ery inch of the way in an effort to
capture the Army Basketball
Crown .... but Co. I's "Terrible
Dutchmen" finally emerged vic
torious.
Individually, the G.I. cagers have
shown great, style. Who can forget
Kleinjans' deadly accurate set
shots and Gale's last-breaking bas
ket sprints? The brand of basket
eering that these boys have shown
will long be remembered as some of
the best that any team has offered
on the floors of the Stanford Gym.
Pre-Season Choices
At the onset of the season, with
every team eagerly awaiting their
initial game and the local "sharp
ers" out for odd bets, the various
"sports writers" began the age-old
game of "for my money it looks like
etc." Half-way through the season
most of them were contemplating
hara-kiri or something less messy
because their so-called "advanced
info" semed a bit to the "gauche."
Probably the most skillful ex
hibition of the season was given
by the Co. I cagers who led the
tourney with their skillful shooting
and clever ball handling. The
Dutchers played the game as
though they had "written the book"
and exhibited this skill to good ad
vantage to squeeze out of many a
tight spot. No less imposing was the
"goods" delivered by both Co. E
and Co. A. Both of these quintets
showed plenty of basketball "sav
vy" and displayed it numerous
times to the dismay and chagrin of
their opponents. Co. E, led by
Fryer, the six-foot four-inch guard
and veteran of four years of bas
ketball play at UCLA, stole much
of the glory from the league-lead
ing Dutchmen of Co. I. Co. A, on
the other hand, had a good tight
aggregation but seemed to lack the
necessary punch needed to produce
a winning team.
Although somewhat unheralded,
the volleyball season last quarter
was a success. Led by the Japanese
sL's Dobbins and Aldridge, Co. K
romped to an easy victory in the
league by the impressive total of
sevn wins and no losses.
At the beginning of the season
there was little spirit for the game
as indicated by the great number of
defaults .... but once the G.I. Joes
found out that it wasn't a ladies'
game the turnout was exceptional.
Coupled with the fact that volley
ball is a strenuous game the G.l.'s
discovered that there are just as
many compensating factors, such as
being invited over to the sorority
houses after supper for a quick
game or two .... not to mention
the fact that you can make a great

number of nice '"contacts" that way.
The attendance at these games
was not large but the few spectators
present were treated to lots of
laughs.
The league standing at the end
of the tourney was as follows:
Co. K 7 0
Co. E 5 1
Co. I 4 1
Co. A 5 2
Co. 1-1 3 2

In recognition of the work the
G.I. athletes have done in sports
while at Stanford, the Army Stu
dent Council last week authorized
the purchase of 28 wallets for pres
entation to ASTU 3905 champion
athletes. Recipients of the awards
will include members of the cham
pionship Class "A" and Class "B"
basketball teams and the champion
volleyball team. The award will be
presented to the men this week.

etc." Half-way through the season
most of them were contemplating
hara-kiri or something less messy
because their so-called "advanced
info" semed a bit to the "gauche."
Probably the most skillful ex
hibition of the season was given
by the Co. I cagers who led the
tourney with their skillful shooting
and clever ball handling. The
Dutchers played the game as
though they had "written the book"
and exhibited this skill to good ad
vantage to squeeze out of many a
tight spot. No less imposing was the
"goods" delivered by both Co. E
and Co. A. Both of these quintets
showed plenty of basketball "sav
vy" and displayed it numerous
times to the dismay and chagrin of
their opponents. Co. E, led by
Fryer, the six-foot four-inch guard
and veteran of four years of bas
ketball play at UCLA, stole much
of the glory from the league-lead
ing Dutchmen of Co. I. Co. A, on
the other hand, had a good tight
aggregation but seemed to lack the
necessary punch needed to produce
a winning team.
Although somewhat unheralded,
the volleyball season last quarter
was a success. Led by the Japanese
sL's Dobbins and Aldridge, Co. K
romped to an easy victory in the
league by the impressive total of
sevn wins and no losses.
At the beginning of the season
there was little spirit for the game
as indicated by the great number of
defaults .... but once the G.I. Joes
found out that it wasn't a ladies'
game the turnout was exceptional.
Coupled with the fact that volley
ball is a strenuous game the G.l.'s
discovered that there are just as
many compensating factors, such as
being invited over to the sorority
houses after supper for a quick
game or two .... not to mention
the fact that you can make a great

number of nice '"contacts" that way.
The attendance at these games
was not large but the few spectators
present were treated to lots of
laughs.
The league standing at the end
of the tourney was as follows:
Co. K 7 0
Co. E 5 1
Co. I 4 1
Co. A 5 2
Co. 1-1 3 2

In recognition of the work the
G.I. athletes have done in sports
while at Stanford, the Army Stu
dent Council last week authorized
the purchase of 28 wallets for pres
entation to ASTU 3905 champion
athletes. Recipients of the awards
will include members of the cham
pionship Class "A" and Class "B"
basketball teams and the champion
volleyball team. The award will be
presented to the men this week.
None of our nation's papers em
blazoned their names across their
sport pages, but ihe G.I. basketeers
of Stanford certainly have proven
worthy of the crumbs of praise
thrown their way. In a tourney
that was as good as any pre-war
college schedule, a scrappy aggre
gate of company teams fought ev
ery inch of the way in an effort to
capture the Army Basketball
Crown .... but Co. I's "Terrible
Dutchmen" finally emerged vic
torious.
Individually, the G.I. cagers have
shown great, style. Who can forget
Kleinjans' deadly accurate set
shots and Gale's last-breaking bas
ket sprints? The brand of basket
eering that these boys have shown
will long be remembered as some of
the best that any team has offered
on the floors of the Stanford Gym.
Pre-Season Choices
At the onset of the season, with
every team eagerly awaiting their
initial game and the local "sharp
ers" out for odd bets, the various
"sports writers" began the age-old
game of "for my money it looks like
etc." Half-way through the season
