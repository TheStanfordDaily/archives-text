# Company G Nine Winner In Summer Ball Tourney
## 
### 
While our thoughts are far from
baseball right now let's look back
at the Summer Quarter League in
which a scrapping Co. G team came
out on top. They were the first
Army Intramural athletic cham
pions.
In a tight race against other army
teams the well-rounded Co. G ag
gregation finally showed itself to
be the class of the campus. The
champions are E. E. Edwards, N.

Nelson, P. Maertzweiler, M. Old,-
erman, W. Kerch, E. Barghini, P.
Apostolou, J. Dobbins, T. Sweeny,
L. Brazitis, J. Toman, and J. Ca
petz. At this writing all but the
last two mentioned men are still
on campus.
We are not sure where these boys
will play their ball this season, but
we know that if they play the same
brand they did here, they wHI
agaii\ top their respective leagues.
