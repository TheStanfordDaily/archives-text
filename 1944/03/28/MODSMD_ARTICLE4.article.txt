# Social Chairmen Fight On Despite Mission Street, Etc.
## 
### 
In spite of Mission Street, whistling G.l.'s' Pfc. Hookers, Harvard let
ters, and uproar in general, campus soldier-coed social life proceeded
remarkably well during the ASTU's stay in strength.
When the first members of the STAR Unit arrived last April, social
contacts were made through such committees as Cardinals and the W.A.A.

(Women's Athletic Association).
In the Summer Quarter the so
cial committee was better organ
ized, with one man from each com
pany aiding in the coordination
work. The Summer Shuffle was
held on June 26, followed by Nitery
dances sponsored by Klahoya, Cap
and Gown, and Lagunita. W.A.A.
gave two no-date dances and the
ASTP lads chipped in with their
"At Ease" affair.
Jeanette Grimsley succeeded Do
die Crile as social coordinator for
the Fall and Winter quarters, and
kept the ball rolling at the speed of
49 open houses, a bridge tourna
ment, golf tournament, a Company
E dance in the Pavilion, a series of
dancing lessons, and a Company H
Shamrock Serenade.
Much credit is due the company
social chairmen and members of the
committee for the three quarters.
They are:
Harry Broder, Marion Woodbury,
Bob Davy, Jim Sage, Melvyn Hay
