## 
### 
Col. John R. Eden, Comman
dant, has sent the following mes
sage to the secretary of the Army
Student Council in answer to the
council's farewell letter.
"It is probable that I shall not
have an opportunity to see the
membership of the Student
Council before it is due to depart
from Stanford. If you have the
opportunity, I wish you would
convey to the members for me
my hearty appreciation of their
thoughtfulness in addressing me
a joint letter of farewell. It has
been a very real pleasure to me
personally to work with a group
of young men such as composes
the council. Each has made "his
best effort to advance in the
Army Specialized Training Pro
gram at Stanford. I feel that each
has made n distinct contribution."
