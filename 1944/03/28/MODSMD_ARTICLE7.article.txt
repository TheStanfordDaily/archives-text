### 
Establishment of the Army Stu
dent Council to represent 2,700 sol
diers on campus was a major step
in effecting complete cooperation
between the University and the
Army. The Council was set up on
a parallel with the Stanford War
Board and had two representatives
on the A.S.S.U.
The Cadet Honor Court, im
proved study conditions, and the
class A passes for the scholastic
leaders were among the Council's
first-quarter achievements. Offi
cers for the Autumn Quarter were
Pfc. Jack Pickering of Co. G, presi
dent; Pfc. Tom Sawyer of Co. E,
vice-president; Pfc. Ralph Aldridge
of Co. K, secretary; and S/Sgt.
Fred Perata of Co. F, treasurer.
Other members on the council were
Dan Turk, Co. A; Allen Prassel, Co.
B; Dick Garrick, Co. H; George
Pendleton, Co. C; Morris Grodsky,
Co. D; Robert Saleeby, Co. L; and
Karl Mansfield, Co. I.
By the Winter Quarter the ASC
was operating efficiently in a new
office in the former army bookstore.
The ASC held open hours from 5
to 7 through the week for the coun
sel of soldier students with prob
lems or suggestions.
Spirited company elections
brought new blood to the council
in the personages of Pfc. Norm
