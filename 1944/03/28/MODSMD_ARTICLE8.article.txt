(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con

Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this

Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
