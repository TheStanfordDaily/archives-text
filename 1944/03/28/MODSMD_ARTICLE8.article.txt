# Co. Histories Retell Story of Farm AST

(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.
* * fc *

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial
Chapel. Jack Pickering has been
manager of the Stanford Band, and
chairman of the last quarter's Army
Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

Company II

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap
pointed company commander. But
there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.
22, 1943, and E. L. Brown, Jr. ap-
Dance (and Beer)
The Co. H dance, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, and the Beer
Bust at the old Elks Club will long
be remembered.
The executive section of Co. H is
comprised of Captain Brown. Lieu
tenant Roeber, and Sergeants Bay
ard and Nelson.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.

chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial
Chapel. Jack Pickering has been
manager of the Stanford Band, and
chairman of the last quarter's Army
Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

Company II

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap
pointed company commander. But
there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.

Dance (and Beer)
The Co. H dance, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, and the Beer
Bust at the old Elks Club will long
be remembered.
The executive section of Co. H is
comprised of Captain Brown. Lieu
tenant Roeber, and Sergeants Bay
ard and Nelson.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.


"Take down your Service Flag.
Mother . . . ." Remember?
(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.
* * «> *

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.
* * fc *

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at

Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.
* * fc *

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial
Chapel. Jack Pickering has been
manager of the Stanford Band, and
chairman of the last quarter's Army
Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

Company II

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap
pointed company commander. But
there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.
22, 1943, and E. L. Brown, Jr. ap-
Dance (and Beer)
The Co. H dance, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, and the Beer
Bust at the old Elks Club will long
be remembered.
The executive section of Co. H is
comprised of Captain Brown. Lieu
tenant Roeber, and Sergeants Bay
ard and Nelson.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.


"Take down your Service Flag.
Mother . . . ." Remember?
(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.

Dance (and Beer)
The Co. H dance, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, and the Beer
Bust at the old Elks Club will long
be remembered.
The executive section of Co. H is
comprised of Captain Brown. Lieu
tenant Roeber, and Sergeants Bay
ard and Nelson.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.


"Take down your Service Flag.
Mother . . . ." Remember?
(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.
* * «> *

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.
* * fc *

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial
Chapel. Jack Pickering has been
manager of the Stanford Band, and
chairman of the last quarter's Army
Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

Company II

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap
pointed company commander. But
there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.
* * fc *

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial
Chapel. Jack Pickering has been
manager of the Stanford Band, and
chairman of the last quarter's Army
Student Council, and Harry Brown
was assistant director of the band.

Company II

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap
pointed company commander. But
there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.
22, 1943, and E. L. Brown, Jr. ap-
Dance (and Beer)
The Co. H dance, held in the
Women's Clubhouse, and the Beer
Bust at the old Elks Club will long
be remembered.
The executive section of Co. H is
comprised of Captain Brown. Lieu
tenant Roeber, and Sergeants Bay
ard and Nelson.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.


"Take down your Service Flag.
Mother . . . ." Remember?
(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.

Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial

Company H was activated June
22, 1943 ,and E. L. Brown Jr. ap

there was nothing to command.
First person to arrive was Cap
tain Hoon, as Executive Officer. He

and Captain Brown were then both
in command of nothing. On June
28, Cpl. Sheldon E. Bayard blew in
and took over as first sergeant.
A litle later, 15 men arrived and
took the place over. From then on.
Co. H continued to grow. The
greatest improvements took place
from Jan. 1 on. Sergeant Broeking
and Pfc. Jones took over as social
chairmen, and Co. II began to
move. The troubles of Stanford
women were over.

Company L

Since the fourth platoon of the
late Company I is the only survivor
of an illustrious aggregation, a con
venient memory ascribes to it all
the splendors once shared by the
others.
The Dutchmen took charge of
Roosevelt Hall last October, and
Lieuts. Keith L. McCoy and Glen
Hicks with Ist Sgt. Walter Harbert
took over the executive offices. So
cial life eddied around Koble and
Lagunita at times, with an occa
sional tidal wave in the direction of
a sorority house when the men
were properly coaxed by the suc
cessive social chairmen, Waller,
Spector, and Bahnsen. There was
a quaint St. Nicholas party in the
house and continual threat of
something really big in the Amer
ican way.
Top Ball Team
And, still men of excess, this out
fit insisted on more exercise than
drilling, parades, and gymnastics
could provide. The company went
in for basketball in a big way and
came out undefeated in league
competition (let's conveniently for
get names like Roble Hashers).
Players were Smeltz, Kuhn, Lowe,
Kleinjans, Johnson, Jordan. Don
aldson, Smith.

Company K

They figured the Army was at
tempting to raise the morale of the
rest of the post by isolating the Far
Eastern foreigners on the Row
where they could babble away in
their strange tongues and drive no
others crazy but themselves. Thus
came the humble birth of Co. K
under the guidance of Capt. L. E.
Ballard, assisted first by Lieutenant
Baxstrom, later by Captain Long,
and still later by Lieutenant Hen
drickson.
The Japs were billeted in Taft
Hall, the Malays and Chinese 5L in
Harrison, the Chinese 4L in Van
Buren, and the 30 or so pre-meds
in Grant Hall. The Oriental lads
never could figure out how those
pre-meds got tied in, but there they
were.
The Missing Duck
Outstanding mystery of the quar
ter, which is still unsolved, was the
disappearance of the Japs' fair
feathered friend", the lovable duck
Yashiwara. This led to another one
of those "letters to the editor," and
the presentation of a new duck,
Hasemawaru, by the sympathetic
A.O.Pi's.
Since the middle of February the
Row has returned to peaceful slum
ber because Co. K was then dis
solved and its members dispersed
to Toy on, Encina, Branner, and
Sequoia Halls.

Company L

Company L's next C.O. will be
number (hree since its activation.
Scholarly Lt. Robert E. Cook was
on hand as head man when the men
arrived, but Uncle Sam decided on
furthering his education. He was
followed by Captain Doms. who has

just left again. The Q.M. boys were
with Co. L, but have long since em
barked to Camp Lee to dig for gold.
Pre-meds and ERC's alike ex
pressed well wishes to them upon
their leaving.
That just about includes all of
the personnel. But, we can't forget
the big event that came over from
Branner Hall at the colonel's re
quest. Three pre-meds in the per
sonage of Bernard Flanz decided to
give Co. L a break and come over
to help out the situation.
The final step in the unification
of the future M.D.'s was Co. K's
decision to release their pre-meds
so they might join the happy family
as brother Sequoians.

personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
music.

Company

After brief periods when Com
pany C, then a STAR Unit, was
under the command of Maj. Forest
J. Curtis and Maj. Sydney L. Sny
der, Captain McHargue took over
in the middle of last summer, with
Ist Sgt. Van Austin assisting.
When classes began, headquar
ters decided to keep Co. C as a
STAR Unit to catch all the late
comers, and it lasted as "such until
October, when Lt. D. J. Crosno be
came the new C.0., over 200 basic
II engineers.
Social Life
Second quarter, Jim Sage took
over the duties of social chairman,
and when he was detached to the
air corps, his right-hand man, Pete
Riffle, assumed the duties. Last
quarter Orvin Nordness handled
the social activities. Two open
houses were given at Lagunita for
the men during the second quarter.
Winter Quarter, William L. Davis
was elected to the student council,
and several open houses were ar
ranged on the Row.
Highlighting the third quarter
were the "Bullpen B's," Co. C's
second team, which won 10 straight
games until they lost in the pre
finals.

Company I)

Company D was activated in
Toyon Hall with Ist Sgt. Finney in
charge May 16, 1943. Sergeant
Finney stayed in command for two
weeks until Lieutenant Covell took
over. In June, Captain Hutchison
zelieved Lieutenant Covell as C.O.
Early in July, Co. D moved from
Toyon Hall to fourth floor Encina
Hall. With half of old Co. K and
the remaining men who were in
old Co. D in the STAR unit days,
a new Co. D was activated, with
Captain Hutchison and Ist Sgt.
Finney still running the show.
New C.O.
While the men were on their sec
ond furlough, Captain Hutchison
was relieved as commander of the
company and made assistant Trans
portation Officer. The new C.O. was
Captain Alexander. At this time 69
men in Advanced Engineering were
transferred from Co. H to Company
D, and 55 men from Co. D were
transferred to Co. 5 from Co. D.

Company E

Company E was formed in May.
1943, without a single commissioed
leader; the company was led by Ist
Sgt. Ross of the cadre and by S/Sgt.
Guy E. Sanford, the first trainee
company commander.
As time passed on, the men pro
posed a dance to toast Stanford's
hospitality, and the "At Ease" affair
resulted. It was presented by Com
panies E and F.
"Indian Summer"
Lt. Van Metre succeeded Cap
tain Taylor as C.O. when the cap
tain left the Farm for a more im
portant job overseas. Lieutenant
Dill was the new executive officer.
Along in November the clamor for
another dance arose, and the super
ambitious men put on "Indian
Summer" in the middle of Novem
ber.
In the field of sports were two
top-ranking basketball teams, one
of which took the championship.

Baseball, football, and even bridge
allowed Co. E to bring forth its
experts. Norman Gilchrist was
president of the ASC this quarter.

Company F

The makeup of Company F has
never been permanent. Because of
this, the Italian students learned
all about biology, the pre-meds
learned the workings of the Q.M.
Corps, and the Q.M. men were be
ginning to speak Italian.
Fame and fortune came to Co. F
last fall for a brief spell due to the
Pfc. Hooker incident. Remember?
Things became peaceful again—the
Q.M.'s and the pre-meds shipped
out, and so the quarter ended.
Dutch Transfers
The new quarter—that is. Winter
Quarter —began, and with it came
the Dutch students who found it
very hard to learn Italian.
Co. F's men have moved from
Sequoia Hall. Encina Hall, Van
Buren Hall, and Toyon Hall to
Branner Hall—next stop — "Fox
Hall."

Company G

From the basement of Toyon Hall
have come the salaveric hisses of
the Japanese translators; from the
third floor corridors the rapid fire
chatterings of the Spanish platoon;
and from the second floor a cosmo
politan mixture of German and
French utterings: Co. G in all its
glory.
Co. G was the winner in the
baseball league last fall. In basket
ball, their showing has been of the
best, with Steve Nagy playing a
stellar role on the team.
"G" Men in Gaieties
In the "G.I. Gaieties," a number
of Co. G boys appeared. And in the
"Army Play by Play" cast, Co. G
placed nine men, with Bud Irving
as assistant director, and Sgt. Victor
Amend as stage manager.
Frank Rogier has sung solo at
several concerts in the Memorial

"Take down your Service Flag.

(Editor s Note:—Because army students at Stanford have been quar
tered in numerous men's halls, each group has lived under different con
ditions. In an attempt to record as closely as possible the events and
changes occurring in the different halls and houses, below is printed a
brief history of each company. The articles were written by men from
the respective companies and were little touched by the editor's blue
pencil.)

Company A

Company A's Saturday night pil
grimage to San Francisco and Roble
were sometimes interrupted by re
strictions handed out by Lieutenant
Klein and Captain Hutchinson, suc
cessive commanding officers. Lieu
tenant Pendergast, executive offi
cer, was well known by both the
officers and men. He was known to
be greeted by the cry, "Hey, Lieu
tenant! Your hat's on backwards!"
First Sgt. Balkus, assisted by T/5
Bacigalupi, completed the orderly
room gang.
Socially Conscious
Socially, Co. A was quite con
scious. Its last quarter's skit.
"Snafu," was enjoyed not only by
the men and officers of the com
pany, but also by the outsiders who
saw Mai Yarborough* Bob Bien,
Gene May, and Willie T. Ashe do
their stuff in the Gaieties. Social
chairmen responsible for the cam

pus activities were Harry Broder,
Julius Buckler, and Bob Ekdahl.
Dan Turk was vice-president of
the Army Student Council this
quarter.
Handled by Athletic Chairmen
Howard Bergman and Ted Samuel,
Co. A held an upper bracket spot in
every sport.

Company B

Probably Company B's only bid
for distinction is its inability to
hold executive officers. Since its
change from a STARU to an ASTU
company on Oct. 1, 1943, Captain
Woodward, Company Commander,
has lost four assistant officers:
Lieutenant Kline, Lieutenant Cook,
Lieutenant Anderson, and just last
week Lieutenant Gayton. Aiding
them all was Ist Sgt. Boggs.
Chinese, Enginers
Company B had also had a varied
personnel during its six months of
activity. It has played host to Basic
I and II mechanical engineers, civil
engineers, and Chinese language
students.
Despite its changing personnel,
the company was able to put on one
campus dance during this quarter.
Under the co-direction of Pfc.
Kitchens and Private Fletcher, a
Company B dance was held in the
Women's Clubhouse on Feb. 12
with the G.I. Jivers furnishing the
