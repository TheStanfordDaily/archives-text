# What About Spring?
## 
### 
Get out your bathing suits, pull your suntan
oil out of the cabinet and head for the lake or
some other sun-drenched spot up in the hills
and start laying on your spring coat of tan. It's
funny about tans, too; dark people are always
wishing they were fair; fair people sun for
hours in the hope of trying to get dark.
But to get back to Spring Quarter at Stanford.
It's been a sort of tradition in the past, way back
in '39 and the Spring Quarters before, for Stan
ford to do nothing but play. The boat-house
ran Coney Island some stiff competition; it was
in keeping with Stanford society to go minus.
Those who had the nerve or stupidity to go over
plus zero were outcasts—d.a.r.'s.
That was the way things were on the Farm
then. But if you're one of the poor saps who
still think this is the way things are, wake up
and before you hit your spring finals.
A lot of college students are tired of hearing
the old song and dance about "this is war and
everyone's got to do his pait." They don't con
nect what some soldier is going through in
Burma with what they're doing in college.
They know they're supposed to get good grades
(everyone says so) but it takes so much time
and trouble when a person can graduate on C's.
Anyone who feels this way should do one
of two things. He should be spanked in the
hope of being made to grow up, or he ought to
leave school and get a job—a hard job.
So it's spring and time for getting a suntan.
But just remember that going to college does
not directly help the winning of the war. Un
less you're giving your all to it, you aren't worth
the room you take up on this earth.
