# Then There's the Bicycle
## 
### 
It's a fanny thing about bicycles. They are
somehow exempt from all lawsâ€”of morality,
of etiquette, or of anything else whatsoever.
Nobody would think of walking into your

room while you were out, taking your coat out
of the closet and then, when tired of it several
hours later, leaving it somewhere on the English
corner. No, there's something not quite right
about that.
But jobbing somebody's bicycle just before
their nine o'clock class, leaving it in front of
the Libe or the Ad building or the women's
gym with never a word to anyone, is somehow
perfectly all right.
If the people who walk off with those bikes
could just see the poor owners wandering dis
consolately from rack to rack, maybe, just
maybe, they wouldn't be so clear of conscience.
Grabbing an unknown bike when you're in
one of those unholy rushes is understandable
but what the poor old owners wonder about is
why, oh why can't you bring it back where ;
you got it? Nancy Tilden
