# Khaki and Blue
## 
### 
It was the Dec. 11, 1942, Daily special edition
that told Stanford students that Navy air cadets
would arrive at the Farm for training.
But before Stanford had had a chance to real
ize that the Navy was coming, plans were
changed; a while later The Daily told us that
instead of the Navy blue we could expect khaki.
And so the University became a part of the
nation-wide AST program.
Now the AST has been disbanded, although
a few men remain out of the thousands present
last quarter.
And today's edition of The Daily reveals that
Navy pre-medical students are on the Farm,
and the Quad will be trod by the Navy blue as
was originally planned.
Although there are but a handful of Navy
men as compared to the number of Army stu
dents who enrolled in Stanford a while ago,
the welcome extended to them is just as big.
