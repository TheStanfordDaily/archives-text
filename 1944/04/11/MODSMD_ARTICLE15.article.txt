### 
Among many and varied other things the
Stanford Daily keeps a file of college news
papers throughout the country. To mention a
few, we have the Arizona Wildcat, the Purdue
Exponent, the Utah Chronicle, the Ka Leo oo
Hawaii, the Daily Northwestern, the Daily Kan
san, the Bulldog (Redlands), the Reveille (Loui
siana State Elementary) and the Whitman Col
lege Pioneer.
Those of you now on campus from other
colleges are most cordially invited to come in
and browse around. That is, if you can find
your way through those many and varied other
things to the files. If nothing else you may
catch an interesting glimpse of that peculiar
phenomenon, the Daily staff member. At any
rate we shall be most happy to have you.—
