# STANFORD WOMEN REPORT ON AIR WACS
## Women Soldiers Prove a Vital Part of Salinas Base 
### Helen Dietz 
Don't ever let anyone tell you a
woman can't take over a man's work
and do it well, for the 50-odd Air
WACS and their nine officers sta
tioned at the Salinas Army Air Base
have proved themselves worthy of a
salute from both servicemen and
civilians.
On a tour of the air base, situated
about 75 miles south of Palo Alto,
the Daily reporter saw the WACS
efficiently and capably taking over
administrative and clerical duties,
and working as dispatchers, tele
typists, photographers, cooks, driv
ers, and in dozens of other jobs for
merly considered to be "strictly male
G.1."
Air WAC Pioneers
Everywhere, says Lieut. Ruth
Ringland, head of Palo Alto. Air
WAC recruiting, the WACS are
happy doing their jobs and working
together for a common purpose,
larger in scope than any beiore.
The original cadre of 10 WACS ar
rived at the new Salinas field July
28, 1943 from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.
Immediately they started to work
learning the functions of the new
base and paving the way for addi
tional WACS to be stationed there.
Today over 40 women are fed in
the mess hall, a long building with
tables and benches at one end and
stoves, ovens, sinks, and refrigerator
and supply room at the other.
Fill 'er Up!
Sunday noon dinner included ham,
raisin sauce, mashed potatoes, corn,
salad, peaches, chocolate cookies,
eooffee or milk—a hearty meal, but
an essential one for hard-working
WACS.
The women, according to the WAC
mess sergeant, have the same menus
as the men, but with a few items de
leted and less starch—for that
streamlined figure.
On the walls of the room are
posters warning against waste, some
thing there is not much of, as the
mess sergeant must check the gar
bage cans regularly. The WACS do
their own butchering, but the potato
peeling is taken care of by a shiny
new machine. The only catch, says

the mess sergeant, is that "the eyes
have to be taken out by hand.''
Home Was Never Like This
A tour of the barracks revealed
rows of neat beds, with towels over
one end and shoes smartly lined up
underneath. Each WAC has a locker
and chest in which belongings are
arranged in exact pattern. The
thought of regimentation, according
to Lieutenant Ringland, may dis
courage a girl from joining the serv
ice, but after she is in she enjoys it.
The energetic, red-headed WAC,
who conducted the tour of the pho
tography laboratory, had never stud
ied photography until she entered
the service, but she is now com
pletely engrossed in her work. In
addition to mixing chemicals, de
veloping, printing, and enlarging, the
WACS take aerial photographs from
the planes at the field.
Watch Over Aircraft
Work in the aircraft dispatching
room is carried on, in part, by Air
WACS who kep track of the location
of every plane off the field and ap
proaching it. At Salinas, an advanced
training base, women are not yet
used in the control tower overlooking
the field, although they do this work
in many other parts of the country.
On the job in the motor pool are
overall-clad WACS who drive cars
and learn how they run and what to
do when they don't.
WAC officers eat at the Officers'
Club, a comfortable, well-furnished
building, complete with soda foun
tain and slot machines. The officers,
however, are happy to be allowed to
eat in the enlisted women's mess on
occasion.
The Colonel's Secretaries
Important work is carried out by
the officers and enlisted women in
the administration building, another
of the long, rambling, tar-papered
structures spread over the Salinas
countryside. Here is the office of
Col. Theodore M. Bolen, Command
ing Officer of the base, and Lt. Col.
Boyd C. Homewood, Executive Offi
cer, whose secretaries are both in
the WAC, as is the assistant adjutant,
the "office manager."
Carrying out their duties are en
listed women and officers in Public
Relations, Intelligence, Supply, and

many other non-combatant jobs. At
the Salinas base Air WACS are in
charge of the message center and the
distribution of the daily bulletin.
The Sergeant Likes Them Too
According to a sergeant at the base
hospital, "WACS do practically
everything around here." and, "they
are better than I expected." WACS
do clerical work and assist doctors
and other personnel in the hospital,
which is equipped with day rooms,
mess hall, supply rooms, and wards,
where patients lying in bed study
aircraft identification from planes
hung from the ceiling.
Each WAC has one day off a week
which she may spend in town, al
though there are clubrooms and
movie available for recreation at the
base. A beauty shop, manned by
civilians, but soon to be taken over
b3' the WACS, has also been estab
lished at the field.
Lieutenant Ringland states that
she has never found a case of G.I.
resentment against the women sol
diers. On the contrary, the Salinas
base, which was established in De
cember 1940, is eagerly awaiting the
arrival of more members of the
Women's Army Corps.

which she may spend in town, al
though there are clubrooms and
movie available for recreation at the
base. A beauty shop, manned by
civilians, but soon to be taken over
b3' the WACS, has also been estab
lished at the field.
Lieutenant Ringland states that
she has never found a case of G.I.
resentment against the women sol
diers. On the contrary, the Salinas
base, which was established in De
cember 1940, is eagerly awaiting the
arrival of more members of the
Women's Army Corps.
Don't ever let anyone tell you a
woman can't take over a man's work
and do it well, for the 50-odd Air
WACS and their nine officers sta
tioned at the Salinas Army Air Base
have proved themselves worthy of a
salute from both servicemen and
civilians.
On a tour of the air base, situated
about 75 miles south of Palo Alto,
the Daily reporter saw the WACS
efficiently and capably taking over
administrative and clerical duties,
and working as dispatchers, tele
typists, photographers, cooks, driv
ers, and in dozens of other jobs for
merly considered to be "strictly male
G.1."
Air WAC Pioneers
Everywhere, says Lieut. Ruth
Ringland, head of Palo Alto. Air
WAC recruiting, the WACS are
happy doing their jobs and working
together for a common purpose,
larger in scope than any beiore.
The original cadre of 10 WACS ar
rived at the new Salinas field July
28, 1943 from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.
Immediately they started to work
learning the functions of the new
base and paving the way for addi
tional WACS to be stationed there.
Today over 40 women are fed in
the mess hall, a long building with
tables and benches at one end and
stoves, ovens, sinks, and refrigerator
and supply room at the other.
Fill 'er Up!
Sunday noon dinner included ham,
raisin sauce, mashed potatoes, corn,
salad, peaches, chocolate cookies,
eooffee or milk—a hearty meal, but
an essential one for hard-working
WACS.
The women, according to the WAC
mess sergeant, have the same menus
as the men, but with a few items de
leted and less starch—for that
streamlined figure.
On the walls of the room are
posters warning against waste, some
thing there is not much of, as the
mess sergeant must check the gar
bage cans regularly. The WACS do
their own butchering, but the potato
peeling is taken care of by a shiny
new machine. The only catch, says

the mess sergeant, is that "the eyes
have to be taken out by hand.''
Home Was Never Like This
A tour of the barracks revealed
rows of neat beds, with towels over
one end and shoes smartly lined up
underneath. Each WAC has a locker
and chest in which belongings are
arranged in exact pattern. The
thought of regimentation, according
to Lieutenant Ringland, may dis
courage a girl from joining the serv
ice, but after she is in she enjoys it.
The energetic, red-headed WAC,
who conducted the tour of the pho
tography laboratory, had never stud
ied photography until she entered
the service, but she is now com
pletely engrossed in her work. In
addition to mixing chemicals, de
veloping, printing, and enlarging, the
WACS take aerial photographs from
the planes at the field.
Watch Over Aircraft
Work in the aircraft dispatching
room is carried on, in part, by Air
WACS who kep track of the location
of every plane off the field and ap
proaching it. At Salinas, an advanced
training base, women are not yet
used in the control tower overlooking
the field, although they do this work
in many other parts of the country.
On the job in the motor pool are
overall-clad WACS who drive cars
and learn how they run and what to
do when they don't.
WAC officers eat at the Officers'
Club, a comfortable, well-furnished
building, complete with soda foun
tain and slot machines. The officers,
however, are happy to be allowed to
eat in the enlisted women's mess on
occasion.
The Colonel's Secretaries
Important work is carried out by
the officers and enlisted women in
the administration building, another
of the long, rambling, tar-papered
structures spread over the Salinas
countryside. Here is the office of
Col. Theodore M. Bolen, Command
ing Officer of the base, and Lt. Col.
Boyd C. Homewood, Executive Offi
cer, whose secretaries are both in
the WAC, as is the assistant adjutant,
the "office manager."
Carrying out their duties are en
listed women and officers in Public
Relations, Intelligence, Supply, and

many other non-combatant jobs. At
the Salinas base Air WACS are in
charge of the message center and the
distribution of the daily bulletin.
The Sergeant Likes Them Too
According to a sergeant at the base
hospital, "WACS do practically
everything around here." and, "they
are better than I expected." WACS
do clerical work and assist doctors
and other personnel in the hospital,
which is equipped with day rooms,
mess hall, supply rooms, and wards,
where patients lying in bed study
aircraft identification from planes
hung from the ceiling.

the Salinas base Air WACS are in
charge of the message center and the
distribution of the daily bulletin.
The Sergeant Likes Them Too
According to a sergeant at the base
hospital, "WACS do practically
everything around here." and, "they
are better than I expected." WACS
do clerical work and assist doctors
and other personnel in the hospital,
which is equipped with day rooms,
mess hall, supply rooms, and wards,
where patients lying in bed study
aircraft identification from planes
hung from the ceiling.
Each WAC has one day off a week
which she may spend in town, al
though there are clubrooms and
movie available for recreation at the
base. A beauty shop, manned by
civilians, but soon to be taken over
b3' the WACS, has also been estab
lished at the field.
Lieutenant Ringland states that
she has never found a case of G.I.
resentment against the women sol
diers. On the contrary, the Salinas
base, which was established in De
cember 1940, is eagerly awaiting the
arrival of more members of the
Women's Army Corps.
Don't ever let anyone tell you a
woman can't take over a man's work
and do it well, for the 50-odd Air
WACS and their nine officers sta
tioned at the Salinas Army Air Base
have proved themselves worthy of a
salute from both servicemen and
civilians.
On a tour of the air base, situated
about 75 miles south of Palo Alto,
the Daily reporter saw the WACS
efficiently and capably taking over
administrative and clerical duties,
and working as dispatchers, tele
typists, photographers, cooks, driv
ers, and in dozens of other jobs for
merly considered to be "strictly male
G.1."
Air WAC Pioneers
Everywhere, says Lieut. Ruth
Ringland, head of Palo Alto. Air
WAC recruiting, the WACS are
happy doing their jobs and working
together for a common purpose,
larger in scope than any beiore.
The original cadre of 10 WACS ar
rived at the new Salinas field July
28, 1943 from Fort Oglethorpe, Ga.
Immediately they started to work
learning the functions of the new
base and paving the way for addi
tional WACS to be stationed there.
Today over 40 women are fed in
the mess hall, a long building with
tables and benches at one end and
stoves, ovens, sinks, and refrigerator
and supply room at the other.
Fill 'er Up!
Sunday noon dinner included ham,
raisin sauce, mashed potatoes, corn,
salad, peaches, chocolate cookies,
eooffee or milk—a hearty meal, but
an essential one for hard-working
WACS.
The women, according to the WAC
mess sergeant, have the same menus
as the men, but with a few items de
leted and less starch—for that
streamlined figure.
On the walls of the room are
posters warning against waste, some
thing there is not much of, as the
mess sergeant must check the gar
bage cans regularly. The WACS do
their own butchering, but the potato
peeling is taken care of by a shiny
new machine. The only catch, says

the mess sergeant, is that "the eyes
have to be taken out by hand.''
Home Was Never Like This
A tour of the barracks revealed
rows of neat beds, with towels over
one end and shoes smartly lined up
underneath. Each WAC has a locker
and chest in which belongings are
arranged in exact pattern. The
thought of regimentation, according
to Lieutenant Ringland, may dis
courage a girl from joining the serv
ice, but after she is in she enjoys it.
The energetic, red-headed WAC,
who conducted the tour of the pho
tography laboratory, had never stud
ied photography until she entered
the service, but she is now com
pletely engrossed in her work. In
addition to mixing chemicals, de
veloping, printing, and enlarging, the
WACS take aerial photographs from
the planes at the field.
Watch Over Aircraft
Work in the aircraft dispatching
room is carried on, in part, by Air
WACS who kep track of the location
of every plane off the field and ap
proaching it. At Salinas, an advanced
training base, women are not yet
used in the control tower overlooking
the field, although they do this work
in many other parts of the country.
On the job in the motor pool are
overall-clad WACS who drive cars
and learn how they run and what to
do when they don't.
WAC officers eat at the Officers'
Club, a comfortable, well-furnished
building, complete with soda foun
tain and slot machines. The officers,
however, are happy to be allowed to
eat in the enlisted women's mess on
occasion.
The Colonel's Secretaries
Important work is carried out by
the officers and enlisted women in
the administration building, another
of the long, rambling, tar-papered
structures spread over the Salinas
countryside. Here is the office of
Col. Theodore M. Bolen, Command
ing Officer of the base, and Lt. Col.
Boyd C. Homewood, Executive Offi
cer, whose secretaries are both in
the WAC, as is the assistant adjutant,
the "office manager."
Carrying out their duties are en
listed women and officers in Public
Relations, Intelligence, Supply, and

many other non-combatant jobs. At
