# Stanford Graduate Explains Life as WAC Court Reporter

By Corporal Helen Sterling, WAC
I never dreamed I'd like it. When
I was assigned to the Judge Advo
cate's office here at Headquarters I
didn't know a thing about law. I
don't know much yet, but I begin to
absorb some of it painlessly. Maybe
when this is over I'll try to get an
LL.B. at Stanford. But when I was
assigned here as a court reporter on
general courts-martial cases I was
very dubious. All my sympathies
were with the under-dog.
They left me pretty much alone for
a month, and I spent my time reading
cases, studying the Manual for
Courts-Martial (our Bible), reading
Winthrop on "Military Law and
Precedents," practicing on my steno
type, which, incidentally, I had just
learned before I entered the WAC,
when it was still known as the Wom
en's Army Auxiliary Corps.
K.P Machine
I learned to my surprise that the
accused man in the Army got a very
fair break. Before his case ever came
to trial it was thoroughly and impar
tially investigated. He was provided
with a defense attorney. Free, of
course. But if he wanted, he could
employ his own. After the trial the
case was thoroughly reviewed in this
office, and then sent on to Washing
ton for a final review. And to me the
wonderful part of it was that if the
soldier had just happened to get into
trouble, and wasn't in any sense de
praved or vicious, there was every
chance in the world for him to make
a come-back at the Rehabilitation
Center to which he was sent, and
after some months rejoin the Army
on an honorable basis. When I found
this out, I felt much better.
Then I reported my first case. I
was so nervous that when I took the

reporter's oath at the beginning of
the trial my hand quivered like jelly.
Now, after some months, it's not so
conspicuous. This Command has a
reporter's pool, and we are sent out
all over within the Command on the
general courts-martial cases. The
other six reporters — two of whom
were professional court-reporters in
civilian life—are enlisted men, so I
am insufferably proud of the fact that
a WAC made the grade.
'Proud of Uniform'
The Command extends as far east
as Texas, and pretty far north, but
we have no flying fields in the Bay
Region and that's a disappointment.
Inevitably we fly back and forth a
good deal. That saves time. But
early this month, when it was a little
wet in this part of the country, it
took me and the Colonel—or maybe
I should say the Colonel and me—
two days to fly from Marana AAF
in Arizona to Santa Ana, a distance
which the bomber ordinarily would
have covered in three hours.
I'm proud to be in uniform, and
under my particular circumstances, 1
couldn't look the world in the eye if
I weren't. But not everyone is situ
ated alike. I teel it's an individual
problem, and often a tough one, and
has to be solved individually. The
Air Forces needs the women, and
they need superior women, And they
need them in the ranks.
Just now it takes a little longer to
make Officer Candidate School, but
the woman who wants to, and who
has the stuff, can be pretty sure of
getting there eventually. Life in the
barracks isn't too far a cry from life
in the dormitory. The beds may be
a little closer together, but human
nature is about the same in both
places. A little richer, I feel, in the
barracks because the girls are drawn
from all economic levels, and from all
over the country,

I never dreamed I'd like it. When
I was assigned to the Judge Advo
cate's office here at Headquarters I
didn't know a thing about law. I
don't know much yet, but I begin to
absorb some of it painlessly. Maybe
when this is over I'll try to get an
LL.B. at Stanford. But when I was
assigned here as a court reporter on
general courts-martial cases I was
very dubious. All my sympathies
were with the under-dog.
They left me pretty much alone for
a month, and I spent my time reading
cases, studying the Manual for
Courts-Martial (our Bible), reading
Winthrop on "Military Law and
Precedents," practicing on my steno
type, which, incidentally, I had just
learned before I entered the WAC,
when it was still known as the Wom
en's Army Auxiliary Corps.

I learned to my surprise that the
accused man in the Army got a very
fair break. Before his case ever came
to trial it was thoroughly and impar
tially investigated. He was provided
with a defense attorney. Free, of
course. But if he wanted, he could
employ his own. After the trial the
case was thoroughly reviewed in this
office, and then sent on to Washing
ton for a final review. And to me the
wonderful part of it was that if the
soldier had just happened to get into
trouble, and wasn't in any sense de
praved or vicious, there was every
chance in the world for him to make
a come-back at the Rehabilitation
Center to which he was sent, and
after some months rejoin the Army
on an honorable basis. When I found
this out, I felt much better.
Then I reported my first case. I
was so nervous that when I took the

reporter's oath at the beginning of
the trial my hand quivered like jelly.
Now, after some months, it's not so
conspicuous. This Command has a
reporter's pool, and we are sent out
all over within the Command on the
general courts-martial cases. The
other six reporters — two of whom
were professional court-reporters in
civilian life—are enlisted men, so I
am insufferably proud of the fact that
a WAC made the grade.
'Proud of Uniform'
The Command extends as far east
as Texas, and pretty far north, but
we have no flying fields in the Bay
Region and that's a disappointment.
Inevitably we fly back and forth a
good deal. That saves time. But
early this month, when it was a little
wet in this part of the country, it
took me and the Colonel—or maybe
I should say the Colonel and me—
two days to fly from Marana AAF
in Arizona to Santa Ana, a distance
which the bomber ordinarily would
have covered in three hours.
I'm proud to be in uniform, and
under my particular circumstances, 1
couldn't look the world in the eye if
I weren't. But not everyone is situ
ated alike. I teel it's an individual
problem, and often a tough one, and
has to be solved individually. The
Air Forces needs the women, and
they need superior women, And they
need them in the ranks.
