"In the Spring, a young man's
fancy lightly turns to thoughts of
baseball."—Bartle
Spring is here again. Spring quar
ter is here again! Baseball is here
- gain!! (ain't life wonderful?) Local
Board 112 is still here!!! (or ain't life
wonderful?).
Yep, the ole ball season is once
more at hand. Pacific Coast League
tlay started Saturday, and the col
egcs in this part of the country (or
.voine of them) have already begun
their season.
Only three teams are left in the
C.1.8.A.. now that Stanford, Santa
Clara, arid St. Mary's have been
forced to drop out. The three schools
blessed with Navy and Marine un
dergraduate trainees are Cal, USC,
and UCLA.
The chances of Stanford's reenter
ing competition during wartime seem
to have hit an all-time low, unless
1) the Navy's medical trainees, (2)
the youngsters under 18, or (3) the
women students do the playing. The
quota of deferred students is now a
thing of the past. Even the 4-F's may
be called in a labor draft.
For the first time in Stanford's
history, the women students out
number the men. As time goes on,
:his trend will probably continue, but
rapidly. If Stanford does reenter
intercollegiate competition in the
near future, it looks like our chief
rival in the bay area will no longer
oe Cal—but Mills College.
The outlook for professional base
ball isn't quite so gloomy. We saw
the Seals open the season Saturday
.-.gainst the Portland Beavers, and
outside of the size of the score, the
rracas actually resembled an honest
:o-goodness ball game.
Be sure to watch this space to
morrow for our predictions on the
outcome of the '44 Coast League pen
nant race. We can't do any worse
than we did on basketball, or can
we?
