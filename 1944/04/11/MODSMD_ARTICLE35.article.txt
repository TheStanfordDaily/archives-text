# Ernie Nevers To Seek S.F. Grid Franchise
## 
### 
Capt. Ernie Nevers of the Marines,
in a letter sent from the post of his
amphibious unit in the Pacific, has
announced that he plans to seek a
National Football League franchise
for San Francisco after the war is
over.
Nevers said in his letter, which was
sent to Superior Court Judge Mi
chael L. McKinley of Chicago, that
adequate financial backing for the
venture has already been arranged.
He said that, as soon as he is re
turned to the United States, he plans
to open negotiations with Elmer Lay
den, president of the league.
Nevers was one of the greatest

football players of all time, both as a
college athlete here at Stanford and
as a professional. His name was al
most synonymous with that of Stan
ford in the field of football, and his
"Number One" jersey was retired
when he graduated.
The play of Ernie Nevers was one
of the highlights of the early years
of "Pop" Warner's reign as head
coach. In 1928, he returned to Stan
ford to accept a position as assistant
coach under Warner.
Captain Nevers has been with a
Marine amphibious unit in the Pa
cific for several months. He did not
say who his associates will be in his
proposed football venture.
