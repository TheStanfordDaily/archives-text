# Farm Professor Recommends Middle East Oil Development
## 
### 
It is "clearly advisable" that Mid
dle Eastern oil resources should be
more fully developed to meet de
mands of the near future, and con
struction of the trans-Arabia pipe
]ine proposed by the United States
government could be a well-calcu
lated first step, or it could be a "dis
astrous mistake." This recommenda
tion. and warning, comes from Her
bert Feis, acting associate of the
Stanford University Food Research
Institute.
Dr. Feis was until recently ad
viser on international economic af
fairs in the United States Depart
ment of State and the passage quoted
2S from the publication "Petroleum
and American Foreign Policy," just
published by the Institute.
Outlines Policy
In outlining the major elements
of what should be the American
government's petroleum policy, Dr.
Feis urges that the pipeline proposal
should be revised and "every rea
sonable effort should be made to
bring the project within the terms
and purposes of a comprehensive ac
cord with other governments to
guide the development of Middle
Sast resources."
America's oil policies, according to
Dr. Feis, should safeguard the in
terests and security of the United
States, but at the same time should
benefit other countries and contrib
ute to harmonious international re
lations.
"The United States," Dr. Feis de
clares, "is in a position to face its
future petroleum situation with
calm, but not passive, confidence.
The available world supplies and the
growing mastery over synthetic pro
duction give reasonable assurance
that there will be enough oil to sat
isfy everybody's requirements — if
.hey do not fight over it—for a pe
riod of several decades, which is as
far ahead as human beings can
look."
Discusses Background
After discussing the background
of American foreign policy with re
spect to oil. and the present world
petroleum situation, Dr. Feis out
.ines the possible advantages and
dangers of a government - owned
pipeline in the Middle East.
The pipeline itself should acceler
ate development and use of the Mid
dle Eastern fields ( output of which
is needed to augment world supplies.
"The prospective American demand
for petroleum is so great that domes
tic producers need not fear the com
petitive impact of the new supplies.
Gives Advantages
"Another positive advantage that
might result from the project, if
wisely managed, is that American
control of (he producing fields of
Saudi Arabia and Kuwait would be
made more secure."
The chief disadvantage and risk
•of the pipeline proposal, according
to Dr. Feis, lie in the fact that it
"might easily involve us deeply both
jn the petroleum affairs and the po
jitical affairs of the Middle East."
The announced arrangements, the
author believes, are defective in that

(hey do not place (he government in i
a position effectively to assure the
accomplishment of its aims, and that
certain suggested features may un
necessary arouse the resentment
and opposition of other governments.

"Another positive advantage that
might result from the project, if

The chief disadvantage and risk

to Dr. Feis, lie in the fact that it
"might easily involve us deeply both
jn the petroleum affairs and the po
jitical affairs of the Middle East."
The announced arrangements, the

It is "clearly advisable" that Mid

more fully developed to meet de

lated first step, or it could be a "dis
astrous mistake." This recommenda

Institute.
Dr. Feis was until recently ad
viser on international economic af
fairs in the United States Depart
ment of State and the passage quoted
2S from the publication "Petroleum
and American Foreign Policy," just
published by the Institute.
Outlines Policy
In outlining the major elements
of what should be the American
government's petroleum policy, Dr.
Feis urges that the pipeline proposal
should be revised and "every rea
sonable effort should be made to
bring the project within the terms
and purposes of a comprehensive ac
cord with other governments to
guide the development of Middle
Sast resources."
America's oil policies, according to
Dr. Feis, should safeguard the in
terests and security of the United
States, but at the same time should
benefit other countries and contrib
ute to harmonious international re
lations.
"The United States," Dr. Feis de
clares, "is in a position to face its
future petroleum situation with
calm, but not passive, confidence.
The available world supplies and the
growing mastery over synthetic pro
duction give reasonable assurance
that there will be enough oil to sat
isfy everybody's requirements — if
.hey do not fight over it—for a pe
riod of several decades, which is as
far ahead as human beings can
look."
Discusses Background
After discussing the background
of American foreign policy with re
spect to oil. and the present world
petroleum situation, Dr. Feis out
.ines the possible advantages and
dangers of a government - owned
pipeline in the Middle East.
The pipeline itself should acceler
ate development and use of the Mid
dle Eastern fields ( output of which
is needed to augment world supplies.
"The prospective American demand
for petroleum is so great that domes
tic producers need not fear the com
petitive impact of the new supplies.
