# Surgical Room Needs Workers
## 
### 
The Surgical Dressing Room is
open. Girls who have any extra time
should start working there today and
put in some extra hours before their
classwork gets too heavy, according
to Martha Austin, Red Cross chair
man.
Even those girls who didn'tsign up
last quarter may go over and make
surgical dressings. If they have never
worked before, they may be taught
in a short time.
"We did well last quarter in filling
our quotas. Let's try to do even bet
ter this quarter," said Miss Austin.
The Surgical Dressing Room is up
stairs in the Women's Clubhouse.
