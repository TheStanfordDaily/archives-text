# John Charles Thomas To Give S.F. Recital
## 
### 
John Charles Thomas, famous American baritone of the Metropolitan
Opera who is to sing in San Francisco on April 4. has had a varied career
that has covered four fields of vocal art—beginning wiih light opeia and
continuing through grand opera, concert, and radio.
Thomas was born in the little Pennsylvania town of Meyersdale—the son

of a Methodist minister. As a boy he
sang with his mother and father in
the camp meetings at which his
lather preached. With the father's
duties requiring constant traveling,
the boy received his primary educa
tion in whatever towns they hap
pened to stop.
Later he attended Conway Hall in
Carlisle, Penn. It was here that he
became interested in medicine, so
much so that he had difficulty decid
ing whether he would be a singer or
a physician. At this crucial moment

he was awarded a scholarship by the
Peabody Conservatory in Baltimore
and music won out.
Thrilled in Light Opera
Beginning his career in light opera
his thrilling voice and fine acting
soon won him stardom in such pro
ductions as "Apple Blossoms" and
"Maytime." He also appeared in
numerous Gilbert and Sullivan per
formances including "The Mikado,"
"The Pi rates of Penzance," "Pina
fore," "The Gondoliers."
But though his name was em
blazoned in electric lights on Broad
way and he was one of the highest
paid actors in that field, he had his
mind set on the more'serious form of
his art. By hard study he prepared
himself for opera and launched his
career in this field at the Royal Opera
House in Brussels. Invitations to
sing at Convent Garden in London
and at the opera houses in Berlin and
Vienna followed.
Broadcasts Every Sunday
Returning to the United States, he
soon attained prominence, finally
reaching the position he holds today
as one of America's greatest and most
beloved baritones. He has been a
member of the Metropolitan Opera
Company since 1934 and is currently
featured on The Westinghouse Pro
