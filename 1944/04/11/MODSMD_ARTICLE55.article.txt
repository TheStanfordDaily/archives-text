but that marvelous voice of his has
more stops than a console organ . . . .
and he uses them all.
Chesterfield figures that Fred Wir

Chesterfield program has just been
voted the most popular 15 minutes on
the air for the fifth consecutive year.
John Nesbitt with his PASSING
PARADE has made himself a reputa
