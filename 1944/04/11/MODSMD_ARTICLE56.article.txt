# Hollywood Triumphs in 'Bernadette'
## 
### 
SONG OF BERNADETTE at the
Stanford Theater.
Hollywood's production of Franz
Werfel's novel will probably surprise

movie goers be
cause of the excel
lence with which
it conveys in its
own medium the
difficult story of
the peasant girl
whose simple de
votion surrounds
the legend of the
miraculous waters
of Lourdes.

The story follows Bernadette's life
into a convent and does not concen
trate on the performing of the mir
acle, which is done with surprising
and successful completeness, but has
equal power in the story of the Nun,
who has been one of the last to be
won over by Bernadette's firm faith.
The entire interpretation is one of
a simple story so honestly told that
it is great, and Hollywood, bless
them, has got a collection of faces so
good and so unusual that you will
rub your eyes before believing it.
Supporting Role Good
William Eythe in a small role as
the good friend who believes in Ber
nadette after her momentary disgrace
at the site of the spring, is every bit
as good as the Academy Award win
ner in the title role.
It seems too bad to have to say
that a definite mistake was made in
attempting to reproduce the vision
seen by Bernadette, which in itself
was inadequate and forced the cre
dence of the audience, as otherwise
was never done.â€”Giannini
