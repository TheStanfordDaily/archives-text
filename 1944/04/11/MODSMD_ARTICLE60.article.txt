## Mexican Soldier Faces Trial for High Treason 
### 
MEXICO CITY. April 10 (UP).â€”
A 32-year-old Mexican artillery
lieutenant who today saluted Ma
nuel Avila Camacho, then fired a
.45-caliber pistol point blank at the
president without wounding him,
was held incommunicado to await a
high treason trial for the attempted
assassination.
Newspapers, labor leaders and
government officials immediately
charged it was "a Nazi-Fascist at
tempt to assassinate a friend of the
United Nations." But Camacho said
he believed "this incident repre
sented only one man's feelings."
The officer, Lieut. Antonio E. de
Lama Rojas, a 1939 graduate of the
Mexican Military College, was taken
to the military prison at Santiago
Tlaltelolca. He faced charges of
"iesa patria" or high treason and a
count of assault on his commander
in chief, both charges punishable by
death.
