### MELLON SHELTON 
A total of 2,430 uniformed and ci
vilian students lined up in the Ad
Building yesterday to register for
spring quarter, 1944; .of those stu
dents the women numbered 1,245 and
men 1,186, bringing for probably the
first time to the Farm a ratio of more
women than men. The ratio as it
stands today is just under 1.05
women to every man. Late regis
trants arc expected to swell the total
to more than 2,500 students.
Of the women, 1.195 are civilian
students and nurses in San Francisco
and 50 are WACS; the men include
736 civilians and army and navy
medical students both on campus and
in the city, and 450 are AST. Exact
figures are not available as to the
number of civilian men, but it is
estimated that uniformed medical
students number approximately 80.
War Registration Zig-Zags
Although totals this spring are*not
much below the total of 2,681 of last
spring quarter, they are far from last
quarter's 4,116. The drop from last
quarter's to the present registration
was caused primarily by the de
parture of approximately 1.500 AST's
to active duty; departing civilian men
number only about 66.
The number of women registering
this quarter is slightly less than last
quarter's total of 1.314, but late regis
trants will probably more than till
the balance.
Last spring quarter saw 1.438 men
registering as against 1,243 women,
producing a favorable ratio of 1.15
men to every woman; although bet
ter than today's, it was far below the
traditional 3 to 1 ratio of pre-war
Stanford. The latter was achieved
fall and winter quarters with the
predominance of soldier students on
campus.
Navy uniforms, both sailor and
cadet, figured prominently in the
crowd in the Ad Building yesterday;
calculating Stanford women will be
sorry to learn that they are among
the 80 army and navy medical stu
dents, the majority of which are
studying in the City.

War Registration Zig-Zags
Although totals this spring are*not
much below the total of 2,681 of last
spring quarter, they are far from last
quarter's 4,116. The drop from last
quarter's to the present registration
was caused primarily by the de
parture of approximately 1.500 AST's
to active duty; departing civilian men
number only about 66.
The number of women registering
this quarter is slightly less than last
quarter's total of 1.314, but late regis
trants will probably more than till
the balance.
Last spring quarter saw 1.438 men
registering as against 1,243 women,
producing a favorable ratio of 1.15
men to every woman; although bet
ter than today's, it was far below the
traditional 3 to 1 ratio of pre-war
Stanford. The latter was achieved
fall and winter quarters with the
predominance of soldier students on
campus.
Navy uniforms, both sailor and
cadet, figured prominently in the
crowd in the Ad Building yesterday;
calculating Stanford women will be
sorry to learn that they are among
the 80 army and navy medical stu
dents, the majority of which are
studying in the City.
