# New Order Takes 2-A's
## 
### 
| Occupational deferment of those
j under educational classifications has
j been rescinded, the Office of the
President has been officially advised.
In word received from Washington,
D.C., all deferments on Activity and
Occupational Bulletin No. 33-6,
which includes deferments fon*those
training in professional courses such
as engineering, medicine, dentistry,
| veterinary, osteopathy, and theology,
i will be canceled.
A statement has also been received
from Washington, however, that the
I question of continued deferment of
| students in certain of these profes
j sional and pre-professional fields is
j to be reconsidered.
Definite Word
"We expect to get definite word in
a few days," it was announced by the
: President's Office. In the meantime,
â– it has been advised that those stu
j dents who would be affected by the
i new rulings should not take any im
! mediate action until the situation has
' been looked into more fully and the
next best procedure has been ascer
tained.
"As I understand it, this is not
final action," Dr. Donald B. Tresid
der, president of the University,
stated. "Evidently this action which
the government is taking is a "clear
ing of the boards" for something
which is to come, and it does not,
mean that everyone is to be suddenly
thrown out of the University without
any chance of deferment."
Before July 1
An announcement has come to the
attention of the Daily that "pre
professional students will be deferred
only if they can enter a recognized
school of medicine, dentistry, veter
inary medicine, osteopathy, or theol
| ogy before July 1." This announce
j ment further stated that students in
I professional schools, internees (who
' shall have finished their interneship
within nine months), and under
graduates in certain engineering and
scientific courses who will graduate
before July 1 will also be deferred.
This announcement seems to be
further evidence of what Dr. Tresia
der said concerning the pending ac
tion on the part of the government.
Quota Almost Reached
In as much as there are still some
types of occupational deferment not
hindered by this ruling, and since the
1 quota of about 7,000,000 men in the
| armed forces has almost been
J reached, the situation may not be as
! bad as it first seemed; but it is cer
tain that there will be many who do
; not get re-deferred.
