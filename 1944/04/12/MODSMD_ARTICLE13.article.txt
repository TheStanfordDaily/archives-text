# The 						Fall of the Ratio
## 
### 
FOR THE FIRST TIME since World War I the ratio is in reverse, j
The famous 3 men to 1 woman now reads 1.1 women to 1 man. I
Now it is open to debate just what one could do with 1.1;
women but it was very clear indeed on the other hand what one
could do with three men.
The Fall of the Ratio. Indeed a catacylism in our small world. [
Or so it would have been a few short years ago. But now we are j
all secretly amazed that the Ratio has held out so long. And even
more so that there should still be 1,202 men able to go to Leland
Stanford Junior.
It does seem strangely quiet though this quarter. Just not
enough "Hup, two, three, four's" to seem natural. But then we
may get used to it somehow. For, though it doesn't seem possible, i
it was less than a year ago that the "Hup, two, three, four" came
to Stanford.
So with a short tear for the passing of the Hup and the Fall of
the Ratio we reflect that things really ain't so bad after all. Why
you may even find an empty seat or two in the Libe these days, j
What more could one ask of life?— Nancy Tilden
