Fiesta time at Stanford will be j
|
held this Friday, when the Farm will i
celebrate Pan-American Day, ob- 1
served by all the 21 American repub- j
lies of the Pan-American Union. The j
outstanding feature of the day will |

do es Michoacan!", the action of i
which takes place in Mexico's Pacific j
state of Michoacan, especially around j
the picturesque Lake Patzcuaro.

who stars in the picture, appears us a
young sawmill owner. The sccnes, j
filmed on location by special ar
rangement with the governor of the
state of Michoacan and the mayor of
the town of Patzcuaro, form the set
ting for Guizar's romance with Gloria
Marin, owner of a nearby ranch.

population of the region around Lake j
Patzcuaro is of Tarascan Indians, j

the customs and ways of life which ;
their ancestors practiced.

photography in portraying the scenic j
aspects of the lake and the surround
ing countryside.
Fishing has been the traditional
means of livelihood of the lake In
dians for centuries. The film shows

tures the people in their holiday j
moods.
