# Shippers Lauded For Cooperation

### 
Teamwork between the railroads
and government and commercial j
shippers is making it possible for Ihe !
carriers to move the tremendous war
load, according to W. W. Hale, vice
president in charge of system freight
traffic for the Southern Pacific Co.
Hale pointed out that shippers are
helping in many waysâ€”by not or- j
dering more cars than needed, by i
loading cars heavily, and by re
leasing them quickly.
"As a result of the tremendous
emergency traffic," he said, "the rail
roads have received very large total
revenues, but their expenses have in
creased in even larger proportion.
Therefore, while 1943 revenues ex
ceeded the former record of 1942, the j
net income in 1943 was substantially
lower."
