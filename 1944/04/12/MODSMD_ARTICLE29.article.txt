# WAR FRONTS
## Giant Air Fleet Smashes Inland Nazi Factories 
### 
LONDON (UP)â€”A giant fleet of
2,000 U.S. heavy bombers and fight
ers pounded deep into central Ger
many today, smashing at least two
vital Nazi aircraft plants at the ap
proach to Berlin, in the wake of un
precedented 4,032-ton RAF assault
against continental railway hubs.
Carrying into its fourth straight
day one of the mightiest pre-invasion
blitzes against northern Europe, per
haps 2,000 to 2,500 American planes
of all types roared over Germany,
France, and Belgium throughout the
day. Nazi opposition was weak, al
though 200 or more heavy bombers
and an equal number of Nazi fighters
tangled in a fierce 45-minute aerial
duel over one target.
