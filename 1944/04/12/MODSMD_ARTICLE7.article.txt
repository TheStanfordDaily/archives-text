# Concert Series Presents Bidu Sayao Tomorrow
## 
### ANNE BUBB 
Tickets are still on sale in the Conceit Series office for the Bidu Sayao
concert this coming Thursday night. Miss Sayao will be a guest of Stanford
on two accounts: one, as a star in the concert series, and the other as a
representative from South America during Pan-American week.
Born in Brazil, Miss Sayao's fame'is international. She is not only an

opera star and concert singer but
also an accomplished linguist, who
speaks besides her native language,
Portuguese, French, Spanish, Eng
lish, and Italian.
Of her early years Miss Sayao tells
that her parents wished her to be
come a pianist. She, however, wish
ing to study singing took her first
voice lessons unknown to her par
ents, and only after she had been
studying for several months did she
tell her parents of her intention.
Miss Sayao made her debut in her
native town of Kio de Janeiro. She
then sailed to Europe where she ap
peared in operas in both Italy and
France. After a coveted operatic en
gagement in Buenos Aires, she sailed
to America and was introduced to the
American public by Toscanini. A
Metropolitan Opera contract was the
next step in her career.
Miss Sayao, active in both opera
and concert, prefers the latter, be
cause she feels that it is more difficult
for a singer than the former. Miss
Sayao thinks that in an opera she
acts a prescribed part, while on the
concert stage she must be herself,
carrying over to the audience the
same emotional intensity as in the
opera.
