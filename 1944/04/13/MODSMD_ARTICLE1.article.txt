# Salvemini Censures King Emmanuel in Series Talk
## 
### JIM WEINBERG 
Dr. Gaetano Salvemini, noted Ital
ian educator and anti-Fascist, Tues
day night delivered a bitter invective
against the Italian king and against
the British-American policy of forc
ing him upon the Italian people.
Salvemini's lecture on "America at
the Crossroads in Italy" was the
opening event on Stanford's Tuesday
Evening Series for spring quarter.
Dr. Salvemini began his address by
citing examples from history in
which royal houses have fallen after
military defeat. It would be strange
indeed, he said, if the house of Savoy
were to survie the present war.
The king has been an accessory be
fore. during, and after all of Musso
lini's crimes. "No honest man can
condemn Mussolini without con
demning the king also," Salvemini
asserted.
The King of Italy and his son have
lost the respect and earned the con
tempt of the Italian people, Salve
mini continued. The king committed
an overt act of perfidy and treachery
by betraying Hitler. Betraying a
criminal does not make one a gentle
man.
Dr. Salvemini went on to criticize
severely the British-American policy
in Italy. He believes that the people

of Italy should be permitted to re
organize their government them
selves, and that if they are permitted
to do so, they will set up a republi
can government.
However, nobody in Italy expects
or wants the Americans or British to
import a republican government and
force it on the Italians â€”it must arise
as the free choice of the majority of
the people.
Thus far the Americans and the
British have not supported (he rise
\ of a republic in Italy, but have forced
the old royal government back on
| them. ''In return for goods they did
not possess and could not deliver,
: the king and Badoglio were taken
J under the protection of the Anglo
j Saxons."
Salvemini warned that the Allies
I are courting disaster by following
i their present policy in Italy. There
I is still hope, however, if we will only
] learn the lessons which are to be
I derived from our past mistakes.
"Experience is the best master if one
| is prepared to learn by it."
Dr. Salvemini answered questions
| from the floor at the conclusion of his
' prepared lecture. Dr. Lewis Mum
ford, who had introduced Salvemini,
j acted as moderator during the ques
tion period.
