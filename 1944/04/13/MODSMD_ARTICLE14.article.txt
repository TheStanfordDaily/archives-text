IT WAS REPORTED by radio last night that Sol Bloom, Chairman
of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, will introduce a bill to
day to amend the Constitution so that the President would have
the power to make and ratify treaties with other nations without
the consent of the Senate.
The bill is designed to prevent political obstruction of United
States plans for postwar international cooperation; cooperation
politically, economically, and socially. The proposal may be
doomed, but it is a step in the right direction, for if the Consti
tution were amended to permit the President to make and ratify
treaties without political pressure or interference, many of the
obstacles encountered by our State Department in the formula
tion of a consistent foreign policy would be overcome.
Opponents of the amendment will of course say that such
power in the hands of one man is suicidally dangerous, is just
what we're fighting against, etc. But, the nation should recognize
popularly that the power held by the Senators in respect to the
ratification of foreign treaties is egually as dangerous.
The amendment suggestion might meet with more approval
if such extreme power were delegated to an independent agency,
composed of responsible and able men, whose sole job would be
the investigation, formation, and recommendation of treaties. If
this body, for example, recommended a treaty, it would become
law on the President's signature.
But no matter what Congress does, it should lay, and thor
oughly lay, the ghost of Hendy Lodge.—Dave Davis
