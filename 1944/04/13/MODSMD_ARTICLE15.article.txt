For the benefit of the few new and many old students who have
not yet had the opportunity to visit the Hoover Home, we are
going to point out the easiest way to get to this well known tourist
Mecca. This is probably the first time that directions to the
Hoover Home have been compiled since a well known Bay Area
map maker became hopelessly schizophrenic in 1935.
Herbert Hoover does not live in the Hoover Home, however;
Dr. Tresidder lives in the Hoover Home. Chancellor Ray Lyman
Wilbur lives in the Graham Stuart home and by process of elim
ination we might assume that Graham Stuart lives in the Tresid
der home. Dr. Stuart, however, is on leave of absence and we are
unable at present to clear up that part of the picture.
Dr. Byrd Cage who has lived at G37 Alvarado Road for many
years, strange as it may seem, still lives at 637 Alvarado Road
and intends to remain there in the future.
Dr. Cage remarked in an interview late yesterday afternoon
that he had no idea how this rumor about his moving got started,
and he wants his friends to know that he has no intention of
moving whatsoever, and that he has never had such intentions
nor intends to have such intentions.
Herbert Hoover, it will be remembered, was a member of the
first graduating class of Stanford University and students have
been stopped for years by thousands of tourists seeking direc
tions to his home on the campus. At one time Hoover was Presi
dent of the United States.
Getting back to the directions, first you go to the Post Office,
which may be recognized by its tile roof, ride up Lasuen toward
the setting sun. These plans are for an afternoon tour.
You drive up Lasuen a couple of blocks and take the second
street to the right or is it that fork in the road. On the other hand,
some people like the Gerona Road method. This method, like
the Salvatierra method is somewhat round-about. In any case
you turn to the left 01 if you are on the Row, you turn to the right.
Or is it the left?
Hey, leggo my arm, I'm all right.
