(Editor's Note:—This is a letter re
ceived from Lieut. Louis S. Means of
the Army Air Corps who graduated
from Stanford in June 1 ?)41. enlisted
as an Aviation Cadet in October of
the same year, received his commis
sion in the summer of '42. went over
seas in March f!)43 and was shot
down two months later over Ger
many when acting as a Navigator on
a C-17 bomber. The letter describes
this last flight and his treatment on
landing.)
"We had just returned from an en
joyable 48-hour pass in London, a
bit tired and ready for bed. Though
it was nearly midnight. I decided to
write a quick V-mail letter to my
wife, just in the event we were called
on a mission the following morning
and might not come back.
"I also made the remark to my
bombardier that I'd settle to come
out of "this mess" with a bunged up
arm or leg and consider myself lucky.
Little did I realize that these two
foreboding, warnings of the subcon
scious would become realities before
another 12 hours had passed.
Wakened at 3:30 a.m.
"At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened,
told to dress and eat and be in the
briefing room an hour later. Sleepy
cis we were, the prospect of a mission
set us on edge and we hurried
through preparations to take to the
air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Ger m a ny, with
takeoff set for 7 o'clock.
"Everything went smoothly and by
8 a.m. we had completed our rendez
vous with several other groups and
were heading northwest over the
English Channel. We were soon deep
out over a cloudless North Sea, flying
at an altitude of 23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful siinrise.
First Sight bl Land
"We caught first sight of land at 10
a.m. It was the island of Helgoland,
air and naval base of the enemy off
the German coast. The first few
bursts of flak appeared, presumably
from this island, but all fell short of

' the group and no hits were scored.
"As we neared the mainland, our
! vapor trails became so thick they
I looked like smoke screens laid by
! protective destroyers around us.
| "Spanky," my bombardier, and my
i self were wearing our arms out try-
I ing to keep the nose windows free
; from ice. It was 10:30 when the main
land appeared, and we knew our
target was but a short half-hour
i away. In the air, however, even a
I minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 O'Clock
"Just then our interphone began
ringing with excited voices: "Three
fighters at 10 o'clock, seven ME's
(Messerschmit fighters) at 2 o'clock,
10 coming in at 5 o'clock, four fight
ers high at 8," and so forth! Before
one could count to 10 they were all
around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out
| a fiery welcome whenever they came
I within range. Dark puffs of flak be
i gan to appear above and below us,
! to the front and behind us as the
i shore batteries began to pick up our
| group with deadly accuracy.
"As I watched the exciting scene,
| our left wing ship nosed downward
in a gentle dive, flames pouring from
! the cabin windows. This was the
| "fort" piloted by Lt. "Dopey" Mann,
| the first of three in our group to meet
i destruction by German guns that
! day. The ship had evidently been hit
i by a direct flak burst.
! A Sudden Jolt
"I jumped to the right nose gun to
1 intercept a fighter coming in at about
2 o'clock and had just begun firing
when, "bam," a sudden jolt and pain
I sent me sprawling on the floor. Either
I flak or a 20-millimeter cannon shell
had burst in the center of my ammu
| nition can and dozens of fragments
; from the explosion had blown into
i my right leg. At the same time the
plane lurched from the formation
seemingly out of control. My oxygen
system had begun to burn, and red
hydraulic fluid began to drip down
, from beneath the pilot's cockpit, so
the ship had evidently been badly
! hit.
"I called Clemons, the pilot, and
told him I was badly wounded and
without oxygen. He told me to pre
pare to bail out and a few seconds
later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled
back to the front escape hatch and
pulled the safety release, but the
door refused to fall off. Finally in
I desperation I forced my way through
the door against the terrific wind

stream—a good example oi' the super- j
human strength a man has when his |
life is at stake.
"Don't Pull Too Soon"
As I fell ihrough space my mind j
cleared, and my one thought was not '
to pull the ripcord too soon or I j
might die from lack of oxygen since 1
I had already been without it for |
several minutes. At approximately
8.000 feet after a free fall of some
15,000 feet, I gave a silent prayer and
pulled the cord. "Smack," my chest
chute hit me in the mouth as it pulled
open, but what a relief to see that 1
shielding parasol of white silk sway
ing above me. I kept oscillating in
great arcs all the way down, but
didn't try to steady myself with the I
shroud lines for fear of spilling the
chute.
"As I was over water at the time,
I tore off my hat, oxygen mask,
throat mike, gloves, and boots, and
inflated my Mae West life vest. At j
last I felt free to look above me. No j
planes could be seen anywhere—
only the long fading vapor trails far
overhead. I could see no other chutes
in the air or hear a sound. It was like J
being all alone in a soundless vac- I
uum.
Played Very Dead
"At about 3.000 feet, I could see I j
was drifting in over a point of land— |
what a relief! A few seconds later j
an Melo9 circled me, and once again
I thought maybe my number was !
up. I played very dead, thinking the
pilot meant to finish me off. but to i
my surprise he gave a friendly wave
as he roared by. Evidently he had
just taken my picture to confirm vic
tory.
"My next fear was that I was go
ing to land in the very center of the j
town below me but gradually I blew
to its outskirts as my descent neared :
its end. Those last 50 feet passed as
if I were in an express elevator, and !
"thud there I was flat on my back J
in a little grassy garden plot be- i
tween two houses. Once again Ihe j
iar had nearly knocked me out. but i
1 recovered quickly and hastily un- '
buckled my chute so I wouldn't be
dragged along by a breeze.
Old l ady Waved
"The first person I saw was an old
lady who waved to me from over the
hedge a few yards away. Soon I j
could .see people running toward the
spot from every direction. It was all
like a movie or a bad dream. With
the clicking of polished heels and the
shouts of ''Heil Hitler'' as each new j

person ran up, I realized all too
clearly I was now resting on German
soil. But what a different reception
than I had expected. Within a few
minutes I had a hot cup of tea in my
hand while a young girl was slitting
my pants leg and giving first aid to
my wounds.
"My first attempt at speaking Ger
man, "Mein Fusz sind Kalt," brought
immediate results. They wrapped
my legs in my parachute to keep
them warm, and told me the ambu
lance would arrive in 10 minutes to
take me to the hospital. The ambu
lance did arrive, and half an hour
later I was on the operating table of
the big naval hospital in Cuxhaven
tended by a surgeon who spoke per
fect English.

nine months in German hospitals
and the main Air Force Prisoner-of-
War-Camp (Stalag Suit 3). he was
repatriated t«. the United States, At
present he is on a 30-day leave with
his wife (the former Elizabeth Rob
bins. class of '42) and five-month-old
baby boy. On expiration of his leave
he plans to return to Bnshnell Hos
pital. Brig-ham. Utah, to be fitted with
an artificial leg. He expects then to
take a medical discharge and return
to civilian life.

I had already been without it for |
several minutes. At approximately
8.000 feet after a free fall of some

throat mike, gloves, and boots, and

only the long fading vapor trails far

another 12 hours had passed.
Wakened at 3:30 a.m.
"At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened,
told to dress and eat and be in the
briefing room an hour later. Sleepy
cis we were, the prospect of a mission
set us on edge and we hurried
through preparations to take to the
air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Ger m a ny, with
takeoff set for 7 o'clock.
"Everything went smoothly and by
8 a.m. we had completed our rendez
vous with several other groups and
were heading northwest over the
English Channel. We were soon deep
out over a cloudless North Sea, flying
at an altitude of 23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful siinrise.
First Sight bl Land
"We caught first sight of land at 10
a.m. It was the island of Helgoland,
air and naval base of the enemy off
the German coast. The first few
bursts of flak appeared, presumably
from this island, but all fell short of

' the group and no hits were scored.
"As we neared the mainland, our
! vapor trails became so thick they
I looked like smoke screens laid by
! protective destroyers around us.
| "Spanky," my bombardier, and my
i self were wearing our arms out try-
I ing to keep the nose windows free
; from ice. It was 10:30 when the main
land appeared, and we knew our
target was but a short half-hour
i away. In the air, however, even a
I minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 O'Clock
"Just then our interphone began
ringing with excited voices: "Three
fighters at 10 o'clock, seven ME's
(Messerschmit fighters) at 2 o'clock,
10 coming in at 5 o'clock, four fight
ers high at 8," and so forth! Before
one could count to 10 they were all
around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out
| a fiery welcome whenever they came
I within range. Dark puffs of flak be
i gan to appear above and below us,
! to the front and behind us as the
i shore batteries began to pick up our
| group with deadly accuracy.
"As I watched the exciting scene,
| our left wing ship nosed downward
in a gentle dive, flames pouring from
! the cabin windows. This was the
| "fort" piloted by Lt. "Dopey" Mann,
| the first of three in our group to meet
i destruction by German guns that
! day. The ship had evidently been hit
i by a direct flak burst.
! A Sudden Jolt
"I jumped to the right nose gun to
1 intercept a fighter coming in at about
2 o'clock and had just begun firing
when, "bam," a sudden jolt and pain
I sent me sprawling on the floor. Either
I flak or a 20-millimeter cannon shell
had burst in the center of my ammu
| nition can and dozens of fragments
; from the explosion had blown into
i my right leg. At the same time the
plane lurched from the formation
seemingly out of control. My oxygen
system had begun to burn, and red
hydraulic fluid began to drip down
, from beneath the pilot's cockpit, so
the ship had evidently been badly
! hit.
"I called Clemons, the pilot, and
told him I was badly wounded and
without oxygen. He told me to pre
pare to bail out and a few seconds
later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled
back to the front escape hatch and
pulled the safety release, but the
door refused to fall off. Finally in

another 12 hours had passed.
Wakened at 3:30 a.m.
"At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened,
told to dress and eat and be in the
briefing room an hour later. Sleepy
cis we were, the prospect of a mission
set us on edge and we hurried
through preparations to take to the
air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Ger m a ny, with
takeoff set for 7 o'clock.
"Everything went smoothly and by
8 a.m. we had completed our rendez
vous with several other groups and
were heading northwest over the
English Channel. We were soon deep
out over a cloudless North Sea, flying
at an altitude of 23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful siinrise.
First Sight bl Land
"We caught first sight of land at 10
a.m. It was the island of Helgoland,
air and naval base of the enemy off
the German coast. The first few
bursts of flak appeared, presumably
from this island, but all fell short of

' the group and no hits were scored.
"As we neared the mainland, our
! vapor trails became so thick they
I looked like smoke screens laid by
! protective destroyers around us.
| "Spanky," my bombardier, and my
i self were wearing our arms out try-
I ing to keep the nose windows free
; from ice. It was 10:30 when the main
land appeared, and we knew our
target was but a short half-hour
i away. In the air, however, even a
I minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 O'Clock
"Just then our interphone began
ringing with excited voices: "Three
fighters at 10 o'clock, seven ME's
(Messerschmit fighters) at 2 o'clock,
10 coming in at 5 o'clock, four fight
ers high at 8," and so forth! Before
one could count to 10 they were all
around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out
| a fiery welcome whenever they came
I within range. Dark puffs of flak be
i gan to appear above and below us,
! to the front and behind us as the
i shore batteries began to pick up our
| group with deadly accuracy.
"As I watched the exciting scene,
| our left wing ship nosed downward
in a gentle dive, flames pouring from
! the cabin windows. This was the
| "fort" piloted by Lt. "Dopey" Mann,
| the first of three in our group to meet
i destruction by German guns that
! day. The ship had evidently been hit
i by a direct flak burst.
! A Sudden Jolt
"I jumped to the right nose gun to
1 intercept a fighter coming in at about
2 o'clock and had just begun firing
when, "bam," a sudden jolt and pain
I sent me sprawling on the floor. Either
I flak or a 20-millimeter cannon shell
had burst in the center of my ammu
| nition can and dozens of fragments
; from the explosion had blown into
i my right leg. At the same time the
plane lurched from the formation
seemingly out of control. My oxygen
system had begun to burn, and red
hydraulic fluid began to drip down
, from beneath the pilot's cockpit, so
the ship had evidently been badly
! hit.
"I called Clemons, the pilot, and
told him I was badly wounded and
without oxygen. He told me to pre
pare to bail out and a few seconds
later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled
back to the front escape hatch and
pulled the safety release, but the
door refused to fall off. Finally in
I desperation I forced my way through
the door against the terrific wind

stream—a good example oi' the super- j
human strength a man has when his |
life is at stake.
"Don't Pull Too Soon"
As I fell ihrough space my mind j
cleared, and my one thought was not '
to pull the ripcord too soon or I j
might die from lack of oxygen since 1
I had already been without it for |
several minutes. At approximately
8.000 feet after a free fall of some
15,000 feet, I gave a silent prayer and
pulled the cord. "Smack," my chest

open, but what a relief to see that 1

"As I was over water at the time,
I tore off my hat, oxygen mask,
throat mike, gloves, and boots, and
inflated my Mae West life vest. At j
last I felt free to look above me. No j
planes could be seen anywhere—
only the long fading vapor trails far
overhead. I could see no other chutes
in the air or hear a sound. It was like J
being all alone in a soundless vac- I

"At about 3.000 feet, I could see I j
was drifting in over a point of land— |
what a relief! A few seconds later j

the clicking of polished heels and the
shouts of ''Heil Hitler'' as each new j

person ran up, I realized all too
clearly I was now resting on German

"At 3:30 a.m. we were awakened,
told to dress and eat and be in the
briefing room an hour later. Sleepy
cis we were, the prospect of a mission
set us on edge and we hurried
through preparations to take to the
air. The briefing gave our targets as
Wilhelmshaven, Ger m a ny, with
takeoff set for 7 o'clock.

were heading northwest over the
English Channel. We were soon deep
out over a cloudless North Sea, flying
at an altitude of 23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful siinrise.
First Sight bl Land
"We caught first sight of land at 10
a.m. It was the island of Helgoland,
air and naval base of the enemy off
the German coast. The first few
bursts of flak appeared, presumably
from this island, but all fell short of

' the group and no hits were scored.
"As we neared the mainland, our
! vapor trails became so thick they
I looked like smoke screens laid by

i self were wearing our arms out try-

; from ice. It was 10:30 when the main
land appeared, and we knew our

i away. In the air, however, even a
I minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 O'Clock
"Just then our interphone began
ringing with excited voices: "Three
fighters at 10 o'clock, seven ME's
(Messerschmit fighters) at 2 o'clock,
10 coming in at 5 o'clock, four fight
ers high at 8," and so forth! Before
one could count to 10 they were all
around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out
| a fiery welcome whenever they came
I within range. Dark puffs of flak be
i gan to appear above and below us,
! to the front and behind us as the
i shore batteries began to pick up our
| group with deadly accuracy.
"As I watched the exciting scene,
| our left wing ship nosed downward
in a gentle dive, flames pouring from
! the cabin windows. This was the
| "fort" piloted by Lt. "Dopey" Mann,
| the first of three in our group to meet
i destruction by German guns that
! day. The ship had evidently been hit
i by a direct flak burst.
! A Sudden Jolt
"I jumped to the right nose gun to
1 intercept a fighter coming in at about
2 o'clock and had just begun firing
when, "bam," a sudden jolt and pain
I sent me sprawling on the floor. Either
I flak or a 20-millimeter cannon shell
had burst in the center of my ammu
| nition can and dozens of fragments
; from the explosion had blown into
i my right leg. At the same time the
plane lurched from the formation
seemingly out of control. My oxygen
system had begun to burn, and red
hydraulic fluid began to drip down
, from beneath the pilot's cockpit, so
the ship had evidently been badly
! hit.
"I called Clemons, the pilot, and
told him I was badly wounded and
without oxygen. He told me to pre
pare to bail out and a few seconds
later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled
back to the front escape hatch and
pulled the safety release, but the
door refused to fall off. Finally in
I desperation I forced my way through
the door against the terrific wind

stream—a good example oi' the super- j
human strength a man has when his |
life is at stake.

As I fell ihrough space my mind j

I had already been without it for |
several minutes. At approximately
8.000 feet after a free fall of some

at an altitude of 23,000 feet and
watching a beautiful siinrise.
First Sight bl Land
"We caught first sight of land at 10
a.m. It was the island of Helgoland,
air and naval base of the enemy off
the German coast. The first few
bursts of flak appeared, presumably
from this island, but all fell short of

' the group and no hits were scored.
"As we neared the mainland, our
! vapor trails became so thick they
I looked like smoke screens laid by
! protective destroyers around us.
| "Spanky," my bombardier, and my
i self were wearing our arms out try-
I ing to keep the nose windows free
; from ice. It was 10:30 when the main
land appeared, and we knew our
target was but a short half-hour
i away. In the air, however, even a
I minute may seem an eternity.
Fighters at 10 O'Clock
"Just then our interphone began
ringing with excited voices: "Three
fighters at 10 o'clock, seven ME's
(Messerschmit fighters) at 2 o'clock,
10 coming in at 5 o'clock, four fight
ers high at 8," and so forth! Before
one could count to 10 they were all
around us, diving, twisting, firing,
turning, our own guns spatting out
| a fiery welcome whenever they came
I within range. Dark puffs of flak be
i gan to appear above and below us,
! to the front and behind us as the
i shore batteries began to pick up our
| group with deadly accuracy.
"As I watched the exciting scene,
| our left wing ship nosed downward
in a gentle dive, flames pouring from
! the cabin windows. This was the
| "fort" piloted by Lt. "Dopey" Mann,
| the first of three in our group to meet
i destruction by German guns that
! day. The ship had evidently been hit
i by a direct flak burst.
! A Sudden Jolt
"I jumped to the right nose gun to
1 intercept a fighter coming in at about
2 o'clock and had just begun firing
when, "bam," a sudden jolt and pain
I sent me sprawling on the floor. Either
I flak or a 20-millimeter cannon shell
had burst in the center of my ammu
| nition can and dozens of fragments
; from the explosion had blown into
i my right leg. At the same time the
plane lurched from the formation
seemingly out of control. My oxygen
system had begun to burn, and red
hydraulic fluid began to drip down
, from beneath the pilot's cockpit, so
the ship had evidently been badly
! hit.
"I called Clemons, the pilot, and
told him I was badly wounded and
without oxygen. He told me to pre
pare to bail out and a few seconds
later the order to "abandon ship"
came over the interphone. I crawled
back to the front escape hatch and
pulled the safety release, but the
door refused to fall off. Finally in
I desperation I forced my way through
the door against the terrific wind

stream—a good example oi' the super- j
human strength a man has when his |
life is at stake.
"Don't Pull Too Soon"
As I fell ihrough space my mind j
cleared, and my one thought was not '
to pull the ripcord too soon or I j
might die from lack of oxygen since 1
I had already been without it for |
several minutes. At approximately
8.000 feet after a free fall of some
15,000 feet, I gave a silent prayer and
pulled the cord. "Smack," my chest
chute hit me in the mouth as it pulled
open, but what a relief to see that 1
shielding parasol of white silk sway
ing above me. I kept oscillating in
great arcs all the way down, but
didn't try to steady myself with the I
shroud lines for fear of spilling the
chute.
"As I was over water at the time,
I tore off my hat, oxygen mask,
throat mike, gloves, and boots, and
inflated my Mae West life vest. At j
last I felt free to look above me. No j
planes could be seen anywhere—
only the long fading vapor trails far
overhead. I could see no other chutes
in the air or hear a sound. It was like J
being all alone in a soundless vac- I
uum.
Played Very Dead
"At about 3.000 feet, I could see I j
was drifting in over a point of land— |
what a relief! A few seconds later j
an Melo9 circled me, and once again
I thought maybe my number was !
up. I played very dead, thinking the
pilot meant to finish me off. but to i
my surprise he gave a friendly wave
as he roared by. Evidently he had
just taken my picture to confirm vic
tory.
"My next fear was that I was go
ing to land in the very center of the j
town below me but gradually I blew
to its outskirts as my descent neared :
its end. Those last 50 feet passed as
if I were in an express elevator, and !
"thud there I was flat on my back J
in a little grassy garden plot be- i
tween two houses. Once again Ihe j
iar had nearly knocked me out. but i
1 recovered quickly and hastily un- '
buckled my chute so I wouldn't be
dragged along by a breeze.
Old l ady Waved
"The first person I saw was an old
lady who waved to me from over the
hedge a few yards away. Soon I j
could .see people running toward the
spot from every direction. It was all
like a movie or a bad dream. With
the clicking of polished heels and the
shouts of ''Heil Hitler'' as each new j

person ran up, I realized all too
clearly I was now resting on German
soil. But what a different reception
than I had expected. Within a few
minutes I had a hot cup of tea in my
hand while a young girl was slitting
my pants leg and giving first aid to
my wounds.
"My first attempt at speaking Ger
man, "Mein Fusz sind Kalt," brought
immediate results. They wrapped
my legs in my parachute to keep
them warm, and told me the ambu
lance would arrive in 10 minutes to
take me to the hospital. The ambu
lance did arrive, and half an hour
later I was on the operating table of
the big naval hospital in Cuxhaven

fect English.
