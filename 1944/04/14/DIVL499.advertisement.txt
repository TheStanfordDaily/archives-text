Next to the "Opera Ticket Office" and the "Free
French Booth" we have just opened the "French
Book Store" featuring:
• A rare collection of illustrated Art Books.
• The Christmas numbers of L' Illustration" from
1929 to 1939, a limited quantity of each. As
they cannot be imported any more, they grow
rarer every day.
• Also a complete selection of fiction and non
fiction, biographies, poetry, detective stories,
literature, dictionaries.
• For children : a complete collection of illustrated
books imported from France before the war—
geography, History of the Kings of France,
