# Culture With Classes
## 
### 
ALTHOUGH we sometimes seem to forget
it, we as students at Stanford are among the
most fortunate people in the world. We are
fortunate primarily because we are here at a
university with the opportunity to learn, to
grow and to prepare ourselves for things to
come. And only secondary in importance to
that, we are more than fortunate in being on
a campus which fosters cultural events and
within an hour of a larger center of art, music
and the theatre, San Francisco.
Just to glance at the weekly program of
events scheduled on campus and then at the
wide variety of plays, musical presentations
and art exhibits at present and for the coming
weeks in San Francisco, it is amazing to realize
what is being offered, and more than that, how
much we should take advantage of them all.
At Stanford alone, there is the regular Tuesday
Evening Series with its speakers on world
events, on literature, on travel, and frequent
interpretations of phases of the war, not to
mention the quarterly concert series, of which
last night's was one of the best. Then too,
there are the string quartets which will be
repeated next Tuesday evening, and also the
interesting Chinese art exhibits in the Gallery
across from history corner.
Laurence Tibbets sang last Tuesday in San
Jose, only half an hour away, and will be fol
lowed in the next few weeks by other out
standing artists.
A short glance at the entertainment section
of any San Francisco newspaper proves very
encouraging, for besides the coming light opera
performances, musical groups are constantly
presenting artists on tour. In addition, an extra
Saturday or Sunday afternoon in the city can
always be spent at either the De Young or
Veterans' Auditorium Art Museums, where
either famous original art objects or interesting
exhibits of modern art are being shown.
With the admission that nothing is worse
than a pep-talk on "culture" it can be added
that with the idea that we are the only people
of our age in the world who are free to see
such exhibits, to go to plays and concerts, and
that they are all so close at hand, we should
certainly make the most of them. We have the
cultural leaves, so let's use them.â€”Ewell Sale.
