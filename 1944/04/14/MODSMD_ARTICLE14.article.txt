# The 						Calico Cat
## 
### 
THE STANFORD FAMILY is growing in
kind if not in size. Take a look at those regis
tration figures and you will see that we are
really beginning to cover the field.
We have with us this quarter 415 ASTs, re
minder of the once vast Khaki Horde, 787 civil
ian men, 39 WACs, 1,301 miscellaneous women,
and 23 midshipmen in their first year of Navy
medical training.
This is indeed an impressive collection. We

are becoming as cosmopolitan as the famed
calico cat.
Given a base of civilian men and women,
we season strongly with AST and then add
just a dash of \yAC and Navy V-12 for that
incomparable flavor. And what have we got? ;
Stanford University and all of them Stanford
men and women. And let us hope that we can 1
make them feel so, a part of that famed Stan
ford family, a necessary part of a valuable!
whole. â€”Nancy Tilden
