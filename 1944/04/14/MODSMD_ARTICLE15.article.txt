# Staff Meeting Sunday
## 
### 
AS THE new guarter rolls around, comes
time for our first Staff meeting of the spring.
The time is still 12:30, the place the Shack, and
the day Sunday. The edit board hopes that all
staff members will come over, as new policies,
new appointments and very necessary future
plans must be made.
You staff members are the students who
keep the Daily on schedule, and therefore it is
most important that you offer suggestions as
to the best road to take. As the saying goes,
no organization is better than the staff of which
it is composed.
