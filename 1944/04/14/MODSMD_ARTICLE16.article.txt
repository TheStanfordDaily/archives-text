"In my opinion football has degenerated
from the clean-cut, high type sport of the turn
of the century into a dangerous, physically
harmful orgy." So stated the janitor at Uncle
John's Bayshore Mineral Springs.
"In football," he continued, "too many seri
ous injuries result from close bodily contact.
I propose that intercollegiate football be re
placed by a sport popular for centuries in the
Kentucky mountainsâ€”DAlD CHICKUN." 1
The game of Daid Chickun is played on a
block square field upon which numerous ob
stacles such as large rocks, overturned wagons,
and tree stumps are placed. Each team, com
posed of nine players, takes one end of the
field and commences firing at members of the j
other team with their Spaulding Special Daid
Chickun Flint-lock Racquet. When a player sees
that he has hit an opponent between the eyes,
he shouts "Daid Chickun." The first team to
shout "Daid Chickun" nine times is declared
winner.
Teams are penalized if "Daid Chickun" is
called out more than once for the same man,
or if a player fires at an opponent at closer!
than six feet. This rule completely eliminates
bodily contact.
Daid Chickun has not yet attained wide pop
ularity, but is played in some parts of Arkansas
and Oklafornia as well as in Kentucky.

1 The word "Chickun" is a Kentuckian cor
ruption of the English word "chicken," found
in the well-known quotation, "Why did the
chicken cross the road?"
Up to the present time, nobody knows for
sure why the chicken crossed the road. One
theory is that the chicken was being chased,
but if someone were chasing it, the chicken
would certainly not go to the other side of the
road and then stop.
Another theory is that the chicken crossed
the road in order to get food or drink. This
theory was expounded by the curator of the
Lodi State Museum of Feather Technology
(Alumni knows it as L.S.M.F.T.)
However, that too is unlikely, for we have
recently acquired some heretofore unpublished
documents proving beyond a shadow of doubt
that the original barnyard was amply stocked
with food and water.
No, for the real answer we must resort to
Freudian psychology. The curtains of ignorance
can now be drawn and the hard facts faced:
The chicken crossed the read because there
was a rooster on the other side.
This discovery will no doubt bring about
tremendous improvements in the art of humor.
