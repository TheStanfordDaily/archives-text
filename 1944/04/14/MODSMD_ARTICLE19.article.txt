### 
WASHINGTON, April 13 (UP).â€”
General Douglas Mac Arthur, in a
cryptic exchange of letters with a
Republican Congressman, was re
vealed today to have said he "un
reservedly agreed with the complete
wisdom and statesmanship" of the
Congressman's comments including
a statement that "unless this New
Deal can be stopped this time our
American way of life is forever
doomed."
And in reply to another letter tell
ing of a bureaucratic "monstrosity
. . . engulfing the nation," Mac A
rthur noted that "we must not inad
vertently slip into the same condi
tion internally as the one which we
fight externally." Mac Arthur also
was diclosed to have written that his
Southwest Pacific forces "are doing
what we can with what we have
(but) I will be glad . . . when more
substantial forces are placed at my
disposition."
The correspondence was initiated
by Representative A. L. Miller, Re
publican, of Nebraska, a Mac Arthur
