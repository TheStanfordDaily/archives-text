# University Clock Tolls Out Stanford Hours Since 1901
## 
### Elaine Wood 
Many of you have heard the clock
behind the Corporation Yard toll out
the hour. You have depended on
this clock to get you to and from
classes on time. Not only does the
face of the clock tell you the time,
but the chimes constantly remind
you of this fact. Also you depend
on this clock to get you out of class
on time as the class bells are rigged
up to its mechanism.
The clock has been in perfect
working order since its dedication.
True, there have been a few addi
tions, but these are only for new
devices. There is a piece of mech
anism that was added which auto
matically shuts off the class bells
over the week-ends. By this small
piece of machinery, the class bells
can be shut off on any day desired.
A few more additions have been
made to the clock for the sake of
convenience. The clock has kept
perfect time and has fulfilled its ob
ligation to the students for a num
ber of years.
Story Revealed
Yet, have you ever given a thought
to the clock other than telling the
time? Have you ever thought that
this clock might have a history?
In 1903 the clock and chimes were
dedicated to Leland Stanford by his
wife. There is an inscription to this
effect on the chimes themselves
which reads:
"Chimes of the Memorial Church
Erected to the Memory of
Leland Stanford
By His Wife
Jane Lathrop Stanford
A.D. 1900"
Originally, the clock and chimes
weer situated in the tower of the
church. In 1906 the earthquake
came and caused the bells to fall.
It was then decided that the clock
and chimes should be moved to a
more stable position so as not to be
in danger of another earthquake.
The clock was moved to a spot be
hind the chapel and has remained
there ever since 1906.
Made in 1901
The clock itself was made by the
Seth Thomas Clock Company,
Thomaston, Connectictu, May 15,
1901. The chimes weer made by the
Meneely Bell Company, Troy, New
York, 15)00. It is interesting to know

that these chimes are replicas of the
ones in Westminster Abbey, Lon
don.
The electric shop of the Corpora
tion Yard looks out for the clock
and chimes. No work is done on
the clock except to shut off the
chimes at night.
