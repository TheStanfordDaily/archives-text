# Sokol Adds to Autumn Analysis of Pacific War
## 
### NADA SKIDMORE 
Anthony E. Sokol, associate pro
fessor of Germanic languages, who
was assistant director of the Far
Eastern Language and Area School
for the ASTP, was interviewed con
cerning the significance of the United
States naval action in the South Pa
cific, during autumn quarter by the
Stanford Daily. His predictions at
that time appear to have been par
tially fulfilled by the situation in the
Far East now.
The U.S. Naval Institute published
an article, "German Experiments
With Remote Control During the
Last War," by Mr. Sokol in its Feb
ruary 1944 issue. The proceedings
listed the article as "The little-known
story of German attempts to develop
remote control for small torpedo craft
during World War I."
Four Possibilities
"One of four possibilities can be
chosen by the United States as the
next major step in the war against
Japan. Successes in the Marshalls
could even be followed up by a drive
through the island groups to Guam
and invasion of Japan. This move
would be the most effective, but also
the most difficult of any that the
United States could make. It's a pos
sibility, not a probability," Mr. Sokol
commented yesterday.
Referring to the term "zone of su
periority" which he coined last fall,
Mr. Sokol explained it as the range
within which a country can retain
superiority in battle because of the
proximity of supplies and bases for
longer-range actions.
Recapture Manila
"A second possibility for the
United States is attack on the Philip
pines and the recapture of Manila,"
he continued. This action could be
taken more within the American
zone of superiority and stand more
chance of success.
Since victory in the Philippines
would be the "first major moral vic
tory" as well as a victory of strategy,
"it would be of enormous impor
tance," according to Mr. Sokol. "Fur
thermore, it would cut of! Japan's
lifeline to her conquests in south
eastern Asia and Japan's access to
the tin, oil, and rice of these re
gions."
Aid to China
"From the Philippines, help could
be sent to China—supplies, troops,
and other aid. Perhaps the United
States would be able to assist the
Chinese in proceeding northward to
Korea and Manchuria to within
bombing range of Japan."

I Mr. Sokol suggested an American
i attack on the Dutch East Indies held
by the Japanese as the third possi
j bility for a heavy blow against the
enemy. "The United States would
then be able to begin a double
pronged offensive from the Indies
and from Guam or other bases in that
area," he remarked.
Supply IJases
Possession of Japan's main source
of oil would probably aid in further
ing a thrust up through the Malay
Peninsula, if New Guinea and Aus
i tralia were used as supply bases for
the new front.
"A naval attack from the Indian
Ocean might accompany that type of
offensive," Mr. Sokol reflected.
The probability of an effective
thrust in the Burma region is dis
counted by Mr. Sokol as a major
| drive of the present. He also men
tioned that American occupation or
I elimination of Japanese bases from
I the Aleutians as far west as Para
| mushiro and the Kuriles, 1,650 miles
from Dutch Harbor, would be of
"most importance as a diversion" and
a smoke-screen for essential attacks
in the South Pacific.

chosen by the United States as the
next major step in the war against
Japan. Successes in the Marshalls
could even be followed up by a drive
through the island groups to Guam
and invasion of Japan. This move
would be the most effective, but also
the most difficult of any that the
United States could make. It's a pos
sibility, not a probability," Mr. Sokol
commented yesterday.
Referring to the term "zone of su
periority" which he coined last fall,
Mr. Sokol explained it as the range
within which a country can retain
superiority in battle because of the
proximity of supplies and bases for
longer-range actions.
Recapture Manila
"A second possibility for the
United States is attack on the Philip
pines and the recapture of Manila,"
he continued. This action could be
taken more within the American
zone of superiority and stand more
chance of success.
Since victory in the Philippines
would be the "first major moral vic
tory" as well as a victory of strategy,
"it would be of enormous impor
tance," according to Mr. Sokol. "Fur
thermore, it would cut of! Japan's
lifeline to her conquests in south
eastern Asia and Japan's access to
the tin, oil, and rice of these re
gions."
Aid to China
"From the Philippines, help could
be sent to China—supplies, troops,
and other aid. Perhaps the United
States would be able to assist the
Chinese in proceeding northward to
Korea and Manchuria to within
bombing range of Japan."

I Mr. Sokol suggested an American
i attack on the Dutch East Indies held
by the Japanese as the third possi
j bility for a heavy blow against the
enemy. "The United States would
then be able to begin a double
pronged offensive from the Indies
and from Guam or other bases in that
area," he remarked.
Supply IJases
Possession of Japan's main source
of oil would probably aid in further
ing a thrust up through the Malay
Peninsula, if New Guinea and Aus
i tralia were used as supply bases for
the new front.
"A naval attack from the Indian
Ocean might accompany that type of
offensive," Mr. Sokol reflected.
The probability of an effective
thrust in the Burma region is dis
counted by Mr. Sokol as a major
| drive of the present. He also men
tioned that American occupation or
I elimination of Japanese bases from
I the Aleutians as far west as Para
| mushiro and the Kuriles, 1,650 miles
from Dutch Harbor, would be of
"most importance as a diversion" and
a smoke-screen for essential attacks
in the South Pacific.
Anthony E. Sokol, associate pro
fessor of Germanic languages, who
was assistant director of the Far
Eastern Language and Area School
for the ASTP, was interviewed con
cerning the significance of the United
States naval action in the South Pa
cific, during autumn quarter by the
Stanford Daily. His predictions at
that time appear to have been par
tially fulfilled by the situation in the
Far East now.
The U.S. Naval Institute published
an article, "German Experiments
With Remote Control During the
Last War," by Mr. Sokol in its Feb
ruary 1944 issue. The proceedings
listed the article as "The little-known
story of German attempts to develop
remote control for small torpedo craft
during World War I."
Four Possibilities
"One of four possibilities can be
chosen by the United States as the
next major step in the war against
Japan. Successes in the Marshalls
