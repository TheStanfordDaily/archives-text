LONDON, Friday (UP)â€”'The Red
Army corraling 20,000 Nazi prisoners
in its swiftest surge of the war swept
through the main east and west coast
port of the Crimea as well as its cap
ital Scmferopol Thursday and sent
the last enemy remnants on the pe
ninsula fleeing in bewildered rout
to a dead end at historic Sevastopol.
Feodosiya, east coast harbor, Yev
patoriya, on the opposite coast, siezed
in a cross country flash over night,
and Semferopol, administrative seat
of the Crimea, fell in such staccato
order that Premier Josef Stalin is
sued an unprecedented three vic
torious orders of the day.
In less than a week of fighting the
Russians had liberated nearly three
fourths of the peninsula's 10,000
square miles sweeping through more
than 600 towns and villages on
Thursday alone. Thousands of addi
tional German and Roumanian pris
oners were being taken hourly and
the announced total of 20,000 includ
ed only those counted up to late
Wednesday.

Overshadowed by the rush of
events in the Crimea was the cap
ture by the Third Ukraine Army of
Ovidiopol, 18 miles southwest of
Odessa, the terminus of the Knester
ferry that provided the Germans
with their last means of escape into
Roumania. A small area of about 25
square miles between Ovidiopol and
the Black Sea remained to be cleaned
up, otherwise the entire Ukraine as
delineated in 1939 had been cleared
of the enemy except for some marsh
lands bordering White Russia.
