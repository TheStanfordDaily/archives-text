# Helen Traubel Sings Sunday
## 
### 
Helen Traubel, magnificent dra
matic soprano of the Metropolitan
and one of the greatest living Amer
ican Wagnerian artists, comes to the
San Francisco Opera House Sunday
I afternoon, April IG, as the final at
traction on the current series of the
Opera Association.
Her appearance here follows in the
wake of one of her greatest operatic
seasons which earned her the title
of the "Metropolitan's All-American
First Lady." She earned this title as
the successor to the mantles of Leh
mann, Nordica, Gadski Leider and
! Fremsted in Wagnerian roles. Miss
Traubel is proud of the fact that she
is the first native singer in forty
years to carry the principal singing
burden of the Met's uncut Wagner
King.
A native of St. Louis, Miss Trau
! bel's first teacher was her mother,
I a concert singer of note in the
1 Middle West. It was Walter Dam
| rosch, however, who really discov
j ered Traubel and started her on her
I career.
