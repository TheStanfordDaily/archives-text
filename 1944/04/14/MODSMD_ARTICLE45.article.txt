# Drive for Russ Relief Opened
## 
### 
The family kit campaign launched
by Russian War Relief Com., is get
ting under way in Palo Alto now that
the Red Cross drive is over. The
committee is anxious to increase the
interest in these kits. A sample one
is in the window of their headquar
ters at 536 Emerson street, and car
tons and directions may be had with
in.
The filled ones are promptly
shipped to Portland and from there
sent overseas to the U.S.S.R. The
girls in Stanford dormitories have
taken a goodly supply, and church
groups are beginning to take an in
terest.
Russian War Relief believes that if
the need were more vividly realized
there would be a great increase in
p.offered help. As the Red Army ad
vances, an army of rehabilitation
must move into the recaptured towns
to fight disease, to rebuild homes, and
to feed the surviors of the Nazi rule.
A recent radiogram sent by Soviet
Relief authorities to R.W.R. reported:
The Nazis burned down farmers'
homes, machine shops and barns, and
slaughtered all animals. In our en
tire region there was no food, no
shelter, even for the children, no
clothing except the ragged and in
adequate garments that the people,
returning from their hideouts in the
forests, wore on their backs."
Mr. Churchill has said, "The Rus
sians sustained losses which no other
country or government has ever
borne in so short a time and lived.
But they, like us, were resolved
never to give in."
