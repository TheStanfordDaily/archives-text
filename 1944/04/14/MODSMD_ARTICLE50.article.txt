Comes another quarter, and comes |
time once more for the sports staff's j
far - famed Board of Experts to
emerge warily from hiding and make
a few predictions about coming
ports events.
Composed of Jim Weinberg, Ed j
Luce, Joe Zukin, myself, a crystal
ball, and two ouija boards, the Board
piled up a good record for accuracy
during the football and basketball
seasons, but the latest subject, Coast
League baseball, may prove too hot j
to handle. What with the draft— |
surely you've heard of it—and one j
thing and another, the experts are !
sticking their necks out when they j
look into the future of pro base
ball, but here goes.
Each time a team was picked for j
first place it was given ten points; j
nine points for second place, etc. i
Tins is how the Board says the j
Coast League pennant race will come t
out.
Final Standings
Team Points j
1. Los Angeles 40
2. Hollywood 34
3. Seattle 30
4. San Diego 26
5. San Francisco 25
6. Oakland 24
7. Portland 17
8. Sacramento 12
The Angels were a solid choice
for first place, with every one of the j
experts putting them at the top of J
the list. From second on down to j
sixth the race shapes up as a mad
scramble for position, with Holly- J
wood and Seattle slight favorites.
Incidentally, former Sports Editor j
Don Langendorf, in a recent letter j
k o the sports staff, picked San Fran- j
cisco to take the crown. Going over- :
board for the O'Doulmen, Don could !
not give any reason; claimed he just j
had a hunch.
In these days when the managers,
themselves, can't tell from week to
week who'll be in the starting line
up, a hunch is just about as good a
reason for a forecast as a scientific
analysis of every team's chances, j
Who knows, Don may be right at !
that, or we may all be wrong, and j
Sacramento will have it cinched by I
the end of July. Who knows?
