# Farm Track Stars To Comete at Cal
## 
### 
Responding to an invitation by Cal
Track Coach A 1 Regan, three Stan
ford men, Johnny Fulton, Don Lan
dale, and Ed Luce are entered in the
California Open Trials to be held to
morrow at 3 p.m. at Edwards Field on
the Bear campus.
Competing for the Olympic Club
of San Francisco because of the
Stanford ban on inter-collegiate
sports, Fulton will enter the 220 and
440, while Landale and Luce will be
in the high jump.
Luce's entry is doubtful, due to a
torn finger, but there is a good
chance he will compete.
