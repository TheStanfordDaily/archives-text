## Softball and Track Signups Now Being Taken in Men's Gym 
### JOE ZUKIN 
Stanford's two intramural sports for this quarter, soltball and track, t
due to get underway soon. The diamond league will have its initial e
counter within two weeks, while the track department will be taken c;
of hy one big meet sometime later in the quarter.
As yet, plans are still indefinite as to when the baseball league will beg
but Harry Wolters, director of intra- ♦

mural sports, is working out a plan,
and the signup sheet is now on the
bulletin board in the men's gym. It
is hoped that a good turnout will be
the result of this new intramural
league.
Although there will be no definite
rule against it, the athletic depart
ment has expressed the desire that
only teams which are represented by
a group of players from one particu
lar hall sign up. Teams like last
quarter's "Roble Hashers" and "Ger
ona A.C." which are a group of the
best players to be found do not give
an even chance to the rest of the
teams in the league.
The baseball teams will consist of
either nine or 10 men, according to
whether or not a middle fielder will
be used. Softball equipment will be
used throughout the entire team.
Along about the first of June a
gigantic track meet will be held in
which all on-campus organizations
will be allowed to enter contestants.
Plans for this meet are now being
laid, and as soon as a definite setup is
decided upon, the Daily will put
forth the results.
