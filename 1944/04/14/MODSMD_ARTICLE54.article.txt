# Signups Held For Soccer Team
## 
### 
With possible games with Chinese
Army students and British sailors
from San Francisco in the offing,
Harry Maloney, soccer coach, is ac
cepting applications now for the soc
cer team. Soccer is the only sport
still being carried on at Stanford in
anything but an intra-mural fashion.
Prospective players, graduate or
undergraduate, and with or without
previous experience, should sign up
in the Encina Gym this week. Prac
tices will start the latter part of the
week.
Games are now being lined up with
service and college teams throughout
the Bay Area, with the first tilt set
for sometime in May.
Coach Maloney stated that enough
men had already signed up to field a
team, but unless additional strength
was located, Stanford's only active
team would be too weak to bring
much more than sympathy for our
manpower situation to the Farm. It
was emphasized, however, that other
colleges will be weak also, and if
enough men sign up, we can field a
winning soccer squad.
