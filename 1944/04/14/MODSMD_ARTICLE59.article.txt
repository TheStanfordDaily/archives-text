# Symphony on Lincoln Speech To Be Performed Saturday
## 
### 
Based on Lincoln's immortal Get- '
i tysburg address, and dedicated to the I
fighting men and women of America i
I on all the battle fronts, a new Roy ;
Harris symphony will be given its j
world premiere performance on the j
79th anniversary of the Great Eman
cipator's death.
The new work, to be known as the
"Sixth Symphony," will be played by ;
the Boston Symphony Orchestra and
conducted by Dr. Serge Koussevit- ;
sky. It will be broadcast over KC.O [
and the coast-to-coast Blue Network i
on Saturday, April 15, from 5:20 to
6:30 p.m. The broadcast is one of
{ the regular series sponsored by the
Allis-Chalmers Company.
The composer was commissioned
last May by the Blue Network to
write the symphony in the interests !
of American cultureâ€”following the
world-wide acclaim accorded his
Fifth, which was dedicated to the I
people of the Soviet Union.
First Ma'or Work
Harris' Fifth Symphony was the
first major work of its kind to be
written by an American. The initial
performance was presented by i he |
J Boston Symphony Orchestra on Feb. !
27, over the Blue Network, and was I
j beamed to all parts of the world 11
! times during the following week
: through the Office of War Informa
i tion.
The Sixth Symphony is in four I
movements: "Awakening," a prelude !
reflecting the opening passage of j
| Lincoln's great speech: "Conflict," a
| fantasy dramatizing war; "Dedica
tion," a chorale of dedication to the
dead, and "Affirmation," a fugue re
| fleeting the faith in mankind that
rings forth from the last paragraph
| of the .Passage.
I j
New Work
In speaking of his new work, Har- !
ris says, "In seeking to compose a '
symphony worthy of our great na- I
tional crisis, I have turned to one of i
1 the great moments in the history of j
our nation for guidance. In Lincoln's !
Gettysburg speech I find a classic ex- I

pression of that great cycle which
always attends any progress in the
intellectual or spiritual growth of
people: (1) Awakening, (2) Conflict
of the old against the new, (3) ter
rible suffering resulting from that
conflict, and (4) the triumph of"the
new over the old, which is the af
firmation of the eternal youth of the
human spirit.
"We are in the midst of that proc
ess now and each of us must con
tribute to its solution according to
our endowments and opportunities.
In this spirit, I offer the Sixth Sym
phony."
