# 'Purple Heart’ Is Grim Drama
## 
### 
THE PURPLE lIEAItT at the Stan
ford Theater.
This 20th Century-Fox production
is one of the few truly line war pic
tures to date. It brings the war
home forcefully, is handled intelli
gently, and contains some splendid
acting.
"The Purple Heart" is the story of
eight American Army Air Force
men, members of the crew of a
bomber which took part in the raid
on Tokyo, who are forced down ii\
China after the raid and fall into
the hands of the Japs. They are
tried in a Japanese civil court for
murder, and for "atrocities" com
mitted during the raid.
This film is not the type that wil'
provide pleasant entertainment ft
the kiddies. It is grim drama and
maintains a feeling of tension
throughout its 90 minutes. Rlost ot
the scenes take place in the court
room and the jail in which the flyers
are held, but sufficient variety i>
achieved by the use of flashbacks.
The eight men form a representa
tive cross-section of the various ele
ments in American life. Dana An
drews and Farley Granger, who weie
seen as the two young brothers in
"North Star." both turn in fine per
formances.
The second feature, "Hey Rookie,"
is a poor attempt at transferring the
stage show of the same name to the
screen. The stage show, as presented
by the "Yard Birds" of Fort Mac-
Arthur, was highly entertaining.
