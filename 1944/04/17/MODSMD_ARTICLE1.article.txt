ADVANCE H.Q., India (UP)â€”Al
lied air-borne troops were reported
attacking Japanese communications
in Burma only 50 wiles from Man
dalay tonight, while (lie British de
fenders of Imphal, shifting abruptly
to the offensive, have hurled the en
emy beyond the Manipur plain.
A Southeast Asia Command com
munique said that commando air
craft were supplying units of the
"ghost" army carrying on for the late
Maj. Gen. Orde Charles Wingate in
the area of Shwebo Ye-U, 50 and 70
miles respectively, northwest of
Mandalay.
Shwebo is ,on the narrow-gauge
railroad leading to Myitkyina, men
aced by Chinese and Indian columns
driving down through north Burma
and the Japanese supply lines to that
front thus were acutely endangered
by the air-borne operations. It was
the deepest penetration of Burma by
the ghost army yet reported.
On the Indian front, operations to
clear Japanese road blocks around
Imphal were proceeding satisfactorily
while farther north an allied column
was beating down the Dimapur road
to the relief of isolated Kohima.
