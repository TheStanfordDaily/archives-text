# Galleries Display Mendelowitz Art
## 
### 
Daniel M. Mendelowitz, assistant
professor of art and education at
Stanford, is displaying an exhibit of
his watercolors at Gump's Galleries
in San Francisco from April 14 to
May G.
Born in North Dakota in 1905, Mr.
Mendelowitz has lived most of his
life in California, receiving his A.B.
and M.A. at Stanford in 1927.
His water colors which he has ex
hibited for the past 10 years have
been shown in the New York and
American Water Colors annual exhi
bition and various water color shows
on the West Coast. In 1940 Men
delowitz received a commission from
the Federal Government for a mural
based on a design he submitted to a
national competition.
Last year the Toledo Museum of
Art gave Mendelowitz a one-man
show of which Frank Taylor wrote
in the Toledo Times:
"Mr. Mendelowitz's paintings show
convincingly that he has something
*o say and says it without surface
technicalities. The entire exhibition
demonstrates how an artist with
courage can transform a seemingly
unimportant event or scene into a
dynamic story-telling picture."
