# W.B. Auxiliary Meets Today
## 
### 
The War Board Auxiliary will
meet today tor the first time this
quarter at 5 p.m. in the Women's
Clubhouse, announced Marion John
son, chairman. Every woman's liv
ing group must send a representative.
The auxiliary, which is the War
Board's means of transmitting news
of war work activities to the living
groups, meets every Monday after
noon. This quarter Pat Whittemore
and Jane Irwin are assisting Miss
Johnson.
At the meeting today sign-up
sheets for the eight-hour pledge pro
gram will be distributed to all auxil
iary members. These sheets will take
the place of the pledge cards, filled
out last quarter, which will not be
redistributed but will remain on file
in the War Board office, according to
Alice Tuttle, pledge card chairman.
Any girls wishing to change their
pledge cards of last quarter may in
dicate such a change on the sign-up
sheets and the change will be made
on the cards in the office.
All new girls and those who have
never made out a pledge card are
asked to sign up for at least eight
hours of work a month in a wide
range of activities. Lists will be
available for every girl on campus
telling what kind of work will be
considered as war work.
Any girl wishing to change her
pledge card at any time during the
quarter may do so by applying at the
War Board office.
Auxiliary members are asked to
return all sign-up sheets to the office
as soon as possible this week and, at
the latest, they may bring them to
the next meeting. Each representa
tive should accompany the sheets
with a complete list of the new girls
in her living group and also the fig
ure for the total number of girls in
the residence.
"We would like your complete co
operation in returning these lists
soon, and as complete as possible,"
said Miss Tuttle. "There are many
new opportunities this quarter for
work which will not only aid the war
effort, but will be enjoyable for the
workers."
