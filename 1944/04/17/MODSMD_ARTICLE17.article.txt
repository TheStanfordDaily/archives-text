DOES ANYONE know how much it costs to take a cab to Paly
from campus or a cab from Paly to campus? If you catch a cab
in San Francisco it's a relatively simple procedure to figure out
what you owe the driver—or the company —or at any rate, what
you have to shovel out of your pocket and put in the driver's hand.
All you do is watch the meter and hope you're the last one out.
But Paly. That's another story. Here it really takes a college
education to enable a person to figure out the cost. It takes a good
stiff course in econ with a complementary course in psychology.
The ideal driver will charge fifty cents a load. The same dis
tance in San Francisco would cost around two-bits, but you know
how it is in Paly—the scenic beauty of Palm Drive naturally calls
for a higher fare.
And if you've just gotten off the Daylight the price may vary.
This is when it is most fun to try to figure out what you'll have to
pay. One load taken to campus from the S.P. station donated
seventy-five cents apiece to the cause—the cost of loading bags
and things and of having to go to so many different addresses no
doubt served to raise the charge.
Want to start a new racket, bud?
