# Both Parties "Is Willin'"
## 
### 
THE OTHER DAY an upper division Stanford woman was ex- !
pounding a few things she regretted about her career as a college j
student. It ran along "the usual lines:
She wished she had worked harder and gotten better grades. I
She wished she had done something—just what, she didn't j
know, but anyhow something that could be categorized as extra-1
curricular.
She wished she had gotten to know more persons.
These are the usual regrets of a college woman. But she .then !
went on to say that the thing she regretted most was that there
wasn't a single faculty member she could really call a friend. l
She had had many professors, yes, and she, of course, said hello ;
to them when she met them on Quad. But she had never visited
a professor at his home; she had no knowledge of any of them
outside of their class lectures.
A campus professor voiced that same regret—a transposed
version of it. He complained that he knew his students only in the
classroom; he would like to know them better but apparently they
were too busy with other activities.
So—there's a situation. Professors would like to know stu- j
dents, students would like to know professors.
Other campuses, according to hearsay, can boast of wonderful
friendships formed between professors and their families and
students. We can boast of very few.
However, since both parties "is willin'," 4 oesn t it look as
though both professors and students could easily remedy the
trouble?
