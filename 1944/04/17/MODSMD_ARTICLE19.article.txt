With spring at hand, the campus is once again bracing itself
for an epidemic of the dread Blue Moakus, a highy contagious i
disease which strikes down college students with deadly effect.
According to latest reports from the Health Service and the j
Rest Homes, a number of students have already been stricken. |
Health officials are frantically preparing to combat the epidemic. j
The dread Blue Moakkus, like many other diseases, may be
recognized by the symptoms.
Victims invariably find themselves unable to study. They ,
have a burning urge to be in the presence of members of the ;
opposite sex, and worst of all, become restless after 7 o'clock at
night.
These are the most common symptoms. In some cases, the
Moakkus germ attacks the Physmo-craniatic and the victim finds
himself mentally deranged by an intense craving for sunlight,
especially sunlight near a large body of water. This craving often 1
becomes so intense that the victim drops whatever he is doing in
order to get in the sunlight.
Hey Jack, drive me up to the rest home.
