# Wilbur Gives Radio Speech

### 
Ray Lyman Wilbur, Chancellor
Emeritus of the University, gave a
closing message for the "Here's to
Youth" program Saturday morning
over NBC's nation-wide hook-up
from the patio of Palo Alto's Com
munity Center.
After Palo Alto children had pre
sented"The Prince and the Pauper"
before more than 200 spectators and
to , a radio audience of millions,
Chancellor Wilbur began his talk by
terming Palo Alto's Community
Center as "a demonstration of local
democracy at workâ€”at work and at
play in the interest of its younger
citizens." He told the history of the
center and its completion which was
aided by public-minded citizens.
"Offerings ran the gamut of youth
interests from sport fields, swimming
pools, game rooms, and theater
through special libraries and a junior
museum where the young scientist
may pursue his particular hobby. I
call intention to this again mainly to
emphasize the range of community
forces that come into action when the
folks of a city or town want some
thing and are willing to work for it,"
Chancellor Wilbur said in his plain,
vigorous speech.
"Most Americans want to play fair
with the boys and girls who will
follow them. Most American com
munities want to do a good job for
their young people. Playing square
with them, doing a good job for them,
calls for truly cooperative effort all
the way along the line. Cooperative
effort to beat these (wartime) con
ditions means real work by lots of
people, not mere lip service to the
nice phrase "Let's prevent juvenile
delinquency," he continued.
Chancellor Wilbur spoke to the
common people of any community
when he said in conclusion. "When
the folks of any town or city are
ready to put their hearts into the job
of meeting the needs of the young
people, it can be done. We are in the
mood to blame someone else, the
teacher, the preacher, or the parent
rather than blame ourselves for an
environment that needs to be molded
for children if these children are to
develop as good and constructive
citizens.
"The war is tearing us apart down
to our foundations. Our children are
now a prime war casualty. There is
so much to do in building anew, in
rehabilitation, in readjustment, that
every boy and girl of these days
should feel he is a part of construc
tive community building."
