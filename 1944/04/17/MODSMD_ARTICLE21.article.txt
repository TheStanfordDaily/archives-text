# Photo Process Revolutionized
## 
### 
The revolutionary process of tak
ing colored pictures with black and
white film was explained to two
Daily reporters Saturday at a special
demonstration by Richard Thomas,
inventor of Thomascolor.
The system of photography which
is described as additive has long been
an object of research. Thomas claims
to have solved the problem by an op
tical unit that takes the place of the
ordinary lens of the moving picture
or still camera.
The light entering the optical unit
is transposed into four images which
pass through four filters. Each of the
filters is one of the primary colors.
The filtered images are then recorded
as a negative on the film plane in
terms of greys. When projected in a
standard motion picture projector,
equipped with a special unit, the re
sult is a picture in full natural color.
The development of this process
will make possible inexpensive ama
teur color photography and color
television that is demonstratively
practicable.
Mr. Thomas was a protege of
Thomas A. Edison and is a well
known American scientist.
