## 
### 
Over a thousand people were im
pressed with the reverence and
! beauty of the Jewish Synagogue
j service which was held at the Me
j morial Church yesterday at the reg
j ular 11 o'clock service.
Following the first hymn, Cantor
Reuben Rinder read scripture, and
then carried on and impressive and
well-sung response with the Uni
versity Choir.
Following the canting and response
i by the choir, Rabbi Irving Reichart
delivered a sermon on the subject,
| "What Are We Fighting For?" Dr.
Reichert pointed out that the Jap
anese knew that they were fighting
to end the menace of America and
Great Britain; and Germany was
fighting for more "Lebensraum." We,
he said, are fighting to prevent Japan
and Germany from achieving their
aims, and to see that the "American
Way" survives.
This "American Way," Dr. Reichart
continued, is "a dream" of a social
order where each person can advance
to the best of his capabilities and be
judged according to his achieve
ments.
After discussing the value of this
, "dream," Dr. Reichart said that we

owe our dead "more than star-span
gled platitudes. 'It is for us to be
highly resolved that these dead shall
not have died in vain'," he said. Dr.
Reichart emphasized the fact that
strikes, bigotry, absenteeism, and the
like, did not help insure the state
ment that our dead have not died in
vain.
Rabbi Reichart also emphasized
that we are under obligation to
secure the peace. The way to do this,
he said, is for public opinion to be so
strong and determined in having a
lasting peace is made a reality, that
politicians cannot "sabotage this vic
tory."
