LONDON (UP) â€”Russian troops of
the Crimea tightening their siege
ring around Sevastopol, battered in
toward that historic citadel from the
east today, capturing the port city of
Yalta and penning the enemy's forces
in a shrinking 300-square-mile
pocket which was being blasted night
and day by artillery and air power.
