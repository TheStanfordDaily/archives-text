# Desert Song Intriguing
## 
### 
Don't amble down to the Stanford
Theater this Monday, Tuesday, or
Wednesday with the idea of recalling
the shades of Rudolph Valentino, for
Dennis Morgan in the Warner Bro
thers' version of "The Desert Song"
bears as little resemblance to the
great heart-throbber as the movie
does to the Sigmund Romberg oper
etta.
Against a technicolor background
of international intrigue, complete
with Nazis, ploting native chiefs, and
French Legionnaires, Dennie Mor
gan, American man-about-town who
becomes the leader of the desert Rift's
in their fight for freedom, and Irene
Manning, latest Paris entertainer on
tour, manage to warble "Desert
Song," "One Alone," and the "Rifl'
Song" in their off moments. Third
member of the triangle is the head of
the local French Legion, Bruce
Cabot, who also photographs nicely
in color.
Morgan and the Rill's start off by
fighting the French who are ex
ploiting Riff labor to build a railroad
across the desert. Later Morgan con
vinces the French leader that it's all
a nasty Nazi plot; the villains are
loilcd; the Riffs and the French make
peace; friend Morgan gets the girl;
and everybody rides off — horses,
Turkish-towel turbans and all—into
the desert dunes, facing the setting
sun.
Some amusing bits of comedy are
provided by the American foreign
correspondent who tries to dodge the
little French censor and send the
news of the local goings-on to his
editor. Acting honors should go to
the horses who do some effective
tumbling down the sand dunes in the
midst of battle. On the warm side
are the native dances performed in
the Riff gathering place. Carmen
Miranda has nothing on these gals!
For a nice, relaxing evening see
"The Desert Song." The music—
what there is of it—is worth the
admission price.—Diet/
