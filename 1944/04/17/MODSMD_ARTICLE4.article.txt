This is the 1415-year-old Benedictine Monastery on Mount Cassino, which the Nazis turned into a fortress
and the Allies were forced to bomb. The Nazis first used the monastery as an observation post to direct
artillery fire against American and British forces, and finally were reported firing direct from the old ab
bey, atop the 1800-foot hill.
