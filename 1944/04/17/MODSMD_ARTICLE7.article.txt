# Russ Kits Ready For Distribution
## 
### 
Kits to be filled with household
necessities for the relief of homeless
Russian families are now available at
the War Board office. These kits are
supplied by the Russian War Relief;
they may be filled by individual stu
dents or living groups.
The filling of Russian War Relief
kits is not a campus drive, but is
something vital and humane that
Stanford students can do. They will
contain ordinary and inexpensive
articles, which can be purchased in
Palo Altoâ€”articles which are taken
for granted here but are practically
non-existent in Russian cities and
villages.
The list of articles which should
be purchased to fill a kit is available
in the War Board office.
