# Field Humor Amuses All In Theater
## 
### 
Charles K. Field, graduate with
Stanford's first class in 1895, re
turned to the campus yesterday to
entertain at the Little Theater. Be
ginning his program with a history
of dramatic activities at Stanford,
Field recalled many hilarious inci
dents when the speech and drama
department was in its noisy infancy.
In the days before Memorial Audi
torium —before, in fact the old as
sembly hall — Stanfordites used to
perform in the chapel. On December
31, 1891. the Farm's first drama, Wil
liam Dean Howell's "A Sleeping
Car," complete with sound effects,
was presented at a reception given
at Encina. On February 29 of the
following year, the second play, a
pioneer Stanford Revue, presented
the first year at Stanford in a series
of skits.
Contributes Satire
Mr. Field's contribution, *'A Fac
ulty Meeting,"' was a satire on well
known professors, ending up with
the entire group departing enthusi
astically for a baseball game. This
was a subtle way of expressing the
students' favorite belief, that the only
prerequisite for professorship at the
Farm was the ability to play base
ball. In February 1893, Mr. Field
wrote an opener for a show entitled
"Without Rehearsal," which he re
cited yesterday.
Junior Farce
The Encina Gym in April 1894
witnessed the junior farce, produced
after "one long night of hustling" as
was typical of Stanford drama's
"primitive period." Field wrote what
was termed a social drama, "A
Change of Heart." In '95, the first
Farm vaudeville featured a ballet by
the football heroes.
Field pointed out at this point in
his story that the accounts in Dr.
Jordan's autobiography about the
plays at Stanford "indicate approval
from the very beginning of this im
portant factor in college life."
Field continued his account with
tales of the "middle ages" in Stan
ford drama .... including humorous
incidents of the first Homecoming.
Own Radio Program
For 15 years Field had his own
radio program called "Cheerio,"
which, he said, represented him "as a
benign and beautiful character in
stead of the real me." Again, he said
he became so intoxicated at the
sound of his own voice that he re
corded several of the programs, some
of which he proceeded to play for the
audience.
The first selection was "The High
wayman," set to a musical back
ground. Field often took poems or
songs that were speaking about
