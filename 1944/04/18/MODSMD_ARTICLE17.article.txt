BORED STIFF, aren't you, Stanford woman? Not
many dates, if any, no dances in the city. No
nothing except going to the show, talking, going
to the show, lying in the sun, and going to the
show. You feel restless, want to do something,
but that something just never seems to come
along.
There's never any place to wear those good
looking clothes you bought, and you never seem
to see a man who looks interesting. Life's just
plain dull.
It's understandable, it's not hard to see why
you feel that way. It's understandable, but it's
not excusable.
We've gotten used to paying for our fun. We
have become accustomed to the idea that if a
person plans on having fun, he has to pay for it.
It costs hard cash to be admitted to a show, a
dance spot, a bowling alley, a play, etc.
These things are fun, too, and they always will
be and there's no reason why they shouldn't be.
But this is a fact:
The things that are really fun, the things that
are the most fun and the things that make a per
son feel good inside don't cost a penny. All
they cost is a little imagination, a little planning,
and a little laughter.
What's more fun than tearing your lungs out
while you sing with a group of your friends
(even if you can't carry a tune), or hiking up
over the hills and finding out what's on the other
side, or riding a horse, or pounding apart a
tennis ball, or even playing murder in your
living room or flying a kite in the fields? And
what feels better than to take on a job, learn how
to do it, and then do it when you thought you
couldn't
Don't waste any more time. Just try it. When
you leave Stanford it may be too late.
