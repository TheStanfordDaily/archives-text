EDITOR'S NOTE:—It will be the policy of Bull
Session this quarter to have at least one quest 1
writer each week. This week, startinq off with
a bang, we have one of the campus's number
one comics, Bill Hyer, Chappie Editor.

It is Wednesday afternoon. In front of the
paneled door of recently remodeled Excom
room huddles a frightened group of sweaty
palmed freshmen —offenders of the Stanford
democracy. Inside sits Men's Council, headed
by ebullient, raven browed Judge "Black Jim"
Reynolds. As Judge Reynolds mutters "Oyez
Oyez Oyez," all rise to honpr Gordy Davis strid
ing in, his usual cheerful self, and taking his
place in back of the great mahogany table.
GORDY: I would have been here sooner but
I went through a stop light in Mayfield.
HOYTT: That's all right, we'll fix it up.
• LUCE: I would have been here sooner too,
but I fell in an elephant pit. .
JONES: Oh, do elephants have pits?
BLACK JIM: I don't know, I never ate one.
And so, as our little steamer wends its home
ward way into the setting A.S.S.U. office, we re
luctantly take our leave of the sweaty-palmed
offenders on the steps. With Gilbert contem
platingly shuffling violation sheets the door
swings shut on Black Jim's forceful words,
and so, must all enemies of Stanford and democ
racy end. Two spades."
