# Views on Your War

### Hayes Hunter 
(EDITOR'S NOTE: — In today's Daily Hayes
Hunter begins his column "Views on Your War,"
not necessarily to present opinions, but stim
ulate interest in vital current events.
Hunter, now at Stanford as a med student, was !
with NBC in San Francisco as special events '
news editor in 1942; in the Japanese Department, j
OWI, as an overseas propagandist, spring o/ '43;
and later with CBS in Hollywood as news editor.)
WE THOUGHT the lessons of the Malay penin
sula, Kwala Lompoor, Kowloon, and Singapore
had been well learned in the early days follow
ing Pearl Harbor. Now it sems they have not
been too well heeded. The recent setback on
the Burma front tends to support this.
There is one consolation, however, the Jap in
his strike at Imphal and Kohima, cannot hit
heavily through the jungle as infiltration has to
be under cover of darkness with light eguip
ment. Unless the Jap can hold the areas behirid
him, infiltration is of little or no value as the Jap's j
supplies soon diminish through lack of support
from the rear.
Since he cannot be supplied by aerial means
because of the United Nations' air superiority in
the sector, it is unguestionable that he cannot
hold his ground. His supplies are probably near- i
ing a danger point.
In this area of operations, the Jap seems to be j
getting little or no ground support.
The purpose of this strike at Imphal then, is
to harass the Allies in this area, an attempt to
forestall any major attack before the arrival of j
the monsoon —due shortly.
Driving from the north toward Myitkina, Gen.
Joe Stilwell promises to be a threat of major
conseguence to this Japanese supply base.
Another threat to the Jap in the C-B-I theater
of operations comes in the form of an announce
ment that Lord Louis Mountbatten has changed
his headguarters from New Delhi to the island of
Ceylon—supposedly in preparation for a large
amphibious operation. The large British naval
base of Trincomalee is also on this island in the
Indian Ocean.
The enemies of the United Nations seem to J
be on the receiving end of a major threat in
another theater. The Russians in their unceas
ing drive toward the west are pressing hard
upon Hitler's Festung Europa. Saturday the Rus
sians captured Tarnopol—termed by the Nazi
chief himself as guarding gateway to Germany.
The next objective of the Russians is Lwow, Old
Poland—one of the first cities to fall after the
declaration of war in September 1939.
From here on in much support can be ex
pected from the Russian guerillas and the Polish
underground.
In the south, the Russians are hammering at ,
the German occupied Russian Black Sea port of j
Sevastopol. It took three months to drive the
hard-fighting Russians ofit of this seaport city.
According to a Sunday announcement from
Marshal Stalin, it will be a miracle if the Ger- ;
mans manage to hold it eight hours after the
Russians reach the outskirts of the city. The Red
Army—-at last report— was a little more than two !
miles from the city. The big siege guns are al
ready going into action.
This means that the Reds have swept across
the Crimean peninsula in a little less than a
week. Minor skirmishes are still going on in
scattered areas, but major resistance has been I
completely wiped out. In 1941 we marveled at
the speed of the German blitzkrieg. Today we
marvel at the speed of the Russians and they
probably have a word for it—no doubt unpro- |
nounceable at this point.
Perhaps not so real and graphic, but never- i
theless of major conseguence is the threat of in- !
vasion from the west. (We're led to believe it
will be the west.) Daily more reports flood in
about the stepped-up aerial activity softening
the roofless fortress preparatory to the actual
invasion. There are many speculations about
where and when this will occur. Prime Minister
Winston Churchill has said it will be this year.

WE THOUGHT the lessons of the Malay penin
sula, Kwala Lompoor, Kowloon, and Singapore
had been well learned in the early days follow
ing Pearl Harbor. Now it sems they have not
been too well heeded. The recent setback on
the Burma front tends to support this.
There is one consolation, however, the Jap in
his strike at Imphal and Kohima, cannot hit
heavily through the jungle as infiltration has to
be under cover of darkness with light eguip
ment. Unless the Jap can hold the areas behirid
him, infiltration is of little or no value as the Jap's j
supplies soon diminish through lack of support
from the rear.
Since he cannot be supplied by aerial means
because of the United Nations' air superiority in
the sector, it is unguestionable that he cannot
hold his ground. His supplies are probably near- i
ing a danger point.
In this area of operations, the Jap seems to be j
getting little or no ground support.
The purpose of this strike at Imphal then, is
to harass the Allies in this area, an attempt to
forestall any major attack before the arrival of j
the monsoon —due shortly.
Driving from the north toward Myitkina, Gen.
Joe Stilwell promises to be a threat of major
conseguence to this Japanese supply base.
Another threat to the Jap in the C-B-I theater
of operations comes in the form of an announce
ment that Lord Louis Mountbatten has changed
his headguarters from New Delhi to the island of
Ceylon—supposedly in preparation for a large
amphibious operation. The large British naval
base of Trincomalee is also on this island in the
Indian Ocean.
The enemies of the United Nations seem to J
be on the receiving end of a major threat in
another theater. The Russians in their unceas
ing drive toward the west are pressing hard
upon Hitler's Festung Europa. Saturday the Rus
sians captured Tarnopol—termed by the Nazi
chief himself as guarding gateway to Germany.
The next objective of the Russians is Lwow, Old
Poland—one of the first cities to fall after the
declaration of war in September 1939.
From here on in much support can be ex
pected from the Russian guerillas and the Polish
underground.
In the south, the Russians are hammering at ,
the German occupied Russian Black Sea port of j
Sevastopol. It took three months to drive the
hard-fighting Russians ofit of this seaport city.
According to a Sunday announcement from
Marshal Stalin, it will be a miracle if the Ger- ;
mans manage to hold it eight hours after the
Russians reach the outskirts of the city. The Red
Army—-at last report— was a little more than two !
miles from the city. The big siege guns are al
ready going into action.
This means that the Reds have swept across
the Crimean peninsula in a little less than a
week. Minor skirmishes are still going on in
scattered areas, but major resistance has been I
completely wiped out. In 1941 we marveled at
the speed of the German blitzkrieg. Today we
marvel at the speed of the Russians and they
probably have a word for it—no doubt unpro- |
nounceable at this point.
Perhaps not so real and graphic, but never- i
theless of major conseguence is the threat of in- !
vasion from the west. (We're led to believe it
will be the west.) Daily more reports flood in
about the stepped-up aerial activity softening
the roofless fortress preparatory to the actual
