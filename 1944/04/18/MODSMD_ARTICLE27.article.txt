# Simmonds Gives Talk on Nutrition
## 
### 
Nina Simmonds, Sc.D., discussed
'"Nutrition: One Factor in the Health
Program" last Friday evening in
Lane Hall of the Stanford Medical
School.
"The rationing program has made '
| persons conscious of the fact that
certain foods depend not only upon
agriculture as such but also upon
available manpower. Research in
nutrition has given us an excellent
working knowledge of the dietary
properties of foods."
Continued Dr. Simmonds, "With
this information it is now possible to
estimate the potential food of an area
when analyzed from the standpoint
of acre-yield versus labor out-put.
Hence it is known which foods are
'The best agricultural investments'
from the nutrition standpoint."
In this lecture, the third of the G2nd
annual series, Dr. Simmonds urged
j all persons to become interested in
| preventive medicine and dentistry to
I apply the newer knowledge of nutri-
I tion to their own food selection, as
nutrition could then be said to play
its role as one factor in the health
j program.
