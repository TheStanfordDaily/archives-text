## 
### 
CANDY, Ceylon (UP) â€”Defeated
and thrown back before the plain or
Imphal, the Japanese invaders of In
dia increased the intensity of their
attacks against Kohima to the north
today, apparently determined to seize
at least one advance base lest
monsoon send them retreating back
to Burma next month.
The Japanese also counter at
tacked new British Imperial positions
on the partly cleared Kohima -
Dimapuh road but were repulsed,
and in the entire Kohima area there
are no "essential changes," a com
munique from Adm. Lord Louis
Mountbatten's headquarters said.
