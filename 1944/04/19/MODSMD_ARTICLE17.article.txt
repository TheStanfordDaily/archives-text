FATIGUED ....
Fatigued, aren t you, Stanford Man? Nothing to do except go
to dances, have dates, visit Uncle Harry's El Camino Sanitarium,
go to dances, visit Uncle Harry, take your woman to the Boat
house, play Mah Jongg, and visit Uncle Harry. You feel tired, you
need a rest, but you never get the chance.
There s no time to wear those dirty, beat-out jeans and saddle
shoes anymore. It's nothing but go, go, go, which probably
results from visiting Uncle Harry too much. And the women are
all so dull and uninteresting. For further details on this subject
see "Bored Stiff .. . Stanford Daily, April 18, 1944.
We re tired of footing the bill. The older we get, the more we
realize that Schopenhauer was right when he said that woman's
idea of the egual division of labor is for man to earn the money
and woman to spend it.
This whole thing has got to stop. The Stanford Man needs a
vacation. Schopenhauer needs a vacation. We need to lie around
and do nothing, go to shows, or just lie around and chew the fat.
With fat at two points a pound we are chewing it yat?
Most of all, we must learn to waste time. It's really very easy.
Due to the seriousness of the situation, a group of men on
campus are starting an intensive campaign—Lockouts for men.
This group is of the opinion that the men need protection from the
lustful packs of man-starved womanhood that roam |he campus
at night.
Women you say? Where's my hat?
