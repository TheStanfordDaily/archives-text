To the Editor:
For the past week I have been recuperating from the attack
of that well-known childhood disease, chicken pox. During the
week I have had an abundance of time on my hands, and I did a
lot of thinking.
Among other things, I was wondering if it would be possible
for the Daily Editorial Staff to write more editorials on the vital
problems of the day, national and international. Many students
— and I know of one who wrote an English theme on this—criti
cize the Daily for a number of things, one of them being a lack
of editorial policy. I do not wish to criticize the Daily however,
because I feel that you have done a good job and that you do
have an editorial policy, as was explained last quarter.
But—l do sincerely hope that there will be more editorials
devoted to the myriad of complex problems facing our country,
such as "White Supremacy in the South," or "U.S. and Inter
national Oil." I feel that you could not devote too much editorial
space to the first-named problem.
And so I patiently lie in bed waiting for the chicken-pox germs
to exhaust themselves, meanwhile hoping the the whole editorial
staff will consider this suggestion. It seems that formerly those
editorials concerned with more serious problems always had a
by-line—Dave Davis.
Yours very truly,
Charles H. Clark.
