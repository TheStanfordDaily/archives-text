# Views on Your War
## 
### Hayes Hunter 
A majority of the outstanding de
velopments of this war have been in
the field of air fighters, transports,
and bombers. The most recent and
perhaps the most startling is the de
velopment of the Lockheed Constel
lation. It is a troop transport or pas
senger ship. We have known about
its existence for many months and
knew it was soon to break into the
headlines. It did just this yesterday
with the amazing cross-country
! ilight time of (i hours and 58 minutes
I —slightly less than two hours travel
i ing time by car from Stanford to Los
j Angeles.
The Constellation flew the distance
\ at the amazing average of 355 miles
per hour. This speed—considering
the fact it is a four-motored plane
and its gross weight totals around 40
tons—puts it far ahead of many other
countries' fighters or bombers.
Faster Than Jap Zero
When the news was first released
about the Constellation sometime last
summer, a statement was made that
its speed exceeded that of Japanese
Mitsubishi "00' or Zero. Somehow
or other, 35 miles per hour seems
slow even for a Jap fighter plane.
Beyond a doubt, this new transport
I carries many important military as
) pects with its development.
When used as a troop transport, it
I will carry 100 fully equipped soldiers
i over a range of 3,000 miles. When
| considered in the light of South and
I Central Pacific aerial supply-line
j methods—it puts us one jump closer
| to victory over Japan.
Transports; in New Guinea
When the Japs were pushing over
1 the Owen Stanley mountains in New
Guinea last spring, they managed to
reach the summit town of Kokoda.
There Mac Arthur stopped them.
Many of us are aware of this fact but
not many of us know how Mac
l Arthur turned the trick. However
there is one outstanding fact. Con
verted commercial air transports —
perhaps even some of the planes we
I used to ride to the East—played a
major role.
The Southwest Pacific commander
; used the big converted airliners to
i carry small field pieces and mobile
I arms over the mountain range and
then struck at the Jap supply col
umns from the rear.
Considering that these planes that
played such a vital role were only
two-engined transports with a top
speed of 220 miles per hour and
handle comparatively light pay loads
I —think what the Constellation might
I have done.
"Super-Fortress"—B-2!)
Developing simultaneously is the
j Boeing super bomber—the B-29.
| We've only had brief glimpses of the
! new "Super-Fortress" and at that
| through the eyes of Gen. H. H. "Hap"
j Arnold. There have been small bits
iof information released about the
, plane. Other than that we know
i nothing of the performance or capa
j city of just such a ship. All that can
!be done is imagine. It's due for
| something big.
Invasion Jitters
Invasion jitters are the rage again.
I Monday night a military commen
; tator on the Paris radio anxiously
| said: "We are nearer to invasion—
i nearer than we ever have been be-
J lore." And he has good reason to be
jittery. England has been diplomat
-1 ically sealed off from the' rest of the
I world. All diplomats, consular offi
cials, couriers, diplomatic jumbo
■ telegrams, and censor-free cables
; have been banned. The only excep
! tions made are in the cases of the
j "Big Three," Britain, the United
i States, and Russia.
The diplomatic seal can be con
l sidered in two lights. It is an inten
tional move to prevent any invasion
j information from leaking from Eng
land—as it was doing through Ire
land just recently and shrewd move
! toward a more intensive war of
i nerves. We don't know who it is
; hardest on—the enemy or us.

Try to Trick Underground

Berlin has been announcing pre
maturely for two weeks that the in
vasion has started. This is a typical
Nazi trick to force the underground
to declaring itself. However, such an

| attempt was fruitless. It may have
! yielded a few, ill-informed under-
I ground participants, but for the most
; part the underground of the occupied
j areas is in close touch with partisan
leaders in England.
