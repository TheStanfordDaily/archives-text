# Hilton Tells of Recent South American Travels
## 
### JEAN HANSSEN 
While gathering material for
"Who's Who in Latin America," of
which he is editor, Ronald Hilton,
associate professor of Romanic lan
guages, spent the last 10 months
journeying through Latin America.
His itinerary took him through
Mexico, Central America, and Pana
ma, down the west coast of South
America as far the lakes in southern
Chile, across to Argentina, up the
east coast of South America, through
the Caribbean countries, and back
to the United States through Yucatan
and Mexico City.
He spent some time in each of the
20 Latin American republics, and saw
not only the capitals but nearly all
the large provincial cities, thousands
of small towns, and much of the hin
terland of a largely uninhabited
country.
Not a Paratrooper
Professor Hilton was unwilling to
allow himself to be classified as a
paratrooper (paracaidista) as are
most North Americans who content
themselves with airplane hops from
capital to capital. So he made a
point of traveling on the surface as
far as possible.
While traveling across Ecuador,
Mr. Hilton rode on the most fan
tastic mountain road he has seen in
any of his wide travels—a trip with
lingering memories, since the front
left wheel flew off without warning
and only the incredible skill of a
Latin-American driver allowed him

I to keep his travels on the earth's
i surface, as planned.
Taken by Police
On the Chile-Argentinian frontier
j he was taken by the police as the
j brains of a revolutionary plot, but his
1 mistaken identity was proved after
) a series of picturesque episodes, and
| everyone involved parted the best of
j friends.
Mr. Hilton became a devotee of
j Brazil, not only of the great cities of
Sao Paulo and Rio, and the lovely
coastal range, but above all of a
: culture which combines so happily
i the virtues of Portuguese, French.
! Italian, and, more recently, Anglo
-1 Saxon civilization.
Through his work as editor of
| "Who's Who in Latin America"and
| associate editor of '"Who's Who in
j America," Mr. Hilton was able to
! meet hundreds of the most prominent
' Latin Americans infill fields of activ
j ity. All in all, he feels most grateful
; to have had such an unusual oppor
j tunity to study at close range all the
regions of Latin America and all the
j aspects of its life.

which he is editor, Ronald Hilton,
associate professor of Romanic lan
guages, spent the last 10 months
journeying through Latin America.
His itinerary took him through
Mexico, Central America, and Pana
ma, down the west coast of South
America as far the lakes in southern
Chile, across to Argentina, up the
east coast of South America, through
the Caribbean countries, and back
to the United States through Yucatan
and Mexico City.
He spent some time in each of the
20 Latin American republics, and saw
not only the capitals but nearly all
the large provincial cities, thousands
of small towns, and much of the hin
terland of a largely uninhabited
country.
Not a Paratrooper
Professor Hilton was unwilling to
allow himself to be classified as a
paratrooper (paracaidista) as are
most North Americans who content
themselves with airplane hops from
capital to capital. So he made a
point of traveling on the surface as
far as possible.
While traveling across Ecuador,
Mr. Hilton rode on the most fan
tastic mountain road he has seen in
any of his wide travels—a trip with
lingering memories, since the front
left wheel flew off without warning
and only the incredible skill of a
Latin-American driver allowed him

I to keep his travels on the earth's
i surface, as planned.
