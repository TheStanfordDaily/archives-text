# Dogemobile Famous As Farm Tradition

### BETH MacVICAR 
The D. G. and Monroe Hall "Doge
| mobile," which can be seen at almost
j any time collecting dirt in front of
J Monroe, out of gas on Palm Drive,
or mowing down little children in
J the dead of night, is faM taking its
i place in Stanford life along with the
j Cellar's hamburgers and the special
i delivery man.
Won in the famous battle-royal of
| last quarter's bond auction, the DG's
and Monroe men paid over §12.000
j for this 17-passenger Buick that had
j a year before sold for $30.
According to Owner and Iveeper
of-the-gas-coupons, Ed Luce, the
Dogemobile is a wonderful car. It's
a Roadmaster Deluxe, vintage of
i 1928, and has a non-working heating
I system and windshield wipers.
Noisy Steering Wheel
I It's easy to tell when the ''Doge
mobile" is approaching because the
steering wheel makes even more
i noise the the motor. Professional car
stealers are warned to keep hands
off, for althought there is no key, the
car 'invariably runs out of gas.
The "Dogemobile" spent one unus
| ually long session parked gasless and
| deserted on Palm Drive, at which
time tourists expressed great delight
| at this newest of museum pieces. Be-
I sides, the "Doge" shifts backward.
I Origin of "Doge"
The name "dogemobile" originated
when Monroe men began calling one
another "doge"—probably an old
Southern custom. Since then, there
has been a question as to spelling—
some prefer the French spelling,
deaugmobile.
The history of the purchase of the
car involves diplomacy between
Monroe, and the Chi O's, the Kappas
and at length the DG's. At the bond

auction the DG-Monroe coalition bid
$12,000, thus outbidding all competi
tors. The next afternoon they drove
the doge to Palo Alto and solicited
$2,000 to help beat Cal. Since then
the joint ownership has been regu
lated by the following rule:
Capacity, 17 Persons
A minimum of five DG's, five Mon
roe men or five mixed company is
needed before it can be used. This
is a conservative ruling, as the Doge's
capacity is close to 17.
The Dogemobile (bright red, with
the DG anchor on one side and the
Axe painted on the other) may soon
be retired. No, it's not the gas situ
ation, or diplomatic relations; "it's
the fan belt." according to Luce.

Won in the famous battle-royal of

and Monroe men paid over §12.000
j for this 17-passenger Buick that had

According to Owner and Iveeper
of-the-gas-coupons, Ed Luce, the
Dogemobile is a wonderful car. It's
a Roadmaster Deluxe, vintage of
i 1928, and has a non-working heating
I system and windshield wipers.
Noisy Steering Wheel
I It's easy to tell when the ''Doge
mobile" is approaching because the
steering wheel makes even more
i noise the the motor. Professional car
stealers are warned to keep hands
off, for althought there is no key, the
car 'invariably runs out of gas.
The "Dogemobile" spent one unus
| ually long session parked gasless and
| deserted on Palm Drive, at which
time tourists expressed great delight
| at this newest of museum pieces. Be-
I sides, the "Doge" shifts backward.
I Origin of "Doge"
The name "dogemobile" originated
when Monroe men began calling one
another "doge"—probably an old
Southern custom. Since then, there
has been a question as to spelling—
some prefer the French spelling,
deaugmobile.
The history of the purchase of the
car involves diplomacy between
Monroe, and the Chi O's, the Kappas
and at length the DG's. At the bond

auction the DG-Monroe coalition bid
$12,000, thus outbidding all competi
tors. The next afternoon they drove
the doge to Palo Alto and solicited
$2,000 to help beat Cal. Since then
the joint ownership has been regu
lated by the following rule:
Capacity, 17 Persons
A minimum of five DG's, five Mon
roe men or five mixed company is
needed before it can be used. This
is a conservative ruling, as the Doge's
capacity is close to 17.
The Dogemobile (bright red, with
the DG anchor on one side and the
Axe painted on the other) may soon
be retired. No, it's not the gas situ
ation, or diplomatic relations; "it's
the fan belt." according to Luce.
