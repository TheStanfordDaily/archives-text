# Women To Reign At Sadie Hawkins
## 
### 
Bids for the Sadie Hawkins dance
will go on sale Friday, in the A.S.S.U.
office, and the women who get there
first with the $1.43 will be certain of
attending the most different dance of
the quarter, according to Barbara
White, in charge of patrons for the
dance.
The chairman of the dance said
that he'd like to award a loving cup
to the women's living group showing
up at the dance with the largest per
centage of men, but that due to the
war, loving cups are hard to get,
and some sort of prize will be
awarded which doesn't conflict with
war shortages.

In order to compute the percen
tages fairly, each woman, when she
buys her bid. will put down the name
of her living group, and from this list
the total per cents will be figured.
