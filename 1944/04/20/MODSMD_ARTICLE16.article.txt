# THIS IS OUR POLICY

THE EDITORIAL BOARD of the Daily is rejoicing. Why? Be
cause yesterday's campus opinon letter was the kind of contri
bution we like to see. It wasn't just a crank letter, complaining
of one thing or another; it was a criticism, a constructive one, and
was written in a sincere style.
In answer to it we have this to say:
The reason the Daily freguently does not delve editorially into
matters of national and international concern is because its edi
torial writers do not feel it their place to influence readers on such
broad problems. Each writer does have opinions on these prob
lems, many of which are as well founded as those of several
writers on metropolitan papers. But what the Daily does not
want to become is a shouting, opinionated college sheet, voicing
definite opinions on matters which are better left to those who
have studied them.
Associate Editors Dave Davis ad Nancy Tilden write (usually
weekly) an editorial on some pertinent national or international
situation. Associated Press dispatches are daily given good, if
not the best, display, and the column, "Views on Your War," is
designed to stimulate thought, although not to form opinion.
That is the extent to which the Daily covers national and inter
national affairs.
A few other West Coast college papers, by their fiery edi
torials on world-wide problems, do stimulate thought and also
succeed in getting mentioned in various metropolitan papers, i
Perhaps a splashy paper such as this is the only kind that can
hape to make its readers think or to arouse their interest. But
the Daily does not aim to become such a paper. So much for our I
policy on world news.
To clarify our editorial policy as a whole, we have this to '
say, although we have said it before:
There are two theories which concern a paper's place in a !
community. One of them is that a paper should primarily serve
as a leader, be strong editorially—a molder of opinions. It
should look at the community, search for something to improve,!
and then begin to crusade.
The other is that a paper should be a news paper and should
not attempt to mold the opinion of its readers. It should do
nothing but report the straight news—facts and figures.
For the most part, it is upon this latter theory that the Daily is
based. Our editorial policy is simple, and we have had only one
axe to grind: We have tried and will continue to try to hold the
campus together. To some extent we feel successful, not only ;
because we have mentioned some things, but also because we 1
hav let some things go unsaid.
Whenever something comes up on the campus that needs |
clarification or whenever an issue arises over some campus busi- J
ness, the Daily- hopes to recognize it and to comment on it in
the editoral columns. Sometimes, or at least in the past, we have
been able to improve a situation by talking to a person or or
ganization leader before writing an editorial against his actions.
So that is our editorial policy—if you can call it a policy. The 1
Daily is primarily a newspaper, taking editorial stands only when
they are warranted and when they can benefit someone or some
thing worthwhile.
