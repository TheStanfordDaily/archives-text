The situation in Italy seems stagnant. We stop to wonder just what is the
difficulty both politically and militarily. As it stands now. the only ones
benefitting by our occupation of Italy are the Italians. The Germans cer
tainly aren't. Surely we aren't.
When the United States and British forces stepped into a demoralized

Italy last autumn, they were wel
comed with open arms. Most of the
Italian military forces laid down
their arms and rushed to greet the
Yanks and Tommies. Because of the
temporary paralysis of the Germans
due to a sudden and intense landing,
advance was easy.
Then came Naples—and a third of
Italy was conquered.
The jubilant cry went up from
Americans—"We're on the road to
Rome." Many military news analysts
and observers had us facing a Ger
man last-ditch stand on the Po river
in the Italian piedmont within a very
few days. Rome was hit, and hit
hard by Mediterranean bombers.
The situation looked good for a rapid
Allied advance toward Rome.
But they stopped us cold at Cas
sino.
Before Cassino General Mud had
been figuring quite prominently in
the Allied advance. He stepped in at
the Volturno —but soon the intrepid
army engineers had the Allies across
the rapidly flooding river.
Soon the Volturno was behind and
then came the mountains, rain, mud,
rain, and more mud, and Cassino.
We're still on the road to Rome, bat
tling a hard-fighting and war-wise
foe.
Cassino to date has been con
sistently pulverized by American
artillery and bombs. It is not unusual
to read of a fleet of bombers from
the Mediterranean bomber command
dropping 2,500 tons of bombs on this
little village. Immediately following
this gigantic air pulverization, Amer
ican artillery, mostly in the form of
15-millimeter rifles (Long Toms),
open up.
Veteran German soldiers, captured
in the fighting around the city, have
said they never have faced a more
concentrated fire. Yet resistance
continues.
Temporary allied infantry ad
vances into the city have found
Yanks and Tommies holding one
end of a large wall and the Germans
holding the other. Not only has Cas
sino stopped us cold, but the Anzio
beachhead has remained in a static
condition.
Can it be that Italy is just a holding
action?
Politically Italy is in a mess. Re
cently Marshal Badoglio resigned
with his full cabinet and was imme
diately reappointed as head of a
junta, composed mostly of Com
munists. For the most part the po
litical situation in Italy is too in
volved for disentanglement within
these confines.
Yet the allied military government
in Italy and Sicily must be given full
credit for the job they have done and
are doing, both politically and in
their dealings with the people. The
government now is faced with some
of the toughest problems ever faced
by a government, let alone a govern
ment of occupation. Here at home
we think the black market is bad. In
Italy, the people who have been un
der Fascist rule for so long have
developed a very efficient black
market. It is very difficult for them
to realize that it is not necessary
under allied occupation.
Since the AMG is anti-fascist, they
are attempting to locate most of the
anti-fascist leaders in Italy for the
formation of a common front against
the movement. Cooperation between
the allied military leaders and the
anti-fascists is necessary if the
problem is to be licked in short order.
But most of the anti-fascists have
taken to the underground and cannot
believe in their own minds that they
will not be punished if they bring
their fight out in the open.
Such is the situation facing the oc
cupational government in Italy and
Sicily.
As an interesting sidelight, Dr. Rob
ert W. Desmond, former journalism
professor at Stanford and the Uni
versity ot California is now a major
with the AMG in Sicilv.
