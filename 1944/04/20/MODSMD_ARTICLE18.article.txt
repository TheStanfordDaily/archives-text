# Men Face Fate At Hawkins Hop
## 
### 
With the decrease in the ratio from
3 to 1 in favor of the men to 1.1 to 1
in favor of the women, Dick Bartle,
chairman of the Sadie Hawkins
dance, foresees a dreadful fate for
those women who don't get their
dates for the dance early. Bartle
says,"It means that the women who
delay will either be left out entirely,
or else they will have to ask Monroe
boys as a last resort." With this
warning in mind, Stanford women
had better not wait until the last
minute.

The only restriction placed upon
freshmen who will attend the dance
from 9 to 1 in the Women's Gym is
that they must wear shoes, and with
rationing, one night's wearing will
be pretty hard on them, according to
Bartle.
The prize to be awarded to the
living group appearing with the
greatest percentage of men is still a
deep mystery, which will be revealed
sometime next week. Lagunita will
be divided into casas; Roble into cor
ridors; and Union into units.
"Each woman should be sure to
put down the name of the living
group she is representing so that it
may be computed in the ratios," ac
cording to Dick Bartle.
