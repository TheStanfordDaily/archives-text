# REVIEW
## String Quartet Rated Excellent 
### 
And the three Graces descended
and bestowed their special favor
Tuesday night upon the playing of
the San Francisco String Quartet
iii Memorial Hall.
The quartet — Naoum and Boris
Blinder, William Wolsky, and Ferene
Molnar—were joined in their second
selection, Franck's F minor quintet,
by Frances Stockton, whose mascu
line piano style established body for
an effect more of an orchestra than of
five instruments.
As with that of the Franck, the
renditions of the other two numbers,
Beethoven's Quartet in F major, opus
18, No. 1, and Debussy's Quartet in
G minor, opus 10, and particularly
the muted movement of the latter,
were left with no apparent possi
bility of further improvement. —
