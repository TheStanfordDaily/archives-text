# Dr. Tresidder Pays Visit to Buchanan Hall
## 
### J.D. WILLIAMS 
(Buchanan Hall)
Beside a Buchanan fireside last
night, a group of Stanford sons met
their Stanford father. The occasion

was so rn e t li 1 n g
new for this con
verted Fjii house:
The first meeting
of its Wednesday-
Night Forum, and
its first guest. Dr.
Tresidder.
At the dinner
table he was sere
naded with the
"Ballad of Paddy
Mur p h y," the
"Shreveport Fer
ry,' and the
"W hiffenpoof
Song."

Serenade and History
After retirement to the front room
and its blazing fire, he was serenaded
again—if it can be called that—by
question after question about the
secrets of the Hoover War Libe,
Stanford's financial standing and
history, the "old days" as he remem
ebred them, and the personalities and
lives of Mr. and Mrs. Stanford.
To these questions, Dr.Tresidder
proffered ready answers, made in
teresting and vital to those around
him by the inclusion of personal re
flections and stories. Listening to the
President last night, meeting him on
the ground he likes best—with his
Stanford family—gave the men of
Buchanan and McKinley halls an
other picture of the man whose sin
cerity and determination won them
at the assembly on Stanford's future
last quarter.
What Troubles Are
Talking over the past—the early
suit with the government, the earth
quake, the threatened closure of the
school—made the problems of out
class seem small in comparison.
So ended the first meeting of the
President with part of his family.
With a new friend on their lists and
some new stories in their memories,
this group of Stanford men bade
farewell to President Tresidder with
an appropriate "Come Join the Band."


DR. TRESIDDER
