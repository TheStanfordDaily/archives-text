# More Girls Needed to Enroll in USO Course For Hostess Etiquette
## 
### 
Four interesting lectures are being planned for the USO hostess course,
which will be given this quarter if more girls sign up, announced Dickie
Shainwald and Nancy Banning, cochairmen.
One of the lectures will deal with the do's and don'ts of dress, and will
be presented in skit form. The subject for another lecture will be the men

who have returned from overseas
and how they are affected by the
war.
Prominent guest speakers will be
invited for the lectures. The first
lecture will be May 5 and the others
will continue through May 26. They
will be given Friday afternoons from
1 to 2.
Girls interested in taking the
course are urged to sign up at once.
Sign-up sheets have been placed in
Roble, Lagunita, Ventura, Union, and
the War Board office.
Each girl completing the course
will receive a certificate that will
entitle her to work in any USO club
or canteen as a Junior Hostess.
