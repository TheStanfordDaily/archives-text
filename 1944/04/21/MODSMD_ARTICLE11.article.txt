## Blow Possible Opening Of All-Out Offensive 
### 
LONDON (UP) —Close to 1,000 American Flying Fortresses and Liber
ators, possibly opening an all-out offensive against the French invasion
| coast, today took over the task of blasting in the Nazi's steel and con
crete "Atlantic Wall."
j Striking late in the afternoon the heavy bombers flew as part of an

estimated force of 2,000 allied war
planes that streaked across the Eng
lish Channel to bomb a path to Ber
lin for allied expeditionary armies.
Earlier bad weather had restricted
the pre-invasion air assault on Eu
rope.
The Britain-based attacks fol
lowed a heavy pre-dawn RAF as
sault from the south of Plovdiv, Bul
garia's second city that carried for
ward the allied air campaign against
the Germans' Balkan rail communi
cations.
Taking off in "very great strength"
for the third straight day, the U.S.
Flying Fortresses and Liberators
concentrated their attack on north
western France—possibly the Cher
bourg peninsula—while hundreds of
U.S. Ninth Air Force Marauders and
British medium bombers, U.S. fight
er bombers and fighters lashed forti
fications along the coast from Calais
to LeHavre.
