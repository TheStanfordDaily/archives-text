# SING ON FRIDAY
## 
### 
The Spring Sing, annual big event held in
the Frost Amphitheater, has been set tor May
4, Thursday evening, and Stanford men and
women are hard at work figuring out arrange
ments that will win over the hearts and ears of
the judges.
It promises to be as big an event as ever with
several of the men's and women's living groups
signed up, an Army group, the Med School
groups, and maybe even a group of student
nurses from Stanford Lane Hospital. But it's on
Thursday night.
Thursday is a good night, as nights go, but
it might be a belter plan to schedule the Sing
for Friday night, May 5.
Not as many persons have Saturday morn
ing classes, all women have 12 o'clocks, and
Friday is considered the beginning of the
weekend.
If the Sing were held on Friday, a dance
could follow at the Nitery. There could be
refreshments, entertainment, and all other
things that go toward making a good dance.
Or maybe the Women's Clubhouse could
be opened, with ping-pong tables set up or
bridge games or something. Maybe the same
group who sang at the All-University assembly
at the end of last quarter could give out with
the same sort of entertainment.
The point is—why not hold the Spring Sing
on Friday night and really make a night of it?
Tonight's open house sing at Roble should
point out the advantages.
