### BLARNEY GUGEL BULL HYER 
It has been suggested that we include the
names of some prominent people on campus in
Bullsession. Here's a whole bunch of them:
Dick Driscoll, Luana Forkner, Rick Supple,
Norma Schieber, Moofie Faris, "Black Jim" Rey
nolds, Carol Hurwitz, Dick Bartle, Alice Tuttle
(she's Pledge Card Chairman of the War Board
Auxiliary), Jean Levinson, Nan Tillson, Gordy
Davis, Henrietta Nussbaum, Mary Lou Patton,
De-De De Friest, Fred Maguire, etc.
On the other hand, here's a whole stack of
people who aren't prominent on campus:
Takimoto Funk, Sabu Shapiro, Hamurabi
Walkingcane, Drusilla Thrump, Archibald
Thrump, Mrs. Archibald Thrump, John Hoff,
Tondelayo O'Toole, Luigi Chung, O. B. Reilly,
etc., etc., etc.
In all fairness we might as well present a
few names that are prominent off campus:
Winston Churchill, Dick Tracy, Mahatma
Gandhi, Alban Barkley, Charles Chaplin, Simon
Bolivar, Shirley Temple, Ray Lyman Wilbur,
Joel Kupperman, Lud Beethoven, Nick Rimsky-
Korsakoff, Jack Brahms, H. V. Kaltenborn, Sam
Goldwyn, etc., tc.
Unfortunately there is a shortage of space
and we will be unable to print a list of people
not prominent off campus; people off, not prom
inent on campus; people on, not prominent off
campus; and campus people not on prominent
offs.
