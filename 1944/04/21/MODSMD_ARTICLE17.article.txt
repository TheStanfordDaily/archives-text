The big lid is off in Europe. After yesterday's
30-hour onslaught on the continent during which
time over 300 tons of bombs an hour were
showered on Festung Europa—the whole 2,000-
mile coast line from Narvik in the north to the
Spanish border in the south has been alerted.
The German high command ordered all its
garrisons on the alert to repel a gigantic Allied
amphibious assault that "might strike at any
place at any hour!"
We hope this is the real thing and not just
a periodic stepped-up assault that has been
common to the British and American bomber
commands in England during the past year.
Outstanding, of course, is British Prime Min
ister Churchill's statement that 1944 would be
an invasion year. The aerial assaults on Ger
many's vital industries have been constantly
stepped up. Saturation raids on various parts
of the French invasion coast have been more
numerous within recent weeks. And now —
a 30-hour raid over the continent.
Another thought is that summer is rapidly ap
proaching and the Allied staffs wish to avoid
any mud impeding their land assaults on the
continent. That merely brackets the available
time in which to begin operations. What the
Allied forces are apt to run up against in their
assault is something else again. There have
been many speculations—both fact and fancy.
In relation to the pending invasion—there is
something that is hard to understand. The Rus
sians are within 45 miles of Lwow, Old Poland,
on the central front; they are hammering at the
gates of Sevastopol in the south, and are mov
ing right along in the north. This advance cer
tainly gives them plenty of space for advance
fighter and bomber bases. Why then—since
they are so close to Germany—don't they bomb
the daylights out of the roofless fortress?
The Russians were supposed to have a large
fleet of bombers when the war started. Through
lend-lease we are providing many fighter planes
—both ground strafers and high altitude com
bat planes. That is the successful combination
to a great team the Allies have been using
with great results.
Russia has enough raw materials to manu
facture bombs in quantity. So then why does
she hesitate to beleaguer the Germans from
the air as she daily does on the ground? The
question is a big one and as far as we know—
there have been no such plans drawn up by
the Russians.
Should the Russians attempt bombing Ger
many from the east it would relieve a good
many situations in the West and would tend
to clean up this whole mess a lot quicker.
However, publicly there has been a lack of
suggestion on our part that the Russians do
this. It is typical of our bend-over-backwards
we - admire - you - you're-too-big policy toward
Russia.
As a whole—the war has a bad case of dol
drums.
You will recall however that v/e have had
two just such dead spells since our entrance
into the European war.
One occurred in 1942 just before we walked
into North Africa. Another occurred just be
fore we romped through Sicily. We didn't have
time to catch our breath between Sicily and
Italy, but had conditions not been right for
invasion at that time in Italy, we doubtless
would have experienced just such a lull as we
are going through now. So expect big things
within the next few weeks.
Don't expect the impending operations to be
bloodless. The war will doubtless strike much
closer to your home and mine during the next
few months and it is only right that we prepare
ourselves for the blow.
We can't expect to wipe out fascism and
have all our friends, brothers, relatives and
sweethearts return safe and sound. It is a mor
bid thought—but true.

she hesitate to beleaguer the Germans from
the air as she daily does on the ground? The
question is a big one and as far as we know—
there have been no such plans drawn up by
the Russians.
Should the Russians attempt bombing Ger
many from the east it would relieve a good
many situations in the West and would tend
to clean up this whole mess a lot quicker.
However, publicly there has been a lack of
suggestion on our part that the Russians do
this. It is typical of our bend-over-backwards
we - admire - you - you're-too-big policy toward
Russia.
As a whole—the war has a bad case of dol
drums.
You will recall however that v/e have had
two just such dead spells since our entrance
into the European war.
One occurred in 1942 just before we walked
into North Africa. Another occurred just be
fore we romped through Sicily. We didn't have
time to catch our breath between Sicily and
Italy, but had conditions not been right for
invasion at that time in Italy, we doubtless
would have experienced just such a lull as we
are going through now. So expect big things
within the next few weeks.
Don't expect the impending operations to be
bloodless. The war will doubtless strike much
closer to your home and mine during the next
few months and it is only right that we prepare
ourselves for the blow.
We can't expect to wipe out fascism and
have all our friends, brothers, relatives and
sweethearts return safe and sound. It is a mor
bid thought—but true.
The big lid is off in Europe. After yesterday's
30-hour onslaught on the continent during which
time over 300 tons of bombs an hour were
showered on Festung Europa—the whole 2,000-
mile coast line from Narvik in the north to the
Spanish border in the south has been alerted.
The German high command ordered all its
garrisons on the alert to repel a gigantic Allied
amphibious assault that "might strike at any
place at any hour!"
We hope this is the real thing and not just
a periodic stepped-up assault that has been
common to the British and American bomber
commands in England during the past year.
Outstanding, of course, is British Prime Min
ister Churchill's statement that 1944 would be
an invasion year. The aerial assaults on Ger
many's vital industries have been constantly
stepped up. Saturation raids on various parts
of the French invasion coast have been more
numerous within recent weeks. And now —
a 30-hour raid over the continent.
Another thought is that summer is rapidly ap
proaching and the Allied staffs wish to avoid
any mud impeding their land assaults on the
continent. That merely brackets the available
time in which to begin operations. What the
Allied forces are apt to run up against in their
assault is something else again. There have
been many speculations—both fact and fancy.
In relation to the pending invasion—there is
something that is hard to understand. The Rus
sians are within 45 miles of Lwow, Old Poland,
on the central front; they are hammering at the
gates of Sevastopol in the south, and are mov
ing right along in the north. This advance cer
tainly gives them plenty of space for advance
fighter and bomber bases. Why then—since
they are so close to Germany—don't they bomb
the daylights out of the roofless fortress?
The Russians were supposed to have a large
fleet of bombers when the war started. Through
lend-lease we are providing many fighter planes
—both ground strafers and high altitude com
bat planes. That is the successful combination
to a great team the Allies have been using
with great results.
Russia has enough raw materials to manu
facture bombs in quantity. So then why does
she hesitate to beleaguer the Germans from
the air as she daily does on the ground? The
question is a big one and as far as we know—
there have been no such plans drawn up by
