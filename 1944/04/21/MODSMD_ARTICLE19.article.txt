# Stanford Orchestra Lists Spring Melodies
## 
### 
Spiced by an excellent string sec
tion, the Stanford Orchestra has
tormulated its plans for spring quar
ter and is on the road to becoming a
compact, smooth-running organiza
tion, according to Ferenc Molnar, di
rector of the orchestra and associate
protessor of music.
"The string section is extraor
dinary .... the best I have heard in
the Fast five years," Mr. Molnar com
mented.
Orchestra members chose their of
ficers and planned the program for a
-pi ing concert to - be presented on
June 14 in Memorial Hall. Bruce Al
l;ui was elected ' president; Anne
Stuart, secretary; Bill Mack and
Gordon Reisback, alternating as li
â€¢arian and personnel manager; and
Harriet Behring, publicity.
Twenty-eight members attended
the rehearsal last week, and open
ings are still available for interested
musicians, Mr. Molnar said. The full

orchestra will include 45 to 50 stu
dents, members of the faculty, and
Palo Alto musicians. Places may be
filled by one clarinet, one oboe, one
double basso, one trombone, one
trumpet, and several percussion in
struments.
The program for the June 14 con
cert is varied and highlighted by solo
selections. A Wagner arrangement
of Gluck's 1 phigenie in Aulis will
be presented, and a bassoon concerto
by Bruce Allan, who formerly played
by the Tacoma, Wash, symphony
orchestra. A concerto will be played
by two solo violins, followed by the
orchestra's arrangement of George
Gershwin's "Porgy and Bess."
Mr. Molnar directs the orchestra
and Elwyn Bugge, assistant professor
of physical education, is faculty
managet\
