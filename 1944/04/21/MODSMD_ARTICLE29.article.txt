### ROGER CORMAN 
Today marks the end of the sports
writing career of one member of the
sports staff and the promotion of two
reporters to fill his place. Being in
ducted into the Army is Co-Sports
Editor Jim Weinberg, who did such
a capable job of editing and writing
that we've had to appoint both Dick
Block and Joe Zukin to assistant
sports editorships to take up the job
where he left off.
Carrying on as sports editor, I'll be
working wtih Dick, Joe, and the rest
of the revised staff to bring you a
complete coverage of local sports
news.
Murals May Die
Unless something is done in a
hurry, mural sports around the Farm
this quarter are going to be a sad,
sad affair. The signups for the swim
ming and track meets have been dis
appointing, while the entries for soft
ball have just barely reached the
mark where a league can be formed.
It's certain that a league will be
put together, but at least five more
teams are needed before a full sched
ule of games can be slated. Time and
again the members of the halls have
stated that they wanted mural sports.
If this is the best they can do when
they have the chance, maybe the best
thing to do is to drop all forms of
competitive athletics and form chess
and checker leagues for the more
athletic men in the student body.
All Organizations Welcome
It was stated that only valid or
ganizations could enter this quarter.
This should be clarified by the state
ment that practically any organiza
tion that plays with eligible men is
valid.
