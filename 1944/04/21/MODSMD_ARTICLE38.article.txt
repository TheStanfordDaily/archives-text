### 
The National Roster is sending out
, ''Student Questionnaires" to college
! students majoring in engineering,
j chemistry, physics, mathematics,
j meteorology, or geology, who will
I graduate on or before July 1, 1044.
In addition they are asking for the
college record of these students.
As the National Roster furnishes
advice to the armed services for the
best possible utilization of qualified
professional and scientific personnel,
it is necessary that they have the
above information. The cooperation
of those students is requested.
If a student receives a notice that
he has passed his pre-induction
physical examination, he should im
mediately notify the National Roster
office at Washington advising them
[ of that fact and of the branch of the
! service he expects to enter. It may
be possible for the National Roster
j to assist in placing him in work in
| which his training and experience
will be utilized.
