# Frosh Will Attend 'Sing' at 7 Tonight
## 
### 
The first freshman class activity
this quarter will be a Frosh Sing to
night. Favorite Stanford and Roble
songs will be sung in the Roble lobby
from 7 to 8 o'clock.
If the group is large enough, they
will serenade the Row, according to
Lyle Davis, secretary of the fresh
man class. Freshmen from all the
living groups on campus are invited,
and it is hoped there will be a large
turnout.
