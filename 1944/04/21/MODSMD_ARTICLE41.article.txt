The next time Mr. J. H. Walker
sees an American boy in uniform,
will he put a bullet through his
[heart? Chances are against it.
The San Francisco News (4/19/44)
describes Mr. Walker as a "Cauca
sian" property-owner who, with 27
others, got. a "permanent injunction
banning Mabel Tseng from living in
a building she owns,"
Reason? Mabel Tseng is Chinese.
:iike 450,000,000 of our allies whose
blood and spirit have helped keep
the bulk of the Japanese away from
our front porches for seven years.
3ut Mabel Tseng's neighborhood, in
the eyes of these 28 property-own
ers, needs no allies. They are plan
ning more injunctions. It's "for
White only."
Without discussing what the real
Caucasians—the folks who drove
Hitler and his race-hatred out of
the Caucasus with their multi-na
tional Russian Army—would say
about this misuse of their natne, let
us see what some results of acts like
these could be:
1. Hitler. Tojo, and the puppets
will find material for their radio
scripts.
2. In their aggregate, these acts
will cost the lives of American sol
diers, by playing into the hands of
an enemy whose one remaining hope
is to breed distrust and disunity
among the peoples fighting for free
dom.
3. Such acts furnish people like

I the writer and his fellow soldiers
j studying the Far East with a rough
j problem—how are we going to ex
plain Mr. Walker and his "Cauca-
J sians" to the Chinese people, to the
■ Indonesians, to the Indians and Bur
| mese? Will we get time to explain
j that our President, the majority of
! our people, and the hulk of our
fighting men are fighting precisely
against discrimination and hatred
among peoples? Or will the enemy
| bullet whistle out of the darkness
while we're in the middle of our
j explanations?
Our Stanford AST Unit is a shin
ing example of friendship and co
operation between people of all na
tions, colors, and creeds.
Think, then, 28 "Caucasians" of San
Francisco—think, fomenters of dis
unity and writers of enemy propa
ganda everywhere, both the con
scious fomenters and the unknow
ing, both the ones not yet aware of
the new fact of United Nations unity
against fascism, and those blinded
by selfish interests—
You would not kill an American
soldier personally, but you would
contribute to their deaths and the
dragging out of the war.
Think, America — Chinese, Rus
sians, French, Yugoslavs scorched
their precious earth of things that
would aid the enemy. Can we not
at least scorch our minds of treason
able prejudices, and root these un-
American influences forever out of
our national life?
