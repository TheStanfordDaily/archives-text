### 
The sports outlook for Stanford Army trainees is not too bright. The
Army Student Council athletic chairman. Mike Donahue, has formulated
plans for various activities, such as intramural softhall. soccer, and table
(Minis, llcictofoic such uctivitics have heen successful at this unit; now,
however, several difficulties have appeared.
Due to the intensive nature of the courses still being offered in ASTP,

trainees have only a limited amount
of time in which they may partici
pate in activities of this sort. The
physical training periods which have
usually been devoted to intramural
sports have now been incorporated
into a definite schedule, which has
hardly any provision for variation
from the Army's requirements.
There is a considerable amount of
interest in these proposed leagues.
Many soldier-students signed sheets
which were posted on the company
bulletin boards to help in organizing
teams.
The value of intramural sports was
stressed at the last meeting of the
Army council, which was attended
by Major Andersen. Although no
direct decision was made at that
time, the council was informed that
students will at least be allowed one
of their physical training periods
per week to take part in the league
competition. The arrangement will
be for the men to take their calis
thenics and then be permitted to de
vote the remainder of the period to
playing off the intramural games.
Mike Donohue reports that about
fit teen teams have indicated a desire
to compete. The language and area
students of Company A show prom
ise of getting off to a head start,
since they have been together here
at Stanford for a much longer pe
riod than most of the students in
Company C, who have come here
from schools all over the West and
Southwest.
