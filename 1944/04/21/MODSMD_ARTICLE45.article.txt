# Mills College Offers Exhibit
## 
### 
April 30 will mark the opening of
i an interesting and unusual exhibi
; tion in the Mills College Art Gallery
i where will be shown a collection of
; well-made objects for daily u.se. The
| exhibition, which has been sent out
from the Museum of Modern Art in
New York, furnishes the answer to
I the question of what is good design
' in useful objects. The purpose of the
■ exhibition is to evaluate the most
1 important qualities of well-designed
objects. They include objects of pot-»
j tery, glassware, china, household
utensils and accessories, leather
goods, scientific instruments, and so
forth. In judging the finished ob
jects, function, material, method of
j manufacture, and the tastes of the
I designer are considered.
Sixty objects, mounted on wall
panels and shelves, are adequately
labeled with information regarding
| their qualities.
The exhibition will continue
' through May 21 and will be followed
by the annual exhibition of the best
work of Mills students in the de
| partment of art, including household
I arts.
Shown concurrently will be an ex
hibit of old master drawings from
; the Phelan Collection, lent to Mills
I by the California Palace of the Le
i gion of Honor Museum in San Fran-
I cisco.
