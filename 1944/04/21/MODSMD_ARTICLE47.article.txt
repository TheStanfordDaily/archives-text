# Behind the Fountain Lies The Heart of Stanford
## 
### JANET OSSMAN 
The Stanford Library with its stretch of green lawn and fountain is one
of the most impressive buildings on the campus. Most students are ac
quainted with the Reserved Reading room and the fiction and reference
stacks, and they have sat on the steps to enjoy a cigarette between classes,
but they have failed to take advantage of many of the opportunities which

the Libe affords.
On the top floor of the library is
located the Rare Book room, which
was established in 1931 to house
many valuable manuscripts and old
books which had been given to the
University.
The Rare Book room boasts of
wood-engraved blockbooks dated in
the early 15th century, of bound an
cient manuscripts, and also of a first
Shakespeare folio.
Render Collection
One of the most famous collections
is that of Albert M. Bender, which
includes modern imprints and some
works of the old masters. The mod
ern imprints are made available by
the process of microphotography.
The original documents are photo
graphed on tiny film, and then re
printed to produce facsimile editions.
The Charlotte Felton Library, lo
cated on the third floor of the build
ing, has in its possession a very val
uable collection of Bliss Carmen's
manuscripts and also the papers of
Mark Hopkins, Leland and Jane
Stanford, David Starr Jordan, and
Dr. John Caspar Branner. All are
available to Stanford students.
Hopkins Library
One oÂ£ the Libe's most unusual
features is the Hopkins Transporta
tion Library. The need for a trans
portation library was seen late in the
last century by leading Americans,
and Stanford was chosen for such a
library because it was near San
Francisco, a great center of trans
portation and commerce.
The documents of the original li
brary were collected by Timothj'
Hopkins, the adopted son of Mark
Hopkins, while he was treasurer of

the Southern Pacific Railroad. It
was presented to Stanford as a gilt
in 1892 at which time it consisted of
2.000 books and pamphlets. Later il
was enlarged to include all transpor
tation, nol just railroads.
This library's prize possessions are
a description of the plan for the first
steamship, an early 1825 edition of
ihe "American Mechanics Magazine,
and such museum pieces as the silver
sledge hammer and the gold and
silver spikes which were used by
Governor Stanford wnen he drove
the spikes that joined the Southern
Pacific and Union Pacific railroads
at Promentory Point, Utah.
