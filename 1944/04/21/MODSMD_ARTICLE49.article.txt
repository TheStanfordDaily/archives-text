### 
Two former Stanford men won
distinction not far from their alma '
mater this morning by being ap- ,
pointed to positions on the Board of
Directors of the Palo Alto Chamber
of Commerce. The two men are i
David Packard and Gilman Gist, Jr. !
Mr. Packard spent four years
training in electrical engineering,
alter he had been graduated from
this University, at the General Elec
tric Company's laboratories in New
York. With this wealth of practical
experience behind him, he returned
in 1938 for further work at Stanford.
In 1939 he received a degree in engi
neering. It was with a good back
ground, then, that he became a part
ner in the Hewlett-Packard Com
pany of Palo Alto.
Mr. Gist, once editor of the Chap
arral, was graduated from Stanford
in 1937. Following his journalistic
tendencies, the young man engaged
in the advertising business, in which
he still engages now. After gradua
tion, Mr. Gist settled permanently in
Palo Alto, in which city he has re
sided now foi over 12 years.
Mr. Packard is filling a vacancy
left on the board by Mr. David Cam
eron, whom the armed services has
called away, Mr. Gist will, on the
other hand, fill a new position, that of
assistant to the president.
