WASHINGTON (UP) â€” Secretary
of the Navy Frank Knox, Secretary
of War Henry L. Slimson, and Mari
time Commission Chairman Emory
Land asserted today that limited
service legislation is mandatory to
(ill gaps in war industry created by
induction.
Reporting that the armed forces
must induct 1,400,000 additional men
by the end of the year, they recom
mended in a joint statement that
Congress enact legislation authoriz
ing voluntary recruitment as a pre
liminary measure but invoking selec
tive service principles when needed.
The recommendation followed a
statement by the House Military Af
fairs Committee accusing the War
and Navy departments of lack of
cooperation in channeling 4-F's into
war work and reiterating a proposal
that they induct physically unfit men
in nonessential occupations.
