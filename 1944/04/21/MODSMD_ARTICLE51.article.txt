# 'The Cross of Lorraine' Not Just a Propaganda Movie
## 
### 
'"The Cross of Lorraine," MGM's
latest war inspiration, is saved from
being "just another propaganda pic
ture" by the superb acting of Gene
Kelly, the excellent characterizations
of all players, and ihe well-handled
interpretation of the Free-French
movement. Gullible movie-goers will
overlook the blood and gore and ex
cessive propaganda found in the lat
ter half of the picture in considera
tion of its many good points.
The surrender of France, the re
action of French royalists as well as
Nazi sympathizers, and the condi
tions of the prison camp to which
they are sent, are all related through
the medium of incidents in the lives
of a small group of French soldiers,
psychologically and artistically well
done.

Kelly easily eclipses Jean Pierre
! Aumont, whose acting ability plays
jan obvious second-fiddle to his
! French accent and good looks. The
entire production, though far from
outstanding in the unending stream
of stereotyped war films, is nonethe
less well-timed, well-written—and
(the readers won't believe this) well
! done.
Red Skelton just goes on being Red
Skelton in his latest attempt, '"Whis
tling in Brooklyn," a Twentieth Cen
tury Fox comedy about gangsters
and guns and girls. But there's no
denyin' that he verges on the hys
terical in several scenes—scenes that
thankfully retrieve his traditional
cornier moments. Ann Rutherford is
an added attraction. —Mac Vicar
