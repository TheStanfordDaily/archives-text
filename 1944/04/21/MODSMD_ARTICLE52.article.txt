# Dr. Buck Discusses Conditions in Britain
## 
### MARY AL SMITH 
Regarding recent developments in
the House of Commons Legislation,
Dr. Philip W. Buck of the political
science department has observed that
fof 1 the past lew months, Great Brit
ain has made more of a determined
approach than belore in tackling
domestic problems along with plant
for postwar reconstruction.
The two major domestic questions
under discussion were the Govern
ment's Liberal Education Bill and

! the Medical Insurance Plan, which is
S fashioned after the Lord Beveridge
Plan. It was this education bill
j which, after Mrs. Cabalet Keir had
proposed an amendment to grant
equal pay to women teachers,
prompted first an adverse vote and
than a vote of confidence. The tally
read: Confidence in the Govern
ment, 425. No Confidence, 23.
Effect on Foreign Situation
"These questions — however do
mestic— will influence the foreign
j situation through the far-reaching
British trade," continued Dr. Buck.
"Not only British but also all United
Nations are working! It is true that
evidences of this work have not as
yet filled the headlines, but they do
occasionally break through in press
dispatches.
"Here in the United States, the
coming presidential campaign has
both fortunate and unfortunate in
fluences on the answering of do
mestic and postwar questions. The
campaign will hold any action on
problems in suspense until after No
vember.
Campaign Stimulates Discussion
"But, on the other hand." con

eluded Dr. Buck, '"the very preseni-j
jof party campaigns will stimulate
! public discussions of social and for
, eign policies of the United States
No single member will escape dis
cussing domestic problems which
j have international implications."
A conversation with Dr. Buck
i leads to these conclusions which
j merit personal reflection:
It is time that we recognized the
J fact that the purpose and actions oi
| the British are like our own. The
| main difference is that the United
I States is more independent than the
j Island Kingdom which must make
! lasting trade contacts with the rest
I of the world in order to prosper.
Woolton Takes Lead
Great Britain, in designating the
| able Lord Woo!ton, former ration
ing minister, reconstruction minister
and in promot'ng action on domestic
affairs to coincide with postwar
plans, has taken the lead in postwar
| planning.
Following the British lead, our do-
I mestic problems need our discussion
j at the same time as our speedy vic-
I tory warrants our efforts.

Campaign Stimulates Discussion
"But, on the other hand." con

eluded Dr. Buck, '"the very preseni-j
jof party campaigns will stimulate
! public discussions of social and for
, eign policies of the United States
No single member will escape dis
cussing domestic problems which
j have international implications."
A conversation with Dr. Buck
i leads to these conclusions which
j merit personal reflection:
It is time that we recognized the
J fact that the purpose and actions oi
| the British are like our own. The
| main difference is that the United
I States is more independent than the
j Island Kingdom which must make
! lasting trade contacts with the rest
I of the world in order to prosper.
Woolton Takes Lead
Great Britain, in designating the
| able Lord Woo!ton, former ration
ing minister, reconstruction minister
and in promot'ng action on domestic
affairs to coincide with postwar
plans, has taken the lead in postwar
| planning.
Following the British lead, our do-
I mestic problems need our discussion
j at the same time as our speedy vic-
I tory warrants our efforts.


PHILIP VV. BUCK, piofessor of
political science.
Regarding recent developments in
the House of Commons Legislation,
Dr. Philip W. Buck of the political
science department has observed that
fof 1 the past lew months, Great Brit
ain has made more of a determined
approach than belore in tackling
domestic problems along with plant
for postwar reconstruction.
The two major domestic questions
under discussion were the Govern
ment's Liberal Education Bill and

! the Medical Insurance Plan, which is
S fashioned after the Lord Beveridge
Plan. It was this education bill
j which, after Mrs. Cabalet Keir had
proposed an amendment to grant
equal pay to women teachers,
prompted first an adverse vote and
than a vote of confidence. The tally
read: Confidence in the Govern
ment, 425. No Confidence, 23.
Effect on Foreign Situation
"These questions — however do
mestic— will influence the foreign
j situation through the far-reaching
British trade," continued Dr. Buck.
"Not only British but also all United
Nations are working! It is true that
evidences of this work have not as
yet filled the headlines, but they do
occasionally break through in press
dispatches.
"Here in the United States, the
coming presidential campaign has
both fortunate and unfortunate in
fluences on the answering of do
mestic and postwar questions. The
campaign will hold any action on
problems in suspense until after No
vember.
