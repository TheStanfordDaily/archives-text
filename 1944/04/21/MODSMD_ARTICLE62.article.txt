## 
### 
Dr. Ray Lyman Wilbur, chancellor
of Stanford University, emphasized a
point he has repeatedly stressed
when he told a Washington presse
conference the nation faces a danger
out shortage of scientists and tech
nicians in the critical postwar years
unless government manpower agen
cies agree on deferment from mili
tary service for certain students as
essential to the national welfare.
Dr. Wilbur, who is also chairman
of the War Department Advisory
Committee on army specialized
training, said the number of scien
tific students in American colleges
and universities is less than one
third the normal number.
