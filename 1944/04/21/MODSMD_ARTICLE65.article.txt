LONDON (UP) â€” The Anglo-
American governments appeared to
night to have scored a major politi
cal-economic victory as Turkey an
nounced that the export of chrome
to Germany and other axis countries
would cease as from tomorrow.
Turkey's action was the first con
crete result of Anglo-American
warnings to neutrals to stop aiding
the Axis. Chrome is an essential ele
ment in the manufacture of arma
ment steels.
