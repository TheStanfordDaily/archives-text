# Men Start Quarter's Stamp Drive
## 
### 
This quarter's War Stamp drive for
all men on campus begins today in
all men's residences. The goal for
each man is $3, announced Dick
Jobe, chairman. The drive will con
tinue through next Sunday, April
20, and men may buy their stamps
from the stamp representatives in
their residences.
The $3, which each man is asked to
my, is the equivalent of buying one
25-cent stamp each week in the
quarter. There is no limit, however,
to how many more stamps men can
purchase during the drive.
The goal for each men's residence
is 100 per cent contribution. Results
will be published each week of the
drive showing how all the men's
halls stand in the competition.
Representatives have been ap
pointed in all men's residences.
These representatives must phone in
their totals Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons, from 1 to 5, in the War
Board office, local 513.
"We hope that every man on cam
pus will buy at least $3 in War
Stamps this week," said Jobe, and
he added that during the rest of the
quarter men may always buy addi
tional stamps if they wish at the
Bond Booth.
