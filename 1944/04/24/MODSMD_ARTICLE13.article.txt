### BLARNEY GUGEL BULL HYER 
This week marks the 38th anniversary of the
Hammer and Coffin Society, national honorary
collegiate humor society, and publishers of the
Chaparral on the campus.
The society was born in "Old Meyer's" a pub
in Menlo, on April 17, 1906, with the idea of tak
ing over the Chaparral, which was then one of the
most prominent college humor magazines in the
country, a position which it has never lost.
The name, Hammer and Coffin, came from a
statement made that night by one of the founders
concerning the Daily Palo Alto, now known as
the Stanford Daily, which was apparently making
a nuisance of itself at that lime. Evidently ired
by the policy of the D.P.A., one of the Chappies
remarked, "We'll hammer 'em down, throw them
in a coffin and seal 'em away." The gathering
immediately took this up, and thus the society
got its name.
In that way also began the traditional Chappie-
Daily feud, v/hich has lasted down to the present
day.
The morning after the society was founded,
the campus was shaken to its very foundations.
As a matter of fact it was an earthquake. A few
skeptics have attributed the quake of '06 to nat
ural causes. This, of course, is absurd.
H and C went merrily on its way until the last
war, when due to the man shortage, several is
sues were edited from the front —from the
trenches in France.
During the 'twenties, Hammer and Coffin i
branched out into a national honorary humor
society, and chapters sprang up at the Universi
ties of California, Washington, Oregon, and Ore
gon State. In the East the society was repre
sented by the University of Chicago. A number
of years later three more chapters were added,
Northwestern, and the Universities of Arizona
and Georgia. Due to various causes and the war,
some of these chapters are not functioning at
present.
Under the wing of the Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, the ( haparral led an ivory tower existence. |
It was an ideal life for the Chappie, whose func
tion was to lampoon individuals and institutions
who took themselves too seriously. Many people
didn't like this and with the coming of the present j
war, the Chappie was left wide open for attack.
At the suggestion of an ex-student manager who
had left college two months earlier, the A.S.S.U.
engulfed the magazine.
The H and C still publishes the magazine, but
now under the auspices of the A.S.S.U. and still
maintains the powerful position it has had on
campus for the last 38 years.

immediately took this up, and thus the society
got its name.
In that way also began the traditional Chappie-
Daily feud, v/hich has lasted down to the present
day.
The morning after the society was founded,
the campus was shaken to its very foundations.
As a matter of fact it was an earthquake. A few
skeptics have attributed the quake of '06 to nat
ural causes. This, of course, is absurd.
H and C went merrily on its way until the last
war, when due to the man shortage, several is
sues were edited from the front —from the
trenches in France.
During the 'twenties, Hammer and Coffin i
branched out into a national honorary humor
society, and chapters sprang up at the Universi
ties of California, Washington, Oregon, and Ore
gon State. In the East the society was repre
sented by the University of Chicago. A number
of years later three more chapters were added,
Northwestern, and the Universities of Arizona
and Georgia. Due to various causes and the war,
some of these chapters are not functioning at
present.
Under the wing of the Hammer and Coffin So
ciety, the ( haparral led an ivory tower existence. |
It was an ideal life for the Chappie, whose func
tion was to lampoon individuals and institutions
who took themselves too seriously. Many people
didn't like this and with the coming of the present j
war, the Chappie was left wide open for attack.
At the suggestion of an ex-student manager who
had left college two months earlier, the A.S.S.U.
engulfed the magazine.
The H and C still publishes the magazine, but
now under the auspices of the A.S.S.U. and still
maintains the powerful position it has had on
campus for the last 38 years.
This week marks the 38th anniversary of the
Hammer and Coffin Society, national honorary
collegiate humor society, and publishers of the
Chaparral on the campus.
The society was born in "Old Meyer's" a pub
in Menlo, on April 17, 1906, with the idea of tak
ing over the Chaparral, which was then one of the
most prominent college humor magazines in the
country, a position which it has never lost.
The name, Hammer and Coffin, came from a
statement made that night by one of the founders
concerning the Daily Palo Alto, now known as
the Stanford Daily, which was apparently making
a nuisance of itself at that lime. Evidently ired
by the policy of the D.P.A., one of the Chappies
remarked, "We'll hammer 'em down, throw them
in a coffin and seal 'em away." The gathering
immediately took this up, and thus the society
got its name.
