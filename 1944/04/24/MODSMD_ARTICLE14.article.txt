The United States has progressed a long way
since the early days of Pearl Harbor. Saturday
night in Washington Rear Admiral Radford,
deputy chief of naval operations, announced that
at any time we so desire we can muster a thou
sand carrier-based planes for an operation
against the enemy.
Early Sunday, an admiral in charge of the
cruisers and destroyers in the central Pacific an
nounced that we now have many new and power
ful destroyers operating from the Aleutians to
Australia. To avoid jeopardizing military se
curity and also to give us an idea just how many
destroyers we have in constant operation, he put
it this way. He served on a destroyer in 1910
whose number was Six. He then said the most
recently assigned destroyer in the central Pa-'
cific was numbered 800. This doesn't mean, how-1
ever, that we have 800 destroyers in operation,
but it does give us a good idea.
This interview came from Pearl Harbor via
RCA to the Columbia Broadcasting System on
the mainland Sunday.
WALTZING INTO TRUK
With our naval task forces romping all over
the Pacific and waltzing into Truk to give it a
good shellacking whenever they so desire, it
becomes apparent that something big is up in
the Pacific. It wasn't too long ago that we
switched from the defensive to the offensive in
the Pacific. Soon, from the looks of recent oper
ations and apparent superiority in the Pacific,
we will be menacing the very shores of Japan. ;
Before that time however, the Philippines come 1
first.

RECENT BLOW ON PALAU
And in this connection, the recent blow on
Palau, only 400 miles from the Philippines, sug
gests forthcoming strategy in the Pacific of
fensive.

Mac Arthur-—if they don't draft him for the 1
presidency first—will strike from the south back
up through the Dutch East Indies. Simultane- j
ously—if he gets off the dime — Lord Louis 1
Mountbatten will strike through Burma. This will
then be the strong lower mandible of a huge
pincer movement. The upper mandible will be
an amphibious and aerial drive through the
Kuriles—neutralizing the huge Jap naval base at
Paramushiro. The Kuriles are only 800 miles from
Dai Nippon.
HUGE FRONTAL ASSAULT
Nimitz will then strike with a huge frontal
assault straight through the Pacific to the Philip
pines—liberating these islands and giving us
a base from which to operate. The three main !
forces will then be in position for the final as
sault on the Japanese homeland.
BRITISH MAY AID US
Churchill has said the British naval fleets will
aid us in the Pacific. That may be all well and
good, but from the looks of things in Europe, the
fleet will be well tied up there for some time to
come. By the time they reach the Pacific theater
of operations—well, most of the shooting will be
over and they will have arrived too late.
The United States is not anxious to postpone
things in the Pacific and everything seems to
indicate that Nimitz and Mac Arthur want to get
underway as soon as possible—and not have to
wait on the British fleet.
NOT WORRY ABOUT EUROPE
As of now, we have struck a few organized
blows, and we have struck many unorganized |
blows. Soon, the whole Pacific will shape up into
a centralized offensive with a common purpose,
driving steadily against the Jap. Frankly, we
don't believe the European situation will influ
ence the Pacific drive. When Nimitz, Mac Arthur,
and Halsey get ready to move in, they will do
just that and not worry about what's going on in
Europe.

NOT WORRY ABOUT EUROPE
As of now, we have struck a few organized
blows, and we have struck many unorganized |
blows. Soon, the whole Pacific will shape up into
a centralized offensive with a common purpose,
driving steadily against the Jap. Frankly, we
don't believe the European situation will influ
ence the Pacific drive. When Nimitz, Mac Arthur,
and Halsey get ready to move in, they will do
just that and not worry about what's going on in
Europe.
The United States has progressed a long way
since the early days of Pearl Harbor. Saturday
night in Washington Rear Admiral Radford,
deputy chief of naval operations, announced that
at any time we so desire we can muster a thou
sand carrier-based planes for an operation
against the enemy.
Early Sunday, an admiral in charge of the
cruisers and destroyers in the central Pacific an
nounced that we now have many new and power
ful destroyers operating from the Aleutians to
Australia. To avoid jeopardizing military se
curity and also to give us an idea just how many
destroyers we have in constant operation, he put
it this way. He served on a destroyer in 1910
whose number was Six. He then said the most
recently assigned destroyer in the central Pa-'
cific was numbered 800. This doesn't mean, how-1
ever, that we have 800 destroyers in operation,
but it does give us a good idea.
This interview came from Pearl Harbor via
RCA to the Columbia Broadcasting System on
the mainland Sunday.
WALTZING INTO TRUK
With our naval task forces romping all over
the Pacific and waltzing into Truk to give it a
good shellacking whenever they so desire, it
becomes apparent that something big is up in
the Pacific. It wasn't too long ago that we
switched from the defensive to the offensive in
the Pacific. Soon, from the looks of recent oper
ations and apparent superiority in the Pacific,
we will be menacing the very shores of Japan. ;
Before that time however, the Philippines come 1
first.

RECENT BLOW ON PALAU

Palau, only 400 miles from the Philippines, sug

Mac Arthur-—if they don't draft him for the 1
presidency first—will strike from the south back
up through the Dutch East Indies. Simultane- j
ously—if he gets off the dime — Lord Louis 1
Mountbatten will strike through Burma. This will
then be the strong lower mandible of a huge
pincer movement. The upper mandible will be
an amphibious and aerial drive through the
Kuriles—neutralizing the huge Jap naval base at
Paramushiro. The Kuriles are only 800 miles from
Dai Nippon.
HUGE FRONTAL ASSAULT
Nimitz will then strike with a huge frontal
assault straight through the Pacific to the Philip
pines—liberating these islands and giving us
a base from which to operate. The three main !
forces will then be in position for the final as
sault on the Japanese homeland.
BRITISH MAY AID US
Churchill has said the British naval fleets will
aid us in the Pacific. That may be all well and
good, but from the looks of things in Europe, the
fleet will be well tied up there for some time to
come. By the time they reach the Pacific theater
of operations—well, most of the shooting will be
over and they will have arrived too late.
The United States is not anxious to postpone
things in the Pacific and everything seems to
indicate that Nimitz and Mac Arthur want to get
underway as soon as possible—and not have to
wait on the British fleet.
