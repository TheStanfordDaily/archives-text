### 
Johnny Fulton's dream of a 1944
Stanford track team running official -
ly under the colors of the San Fran
cisco Olympic Club became a reality
Saturday, when Winged "O" officials
announced the formation of a squad
to be coached by the famous Dink
Templeton.
Unattached athletes from all over
the Bay Area, and especially Stan-
I'ordites Fulton, Emerson Hiler, Ed
uce, Jim Chamberlain, and Don
i_<andale, will make up the team
which will get its first test as a unit
against California and UCLA this
Saturday at Berkeley.
Templeton. developer of such for
mer Stanford greats as Ben Eastman
and Clyde Jeffrey while Farm track
mentor, has offered to coach the
team for the "duration," since the
school with which he is affiliated at
present — USF — has dropped inter
collegiate athletics.
Two members of the newly formed
Olympic Club squad, both from Stan
ford, pleased club officials Saturday
in the College of Pacific-California
meet by hanging up a pair of first
places as "guest" competitors. Luce
captured the high hump by clearing
six feet one inch, and then went on
to do six-two; Hiler got off a win
ning heave of 146 feet 6 inches in the
discus. Fulton was unable to com
pete in the meet because of a bad
leg, but will be ready this coming
Saturday.
The new squad will hold its first
time trials at the USF field Wednes

day afternoon. Expected to be on
hand along with the Stanford ath
letes are former Farm stars Johnny
Mottram and Bill Trout; Harry Rin
