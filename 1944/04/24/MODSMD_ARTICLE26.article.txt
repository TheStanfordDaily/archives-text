# 'Up In Arms' Worth Seeing
## 
### 
I "UP IN ARMS"—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
The craziest man on the screen, at
j at times the funniest—that's Danny
| Kaye, the star of the Goldwyn musi
! cal comedy, ''Up in Arms." Some-

times hilarious,
sometimes ridicu
lous, but always a
bundle of energy,
Danny Kaye is the
most impressive
new screan per
s on a 1 i t y of the
year.
Compared with
Kaye, the rest of
the cast is left far

behind. Constance Dowling, who
can't act or even look beautiful, is a
j sad disappointment, while as for
Dinah Shore—she's still a wonderful
1 vocalist, but she'd better stick to
| radio and records for obvious rea
-1 sons.
Despite its shortcomings, ''Up in
Arms" is well worth seeing. Photo
j graphed in technicolor, and with the
; Goldwyn girls making up for what
: the plot lacks, it's one of the better
j musicals of the year.
Especially good is the dream scene
j which shows Danny Kaye at one of
| his best moments in one of the best
fantasy scenes we've seen in a long,
[ long time.
George Saunders, in the second
feature, "Action in Arabia," turns in
his usual good performance
