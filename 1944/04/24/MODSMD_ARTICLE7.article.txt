Speaking on "The Man Christ
j Jesus,'" Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, Uni
: versity chaplain, said yesterday that
I the most hopeful thing about the
| world is that men see in Jesus Christ
! the hope of the world.
| Pointing out that many people ac- ;
cept God but do not feel justified in j
having a faith in Jesus, Dr. True- j
blood said that the one unique thing ;
the church had to offer the world j
was Jesus. Admitting that many of !
the ideas of Jesus were not original, j
the chaplain said, it was the way in ]
which Jesus expressed those ideas |
that has made them stick and come j
j to us today.
Dr. Trueblood said that the church j
was not the place for discussions of j
science or politics or literature, the j
journals and commentators could i
handle that; the church was the
place to come in touch with Jesus. If j
the church forgets about Christ and
turns to these other affairs only, it
is doomed, he said. And, he con
tinued, if this is to be a decent world,
i it will be because His life will be in
our life. We must go deeper than
just laws and teachings. This fact
God knew and. therefore, He made
a personal self-disclosure through
Jesus almost two milleniums ago.
For these reasons, Dr. Trueblood
I concluded, Jesus Christ is significant
for, and of importance to, us today,
; and He will continue to be in the ,
1 future.
