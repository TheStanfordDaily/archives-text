# Children of Paly Play House Need Care, Toys? Teaspoons
## 
### NANCY TILDEN 
There are some 20 to o0 children in
a Palo Alto nursery school ranging:
from the ages of 20 months to seven
years who are badly in need ol peo
ple to take care of them, toys to play
with, and even teaspoons to eat with.
These are the children of the Or
chard Play House, the nursery
school next to Castellaja. They are
the children of servicemen and war
workers whose mothers must also
work. And the director of the nurs
ery school is asking the help of Stan
ford students in taking care of them.
Energetic 5-Year-Old
The father of one energetic 5-year
old, helping to sweep off the front
porch, is with a camouflage unit in
North Africa. His mother works at
the Palo Alto Times. He says that
he sees her on Sundays and ''some
times she has Mondays off too."
The fathers of others of them have
been reported missing.
The Orchard Play House is spon
sored by two Palo Alto women
by two well-to-do Palo Alto women
who saw the need to provide a place
for service men and defense workers'
children, rented the building from
Castellaja and hired the director and
her staff — at present some four
women with small children whose
husbands are in the Pacific aJid who

Until a permanent organization
can be established, toys, teaspoons,
paper napkins, and towels tor the
Orchard Play House can be
brought to the Daily Shack.
Girls or living groups that wish
to help take care of the children
at the play house may sign up at
the War Board office in the Old
Union or may simply offer their
services at (he play house, which is
next door to Castellaja school on
Emerson street.

therefore wish to live on the Pacific
Coast.
Non-Profit Basis
It is run on a non-profit basis. The
rather low rates are 25 cents an hour,
$55 by the month.
But the Play House is trying to
take care of some 16 children at pres
ent—l 9 because of quarantine—most
of them 3, 3 U _\ and 4 years old
who stay there regularly and 5 to 10
who come in by the day or hour.
And the five women simply cannot
get around to do all that should be
done for them.
Girls, Toys, Teaspoons
These are the tilings which the di
rector of the play house says are
most urgently needed:

1. Girls to watch children, set the
| tables, help serve meals, and clean up
J afterward, in shifts ol two at a time,
J to stay for two hours, preferably
| from 1:30 to and .'s:.'>o to 5:30 in
! the afternoon.
2. Toys for (he small fry to play
with—beads, blocks, stuffed animals,
etc. The few animals they have now
are tired, dirty, sodden wrecks with
J overwork. They do not need crayons
and color books as the children are
too young to do much with them ex
; cept eat them.
3. Teaspoons, as they simply do
not have enough to go around and
i they cannot Ih* bought now. An old
, teaspoon or two when you come
1 home from the weekend would be
greatly appreciated.
4. Paper napkins and paper towels.
Counts as War Work
Work at the Orchard Play House
will count as war work, according to
Carol Hurwitz, chairman of War
| Board. And according to the di-
I rector of the play house "There is no
more important work you can be
! doing in war time than preparing
J the children of today to be men and
| women of the future for which our
! men are fighting."
The director, who would not allow
her name to be published, was a vet
eran of World War I. She outfitted
and drove an ambulance, was shelled
and permanently lamed.
"These Are (he Future"
She says "We must win the war,
yes, but after the war men will come
back disabled, disheartened. There
will be a long period of unsettled
conditions. These children here are
the people who will or will not carry
on in the l'tuure the principles for
which we are fighting according as
they are given care now."

are tired, dirty, sodden wrecks with

and color books as the children are
too young to do much with them ex
