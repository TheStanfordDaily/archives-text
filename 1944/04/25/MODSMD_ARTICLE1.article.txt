varrow, decoration chairman.
This fantastic "Spring Dream" will I

One part of the dream will be a
garden scene. In the garden will be j
enormous artificial flowers of various I
shapes, sizes, and colors.
Canaries with a 10-foot wing 1
spread will adorn the ceiling of blue
mist. A huge bird cage will occupy i
the center of the scene.
South American perfume will be
sprayed profusely to add to the gen- j
eral atmosphere of mysticism. Lights !
of red, violet, green, and especially j
blue will lend their touch of variety ;
to the dream.
Experiments are being made to (
find chemicals which will enable the !
couples to dance among deep billowy j
clouds. To date all the cloud forma- j
tions have been of a poisonous na- I
ture.
Work on decorations will begin to- i
day from 4 to 6 in the "Woodpecker's
Lodge" behind the Quad building.
All Lagunita and Roble girls on the
committee are urged to come.
The committee chairmen from I
Roble, Lagunita, and Union will
meet tonight after dinner in the
Women's Clubhouse.
