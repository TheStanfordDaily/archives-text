# Halls Select Show Title For Formal
## 
### 
"Lady in the Dark" is the theme of
the Lagunita, Roble, Union Formal
on May 6, according to Norma Tre-
varrow, decoration chairman.
This fantastic "Spring Dream" will
be portrayed in the Women's Gym.
One part of the dream will be a
garden scene. In the garden will be
enormous artificial flowers of various
shapes, sizes, and colors.
Canaries with a 10-foot wing
spread will adorn the ceiling of blue
mist. A huge bird cage will occupy
the center of the scene.
South American perfume will be
sprayed profusely to add to the gen-
eral atmosphere of mysticism. Lights
of red, violet, green, and especially
blue will lend their touch of variety
to the dream.
Experiments are being made to
find chemicals which will enable the
couples to dance among deep billowy
clouds. To date all the cloud forma-
tions have been of a poisonous na-
ture.
Work on decorations will begin to-
day from 4 to 6 in the "Woodpecker's
Lodge" behind the Quad building.
All Lagunita and Roble girls on the
committee are urged to come.
The committee chairmen from
Roble, Lagunita, and Union will
meet tonight after dinner in the
Women's Clubhouse.
