# LABOR'S LOVE LOST

LET ORGANIZED MANAGEMENT follow the
precedent set by organized labor in creating com
mittees for the solution of postwar domestic eco
nomic problems, and a real step toward a co
ordinated labor-management program in the
United States will have been made.
The CIO and the AFL have established post
war planning committees which are at present
drafting plans and making articulate the postwar
doctrines of these organizations.
Of course, the major question is the problem
of domestic unemployment, and Philip Murray,
president of the CIO, has stressed the necessity
of finding an adequate solution to this question;
that is, any government which permits large
scale unemployment endangers its own exist
ence.
Mr. Murray said that "the government must
develop in advance sound policies for ending
war orders in such a manner as to keep down
unemployment and waste."
The purpose in emphasizing to Stanford stu
dents labor's work in the field of postwar prob
lems is to aid in developing the tolerance of Uni
versity students who are supposed to be ppliti
cally sophisticated, if not politically mature, but
who are, at best, only disinterested,in such prob
lems.
The activity of labor is proof enough that
American unions, at least the CIO and AFL, de
spite strikes, John L. Lewis, and the notions en
gendered by demagogic orators on behalf of the
boys in the foxholes, should not be patronized.
