# Campus Opinion

DUE TO the few kind words dealt to the Daily in
yesterday's Bull Session, the organization finds
itself unexpected in the public limelight and per
haps a few words about it might impress incom
ing freshmen.
Namely, the Stanford Daily is an institution
for the care and feeding of a Farm. When Bmoc's,
officers, or departments are doing things in a
fog of triviality, the Daily is supposed to clear
away the mists and make them look like the
shining lights that they are.
When various people utter remarks in the
English language—the same words conveyed in
approximately the same order, when printed in
the Daily, are supposed to convey something
much more meaningful. If any campus organiza
tion is doing something that they should have
done some time ago, when the Daily prints their
activities, they should look epoch-making, at
least.
The Daily performs these duties in a little
palace called the shack, where there is a deadline
—at the printer's request—which few people in
cluding the staff can hardly realize—and where
some sewer pipes periodically leak, lending a
delightful atmosphere to the hustle and bustle.
The staff consists of a few people who risk
graduating because they are interested in getting
as much material as possible that people will
read four inches of; and then of course, many,
many other people are on the staff.
For all this, and its many benevolent activities,
the Daily subjects its columns, in the interests of
freedom of speech, to a certain spurious humor

organization so they may announce their effu
sions at the rare intervals when they publish.
You will see its staff running madly about
giving almost everyone else their due, and get
ting accused of the most awful things, for really
such simple activities; and asking in return —
j only this—buy Daily classifieds, won't ya?

An Obscure Member of the Staff.
