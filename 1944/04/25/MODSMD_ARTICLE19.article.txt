# Views on Your War

### Hayes Hunter 
There are many things that happen during '
wartime that must wait for postwar clarification.
Consider the Balkan situation. In some respects
it is self-explanatory.
Shortly after the Germans marched into the
Balkans we heard the name of a guerrilla leader
who was declared the living spark of the subju
gated peoples. His name is Draja Mikhailovich.
For a long time we hailed this Yugoslavian gen
eral as the answer to Hitler's Balkan drive. Mik
hailovich was to keep the Balkans in a state of
foment while the Allies prepared to land troops
on the continent and drive the German enemy
back to Berlin.
Mikhailovich—keeping faith with himself, his
people and the Allies—constantly harassed the
the German army of occupation.
KEPT GERMANS BUSY
His activity kept many S.S. and Reichwehr !
troops tied up in the Balkans. This weakened Hit-1
ler on other fronts which is just what the Allies j
wanted. In order to sustain his war on the Ger
mans, the Allies parachuted much lend-lease war
materiel in for Mikhailovich—which he used to ;
good advantage.
British army officers and observers slipped i
into the country to aid the general. There are ;
no confirmed reports of American army officers;
or observers joining the Yugoslavs, but doubt
lessly we were very interested in what Mikhail
ovich did and the tactics he used.
Doubtlessly we secured much of this informa
tion first hand.
WE DROP MIKHAILOVICH
All of a sudden we dropped Mikhailovich. No
fanfare—no reason or reasons given publicly—!
that is, reasons that could satisfactorily explain
our sudden lack of interest.
At first the slump in the news about the Bal- !
kans was thought due to a slump in the fighting, i
This was not the case.
MARSHAL TITO
A new name came into the headlines when
ever the Balkans were concerned, that of Marshal
Tito (Joseph Broz). Many wondered what had !
happened to Mikhailovich. Many thought he was
dead and Tito has assumed the general's position
as guerrilla leader for the Balkans.
This idea was scattered to the four winds when i
word came from the Balkans that fighting had
broken out between the partisan forces of Mik- j
hailovich and Tito. It was explained that Mik-!
hailovich was strongly anti-communist and Tito
communist.
REASON FOR CHANGE OF SUPPORT
It suddenly became apparent why we dropped j
Mikhailovich like a hot potato. The whole picture !
began to shape up. All this time the Red Army j
had been driving westward and south, headed
directly for the Balkans. In order not to displease
the Kremlin we had to shift our support to some-!
one who was communist and would join forces |
with the Red Army when it broke into the Bal-1
kans, thus forming a common front against the !
Nazis.
Just before the Cairo conference, British For-1
eign Secretary Anthony Eden officially made |
public our recognition of Tito and stated hence-'
forth we would make war materiel available to
Tito.
Because of the orignal boner pulled in recog- :
nizing and aiding Mikhailovich, the Americans
and the British politically occupy the position of a
tight-rope walker.
