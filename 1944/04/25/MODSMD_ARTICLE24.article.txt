# Ten Squads Flay Today in intramural Diamond Opener
## 
### ROGER CORMANT 
With five games slated for tonight and Thursday, mural softball gets
underway this week. Eleven teams have entered the circuit, with each
playing two games a week, Tuesday and Thursday nights at 7:15.
Going on the basis of their strong showings in other sports, the Med
School vs. McKinley Hall tilt should top tonight's sked. Although McKinley

has beaten the Meds in other sports, *
the draft has hit the civilians hard
since last quarter, which should tip
the scales in favor of the Medics.
Always a strong outfit, a better- j
'han-average Firehouse team runs
.p against the Monroe Boozers in
what will probably be the wildest of
tonight's affairs. The Boozers, Mon
roe's makeshift B team of last quar
ter, have consolidated with the A
team to make what may be one of j
the top teams of the league. We'll
call this one a toss-up, with Monroe i
slightly on the favored side.
The powerful Gerona A.C. nine |
meets a much improved Hayes Hall ,
squad in a game that could mark the
end of Hayes' athletic doldrums. '
Stringing along on past perform
ances, Gerona is the solid favorite, j
but Hayes could pull an upset.
Little is known of the other teams
but this is the way they shape up 1
according to quite a bit of guessing: |
Lincoln over Buchanan and Tyler to j
top the Legal Eagles, a new outfit !
making its first appearance. Garfield ;
has a bye.
