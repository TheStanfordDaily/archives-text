						Rough's Beard Is Slough; Camilla Phi's, 1-C Don't Mind

### 
In order to offset the fact that there are fewer men than women on cam
pus, Cardinals made their dance Saturday night girl-ask-boy. In order to
appeal to those women who aren't interested in the opposite sex, Cardinals
have proposed that the sorority or living group having the highest per
centage of dates at the dance will receive a gift well worth campus recog-

nition. At press time, the Gamma *
Phi's and Roble 1-C's are ahead in
the ticket sales.
As a sideline attraction. Cardinals
felt that some contest for the men J
might make them feel more in the i
general plan of things, and decided j
to make use of a biological power
peculiar to them—the power to grow
a beard. To the man who produces
the biggest result at the end of the j
week, a worthy gift will be presented !
Saturday morning. It has been re- ;
quested that the men remove their j
beards prior to arrival at the Sadie j
Hawkins dance.
Stanford women will have the op- !
portunity to ask the man of their j
choice and enter his hall to pick him |
up and take him to the dance. With i
all this, and Matthew Mateo's or- j
chestra to dance to, Stanford women
can't help but pigtail their hair and
put on jeans for the dance, according
to J. D. Williams, in charge of pub- :
licity. His final words are: '"Don't
forget Sadie's warning. There will |
be . 115 women seeking the same 1
boy, so you'd better get moving, j
Stanford women, and ask your date ;
before it's too late."
