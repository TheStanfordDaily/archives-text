# Chapel Union Meets Tonight
## 
### 
The quarterly meeting of the
Chapel Union will be held in the
vestry of the Memorial Church at
9 p.m. tonight.
The Chapel Union is a representa
tive body of all the living groups
which meets once each quarter for
the purposes of acquainting the stu
dent body with the scheduled relig
ious activities for that quarter and
making decisions on certain major
campus religious problems.
All living groups have been noti
fied of this meeting, and it is hoped
that there will be full representation
of these groups.
Aside from the routine business of
getting usher signups and nomina
tions for scripture readers, there will
be an important discussion on the
proposed Student Service. It has been
recommended by several students
and faculty members that, toward the
end of this quarter, a service be con
ducted entirely by students. This
would include student presentation
of the sermon.
Another item of importance is the
suggested Cal-Stanford Religious
Conference. It has been found that
many of the people in the Cal Bible
League would like to have a get
together of some kind on or about
May 14. Such a meeting would be of
great value and a lot of fun. The
Chapel Union will decide about this
conference. This evening's meeting
will be, as usual, an open one; and
all who are interested, whether dele
gates or not, are invited to attend.
