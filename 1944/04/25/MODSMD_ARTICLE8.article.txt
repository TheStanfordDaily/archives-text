# Moliere Comedy Planned for June
## 
### 
Moliere's famous comedy, "The
School for Husband," has been
chosen as the Stanford Players' an
nual musical and will be presented
in the Memorial Auditorium on June
8, 9, and 10, announced F. Cowles
Strickland, director.
The musical comedy was written
by Moliere in 1661 entirely in rhyme
and the Americanized version which
the Stanford Players are presenting
has kept the original vivaciousness
by keeping the majority of the lines
in couplet form. This version was
translated and adapted by Arthur
Guiterman and Lawrence Langner
for the New York Theater Guild and
presented by it a few years ago.
The Stanford production will be
given in conjunction with the Opera
Workshop, under the direction of Dr.
Jan Popper, and with the assistance
of Orchesis.
The entire play takes place in a
square in Paris about the year 1661.
Costumes will be of the early Louis
XIV period, with the exception of
the dancers in the dream interlude
who will be dressed as Egyptians.
Season ticket reservations may be
made now by calling P.A. 2-2041.
