# BUCHANAN FORUM
## Fisher Will Speak At Second Meeting 
### 
Professor Harold Fisher of the his
tory department will have dinner
with the men of Buchanan Hall this
evening, as the second guest of their
newly inaugurated Wednesday Night
Forum.
Gathered around the fireside after
dinner, Buchanan and McKinley
men will listen to Dr. Fisher tell of
Russia, something of its life and the
spread of communism there.
Authority on Russia
According to J. D. Williams, the
president of Buchanan Hall, the visit
of Dr. Fisher is being looked forward
to with great expectancy. He is con
sidered one of the greatest authori
ties on Russia, and they hope to learn
something of the reasons back of the
phenomenal and unexpected Russian
successes.
The forum is a friendly fireside
chat in Buchanan's comfortable liv
ing room, rather than an organized
discussion around a big table. The
assembled group asks questions that
it wants cleared up, and the speaker
answers to the best of his ability.
Tresidder First Guest
The forums began last week with
the informal visit of Dr. Tresidder.
He spoke of the place he knew and
liked best, first illustrating his points
with amusing anecdotes, and later
speaking more seriously. He gave

i the men of Buchanan a new picture
i of the University and its president.
| thus beginning the forums and set
j ting a standard for his successors,
r The forum has been inaugurated
j as a regular Wednesday night event
at Buchanan, the first organized one
- of its kind on the campus. Each week
j a prominent faculty guest will speak
on his own particular field, always in
I the same informal atmosphere.


DR. TRESIDDER keynoted the first Buchanan forum last Wednesday night when he spoke informally with
students at Buchanan and guests from McKinley Hall.
