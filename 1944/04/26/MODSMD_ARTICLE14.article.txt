# BALLOT BY BULLET

### 
NEWS COMMENTATORS, editorialists, Colonel
McCormick, and Mr. Hearst all express them
selves about the political situation in 1944 but
Warren Beebe, Stanford '42, writes from the
South Pacific with his own interpretation:
"About the political situation. Reading the
news in TIME, I find that the home front is in poor
shape. People all desiring to do a job bicker
over who shall get the credit, over conflicting
authority, or over personalities to such an extent
that the importance of the job is lost in small
troubles and so the job is never done. An ex
ample is the OWI or Congress. On reading
these travesties one begins to wonder "just what
in hell am I doing out here." This is because
we know that the fault all comes from the people
themselves. It isn't the leaders anywhere in any
country that have control. It is the people. The
leaders are merely an expression of the people's
will. There are some who think that Roosevelt
has no corner on winning the war, but who else
is there of his stature in the Democratic Party?
Who in the Republican, aside from Stassen?
"Then there is the issue of the service man
voting. That is ridculous! I tried it twice and
found the necessary red tape was too much for
the available time in which I had to vote . . . .
In short, the political situation does not interest
me a great deal, except that things must be
sguared away. Who does it or how I don't care,
but our lives depend upon how much good ma
terial the U.S.A. can produce. If it is not sguared
away the results will be fearful! because men
will come back tougher and harder than any
thing you have ever seen. They will think the
world owes them a living and will be prepared
to fight as they have been professionally trained
for it. The last Veteran's entrance into .politics
was nothing like this one will be, for I believe
that if the people at home can't run the country
that there are others overseas now who can—•
and will."
It is difficult to answer Warren, and it is diffi
cult to analyze the growing tension between
civilians and armed soldiers. It is true that these
men are fighting and dying to protect and to
preserve these civilians, and that these civilians
are in debt to the men and their effort. But a
minority dictatorship—a Veteran's bloc—would
be just as unfair, just as dangerous to the wel
fare of the United States as the politicians who
now prevent things from being "squared away."

and will."
It is difficult to answer Warren, and it is diffi
cult to analyze the growing tension between
civilians and armed soldiers. It is true that these
men are fighting and dying to protect and to
preserve these civilians, and that these civilians
are in debt to the men and their effort. But a
minority dictatorship—a Veteran's bloc—would
be just as unfair, just as dangerous to the wel
fare of the United States as the politicians who
now prevent things from being "squared away."

NEWS COMMENTATORS, editorialists, Colonel
McCormick, and Mr. Hearst all express them
selves about the political situation in 1944 but
Warren Beebe, Stanford '42, writes from the
South Pacific with his own interpretation:
"About the political situation. Reading the
news in TIME, I find that the home front is in poor
shape. People all desiring to do a job bicker
over who shall get the credit, over conflicting
authority, or over personalities to such an extent
that the importance of the job is lost in small
troubles and so the job is never done. An ex
ample is the OWI or Congress. On reading
these travesties one begins to wonder "just what
in hell am I doing out here." This is because
we know that the fault all comes from the people
themselves. It isn't the leaders anywhere in any
country that have control. It is the people. The
leaders are merely an expression of the people's
will. There are some who think that Roosevelt
has no corner on winning the war, but who else
is there of his stature in the Democratic Party?
Who in the Republican, aside from Stassen?
"Then there is the issue of the service man
voting. That is ridculous! I tried it twice and
found the necessary red tape was too much for
the available time in which I had to vote . . . .
In short, the political situation does not interest
me a great deal, except that things must be
sguared away. Who does it or how I don't care,
but our lives depend upon how much good ma
terial the U.S.A. can produce. If it is not sguared
away the results will be fearful! because men
will come back tougher and harder than any
thing you have ever seen. They will think the
world owes them a living and will be prepared
to fight as they have been professionally trained
for it. The last Veteran's entrance into .politics
was nothing like this one will be, for I believe
that if the people at home can't run the country
that there are others overseas now who can—•
and will."
