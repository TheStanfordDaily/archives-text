# NOT A ROMANTIC TASK
## 
### 
ON MONDAY the Daily carried a story about
the Orchard Play House in Palo Alto, a nursery '
school run for the children of servicemen and ;
defense workers whose wives must work. In j
the story was included an appeal for help in j
taking care of these children.
Of course there are a great many different
things we are asked to do as war work—band-1
age rolling, salvage collecting, nurse's aide—!
the list goes on forever. And it is hard to tell
just which ones are most important, which ones
on which to spend our limited time.
But here is something definite, concrete, some
thing you can see the value of doing immedi
ately before you. Not that you should drop
bandage rolling and salvage collections, etc., to
go rushing down to the romantic task of taking
care of "cute little kids."
Because it is not a romantic task and because '
they are not all cute little kids. It's a job that !
requires patience and ability to overlook dirty !
faces and runny noses. Children in the concrete
are seldom the cute, sweet little things of imag- j
ination and much more often little pieces of j
endless energy with a mind of their own.
But they do need care and they are often
pathetically eager for someone or something to
play with.
But the director of the play house doesn't
want great numbers of girls wandering in aim- j
lessly to "play with" the children. She wants ;
girls who will come in shifts of only two at a '
time to take orders and do those things most
urgently needed, be it playing with the kids or
washing their dishes.
And if each living group —casa or house or
corridor—could sign up to be responsible for j
one day every three or four weeks it would be j
no great job to find four girls each day, two for ,
each two-hour shift, who would be willing to do ;
this kind of war work.
For it would seem clear to any thinking person
that, as the director said in her appeal, these
children are indeed the future for which we are
fighting, a future we can spoil by neglect, a
future we can make with care and time given
now.—Nancy Tilden
