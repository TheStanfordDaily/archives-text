NAN TILLSON
It was Monday night and four little girls sat
weeping over the bridge table .... there was
nothing else to do. It was Wednesday night and
10 other little girls sat in the Cellar weeping into
their cokes .... there was nothing else to do.
It was Saturday night and 50 little girls sat in
the balcony of the Stanford Theater, weeping
into their hankies . . . there wasn't anything else
to do. Things just aren't the same, and night
after night looking at the same 52 cards or the
same three or nine other femmes leads to dread
ful boredom. There is a solution for this prob
lem, though, at least for the next four weeks. So
if you're tired of the bridge table, cokes, movies,
friends, or just life in general why not hie your
self over to Memorial Hall and try out for
SPRING SHOW. After all you can dance can't
you? You can't? Well then, you know how to
sing don't you? You don't? Then you certainly
are able to stand on the stage and look cute,
aren't you? You aren't? Even that doesn't mat
ter, cause part of it's in black face. But if you
don't think you can do any of these things, you
can sew or hammer or paint or push things.
You see, there are no end of things to be done
and you're just the one to do them. So why not
look hard into your hidden talents, or answer
that lifelong yearning to act and help out. It's
just as much fun as sitting back being part of
the audience, and there's a definite satisfaction
in being able to say that "I hammered that nail"
or I was the one who tripped lean Levinson as
she went on in the second act." There is a feel
ing of accomplishment in doing any of these, so
get on the show-boat and stop crying in vour
cokes and—HAVE A LOT OF FUN!
