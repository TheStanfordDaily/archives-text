# Monroe and Firehouse Tie
## 
### 
In one of the most amazing pitchers' battles ever staked on the local
diamond, the powerful Firehouse squad and the battling Monroe Boozers
were tied at 0 to 0 at the end of seven innings ol hitless, scoreless baseball
in the intramural diamond inaugural yesterday. Predicted as one of the
wildest of yesterday's encounters, this game saw but two balls hit beyond

the infield; one by each team, and<
not a single error. Joe Sher pitched
for the Boozers, and issued but three
walks, while striking out 1(>. His op
ponent, Luke Pitts, who pitched for
the Firehouse, also struck out IG,
giving only one free pass. Both teams
made a much better showing than
was expected of them, especially
Monroe, which had not previously
worked out, and were considered
definite underdogs.
McKinley One-Sided
The McKinley-Med fray, featured
as the game of the day, proved to be
a somewhat one-sided affair, with the
Meds triumphing. -1 to 1, as they ex
ploded for three runs off one hit in
the first inning. The pitching for
both, sides was fairly good, errors
counting for most of the tallies. Mc-
Kinley 's lone tally came in the third
inning.
In the other games of the day, Ty
ler beat the unknown Legal Eagles
by a score of 11 to G, in a game which
at first appeared tight, but com
pletely exploded in the last two in
nings. Lincoln shut out Buchanan
by a score of 4 to 0. pitcher Lnrabie
allowing only two weak hits. Inex
perience was the main fault of the
Buchanan boys, as errors were nu- j
merous. Most of the outs were
strikeouts, as very few balls were
actually hit. Gerona defaulted to
Hayes.
