# SADIE HAWKINS
## Biggest, Bushiest Beard To Win Razor 
### JEAN HANSSEN 
The beard-growing contest, a sideline to the Sadie Hawkins Dance, is now
in full swing, according to Dick Bartle, chairman of the dance. The prizes
include a razor to the winner, and free barber-shop shaves to the runners
up.
The rules for the contest, as formulated by the chairman, are:

1. This contest is open to men only.
2. The contest closes at 5 p.m. Sat
urday, April 29.
3. Judging will he held at that time
in front ot the Cellar.
4. Contestants will be judged on
area of beard, average length, and
general appearance.
5. Only actual, personally grown
beards will be eligible.
6. The decision of the judges will
be final.
7. No box tops are required of en
trants.
The judges for the dance will be
announced in tomorrow's Daily.
Cardinals are considering the quali
fications of several outstanding fac
ulty members and prominent people
on campus to fulfill the position as
judges. It was deemed wiser not to
invite the Palo Alto Draft Board to
participate.
In the race for snagging the men
for the dance, the Delta Gammas are
ahead with the Gamma Phi's close
behind. Roble 3-C is trailing. There
are still lots of men on campus who
are available for the dance, but in
order to retain their lead the Delta
Gammas are getting desperate, so
any competition had better come for
ward quickly or the D.G.'s will walk
off with the prize, still of undisclosed
nature.

The Women's Gym will be trans
formed into a veritable Dogpatch, or
j a reasonable facsimile thereof, and
the refreshments for the dance are
:to be cider and doughnuts, which
will be served from an authentic
replica of a mountain still by Bob
i Newcomb
Barbara Upshaw, well-known au
thority on Kentucky architecture and
! atmosphere, is in charge of the dec
! orations for the dance, which, she
says, will be in keeping with the gen
eral theme. Marcia Long.-co-chair
j man in charge of refreshments, is
! conjuring up some good ideas for the
liquid half of the piece de resistance.
