# Railroad Appeals For New Workers
## 
### 
Facing new manpower losses to
the armed forces, an urgent appeal
for thousands of additional workers
i to help the rialroads keep the victory
trains rolling, and to avoid delays in
busy rail yards and shops, was made
| today by L. B. McDonald, vice-presi
j dent in charge of operations for
j Southern Pacific.
New draft rules, calling up all able
; bodied men under 20. threaten to
; cancel the deferments of hundreds of
Southern Pacific workmen in skilled
[ crafts, McDonald said, including fire
| men, brakemen, boilermakers, ma
chinists, blacksmiths, carmen, signal
men, and members of other impor
tant crafts.
Any further depletion of railroad
1 personnel necessitates immediate re
placements by patriotic response of
workers not now engaged in essen
tial war activity, if the rail lines are
to handle without delay the heavy
volume of war traffic and keep roll
ing stock in repair, McDonald added.
Southern Pacific, as a whole, now
j has nearly 15,00 former employes in
; the armed services and the railroad's
I worker shortage now stands at 8,600.
Thousands of jobs for skilled and un
skilled men and women are open on
i the Pacific Coast railroad front.
