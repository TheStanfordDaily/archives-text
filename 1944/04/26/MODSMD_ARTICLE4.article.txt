Final tryouts for the '44 Ram's
j Head Spring Show will be held to
i night in the Memorial Auditorium
1 from 7:30 to 10. All those interested
i in appearing in specialty acts, skits,
! dances, the chorus, or in singing are
| urged to come, said Nan Tillson,
j director. Anyone who could play an
1 instrument in the orchestra or
j who was in the Gaieties orchestra is
j asked either to come tonight or to
j contact Miss Tillson.
Students are also needed for the
| various crews of the show. No ex
j perience is necessary. Anyone who
j would like to help with painting, de
! signing, sewing, or with props should
, contact Corinne Wollman at P.A.
| 8608.
Margaret Morgan, at P A. 22151, is
j in charge of costumes, and Suzanne
i Seabrook, at the same number, is
! heading the makeup crew. Students
; interested in working on these crews
j should contact these girls.
Tins year's Spring Show will be in
j the form of a review similar to the
; Gaieties. This allows for a larger
' oast and more opportunity for fun
than the musical comedies which
were formerly given as Spring
Shows, stated Miss Tillson.
The annual Spring Show is one of
Stanford's spring-quarter traditions,
and all students are welcome to try
out and to help with the crews of
1 this campus activity, concluded Miss
Tillson.
