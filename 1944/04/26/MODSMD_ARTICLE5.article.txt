# Med Students' Stamp Sale
## 
### 
War Stamps will be sold to the
Medical School students tomorrow
morning from 8 to 10, announced
Dick Jobe, chairman of the Men's
Stamp drive. A booth will be set up
in front of the bacteriology lecture
room.
Each medical student is asked to
buy the usual quota for all men on
campus of S3. Arrangements have
been made to sell stamps at the Med
School, according to Jobe, because it
is impossible to sell stamps during
this drive in all the residences of
med students.
A stamp drive for men is held at
the beginning of every quarter and
each man is asked to buy S3 in War
Stamps which is the equivalent of
buying one 25-cent stamp each week.
Stamp representatives have been
appointed in all men's living groups
and will sell stamps through next
Sunday, April 30.
