# COMPANY DEFIES PRESIDENT

CHICAGO (UP) â€” Montgomery Ward and Company defied President
Roosevelt's order to recognize the United Retail, Wholesale, and Depart
ment Store Employes Union tonight and said that any government effort to
take over operation of the huge retail mail order concern would be in com
plete disregard of the Constitution.
The President, in a back-to-work plea made Sunday, ordered the 5,003
strikers to return to their jobs by noon today, and the company to recognize
the union as the employes' bargaining agent until a National War Labor
Board election could be held.
Sewell Avery, president of the company, said "Ward's cannot under the
law grant special privileges to the union pending the election. Any seizure
of Ward's plant would be in complete disregard of the Constitution."
