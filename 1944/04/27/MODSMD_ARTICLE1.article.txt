## 
### 
* Speaking in the way thai has won
him student admiration, Dr. Donald
B. Tresidder, president of Stanford
University, told the women of the
University last night that he had
been authorized by the Board of
Trustees to announce that sororities
on this campus will be discontinued
and that women's housing will be
unified under University ownership
J and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was
packed, and women were sitting in
the aisles and on the stage steps
, when they rose to applaud the presi
dent as he left the stage. A moment
later, as the audience spontaneously
; broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
1 As the last notes ended, he said,

I "That was the nicest thing you could I
| have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision
| of the board until he had gone
I through the events which led up to
| the board's consideration of the so- |
rority problem.
He took the audience back to
I early 1943, when 13 Roble sponsors
sent the board a letter stating their
j dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
| tem at Stanford. The board chose a
j committee out of their number, con-
I sisting of Mr. George A. Ditz, Mr. J
- Leland W. Cutler, Mr. W. Palmer i
Fuller Jr., Mrs. Roger Goodan. Mr. 1
Ira S. Lillick, and Judge M. C. Sloss. j
This group met with 19 women I
I students representing both sides of
i the issue in March of that year and >

I this was followed by letters and
j more meetings with alumnae and
iriends of Stanford.
The Failure of Plans
"In September, I came as president,
! along with the Army," said Dr. Tres
idder, as he went on to tell of sub
sequent plans which had been con
sidered by Panhellenic but rejected
i by one or more houses.
He told of more meetings, confer
j ences with campus leaders, and final
| ly of the many fine things which so
j rorities have done for the University
In conclusion, he praised the coop
eration of row women in trying to
I find it solution and then announced
| the decision, which was received,
as he had asked, without demonstra
! tion of any kind.

* Speaking in the way thai has won
him student admiration, Dr. Donald
B. Tresidder, president of Stanford
University, told the women of the
University last night that he had
been authorized by the Board of
Trustees to announce that sororities
on this campus will be discontinued
and that women's housing will be
unified under University ownership
J and supervision.
The Education Auditorium was
packed, and women were sitting in
the aisles and on the stage steps
, when they rose to applaud the presi
dent as he left the stage. A moment
later, as the audience spontaneously
; broke into the Stanford Hymn, he
walked back on stage to join them.
1 As the last notes ended, he said,

I "That was the nicest thing you could I
| have done."
Decision Held
He did not announce the decision
| of the board until he had gone
I through the events which led up to
| the board's consideration of the so- |
rority problem.
He took the audience back to
I early 1943, when 13 Roble sponsors
sent the board a letter stating their
j dissatisfaction with the sorority sys
| tem at Stanford. The board chose a
j committee out of their number, con-
I sisting of Mr. George A. Ditz, Mr. J
