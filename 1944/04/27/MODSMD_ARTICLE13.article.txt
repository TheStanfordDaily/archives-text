women at the meeting last night.)
All University women heard last night Dr. Tresidder's pres
entation of the solution of a problem which they have known to
exist for many years on the Stanford campus.
The decision that sororities will be abolished was presented
to both sorority and non-sorority women. It was a problem that
seemed to have no solution, and Dr. Tresidder and the Board of
Trustees feel that abolition is the only way to bring unity and a
greater good will among Stanford women.
Dr. Tresidder has worked with campus women on both sides
of the problem, and I know that every woman in the University
is going to work with him now to make the decision of the board
a success.
It is a system that has never been tried on the Stanford cam
pus, and I am certain that with the support of Stanford women it
will not fail.
His task, that of presenting the decision, was the most difficult
of all, and I feel that sorority women appreciate that fact and will
support him in working out successfully the new system.
