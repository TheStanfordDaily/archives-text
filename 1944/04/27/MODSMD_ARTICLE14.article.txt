### BARNEY GUGEL 
About a week ago a friend oi ours was in the Cellar eating
breakfast and happened to overhear a conversation in the next
booth between a Stanford student and a soldier. The topic of on
versation was, of all things, the Stanford Daily, which the soldier
was tearing apart line by line.
"Now I ought to know good makeup when I see it after working
on a paper for 11 years. You won't find any metropolitan paper
using makeup lik'e that."
His companion muttered something about the Stanford campus
not being exactly what you would call a metropolitan center, but
he was broken off before he could finish the sentence.
"Why, it looks like nobody on the Daily ever corrected proof
before. Errors all over the place. When I was in the newspaper
business, if you made a few bungles like that you were out of a
job. I'd like to see those youngsters work on a big city paper. They
couldn't, they haven't got the experience."
The Stanford student remarked that not many people of college
age have had experience on a big newspaper and then asked his
friend if he didn't think that the Daily was a good way to get ex
erience. The soldier ignored the question and went on.
"A good paper runs stories that are interesting, you know,
sensational. Oh, I agree with you, not much sensational happens
on campus, but they could write up what -does happen that way.
When I was in the fiewsp — What paper did I work for? Why, the
Eagle Pass Gazette. You know, Eagle Pass. Texas."
