# Tyler To Meet The Firehouse
## 
### ROGER CORMAN 
Going into the second round of
play, Tyler Hall runs up against the
Firehouse in what shapes up as the
top game of the intramural softball
schedule for tonight. Neither team
has been beaten, Tyler running wild
over the Legal Eagles, and the
Firemen battling to a scoreless tie
vith Monroe in their first round con
tests. This game could go either way,
but the hurling of Tom Ashley
should tip the scales in favor of the
Firehouse.
The other top teams should have
an easy time of it. The Med School
will have little trouble in taking Bu
chanan by a comfortable score, while
Hayes should top McKinley in a fair
ly close contest.
Gerona won't have to extend itself
much to beat the Legal Eagles, while
Monroe should murder Garfield. Lin
coln has a bye.
