# Med Students Buy Stamps
## 
### 
Medical School students will have
a chance this morning to cooperate
in the Men's War Stamp drive, an
nounced Dick Jobe, chairman of the
drive. A booth will be set up in front
of the bacteriology lecture room and
War Stamps will be sold to Med
students from 8 to 10.
Each med student is asked to buy
$3 in War Stamps today. This is the
quota for every man on campus in
the drive which started last Monday
in all men's living groups.
Since it is impossible to contact all
the med students in their residences,
it is hoped that these men will co
operate in the drive by buying
stamps today.
Stamp representatives have been
appointed in all men's living groups
and will sell stamps through next
Sunday, April 30. The men's halls
are competing with each other with
each one trying to go 100 per cent in
the drive.
The $3 which each man is asked to
buy in War Stamps is the equivalent
of buying one 25-cent stamp every
week during the quarter.
