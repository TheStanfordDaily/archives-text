# Fisher Leads Buchanan Forum In Discussion of Russian Ideals
## 
### J.D. WILLIAMS 
With the spotlight of Buchanan's '
Forum focussed on Russia, the men
of the upper row hall conversed with I
Dr. Harold Fisher of the history de- j
partment last night. The informal !
gathering in the front room displayed j
a wide range of interests on Russia, j
extending from some of the philo- j
sophical bases of Marxism, the politi- j
cal structure of the U.S.S.R., and the J
early Russian reverses in Finland, [
to the historical background and in- |
ternational future of the Communist j
Party.
Russian peace aims are now ques- |
tions of considerable interest, and !
they seemed to tap a wealth of ma- !
terial in Dr. Fisher's experiences and
association with Russia. He felt that !
Russian peace • demands would be '
essentially composed of two types: i
Geographical and political. It seems
evident that Russia will demand the
territory which belonged to her be
fore the war, plus the Baltic states.
In addition, readiness and affinity <
for the Communist system arising in
the Balkan nations would not come
unexpectedly, for the social and po
litical structure of that area seems to
be well fitted for the type of or
ganization that Karl Marx laid

down and which Russia has exe
cuted.
The postwar political demands of
the U.S.S.R., according to Dr. Fisher,
will be centered around one par
ticular desire, and that is for "equal
status" of national governments. By
that Dr. Fisher meant that the Com
munist is anxious to have the right
to place party members in political
organizations where they are de
sired, without outside reproach.
