# Lydgate Tells How General Election Tides May Flow
## 
### PATTY PATTEN 
The servicemen have the potential
power to determine the outcome of
the 1944 presidential election; and
the servicemen favor the Democratic
party at. more than a 2:1 ratio. This
was the opinion of William A. Lyd
gate, editor of the Gallup Poll, who
spoke at this week's Tuesday Eve
ning Series. The G.I. vote will not
be large, however, predicted Mr.
Lydgate, because of the technical

difficulties of getting ballots to the
front; and if it is under two million,
it will not be sufficient to elect the
Democratic candidate.
The political tides are very even,
Mr. Lydgate said; the '44 election
will be one of the closest in recent
history. The Republicans are stronger
than they have been since the New
Deal began; and this resurgent
strength has come from the rural
counties in the central United States.
Of the 1.058 Middle-Western coun
ties, 132 were Republican in 1932; 900
are Republican today.
However the Republican party has
not gained in the metropolitan cen
ters of the nation, surveys show, and
one of the big problems of the G.O.P.
is to break the Democratic grip on
the cities.
The fourth term is neither the de
cisive nor the main issue of the '44
campaign, contrary to many person's
expectations. The three main issues
are: (1) Which man or party will do
the best job of bringing the war to
a speedy conclusion? (2) Which will
contract the most favorable peace
terms? (3) Which will be most suc
cessful in bringing postwar employ
ment to the nation?
