lowing suggestion from the com- j
mittee's report:
"That a system be adopted where
officeholders remain in office for a
period of three quarters, being elect
ed during the spring and serving ex
cluding summer quarter into the fol
lowing spring. This summer's officers
would be a carry-over from the pres
ent officeholders with appointments
to fill any vacancies. Should any i
officeholders fail to return during
the three-quarter period, vacancies
will be filled by appointments by the !
appropriate authorities. A second
minor election could be held winter
quarter to fill in vacancies and the
places of those people going out at
the end of winter quarter.
'"This system would give a
smoother transition in that there
would be more time to learn and to
make use of this learning. It would
also be less confusing in the overlap
ping of A and B ballots.''

fered Excom included the following
recommendations:
1. Limitation of petitions to one

New System Explained
Excom approved a new system last
night which is explained in the fol
lowing suggestion from the com- j
mittee's report:
"That a system be adopted where
officeholders remain in office for a
period of three quarters, being elect
ed during the spring and serving ex
cluding summer quarter into the fol
lowing spring. This summer's officers
would be a carry-over from the pres
ent officeholders with appointments
to fill any vacancies. Should any i
officeholders fail to return during
the three-quarter period, vacancies
will be filled by appointments by the !
appropriate authorities. A second
minor election could be held winter
quarter to fill in vacancies and the
places of those people going out at
the end of winter quarter.
'"This system would give a
smoother transition in that there
would be more time to learn and to
make use of this learning. It would
also be less confusing in the overlap
ping of A and B ballots.''
Changes Recommended
The plan which the committee of
fered Excom included the following
recommendations:
1. Limitation of petitions to one
day, Monday, May 8.
2. Assembly to be held on election

3. Additional candidate speeches at
