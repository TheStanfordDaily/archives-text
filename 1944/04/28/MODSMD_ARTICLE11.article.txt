# 'Injun, Spare That Beard!'
## 
### JEAN HANSSEN 
Stanford men will not be able to
shave their beards, but must wear
them to the Sadie Hawkins dance
Saturday night, according to Dick
Bartle, chairman of the dance. It has
been decided to have the judging of
the length of beards take place at the
I dance. The extra time will give the
J men a chance to cultivate a little
more of the fungus which may en-
I title them to the prize, a beautiful
! razor. To the runners-up will go free
. barber-shop shaves.
To the Stanford women who snag
j the greatest percentage of men for
the dance will go a jug of "Kikapoo
Joy Juice'' (for potentialities of
which, read Li'l Abner), which will
I be awarded at the dance.
D.G. Monopoly Mounts
Hie Delta Gammas are still hold
] ing their lead which they gained
early in the race for dates. It looks
as though they have a gdod chance of
I winning, uhless an unexpected last
| minute push pulls some other group
I into top position. Tickets will be on
sale from 9 to 5 today in the A.S.S.U.
office, until 11 on Saturday morning,
and at 8:30 Saturday night at the
1 door to the Women's Gym. Tickets
bought at the door will only count
| as one-half the number toward the
i prize.
Cider and doughnuts are to be the
i refreshments for the evening, accord
[ ing to Bob Newcomb, co-chairman
j in charge of refreshments. A differ
j ent sort of stand is being built, re
| sembling a typical hill-billy estab-
I lishment.
