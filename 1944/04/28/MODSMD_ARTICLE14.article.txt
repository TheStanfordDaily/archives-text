# Views on Your War

### Hayes Hunter 
This point in the progress of the war —the
present phase we are going through now —is
dc.ngerous for it is during this particular time
that the apparent victors are forming their poli
cies concerning the countries they soon will
occupy.
The Russians stand on this threshold at the
present moment.
An authoritative Soviet war review said re
cently that the Reds plan to drive into Germany
in continuation of the mighty 1944 offensive.
Their purpose, according to the war review, is
to finish off Adolf Hitler's remaining legions
and bring about the Nazis' final collapse, "in
close collaboration with the Allies."
The next guestion is—"What will they do
with Germany-" That question has not been
answered.
That is beside the point. Our policy toward
Russia—such as it is—is determined by the
State Department.
The Russo-German war, founded on deceit,
has turned into holy purpose for the Russians.
The Reds knew as far back as 1937 that some
day they would have to fight their arming
neighbor. Then came the Moscow Pact—sign
ing both the Russians and the Germans as
"good neighbors." We know of this scrap of
paper now as just a means to throw Russians
off the track and give the Nazis a chance to try
and knock out Russia. The little corporal's at
tempt was unsuccessful. Now the Russians are
driving toward Germany with but one purpose
in mind—"stamp out National Socialism and
the deceit it stands for."
So far —the Russians have done well.
The war review, referred to earlier, authori
tatively states:
"Five hundred thousand Axis troops have
been captured or slain and enormous booty
swept up in less than two months on the lower
Russian front, without counting the Crimea.
Since last summer the Red Army has liberated
more than 85,000 localities and more than 310,-
OCO square miles of territory."
This is only one of the many pressures soon
to be squeezing the Festung Europa from all
sides and above.
