The Editor:
On Tuesday Hayes Hunter made some very
peculiar statements regarding the Balkan situ
ation. In all fairness the following information
should be printed: 1. Since July 1941 Tito and
the Partisans have provided more opposition
to the Germans than Mikhailovich and his men.
By January 1941 Mikhailovich had only 10,000
men while Tito had 250,000 men. Mikhailovich
has never had more than 75,000 men. 2. Tito
and the Partisans are keeping more German
divisions busy than the Allies are in Italy. 3.
Even some West Coast newspapers, e.g. the
San Francisco Chronicle, gave the reasons why
"all of a sudden we dropped Mikhailovich."
The British newspapers covered the situation
much more thoroughly and gave the reports of
the British military commission showing that
the Partisans were providing all of the effec
tive resistance against the Germans..
The following chronology of the Balkan situ
ation is offered to help clear the situation:
April 1941, Yugoslavia surrenders. For five
weeks Mikhailovich opposes Germans and is
finally driven under cover. July 5, 1941, Par
tisans attack in Valjero, Belgrade, Zagreb, and
Slovenia. July 13, 1941, Partisans capture all
but three main towns from Italians in province
of Montenegro. August 1941, Germans offer
100,000 gold marks for Tito, dead or alive. No
vember 1941, for the first time Mikailovich at
tacks the Partisans and even his own son deserts
and joins Tito. From this day on Mikhailovich
never seriously fought the Germans. Decem
ber 1942, one-half of Yugoslavia is in Partisans'
hands. September 1943, two-thirds of Yugo
slavia is in Partisans' hands. May 1943, Parti
sans beat back attack of seven German and five
Italian divisions with Mikhailovich giving full
support to the Germans.
