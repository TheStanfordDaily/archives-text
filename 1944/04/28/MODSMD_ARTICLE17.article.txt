# Internationalists To Meet Sunday
## 
### 
The International Club, whose
main purpose is to create better un
derstanding between American and
foreign students at Stanford, is, ac- !
cording to President Servet A. Du
ran, open to all students regardless of ,
whether they are foreign or Ameri- I
can born.
Meetings are held in the home of
Mrs. Edwin Thomas, at 365 Lincoln j
avenue, Palo Alto. Sunday night's J
meeting, at 7:30, will be the second j
of the quarter, and all students are
urged to attend.
The World Peace will undoubtedly
be based on large-scale cooperation
and the so - called ' international
mind" will protect the very founda- â– 
tions of the world peace, said Dui'an.
The aims, therefore, of the Interna- i
tional Club are to contribute to this j
cause in a modest way.
In the meetings held under the
auspices of this club, foreign students
will have the opportunity to meet 5
each other, and American students ;
will be able to familiarize themselves
with the customs and ways of living j
in other lands. In turn the foreign
students will come in closer contact 1
with their American friends and ;
learn more about the American way
of living. All this will be accom
plished in an atmosphere of complete
and friendly informality.
