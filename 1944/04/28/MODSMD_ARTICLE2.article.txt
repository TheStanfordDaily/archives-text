# U.S. ASKS INJUNCTION AGAINST WARD'S
## 
### 
CHICAGO (UP) — The government sought an injunction tonight to
strengthen its control over Montgomery Ward and Co.'s Chicago properties
after emphasizing its determination to manage the mail order concern by
using the army troops forcibly to remove Sewell Avery, chairman of the
board.
Atty. Gen. Francis Biddle filed a petition for the injunction on behalf of
Under Secty. of Commerce Wayne C. Taylor, the government-appointed
operating manager of the plant. The Department of Commerce came into
control of the company's Chicago facilities at noon yesterday when Taylor
took over by presidential order.
The petition, which names 15 other company officers in addition to the
chairman, asks that these men be prevented from obstructing or interfering
with the government's operation. It also charges Avery with refusing to
"recognize that possession has been taken by the government," and said he
had "directed certain officers and employees not to recognize and obey"
Taylor's orders. — — — — — — —
WASHINGTON (UP) —A group of Illinois Republican congressmen con
tended tonight that President Roosevelt had no lawful or constitutional
power to order seizure of the Montgomery Ward and Co. Chicago prop
erties and protested that such "arbitrary use of power" is a threat to the
peaceful continuation of all private business.
They endorsed a resolution introduced in theHouse several hours earlier
by one of their colleagues—Representative Charles Dewey (Rep., 111.), call
ing for immediate congressional investigation of the seizure. The resolution
was referred to the House Rules Committee whose chairman, Representa
tive Adolph J. Sabath (Dem., 111.), called it "political" and predicted it would
be sidetracked.
