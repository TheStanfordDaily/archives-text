### MELLON SHELTON 
Reflecting what seems to be the
general opinion and hopes of the
American people, Robert M. P. Grin
nell, instructor in history, yesterday
stated in an interview with the
Daily that the postwar world will
most likely be dominated by the two
great powers of the United States in
the Western Hemisphere and Russia
in eastern, with England acting as a
balance in thought and influence be
tween the two nations. His state
ment was corroborated by Jere C.
King, also instructor in history.
Russian Influence
The opinions of the two men as to
the status of the other European
countries in the world after the war
were mainly alike, as they both
thought that the small nations of
eastern Europe would be actively
under the Russian "sphere of in
fluence." By this they meant that
although the Balkans, the Baltic
states, and Poland would be nomi
nally independent, their economic,
social, and political systems would
be oriented toward Russia.
Mr. King compared the "sovietiz
ing" of these states with the present
status of Outer Mongolia, which,
though nominally independent, leans
on the U.S.S.R. for economic and
partial political support.
French Disunity
Asked about the role of France in
the new Europe, Mr. Grinnell stated
that political differences certainly ex
ist within that country now, but
that "the Third Republic only masked
an ... . (identical) .... conflict in
France before the war." He added
that "the Petain element is in a
sense anti-democratic"; but said that
conditions were so obscure as to
make any prediction on his part
nothing more than a wild guess. He
said he thought that the U.S. State
Department might recognize Petain
when France is reconquered as an
effort on the part of the United Na
tions to bring about a peaceful and

amicable evolution of recovery under
one recognized, central authority.
He added that he believes the
• United States has no right to try to
impose its form of government on
any of the conquered and recon
quered nations of Europe, and that
the pattern we have set in recog
nizing Badoglio in Italy is probably a
wise one as the return to peace for
these nations will be long and diffi
cult and will need to be made under
a strong government. The re-adjust
ment of government can come grad
ually, he says, without disrupting
the postwar social and economic evo
lution of Europe.
And for the Conquered?
Mr. King takes an opposite stand
on the question of restoration of
prewar governments to their con
quered nations. He believes that in
recognizing the Badoglio regime in
Italy we are settling a pattern of
reaction in the nations of Europe as
a bulwark against our imagined
threat of Bolshevism. He and Mr.
Grinned both agree that Russia
wants peace and only its own control
after the war. Russia, adds Mr. King,
would like to "foster the rise to
power of a popular-front regime in
Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and
Yugoslavia" and that it will tolerate
no anti-Russian government in Fin
land, "any more than it would toler
ate a Germany under the control of
Hitler after the war."
Finland's Folly
He said that "Finland acted fool
ishly in not accepting Russian peace
terms, and has apparently nailed her
flag to the Nazi mast and will go
under with the Nazi ship." He said
that undoubtedly Russian terms to
Finland will be harsher than they
originally were, but that he believed
Russia would not attempt to Soviet
ize Finland outright.
Mr. King said that undoubtedly
the governments-in-exile are in
close contact with their homeland,
particularly in.the case of the Neth
erlands, Norway, Belgium, and
Czechoslovakia, whose people think
with and are loyal to their rulers.
Distrust of America
The case is not the same, however,
in Greece, Yugoslavia, France, Italy,
and Spain; the French, he believes,
already distrust U.S. diplomatic pol
icy in view of the precedent we have
set in recognizing the "reactionary
governments of Franco, Darlan, Vic
tor Immanuel, Badoglio, and Giraud
. . . . we will probably even attempt
to strike a deal with Petain," a move
which he feels will cause distinct an
tagonism of the French for the
Americans.

American people, Robert M. P. Grin
nell, instructor in history, yesterday
stated in an interview with the
Daily that the postwar world will
most likely be dominated by the two
great powers of the United States in
the Western Hemisphere and Russia
in eastern, with England acting as a
balance in thought and influence be
tween the two nations. His state
ment was corroborated by Jere C.
King, also instructor in history.
Russian Influence
The opinions of the two men as to
the status of the other European
countries in the world after the war
were mainly alike, as they both
thought that the small nations of
eastern Europe would be actively
under the Russian "sphere of in
fluence." By this they meant that
although the Balkans, the Baltic
states, and Poland would be nomi
nally independent, their economic,
social, and political systems would
be oriented toward Russia.
Mr. King compared the "sovietiz
ing" of these states with the present
status of Outer Mongolia, which,
though nominally independent, leans
on the U.S.S.R. for economic and
partial political support.
French Disunity
Asked about the role of France in
the new Europe, Mr. Grinnell stated
that political differences certainly ex
ist within that country now, but
that "the Third Republic only masked
an ... . (identical) .... conflict in
France before the war." He added
that "the Petain element is in a
sense anti-democratic"; but said that
conditions were so obscure as to
make any prediction on his part
nothing more than a wild guess. He
said he thought that the U.S. State
Department might recognize Petain
when France is reconquered as an
effort on the part of the United Na
tions to bring about a peaceful and

amicable evolution of recovery under
one recognized, central authority.
He added that he believes the
• United States has no right to try to
impose its form of government on
any of the conquered and recon
quered nations of Europe, and that
the pattern we have set in recog
nizing Badoglio in Italy is probably a
wise one as the return to peace for
these nations will be long and diffi
cult and will need to be made under
a strong government. The re-adjust
ment of government can come grad
ually, he says, without disrupting
the postwar social and economic evo
lution of Europe.
And for the Conquered?
Mr. King takes an opposite stand
on the question of restoration of
prewar governments to their con
quered nations. He believes that in
recognizing the Badoglio regime in
Italy we are settling a pattern of
reaction in the nations of Europe as
a bulwark against our imagined
threat of Bolshevism. He and Mr.
Grinned both agree that Russia
wants peace and only its own control
after the war. Russia, adds Mr. King,
would like to "foster the rise to
power of a popular-front regime in
Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and
Yugoslavia" and that it will tolerate
no anti-Russian government in Fin
land, "any more than it would toler
ate a Germany under the control of
Hitler after the war."
Finland's Folly
He said that "Finland acted fool
ishly in not accepting Russian peace
terms, and has apparently nailed her
flag to the Nazi mast and will go
under with the Nazi ship." He said
that undoubtedly Russian terms to
Finland will be harsher than they
originally were, but that he believed
Russia would not attempt to Soviet
ize Finland outright.
Mr. King said that undoubtedly
the governments-in-exile are in
close contact with their homeland,
particularly in.the case of the Neth
erlands, Norway, Belgium, and
Czechoslovakia, whose people think
with and are loyal to their rulers.
Distrust of America
The case is not the same, however,
in Greece, Yugoslavia, France, Italy,
and Spain; the French, he believes,
already distrust U.S. diplomatic pol
icy in view of the precedent we have
set in recognizing the "reactionary
governments of Franco, Darlan, Vic
tor Immanuel, Badoglio, and Giraud
. . . . we will probably even attempt
to strike a deal with Petain," a move
which he feels will cause distinct an
tagonism of the French for the
Americans.

stated in an interview with the
Daily that the postwar world will
most likely be dominated by the two
great powers of the United States in
the Western Hemisphere and Russia
in eastern, with England acting as a
balance in thought and influence be
tween the two nations. His state
ment was corroborated by Jere C.
King, also instructor in history.
Russian Influence
The opinions of the two men as to
the status of the other European
countries in the world after the war
were mainly alike, as they both
thought that the small nations of
eastern Europe would be actively
under the Russian "sphere of in
fluence." By this they meant that
although the Balkans, the Baltic
states, and Poland would be nomi
nally independent, their economic,
social, and political systems would
be oriented toward Russia.
Mr. King compared the "sovietiz
ing" of these states with the present
status of Outer Mongolia, which,
though nominally independent, leans
on the U.S.S.R. for economic and
partial political support.
French Disunity
Asked about the role of France in
the new Europe, Mr. Grinnell stated
that political differences certainly ex
ist within that country now, but
that "the Third Republic only masked
an ... . (identical) .... conflict in
France before the war." He added
that "the Petain element is in a
sense anti-democratic"; but said that
conditions were so obscure as to
make any prediction on his part
nothing more than a wild guess. He
said he thought that the U.S. State
Department might recognize Petain
when France is reconquered as an
effort on the part of the United Na
tions to bring about a peaceful and

amicable evolution of recovery under
one recognized, central authority.
He added that he believes the
• United States has no right to try to
impose its form of government on
any of the conquered and recon
quered nations of Europe, and that
the pattern we have set in recog
nizing Badoglio in Italy is probably a
wise one as the return to peace for
these nations will be long and diffi
cult and will need to be made under
a strong government. The re-adjust
ment of government can come grad
ually, he says, without disrupting
the postwar social and economic evo
lution of Europe.
And for the Conquered?
Mr. King takes an opposite stand
on the question of restoration of
prewar governments to their con
quered nations. He believes that in
recognizing the Badoglio regime in
Italy we are settling a pattern of
reaction in the nations of Europe as
a bulwark against our imagined
threat of Bolshevism. He and Mr.
Grinned both agree that Russia
wants peace and only its own control
after the war. Russia, adds Mr. King,
would like to "foster the rise to
power of a popular-front regime in
Rumania, Bulgaria, Hungary, and
Yugoslavia" and that it will tolerate
no anti-Russian government in Fin
land, "any more than it would toler
ate a Germany under the control of
Hitler after the war."
Finland's Folly
He said that "Finland acted fool
ishly in not accepting Russian peace
terms, and has apparently nailed her
flag to the Nazi mast and will go
under with the Nazi ship." He said
that undoubtedly Russian terms to
Finland will be harsher than they
originally were, but that he believed
Russia would not attempt to Soviet
ize Finland outright.
Mr. King said that undoubtedly
the governments-in-exile are in
close contact with their homeland,
particularly in.the case of the Neth
erlands, Norway, Belgium, and
Czechoslovakia, whose people think
with and are loyal to their rulers.
Distrust of America
The case is not the same, however,
in Greece, Yugoslavia, France, Italy,
and Spain; the French, he believes,
already distrust U.S. diplomatic pol
icy in view of the precedent we have
set in recognizing the "reactionary
governments of Franco, Darlan, Vic
tor Immanuel, Badoglio, and Giraud
. . . . we will probably even attempt
to strike a deal with Petain," a move
which he feels will cause distinct an
tagonism of the French for the
Americans.


NIPS FURNISH NlPS—Yanks chased Japs so fast from Lor
engau, Manus Island, in Admiralty group, that they left this
food supply. Now there'll be plenty of "kai kai"—food to you
—for the natives when the supply is distributed.
