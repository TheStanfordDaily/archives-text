The Pacific Coast League pennant
race is shaping up to the expectations
of most ernest observers. Los An
geles, the title winner of last season,
s tied with the local San Francisco
Seals at one game ahead of San Di
ego. The Angels would have had the
undisputed lead if they had not lost
to Oakland last Tuesday night by a |
lOth-frame homer which the Acorn's j
manager took off the first pitch of
the inning.
The Seals are not to be disregarded j
in their bid for the pennant, for at j
the present time they are leading the [
rest of the league in the hitting de- j
partment with a healthy .308 aver- j
age. The Sacramento club, with a |
•.sign "under new management" on j
their door is still in the cellar and !
will probably remain there all sea- j
son.

Taking a look at the Nationals we j
find the New York Giants in a tie j
with Cincinnati for first-place hon- |
ors. This jumbled league is not liv- j
ing up to the expectations of the ex- !
perts so far, but the season is still
young, and by the time the final
games roll around we should see St.
Louis up at the top with the Chicago
Cubs trailing by a slight margin.
The American's Yankees are put
ting up a sad showing thus far and
it looks as if they'll never even get
to the world series this year. St.
Louis is far ahead of the field with an
eight-game margin and should hold
it for the duration—of the season.
