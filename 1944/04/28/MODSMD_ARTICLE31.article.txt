# Hayes Downs Mckinley, 3-0 In Second Round of Murals
## 
### Bill Adams 
Going into the second round of the
intramural diamond season, all five
of Tuesday's victorious teams re
mained undefeated in what will be
the wildest day of baseball in the
current season. Every game was a
shutout, as the perennial winners
had a field day.
Closest of yesterday's games was
the 3 to 0 shutout registered by
Hayes over McKinley, with Hayes
pitcher Morrison allowing only two
safe hits while chalking up 14 strike
outs. The game was close through
out, with both pitchers pitching good
ball and retaining control through
out. Hayes scored one run in the
second inning, and two in the sixth
as Morrison and Bill Walsh scored
on Ernie Adams' long single. Pitch
er Morrison was only in trouble once
during the game, with runners on
second and third bases with one out
in the third inning; but he pulled
himself out beautifully, striking out
the next two batters.
The remaining four games proved
to be walkaways as the favored
teams ran true to form, copping ev

ery encounter by lopsintd scores.
Joe Sher remained at the top of the
list of pitchers, pitching his second
no-hit, no-run game as Monroe
slaughtered inexperienced Garfield.
Sher struck out 19 men, while issu
ing three passes. Ed Luce's homer
topped the parade of hits.
Firehouse, the perennial Yankees
of the Stanford circuit, defeated Ty
ler handily, 8 to 0, as pitcher Ash
ley allowed but one hit. Longest hit
of the game was Roth's double.
Slamming out five hits for nine
runs in the last two innings, Med
School completely swamped the
green Buchanan nine, 11 to 0. Tyler
scored an easy victory over the
newly formed Legal Eagles, 9 to 0,
although the Eagles threatened in
the last two innings.
