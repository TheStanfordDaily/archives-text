Mike Donohue says that the pre
liminary work for formation of two
leagues and scheduling is practically
completed. The softball planning
committee comprising Messrs. Way
man, Fox and K. Harris is smoothing
out difficulties and has announced
that four "A" Co. teams and six "C"
Co. combines are rarin' to go.
The league schedule leads up to
a playoff between the two companies
for the SCU championship. An all—
star aggregate from both companies
is also expected to cross bats with
the civvie and Navy champs. Tom
Sweeney and Ed Blum head the "A"
and "C" loops, respectively.
Ed Lusey, soccer solon, tells me
that two "A" Co. elevens and a brace
of "C" Co. squads are awaiting the
green light on the striped sward. All
prospective booters are advised to
see Mike Donohue or Ed Lusey if
they would like to rub shins this
quarter.
