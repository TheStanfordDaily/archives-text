# 'Life's What You Make It' Says Courageous Pioneer

### HELEN DIETZ 
When Mrs. Alice Craford of Palo
Alto applied for cleaning work at
Roble Hall she stated that she was
''neat, quick, and energetic,'" but she
didn't say that the spirit of the
American pioneer is reflected in her
youthful courage, which has never
wavered from frontier days in the
Oklahoma wilderness to the present
iirtie.
Tiny, lively Mrs. Craford. who bi
cycles to and from her Roble job
every day, was born on the Kansas
prairie in 1880. not very many years
after Custer's "Last Stand." She was,
she says, "her father's boy," and did
everything from caring for children
and teaching school to plowing and
pitching hay.
"Today's Responsibility"
People these days, she says, don't
realize their advantages. "Today it
is the responsibility of all young
people to apply themselves to their
studies and seek their best oppor
tunities, for it is their task to rebuild
the world."
At the age of 18 Mrs. Craford be
gan her school-teaching days—with a
mile and a half walk to the one-room
log building where she taught 35
pupils (some up to 21 years of age),
and then stayed to do her own janitor
work—all for $20 a month.
Keaditi* and 'Rithmatic

i With a smile, Mrs. Craford recalled
. many of her amusing class-room in-
I cidents; but, she added, life in the
I pioneer country was often hard and J
I «rim.
Many is the time she has nursed
j entire families through an illness;
| buried some, comforted the rest.;
j Often she has seen herds of cattle '
i huddled along a wire fence struck !
dead by a tremendous bolt of prairie :
lightning; and once in her life she •
had the terrifying sight of a prairie
fire.
Wandering; Years
In 1901 Mrs. Craford moved to I
Colorado with her husband, a rail- j
road man. From there they went to
Utah, and then to California, where !
the oranges and blossoms impressed
her most.
Vitally interested in people and j
j current events, Mrs. Craford says
| she loves history and, above all. I
j children. That young grandson's
j coming visit has her terrifically ex- I
| cited!
