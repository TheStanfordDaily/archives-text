# 'Sing' Time Now at 7
## 
### 
Stanford's traditional Spring Sing, |
set for May 5. has registered a rec- ;
ord-breaking number of 28 entrants, j
according to Blossom Parke, chair- i
man of the sing. As a result, the i
time for the start of the sing, orig- i
inally scheduled for 7:30, has been
moved up to 7 o'clock, so that the
program may be executed completely
and smoothly in the limited time. It is
requested, according to Miss Parke,
that all living groups plan their
meal time for G o'clock so that the
various entrants and spectators will
be assembled in the amphitheater j
promptly at 7 p.m.
Nurses from the Stanford Lane
Hospital have submitted their entry, j
and entries have also been received i
from the first and second-year med- |
ical students. Five judges will be on
hand to select from the various en- j
trants the best presentations in the
three groups: undergraduate women, j
undergraduate men, and graduate j
students. Winners will receive the |
traditional trophies.
The Stanford Band, under the di- j
rection of Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, j
will be on hand throughout the pro- t
gram, leading the "Star-Spangled j
Banner" and playing various selec
tions midway in the sing'.
