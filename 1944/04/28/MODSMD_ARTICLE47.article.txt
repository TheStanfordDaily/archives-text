# 'Jane Eyre' Gets the Air
## 
### 
JANE EYRE, now playing at the '
Stanford Theater, starring Orson I
Welles, Joan Fontaine, and Mar
garet O'Brien.
Columbia Pictures should go hide
its face in shame! The story, from
the novel of the same name by Char- j
lotte Bronte of the Bronte sisters, j
concerns a poor little orphan girl j
(Joan Fontaine) who gets battered |
around in her youth by a cruel aunt, !
and later by a cruu-ell schoolmas- !
ter at an institution for wicked, un- j
Christian little girls.
Enter the Villain
Our problem child grows up and I
gets a job as a governess at the j
home of a wealthy member of the j
landed gentry. Her charge (Mar- 1
garet O'Brien) is a cute little girl \
who provides the only light spots j
in the picture; however, our hero
ine eventually marries her moody J
and unpredictable boss alter many !
trials and tribulations including HIS j
insane wife.
Orson Welles is definitely not at
his dramatic best, and manages to
make his characterization appear
more like a side of ham than a se- j
rious portrayal of a serious part, j
Joan Fontaine is painfully meek in j
her role as Jane, and drags herself ;
through the picture evidently suffer
ing just as much as the audience.
Margaret O'Brien turns in her usual j
quaint performance; but acting hon- |
ors must go to little Peggy Ann Gar
ner who plays the part of Jane as a
little girl. She performed with spirit j
and well-timed restraint, atid may j
well be someone to watch for in the I
future if her bosses can find parts j
good enough for her.
No Love, No Nuthin'
Orchids must go to Orson and
Joan for the best example of self
control—only one clinch in the en
tire show! And they fell madly in ;
love from the moment their eyes
crossed! Moral: Save your dough j
and read the book. —Shelton
