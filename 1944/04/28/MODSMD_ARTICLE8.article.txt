# Juniors To Give Water Carnival
## 
### 
Rain or shine, Stanford is going to
have a Junior Water Carnival. Be
cause the lake would be too low to
swim from the boathouse, the carni
val will take place in the men's
swimming pool, Saturday. May 13,
at 2 o'clock, according to Ann Wen
dling, chairman of the carnival.
Since it will be impossible to have
the traditional canoe float contest,
there will be instead a bathing
beauty contest, in which all the wom
en's living groups will be represented.
The usual swimming relay races
and stunt swimming events besides
speed races will be on the program.
Prizes will be given on an accumu
lative-point basis, and a perpetual
trophy will be given to the person
withthe highest score in each, a
men's and women's living group.
Some events will add to the total
score and will be open only to or
zanized groups, other events not
counting on the total score will be
open to all students, these last events
will have special prizes.
