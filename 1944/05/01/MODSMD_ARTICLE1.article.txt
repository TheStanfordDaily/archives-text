The nominating committee for the
Stanford student elections to be held
on Wednesday, May 10, will open the
election week proceedings with
meetings on Thursday morning, May
4, and Friday afternoon, May 5, ac
cording to Sybil Harrison, chairman
of Election Board.
Petitions on Monday, May 8, dec
linations on Tuesday, May 9, and a
general assembly preceding the elec
tions on Wednesday, May 10, is the
schedule which has been approved
by Excom.
Board Listed
Election Board, headed by Miss
Harrison, includes the following stu
dents: B. J. Calfee, Bud Chasnoff,
Bob DeMott, Margaret Foley, Dixie
Good, Don Hoytt, Gwen Jones, Wini
fred Lamm, Ruth Larsen, Barbara
Stofer, Carol Swasey, Muriel Tarr,
and J. D. Williams.
The purpose of Election Board is
outlined in the 1942 A.S.S.U. Con
stitution and By-Laws as follows:
"Election Board shall have charge
of all elections held under the au
thority of the student body associa
tion. It shall also determine the eligi
bility for elective or appointive of
fices as of the current directory of
officers and students."
Take Office in Fall
Officers who are elected next
will take office in the fall and serve
for three quarters. The present of
ficeholders will continue in then
positions during this summer with
appointment made to fill any vacan
cies. This new plan was approved
by Excom on the recommendation of
a committee headed by Ewell Sale
which has studied the election sys
tem and offered plans for its im
provement.
The committee, which included
Dick Driscoll, Luana Forkner, Irma
Cunha, Helen Jones, Sybil Harrison,
Julie Crommelin, and Lucian Rice
explained in its report that the new
system "would give a smoother tran
sition in that there would be more
time to learn and to make use of this
learning."
Articles Planned
A series of articles will be pub
lished by the Stanford Daily which
will be written by present office
holders.
