# TRIBUTE TO SHAF
## 
### 
The following letter was placed on the editor's
desk yesterday morning. The author is un
known; the letter is probably the finest tribute
that could be paid Hal Shafer, editor of The
Stanford Daily in 1942 and squadron leader of
a U.S. Marine Corps Corsair squadron who lost
his life April 9 in the New Hebrides.
DEAR SHAF:
You should be writing in this column, not I.
You should be back here at the Daily Shack. It
should be the spring of 1942 instead of 1944.
The editor's office is a man's office, and you
and Charlie should be sitting around talking
about the world again.
On that certain evening in April you leaned
out of that carved-up window and said you were
glad you were going into the Navy, but there
was a lot you wanted to come back for.
Stanford is going along as usual, Shaf. The
spirit hasn't gone nor the ideal. But this morning
your last story hit us, and for a while we didn't
want to go on as usual. We wanted to remember
for a moment.
We want it the way it used to be. We want
the green and black shirt to be hanging on the
hook and the light on in the office whenever
we'd go by. We want to sit around again, you
and Charlie and us, laughing about the Burma
Road story. We want to pile into your car again
and head for Half Moon or go to the Swanee
and hear that solid jive.
Remember the Daily party at the Palace? That
was the night you took over the Key and Ring
from Charlie and became editor of Volume 101.
And you proved yourself, Shaf, because today
there's still an empty spot at the Shack that can't
be filled.
I don't know why it should be you who isn't
coming back. I don't understand it. Yet that's
what the paper said this morning. But it's not
right. You made your place in the world and no
one can take that place.
You've left something behind, Shaf. Not just
memories. I'd like to call it spirit in living. We'll
guard it well because it's something each mem
ber of the old staff felt but often failed to express.
There aren't many of the old staff around any
more. We should all be back together again,
and you should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers. Our work
changes and our life. But I wanted to come back
to your office just once more and remember
that spring of 1942 and try in some way to say
we're going to miss you very much.

You should be writing in this column, not I.
You should be back here at the Daily Shack. It
should be the spring of 1942 instead of 1944.
The editor's office is a man's office, and you
and Charlie should be sitting around talking
about the world again.
On that certain evening in April you leaned
out of that carved-up window and said you were
glad you were going into the Navy, but there
was a lot you wanted to come back for.
Stanford is going along as usual, Shaf. The
spirit hasn't gone nor the ideal. But this morning
your last story hit us, and for a while we didn't
want to go on as usual. We wanted to remember
for a moment.
We want it the way it used to be. We want
the green and black shirt to be hanging on the
hook and the light on in the office whenever
we'd go by. We want to sit around again, you
and Charlie and us, laughing about the Burma
Road story. We want to pile into your car again
and head for Half Moon or go to the Swanee
and hear that solid jive.
Remember the Daily party at the Palace? That
was the night you took over the Key and Ring
from Charlie and became editor of Volume 101.
And you proved yourself, Shaf, because today
there's still an empty spot at the Shack that can't
be filled.
I don't know why it should be you who isn't
coming back. I don't understand it. Yet that's
what the paper said this morning. But it's not
right. You made your place in the world and no
one can take that place.
You've left something behind, Shaf. Not just
memories. I'd like to call it spirit in living. We'll
guard it well because it's something each mem
ber of the old staff felt but often failed to express.
There aren't many of the old staff around any
more. We should all be back together again,
and you should be writing this column. But
columns change in newspapers. Our work
changes and our life. But I wanted to come back
to your office just once more and remember
that spring of 1942 and try in some way to say
we're going to miss you very much.
The following letter was placed on the editor's
desk yesterday morning. The author is un
known; the letter is probably the finest tribute
that could be paid Hal Shafer, editor of The
Stanford Daily in 1942 and squadron leader of
a U.S. Marine Corps Corsair squadron who lost
his life April 9 in the New Hebrides.
