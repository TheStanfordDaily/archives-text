With what appears to be a stepped up tempo, I
Britain-based allied bombers cut loose with a ,
double-barrelled salvo at the French invasion
coast over the weekend.
Following a designated plan —now officially i
termed the pre-invasion offensive—-huge Forts
and Liberators dropped what was estimated by ;
observers of close to 500 tons of bombs an hour.
This is a good 200 tons over the last reported 1
average bomb tempo.
The bombers hit the Cherbourg port area, j
coastal fortifications at Pas De Calais and a
Luftwaffe airdrome at Avoid, south of Paris. Four
0
bombers and three fighters failed to return from
the huge operation.
Earlier the British loosed a thousand-plane
raid on Friedrichschafen, on the shores of Lake
Constance. The British heavies also struck at
the railway yards in Montzen, Belgium, and
Aulnoye, France.
The big guestion now is—can this be sus
tained over a long enough period to leave the
Germans groggy—or is it a sporadic affair. In
any event, such a sizable raid is enough to leave
the Germans punchy—whether the bombs fall
at this rate or not.
Try and visualize bombs falling at the rate of
eight tons a minute over a sustained period on
one of our industrial centers. Not nearly so
hard to think of the tremendous task carried out
by the allied heavyweights when thought of in
these terms, is it?
Implying many things, the Germans an
nounced they, too, had carried out a large
bomber raid. The object of their raid—the offi
cial radio Der Deutscher-reichsender said, was
the many invasion vessels clustered and crowd-1
ing the harbors and channels of England.
In some respects it looks like typical German
counter-propaganda and an effort to make the
Allies seem insignificant at home in the Fortress
Europe. The German citizens supposedly would
then forget about the allied bombers.
Unfortunately, they can't forget the allied
bombers and their death eggs to the tune of 500
tons per hour.
With all this activity something big is brewing
in England and only time will tell what and
where. We wished we had a nickel for every
invasion date that has been suggested to us— 1
then it would no longer be necessary to work.;
But—and this is the first prediction made within j
these confines—we'll go out on the limb for
May 10. No reason other than it just somehow
seems right, which is just as good as some of
the reasons behind D-day reasoning.

where. We wished we had a nickel for every
invasion date that has been suggested to us— 1
then it would no longer be necessary to work.;
But—and this is the first prediction made within j
these confines—we'll go out on the limb for
May 10. No reason other than it just somehow
seems right, which is just as good as some of
the reasons behind D-day reasoning.
With what appears to be a stepped up tempo, I
Britain-based allied bombers cut loose with a ,
double-barrelled salvo at the French invasion
coast over the weekend.
Following a designated plan —now officially i
termed the pre-invasion offensive—-huge Forts
and Liberators dropped what was estimated by ;
observers of close to 500 tons of bombs an hour.
This is a good 200 tons over the last reported 1
average bomb tempo.
The bombers hit the Cherbourg port area, j
coastal fortifications at Pas De Calais and a
Luftwaffe airdrome at Avoid, south of Paris. Four
0
bombers and three fighters failed to return from
the huge operation.
Earlier the British loosed a thousand-plane
raid on Friedrichschafen, on the shores of Lake
Constance. The British heavies also struck at
the railway yards in Montzen, Belgium, and
Aulnoye, France.
The big guestion now is—can this be sus
tained over a long enough period to leave the
Germans groggy—or is it a sporadic affair. In
any event, such a sizable raid is enough to leave
the Germans punchy—whether the bombs fall
at this rate or not.
Try and visualize bombs falling at the rate of
eight tons a minute over a sustained period on
one of our industrial centers. Not nearly so
hard to think of the tremendous task carried out
by the allied heavyweights when thought of in
these terms, is it?
Implying many things, the Germans an
nounced they, too, had carried out a large
bomber raid. The object of their raid—the offi
cial radio Der Deutscher-reichsender said, was
the many invasion vessels clustered and crowd-1
ing the harbors and channels of England.
In some respects it looks like typical German
counter-propaganda and an effort to make the
Allies seem insignificant at home in the Fortress
Europe. The German citizens supposedly would
then forget about the allied bombers.
Unfortunately, they can't forget the allied
bombers and their death eggs to the tune of 500
tons per hour.
With all this activity something big is brewing
in England and only time will tell what and
where. We wished we had a nickel for every
invasion date that has been suggested to us— 1
then it would no longer be necessary to work.;
