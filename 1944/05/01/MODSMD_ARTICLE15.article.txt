THE INVASION, WHERE? WHEN?
In the last few months just about every news
commentator in the world has been speculating
about where and when the invasion of Europe
will take place. For that reason, we feel that we
should express our views on the subject.
A Stockholm report announced yesterday that
the invasion will take place last Saturday. This
rumor, however, is to be discredited.
Other sources of information have set the date
and time of the invasion for May 5, 6:44.30 a.m.;
June 2, 7:11 a.m., or p.m. if the weather is foggy
in the morning; May 19, sometime during the
day (the guy who thought this one up is off his
trolly); June 29; etc., etc.
Bullsession debunks all these prognostications
and predicts, without fear of contradiction, that
the invasion will take place.
Many people are of the opinion that the point
of invasion will be France. Others feel that it
will be in Belgium or Holland. Some even think
that the invasion will take place in Denmark.
Again Bullsession debunks and predicts that
the invasion will take place in Europe.
We hope this clears up the matter once and
for all.
