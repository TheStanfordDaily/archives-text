## 
### DICK BLOCK 
Johnny Fulton, the Farm's star
trackman, pulled a fast one to win
the 440 at Edwards Field Saturday.
Fulton ran for Dink Templeton's
Olympic Club group on the Berkeley
campus, where the Bear-UCLA meet
was in progress. The Winged O team
was an unofficial entry in the meet,
which was won by Cal, 68-62.
Fulton usually starts a race in first
place, and stays there the entire time,
but it was a different story last Sat
urday. He started slowly and took
his time for the first 250 yards. By
the time the 250 yards had passed
under the fleeting feet of the run
ners Johnny was well to the rear of
the lead man, George Leisz of Cal.
At' this point the red and white
clad Fulton passed the Bear and
Bruin lads as if they were standing
still. He finished 10 yards ahead of
Leisz. Jim Sheppard of Cal finished
third and Bert West of UCLA fourth;
time—:49.2. Fulton also won the
220 in 22 seconds flat.
Emerson Hiler of the Olympic
Club, and also a Stanford medical
student, outdistanced Roger Harding
of Cal in the discus event. One of
Coach Harry Trotter's Bruin stars
was Bob Carr. Carr is a V-12 trainee
on the Westwood reservation. He

previously broadjumped for the
Stanford cinder team. Although he
was only a fair sprinter here, the
boy has really improved. He won the
100-yard dash, the 220. and also the
broadjump.
