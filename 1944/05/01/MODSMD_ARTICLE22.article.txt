# Religious Groups Gather
## 
### 
An all-college group meeting held
at the Presbyterian Church last night
at 7 was the first time this year the
various religious college groups came
together to hold a joint discussion on
religious topics.
This meeting started with a devo
tional service led by the pastor of the
church, Dr. E. C. Thompson. Follow
ing the vesper service, the college
groups went to the Westminster
Room of the church where the dis-
I cussion was held.
The meeting was opened by Miss
I Connie Thomas, president of the
' Westminster Group. James Emerson

| acted as moderator for the discussion
I which centered around the subject
j of "Faith."
Such questions as "Is our faith
blind, and if so, why do we follow
it?" or "How far in religion and in
daily life do we have faith?" were
considered.
