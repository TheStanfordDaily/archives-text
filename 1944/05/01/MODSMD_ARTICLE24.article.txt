# 'Religion Not An Escape'- Trueblood
## 
### 
At the regular chapel service yes
terday morning, Dr. D. Elton True
blood, chaplain, stated that the pop
ular contention that people are turn
ing to religion as an escape is not in
accordance with the evidence.
"There is some turning to religion,"'
Dr. Trueblood said, "but the letters
of young men show that they are
not thus turning." People who try
to follow Christian principles often
feel alone and are ridiculed, he said.
The experience of Capt. "Eddy"
Rickenbacker is an exception.
"We do not delude ourselves," the
chaplain continued, "for it is still
true that those who worship the liv
ing God are in a minority, even in
the Western World."
Dr. Trueblood then stated that
people do not usually turn to re
ligion as an escape because religious
faith has not made life easier but
harder. Religion is a poor way to
try and escape. You don't find es
capes in the Bible, he continued;
for Jesus warned the people to count
the cost before following Him.
Religion, Dr. Trueblood went on
to say, often associates people with
unpopular causes. "As was seen in
the caption under the Archbishop of
York's picture in a recent issue of
'Time,' 'the function of religion is to
arouse the conscience of the state,
not to make men feel good'," he said.
'Mentioning the fact that many
people turn to God when near death,
Dr. Trueblood pointed out that very
often people do not see the l-ealities
of life until faced with pain or a
great crisis. Pain helps to break
down conceit and self-complacency.
"Pain may be that which opens the
door to reality," he said.
Dr. Trueblood concluded by re
ferring to some letters he had re
ceived from boys in the service. One
letter expressed discouragement at
the attitude of boys regarding re
ligion and the basic ideals for which
they are fighting. The other letter
stated that the most beneficial part
of the church services was where
they learned about Jesus Christ.
