# Bathing Beauties To Parade At Water Carnival Next Week
## 
### 
Featuring a bathing beauty contest in which all the women's living
groups will be represented, instead, of the usual canoe float contest, the
annual Junior Water Carnival will be held Saturday, May 13, at 2 p.m. in
the men's pool.
The carnival is not being held in the lake this year because the water

* level would be too low to swim from
! the boathouse, according to Aim
j Wendling, chairman.
The usual swimming relay races
and stunt swimming events besides
speed races will be on the program.
Prizes will be given on an accumu
lative-point basis and a perpetual
j trophy will be given to the person
j with the highest score in each men's
I and women's living groups.
Some event will add to the total
j score and will be open only to or
ganized groups. Other events not
counting on the total score will be
open to all students. These last
! events will have special prizes.
The members of the committee for
' the carnival besides the chairman are
j Johnny Fulton, master of cere-
I monies; Gregg D'Nelly and Carol
i Carpenter, events; Tom Martzloff,
concessions; Betty Kenny, beauty
contest; Janice Jaques, publicity;
Nancy Norris prizes; Frankie Mc-
Innis, programs; Bee Jay Miller,
I judges.
