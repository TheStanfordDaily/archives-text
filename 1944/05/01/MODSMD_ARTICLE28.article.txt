on the crew of a comedy play are in
vited to meet this Wednesday night

out for a musical comedy production
to be put on by the Stanford Players
next month.
Moliere's famous comedy, "The
School for Husband," is the play
chosen by the Stanford Players. The
entire play takes place in a square
in Paris about the year 1661.
Costumes will be of the early
Louis XIV period, with the excep
tion of the dancers in the dream in
terlude who will be dressed as
Egyptians.
The original comedy by Moliere
was written entirely in rhyme, and
the Americanized version keeps the
majority of the lines in couplet form.
This version was translated and
adapted by Arthur Guiterman and
Lawrence Langner for the New York
Theater Guild and presented by it a
few years ago.
