# Zero To 'Land' In Paly Today
## 
### 
Early this morning a Jap Zero
fighter plane will land in the heart of
, Palo Alto. Shot down over Guadal
| canal, this plane will make its "land
| ing" from a specially constructed 10-
ton truck.
The Zero is to be put on display
on the parking lot adjoining the
Stanford Theater on Ramona street
directly opposite the front entrance

To Raise Funds
In the interest of naval welfare and
to raise funds in behalf of sailors,
marines, coast guardsmen, and their
families in the 11th, 12th, and 13th
naval districts, this plane has been
loaned to the Naval Aid Auxiliary by
the United States Navy Bureau of
Aeronautics for exhibition purposes.
Upon being shot down, this Zero,
which was piloted by a Jap squadron
leader as evidenced by the chevrons
painted on the fuselage, remained in
the water for about two weeks be
fore being salvaged by the Navy and
J brought to this country for observa-
I tion.
Observers were impressed with the
lack of pilot protection. There was
no armored plate on the plane and
J the pilot relied upon his speed,
j maneuverability, and climbing power
j for his protection.
"'Brother" Observed
Similar observations were made on
j a "brother" of this Zero, namely
! "Zeke," a Mitsubishi 00 brought
' down over the Aleutians in April
I of 1942.
The motor, still to be seen in this
j Zero, is modeled after the British
Armstrong-Siddeley Tiger 7, and is
a 14-cylinder twin-row radial air
cooled engine capable of 1,400 horse
j power. It is this motor and the light
ness of the plane, weighing only 5,207
j pounds fully loaded, that gives it its
: speed and maneuverability.
For armament this carrier-based
! plane has two 7.7 mm. machine guns
j which shoot through the propeller
' and two 22 mm. cannon, one in each
j wing.
Admission 30 Cents
Admission to view the plane is 30
cents for adults and 15 cents for

"'Brother" Observed
Similar observations were made on
j a "brother" of this Zero, namely
! "Zeke," a Mitsubishi 00 brought
' down over the Aleutians in April
I of 1942.
The motor, still to be seen in this
j Zero, is modeled after the British
Armstrong-Siddeley Tiger 7, and is
a 14-cylinder twin-row radial air
cooled engine capable of 1,400 horse
j power. It is this motor and the light
ness of the plane, weighing only 5,207
j pounds fully loaded, that gives it its
: speed and maneuverability.
For armament this carrier-based
! plane has two 7.7 mm. machine guns
j which shoot through the propeller
' and two 22 mm. cannon, one in each
j wing.
Admission 30 Cents
Admission to view the plane is 30
cents for adults and 15 cents for
j children, all funds being used for
I naval personnel.
Early this morning a Jap Zero
fighter plane will land in the heart of
, Palo Alto. Shot down over Guadal
| canal, this plane will make its "land
| ing" from a specially constructed 10-
ton truck.
The Zero is to be put on display
on the parking lot adjoining the
Stanford Theater on Ramona street
directly opposite the front entrance
to the City Hall, and will be on dis
play today, tomorrow, and Wednes
day from 10 a.m. to 10 p.m.
To Raise Funds
In the interest of naval welfare and
to raise funds in behalf of sailors,
marines, coast guardsmen, and their
families in the 11th, 12th, and 13th
naval districts, this plane has been
loaned to the Naval Aid Auxiliary by
the United States Navy Bureau of
Aeronautics for exhibition purposes.
Upon being shot down, this Zero,
which was piloted by a Jap squadron
leader as evidenced by the chevrons
painted on the fuselage, remained in
the water for about two weeks be
fore being salvaged by the Navy and
J brought to this country for observa-
I tion.
Observers were impressed with the
lack of pilot protection. There was
no armored plate on the plane and
J the pilot relied upon his speed,
j maneuverability, and climbing power
j for his protection.
