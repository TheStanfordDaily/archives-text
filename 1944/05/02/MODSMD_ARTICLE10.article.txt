# U.S., British War Planes Deliver May Day Assault
## 
### 
LONDON, Tuesday, May 2 (UP) —
Up to 3,500 allied war planes, in a
May Day assault on enslaved Europe,
thundered over France and Belgium
from dawn to dusk yesterday, crum
bling Adolf Hitler's anti-invasion
fortifications and railroad targets.
Early today, the German radio said
strong RAF formations were again
roaring into Germany.
Some 1,000 U.S. Flying Fortresses
and Liberators and hundreds of other
American planes of all types par
ticipated in powerful attacks on at
least 16 important rail centers in
France and Belgium.
Three bombers of the U.S. Eighth
Air Force and one from the Ninth
Air Force, together with three fight
ers were missing from the assault in
which thousands of tons of high ex
plosives and incendiaries spread ruin
and fires.
For hour after hour, American
planes roared over Europe looking
for Nazi planes, but from the day's
operations, only five Nazi craft were
found and destroyed—three by fight
ers and two by heavy bomber gun
ners.
