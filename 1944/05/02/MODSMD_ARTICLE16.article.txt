IN SIX DAYS candidates' nominations for A.S.
S.U. offices will be due; three days later voting
will be conducted, and, willy-nilly, officers for
three quarters beginning next autumn will have
been chosen.
The election of competent and visionary stu
dent officers this quarter is more important than
ever before. Student government at Stanford is
far from dead, but unless the average student
evinces an interest in keeping it alive and
healthy by the infusion of new political blood, a
wake may indeed soon be in progress.
In every educational institution in the United
States young men and women are thinking,
planning, and organizing for postwar education
and the part their particular institution will play
in education for academic reconversion, rehabil
itation, and instruction in international thinking.
Stanford must be represented in this postwar
effort by the student body officers, for although
our faculty is working toward a complete post
war program, widespread success will depend
upon youth.
Stanford can lead the college program of
postwar education, and the student body officers
we elect can, in their time, contribute measur
ably to the position Stanford has in the coming
educational program. Make your nominations
for candidates next Monday; study the names of
other candidates, backgrounds, and qualifica
tions which will be published in the Daily, then
on Wednesday, May 10, one week from tomor
row, VOTE. â€”Dave Davis
