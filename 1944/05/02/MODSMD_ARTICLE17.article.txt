PERHAPS the most unsung service of the war
having the most overused misnomer and the
least known is propaganda. First and foremost
Noah Webster says: "Propaganda —more fully
Congregation of Propaganda. A congregation of
cardinals (the sacred congregation of cardinals
de propaganda de fide) established in 1622,
charged with management of missions. More
fully college of Propaganda for educating
priests."
Then our misused term today stems from the
idea that Propaganda was originally a mission
charged with the dissemination of a certain
given set of principles or doctrines.
We adhere more closely to the original mean
ing of the word than does either of our enemies.
Both the Germans and the Japanese use propa
ganda to distribute false information about their
respective home countries and the progress of
the war. There were two such instances at
Guadalcanal and Cassino which tend to support
the theory of distribution of false information. A
captured Japanese prisoner, after he had re
alized he wasn't going to be shot by his captors,
arrogantly said, "You may have the Solomon
Islands well under control but you will never
regain San Francisco." Delusion One.
Delusion Two occurred just a few days ago
when a German soldier arrogantly told his cap
tors that the war was decidedly going well for
the Germans and that New York now lay in
ruins—the destruction caused by long-range
high-flying Nazi bombers."
This is the use propaganda is being put to by
our enemies.
The Allies on the other hand have put propa

ganda to a variety of uses. Perhaps the most
outstanding is the dissemination of truth. Early
in the war .before the American entry, the British
found the going tough. It would have been easy
to lie continually about conditions at home to
the other nations and the British troops through
the medium of the British Broadcasting Corpora
tion nightly overseas shows. However, they
found that truth was the best propaganda.
When things are tough, the going rough and
a person admits it—people are most apt to be
lieve him when things are right with him. The
English and the Americans have followed this
policy and found there is little or no refutation
of their statements.
Should you be interested, listen to any of our
enemies spouting nightly over their short-wave
channels. The truth hurts, and one can easily
hear how this is borne out by listening to Radio
Tokyo. Japan comes in as clear as a bell in this
area and can be heard every morning from 8
a.m. to 12 noon, or 10:30 p.m. until midnight on
9.5 megacycles. It is really interesting to listen
to them talk like a Dutch uncle trying to square
themselves with society as a whole.

given set of principles or doctrines.
We adhere more closely to the original mean
ing of the word than does either of our enemies.
Both the Germans and the Japanese use propa
ganda to distribute false information about their
respective home countries and the progress of
the war. There were two such instances at
Guadalcanal and Cassino which tend to support
the theory of distribution of false information. A
captured Japanese prisoner, after he had re
alized he wasn't going to be shot by his captors,
arrogantly said, "You may have the Solomon
Islands well under control but you will never
regain San Francisco." Delusion One.
Delusion Two occurred just a few days ago
when a German soldier arrogantly told his cap
tors that the war was decidedly going well for
the Germans and that New York now lay in
ruins—the destruction caused by long-range
high-flying Nazi bombers."
This is the use propaganda is being put to by
our enemies.
The Allies on the other hand have put propa

ganda to a variety of uses. Perhaps the most
outstanding is the dissemination of truth. Early
in the war .before the American entry, the British
found the going tough. It would have been easy
to lie continually about conditions at home to
the other nations and the British troops through
the medium of the British Broadcasting Corpora
tion nightly overseas shows. However, they
found that truth was the best propaganda.
When things are tough, the going rough and
a person admits it—people are most apt to be
lieve him when things are right with him. The
English and the Americans have followed this
policy and found there is little or no refutation
of their statements.
Should you be interested, listen to any of our
enemies spouting nightly over their short-wave
channels. The truth hurts, and one can easily
hear how this is borne out by listening to Radio
Tokyo. Japan comes in as clear as a bell in this
area and can be heard every morning from 8
a.m. to 12 noon, or 10:30 p.m. until midnight on
9.5 megacycles. It is really interesting to listen
to them talk like a Dutch uncle trying to square
themselves with society as a whole.
PERHAPS the most unsung service of the war
having the most overused misnomer and the
least known is propaganda. First and foremost
Noah Webster says: "Propaganda —more fully
Congregation of Propaganda. A congregation of
cardinals (the sacred congregation of cardinals
de propaganda de fide) established in 1622,
charged with management of missions. More
fully college of Propaganda for educating
priests."
Then our misused term today stems from the
idea that Propaganda was originally a mission
charged with the dissemination of a certain
given set of principles or doctrines.
