# Bull Session

### BARNEY GUGEL 
Last Friday Bullsession presented a number 1
of burnt-coi k gags which it thought might be |
used in the Spring Show. For some reason or ,
another, the Spring Show is not going to use |
them, so we're going to offer another suggestion. [
As there will be a few intellectuals and lan-!
guage majors at the performances, there is no
reason why a bon mot or two couldn't be put in
especially for their benefit. For example, run a
I joke in a foreign language.
! This would be very easy. All you need to do 112
is to print a vocabulary for the joke in the pro- i
gram and then during a dull spot in the show,
make with the gag. The effect would be some-;
thing like this:
VOCABULARY
der Abend—The evening (no doubt a relation of
Abou Ben)
die Dame—The lady (this one's important)
das—that
dich—(Acc.) you
die Frau—the wife (important also)
qesehen habe—to see (one of the past forms)
qestern—yesterday (in this case better trans-;
lated as "last")
ich—l (a handy word to now)
kein—no, as in "Ya, wir haben keine bananas." i
mein—my (mein gosh)
mit—with
war—was (past of sein in case you're interested)
wer—who, as in "Wer me?" "Nein, you."
Somewhere in the third act there will be a
gag like:
Mr. Bones: Ah met my gal in a department store.
Rastus: Dat's where Adam an' Eve met.
Mr. Bones: You is crazy.
Rastus: I ain't crazy, Adam met Eve at a ribbon
counter.
Then hit them with:
Herr Knocken: Wer war die Dame mit der ich
dich qestern abend qesehen habe?
Herr Rastus: Das war keine Dame, das war meine
Frau.
It would be novel to say the least.
