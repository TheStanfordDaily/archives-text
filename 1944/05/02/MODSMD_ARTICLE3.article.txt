# Mist Clouds To Envelop Dream Dance
## 
### 
''Couples will find themselves
dreamily dancing among pastel
tinted clouds this Saturday night â€”
or so we hope," stated Norma Tre
vorrow, head of decorations for the
Roble, Lagunita, Union formal.
The clouds will be CO-; the pastel
coloring, the floodlights. The dream
will be the Spring Dream theme of
"Lady in the Dark."
The $1.80 bids are on sale to the
entire student body. Tickets may be
purchased in the A.S.S.U. office and
from representatives in Ventura,
Roble, Union, and Lagunita.
Art Wiedner's band, the biggest
"little-name" organization in the
area, will play for the dance. The
bandstand will be transformed into
an enormous cage. This will repre
sent the circus part of the theme.
Two horses with riders will adorn
either side of the cage. One rider will
be a lovely circus ballet dancer; the
other will be "Lady in the Dark"
herself.
"Allur," the magazine of "Lady in
the Dark," will represent the three
hostesses of the formal. "L" will
designate Lagunita; "U," Union, and
"R," Roble.
Mystical South American perfume
will permeate the air, canaries will
sing over the microphones, and im
mense tiger lilies will bloom in the
fantastic garden of the Spring Dream.
A bird cage seven feet in diameter
and a 12-foot, three-layer wedding
cake will hang from the opposite
sides of the ceiling.
Woodpecker Lodge behind the
Quad office will be the scene of much
committee work on decorations every
day ihis week.
All committee chairmen for the
"Lady in the Dark" formal will meet
at 6:45 tonight in the Women's Club
house.
