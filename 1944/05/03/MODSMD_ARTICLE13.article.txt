# WHY NOT RUN A RACE?
## 
### 
ANY STUDENT who feels competent enough
to hold one of the A.S.S.U. offices is not com
pelled at Stanford, by complex party machinery,
to qualify on the basis of political merit for the
privilege of running in an election. He or she
can, by a personal interview with the nominating
committee, qualify to run for one of the many
positions to be filled electorally in the election
a week from today.
Perhaps a student feels qualified to run for
the office of student body president. He does
not have to be nominated by someone else; he
can nominate himself. In determining his quali
fications there is no necessity for political shy
ness merely because he has never before par
ticipated in school government.
A man must be capable in order to represent
the student body of Stanford University; it is
an important post, and it can be of great im
portance in the development of student govern
ment and democracy. The man should have a
knowledge of current affairs, of the significant
influences forming the shape of things to come
—not only in education, but in the way of life
for youth.
There are men on the Farm who could qualify,
there are women who could qualify, but for
some reason these people hesitate to run, or to
appear before the nominating committee.
An ex-serviceman for instance, who would
certainly have a knowledge of the effect of war
on college men of his age, might hesitate to
run because he felt that no good purpose would
be served.
To fill the need is to serve the purpose, and
no one therefore, should hesitate to run a race.
