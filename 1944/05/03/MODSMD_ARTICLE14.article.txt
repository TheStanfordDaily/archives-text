# Views on Your War

### Hayes Hunter 
LAST NIGHT we sat down and listened to Radio
Tokyo. Some of the mis-truths, half truths, lies
and just plain prevarications that issued from
Japan were amazing.
The most startling of all was the manner in
which it was presented. We have heard the
Japanese were copyists body and soul, we knew
a few Japanese, but last night enlightened us.
One woman announcer (sounded suspiciously
like Tokyo Rose) gave a commentary and just
general talk about our present difficulty with
Japan.
She began her story by saying that Japan was
not a warring nation and that Japan was op
pressed to the saturation point by the western
nations.
She went on to say that America entered the
war shortly after President Roosevelt and Prime
Minister Winston Churchill had made a pledge
of no further aggrandizement. The Jap female
commentator then added that we had sent troops
to Iceland to begin our imperialistic career be
fore the war.
She said—and these verv words are hers—

"the nations of the Greater East Asia Co-Pros
perity sphere only desire to raise their children
in freedom from want and freedom from fear."
Her whole point consisted of trying to make !
it look like the United States entered the war to
oppress the Asiatics and that Japan now is
fighting a noble battle — trying to save the
Orientals as a whole—the Chinese too—from
American imperialism.
A beautiful example of what a misstatement
or loose mouth by one of our higher-ups will do
was brought out by Radio Tokyo also last night.
Lieutenant General George Patton — "Old
Blood and Guts"—recently made a statement in
England that the United States, Britain, and
Russia would be the dominating nations in world
affairs for many years to come. The way in
which Patton made the statement gave the idea
that the Big Three were going to walk in and
take over in a very unsubtfe fashion.
Tokyo Radio got hold of the statement—as
much as the OWI and radio attempted to sup
press just such a thing and is now harping on
the subject. The inevitable consequence re
sulted.
The Jap propagandists are sitting in Tokyo— {
and much to our chagrin—are saying, "You ;
see, nations of Asia—the United States and
Britain are imperialists and they will walk into :
your countries and oppress you. Asia for the j
Asiatics!"
While the statement only represents General 1
Patton's point of view, Tokyo twists it enough to
make it look like he was speaking for the U.S. j
and England as a whole. Secretary of War
Stimson has said the statement does not repre-,
sent the United States Army or the United States,
the Japs are passing it off as the gospel truth
to the Asiatics. Because of the widespread illit
eracy in the Far East, it is believed to be the
gospel truth. That is the express danger in not
guarding your statements. Such is the use of
propaganda.
