### ROGER CORMAN 
As most of the teams have probably
found out the hard \yay, the best
length for mural softball games is
five innings. Anything shorter is out
of the question, and anything longer
tends to make the ball seem like a
dark blur against a darkening sky.
A few games of seven innings have
been played, but they weren't notable
for their success. Along about the
end of the sixth it's just too dark to
do more than guess at the position of
the ball. Nobody that we know of
has tried the reglation nine innings,
which would be good for laughs, ii
nothing else.
Although five innings is about right
for this time of year, later in the
season it will probably be better to
play seven-inning battles.
Talking of later in the season, it's
been suggested that there be a play
off between the civilian chaiVips and
the champs of the army leagues.
This is a plenty good idea, and would
keep the halls fighting light down to
the last cilt.
The play-off for the University
basketball title last quarter was a
huge success, and the baseball title
game could be just as big an attrac
tion. These championship games at
the end of the quarter are about the
only kind of sport left at the Farm
with any spectator interest, and if
handled right are almost sure to be
successful.
