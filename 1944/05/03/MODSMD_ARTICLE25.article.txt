# Quad To Feature Events Of Year, Shots of Farm
## 
### LISA EBBERTS 
Stanford has had an eventful year. It began with a new president and
the tramp of army feet, and went on with the visit of royalty and bloody
bicycle accidents on the Quad. These are only a lew ol Stanford's many
fast-moving events.
The average Stanford student has had a hard time keeping up with the

rapid changes about him, and so will*
welcome with relief the publication
j which comes to bring him up to date,
the '44 Quad.
Quad Moves
The new Quad has moved just as
; fast as the rest of the campus and
j this year brings more new features
| than ever before. Many a campus
■ beauty will be pictured at her daily
J occupations, and the war work to
which she has given so much time.
Eighteen pages of candid shots will
; bring back memories of our 3,000
; soldiers, and will bring to life many
la familiar pose at the Boathouse and
| on Quad. Pictures of picnics, and bi
cycle rides too, will bring back nos
talgic memories—of poison oak.
The Quad is later than usual this
| year and is therefore covering the
: very latest developments. Last -m in -
! ute pictures have been taken of the
j Sadie Hawkins dance and receding
Lake Lagunita, and special space is
I being saved for the coming Spring
| Sing.
Besides these, there will be innum-
I erable other regular and new fea-
I tures.
Heroic Quad
Only by heroic efforts has the
I Quad been able to bring all these
i features, for along with the other
' changes, it has felt the wartime scar
| cities.
In the face of a drastic film short
i age, the Quad is bringing more good
| pictures than ever. Its photographers,
I Bill Hyer and Bob Lamar, have
J tramped from*the goif course and the
i boathouse to every part of the cam
| pus, and have covered every situa
; tion.
Poor Paper Situation
j This year the specially treated
; paper that the Quad uses has been
I practically non-existent, and so in
one way the Quad has had to set
limits, not in quality, but in quantity.
The number printed will have to
, be ruled by supply rather than de
; mand. Only a set number of volumes

can go to pi'ess, and so those who
fail to order their copies in time will
have to go without.
