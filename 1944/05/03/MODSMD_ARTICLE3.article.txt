j leadership in every office.
"Formerly the committee has fune-
I tioned only for women and for all

"Nominating Committee does not
send out requests for the appearance

the number of candidates or dis
courage anyone to petition for office.

tion for the office in which you are
interested. There will be no phone
calls or notes to prospective candi
