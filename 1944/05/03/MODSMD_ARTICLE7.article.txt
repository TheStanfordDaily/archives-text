# USO Course To Present Talk On Postwar Maladjustment
## 
### 
The USO course, given summer and autumn quarters, will be sponsored
again this quarter by the Y.W.C.A.- in conjunction with the War Board,
according to Nancy Banning, War Board representative and "Y" secretary.
Miss Banning and Dickie Shainwald, co-chairmen, announce the first meet
ing of the new series, set for Friday afternoon at 1 p.m.

♦ This quarter's presentation will be
broader in its scope than courses
given previously; and those who
would be interested in repeating the
course are invited to do so.
Capt. Brown Will Speak
Of particular interest will be the
first talk: Captain Brown, a veteran
of World War I, will speak on the
mental attitudes and maladjustments
of men returning from the fronts. He
will give advice to the audience on
how to understand and handle these
men, and how to tell if they are
actually ill.
Psychiatrists have formerly given
talks on this subject to those taking
the course, but Miss Banning ex
' pressed the hope that the first-hand
experience of Captain Brown would
make his speech particularly inter
esting.' He has been doing extensive
research for the talk to supplement
; his personal experiences.
I If business allows, Colonel Eden,
I commander of this post, will intro
duce Captain Brown. Miss Banning
1 emphasized the fact that this lecture
j is open to all women on the campus,
! and should be of essential interest to
all.
Friday Afternoon Programs
I All programs for the quarter are
scheduled for Friday afternoons,
from 1 to 2 p.m., in a room in the
! Women's Clubhouse to be announced
later. There will be four lectures and
! although they will deal with subjects
beyond the realm of actual USO
work, USO certificates will be grant
ed as before. Women who missed one
of the series when it was given au
tumn quarter are invited to attend
that lecture, so that they may receive
the certificates.
Junior Hostess Lecture
The lecture set for May 12 will be
strictly USO in topic — manners,
! dress, and rules of junior hostesses.
| Miss Banning said that a representa
: live from Sun Francisco's Stage, Door
| Canteen will be present if possible.
On May 19 Mrs. Eden, wife of
Colonel Eden, will tell of her experi
i ences in work similar to the USO's
I during the last war, and of methods
j they found the most efficient in can
' teen work.
