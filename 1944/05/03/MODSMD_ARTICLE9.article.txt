U.S. PACIFIC FLEET HEAD
QUARTERS. PEARL HARBOR
(UP) —A giant United States task
force, in a triple-spearhead attack
has destroyed 12G Japanese planes
and spread ruin through ground in
stallations in a three-day operation
against Truk, Satawan, and Ponape
islands in the Carolines, it was an
nounced today.
Guns of battleships and cruisers
added their weight to the bombs of
the carrier-borne planes which car
ried out the operations — of such
magnitude, a Japanese broadcast re
vealed, that the enemy feared an
actual invasion of the Carolines was
imminent.
In the first day of the operation
alone 125 enemy planes were de
stroyed — 60 in air combat, GO
aground, and 5 by the guns of the
warships. By the second day the
Japanese air force had been all but
wiped from the sky or crushed on its
own airdromes, ancf only one enemy
plane rose in challenge. It was blown
to bits.
No american ship was even dam
aged in the entire three days, Adn:
Chester W. Nimitz announced in his
communique revealing the raid, and
Nimitz said that aircraft losses were
light, though he listed about 30 fligh-,
personnel as missing.
