# CATCH-ALL COMMITTEE
## 
### 
NOMINATING COMMITTEE, composed of
both men and women students, begins to func
tion today from 9 to 12â€”the men in the Nitery,
and the women in the Excom room in Old
Union.
This committee is a sort of catch-all. It
answers questions, it will interview persons for
all offices, and it leaves the rest up to the
students.
This committee will meet and make sure that
at least one good candidate will run on each
ballot; if you're interested in running for an
office in particular or even if you're just inter
ested in any office that will enable you to have
a direct say in running student government,
talk to the members of this committee.
Candidates placed on the ballot by nominat
ing committee are in no way distinguished from
candidates put up by petition on Monday. And
neither are certain persons contacted by the
committee and urged to run for office as some
students think.
The committee is merely a group of men and
women students interested in seeing that high
standards in student government are main
tained; they are interested in interviewing any
one who has that same ambition.
And sometimes a large number of students
appears before the committee, each wanting to
run for a particular office. In that case, the
committee chooses only a few.
Should you be one of those not put on the
ballot by the committee, remember that candi
dates may be petitioned to run on Monday.
