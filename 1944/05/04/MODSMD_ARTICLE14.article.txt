Did you ever stop to consider the difficulty
facing invading troops —such as the Allies in
the next few weeks. First and foremost is the
new and deadly electronic fingers of radar. By
the use of high frequency bombardment it
locates objects instaneously.
All the invasion coasts from the tip of Norway
on the north to the Bay of Biscay on the south
are alert. All radar stations are under con
stant vigilance patrolling the seaward side—
supposedly the invasion side—looking for the
first indication of an invasion. They will pos
sibly know of the invasion long before the
Allies hit the beach.
COUNTER-WEAPON
On the other hand, the Allies may have some
trick up their sleeve for neutralizing radar, but
in most cases it will do well to take radar loca
tion into account. Surprise, therefore, will not
be a main element in the invasion.
There are many dangers that face the invad
ing soldier before he hits the beach. If radar is
a factor to be considered, then it is likely to
expected aerial bombardment long before the in
vasion point is sighted. No matter how good an
aerial protective covering may be, when a man's
country is being invaded and his life is at stake
he is going to wreak the most damage possible.

It is likely therefore to expect some planes to
get through and bomb the invaders.
HEAVY ARTILLERY
The Germans have had time in three years to
arm all this coast well with large seacoast artil
lery—such as guns that throw two-ton projec
tiles for a distance of 22 miles. Every once in a
while you hear about the Germans and the
British having a cross channel duel with these
big babies.
In spite of the fact that these big guns can be
neutralized by heavy bombing, many of them
will go untouched and those remaining will
prove a definite menace to invading boats.
COAST DEFENSES
After the forces have passed these three
menaces, it will then be up to the soldier to
carry on from there. The individual soldier
faces such things as machine-gun fire, rifle fire,
mortar fire—this can be mean—strafing, flame
throwers, mine fields, grenades, barbed wire,
and all sorts of strange devices designed to im
pede the forward progress of the invading troop.
Then falling in the ranks of military science
and tactics, the Germans have many methods of
troop movement and shifting to halt the progress
of the Allies. Not a pretty picture is it, when
you think in terms of your friends?

a factor to be considered, then it is likely to
expected aerial bombardment long before the in
vasion point is sighted. No matter how good an
aerial protective covering may be, when a man's
country is being invaded and his life is at stake
he is going to wreak the most damage possible.

It is likely therefore to expect some planes to
get through and bomb the invaders.
HEAVY ARTILLERY
The Germans have had time in three years to
arm all this coast well with large seacoast artil
lery—such as guns that throw two-ton projec
tiles for a distance of 22 miles. Every once in a
while you hear about the Germans and the
British having a cross channel duel with these
big babies.
In spite of the fact that these big guns can be
neutralized by heavy bombing, many of them
will go untouched and those remaining will
prove a definite menace to invading boats.
COAST DEFENSES
After the forces have passed these three
menaces, it will then be up to the soldier to
carry on from there. The individual soldier
faces such things as machine-gun fire, rifle fire,
mortar fire—this can be mean—strafing, flame
throwers, mine fields, grenades, barbed wire,
and all sorts of strange devices designed to im
pede the forward progress of the invading troop.
Then falling in the ranks of military science
and tactics, the Germans have many methods of
troop movement and shifting to halt the progress
of the Allies. Not a pretty picture is it, when
you think in terms of your friends?
Did you ever stop to consider the difficulty
facing invading troops —such as the Allies in
the next few weeks. First and foremost is the
new and deadly electronic fingers of radar. By
the use of high frequency bombardment it
locates objects instaneously.
All the invasion coasts from the tip of Norway
on the north to the Bay of Biscay on the south
are alert. All radar stations are under con
stant vigilance patrolling the seaward side—
supposedly the invasion side—looking for the
first indication of an invasion. They will pos
sibly know of the invasion long before the
Allies hit the beach.
COUNTER-WEAPON
On the other hand, the Allies may have some
trick up their sleeve for neutralizing radar, but
in most cases it will do well to take radar loca
tion into account. Surprise, therefore, will not
be a main element in the invasion.
There are many dangers that face the invad
ing soldier before he hits the beach. If radar is
a factor to be considered, then it is likely to
expected aerial bombardment long before the in
vasion point is sighted. No matter how good an
aerial protective covering may be, when a man's
country is being invaded and his life is at stake
he is going to wreak the most damage possible.
