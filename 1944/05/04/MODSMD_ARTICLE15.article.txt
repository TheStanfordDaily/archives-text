Were you ever walking down Quad and then,
suddenly stop to think about the dangers facing
invading troops? Naturally the Jirst thing you
think about is the deadly Detecto-magno Ray.'
Experts claim this ray can detect a flea on a
dog's back at 11 miles.
Unfortunately the Germans have Detecto
magno Ray stations up and down the invasion
coast. However, fortunately for us, w r e have a
Counterdetecto-magno Ray which neutralizes
the German weapon, but on the other hand, the
Germans have a Countercounterdetecto-magno |
Ray which neutralizes our weapon.
SUPER-COUNTER WEAPON
But don't think the Allies are napping, for we j
have a ray which neutralizes all the German
rays, and as all the rays neutralize each other,
the Detecto-magno Ray will be a negative factor
in the invasion.
Nevertheless, the Germans will probably!
know of the invasion long before the invading
troops land. The Allies will likely send com
plete plans for the invasion, through a neutral
source, to the Germans, and they in turn will
j courteously return the favor by sending us
! complete plans of the implacements on the
i coast. Surprise will not be an important element
in the invasion.
If the Germans know of our coming, our
troops can expect aerial bombardment. Many
military experts are of the opinion that this new
weapon will revolutionize warfare, and so, since
the Germans do not want us to land, it is en
tirely in the realm of possibility that they may :
j drop a few bombs here and there.
SUPER-HEAVY ARTILLERY
The Germans have large quantities of heavy
artillery on the invasion coast, but we don't
have to worry, because our bombers can neu
tralize them easily. On the other hand, German
anti-aircraft guns may neutralize our bombers, i
but we can neutralize the anti-aircraft guns with'
naval bombardment. The Navy could be neu
tralized by Nazi submarines which can be
neutralized by allied mine fields, which can be
neutralize dby German minesweepers which 1
can be neutralized by allied mosquito boats.
SUPER COAST DEFENSES
Therefore we predict that the invasion will
be a 100 per cent mosquito boat operation. Of
course if the Germans get wind of this they will
line the coast with mosquito netting, and we'll
be back where we started until we can think
of an effective way to combat that weapon.
Think of the coast of France lined with
! mosquito netting. Doesn't it make a pretty
j picture?

SUPER COAST DEFENSES
Therefore we predict that the invasion will
be a 100 per cent mosquito boat operation. Of
course if the Germans get wind of this they will
line the coast with mosquito netting, and we'll
be back where we started until we can think
of an effective way to combat that weapon.
Think of the coast of France lined with
! mosquito netting. Doesn't it make a pretty
j picture?
Were you ever walking down Quad and then,
suddenly stop to think about the dangers facing
invading troops? Naturally the Jirst thing you
think about is the deadly Detecto-magno Ray.'
Experts claim this ray can detect a flea on a
dog's back at 11 miles.
Unfortunately the Germans have Detecto
magno Ray stations up and down the invasion
coast. However, fortunately for us, w r e have a
Counterdetecto-magno Ray which neutralizes
the German weapon, but on the other hand, the
Germans have a Countercounterdetecto-magno |
Ray which neutralizes our weapon.
SUPER-COUNTER WEAPON
But don't think the Allies are napping, for we j
have a ray which neutralizes all the German
rays, and as all the rays neutralize each other,
the Detecto-magno Ray will be a negative factor
in the invasion.
Nevertheless, the Germans will probably!
know of the invasion long before the invading
troops land. The Allies will likely send com
plete plans for the invasion, through a neutral
source, to the Germans, and they in turn will
j courteously return the favor by sending us
! complete plans of the implacements on the
i coast. Surprise will not be an important element
in the invasion.
If the Germans know of our coming, our
troops can expect aerial bombardment. Many
military experts are of the opinion that this new
weapon will revolutionize warfare, and so, since
the Germans do not want us to land, it is en
tirely in the realm of possibility that they may :
j drop a few bombs here and there.
SUPER-HEAVY ARTILLERY
The Germans have large quantities of heavy
artillery on the invasion coast, but we don't
have to worry, because our bombers can neu
tralize them easily. On the other hand, German
anti-aircraft guns may neutralize our bombers, i
but we can neutralize the anti-aircraft guns with'
naval bombardment. The Navy could be neu
tralized by Nazi submarines which can be
neutralized by allied mine fields, which can be
neutralize dby German minesweepers which 1
can be neutralized by allied mosquito boats.
