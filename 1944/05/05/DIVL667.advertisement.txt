00** GOVERNOR
v EARL
WAR R E N
JUDGE DEL MUTOLO
I am of the opinion that no man should aspire to the
bench unless he can run the gauntlet of his own profession
cannot come through after an investigation by his own
profession as being qualified for the bench. —Gov. Earl War
ren.
Superior Judge Del Mutolo has "run the gauntlet of his own
profession.' He was endorsed by the Santa Clara Conuty Bar
Association as the man best qualified for the position of Su
perior Judge and merits the support of the citizens of Santa
Clara County.
