# THE 						HUNT BEGINS
## 
### 
Nominating committee meets for the last time today from 2
to sâ€”women in the Excom room in Old Union, and men in the
Nitery. If you are concerned with student government and if
you want to be able to take an active part in it, you'll want to
talk with this committee.
But should you be one of those who is not concerned with
actively taking part in government as an officer and yet you are
concerned with making sure that capable persons serve in such
positions, Monday is the day for you to function.
The day for petitioning is Monday, and that means that every
Stanford student who considers himself a citizen of Stanford
as well as a student will begin thinking today about the persons
he'd like to see run for office. If, at first glance, you can think
of no one, think some more, look around, and talk around. You'll
be a lot happier later.
