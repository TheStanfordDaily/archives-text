# Views on Your War

We have been asked by some for the pertinent data concern
ing foreign broadcasts. Here are some of the facts that have
come by way of information, experience and just plain fooling
around with shortwave broadcasts all night long—much to the
disgust of a long list of roommates.
The German broadcasting system does broadcast nightly but
it is unable to be heard on the Pacific Coast due to local interfer
ence from other stations and static during their broadcast period.
The Italian stations may be able to be heard, as well as some of
the Nazi-controlled French stations. Before the war, these sta
tions were among the most powerful shortwave stations in the
world. The only difficulty is that most of us are up at the lake
or in lab during the broadcast period of the European shortwave
stations.
Reception Poor
A second factor enters the picture. Broadcast reception is
not too good during the afternoon due to a raft of technical
reasons.
The British Broadcasting Corporation broadcasts consistently
night and day, changing its frequencies to suit the atmospheric
conditions. Britain can be heard in this area in the morning with
great clarity. They usually have some typical British humor on
the air, which is hard to understand.
In the early evening after you have enjoyed a pleasurable
dinner—it is usually time to sit down and listen to Moscow.
Moscow Radio
Radio Center Moscow comes on the air at 7:15 p.m. PWT
and broadcasts for an hour and a half. The broadcast usually
consists of news and music and some running commentaries.
Russia broadcasts on 15,230 kilocycles or 15.23 megacycles
and has broadcast on this band for the last two years. They
have a large transmitter on the Pacific coast of Siberia and can
be heard in and about the West- with great clarity. A woman
handles the news and commentary and would be a pleasure to
listen to for a speech and drama professor.
Tokyo Radio
Radio Tokyo sounds like it is in our backyard. They broad
cast nightly and are quite nomadic about their choice of fre
quencies. They usually crowd Russia off the dial about the
time Moscow signs off because the crafty Nipponese know
people in the United States listen consistently to Russia.
Tokyo broadcasts on 15.23 megacycles and 11.2-11.7 mega
cycles in addition to its morning frequency of 9.5 megacycles.
