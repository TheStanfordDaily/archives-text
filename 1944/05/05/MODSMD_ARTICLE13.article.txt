## RAF, Yank Bombers Hit Invasion Coast 
### 
LONDON, May 4 (UP). —Eight
j hundred RAF bombers struck a
j massive 2,240-ton blow against en
j emy anti-invasion depots in France
last night, disrupting Nazi munitions,
tanks, trucks, and troop concentra
tions massing behind the Atlantic
Wall, and today U.S. Flying Fort
resses carried forward the pre-inva
sion air offensive by smashing an
airfield in Holland.
Striking vital German nerve cen
ters, the RAF night raid stunned the
Luftwaffe into violent reaction. The
liercest air battle in weeks devel
oped over France, and the RAF lost
49 planes.
A few hours later, Italy - based
! RAF heavies and medium bombers
roared across the Balkans to ham
mer the big railyards at Bucharest,
capital of Romania, in a pre-dawn
attack in support of the Russian ar
mies. The Red Army is regrouping,
its forces for a new offensive which
it is believed will be synchronized
with the Anglo-American defense
on western Europe.
Indicating new Britain- and Italy
based RAF night operations, the
Stuttgart and Frankfort radios left
the air tonight, warning of Allied
planes over western Germany, while
in the south, the Vienna, Bratislava
and Budapest stations also ceased
broadcasting "because of approach
ing enemy aircraft."
