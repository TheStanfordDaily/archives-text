# Stanford Women Will Entertain WAVES At Spring Sing' Naranja Get-Together
## 
### 
In an effort to give the WAVES
stationed both at Moffett Field and
in San Francisco a chance for rest
and recreation over the weekends,
Women's Conference is cooperating
with Jeannette Grimsley, social co
ordinator of the War Board, in a
project to invite WAVES to spend
their weekends at various living
groups here at Stanford as guests of
the women students.
The first contingent of 24 WAVES
to initiate this experiment will ar
rive tonight to attend the Spring
Sing and to be the guests of honor at
& get-together in the social room of
Casa Naranja immediately after the
sing, according to Marion Nielsen,
chairman of Women's Conference.
All women who are interested in
having WAVES as guests at some
time in the future or whn are inter
ested in meeting them are cordially
invited to .■attend.
Arrive May t.'J
The first group to spend the week
end will arrive May 13; women who
want to act as hostesses for them are
asked to sign up in the War Board
as- soon as possible.
As part of the plan to meet and
know these WAVES, a group of
women students, representatives of
the various living groups and wom
en's associations on campus, jour
neyed to Moffett Field last Friday
afternoon for a tour of the base under
the direction of Ensign Dorothy
Courtney, recreation officer for the
women there.
Sec WAVES Work
The students were taken to various
offices and stations where the
WAVES work. At the weather con
trol tower they watched WAVES
taking weather reports from all parts
of the country on the teletype ma
chine, and compiling local weather
forecasts with the aid of a compli
cated system of maps and instru
ments.
They next went to the huge blimp
hangar inside of which were four
blimps, several planes, and a few
buildings scattered along the side —
and with plenty of room to spare.
There they were shown a demonstra
tion of a Link Trainer, a fixed ma
chine which teaches pilots to fly by
instruments; the instructor in charge
of the trainer is a WAVE.
Staff Officers
From there the visitors were taken
to the office in which a record is
kept of every plane and blimp that
goes out —its pilot, crew, destination,
scheduled time of departure and ar
rival, and a report on the prevailing
flying conditions. This office was
staffed entirely by WAVES. A navy
pilot, veteran of several campaigns
to judge by the ribbons on his tunic,
took the group out to the runway
where he pointed out several types
of planes now being used in active
combat service all over the globe, in
cluding a secret type, the nature of
which cannot be revealed.
Later the guests saw the radio con

trol office where all radio messages
from planes and blimps on flights are
received; WAVES handle a good
part of the work there.
Visit Women's Barracks
Adjoining it is the radio repair
office, now staffed entirely by men;
but a detachment of WAVES ex

pected soon will replace them for
active duty.
The next stop was at the personnel
office where names and rank of all
personnel at Moffett are filed; it is
through this office that WAVES ap
ply for higher rating or for a trans-
I fer of duty.

As a climax to the journey, the
Stanford representatives were taken
on an inspection tour of the enlisted
women's barracks, followed by a tea
in the WAVES' social room during
| which they had a chance to meet ;md
j talk to many of the women who will
; be visiting Stanford in the near fu
ture.
Play Baseball
All the WAVES were anxious to
1 visit Stanford and to have a chanc-e
to try out their newly organized
| baseball team against one of Stan
! ford's. The outstanding ambition of
I all of them, however, is to ride a

bike! Next in order of their desires
ax'e to rest, swim, and read.
Stanford women who made the
trip were: Sally Breuner, Kappa
Kappa Gamma; Jeannette Grimsley,
War Board; Margaret Meadowcvoft
and Sally Stevens, Roble; Pat Charl
