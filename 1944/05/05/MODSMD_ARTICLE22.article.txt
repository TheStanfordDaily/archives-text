# Excom Approves Home Labor Day
## 
### 
Stanford students will celebrate
Labor Day by four hours or more of
hard work at the Con Home, A.S.S.U.
President Dick Driscoll announced
after a decision by Excom to recom
mend to the Committee on Public
Exercises that all classes, except
those under government contract,
be dismissed at 2 o'clock in order
to aid the Con Home drive.
The gardening, painting, cleaning,
sawing, and hammering will repre
sent only one phase of the entire
week of Con Home Drive, although
the traditional ' Back to the Farm
Day," in which students formerly
dressed in old clothes, jeans, or plaid
shirts, or costumes reminiscent of
the Gay 90's will not be celebrated
at the recommendation of Cardinals.
Discussion of the question was
controversial, for although Cardinals
explained that it was felt student
energy could best be diverted into a
more useful channel, a number of
Excommittee members were of the
opinion that "Back to the Farm"
would not be wasted effort, but
rather would stimulate interest in
the Con Home drive itself. Ap
proval of Cardinal minutes, which
included the recommendation to
abandon "Back to the Farm Day,"
automatically cancelled the plan.
