# Carillon Concert Features Medley
## 
### 
The Saturday noon carillon con
cert, played by James Lawson, will
be a medley of national folk tunes.
It will include: "Lock Lomond,"
"Cielito Lindo," "O Tannenbaum,"
"When Love Is Kind," and "Nos
Galen."
Sunday there will be a demonstra
tion of English change ringing at
1:30. In this the carillonneur uses
only four bells (C, D, E, and F) and
plays every possible combination of
the four. In contrast he will play a
Belgian carillon composition, "Pre
ludium for Beiard," by Jef Van Hoof.
Also on the Sunday program are:
"Who Is Sylvia?" by Franz Schubert,
"Berceuse" from Jocelyn by Godard,
"Summertime" by George Gershwin,
and excerpts from "A Day in Ven
ice," by Nevin.
