# Mize Chairmans Senior Exercises
## 
### 
Marge Mize, vice-president of the
senior class, was selected as chairman
of senior exercises last night at Ex
com meeting. This year there will
be no Senior Ball, and consequently
the chairman will be occupied with
the job of finding a substitute affair.
No officers, such as valedictorian,
have as yet been chosen for the
Commencement Day exercises. Also,
no graduation, announcements have
been ordered since the size of the
graduating class is not known.
