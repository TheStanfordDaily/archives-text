As intramural softball swung into
its fourth round yesterday afternoon,
four teams could have claimed the
title of "top league crown contend
er." Among these top lour of Stan
ford's local baseball league we may
mention the Firehouse, Med School,
Monroe, and Hayes Hall. All four
•lubs are gifted with better than
jerage pitchers. And after all,
what is it that makes a softball team
tood?—its pitcher. If the hurler can
get the man at the plate to hit the
ball into the hands of his teammates
in back of him (the pitcher) it is
just a matter of formality to throw
the ball to first, or catch the fly.
Hardball takes on a different angle
entirely where the ball comes fast
and hard and takes an expert to
handle it.
Probably the outstanding pitcher
of these four teams is Joe Sher, who
is currently appearing with the Mon
roe outfit. The boy must have some
thing on the ball that is extra—well
leave it there—for in the two games
that he has hurled, he has struck out
35 batters, and has allowed no hits
and no runs—top that one.
Just a hair behind Sher in the
pitching parade we run up against
Luke Pitts who performs for the
Firehouse. Although Pitts hasn't
quite as much on the ball as Sher
possesses, he has much more con
trol. He is the most consistent pitch
er in the league by far. In the pitch
ing duel between Sher and Pitts,
when the Firehouse played Monroe,
Pitts allowed no hits and no runs,
making it a no hit, no run game all
the way around. The final score was
obviously 0 to 0.
The Med School boasts a hurler by
the name of Wayne Price. He is
probably the only underhand curve
ball artist in the league and the only
r ood one seen in a long time. The
.ledics' pitcher has plenty of sup
port to back him up, too, so the team
has better than an even chance of
taking the league.
The pitcher belonging to the Hayes
Hall club is "Smokey" Bob Morrison,
who specializes in a well-controlled
fast ball. When it gets along about
the seventh inning in one of those
twilight games and the moon is just
coming out, it is difficult to see one
of Morison's pitches cross the plate,
lie has to whistle just as he lets go
of it, as a favor to the batter.
With these four hurlers battling
it out it looks as if it will be a fairly
tight league, but taking into consid
eration (he support which each
pitcher has, we'll venture a predic
tion that the Firehouse will emerge
victorious along about the end of
the season. »

of Morison's pitches cross the plate,
lie has to whistle just as he lets go

With these four hurlers battling

As intramural softball swung into
its fourth round yesterday afternoon,
four teams could have claimed the
title of "top league crown contend
er." Among these top lour of Stan
ford's local baseball league we may
mention the Firehouse, Med School,
Monroe, and Hayes Hall. All four
•lubs are gifted with better than
jerage pitchers. And after all,
what is it that makes a softball team
tood?—its pitcher. If the hurler can
get the man at the plate to hit the
ball into the hands of his teammates
in back of him (the pitcher) it is
just a matter of formality to throw
the ball to first, or catch the fly.
Hardball takes on a different angle
entirely where the ball comes fast
and hard and takes an expert to
handle it.
Probably the outstanding pitcher
of these four teams is Joe Sher, who
is currently appearing with the Mon
roe outfit. The boy must have some
thing on the ball that is extra—well
leave it there—for in the two games
that he has hurled, he has struck out
35 batters, and has allowed no hits
and no runs—top that one.
Just a hair behind Sher in the
pitching parade we run up against
Luke Pitts who performs for the
Firehouse. Although Pitts hasn't
quite as much on the ball as Sher
possesses, he has much more con
trol. He is the most consistent pitch
er in the league by far. In the pitch
ing duel between Sher and Pitts,
when the Firehouse played Monroe,
Pitts allowed no hits and no runs,
making it a no hit, no run game all
the way around. The final score was
obviously 0 to 0.
The Med School boasts a hurler by
the name of Wayne Price. He is
probably the only underhand curve
ball artist in the league and the only
r ood one seen in a long time. The
.ledics' pitcher has plenty of sup
port to back him up, too, so the team
has better than an even chance of
taking the league.
The pitcher belonging to the Hayes
Hall club is "Smokey" Bob Morrison,
who specializes in a well-controlled
fast ball. When it gets along about
the seventh inning in one of those
twilight games and the moon is just
coming out, it is difficult to see one
of Morison's pitches cross the plate,
lie has to whistle just as he lets go
of it, as a favor to the batter.
