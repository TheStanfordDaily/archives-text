# Meds Keep Lead, 8-5; Firehouse Wins
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
Undefeated Firehouse remained in
second place at the end of the fourth
round of intramural baseball yester
day, as the slugging fireboys wal
loped the McKinley Hall nine, 8 to 5.
Pitchers Ashley and Pitts combined
efforts to give the Firehouse its third
no-hit game of the season, as walks
and errors accounted for all five of
McKinley's runs.
The unstoppable Firehouse boys
were definitely not in form as far as
fielding went, numerous miscues
spoiling the otherwise perfect game.
Hero of the game for the Firehouse
was pitcher Ashley, who, in addition
to his five hitless innings pitched,
slammed out two home runs.
The powerful Med school nine re
mained in first place with four

| straight wins, hammering out an 8 1
to 5 win over the Lincoln boys in a j
j game that was close right up to the j
last innings. Lincoln held the lead
from the initial inning until the fifth, 1
I when the Navy boys drove in three j
( runs to take a G to 5 lead. Two more
runs in the next inning cinched the
victory. Fielding was good for both
| teams.
The Legal Eagles, dark horse at
! the beginning of the season, finally
broke into the win column yester
day, handing hapless Buchanan un
disputed possession of the cellar, 10
to 4. The lead see-sawed back and
j forth until the last inning, when a
barrage of hits and a number of er
rors, owing to the darkness, gave the
' Law School boys 7 runs and the
I game. Up to then fielding was ex

ceptional for both sides.
The fast-improving Garfield team
upset heavily favored Tyler, G to 2,
to take its second surprise victory in
a row.
