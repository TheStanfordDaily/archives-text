# Study Hours May Change
## 
### 
Good news for soldier-students
was released this week by the Army
Student Council. A study is under
way at Military Headquarters look
ing toward a rearrangement of eve
ning study hours whereby the study
periods on Wednesday and Friday
nights would be shortened.
The specific hours of free time have
not been definitely set, but clarifica
tion of that detail is expected shortly.
The study time lost on these nights
would be made up by increasing the
length of evening .study on the other
nights. The free time, if approved,
would be observed as quiet hours for
those men who remain in their quar
ters to study.
At the May 3 meeting of the ASC,
Glen Mitchel was elected chairman
of the Honor Code committee. Delay
on the part of section leaders in hold
ing and reporting honor code elec
tions caused the council to charge
:ts members with compiling and sub
mitting these reports.
Don Bluh announced that lessons
in dancing for soldiers will be given
at the Women's Clubhouse on Thurs
days from 2130 to 2230. Elementary
rumba and other modern dances will
be taught during the quarter.
Mike Donohue reported that the
athletic program has had only lim
ited success. The proposed soccer
league has failed to materialize be
cause of the difficulty in organizing
a sufficient number of teams to con
duct competition. The softball race
is suffering a similar fate since the
various teams do not all have physi
cal training periods in conjunction,
which would be necessary to sched
ule intramural competition. The reg
imental table tennis tourney is pro
gressing. The pairings have been
listed and several matches have al
ready been played.
Suggestions regarding a regimental
dance were put forward, and Lee
Welco and Alfred Swan were ap
pointed to investigate the possibility
of obtaining a dance orchestra for
the occasion.
Tom Fletcher reported that maga
zines are now on sale in the Encina
PX. Soldiers are urged the patronize
the PX when they wish magazines,
since the continuance of this service
will be based on sales response.
Efforts to arrange the opening of
biology and chemistry laboratories
for use in the evenings are being
favorably considered by the faculty.
As soon as definite word is received,
students will be notified of the hours
during which these facilities will be
available.
