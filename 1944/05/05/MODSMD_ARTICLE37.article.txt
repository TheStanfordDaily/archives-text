# BMOC's in Army Get Writeups Too!
## 
### 
Not many of the men at SCU 3905
know who their fellow students were
in civilian life. Let us, therefore,
introduce to some of the celeb
rities on campus.
First there is the man who gave
Sinatra the idea, Bob "Lover - ' Way
man. This soldier is renowned as the
man who looks al women once and
then must be very agile to catch
:hem as they swoon. It is said that
he has already made considerable
impression on the Stanford coeds.
One would never suspect Bob's pro
clivities on looking at him. He looks
like any other soldier, but beneath
that uniform is the heart of a Casa
nova.
Another distinguished soldier is
William "Moneybags" Stroud. This
is the man who creates dismay in
the lives of his fellow soldiers with
his lavish display of blondes, con
vertibles, and seven - passenger,
chauffeur-driven limousines.
These are but two of the large
number of important persons who
wear the khaki on campus. If you
would like further information on
Who's Who at SCU, keep your eyes
on the Army page. This news out
let regularly features the doings of
BMOC's and other "characters."'
