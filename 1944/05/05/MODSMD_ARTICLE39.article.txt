# Orchid of Week Goes To Member of ERC
## 
### 
This week's orchid goes to Glen
Mitchell. Glen represents the ERC
on the Army Student Council, is
an outstanding student and a con
genial fellow. Specifically, the sol
dier-students owe him a vote of
thanks for making possible the
regimental ping-pong tournament.
II was he who talked an officer at
the Presidio into giving us enough
halls to conduct the tourney. Since
that item is very scarce and can
he purchased only with a priority,
if at all, we flip Glen a snappy
highball.
