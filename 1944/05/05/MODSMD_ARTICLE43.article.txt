## 
### 
To the majority of Joes on campus this is an old story, but
to the boys in the ERC it is a recent, and at times, painful, memory. 1
guess no one can ever forget the experience of standing for the first time
between two ex-grease monkeys armd with G.I. duplicates of Alemite guns.
The torment ol it all remains. The ERC's just the other day went through

this enlightening procedure. OH
course they had ladies in white in
stead of the accustomed pigstickers,
j but it seems that even these women
have been hit with the army fervor.
Their morale unbolstered by cries
of "Watch the HOOK," they sub
i mitted with varying degrees of indif
: ference. That is, with the exception
! of one Sanford Marrian Dickey 111.
That gentleman required three hours
I of persuasion, not to take the shots,
j but to convince him that he was not
| entitled to the Purple Heart with an
Oak Leaf Cluster.
The day following they set out on
| a happy excursion to San Francisco
in quest of zoot suits with the reet
pleat. However, since the old models I
were unavailable they had to be con
tented with drape shapes in 10 col
ors, all brown. No, fellows, you can't
wear a Victory ribbon on that shirt
even if it has been through the last
way. The clothes came in the usual
G.I. sizes, too big and too small. (You
don't get tent pegs with those Mack,
they're your fatigues.) Several of
the boys got good fits due to the fact
that their sore arms prevented them [
J fromtrying on the togs.
Insucient experience with G.I.
shoes delaped a few at reveille the '
! next morning, but present reports j

well-placed skyhooks, finnegan pins,
and adjectives they have mastered

garb.
