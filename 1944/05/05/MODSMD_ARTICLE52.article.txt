"Physics as applied to athletics and
what influence physics will have on
future life" was the topic of the
weekly Buchanan forum held last
Wednesday night.
The discussion led by Dr. Kirk
patriek, professor of physics, de
scribed radar and television and told
ways each are used at present
<~id how they can be of use in the
future.
In discussing television Dr. Kirk
pa trick said that only persons in
direct line of a radio station could
use it. lie illustrated this point by
saying that a thousand stations could
branch from one of the San Fran
cisco hills, but people on the other
side of the coast range could not
share in the benefits.
In conclusion Dr. Kirkpatrick said
that in reality physics is nothing
more than plain common sense.
