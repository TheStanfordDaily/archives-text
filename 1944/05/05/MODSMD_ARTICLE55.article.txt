### 
Opening next Wednesday night at
8:30. the Stanford Players' produc
tion of A. A. Milne's play, "The
Truth about Blayds," has proven a
near sell-out attraction at the tick
et sales office, but tickets for per
formances on Wednesday, Thursday
and Monday evenings are still avail
able in limited numbers.
The play, set in the Gibson Girl
era, opens with 90th birthday cele
bration of the world - famed and
lauded poet, William Blayds. The
ensuing acts are concerned with the
events after the death of Blayds, and
the effects of his death-bed confes
sion.
The play has been done in London
and on the Continent and has been
popularized on the American radio
by actor Lionel Barrymore.
The part of Blayds will be played
by Lee Emerson Bassett, professor
emeritus of the speech and drama
department. F. Cowles Strickland,
assistant professor of the speech and
drama department and director of
the show, plays the effeminate son
in-law of Blayds, who is to
Blayds' flighty daughter Ku'ian,
portrayed by Moofie Faris.
Blayds' other daughter, Isofcel, who
has given up romance and a home
of her own to nurse him, is played
by Sally Stocker. The gi'anddaugh
ter and grandson are played by Mary
Lou Patton and Ed Maher. Parker,
the maid, is played by Hazel Spore,
and Norman Philbrick, assistant pro
fessor of the department, plays Iso
bel's beau.
