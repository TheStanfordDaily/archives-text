Holding its second national con
vention in New York City on the
weekend of May 5 to 7, the United
States Student Assembly will in
clude round tables on the community
at war, soldier reintegration into
college life, race relations, labor
unions, and the war on inflation with
discussions led by experts in each
field.
Several plenary sessions will be
held in conjunction with the Inter
national Student Assembly Confer
ence on Educational Reconstruction,
which is being conducted at the same
time, and the conference will include
a luncheon in honor of Mrs. Franklin
D. Roosevelt.
Among the other speakers will be
the Hon. Walter Nash, Minister of
New Zealand to the U.S.; Benjamin
Fine, Education Editor of the New
York Times; and James Carey, sec
retary-treasurer of the CIO.
As a national progressive student
organization, the U.S.S.A. concen
trates on stressing better race rela
tions in the towns, local programs
for inflation-control, war activities,
cooperation with labor unions, and
community activities.
Since its first conference in May
1943, the group has organized 31
chapters, holding six conferences
during the year.
While only U.S.S.A. chapters will
have voting power at the convention,
observers from non-affiliated col
leges are welcome, and all students
who plan to attend or groups who
wish to send delegates should write
the U.S.S.A. in New York City.
