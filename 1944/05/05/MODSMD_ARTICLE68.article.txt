women's society of Cap and Gown.
She was in fact one of four Stanford
girls who, sitting on a fence one fine
day in 1906 and discussing things in
general, decided that there should
be some group on campus whose
members were drawn from the lead
ers of all the different organizations
in which women worked for the
University.
This group it was which became
Cap and Gown and of which Miss
Mirrielees, as one of the original four,
is a charter member.
Graduated at Stanford in '07
Miss Mirrielees took her A.B. at
Stanford in 1907, and returned to
teach in 1909, and became a full
professor in 1939. Within the Uni
versity she has served at different
times as president of the Philological
Society, president of the Stanford
Chapter of Phi Beta Kappa ,and.
more recently, as a member of the
Executive Committee of the School
of Humanities.
