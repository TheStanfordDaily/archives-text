# Girls Help at Play House
## 
### 
A plea is being advanced to the
students of Stanford in an effort to
fulfill the needs of the Orchard Play
House, located near Castilleja, ac
cording to Sally McAllster. The
needs are many and the collectors
are "not particular."
The children at the school need old
toys, the playhouse itself lacks
sheets, towels, and other linen. Ac
cording to Miss McAllister, remnants
of sheets will be usable, and small
pieces of towels can be utilized as
washcloths.
The request is therefore made that
all students, if they have not the
materials for donation'at hand, write
home to their parents and ask for
suitable articles that may be lying
unused about the house.
Toys, whether thev are slightlv old.

j damaged, or even seemingly useless,
| are requested by the school. Farm
I men are being "conscripted" to re
| pair swings and other playground
equipment. Volunteers would be
more than welcome. Miss McAllister,
Jane Perham, and Florence Bailey
have been active in work at the
school and in organizing the drive.
Sign-up lists are in the War Board
office for women who are interested
in working at the Orchard School.
The director of the school is planning
a talk at the Women's Clubhouse,
and a dinner at Roble, in order to ac
quaint the women with the duties at
the school.
Hours spent at this activity are
j counted as war work. The primary
j duties of workers are the entertain-
I ment and care of the children â€”

dressing, feeding, and playing with
them. Signups should be made for
a two-hour period: 1:30 to 3:30 and
3:30 to 5:30 on weekdays.
The director would like some
women to volunteer to work briefly
after dinner some nights, bathing and
putting children to bed.
