# Dr. Carlson To Discuss Science as Service Topic
## 
### 
Dr. Anton J. Carlson, president of
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and one
of the country's most distinguished
scientists, will lecture at Stanford as
guest speaker of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, on May 9. His topic
will be "What Are the Questions
Science Cannot Answer, and Who
Can Answer Them?"
To be given under the auspices of
the Committee on Public Exercises,
in the auditorium of the Memorial
Hall at 7:30 p.m., the address will be
a response to the lecture given last
November by Mortimer J. Adler on
"Questions Science Cannot Answer."
The public is invited free of charge.
Dr. Carlson came to Stanford after
receiving the A.B. degree from Illi
nois' Augustana College to work
under the late Professor Oliver P.
Jenkins.
An assistant professor of physi
ology in Dr. Carlson's last year of
graduate study, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur remembers him as "an indefa
tigable worker who always showed
great skill and persistence." He was
known as "The Terrible Swede" and
"Ajax."
During his 38 years of brilliant
work at the University of Chicago
he was "a terror to his students,"
according to the Alumni Review.
They often grumbled that he "works
us like Swedes," but his graduate
students learned to appreciate it.
Dr. Carlson came from Sweden as
a poor immigrant in his teens. While
at Stanford he had to work for his
living, and in his last year he was
caretaker for the faculty clubhouse.
In the summers, he spent his time
working in the Pacific Grove labora
tories. During his three graduate
years, he also collaborated with Pro
fessor Jenkins and Professor (now
emeritus) Frank McFarland in the
writing of scientific papers. He re
ceived the Ph.D. degree in 1902 at
Stanford.
One of his initial studies at Stan
ford was concerned with the ner
vous impulse on the invertebrate.
This led to his later discovery of the
heart beat. While doing research on
the horseshoe crab, or Limulus, at
Woods Hole, Mass., he proved that
the heart beat originates in the
nerves.
Dr. Carlson's studies of the hu
man stomach are perhaps the best
known. For thirteen years he viewed
a man's stomach through a hole in
the stomach wall because the man's

esophagus was completely closed.
He also experimented with him
self in his studies, starving himself
several times in order to observe his
own stomach contractions.
Dr. Carlson is noted for his ver
satility as a scientist. His work has
covered a multitude of subjects such
as liver function, vitamin E. the re
lation between the thyroid and the
ovaries, effect of protein digestion
on the sex of rats, and the bacteri
cidal action of ozone.
"He is a strategist on biological
Campaigns," Time reported in 1941
at the time of his retirement from
Chicago. "His students have many
discoveries to their credit which
were given guidance and impetus by
Dr. Carlson."
He has contributed generously to
civic and humanitarian affairs. In
1920. Dr. Carlson became one of the
first Stanford graduates to be elected
to the National Academy of Sciences.
His many friends testify to his eager
ness to improve human conditions.
Since the last war when he was
a member of Herbert Hoover's re
habilitation gi-oup this has been true.
Dr. Carlson's abilities are varied:
he is a writer, lecturer, adviser, le
gal expert, organizer, executive, and
"plain fighter."

DR. A. J. CARLSON
Dr. Anton J. Carlson, president of
the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, and one
of the country's most distinguished
scientists, will lecture at Stanford as
guest speaker of the Tuesday Eve
ning Series, on May 9. His topic
will be "What Are the Questions
Science Cannot Answer, and Who
Can Answer Them?"
To be given under the auspices of
the Committee on Public Exercises,
in the auditorium of the Memorial
Hall at 7:30 p.m., the address will be
a response to the lecture given last
November by Mortimer J. Adler on
"Questions Science Cannot Answer."
The public is invited free of charge.
Dr. Carlson came to Stanford after
receiving the A.B. degree from Illi
nois' Augustana College to work
under the late Professor Oliver P.
Jenkins.
An assistant professor of physi
ology in Dr. Carlson's last year of
graduate study, Dr. Ray Lyman Wil
bur remembers him as "an indefa
tigable worker who always showed
great skill and persistence." He was
known as "The Terrible Swede" and
"Ajax."
During his 38 years of brilliant
work at the University of Chicago
he was "a terror to his students,"
according to the Alumni Review.
They often grumbled that he "works
us like Swedes," but his graduate
students learned to appreciate it.
Dr. Carlson came from Sweden as
a poor immigrant in his teens. While
at Stanford he had to work for his
living, and in his last year he was
caretaker for the faculty clubhouse.
In the summers, he spent his time
working in the Pacific Grove labora
tories. During his three graduate
years, he also collaborated with Pro
fessor Jenkins and Professor (now
emeritus) Frank McFarland in the
writing of scientific papers. He re
ceived the Ph.D. degree in 1902 at
Stanford.
One of his initial studies at Stan
ford was concerned with the ner
vous impulse on the invertebrate.
This led to his later discovery of the
heart beat. While doing research on
the horseshoe crab, or Limulus, at
Woods Hole, Mass., he proved that
the heart beat originates in the
nerves.
Dr. Carlson's studies of the hu
man stomach are perhaps the best
known. For thirteen years he viewed
a man's stomach through a hole in
the stomach wall because the man's

esophagus was completely closed.
He also experimented with him
self in his studies, starving himself
several times in order to observe his
own stomach contractions.
Dr. Carlson is noted for his ver
satility as a scientist. His work has
covered a multitude of subjects such
as liver function, vitamin E. the re
lation between the thyroid and the
ovaries, effect of protein digestion
on the sex of rats, and the bacteri
cidal action of ozone.
"He is a strategist on biological
Campaigns," Time reported in 1941
at the time of his retirement from
Chicago. "His students have many
discoveries to their credit which
were given guidance and impetus by
Dr. Carlson."
He has contributed generously to
civic and humanitarian affairs. In
