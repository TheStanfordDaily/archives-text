Created "From Scratch"
Stanford fencers like A 1 Synder,

cation, on his trip to "the land of the
Navajos" in Arizona and Utah. Mr.
Bugge took colored "stills'' while Mr.
Hunt recorded the Indian dances
with his movie camera.
Washington Transfer
The state of Washington was Mr.
Bugge's home until he came to Stan

University of Washington. He grad
uated from Stanford in 1926 and be
came an assistant in the department
in which he now works in 1928. He
has a home in Palo Alto with his
wife and two children, a 10-year-old
