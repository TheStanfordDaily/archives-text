# Molnar Tells Orchestra's History
## 
### 
A story on the orchestra—that was
the assignment, but it turned out to
be a story of a man, the man who or
ganized the musicians, professor
Ferene Molnar (FER-ens Mol-NAR).
Mr. Molnar, eight students (all vi
jolinists), and some enthusiastic Palo
Alto citizens were the embryo of
what is now the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra. That was five years ago.
Soon the student and faculty mem
bership increased and in those early
days even, the group increased to
| about 40 members.
An accomplished violinist himself,
Mr. Molnar was particularly proud
of the fine string section in this year's
symphony orchestra. At present 30
students and eight members of the
faculty, as well as talented Palo Al
lans comprise the body. Since the
orchestra is primarily for the stu
dents, the genial conductor stated
that he especially desired that the
student members hold the coveted
positions of student director and con
certmaster. The former at present is
Bruce Allen who plays the bassoon
| and is part professional, having been
a member of the Tacoma Symphony
Orchestra; the position of concerts
master will be taken by a girl (for
the first time in the orchestra's his
tory) the talented violinist Ruth
Gumbretcht.
At present the orchestra is well
balanced and performances by guest
artists from time to time with the
group has added to it greatly. Mr.
Molnar was especially enthusiastic
over the performance of Miss Beth
Child, who appears with the San

Francisco Symphony orchestra and i
was recently guest oboe soloist with
the Stanford symphony. As to horns. '
Mr. Molnar chuckled "the horn is the i
danger of the orchestra, but our
players are anxious to get the right
notes."
Rehearsals are continuing at least
once a week in preparation for the
concert which is to be presented June
14, a brief resume of which he gave:
of purely classical music will be se
lections of Gluk. "In Aulis" (a Wag
ner arrangement) and Vivaldi's Con
certo Grosso, the latter of which will
feature as solo violinists Rulh Gum-

I brotcht, Louise Phillips, Gordon
Raisbeck, and Ann Stuart. These
four musicians are all members of
the chamber music group. On the
same program and of special interest
to those who like lighter music will
bo Sibelius's Valse Triste (provided
the music arrives in time, Mr. Molnar
! added) and Gershwin's Porgy and
| Bess. "You might add that this is
: the last occasion to join the group,
as later on it will be too hard to pick
up. Mr. Molnar stated in reference
to prospective members.
These facts constitute the story,
but the man, rather than the facts, is
the important factor as has been sug
gested. Mr. Molnar was born in
! Budapest, Hungary, and attended
J university there. Music has always
been his first love, and he became a
very accomplished violinist in Eu
rope, and has won the same renown
I here, after he was summoned to the
| United States on the special invita-
I tion of Mrs. Coolidge.

be a story of a man, the man who or
ganized the musicians, professor
Ferene Molnar (FER-ens Mol-NAR).
Mr. Molnar, eight students (all vi
jolinists), and some enthusiastic Palo
Alto citizens were the embryo of
what is now the Stanford Symphony
Orchestra. That was five years ago.
Soon the student and faculty mem
bership increased and in those early
days even, the group increased to
| about 40 members.
An accomplished violinist himself,
Mr. Molnar was particularly proud
of the fine string section in this year's
symphony orchestra. At present 30
students and eight members of the
faculty, as well as talented Palo Al
lans comprise the body. Since the
orchestra is primarily for the stu
dents, the genial conductor stated
that he especially desired that the
student members hold the coveted
positions of student director and con
certmaster. The former at present is
Bruce Allen who plays the bassoon
| and is part professional, having been
a member of the Tacoma Symphony
Orchestra; the position of concerts
master will be taken by a girl (for
the first time in the orchestra's his
tory) the talented violinist Ruth
Gumbretcht.
At present the orchestra is well
balanced and performances by guest
artists from time to time with the
group has added to it greatly. Mr.
Molnar was especially enthusiastic
over the performance of Miss Beth
Child, who appears with the San

Francisco Symphony orchestra and i
was recently guest oboe soloist with
the Stanford symphony. As to horns. '
Mr. Molnar chuckled "the horn is the i
danger of the orchestra, but our
players are anxious to get the right
notes."
Rehearsals are continuing at least
once a week in preparation for the
concert which is to be presented June
14, a brief resume of which he gave:
of purely classical music will be se
lections of Gluk. "In Aulis" (a Wag
ner arrangement) and Vivaldi's Con
certo Grosso, the latter of which will
feature as solo violinists Rulh Gum-

I brotcht, Louise Phillips, Gordon
Raisbeck, and Ann Stuart. These
four musicians are all members of
the chamber music group. On the
same program and of special interest
to those who like lighter music will
bo Sibelius's Valse Triste (provided
the music arrives in time, Mr. Molnar
! added) and Gershwin's Porgy and
| Bess. "You might add that this is
: the last occasion to join the group,
as later on it will be too hard to pick
up. Mr. Molnar stated in reference
to prospective members.
These facts constitute the story,
but the man, rather than the facts, is
the important factor as has been sug
gested. Mr. Molnar was born in
! Budapest, Hungary, and attended
J university there. Music has always
been his first love, and he became a
very accomplished violinist in Eu
rope, and has won the same renown
I here, after he was summoned to the
| United States on the special invita-
I tion of Mrs. Coolidge.
