# Stanfordites, Palo Altans See Japanese Instrument of War
## 
### 
Stanford students and other in
habitants of Palo Alto and vicinity,
were enabled to inspect one of the
! most famous of the Japanese instru
ments of war during die exhibit of
the Zero fighter plane on Monday,
Tuesday, and Wednesday of this
; week.
, The plane is the property of the
1 United States Navy, and has been
< loaned to the Naval Aid Auxiliary by
j the Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics for
i exhibition purposes. It was shot
; down during an air battle over
! Guadalcanal in the Solomons.
! The plane fell into the water, and
remained there for about two weeks
before it was salvaged. During this
I period, a state of heavy corrosion
j set in. The Navy brought the plane
to this country for observation. It
I was partially reconstructed, using
I American parts in a few minor
| places.
Observers were most impressed by
j the Zero's lightness. It weighs only
! 5.200 pounds fully loaded. This

lightness is due to the ship's lack of
armored protection, and also partly j
to the lack of effective guards for |
i the pilot's safety, such as parachutes.
The pilot must rely upon the speed
and maneuverability of the plane for |
j protection.
It is believed that the pilot of this
particular plane was killed by a
bullet which passed through the left
wing and continued on a straight
course to the pilot's headrest. There i
are two red chevrons on each side of
the fuselage, indicating that the pilot
was a group commander.
The ship is known officially as a
Mitsubishi 00. Its guns are to a
large extent copies of similar British
guns. It possesses two machine guns
in the nose, which fire through the
i propeller, and two cannon, one in
each wing.
Proceeds from the exhibit of the
plane throughout California will be
j used to benefit sailors, marines, and
coast guardsmen in the 11th. 12th.
and 13th Naval Districts.
