Calling for all eligible women to
join the WAC for service wtih the
Army Air Forces, Lieutenant Ruth
i Ringland, head of Palo Alto recruit
; ing, emphasizes the need for women
| to fill specialized and technical jobs,
j the opportunities presented to pre
j pare for a post-war career, and the
j monetary pay and the satisfaction
j received in being a member of the
j Air-WAC.
Women in the service have proved
themselves a vital part of total war
by learning skills that are valuable
not only now in the present emer
' gency. but also in" the post-war
! world.
Air-WACs today may become ad
: rninistrative specialists, bakers and
j cooks, radio or laboratory techni
j cians, photographers, business ma
chine operators, or specialists in
more than 140 other fields.
Many women, states Lieutenant
Ringland, are actually better ofl fi
nancially in the WAC than they
i would be in civilian jobs, when all
i their free supplies and services are
1 considered.
'"They will also have the intangible
satisfaction that in the time of their
nation's need they joined Uncle
Sam's Soldiers with Wings in their
gallant effort to bring about a
quicker winning of the war," says
Lieutenant Ringland, whose head-
I quarters are 338 University Avenue,
Palo Alto.
