# THE 						WHY OF THE PREFERENTIAL
## 
### 
TO MOST PERSONS the preferential system of voting is no more
than a mysterious and bothersome procedure. It takes much less
thought to mark merely your first choice than it does to figure out
which candidates you would see hold the office if your favorite
should lose. And as for the advantages of the system or the
method of countingâ€”only Einstein could hope to understand
such a problem.
But actually the preferential system is neither mysterious
nor bothersome; it just takes a little more time and thought, a
little more interest and curiosity on the part of the voter, and the
method of counting ballots is at first confusing but becomes
simple after a time.
Exactly how votes are tallied in this procedure will be ex
plained tomorrow. This editorial will try to explain the advan
tages of the method.
When there are only two candidates running for one office,
the preferential isn't necessary since it is assumed that the
candidate other than the one indicated by the voter is that voter's
second choice. (He obviously has no other.)
But when there are more than two candidates the picture is
different. For example, let's say there are five candidates run
ning for the office of campus cleanup chairman. Candidate "A"
is backed by one group, candidate "B" by another faction, etc.
Each group wants a certain candidate and each group tries to get
as many in-between voters to choose its candidate.
And so when the votes are tallied, candidate "A" has 150,
candidate "B," 151, candidate "C," 146, etc. No one candidate
receives a majority.
Under the preferential system, a candidate has to reach a
majority before he Taking the same groups and
candidates as examples it would work out like this:
The group supporting candidate "A," the group backing "B,"
and the group backing "C" all want to see their man win. Sup
pose candidate "A" had the biggest group behind him and the
balloting was not done according to preferential; he would win.
But if voting were done under the preferential system, a few
other facts might come to light. Suppose "A" did get the highest
number of first choices. But then suppose that the group sup
porting "A" thought "B" was a good guy, and they gave him their
second choices. All of the group supporting "C" thought "B"
was good, too, and so he got their second choices.
In this case "B" would win and rightly so since most of the
voters wanted him next to their particular favorite. No one faction
could take over and no one faction could push their candidate
into office. It merely means that the best all-around man is the
winner.
This probably is not detailed enough to really explain the
advantage of the preferential system. If it is not, maybe the ex
planation of the method of counting which will be explained to
morrow will help. If not, the Editorial Board will be on hand
Tuesday evening to try to help any doubters who remain in the
dark.
