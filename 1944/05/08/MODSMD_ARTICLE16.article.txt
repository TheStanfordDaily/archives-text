THE BRITISH in India seem to be headed for a beautiful mess.
First, the laps drove them all the way back to Imphal—had them
encircled at Kohima (a fact we didn't know about until the Jap
ring of steel was broken) and still the Japs aren't completely de
feated in this area.
This last week we heard that the Viceroy of India had finally
released Mohandas K. Gandhi from 21 months detention in the
Aga Khan's summer palace at Poona. But many felt that the
end of his imprisonment marks the beginning of his demise.
For many months now the disciple of India's masses has been
suffering from high blood pressure and various kidney ailments.
Evidently the British see Gandhi's death approaching and
don't want him to die under their detention. A smart move, but
not smart enough. To the uneducated man in India—whom
Gandhi champions—it will look like the British are the direct
cause of his death when it does come.
NATIVES MALTREATED
This falls under the classification of criticism without a cos

sible alternative, but we certainly don't like the way the whole
India problem has been handled for the past 10 years. It's been
one constant fight between Britain and Gandhi —and just be
cause India's millions are illiterate—Britain has tromped all over
those people.
The Indians have wanted their independence since way back.
Well, give it to them and let them judge for themselves whether
they liked British rule or the messy job of gaining independence
and trying to keep it running without their Far Eastern neighbors
walking in at the psychological moment—when the administra
tion of an independent nation is getting troublesome and say
ing, "See here, the British neved did rule your people right—
you aren't doing too good a job now, suppose you let us try for
a while."
BUT JAPS NO BETTER
Japan tried this, but the Nips were outsmarted by British
forces. This battle took place mainly along the propaganda line.
The Japs then got mad and shawed their cards by bombing, thus
nullifying any further efforts of gaining control of India. Their
recent smash at Imphal has further shown the Indian people the
true colors of the Japanese.
After the British give the Indians a chance at self rule and the
Indians manage to mess things up—which they may not do—
we think the British will find it much easier to maintain this
valuable portion of the British Empire.
