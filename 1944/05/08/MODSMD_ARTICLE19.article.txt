# Dig up Those Orange Rebate Tickets, Kids
## 
### 
Now is the time for all good
Farm students to divest themselves
of the little orange pieces of paper
that have been piling up in their
desks, their pockets, pursesâ€” !
and get paid for it, too!
Yes, the rebate slips that the
bookstore gives you every time i
you give them some money are
now due. They must be turned in
to the bookstore by next Monday, j
May 15.
The Stanford Bookstore is a co
operative enterprise, and your re
bate slips represent your share of
the profit it has made. In June,
before school closes, all students
who turned in their rebate slips
will receive a refund from the
Bookstore.
