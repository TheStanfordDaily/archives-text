## 
### 
Debaters Carol Newton, Virginia
Schwartz, and Bob Rubenstein will
go to Berkeley tomorrow to repre
sent Stanford in the annual Jofl're
Debate with the University of Cali
fornia.
The Stanford speakers were chosen
last Thursday to compete for the
coveted JofTre Medaille after a long
try-out period during which they
and other members of the .squad
made an extensive study of the gen
eral question, "The French Commit
tee of National Liberation."
Contest at Wheeler Hall
The contestants will not know the
exact wording of the question they
will debate in Berkeley until two
hours before the debate, which will
be held before a customarily large
audience in Wheeler Auditorium at
7:30.
While the participants are pre
paring for the debate, the California
squad will be host at a banquet to
the coaches and other speakers from
both schools.
Since its inauguration, the annual
contest- for the Joffre Medaille has

been the most important debate of
the year for both Stanford and Cali
fornia forensic squads, and until the
war the medallion, named in honor
of Marshal Joffre, was coined in the
National Mint of France and awarded
by a representative of the Third Re
public.
Stanford Last Year's Victor
The debate will be carried on by
two teams, each made up of two
speakers from one school and one
from the other. The medal, which
was last year won by Charlie Allen
of Stanford, ex-Daily associate edi
tor, will be awarded to the most out
standing individual speaker, irre
spective of the team.
The topic for the final try-out
debate last Thursday was "Resolved,
that the policy of the United States
has made more difficult the estab
lishment of a republican government
in France after the war."
The /representatives of the present
De Gaulist government in San Fran
cisco have been very helpful in sup
plying information relative to the
debate question, according to Miss
Schwartz, debate manager.
