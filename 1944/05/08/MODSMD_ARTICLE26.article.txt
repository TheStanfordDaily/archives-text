# Cardinal Choir Sings Service
## 
### 
For (he first time this quarter, the
Stanford Choir in its cardinal gowns
sang from the chancel of the church
in yesterday's Sunday morning serv
ice. The choir sang a response with
Mrs. W. D. Allen, who sang from the
choir loft, and an anthem.
Dr. D. Elton Trueblood, University
chaplain, used the prayer for the
fourth Sunday alter Easter, as found
in the Book of Common Prayer. This
prayer, which is also a philosophy of
life, has the theme (hat, in this world
of change, our hearts must be fixed
"where true joys are to be found;
through Jesus Christ."
Dr. Trueblood pointed out that
joy is a feature of Christianity; and
that, in this ever changing world, we
must have something stable. The
way to achieve this stability is to

love the things which He command
ed, "and that most worthy of our de
votions is God," Dr. Trueblood said.
