Med School copped top honors in the
Spring Sing held last Friday night,
•with honorable mention going to
Ruble and the Cadet Nurses in the
undergraduate women's division, and
to Garfield and Monroe in the under
graduate .men's. The choice, the
judges admitted, was very close; the
singers all deserved recognition.
Granada, under the direction of
Sarah Wills, sang "Smoke Gets in

consistent with those of former years,
for records show that this casa re

and came out tops the year before.

performance was highlighted by their
grey and red cadet uniforms.

singing organization in the men's

complete with derbies, white coats,
and beer bottles, and Monroe's med

ley of international folk tunes, "Little
