# Granada, SAE, Med School Judged Winner at Sing
## 
### 
Casa Granada, the S.A.E.'s, and the
Med School copped top honors in the
Spring Sing held last Friday night,
•with honorable mention going to
Ruble and the Cadet Nurses in the
undergraduate women's division, and
to Garfield and Monroe in the under
graduate .men's. The choice, the
judges admitted, was very close; the
singers all deserved recognition.
Granada, under the direction of
Sarah Wills, sang "Smoke Gets in
Your Eyes." Their performance was
consistent with those of former years,
for records show that this casa re
ceived honorable mention last year,
and came out tops the year before.
"Johnny" Is Introduced
Roble, led by Nan Belcher, sang
Jane Frazier's original song, "Johnny
Come Home," which was received by
the audience with repeated rounds of
applause. The Cadet Nurses, led by
Nancy Dole, sang original words to
"Marching Along Together". Their
performance was highlighted by their
grey and red cadet uniforms.
The S.A.E.'s "Poodle Dog Song"
was one of the few attempts at real
singing organization in the men's
groups. The others, such as Gar
field's hilarious "Girl of My Dreams,''
complete with derbies, white coats,
and beer bottles, and Monroe's med

ley of international folk tunes, "Little
Orphan Annie," "Jack Armstrong."
and "Junior Birdmen," were de
signed strictly for "humah."
Med Musicians
The Med School sang "Aura Lee"
and the "WhifTenpoof Song," led by
Tom Bond and Charles Miller, and
featuring a solo by Don Landale.
Midway in the performance of 27
numbers, the large audience was
treated to the singing of Corp. Frank
Rogier, singing "Stouthearted Men,"
and the band, under the direction of
Dr. Herbert Jan Popper, playing
"Stormy Weather."
Tillson Performs
At the request of the audience, Nan
Tillson, star of autumn quarter's
the hit of that show, "Every Night Is
Ladies' Night at Belt's," but even
the hundreds of people singing could
not drown out the familiar Tillson
voice.
The decision of the judges was an
nounced immediately afterward, and
a round of applause was given to
Blossom Parke, director of the sing,
and to Rick Supple, emcee.
