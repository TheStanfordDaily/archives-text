# Lane Libe Displays Old Baby Bottles
## 
### 
The Lane Medical Library has on
exhibition the Mead Johnson and Co.
collection of Pediatric Antiques. This
is a rather remarkable group of
pewter, glass, ceramic, stone, and
metal nursing bbttles. The bottles in
many forms cover the period from
200 B.C. to the present time and are
from Europe, Asia, Africa, and
America.
The collection is one of consider
able historical importance because
it depicts the progression of infants'
feeding vessels from Greece of 25
centuries ago down to time within
our own memory.
The collection has been steadily
growing in size and scope and is of
increasing interest for teaching pur
poses via the historical route.
