| Adler's address of last November,
! "Questions Science Cannot Answer."
\ Opposed to Adler's Views
i It promises to be an interesting
! and controversial lecture, as the
views of Dr. Carlson are opposed to
those of Dr. Adler in many respects

Dr. Adler advocated college studie,*
j which would supplement and com
| plement the natural* sciencesâ€”those
which aid in answering questions 06
values, not facts. The questions sci
ence cannot answer, he believed, are
those which cannot be weighed,
measured, or tested but which are
most important philosophically.

Dr. Carlson, who received his
Ph.D. degree at Stanford in 1902, is
noted as a versatile scientist. 'He is
a strategist on biological campaigns,"

great skill and persistence." said Dr.
Raj' Lyman Wilbur.
