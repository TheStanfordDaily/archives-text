# The
						Preferential Count
## 
### 
DON'T vote carelessly tomorrow, just paying attention to your
first choices and then marking the rest of the ballot diagonally
or because you like the sound of a certain candidate's name. This
morning's paper gives you the names of all those in the running.
Ask your friends about the persons you don't know and tomor
row morning at the assembly take a good look.
Why all this trouble? Because your second,'third, and fourth,
etc. choices can pack as big a wallop as your first. Here's how
the preferential is counted:
First-choice votes are counted and tallied, and the ballots
are arranged in piles so that each pile contains the first choice
ballots of a single candidate.
If no candidate receives a majority of first choices, the one
receiving the lowest number of first choices is dropped from
the voting list and the votes credited to him are scratched from
the tally sheet.
The second-choice votes on the ballots of this candidate are
counted and the ballots placed % in the piles of those receiving
these second choices. These are tallied and counted and the
candidate having a majority of the total votes cast is the winner.
If still a majority has not been reached, the candidate with
the lowest number of votes is scratched out of the race. The
second-choice votes on the ballots of this candidate are counted
and the ballots placed in the piles of those receiving these sec
ond choices. However, if these second choices are for the candi
date already disqualified, the third choice is counted. If a ma
jority vote has been reached after this tally, no further counting
is necessary.
If no election has resulted, the procedure is repeated until a
majority vote is reached. In doing this, preference for candidates
already dropped is ignored and the next preference for a name
still on the voting list is counted.
And that is the preferential system. If Stanford voters vote
intelligently, it works as it should, with that candidate who is an
all around favorite emerging victorious.
