BAEDECKER'S GUIDE TO THE HOOVER HOME
For our first excursion, let's really go whole hog and delve
into the location of that famed Stanford mystery, the Hoover
Home, so-called because Herbert Hoover slept here. This historic
pile is located just about 460 miles from the heart of down-town
Los Angeles, and on a clear day you can see Dr. Tresidder.
First, we must lay out our equipment. Absolutely necessary
are ten complete changes of clothing (we may be asked to spend
the week-end), a machete or handaxe, a compass, a Kwik-Kook
Kamp Kooker, provisions for several days, a slingshot, several
distress flares, five drams of arsenic, a short length of lead pipe,
a four-foot rope, and Dr. Eliot's Five-Foot Shelf. A one-way
ticket to New York may come in handy, also.
Now we are ready to begin. We leave Buchanan Hall before
sun-up, on the first day of summer vacation, and hike steadily
up Santa Ynez Street until we reach our base camp. Here we
meet our Indian guide, Poontang, who silently beckons us to
follow. We hack a trail with our machetes through the dense
mesquite, and plod along silently until, in the distance, we see
the shining spires of that city of mystery, Woodside. We make
camp at the base of a convenient hill, within a bird's throw of
Mother Mangini's Fruit Juice Stand, and with our Kamp Kooker
we whip up a mess of eggs benedict, lobster thermidor, shesh
kabeb, or whatever happens to tickle our fancy, while Poontang
proceeds to interrogate the natives as to just where the hell we
are. Gatting the directions to the Paly Station from Mother Man
gini, we follow her instructions to the letter, and, after a ten-day
overland trek, we arrive on the outskirts of Fallbrook, Calif,
(pop. 489, with one additional on the way), where we catch the
Super Chief to New York. We take a cab from Grand Central to
the Waldorf, and after climbing 24 flights, ring the door bell at
2468 Waldorf Towers. The door opens and we are greeted by
Mr. Hoover himself, who benignly thrusts Root Bâ€”r floats into
our hands, and bids us make ourselves at home.
Eureka!
