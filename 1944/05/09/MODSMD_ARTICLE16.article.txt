A combination of two facts came out in yesterday's news reports that
to the galaxy of facts that point to an invasion in the near future. Since
this is a short squib today, here are the cold facts.
Over the weekend 7,000 planes took part in a raid that extended from
Berlin to Bucharest. One of the press services calls it the greatest demon-

stration of air power in history—♦
which cannot he denied. The last j
mighty show of air power took place :
some weeks ago with only 6,000 ;
[ planes showing up for a weekend |
sortie. The huge allied air fleets {
bombed Berlin and Bucharest and 19
other targets from Belgium to the
Balkans.
Bombers from Italy and England I
took part in the many-pointed as- j
sault on the continent.
Another indication that the allied
I spring offensive may soon get under- j
I way is the announcement that the j
j French will curtail all railway opera- !
tion May 15. Only that essential ;
traffic and the railway traffic under !
strictest German supervision will be j
j aillowed to continue. It means only
| one thing. The Germans are moving
! the big guns and supplies up to the
j coast and are also keeping the rails
i clear to avoid any sabotage and re
| sultant traffic jam when the invasion
j does come.
j It is just as essential to a defending
j force that it keep its lines of com
; munication open as it is to the in
: vading force to keep its lines of sup
ply open. Should the French rail- I
j ways be blocked and jammed by I
1 traffic and sabotage, it follows that |
! the Germans Wouldn't hold out very :
j long because their, supplies would
rapidly diminish. These two facts,
then, help point the way to an in- i
vasion soon. The Germans expect it.
