# Meds, Firehouse Softball Leaders
## 
### DICK BLOCK 
The little red fire engine and the
trusty ambulance seem to be in mad
pursuit of each other. If you do not
get the symbolism we are referring to
the two hottest teams in the intra
! mural league, the Firehouse and the
! Med School.
The softball circuit is rounding the
1 bend with tonight being number 5
in the 11 round-robin series. The
j medics are at the top of the heap,
having defeated McKinley, Bucha
j nan, and Lincoln. Firehouse drew a
I tie with Monroe in their first game,
i and then went on to smother Tyler,
Gerona, and McKinley. If both
teams win consistently in their next
games, there is going to be a honey
j of a ball game a week from this
Thursday when they clash on the
| diamond.
i With the advent of several good
| games on the diamond this evening,
j we have dragged out the venerable
j sports staff ouija board and various
j other paraphernalia for predicting,
! to put ourselves on the tip of the
| proverbial limb.
Garfield finds itself opposed to the
Meds. This would have been a very
easy game to predict if Garfield had
not buried Tyler last week, but the
tea leaves still say Medics. With the
J aid of the gods Tyler will get by
Gerona; Lincoln will not have quite
j enough Wheaties to bypass Hayes;
' Monroe's Sher and McKinJey's
! Walsh will have a pitching duel, but
; Monroe has the edge on hitting; and
Firehouse will neutralize Buchanan.
