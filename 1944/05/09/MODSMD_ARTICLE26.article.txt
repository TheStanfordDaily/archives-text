# McCarthy Gone, Yanks Still Win
## 
### 
In the past nine years, the mighty
New York Yankees have slugged
their way to eight American League
pennants and seven world champion
ships. a feat unparalleled in the'his
tory of major league baseball. It is
obvious that the Yanks had "some
thing" that no other major league
ball club had ever been able to find.
Two main theories were postulated
as to what that "something" was.
One faction claimed that it was Man
ager Joe McCarthy who made the
Yankees whal Ihey were, that no
matter how poor his material at the
beginning of a season. McCarthy
could always turn out a world cham
| pion team. The other faction claimed
j that the great names the Yankees
had could always win a pennant re
gardless of how they were handled.
Controversy raged for years over this
question.
This year, both factions were satis
fied that the Yanks were finally
washed up. One after another of the
Yankee "greats" were drafted; and
I then, as the season opened, Manager
j McCarthy was ordered by his doctor
to retire.
And yet, the amazing Yanks, with
neither great manager nor playing
stars, continue to march at the head
of the rank. After one month, they
are firmly established in second
place, and slowly whittling down the
lead of the league-leading St. Louis
Browns.
What that spark is that the Yank
ees have may never be known. Per
haps it is their vast wealth, enabling
them to buy the best of the rookie
crop each year. Perhaps it is the
very Yankee name itself, which con
tinues to inspire awe in the hearts
of players and fans, and which draws
thousands upon thousands of spec
| tators each week. Your guess is as
good as mine.
