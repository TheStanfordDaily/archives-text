### RENA JEAN BLACK 
In these days, when Stanford
: roughs are becoming alumni almost
before they have had a chance to
i really become Stanford students, the
Stanford Alumni Review, edited by
| Frank Guthrie, class of '40, is helping
! more than ever to keep former stu-
I dents in touch with their alma mater.
Although the magazine is little
l known to campus students, the
Alumni Review first began publica
tions'in 1899, according to Mr. Guth
rie, under the Alumni Association, as
a means of keeping Stanford Alumni
in touch with their former classmates
and up to date on present Stanford
i Activities.
The magazine, which is printed by
I the Stanford University Press, keeps
; contact with all students who leave
i the campus. Most of % the news items
: are bits of information about former
! students, and, since the war, have
been mostly war news about boys in
J the armed forces. Interesting stories
| about the faculty and present Uni
: versity happenings are printed, as are
j stories of outstanding alumni.
Stanford Alums
• Every former Stanford student—
j even a first-quarter freshman —is
considered an alumnus upon leaving
school, and can belong to the Alumni
Association. The Alumni Review is
j his chance to remain a part of Stan
| ford.
Frank Guthrie, when he was asked
about his part in the publication of
the magazine, immediately began
! talking about Neil Van Sooy, class
| of '28, who, as Alumni Director, is
directly responsible for the magazine,
j Mr. Van Sooy, according to Mr.
! Guthrie, is the man responsible for
bringing the magazine even more
j into prominence as a campus publi
cation. "I only write the stuff they
print," said Mr. Guthrie.
First Review
The Alumni Review, the editor
j went on to say, was originally called
j the Stanford Alumnus. From 191G
jto 1917, a student publication, the
| Illustrated Review, ran competition
j to the Alumnus, until the two maga
i zines joined forces under the Alumni
Association. The magazine then took

the student title and students began
contributing news material to the
publication.
In 1942, the title was changed
again to the Stanford Alumni Re
view, and is now handled entirely by
the editor and the alumni director.
Total Subscribers
Several campus fraternities have
given subscriptions of the Review to
all their personal alumni now in the
armed services, and Review sub
scribers now total around 7,500.
The Alumni Review's program in
cludes the sponsorship of the Stan
ford Club system which extends
across the United States from the
Pacific Coast to New York and
Washington, D.C., and whose mem
bership consists of former Stanford
ites.
