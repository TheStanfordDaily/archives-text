Only a perilous grip on a swaying ]
' wires saved one member of the Stan- !
ford family from an untimely death j
on Lomita Drive yesterday afternoon. |
It was a tedious affair to climb }
down the telephone pole, cross the j
street, and climb back up into the !
pine tree. Hence the little brown j
squirrel —of the variety commonly j
: seen scampering across the Quad —
took the shortest way out and started j
j across the telephone wire.
As he reached the center of the 1
wire, midway between the pole and
< the pine tree, a sudden gust of wind j
j dislodged him from his perch and
he hung by one paw, suspended 15 [
feet above Lomita Drive.
As the wind subsided he clambered
back —and very slowly, very care- !
i fully, walked the wire tight-rope to j
j his pine tree.
Moral: Next time, use the pedes
trian crosswalk!
