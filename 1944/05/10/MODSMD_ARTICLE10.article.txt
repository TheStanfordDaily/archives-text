eral assembly at !) this morning in
Memorial Auditorium. Voting will

rison announced last night.
Ballot booths will be placed on
English and Engineering corners. All
voters must present their student
body cards. Election returns will be
tabulated in the Nitery from 4 to 6
this afternon and after 7 tonight.
Miss Harrison emphasized the fact
that preferential voting does not
lessen a candidate's chances. A
choice beyond your first is preferred,
unless you do not know the addi
tional candidates.
Election Rules
Other election rules include: no
votes by proxy; no written cam
paigning of any type; no electioneer
ing for a 25-yard radius around the
polls.
Failure of any candidate to appeal
at the assembly constitutes a decli
nation.
The new election system, approved
last week by Excom, was recom
mended by a special committee ap
pointed to study the election system
and offer suggestions for its im
provement.
New System
The committee, headed by Ewell
Sale, recommended that "a system be
adopted where office-holders remain,
in office for three quarters, being
elected during the spring and serv
ing, excluding summer quarter, into
the following spring.
''This summer's officers would be
a carry-over from the present office
holders with appointments to fill an>
vacancies."
During the three-quarter period
any vacancies will be filled by ap
pointments. A second minor elec
tion could be held winter quarter to
fill in vacancies and the places of
those people going out at the end of
winter quarter.
This system, the committee de
cided. would give smoother transition
and more time for newly elected of
ficers to learn and make use of their
knowledge.
