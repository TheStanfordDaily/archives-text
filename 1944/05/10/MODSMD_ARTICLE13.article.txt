## THE 						CASE-OF THE MISSING MURDERER 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
"Quick, check that in the dictionary," shouted Private Investi
gator Shelton Kwagmire to his seductive looking secretary who
was paging madly through the office Webster.
"I've got it! I've got it!", she replied, "Carbine! C-a-r-b-i-n-e!"
"Ah yes," muttered the detective, "And I guess that finishes
the crossword puzzle for today."
With that the phone rang.
"Hello. Kwagmire on the wire. What's that? You say Mrs.
Hampstead H. Rumstead, of the 'Rumstead on the Hudson' Rum
steads, was found murdered in her room? O.K. I'll be right over."
"That was Chief Dugan," explained Kwagmire to his secretary
as he hung up the phone. "Look up Mrs. Hampstead H. Rum
stead in our files immediately."
In a few moments, the secretary was looking through a large
manila folder which bore Mrs. Rumstead's name on the cover.
"I suppose she has four or five housekeepers," remarked the
detective.
"That's right."
"And they all have a motive for killing her."
"That's right," answered the secretary.
"And naturally she has two butlers."
"Yes."
"And they, too, would have good motives for killing her."
"That's right."
"Well, we don't have to worry about them, the butlers and
housekeepers never commit the murders," remarked the de
tective thoughfully.
"Kwagmire, you're a genius," replied the secretary, watching
the detective pour a bottle of red dye on his hair, and put on one
of his fales moustaches.
With that, Kwagmire put on his great heavy camel's hair over
coat and started out the door.
"Give me the clues, and I'll have the Rumstead case cracked
in 24 hours."
"Kwagmire, you're a genius," echoed the secretary mechani
cally, as the detective slammed the door.
