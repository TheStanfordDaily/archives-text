Dear Stanford Voters:
This coming election (national) promises to be one of the
closest in the past 24 years —and, because of the deliberately
cumbersome machinery set up to accommodate the soldier vote
and the vast numbers of relocated laborers disfranchised by the
residence requirements of the states, it promises to be one of the
most abnormal lections in our national history. So—if you good
Republicans want to throw the weight of your vote in the political
picture it is time to get busy, for your vote may carry more weight
this fall than it ever will again.
If you are 21 or become 21- before that second Tuesday in
November you must register sometime between the date of the
primary in your state (May 16 in California) and the deadline set
for registration for the final election. If you live in Palo Alto
and can prove that you are completely self-supporting you may
register and vote here, regardless of where your home is. Other
wise you must first write to the county clerk or supervisor of
elections in your home district and ask for an application for
absentee registration. Once you have filled this out and returned
it you will be eligible to vote by an absentee ballot—which will
be sent to you here.
It is not complicated — and is unquestionably worth your
while —not only as a mark of the interested citizen but as a sym
bol of the new dignity of your adulthood. Go on—do it soon.
Unsigned.
