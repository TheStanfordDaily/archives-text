### MARY AL SMITH 
Dr. Anton J. Carlson, president of the American Association for the
Advancement of Science, in his discussion at last evening's Tuesday Series,
agreed with his colleague, Dr. Mortimer Adler, that the knowledge of
philosophy, science, and religion, although they pretend to describe the
nature of man and of the universe, each stand alone.

Dr. Carlson, however, disagreed
with Dr. Adler's conviction that
philosophy and religion are the roads
to knowledge, by reviewing ihe
achievements of science in the past
80 years.
Religion still describes the universe
| as unknowable, whereas science has
j made progress in working with space,
| time, matter, and force, the "un
! knowables" of Spencer, continued
Dr. Carlson.
Through Dr. Carlson's talk ran the
! theme that the scientific method of
accurate observation, experimenta
j tion, checking, and interpreting facts
is more profitable to the acquiring of
j knowledge than the methods of ab
! stract thinking of philosophy and the
j revelation and faith of religion,
j Concluded Dr. Carlson, "Modern
philosophers, who have more in
formation to work with than did the
| ancients, must stick to their facts
i and use the trial and error method
j of science, instead of being just arm
j chair logicians."
