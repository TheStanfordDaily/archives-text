# Get Your ASSU Card — An Editorial
## 
### 
TODAY is the day. It doesn't mean much to
most persons, but it's an important day to every
Stanford student who realizes what a blessing
it is to be able to,choose A.S.S.U. leaders. One
vote doesn't count much, true. But if you're too
lazy to run back home and get your student
body card, just think for a minute how things
might be if officers were appointed and not
popularly elected.
A few things to remember:
No written campaigning is allowed, and there
is to be no electioneering for a 25-yard radius
around the polls;
Vote carefully because your second, third,

fourth, etc. choices frequently are as important
as your first. (The why and how of the prefer
ential are explained in the Dailies of Monday
and Tuesday.);
You don't have to indicate more than one
choice, but that is necessary to make the pref
erential successful;
When two officers are to be elected from one
group of candidates, the preferential is not used.
Just indicate your two choices;
And there are the few most important rules.
The Election Board has asked that everyone
read the directions on the ballots—over 100
ballots had to be discarded at the last leection
because directions weren't read.
