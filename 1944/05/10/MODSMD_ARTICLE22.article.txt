# Nazis Withdraw On Italian Front
## 
### 
ALLIED HQ, NAPLES (UP) —
The Germans have withdrawn
abruptly from the east-central sector
of the main Italian front and allied
troops, pouring into the breach for
gains up to 11 miles, have driven
Within 12 miles of the big rail and
highway junction of Sulmona, it
was announced today.
Polish and Empire troops of Lt.
Gen. Sir Oliver Leese's Eighth Army
also seized a considerable section of
the important lateral motor supply
road at the base of the Maiella
mountain range—"The roof of Italy"
—where it runs through the towns
of Palena and Lettopalena.
The German move apparently was
not dictated by last Friday's breach
ing by dive bombers of the big Torre
Dam across the Pescara River, since
the consequent flood affected only
the Adriatic coastal end of the front.
It appeared, rather, that a general
shortening of the front to conserve
manpower and supply facilities, the
German command hoping that the
massive 4,000-moot Faiella plateau
would keep the Allies from continu
ing on to Sulmona and splitting the
entire front.
