### BILL ADAMS 
The pennant-bound Med School
nine remained on top of the intra
mural heap at the end of the fifth
round of play yesterday, completely
the Garfield Hall team,
7 to 2. Superior fielding gave the
Meds the game, as the fielders killed
Garfield threats in nearly every in
ning. Meds' big inning was the sec
ond, in which they made five runs
oft' walks, errors, and one hit. The
only long hit of the game was a home
run for the Med School in the fourth
inning.
Monroe got back hi the win column
with an 8 to 4 triumph over the Mc-
Kinley nine; Joe Sher allowed his
second hit of the season; most of
McKinley's runs being made on

| for the McKinley boys, and retained
excellent control throughout the
seven innings. Sher and G'etchell [
led the hitters with a triple apiece. !
j Geroria downed Monroe on Wednes- !
day night, 2 to 0.
Hayes remained one of the two
| undefeated, untied teams in the |
league, staging one of those notorious |
"after-dark" rallies to beat Lincoln,
| 9 to 8. Lincoln took the lead in the
! fifth inning with a five-run rally. A
I scene reminiscent of Lippy Durocher I
in his hey-day occurred in the last
j inning when Pitcher Morrison was
t called safe on a close play at second
i base.
Buchanan proved no match for the
j rampaging Fireboys. Final score was
