It happens every time. No sooner
does a sports writer state in his col
umn that because of clouds over the
sun around sundown, the best
weather for mural Softball games is
five innings, than Ihe players start
wearing baseball caps and sun glasses
to keep the blinding rays of ol' sol
out of their eyes.
Since the sun evidently has de
luded that summer is really here, the
softball league might as well keep in
step by extending the game time to
seven innings. Five innings is all
light, but seven is more like baseball
â€”and who knows, maybe in a little
while we can play the regulation nine
innings.
Most of the teams have already
begun playing seven-inning tilts, but
for those who haven't, this should
serve to keep them up with the rest
of the league.
That amazing boy, Joe Slier, is still
at it. Rated as just about the top
hurler in the circuit, he hasn't given
up more than five hits in any game,
or failed to strike out less than 11
opposing batters.
Shcr opened the season by chuck
ing two straight no hitters in his
first two starts, and hasn't shown any
signs yet of falling off from the ter
rific pace he's setting. Practically by
his pitching alone, the weak hitting
and foul fielding Monroe squad is
still up there among the leaders.
