# Golden Spike Joined Railroad Seventy-Five Years Ago Today
## 
### 
Today marks the 75th commemo
ration of the completion of the first
transcontinental railroad. May 10,
1869. The golden spike that was laid
at Promontory Point, Utah and which
joined the Union Pacific and the
Central Pacific is now owned by
Stanford University.
The spike is kept in a vault in San
Francisco, but was lent by the Uni
versity trustees to Cecil B. De Mille
for use in Paramount's "Union Pa
cific" and the Golden Gate Interna
tional Exposition on Treasure Island. 1
Symbol of Unity
The legend on the golden spike
reads: "May God continue the unity
of our Country as this Railroad
unites the two great Oceans of the
World."
The collection now being shown in j
the main library contains a pass is- j
sued to Mr. Timothy Hopkins, foster |
son of Mark Hopkins and life-long j
trustee of Stanford University. In
1892 Mr. Timothy Hopkins gave the j
original collection of railroad mate- j
rial that marked the beginning of j
the Hopkins Transportation Library.
The last tie that was laid that j
memorable May day is to be seen in |
part in the showcase along with a j

money bag of Timothy Hopkins,
views of the Central Pacific train
ferry and the terrain over which the
trains passed, newspapers, and arti
cles of the years of 18G9 to 1870.
Varied Collection
General Grenville Dodge's book,
"How We Built the Union Pacific" is
a further attraction to the fascinating
collection. He was one of the men
who helped add the last tie and spike
to the railroad, along with Senator
Stanford.
The display for the anniversary
contains letters, poems, books, ac
counts, by-laws, speeches, a guide
book of California, and an amusing
letter from Collis P. Huntington to
Mark Hopkins dated Jan. 3, 18G6,
which states "If it had not been for
you and I the Central Pacific would
have gone to the Devil before this."
