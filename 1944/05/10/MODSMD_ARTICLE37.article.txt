# Old Boy Promises Chaparral in May
## 
### 
Strange goings on have been not
iced recently in Press building. Bats
fly in and out, moans and curses are
rife, and occasionally screams of
laughter rend the air. Feeling curi
ous, your reporter hiked up the
stairs and fell through a trap door
into the Chaparral offices, where Bill
Hyer, attired in Old Boy costume,
was just unwinding himself from a
pool of India ink.
It didn't seem to bother him at all,
because he was also writing a shady
jgke on the floor with his toe.
Gathering her courage in both
hands, your reporter asked in a
loud, clear voice, "Well, when's the
thing coming out?" As she rolled
head first down the plush-covered
stairway, a maniac scream followed
her: ''End of the month. Yaaa!'"
