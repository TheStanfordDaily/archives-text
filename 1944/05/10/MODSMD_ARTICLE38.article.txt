# Bogart Back In Marseille
## 
### 
"Passage to Marseille," with
Humphrey Bogart, Claude Rains, and
Michele Morgan, now showing at the

Stanford Theater.
One of the most
interesting stories
to come out of
Hollywood for a
long time, "Pas
,sage to Marseille"
i is prevented from
being another
"Casablanca" by
using an involved
series of flash
backs within

flashbacks that make it all but im
possible for Mr. Average Movie-goer
to find out just where the passage is.
If you hang onto your wits, however,
and watch the show carefully, you
may be able to get along with only a
little trouble.
Free French Recruits
The story is about five convicts
who escape from the French penal
colony at Devil's Island to go home
to fight for France; on the way
France signs the armistice with Ger
many and the problem comes up of
whether they should continue on
their way to Marseille or change
their course to England. Some ap
peasers provide a little trouble, but
in the end our side wins and every
one turns up as the nucleus of a Free
French squadron in the R.A.F.
As a Bogart vehicle the rnovie loses
its power in the end by letting our
Humphrey do nothing but fight some
gory battles, shoot down an attack
ing German plane, and machine-gun
its surviors.
Bogart, 8.D.1.
The beginning makes up for it in
a flashback to the Bogie's life in
France 8.D.1, (before Devil's Island)
;uid gives him and lovely Michele
Morgan a chance to display a little of
their dramatic prowess in a very
tender love story. An excellent sup
porting cast helps smooth out some of
the rough spots in an otherwise top
notch movie.
An interesting sidelight is Bogart's
machine-gunning of the surviors of
the German plane which bombed the
ship and strafed the men on deck.
Two years ago the picture would
probably have been condemned for
this incident, whereas audiences of
today receive it with smug satisfac
tion. —Shelton
