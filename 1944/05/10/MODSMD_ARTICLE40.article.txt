# Private Fetter Tells Women Advantages of Joining WACS
## 
### HELEN DIETZ 
"My six months as a buck private in the WAC have been among the
happiest, most broadening, adventuresome, and soul-satisfying of my life,"
states Pvt. Ellen C. Fetter, now at Palo Alto WAC recruiting headquarters
on detached duty from Fort Lewis, Wash.
Private Fetter, who holds a master's degree from Columbia School of

i Comparative Literature, started'
teaching college in 1926. She has
traveled extensively in Europe and
speaks three languages. Now she
directs her words toward university
graduates who are afraid to join the
WAC without a commission.

| "As a private I have had the privi
! lege of knowing intimately all
j America," states Pvt. Fetter. "In
' traveling all over the country I have
| been received in many civilian
| homes, and have had the opportunity
j of making friends among people of
i all classes as I couldn't have done if
j I had stayed in my own intellectual
I environment."
The private leads a carefree life,
! despite regimentation, continued Pvt.
j Fetter. She has no responsibilities,
I no economic worries, and no grueling
I decisions to make.
If invited to go to officers' school it
i is the WAC's duty to do so, but Pvt.
j Fetter doubts if she can ever be as
happy.
Pvt. Fetter, whose father, Frank
Albert Fetter, taught economics at
Stanford when David Starr Jordan

| was University president, joined the
i WAC after she watched the experi
] ences of students who left Long Is
j land University (where she was
teaching) to go to war.
Pvt. Fetter's older brother, who
j was born at Stanford, is on leave
| from the economic department at
I Haverford to work on the govern
! merit's lend-lease program. He has
j recently returned from India. Her
I youngest brother is a captain in the
; Army.
