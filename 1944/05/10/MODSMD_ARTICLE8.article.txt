# Bassett To Star in Play
## 
### BETH McVICAR 
Lee Emerson Bassett is listed in the
: bawlout as '"professor emeritus," but
I there is no hint that he was the orig
! inal instructor and head of the
I speech and drama department, that
I he served at Stanford for 38 years,
t and that he will appear tonight in
| "The Truth About Blayds," Stanford
Players production of the famous
Milne play.
Bassett As Blayds
Bassett will portray Blayds. whose
j 90th birthday is being celebrated at
the opening of the play. Blayds is a
| world-famed poet, who begins to tell
j the story of his success in the first
' act, and whose death leaves the facts
to be revealed within the remaining
i acts.
According to Bassett, the part is a
fine one; according to previewers,
Bassett is equally fine. Perhaps ex
: perience is the key to his success, for
: he has played in and directed many
; student and faculty productions.

Chester Barker, secretary of the
speech and drama department, an
nounced that there are still tickets
available for tonight's and Monday
night's performances of "The
Truth About Blayds."
They may he obtained by calling
P.A. 2-2041 or at the box office of
the theater.

When he came to Stanford in 1901,
| he was called an instructor in Eng
| lish, but he actually served as public
speaking director. Gradually the
| speech and drama classes developed
j an interest of their own, and at the
| close of the decade of the 'twenties,
I were proclaimed as a separate divi
sion in the English department. It
| was recognized as a separate depart
! ment in 1938, following Bassett's re
i tirement.
I In 1938, the newly founded depart
! ment was assigned to the Memorial
Auditorium. Begun by Bassett alone,
the department now had 12 full-time
teachers.
Globe Stage Built
Reviewing his experiences in dra
matics at Stanford, Bassett told of
the Elizabethan play, "Knight of the
Burning Pestle," produced in 1903,
| which required the traditional set
! ting of the Globe Theater of Shake
j speare's time. Following a conference
| with Mrs. Stanford, permission was
given to build the new stage about
{ the regular one in the old assembly
| hall.
Mr. Bassett went on to tell anec-
I dotes of other student and faculty
j productions in which he took part,
| either as actor or director.

When he came to Stanford in 1901,
| he was called an instructor in Eng

speaking director. Gradually the
| speech and drama classes developed
j an interest of their own, and at the
| close of the decade of the 'twenties,
I were proclaimed as a separate divi
sion in the English department. It
| was recognized as a separate depart
! ment in 1938, following Bassett's re
i tirement.
I In 1938, the newly founded depart
! ment was assigned to the Memorial
Auditorium. Begun by Bassett alone,
the department now had 12 full-time
teachers.
Globe Stage Built
Reviewing his experiences in dra
matics at Stanford, Bassett told of
the Elizabethan play, "Knight of the
Burning Pestle," produced in 1903,
| which required the traditional set
! ting of the Globe Theater of Shake
j speare's time. Following a conference
| with Mrs. Stanford, permission was
given to build the new stage about
{ the regular one in the old assembly
| hall.
Mr. Bassett went on to tell anec-
I dotes of other student and faculty
j productions in which he took part,
| either as actor or director.
Lee Emerson Bassett is listed in the
: bawlout as '"professor emeritus," but
I there is no hint that he was the orig
! inal instructor and head of the
I speech and drama department, that
I he served at Stanford for 38 years,
t and that he will appear tonight in
| "The Truth About Blayds," Stanford
Players production of the famous
Milne play.
Bassett As Blayds
Bassett will portray Blayds. whose
j 90th birthday is being celebrated at
the opening of the play. Blayds is a
| world-famed poet, who begins to tell
j the story of his success in the first
' act, and whose death leaves the facts
to be revealed within the remaining
i acts.
According to Bassett, the part is a
fine one; according to previewers,
Bassett is equally fine. Perhaps ex
: perience is the key to his success, for
: he has played in and directed many
; student and faculty productions.
