## THE
						CASE OF THE MISSING MURDERER 
### BARNEY GUGEL 
(Part II)
After receiving the phone call from Chief Dugan, Shelton
Kwagmire, the famous private investigator, rushed over to the
home of Mrs. Hampstead H. Rumstead, who had been murdered
in her bedroom.
"Quick, give me the details," cried the detective as he entered
the bedroom.
"Mrs. Rumstead was murdered," answered the Chief helpfully,
"But we don't know how yet."
"H-m-m, my guess would be that she was shot; observe the
hole between her eyes and the powder burns on the nose."
"Kwagmire, you're a genius," exclaimed the Chief, amazed by
the detective's lightning mind.
"Of course the strange part of this murder is that no one could
have possibly got in or out of this room," continued the Chief.
"How's that?"
"Well, the door was locked from within, and the windows
were locked from without."
"But couldn't somebody have been in the room before she
entered?," suggested Kwagmire.
"But they couldn't have got out of the room; as I told you the
windows are locked from without."
"But the bedroom door was locked from within."
"Ah yes," returned Chief Dugan, "but the hall door beyond
was locked from without."
"Oh. Then how could Mrs. Hampstead get out of the bedroom
herself?" *
"She couldn't. Gee, I never thought of that."
"Obviously," reasoned Kwagmire, "There must be another
way out of this room. Probably a passage way behind the book
case. There'always is one, you know."
As he said that, he walked over to the bookcase and turned a
dial which was along side the case. The bookcase slid back and
disclosed a passage.
"I knew it," shouted the detective, "There was a man here
who was a Kentucky mountain moonshiner and spoke three
languages."
"Yes, observe this piece of yarn found on this splinter, shoul
der high. It is hand made, and is well worn, indicating that it
came from the elbow. Who else but a Kentucky moonshiner
would hold his elbow at a shoulder-high position? He naturally
got the habit from carrying a jug."
"But what about the three languages?"
"That I concluded because of the note here on the top of the
bookcase. It says, 'Ah left de korn drippins and da kichin tabel.' -
You see, de from the Spanish, and da from Russian and German."
"Kwagmire, you're—"
"Yes, I know. I'm a genius. But tell me who are the suspects?"
"She had only three friends. Dingley Peabody and Countess
Daphne Noahcownt, who yesterday both swore that they would
kill her. The other is Miss Euphrates Sullivan, who couldn't have
committed the murder because she was in New York, and won't
be back till this afternoon."
"I must see her immediately. The murdered is always the one
who couldn't have done it," screamed the detective as he changed
his disguise and ran out of the building.
"Kwagmire," exclaimed the Chief, "You're .... Oh what's the
use, he knows it already."
