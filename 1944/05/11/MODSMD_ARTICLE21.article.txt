# Hayes Favored Over Meds
## 
### ROGER CORMAN 
Bringing together the two top
| teams of the mural Softball loop, the
j feature tussle on today's sked pits
unbeaten Hayes Hall against also
unbeaten Mod School. If Smoke
Morrison can produce a little fire on
i Ihe mound for Hayes, the hall squad
should take this one, but if not. the

( Meds should neutralize (apologies to
1 Hunter and Gugel) Hayes effectively.
This is today's schedule:
Garfield vs. Gerona A.C,
Hayes vs. Med School
McKinley vs. Tyler
Lethal Eagles vs. Lincoln
Buchanan vs. Monroe
i Firehouse vs. Bye.
