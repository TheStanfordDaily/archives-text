# Tyler Hall Plans Circus Dance
## 
### 
Only two more days until ''The
circus comes to Stanford," as Tyler
Hall's plans fast take shape for one
of the most novel dances of the
quarter.
The Tyler men reassure their
guests that they will not have to
dress as performers or dance in saw
dust, but can come in their own com
fortable sport clothes and enjoy a
smooth floor.
The dancers will be surrounded by
the big tent atmosphere and during
intermissions they will have a chance
to fill up on authentic peanuts, pop
corn, and pink lemonade.
Gus Mazzon announces that spon
sors for the dance will be Mr. and
Mrs. Joseph Davis, Dr. Harold Bacon,
and Mr. and Mrs. Tostado.
