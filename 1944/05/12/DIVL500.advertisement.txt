TO "MA"
Though it's far that I roam
All my thoughts are of home
And the loved ones that I've left behind.
For you surely must know
That wherever I go
It is you that I'll have on my mind.
Every home that I see
Brings fond mem'ries to me
But dear Mother each one is of you.
Now I'm counting each day
Until I find a way
To return, and I hope they are few.
So as each day is done,
After each parting sun,
Turn to God and please ask Him for me,
That when I'm "over there"
I shall be in His care
'Til the day when the world's again free.
