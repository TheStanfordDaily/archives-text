Elections have come and gone, and some 800
persons turned up at the polls to make their se

To Barbara White and Barbara Upshaw and
the other winners, the best of wishes because
their jobs aren't easy. These students have been
elected to represent and hold together a group
of persons whose problems are constantly
changing.
To the election and nominating committees
a vote of thanks for handling the elections.
Their's was the hardest job of all.
And now that everything's over, it might be
