# COOPERATION DOES IT
## 
### 
Whenever you spend a nickel at the Stanford
Bookstore, you are handed a little piece of
paper; if you're careful, you saved it, and Mon
day will be the last chance to make your care
pay off.
And now that it is time to cash in on rebates,
it might be well to consider the fact that the
Bookstore is a cooperative enterprise. The more
the profit, the higher the percentage of rebate.
The next time you go to Paly to buy some
thing, think a minute before handing out your
money; maybe you can buy that something at
the Bookstoreâ€”and make those little slips bring
in more money.
