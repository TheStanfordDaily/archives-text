THE CASE OF THE MISSING MURDERER

(Conclusion)
Upon hearing that Miss Euphrates Sullivan,
the only person who couldn't have committed
the Rumstead murder, was arriving by train
from New York, Kwagmire, the great detective,
rushed down to the depot in order to see if he
could find out some information which would
cast light upon the case.
"Miss Sullivan, or may I call you Euphrates?"
asked the detective, "I suppose you have heard
that your friend Mrs. Hampstead H. Rumstead
was murdered last night."
"Yes, I was there when it happened."
"But I thought you were in New York."
"Oh, no, I just told everybody I was going. I
really didn't."
"Then, tell me, did you commit the murder?
. . . On second thought, don't answer that;
the question is too personal."
"It's not too personal. I couldn't have com
mitted the murder because" my gun wasn't
loaded."
"That is a relief," said the detective with a
sigh. "I couldn't conceive of you as the crimi
nal type. But tell me, and this is extremely im
portant, did you eat a hamburger on the day of
March 10, 1944?"
"Yes, I did."
"With or without?"
"Without."
Quagmire quickly jotted this down in his

little black notebook and continued the ques
tioning.
"Do you know of any Kentucky moonshiner
who speaks three languages?"
"Why, yes, that's my brother, but the family
never speaks of him."
"Then, with one more small bit of evidence
I will have the case solved," announced Kwag
mire, throwing the girl into a taxi. "We must
go to the Rumstead home immediately."
Back at the scene of the crime, the detective
asked Chief Dugan the all-important question,
"Was the murder committed at 12:05 or 12:06
a.m.?"
"At 12:06."
"Then the Rumstead murder case is solved.
The murderer is "
There was a shot, and all the lights in the
house went out. Tn a few moments the lights
were back on and Kwagmire lay on the floor.
He was dying.
"The murderer the great detective
groaned in agony. "The murderer is "
There was another shot. Again the lights
went out, and again they were back on in a few
moments, and again Kwagmire lay on the floor.
Only this time he was dead.
The police bungled along on the case for a
few weeks only to give it up for lack of evi
dence. The late Mrs. Rumstead's butlers and
housekeepers went to work in a defense plant,
Euphrates Sullivan opened an arsenic factory,
and Chief Dugan took a year's leave of absence
from the force in order to come to Stanford to
study criminology under Professor Gordon
Davis. Dugan may be seen daily from 12 to 1
hiding behind a palm tree on Inner Quad.

"Do you know of any Kentucky moonshiner
who speaks three languages?"
"Why, yes, that's my brother, but the family
never speaks of him."
"Then, with one more small bit of evidence
I will have the case solved," announced Kwag
mire, throwing the girl into a taxi. "We must
go to the Rumstead home immediately."
Back at the scene of the crime, the detective
asked Chief Dugan the all-important question,
"Was the murder committed at 12:05 or 12:06
a.m.?"
"At 12:06."
"Then the Rumstead murder case is solved.
The murderer is "
There was a shot, and all the lights in the
house went out. Tn a few moments the lights
were back on and Kwagmire lay on the floor.
He was dying.
"The murderer the great detective
groaned in agony. "The murderer is "
There was another shot. Again the lights
went out, and again they were back on in a few
moments, and again Kwagmire lay on the floor.
Only this time he was dead.
The police bungled along on the case for a
few weeks only to give it up for lack of evi
dence. The late Mrs. Rumstead's butlers and
housekeepers went to work in a defense plant,
Euphrates Sullivan opened an arsenic factory,
and Chief Dugan took a year's leave of absence
from the force in order to come to Stanford to
study criminology under Professor Gordon
Davis. Dugan may be seen daily from 12 to 1
hiding behind a palm tree on Inner Quad.

THE CASE OF THE MISSING MURDERER

(Conclusion)
Upon hearing that Miss Euphrates Sullivan,
the only person who couldn't have committed
the Rumstead murder, was arriving by train
from New York, Kwagmire, the great detective,
rushed down to the depot in order to see if he
could find out some information which would
cast light upon the case.
"Miss Sullivan, or may I call you Euphrates?"
asked the detective, "I suppose you have heard
that your friend Mrs. Hampstead H. Rumstead
was murdered last night."
"Yes, I was there when it happened."
"But I thought you were in New York."
"Oh, no, I just told everybody I was going. I
really didn't."
"Then, tell me, did you commit the murder?
. . . On second thought, don't answer that;
the question is too personal."
"It's not too personal. I couldn't have com
mitted the murder because" my gun wasn't
loaded."
"That is a relief," said the detective with a
sigh. "I couldn't conceive of you as the crimi
nal type. But tell me, and this is extremely im
portant, did you eat a hamburger on the day of
March 10, 1944?"
"Yes, I did."
"With or without?"
"Without."
Quagmire quickly jotted this down in his

little black notebook and continued the ques
tioning.
"Do you know of any Kentucky moonshiner
who speaks three languages?"
"Why, yes, that's my brother, but the family
never speaks of him."
