# Carnival Will Climax Big Con Home Drive
## 
### 
An evening of fun for the big kiddies will climax next week's drive for
the little kiddies at the Convalescent Home when the sophomores present
their annual carnival in the Pavilion Friday night from 7:30 to 11:30, ac
cording to Charrnian Kolar, chairman.
The carnival will consist of concessions sponsored by various living

groups which will feature games of
skill and chance. Admission to each
booth will be a 10-cent ticket. These
tickets will be on sale at the Carnival
and all proceeds will go to the Con
Home.
Penny-Guessing Game
The main feature of the carnival
will be a guessing concession. A
glass bowl filled with "Copper Coins
for Con Home Kiddies," which will
be donated during the week, will be
on display, and for a 10-cent ticket
nnyone may guess the number of
pennies in the bowl.
At the end of the evening the
number of coins will be announced
by Blossom Parke, chairman of the
copper coins collection, and the per
son guessing the most nearly cor
rect number will be awarded a prize.
Stanford "Gayway"
Other concessions at the carnival
will include a taxi dance, a water
bagging booth, fortune telling, a nail
pounding booth, and several con
cessions selling cokes, ice cream, and
other refreshments.
Every concession will be set up by
the living group sponsoring it after
the original construction of the
booths has been completed. The car
nival representatives in each living
group will meet next week with Miss

Kolar to discuss the final plans for
the concessions.
All for the Con Home
"The main purpose of the carnival,
outside of providing fun for every
one, is to earn money for the Con
Home," said Miss Kolar. ''All living
groups are trying to keep their ex
penses as small as possible, so that
the carnival will be a success and
as much money as possible will be
contributed to the Con Home."
Students are reminded that this is
a no-date affair, and that everyone is
invited and urged to come, to have
a good time, and to benefit the Con
Home.
Committee chairmen for the car
nival are Claire Kester, concessions,
with Marianne Supple helping her
in women's halls J. D. Williams in
men's halls, and Jean Richards in
sororities. Ed Luce is head of fi
nance, Merrill Steele of construction
and lighting, Chris DeLap of clean
up, and Rolf Westley of police.
