Since D day—invasion day on the continent
—is not very far off, the enemy radio stations
are hard at work trumping up false dates about
the Allies' invasion. It's quite interesting to lis- ]
ten to the average broadcast.
Reports from Britain tell us that the German
radio is busy nightly trying to get the peasantry
and partisans to declare themselves about their
underground activities. Apparently — and we
wouldn't know about it if it did happen — the
ruse hasn't worked.
CALL IT "LEFTENANT"
Since the German radio cannot be heard on
the Pacific Coast, Radio Tokyo has kindly con
descended to broadcast an hour of German
propaganda every night. The crafty little yellow
"Aryans" term it"the German Hour."
They even go so far as to pronounce the word
Lieutenant—which they have in their language
—"Leftenant." We don't know who they think
they are kidding, because the word in German
is Leutnant," not too different from our word.
Anyway it all adds to the confusion and general
noise they call propaganda.
"OLD BLOOD AND GUTS"
The other night they dramatized General Pat
ton's London statement about the "Big Three."
Patton was acted out as an easy going, hearty,
sort of chap, easy to get along with, pleasant
to talk to. Well!
The Japs obviously don't know why we call
him Old Blood and Guts.' One of the reasons
is his fiery temper and hot-headedness and not
being too easy to get along with. Another thing,
Patton doesn't hiss his words and replace l's
with r's. Such as Engrand, United Sssstatesss
and Rosssssia.
"PREASE SRAM DOOR"
On another occasion, a Japanese sound man
(no pun intended) thought he was supposed to
read his cue on the radio script over the micro
phone- -this he did much to our amusement. The
play was about as dramatic as one of the morn-.
ing soap operas over the domestic networks.
The play came to the climax and then up steps
our sound man, quite boldly and said in best
high school English, "Please sram door here." i
