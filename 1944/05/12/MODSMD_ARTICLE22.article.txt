Looking up toward Bay Meadows
way, we find some very interesting
tacts and figures on the season to
date. This has been rather an off
season thus far, pertaining to favor
ites coming in the money and long
shots staying where they should be
—last. It has turned out just the
other way around. You can't win.
If you'll- recall, a horse by the
name of With Regards was built up
for a full two weeks before his race
and he was supposed to take it hands
down, without any trouble whatso
ever. But God's graces were not upon
him that day, and the jockey with
fcit "don't worry boss, I'll hold him
uack" spirit was up on the nag. Over
was bet on him that day and
he saw mud in his eyes all the way
around the track. Experts calmly
t xplained, "He was just out for the
t xercise."
In the longshot side of the picture
we saw a horse by the name of The
Whale, who breezed home to pay off
a tidy sum of around 69 potatoes,
and that ain't hay in anyone's lan
guage. But it's sort of hard to bet
on a winner like that, BEFORE THE
RACE.
Taking a peek at the different
jockeys' records out at the Meadows,
we find Woodhouse on top of the list
with 27 wins out of 133 rides. Not
bad at all. He has also brought in
16 horses to place and the same
number to show. Following close on
his heels is Adkins with 23 winners,
17 place horses, and 16 in the show
money. When those two riders are
up you have an even chance of cash
ing in—providing they're on a fair
horse.
