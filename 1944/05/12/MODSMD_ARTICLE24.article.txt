# Union S-M-Leads As Howling Opens
## 
### 
The bowling leagues got off to a
fine start Wednesday night when six
teams rolled their balls down the
alleys. Two teams, Granada 2 and
the Roble Rustics defaulted.
High game of the evening was
made by Spick Fawcett of the 3B
Bees. Jean Watson of Ventura and
Marge Troy of the Union Splits and
and Misses followed with 166 and
165 respectively.
The Union Splits and Misses came
out on top winning all three of their
lines against the 3B Bees, and Ven
tura won two out of three against
Madrono.
