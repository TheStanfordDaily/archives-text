# We Concentrate on Vitamins, Forget Proteins, Says Carlson

### 
Following his Tuesday evening speech on '"Questions Science Can't
Answer, and Who Can Answer Them," Dr. Anton J. Carlson, president of
".he American Association for the Advancement of Science, spoke Wednes
day night on the topic "Some Footnotes on the Problem of an Adequate
Diet for Man."
He emphasized the fact that the prevalence of malnutrition in the United

States comes as a direct result of
ignorance of proper foods.
"In spite of the work done by our
doctors, nutritionists, schools, col
leges and universities in spreading
:he vital facts on correct nutrition, it
is a fact that the exaggerated and
artistic lying of the magazine, news
paper, and radio advertisements (for
vitamin pills) exerts a far greater
influence on the American people."
Protein Deficiency
Dr. Carlson said that in concen
trating on vitamins and minerals in
our food intake today, we completely
forget about the all-important item
of proteins. He added, "I have seen
whole populations undermined by
mass malnutrition, and it is true that
when protein dificiency hits a people,
:t hits the widest of any other kind
of food deficiency."
He attacked the human being's
ignorance in correct nutrition by
showing a slide illustrating kernels
of dried corn from each of which a
field mouse had taken only the germ
snd left the rest; "and man," said Dr.
Carlson, "eats the rest and leaves the
vital germ." The instinct for obtain
ing the correct kind of food is com
mon in animals and in infant hu
mans, he said; but added that it
>ems to have been educated out of
us or submerged by the time we are
adults."
Enriched Bread?
Our fondness for white bread, he
indicated, can certainly not be found
ed on knowledge of its vitamin con
tent. Modern bread companies add
a few vitamins to their product and
call it "enriched," he announced,

"whereas it is not enriched! It is
starved in comparison to the orig
inal wheat grain."
"I have seen Americans shed actual
tears to see the Russians eat their
'miserable' black breadâ€”which is
whole grained; it is the Russians who
should feel sorry for us. The fallacy
of the superiority of white bread
arose," he added, "as a matter of
social distinction. In earlier days
only the well-to-do could afford to
buy it, and it gave them something
that poorer people did not have."
In conclusion, Dr. Carlson illus
trated the widespread consciousness
of vitamins with slides of advertise
ments for well-known brands from
all of which he was able to find some
exaggeration or falsehood concern
ing the miraculous effects of the par
ticular brand or the detrimental re
sults to the human being if he did not
take the vitamin in that "quick, easy
form."
