## War Picture Satisfactory 
### 
CRY 'IIAVOC'—Now playing at the
Stanford Theater.
M-G-M's latest war picture is an
almost successful attempt at reviving
"So Proudly We Hail," with the story
of 13 more glamorous nurses biv
ouacked on Bataan. This movie lacks
the sentimental touch of the former,
but effects an even exchange of start
—Ann Sothern, Margaret Sullivan,
Joan Blondell, Marsha Hunt, Fay
Bainter, Diana Lewis, and newcomer
Ella Raines are all a little better than
adequate in their parts.
A restraint that is usually lacking
in contemporary war pictures is used
in the horror scenes—it's realistic but
it's not gory. Only sour note: The
lovely man that is breaking the
hearts of the assembled nurses and
the friendship of two of them re
mains only a name and a voice
throughout the picture. Things are
tough even in Hollywood!
The story is an old one, unless you
ignored the 1942 newspapers. The
nurses, volunteers all, take their
stand against the possibilities of ma
laria, starvation and bombs; their
problems are abruptly solved when
the Japs appear in person. The char
acterizations of the nurses are all in
teresting and typically American.
"The Whistler," who does nothing
but whistle the same tune you can
hear on your radio any Sunday,
lurks around corners and tries to
prove, in a gruelling 45 minutes, that
"man can't evade his destiny."
—Mac Vicar
