No, Tyler Hall doesn't guarantee
any real, live elephants, but no ele
phant would be an asset on the dance
floor anyway.
The decorations at the Tyler
Dance from 9 to 1 this Saturday night
will be definitely reminiscent of a
circus however. The ceiling deco
rated with canvas and lots of gay,
bright-colored streamers, will pro
vide the roof for the big top.
Behind the refreshment booth a
clown will add to the atmosphere
created by the pink lemonade, pea
nuts, and popcorn that he is serving.
In keeping with these war times,
the music will be provided by a
phonograph. But it will be far su
perior to mere circus music, and will
range from dreamy waltzes to boogy
woogy.
Dancers don't need to worry about
dressing as clowns or trapeze per
formers themselves, but can come
wearing regular sportclothes.
