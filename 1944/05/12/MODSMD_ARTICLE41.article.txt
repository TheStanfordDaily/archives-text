The SCU wolves are at last getting
on the ball, as indicated by the rush
on the phone booths in Enema. Dur
ing the first weeks they were de
serted. but now if (he present in
crease continues it may be necessary
to place reservations for calls two
weeks in advance.
A plaintive note was introduced
by a couple of incidents recorded in
Company C.
"Room 437, remove that pin-up
girl," said the bull-board recently.
"Please, sarge," came the reply,
"that's my wife." The edict on pic
tures of scantily dressed women also
caused consternation in another
quarter.
"What about this one," wailed one
G.I., "of my baby daughter?"
Gray Has Problem
Charlie Gray of the ERC has a
strange problem. He recently dis
covered that of his grammar school
chums, one is in Alcatraz, one in
Sing-Sing, and one in another jug.
Charlie is in Encina, and wonders
which of them all has the worst deal!
G.l.'s in the audience got a kick
out of one sequence in Danny Kaye's
''Up in Arms."
"Geez, we didn't have nothin' like
this in the last war," remarked one
old dogface, looking down at the lus
cious Hollywood belles lounging
around on the decks of a troop trans
port headed for the South Seas.
"Nothing like it in this war either!"
his chum commented. The truest re
mark about the war so far issued
from the film center.
Flavin Gets Prize
An item of interest to some men in
the unit appeared in last week's
"Time." Martin Flavin, father of a
soldier in this unit, was awarded the
Pulitzer Prize for his recent novel
of American life, "Journey in the
Dark." This book was originally
published as a Harper's prize novel
j.nd has been acclaimed as an ex
ceptional work. We congratulate
Pfc. Flavin on his father's note
worthy achievement.
