# Supermen Reveal Secret; Sacks, Texans Win Title
## 
### MIKE SULAK 
In the national physical efficiency test given early this quarter, most of
us were well pleased to get over the avei-age. Not so with some of the SCU
supermen.
May we present Sgt. Frank Livak, unit champ on these tests. The slender
Vermonter piled up an astounding total of 685 out of a possible 700 points.

►Among the champ's eye-opening
feats were 18 pull-ups, 14 burpees,
73 squat jumps, and 90 sit-ups.
Gerhard I Runner-up
Runner-up is the L.A. strong boy,
Norm Gerhardt, with 675 points, and
then in order: Ken Allan, 662;
George Lutz, 631; Milford Blackwell,
Francis Maher, and Art Bushing.
Maher, an Ohio Irishman, proved to
be the best time-killer of all, racing
the 300 in 35 seconds and covering
the 100 with a human cargo in 18
seconds.
Your awed reporter approached
this group of muscle gentlemen to
inquire about the secrets of such
prowess. A consensus of their state
ments reveals the following perti
nent 'acts:
Favorite training apparatus, G.I.
bunk.
Favorite exercise, "chinning at the
bar."
Softball Starts
The "C" Co. softball activities
were inaugurated Wednesday at the
Sunken Diamond. Winners of their
initial tilts were the Sad Sacks and
the Texans. Steady twirling by Lee
Sheftell and timely batwork by Red
Tanner and Russ Toye gave the
Sacks a 7-5 nod over the stubborn
Chow Hounds.
In the other contest, marred by
faulty fielding on both sides, the
Texans piled up 18 tallies to 12 for
the Fourth Platoon. Jim Share's
I round tripper with three men on
highlighted the slugfest.
Tom Sweeney's touted Jap Trans
; lators remained firmly entrenched at
the top of the "A" Co. circuit by
| virtue of a 10-4 pasting handed to
i the E.R.C. Boasting a "murderers'
row" and the stellar pitching of
George Denzene, the Japs have a
record of two victories and are un
beaten.

supermen.
May we present Sgt. Frank Livak, unit champ on these tests. The slender
Vermonter piled up an astounding total of 685 out of a possible 700 points.

►Among the champ's eye-opening
feats were 18 pull-ups, 14 burpees,
73 squat jumps, and 90 sit-ups.
Gerhard I Runner-up
Runner-up is the L.A. strong boy,
Norm Gerhardt, with 675 points, and
then in order: Ken Allan, 662;
George Lutz, 631; Milford Blackwell,
Francis Maher, and Art Bushing.
Maher, an Ohio Irishman, proved to
be the best time-killer of all, racing
the 300 in 35 seconds and covering
the 100 with a human cargo in 18
seconds.
Your awed reporter approached
this group of muscle gentlemen to
inquire about the secrets of such
prowess. A consensus of their state
ments reveals the following perti
nent 'acts:
Favorite training apparatus, G.I.
bunk.
Favorite exercise, "chinning at the
bar."
Softball Starts
The "C" Co. softball activities
were inaugurated Wednesday at the
Sunken Diamond. Winners of their
initial tilts were the Sad Sacks and
the Texans. Steady twirling by Lee
Sheftell and timely batwork by Red
Tanner and Russ Toye gave the
Sacks a 7-5 nod over the stubborn
Chow Hounds.
In the other contest, marred by
faulty fielding on both sides, the
Texans piled up 18 tallies to 12 for
the Fourth Platoon. Jim Share's
I round tripper with three men on
highlighted the slugfest.
Tom Sweeney's touted Jap Trans
; lators remained firmly entrenched at
the top of the "A" Co. circuit by
| virtue of a 10-4 pasting handed to
i the E.R.C. Boasting a "murderers'
row" and the stellar pitching of
George Denzene, the Japs have a
record of two victories and are un
beaten.
