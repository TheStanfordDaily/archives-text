At the Front. White Soldier: "Where you going?"
Negro Soldier: "Ah'm leavin'! Somebody might get hurt
aroun' heyeah!"
Now, lough. Laugh at the joke about the frightened Negro
soldier, who speaks a language no one ever spoke. But pardon
us if we don't laugh with you.
We have seen how close the snicker at a "Sambo" joke is
to the Master-Race propaganda of the enemy. We have seen this
deadly venom smuggled into the student's vulnerable spot: the
idea that anything's fair if it's funny—humor is above criticism.
Are we over-dramatizing? There is no drama as stark as that
of millions of our cousins and friends poised for the invasion blow
—these are dramatic times. We too have our responsibilities,
on this multi-national campus.
We have seen the Army's film, "The Negro Soldier." We
saw Negro American Crispus Attucks, hero in 1776. We saw
Dorie Miller, hero in 1942, and thousands more.
We have also seen American boys die from the bayonet-jabs
of the troops of Hitler and Tojo (who falsely claims to fight for
the colored peoples) and we have heard the Tokyo Radio broad
cast incidents of race-discrimination in America—knowing that
these incidents broadcast to Eastern peoples help kill our men
and women.
We have watched outbreaks of race-hatred slow down war
production; and management, labor, and government fight to
maintain unity on the home front.
Finally, we have seen the genuine humor of a Paul Robeson,
a Lena Home, a Langston Hughes, or a Mark Twain.
Some people say: "But poking fun at Negroes is no worse
than poking fun at anyone else." We answer: "The Negro people
have been oppressed—is slapping a sun-burned man on the back
no worse than slapping anyone else?" Humor, like everything
else, has a definite relation to life; it can be good, indifferent—
or poisonous!
So . . . You'll pardon us if we can't laugh at the "Sambo"
corn, the "Abie" corn, or the "Silly WAAC" corn. That kind of
laugh carries the distant echo of people dying.
And today's scene at the front is:
White soldier: "Let's go, brother!"
Negro soldier: "Let's go!"
At the Front. White Soldier: "Where you going?"
Negro Soldier: "Ah'm leavin'! Somebody might get hurt
aroun' heyeah!"

aroun' heyeah!"
Now, lough. Laugh at the joke about the frightened Negro
soldier, who speaks a language no one ever spoke. But pardon
us if we don't laugh with you.
We have seen how close the snicker at a "Sambo" joke is
to the Master-Race propaganda of the enemy. We have seen this
deadly venom smuggled into the student's vulnerable spot: the
idea that anything's fair if it's funny—humor is above criticism.
Are we over-dramatizing? There is no drama as stark as that
of millions of our cousins and friends poised for the invasion blow
—these are dramatic times. We too have our responsibilities,
on this multi-national campus.
We have seen the Army's film, "The Negro Soldier." We
saw Negro American Crispus Attucks, hero in 1776. We saw
Dorie Miller, hero in 1942, and thousands more.
We have also seen American boys die from the bayonet-jabs
of the troops of Hitler and Tojo (who falsely claims to fight for
the colored peoples) and we have heard the Tokyo Radio broad
cast incidents of race-discrimination in America—knowing that
these incidents broadcast to Eastern peoples help kill our men
and women.
We have watched outbreaks of race-hatred slow down war
production; and management, labor, and government fight to
maintain unity on the home front.
Finally, we have seen the genuine humor of a Paul Robeson,
a Lena Home, a Langston Hughes, or a Mark Twain.
Some people say: "But poking fun at Negroes is no worse
than poking fun at anyone else." We answer: "The Negro people
have been oppressed—is slapping a sun-burned man on the back
no worse than slapping anyone else?" Humor, like everything
else, has a definite relation to life; it can be good, indifferent—
or poisonous!
So . . . You'll pardon us if we can't laugh at the "Sambo"
corn, the "Abie" corn, or the "Silly WAAC" corn. That kind of
laugh carries the distant echo of people dying.
And today's scene at the front is:
White soldier: "Let's go, brother!"
Negro soldier: "Let's go!"
