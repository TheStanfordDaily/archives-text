# 'Truth About Blayds' Rated Bang-up Job in First Night
## 
### 
Last night on the stage of the
Little Theater the Stanford Players
did a bang-up job—with some "ma
jor" exceptions—of interpreting A.
A. Milne's "The Truth About
Blayds." Concerned with the pre
death confession of a famous Vic
torian poet, Oliver Blayds, to the
effect that he had stolen the poems
published as his own from a former
roommate, the play shows the reac
tion of the various members of the
family to this bombshell which
threatens their security.
Notable in their parts were Sally
Stocker as Isobel, Blayds' youngest
daughter; L. E. Bassett as a very
convincing 90 - year - old Blayds;
Moofje Faris as the eldest daughter,
Marion; and Norman Philbnck as
A. L. Royce.
F. Cowles Strickland with' superb
timing, glass polishing, nervous
tremors, ataxic gait, and an odd
manner of sitting down injected
some humor into the play. How
ever, those who knew Mr. Strick
land could never forget that he was
Mr. Strickland.
Edmond Maher and Mary Lou
Patton as the grandchildren also
aided in the production, both warm
ing up in the last two acts.
Acting highlight comes at the end
of the second act where Sally Stock
er—as the maiden sister —pours out
her embittered feelings in such a
manner that you are left marveling
on the edge of your seat. It is sel
dom that one has the privilege of
seeing such a convincing perform
ance.
L. E. Bassett, in his short role as
Blayds, did more than a remarkable
job of interpreting a 90-year-old
man near death. The audience burst

! into new applause as Sally Stocker
| wheeled him back on the stage for
j curtain calls. Dr. Bassett was con-
I sistently excellent in his perform
ance, and deserves high commenda
j tion.
Moofie "I love the theater" Faris
also did a splendid job of interpret
! ing her part. She was convincing as
a befuddled but worshipping wife
! (Mr. Strickland's). Those among the
; audience who compared her to Billie
Burke were unjust. Her interpre
j tation was her own.
For those of you who care to be
| entertained highly, and amused
| slightly, "The Truth About Blayds"
! is an excellent way to spend an eve
' rung. It makes for a good study of
! rationalization.—Willis
