with these words slowly dying out
behind the closing curtain and the
brightening lights the audience knew
the first act of "The Truth About
Bladys" was over, and a shifting
movement broke the absolute silence
in which the onlookers had sat.
Three minutes behind everyone
else, the Daily reporter came out of
the reverie cast by the play and
thought. "Aha! My opportunity to
find out the "in" on what the general
opinion may be"; so amid cries of
"smoking in the outer lobby only,"
he walked briskly to the outer lobby
to stand behind beople's backs—any
thing for an interview.
"The entire cast is extremely well
done" .... "I like the stage setting;
I think it's exceptional" .... "Chee,
ain't dat Sally Stocker wonnerful?"
. . . . "Strick's certainly doing a god
job" .... "That picture of Oliver
Blayds is really good" .... "Don't
you think the man who takes the
part of Oliver Blayds, what's his
name—Lee E. Bassett—isn't he ex
pressive?" .... "Well, I'll tell you,
that's a blankety-blank good play"
.... and so on, ad infinitum.
The cast of "The Truth About
Blayds" is to be congratulated, judg
ing from the results of the Daily
