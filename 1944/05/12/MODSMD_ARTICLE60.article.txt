# RECORDS ON REVIEW
## 
### MARTY KLEIN 
At the outset of this column, we make the following promises. A recorc
will be called just that; never a disc, platter, waxing, or anything else to
add confusion to an already confused world. Frank Sinatra will never t*
called the Voice or Bing Crosby's son. and we won't even mention a banc
bogged down with four tenor saxophones out of respect to censorship law

on the type of language used in
public documents.
We will try to give an idea of the
records that you can get hereabouts
without too much trouble and an idea
of what bands you can go to listen
to without falling asleep on the
dance floor.
Tonight, hitch-hike, take the bus,
or use any patriotic means you can,
but get down to San Jose. Harry
James will hold forth in the Civic-
Auditorium and his is one band that
can really hold forth. James himself
possesses one of the most beautiful
trumpet tones in the business.
Highbrow critics have listened to
him and have professed wonderment
as to why he hasn't invaded the
ranks of classical music, but this
would probably be a greater blow to
dance music than a gain to sym
phony.
His slow numbers are thoughtfully
arranged and you can bet that at
least one chorus in every number
will feature a trumpet solo with a
sustained background of string^
A good example of this style is
shown in his recording of CHERRY,
which he will probably play tonight.
If you don't have this on your phono
graph, your loudspeaker hasn't had
a chance to make music. On the jump
numbers the solid beat of the rhythm
section drives the whole band.
The saxophones phra.se beautifully,
and knowingly or unknowingly the
blend is strongly reminiscent of
Jimmie Lunceford in the late '30's.
This effect is strongly accented in
JUMP TOWN, which he has also re
corded, and is strictly tailored for
his style.
When we last saw him in January
at the Hollywood Palladium, there
were two perfectly good French horn
players sitting in complete boredom
buried under a welter of trombone
ensembles. Whether he has recog
nized the possibility of blending
these two horns with a trombone to
form another tone section, or has left
them to their fate remains to be seen
tonight.
After you hear him Friday you'll
probably want to follow him up to
the City on Saturday and Sunday.
