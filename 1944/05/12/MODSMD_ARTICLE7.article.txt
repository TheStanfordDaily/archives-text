WASHINGTON (UP) â€”Selective Service tonight stayed the induction,
effective tomorrow, of all 1-A registrants 26 and older and ordered a
review of their classification with a view to deferring a bulk of them as
long as military developments permit.
Draft Director Lewis B. Hershey, outlining the new regulation, said that
manpower needs of the armed forces probably can be met through Dec. 1
from the pool of men under 26 and those reaching the draft age each month
But he warned that men in the upper age bracket who "persi>t in not
participating in essential work" will be called in the interim.
