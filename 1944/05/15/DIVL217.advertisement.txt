JUDGE DEL MUTOLO
There Should Be No Change
As citizens and as members of the legal profession, we cannot emphasize too strongly
the necessity of retaining Judge Del Mutolo'on the Superior Court bench. He has the
deservd respct, admiration and esteem of every member of the Santa Clara County Bar (
Association, the men who are constantly in attendance in his Court and who are the most
competent to pass on the merits of the respective candidates.

We have in Judge Del Mutolo a fine humane character, young enough to be of long
service to the community, old enough to have acquired that mature common sense judg
ment so necessary on the Bench, a man of exemplary habits, and a constant student with i
such outstandig legal ability that lawyers nd laymen alike are assured of thorough
competent hearing of the matters before him. None of his decisions have ever been re- !
versed by higher courts.
The people certainly want no change in the Superior Court, and we feel it our duty,
both individually and as representatives of the Santa Clara County Bar Association, to :
urge everyone to vote for Judge Del Mutolo on next Tuesday. May 16th.
DO NOT BE MISLED: J
Judge Del Mutolo's opponents are not running for re-election.
Both are justices of the Peace and will still retain their re
spective offices if they are not elected to the Superior Court.
