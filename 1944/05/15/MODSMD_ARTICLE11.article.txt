# Glass Bowl Holds Copper Coins for Con Home Kiddies
## 
### 
A large glass bowl will be placed
on the Cellar corner this afternoon,
and everyone who goes by this bowl
is urged to drop in a penny for the
benefit of the Con Home, according
to Blossom Parke, chairman of the
Copper Coins for Con Home Kiddies
Drive.
The pennies dropped into this bowl
will all go toward the support of
children at the Con Home, and this is
one more way that students and
faculty will be able to join in this
week's big Con Home Drive.
At the end of the week the pennies
will be carefully counted, and then
the bowl will be taken to the Sopho
more Carnival, Friday night in the
Pavilion, where everyone will have
a chance to guess how many pennies
there are. The winner will receive a
prize.
