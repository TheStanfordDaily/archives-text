THE CON HOME DRIVE, the annual big push that belongs to
Stanford alone, gets underway today. To most students the Con
Home is a place "where a lot of little kids go to get better."
Actually, there's a lot more to the Con Home than just that.
Here are some of the facts.
The Convalescent Home, unique in being a campus charitable
institution, is outfitted with 80 beds, each of which is filled by a
youngster for about a three-month recuperative period. These
patients come from the Stanford Lane Hospital in San Francisco
and range in age from 4 to 12.
Parents of the children pay as much as they can toward up
keep. The cost of maintaining a bed for one month is approxi
mately $70, which includes the best in mental, recreational, dental
care, etc. Mrs. Ruth Spande Atwood is the superintendent.
And those are the facts about the present setup.
To go back to the beginning, we would have to start in 1919
when the original endowment was made by Mr. and Mrs. Timothy
Hopkins, who were inspirational in making the home what it is
today. Their initial push developed into a Stanford tradition —
the annual drive for Con Home support.
The machinery is set up. All that is needed is a little fuel to
run on—fuel in the form of a couple of dollars out of our pockets.
