# Campus Opinion

To the Editor:
How about clarifying this corsages-for-carnpus-dances ques
tion? Last quarter another soldier asked the opinion of the Daily
as being familiar with Stanford tradition in the matter and got
no reply.
We really would like to know, as colleges differ in their |
customs.
P.E.
(EDITOR'S NOIE: Many apologies U> the soldier who last quarter asked
the Daily's opinion on the matter: the letter must have gotten lost.
And now the question. The general campus sentiment is expressed i
quite well in the Frosh Bible:
"Except for the Senior Ball, corsages for campus dances went out when
the depression came in."
And since there is tit he no Senior Ball this year, it seems safe to assume
that the Junior-Senior Prom is its equivalent. All of which meansâ€”only
one corsage to go.)
To the Editor:
The recent events of Spring Sing and A.S.S.U. election strike
me as being of such high caliber that I want to commend the stu
dents who planned and participated in these activities. Intelligence
and sportsmanship marked these ventures in government and
recreation: intelligence in the sense of "ability to acquire and use
skills and knowledge new to the participants," and sportsmanship
illustrated by singers who barely failed of honorable mention,
but insisted "it was worth trying, and we'll keep on singing to
make a good glee club in our house, if it takes all quarter."
May one suggest that a little of the music this Friday carried
over to the sedate student assembly on election day would have
added to the fun and stimulated that intangible "Stanford spirit"
which music can always summon?
Sincerely,
NEWCOMER.
