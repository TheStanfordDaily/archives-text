# Tony, of Women's Gym, Tries To Please 'Ladies'
## 
### AVIE QUINN 
Everyone knows Tony at the
women's gym! Ke calls himselT a
common working man and says he
has no time for "publicity." Tony, oi'
Portuguese descent, has been work
ing around his "ladies' gym" for 15
years.
He has a son, Tony Junior, who
works here at Stanford, and a mar
ried daughter. When asked about
himself Tony says "go home, scram,
sho sho baby." Pie is 50, has dark
eyes, and white streaks running
through his black hair. He wears a
favorite straw hat, and is always
seen with a smile on his brown face.
Too Many Ladies
Tony spends a busy day from S
to 5 keeping the women's gym in
general working order. He feels re
sponsible for everything connected
with the gym. He tries to please all

of the "ladies" and to keep them i
happy, but he maintains there are i
too many of them. He whistles as he j
cleans the swimming pool, marks the :
hockey field, volleyball court, and ,
searches for his markers which are '


"TONY"
forever sinking down into the dirt.
Tony weeds the pansies in the
gym, scrubs the floor after every
dance, hangs pictures, uncrates
boxes, and does, in general anything
that has to be done around the
: building and the grounds.
; Two Pet Irritations
His two pet irritations are (1)
girls who leave their bikes on the
sidewalk in front of the gym, so that
he can't sweep, and so that they fall
over them, and (2) the trouble he
has keeping the lawns like the Presi
dent's lawn (he has a dreadful time
these days because there are so many
golf classes and they are followed
every afternoon by softball games.) |
Tony has ,a truly marvelous dispo
sition and spends his time pleasing
the staff of 25 at the gym. He main
tains "that you have to be careful
how you treat these people" and so
j when he picks flowers for one person,
he feels that he must pick them for
everyone in sight.
Vegetables, Bunnies, Chickens
Tony owns his own place in Moun
tain View and lives 'there with his
wife. He has a marvelous vegetable
garden of which he is quite proud.
His bunnies and his chickens are his
constant joy, and when anyone wants
nice fresh brown eggs from grain-fed

chickens Tony has them. He says
he's glad that he has a strong back
and can work hard.
Tony calls all of the faculty '•teach
er." He refers to one of the personnel
as that "black-haired teacher."
"The Lad\ She Drown"
In the fall Tony picks up the
leaves, one by one, in front of the
gym and puts them carefully into a
sack. In summer he says the pool
temperature keeps him guessing.
Some of the swimming classes like
it cold and some of them like it hot.
He replies "the girls they like it
warm, I iix it."
One day at the pool Tony observed
a swimmer in the shallow water who
thought that she was drowning.
Tony's comment on the situation was
"'I know it is none of my business but
I the lady she drown."

Some of the swimming classes like
it cold and some of them like it hot.
He replies "the girls they like it
warm, I iix it."
One day at the pool Tony observed
a swimmer in the shallow water who
thought that she was drowning.
Tony's comment on the situation was
"'I know it is none of my business but
I the lady she drown."
Everyone knows Tony at the
women's gym! Ke calls himselT a
common working man and says he
has no time for "publicity." Tony, oi'
Portuguese descent, has been work
ing around his "ladies' gym" for 15
years.
He has a son, Tony Junior, who
works here at Stanford, and a mar
ried daughter. When asked about
himself Tony says "go home, scram,
sho sho baby." Pie is 50, has dark
eyes, and white streaks running
through his black hair. He wears a
favorite straw hat, and is always
seen with a smile on his brown face.
Too Many Ladies
Tony spends a busy day from S
to 5 keeping the women's gym in
general working order. He feels re
sponsible for everything connected
with the gym. He tries to please all

of the "ladies" and to keep them i
happy, but he maintains there are i
too many of them. He whistles as he j
cleans the swimming pool, marks the :
hockey field, volleyball court, and ,
searches for his markers which are '


"TONY"
forever sinking down into the dirt.
Tony weeds the pansies in the
gym, scrubs the floor after every
dance, hangs pictures, uncrates
boxes, and does, in general anything
that has to be done around the
: building and the grounds.
; Two Pet Irritations
His two pet irritations are (1)
girls who leave their bikes on the
sidewalk in front of the gym, so that
he can't sweep, and so that they fall
over them, and (2) the trouble he
has keeping the lawns like the Presi
dent's lawn (he has a dreadful time
these days because there are so many
golf classes and they are followed
every afternoon by softball games.) |
Tony has ,a truly marvelous dispo
sition and spends his time pleasing
the staff of 25 at the gym. He main
tains "that you have to be careful
how you treat these people" and so
j when he picks flowers for one person,
he feels that he must pick them for
everyone in sight.
Vegetables, Bunnies, Chickens
Tony owns his own place in Moun
tain View and lives 'there with his
wife. He has a marvelous vegetable
garden of which he is quite proud.
His bunnies and his chickens are his
constant joy, and when anyone wants
nice fresh brown eggs from grain-fed

chickens Tony has them. He says
he's glad that he has a strong back
and can work hard.
Tony calls all of the faculty '•teach
er." He refers to one of the personnel
as that "black-haired teacher."
"The Lad\ She Drown"
In the fall Tony picks up the
leaves, one by one, in front of the
gym and puts them carefully into a
sack. In summer he says the pool
temperature keeps him guessing.
