# Chappie-Daily Baseball Game

### 
To the members of the Daily Edi
torial Staff:
Up until a few years ago it was
customary that a battle to the death
on the baseball diamond be held
each spring quarter between the
Daily and the Chaparral. Since there
is no good reason why this custom
should pass into oblivion, the Chap
arral Staff publicly challenges the
Daily to attempt to scrape together
nine or ten people in order to meet
the formidable Chaparral horse
hiders in a game of skill, namely
baseball.
We will even condescend to allow
the Daily to name the time and place
providing that the game be played on
a Friday afternoon. Furthermore, we
will provide an umpire so that the
decisions will be impartial.
We dare the Daily to accept this
challenge! The Chappies.
