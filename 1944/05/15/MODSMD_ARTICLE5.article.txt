LONDON (UP)â€”All rail traffic
through the Brenner Pass from Ger
many to Italy has been halted by al
lied bombing, reconnaissance photo
graphs showed today, as two waves
of planes from Britain blasted north
ern France to resume the Allies' pre
invasion aerial blitz after its first full
day's break since April 17.
Heavy cloud cover which closed
over Europe Saturday, together with
gale winds and a sharp drop in' tem
perature. grounded all Britain based
heavy bombers for at least a 24-hour
period, breaking the record assault
on Europe after its 27th shattering
day. The attack on France, carried
out late in the day was the first air
activity since Saturday afternoon.
Photographs of Saturday's raid on
the Brenner Pass by heavy bombers
based in Italy showed there was a
70-foot gap in the rail bridge near
Avisio which has completely cut all
supply traffic on the vital line feeding
Adolf Hitler's Italian armies now
under assault by the Allies.
