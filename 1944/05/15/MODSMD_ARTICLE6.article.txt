LONDON (UP)— H. G. Wells, in a
limited exclusive edition of his life
time observations entitled "Forty-
Two to Forty-Four," warned the
world today not to execute Adolf
Hitler because it would give the evil
spirits in Germany a national martyr
behind which to hide.
"There must be no killing of Hit
ler." the 77-year-old novelist, his
torian. and philosopher wrote. "We
should be making a present to the
real evil spirits in Germany—we
should be giving them just the na
tional martyr behind whose legend
they can shelter from the wrath to
come."
