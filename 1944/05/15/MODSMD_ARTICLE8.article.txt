## 
### 
The Choral Music Class conducted
by D. Sterling Wheelwright held a
discussion last .Thursday night on
the studies they have made of this
year's Spring Sing, offering a num
ber of suggestions that will be turned
in with the report Blossom Parke,
chairman of the sing, will make. Aid
ing in the discussion were several
of the song leaders in this year's
sing.
The suggestions were offered in the
interest of making the Spring Sing
a bigger campus musical event with
larger student participation and bet
ter trained choruses competing.
It was suggested by the class that
two or three living groups join forces
to make one chorus, thus shortening
the program without cutting down
the range of student participation.
Under this plan there would be only
10 or 12 really good choruses com
peting for the winning cups.
The class also suggested that a
trophy, honorable mention, or some
recognition should be awarded to
the best humorous entry.
Finally the class decided to make
a study of the manner in which other
universities conduct their sings in
an effort to improve our own.
