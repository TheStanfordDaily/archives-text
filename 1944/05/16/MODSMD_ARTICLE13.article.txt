### BARNEY GUGEL 
One of the couples who were making a house-to-house cam
paign last night for the Con Home off-campus drive told us about
their experience at one of the homes in Palo Alto and we thought
we'd pass the story on.
The two had rung the doorbell of an old, rather ill-kept house
and were waiting for somebody to answer the door. In a few
moments the door opened and they were greeted by a six or seven
year-old child.
"Is your mother or father in?", asked our super-salesman.
"Ma's busy but she be here in a minute. Whatcha doin'?"
"Oh, we're collecting money."
"000000, a bill collector," screamed the child, slamming the
door defiantly.
The two students were a bit taken back by this, but continued
to ring the doorbell. Again the door opened and the little one
poked out his head.
"Ma's finished now. Here she is."
"What kin I do for ya?", asked the mother in a mid-western
accent.
"We're collecting money for the Stanford Convalescent Home.
It's a local institution, out on the campus, which takes care of chil
dren recovering from a serious illness."
"I'm a feared ya come ter tha wrong place. My old man gits
War Bonds up ta tha plant an we've agiven dough ter tha Red
Cross. Can't see no reason to give sometin to sometin ya never
heared of before."
"Let me tell you more about it," interrupted one of the students,
stubbornly." Each year, the Stanford students have a drive to
raise enough money to pay for the complete maintenance of four
beds at the Stanford Convalescent Home. It costs about S7O a
month for each bed. We hold an off-campus drive each year to
acguaint the people in the Palo Alto area with the good work that
the Con Home does."
"Wal, what do they do?"
"The Con Home takes care of children from 4 to 12, mostly
from San Francisco, who are recovering from some serious ail
ment. The children receive the best possible care and the parents
are only required to pay what they can afford, so you can see that
it's certainly a worthwhile cause."
The woman disappeared into the house and returned in a
second with 50 cents.
"I can't give ya no more, but I shure wish I could. My, I never
seen two youngsters so enthused with any thin' in my life."

door defiantly.
The two students were a bit taken back by this, but continued
to ring the doorbell. Again the door opened and the little one
poked out his head.
"Ma's finished now. Here she is."
"What kin I do for ya?", asked the mother in a mid-western
accent.
"We're collecting money for the Stanford Convalescent Home.
It's a local institution, out on the campus, which takes care of chil
dren recovering from a serious illness."
"I'm a feared ya come ter tha wrong place. My old man gits
War Bonds up ta tha plant an we've agiven dough ter tha Red
Cross. Can't see no reason to give sometin to sometin ya never
heared of before."
"Let me tell you more about it," interrupted one of the students,
stubbornly." Each year, the Stanford students have a drive to
raise enough money to pay for the complete maintenance of four
beds at the Stanford Convalescent Home. It costs about S7O a
month for each bed. We hold an off-campus drive each year to
acguaint the people in the Palo Alto area with the good work that
the Con Home does."
"Wal, what do they do?"
"The Con Home takes care of children from 4 to 12, mostly
from San Francisco, who are recovering from some serious ail
ment. The children receive the best possible care and the parents
are only required to pay what they can afford, so you can see that
it's certainly a worthwhile cause."
The woman disappeared into the house and returned in a
second with 50 cents.
"I can't give ya no more, but I shure wish I could. My, I never
seen two youngsters so enthused with any thin' in my life."
One of the couples who were making a house-to-house cam
paign last night for the Con Home off-campus drive told us about
their experience at one of the homes in Palo Alto and we thought
we'd pass the story on.
The two had rung the doorbell of an old, rather ill-kept house
and were waiting for somebody to answer the door. In a few
moments the door opened and they were greeted by a six or seven
year-old child.
"Is your mother or father in?", asked our super-salesman.
"Ma's busy but she be here in a minute. Whatcha doin'?"
"Oh, we're collecting money."
"000000, a bill collector," screamed the child, slamming the
door defiantly.
