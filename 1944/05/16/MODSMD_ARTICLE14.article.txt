# Views on Your War

About the best news to come out of the war over the weekend
is that of the Allies moving ahead through the Gustav line in
Italy. News reports state the new allied advance is five miles wide
and one mile deep. Free French forces, fighting with the Anglo-
American troops, report they have cut the Cassino-Formia road,
a vital lateral highway connecting German bases on the two main j
roads to Rome.
Tank-led allied troops punched their way several miles beyond j
the little town of Castelforte, a German bastion which was one of
six more towns and villages to fall before the offensive. The Nazis
are being ousted from dug-in defenses and caves by allied flame :
throwers. 4
THE ALLIES WISE UP
At last the Allies are getting wise.
When American and English soldiers were dying as they were
along the Italian front it's about time they did something â€”inhuman
or not.
The more war shortening devices such as the flame throwers,
pin-point precision bombing, concentrated barrages, the better
off we'll be. Sherman was right, and the less we have of it the
sooner we'll be able to spend more Mother's Days at home.
