# Monroe Shuts Out Buchanan On Pitching of Bob Forbes
## 
### DICK BLOCK 
Baseball has at times been defined
as an occupation wherein if a young
man is bold and strikes out for him
self. he is a very unpopular fellow.
This statement was substantiated last I
Thursday when the Monroe Boozers i
played Buchanan.
In view of the situation the roughs
with the bright new red and white
teeshirts decided to save the arm of
regular pitcher Joe Slier and send ,
Fob Forbes, ex-collegiate tennis star
lor the Farm, to do the hurling hon
ors. Forbes did pitch, in fact he ,
pitched so well Buchanan had only ,
one man on base the entire evening. |
Bob laced 16 batters in five innings, ;
allowed no hits, and one walk. The j
fielding was also excellent; Monroe ;
won 5-0. Moral: The entire Bu- ;
chanan team was very unpopular '
with each other.
With the addition of a new crystal
ball to the sports stafT prognosti

gating kit, we shall once again try to
predict the results of tonight's intra
mural competition.
The first game to enchant the evil
genius, who does most of our pre
dicting, Ls the Legal Eagles against
the Meds. Prediction No. 1: Meds;
Prediction No*. 2: Hayes over Gar
field by the Morris(on) Plan; Pre
diction No. 3: Tyler over Buchanan;
Prediction No, 4: Gerona over Me-
Kinley; and Prediction No. 5: Fire
house over Lincoln.
