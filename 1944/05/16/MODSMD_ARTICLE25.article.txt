' ALLIED H.Q., NAPLES (UP) —
Led by inspired Frenchmen, allied
armies have smashed completely
through the formidable Gustav lino
for gains up to seven miles in four
days of a crushing offensive that has
won them (50 square miles of forti
fied area, 17 towns, and 2,000 cap
tured Nazis, it was disclosed last
night.
Still fighting desperately, the Ger
mans were being hammered back to
their next, and fihal, line of defense
in western Italy—the Adolf Hitler
line. Their lateral communications
on the Gustav front were cut to rib
bons; their headquarters at Ausonia
had been lost to the French; and at
least one of their divisions—the 71st
Infantry—was believed knocked out
ol the battle. Gen. Alfonse Juin's
French have opened a gap three
miles wide at one point only 25 miles
from the Gustav line, and were beat
ing at the outposts of the Hitler line,
on the narrow south side of the Liri
valley, four and a half miles south
east of BritLsh-held San Angelo.
The British, pouring a large num
ber of tanks across the Rapibo river
above its confluence, the Liri, had
driven a 2V4-mile wedge into the
valley and are "attacking beyond re
paired infantry positions,'' a front
dispatch said.
