# Club Discusses Foreign Schools
## 
### 
The International Club presented a
j panel discussion on foreign univer-
I sities Sunday. Members of the club
who have attended foreign universi
ties gave forth with unusual sched
i ules and curricula.
The panel didn't just confine itself
; to foreign universities, and every
| thing from the Turkish radio to the
social life of a German university
was discussed.
The question of an honor code was
brought up and the answer was that
| as most of the students lived off the
j campus, no student government was
necessary; and further that most of
! the students in foreign universities
! were older when they began their
college education.
The club welcomed some new
members to the gathering, among
whom was a boy from Iceland and
one f rom Jamaica.
