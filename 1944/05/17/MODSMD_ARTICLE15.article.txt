# HEY! WATER BOY!

### 
EVERY HALF HOUR today, from 2 to 6, army trucks will leave
from the Post Office full of Stanford students on the way to an
afternoon of labor at the Con Home. Donating transportation, the
Army nevertheless will not be responsible for anyone who falls
out enroute; keep your chins tucked in. Do not go to the Con
Home in a private car.
Labor Day at the Con Home is one of the Farm Traditions. It is
a matter of jeans, denim shirts, and old shoes—hoeing, scraping,
painting, coming home at night tired, knowing that the job isn't
done but that you have helped a little.
Tradition—spirit—is rather intangible. But if you want to feel
it in action, take a free ride to the Con Home, and work.—Dave
