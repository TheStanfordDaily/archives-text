# TURKEY AND ECONOMIC WARFARE

TURKEY'S dramatic action in cutting off all chrome supplies to
the Axis has underlined the significance of this country's trade in
the total war picture.
Lying between German-dominated Europe and Allied nations
and their supporters, Turkey occupies a geographic position which
has permitted trade—in varying degrees—with both sides, ac
cording to the National Geographic Society.
The amounts and direction of this commerce, as well as agree
ments regulating it, have been considerably affected by the loca
tion of the battlefronts and thee coursee of the war. During the
North African struggle and the German threat to the Suez Canal,
for example, the Mediterranean was practically closed to Turkish
traffic, with British and American goods unable to get through.
Trade with the Soviet Union, never very large, was paralyzed after
the German invasion in 1941. The chief commercial channel open
to Turkey, therefore, was overland into Nazi Europe.
The Germans, long the world's leading buyers and sellers in
Turkish markets, have received most of Turkey's wartime exports
to the Axis. They bought all the chrome shipped into continental
Europe. The Nazis also were given priority to purchase desired
materials, such as linseed and sesame, prized over other oil seeds
for high oil content.
To the Allies, with better resources elsewhere for most of the
Turkish exports, it was relatively less important to secure these
products than to have them denied the enemy.—Dave Davis
