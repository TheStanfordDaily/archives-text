SWEDEN seems to be getting herself in the jackpot lately by con
tinued shipment of ball bearings to Germany against the wishes
of the United States, Great Britain, and Russia.
Russia is a comparative newcomer to the diplomatic sgueeze.
A dispatch from Washington yesterday declared that Russia is
now cooperating with Anglo-American diplomats, reinforced by
the possibility of strong economic measures, to have Sweden cut
off all ball bearing shipments.
IT'S HIGH TIME
It's about high time something was done about this situation.
When the Eighth Air Force sent a group of bombers out to bomb
the ball bearing factory at Schweinfurt, Germany—it was ac
claimed as a brilliant tactical move.
And it was. As anyone who is familiar with machinery will
tell you, all high-speed eguipment—such as war machines—
operate either on roller bearings or ball bearings. Cut off the
supply of these bearings and you've crippled the enemy con
siderably
As a matter of fact the very bombers that knocked the Schwein
furt factory out of commission, were in essence functioning on
thousands of these bearings. That was the day we lost 61 of these
huge "Flying Forts" to flak and fighter opposition. Up to that
time it was the largest loss yet sustained by the Eighth Air Force
in one mission.
So it's high time the United States, Great Britain, and Russia
did something about it. And from the looks of things, the diplo
matic squeeze will be just the thing to stop ball bearing shipment
to Germany.
