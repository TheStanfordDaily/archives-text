PEARL HARBOR (UP) â€” Army,
Navy, and Marine aircraft subjected
Jaluit to a 240-ton aerial bombard
ment Sunday and Monday, Pacific
Fleet H.Q. announced today, and
there was every indication that
k American forces were determined to
hasten the downfall of Japan's re
maining bases in the Marshalls
chain.
It was by far the heaviest punish
ment meted to Jaluit or any other of
the beleagured atolls since American
forces invaded Kwajalein last Janu.-
ary 31 and followed it up with the
occupation of other atolls.
