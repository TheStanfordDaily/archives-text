# Acceptance

### 
To the Chappies:
Since you were brash enough to
publicly challenge the mighty Daily
Editorial Staff to a duel with bat and
ball — namely baseball —we accept
this chance to once more show Daily
superiority over the Chappie.
We'll meet you on the sunken dia
mond—the field of honor—one week
from this Friday at 4 p.m. Have your
seconds, participants, and doctors on
hand, or forever cringe before the
awful power or the Daily.
The Daily Edit Stall".
