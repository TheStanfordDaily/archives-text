### ROGER CORMAN 
A short time ago one of the San
Francisco Chronicle's many sports
I columnists commented that it was
about time for Stanford to realize its
mistake in regard to canceling inter
collegiate sports, and make plans
now for fielding.a football team next
fall.
Last quarter when we were cham
pioning this cause in this column we
would have approved wholeheart
edly, but conditions have changed
since then. The draft, in case the
Chronicle hasn't heard, has been
getting a little rough lately, and the
civilian men have been dropping
from campus like flies.
i The registrar's office estimates that
there were about 500 undergraduate
civilian men on campus at the be
ginning of the present quarter. Since
then, 2-A deferments have been can
celed, and a large number of students
have been reclassified, reducing the
enrollment still further,
When you consider that the 400 or
so men left are either 4-F, under 18,
jor awaiting induction, you can see
; what material we'd have to draw on
| if we actually did field a team.
From the question of man power
alone, not to mention lack of coaches,
transportation, and equipment, it's
plain to see that Dr. Tresidder was
right when he stated that inter-col
legiate sports are a wartime casualty
on the Farm unless some radical de
velopment provides an opening for a
change in policy.
