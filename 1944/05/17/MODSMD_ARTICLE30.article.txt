# Meteorology Training Class At NYU Delayed One Month
## 
### 
The extension by one month of the j
! class in meteorology training at gov- j
eminent expense which was to begin
j at New York University on July 7, j
j has been announced by the United j
! States Department of Commerce.
The delay will permit the inclusion i
! in the curriculum of topics in physics I
â€¢ and mathematics which are closely j
associated with dynamic meteorol
' ogy.
The course will consist of three
j 12-week quarters, separated by one
; week recess periods. During the first
i quarter instruction will be given in
j mechanics and heat, elementary cal- \
I cuius, and a review of algebra and
i trigonometry. This enlarged plan j
| makes it possible to modify the ecki- j
! cational requirements to high school j
! or college courses in advanced alge- !

bra and trigonometry, a college
course in physics or chemistry, and
satisfactory completion of three years
of college.
Physical requirements remain the
! same as were previously announced.
These scholarships pay full tuition
l for professional training in meteor
ology ,but do not include other ex-
I penses.
For further information, consult
the announcement on "University
Training at Government Expense,"
or write to the chairman of the
meteorology department of the uni
versity in which you are interested.
