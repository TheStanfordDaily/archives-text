### 
ALLIED H.Q.. NAPLES (UP)
British and Polish columns opened a
powerful, two-way attack to encircle
Cassino today and by nightfall had
closed the Nazis' shell-torn lifeline
to the city to less than two miles as
I Franco - American forces, slashing
through the last broken Gustav fort,
reached the Adolf Hitler line. ,
The Poles, described in irOnt dis
-1 patches as "blood mad" after being
! stalled for three days in the hills
i northwest of Cassino, resumed their
attack at dawn behind a heavy bar
rage and battled down the far slope
of the saddle connecting mountains
Cassino and Cairo striking for the
Via Casilina.
Once the British and Poles join
forces the German garrison at Cas
sino will be trapped and the city's
positive fall is assured after more
than three months of the hardest
fighting of the Mediterranean war.
