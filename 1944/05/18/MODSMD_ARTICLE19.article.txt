ROOSEVELT WILL NOT RUN
The greatest little mag west of the Farallones will make its ap
pearance in slightly over a week. The Spring Chaparral will not
only be bigger (32 pages) and better than ever, but will feature
an original joke written by the Daily's own Henrietta Nussbaum.
When asked about the prospects of the coming Chappie, Soph
ocles Schalk, orderly at Rosotti's Sanitarium stated, "The Browns
are a cinch to take the American League Pennant this year."
CALIFORNIA MAY BAN LIQUOR
It might be a good idea to drop over to the Soph Carnival Fri
day night as there will be a wide variety of concessions that prom
ise to be really good.
For instance, there will be taxi dancing for those who like to
dance with taxis; throwing hoops over ducks' necks—a real thriller;
throwing hoops at girls' legs which promises to be a smash suc
cess; and a Yogi show, featuring the famous Swami Reever.
Best of all, the money goes for a good cause, the Con Home.
HOW TO CHEAT AT BRIDGE
The Daily-Chappie baseball game may turn out to be a some
what one-sided event for we have it on good authority that the
Daily is stacking their team with stars of the men's softball league.
Not that this is unfair, but it must be remembered that two can
play the game as well as one. The "World Series" of the West
will take place at 4 p.m. a week from Friday in the Sunken Dia
mond.
