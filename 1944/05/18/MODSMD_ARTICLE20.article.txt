IT IS INTERESTING to note the mounting tension here at home
about the coming invasion. Reports in the daily newspapers show
the type of weather, the heights of tides on the invasion coasts,
the heights of tides along the shores of England, temperature and
other pertinent meteorological material necessary for the calcula
tion of D-day by the armchair strategists.
We made a statement sometime ago about the suspense being
difficult on the enemy as well as us here at home. Little did we
realize the truth of the statement.
ARGUMENTS ON D-DAY
Daily the papers, radio commentators and the man on the
street are all interested vitally about D-day.
It is not uncommon to be walking along the street and hear a
heated argument. It used to be one conclusion—the coming presi
dential election. Now it is one of two conclusions—the coming
election or "when are we going to walk in and show those Ger
mans what the score is?"
FOLLOW THE MAGAZINES
To those vitally interested—and we all are—it would be well
to follow the invasion plans with constant reading in some of our
current event magazines. They present perhaps a wider point of
view, a greater coverage of the whole picture as well as supplying
many photographs to substantiate their coverage.
