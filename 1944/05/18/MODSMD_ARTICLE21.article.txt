To the Editor:
Profiting by past experience, we would like to jump the gun
and ask all potential poster-snatchers to please refrain from taking
the beautiful Spring Show posters that were put up this week until
after the show. These posters were pretty expensive and repre
sent a lot of hard work by a lot of people.
So please lay off until after May 26 and 27 (which is only a
week away) and then they are yours for the taking.
Thank you,
Ellen Marcus,
Publicity Director.
