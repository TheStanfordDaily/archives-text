''When individuals from the United
States send kits to individuals in
Russia, they are making a friendly
gesture of good will which will help
to encourage cooperation between
our two great countries," a Russian
War Relief spokesman said in an
address before the War Board Auxil
iary meeting Monday.
Mrs. Niederhauser and Mrs. Silva
from Palo Alto spoke of the real con
tribution to good will made by the
sending of kits and Mrs. Silva point
ed out that the program is not one
of money collection but actually for
filling kits.
"The Russians have a real need for
needles and pins, which are pro
vided in the kits, because Russia has
not been manufacturing civilian
clothing for a long time, and needjes
are vitally needed to mend what
clothes the Russians have."
