# English Duo Achieves Excellent Voice Harmony
## 
### 
The English Duo—Viola Morris, soprano, and Victoria Anderson, contralU
— presented Tuesday evening a concert of ducts and solos to the series audi
ence in Memorial Hall.
Though higher pitched, the soprano's voice had also an alto quality, so
that the duo achieved a-blend remarkably homogeneous. And their phrasing

was well modulated; their enuncia
tion was clear; they kept precisely
together, and always on key. The
one flaw was occasional audible
breathing.
Their best selections were the first
group, lour 17th and 18th-century
duets ,by Schutz, Couperin, Wilbye,
and Purcell respectively. Each of the
three Handel numbers was also well
suited to the duo's style, and even
more so, "Le Cour de Ma Vie'' ol
Dalcroze.
Miss Morris' best solo was Schu
bert's '"Die Junge Nonne"; and Miss
Anderson's, the old English ballad
"Mv Man, John." Edward Mattos ac

|«eompanied at the piano, though sev
i eral songs were unaccompanied.
i "Waltzing Matilda" ended the
final group, and the last encore, "G
Dear, What Can the Matter Be?"
i concluded the program.—C. Cove>
