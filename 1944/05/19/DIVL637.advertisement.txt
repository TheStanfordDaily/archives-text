From Major Genera! McCoach
to the women of
Stanford University
No group of Americans is more deeply concerned
in this war than you young college women.
You know how much is at stake, what great
sacrifices are needed to assure victory. You
have seen young men with whom you have worked
and played, side by side, leavo to do their
part in insuring victory.
So when I tell you that the Army needs the
help of your eager minds and skillful hands,
I know you will not hesitate to continue
to stand side by side with those same
young men to speed their return.
A victorious future needs you.
