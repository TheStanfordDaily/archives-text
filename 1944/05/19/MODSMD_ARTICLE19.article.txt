# Cassino Falls; Climax Near
## 
### 
ALLIED HQ., NAPLES, May 18
I (UP). —Cassino, scene of 107 days
lof bitter house-.to-house lighting,
fell today to a brilliant encircling
i movement by British and Polish
I troops, while American forces swept
j through the port of Formia into the
I main defenses of the Adolf Hitler j
! line, driving within '57 miles of the j
Anzio beachhead.
A dispatch from the beachhead j
said that American troops hailed the j
| news of the fall of Cassino as mean- j
) iny the climax was near in Italy, and |
were aching for offensive action j
! themselves "to get it over with." |
1 The Germans, fearing an attack, ]
opened an artillery barrage and j
; swept the beachhead with search
| lights at every Allied move.
| Curtain Raised
(German broadcasts said the Al-
I lies had launched two "major thrusts .
i thrusts" on the beachhead which ap
| peared "the curtain raiser" of a gen
era lattack. In the Formia area, the
Germans said, "Allied attacks have
achieved a "certain material sue- ;
I cess," causing the Germans to with
draw to the Itri area, five miles to
j the west.)
An Allied communique revealed
j that Allied warships in the Gulf of
Gieta were laying down broadsides
j in support of the Americans driving
j along the coast who, in reaching
j Formia, seized the terminus of one
: of two lateral supply roads feeding
! the 1 litler line.
Along with Cassino, where Allied
i and Nazi soldiers fought for houses
j and even single rooms of houses un
| dor a nightmare of shells and bombs,
Monastery Hill was captured, while
1 the bulk of Lt. Gen. I{ichard Hei
drich's "Green Devil" First Para
| chutist Division, fighting stubbornly
j to the last, was destroyed in the Al
lied trap.
With their mountainous northern
j anchor thus torn loose, the Germans
in western Italy were plunged into
j a serious position as Allied troops
began assaulting their last fortifica
tions — the Adolf Hitler line —at
many points, and American troops
swept into the resort port of Formia.
