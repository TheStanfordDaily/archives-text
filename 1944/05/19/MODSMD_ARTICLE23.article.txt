The Daily is kind of hard to read in class today, isn't is?
he last time Stanford saw a paper this size was back in the
pring of '42 when Hal Shafer was editor. The old boys were
till around then, acting like a bunch of goons over at The Shack,
ut they spent a lot of time talking about joining the Flying
idians.
Shaf's gone now. But we decided to try to make the paper at
â€¢ast somewhat resemble the one he used to put out.
We had to get this one together in a hurry. The Ad staff
aid they would try to sell enough ads to make it big. And they
lid.
If five more Stanford students, five more with the spirit and
determination of those already on the business staff, would
oin the Daily staff, this big paper would be an everyday occur
ence. Think it over, won't you?
