After many months of bitter and hard fighting Cassino has
alien. This means much to the morale of the United Nations
as well as the morale of the soldiers who have been stop-gapped
for this long period of time by a bitter fighting enemy.
With the fall of Cassino goes the greatest bottleneck, stop
gap or whatever you may wish to call such an impediment,
since the Battle of the Marne.
The Battle of the Marne in the last war had the Allies stopped
cold and for a while it looked like the Franco-Anglo-American
combine was going to lose. Those were the days of General John
J. "Blackjack" Pershing. Nothing more need be said.
WHERE IS ALEXANDER?
The days of Cassino are the days of Sir Harold Alexander,
claimed by many, Allied and enemy alike, to be one of the
smartest strategists of our time. Even so, where has he been the
last five months? After his brilliant North African campaign it
is hard to reconcile such a failure as the Allied drive in Italy
with a man like Alexander. But, those days are gone.
The little town of Cassino has probably witnessed its last
battle. For 1900 years this little Italian town has been the battle
ground of many men who have risen and fallen. Yet—Cassino
always managed to gather itself from the rubble and go on
serving a useful purpose as a community.
Today, reduced before the fury of man-made war machines
o[ the twentieth century, Cassino is a mass of crumbled masonry
and debris—no longer recognizable as having once been inte
gral parts of buildings.
With the fall of Cassino, the Benedictine monastery above
the city was on the receiving end of a concentrated Allied ar
tillery barrage. In describing the barrage, AP's Richard Mc-
Murray says:
HAIL OF EXPLOSIVES
"For sheer concentration of shelling, the barrage probably
surpassed that of Thursday night when the Allies opened their
offensive with the greatest hail of explosives yet seen in the
Mediterranean theater or in Western Europe in this war."
Elsewhere in the now active Italian theater of war, American
troops fought into Castellonorato, four miles from the important
seaport of Formia.
The Americans took Scauri from the coast. The Germans
were routed from all poscitions south of the Liri river. The
French in the center advanced two and a half miles in pursuit
of the beaten and disorganized 71st division.
The uneasy calm continued on the Anzio beachhead below
Rome.
A War Department announcement yesterday morning said
that our anti-aircraft batteries in the vicinities of Nettuno and
Anzio had shot down 491 and possibly 511 German planes in
the last three months. That's good shooting.
To all this activity in Italy the German High Command apolo
getically declared in an official communigue: "Detachment
movements are being carried out according to plan."
