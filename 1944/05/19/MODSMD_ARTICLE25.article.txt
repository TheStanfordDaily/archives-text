# RECORDS ON REVIEW
## 
### MARTY KLEIN 
Re-hashing Harry James, San Jose, et al.. will not prove any
more fruitful than a civilian trying to hitchhike, but a word in
passing would not be amiss. A word in his passing would prob
ably be more correct, because the Harry James of last Friday
night was a new but not better one.
From the occasional drift of music over the din of some 10,000
people, we gathered that the blend of violins left much to be
desired, the phrasing was poor in the saxophones, and the
general enthusiasm worse.
Downtown there are some new releases which turn out to be
very interesting when all the difficulties are considered. Haymes
and a choir background turn out "Gertie from Bizerte" to scoop
the industry.
Dirty Gertie on Wax
The recorded version is cleaned up and it is more important
historically than musically. Its danceable, arranged so well that
at times you don't miss the orchestra, and worth having so you
can say you heard the famous piece. Turn it over and you'll
find "There's a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere,"
biggest sheet-music seller of 1943, but not the best.
Digging through their "file and forget drawers," Columbia
releases Harry James' no-violin band and Frank Sinatra in "A
J.itllo Sir€?ot in Singapore" and "Every Day of My I.ife." Both

sides are good. "Street" features a solo by James with muted
trumpet but bogs under with too much rhythm. Frank sings with
out his new innovations and does very well.
A aaah —Frankie!
"Life" has a beautiful trombone solo reminiscent of T. Dorsey,
but Frank's vocal is pitched above his range and he struggles
through a few of the top notes with not much to spare. The
arranging is good and so is the piece itself and the record should
do well.
The Ink Spots moan and groan through "Somewhere I'll Meet
You Again" and "I'll Get By." Just in case you haven't had cour-i
age to listen one of their records through, here's their format.!
Every and any piece has a vocal, a chorus talked by some guy
whose range hovers between a fog horn and steamboat whistle,
then another chorus to make sure that you're still there. If you
don't like the Spots, stay way, brother, stay way.
A Good Man
Les Brown, who never got his due share of popularity, records
"Bizet Has His Day"and "A Good Man Is Hard to Find." "Bizet"
introduces some contrapuntal writing in dance time on an old
Bizet theme with a last chorus that sounds as if Glenn the Miller
stepped up and took over. The brass blend and phrase beauti-!
fully and the number is very danceable. "Man" is a talk-through
by Butch Stone and may amuse you. 'Nuff said.
Speaking of G. Miller, Victor has pressed eight of his best
sides into one album. Included are "American Patrol," "Tuxedo
Junction," "PA 6-500," "Stardust," and four other sides which
we'll go into next time because none can be passed over lightly.

You Again" and "I'll Get By." Just in case you haven't had cour-i
age to listen one of their records through, here's their format.!
Every and any piece has a vocal, a chorus talked by some guy
whose range hovers between a fog horn and steamboat whistle,
then another chorus to make sure that you're still there. If you
don't like the Spots, stay way, brother, stay way.
A Good Man
Les Brown, who never got his due share of popularity, records
"Bizet Has His Day"and "A Good Man Is Hard to Find." "Bizet"
introduces some contrapuntal writing in dance time on an old
Bizet theme with a last chorus that sounds as if Glenn the Miller
stepped up and took over. The brass blend and phrase beauti-!
fully and the number is very danceable. "Man" is a talk-through
by Butch Stone and may amuse you. 'Nuff said.
Speaking of G. Miller, Victor has pressed eight of his best
sides into one album. Included are "American Patrol," "Tuxedo
Junction," "PA 6-500," "Stardust," and four other sides which
we'll go into next time because none can be passed over lightly.
Re-hashing Harry James, San Jose, et al.. will not prove any
more fruitful than a civilian trying to hitchhike, but a word in
passing would not be amiss. A word in his passing would prob
ably be more correct, because the Harry James of last Friday
night was a new but not better one.
From the occasional drift of music over the din of some 10,000
people, we gathered that the blend of violins left much to be
desired, the phrasing was poor in the saxophones, and the
general enthusiasm worse.
Downtown there are some new releases which turn out to be
very interesting when all the difficulties are considered. Haymes
and a choir background turn out "Gertie from Bizerte" to scoop
the industry.
Dirty Gertie on Wax
The recorded version is cleaned up and it is more important
historically than musically. Its danceable, arranged so well that
at times you don't miss the orchestra, and worth having so you
can say you heard the famous piece. Turn it over and you'll
find "There's a Star-Spangled Banner Waving Somewhere,"
biggest sheet-music seller of 1943, but not the best.
Digging through their "file and forget drawers," Columbia
releases Harry James' no-violin band and Frank Sinatra in "A
J.itllo Sir€?ot in Singapore" and "Every Day of My I.ife." Both

sides are good. "Street" features a solo by James with muted
trumpet but bogs under with too much rhythm. Frank sings with
out his new innovations and does very well.
A aaah —Frankie!
"Life" has a beautiful trombone solo reminiscent of T. Dorsey,
but Frank's vocal is pitched above his range and he struggles
through a few of the top notes with not much to spare. The
arranging is good and so is the piece itself and the record should
do well.
The Ink Spots moan and groan through "Somewhere I'll Meet
You Again" and "I'll Get By." Just in case you haven't had cour-i
