The new battle area in Netherlands New Guinea, opened up
by Allied landings at Hollandia and Tanahmerha bays, and the
new landing at Wadke, lies along one of the world's least de
veloped and normally least traveled shores. For war's objectives,
it is significantly located, however, with reference to the Japa
nese island of Pauau, 800 miles northwest, and Truk, 1,050 miles
northeast. The nearest point in the Philippines is 1,150 miles to
the northwest.
Hollandia port is the last stop on the eastward stretch of
the Netherlands' 3,000 miles of East Indies possessions. Only
about 20 miles farther east is the borderline that separated Neth
erlands from British administration of the big New Guinea island.
Tanahmerha Bay is 30 miles west of the town of Hollandia,
on the northwest arm of Humboldt Bay. It is linked with the
battered Japanese base and port by a jungle and mountain
framed road.
Both the Hollandia and Tanahmerha bays cut sharp indenta
tions in the north-central New Guinea coast, forming earlike
cape projections on either side of a flat-topped peninsula. A
number of sandy beaches, spaced between the rocky points, are
found along the sea-facing coast of the peninsula. Although
three Japanese air fields are reported in the region between the
two bays, much of the peninsula is high and rugged, with inte
rior mountain peaks reaching up nearly 8,000 feet. At the base
of the peninsula, a long, narrow and irregular lake spreads.
The Tanahmerah and Hollandia indentations offer the best
harbors in the neighborhood. Tanahmerah is broad and deep,
although hampered in its usefulness by rocks and reefs and
limited in anchorage because of heavy swells along the open
shore. The Hollandia inlet has better protection, and is the only
area of Humboldt Bay open to big ships.
The prewar town of Hollandia, which dispatches say the
Japanese had turned into a major air base, had a population of
several hundred natives and a few whites. It was a district
headquarters under Netherlands administration, with a small
•mission, an auxiliary post office, and a trading station. Little
developed economically, this region was known to the outside
world chiefly for its export of the skins of beautiful birds of
paradise, a traffic which had been restricted by the Netherlands
government in recent years. Before the war, regular ship serv
ice was every four weeks.
Many native villages are scattered along this coastal section
of Netherlands New Guinea. More civilized and settled than
the wild tribes of the interior, their inhabitants, nevertheless,
were in the habit of abandoning their homes when threatened
by sickness or local disturbances.
The people of the Tanahmerah Bay region are rated among
the most developed of the neighborhood. Normally they carry
on a litle trade and raise such subsistence crops as sago, sugar
cane, sweet potatoes and coconuts. Around Humboldt Bay,
in spite of the closer contacts with the outside world, the natives
are understood to be still in a somewhat wild state.
Japanese invasion of Manipur has opened up a new World
War front in a long remote Native State at the back door of India.
Manipur lies far inland, about halfway along the broad moun
tain border land that separates Burma from India. Roughly ob
long in shape, it bulges on the east into Burma and on the west
into the British province of Assam. Its wartime significance is
in the fact that through its wide central valley runs a road that
leads to Allied rail and highway lines between India, northern
Burma, and China.
Imphal, threatened by the Japanese, is Manipur's capital and
reported supply center for Allied troops in northern Burma,
and is situated about 35 air miles west of the Burmese frontier.
A group of villages with a prewar population of more than
85,000, it sprawls in the heart of the Manipur valley.
The chief road of the state (the only one of consequence from
Burma) follows the wide trough between the mountains; past
Imphal it proceeds northward to Kohima, thence northwest to
meet the Chittagong-to-Sadiya railway.

framed road.
Both the Hollandia and Tanahmerha bays cut sharp indenta
tions in the north-central New Guinea coast, forming earlike
cape projections on either side of a flat-topped peninsula. A
number of sandy beaches, spaced between the rocky points, are
found along the sea-facing coast of the peninsula. Although
three Japanese air fields are reported in the region between the
two bays, much of the peninsula is high and rugged, with inte
rior mountain peaks reaching up nearly 8,000 feet. At the base
of the peninsula, a long, narrow and irregular lake spreads.
The Tanahmerah and Hollandia indentations offer the best
harbors in the neighborhood. Tanahmerah is broad and deep,
although hampered in its usefulness by rocks and reefs and
limited in anchorage because of heavy swells along the open
shore. The Hollandia inlet has better protection, and is the only
area of Humboldt Bay open to big ships.
The prewar town of Hollandia, which dispatches say the
Japanese had turned into a major air base, had a population of
several hundred natives and a few whites. It was a district
headquarters under Netherlands administration, with a small
•mission, an auxiliary post office, and a trading station. Little
developed economically, this region was known to the outside
world chiefly for its export of the skins of beautiful birds of
paradise, a traffic which had been restricted by the Netherlands
government in recent years. Before the war, regular ship serv
ice was every four weeks.
Many native villages are scattered along this coastal section
of Netherlands New Guinea. More civilized and settled than
the wild tribes of the interior, their inhabitants, nevertheless,
were in the habit of abandoning their homes when threatened
by sickness or local disturbances.
The people of the Tanahmerah Bay region are rated among
the most developed of the neighborhood. Normally they carry
on a litle trade and raise such subsistence crops as sago, sugar
cane, sweet potatoes and coconuts. Around Humboldt Bay,
in spite of the closer contacts with the outside world, the natives
are understood to be still in a somewhat wild state.
Japanese invasion of Manipur has opened up a new World
War front in a long remote Native State at the back door of India.
Manipur lies far inland, about halfway along the broad moun
tain border land that separates Burma from India. Roughly ob
long in shape, it bulges on the east into Burma and on the west
into the British province of Assam. Its wartime significance is
in the fact that through its wide central valley runs a road that
leads to Allied rail and highway lines between India, northern
Burma, and China.
Imphal, threatened by the Japanese, is Manipur's capital and
reported supply center for Allied troops in northern Burma,
and is situated about 35 air miles west of the Burmese frontier.
A group of villages with a prewar population of more than
85,000, it sprawls in the heart of the Manipur valley.
The chief road of the state (the only one of consequence from
Burma) follows the wide trough between the mountains; past
Imphal it proceeds northward to Kohima, thence northwest to
meet the Chittagong-to-Sadiya railway.
The new battle area in Netherlands New Guinea, opened up
by Allied landings at Hollandia and Tanahmerha bays, and the
new landing at Wadke, lies along one of the world's least de
veloped and normally least traveled shores. For war's objectives,
it is significantly located, however, with reference to the Japa
nese island of Pauau, 800 miles northwest, and Truk, 1,050 miles
northeast. The nearest point in the Philippines is 1,150 miles to
the northwest.
Hollandia port is the last stop on the eastward stretch of
the Netherlands' 3,000 miles of East Indies possessions. Only
about 20 miles farther east is the borderline that separated Neth
erlands from British administration of the big New Guinea island.
Tanahmerha Bay is 30 miles west of the town of Hollandia,
on the northwest arm of Humboldt Bay. It is linked with the
battered Japanese base and port by a jungle and mountain
framed road.
