# LET'S FACE IT

### CHLOE 
..It's spring, boy. It's half-way in May, time for a breath between mid
terms and a coke between classes, tanning time, beering time, take-it-easy
and-spit-on-the-Bawlout time. It's Stanford's favorite time of year, and
here on the Fawm the hearts of the hoary undergrads who remember when
there was a moon and a sun and at least equal numbers of both sexes are

humming the old familiar schmaltz'
of Stanford's favorite song. "That's
Stanford in Spring." So what? say
the wise ones. It doesn't go like that
any more. The song is tho same, but
the words are different, all right,
all ri;>ht. What's there about spring
anyway? This spring, for instance.
Well, lor instance—
$ $ itf $
The circus came to Paly the first
week of the quarter, and half of
Stanford was there, chewing spun
sugar and buzzing around on the
l'erris wheel. And there are the base
ball games up the Row in the day
light the government saves lor after
dinner. And the navy medics, who
crowd into booths at Wilson's and
prop their books on their lettuce and
tomato sandwiches at lunch time.
Drop into the Cellar at 3 in the after
noon, where the Libe-weary congre
gate to hear the juke-box and assim
ilate chocolate frosts.
Have a look at Dr.P's 10 o'clock
class in the opera, crammed with
music-lovers and Popper-lovers in
equal parts. See the hopeful little
girls shivering in their bright-col
ored cotton dresses. And the Inner
Quad, with its glowing islands of
pink and scarlet geraniums. Wave
at the Nurses' Aides skimming down
Palm Drive to the Hospital on their
bicycles.
* * *
Then there was the Spring Sing,
500 girls and Ric Supple; the Monroe
boys with their derby and coke
bottle act. and little Nan Tillson giv
ing out with the immortal "Belt's."
The navy planes going home in the
evening, winking their red and green
lights, and the blimps from Moffett
Field dipping their noses into the
high winds of an afternoon. The Spe
cial Delivery man with his cheerful
good-mornings, and Pete in the
Cellar presiding over the candy bars
and bottles of shampoo.
Remember the Junior Water Car
nival—Johnny Fulton's smooth per
formance with the starting gun and
Dick Fayram defying death from the
high board. Con Home Day tempo
rarily rained out, but a good time

| for all, in their jeans and plaid shirts,
j at the Women's Gym, with Jean Lev
j inson and the Spring Show tribe
J making the entertainment go.
* * #
Sundays out in the hills, with a
' loaf of bread and a quart of beer,
j and the funny things that fall out of
| trees. The bridge games at Spring
Show rehearsals, and tho big brown
I and white dog that appears every
! night to take in Janice Shaughnessy's
{ dancing. The good looking navy of
j ficer who gets off the bus at Lagunita
j corner every day, where his two
little boys are waiting for him. Pig-
I tails and bare legs, raincoats and
1 poison oak. The men in uniform who
come back to see how things are go
ing, and the rows of convertibles in
front of the iJrive-in on Friday night.
So those are the words this year.
That's Stanford in spring, half-way
in May 1944. The hoary undergrads
are learning about the simple life,
and how much fun a lot of swell
people can make out of times that
| are pretty thin in lots of ways. Leave
jus face it. We're in luck.

Drop into the Cellar at 3 in the after

Have a look at Dr.P's 10 o'clock
class in the opera, crammed with
music-lovers and Popper-lovers in
equal parts. See the hopeful little
girls shivering in their bright-col
ored cotton dresses. And the Inner
Quad, with its glowing islands of
pink and scarlet geraniums. Wave
at the Nurses' Aides skimming down
Palm Drive to the Hospital on their
bicycles.

Then there was the Spring Sing,
500 girls and Ric Supple; the Monroe
boys with their derby and coke
bottle act. and little Nan Tillson giv
ing out with the immortal "Belt's."
The navy planes going home in the
evening, winking their red and green
lights, and the blimps from Moffett
Field dipping their noses into the
high winds of an afternoon. The Spe
cial Delivery man with his cheerful
good-mornings, and Pete in the
Cellar presiding over the candy bars
and bottles of shampoo.
Remember the Junior Water Car
nival—Johnny Fulton's smooth per
formance with the starting gun and
Dick Fayram defying death from the
high board. Con Home Day tempo
rarily rained out, but a good time

| for all, in their jeans and plaid shirts,
j at the Women's Gym, with Jean Lev
j inson and the Spring Show tribe
J making the entertainment go.

Sundays out in the hills, with a
' loaf of bread and a quart of beer,
j and the funny things that fall out of
| trees. The bridge games at Spring
Show rehearsals, and tho big brown
I and white dog that appears every
! night to take in Janice Shaughnessy's
{ dancing. The good looking navy of
j ficer who gets off the bus at Lagunita
j corner every day, where his two
little boys are waiting for him. Pig-
I tails and bare legs, raincoats and
1 poison oak. The men in uniform who
come back to see how things are go
ing, and the rows of convertibles in
front of the iJrive-in on Friday night.
So those are the words this year.
That's Stanford in spring, half-way
in May 1944. The hoary undergrads
are learning about the simple life,
and how much fun a lot of swell
people can make out of times that
| are pretty thin in lots of ways. Leave
jus face it. We're in luck.
..It's spring, boy. It's half-way in May, time for a breath between mid
terms and a coke between classes, tanning time, beering time, take-it-easy
and-spit-on-the-Bawlout time. It's Stanford's favorite time of year, and
here on the Fawm the hearts of the hoary undergrads who remember when
there was a moon and a sun and at least equal numbers of both sexes are

humming the old familiar schmaltz'
of Stanford's favorite song. "That's
Stanford in Spring." So what? say
the wise ones. It doesn't go like that
any more. The song is tho same, but
the words are different, all right,
all ri;>ht. What's there about spring
anyway? This spring, for instance.
Well, lor instance—

The circus came to Paly the first

Stanford was there, chewing spun
sugar and buzzing around on the
