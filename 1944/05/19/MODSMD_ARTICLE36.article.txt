SOUTHEAST ASIA H.Q., KANDY,
Ceylon (UP) â€”American and Chinese
troops, in a sensational 50-mile ad
vance rfom the Mogaung Valley,
have captured the main airfields at
Myitkyiina, principal Japanese base
north of Mandalay, it was announced
tonight.
Shortly after the airport fell allied
troops were reported storming the
town of Myitkyina and collapse of
the entire enemy position in northern
Burma appeared imminent.
The victory, which will immeasur
ably hasten the re-opening of a land
supply route to China, was an
nounced in communiques issued si
multaneously at Lord Louis Mount
batten's H.Q. in Chungking.
The brilliant maneuver that out
witted the Japanese was carried out
by American and Chinese veterans of
jungle warfare occupied the Myit
kyina airdrome two miles south of
the city shortly before noon yester
day after a 20-day 112-mile forced
march across the forbidding Kumong
Range, east of the Mogaung Valley.
It represented a 50-mile net gain
from previously reported positions.
The Japanese defenders were
caught so completely by surprise that
they had no chance of carrying out
demolition of the 1,550-yard metal
runway, and as soon as oil drums
and logs littering the field had been
cleared, American engineers flown
in by gliders and Chinese reinforce
ments aboard transports poured in.
