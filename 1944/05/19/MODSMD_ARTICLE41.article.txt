# 'Student Sunday" Tradition Revived
## 
### 
All Stanford living groups arc in
vited to attend the chapel service to
gether this Sunday. This is the first
time during the year that the various
halls, sororities, and men's living
groups have had an opportunity to
attend church with each group as a
separate unit.
The center nave of the church will
be roped off for the living groups.
Faculty and other church attendants
will not be able to sit in the center
section of the chapel until 11.
"Student Sunday" has been a
chapel tradition of the past which is
now being renewed for the first time
since the University took control of
all men's living groups.
D. Elton Trueblood, chaplain, will
give the sermon for the morning.
