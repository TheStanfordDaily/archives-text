Rumor has it that a chapter of the
Big Time Operators is being formed.
On the prowl for further informa
tion, we invited Big Jim Brophy to
share a little java. After his second
cup Jim got a bit mellow and said:
"You're right, you're absolutely
right!"
Among dramatic tableaux on cam
pus last week was this touching in
cident. One G.I. stands before the
bond booth shelling out $18.75 for
a bond, CASH, while his two bud
dies commiserate on the sight of so
much borrowable green slipping out
of their reach. It's friendship, friend
ship. . . . An interesting sidelight is
the witty repartee conducted be
tween Harry Scott and the Physics
Dept. Harry writes comments on
his written assignments and gets
them back with subtle witticisms by
the faculty. And while we're speak
ing of the faculty, we think the most
disarming experience when you're
stuck on a chem procedure is to
have Mrs. Koenig show you a "seec
wet twick"!!
We note that music is enjoying
great popularity among the G.l.'s
Encina's corridors sound like an au
dition hall. There are several tra
ditions about some of the songs with
which not all of us seem to be ac
quainted. For instance, when some
one sings "Beautiful Texas" there is
a group of men who will spring to
attention and render the honors with
a tear in their eyes. We got to the
bottom of this cabal the other day
and the truth is that a Brooklynite
is the ringleader. Loyal Texans,
rally round!
Is Vee for Victory, or will she be
out there with three lieutenants
again this week-end?
Herman the German has lost. . . .
Chugalug.
