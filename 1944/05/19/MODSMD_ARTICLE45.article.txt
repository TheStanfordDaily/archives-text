# The 						Saga of Sadsack's Adventures—After AST
## 
### 
Greetings from the meandering
man of the mountains in the cloud
hangers of California. Yes, yours
truly may soon be an authority on
the folklore farthest from 'Frisco.
At present I am recuperating from
an orientation tour of the slopes and
steeps for a radius of twenty miles.
Yesterday, like Disney's dwarfs,
with packs on our backs to simulate
humps, we went off to work—on the
hills. And what joy it is scrambling
like ants up one hill, creeping like
snails down the other side, with the
supreme thrill of watching your feet
all the time and never getting a scant
view of the surroundings! Why I
have more altitude than a P-40 and
I think I should collect flight pay.
They can't fool me, though. Orson
Welles is behind it all—awaiting the
real invasion from Mars. I can't im
agine ever going to Hollywood to
be near a few stars when there are
millions of them so close to me
here.
Take It
You remember the song, "You
take the high road, and I'll take the
low road"? Well, if I ever get out
of here I'll take the railroad and to
blazes with walking. You've heard
about peoples' dogs barking, but
mine are probably the only ones
that can recite Lincoln's Gettysburg
Address. And as long as I'm on the
subject I think his Emancipation
Proclamation forgot all about the
71st.
However, with all the scenery and
wild life around one can't complain,
except that one gets lost in the scen
ery and the wild life is too familiar.
There are some species here that
would mak Frank Buck tremble,
and Barnum feel silly. And a circus
it is every night as I try to keep my
feet warm, my body covered, and
yet not suffocate. Ah, but there's
nothing like the call of the wild as
it hits you in the middle of the night
and you stumble through this gor
geous flora trying to find the com
fort station. Of course since all the
tents look alike, you spend the rest
of the night trying to crawl into
someone else's bed.
At the crack of dawn, you chip
the ice off, and look to see whether
Admiral Byrd is around. Assured
by the. surroundings that you are not
at Nome, Alaska, you take down
your stiff uniform from the corner
of the tent, and skipping merrily
over tent ropes, fallen tents, and hi
bernating bears—fall in. Or rather
freeze in. Teeth and knees chatter
and bang like Billy the Kid's last
fight must have sounded.
Salaam
At this time the sergeant sallies
forth, swathed in robes and furs, and
reads a bulletin from the California
Chamber of Commerce which says
that the temperature is moderate and
the sun is shining. He then states
that no clothing will be worn over
the overcoats, so we remove our
tents. Now, garbed in an electrically
heated suit, comes the captain and
gives the order of the day—sunrise,
noon; sunset, night—it's always the
same except when the sergeant says:
"You'll work this one out today."
Today may be taken to include any
period not less than a month nor
Wake Up
older than the Stanford Oak.
The lieutenants now appear, each
with a small stove and a picture of
Hedy Lamarr to keep them warm.
The cook at this point collects area
notes to start the stoves, and with
AST diplomas in hand, we line up
for chow. As the diploma is punched
you are entitled to one meal imme
diately after the officers, sergeants,
draftees, prisoners of war, and
MULES have eaten. The meal is
downed as medics stand about with
respirators and smelling salts. After
testing to make sure you have eaten
your quota of sand and leaves they
innoculate you to prevent infection

of the wild life and MULES.
You now stagger back to the tent
and gently awaken all your little
centipede pals. Then you fold your
blankets to 2" x 2" with a 1" over
fold and no coverage—Aß 1620-4;
Custer's last standing order. (He
was shot and it never has been
changed.)
Getting out for the whistle you do
seven deep knee bends in the direc
tion of the sun and pray for it to rise
so that you can read the scales to
weigh your pack in at its proper
52.67 lbs. It really doesn't matter
for you drop the decimal point as
soon as you get it on your back. So
you hop off and go looking for
mountains. Like the Mark Hop
kins elevator you go up, take a quick
look, tear down, and struggle up
with a full load.
Alms, Alms
In the afternoon we start out again
and on the way pass the cook with
his safari, looking for food. In one
hand he carries a blunderbuss and
i nthe other Mother Hubbard's "Ru
diments of Cooking." Walking gen
tly along the trail so as not to dis
turb the sleeping MULES, we sud
denly come across a large party led
by a man who quotes: "Dr. Living
ston, I presume."
Returning tired and weary from
the hike, we are handed axes and
with reckless abandon we cut up a
cord of wood for each officer, ser
geant, prisoner of war, and MULE.
Immediately after this, the sergeant
has a shakedown inspection for
matches, as it says on the bulletin
board, "NO FIRES HERE." Yet ev
ery night we chop wood.
Supper is better not mentioned in
polite society. And so you trot back
to your canvas casa and are about to
relax when mail call sounds.
Strictly from Garcia ....
The mail clerk is a postgraduate
of 4A and passed the requirements
of being unable to read. He stands
atop a package marked "FRAGILE"
and begins to toss letters at x'andom.
He tries to read—but to no avail. He
tries to spell—not a word—so in des
peration and with ta fiendish chuckle
he tosses the mail to the seven winds.
For a minute it looks like the Rose
Bowl goal line stand. After fighting
nail and tooth you finally get your
hands on a letter and hurry off to
some secluded spot. Alas, it is too
dark to read; so clutching it with
your mangled hand you stumble to
your tent. With much blowing of
whistles preceding the portentous
moment, the sadistic sergeant, bloat
ed with food, announces: "Lantern
slides tonight is compulsory." Off
you trot to the rocky hillside to see
the G.I. films on care and cleaning
of the Ml MULE; lighting a candle
with your hand as a torch; the func
tion and operation of G.I. "not a hair
left" soap.
The officer, wrapped in heavy furs
and two pictures of Betty Grable,
gives a short lecture on how won
derful California is, and the ser
geant's whip brings forth a unani
mous assent. Now come the slides,
yellow with age, describing how
Little Eva would have capitalized on
the ice like Sonja if she had had
skates. At least the newsreel is good;
according to the latest one, some
fellow named Edison has invented
an electric light. A sigh of joy
breaks the officers' snores —no more
candles.
The picture ends and the medics
carefully remove the frozen bodies
and as you file out over the fields
to your tent you think how lucky
you were to have gone to AST. Upon
arrival in the company, the sergeant
kindly provides each soldier with
an ice cake to freeze out the mosqui
toes. And, as the fires roar in the
officers' tents, and the beer bubbles
in the sergeants' quarters, sharp
cracks give evidence of the setting in
of rigor mortis in the enlisted men's
area.
