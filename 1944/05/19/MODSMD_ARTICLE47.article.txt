# AST Writer Evaluates Farm on invasion Eve
## 
### 
This spring is invasion eve. But
Stanford, you say, is still the same.
The highest level Stanford student
spirit, reaches is nosmokingonthe
quadism.
Well, before you say that again,
take a sharp look around . . .
In the Student Union, a group of
efficient girls daily direct the war
work most Stanford co-eds are do
ing. They are weeding gardens,
mowing lawns, doing chores, to re
place workers who now make tanks
and guns. Some soldiers work with
them —more are needed.
At the theater, and in the band,
students and soldiers meet, rehearse,
learn. At night, after work and
study, they work on the Spring
Show, designed to "liven up the
place" soon.
At the "Y" there is a race-rela
tions discussion group; moreover,
there are the international relations
forums and clubs, the Fridaay night
Chapel programs, the anti - Fascist
Stanford AYD club, the Tuesday

Evening Series. . . .
So you see, there is more than
meets the casual eye. This is spring
at Stanford, although the weeds grow
not green but brown, and the morn
ings grow foggier, and the nearest
thing to spring fever is the feverish
activity "in front of the libe to reg
peop to make the con hom sked."
And Stanford student spirit is
growing in tune with the nation in
this pre-invasion spring. Of course,
there are those who cry, "Please go
'way and let me sleep." They are
few. Their voices will be lost in the
next warm spring breeze, blowing
the sounds of our people overseas
striking the decisive blows; and our
people here supporting their effort.
