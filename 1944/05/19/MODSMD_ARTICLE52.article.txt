# Fear Not, It's Only the SCU Band
## 
### 
If you hear weird noises coming
from the Art Museum these Monday
and Friday eves, fret not, for that is
the SCU swing band sending with
the solid stuff. Now that preliminary
practice Ls over the group is smooth
ing out its arrangements into dance
able style. So far it numbers eleven
men, among whom are such fine cats
as Jackie Herr (dig thjs boy's horn),
tenor man Bob Payne, Bill Barbee
on the sliphom, Chuck Conners on
the drums, and Bobby Canote play
ing piano.
