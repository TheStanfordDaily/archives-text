### DICK BLOCK 
Softball Playoffs
The intramural softball season has
passed its half-way mark, so we
feel that it is about time to suggest
a playoff between the leading teams.
The system would be similar to
the process employed last summer
when the four leading teams of the
league fought for the championship.
Up to the present time the me
chanics of the campus circuit have
been working very smoothly. Con
trary to the pre-season belief that
the league would fold after a tew
games were played, and the strong
teams established, the games have
been played on schedule or in a tew
k cases at a later dale.
112 During the basketball season last
quarter defaults were as numerous
as games. Although in some cases
there might have been good reasons
for the defaults, in general the show
ing was a display of poor sportsman
ship and poor Stanford spirit.
The spirit shown during this sea- i
son has been very commendable,
and it's up to the eleven teams of the
league to keep the ledger clean.
There are only three more intra
mural dates left for softball, so the
co-operation of every individual
player is necessary for a successful
culmination of the league.
Daily-Chappie Conflict
The ancient conflict between the
Daily and the Chappie is taking to

I the baseball diamond on Friday,
' May 2(3.
The challenge of the Chappies was
, answered in The Daily on Wednes
day. The thundering words of our
j most noble sports editor, Sir Roge
| rier Corman, have instilled within
I the hearts of our opponents a deadly
l'ear. Since the acceptance of the
challenge appeared the office of the
Chappie has been alive with activity
as the star player of the comic book
is holding out for more money. We
of the Daily staff still contend that
I Repulso will refuse to sign, because
1 of the death of Flattop and the need
- of a new criminal for Acytray to ap
! prehend.
The move of the Chappie to chal
lenge such a formidable opponent as
The Daily will be remembered as
j one of the most foolhardy acts in
! history. They would have enough
[ trouble defeating the staff of the 1904
j Quad.
Enough of this war of wordsâ€”the
game shall be played, and once again
the Chappie shall be shattered by
the might and power of The Daily.
Don Langendorf, ex-editor of the
sports page, has been very diligent
in sending interesting articles about
the Farm from the Denver papers.

Double-Talk
In the April (i edition of the Den
ver Post there was an article by Wil
liam Eest. The article was concerned
with the Pacific Coast Conference
football activities of 1944.
In one spot of the article "Best
states that there are only two cer
tainties: (1) that there will be no
change in the 17-year-old, 4-F
makeup of college squads, unless for
the worse, and (2) Stanford once
more will have a varsity.
In another spot in the same ar
ticle the statement is made that
Stanford's A 1 Masters said Stunlord
would not play this year.
Instances are bound to occur very
often stating that Stanford will or
will not resume intercollegiate
sports, but very rarely will they
occur in the same article.
As the situation now stands the
Cardinal will not be represented on
the sports field until a much bigger
and more important game has
reached its climax.
