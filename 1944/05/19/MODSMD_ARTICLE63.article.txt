# Manager Alone Wins Pennant
## 
### 
The other day, in connection with
the New York Yankees, we raised
the question as to whether a great
manager or great players alone could
make a championship team. For
those those who don't believe that
a manager alone could do it, here
is the proof: one of the most amaz
ing feats in baseball.
In 1914, one month from the end
of the baseball season, the Boston
Braves, a club of left-overs and mis
fits on their way back to the minors,
were in last place in the National
League, 14 games behind. They were
at that time managed by George
Stallings, credited with the most acid
tongue in baseball.
With only 24 games left on their
schedule, Stallings began to bedevil
those old men almost to the point
of insanity. Not one of them escaped
his fiery tongue. And out of those
24 games, the Unconquerable Braves
won 22, beating the Pittsburgh Pi
rates out of the pennant by one
game. The bewildered Pirates had
already sold thousands of dollars'
worth of World's Series tickets.
In the World's Series that followed,
odds ran as high as 7 to 1 on the
Philadelphia Athletics to beat the
Braves. Yet the mighty Braves
swept four straight games from the
Athletics, to win the world's cham
pionship; all because Stallings had
succeeded in impressing the men that
the Athletics considered it an insult
to play on the same field with them.
