# BMO Chappie Confirms Rumor; Mag To Appear This Month
## 
### HENRIETTA NUSSBAUM 
Your "favrut" Daily reporter, in an interview with the Old Boy yesterday
afternoon, has confirmed the rumor that there is, has been, and will be a
humor magazine on the campus.
Bill Hyer, editor and BMO Chappie, stated that the theme of this quarter's
edition is being kept secret, but that the campus will know by the end of

Ihe month. He promises a new and
simple method of keeping the noses
of every Farm student buried in the
Chappie (he's printing it on Klee
nex!).
It's Edible
They're still a little upset up in the
Old Boy's hideout about what hap
pened last week. It seems that sev
eral representatives of the Readers'
Digest appeared in the Press build
ing and asked Hyer if the Chappie
could be digested. Hyer naively ad
mitted that it could, whereby one of
them yelled "OK. shove it down his
throat, boys!" (He had to open his big
mouth!)
This month's edition will welcome
back the famous English writer and
explorer, Sir Thomas T. Thomas-
Thomas, affectionately known as
Tom-Tom, who will convulse the
campus with more of his exotic wit.
The four old men will walk again,
with a new gag dreamed up by Hyer
and all the little Chappies. Dick
Fay ram, new art editor, has sketched
a beaut of a center spread, featur
ing insights on the types of Stanford
campus life (Such possibilities!).
Inner Secrets Exposed
By popular request, Farm Fables
will be featured, exposing the inner
secrets of you, and you, and YOU,
in bright red capital letters. Janey
Hart and Virginia Walker, femmes
fatales (that means good any way
you pronounce it) of the frosh class,
will be the campus queens.
Flo Bailey and A 1 Cleveland col
laborated on the opener, and Fcne
Zentner has written a real thriller
chiller, but when your reporter tried
to interview them, she was informed
that they were out digging traps
around third base on the sunken dia
mond in preparation for next week's
baseball game with the Daily. Bar
ney Gugcl, Daily staff member
turned quisling, was seen on the bot
tom step of the Press building, still
panting and muttering about the 28-
nile hike they took yesterday to get
into condition. Moral: They ain't got
a chance.

Tom-Tom, who will convulse the
campus with more of his exotic wit.
The four old men will walk again,
with a new gag dreamed up by Hyer
and all the little Chappies. Dick
Fay ram, new art editor, has sketched
a beaut of a center spread, featur
ing insights on the types of Stanford
campus life (Such possibilities!).
Inner Secrets Exposed
By popular request, Farm Fables
will be featured, exposing the inner
secrets of you, and you, and YOU,
in bright red capital letters. Janey
Hart and Virginia Walker, femmes
fatales (that means good any way
you pronounce it) of the frosh class,
will be the campus queens.
Flo Bailey and A 1 Cleveland col
laborated on the opener, and Fcne
Zentner has written a real thriller
chiller, but when your reporter tried
to interview them, she was informed
that they were out digging traps
around third base on the sunken dia
mond in preparation for next week's
baseball game with the Daily. Bar
ney Gugcl, Daily staff member
turned quisling, was seen on the bot
tom step of the Press building, still
panting and muttering about the 28-
nile hike they took yesterday to get
into condition. Moral: They ain't got
a chance.
Your "favrut" Daily reporter, in an interview with the Old Boy yesterday
afternoon, has confirmed the rumor that there is, has been, and will be a
humor magazine on the campus.
Bill Hyer, editor and BMO Chappie, stated that the theme of this quarter's
edition is being kept secret, but that the campus will know by the end of

Ihe month. He promises a new and
simple method of keeping the noses
of every Farm student buried in the
Chappie (he's printing it on Klee
nex!).
It's Edible
They're still a little upset up in the
Old Boy's hideout about what hap
pened last week. It seems that sev
eral representatives of the Readers'
Digest appeared in the Press build
ing and asked Hyer if the Chappie
could be digested. Hyer naively ad
mitted that it could, whereby one of
them yelled "OK. shove it down his
throat, boys!" (He had to open his big
mouth!)
This month's edition will welcome
back the famous English writer and
explorer, Sir Thomas T. Thomas-
Thomas, affectionately known as
Tom-Tom, who will convulse the
campus with more of his exotic wit.
