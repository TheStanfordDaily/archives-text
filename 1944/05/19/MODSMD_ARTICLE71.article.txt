# 'Silly Girl' Charming Life Story
## 
### NANCY TILDEN 
"Silly Girl," the third-person au
tobiography of Agna Enters—dance
interpreter, artist, and author of the
"Lost Angel" script—is a charming
and impressionistic melange of
scenes from a highly Bohemian
"early life."
The first section oi the book is a
series of sensitive and engaging
scenes from her childhood, appar
ently divided between the cabarets
and night clubs of Paris or New
York and the electric household of
her short-tempered grand'-mere in
Provence. Implied as explanation
are the ages of her father and
mother, 19 and 16 respectively when
they married, and the insatiable
restlessness of Felix, her Austrian
born, "free-thinking" father.
Sight and Sound of Kissing
If confusing as to sequence, time,
and place, these vignettes of child
hood are as sharply, convincingly
drawn as her amusing pen-and-ink
sketches which accompany them on
almost every page.
For instance, the half-pathetic,
half-comic accounts of her falling
asleep in the cloak room of some
country dance hall to be awakened
by the sight and sound of her very
pretty mother being kissed by some
strange man, or of her weeks of dis
tress over the 3,000-year-old Egyp
tian mummy her father showed her
in a museum, arc told with an ob
jectivity and dramatic economy rare
in an autobiographer.
Shaped by Accident
Characterizing herself as a "silly
girl" because she feels that in many
ways "she was a silly creature
shaped by accident," the second sec
tion of Agna Enters' story—the still
impressionistic but often quietly sa
tiric account of her start in New
York—shows her as the creature not
of accident but of a driving necessity
to paint, to dance, to be "of the
arts."
Leaving her Middle West home,
which sh«i calls New Berlin, at about
16 or 17 on her graduation from high
school, Agna Enters sets out with
$200 to study at the Art Students'
League in New York for six months.
"Oh. My God"
At the end of the six months she
is working eight hours a day block
ing letters for an advertising firm,
attending art class in the evenings,
doing "free-lance" advertising work
for extra funds until two or three
o'clock in the morning, and fore
going her noon sandwich to study
the ten basic gestures with Michio
Ito, the Japanese pantomime dancer
—and refuses to return home.
Her pictures of the lazy and con
fused Ito who exclaims, "Oh, my
God!" always at the c.id, not the
beginning, of his sentences and his
conglomerate and ever - moving
household are sketched with a care
fully impersonalized sense of the
comic.
More Active Half
Leaving her job with the ad
vertising firm, because she wants to
devote all of her time to her paint
ing and dancing, Miss Enters is later
forced for lack of employment to
become the more active half of a
dancing partnership with Ito.
Gradually she works out her own
theory of dance, develops aa num
ber of what she terms "composi
tions in dance form," and eventually
is performing them for the Moscow
Art Theater. By the time she leaves
for a tour of Europe, not yet 21, she
is so well known that Isabel Pater
son in the Herald Tribune says of
her, "We believe her to be the most
original American dancer since Isa
dora Duncan."
"Parvenu Idiocies"
Miss Enters concludes her autobi
ography of a ' Silly Girl"—an en
tertaining and often penetrating
presentation of the early devclop'-
ment of an artistic nature—with her
return from Paris to America, where
she sells to Hollywood "Mama's An
gel," later titled the "Lost Angel,"
a typically comi-satiric comment on
our psychology-bent modernity, and
then settles down to live in this
"community—of parvenu idiocies."

our psychology-bent modernity, and
then settles down to live in this
"community—of parvenu idiocies."
"Silly Girl," the third-person au
tobiography of Agna Enters—dance
interpreter, artist, and author of the
"Lost Angel" script—is a charming
and impressionistic melange of
scenes from a highly Bohemian
"early life."
The first section oi the book is a
series of sensitive and engaging
scenes from her childhood, appar
ently divided between the cabarets
and night clubs of Paris or New
York and the electric household of
her short-tempered grand'-mere in
Provence. Implied as explanation
are the ages of her father and
mother, 19 and 16 respectively when
they married, and the insatiable
restlessness of Felix, her Austrian
born, "free-thinking" father.
Sight and Sound of Kissing
If confusing as to sequence, time,
and place, these vignettes of child
hood are as sharply, convincingly
drawn as her amusing pen-and-ink
sketches which accompany them on
almost every page.
For instance, the half-pathetic,
half-comic accounts of her falling
asleep in the cloak room of some
country dance hall to be awakened
by the sight and sound of her very
pretty mother being kissed by some
strange man, or of her weeks of dis
tress over the 3,000-year-old Egyp
tian mummy her father showed her
in a museum, arc told with an ob
jectivity and dramatic economy rare
in an autobiographer.
Shaped by Accident
Characterizing herself as a "silly
girl" because she feels that in many
ways "she was a silly creature
shaped by accident," the second sec
tion of Agna Enters' story—the still
impressionistic but often quietly sa
tiric account of her start in New
York—shows her as the creature not
of accident but of a driving necessity
to paint, to dance, to be "of the
arts."
Leaving her Middle West home,
which sh«i calls New Berlin, at about
16 or 17 on her graduation from high
school, Agna Enters sets out with
$200 to study at the Art Students'
League in New York for six months.
"Oh. My God"
At the end of the six months she
is working eight hours a day block
ing letters for an advertising firm,
attending art class in the evenings,
doing "free-lance" advertising work
for extra funds until two or three
o'clock in the morning, and fore
going her noon sandwich to study
the ten basic gestures with Michio
Ito, the Japanese pantomime dancer
—and refuses to return home.
Her pictures of the lazy and con
fused Ito who exclaims, "Oh, my
God!" always at the c.id, not the
beginning, of his sentences and his
conglomerate and ever - moving
household are sketched with a care
fully impersonalized sense of the
comic.
More Active Half
Leaving her job with the ad
vertising firm, because she wants to
devote all of her time to her paint
ing and dancing, Miss Enters is later
forced for lack of employment to
become the more active half of a
dancing partnership with Ito.
Gradually she works out her own
theory of dance, develops aa num
ber of what she terms "composi
tions in dance form," and eventually
is performing them for the Moscow
Art Theater. By the time she leaves
for a tour of Europe, not yet 21, she
is so well known that Isabel Pater
son in the Herald Tribune says of
her, "We believe her to be the most
original American dancer since Isa
dora Duncan."
"Parvenu Idiocies"
Miss Enters concludes her autobi
ography of a ' Silly Girl"—an en
tertaining and often penetrating
presentation of the early devclop'-
ment of an artistic nature—with her
return from Paris to America, where
she sells to Hollywood "Mama's An
gel," later titled the "Lost Angel,"
a typically comi-satiric comment on
our psychology-bent modernity, and
