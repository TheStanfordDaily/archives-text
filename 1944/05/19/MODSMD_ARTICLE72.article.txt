# 'Miracle' Gets Rave Review
## 
### 
Now playing at the Stanford The
! ater: "The Miracle oi Morgan's
j Creek," starring Betty Hutlon and
| Eddie Bracken.
Betty Hutton and Eddie Bracken,
j long-suffering back
[ seat comedians, finally get their
chance and—with the help of a sen
| sational story and a sure-fire director
(Preston Sturges)—they make this
j picture one of the laugh riots of the
year.
Eddie Bracken's is a comi-pathetic
characterization that will long out
last its slapstick elements. The story
is improbable, but the characters
| aren't—and the miracle is nothing
I short of terrific. The setting is Mor
{ gan's Creek; and all the sets, people,
j and incidents are delightfully typi
; cal. It gives with a large bowl of
; cherrits to Paramount for the most
j original, the most stupendous, the
i most riotous—it's GOOD.
You'd better call up the theater to
1 find out what time "Miracle" starts,
1 so you won't have to sit through
"Knickerbocker Holiday," the com
j pan ion feature. Nelson Eddy romps
| about in a pair of very unattractive
I bloomers, but helps a completely
i childish and tedious production with
j his usual fine singing. Maybe older
men have lost their appeal, but we
| think Hollywood should have left
i this one to rest on its Stanford
! laurels.—MacVicar
