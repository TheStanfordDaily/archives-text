# G.I. BILL
## 
### 
Early in 1943 the American Council of Edu
cation distributed a questionnaire to educational
instutions and authorities in an effort to discover
a method of postwar education for servicemen—
through government aid. Such questions as fi
nancing, administration, elegibility, kinds of
schools and courses available, and necessary
legislation were discussed. Stanford contributed
suggestions for the formulation of a bill which
would provide postwar education for eligible
servicemen and women.
The House last Thursday included in its ver
sion of the "G.I. Bill of Rights," the following
measures in respect to education: (1) the right to
attend schools of their own choice for a maxi
mum of four years at Government expense pro
vided tuition and other fees do not exceed S5OO
annually; (on a three quarter basis, exclusive of
board and room, Stanford fees and tuition are
$429.00); (2) qualified, veterans without depend
ants would receive S5O monthly for subsistence
while in school, with 575 for those with de
pendents (veterans who were over 24 at the time
of entrance into the service would be required to
show that war service had interfered with their
schooling or that they were in need of a refresher
course); (3) the veteran would be allowed to at
tend a college, trade school or vocational school
of his own choice, provided it was approved by
educational authorities of the Veterans Adminis
tration. Every veteran who serves at least 90
days is entitled to 54 weeks of education; addi
tional schooling will depend on satisfactory
progress.
This bill must now go to the Senate for ap-,
proval or revision, but in its present form it has
been called "the most just and generous soldier
relief program in America's history."
The value of such a bill is much more than its
reported $6,500,000,000 for it is a promise to serv
icemen and women that nobody will have to sell
apples or pencils. It is also a great step forward
in the program for more education for everyone.
As far as Stanford is concerned certain facts
must be considered. First of all the University
can only accommodate a certain number of men
and women students. Fall quarter, with 5,300 in
cluding ASTs, was just too crowded. All teach
srs could do was teach—they had no time for
research or reading. Housing and eating fa
cilities were strained; therefore, Stanford does
not desire a large student body.
With a small student body more selective aca

demic standards can be maintained, and special
emphasis be given the various graduate pro
grams.—Dave Davis
