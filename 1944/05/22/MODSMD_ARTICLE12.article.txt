To the Editor:
The unanimous decision of the national Coun
cils of the nine Panhellenic groups represented
at Stanford to withdraw their charters at the close
of the current quarter is an acceptance of the fact
that conditions at Stanford no longer make it
possible to achieve normal constructive chapter
life. 0
The principle involved in the impending
change strikes deeper than a shift from autono
mous grouping of women at Stanford to a com
plete University-run housing program. First of
all, it is necessary to disassociate the idea of
housing units and chapters. Greek letter or
ganizations, both men's and women's, are unique
American institutions indigenous to our soil. The
first, Phi Beta Kappa, was founded in 1776, as a
means of recognizing high scholarship. .Others
of the social or friendship groups originated in
the pioneering years of American universities to
supplement the intellectual development of the
classroom with well-rounded programs for social
and moral growth. For well over a hundred years
they have functioned, both in the United States
and Canada, achieving their purpose both within
and without housing units.
For over 50 years Stanford members of our
organizations have contributed time, money, and
loyalty in an effort to make our chapters useful
units in campus life. We have expended thou
sands of dollars to provide housing for nearly
300 more women per year than the University
could accommodate, inviting into our member
ship those who were willing to assume the extra
responsibilities, both financial and personal, that
such a way of living involves. We have made our
campus homes attractive meccas for returning
alumnae, whose continuing interest in Stanford
affairs has thus been strengthened and encour
aged. We have offered practical aid toward high
scholarship and worthy standards of living by the
help and advice of unselfish alumnae whose con
stant contact with the undergraduates has supple
mented the guidance of wise housemothers in
creating family spirit. We have given and re
ceived from Stanford in all our national associa
tions and endeavors.
Invited and assisted in the first years of Stan
ford by Administration and "Old Guard" faculty,
many of whom were members of Greek letter
organizations, we have grieved to sense the
growing lack of understanding for our aims and
purposes. This has been evidenced in the lack
of cooperation we have had from the Administra
tion staff for over 20 years, the increasingly arti
ficial barriers placed between independent
women and those with Greek letter affiliation,
the refusal to allow the extension of the fraternity
system in relation to the increase in the number
of women students, and the rigid limitation of
the membership in chapters to the number which
could be accommodated in the chapter houses.
Thus it is that in a day when in many places
college authorities accord the system more re
spect than at any time in history, Stanford has
failed to take advantage of what the late Henry
Suzzalo, '99, former president of the Carnegie
Foundation, designated as "one of the finest pow
ers for good that university administration has at
hand."
We deeply regret that in a day when training
in tolerance and respect for the right of others
is a basic educational necessity Stanford should
see fit to deny any group the right to organize
socially with freedom to select for members those
who could be welded into harmonious family
units.
We are sorry to remove these charters from an
institution like Stanford; but the dictum of the
Board of Trustees has left us no other course.
Carol Green Wilson '14,
President, District VI
Kappa Alpha Theta.
