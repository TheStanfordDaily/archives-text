..The mural sol'thall circuit reaches
the end of its schedule Tuesday, a
week from tomorrow, and brings up
the question of post-season games.
This season has been just about tops
lor interest and enthusiasm, with
most teams emphatically in favor of
some form of post-season arrange
ment of games.
Three plans are open. We can have
a wholesale play-off between all the
squads, or we can have one game be
tween the champs of the civilian
league and the army champs, or we
can have both the play-off and the
title contest.
II a play-off is used, the teams with
good records should be given an ad
vantage because of their showing in
regular league play. This could be
done by having the first-place squad
play the last; the second-position
men, the second last; and so on down
the line. With elimination upon loss
of a game, the winners would ad
vance to the second round, and keep
going until the ultimate champ is
crowned.
This way the top teams wouldn't
kill each other ofi early, but would
go far unless one of the lower-place
squads proved its worth by an upset
victory.
A title game for the University
Softball championship could be ar
ranged between the civilian and
army champs. The meeting of the
Roble Hashers from the civilian
league and Co. D from the Army for
the basketball crown last quarter
was a huge success, and every indi
cation points to the same success if
a similar method is followed for soft
ball.
We can use either or both of these
plans. Our suggestion is that we use
both. A play-off will be arranged to
determine the civilian champs, after
which the winners would meet the
army title holders for the University
soltball crown.
