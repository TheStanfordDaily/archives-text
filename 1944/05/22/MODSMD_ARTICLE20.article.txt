# Med School Cinches Pennant By Defeating Firehouse, 7-6
## 
### BILL ADAMS 
Having defeated the Firehouse by j
a score of 7 to G on Thursday night. !
the thundering Med School nine
now appears to be cinch for the in
tramural baseball pennant. Only
games remaining on the Meds' j
schedule are Monroe, Tyler, and j
Gerona, all of which should go to
the navy boys without too much dif
ficulty.
The hot and cold Monroe team, |
next on the Med boys' list, might |
offer some real competition, but the
powerful hitters of the Meds should 1
be able to overcome the pitching of
Joe Sher and Bob Forbes.
Wayne Price should be able to
handle Monroe's best hitters fairly
successfully.
Little Resistance Expected
Neither Tyler nor Gerona will j
probably offer very much resistance, |
although Gerona has one of the j
smoothest-fielding outfits in theÂ»
league at times.
Thursday night's game was the |
real test for the Med School team, i
and they proved their superiority I
with a triple and a single in the j
second overtime inning to score the j
winning run. The Firehouse scored
two runs in each of the first, hird, j
and fifth innings to take a lead of G <
to 1, the Meds scoring one run in '
the first inning.
Navy Rallies
Going into the last half of the sixth j
inning, the navy boys rallied for five j
runs to tie the count, as Firehouse !
Pitcher Luke Pitts gave up three
hits and three walks, and his team- '
mates made one error. The next two j
innings saw both Pitts and Price bear
down into a real pitcher's duel in I
which neither side collected a hit, I
and then came the ninth inning and j
Pri(?fc's clutch single to win the ball |
game.

Both sides turned on excellent
performances in the field, all of
Firehouse's runs being on hits and
walks. Both Price and Pitts re
tained perfect control until the sixth
inning, when Pitts appeared to crack
momentarily, allowing five runs to
score. Price Struck out six, and
Pits, ten. The longest hit of the game
was the ninth-inning triple for the
Med School which subsequently
scored the winning run. Firehouse's
Ashley had the best average of the
day with three hits.
