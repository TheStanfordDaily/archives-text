# Cardinals Announce Three-Day June Drive for New Members
## 
### BETH MacVICAR 
Cardinals will hold a three-day
membership drive during the first
week of June, according to Barbara
White, president of the organization.
All eligible tryoutees will appear be
fore the present Cardinals members
for personal interviews, at which
time they will recount their extra
currucular activities in the past.
Positions are open to both women
and men. Customarily membership
is restricted to junior and senior
classmen; those who will be in upper
division next year are eligible to try
out. At present the group consists of
10 regular members, of which six are
men, four women, a hangover from
the days of the Ratio.
Cardinal Members
In addition to the president, Miss
White, Cheri Martin, secretary,
Nancy Griffin and Blossom Parke are
regular women members; Bob Fess,
Charley Clark. Carl Mason, Bob

! Morrisson, Dick Bartle, and Norm
Schieber, until his departure into the
Navy, are the regular men. Luana
Forkner, as A.S.S.U. vice-president,
; Carol Hurwitz, in her capacity as
| War Board head, and Ric Supple,
j Farm cheerleader, are ex officio
i members.
A definition of the Cardinals: the
J functioning body of Excom. More
1 than this, the Cardinals are pledged
| to keep alive that intangible some
thing called the Stanford spirit, and
j have given it a chance to express
itself during the last two quarters
with the Bond Drive, the Red Cross
I Drive, and Con Plorne Week.
Cardinal Victories
The Bond Drive, sponsored in con
; junction with the War Board,
j brought in enough money to give to
all the glow that goes with helping
the war effort and beating Cal. Cheri
' Martin headed the Red Cross Drive,
i surpassing easily the $2,000 goal that

had never been reached in.former
years.
And having read about the Con
Home returns, it's obvious that this
year has been a successful one for
students, for drives —and for Cardi
nals.
Other Activities
Cardinals is also responsible for
the Red dances each quarter. The
recent Sadie Hawkins l'ete, chair
manned by Dick Bartle, was an in
dication of "Cardinal genius." Blos
som Parke directed the highly suc
cessful Spring Sing on May 5, and
Ric Supple was active as emcee.
That's not all. Cardinals takes
care of a lot of little things, too —
student get-togethers and rallies and
orientation. Their job is a big one,
and calls for energetic, responsive
workers. Tryoyts are coming up, and
Cardinals urges you who are inter
ested to be present for interviews
during the fifst week of June.
